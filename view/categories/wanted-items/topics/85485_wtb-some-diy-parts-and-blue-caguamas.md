[BUY] DIY parts and blue caguamas (used is ok). The parts I'm looking for would be a 2.4GHz mini remote controller+receiver, the common one with a trigger and steering wheel. I also need a ppm cable to hook up the receiver and vesc, 3 pin 2mm specifically (like flipsky's, I have a FSESC6.6 for compatibility info). For the blue cags, if there are bearings with built in spacers that'd be a bonus but I really only care about the wheels. I also need a 12mm 5m belt that's around 260-280mm in length.

I have found various places to buy all these parts new, I just want to see whether there are people who can sell them used for a very slight markdown. Also I can't find a ppm vesc cable other than on flipsky's site and I really don't want to pay shipping that's 10x the price of my item lol, so maybe I'm an idiot and can't find ppm cables within the US. I'm mainly looking for the blue cags and ppm tbh, the remote and belt are much easier to find. Thanks in advance guys.

@Skunk  Ah those aren't in stock, and it's also a split ppm. I only need it for one vesc.

@Skunk no prob man :slight_smile:

If you (or anyone) knows where to get the ppm cable compatible with the flipsky single FSESC6.6 within the US, I'd be grateful. Thanks.

Something like that? You could just buy a servo extension and cut it/strip it... :slight_smile:

@Mich21050 Yeah that's true, I'm trying to find one that is like this: https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/ppm-cable-used-for-connection-with-remote-and-receiver?variant=9239425777724 

It looks like the servo cable you linked has on both sides the "2.54mm Female Dupont jumper" that is listed on Flipsky's site. It looks like that servo cable would connect to this receiver just fine:

I wonder if that means I'd have to solder the other side to my VESC? If so I don't think it'll work because my flipsky fsesc has a 3 pin plug already attached and I wouldn't want to ruin it with my shit soldering skills lol. Thanks for looking tho, I appreciate it.

You could make one yourself... You only need a jst-ph connector and one of those servo extensions... :slight_smile:

@Mich21050  hmm that's true. Do you know if the ends of those servo cables are actually the same as what flipsky calls "2.54mm female dupont jumper"?

Nope, they don't. You would have to cut the end of the servo cable off and crimp this plug on it:

In the correct order of course.. :slight_smile:
