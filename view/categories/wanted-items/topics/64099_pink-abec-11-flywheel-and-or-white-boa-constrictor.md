Kind of an old thread, but I've also found myself in the market for white constrictors. Anyone know when they'll be back in stock or have a set they're looking to get rid of?

I sold a sets then gave another set to my friend, my dad owned a skate shop then closed down due to online websites taking over the skate industry. Not sure what my friend did with them, but if you want his number to try to sort out a deal with him, PM me and I’ll give you his number

Well, you are one lucky guy, I hit the jackpot and I’m going to have two used sets soon. Also will have the green electric flywheel, and red electric flywheel
