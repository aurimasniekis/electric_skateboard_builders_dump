So I managed to break my motor this morning.

Looking for a replacement so is there anyone parting with a 6374 motor with 8mm shaft?

Either that or have a broken 6374 I could replace the hub from?

Thanks
Norcs

Not Maytech üòÅ. Which bolt holes were you using? Outer or inner?

Damn, how did you break that? I have one as well and I'm getting a bit worried, with the amount of people using it (and breaking the mounting part)  I think we should find the problem and a way to fix it
