We're guys, trying to help a friend out!

We're making him his first basic electric longboard and he needs parts!  The plan is a single wheel belt drive for campus cruising...maybe 25mph top speed? Located in US (Delaware)

What we bought:
- 36" oak longboard deck (no drop and slight curve) w/ grip tape
- 20x EBL 18650 3000mah (we think 10A cont. only 2500mah) [will do 10s2p]
- 2x Caliber II trucks (45*)
- 4x Orangantang 80mm 80a Kegel core wheels
- 1x TB ESC 4.12 (broken and repaired)

What we need:
- 1x motor (700W ish?)
- 1x motor mount (for Calibers)
- 1x motor pulley
- 1x wheel pulley (Kegel core)
- 1x belt
- 1x enclosure (20'x9'?)
- 1x remote w/ receiver
- 1x 10s BMS 
- 1x 42V 2-4A charger

Preferably HDT M5 for the belt and hardware

Enclosure and remote you can get from @psychotiller

Bms, motor and pulleys you can get them from @JLabs if he has them in stock and he is only in PA.  Motor is more than what you lost but it is a 6374 which will work well for a single drive. You will want a 36v charger as that is 10s. Luna cycle sells a 36v 42v nominal and can charge 1amp-5amps

Probably should've said...we're not looking to make a top notch board...much lower quality than what psychotiller has

You could probably make an enclosure if you wanted to
