Hi,

I'm looking for a broken, non- functional or a non-needed 10s BMS preferably from batterysupports.com which I can get for cheap.

Thanks!

Where are you located? I have a couple from Bestech. One is with 80a discharge, the other with 60a. Both are with e-switch. 
They are both fried somewhere. Haven't bothered to try to fix them....

Do you know why they failed? How long did they last?
