Hi, after lurking here for a few weeks, I've finally decided I want to build my first eskate. I would prefer to buy used but functional parts, this includes:

* Dual hub motor
* Preferably an Evo 36 Falcon 36"
* A VESC
* An enclosure 
* And an assembled battery pack preferably in a 10s2p/10s3p configuration


EDIT: I think I'll just stick to pre-built boards for now. Maybe in the future, I'll make a belt driven DIY board, who knows

The easiest way is: buy a Meepo, wowgo, ownboard,etc. And transplant everything to another deck. They are starting to sell 10s3p 30Q packs also.

Alright thanks, ill take a look at that. Would it be possible to switch out the ESC  to a VESC and use a firefly remote?

I would not advise it. In the future you'll want more range and more power, meaning more batteries and 1 long enclosure. So it's not worth it the extra trouble

So this is one option of battery. But I'm sceptical that it will fit in eskating enclosure :thinking:
If you have flexibility in the budget, I would commission a custom battery from @pjotr47 or maybe even @taz

Thanks for the reference Roman but I haven't decided if I want to start offering battery building services apart from myself and friends.

If I were doing this build, I would get Meepo 100mm hubs/front wheels and Meepo Shredder truck set, Meepo Classic ESC or Flipsky 4.20 plus VESC, Torqueboards 10s4p (always go for more battery than you think you'll need), and if going VESC, Flipsky Nano or your feather remote.
