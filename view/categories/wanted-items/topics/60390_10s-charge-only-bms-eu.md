Yup title says it all.
I ordered a few from ebay. Just don't want to wait 30-40 days on them. So you have a spare?

I was in the same situation as you. 
Ordered this one : https://m.banggood.com/10S-36V-40A-18650-Li-ion-Lithium-Cell-Battery-Protection-BMS-PCB-Board-With-Balance-p-1256274.html?rmmds=search

If you choose "priority direct mail" they are sending through Netherlands. I usually have it within 10 days

Strange. ... Do you choose "ad to Cart" and not "buy now" to give you more shipping options![Screenshot_20180629-101436|281x500](upload://6jRipzQKFFBBeHnqP5PQL0s1I46.png)
