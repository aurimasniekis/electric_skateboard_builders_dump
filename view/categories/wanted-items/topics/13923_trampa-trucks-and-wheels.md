I have a etoxx chain drive and rspec motors with vescs and I need trampa trucks and wheels next so I figured I would see if anyone had an old pair of something and also wondering if the ultimate trucks are worth the difference between the vertigo trucks?

I have Vertigo trucks (not for sale) and am happy with them. I believe the only differences between Vertigos and Ultimates are the color and the axle material (titanium in the Ultimates).

IÂ´m planning my trampa aswell and IÂ´m asking myself the same question.
Vertigo or Ultimate and Hypa or Superstars?
@esk8  @Blasto @Nowind  @trampa 
just to ask a few with experience about some differences between them.

In Frank's words: "Titanium is not the choice Nr. 1 if you want to build your board. Usually kiteboarders use it due to corrosion issues (beach, salt).
Steel is much stronger and more suitable for e-boards"

Vertigo, Superstar or Hypa - depending on weight and how serious your ride style is.

I think you must build your Trampa out MTB Parts (Trucks)
no Kite Trucks with 10mm.
Superstar Wheels have Aluminium Spokes and was very solid.
And i think, the Spring in black was a must have by the Trucks.

Since this is related, I wanted to ask:

When is there gonna be some more info about the ''huge'' Urethane wheels, which could somehow fit the hypa hubs?

I remember you posted a picture of such ''3d model'' where the urethane wheels were quite big..

Im not sure which thread it was.. so im just asking you here!

Looks like Ground industries had something like this in mind a long time ago.. I wonder what really made the company go down..

Shit quality made them go down. 
Fantastic design, but everything failed. 
MTBs weren't that famous by the time they went bust and the competition had better performing products.
The urethanes tires never really hit the market. They make sense on e-boards, not on downhill boards. We basically thought of making them in 2009 but never pushed the but on until now.

Nice, thanks for sidestory for this..

Yes, eboards definately have a bit different needs for regular riding and other associated features which happen only to eboards..

If you can stay away from this! Its a waste of money if you ask me. Its probably many many years old, tires don't get better over time, bindings are not very good, the steering cubes fail al the time (urethane ripping apart), no fresh replacements available and its a wooden deck. Wood's no good, don't be a plank, ride a Trampa!

Frank, i thought the same, i should have said that i posted it to show how bad the product was in real life compared to the nice looking photo and that my intention was proving your reply to the same post correct, anyway personally i wouldnt steal it let alone buy it :laughing: and yes Viva la Trampa.

 The foot straps looks super comfy though. Like you could wear them with sandals.  Wish Trampa come out with some big wheels  like these. ðŸ¤”

The GI-Bindings are simple pads from a snowboard binding. Super uncomfortable, since designed to strap down your snowboard boots.

 I was just teasing about the straps Frank. What I really want to know is when can I pre-order some sweet big ass urethane wheels?
