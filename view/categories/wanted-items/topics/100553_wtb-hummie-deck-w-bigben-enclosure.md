Hey there @Hummie  - last I saw, there were only 10 of 50 orders in our so, yeah? I was just putting out feelers for a used set because I know how mysteriously long the group buy can take sometimes. What is the actual total if I'd like to join the group buy and have the inserts drilled and everything? (I was a little confused by the +40..)
And just to clarify, I pay via paypal in full now and wait for the group to get to 50 orders before they're even made, and then shipped by order of payment?)

The $195 is for deck and enclosure shipped ...with additional $40 for inserts installed totalling $235?

Does the group buy have to hit 50? It is taking longer than I thought it would to reach that. Or will you start the manufacturing after some time?

It's a classic eboard being so long and stable.  Great for going fast.
