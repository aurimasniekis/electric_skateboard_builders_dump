You'll possibly be looking for something a bit smaller?

Go to Bauhaus and get yourself a plant tray - cost me like 2€ I think.

Man this one looks great, why did I mess around with fiberglass
If this could hold the weight of the electronics without the straps it would look amazing

why don't you just do what everyone else seems to be doing - buy a cheap sheet of Kydex off eBay and press it on to a block of wood?
