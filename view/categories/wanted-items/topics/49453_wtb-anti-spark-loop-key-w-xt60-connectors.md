I have a health condition that makes it difficult to hold things steady and have already burned myself a bunch trying to solder. if anybody has an anti-spark loop key (preferably xt90 for the anti-spark and w/ xt60 connectors between the battery and vesc) they'd like to sell I'm happy to pay for shipping. 
Thanks
