Hi guys! I need to test it out this hub motors https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-usa-group-buy-90mm-dual-hub-motors-75kv-or-130kv-dual-170-euro-5-to-go/62002?u=rey8801 to post a review. I am waiting a couple of Paris trucks clone but they are still far away and I would like to test them sooner. So I am looking for a couple of Paris trucks original or clone ones. AS long they are black and at least the 180mm version. The original ones I can not find them for less than 60 Euro, so if you have better source, let me know!
I see that Meepo has similar truck, do you guys know whether they are paris truck style? Someone has it? https://meepoboard.com/products/front-truck?variant=42272133449.
Shipping to Belgium.

Thanks! :wink:

Thanks, but the price is still more than 60 Euro for 2 trucks. Then I can buy it from sickboards or https://www.boardsandmore.eu/product-categorie/sport/longboard/longboard-trucks/ here for a bit less

edit: Sickboards have them too and cheaper :), ok :D

lots of hard discounted paris trucks (17.50€ / truck) and arbor decks in this sale : 30 hours remaining, you have to register and understand a bit of french to be able to see. I was able to order from Belgium.
