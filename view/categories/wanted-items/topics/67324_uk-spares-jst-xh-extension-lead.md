Hi everyone,

I'm in need of 3 JST-XH extension leads. Need to be 3s, like these:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/jst-xh-3s-wire-extension-20cm-10pcs-bag.html

Anyone in the UK got some spare before I order these from HobbyKing? They're out of stock in the UK warehouse so have to come from their EU one and postage makes them a £5 product which is a rip off!

Cheers,
Daniel

Go to your local electronic shop and by some plugs and pins.They easy made by your own.
Cheaper and you can choose your own length.

You could try rs components in the uk.  Pretty sure they stock the connectors and pins and the crimp tools too.  Next day delivery on stocked items but you pay a bit more.
