Can anyone agree this would be a good fuse? 100A 80V So 12s wont cook it? :)

Thats a 8kw fuse, are you sure your battery can deliver that much power?

Well Im shooting for at least a 12s4p of either samsung 30T or 40T... So a little bit of power, but I dont know how to calculate the kw output. 

Ill be using 1:5 helacial and dual 170kv 6374s :)

Can you maybe recommend one that would operate better?

and can someone already do a 40t group buy :sob::joy:

@mmaner I need one of these too, but make sure its attached to a 12s4p battery thats mounted under a MTB with gear drives and 6880s. Cool? I'll pay for shipping so don't worry about that!

Oh and of you anyhow just on the making for @Itsmedant i need a dual loopkey fused for 100a per xt90, if possible with a flat profile and in black because I hate the yellow color.
If you don‚Äôt know what else to do you can build me the board around too...no need for a battery though, without it‚Äôs more easy for me to pay shipping
