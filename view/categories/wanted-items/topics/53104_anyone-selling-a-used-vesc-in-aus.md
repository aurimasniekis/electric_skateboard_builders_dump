I already have a vesc (the old version 4.12 I think)

They are no good... 1 has drv fault and one overheats.

I suggest buying focbox or escape.

It’s the one part you shouldn’t cheap out on I’ve discovered after blowing $300

Cheaping out on vesc is a no-no for me.

If you really have to, you can try [Maytech 12S 50A HV super esc based on vesc bldc motor controller](https://wholesaler.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-12S-50A-HV-super-esc_60529988292.html?spm=a2700.icbuShop.89.2.2f864eddKqT2tB), which is brand new for just 99.90USD.

Their shop front is on [Alibaba.com](https://maytech.en.alibaba.com/)
