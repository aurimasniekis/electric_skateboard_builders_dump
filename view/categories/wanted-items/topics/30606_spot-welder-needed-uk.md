There is a guy on here from Shrewsbury who has been making packs on the uk-esk8 group not sure of his user on here but probably closer and easier.

@Trans-amers

If I did it, it would have to be done by post. You could get the cells sent direct to me and then I could send you the pack...

Sounds good. I'm trying to touch base with local riders, it would be good to have a local network of people to have a chat with about their builds and experiences as well as the wider forum community

So.... I'm actually doing this as a thing now.... Can make whatever pack you want, shape size, voltage etc.

I do everything by email/phone/post.

The Evolve battery upgrade is just another battery pack...
