I've got some 15mm HTD belts for sale.

Here's what I've got:

2x New 53T (265mm)
1x New 57T (285mm)
2x Used 53T (265mm)

The used belts probably have around 350 miles on them. They were used on a 1600w dual drive setup (800w per motor), so they saw relatively low stress in operation. They have no major cracks or tears, and no pebbles or sand pressed into them.

Asking prices:

New Belt - $8 ea.
Used Belt - $5 ea.

Add $2 for shipping in US

It might have been easier if you post a list of what you need and then people could respond with what they have to match your list.
I have some extra parts and could probably help you out.

I have a set of 97mm Clone black wheels with 2 set of 36T Aluminium pulleys attached and 2 15T motor pulleys, plus two set of 255 and 265mm belts. Everything is new although one set of pulley has chipped paint, but never used. Price is $70 plus shipping from bay area. I don't think you can find a cheaper or better deal on wheels and pulleys. Hell pulleys alone would be worth more than the total.

Damn son! Did I just provide you with something that's gonna drain your teenage wallet? Sorry... Got a job? time to get one or a better one because this is going to get expensive. Happy you are going to build instead of just slapping it on that Pulse. Now get a GD soldering iron =) 

I think @JLabs is checking interest in 12s4p & 10s4p packs for a pretty good price. Will come with BMS, switch, gauge etc.

Check this thread to see if anyone is selling those sweet cyber Monday $100 FocBoxes for just a small profit

no idea yet but as a flat pack just get a 18650 and line it up to get approximate 10s4p would be length of 20 cells. 12s4p would be 24. Not sure how the BMS, swtich, charge port and LCD is arranged in or out of the pack makes a difference.

when you get that soldering iron also get a Dremel. These will be your best friends in life, not just this hobby. You will need to cut out the holes yourself and secure the ports, etc to it.

Only the first one is metal and its aluminum. but its has 3d printed end caps. you could mount switches/connectors on there.

but these are just the battery enclosures. the esc/rx/antispark would go in a smaller box.
think boosted/meepo. split cases.
