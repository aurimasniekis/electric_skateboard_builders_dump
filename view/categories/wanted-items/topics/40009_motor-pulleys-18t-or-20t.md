Where can I get some HTD5m 18t or 20t motor pulleys with an 8mm bore and 12mm width, preferably steel?  Thanks

I didn't even see them, in fact I didn't even look.  Guess that'll show me not to assume I know everything that everyone is selling :slight_smile:.  I ordered some 20T HTD5 15mm Motor Pulley(s) from @torqueboards, that should do the trick.  I would mind some steel 18T motor pulleys if anyone know where to get them.  thanks

Sorry for bumping, but I'm now looking for a 18t pulley. I can't find any in 15mm width that has a keyway... 
Anyone? 18t, 15mm width, 8mm bore, keyway and set screw would be perfect.
