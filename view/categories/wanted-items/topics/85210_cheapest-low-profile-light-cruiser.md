I'm thinking about replacing my single chain DC build with a dual hub lipo cruiser, what's the cheapest reasonable build?  I'm thinking less than $250 and less than 8kg

Drive train: ($129) (4kg) eBay dual hub 550W 90mm [offer of dual Koowheel made]
ESC: ($66) (1/3kg) dickyho dual hub ESC w/ remote
Battery: ($42) (2/3kg) Turnigy 6s 4Ah lipo (butterfly modded) [offer of 3x 4s Flourion cells made]
Deck: (owned) (1/2kg) nickel board deck
Enclosure and handle: (not a lot) (1/2kg) vacuuformed sheet and 3D prints 
Charger: (owned) iMax B6 (hence the 6s)

Maybe looking for a 10s lipo bms if you got one

Post if you know where to get cheaper
PM if you've got something similar you wanna sell

Have ___ to trade for stuff
- glowing white ABEC clones w/ bearings
- 10s DC ESC and remote
- 170mm super light white RKP trucks (steel axle and plastic hangar/baseplate)
- TKP trucks with welded mount (made for 3" DC motor but I can re-drill them for you)
- 180mm clone Paris trucks (perfect condition)
- 60mm longboard wheels (I can steal them from the other wheels)
- 50mm skateboard wheels w/ bearings
```

The esc he wants to use doesn’t accept any of the battery combinations made with 4s batteries unless completely dismantled

I want a higher voltage pack but then I'd need to buy an 8s or 10s BMS

I don't think I'll need more than 14mph on a campus board and I don't think it's safe on such a small deck

TKP trucks with welded mount
[/quote]

If these are the trucks I think they are, they might be Caliber TKP hollow-kingpin.


Neither 50xx nor 63xx but would need to be drilled for mount holes.

I'm not sure the hubmotors will work fine with the esc.
I have had that esc too and it did only work with motor with a specific amount of motorpoles.
If you wanne be sure it works well I should also buy hubmotors from dicky.

Ownboard also sells pretty affortable and good hubs and esc.

Gonna risk it for the biscuit, $40 less for front trucks and 200W more power.  Bobby says it works well enough for what I need so I'm gonna go for it
