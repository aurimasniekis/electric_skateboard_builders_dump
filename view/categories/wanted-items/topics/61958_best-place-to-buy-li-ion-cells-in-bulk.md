Does anyone know the best place to purchase Li-Ion cells in packs of 50 or more at a good price? I am specifically looking for Samsung 25R 2500mah cells. I bought some of these from ebay, but at least 1 in 20 of the cells had a voltage at least .2 volts below the rest.

NKON have a very good rep for selling genuine brand new cells, just make sure you use the english version of their site which excludes VAT. From memory I think it's https://eu.nkon.nl

Depends where u live... if ur in the states I would say IMRbatteries, if ur across the pond I say nkon... shipping, customs, and waiting for possibly a month isn't worth it to save 10-15$

IMRbatteries,

Yeah I think this is where I am going to buy. I'd much rather buy from an American company if given the option.

Like I said the only difference is time and about 10-15$ depending on the quantity u buy... I usually buy 100-200 at a time

FWIW, it's still worth checking both sites from US, IMO (if you're buying enough for bulk discount + offset the shipping)...

Not sure what the current prices are, but my last nkon order (within the last year) was 148 cells for a little over $450 with shipping... and at the time it was easily the best deal I saw among the sites mentioned.  They did take a couple weeks to ship, however (but once they did ship, it only took a couple days for them to arrive).
