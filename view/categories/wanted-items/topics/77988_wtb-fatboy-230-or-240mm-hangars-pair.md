pretty sure they're gonna take years to be made and shipped? I've contacted @Kug3lis so let's hope for the best

I think the first group buy is over but he did say that he will have a second buy ready to go after the first lot has shipped, so like early to mid January

There really aren't a lot of them floating around out there.  I think getting from @Kug3lis and @3DServisas is your only bet.

Maybe I am wrong though.

Run one on each truck? or mount them on opposite sides of one truck? prefer the former.

Thought you got that all sorted?  Get some tb mounts and you're sorted.  More likely to get those than 3d hangers mate
