Sorry to dig this up again, but has anyone had any updates on VESC orders? I ordered 5 weeks ago and it hasn't shipped yet. I got an update over 2 weeks ago saying they would ship later that week... which didn't happen I guess. Is this normal for Chaka?

I ordered last friday and he said via PM that he would be current with orders by the end of this week. He mentioned that he had a huge orders from MIT and other schools that wanted his vesc for robotics. Apparently they were racing to build enough Vesc to fill orders for the start of the semester. I am not trying to wait a month+ for a vesc so I hope chaka isnt lying.

Thanks for the update @STREETSURFER. I really hope he gets back on track too and they ship this week.

@ARetardedPillow, I KNOW! I haven't ridden in about a month and a half and the weather has been perfect that whole time, its driving me absolutely nuts.

Chaka takes a while. The product is good but you're gonna wait for it. I don't have a spare VESC atm but you can probably get a maytech in a week or so off ebay

@faithfulpuppy I hadn't thought of that, that's a good idea to invest in a spare. Though I feel like as soon as the one from Chaka comes in, I'll never need the spare again

In theory they should ride exactly the same, the only difference being the ollin VESC is built to higher standards.

Ah okay, and even then, the lower quality isn't so bad since my Ollin VESC will be the daily driver once I get it.

[/quote]

Well not 100% true since Ollin's are 4.12 and Maytch are 4.10 so some possible differences when riding)

maytech's are 4.12, and anyway they're functionally the same.  The only difference between 4.12 and 4.10 is a thickened trace and bigger caps (basically reliability stuff)

People should forget the maytech exists unless they drop to like $60, since you have to add missing components.

Many are missing atleast c37/c51 and few others
@Scoo_B_SK8 & @darkkevind can testify to that ðŸ˜‰
I've personally held 3 that were missing c37/c51
