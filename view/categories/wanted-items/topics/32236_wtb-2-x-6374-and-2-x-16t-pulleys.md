Hey I got (2) APS 6374 -- That I just received yesterday.... never fired up once. I lose $28 if I send them back for shipping costs.

Let me know a fair price if you want them.  

These are the motors (it has a keyway, I dont know what a 3x3 keyway is):

why not just get them from DIY? you're not going to save a whole lot buying used. These parts don't depreciate much.
