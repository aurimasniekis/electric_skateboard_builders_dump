I have one :) It is vanda VESC with replaced DRV, after replacement the VESC died again, but not by a DRV failure...it was caused by some resistor from the other side of the PCB...are you interested?

If @stormboard1 isn’t interested I am. For the right price ofcourse :wink:

Edit: might have misunderstood, maybe you weren’t selling.
