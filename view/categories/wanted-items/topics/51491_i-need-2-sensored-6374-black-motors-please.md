I'm using some evolve trucks and ordered the motor mounts from UNiK.. I originally ordered the torqeboard 6374 190kv motors but I think the shaft pins might be way to long.. so I have to return them.. does anyone have any motors that would work with the motor mounts unik sales? I see they have some motors that I think would work but they are 150kv and was thinking it was best to stay with a 190kv with the 10s5p battery back.. not 100% sure of this either.. still super new to all this.. im waiting on them to email me back but in the mean time I figured id check here..  also need the motor pulleys to go with the evolve 7inch wheel pulleys..

Thanks guys/gals!

You could always cut the shafts if they were too long?
Where are you based? That might narrow it down if you still need motors.

I’m in the US Milwaukee WI. Yeah that thought crossed my mind but I literally don’t have many tools to do all that and didn’t want to damage anything.. was just hopeing to buy something that I wouldn’t have to cut and would work, thanks for your response
