BMS included and packaged to fit in an eboosted evo [enclosure](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/landyachtz-evo-falcon-enclosure/)

I ordered a battery and motor from psychotiller but with no response for over 6 weeks now. I'm getting pretty impatient and would like one within the next few weeks if possible.

I see you're sorted, but I'm a pack builder in GA if you need anything.
