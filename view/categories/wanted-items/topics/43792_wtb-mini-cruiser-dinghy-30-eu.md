Hey guys, 

Been inactive for a long time after finishing my build. I lost the thrill for esk8ing and kind of regret not going for a more portable build as I'm not using my icarus so often. 

For my next and final build I'd like to do a mini cruiser. So lets start with a deck. Looking for less than 30" and preferably with a kicktail. Will also be looking for trucks, motors and mounts.

The Plan is to build a light travel board, no high power, or high speed. Integrated electronics (Board with Cutout + 3D Printed Core + Carbon Fibre bottom layer). As light and sleek as possible. 

Battery pack has to be replaceable and sub 100Wh (because of airtravel).

I also plan to make it a push-assist only board (Ackmaniack software). That way I can go with a single small hubmotor, no need for big torque. 

I ordered some parts already, but I should wait till the end of my UNI-Exams :D... 

I’ll maybe create a build thread in the future... 

Looking forward to your build too :)

trucks, motors and mounts.

I am organising a group buy which will be including Landyachtz Dingy Emboss but it is on hold till mid march due to lack of stock. I'm guessing you will want to be riding your board by then though.

I have trucks, motors and mounts in stock at [street-wing.com](http://street-wing.com) , everything is stocked and dispatched from the UK.

Is that the deck that's like the plastic penny boards?

Thanks for the input guys :) The spud is not for me since it has no kicktail. If anyone has a used Dinghy that'd be awesome ! 
@DavidBanner I don't think I can wait that long :sweat_smile:
