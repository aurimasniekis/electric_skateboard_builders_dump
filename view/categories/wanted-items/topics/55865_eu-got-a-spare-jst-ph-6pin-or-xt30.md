Does anyone have a single jst PH connector that I can use to connect sensor wires to my Focbox? I could also use a single male XT30 [IMG]https://redbee.de/media/image/product/2202/md/redbee-xt30-plug-male.jpg[/img]

I'd order them from a shop but with individual items shipping is usually a killer and I don't need a bag of each with like 10 of them.

If you have one lying around that can you put in a letter envelope that would help me out. Thanks!

Yeah Germany. If you have one and are willing to send it to me that would be great. @L3chef you are from UK right? Inner-country is probably easier than international. Thank you both for the help!
