It better be ready by the first of 2019 at the latest.  When I purchased it they said End of September or maybe beginning of October.  Sitting on our money for 3 months or more is poor planning on their part.  I'm not interested in financing anyone's business for that long.

Ouh we went a bit off topic. But he didn't mean the unity.. That should be ready in nowember was it?
But just a headsup. Last year they sold focboxes that was "ready to ship"(nowember 2017) in second quarter of this year.
Personally I think they will get the units out in time this year..

.... I had not even thought of this issue.... could hook it up to a transistor. As soon as the Unity turns on the 5V or 3.3V pins would turn on and you could solder that to a transistor which turns on the voltage meter.

Im not sure how to set up a list on the site as I'm very dumb founded by computers. And I'm still very new here.
But I think you could just right down the fourm Nick name and how many units they want in order untill you reach your limit and then just post our names up when you have completed your count and then when they arrive you can call us out on them over pm to set up payments and shipping..I think this should work

i need some input.

packaging is taking place for the unitys, looks real nice:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/focbox-unity-official/64944/889

but...the box appears to be pretty large, this is going to make shipping a bit more difficult.

question is, do you want the unity boxes put inside another box for shipping?  that way the original packaging is left intact.  this option will increase overall shipping + packing cost.

or, can i just use the unity box to ship?  so the shipping label would just get slapped on the original box, which would ruin the packaging but the contents inside should be nice and protected.  i'll wrap things tightly with shipping tape, of course.

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=2 public=true]
* Use another box for shipping ($12 or so for shipping, may add to lead time)
* Use the unity box for shipping ($6 or so for shipping)

The Unity box is nice but the shipping cost is also important. As long as the Unity is intact and fully functional when it gets to my hands I guess I‚Äôd favor shipping cost.

@Indiangummy
You just have to add 1 year platinum warranty in the cart, put comment that it's from the group buy and also add the order ID if you got any from group id, include your Unity Serial number (if you see any)
It will automatically get linked.
Your Warranty order ID can be used to claim at Enertion support if you face any issues with Unity

Note: We do not support DIY,

Guy's I had some significant issues to deal with and well I am back but still working to resolve.  Please let me know anyone that was shorted on group buy to my knowledge one individual from CAN and one form Iceland am I missing anyone?  Not making excuses trying to make it right.  I have a number of Unity controls in a box from the factory just need to confirm there is still a desire to receive given the unforeseen delay on a couple of international shipments. If you would like a full refund for Can and Iceland will process immediately and understand. I believe all domestic shipments have been fulfilled.

Besides the two who already paid it looks like there is still an interest from most other guys on your list to get the unity.
They just waiting on a pm from you how to proceed further.
If you have a free minute, just let the people on your list know. If you want we also can make a poll for you and find out who is still interested and swap out people who not interested anymore to people who would like to get there place.

I bought from him and got mine quickly after he received the group buy.  Seems like if he was trying to do a scam this wouldn't be the way to go about it.  I will say he probably shouldn't organize a future group buy if he knows he will be unavailable within the next 4-5 months, but I he isn't dishonest.
