I have zombie wheels and its not so easy to center the sprocket with everything improvised so Im looking if someone could print out something like this for me with the dimensions I need
I dont know much about modelling in cad but I think it shouldnt be hard

For some reason I cant post a link from my phone..
Anyways need the thing wich goes thu the wheel and the sprocket attaches to it

how many holes do those have? there are those pulleys for flywheels that have four holes, if the zombies have  amultiple of four holes i bet you could get it to work.

if you do a detailed hand drawing with dimensions then we'd have something to work with.
