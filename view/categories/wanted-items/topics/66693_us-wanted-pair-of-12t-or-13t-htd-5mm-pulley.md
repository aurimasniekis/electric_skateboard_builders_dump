Preferrably for a 15mm Belt, but I'd be willing to go down to 12mm belt.

I've got a couple 11t for 15mm belts I'm never going to use. You can have them for shipping cost ![IMG_9575|375x500](upload://5MINYOMh4pFqsafc0S07gtjorsx.JPG)

Sending now.   


If anyone else has any pulley's they are looking to get rid of I'll definitley buy those too, I'm not 100% sure what is going to work best so I'd like to experiment :slight_smile:
