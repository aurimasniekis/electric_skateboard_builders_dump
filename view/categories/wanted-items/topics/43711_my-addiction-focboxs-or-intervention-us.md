I now have 3 boards on the bench in different states of completion. Plus, because @treenutter will apperantly take advantage of a junkies habit, I have another deck coming ‚ò∫Ô∏è. 

So, if anyone has a couple of spare Focbox's I'm looking.  Thanks

Dude, wouldn't that be the life :slight_smile:.  I have 2 TB VESC's Im going to use on a pretty normal build with caliber II trucks and 97mm flywheels on 10s.  I have 2 FocBox's allready installed on my high-speed board using TB218 trucks and 80mm kegels running on 12s.  I have MTB hybrid Im working on, essentially transplanting the mechanicals toan Arbor High-Ground that I need VESC's for.  SO yeah, too much going on :slight_smile:.
