After looking around for a bit, I decided on what type of pack I'd like, but I dont have a spot welder and dont want to potentially mess up expense batteries.

Does anyone know someone in Canada/toronto that would be able to fabricate one? ideally using Samsung 30q's

I'm east of the six and would love to know too. I soldered my last a123 pack but it wasn't easy. If you can figure out this website. 
www.reship.com then you can get a battery here from the USA. I contacted them already and they said they could ship to canada.

In that case I would speak to barajabali about a battery. The onus of shipping across the border is on you though. You would need to provide him the address to ship it to reship... It can work.

Good luck.
