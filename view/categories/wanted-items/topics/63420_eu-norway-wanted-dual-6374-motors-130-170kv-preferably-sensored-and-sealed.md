Subjective question but I think so... I look at specs n such but at any rate I had one motor I got off a seller from eBay and needed is matching twin and the only way was to contact them and they fulfilled my order quickly and how I needed it. =)

@mynamesmatt Yeah, but it ships only from international warehouse, that will take way to long time to get them
