Thats going to be hard to grab right now....even the people who have raptor 2s are having a hard time getting the hubs!

Do they have to be raptor hubs or just hubs in general?

Maybe try and find someone selling a set of @Hummie's hubs?

I like raptor hubs because they poweful af. I have pretty powerfull setup. 
I like them because they can switch between the 2 kinds of wheels. I like that.. I already cnc'd such sqaure to accept a hub motor :) 
I made them from evolve trucks:) 
But hummie hubs, i dont know anything about them.. are those powerfull? Also switchable wheels?? 
Sorry. My english is my worst subject...

Be warned, its a long thread! Alot of thought and care went into making those motors! Alot of community support and input went into the final design as well!

I didn't get a chance to buy a set but from everyone I've read about, they all really like them.
I'm pretty sure you can change the wheel out alot more freely than on the raptor with these.

Not sure you want the R2 hubs as they are now. They have some issues. I've went through 4 pairs of them so far. None lasted longer than 180 miles. Newest set only lasted 80 miles. Still waiting for some replacements myself. You might be better off looking for hummies hubs at the moment.

Overheating issues, bearing issues, QC issues. Hopefully their new design works better. But those will be impossible to get.

Yea they just had a redesign on their motors, they were running into a few issues from changing their manufacture.

They have re-vamped their QC so I'm hoping it does well for them.

But they are useless now?? Or are the hubs driveable?? 
Because The hubs maybe will only overheat when you put insane high A trough it...
And bearing. Makes some noice??

Nah you need good bearings or your motors will end jammed one day while you're riding!

They're useless now. Windings are screwed.  Bearings bend every time new ones are installed. Stator maybe crooked or the motor can. Not sure. I don't think 30A batt amps and 60A motor amps is crazy at all.

Get the @Hummieâ€™s ones. They seems well tested and powerful. Check theirs size. You might be lucky to fit others PU. I did fit both raptors and mellow PU on my INboard hubs.

These are the famous R2 hubs everybody talks about? The best board ever in the history of the universe? Really? :roll_eyes:

They require some adjustments, mellow's 2mm of gorilla tape, raptor's ~4.

Man if you want I still have one set to come and I can add another one for you. They are the MAD hubs, basically the TB hubs but the new version. I made a review and comparison. They are strong and the price is half than the retailer one. Check the thread for review ecc...all linked in the first post https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/review-and-eu-usa-group-buy-90mm-mad-hub-motors-75kv-or-130kv-dual-170-euro-1st-round-closed/62002?u=rey8801
