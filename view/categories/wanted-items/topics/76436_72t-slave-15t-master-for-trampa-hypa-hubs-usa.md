Yeah. I had a brief chat with him. He's not stateside unfortunately. I like the look of his work for sure.

I think i could sell mine but i‚Äòm In russia, so shipping wouldn‚Äôt make it work well.
What if you order from trampa directly?
Is shipping expensive too?

Do you mind to 3D print your own?
I could have a look on the weekend and design a pulley for 72th and sent you the stl files than.

If push comes to shove I will order from Trampa or Idea. I figured I'd see if there are people that are stateside  partly because of shipping (I've spent something in the realm of 200$ in shipping so far). and partly to see if there are pulleys immediately available.

I found a file on here for a 72t pulley for 3d print for the hypa hubs (Wish I could remember where it was to give a shout out) but I don't have access to a 3d printer that can do nylon.

i print mine in PETG and they last for 500-1000km depends on how you drive for sure.
or  3D Hubs, like @Lumaci said is also a way for it.

You can ask @marcmt88 he can probably make some pulleys for the hubs you have. Sorry I don‚Äôt know trampa‚Äôs lineup so well I thought you could use the same pulleys for their other hubs. Marc‚Äôs pulley could probably be POM tho.

My pulleys on my EMTB are printed with PLA.  I have +700 miles on them.  Holding up great.  My hubs are MBS five star

You can try the evolve gen 2 kit. Ships from CA. I had to slightly modify the pulley to work for my build with MBS rockstar 2 Hubs.

Good looking out. Cheers. I'm not sure if I would be able to mod those very well for a 6 hole hub.

```
For my build, I completely removed the back side of the pulley ( the long ends that stick out ) you can see in the picture above. I was left with teeth on one side and a completely flat back. The pre drilled holes match up to my hubs, but if you drilled a new 6 hole pattern, they would work. You might have to use some spacers between the hub and pulley to get alignment right but as for a cheap US option, it worked for me. Now my next build, I‚Äôm doing away with belts altogether and going with an etoxx drive. Anyway, that‚Äôs my future plans. Good luck with whichever choice you make!

Thanks for the input! Etoxx's drives look awesome. This is my first build so I'm doing my best to keep it under $2200.

Yeah I agree, Etoxx is pretty expensive, but from one experienced builder to another it always is cheaper to do it right the first time! But I digress, as I too started out with thoughts that I could build something that was ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù from the price aspect. But as many of us here would agree, this stuff has a way of taking you down a deep hole of expense and SATISFACTION! I‚Äôd like to think sometimes I‚Äôd be quite comfortable if I didn‚Äôt have this passion in my blood. But then I remember how sic it is to not only carve downhill, but uphill too, on streets, off-road, and at death defying speeds that only another esk8er could understand why. Lol ü§òüèº

I have yet to get on one of these guys but my bike was recently stolen from me and I'd been eyeing mountainboards for some time so it seemed like the appropriate time to try building one out. I had no idea what I bit off when I first started into this a couple of months ago but this forum has been an awesome resource.

Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it! It is quite a lot sometimes and some of these guys in here are brilliant and others are legends in this sport (can I call it a sport?) sorry to hear about your bike, that‚Äôs lame, but now you‚Äôve entered a happy place. Nothing like building something yourself that can also give you an adrenaline rush.

I'm half expecting to immediately break an arm on this thing so I've aptly named the board Kamikaze.

I like where your head is at! üòÇ it‚Äôs funny you say that because when I built my first board, I immediately broke ribs. Then I waited a few weeks to ride again, basically when I kinda felt better, and I went down again, which actually gave me a nice trip to the hospitol, found out I had only a few broken ribs and some awesome bruising. To say the least, TAKE IT EASY.

Yeah it is, but I have the rockstar 2 hubs and it‚Äôs different than that too, but in one of my threads above I explain exactly how to modify it to make it work. C‚Äômon man ü§™

Thanks for the information. I look forward to reading them.

I don‚Äôt have rockstar/hypa hubs.

I did have a chat with the creator of those and I got the impression he was willing to do the hypa hubs as well. I think these are new offerings from him.
