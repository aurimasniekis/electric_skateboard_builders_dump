It‚Äôs A closed fb group (ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD BUY and Sell USA). Your better off messaging him the name I gave you. It takes forever to get approved to enter the group.

Thanks for that! although after a good amount of time reading about pros cons of direct drive over satellite configurations(and even getting abit into some theory which made my head spin) I decided to go gear drive :laughing:

While I still like direct drive I wanted to go with something that could go uphills well and use pneumatics(without going 4wd)

Maybe you'd be interested in picking these up? :wink:

I‚Äôll tag you in it if I go through with the plan, I‚Äôve got to do some more research on the trucks first through, custom or tb218‚Äôs? I can‚Äôt decide because that also defines the size of the motor

I do feel like custom would allow more freedom but be more costly as many others have done so like @torqueboards @fliess. Actually come to think about it, since @torqueboards is building custom trucks(though I believe its slightly modified) for direct drive, maybe you could do find something to work on around those lines?

Yeah I‚Äôve seen a photo of it but no word if they‚Äôll be sold separately. Its got some heat sink fins towards the center with a over all slimmer hangar where the drives sit presumably. Would be nice for them to offer the trucks stand alone :smile:
