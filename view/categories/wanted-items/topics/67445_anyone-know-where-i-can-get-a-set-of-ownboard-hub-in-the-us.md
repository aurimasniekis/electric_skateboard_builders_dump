Im in NY USA and im trying to get a set of ownboard hubs for an upcoming build im doing. Anyone have any leads? Im not trying to pay a $50 shipping fee for hubs and the truck they work with... only to wait the standard Chinese shipping time :laughing: 

@PredatorBoards I think maybe you might have some? :D
