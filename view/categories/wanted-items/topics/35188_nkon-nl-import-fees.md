Try asking them since they show the price on their website as "VAT included" This however only means that the customs office can not charge you the VAT import fees might still apply depending on laws in your country as far as I know. When I ordered 30*30Q it way above the price after which you pay import fees (100â‚¬) in Slovakia and they did not charge me anything at the customs office.

Mine have always shipped from the Netherlands and I've never paid any import fees at all. I'm in the UK. Where are you based?

Exactly as overint has said. They have 2 sites, each aimed at either VAT based countries and non-VAT based countries.

I've ordered from Europe several times through ebay and an independent company. VAT is not charge for international shipments. That being said customs importation cost varies by country. I did not have to pay customs duties for the times I ordered from Europe. I live in the United States for reference.
