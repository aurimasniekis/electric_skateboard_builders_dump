$25 plus actual shipping cost.  Same price as china clones but real & authentic ABEC11, pre-enjoyed.  The wheels that had drive pulleys are the two on the left in the second photo.  These wheels are definitely rough-looking but work just fine.  The only reason they are not in-use is because I switched to 107mm.

97mm ABEC11 Flywheels, green, 75a
