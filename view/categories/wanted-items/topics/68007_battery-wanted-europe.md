Hi, I wanted to buy a "cheap" battery for my build. I ordered a meepo one but after waiting more than a month I had to claim with paypal because the tracking still shows nothing and they don't answer.

If someone has a meepo or similar battery for a budget build, I would love it. It must be in Europe (JUST EUROPE).

Many have spare batteries but you didn't give any information beyond that. Lipo liion li4po? Wh, voltage etc?

And cheap and battery doesn't go well hand in hand. How many â‚¬ have you planed to put on the battery?

Depends on the battery, but  as cheap as possible for a battery that is decent (40 amps or so discharge), like a 10s2p with 30q
