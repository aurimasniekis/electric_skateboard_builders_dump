Buy this and just get a 16t pulley off ebay for a few dollars. You cant beat the price of this set. It even includes so decent belts

I'm in Australia, so shipping might be a prick, but these are $65AUD per set plus shipping.

EDIT: They're 15T/36T 15mm

Can you give me any idea on shipping cost? I know jimmyho if it'll fit in a padded envelope does $5 for epacket from China. But I dont know how much costs he's eating on it.... If it's not outrageous I'd be all over that set. 

Also would 320mm belt be available? That's what I use on my rig

Thanks

Edit: Are you needing just 1 set for single drive or two sets for dual?

This is my last set of 320mm, my man!

PM me your address and I'll get a shipping cost for you.

PayPal is totally fine.
