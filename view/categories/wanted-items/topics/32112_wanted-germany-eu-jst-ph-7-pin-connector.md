hey,
i am looking for a jst-ph 7 pin female connector.

 it's pretty much the last piece of the puzzle of my first board, hence i don't want to order one from china and have to wait so long until it arrives. there are a few websites here in germany where i could get this connector, however it goes against my principles to buy a thing worth 10ct and pay 50 times the value for shipping :joy:

so does anyone have on to spare?
thanks a lot!

sorry, didn't know that there are different versions. i need the one which fits the vesc's uart port which should be the one with a 2.0mm pitch.

For sure, can send you one if you pay shipping costs, I'm based in austria so shipping should be ridicolously cheap.
