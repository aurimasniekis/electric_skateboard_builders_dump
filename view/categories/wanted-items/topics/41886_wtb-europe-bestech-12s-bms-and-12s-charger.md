Hi! Does anyone in Europe have a Bestech 12s BMS and 12s charger?

If not, would somebody be interested in buying a pair of Bestech 12s BMS´s and splitting the cost? I live in Sweden.

Woah 90£? I think I can get 2 BMS´s directly from Bestech for that price. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/a/baa00d09532230a21396558f37cab2348be0ba16.png" width="690" height="278">

It's the VAT killing the price for you, if you are in the EU I have to charge it. Without it's £75.

Don't forget you will also pay VAT, customs and a handling fee on top of the factory price.

Well shit, did not think about that...
Anyway, 90£ is just too much for me. What other options do I have?

Is bypassing a BMS for charging only a good alternative?

For sure, especially if your pack is capable of more than 80A.

Up to 80A I use the BestTech BMS especially as it has the e-switch so no need for a anti-spark, past that charge only BMS plus a fuse and anti-spark switch(es)

I will be using 4x 3s 8000mAh 30c lipos in series, so my pack will be able to handle about 240A.
I´ll read a bit more on bypassing BMS for charging! Just a quick question, how is the fuse implemented in the curcuit?

Bypass for discharge no? (Charge only BMS)

sounds like you really should use a charge only BMS or you will be throttling otherwise available amps.

the fuse goes inline on the positive wire from the battery pack

Ok, thanks for the help! 

Im currently doing a curcuit for the d140 12s BMS with my lipos. 

Is the schematic correct?

Based on the schematic @thisguyhere gave me: [Bypassed BMS](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/us-bestech-charge-only-bms-modules-25-or-so-shipped/37797/259?u=teslaalex)

@Silas_Diy sent you message in inbox, I have bestech bms for sale. And I am in EU. 

Otherwise, you can order them from bestech website. You have to buy at least two of the same model, shipping is expensive and waiting time is around 3 weeks.
