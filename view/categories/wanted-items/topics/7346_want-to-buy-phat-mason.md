He will definitely reply, give him 24 hrs.  I've always gotten a response within 24 hrs.  Check his instagram, he posts more there.

lol this is how far i've come in the past year. It says a lot when people post on forums that they can't contact you. 

to close the loop, i have responded by email. And photorph is right, i do need about 24 hours. Toddler, full time plus what amounts to two part time jobs, family time, time for ritualistic sacrifices to Lord Skatan.. ... blah blah blah. Usually i respond immediately though. Or at least as soon as i possibly can.
