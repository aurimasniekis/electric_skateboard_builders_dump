My APS 6364 seems to have died, the 3 phase wires are shorting somewhere within the can occasionally on acceleration. So I've ordered a new motor off HobbyKing, but I've just realised I need a 8mm bore pulley for the new motor. 

Anyone in UK got one spare I can take off their hands? Need it by Friday preferably so I can make it to Critical Mass London.

Postage might be a bitch though if you need it sharpish. Special delivery is ¬£7.25 I think
