Hi guys! Looking for 90mm black Flywheels or similar duro. It has to ride really nice. I have to stick to ABEC core for the moment. I would like the same popoca riding feeling. If you have a new or used 90mm black abec flywheels set let me know! Thanks

Thanks, I know that deal, It is a possibility, but I would prefer real abec flywheels. I have tried quite some clones, also the high rebound ones from eskating.eu but still far from popoca feeling.
