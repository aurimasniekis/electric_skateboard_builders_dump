What size connectors do you have on your VESC? What size motor do you want? 50mm or 63mm?

Ethier 50mm or 63mm bht I would like to keep it around $50 and I think the bullet connectors are 5.5mm it is what ever comes standard with the @torqueboards vesc.

Ok. I have 270kv 50mm motors with 4mm bullets, but they are new  and more expensive.

Honestly, invest the extra $10, you won't regret it!! I'm not an expert but a used motor could have issues and if you buy knew you could sell for more than used)

If you are really on that big of a budget, go with this https://m.ru.aliexpress.com/s/item/32792436718.html?spm=a2g0n.search-cache.0.0.2e3c1faahSbx9w but I can not recommend it since I did not try it!

I decided to go with a 280kv motor sk3 turningy the kv is a little high but I am fine with it it is for a small budget board to be portable and does not need to be powerful my main board foes 31mph and I have all the power I want in that. It cost 56 plus shipping and is 50mm
