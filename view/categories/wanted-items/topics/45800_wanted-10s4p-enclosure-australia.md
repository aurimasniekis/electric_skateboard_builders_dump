Hey everyone.
I'm looking for a 10s4p enclosure (w/ space for 2 focboxes) in australia, as everything from overseas ends up being insanity in terms of pricing + shipping around the world.

Drop me a PM, used or new :slight_smile:

Hello!

As promised, new enclosures ready for production! 

Sorry for the delay. I know some of you have been waiting since @overint 's post. 

A lot goes into making these enclosures. They're expensive by nature. But I've taken on board your feedback to keep prices low.

Again, I must stress that these are handmade custom parts, made in Australia. They're not cheap and they're definitely not made in China, Vietnam, India, etc. 

Each stage has taken days and weeks to design and build with many repetitive and time consuming tasks that require much fuss and patience: First cutting out moulds, trimming them, sanding over and over again until smooth, polishing and applying layers of wax and mould release agent, then finally laying the carbon (or fibreglass), supervising and waiting hours for it to set under the vacuum pressure making sure it's all perfect, then pulling it out of the vacuum bag and mould the following day to do more trimming, sanding, and polishing, before applying a finishing and protective clear coat. And that's just for one enclosure!

**This first enclosure** is _simple_, _light_, and _strong_. Just drill some holes, and screw, or bolt on and you're set. Ideally you'd add a gasket made from something like _neoprene_, _silicone_, or _rubber_ to seal the edges and act as a a dampener. OR, if you're really tight, you could run a bead of _caulk_ around the edge. **This will cover your battery and electrics. Quick and easy.**

The downside is that the design has _very little flex_, so not ideal for flex boards. It will work for any deck, but it's not the best solution if you're interested in flex.

The shape itself also has inherent weak points as a _long one-piece enclosure_. For instance, it's a bit _vulnerable to penetrating force_ at the centre of the belly where it's most vulnerable, and it's _vulnerable to flexion_ at rigid the edges which will bend as 'pump' the middle of the deck while riding.

The enclosure does, however, **_twist_** and _**has torsional strength**_ and can withstand compression and won't easily be crushed if you run into a wall, etc. So **it's strong stuff overall** and won't break anytime soon (deep water boats are made out fibreglass).

![Double Stack Battery Enclosure - Satin Black Fibreglass|690x388](upload://lUpZZ0yhPS3sD2kW2Cf2pGxqcIp.jpg)
**Internal dimensions:** 
526 x 162 x 40mm deep (will be 43mm with a neoprene gasket)
20.7 x 6.4 x 1.6"
**External dimensions (overall):** 
584 x 220mm
23" x 8.7"

![Vacuum Bagging 2|690x388](upload://wViUMFoiICmvjbxSOHZNmK1otBj.jpg)
 
Vacuum bagging process: Surplus resin bleeding into the breather fabric makes the part as thin and light as possible. (Surplus resin is brittle and heavy like toffee).

**Tail Light:** _Low-profile_. _Waterproof_. _Super bright_ and _slim_. Wire routes from the centre and runs under the trucks to the enclosure. Coated in a glossy black epoxy. Mount with hot glue, or similar. Powers via. a voltage step-down regulator (not included, ~$5) which lowers the voltage to sends ~12v to the lights, instead of whatever high voltage your battery has (e.g. 25v), so the lights don't burst and burn.

_**$30 each**_. Comes with long wires.
+ +$5 for each extra light
+ +$5 for plugs: Bullet, XT90, XT60, etc.

**FREE POSTAGE AUSTRALIA-WIDE**
**$10 SHIPPING WORLDWIDE**

**Payment:** PM me for details.

**The Modular Flex Enclosure** is designed for _maximum flex_, allowing more flex than a bamboo board! Also, as an expandable system of modules (each housing a 2s4p), it allows an _unlimited number of batteries_ to be wired together!

![Modular Flex Enclosure  - Design|690x388](upload://pdTHu0JQBjQKNbaYnqvPx5fkZq1.jpg)

![Diagram___ Overlapping tongue in groove|597x196](upload://h4FLD9ZSP37TzJVxsiigN4kHfxm.jpg)
(Overlapping tongue-in-groove joint in wood, for reference)

Having modelled it after an _armadillo shell_ I immediately thought of the back protector I use for supersport motorcycling -- A 'Manis D1' back protector by Italian company _Dainese_ , world-class innovators with research backed by an Italian university. While other enclosures are like turtle shells, creatures like the _armadillo_, _centipede_, _millipede_, and _lobster_, have shells / exoskeletons that protect the internal organs while moving with the creature. 

![Diagram___ Dainese Manis D1 (1000)|448x500](upload://hcfYVglX2sj11q0HtCazCyBR5W0.jpg)

Following the same design principle, each module links together using overlapping _tongue-in-groove_ joints sealed with neoprene tape (for insulation and dampening). This allows _freedom of movement_ on the _outside_ in each of the series of modules  AND ALSO on the _inside_ as **each 2s4p cell (and its wiring connections) move freely _with_ the board** not against it. 

![Demo___ Modular Battery Enclosure 1|690x388](upload://5HSdEtIvfxXS82XAtfSFgg0roWO.jpg)

![Demo___ Modular Battery Enclosure 2 (greyscale)|690x388](upload://fQ2tXb4c5oipDxUElbBRAP0rpke.jpg)

![Demo___ Modular Battery Enclosure 3 (greyscale)|690x388](upload://kkmTVo7tcpSxt2OkDbubVHtVihF.jpg)

This enclosure system is the antithesis of what would typically be a **long and rigid _one-piece_ enclosures** not designed to bend repeatedly. Such enclosures incur **stress at the joints** and are prone to cracking as the board flexes. -- Think of all those _**bumps in the road**_, **_jumps_**, **_landings_**, _**cracks in the pavement**_, _**popping up curbs**_, _**jumping off curbs and stairs**_, _**power slides**_..., **_pumping_** and **_carving_**...

When designing this, I noticed this design flaw in other enclosures that developed cracks, even the bigger names  -- I won't name names --  obviously due to limited / inadequate flexibility on a flexible deck. It's a mismatch. Stress inevitably builds up over time and cracks form, compromising all the electrics. By then, you'd need a new enclosure, and possibly new electrics.

As this design allows _maximum flex_ it prevents cracks from forming in the first place, ensuring protection of your electrical components. In turn, preventing external debris like _water_, _dust_, _dirt_, _snow_, _mud_, etc, and from entering AND also protect the battery pack itself from experiencing cracks in cells / cell joints and prevent the risk of cracked and disconnected wires / nickel strips, etc, which will definitely prevent risk of a short circuit in your expensive equipment!

This enclosure is quite idyllic if you're looking for maximum flex, as it will last much much longer than others, AND it's _scalable_ ready for whenever you upgrade / upsize the battery! 


The modular enclosure allows board design to be flexible. The board can be extra-short, short, medium, long, or extra-long, all using the same enclosure system! -- It can be _ideal for a short board build_ , portable for commuting, etc. E.g. 4 modules for a 8s4p. 

It's a one system solution for all.  _Both_ those with a specific board and battery size in mind, AND those who are unspecific, or uncertain, but they know they are open to upgrading to a bigger battery in future. 

The downside, depending on how you see it, is that this enclosure requires a _custom battery pack_ with wires linking each 2s4p pack inside each module (~1" / 25mm of wire per connection). In other words, the enclosure won't readily suit any pre-made battery packs on the market without modification. It will have to be custom made, OR you can cut up a battery pack into smaller 2s4p packs and re-connect them together!

**Wiring:** The wires connecting each module (and 2s4p) have to be routed, either:
1) _Through the enclosure_ via. a hole (see _rubber grommet_ on the Blue Kevlar Carbon), or
2) _Under the enclosure (in deck)_ by routing or chiselling some material out of the deck. OR,
3) _Under the enclosure (above deck)_ by having a thicker 5mm neoprene gasket, allowing wires to sandwich between the deck and the enclosure.

**_Method 1_** will expose the wires and there would be risk of wires snagging whilst riding. 
_**Method 2**_ keeps wires hidden inside and protected. :+1:

![Modular Battery Enclosure - Gloss Black Carbon|690x388](upload://sJQAhgAdLxgILcKeXZ4z152NYEt.jpg)
Fibreglass reinforced.
**Weight:** ~35g / 1.23 oz. 
Super light, very stiff, hard, and strong. Has some twist. 


![Modular Battery Enclosure - Blue Kevlar Carbon|690x388](upload://ju5tfvb04s01rz71ucJj7lUMC3D.jpg)
Fibreglass reinforced.
**Weight:** ~33g / 1.16 oz.
Super light, very hard and strong, actually a bit stiffer when attempting to twist it, but it has more flex in theory (like a nylon bag) as the kevlar can absorb a puncture impact better than carbon would shatter. It also has abrasion resistance while carbon would disintegrate a bit quicker. 

**Specifications**:

**External dimensions (overall):** 
190 x 125mm
7.5 x 5"

**Measurement of tongue overlap (as pictured):**
~20mm 
0.8"

i.e. **2 connected modules are 360mm long (14.2").** 
In numbers: [(190mm x 2) - 20mm] = 360mm. 

**Total length of enclosures using a 20mm tongue overlap:**
4 modules = 700mm (27.6")
5 modules = 870mm (34.2")
6 modules = 1040mm (40.9")
7 modules = 1210mm (47.6")
8 modules = 1380mm (54.3")

The amount of overlap is personal preference. To achieve more flex (than pictured), you can space the modules further apart and have ~5mm (0.2") overlap. **2 connected modules would then be 375mm long (14.8")**. 

****Total length of enclosures using a 5mm tongue overlap:**
4 modules = 745mm (29.3")
5 modules = 930mm (36.6")
6 modules = 1115mm (43.9")
7 modules = 1300mm (51.2")
8 modules = 1485mm (58.5")

**Regular price (non-discounted):** This covers the _basic material costs_ and _labour and production time (at the _minimum Australian award rate_)_, and the plethora of immeasurable small inputs that form the bulk of the price and the overall complexity and difficulty. These amounts allow me enough to produce a sweet product for your enjoyment. 

On the accounting side:
+ **Fixed costs** are FREE. Rent and electricity are unaccounted for.
+ **Sunk costs** are FREE and have been unaccounted for. All the little tools, nic-nacs, trials and errors, etc, have not been counted. 
+ **Plug & mould making** is _**FREE**_, unaccounted for.
+ **Design fee** is _**FREE**_, unaccounted for, which is a risk.
+ **My opportunity cost** is also _**FREE**_.
+ **The gross profit-margin is _near minimal_**, less than a typical retail shop that sells ordinary items, like _very boring shoes_. Whereas _custom handmade premium products_ traditionally command very high margins, upwards of $1,000-3,000 per item, IF are you are offered the opportunity to buy. -- Sellers on this forum have seriously underpriced their products and are very likely selling at a serious loss. They may even be oblivious to their losses until they finally get around to tallying it all up.

[Note: Each part is made with attention to detail and care with no expense  spared. These are not carelessly mass manufactured products produced under miserable slave labour / sweat shop conditions in China, India, South America, or any with 3rd world conditions. Not that there's anything wrong with that, apart from... _health & safety_ issues, _hygene & sanitation_ issues, _class inequality_ issues, _child and female exploitation_ issues, with human trafficking, etc. They're also not made in underdeveloped and impoverished parts of Europe like Poland, Eastern Europe, or from gulags in Soviet Russia, or in any illegal or unethical manner. Everything is done above board.

**The point is this: '_These are quality specialty parts. You get what you pay for._'** Each order is fastidiously _quality checked_ before shipping, _cleaned_,  _sanitised_, _wrapped_ and _packaged_ securely in the best packaging available, ... ready for a long and safe journey by plane to your door... :slightly_smiling_face:]


[_**EDIT - PRICE DROP**_. Having taken on board your feedback prices have been reduced a bit more. But that will be all for the first round of orders.]

![Pricing (AUD)|690x388](upload://cOINLmLVvSbB1BVZBOfS8yKk2DA.jpg)

E.g. 1) 

**A 12s4p 18650 li-ion battery pack** will require _6 modules_ to house the batter (i.e. 6 x 2s4p = 12s4p), _plus_ an additional module to house to house the VESCs / FOCBoxes. **7 enclosures in total, which comes to AU $277.00**

E.g. 2)

**A 10s4p 18650 li-ion battery pack** will require _5 modules to house the battery (i.e. 5 x 2s4p = 10s4p), _plus_ an additional module to house the VESCs / FOCBoxes. **6 enclosures in total. A total price of AU $237.43**

Hi solideogloria,
Really interested in an enclosure. My board is convex so I'd need an enclosure that could wrap around the board rather than being flat - could this be done? 
This is my first post so can't dm yet, please message me directly for questions.

@Supertravio Absolutely! -- By 'convex' do you mean a deck in the shape of a parabola / smiley face? Or do you mean inverse parabola / sad face?

**Assuming parabola:** Fibreglass / carbon can actually be **BENT** with heat. So what you'd do in a domestic setting, would be to heat up a thick pan, like a cast iron skillet pan for steaks, or maybe a BBQ hot plate (something that holds heat once heated up). Then you'd take a module and press the tongue onto the hot plate. Once soft (10-30 secs) it will be **PLIABLE** like soft plastic. -- But heat it too long and the carbon layers may start to slowly de-laminate and split apart -- Anyway, in your case, you'd bend the tongue inwards and ideally clamp it to your board while it cools (in 1-2 mins). You could hold it with your fingers, too, or screw it down asap. There you have it! Repeat per enclosure and you'll have a _'convex enclosure that wraps around the board'!_

Or, did you mean, convex from the front view? Like this 
https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/images/help/skateboard-decks-concave-shape-convex.jpg 
-- Same principle applies, instead heating  the sides too.

Based on that image, it's concave rather than convex. 
Based on looking at it top down it's concave (smiley).
I get you though.
Have you got a website with your standard offerings? 
I tried taking a photo to show the curve but it really doesn't show.

@Supertravio

Concave / parabola / smiley: Yep, you'd heat and bend the sides inwards, following the profile of the deck.

Everything's on this thread for now. If you have a specific request, let me know and I'll see what I can do.
