One of my Meepo v1.5 motors decided to fold on me right before the esk8 season which means I need a new one. I am looking for a 90mm hub motor with a shaft. Preferably used, since I don't have too much to spare at the moment. 

This hub motor seems to be identical to the one I currently have:

If you have anything to offer, hit me up!
