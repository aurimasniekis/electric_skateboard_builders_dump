Hello, the title is pretty self explanatory, I need four items printed:

I need both the nose and tail riser printed :arrow_up:

I also need two of these printed :arrow_up:

I am a total 3D printing noob, what filament would be best for printing?

Edit: I am completely willing to pay for shipping and filament used, just name your price.

Located in Santa Clara CA (Bay Area)

Look on 3D hubs. They have sometimes good prices.
I would print the cover in petg.
The riser idk, maybe petg is enough but not sure.

Several California libraries have 3d printers to use!!!  Nothing like learning something new for cheap!
