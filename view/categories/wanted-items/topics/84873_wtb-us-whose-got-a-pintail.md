Does anyone have a pintail deck there willing to give up?  My friend is looking for one to convert, so if it has an enclosure that's preferable.  Located east coast US

I’ve have a pintail deck with wheel wells that I do custom artwork on. It’s 42” long and 10” wide. I could even deliver it the next time I come down to DE.

I have a hummie deck that's being finished next week and an mtb I finally finished this week. Just didn't have time to make a project out of it. I really love the look and frit.

Well I’m in central Jersey and I have all my family and friends down there in the Smyrna area. I usually come down every other month or so. How much is your friend looking to spend. As with the custom artwork the deck would be around $150.
