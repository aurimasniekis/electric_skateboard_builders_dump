Hey, i'm looking for a second charger with 4A at best. I need it pretty quickly because i'm in the netherlands on the 22nd of july and shipping from china takes longer.

It doesn't have to be fancy. A charger from YZPower for example will do.

I need it to charge my 10s4p Battery. My other 2 10s2p batteries will get charged with a standart 2A charger.

Shipping to Germany.
