Hey all,
I'm starting out my second build and have a 6374 motor from @JLabs but realized that it doesn't have a temp sensor on it like the old ones used to. I'm looking to buy a new 190kv sensored motor with a temp sensor in it. If anyone has one with a keyway, even better!

Also willing to trade my motor. 

Thanks!
