I'm looking for two 12mm motor pulleys with 8mm bore (for flipsky motors) I know torqueboards had them but they're a bit expensive at $15 

Any other options or anyone have some laying around? Thanks in advance

You can use 15mm wide pulleys with 9mm, 12mm, and 15mm belts. It‚Äôs all about alignment

Just being honest here if you don‚Äôt want to pay $15 for a motor pulley this might not be the hobby for you
