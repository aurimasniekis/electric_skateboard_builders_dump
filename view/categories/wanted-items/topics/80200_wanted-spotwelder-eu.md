I have one extra laying at home. If I buy coper welding pens. I can lend for a small price A spotwelder our. So that somebody can build is own pack. But I think shipping to somebody and shipping back is also expensive.

Yea I've always thought about making my own packs. Once you buy the spot welder you kind of have to build multiple packs to get value, and they're hard to find. Let me know what you come up with

About 100€ I think but should be solid enough for some good quality builds
