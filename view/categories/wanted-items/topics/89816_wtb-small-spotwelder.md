kWeld is going to break your lipos unless your going really slow
And if you are planning to build <5 packs just get the boss level

I have yet to test long term durability, but imo the MinispotA is great, especially if you really want *small*. Its basically a marker sized spot welder, and $60 + shipping... Ships from Korea
