Hello, I just bought a MotoTech electric skateboard. It's old school looking with big 10 inch tires.  I notice that they come with a design flaw in the heavy rims which have 3 screw cylinders that through the tires off balance and causes a pendulum effect at slow speeds and death wobble at high speeds (see video link from my google drive below:).

Looking for replacement hubs for similar eboards like FIIK Big Daddy, EPIC 10 Inch Tyre wheel, EMAD Dirt rider, etc...  Most of these brand website don't sell their hubs in the USA.  I am willing to try any hub that fits a 10" tire and 12mm X 28mm Bearings.  Any links or suggestions???

Cheers,

Ty Huelle

yeah, I've been to all the tire and golf cart repair shops in the area.  The tires are to small to put on their machines.  The recommend replacing the rim.

Wheel balancing can be done without any machines, find a guy who will do it without one

The car garages have balancing machines that are pretty size restrictive. Find a good motorbike shop with an expensive bike wheel balancer and that may work out better,something like this

:boom: just remove the valve core/air, pour in ceramic beads, replace valve core/air... done
