You can just bring that, the cable in the housing, I'll put on all the connectors and you'll be able to just plug it into the vesc

Though if I were you ide wait till you get the vesc and then bring it in and I can solder the phase leads right to the vesc and save a ton of space otherwise I doubt you'de be able to fit it in there
