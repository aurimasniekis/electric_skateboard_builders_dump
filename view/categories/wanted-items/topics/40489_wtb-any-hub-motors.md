Hmu. Anything works. Just please give me good deals. Not in exactly the best financial situation as a high-schooler. I want the whole rear drivetrain. Thanks

Dude I think there was a guy selling some used hummies on here. I would go that route. I also have some torqueboards hubs in decent shape i might be willing to part with.

This 90mm wheels dual hubs drive kit I have, brand new, 78us + shipping.  24V input, with Hall (without connector), is the cheapest on the market.  but easy to get heat and burn, you need to using carefully.  So, no warranty for this.

I have 2 brand new Maytech 9055 hubmotors with blue urethane. I'll sell them for $160. You would then need to order maytech's truckset. That would cost you $40.

So for $200 you could have a dual hubmotor setup with some decent torque. (for a hubmotor setup)

Actually this hub motors have 24V version and 36V version.  24V version can not use with 36V input, 36V version can not use 24V input.
