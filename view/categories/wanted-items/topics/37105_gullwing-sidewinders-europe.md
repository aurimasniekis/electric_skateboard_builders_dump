Hi, I am looking for a pair of gullwing sidewinder trucks, can be used...
Does anyone have them or know about a good place where to buy them?

From what I have found the cheapest option is to buy them in the US and pay the shipping...

Yea, I saw some of them, but they are usually more expensive than the set of new trucks :/

160 euro with import tax shipping to Ireland. 
https://www.amazon.com/Sector-Sidewinder-Unagi-Complete-Longboard/dp/B071LM633P/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1520791674&sr=8-12&keywords=sector+9+sidewinder

So If @monkey32 got used Trucks for 50 then for an extra 110euro You get an extra deck grippe-tape good bearings and wheels.

Well I can tell you them paired with a medium flex board is super fun to carve on or just cruse.
but going faster than 30 km/h starts to get uncomfortable and unstable.
