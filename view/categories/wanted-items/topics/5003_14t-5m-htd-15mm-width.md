I think TB's just has alum pulley's in 15mm

Steel is definitely the way to go

TB's is definitely steel, at least my 9mm 16T one is.

I talked with @torqueboards I got two 16t 9mm steels from him. He only has 12t 15mm left. I really need a 14t 15mm steel... Making a scooter with MBS wheels. 200mm wheel with a 66t or 72t pulley.

It was going to be for my unknown kv rewound ntm propdrive. but since that is now fried (RIP :sob:) I am probably going to get one of @chaka's motors once i can save up some money.

Right now my wheel pulley is 44t, but i hope to replace that with a more standard 36t with some abec wheels.

I don't want speed as much as i want torque so smaller motor pulley is not an issue for me.

100mm original zboard wheels

they are rubber and when my motor was working i could do burnouts with them :stuck_out_tongue:

hoping to replace them with similar sized wheels, or figure out a way to use the aluminum hub and do some custom urethane to replace the rubber (love the look of the wheels and they fit with the mad max theme that i will be doing for my board
