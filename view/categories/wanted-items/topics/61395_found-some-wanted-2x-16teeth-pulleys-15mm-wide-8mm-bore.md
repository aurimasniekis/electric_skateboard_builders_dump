Does anyone have a pair of 16teeth pulleys 15mm wide with a 8mm bore just lying around and be willing to sell them at a reasonable price? Im from canada and of course I will pay for shipping :slightly_smiling_face:

Hope someone here can help me. I looked around and the only suitable option for 16teeth 15mm pulleys are from . And sadly they are overpriced IMO. Especially considering the shipping fees of 40$ to canada which I do not understand!!

Make your offers I'm open to anything reasonable!
