Can anyone point me to any shops or people that have extra nano-x remotes available in US?  Am going on an EU trip and wanted to bring a few along for a friend.

I think most the ones in circulation from cyber Monday have sold and I'm not aware of anyone that stocks them..you may get lucky though but I wouldn't expect to find more than one.
