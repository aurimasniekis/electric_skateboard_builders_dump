Hey, as per request I'm creating this thread to federate all the people that want my risers. Worldwide shipping. These are AL7075; black anodized (or any other color). The last batch of 20pcs went actually really fine with good feedback and delivered in time as committed. 

Just post here how many you need; then we'll see if it worth going forward !

Cheers!

I also received really good feedback on my compatible mounts & drivers for the Trampa Trucks/hubs (even if you reverse the hanger to get this roaster sleek look which is what I'm doing)

You can see the in action here :

I'm interested but hesitant- 250 euros not including shipping is quite steep for me, even for a custom part. If we get enough people would the price come down?

Yeah, it's not cheap but that's also because they are full of details and I really like details which add to the cost.

Let's see how many people we can get and then we'll see who join or not.

Cheers!

I'm out due to price. I was interested in the risers as an alternative to Trampa deck so I can run Trampa trucks on a standard longboard. At this price that is negated as I can buy the Trampa deck cheaper.

eheh, It's for sure not on the cheap side but these are precision made with lots of details in limited batch. If I can get 50 or 100 price would be another story.

Sadly, I'm out too due to price. Having worked in a machine shop I know that's not a simple piece of work, and it costs to make these, but I just can't justify the price for what it is. 
How many are we right now? 5, 6 people? Let's say that's 14 pieces ( I think one person wanted 4)- at this rate I doubt we're going to get to fifty pieces anytime soon.
@okp what if you make a simple version without the extra features? Would that be worthwhile?

## \#28 Posted by: kane Posted at: 2017-09-09T09:17:03.864Z Reads: 181

Ouch! I said I'd like 4 but I might have to re-think that.

(brief pause)

Okay, I've thought about it; I'd like 2 chrome risers if that's still possible. Is there somewhere I can give you my credit card details and address?

Hey, sorry for the late reply ! I think it's better to cancel this one unless we got the 20pcs; cause the price will go higher. As I'm running on cash, I cannot afford to stock a few for the shop. 

the part is pretty simple; extra features are the nice chamfers and precision milling.

hey folks, just back from eye surgery (nothing crazy but a pain in the eye!). Baby is fine. Working on a lot of new things coming out soon. My wife take care a lot of the baby so I didn't get that much impact (a bit but nothing crazy).

I got several messages of riders that would like risers but they are not cheap to produce, so I told each of them to make/join a group buy. If I got enough parts, I'll launch a production and of course, be fully transparent on the price. 

Cheers folks!

Congratulations on the baby! Always nice to hear.

I've started a thread to try and gauge interest. Hopefully we can get suffice people to signup to make this a reality. Here's the thread ---> http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/unik-35-risers-group-buy-registration-of-interest/47811

Edit: The thread was soooo good it got banned ... true story. Here's the updated thread ... I've added a bunch of emoji to confuse the moderators: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/poll-unik-35-risers-who-wants-them/47874
