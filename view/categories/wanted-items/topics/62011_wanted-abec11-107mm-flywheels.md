Does anyone know the best place to get a set of 107mm Flywheels? I've heard of people getting blank Flywheels for a little cheaper, but I'm not sure how they get them.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

They should work great for my 4p13s 6380 4100W single motor build.  I should be able to give all 80 amps to the motor using the FOCBOX cooler I just bought from here:

Yeah, I saw them on eBay, but I wanted to check to see if anyone on the forum had a better price first.
