I am liking for an benchwheel/@solidgeek firefly remote and receiver for under $50.
Or if someone wants to wait until I get my nano x, I can trade.

the Benchwheels are $79 on eBay and that doesn't include a receiver.

maybe this would do

Or just get a Nano 2 from someone on the forum.

@grecoman
Does it have good travel.
I don’t want something that you push it 1 cm and that’s full speed.

I tried the nano 1 and I didn't think it's throttle travel was good at all compared to the mini RC remote

I did tried one like the eBay remote I posted. It was on a friends board and I though it had really smooth throttle.

I texted him about it and he said he is using the Benchwheel remote now.
He said the Benchwheel remote is really good.
