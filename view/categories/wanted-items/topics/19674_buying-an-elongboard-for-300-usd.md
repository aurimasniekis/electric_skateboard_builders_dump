300USD and good don't really fit in the same sentence. 
600 euros and good will fit into that sentence

I dont want to stop your friend from getting an E-board, but 300.- doesn't really cut it. Everything that could be bought for that price (currently at least) won't be any fun in the long run. A decent battery (even only if Lipos), a Vesc and set of mounts + pulleys already puts you most cerntainly over 300.- (easily with taxes, shipping etc.) 

My 2 cents on this, safe up a little longer, go about a simpel DIY yourself with the more difficult parts prebuilt (a lot of vendors of different sizes on this Forum).

The other option would be to go for a cheap but decent complete at this point. I would advise towards this option : [Link](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-29-speedster/). When it turns out as well as their rocket series, It probably is the best bang for the buck currently. Even sold DIY builds wont be much cheaper with a similar configuration.
