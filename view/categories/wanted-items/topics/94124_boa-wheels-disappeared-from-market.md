What suddenly happened to the boa wheels?
I was planning to pick me up a set of 90mm or 100mm (still deciding) and as a surprise didn’t find any of them anywhere, on their website didn’t find neither and on other websites I can only find the 100mm and on all of the websites they are out of stock. Is it possible that they stopped producing them or what happened?

I remember someone bringing this up recently on a thread and they replied. Seems like poor planning but they just ran out of stock and they have more wheels being made but it is taking a long time clearly. Such a bummer because I really want a set for my lofty direct drives. Hopefully they can get their shit together

Don't wanna derail the thread too much. Was going to do lofty drives, unity, 10s3p batt, 100-110mm wheels all on a jet spud. I need a small board in my fleet. I have a Psychotiller stealth 18 enclosure sitting around that would be perfect for it too.

Not stirring up anything by any means. I know planning ahead can be difficult sometimes, but I feel like you owe something to the people that have been waiting on an order for half a year. By now all those people have already had to find different wheels for their builds, or have been set back riding for 6 months.

Lol not to stir but I still want my white boas. I have ask in December, January, March, April. Customer support said. A few more weeks or 6-8 more weeks for new batch everytime. And god damn I don't want a refund I want them wheels. Can you just tell us when exactly is lebeda starting your batch? And there's at least 6-8 weeks after that for those to cure.

Most manufacturers need to get paid for previous orders and get deposits for new ones before starting production.

I find it interesting that another company has designed a new wheel, taken pre-orders and delivered them in less time than Jed has been trying to re-stock their BOAs

Yeah I have that feeling too but notv100% sure. Torqueboard 110 definitely came from lebeda and they are pumping them out quick.

All I want is a honest date. If it will come out in December I don't care I'll wait. Just stop giving that 6-8 weeks BS. Ppl need to know it to plan their build.

Fully agree and we are too forgiving.  We allow suppliers far too much leeway because its what we want on our pride and joy but jesus christ almighty waiting  that long for wheels is unacceptable.  These companies get away with this crap because of the custom nature of our builds and the particular tastes of the builders.  We need to stop being so picky and kick these wankers into touch.  Company can't supply?  Go to one that can.  @Winfly  Want white wheels?  Buy the evolve.  They'll get them to you asap.  Supply chain.  Not rocket science.

I was just digging around the pizza thread and and I guess I picked up an pineapple instead.

The new Evolve 97 are great. But we still need an 100mm Kegel option. I can get Lofty Kenna to make 100mm Boosted formula wheels. Not 100% sure of the quality and min qty is a bit high. Otherwise I have to pay for mold fee for small qty.

We are not that hard to please.

Transparency goes a long way with people.

I have been involved in many hobbies, some bigger and some smaller than esk8.

There are manufacturers that take years to deliver a product, yet there is less wining from the customers because they have been upfront with them from the beginning and they had an actual business plan.

Unfortunately for every proper businessman there are ten that are just winging it, especially in this industry.

Making a successful product run on something like a wheel is not that difficult.

Assess the market (quantity, price competition etc)\
Design the product\
Make the prototype\
Set a price with a markup that will allow you to a) be a viable business and b) be competitive\
Get pre-orders\
Use the money to start production\
Deliver the product\
Use the profits for the next production without the need for pre-orders.

If you can't do that, then you are doing something seriously wrong and should not be in business.

FTFY.  This is extremely abnormal and wouldn't be tolerated anywhere else.

If the company does not have inventory in-stock and ready to ship today, then you should think twice before sending money.  That applies to all things, including esk8 things.

I am talking about actual manufacturers not esk8 companies that outsource to manufacturers.

Try going to a pipemill and place an order for 20km of 24" ERW pipe without making a huge deposit. Or not fulfilling payment after that order has been completed and try to place another order.

Labeda doesn’t make or ship wheels without payment. All our production with them has been paid upfront out of pocket and not with pre orders. 

We have been ramping up production on both our wheels and the 90mm required some changes. We have placed an order and paid for 1000 sets of each of our wheels so we have sufficient stock for our store and for our retailers. 

We expect to start having stock available towards the end of June.

Nahh I hear ya, but I'm judging by their actual responses to people's inquiries on this thread itself.  

like @murdomeek said, this sort of response is straight up rude to paying customers who've been waiting months: 

[quote="captainjez, post:55, topic:94124, full:true"]

That being said I have no doubt they're doing their best and making quality products and super busy and don't intend to rip anybody off, it's just a matter of communicating with customers.  Take a look at @torqueboards, they have a couple guys who respond to messages online, emails, and always within a day or 2.  This is A-fucking-plus customer service and they will continue to get my business even regardless of whether their products fail on me or not because they take accountability and COMMUNICATE.  Nothing for months is just straight up irresponsible for anybody toting themselves as a "business" IMO and then to respond with super short and & mindless responses is an indication that they do not care about customers.

You are  completely right I totally agree with you not even chinese website have as bad response as they do but yea that’s how it is we can’t force the company to satisfy us with all our needs what we can do is either talk to them about it or just ignore them and not buy their product and that will lead to two things: either they will produce faster and promote it more so that they can get more money or just stop the production at all and call it a day and forget something called boa wheels

Word of advice. For ekate if you want to follow a timeline only buy parts that are in stock and shipping right away. It's a rare vendor that hits their estimates consistently. If you plan based on ETAs your build will be 18 months late.

Seems like poor planning but they just ran out of stock and they have more wheels being made but it is taking a long time clearly.

The mix of scammy and non-scammy behaviors is confusing. If it were a pure scam, the website would still allow purchase, right? And the small quantity of actual products that have been delivered is great.

Need every size :) I feel like 97/100 mm is the sweet spot for torque/weight/speed/plush?

That's probably confidential. Doubt they can tell anyone if Boa is actually a scam.

You guys really want 100mm?
[/quote]

Yes. With a proportionally smaller width. For smaller board builds.

Dude, I've been throwing bricks through your window with "100mm" written on them and you act like you're just now hearing it?

Nooo. Wide. I've got 78mm wheels almost as wide as tb110, wide is good.  We have narrow 100mm and below wheels.
 We need wide

I hear you. But sometimes I miss "drifting" my rear wheels with TB110s bc they're so grippy and wide. I want 100mm, plush ride and the ability to slide a tiny bit on turns or hard carves. I know the thane formula is a big part of that, but I think a slightly smaller contact patch would also help.

I didn't mean 100mm as the CP, sorry lol. I meant that the wheel should be 100mm, with a high CP. Somewhere in the 70mm range 😎

65mm would be halfway to decent. I like a good square wheel... maybe a 97x85? Not sure there is a reason to go much beyond 80, but we need a big wheel @ 70+ wide CP.
