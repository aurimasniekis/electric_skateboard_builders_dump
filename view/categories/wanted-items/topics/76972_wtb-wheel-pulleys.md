Jlabs pullys don't have screws. (At least not ones that go through the core of the wheel) They are press fit

@JLabs Are you done with flywheels? If not, let me know when you get some. I have too many flywheel cored wheels just laying around that would be cool to use.

Now to buy my first set of kegel core wheels. :slight_smile:

Yep. That and sizes available for kegel. I already have a ton of flywheel core wheels. I'm running out of money for my newest build. My fiance is going to kill me if she finds out what I've already spent. Haha.

I ended up getting the red boa's lastnight. I guess I'm just going to give them a shot. If you guys don't hear from me for a while. It's because my girl found out the amount of $$$ I spent this last week on ESK8 and ended me. ;)
