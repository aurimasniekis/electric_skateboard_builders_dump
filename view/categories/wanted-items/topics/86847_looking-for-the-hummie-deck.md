Search for "drop-through" deck.  Not to be confused with "drop-down" deck.  A "double-drop" deck has both drop-through and drop-down.

I am pretty sure he means a deck that has partial cutout on the underside for batteries / ESC, instead of the cutout for the trucks of the drop-through decks.

If the deck has enough plys you can route out the space with a router

I'm not sure how else to explain it but if they deck has enough plys of wood pressed together to make it than you can use a router to make that recessed area for the batteries.
