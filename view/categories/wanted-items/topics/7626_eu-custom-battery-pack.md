I know that @Tarzan, @DeathCookies and me bought parts for a spot welder.
Maybe someone can help out?

At first I have to make the welder :smiley:
I plan to make my own pack, but haven't planned to make packs for others.

Battery builder (from Poland) can be found on Endless Sphere forum.

His username there is:

I'm sure he is able to offer batteries at very competetive price, too! Although most of his stock consists of 10A cont discharge cells with high capacity (Sanyo), I believe.

He looks like a really solid builder.. and what's even better is that he has lots of batteries.. I hope it turns out well and you manage to work out the details with him ;)

Sorry to reopen this thread, but again/still have the need for a battery pack. I am scared to do it randomly since i got scammed once. But checked all the DYI-part sellers or any company that came in mind. Noone sells 10s4p / 12s4p in europe... Or did I miss something ?

@michichopf I could maybe make you one lol :D What cells would you like to use? And where are you located exactly?

I assume you are from Bergen, Norway?
---

---
Would you like to do the soldering yourself and just want it spot welded ?

Might be a bit hard to put it in a heatshrink at the moment..

Cells can be obtained in Eu.. you just need someone to do the welding + soldering..

Are you in Bergen.. or is that you surname? :joy::joy:
I am in Stavanger during the week and just bought a spot welder. Maybe we can organize something.
I wanted to check about air travel as it seems they have just changed the rules on Lithium batteries. i had initially planned to buy them from UK and take them with me to Norway to avoid the local state racket if I ordered them directly from Stavanger...

Well my family hence my family name is actually from Bergen (founders) but my specific family tree imigrated to switzerland some 350 years ago. so its "von Bergen" meaning "from Bergen". So no, i live in switzerland currently :)

Ah ok! At least you money is safe there...
It will be a bit far then. I am not familiar with the legislation for the postage of batteries, but I assume it is possible as I see them flying on the forum.
I can see what I can do for you, if you are not in a rush. Spot welder on its way, and I am not a professional (to say the least...).

I think a123 is a bit rare on this side of world :D

Even though nkon probably has them they are probably crazy expensive

9,70€ each on nkon.nl, you would pay 120 on cells alone for a 12s 2500mAh

At this point it is worth buying sony vtc6 I believe.

A123 have 70A capability, they may still be worth. Sony's have way less

You are right. The discharge rate and the capacity aren't the same stuff though. If you had a 1p battery (a123), it would be capable of handling a dual drive (in terms of amp peak). But when it comes to the range a123 and a 25r are both 2500mah so you can travel the same distance with the same configuration (1p).
For this reason maybe vtc6 are the best (3000mah+30a discharge rate). Correct me if I am wrong.
```

Yeah I know, but 30A is often not enough, and you are gonna stress the cells a bit too much. I would go for 60A honestly, maybe vtc6 in 2p
```

Yes sure, 30a is never enough. I was comparing a123 and vtc6 considering price/performance.

So does anyone of you know how much energy does hills take?

With no hills longboards can live with even 5-15A discharge I think :D

For acceleration (soft one) 20-30A might be needed..(single drive)

I am not to savy on this subject, but Since I live in switzerland in a very hilly area and I take hills at the 20-25% daily, I am sure not more than 50a, Since my Raptor has a 60a fuse in it.
Ignore me if thats completely wrong :)
