Hi! Anyone here selling battery packs based on Australia? I'm planning to get a flexible 10s4p or 12s4p for a board that I'm planning to build, similar to the evolve GTX. Anyone able to make a battery pack? I don't mind paying a little extra.

I can ship to Australia... no for real though If you still need one shipping is 90$ 12s4p is 380$ flat or double stacked with flier power switch, bms and charger, a Charge Lcd optional. You might wait a while but It'll get there.
