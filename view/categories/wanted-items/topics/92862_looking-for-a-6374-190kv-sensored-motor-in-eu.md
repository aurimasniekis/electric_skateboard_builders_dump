Hey,

I'm looking for a reasonable priced used or unused 190KV sensored 6374 motor in Europe, maybe even with the hall sensor adapter cable so it's compatible with the focbox jst plug.
Thanks!

Best

Edit: unsealed motor

I have brand new 6374 190 KV motors in stock, sealed with sensors and ready for next day dispatch from London in the UK.
The sensor adapter will fit the FOCBOX

How long would you expect a motor to last. Have one that the VESC will no longer calibrate as the R value warning comes up only done about 30 miles on the motor.

@DavidBanner Thanks but I intend to use the motor in a friction drive setup so a sealed motor is not optimal (copper losses inside the motor plus heat from the heated casing because of the friction)

@Darkie02 Also thanks, I really need a proper working motor this time :slight_smile: Maybe you could open up your motor and check for shorts in the windings and apply some insulation varnish?

wrong.

Street Wing has custom 190 kv motors

and the 170kv motors maytech sell are £125 plus shipping, plus VAT, plus duty, plus handling if you buy from maytech

Lol wrong?   I purchased 2 x 170v motors directly from Maytech for $105 per piece just a couple of months ago, *including* vat, duty and handling.  Price based on single unit purchases.  Express shipped worked out $125 per piece all in (£95.40 at today's rates).

I know others have purchased them at $95 too... respectfully, are you honestly trying to tell people here you're getting custom motors made by Maytech and are selling them for less than Maytech are selling OTS components?    Sorry, but to try and claim Maytech are selling these direct for over $160 each PLUS shipping, PLUS vat, PLUS duty, PLUS handling (which is included in the shipping of course) is just plain laughable :joy:

Anyone here can check out Alibaba where Maytech sell them to see just what nonsense that is - and anyone emailing them for a quote gets it even cheaper than that.

As an aside, are you claiming your motors aren't made by Maytech?  Because if they are, you'll know exactly what they charge for them if you go direct - and it's not $160.

Here is a copy of the order details from my Alibaba trade order:

![Capture7|389x500](upload://hZqR7Y7lJfTzklkj2ocx5CVIChg.png) 

Mine was shipped DHL - I was charged not a penny more than this following delivery. 
Eileen from Maytech stated if I was they would cover it.

£95 per motor, all in.    And if you look around on these forums others have got the 6374s for $10 per motor less than me by going direct too - I'm not the only one.

I can see they've increased the published single unit prices on Alibaba - either way that's not the actual price... in order to place an order you request a pro-rata invoice from them which has the actual figure, and I'm pretty sure it's in-line with what I've stated here unless they've double the price in the last two months (highly unlikely!). 

I have the motors here - it is what it is.

nope.

What is  so hard to understand here? Maytech make the motors for me to my custom specifications and no you cannot buy these 190 kV sealed motors with the large jst connector that will fit a focbox/unity etc off the shelf from Maytech.

I find that very surprising. All of the big courier companies will charge the VAT, Duty and handling fee. The only time that doesn't happen is using the slow china EMS service and very small/light packages. I have literally hundreds of packages coming in and out every month and every single time DHL/FEXEX/UPS etc etc have charged these fees

![image|690x426](upload://e794L5cKSBjYNIeUJWeiwvYMDsu.png) 

2 Motors + delivery to the UK $300 = £229

Import VAT @ 20% = £45.80,
Handling Fee = £10,
Import Duty @ 2.7% = 6.18,

Total = £290.98 /
Each = £145.49

The description in the link above is wrong but it seems to be the same motor, here is another of maytechs alibaba listings with the correct info, but a higher price:

Man you are one pedantic dude :yum:  :)  you're blowing up and not following what I was saying.  

If you got your motors from Maytech you'd know what they charge, hence my questioning - you had them custom made, so didn't buy them via Alibaba - you must have spoken to Maytech direct.  So, the link you've shown isn't the price you paid... nor is it the price I paid.

Anyway, I'd urge anyone to contact Maytech directly first too... no need for the attitude - this is for the benefit of the OP... if he can get a better deal, I'd always advise someone of that; naturally you're going to want to defend your business but here isn't the place.

What on earth is this conversation?

Luke purchases motors to resell conveniently in the EU to people like me who don't want to jump through eleven hoops to buy from China through a third party website and wait 20 to 60 days for delivery before running the tax/import administration fees gauntlet.

He's running a business for profit, of course there is a markup. You want him to drop them off with you for free and give you a handy at the same time?

This is ridiculous. Buy from Luke, pay 15% more and you get them within 2 days to your doorstep with fixed pricing. If you don't want that, do the above.

Never ordered from maytech direct but have purchased from Luke to at StreetWing before. When I had some problems he helped me sort it quickly and replacement parts arrived next day. 

Sometimes it's worth it to pay extra for fast local service. How much is your time worth?

(...currently quite a lot as an IT contractor), but just 72 hour shipping and pretty robust/reliable motors made it worth the saving - just my opinion though.. I'm always for cutting out the middle-man - I prefer to deal directly with manufacturers and it all adds up in a build :)   If a local business ceases trading (which let's face it for a one man band is much more likely than the manf.) there may be problems claiming from the manf. warranty anyway when buying from a third party.

Street Wing current price for 6374s is £144 inc VAT.  Maytech got back to me yesterday, their price has increased slightly to $123 (£95) per motor.  

"Thanks for your inquiry.
One 6374 motor is US$122.85/pcs.The total price of 2pcs is US$245.7."

SW price inc UK post is just under £300 for two motors.  From Maytech that'd be £220 with 3 day shipping ($39 DHL) - I didn't get charged VAT or import duty, but even if you did that's still worst case £265 (and very rarely is it the full amount, the declared amounts are usually half the consignment value) and Maytech do provide good support where necessary.  I'd have almost certainly thought anyone outside of the UK would save significantly more on postage though getting from MT for obvious reasons (we get totally ripped off on international shipping here!) - it wasn't clear from the OP's post where in Europe he is.

I agree for the custom 190kv it might be worth the extra to UK buyers, but I'm pretty sure you have to buy quantity to get custom windings therefore the price comes down from this anyway - it's entirely up to the individual if they want to pay the margin and deal with a local who may or may not have replacement units in stock if/when things go wrong.  

The OP requested a good priced motor so I hope it helped anyway!

your figures are close but not accurate

2 x Motors = $247.70, Shipping, $39, Total = $284.7 = £214.97

Alibaba Credit card transaction fee $8.24, your card issuer will charge a fee for using $US, natwest charge  2.75% and will also give you a crappy exchange rate thus taking more off you, maybe £10 on that amount (at a guess), but let's ignore that for the moment.
Here are those figures: 2.75% of £214.97 =  £5.91, $8.24 = £6.22, total = £12.13

Here are the import charges on that using DHL; handling fee £10, import duty (2.7%) £5.80, VAT (20%) 
 £42.99. Grand total: £285.89

(It is worth noting if your goods are marked down in value if they go missing the courier will only payout the value of the invoice.)

Street Wing Price is £295.80 including postage to the UK, which is just over 3% more than direct from the manufacturer  in China for a custom KV motor, and by the time your bank has robbed you on the exchange rate it's likely to be the same price or cheaper from SW. Not exactly a huge markup is it, and to put it mildly the operating costs in the EU are huge compared with China.

So the £95 ea motors are actually £142.95 ea by the time they are in your hands

and if you are wondering if you will be hit with import charges, here it is straight from the horses mouth: 
![image|473x165](upload://aPOZ4PoCy4WRBDTM9JiFxUc2ZRt.png) 

And no, companies in china cannot pay EU VAT on your behalf, it is simply not possible.

And there is this:

Do you mean the shipping costs are high in the UK? If so I have found the UK and EU to be one of the cheaper places to send stuff from, ask the US guys about shipping costs.

Yep the US is high too, but I was talking about the outbound shipping costs from the manf. in China of course which are usually cheaper. 

Edit: BTW on the import charges I was told the same yep (we all know every country has import charges -don't need a Chinese to tell us that to be fair ;) ) , but that if they were applied they would be reimbursed.   Granted  though they may not offer that to everyone, I can only relay my own experience.  In fact I've been told that for many purchases from many sellers on Alibaba.

I just asked for a quote yesterday and $124 per motor was what I got back - no mention of any 'special offer' price (I do believe that's a sales tactic yes). 

Anyway - again, it's not a big deal... as I said YMMV and some people may prefer to go direct.

Every person in EU need to pay VAT from orders made shipped from China, maybe you was just lucky and for some reasons your customs missed to charge you.

Please show me where Maytech is saying that they will pay you your custom charge if you get them, i don´t believe that.

And to avoid the need of sensor adapters you need to order 200+ motors or pay them for 200 sensors wires that will cost you 300 usd just for the cables

£144 doesn't leave room for profit?  Bare in mind he'll be buying in bulk too - his prices from MT will be lower than ours.    As founder of a manufacturing company myself I'm pretty sure if he charges more he'll risk losing sales... (maybe not from you though :P )

It's not a personal purchase, I understand where you are coming from, direct customer purchase - diy spirit importing and all that but you should understand that the retail world is completely different.

One dishonest paypal charge back (which happens weekly on my sites) and he needs to sell eight more motors to cover his losses. It's not straight forward, it's a lot more complicated when selling to the unwashed masses. That tiny profit is paying for storage space, administration, answering unnecessary forum posts questioning his ethics, website hosting, payment platform fees, lights, water and all of the rest.

He's not just chucking 20 quid in his pocket and skipping down to the beach for an ice-cream.

the problem is this:

Someone comes along giving it the big one and says something is waaaay overpriced and this company is ripping people off and really shady either directly or by intimation.

Then this happens:

[quote="ju5t, post:31, topic:92862"]
nearly shat the bed when i saw the margin most people are charging so this was top advice thanks!!!
[/quote]

problem is the first person doesn't actually know what they are talking about and the final price difference once the item is in the customer's hand is a few % or actually cheaper from the local independent esk8 shop.

The people who come along and read the thread or just the first few posts purchase from China, either have problems they can't get past or a defective product and are left high and dry. This customer then either gives up on their diy build or ends up spending much more money and ends up with a half finished board sitting there taunting them for months.

Meanwhile as an independent retailer operating in one of the most expensive cities in the world who always does their best to be upfront, honest and give the best possible customer support (sometimes more than 12 months after a customer has purchased a product or on products customers have purchased elsewhere) it feels like a kick in the nuts, which after a while gets pretty boring.
