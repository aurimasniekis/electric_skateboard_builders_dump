Looking for someone that has a decent spot welder and the tools and things needed to make me a pack or at least just do the spot welds and help me do the rest myself. (Also if the person has a BMS for it, it would be nice)

I'm looking to do either 12S3P or 12S4P Samsung 30Q that would fit a Eboosted Enclosure.

Looking to use one of these:

https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/trampa-carver/

Looking for a cheap solution that would fit, so if anyone is up and can give me a price it would be amazing.

Im in Denmark, Europe if it makes any difference in terms of shipping.
