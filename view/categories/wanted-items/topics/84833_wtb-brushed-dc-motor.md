Anyone got a brushed DC motor?  Around 36V and 800W.  Needs to be low RPM or have gearbox.  Located east coast US.


I brought a motor here for a skateboard and it's busted...still have all the electronics and mechanicals

I'd imagine so, it looks like a strange truck assembly so it'll take some modding but it should work just fine.  As long as its a ~36V brushed DC motor and the can diameter is less than 3" it should do fine

By the way, the truck assembly requires you to make extra holes in your deck, they have a wider frame

I have a 350w 24v MY1016 you can have for free if your buddy grabs that pintail. I was overvolting it at 36v and the thing never got hotter than I could touch. Not sure how familiar you are with brushed motors but a 12v overvolt speeds them way up and is generally considered safe and standard in the super scooter world. This motor was in my first electric skateboard/mtb hybrid actually haha 
![image|666x499](upload://sRVK93D7Kya4ctvhUUxnsC0YYSi.jpeg)

Before you laugh too hard, top speed I hit using a stupid phone app was 28mph. This thing actually could push me through the woods.

Shouldn't be an issue. I'll still send it for fun. I was running my 10s4p chinese lithium pack on it with no trouble. 42v gave it no problem and the voltage only goes down from there.

I switched the motor sprocket to a more torque-y one to account for that. The overvoltage of the battery really helped the speed. 

Here's my original plan (what got me into skating to begin with)https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Electric-Skateboard/

I added my comments to it too. The only reason I built a full on board (well 2 now) was because the brushless motors are the only ones that support vesc (without some heavy mods)

I was using 3 x 12v SLA batteries like the instructable was but they were so heavy. I got my first Li-ion pack from aliexpress (knockoff cells, blah) but it certainly cranked the speed up due to the weight difference.

I think that's going to be a common issue you'll find with brushed motors. They're generally bigger and bulkier.

The diameter is kinda important, its for a college commuter and electric vehicles are very illegal so it kinda has to look skateboard like, which are only slightly illegal

Just general brushed info to consider,

I wouldn't trust watt rating on motors, there's a reason the brushed motors everyone here use ls are voltage rated, not watt. 

You want to look at the rpm rating instead. 
Since P = I*V, 
Watt rating would change wildly with applied voltage.

For example, a 36v motor ran on a 36v battery with a set watt rating will be exactly as fast as a 24v motor ran on a 24v battery with the same watt rating. The difference in that equation would be the amp draw is lower in the 36v system. 

Here are a few brushed motor calculators that will help

So I'm not sure what the ESC I'm running (karam's old metroboard from 2013?) will do to protect the motor and battery.  All I know is I'm running a 10s2p LittoKita 30Q which will start to break down above 10A per cell.  Should it be okay to plug it into the ESC and let it go or will that just set it on fire?

Long story short this is not a long term board, it cost me under $200 for everything and it is only until I can get my longboard running (dual chained maytech drop)

I want to get it running w/o spending much more money, maybe down the line I'll make a dual hub w/ lipo for campus but that is more money I can't spend rn

I'm not sure what I want to do anymore, I know I'm close to getting this working but I'm not sure if its the right path to go down, but $20 for a 1hp motor isn't bad so fuck it.  If there are mounting holes on the front of the motor I'll buy it (750W one, I'll risk the rpm)
