Just want some tb 218mm trucks, doesn't matter if its used.
Want to try to mount some 6374s just to try it out. Shipping takes way too long and kinda don't want to spend 75 bucks on a pair of trucks that I just want to try out

(Seller preferably near NYC)

They're 65 bucks now :( and Id have to pay again for shipping, ordered a 6374 a while ago but I dont expect them to come soon, they're probably bombarded with orders.

If they haven't shipped your motors yet, you can probably contact them and have them add the trucks on to your order.
You could send Dexter ( Torqueboards ) a pm and see if he can hook you up. He's a really cool guy and has been very helpful to me in times past.

Might be difficult to find any used for sale.
I have a set on one of my boards and I love the feel of the wide track.
