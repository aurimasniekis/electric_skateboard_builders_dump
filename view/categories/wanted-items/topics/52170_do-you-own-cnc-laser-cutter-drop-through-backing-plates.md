Hi.

I'm looking for someone who can cut this kind of pieces for me. The one in the picture is made of  6061-T6 Aircraft grade Aluminum but I'm okay with steel also.  I don't need any paint or anodize. 

I would like to add some thickness on blue areas and that why 90mm lenght would increase a few mm.

Any idea how much that would cost?

Just buy them from [Riptide](http://www.riptidesports.com/backing-frames-for-drop-through-trucks/).

/edit
It's not that I don't want the business, but @alphamail has been awesome here on the forum and we should all support Riptide Sports. And the price is the same as what I charge for this job.

Problem is that none of those are what I’m looking for so I don’t want to buy it from riptide and then cut it in pieces. I need one between model 102 and 104.

Where are you located? I can do them if you can do without the small cutout at the top there since I don’t have holders for that small endmill ^^ 

How thick is it? My closest stock size is prolly 30x100mm in 3meter lengths.
