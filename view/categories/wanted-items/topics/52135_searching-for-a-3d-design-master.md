Lmao they didn‚Äôt give dimensions which is why it‚Äôs a bit harder, what I do know is each pick is 10s1p with the esc portion able being able to hold a vesc sized control board. From these images it‚Äôs a bit easier to guesstimate the dimensions though since you can see roughly how large the 18650s are in comparison to the case![image|680x360](upload://mlhSP3KWsUNkyobmAPMBlY140E1.jpeg)![image|624x500](upload://fNL5AzpLOpfRErB0pLOOzIsskIV.png)

My bet is on @SORRENTINO since he helped with modelling a few of hummies revisions.

Or @L3chef

I feel like I would much rather watch Greco and Apollo duke it out in a fortnite/pubg match :P

So, we need some dimensions / margins to start off. Otherwise, there will be 5 different enclosures with totally different dimensions ....
