I've got aluminum 16t 15mm or 20t 15mm, if that helps. I might have a 15t 12mm TB pulley, but it is used. I'll look and see.

If you want to buy from a shady character, have it ship from the other side of the world, and take months to arrive, and be wrong when it arrive, maybe yeah.  So is that "good"?  I'd say not LoLz

Some of us who have already done that might part with a pulley but not for under $10 I would imagine.

Also, helpful tip, your profile is missing your country, if you add that more folks might answer

I have this one you can have for shipping, does it fit what you want to do?  You will need to get grub screws for it as they are missing.

Here's a cheap option (<$4) that's also good. I've put over 500 miles on one.

I just looked and they [only cost $5](https://www.ebay.com/itm/322328974649), I don't even think I could ship it for much less than that.  It might not be worth it

Being aluminum and not having a keyway, it's definitely not the best pulley though.

I was going to recommend just buying one from . He has good pulleys with keyways, in the US. 

But really, if your sk motor doesn't have a keyway, just file down a flat spot.

So if you file down a flat spot, a keyway would work???

It isn't rocket science. Just buy a pulley. 
There are sources listed above. Or the approved vendor thread has trusted suppliers listed.
