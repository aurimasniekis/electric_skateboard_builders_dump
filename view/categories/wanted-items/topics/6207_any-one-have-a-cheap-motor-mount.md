So, I let my friends borrow my esk8 when I was gone. When I come back he tells me the belts keep breaking. So I knew something was up. He dropped the board off and the motor mount was bent a ton and it was cracked at the bottem. Lesson learned don't let people who don't know anything about esk8 borrow  your esk8. Anyways I was wondering if anyone has a spare mount laying around please pm. I have money ready in paypal.
