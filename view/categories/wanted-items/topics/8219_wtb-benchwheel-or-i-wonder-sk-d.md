I realize I don't have the time (or skill) to build a board myself, and so I am now in the market for a solid dual motor entry-level board, such as the BenchWheel or the I-Wonder SK-D in case anyone is selling theirs. (I am in Los Angeles.)

Thanks,
JT

I am in Santa Monica. I am looking at duals primarily for the the more controlled acceleration/breaking power.

I have spent many hours on this site reading the feedback about these (and other) boards. I have also communicated extensively with the BenchWheel and i-Wonder factories in China. The result of my research is that these 2 boards are currently the best "bang for the buck". If you have another recommendation I am all ears!

Humm....

Well, personally I'd stay away from both...

Besides quality issues, and the likey hood they are blowing smoke telling you these are the next best thing since sliced bread  ... If something should happen...What would be your recourse? Parts if something should break?

Then these boards shouldn't be on your list

It really depends on your budget mate and what you want the board to do for you....

What's you budget?
What do you weigh?
Where are you gonna ride?
How far do you want to travel?
What kind of speeds do you want to reach?

Simple "ask yourself this" questions but will really help you narrow down your hunt for a pre made board right for you.

You mention dual....is this for the speed or for the power? 

Many of us here can build singles that can smoke the duals you mention....true story

I'll be also riding in L.A ..but trust me ..you dont need duals there. I-WONDER is pretty decent although at the price of 799$ - you can have a lot better DIY board.

@DrB why don't you go for a group ride with the boys and @LEVer from CarvonSkates before you commit to anything
 I was just in Venice and took a ride ...

Maybe you'll come over to the dark side when you get going on a real board üòà

Ha - I actually signed up for that meetup in Venice but then couldn't make it!

I don't need speed, and I don't need climbing power. All I want is to ride the bike path (for now at least).

What's you budget? I can get the BW or SK-D for about $500 - $600, so that's the range for a new board.
What do you weigh? About 170 lbs.
Where are you gonna ride? Flat bike path (for now).
How far do you want to travel? 10-15 miles max.
What kind of speeds do you want to reach? Not important (but I don't want to crawl along, either.)

You can build a board like that very easily if you want to. Here are some parts I'd recommend:

1. SK3 245KV Motor
2. 150A Car ESC (or VESC if you want to get the best of the best... overkill for 6S)
3. (2) 6S 5000mah battery wired in parallel.
4. Enertion Motor Mount
5. Enertion Wheel Pully System 12mm
5. Any remote - look around for a group buy. I know @Michaelinvegas is thinking about doing another for a trigger style remote, I'm sure some people here would be willing to sell you a spare remote. Or if you want, just buy a new remote from one of the DIY Esk8 companies.
1. Caliber 50 Trucks, along with Flywheel Clone Wheels. Any random deck you can find for cheap.
1. As for the enclosure, there are multiple options. I've seen people use lunch boxes, you can even use IKEA utensil trays!

The yuneec ego2 goes 13mph and has range up to 18 miles and has a nice deck with tail kick. with good support from factory and spare parts not too expensive. they are $699 new.
Customer support from benchwheel is not.

Well I do hope you take advantage to meet to meet some good people and to try out the boards....hubs vs. belts...
Deck styles ....trigger finger or thumb ....the more people that come out when you ride the better....

I'm not worried ....I shall soon see your build thread ... Mark my words...you'll find the time üòà

@LEVer  @Namasaki Thanks for the suggestion. The E-go2 was on the radar, but the 12mph max speed made it drop off the radar....  Maybe I need to reconsider this board.

I have not ridden an E-board before. From researching I'd say I prefer hubs due to them being water (splash) and dust proof (easier to maintain). Don't need the ability to customize gearing etc. But if I end up with a belt system that'd be fine as well.

Eh... I'm just putting myself in his shoes....

If I was to purchase a pre made board....

Yeah, I'd look at the same crap he's looking at...especially if I've never really tried out an Eboard....

And if I had an offer to ride other people's ride so I can make some sort of educated desion ...id be all over it...

Riding an electric skateboard is addicting....

And to have buyers remorse ... Eh...it just kills the sizzle 

But to answer your orginal questions as to what would be on my list at that price point to be exact ... It would be the ego at the sacrifice of speed ....I couldn't name two others I would trust 

If you had double the budget or so...Evolve, Metroboard and boosted

The best eboard is the one you build yourself, But if you're not interested in making a hobby out of it then nothing wrong with buying a prebuilt. Just don't buy one of those junk Chinese boards from eBay or amazon. They break and then you can't get them fixed and there's no customer service. They're just a waste of money. You could buy a prebuilt board from Carvonskates.com, They stand behind their products with customer service that is unmatched.

I have an EGO and a Carvon V2 Single. I should have a Carvon V2.5 any day now. Can't wait!!! 

My first board was the EGO. Great board and I still have it. Reliable as heck and I've gotten pretty good customer support.  You will likely want more speed at some point, but 13mph is fast enough to get you where you want to go and have fun doing it. I still enjoy riding mine. 

Now if you want to spend a little more cash, you can build your own fairly easily for around a grand. One thing that makes Hubs easier when doing a DIY build is that you don't have to worry about gears, mounts, and belts. $250 for the Carvon V2.5 Single is a really great price. You can do it cheaper, but it would take more work and research to get there.

The Carvon V2.5 single deal looks interesting... 

So IF (huge if...) I were to actually do a custom build, building an entry level board, these are my current calculations:

Carvon V2.5: $250
Carvon VESC: $99
Remote (eSk8 group buy): $50
Deck: suggestions? (preferred: wooden longboard)
Battery + enclosure: suggestions? (target: 10-15 miles range, up to 20mph speed)
Total Build: $$$ (target = up to $600)

Is it possible? Am I missing anything?

Your probably looking at a bit more for a hub set-up. You should really come out and try a couple of boards before you buy. I'll be posting here for the next meet up: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/updated-with-location-california-santa-monica-meet-up/6994/110

I've got a hand full of boards you can try. And if @LEVer shows up, you can try some hubs.

Need to budget a bit more. If you go with lipo you can prob get away with $750 or so. If you go with a higher quality battery budget around $300 for it.

Sundays are tough, but I appreciate the offer (and might take you up on it if I am free)!  Is there a meetup.com group (or FB group) as well? For the exact location and time?

On a budget, i'd suggest a simple single motor belt setup.  Cheaper - learn as you go and stay closer to your budget (or use that $ for more batteries/range).

A single Sk3, belt drive setup from DIYes or Enertion (kit w/ gears and belt), Lipo batteries for budget (dual 4s for 8s in series and budget friendly).  VESC, wires, heatshrink, etc.

Just pick a charger (iMax B6ACv2 recommended for least $ w/ good features and simple), a deck (personal preference!), but maybe even go blank deck for $ savings - http://www.funboxdist.com/store/top-mount-longboards/ or similar.

advantage is you can easily add a second motor dual diagonal (possible dual rear if you keep around 55mm can length) later if you need more power!
