Hello all,

Just looking around for a pulley kit and 4-wheels.

Was wondering if anyone has some orange wheels **_83MM_** (shoot a message for any color) and a pulleykit. 
Aiming to finish my board around spring-break, but probably going to be pushed back unless someone can help me out.

Let me know what price your looking for.
Thanks

Kegel Wheels still available. I also have some 9mm 36T alum pulley system specifically for Kegels. PM if interested.
