@MannyM0E Thank you so much. My batteries weren't charging with the 42v charger. Will they charge with the 8s charger?

if you have an 8s setup then you need an 8s charger...trying to use a charger rated for more than what you have is a bad idea. Using one less than what you have will only result in an under charged battery if it works at all.
