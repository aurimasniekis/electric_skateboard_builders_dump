I want to do a dual drive and I figure the cheapest way is to use  TB 218mm trucks.  My budget is very limited that is what i am looking for a used set of TB 218mm trucks.  I know a new set will cost around $75  so am hoping someone will have a used set laying sound and will be willing to sell.  I am in California usa 94546 area.

Will buy or trade.   

I have a used set of maytech hub motors and a meepo  v2 esc that I could trade.

Caliber trucks off of Amazon fit the motor mount fine, that is what I use
