HELP! Drowning not waving!

Street Wing is going crazy and I am drowning at the moment trying to keep up with filling orders and everything else that is going on. I am doing 18 hours days, 7 days a week and my girlfriend has forgotten what I look like.

I need someone to make up some sensor cable adapters for me to help out with the workload.

It's a paid gig - please hit me up if you are up for it and let me know how much you would like per cable.

I need 50 to start off with, and will need more on a regular basis after that.

Anywhere in Europe of the rest of the world is fine - the cables are small and light so postage won't be an issue.

I should have mentioned that whoever takes this challenge will need a Soldering iron and a hot glue gun.

I can send over the cable components and the correct sizes of heat shrink if needed.
