As the title states. I'm located in the Jersey City area in NJ.

I only need one ultimate hanger. But I need baseplates, springs and dampa's for two sets. Then I'm also in the market for some SuperStar Hubs and some of them 6'' tires. 

Colors preferred would be red baseplates, a black hanger, wheels can be pretty much any color except green. would prefer red springs and dampas as well. 

Thanks in advance!
