I am looking to sell my Dickyho airless AT kit, I have been using it for about 50 miles and is selling to go back to traditional wheels as this has been a bit big for me to take with me on campus

The kit includes the trucks, motor mounts, motors, wheels and the rear bracket.

The deck is not for sale but whoever buys the kit can also have my Diyeboard 2.1 ESC with remote for free, and also some 1. gen dickyho mounts for caliber trucks

Again, @sanderfu, I am very interested in these items. I have Pm'd you a few times with no response,.so are these items no longer for sale? Or is there some other reason you are not contacting me or returning my messages? Please contact me at your earliest opportunity and let me know. Thank you for your time.

It was only posted on the 29th @sanderfu, that was only two days ago and I messaged you the same day, actually within a couple hours of it posting. it woulda been real nice if you woulda told me this shit "a few days ago". Who cares who closes threads nowadays? Cuz there's no reason at all that you couldn't have either messaged me back or actually posted that it's already gone right here on this page when it sold so people don't spend days trying to reach you about it. Thanks a lot for the consideration... NOT.
