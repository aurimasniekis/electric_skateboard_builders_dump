If anyone has any Mountain Board or all-terrain parts (Trampa, MBS, etc.) that they'd like to sell; new or used, let me know what you've got or send me a PM! 

I'd be most interested in trucks (channel or skate type, 10mm or 12mm axles, etc.), bindings, wheels and tires. But decks, bearings, drive components, electronics, accessories or anything else is welcome too!

Pic for attention :sunglasses::mountain_snow::mountain::park::snowboarder:

Thanks!

Nobody has any extra MTB parts lying around, collecting dust?

I have some beat up white-ish MBS Twistar Hubs that I won't be needing (just got aluminium hubs). 
not sure how useful they would be for a build, but LMK.
