Looking to buy a single motor mount that work on caliber 2 enertion trucks and a 6374 motor. Thanks. Prefer for it to be less than $60. I have been looking online and most mounts are either really expensive or too cheap and unreliable.

A guy in the forum is selling some of these.  I purchased and am just waiting for it to come in (he is in and ships from Lithuania).

Looks like a really sturdy mount and for $40, I went for it.  Suppose you can ask others in that thread if they enjoy the mount.

Hey @Bensaida - being in Cali i'd suggest you also consider @korryh's mounts.  I have a few and **super well made/solid.**  Also local'ish to you in bay area so perhaps faster w/ no customs delay.

For just the motor mount, it's in your price range.  You still need to source motor/wheel gears and belts.  I recommend using the[ bbman belt length calculator](https://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/) when you know your gear teeth numbers and Center to Center distances. 

@Gee - pretty sure that's *exactly* what he was referencing as cheap/unreliable.  That and the round hanger mount ebay ones - i'd avoid personally.

For a single setup, especially if you aren't a lightweight rider - i'd get minimum 12mm wide gears/belt, or better even to go to 15mm.  If in doubt i'd also suggest trying to add an idler pulley to keep more teeth in mesh and less force/belt-tightness needed so less wear on all.

HTH - GL!

as a general rule, but specifically with powered skateboard gear...  If its good it ain't cheap, if it's cheap it ain't good.

I totally agree but then why you ordered a couple of hobbyking motor mounts?

But i also have to say that i had an expensive mount on my first build which has never worked properly.....

I think there are areas you can skimp to save some $.

A mount isn't one i'd suggest unless there's history and a feel for reliability.

To put it in perspective - a motor mount failure at speed will almost certainly be catastrophic (as in sailing through the air and about to introduce your face to the asphalt/road/sidewalk).  So going bare budget least expensive option here doesn't seem like a good idea...

But hey - i like my face, and think most of it missing might affect my ruggedly handsome good looks...  ;)

I would prioritize those critical items and not be the first to try a budget mount (not to say it might be a good deal and worth checking into - for science!), vs tried-and-true.

I would highly recommend Korry's mounts - one on my GF's board and rock solid.  I also recommend the v2 and v4 DIYes mounts (made from 7xxx series aluminum - NICE!).  

I've tried a ton of different ones - ADS v1, v1/v2/v4 DIYes, Enertion CF (nice not as adjustable), Psychotiller, KorryH, and the two i'd use are Korry or DIYes.  The new ADS v2 might be better than the v1, but i tried on Paris 195's and round hanger/axle + mount = PITA and don't recommend.  

Anyway - HTH and GL!

Yep, because I wanted to see the composition and architecture.  You will notice that I have posted any builds using them :).
