Hey guys, I'm going to be traveling to USA soon and I wonder if anyone has found a place when I could get it at lower-than-retail-price.

I was planing to join the GB but that's gonna take a while and I need to have it delivered next weekend.

I already checked:

Muirskate.com, they don't have the black one only the white.
daddiesboardshop.com US$ 479.45 (they only have retail price)
Amazon.com they don't have medium size :sob:

snowbitch.com has carbon but no medium S/L/XL
https://www.snowbitch.com/helmet-tsg-pass-carbon-solid-color-carbon-black183/d-208989/

Here is the TSG sizing chart (pass is full face at bottom)
https://www.ridetsg.com/resources/14_sizing_charts_helmets_website_72dpi.pdf

I too am probably a medium, coming from motorbikes I know a 56-57cm size probably would fit best(S/M?) - that's my Schuberth size anyway. 

But I've taken a chance on a small - 54-56 cm / 21.3-22‚Äù from Snowbitch & according to the sizing chart from TSG. I think they have removable cheek pads which may get me some extra room.

Will update to let you know when it arrives, I may have to return and order something else, I really like these and I guess it's important to hear whats around when on a esk8 unlike a MC where you are trying to elmininate noise due to high speed and save your hearing!

My head is 58cm, so I'm on the top limit of the medium which runs between 56-58cm, as there was no medium carbon anywhere, I chose the Large, I've heard Tsg runs smaller, some suggest to go one size up, so that's what I did. 

I'm really hoping it'll fit good

What diameter was your head? How snug does it fit? Snug enough to fit the helmet with one hand?

56cm should be on the lower limit of the Medium, so you should be good. Please keep us updated with the fitment review

Adrenalina is like a mom and pop shop. The owner Pablo works the counter during the week. He's really good people.
Manny works the counter on the weekends. They are both downhill riders and really know how to set up a board for speed with stability.  They have helped me a lot setting up my boards.

@Eboosted hey brotha! I own this helmet and it runs small compared to other TSG Pass'. The Carbon Pass is literally a size smaller than normal. I ALWAYS wear medium size helmets for my tiny head, but for this particular helmet... I wear a LARGE. I'd double check amazon for a size L that will fix your medium sized head ü§òüòé

@DaviDjembe my head was 58cm so in paper I was suppose to use the M, but there were no M anywhere so I went with the Large one, hope it fits good.

I'm located in Lima Peru so I still need to wait for the helmet to arrive from USA Texas.

I'll post pictures and review the fitment upon arrival

So I got my large helmet tonight, the equipment is pretty nice, extremely well made and attention to detail is impressive. 

As stated on my original post my head was 57.5cm, according to Tsg size sheet, the correct size should be M (56-58cm), however as I couldn't find any M and the some people suggested to get one size up for the carbon version, I choose the L (58-60cm) from Amazon. 

The fitment of the L was good, it first tight, I need to press the helmet from the top in order fit it in my head, the checks are a little pressed against the check pads, once it's on it fits good, maybe a little in the snug but just a tad, I guess it'll loose a bit with a couple of uses. 

All in all I'm pretty happy with my helmet, for those that are thinking about getting a Tsg Pass Carbon, get one size up.

Ok guys, new update.

I had to return the Large helmet, I didn't feel right, too much pressure over my cheeks and very difficult  to slide into my head and even more difficult to remove it.

The carbon version is definitely 2 sizes smaller than the fitment sheet, so be aware

Ok update, arrived home to find my delivered small carbon helmet. While I was away I snuck into my motorbike equipment and found another Schuberth C3 in size 54/55, that is snug without being uncomfortable which gave me hope.

The TSG is pretty much the same size but has magnetically held cheekpads, they were squashing my cheeks in.

I have to hide it now since the financial controller is back shortly, 

Plan: don't ditch cheekpads, instead put them under some heavy books for a couple of days

Where did you buy your helmet from?, how much did you pay for it?

Do you feel the helmet is comfortable?, I'm going two sizes up.

@Eboosted Snowbitch.com ‚Ç¨199. I have another Schuberth a S1 & that is a 56/57 and is roomier esp. the cheeks, but I don't really need the space I have an Arai shaped head, what impressed me with TSG is that they have 4(I think) shell sizes rather than just padding out different sizes, the magnetic cheeks are cool, I think I will run the regular visor for winking üòâ 

@JLabs you know I do. I must get a can of spray muck to sully new buys with...liquid muck is that a thing?
