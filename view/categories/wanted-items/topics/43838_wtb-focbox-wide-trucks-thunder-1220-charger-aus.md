Description says it all. 
I have one Focbox and I'd like a second for duel motor setup but to do that I will also need wider trucks, at least 180mm between the wheels. Would love some Trampa  Ultimates but any truck will do. I'm also looking for a thunder 1220 charger if anyone knows where I can still buy one from.   

Thanks

I have an unused FOCBOX in Europe if you're interested
