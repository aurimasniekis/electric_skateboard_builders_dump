Hi , 
I'm in London and  will order 30 cells for a new 10S3P pack (VTC6) https://eu.nkon.nl/sony-us18650vtc6.html
price can drop to 3.89â‚¬ if we buy 100. 
is someone interested ? 

do you have any plan for a good spot welder in London. I made my first battery Pack in the London Hackspace but it was a cheap spot welder and the quality was not good 

thanks

Hmmm I'm interested as well ;) I have some decent lipos now and no sag, or very little. Has anyone got any experience with those cells ?

Have you considered 30Q? Much cheaper and similar performance

30Q is rated 15A https://eu.nkon.nl/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html
VTC6 rated 30A https://eu.nkon.nl/sony-us18650vtc6.html

I know that it is only manufacturer data but a lot of people are really happy with this VTC6 ...

Have you compared them all with my tool @sayreul ?

I wonder if you really need 90A discharge? Which motor(s) are you running?

The most I'm pulling at the moment with single 6374 is approx 45A or so, on lipos rated 30A constant 40 peak. It is motor current and battery current goes up to 15A max. I'm not getting huge sag so my lipos are doing well then ;) and that's only 10S.

```
the thing is that there is always a difference between manufacturer data and reality. 
it is why I would prefer to do my next pack with the best cell as possible 

for 30 units. : 
the 30Q is at 3.49â‚¬
the VT6C is at 4.25â‚¬

for a 10S3P pack, the difference is just 23 â‚¬. if the cell is better, I 'm ok to pay a little more 

the Max charge current seems to be 6A instead of 4 or 5 A, this is better for regen & brake (18A max, 9 per VESC)

yes, I have read your topic. it seems that they are not as good as the manufacturer said , but they seems as good as Q30 or a little better .. 

> For a bit higher current applications, the VTC6s might be a slightly better fit than the 30qs

anyone interested ? I think I will order tomorrow

ok, keep me informed, you can check this website to compare cells.

i have spent hours to compare cells and VTC6 is not the cheapest , but it is a really good product if you need 3000mAh

I'm going to go another route with my spot welder. Going to use a Microwave transformer and a small relay timer board to build a welder. 
Relay board will turn on the transformer instead of trying to handle the high welding current so it should work well. I'll be able to control the pulse time from 0.1seconds onwards.

Got the Spot Welder built today, works most of the time. Main issue is my timing relay board only does 0.1s increments so occasionally burns right through 2 levels of 0.2 nickel. 
Got another timer board on the way that goes to 0.01s increments. Will allow for a more of a precise timing pulse.

I don't I'm afraid, but it's quite simple. Earth goes to the transformer itself, I used one of the screw holes in the base. Brown or blue (doesn't matter) goes to primary coil, other colour goes to NO (normally open) on the timer board. Then the common on the goes back to the timer board. The two going to the relay can be swapped, doesn't matter which goes to common and NO.

The question mark should remain empty? Relay basically has two positions open and closed. Top is normally closed, ie the circuit is complete. Normally open (bottom) means the circuit is NOT complete and therefore the transformer is off when the relay is off

Good work both of you! I decided that welding batteries was probably too dangerous for me to keep looking for DIY alternatives which might also end up costing me even more...and took delivery of a Sunkko 787G last week.

First tests have been awesome. Excited to get my build on the go, this road block has lasted for about 2 months...!
