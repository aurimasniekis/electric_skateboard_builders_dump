Looking for caliber 2 baseplates in either 44 or the Randal 30's would be cool as well. Would need shipping to Canada as well. Willing to pay dollars or pay you in electronic parts. Have plenty of 10AWG, various widths and lengths of nickel, copper braid 5mm bullets xt90 etc.

I know it's a bitch to get to Canada is the only thing after the 15 USD than another 20 to ship them and customs and duty on top of that. I was hoping someone had a spare kicking around somewhere to hook a brother up.
