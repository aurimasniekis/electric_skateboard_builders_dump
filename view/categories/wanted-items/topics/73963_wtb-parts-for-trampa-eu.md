Hello!

So I've recently got myself a Trampa board with vertigo trucks :smiley: 
![image|690x388](upload://dFwvR5KB4MKt0Y7UHVnzPDzf2Vh.jpeg) 

This is gonna be my first build. I've already pre-ordered a untiy focbox and my plan is to make a 12s5p-7p.
I've heard Samsung 30q is the battery to go for tourqe and 20700B for range but these have less tourqe? 
I want minimum real 40 km range.

I also do got a enertion remote control.

Due to the model I got I'm thinking of having a box in in the middle so I'm in need of that. I would also need a smaller box for the rear part for the focbox unity.

I'm looking for direct drive with or without motors or a belt system.

I'd love to hear your thoughts of Kaly.nyc direct drive vs e-toxx pros and cons.

Motors I'm planing to buy is the SK3 or SK8 190 kv.

Let me know what you got to sell! 
My plan is to finish the board by march or earlier.

I appreciate all the tips you got for me aswell! :slight_smile:

Thanks!

Look for pelican cases, they waterproof and you can get them in different sizes.
If you a bit into 3D design you can make your own box/mount for the unity.
If you don‚Äôt have a 3D printer you can look at 3D hubs for printing or ask me if it‚Äôs not too expensive to ship to you I can print you your design in petg.

Etoxx vs. Kaly 
I don‚Äôt have any from them but i‚Äòm sure they both great.
Etoxx you can get in 4:1 and 5:1 and with helicals for more silent ride plus different colors.
The kaly till now is only in 4:1 available.
For both you need to sent your hanger for machining just in case you didn‚Äôt know that.

If you want to go off road maybe think about to go a bit lower in the kV. 130-170 gives you more tourqe.

Thanks!!! 
Oh I did not know that I had to send in my hanger? Then Kaly.nyc would be harder due to my location Sweden.

Where are you located? Shipping would be to Sweden :) 

Regarding the torque I would like something similiar to Raptor 2 and with that top speed of around 50 km/h :)

I‚Äòm from Russia, so shipping shouldn‚Äôt be too much. As min we not far away from each other üòÖ I need to sent some other packets on the weekend anyhow, so I can ask what it would cost.

Sorry about that wrong information about the hanger and the kaly drive. He also machine his hangers, so that‚Äôs why I thought you need to send your. The thing is that trampa refused to sell hangers to etoxx and kaly. So if kaly now out of stock he will probably only deliver when his own hanger (on which he is working at the moment) is ready and produced.
I was looking for the kaly drive in the very beginning and shipping to Russia was about 100$...that‚Äôs what made me to not to order...you can check shipping on his website. Idk what it would be to Sweden.
I personally would go with an etoxx gear drive.
It‚Äôs more close to your location and @Nowind does a good job in customer support üòÖ so if you have any questions he usually can explain you everything, plus shipping will be probably only the half or so.

You can calculate your top speed here
http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":0,"batt-cells":12,"motor-kv":170,"system-efficiency":85,"motor-pulley-teeth":10,"wheel-pulley-teeth":40,"wheel-size":200}|

With 170kV and 1:4 you up to 58km/h on 8‚Äú wheels and 12s. So you could even go more low with your kV

If I'm correct the cost for etoxx would be 525 plus 150 for Helical Gears so total 675 euro for that package plus shipping. 

Maybe get the Helical gears after but then it costs 295 euro? 

The price scares me a bit tbh but I'm still thinking of it. 

Btw regarding the unity box, I got a friend with a 3d printer if you got the file for it to sell?
How sturdy is that box?

How's your build? :)

Best to write @nowind and ask him about pricing etc.
maybe you can get the gear drive directly with helical instead of the usual gear and than don¬¥t need to pay the full 150‚Ç¨. But I don¬¥t know as I didn¬¥t bought one from him before.

I didn¬¥t designed a box for the unity yet.
I don¬¥t have a unity so there was no need for it.
I meant you can design your own if you a bit into 3D designing  ;)
I can look if I have a time I can design you a box or mount for the unity. shouldn¬¥t be a big problem.
just need the hole pattern of the unity and need to know if there is a need for you to have parts from the unity exposed or it should be just a simple box.

Edit: and you will not need to pay for any STL files... I can just share it, no problem. Just don¬¥t wait that it will be perfect as I don¬¥t have the unity here to take exact messurements.

here my build log ;)

Believe me, I try to avoid to take off the boxes because the velcron is so strong that i‚Äòm afraid one day I will rather break them than to get it off üòÖ
I was skeptical before too, but really no need for it. Just get good heavy duty velcron and all is good

Isn't the lipo more expensive than 18650?

I think I've calculated it wrong maybe üòÖ
I wanna be able to ride atleast 30-40 km. 
So my thought was getting 12s6p 30q cells.
Do get the same range I would need 12s4p with your lipo and that would cost like double the price? (799 wh vs 888 wh)

It was just more convenient for me at one point.
As i have two trampa i can easy interchange the packs and one I want as light as possible.
Two 6s packs only 1.6kg and makes it more easy for jumps etc.
If you want to have that huge range, definitely go with the LiIon pack. Just make sure you take care that it‚Äôs made right and save.

Also lighter, seems like I had wrong üòÖ

Btw, looks like I'll be getting E-toxx üëç

Well li-ion is cheaper if you make the packs yourself i guess. Keep in mind that you want a good BMS if you build your own Li-ion pack. 100A continious BMS is what i got on my 12s5p. Those cost around 80-100‚Ç¨ or so. 

If you are going to usr 4:1 gear ratio 150 KV motors would be perfect for you, it will give a theoretical top speed of 52 kph. 

I just so happen to have two sk8 149 kv 6374 motors that i will replace with 192kv motors since my gear ratio is 6:1. Higher KV means that i will br able to play around more with my gear ratio since i use belt drive. I guess you dont change gears with the directdrive setup? 

In that case i could sell my 149kv motors to you, they have around 30-40km so basicly brand new. I'm also located in sweden :)

For the lipos I use a 12s 5000mAh 60c I pay around 130‚Ç¨ for 222Wh 
That‚Äòs 0,58‚Ç¨ per Wh if my math is right
12s1p is 1,6kg so 7,2g per Wh

If you buy 30q cells from nkon with tax it‚Äôs about 3,20‚Ç¨ for one cell 38,4‚Ç¨ for a 12s1p with 129Wh
That‚Äòs 0,29‚Ç¨ per Wh if my math is right
(Calculation without additional costs like nickel, heatshrink, silicon wire etc.)
12s6p should be around 3,6kg (cells weight only)
And 774Wh so 4,65g per Wh

You also need to consider that the charge cycle life of a lipo usually shorter than liIon.

So all over the 18650s are King.

Just for me it was more comfortable in that moment as I promised my girlfriend not to mess with batteries at home till I found a workshop.
Lipos are nice as you have 80% of the time nearly the same voltage and with it the same top speed.
While with LiIon the voltage drops nearly linear (depends for sure also your cut off) and with it also your top speed.

I don't notice any voltage sag until my battery hits like 20% and even then it performces really well. I think i put my cutoff pretty high at 38-40 volts something something. 

Do you know if it is possible to switch from li-ion 12s to lipo 12s on the go? Or is configuration in vesc needed? Would be pretty cool to have the li-ion pack mounted for normal rides and when extended range is needed i could carry some 6s lipos in a bag and just mount them with some velcro on top of the battery box and switch the battery cable to the lipos when more range is needed
```

---
## \#36 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-11-10T10:19:19.559Z Reads: 66

```
I didn‚Äôt speak about sag. The voltage just slowly goes down more or less linear from 4.2-3v with LiIon.
With lipos you stay longer in the 3.7-3.9v area but also cut off more early at 3.4-3.5v.

The thing you explained will be my next year summer battery pack.
I have a enclosure for unter deck mount and i‚Äòll Fill it up with 12s5p.
The vescs mounted on top of the deck.
Out of the enclosure will come only a xt90 so it‚Äôs easy to swap the LiIon pack to the lipo pack mounted on the top.
You can change the cut off voltage with different apps.
Or just set it to 3.5 start and 3.4 end and you good for lipos and LiIon.
Oooor you can just add an lipo alarm to your lipo packs and as soon as it starts pieping you will know your packs are empty

The only thing is that these are loud as hell so if you mind noise its not your cup of tea :) But otherwise they are unkillable :) 

We also have 2 other options :)

FatBoy SS 1:5 the biggest bad ass gear drive right now in market in my opinion, I am running it with 80100 motors and 130A battery. Survived hard brakings and real off road bicycle track :)  But if used with normal motors up to 8085 it has best motor mounting solution sitting on the rail which not allows motor to get out of alignment of gears (keeps meshing in best position). Impact resistance casing, newest technology nylon based gears for least friction and longest live (wear resistance) and all other improvements to support 2kg motors and 9" wheels :)

if you're gonna use 150kv motors i think 1:4 will be the best option. as said that should give you about 52 kph top speed and still plenty of torque.

how about 1300 SEK for the pair? since they are like 2 weeks old i think that's a fair price.

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-149kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html?wrh_pdp=7

before i sell them i just want to make sure that the 190kv motors are okay for off-roading, with a 1:6 ratio they should be but i wanna be confident in that before i sell my current motors. The new ones should arrive between monday/tuesday next week if you could wait a couple of days? :)

What motors are recommended for these, kv?

What's the difference in mini drive and heavy duty? I'm more interested in the mini due to the compact of it and looks. Do you know how these stand these https://www.e-toxx-shop.com/trampa/mini-direct-drive/mini-direct-drive-orange/#cc-m-product-9947425570 with helical gears?

Well mini drive is like street version which is not meant for heavy offroad and just normal riding :) It has 1:3 gear ratio so around 130-170kv is more than plenty.

Heavy duty is 1:5 and its most hardcore in everything, m5 bolts, 2.5 module gears, extra thicc aluminium and etc. So you could go full offorad with them or plug them in with high power motors like I am doing and kick the streets with wheelies and etc stuff :) For 1:5 you can go from 170kv-190kv motors There is also 1:4 option for higher speeds :)

Size wise Mini is just small, and SS is bit bigger but more massievier :) It's like 1 cm wider than wheel hub so on 8" tires it's perfect, I couldn't get them hit anywhere in city even jumping curbs and etc :) Just only issue when wheeling I touching back of gear drive to the road but that's like first world problems :D

Well helicals pros are more silent operation but it also has its own cons :) I am sticking to straight gears as its much easier to mesh and less troubles down the road :)

For a 12s5/6p the 12s8p Trampa HS11/HolyPro 35 DS would be the one to order then? 

How much would you charge for a semi complete powerplant with a 12s5p with charging bms and port, no need for focbox/esc I've pre ordered a focbox unity. (or what battery packs do you offer?)

Thanks!

From your battery specs I get the impression you wanna build something like this.
has >70km range. Its 12s10p (2x 6s5p) of 20700B - with DieBieMS.

If you have motors the same style as in my picture then they are compatible but if you got the new APS 80100 motors they are not anymore 100mm length and they are much longer and they don't fit

![image|374x500](upload://sbYv757ps97jtMrSFDweSDnoGUt.jpeg)

You will need to lathe down the axle of the motors to 10mm and also cut short as the 80100 motors has axles on both sides:

I don't have any motors yet because I don't know what will fit.
Here it says the measurements are 80x100. So should be OK?

I specially mentioned because other customer bought the same motors and received complete different ones, the ones I uploaded picture so that's why I am mentioning to you when you order ask for older design or etc.

How long are your motors. It's hard to see on the picture. To me it looks like 105-110mm
