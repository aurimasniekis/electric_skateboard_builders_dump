Hi all,

I'm looking for a FOCBOX (vesc-x) with a toasted DRV8302. I'm planning to swap the swap parts to higher rated components anyways, voiding the warranty, so I'm looking for dead ones. Ollin ESCs with heatsinks are good too.

If you have one or two lying around, let me know.

Huh, I was thinking Ollin ESCs had higher rated caps, but not too much detail in the locked thread. Can't seem to find it now.

Nha there approximately the same, it just there more on the focbox to compensate, which give around the same total capacity, also positioning is more important than capacity

FOCBOX and the Ollin ESC? I think the parts are quite similar, but neither of them have a public BOM afaik. 
But seems to me the Ollin ESC has better customer service, but at a higher cost.
