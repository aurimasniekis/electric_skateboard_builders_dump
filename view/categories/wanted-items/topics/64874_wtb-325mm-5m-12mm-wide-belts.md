Long shot but anyone has a few of these belts to sell me? I really can't find a source that has good shipping costs and time in Canada.

Just trying to find the ideal belt size for my builds.

Thanks.

https://www.vbeltguys.com/products/325-5m-12-synchronous-timing-belt

This is where I buy my belts from - cheap and fast-ish shipping. 

Just buy more than 2 because shipping is at least $7 so make it worth your while.

Shipping is $13 and it will arrive by Sep 13th. Or $35+ and it will arrive in 7 days. Not too bad.

EDIT: Nevermind shipping is $114

Thank you for the offer @Sn4pz. I took a look at USPS and I think shipping would be $25USD. I Should probably order from Alibaba and wait a month.

Cheers,

Thanks again @Sn4pz! Generous of you but I have some 330s and they are a bit loose, that's why wanted to try the 325! I also have 320 and they are too tight :smiley:
