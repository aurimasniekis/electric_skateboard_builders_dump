Hi!
Does anybody have a motor pulley 15t 15mm width for a 8mm motor shaft?
I want to finish a build for my brother and he will pick it up on Wednesday, unfortunately the only missing piece is the motor pulley and I don´t think my ordered one won´t get here in time.
So if anyone has a spare one, I´ll pay generously :rofl:
