I’m looking for a Matrix 1 truck. The one with plastic top trucks and springs not shockblocks. 
I know it’s a long shot but I have one and need to match it. 
I checked with MBS and they don’t have them available anymore. They just sell Matrix 2 and matrix pro now. 
Thanks

Do you have any other trucks that you might want to trade?

Nothing for a mountain board. 
Just some old longboard trucks. 
I have a bit of weird new old stock MBS stuff. 
Don’t know if you’d be interested in any of it.
