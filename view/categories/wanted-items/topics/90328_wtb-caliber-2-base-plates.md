I was thinking like $18, they are lightly used as i replaced them with randal bases. Is that reasonable?

I have two 50 degree @torqueboards [baseplates](https:///collections/featured-items/products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks) which are Caliber2/Randal compatible.

Yeah give them a try! I run 35 rear and 50 fromt spli5 angles. I love that they sell different angles and indivually i.e. hanger or baseplate
