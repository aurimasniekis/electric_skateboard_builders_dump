[s]Anyone has a pair of used **sensored** 63xx motors wanting to sell? Preferably low kv, around 200kv.[/s]
**Edit:** Bought from @bignrichie. You guys can check him out, he has other motors to sell.

**Edit 2**: Now looking for a battery pack that fits the ownboard/wowgo/meepo enclosure. Can I fit a pack bigger than 10s2p in this enclosure? Or can I go with Lipo? Which way is cheaper? I ruined my pack and I'm broke af now so don't want to spend too much. 
This is the ruined pack that I paid $130 for back in august.
