Wait. Do you only use BMS for charging?

that would be the reason it says ‚Äúcharge only‚Äù üòâ

So you have two pairs of parallel wires out of the cell. One pair for bms along with the balancing cord and the other for the vesc? So you can use the minimum amp output bms?

what? all charge only means is that i can use 10a bms‚Äôs without a problem , I only have 11 balance wires, like everybody else that runs charge only.

I lost you there. So the BMS only handles charging? Guess I'll figure this out some where else.

yea. no current goes through it while riding, it only charges and balances

Is there a downside to doing this? Why doesn't everyone do it?

some people like discharging through them. discharging through a bms gives you low voltage and amperage cutoffs, which in my opinion, are unnecessary for our application since all those can be handled with vesc settings.

Ah... The VESC handles the cutoffs. So the discharge/charge BMS is for secondary safety.

I have a 10s bms from a hover board with the charger.
Not sure if that would work but if it would PM me.

I don‚Äôt even know the amp rating for it but it was previously connected to a 10s2p pack for charge and discharge, so I think for charge only it doesn‚Äôt really matter

It also adds additional risks.  You now have an extra failure mode.  Plus, if the battery is completely full and you hit the brakes, the BMS will disable your brakes to not overcharge the battery.  Not sure about you, but I'd rather damage the battery than myself

Watched couple his videos & he also have a website 
Idk much about them but here's a BMS from the site

As i posted in the other thread one of the above posters linked.

I am using the one posted here. Was here in nc 2 days after ordering. Works well.

10s BMS in the US

This is what I use. Right outta Cali‚Ä¶I utilize it for charging only, discharge is bypassed  Look at this on eBay http://www.ebay.com/itm/152255799442

it‚Äôll be probably saturday or sunday before I let you know. getting a 10s balance charger as a ‚Äútrial‚Äù
to balance and check internal resistances to see if it‚Äôs even a problem with the bms
