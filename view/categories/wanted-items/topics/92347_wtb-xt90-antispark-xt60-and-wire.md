In the final stages of parts gathering, looking for a few xt60 to parallel my battery packs, some red and black wire of the appropriate gauge, and an antispark for a loop key. Iâ€™d rather get it from someone here then a random person on eBay or amazon. 

If you can put A little package together for me with your extras lmk.

I got all that stuff needed on hand. Get me a descriptive list (wire length and number of connections) and I'll quote you a price. Loopkey is already made just sitting here and has a 3d printed cap. I'll include a free 3d printed panel mount for the xt90 as well.
