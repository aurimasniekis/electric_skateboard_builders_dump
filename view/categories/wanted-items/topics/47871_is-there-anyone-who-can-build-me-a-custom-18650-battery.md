Hi guys is there anyone out there who can build me high quality 2* 12s3p batteries with 100Amp constant BMS each and able to ship them to Spain ? 

If there is someone I can send them the dimensions of the battery box they need go fit into .

Anyone help ?

thanks @mmaner for the heads up. Of course, I would be able to do it but with the new baby at home and the dedication it takes to make it, I would suggest @darkkevind as I've seen his craftsmanship quality work and fair price. I even told him on FB to increase them, cause quality and hard work has a price. For UNiK, I'm not building packs, I'm buying the packs to my specs from a real battery company in France (because of insurance). This of course reduce/cancel any margin, but gives you more tranquility (but to be honest, any serious pack builder can achieve the same)

Of course, all the other ones referred here would also be OK !

edit: I forgot my mate @fottaz than can help you too ! great feedback so far and top service. 

Cheers!
