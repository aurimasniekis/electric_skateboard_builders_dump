Hey guys 
I wanna start a copycat build of the evolve bamboo series but with good cells ( VTC6 or konion maybe 30Q ) better motors and FOCBOX. I basically just need the deck enclosure and truck 
The rest is garbage to me
If you have a completely dead GT please tell me ?

As you know, Evolve original enclosure and super curve trucks can be purchased from the website.
However, Evolve original enclosure can only be placed up to 10s4p cells..

My friend sells VESC mount which fits Evolve original enclosure.

Good luck!

I tried but if you are not evolve customer they wont let you buy parts you have to prove you are an evolve customer ! 
In the and i think i’ll have to find someone willing to buy parts for me 
Even the trucks they won’t accept...

I've got proof of purchase of an evolve Bamboo GT so i can order for you if you need, but what parts do you need and budget? I bought an extra semi-complete Bamboo I could maybe sell if the price is right and I can find a good way to ship.

Always come up with a story and picture of a broken thing, never tell them you are going to use their stuff for a DIY.
