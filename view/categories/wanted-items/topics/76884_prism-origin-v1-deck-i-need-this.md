I'm looking for this deck, not the V2, but V1. V2 has a rocker which would be difficult to fill for my current enclosure. Pm me if you have one lying around! I'm ok if its used, just gotta see the condition.

Thanks @Skunk, I was able to find a site that sells it so I'm set! Mods do help me close the thread.
