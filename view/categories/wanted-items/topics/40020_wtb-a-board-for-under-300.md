Hey, I wanted a new esk8 as I previously had bought the sucky acton blink for a large sum and I was wondering if anyone is willing to sell me a board under 300 dollars that goes over 20mph and has about 12 mile range. Thx

It's also not a hobby if you sold your car...  If you still use a car, it's a hobby

U could salvage some of the parts from your old board and built a new electric skateboard for $300.    Ppl here r right $300 is not enough and building a board is not cheap. this is an expansive hobby.  I could have purchased a Bamboo GT with all the money I spent on my boards.
