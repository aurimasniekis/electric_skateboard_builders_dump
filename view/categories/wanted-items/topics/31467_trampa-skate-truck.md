I haven't but if you want it for esk8 I would recommend channel trucks, I've read several times that skate trucks (with bushings) shall not really be the best for that,

Ok, understand. If you are not going too fast it could work. But you should use angled risers for proper steering (15 degrees) but if it's a skateboard and no longboard you can mount it at the angled ends. Maybe the cheapest is to buy a used mountainboard on ebay and use the trucks and wheels. Good Luck!

If you are after Trampa gear, just buy it direct... 
http://www.trampaboards.com/

and if you are after angled risers @okp is about to get some made up. Search for [his thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/unik-35-risers-compatible-with-trampa-spring-trucks/31302).
