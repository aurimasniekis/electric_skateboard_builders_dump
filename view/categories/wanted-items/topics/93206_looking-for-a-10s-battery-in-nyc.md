Yo, I'm in NYC for a few days, have a wowgo 2s but couldn't bring the battery on plane.
Does anyone have any spare battery to sell /rent /borrow me till next Tuesday?
I'd love to ride a bit while I am here and visit the city!
And if you travel to Lyon, France someday I would gladly borrow you a board to cruise around as well :slight_smile:
