Putting my first build together with a Loaded Tesseract deck, single motor. I'm in the UK so parts anywhere in the EU should be fine.
Details and parts list here; http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-loaded-tesseract-single-motor-500
Happy with new or used good condition.

The main things I'm looking for are;

Motor - 6374, 190Kv, sensored

Elec - FOCBOX

Motor mount, pully, belt, 12 / 15mm (no 3D prints)

Nano remote

I assume I need some sort of BMS and charger, but haven't done much research on this yet.
I will build a 10s 18650 battery.

Cheers,

You aint sure you need some sort of bms and you are going to build a batt pack??
Not judging.  Just want you to be sure. Battery welding is dangerous.  Be careful
