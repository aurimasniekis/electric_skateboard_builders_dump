I'm looking for this Bestech 10s 80A BMS. [http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html)

Has anyone got a spare one or is anyone interested in buying one? Bestech has a minimum order volume of 2.

I want to use the same specs as @Namasaki  (thanks a lot for your posts!):

Might be out of luck getting that model direct from Bestech anymore.

That thread has a link to [pwrboards](https://pwrboards.com/collections/parts/products/bms-80a) that has a few in stock and located in the EU.
