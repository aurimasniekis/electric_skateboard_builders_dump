Don't waste your time looking for stuff outside Italy when you have a great supplier in that country.... [Eskating](https://eskating.eu) ! The owner is Alberto Ferrer, contact him, he may be able to get you the VESC you need. Not only that but complete e-boards, 100 mm wheels, trucks, pulleys, remotes, and dozens of accesories just there in your own country.

Yes sure, and since I'm going to explode in the current workspace (I'm very full of things and no more space available :D), I'm going to move to a new location soon, I'm getting ready with Eskating to get a new workspace and lots of things,, and I would appreciate a lot if all esk8ers near Verona will visit me there! can't wait, I'm so excited about the new opportunities that the new location will gives to Eskating.
Now I'm based into 1 bedroom transformed into a workspace, and I would still be glad to welcome you here anyway :smile: 

Alberto
