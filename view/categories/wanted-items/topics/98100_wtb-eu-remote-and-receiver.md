I have  spare mini remotes lying around (Same ones as linked). In the UK.

I think i'll start a webshop at some point for remotes, because people lose them and it takes weeks to ship them out from china, sucks for everyone. 

I'll also have a couple flipsky VX1 remotes some time soon (around the 15th i hope)
