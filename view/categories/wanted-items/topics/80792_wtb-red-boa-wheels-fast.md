I need a set of red boa wheels, pretty fast. I have everything else ready to for a new build using a LY Top speed that @Sender skinned for me.

I have the SR TKP drive train built, the FocBox's configured and the battery pack. All the bits and pieces are in place. I was gonna use 97mm Flywheels but this thing really needs red wheels. 

Hook a brother up, I'll owe you a favor. Thanks

Maybe @b264 still has his test set and you can dye the cores?

That would be cool. The rear will have black retainers anyways, I can print something for the front. 

What say you @b264, you still have them?

There's a funny story with that enclosure. I had fit a switch plate in it in the bottom, the last bottom mount I've done (I don't he side or top now). Mounted it to the deck, got everything running and took it out for a test ride. 

Jumped off a curb, didn't see a rock in the road, which hit squarely on the switch plate.  Was so mad I stripped it all down and built another board üòÄ.

That's got to be wounding man! I hate shit like that.  My mate restored a car once, we are talking nut and bolt restore here.  On the way to the MOT station he crashed it and it set on fire...
