So I have my Evolve GTX electric skateboard with 200kv motors on. (Long story as to why). The heat buildup isnt substantial, it does get hot though and I'm looking to get rid of as much heat as possible. I know electronics and heat do not mix so I'm looking for someone who can CNC machine a new heatsink that fits the evolve GTX. Same size as the original heatsink, just bigger and the longest fins possible and looking for the material to be either aluminum or copper. I can provide measurements and pictures if need be. Please give me quotes on turn around time as well as pricing. Thanks
