I've never had a problem buying from Hobby King. 
One time I got 2 bad Lipo packs in a shipment and I contacted them via online chat and sent them a couple pics and they promptly sent me 2 new batteries and I didn't have to return the bad ones.

I have never had a problem with hobby king. I just ordered (2) 5000mAh 6S 30C for $40 a piece.
So $80 for a 12s setup. 18650 packs are waaaaaay more expensive, around $$300- 400 for 12s.
Lipo OR 18650 packs can catch fire, your cell phone,l laptop, vape, etc can burst into flames.

It's also a matter of life and safety, lion will last much longer, and they are in a metal cam so unless punctured the have to be shorted which is pretty hard to accidentally do if you know what ur doing, Lipos are good if u want power and are on a budget but if you think u can afford li ion you will only be gaining not losing

You generally have to really abuse quality 18650s to reach catastrophic failure.  I'm an esk8 noob, but coming from e-bikes/RC/vape nation/etc, I know I would have started some fires if I treated my lipos like I have some 18650s.

There is still an argument to be made for going w/ lipos ($$ or higher discharge rates, etc), but 18650 packs have other advantages as well (more stable, more durable (physically), BMS/charging advantages, much better charge/discharge ratings, and I believe they now generally have higher power density (kwh/kg) ratings, as well).

Yes, they both _can_ burst into flames, but, IMO, that's kind of a myopic way to look at it when comparing them.  There's more to it than whether or not they are capable of catching fire.
