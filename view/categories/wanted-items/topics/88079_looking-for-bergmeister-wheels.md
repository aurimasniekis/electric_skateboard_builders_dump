This is what I find : 
![CaptureHW|690x415](upload://zYrTuZKN9qR4rna0H71g1cAsOWC.jpeg) 
So I could put the set at 150€, so you get the set at +/-200€ shipped ?

If I refer about the delay noted here (_détails_ on the pic), it says _J+3_ , it's D+3 I guess, so it says about 3 days for the faster to 10 days for the longer I would say...
