Hi, I'm interested in buying a firefly remote and am wondering if anyone takes orders for these or do I just have to buy it used off someone else.

You can just buy all parts and build your own or ask @rey8801 I think he still make them.
I think I also have a set with all electronics laying around just in case.

If you are still interested in buying a Firefly remote, I plan on making a few batches of them this summer. I am an engineering student looking to make some extra dough this summer alongside my Co-Op. I want one myself and know it would be smart to help meet the high demand for this remote for some other people. I plan on making them to order once I am done with this semester. Let me know if you would be interested. Thanks.

I have one that is like 95% built, I am just finishing up on coding the one I have almost done.

Edit: I don't plan on using it and it's gonna go up for sale.

If anyone still has a remote for sale please let me know as I’m interested. 

Also some advice on a good ESC to hook it up with would be of great help. Something similar to the Foc Box unity without connection issues. 

Thanks
