Those ones are Alter bags, I didn't link because it's pre-order at the moment. They look sweet though.

With an mtb like that there's really no excuse not to just ride it everywhere you go.

of course. I usually never carry boards on my back except when I decided to also bring with me a Leiftech or a street skateboard.

I bought the bag at full cost on the first batch to support them and also cause I liked the look of it. I took it for a ride and then decided to take some shots to test some fits.
