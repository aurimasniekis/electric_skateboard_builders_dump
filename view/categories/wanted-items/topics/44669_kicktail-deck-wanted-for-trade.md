I have a traditional longboard deck here and I want to trade it for a kicktail longboard deck, I just can't skate without being able to pump or manual turn like on my penny board. Looking for something like this.

I have this 42inch deck for trade or other esk8 components. Please comment if you are interested.

I am looking more for a maple deck and straight edges. Again I don't want to spend money 'cause I am kind of broke. :money_with_wings:

I only need the deck and I don't feel really safe on self-propelling crusiers. :stuck_out_tongue:
