so I have an upcoming build for a 13s10p on a hummie deck so I need the deck cutout to be widened to fit 10 cells wide, just wanted to know if anyone here could do it.

How the hell are you going to fit a 13S10P under a hummie deck ????
I can't even imagine the absurdity

10 cells wide by 7 cells long at the bottem and 6 cells long on the second layer

Yeah a 6 stack enclosure too, You'll need a ladder to jump on the board
and when you crash it's the height that breaks you not the speed :joy::joy:

```
7 + 6 = 13s

7 cells long = 26 cells wide

and 26 cells fit in the hummie deck sing stack so.....

removing that much materials on the board might weaken it a lot, I don't know how wide the hummie deck is but you'll need a 20cm wide gap for 10 cells !

If you would provide a drawing/model of what you wanted i could do it for you. I am a medical machinist and work withing .001" tolerances all day. I can get you a cost once a drawing or model is provided. Thanks

slot widened
[/quote]

yes i need the cutout widened to a certain point, i want to keep the back half of the cutout the same so i can maintain the most amount of structural rigidity

Ok. Yes it sounds doable, Maybe try uploading the photo u just posted, and with microsoft paint or a phone app, try to draw the geometry u are wanting cut out. I can use the dimesions you verbally asked for, but i would like a visual as to what you are wanting before a cut is made.

until that black line i want the cutout to be 190mm wide

the point from the begging of the cutout to the end of the cells is around 475mm long

Gotcha. Yeah i could do it clean with our mill, i could cut it with a square endmill or a ball endmill for a rounded inner corner for cells to fit more snug. Id charge you around $100, assuming no tools break which they shouldnt but if so you would cover the tooling ($10-$15). You cover shipping. I may even have some carbon fiber strips to epoxy in place to help with strength after the cut is made.

its a 12 ply deck
[/quote]

Not after this operation 

[quote="AlanZhou, post:11, topic:89352"]
plus there is cf on top
[/quote]

The deck needs torsional strength from the CF layer being pulled not pushed hence if you are going to make this shopping trolley mess, start off with an extra(or even 2) of CF on the bottom

The CF on top is mostly looks

Spelled "it's" if it's acting fine {adjective} or "its" if it owns the fine {noun} and can be sent to a collection agency if it remains unpaid.  I don't think the deck is being charged, so "it's" would be correct.  You can easily remember because if you can substitute "it is" in place of it, then you need the apostrophe for the missing letter.

Seriously though, carbon fiber on the top of a deck is for looks only and does very, very little to stiffen a deck.  Carbon fiber on the bottom layer is night-and-day.  It's a serious, serious stiffener.  On the top it's mostly cosmetic.  Unless you stand on the deck and it wants to flex up towards the sky...

I meant 12 ply on the side where it isn't cut. And I know the cracks on top is just for looks, I found that out because the cf was breaking in stands
