Hi all,

A while ago on the forum i saw someone had made a black XT90 Loop Key, it was quite thicker than normal and looked nice.

If you have any links where i can buy it would be appreciated.

Thanks

The connector itself was black? Otherwise you can juyt 3D print this

It was all black, even the wires ontop and the connector.

That looks sweet!

It's probably just anecdotal experience, but the black xt60/90s that I used had extremely tight tolerances, and probably wouldn't make for that great of a plug as it was very very difficult to plug in and unplug

If you want the all-black look I would go for a regular yellow amass xt90 and spray paint the outside
