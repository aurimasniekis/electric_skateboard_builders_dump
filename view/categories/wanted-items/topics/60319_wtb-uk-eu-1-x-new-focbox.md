Do you have any intress in buying one from eneretion now when focboxes are on sale? I could probably join in on 1 box and split the shipping/tax to uk..
I'm waiting on you to restock on a few things in your store so would save a buck on combined shipment to me.

I don't really want to buy directly from Enertion as hell knows when I am going to receive it, as I need it now as my board is not working and I am tired of public transport.

P.S. I am living in UK, the shop is located in Lithuania :) So even if you order I will not be able to combine the shipping for you :)

I might have one tucked in a corner. (Sat there since the Black Friday deal when I waited so long I had no idea why I wanted all this stuff)
I’m away from home at the moment. 
I can check tomorrow night. 
If I’ve got it I’ll send it out and you can send me something nice in aluminium?
