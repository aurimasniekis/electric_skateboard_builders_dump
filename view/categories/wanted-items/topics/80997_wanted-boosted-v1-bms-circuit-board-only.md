Hey, I've got a fried circuit board I want to replace.

Has anyone got a dead v1 BMS they'd be willing to open up, cut the cables off and sell?

same as this:

(I took this photo from another post on here, I hope they don't mind)

I’m going to tell you, getting boosted v1 parts is a pain in the arse, you’ll be lucky if you find one

Yeah it has been. Is there much demand for boosted board without a functioning bms? The rest of the board I have is fine.
