Can someone suggest some good 90mm flywheel clones (preferably black) in EU or with non-expensive shipping to EU?

Thanks

I have some premium flywheel clones on my store. They are $10 off and I'm sure we can work something out if the shipping is too high.

I do 👍🏻. I think the earth should introduce free global shipping worldwide 🙏🏻 . . . Except for North Korea 🤔
