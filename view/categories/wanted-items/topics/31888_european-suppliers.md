For standart longboard parts there are you can use regular longboard shops like sick boards or longboardshop.eu.
If you are talking about bulk order, well i dont know anything about it.

Banggood.com is not a European shop but they deliver for free to EU and i had never any problems with them. Delivery time when you choose free shipping is around 3 weeks.

Also you should check punitive duty, in germany its 19 % for everything above 22 Euro.

sure, can you send a quick email to contact@unikboards.com so my mate Benjy can tell you the exact date as he manages the stock. It's like in 2/3 days maximum if I'm correct but worth double checking with him. Would be able to cover:
- trucks/mounts caliber : whatever color
- timing belt HTD5M 265mm 15mm
- antispark switch
- motor mount 
- abec 11 flywheels (whatever your size)
- remote receiver

My riding style is 32T 15T on 10S so I didn't produce 36T drivers (I do have 32T in stock)

Cheers

I ordered caliber trucks from a shop blue tomato couple weeks ago, if you sign to mail list you get 10 euros voucher, and when you sign up if your birthday happens to be that day :wink: also you will receive a 10 euro voucher via email for your birthday so I got 20 euros off!

is free delivery for order over 40 euros that was to the uk also.

I've got this one that has been sitting in my desk drawer if you can't find one. It's probably done 50-100km as a single drive on 9s. It has the right size plug for the vesc. 
Just curious. Why do you need it to be sensored?

on which one, sorry bro. Shipping is fast; last time (when we did the mount give away) it took 3 days to go from Paris to Toronto. For the mount, it does not work if you reverse it.

You don't need sensored motor for FOC. You can use motor with and without sensor for FOC. I am riding without. But there are other advantages of sensored like smooth startup and some have temperature sensor as well.
