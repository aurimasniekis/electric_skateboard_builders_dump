Looking for maybe 1-2 broken VESC controllers (also FOCBOX) with busted DRV chips (only, no other board problems). 

If you have some gathering dust and want to turn them into $$ drop me a line.

Also might be interested in a busted soft switch board, the kind that works with a momentary power button for on/off..

PM me :slight_smile:
