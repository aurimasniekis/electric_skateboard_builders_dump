I’m looking for a 12S Charger but don’t want to wait a month or pay $60 for shipping, does anyone have one I could buy?

Does this fit your charge port?

I don’t have one yet, I would buy according to the charger. But my battery is 12S3P so this would take a while to charge

You want a 4amp 12s charger. I got mine from TB but now I'm on the hunt for a good 6-8amp charger for my 12s8p

12s full charge voltage is 50.4 (4.2 * 12) so you'll need this one if you go with hummie's suggestion:

i think the 48v adjustable can just get up to 50 but it's for sure safer to get the 60v...actually thats the one i have.

ive found the led gauge to be off by .2 volts on mine.  not bad and the knob and screen are a huge plus compared to the typical tiny screw slot these are often adjusted with.

ive written before..ive broken so many of these but not because they are bad but because im always dropping them or they fall over or off a table when the board falls over or something.   its very worth mounting the thing to a wall or ceiling and having a very long charge cord so it doesnt get pulled or dropped.   (broken some pulling the cords out and shorting them too)

theyre "interesting" to get wired and come with no instructions and you need to find a 3 prong plug somewhere to hook it to..in the right spot, and you need to add the other wire going to the battery too.  not hard but no instructions.

I considered one of these while back cause of the adjustability. Some even have a potentiometer for current. However what stopped me was the exposed main wires. Did you make some sort of enclosure for your setup?

They do have a plastic guard that covers the wires.  If u mount the unit on a wall or ceiling it would be hard to have a problem

I saw the one with a current knob too but it was 200$ n does 20 amps. I want it.  I bet 20 amps is possible w the 30q at its lowest soc till maybe 50% n no prob and I was recently posting info on over-currenting cells for their better health as it can smoothen dendrite formation.  Ironically high current can make cells safer and reduce capacity loss.

question is can the bms do 20a.

these small charge only modules are like 10a max, often times 4a max.

This is how I wire it up. Cut up a computer power cable.

But I use this to feed a hobby charger or one of those DPS psu things, not to direcly feed a pack.

Oops didn't show the actual connections. Copper ring terminals, crimped with an antique high quality crimper.

![15333967162051533564383|666x500](upload://qxiK8e3nvdEfcSgyQLqxVquUaFn.jpg)

Another example. This one is 20a so I tripled up on the output. 4mm bullets on everything as that's compatible with test leads for multimeters and lab psus. Stackable banana plugs, etc, makes everything super flexible.

If I were to use this kind of thing for portable charging I'd probably 3d print or make from wood an endcap and bumpers.

nice crimp tool.  definitely safer than a bare wire in there.   i found one that literally melds the metal together but was like 6000$ from Germany i think.

Definitely too complicated, and not portable. My charger is busted. Need a new one. Did you find a solution?

Nice user name btw. I think you bought a BMS from me this weekend lol

@mikenyc Thanks lol. I did buy the bms off you. Ernesto didn’t respond and I still haven’t found anything because shipping is either too expensive or takes too long for everything online. I think I’m just gonna go for the one with the shortest shipping time I can find. I’ll lyk when I do find something though.

Ok. Before you do that let me see if I can get them locally. I need one as well

I feel like I wasted my money getting a 48v 5amp setup b/c I can't do 12s. Next one will be a higher voltage and 15amp capable.  I should have just spent a little more to start with. I don't think I can kill any dendritic formations with only 5 amps either.

doesnt it have a little screw that you can adjust the voltage with?  all of them I've had including meanwells have it.  the screw slot is rediculous and much prefer the knob.  even if it didnt i bet if you look on endless-sphere there's people who've done all types of mods.

"A" suffix are the adjustable ones. 

All hope is not lost, DPH5005 (not DPS) is buck-boost. 50v not 50.4v. Is it thowing good money after bad?

4.1666666666666666666666666666666666
per cell seems good to me.    but maybe you can adjust even the non-adjustable and bet on endless-sphere theyve done it.

The thing is many bms don't kick in the balancing at 4.166666666666666666 :(

You might be right about the adjustment. Maybe they have the trim pots inside.
