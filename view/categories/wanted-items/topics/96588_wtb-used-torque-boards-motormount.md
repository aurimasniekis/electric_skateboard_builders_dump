Why only TB ?
If it's just for TB 218, caliber mount will do, Dickho's mount is good and cheap (on ebay)

@boardnamics mounts are cheaper and stronger.

2 of them is still cheaper than 1 tb mount

Boardnamics has 4 pivoting holes allowing for more rotation than the 6 holes in a tb mount. The arm is also thicker aluminum

Yeah I've owned both.
The boardnamics ones also solely rely on an idler for belt tension rather than leaving motor adjustment

I get you like them better, i don't.  I've owned both. Yes boardnamics are great for a budget.  But the tb ones are bettery in my opinion and experience.

Am I alone in thinking Dickyho's newer thicker mounts are better than TB? Dual idler, cross bars, thiccc and it has traditional tensioning.

I donâ€™t want to sell just 1. Itâ€™s a set and will make it harder to sell the remaining one later.
