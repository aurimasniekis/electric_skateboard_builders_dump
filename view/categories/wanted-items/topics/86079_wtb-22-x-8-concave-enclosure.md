My space cell pro enclosure finally gave up the ghost and I need a replacement. For some reason, it's pretty hard to find. Wondering if anyone is able to make me a custom or refer me to somewhere that has a suitable enclosure. Willing to pay top dollar for a quality enclosure!

Needs the following:
* 22 x 8 external dimensions (rectangular)
* at least 21 x 5.75" internal dimensions
* small concave to fit my Hi5ber overtaker deck
* non carbon fiber

If you want the enertion space cell enclosure shape, I gave one to @Sender to skin.  If you can work out a price with him you can have the enclosure gratis.
