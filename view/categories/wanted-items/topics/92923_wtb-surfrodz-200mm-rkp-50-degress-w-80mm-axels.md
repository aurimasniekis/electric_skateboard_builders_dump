Looking to buy the truck from the title. All black or raw would be my preference but not picky on color.

Was about to buy from Surfrodz.com but shipping to Canada is $55 so trying other sources first.

The HAYA deck is coming soon! Only thing missing now are the trucks. I will pay full price which might be good if you scored some for $99 during the sale last year.

I'm also looking to buy TB 218mm trucks for another build.
