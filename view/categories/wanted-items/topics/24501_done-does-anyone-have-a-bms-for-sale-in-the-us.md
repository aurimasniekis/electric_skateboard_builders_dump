Hey guys. I'm pretty sure my BMS for my 10S4P Samsung 22R went out. It doesn't charge the batteries fully anymore (39.5 volts) and I also can't use it for discharge due to it shutting down the power when I brake too hard. Just wondering if someone has a 10S 60amp Supower BMS for sale in the states. I searched and couldn't find any here so far so I thought I'd create this post. This is the one I have right now http://www.ebay.com/itm/36V-37V-42V-10S-60A-Lithium-ion-Li-ion-Li-Po-LiPo-Polymer-Battery-BMS-PCB-System/221769582503?_trksid=p2045573.c100033.m2042&_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D41375%26meid%3Da91e418d0ed84a3d82630b4b5c8535ab%26pid%3D100033%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D7%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D221769582503. I really don't want to wait a month to get a replacement. Summer is here. Fingers crossed!!!

i am also looking for a 10s bms and a 6s bms. I know you don't want to wait a month but if you end up ordering I would buy the second one from you.
