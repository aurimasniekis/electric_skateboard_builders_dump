Anyone selling 2 vesc 6 or focbox in uk? 

Also pulleys and belt for a trampa mountain board ? idk what would be a good ratio?? 

Also looking for an enclosure for a trampa board in uk ?? im thinking of 10s4p with a besttech bms. Would be better to keep batteries under or ontop of the board ? 

Thank you.

Check Trampa website for Pulleys and Belts
Go for 12S on Mtb with a Vesc
Better mounting on top if you wanna do serious jumps
