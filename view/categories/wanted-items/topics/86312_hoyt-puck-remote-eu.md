Because they refused to sell to EU customers when it was released.
Might have changed in the meantime, so best to ping them a message.

I'v used the mini remote for about a year and a half and it has been flawless. battery lasts forever so thats a bonus. probs about 300-400 miles worth of riding (not a ton but not nothing either)

Why not just to use a forwarder like shipito or similar?

If youre just after reliability get a mini and don't look back. If you want hoyt sexiness get someone in the U.S. to forward it to you.

Or better yet. @DerelictRobot could shit one out for you?
