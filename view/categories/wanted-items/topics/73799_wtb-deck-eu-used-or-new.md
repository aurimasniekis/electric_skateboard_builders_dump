Im located in EU, Croatia, and im putting together a board. Im getting HK Caliber trucks and flywheel clones and i need a deck. Is anyone selling their deck, or knows a good place to buy a cheap deck? Im planning to spend not more than 50$ on deck (i know its not much, dont hate :) )

I picked up a few boards in that price range. should be doable, just got to be patient to find what you want.

Should be a good one.
If I wouldnâ€™t just have ordered an other short deck I would get that loaded.
@Sender already received his kut thaka as far as I remember and he like it a lot.
