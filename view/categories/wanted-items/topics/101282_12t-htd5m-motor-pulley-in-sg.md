Hi anyone from SG know where I can get 12T HTD5M motor pulley 8mm bore with keyway (3mm)? I found one on diyeletricskateboard

https:///collections/motor-pulleys/products/12t-htd5-20mm-motor-pulley

but... the shipping to SG is USD40 which is insane...

or if anyone from SG is buying from diyelectrictskateboard and wants to share the shipping?

many thanks
