Seeing of how many stories I see of people blowing VESCs,and that I managed to blow my FVT 120a ESC (story here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/rewiring-esc-capacitors/3532/9). I am looking for a new ESC and I am looking to possibly saving some money by buying one that has the infamous blown MOSFET controller, and replacing it myself. Can't quite afford a new ESC, so I realize it's a bit of a gamble, but at least I will come out with more soldering experience!

TL;DR buying broken VESCs please consider telling me what happened when you broke it and a price.

thanks,
