Hello,

I oredered 12 days ago a VESC on this website : http://www.vesc.co.uk/
But I never received it, and they don't answer my emails ... :frowning: 

Does someone has any experience from this company ?

I was thinking first it was UK company, but realized it's a Lithiuanian company.., 
I hope it's not a fake ! Damn, I should have order in Germany from esk8.de !!

Some of the reviews indicate some similar situations to yours.

If it were me, if they haven't responded within a week of asking for more information, I'd contact my credit card or paypal and start a chargeback.

I second you! Get your credit card company involved, this is business! Let us know how it went.
