I have 10s5p 30Q pack with Bestech charge/discharge BMS. Bought from Streetwing.
Little used. Charge port, on off switch (through the BMS) and battery level indicator.
Was used on an Evo 39" build. I'll be back at home in a week and can take more photos if interested.![833171A1-91F6-4356-8B61-C877E4775F7C|375x500](upload://6V8CjXPFPldkxMMCk78ZZwWp4hg.jpeg)
