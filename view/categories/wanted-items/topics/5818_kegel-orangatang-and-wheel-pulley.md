I'm looking to buy 1 orange kegel orangatang and a wheel pulley if anyone has one.
I've looked in all the UK suppliers and don't seem to be able to get one single sold to me.
Other options I've come across seem to more than double the cost with the shipping.
Cheers

Don't know whether you've checked them out, but esk8.de carries solid pulleys. They are located in Germany, so don't know if that'll work for you.

Hi yep, I had seen them. Thanks for flagging them up.
The wheels are sold separately which works for me. But shipping to the UK for one wheel is estimated at 17 Euro. The pulleys are 56 Euros but out of stock...
