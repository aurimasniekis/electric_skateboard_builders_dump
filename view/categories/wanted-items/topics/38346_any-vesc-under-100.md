Use the search function. @torqueboards sells a vesc for $100 that I use. 

Hereâ€™s some cheaper ones: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sale-2x-flier-vescs-4-12-for-60-each-or-100-for-both-paris-trucks-eu-world/35989

You're trying to save $20-30 on arguably the most important component, which could injure you if it fails...

Hey, you really don't need to be this rude, I am trying to save 20-30$ because I am on a tight budget. If the VESC is good I don't see why not buy it used if it works well

Its not that I don't get it, it's that you are being outright rude by saying "that VESC is garbage", it'd be fine just to say "that's not a great VESC, maybe consider buying one new"

For $100 just get the TB VESC. I've updated mine to 3.31 fw running FOC on 6s and it's been great for 250-300 miles.

the new ones are pretty good. The truth in this hobby is that you get what you pay for.

i guess you can buy used but its always a little sus. My first VESC was used and failed for absolutely no reason.

The thing about the VESC platform is that (to my understanding, correct me if im wrong), in theory, if a VESC is functioning correctly, then it should perform exactly the same as any other VESC. Some are built to higher standards and thus are expected to be able to handle being driven harder (FOCBOX, Ollin) but any vesc should be fine.

that being said, i've only put maybe 20 miles on my Maytech so far so i guess we'll see how long it lasts. I can tell you it performs really well right now though.

The problem is companies use cheap,subpar, lower spec components on vescs, vescs of the same version are far from identical between makers

Maytechs can literally be missing components(still functioning)

Focbox and ollin vesc all use upgraded components compared to the standard 4.12 bom
It's not necessarily how theyre built, it's the components that make a diff

Why didn't you just ask for a $70-80 vesc? You asked for <$100. The TB vesc is a value at $99.99<$100. If you ask Dexter nicely he may even give you free shipping. I have 3 of these vescs and they have been great running both BLDC and FOC on single and dual hubs and belts using can.

I second this, Iâ€™ve been running one for a year, and as long you set it up right, itâ€™s very reliable. 
Itâ€™s worth the extra $20 to get one. Thatâ€™s like a week or two worth of coffee. Itâ€™s worth it.

For an enclosure I'm going to use spraypainted tuperwares, can't go much cheaper than that. And for the batteries I don't have a spot welder so there's nothing I can really DIY

I'm using a Maytech VESC in conjunction with a enertion VESC at 12S with my dual 90mm hub motors in BLDC hybrid mode and they've both been working very well for about 50 miles so far. To be fair I don't really have hills near where I live so not much high current hill climbing for me but even hard acceleration and high speed amp draw it handles well (nearing just under 60K ERPM's as well at full speed.)
