You can also jump on GB for tayto and get the pulleys only.

I might be interested by one of your pulley, but it depends on the price of it ?
How much would it be for a single pulley, including shipping to france ?
Thank you !

@BigBrit Thanks for the offer but I'm looking for aluminium one(s). Plus I have a 3D printer myself :wink:

@Grozniy That's a nice idea but I'll wait if someone maybe has a used and cheap pulley since it would be going to a budget friendly build I'm doing for my friend.

These pulleys require at least 47mm axle. Bkb pulleys can be mounted on regular 37mm axle

Fair. And anodized. They both have their up sides.

These are in Europe. Fat boys have more hanger clearance if that matters to you. Or it’s more that the hanger can go into the pulley a little.

Hi there

I have a pair of 15mm 36T just finishing on the printer, so could ship this type right away.

Just order from bkb or torqueboards in US or cut off some hangar to use the Fatboy pulleys, cutting the hangar is not that hard

If you have your own printer just print a pair of Nylon ones.. they last forever and if it's really a budget build then your only cost is your materials.

Aren't those @JuniorPotato93 pulleys from thingiverse? You are not allowed to sell these according to the license for anything more than pure print cost.
