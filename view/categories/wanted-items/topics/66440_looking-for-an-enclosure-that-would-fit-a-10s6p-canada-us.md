Hmmm I just can't seem to find a good board that would be adequate for the enclosure, I am running 95mm hubs right now so I have room to get something unique along with it.
Wait Hummie is still selling his decks? and they fit 10s6p??

No enclosure included but a few of @psychotiller enclosures fit great.

Do you have the battery already made? I make enclosures for the hummie deck but like the psychotiller one they fit a 10s5p with dual focbox. The battery should be flexible too as the deck is curved and the deck flexes a little. I will have a dual stack enclosure in the works for these so potentially you could fit a much larger battery in than you were thinking. There ways to go about it is to mount the escs topside and use the underside solely for batteries.

That's what I'm doing.  Flatpack 12s5, focbox topside.

I have a battery made with it being harnessed together for my charge only BMS. The batteries are 1s6p connected in series but shrinked and already made together. So I am stuck with a 10s6p and I want to be stuck with it, it's so much power.

Pics?
Dimensions of the battery might help determine what will work for you.

each of my batteries are 118x66x18mm, I need at least like 2-3mm of clearance to put my harness in (as all my packs are connected together via xt60s.

I know psycho said he thought his fishbone would fit the hummie deck well.

It's slightly taller then his flat pack enclosure designed for the hummie deck. (The one in pics I posted earlier)

@psychotiller also mentioned the altar burst to go well with the @hummie deck. Thats what I’m having Him mount actually. He’s gonna widen the hole abit more to fit the nese modules I’m planning to put so i could go up to 10s8p easy(supposedly)

Also what is the shipping time or options for the hummy deck @Skunk? I know you are going to receive one, was wondering about how it's being shipped.
