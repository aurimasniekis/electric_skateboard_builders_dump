I am looking for a battery enclosure and vesc enclosure for my new bossted-style vanguard build. It is prefferable with enclosures with similar styling to boosted, but i am open to any design that does not sacrifice more of the flex.

If anyone has enclosures to sell or wants and are able to make it for me I would be very grateful if you would reply below or send me a message!

Dimensions of the 10s3p battery is 4,1cmx17cmx13,7cm
