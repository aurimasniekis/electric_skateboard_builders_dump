Help a brother out,

Unfortunately I dont own a 3D printer yet and the fiancee does not justify buying a Prusa MK3 to print this pulley ðŸ™„. Iâ€™m upgrading my bigfoot wheels to Caguamas and currently looking for some 3D printed nylon 36T Kegel Pulley . Ideally they should be press on to swap them out quickly when I feel like taking them out on a cruise and compatible with stock Caliber II but I have the tools to grind down the hanger. 

I've found some on Miami electric but dont need the motor pulley and have a couple laying around.

I would also consider any reasonable used aluminum for the right price shipped to Los Angeles
 Thanks again!
