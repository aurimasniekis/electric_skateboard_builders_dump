Hey all,

I'm currently working on a scooter build using the Vesc 6 but I need the 8 pin JST PH connector with the fly leads attached. Would anybody have a spare one in Australia I can buy? The only place I can find supply from is China, RS components have the connector but I really don't feel like crimping that small of a JST pin.

Any help would be awesome.

Jeff
