not dangerous, just not reliable. the 10s and 12s ones are crap, the 6s or 8s ones use better components though

I've read that the charger melting itself is a very big concern on 12S. Not something I'm willing to risk.

I have a 12S 6A charger new in the box.  It's a YZ power 50.4v 6A charger.  I can ship it out today or tomorrow USPS Priority Mail for $75 including shipping.  Payment with Paypal goods and services.  Let me know.

Just depends on how many mAh you have. A 3000mAh battery will take two hours to charge. 

3[A*h] / 1.5 [A] = 2 [h]

I don't have the patience to wait that long.
My batteries are 12000-22000 so not practical for me

Well the other options are linked. I honestly didn't fully read the title before I posted. At that level, a desktop variable power supply might be worth the investment

Found out I have a variable for 60V 5A at my work. Might just use it for the time being and order an aliexpress
