Hi, is there any chance to get these wheels for a reasonable price somewhere in EU?
Most of the stores sell them for 184,85€ ( MSPR I guess? ) which is ridiculous.
That's an equivalent of 210 freedom units for our fellow American riders.

Find someone selling lightly/used ones in the US who will ship to you without import tax (Marked as gift, etc) and you get get them for like 120 Euros shipped. I managed to get refly 107s with the text still on them for 111 Euros

I don't really want used ones. 
They would have to be very cheap for me to consider them as an option.

 For 110 Euros? Or pay 60-70 more for ones with solid text on instead :laughing:

You're looking at €180 in Europe new, sure used ones would be cheaper but you have to wait for them to show up if ever.

January sales maybe they drop 10-30%. Get the money together and wait till January, there are a few vendors here who stock them and regularly discount in sales. In sales I have seen them as low as about €135 not inc. shipping
