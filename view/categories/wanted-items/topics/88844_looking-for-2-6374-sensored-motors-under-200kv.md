I have one 6374 turningy 192kv nonsensored motor, it‚Äôs in pretty rough shape as it‚Äôs traveled from @GrecoMan to @Boardnamics to me, in San Diego by the way. I‚Äôd let it go for cheap

It works perfectly, chrome paint is almost all gone, I put masking tape on it so it could look better lol, also if you want it, I recommend resoldering everything

Unsensored works fine, as long as you're going at least 1mph.  You can't start from a stop unless you kick-push.

I dont know if your interested in new ones, but the updated flipsky ones have been working well for me for nearly 500miles so far. They are covered in mud and scratched to pieces. Im pretty impressed
