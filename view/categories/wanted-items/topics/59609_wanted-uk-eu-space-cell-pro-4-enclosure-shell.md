Can another more robust solution interest you? 
@WARMAN replaced his with one of my enclosures and I think it worked pretty well for him.

Yeah @bigben enclosure works well and I have the extra room to upgrade when my 10s3p gives up! 
But if your just gonna run slim packs go for his lower profile one.
