Hey Guys,
I got a set of new good quality motors right 2 days before my Holiday trip to Spain! Because i had no mini usb cable i rode the board for only 2 kilometers than one of the DRVs on one VESC died!

Im currently on my way to Spain in France, if anyone of you got a spare VESC that i can buy, that would be awesome!!! 

(sorry about the crude english im on hurry)
