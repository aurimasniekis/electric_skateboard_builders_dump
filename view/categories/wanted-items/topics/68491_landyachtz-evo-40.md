Hi all, looking for a Landyachtz Evo 40" deck (the "Skate and Explore" deck.)

Condition is not super important, as long as there aren't any serious dings or missing wood pieces. 

Looking for just the deck, no enclosure, etc.

Located in Dallas, TX, USA.

Thanks!

I haven't got any LY Evo deck, nor I have sold anyone ever before, I also don't remember talking to you yesterday @craj1031tx are you sure you didn't talk to someone else? :open_mouth:

Ha I was a bit hesitant to create a thread for this in the first place, out of fear for just cluttering up the forum even more with a single use thread...and then this happens, which is all good and funny...AND THEN Eboostin goes and posts in Eboosted's enclosure thread :joy:
