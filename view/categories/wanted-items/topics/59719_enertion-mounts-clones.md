Iv spoke to the guy I bought them off,he's made upgrades since to them but these are useless to me and they wasn't cheap,I'm hoping to get some compensation at least towards new ones so won't post anything yet!

I've got these ones if your interested?

Unfortunately the design is really basic and doesn't allow for angle adjustments or rear mounting

Thanks for the offer but the reason I'm after enertion style ones is because the double clamping fits better than just the one bolt.
The mounts I have actually pivet too far towards the board and that's what caused the motor to move hit two phase wires and cost me even more money for a drv repair.
Those mounts do say 1.5mm may need to be shaved off caliber trucks and my TB 218' are 1mm thicker.

A bit pricey but I got my all black enertion clones from Miamielectricboards but he ships fast and they are good quality. I'm using 4 of them in my evo build.

I think those numbers are exaggerated a little to make sure the buyers knows what they are getting into

100 â‚¬ for a pair of generic mounts it's a rip-off!

I mean this design specially is on thingiverse and holds up really fine with PETG, for almost no costs
At this price point money is better spent with Okp's design. 
But you are right to each their own!

Enertion mounts are the best I've used so far they never get loose or move around you set it and forget it

I am working on a mount with double clamp design. Not sure if I should make it compatible with 50xx motors or just keep it simple an only support 63xx motors. Optional pulley. Forward and rearwards mountable. Holes instead of slots for zero movement.

Rough mockup:

Looks good I think most people use 63mm now,the double clamp is way better its a shame there's not more on the market! 
Holes are a much better design to change angle as mine with slots slipped hit 2 phase wires and cost me a drv error!

Did you find anything?

Might make my own mounts, but there will be a 3-4 week wait unfortunately

Hoping the seller of my mounts is going to send me the updated clamps which fit way tighter on torqueboard's 218s and no movement which has really been my only issue with them.

I ended buying 4 Miami Electric motor mounts for my 4wd build  to then realize they won't work with my enclosure so I purchased TB reverse mount set up. I'm keeping 2 of the Miami Electric mounts that I used a bit for another build and I'm selling the 2 brand new never mounted ones if anyone is interested.
