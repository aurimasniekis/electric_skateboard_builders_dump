Do you need a particular KV 6354? I have some 260 kv ones. Better for lower voltage packs.

Thanks,

I bought those 6354 motors about a month ago which were set to ship this month. They got pushed back another month since I think he's taking a vacation- so that's why I'm here.

I might go for the other parts, but another month+ is a little too long of a wait if it's the same deal. Our summers are short here in Chi-town.
