Looking for anyone, preferably in the US, to sell me a used motor they got laying around. In particular, a 6354 or a powerful 50mm motor. Not looking for a top of the line 6374 motor that can haul a truck. I am fairly light, 160lbs and not an insane rider. It will be running on 10s. Nothing too insane but not under powered at the same time. A sensor would be a big plus for me. I don't care about the connector type.

Gimmie any offers you got :D
