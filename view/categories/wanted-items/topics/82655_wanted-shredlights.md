Need some front and back shredlights for my board, preferably with the mounts. Not looking to spend much money, but PM me what you have

If you donâ€™t have money for the original than just get other lights.
There multiple other, cheaper versions available.

I bought some of amazon, and I ran in to a bush, and they snapped off the trucks. Bought the koowheels lights, they werenâ€™t bright at all

Your best bet for cheaper shredlights are on Black Friday. Good luck.

Shredlights aren't that great. Definitely not worth the price tag. I still use them but wouldn't buy again

I know there are a lot of people saying there is nothing better than shredlights, but there also people like I which didnâ€™t have had so much luck with them. 
One light the switch broke after 5x charging
One two others the ring in the gummy cover broke after I took them off the second time.
The brightness of the lights are honestly also just average. They good that people see you, but not good enough that you really see enough if you fast on the way.
Just my opinion, others may see that different.

Iâ€™m just looking to buy them, because apparently itâ€™s illegal in Cali to not have lights and reflectors. I was riding the other day in downtown SD, and a cop waved me down. He told me these rules, and Iâ€™m not trying to get a ticket.

Itâ€™s not a stupid rule.
Lights and reflectors save lives ðŸ˜Œ

Bright but just about acceptable , but I tried my mates shred lights and they were very very good
