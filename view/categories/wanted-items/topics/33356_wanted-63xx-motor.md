The motors come with 3x female 4mm bullet connectors so you wouldn’t have to purchase them separately

Yes it will if limiting the erpm. I checked and don’t have any male 5.5mm bullet connectors. If you really need the motor you can send me the VESC and I can solder the 4mm bullets on. I can then ship the motor and VESC back at the same time. 

It is a very simple solder connection to make. So maybe a friend could help you out?

Why not just order from @torqueboards if you want a TB motor?
