:laughing:
The deck and wheels alone are worth that much.
Just check how much a loaded vanguard costs you. Good luck.

The deck is 174 euro and the wheels are 70 euro.

Thats not 400 euro in total, but a Boosted V1 isnt worth more then around that price thats what i was offered for my V1 few months ago but its dead.
