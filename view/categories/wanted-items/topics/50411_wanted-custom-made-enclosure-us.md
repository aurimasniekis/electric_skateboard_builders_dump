I am looking for someone who can make me an at least semi-flexible enclosure out of either fiberglass or vacuum formed plastic. The design is roughly 6.5x1.5x27 inches internal, with some variation in a few places. The enclosure is going onto a loaded bhangra and I would like to preserve as much of the flex as possible so more flexible it can be the better.

Here is a tinkercad I made up of the desired shape of the internal mold:

Would be super interested to hear from anyone who thinks they could help.![Eskate Enclosure|690x355](upload://z7yTEKmbdXeSNc4Mhh5YBv5fmVS.png)

I know that Psychotiller makes some great stuff, he does not only enclosures but also other pieces you might need as well.... https://psychotiller.com

Ive actually spoken to psycotiller, his setup is a bit to short to make this in one piece and he is super backed up. Id like to avoid a long wait / a 2 piece enclosure so I decided to see who else was out there.

The one I got from you worked great with 1 motor, but Ive changed ESC's and am trying to add a second motor so its  no longer big enough to hold everything.

@bigben I have bought 4 enclosures from him so far.  They are super durable and look great! Made of fiberglass which I personally prefer over ABS.  Shipping to the US isn't really all that bad.  Maybe an extra $15 or so.  I think in total I paid $70 for each of the enclosures I bought including shipping.

@Weilii 

Flex rules.

I only just read this...

In case you're interested: I offer something similar... I can do it in fibreglass, carbon, whatever composite you want...

I've been working on it since Dec / Jan...
