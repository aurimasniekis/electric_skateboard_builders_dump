My lipos have failed me. For anyone  wondering what happened, just look on my build thread it isn't hard to find. Now what I am looking for is a lithium ion battery but I have a very small amount of space and I am looking for very specific specs. Here they are:
6s2p
Need at least 5000mah capacity
16cm max length 14cm max width 2cm max height
Integrated BMS not needed because I have a balance charger

Am I asking too much? Is a battery like this even possible? 
My budget is around 300$ I can spend more if absolutely needed. Anyone willing to make a pack like this or anyone who knows where I can get a pack like this please speak up
