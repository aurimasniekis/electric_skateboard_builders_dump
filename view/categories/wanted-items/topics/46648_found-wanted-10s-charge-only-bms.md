------------ No longer wanted :yum: ------------

I need a 10S charge-only BMS. Or charge+discharge, I just mean I don't need high discharge amps. If someone has one lying around they could sell me so I don't have to wait 'til the end of Feb to buy one that'd be great! :stuck_out_tongue:

I'm in Australia but I can pay postage from anyway, pretty much.
