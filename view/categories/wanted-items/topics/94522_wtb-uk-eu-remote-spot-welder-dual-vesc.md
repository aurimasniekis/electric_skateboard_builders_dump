**Mainly now looking for the remote. Mine broke in the recent leg breaking fall, but I am on track to ride again in a couple weeks.** 

As in the title. I suppose I'm also looking for nickel strips, shirnk wrap, fishpaper etc but I am assuming I will need to just order those from china. 
I can also swap for some LG HG2 Cells,  A landyachtz Switch and a few other things.
