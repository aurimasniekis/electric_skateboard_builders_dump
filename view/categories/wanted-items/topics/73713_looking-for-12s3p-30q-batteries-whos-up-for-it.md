Looking for someone to build me a 12s3p Samsung 30Q battery and BMS with a double-stack layout to fit in Boosted-style enclosure. I've looked everywhere online but either can't find the right shape or is too expensive.
Let me know what you guys can do!
Thanks.

Please advise me on a quote for the same 12S  Sammy 30Q pack... Same size and shape as the above request..  Although, you could go longer than a boosted pack if needed.  I would prefer to have a flater longer pack size VS. a thicker style pack.  Please advise along with your other request for this same 12s

Oh I just checked out that you are from USA.. shipping will be costly and not worth it? Was thinking about either 30q or sanyo ncr2070.. not sure on second tho, just planning out my first eboard that will include a lot of things from trampa lol

if you're in Europe I know a few builders that may be able to help you out.  Yes, shipping is a nightmare internationally for batteries alone, builds are a bit different because the battery is inclosed.

@pjotr47 is the top battery builder I would go to in Europe and he may know someone closer to you, hit him up

If you want to use a HS11/HoliPro with NCR20700A cells, I suggest you choose this enclosure

I live in the u.s. and would love a pack that was in a case like the one above making it possible to keep the boards flex.  Please advise.

Sure, we can build just about anything. The hs11ds has a lot of room for the battery and electronics

I just tried it on the bench and it works great and test fitting in the deck looks good. ![20190731_140842|690x388](upload://uzm8SLSZQkuP3Q5FwCCPuUXAOiP.jpeg)

Shipping batteries is a task but completes because its enclosed sneak through?
Time to get some deck/enclosure/battery combos going on.

Any more inspiration needed then just ask.  I'm here all week....

Not sneaky, For years Benjamin built systems and shipped them to the Caribbean so while having to deal with 6 different countries (territories) we discovered the best way to navigate the BS that popped up when the Indonesian flight went down.......... hint

I am also interested in a custom pack, I've considered endeavoring to do this myself but am concerned I would completely screw this up. https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/landyachtz-switchblade-40-enclosure/ is the enclosure I'm wanting to use, I believe a 12s5p could fit in flat pack configuration, but am open to suggestions. Can anyone assist me in building the biggest 12s pack for this (while fitting a Unity or Flipsky esc)? I have looked at Psychotillers backs but I'm unsure of ordering something so expensive not knowing for certain the dimensions and if it will fit,

Hey man welcome to the forum.  Update your profile to include a country.  It makes it easier for the right advice.  That switch enclosure is a very nice unit and the deck is a good choice.  @Eboosted does some lovely work and will also make you a battery to go in there if you ask.  You may have issues with shipping though depending on where you are.  Hit Alan up.  Hes a very nice guy but don't tell him I said that.

[/quote]

Het man, get the 12s4P made of 21700 Samsung 30T cells and set the battery discharge at 120A, it's going to be a freaking rocket. If you want more range than torque/acceleration/hill climbing capacilities then choose the Samsung 21700 40T cells.

That's the biggest pack I'd mount on this enclosure.

If you are looking for something within a budget then make a 12s5p made of Samsung 18650 30Q cells.

Hit me up if you want a custom ebox
