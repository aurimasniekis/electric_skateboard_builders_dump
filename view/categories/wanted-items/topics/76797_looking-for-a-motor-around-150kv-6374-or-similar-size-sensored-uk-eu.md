I actually bought an Sk8 149kv and that would be my first choice but they failed to deliver, didn't email me about it, and it's now on it's way back to their Hong Kong warehouse. Want to get this made before I go home for the holidays.

That unikboard motor seems a little expensive too.

But they worth the money. Sealed and great customer service ðŸ˜‰

You can look for alien power system motors.
But they not sealed and have 10mm shaft.
