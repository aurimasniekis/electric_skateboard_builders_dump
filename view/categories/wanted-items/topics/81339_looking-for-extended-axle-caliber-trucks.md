Stick with TB 218mm for now i guess, until the US gets more. There are actually pretty limited uses for ecaliber trucks anyway, most pulleys are insert pulleys at this point.

Donâ€™t really want the extra width. For a smaller board.

Sorry the pulleys that dont need a bearing* My bad. Its usually just another point of failure where a bolt on pulley would work just as well IMO.

I prefer getting them locally (US) but none available.  I might consider getting them from @e.board_solutions.

Bolt-on pulleys are an extra point of failure, because the pulley can become offset and uncentered.  Insert pullies are always perfectly aligned.
