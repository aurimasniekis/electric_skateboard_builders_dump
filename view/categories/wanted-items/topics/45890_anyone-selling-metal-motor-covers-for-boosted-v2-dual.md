3D printed ones will work just as good, at 10% of the price

heâ€™s trying to hide the fact that he nodded the original one, hence the reason he wants an exact replica ðŸ˜‰

You can always design your own who looks pretty much identical if you really want to spend money on it. Or just find up a story about how they broke :wink:

Honestly, your fine with the modified ones.

Boosted doesn't care much about that, together with wheel mods.

I send pictures in of my V1 with modded pulley and Kegel 80s, they didnt say anything other then they were willing to fix it up for the price of the shipping back and forth.

No idea where it is, 2 years since i did it.

But if im not wrong its just the same one used as the V2 speedmod or a normal v2 pulley will work.

No, the new boosted boards use a GT5 bely profile but the v1 has a gt3 profile.
