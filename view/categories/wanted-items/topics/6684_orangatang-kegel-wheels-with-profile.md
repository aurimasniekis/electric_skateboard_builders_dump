Who wants to ride their precious electrical lgboard in rainy weather? (besides maybe Casey Neistat who has disposable income we can only dream of)

Try the SKF bearings they work out great for me.

And they are just 20 euro for 8pcs.

Nice! [Harfang wheels](http://harfangwheels.com). They started a few years back with modified Biggie Hawgs and now have their own wheels. Nice to see the expanding.
