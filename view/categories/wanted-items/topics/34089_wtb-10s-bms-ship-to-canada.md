I bought my bms from supowerbattery111(battery supports) on ebay. The website is good too. http://www.batterysupports.com/lion-lipo-nbsp-36v-nbsp-10s-c-32_41.html
Be warned they are going on holiday starting tomorrow till oct 11th. Maybe you can buy and get shipped today......

Their eBay is empty now because of the holiday and probably because people don't read and will buy anyway then complain about non shipment or slow shipment.

The 30amp is only $34US
