I have bought some parts for my build, but I need the propulsion system/esc now
I have enough connectors and an antispark for the esc. I just needed help to choose the motors/esc

My budget for the everything needed for the motors [i.e belts, mounts, wheels, trucks] (I am open to using hub motors) is $250 (Don't mind 3d printing cost). I am looking for more torque over top speed because I live in SF. I am running a 10s system. I also have a 3d printer to print wheel pulleys, but I prefer not to rely on a 3dp motor pulley or motor mount for a long time. I have already printed a temporary motor mount and I have a way to fix it onto a caliber II truck

Here are the parts I already bought:

2x Batteries (5s1p each [5800mah]): https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5800mah-5s1p-30c.html?___store=en_us

Deck (I also have risers and hardware): http://www.skateshred.com/index.php/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/39-x-9-5-bamboo-drop-through-double-kick-blank-deck.html13

If I was to use a belt system, I would lean towards this 149kv motor: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-149kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us

Esc I could use (It is on ebay too): http://www.diyeboard.com/v11-dual-hub-motors-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-608.html

If belt driven, pref 300mm htd belt: https://www.ebay.com/itm/HTD300-5M-Timing-Belt-Synchronous-Pulley-60-Tooth-PU-Closed-Loop-15mm-Width-New-/401115203967?epid=1593186030&hash=item5d6454497f:g:2ewAAOSwmtJXYSL8

3dp mount:  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2429445 (There are a few more mounts as well) 

3dp wheel pulley: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:545345

are you actually using that plastic mount, or is it a prototype? if the former, it's going to break on you pretty quickly. trust.

$250 is really aggressive if you need a motor, mount, and controller.

If you heat up the PLA in an oven before printing (similar to annealing in metallurgy) it increases the strength of the printed part

I got a set of hub motors for sale. Comes with 2x 90mm front wheels with bearings, 1x front truck, 2x 90mm hub motors and 1x rear truck for the motors.
They are yours for â‚¬120 + shipping.

Been rocking the nylon (taulman 645) motor pulley for about 3 days now so far so good no noticeable problems while riding or visual issues I think it's going to hold up fine really.  Also using the 149kv motor and two 5S in series (only 5Ah though) setup works well for me.  I'd also be worried about the motor mount breaking since I went with a metal one and even with metal ones they can crack if they are crappy metal or too thin since they are stopping the motor from spinning itself around the truck with as much force as it takes to push the wheel around and move your butt forward.

That said can just ask @solidgeek if it's held up :slight_smile:

I decided to go with the same motors that the Riptide board uses: https://www.ebay.com/i/322549102279?chn=ps&dispItem=1
 I plan to build another board soon for someone. I'll make sure to PM you guys if you still have the parts when I start the new build. Thanks For The Help!
