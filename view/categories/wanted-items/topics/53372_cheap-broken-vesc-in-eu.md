Not the best idea to go cheap on the VESC. It's one of the most important components.

Just see if you can find a broken good quality vesc of the forum and send it to MartinSP he will check it fix it and your getting far more for your money as long as your not going for a Maytech unless he is willing to upgrade it for you as well :-)

You may be interested. It is not available for order on the website yet because my DSLR broke so I cant take website worthy pictures but I can do it through forum if phone pictures are enough.
