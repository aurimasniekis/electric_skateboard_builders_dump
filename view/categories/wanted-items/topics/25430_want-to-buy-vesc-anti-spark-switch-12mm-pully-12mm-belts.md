Your options for a VESC at that price point are limited to [DIY](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/) by my knowledge. Unless you want to build it yourself....but then you'd need equipment which will cost you a lot, and you may break some things along the way (that's what I did at least).
