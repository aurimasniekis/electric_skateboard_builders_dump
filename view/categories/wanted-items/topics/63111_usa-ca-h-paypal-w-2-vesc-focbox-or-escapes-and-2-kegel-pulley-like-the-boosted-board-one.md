Hey Chris,

I have two Enertion 12mm flywheel pulleys. These snap in and do not require screws, but they do require a short or shortened truck hanger. I’m also in LA

@chris.hunt FYI @thisguyhere in LA should have some of those Enertion pulleys pick up is free...let me know if you go that route. Pick up two for me. They are 36 teeth

As for reading up on gear reduction on T# just go to the Esk8 calculator and play with the number and you’ll see the difference
