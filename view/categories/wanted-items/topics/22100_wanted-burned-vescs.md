hey guys! i'm trying to learn how to repair VESCs (specifically replacing the drv8302 chip).  I don't have a lot of money to drop right now but if you have a burned-out VESC make an offer and i will pay you something to send it to me.

Literally burned up my VESC just this weekend.  Shoot me a PM if you are still looking.

@faithfulpuppy I would really like to help you, but most of the broken vesc laying around have way more than just a dead drv, like most of them are missing 80% of the parts :wink:
