Recently snapped my Ownboard. Most of the electronics are fine, I just need the male 9 pin connector as pictures below. I found one selling for $9, but I think it ships from China, and I only need the male side anyway. I would also like to get it soon so I can fix my board.

I don't see the problem here... You don't want to spend $9?
