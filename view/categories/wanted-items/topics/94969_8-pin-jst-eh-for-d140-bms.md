Yeah that's an option I didn't really consider because I've heard people say bad things about those cheapo crimpers

I'll watch a yt video on how to crimp and see for myself

Crimping is ok if you make sure the crimp is absolutely secure.  Once its all crimped up then a dab of superglue/cya will permanize it.   I just made that word up btw
@AlanZhou  thanks for making it weird little man.

If connector still good you can buy from amazon other smaller pin count connector and just remove pins from housing and reuse them in ur old connector
