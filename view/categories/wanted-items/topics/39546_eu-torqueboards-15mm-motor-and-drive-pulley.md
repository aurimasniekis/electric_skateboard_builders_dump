Far fetched, but is there anyone in EU who happens to have the 15mm combo kit that would like the 12mm kit instead?

Would help if you specify and picture what you have and what you want. Teeth, pulley types, material...

Oh sorry. Didn't think it was necessary as I requested Torqueboards version. I bought this kit collections/dual-motor-mechanical-kit/products/dual-motor-mechanical-kit but forgot to upgrade the motor and drive pulley.
