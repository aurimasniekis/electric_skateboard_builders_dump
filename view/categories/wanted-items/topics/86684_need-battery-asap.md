Honestly I think the cheapest pack youre going to find(not used, I dont know which youre looking for) might be through this guy, with the Matrix battery deal he found.

alternatively, he had purchased a few packs previous... not sure if he is selling any used ones at a discount :)

that was before I did my research , even though I still don't trust myself, Then it also turns out that I have 3 unfinished builds

also realized afterward that i cant wait a month for each pack to be done, also to add to my month of unluckiness, i shorted my 10s3p pack so +30 more cells to weld

so, 30 cells + 10 cells+ 20 cells+ maybe another 40
