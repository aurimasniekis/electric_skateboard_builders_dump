Hi,
So as the title already says I would like to buy a fully assembled Firefly/
ervinelin Remote for my new Build. Preferably within the EU. :smiley:
If you got anything just send me a pm :slight_smile:

HI!, I will start sell the first batch of remote in 2-3 weeks. I have already parts, just need to finish my new lab space to be more efficient in assembling. Anyhow I will make a thread about it when is the time. So if you will still need it I can make it.
Ciao ciao :smile:

:joy: well parts + prints + soldering job + assembling + donation to creator do already set almost the price. For who wants to make it by himself, also a kit would be available. I just thought it is worth to do it because I am using it every day since middle June and I really like it.

I don't know if there's anybody in the state selling these things but if not I'd be interested in trying one out from ya.
You going to do any color options?

I already prepared the text for the post, so you will see there more details. In the US there was @SeeTheBridges that was selling them. He might start again soon. Anyhow no tracked shipping is 10 euro to US from here, so basically the same than within EU. For the color combination what I have at the moment is. For the remote cover:
PLA
white
black
liteblue
metallic grey
PETG
black

For thumb wheels and small components I suggest them in PETG or ABS
PETG
Black

ABS
black
Orange

This is the combination I choose for mine.

![IMG_20180710_075200|690x388](upload://jQ9zYPgBVyu6am4cZUtgETURBGx.jpg)

I still have to decide whether to put out just few options because print all separate parts will take way longer. Anyhow I am open to buy new filament colors if more people want it :wink:

ah cool! I did it because I wanted something different and indeed looks cool. I am also thinking of making a rubber version. I didn't try on this remote, but I did in the past and it works quite well.

It would be great if someone put a mold together for the housing and somehow made it affordable to do/and or just sucked up the cost because they were a boss. Cough Cough @Toughook

It is not to difficult make a mold, but it for sure increase the price. I am not an expert so I do not know how much it can be in material. Anyhow I used in the past plastidip for some motorbike projects and it works and you can always remove it later on. The only thing I do not know how long it will last in this case being the remote stored inside backpack and pocket. I am afraid it will wear out to fast. Only test can tell it.

Haha someone else had the same idea.

I don't want to enter a price war at all so will see where rey8801 ends up with his.

I will just be selling shells for the next month, My black ones are Nylon so super strong and everything else is ABS.

I still have to put them on sales, but I think that taking all together is gonna be around 105Euro shipped in EU, USA should be the same on maybe 2Euro more due to shipping cost. The gt2b mod will always be more affordable, as far as I know that's only a case. I can print it for cheap. This remote requires more parts and time for assembling.

My firefly just arrived from @seethebridges but he ran out of time to make them in my requested color so I‚Äôm looking for a case in orange and blue preferably nylon for the most durability.

Not sure which thread or post to put this on so I figured here cause you guys are all producing parts of them lol

if only need parts for one remote you can always use 3dhubs. It is more expensive and you can not decide everything but it does the job. Speaking for me I don't have that colors at the moment. I will do a doodle to decide if most of the people want particular color combination and order new filaments in case.

That sounds good! I'm not familiar with 3dhubs though. is that a printing service?

yep. https://www.3dhubs.com/ you can upload your STL files and get it printed.

Seriously uneconomic to make a mold for this unless you're selling the actual remote in the 1000s.

Ball park figure for 1+1 mold (left and right hand case parts) would be upwards of ¬£5000 in UK. Could do it for half that in China, but your MOQ would be sky high on the mouldings.

So the question is : how many do you want? If it's tens or even low hundreds, just stick to 3D printing, if it's in the several thousands I could theoretically get this done for you and mould them myself in my factory !

Haha ! Thing is it's such a simple thing to make, and with the tooling in place I could make 1000+ sets per shift. It's just like anything else, you need they money to invest and as much as I love esk8 I'm not gonna stump up the mould for a remote a didn't develop üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Print in ABS and smooth out with juice. That'll give similar results to an injection molded item. Or plasdip as mentioned above (though that gives a tacky/sticky surface sometimes).

Honestly you don't need it, you can get amazing results with 3d printing.

Doesn't have to be a professional mold. In the gt2b mod thread the guy made his own and I am pretty sure he is not selling thousands of them.

If you have the 3D parts I can do it 49 shipped (no tracking). I have pats for few remote so I prefer build them now, but one kit can go out since I will start making them in a couple of weeks.

sure you can have prototype molds made for less money, but they don't last long and not geared for mass production. What I do for a living is running an injection mould business, so that's the angle I'm coming from. High volume, long run, production. Only proper moulds will do the jobs I need. 3D Priniting is by far the best route for something like this project. You can get excellent results these days with even the 'lower end' printers.

I am using another nrf module. Let say the new version. It gives my stable signal for let say 5 meters. Now I shilded the modules and it is more. Anyhow never had problem even before. Being using since late June every day.
