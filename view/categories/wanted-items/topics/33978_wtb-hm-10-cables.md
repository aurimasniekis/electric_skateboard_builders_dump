So i need some HM-10 JST 2.0mm PH 7pin cables to connect to vesc. Anyone have a good source just for the cables? Can't seem to find just the cables.

Im confused about what you're asking

Solder the wire ends to the module, you only need to solder 4 wires
Forget the female plug if that's what's mixing you up
