I'm in need of this BMS and so far I haven't found anyone selling his spare BMS.

So this is a topic with two goals:

**Do you have one spare?**
Or
**Do you feel like ordering a set of two with me** (since bestech only allows orders with a minimum of two).

Here is the spec sheet for the BMS I'm after. I will be using it for Lipos

I'm based in the Netherlands might this be of interest to anyone

As a second option, you can consider buying [SuPower's BMS from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/SuPower-10S-36V-37V-42V-60A-Li-ion-Lithium-LiPo-Battery-BMS-Management-System-Balance-PCB/32801166001.html). Works perfectly fine here, and cheaper. 

Verzending kan misschien even duren though

If you can front the Money, just order 2 and after you get them you can sell one on the forum. 
Then you won't have to wait.

The Bestech is much better than the Supower and there only $49 + shipping and Paypal fee
They have a  built in E-switch that's worth $40 by its self.

Shipping to NL costs $29, + import costs. With the built in e-switch it's an okay deal but the price is significantly higher than buying the one from Aliexpress. In total it is a â‚¬37 difference.

Hmmm getting the Bestech one would be a better choice in my opinion. I heard the supower don't have a very good reputation as far as reliability goes
I also really dig the eswitch. A key feature i would say

@Namasaki yeah my plan is to sell the spare one if nobody replies in time, not really a big of a deal but its reassuring if i can get rid of it in a short amount of time

@e.board_solutions 16 ampere lijkt me toch iets te weinig. zeker gezien ik met lipos ga rijden wil ik een goede controle over de ontlading van de batterijen hebben en die is er natuurlijk niet als ik de bms alleen zou gebruiken voor opladen.
lipos hebben de neiging begreep ik om uit balans te raken tijdens ontlading, ook al staan ze in serie aan elkaar gekoppeld
Dan dus maar even die investering waardoor mn batterijen langer meegaan!

Nah I'm good. Just got the SuPower one from Aliexpress and it's working very nicely. 
If you are interested in how it performs, I posted a balance check in my own topic.

@e.board_solutions keep in mind the bms you linked doesn't balance. It's only a protection board.

As stated in the description it does overcharge, over discharge, over current and short circuit protection. If you check the table with the specs you can see the balance rows are crossed off. 

It just checks if something goes wrong and cuts the power. That's why it is so cheap and small! :)

I'm not sure if I'm seeing this correctly but does your BMS have an e-switch possibility? Looking at the two wires coming out of the bms to the left looks like it

@Namasaki do you think this BMS is allright to use with 10s 5ah lipo battery?

Not sure about eswitch, it doesn't mention it in the website http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D336.html

And as somebody mentioned in the chat it isn't as reliable as loop key, so I just made that instead of relying on e switch.

It has a built in E-switch and has been rock solid reliable.

A switch could be unreliable but what is for sure; it is a better solution than using a loopkey which still produces a spark

Waiting for her response/confirmation so I can pay for them.
As for now the second BMS is still open to anyone for purchase (@e.board_solutions ?).

Remind you that this is just a headsup from me and not my definitive order. If you need one as well, maybe we can work something out and I'll order one extra. Comment fast (like today) if you want one as well.

As someone who has recently ordered 4pcs of BesTech BMS' to Europe, let me just tell you that on the PayPal price Donna gives to you, you will pay customs charges:

- around 20% import taxes (depends on your country)
- 15-20â‚¬ DHL customs services

Just to warn you what to expect :)

- shipment 27 dollar
- 20% import taxes
- AND 15-20â‚¬ DHL custom BS

All this together?

## \#39 Posted by: SilentException Posted at: 2017-08-19T00:53:27.912Z Reads: 116

You will get invoice from Donna, something like this (prices will differ):
- 2x (or more) BMS = 2x $30 = $60
- DHL shipping = $27
- PayPal fee = $4
= $91
You'll pay this to BesTech.

Then, you'll additionally pay to your country and DHL:
20% of $91 = $18
$20 customs services
= $38

So your total expenses for BMS' in this scenario will be $129.

The data sheet with 200a over current detection and 3.0v over discharge detection is the correct one for Lipo batteries.
For Li-ions you can go lower on the over discharge protection.
Say, 2.8v

I believe you can. Get a blank spec sheet. There you can view what you can change about the BMS.
Just to be clear. It can only be done by bestech. You can't change it afterwards at home (unless you probably know what you are doing, but then you wouldn't ask this question I presume)

I understand what you're saying. My cells perfectly charge to 4.20volts, so that's no problem for me.
Maybe try contacting them and ask if they can dial in a lower balancing voltage?

Here is one of my latest checks:
1: 4.20
2: 4.20
3: 4.20
4: 4.20
5: 4.19

So I canâ€™t really go wrong with selecting a 10s from their list on the bestech site?

Depends on which one you get and how you plan to set it up

```
Keep an eye out for a BMS that can hold the discharge load your looking for.
As an extra you can look for one with an e-switch if that is what you want.
Other settings you can most likely tweak to make it as desired (for example like the 223).
One other factor that could be big is the size/dimensions.

Good luck!

I'm also trying to order a bestech bms for 10s 80a.
When I asked about HCX-D223v1 Lucy told me that the HCX-D596 is a upgraded version of it, which could be bought thru litechpower.com.
