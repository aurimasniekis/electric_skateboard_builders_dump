Where are you guys getting your wheel pullies these days?

Are there any Abec 11 pullies metrobosrd type around with 40T?

Yes, @dickyho has them

But they are not metroboard enertion type.

I'd like those to avoid the use of rings and bolts

They are sort-of a hybrid.  They are not press-fit (I wish they were) but as the inside of the pulley fits bearings, you can lightly tighten the bolts.  I suppose you could even JB Weld the bolts in and snip the top of them off so there is no ring on the outside of the wheel if you used the bearings inside the pulleys

In short, there is no "good" 40T or 44T wheel pulley with inserts.  When there is, I hope it will be a kegel-style core for the new @torqueboards wheels and the Boa Constrictors

Me too, but having bearings in the middle definitely helps get it PERFECTLY aligned and you don't have to tighten it very much.  You can tighten it while it's on the axle.  It's the best option at this moment, until someone makes some quality metal 44T press-fit kegel and abec11 pulleys

The Holly Grail of pulley/bearing world. How come no one has ever come with a sproketed metal (Aluminum) wheel pulley, in mass quantities, for either ABEC, Kegel, Clone, or whatever..... beats me (??) :thinking:

Nobody has ever listen to our outcry. :sob::cry: If one, just one lonely company, dares to manufacture a sprocket metal wheel pulley, in mass quantities, that could work with most wheel cores... it will do a killing!! But until then, we will have to wait in the sidelines dealing with these stupid chinese multi-piece retainer-hell bolt-nightmare wheel pulleys we often find outhere which requires twiching, adjusting, balancing, tightening, or screwing, with bleak and less than optimal results.

My pulleys will be here in about 2 weeks. There will be a Flywheel and Kegel Hub that press fits into the wheel, and then interchangeable pulleys (32,36,40,44)

![image|375x500](upload://1iwTQPPr5c3f6vm5WdsVJnMIYxr.jpeg)

I’m pretty excited as I think they will be the best thing available. This means you can buy a Hub+Pulley and if you ever want more speed or torque you just have to buy the Pulley and not the Hub.

Ive been loving the POM pulleys from @marcmt88, pretty much any tooth count  and any width for abec or kegal hubs and a very good price point. I know they have bolts but they are much simpler to get aligned than the TB steel pulleys and the POM seem to hold up fantastically👌

It's two part, with bearing inside, also will be making for kegel mount style, made from aluminum

The pulley must not seat on the wheel hub/core, it should sit on the inner cone and inner wheel border to avoid woobling/misalignment and weird sounds while acceleration/braking.

Is there any way to modify the design @Kug3lis

It's designed to run bearings inside the pulley onto the axle.  The whole idea with insert pulleys is that the only force transferred to the wheel is rotational/angular force

ahm, that's almost the same design, as our gear drive, just instead of cog it's a pulley so I don't really know :D We can remove that gap if it is really needed, but idea is that the lip on abec mounting sits against the wheel.

Usually to fit a pulley with bearing it's necessary to shave about 8mm off the hanger, unless the pulley shares a longer bearing with the wheel. If it's two normal wheel bearings plus the pulley bearing, there is not enough space.

I'm not so sure on that assumption. A lot of us like the narrower truck. I'm not sure anyone has ever polled it but you'll find a substantial amount of the forum using caliber 2's and even Paris trucks I'd wager. Looks like @Jlabs has us covered though.

Well, without additional bearing or sharing same as wheel I think will be bit unstable ;) But this is more for performance users I guess. Also wider hanger gives more stability :)

I’ve got to give you props for making them so quickly. Just 12 days after I released info on mine. :clap: :clap:

Also, are you going now to cry for every stuff we have in plans to make as our queued job list is big and at the moment we release bit by bit?

EDIT: Oh and btw its same mount from gear drive just added pulley on it ;) You can see the black part from previous pictures :) It's from prototype :D

Ladies ladies , you’re both pretty ! It’s all good , Us over here in the states Have JLabs while EU folks have Kru’s.

PA is just closer than Europe , and JLabs has $**7** flat shipping for people in the US , I can get more needed things at JLabs with less Flat Shipping then I can at your shop. 

Mind you I’m not , nor intending to attack your business .



I just wished JLabs (and American vendors as a whole) had even more variety in their shops. EU Vendors have such niche but convenient items like [motor covers](https://eskating.eu/product/eskating-pulleys-and-belts-covers-for-electric-skateboards-2x/), [wire grommets](https://eskating.eu/product/soft-rounded-black-gasket-for-motor-and-sensor-wires5pcs/), [nose guards](https://eskating.eu/product/bombsquad-universal-noseguard/), [**lights**](https://eskating.eu/product/bombsquad-universal-noseguard/), [fully assembled drivetrains](https://eskating.eu/product/electric-skating-assembled-kit-7020-watts/), [water proof covers](https://eskating.eu/product/waterproof-cover-for-on-off-bms-switch-20mm/), [fully assembled antisparks](https://eskating.eu/product/waterproof-cover-for-on-off-bms-switch-20mm/), [Focbox Cases](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/focbox-dual-aluminium-case/), [Cable Risers](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/riser-pad/), etc on top of the regular stuff and just to get these things I have to fish out more money and wait. Why the hell is an entire continent nearly *northern* of us have a more diverse and assessable DIY market than the godanm US? Fuck it, I'm about to make a whole Post about this

So far every reply from you was personal... I haven't said any single word about your pulleys or any other thing you do, we just shared what we were working on. I said more for performance because we will also soon will have 20mm version available which I consider is for performance users? Also as I mentioned this is for longer axle = longer axle bigger motors = more power so the full bearing is kinda required for 3kW motor pulling belt on something with just pressed fit connection.

Yes exactly, there is not much any other way you can mount something on those wheels, two parts because it's easier to machine less wasteful, also a bit more universal.

There must be something wrong with this approach. How come this Modular Pulley Set is advertised as 'Flywheel' when a Flywheel conical hub is way different than the Superfly you are using in your installation guide??

![image|480x360](upload://4d2PfI4rT5Lkt1lgh3D7zn7Mfw.jpeg) 

What 'Genuine 107 Flywheel' is this that you are advertizing? It can't be!  Just rectify and say this is for Superfly. Because there is no way that modular pulley will work with  Flywheels when you are clearly using a Superfly. Both shapes could not coexist, nor does any 'universal' pulley like this one on two different wheels with different hub wells. Is impossible.

In case you try to convince people otherwise, one image speaks a thousand words. The old 107mm Electric Flywheel superimposed over the 107mm Superfly and the 97mm Refly. Superfly is no more than a shaved down (11mm less) Flywheel which shares the same centerset core. By shaving down the centerset Flywheel, ABEC transformed the Supefly and the Refly into offset wheels. The hub difference between one and the other two are abyssmal, and here is where your modular pulley fails. It works for the Superfly, but is impossible it could work on the Flywheel.

The SuperFly wheel pulleys and the Flywheel pulleys are interchangable.  The Electric Flywheel pulleys are the ones that are different.

BKB? ..How? ...there is more than 1 cm (11mm) difference between both wheels hub shape. If hub adapter is the same for both, pulley should be different from Superfly to the Flywheel......wayyyyy different! Hows that?

**Edit**: Ah, I got it. We are talking about the same thing. Waiting for @JLabs response as to why they advertized their modullar pulley as 'Genuine Flywheel' ? Is there smthng I'm missing here? I think there maybe a confussion between all of us as to what is an Electric Flywheel, a Flywheel and a Superfly (??)

Why you getting all upset inferring that I’m falsely advertising? I’ve been doing this a while dude, I know my shit. 

The pulleys fit the wheels I have listed in the description. The only one they don’t work with are the electric flywheels that are ancient (because they are center set). Any other wheel with just the word “flywheels” work along withe the 107mm “superfly”.
