Just buy a 60A 10S BMS and youâ€™ll be fine.

The room in the encolsure is the issue. This is why I am trying to source an Enertion BMS first.

the Enertion BMS was HUGE for a whle. 

Post a pic and i'll see if i might have an old spare one laying around. I'm pretty sure i shipped them all to the new warranty repair guy though.

Nooo lol... Do you have any sound advice what 10s BMS might work the best to replace this one if I can't find another one?

literally any 10S 40amp BMS will work. You could even use a 50 amp or 60 amp. The only constraint is the size, so take measuremnts, and if you want to keep using the pushbutton make sure the BMS you get has either a solder pad for a switch or a temp sensor that you can interrupt with a switch.

Yeah that's the issue is the size, I have things nicely no laid out but  there is little room. I will keep my fingers crossed that you have one that fell in the cracks of your couch or something. 

Thanks LHB

oh that's not even a raptor cell, that's a new space cell. 

never mind. they use a charging board and an LVC eswitch, two different pieces. I don't have any of that.

Alright thanks for getting back to me. So I guess a 10s bms would suffice, I just need to find a small one

Yea, just opened on old raptor battery, one of the first ones. Bms is also done, and switch. For some reason I thought they were 25r cells.

And yes that BMS is huuge lol.
