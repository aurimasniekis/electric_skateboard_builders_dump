Hi guys,

I'm looking for 2x 5S 5000mah Lipos for a 10S build (or 5x 2S Lipos).

Anyone got any for sale? I'm located in Bay Area.

Hmmm I have two but I'm sadly a very long way away from you (New Zealand). Sadly for you anyway :)

Thanks, brutha. But I heard 20C is bad. Is 20C okay?

Yes higher the better, I believe they have some that can go up to 50C.I really meant try their website. I just googled 5s 5000mah Turnigy copied link and pasted it here. Also Turnigy is a reliable lipo pack from what I've seen here on the forum

Whoa. These look awesome, but I'm not sure how I would set these up.

If I wanted a 10S would I run 10 of these in series at 8AH?

With no country on the profile, I don't feel bad for not knowing that.  I'm going to stop answering folks if they don't fill out their country.

@electrickiwi @kfred If you fill out your profile, it can help other people help you.  I don't know if you're in Europe, USA, or Antarctica.

Cool, I'm in San Francisco. I have purchased all of the parts except battery for my build. I am looking to use a 10S battery.

Deck: Short board (10" x 33" dual kick)
Motor: Dual belt N5055 (270kv)
ESC: dual ESC
BMA: 60A BMS
Enclosure: DIY ikea (for now)
Battery: 10S (thinking of Lipo)

I just saw this video about these packs:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q0m8n-b8cY

I'm not sure how I would connect the batteries, though? Would I solder them or would they require a spot welder? 

I don't have a spot welder but I am comfortable soldering--I've recently completed a DIY COB LED build (non-esk8) for a lighting project, which I designed and soldered in series.

you could do a couple different methods.   even heard of people crimping them.  maybe aluminum solder be easier than regular solder.  never hear of people spot welding  these tabs

Discharge is kind of mediocre but should be adequate. It’s proabbaly bettee to buy small looks as 2 5s bricks are rather large. 5 2s packs would be a lot slimmer.

Thanks. I’m doing a short board though so I’m not positive I’d have enough room for the 5x 2S. 

I think I’ll just get 2x 5S 5000mah and call it a day.
