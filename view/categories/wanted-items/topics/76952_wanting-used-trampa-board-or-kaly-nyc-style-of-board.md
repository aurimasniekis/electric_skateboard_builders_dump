I am new-ish here. Have been riding for awhile now. I would like to dive into DIY and my sights are set on a Trampa style board. So I am looking for a used Trampa Board. From there I will upgrade and customize to my liking. Any one have a used trampa collecting dust? 

P.S.
I live in the U.S.

first off, great name. 

secondly trampa and kaly boards tend to have high resale value, so it might honestly be best to do the research, learn what you want, and then purchase it from franks website or wherever youre getting the parts from :) 

Good luck

Going emtb, us go with gear drives or even direct drives. Nothing wrong with chains or belts though. Gears and direct just give a very sleek look to the build. Other than that, build to your liking. And have fun lol

thatÂ´s kind a miss leading... board is all stuff
Deck is only deck...
Now iÂ´m not sure what really is needed...
@danepoostain can you please let us know if you want a used board and than just change parts you donÂ´t like?
or do you look ony for a used trampa deck? so no truck, no wheels, no motors, nothing else?

@Andy87 what I am hoping is I find an older one that maybe needs a little work and go from their. I found a couple like the one that @FranciscoV posted but it was a 14 Ply deck. I weigh 180lbs so that would be sagging under my weight. I had another lined up but unfortunately the seller ghosted me. So if you are selling an old trampa diy thats collecting dust let me know or if you know someone looking to sell send them my way.

Alright. So things have changed. After having two seperate sellers back out I now have a **Kaly direct drive, two 6374 190KV motors, Trampa 16 ply board, AT wheels ,and Hangers**. Still feeling good and things are coming together overall. 

So mechanically I think I have everything I need. Now I need all the electrical components that go under the board **(Batteries, ESC x2, Remote, Charger, and Enclosure)** 

I'm new here and this is my first build. Im not super well versed in the electrical side of things and the components that I will need. Any help or tips are welcome. Right now I'm just trying to put together a list of what components I may still need. 
What else am I missing here? On/Off Switch, Bluetooth for Remote, Anti-Spark???

@pjotr47  since the board has holes in the deck on the holypro, how do you do the under board enclosure?
```

Use hotglue or epoxy to seal the holes. And use new griptape

Im asking because I have a holypro and im debating between top and bottom mounted electronics and one thing I didnt consider was the holes that will go straight into the bottom enclosure. I guess its not a stretch to just fill them and call it good. Thanks
