Here's an old Meepo hub.  One single working hub.  Yes it's ugly but runs smooth as butter.  It can get someone back on the road.

What I would like is to trade it for a generic front truck with some abec clones.  Similar to what the meepo had.![IMG-0104|375x500](upload://pMrWPYu8BuECNb2cQP6cbB4J5EQ.jpeg) ![IMG-0104|375x500](upload://pMrWPYu8BuECNb2cQP6cbB4J5EQ.jpeg)

In that condition, you might get 1 normal PU wheel or something :rofl:

I'm looking for just the cheap chinese 90mm Abec clones on the generic 9" Caliber clone trucks so I can just have a rolling set.

Here is a pic of the single truck I would like to try match up for a 'roller'...  Not looking for anything special, just working so I can put together a 'beater' board with spare parts I have laying around.

I'm in Scottsdale, AZ.

Here is a pic for Anubis.  I put some armour all on it just for him...  :slight_smile:

It’s really hard to turn and just clicks when powered. No idea what’s up.  

If anyone can use my working hub just holler.

I could use a spare hub since mine is showing some wear. I swapped out my stock front truck and wheels if thats what youre looking for
