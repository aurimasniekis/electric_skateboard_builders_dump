Ok... I'm not sure if this is allowed but anyone who has been watching my build log knows that my board has put me through lots of headache.

First of all, my hub motors turned out to be crap, then my vescs both died. I ordered another which was broke upon plugging into my computer for the first time. I fried multiple batteries. Replaced the batteries and fried them while charging. Bought new wheels, and a new motor, it worked for about 3 (short) rides and now the motor won't spin. It tries when I pull the throttle but can't physically be turmed. Also, my mini remote stopped working randomly, quit pairing. 

I'm saying all this to say, I really decided to build my eskate to save money with transportation in the city when I do my music gigs. I've actually wasted so much money doing this. I've learned a lot but I really don't have the money to replace anything else. I'm thinking of I can get one of those torque boards closed motors that would be less prone to breaking, as I think mine shorted out. Maybe a rock got in there or something. 

I still have my battery issue. I have 2 4s 5000mah lipos and an 8s BMS that I never installed. Actually, I fried the wires to it when I originally tried to hook it up to the balance lines on the batteries. So the bms is still in good shape but the wires aren't. @akhlut was nice enough to help me out a bunch with restoring my vescs, and helping me out with fixing some Soldering issues that had to do with my batteries the first time they were fried.

I'm not trying to be a charity case but the truth is, I'm a single mom with 2 daughters that are 3 and 5. I have an ex husband that does absolutely nothing for them. I'm a disabled vet as well. We just don't make too much money haha. To be honest with you, it's been extremely difficult to keep a job when I'm the only one responsible for my 2 girls as well as medical appointments.

If you've gotten this far, thanks. I tend to ramble on about things. I'm asking if anyone can help me out with some of these parts to get my board going again. I literally waste more money driving to city gigs and sometimes even time searching for parking to have to walk far anyway. Those gigs are a source of income for me.

Let me know if you think this motor is shorted. I couldn't figure out how to mute the video.

Is it possible the screws are shorting the motor?
What length are they, does loosening them do anything, and is the motor unplugged from the vesc?

I'm not sure we understand what you're asking us.  
  
If the motor is detached from everything and it's in your hand, is it still hard or impossible to turn?

Your bearing may be seized.  The motor mounting plate looks like it has been dragged thru some serious disagreements with pavement/curbs... was the motor mounted when that happened?  I would remove it from the mount and undo the set screw on the pulley - slide that off and you should be able to pull the motor apart.

So you think it's the bearing rather than a short? And yes, that happened while the motor was mounted. I didn't think that part could effect the motor. More so thought it would shield it actually. I will try your idea though.

If you disassemble the motor youll find the issue. If its not repairable im sure there's a low cost replacement floating around the fourm.

Sorry to heard that, can't image living in the United states would be so tought before ......

maybe just sell every things out,to people who know how to fix them. then use the money to buy a cheap completed board, better a hub motor one, less issue.   follow every product instructions when driving and maintaining......

It's steel epoxied together. I put the plane motor mount on it because the holes for the screws were too big and that made them more secure. There is room on the shaft. It's really hard to get it on and off though.

sometimes I wonder what is wrong with the good old bicycle. Being Dutch, I just don't understand why a cheap transportation method like that does not come to mind.

ESK8 has been fun, but in my case far from a cheap alternative to public transportation, cars, let alone...a bike.

The problem with bikes for me is that they get stolen in the city, yes, while locked up, and they don't conveniently fit in my car. I can always throw my board in my front seat, trunk, backseat or wherever. Again, my issue is probably different than others as I live near the city and travel in and out the city often. I am a musician and most of the time, wherever I'm gigging is going to have parking issues. I've had my fair share of parking tickets, as well as been late to gigs driving around in circles looking for a parking spot, to then have to walk several blocks, and all the while paying for the spot and hoping the meter doesn't run out while I'm at the gig.

Foldable bike ;)
Used them as a student for years.

That said, my locks were always more expensive that the bike itself.

They are pretty expensive and I'd most likely be sweaty by the time I got to my gig with the hills and small wheel base of the foldables

Looks like a case where short term savings ended up costing more in the wrong run. Motor clearance seems to be the primary culprit (chewed up mounts, motor bearing seized, potential electrical failure due to impact/vibration).

Invest in a proper adjustable motor mount that you can fine tune. @marcmt88 makes some rather quality motor mounts for 50$. 90mm wheels from buildkitbkards.com (30$) will give you extra plush and clearance for the motor. You have kids, so switch out that bomb for a LiPo pack and get a proper 18650 pack made by someone else (150$). It takes one fuckup and your home for your kids is gone. Esk8 is best thought with the mentality of Buy Once, Cry Once.

One word: parking.

Esk8 is the only method of transport besides walking which doesn't require me to pay to park something or deal with locking up a bike or scooter.  A folded-up scooter is too hard to carry, and folding/unfolding is a hassle.  Esk8 is the only method where I don't have to worry about paying to park or leaving my vehicle in a high-crime area.  I just pick it up and keep going.  No matter where that is.
