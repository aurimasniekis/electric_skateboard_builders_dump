Hey guys im keep looking for a while for some motors to add to my next dual motor setup with focbox, probably running on Foc mode.

First of all what would be the best choice for a motor in terms of KV. From what i read in foc mode i will need a lower kv ? How low should it be?  @Jinra maybe can you give me your advice ? 
I was looking at -> 6355 190KV from torqueboard but it costs me 40$ the shipping.. + ~40$ customs probably... so is not a good deal :( sadly

What is a good place where to buy some reliable motors in Europe. (i saw in us are a lot.. but the customs are killing me)

Im planning to use a 10s setup.

Thank you.

I've used a pair of these and they have been really good so far. Don't be fooled by the size. They push my 93kg really well. I use wide trucks from evolve. Not sure if they would fit on regular trucks, you may have to go dual diagonal on calibers.

The motors are the same size and form as the motors Evolve and Chaka use. Made by a similar factory perhaps? 
They push me up all the hills in my area and get me close to 30mph with 97mm wheels. (After that the double kingpin trucks are a bit random..)

@fottaz has a webshop @ www.eskating.eu with some motor options. 

http://eskating.eu/product/electric-skateboard-sealed-motor-6354-190kv-sealed-sensored/ could be a option depending on your setup.
