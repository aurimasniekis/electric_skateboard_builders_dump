Tired of waiting. I want to ride this thing.

Who has a VESC they'll sell me and ship to arrive before this weekend?

Thanks

I already sold those two. I'm currently using this particular vesc on an on-road board; therefore the price is higher. Maybe another user can offer it at a lower price.

$250 is more than a bit ridiculous.  I know "what the market will bear" but geez...  Also known as gouging.

@t1m0007 - i might have a spare i'd part with.  It'll be an older 4.7/4.8 but works fine.  And not more than i paid for it...   I'll check when i get home if you don't have one already.  Shoot me a PM and can see if it lines up.

And if it doesn't - i like having a spare or two anyway so no rush on my part.

 I like the idea of having a sacrificial vesc.  Do you have more?

Sorry man, but the other spare is $250.

JK - i'm set for now, and maybe after v6 comes out i'll part with my backups.  Sounds like you had a few extra and liquidated them for extra $.  I'd rather part with them to someone who wants to ride vs make a profit.  No offense intended, but just different focus.  Business and make money vs spread the stoke.  I'm not giving them away or anything...

No ETA - likely 3+ months.

v5 = v6.  Not sure why the change but consider them the same.

In all seriousness, the delay on my Enertion vesc is the reason this thread exists. 

@onloop I'm willing to give macrofab the benefit of the doubt, maybe they didn't pack my order correctly, but I've been waiting on a spacecell and vesc after receiving all mechanical parts from you in late July. I got the spacecell yesterday. No vesc was included. I had figured the vesc delay was an effort to bundle with the SCP to reduce shipping costs. Now I'm extra confused with your advertisement for 2 day processing stated above. Halp. Tired of pushing. @EnertionSupport #4885
