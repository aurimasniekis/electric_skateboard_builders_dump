I'm looking to use a Carbon GT deck for my build, if anyone has one they are willing to part with I will be looking to definitely take that off your hands.

If you want a CF deck bro you could[ grab a board from here](https://www.hi5ber.com/longboards) and stick a custom housing under it.

[MasterCho](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-mastercho-enclosure/8473/12?u=cobber) has some nice ones and is a good place to start...

I've seen these around the interweb somewhere. Might try them out for a future build. I really want one of those CGT' decks.
