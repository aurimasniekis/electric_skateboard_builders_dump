Hi, looking for a kit to add to my board I already have. Been looking at DIYeboards but I'm not sure if they are reliable and was thinking that maybe someone on here sells kits. 

Would it also be better to individually purchase parts from people on this site? My budget is around $500

Thank you.

If you mean the build kit boards kit it’s not out yet so there’s no reviews of it that I know of. If it’s a combination of the parts he sells now they’re well reviewed in many of the build threads here. He sells high quality stuff and he stands behind it. It’s a safe bet that it’ll be very good. 

If you mean the haggy kit it is also excellent and Timo the owner is great to deal with. You’ll need to find electronics to go with it, the haggy kit is just drive assembly and wheels. 

Good luck!

Diyeboard sells crap that sometimes never arrives those trucks have a major issue where they snap in half, and the battery is poorly built with cheap cells. Its pretty much a forum rule to avoid diyeboard. If you want, i can build a 10s pack for you

Thank you bro, I appreciate that but its fine, I think I do not have all the tools to weld stuff together etc. which is why I prefer to buy a pre-built kit and simply drill/put it together that way.

Think you'll struggle getting a kit for your budget.  Best buy it in part kits.  Drivetrain kit.
Electronics kit etc.  Spread the cost.

You dont need hardly any tools for a simple build. Its all modular and if you dont want to fabricate. You really dont need to. The hardest part will be mounting an enclosure tbh. My cheapest build went together in 4 hours start to finish

You know what?  There is nothing wrong with the meepo.  Established company with good back up and the v2 is fun.  For a first board its a good option for the price.  By getting the kit version you will get a taste for the build but you will always keep that thing because it will keep on going.

I've got 2 meepos.  One is a stock friends and family board and one has 2 focboxes in it and a 30q battery.  Both cool.  Focbox one is a little demon.
The stock one has a blown esc and I got a new one from meepo with a discount code because I was an early customer.  Didn't ask but received an email after the order went through.  Good guy that Kieran.

I dont own a meepo product, but i have ridden a v1 board and it was a peppy little thing. His store prices are pretty competitive and he is tranparent about his sources and price margins. If for some reason i buy a prebuilt, it will be a meepo

Alternative is buy a used board and deck swap it, I might be able to get you a 700W dual hub build with 14mi of battery (no deck/enclosure) for a bit over $200... basically a meepo

Both of mine are deck swapped.  The stock deck is pretty shit.  I'm just in the process of swapping the stock one over to a 33 arbour with a kick.  Shopping trolley.

It's my board...I'll take the deck back because it's not mine but I can sell the trucks/hubs/wheels/cells/BMS/holders/charger/remote as a set

It will fit under a nickel board if you stack it

Skateshred.com has a new vanguard clone made of bamboo and fiberglass. It looks identical and its only $35. I have bought several decks from them and they are all fantastic


Edit: looks like they are sold out of the good clone, all thats left is the older maple one thats probably not as good

Because I'm poor AF... dropping $1k on a monster so I want to recover some cost...I can sell you a bunch of DC stuff to

Also I need to loose some weight...eskate isn't very condusive to that when I don't have time for the gym

It's not a spectacular build but it knocks me off balance when I max the throttle and it does 22mph on flat ground with a full battery, hard riding for 10mi before you get sag and another 4mi at medium power before it's dead...18lbs with a light longboard deck so not awful (I'm not strong and I carry it all over campus no issue)

Hi Jared,

Was about to send you a PM for the following question but maybe the answer can be useful for some others : \
Is this "free kit giveaway" for US only or is it international ?

[/quote]

Something wrong with yours then.  I have both and the only difference is a much smoother esc.  The v1 was jerky and snatchy but the v2 is nice and linear.  That might explain the supposed difference in power but they both climb the same gradients and top out at the same speed.

Mine doesn't.  V1 is just sharper on the throttle.  Gives a quick start but not enough to make it quicker off the line.

Do you have both?  I've got 2 right now but did have 4.  2 v1 and then 2 v2's.  Did a bunch of tests for kieran way back when.  Nothing youtuby just some feedback and they both accelerate the same.  1st gen esc's had a few issues with regard to sensors giving out and when they do the thing has a bit more power.  Doesn't cog either so its hard to pick up on.  I'm guessing your v1 has fucked sensors.

Way to tell is to come to a stop and then hit reverse.  If it stutters before going back the sensors have gone.

I used to have meepo hubs v1 (red thane), and still have two meepo v1 esc's RN, tried a V2, it didn't seem as punchy

Ah that's probably why. It seems on both of my esc's the sensors are gone.

Only my belt drive version esc substitute does not shutter a bit when going backwards

You don't really even need sensors on the esc substitutes...

My belt drive did not cog at all from a standstill with no sensors

@ZachTetra do you get cogging?

Nah, clean start up below 10 degree slope on asphalt

She cries on steep slopes and rocky terrain even with both motors sensored though, then again they are old hub motors that pull less than 800W combined and get hot after 5 minutes full power

Nothing I could feel riding.  I mean with this type of board its hard to compare because slow is slow.  We just had a speed gun at 2 set distances and both versions hit the same speed at the same point give or take the odd k.  Whether the 0 - 15 differed we didn't test but both hit the top speed at the same distance.  Also both pulled up hills the same.  Again nothing noticeably different to the not anal user.
