Link to the deck?

Much better. I can recommend a better and cheaper deck if you haven't already bought that thing.

I have a buddy selling a raptor deck and enclosure that would match those trucks nicely. $150 for both.

I still don't think your budget is realistic in any of the threads you've started, except the meepo.

You'd likely want a 10s3p 30qs. 12wh/km will give you almost 17 miles. Again budget isn't very realistic.
- cells: $135
- bms: $30
- misc parts: $
- labour fee: $$$

repeat from last thread
- cheap enclosure: $10 from ikea

you do the math this time  :slight_smile:

Sorry bud not one bit interested. I wouldn't make something that can explode into flames if done incorrectly for someone other than myself. Just buy the meepo man. It's the best option.

Don't forget nobody is going to build your battery for free :stuck_out_tongue: ... however (calling on @Dirt_Bag) prolly makes the cheapest packs around.

Thats a solid price for a 10s4p lol. 30qs? Like I said earlier maybe a 10s3p may cater to your budget better.

Right, I was quoted at ~$250 for a 10s3p. Battery is something you certainly don't want to skimp on.

I think that is the best plan depending on how long you can wait. If you can, go for the bkb kit

I can do any battery you like, but below 3p on the motors you chose it will be rather weak and your range will definetly not be 10 miles.

I offer the cheapest price i can, so if you cant afford mine then you might need to reevalute your budget a bit. Building a decent dual motor board is a minimum of 800. Ive done it several times before, every time i used the absolute cheapest parts that dont suck.
