Ive been moving quite a lot lately and unfortunately Ive lost the receiver during the move. It would be great if a website of someone could be selling these separately. I have both the nano x and winning remote without the receiver and I don't exactly wanted to buy another remote ðŸ˜‚

Yeps is a nano x receiver. I live unfortunately in Belgium. So it is not worth shipping
