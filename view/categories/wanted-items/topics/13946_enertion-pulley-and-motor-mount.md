Looking for a 12 mm wide drive pulley kit and motor mount from enertion in the US. I would buy from them, but I think $40 for shipping is a bit excessive, so I turn to you. Does anybody in the US, or who will ship to the US have these?

I still have a pulley kit in the for sale section. I'm in Canada (the upper 10) willing to ship to the lower 48. Kit is $40USD and shipping is around $15USD with tracking.

If I do the miamielectricboards one, it ends up adding to the same price because they are charging more and then still have shipping that's like $10
