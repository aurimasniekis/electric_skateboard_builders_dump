This is a V2 so they are more or less reliable (not the best remote ever but one of the best thumbwheel remotes). It's internals are the same as of the Nano-x. Only issue is you have to calibrate it before you ride: push the wheel fully forwards and backwards and you are good to go! Otherwise go with a Benchwheel remote)

Ohh I'm sure it'll be a good remote it's just not fully tested/completed yet so if you would like to be one of the BETA testers you can order the parts and assemble it)

I am almost certain the v2 of the winning remote is more reliable. Do a quick search on here. There is some info for sure. Also the new maytech is thumb controlled. Does this interest you?

The nano-x from Enertion has been good for me as well.
