The esc on my cheap loaner board died. 
Anyone have an esc exactly like this one that I can grab? :slight_smile:

I don't need the remote, button, etc as those are still good and I can just pair it up. Thought to ask around first before buying it off ebay in case anyone has one on hand.

Thanks :)

*note that I am looking for hub version
