Anyone got these files to share? I've only been able to find 9mm and 15mm. Happy to share those in exchange. 

Thanks

I have a file I made at work that I've been using for a 9mm that I can adjust for a 12 mm there is second file that is the front mating file that provides a flat surface for the heads of the screws. The screws shown are M6 but I switched to 10-24x2" because it was a much better fit. Do you want a flange on the inside face of the pulley to keep the belt from drifting towards the trucks? I'll swing by and  make the changes later today if that works for you. Pictures for reference below.

DUDE. that'd be killer. Thank you for offering. And yes please to all of the above!  I really dig the flange idea, yes sir and thank you! Would you be willing the share the step files after you modify it as well? Just in Case!

Thanks

Also-- do you make the pulley slightly larger than 12mm (or 9 in your case) to accommodate the belt size or is the actual belt size smaller than advertised?

Additionally- since it sounds like you're already rocking this situation- did you need to file down the Callibers at all to avoid screw contact?

YEAH! no problems with that.  Also, these files require no modifications to the trucks themselves, it's just put on and go. I know other wheel mounted pulleys require shaving off a part of the trucks.  I'll swing by work in a few hours. And the pulley component itself is 1 mm larger than the belt to allow for clearance and issues print quality issues.

Yeah I downloaded a caliber model from GrabCad which was spot on for most dimensions but I did have to tweak it a little.  The 2 inch 10-24 machine screws clear the trucks when mounted with the mating file. Any longer and you'd risk having the screws catch on the trucks. I'be just made my first board and I havent had any issues with this iteration of pulley.

Yeah I'm just uploading now though I never actually had an account before so it's saying I have to wait 24 hours to upload. Since I've got the time, I'll make Steps and STLs for the 9mm, 12mm and 15mm belt options and have to post the link tomorrow.

**Edit:** Any other common pulley sizes for drive wheels that people use? 34,35,37,38? I could make those as well and just do a mass upload?

Dude, this is great. Thanks so much. 

@Randyc1 do you think that extra flange will cause any unwanted friction/resistance?

The flange doesnt really come into contact all that often once the pulleys are aligned, there's clearance around the belt. It's just a nice to have, also it's only just slightly larger than the pulley itself as it serves as a way to protect the teeth while removing off the print bed. 
Picture for reference.

As long as the Motor gear is alinged to center of wheel pulley it should be fine .

Guys **DONT PRINT THESE YET.** I had one printed by my coworker just be be sure because I didnt want to screw anyone over, he printed this at .2mm layer height and roughly 35mm/s (~4 hours) and it didnt fit but the set i did at .1mm and 20mm/s did (~8 hours), though admittedly it was very tight. The studs should have come out at 5.9mm diamter and I'm getting an average of 6.15mm which seems to be enough to mess with the fit. I'll change the sizing of the studs and pulley to allow for the variability. Will do this first thing in the morning.

Print I got from him before. I made flange smaller on the new file since this one chipped getting it off the print bed.  I'm so sorry if anyone has started to print these already, I will fix it and make him do one more print to confirm and then post result here. Sorry for any inconvenience.
So Sorry. (if you couldnt already tell, I'm Canadian.. :P )

Very cool!  Great to have 9/12/15 options for kegels.

How involved or difficult is it to offer these in other teeth options?  36/38/40/42/44 or similar (not sure what would fit well and what folks want)?  I know with higher voltage setups 8/10/12s - it's helpful to gear down further for better hills and less top speed.

Anyone else see value in larger teeth options for kegels?

It would take me a 5-10 minutes to do each for any pulley size for this wheel now. I would only be modifying the pulley itself while leaving the rest untouched for the most part. If you guys tell me what sizes you guys want/need I have no issues coming in on the weekend and knocking them all out in a day.

These look sweet man.  It's so weird seeing these on someone else's wheel 😝. I've only had the chance to put like 50 km on mine since I messed around with the controller GT2E and must have shorted something out. But I no wear on mine. Printed in PETG. How's yours working out? What print settings/printer did you use?

I used a 10-24 machine screw tap on the pre drilled holes. Did it slowly and doing a half turn back every turn to break the chips  until I reached the body of the pulley since I didn't  want to break the studs coming out. So due to the spacing of the holes in the kegel itself and the side profile of the caliber trucks, the bolts have to terminate in the body of the pulley with minimal clearance available so I didn't use a plastic nut locker. Instead I applied a bead of super glue to the threads of the screws and taped holes.  Then tightened by hand until it tightened everything in the assembly without over torquing the threads.  So far I've done about 50 kms before I tinkered with the GT2E remote and sorted something out and now in waiting to get proper VESCs from chaka and a new GT2B remote and going to do the little buffalo mod. The pulleys themselves though still look like new.  No wear yet.

That's awesome - thanks man!  I'd love to be able to print out some new pulleys any time needed.  Especially getting some higher teeth count pulleys available so can gear down further for hills or less top speed...

Let us know how the baby buffalo GT2b goes - i have 2 GT2b's on order and want to do one BB!  Let us know any issues or tricks needed?

I'm still a little premature to give any feedback on the BB mod. I'm making a 8s6p 18650 Samsung 25r battery pack but I'm waiting on the Nickle strips and the BMS so I can set up the board when Chakas VESCs arrive. So right now the eBay stuff is a few weeks out from coming in and the VESCs might be a few more weeks since I only ordered them like end of the week before last I think. I do have 3 prints of the BB controller already printed for when the controller gets here but I'm thinking  first I wanna use it without the  mod and make sure the system works well before I introduce a new source of possible issues. But I'll upload some pictures of the prints when I get home from work.

[/quote]

So I sourced the CAD of the 38, 40 and 44 all from online suppliers and I had to _borrow_ 1 Tooth profile from one of those to create the 42T option from scratch. I'll start with these but I'm thinking I'll also make the odd numbers 37,39,41,43, and 45 since now I have the profile of one individual tooth. Why not have an arsenal of pulleys available to anyone who wants to do a super custom ratio. So those will come at a later time time though since those require more work to create.

I print mine with a 2mm shell thickness, and 100% infill.  It's about 50 grams worth or material. Outer shell speed is 25mm/s and inner shell is 35mm/s. Infill speed doesn't matter really. Layer height I use is 200 microns or .2mm. You can go thinner but the extra time downtown really translate into better performance.  That print should take roughly 4 hours for the 36T and more depending on the size.  If you would like to tell your friend that I'm going to be updating the files this saturday to fix a little bit of gap he should wait a couple days if he can. If not these are still good to go but I want these to be perfect.

No problem mate. The flywheels are good to go.  I have other modifications to make eventually to release bearing in pulley versions that someone had asked for.  Will probably get the chance to do that in  October during fall reading week. The files currently are good to go though.
