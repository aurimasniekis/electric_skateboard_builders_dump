I've ordered from az-reptec in Germany via Amazon.  Quick delivery and all good.

How much do you need?
The plastics shop, righton, Amari plastics are a few suppliers. eBay may be better for small quantities. 
All uk suppliers.

Strange. @Nordle, where are you located?

They did ship from Germany to Switzerland and the shipping wasn't even terribly expensive.

Italy, everything i found on amazon.it is shit, and everything else doesn't ship :confused: but i order a lot from amazon.de i know they're shipping some things to austria and switzerland which they don't ship to others (maybe cause they're same language?).
I don't need much atm, just going to order a bit from ebay. But if anyone has cheaper/better source i'm open.

Maybe you search for "Graupner ABS". It seems pretty cheap for [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/Graupner-736-3-ABS-Platte-wei%C3%9F-3-0/dp/B0043RL35C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1469610717&sr=8-1&keywords=graupner+abs)
