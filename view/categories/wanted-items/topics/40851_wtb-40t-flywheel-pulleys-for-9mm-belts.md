I have all sizes available as well. They are 12mm wide, but 9mm belts can be run on them as well.

does anyone make 15mm pulleys? i want to run superflys for the smoothness but i don't really want to go much more than 30mph. At 12s with 190kv i'd need the 44t at least

I’m going to have a pre order for them (15mm variants) soon. I’m thinking 10% off if you pre order and delivery would be mid February.
