Waiting on motors for my build from someone else and no idea when I will get them. If anyone has an extra motor of any condition as long as it is functional I'd be interested.

Located in Claremont (outside of LA), California. United States.

I’ve got an extra Enertion 6355 motor that’s never been used, free if you want it. I’m in Redondo Beach
