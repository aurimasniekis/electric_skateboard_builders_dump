Good * Cheap * Fast (pick any two)  

In the cheap+fast category, I have this VESCX (older FOCBOX) which could ship for $39.99 as soon as the post office opens Tuesday morning.

For an additional $6.00, I can add a brand new DRV8302 chip with it ...

... but you'd have to repair it yourself and know how to solder surface-mount with hidden ground pad, and have a hot air rework station.  And then hope nothing else is wrong with it, which I don't think there is.  It'd be sold as-is.  It currently is throwing DRV faults.

Not at all, I'm just not going to promise.  I honestly don't think anything else is wrong with it.

I'd prefer to keep it anyway, just trying to help a brother out.  This is a discontinued product.

@KaramQ just jack @Boardnamics shit, I don't think you can find a 40$ vesc that won't die on you in an hour

And also focboxes are pretty damn good idk what you're talking about

@KaramQ

Flipsky 4.12 is $56 shipped from us on AliExpress. Ordered mine last night at 4pm, got the shipping email within hours.

But don't expect, cheap, fast and good all together. I'm only using this for a 8s/20a build.

They shook off in the enclosure, i guess.
I would hear this rattling after a ride....

Maybe someone can explain what they do if it seems to work without?

It's to protect the electronics from voltage spikes and prevent spikes in amps drawn that damage the battery
