Hi guys,

This motor wire came loose. Is there anyone willing to fix it?

I don't want to do it myself unless there is a clear tutorial. As I don't want to damage the motor furthur

Should be fixable, not particularly easy.

Required dismantling & the baseplate probably needs to be removed to get at that side of the stator.

+maybe some stripping of enamel from whatâ€™s left of that phase

APS?

@Andy87 has a nice epoxy mod to ever stop it happening again

It looks like something @Martinsp could maybe offer a service for
