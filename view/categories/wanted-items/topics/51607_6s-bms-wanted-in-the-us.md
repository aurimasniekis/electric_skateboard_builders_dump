Trying to hunt down a 6s BMS if anyone in the US has one.  Charge only or discharge, either way. Thanks!

I only have one I can part with though... It's just for charge only and tiny.

Under normal conditions, it starts balancing any cell above 4.18 and pulling it down pushing to the other cells, so as long as your charger isn't giving more volts then it should, it should be fine.
