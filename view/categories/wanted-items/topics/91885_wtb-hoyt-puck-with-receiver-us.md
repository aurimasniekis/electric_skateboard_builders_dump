Hello, I am working on a new board and am done using the nano-x. I have been looking at the puck because of the great reviews and looks, but the price is a little high. If anyone has one and would want to sell it I would love to take it. I know there is a new cheaper model coming out but can't wait. If anyone knows if there is going to be another group buy please let me know. Thanks for reading. I am in California.

I know this is kinda pointless to say but man I'm pretty sure that's a fuckin damn good remote and nobody short of someone completely quitting the hobby is gonna be selling.

3 or so more months until their $99 model comes out, prolly have to wait till then.

Dammit! That long??? Screw it I’m just gonna buy the $200 one. It’s gorgeous anyway and these disconnects from my Maytech thumb throttle remote are gonna kill me.

I’ll just buy 1 for my dual board. If my single build disconnects it’s not quite as big of a deal. I’ll buy the plastic one for that board in 3 months I guess.

Or you could get an additional receiver and use 1 remote on 2 boards!

I ride with my girlfriend & other friends all the time so I need 2 functioning remotes, but thanks for bringing up that point!
