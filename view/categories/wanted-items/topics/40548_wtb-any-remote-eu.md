Hey guys,

long time since I've been active here. My GT2B mod started malfunctioning and I'm looking for a spare remote to work around the time being. 

Anything in EU is fine :) ! Paypal only.

These have worked well for me.
Or you could see if someone has a spare nano after the black friday deal?

Iâ€˜d also be thankful if anyone has a spare bind plug for me ? I am currently in an internship and donâ€™t have any stuff to make my own. 
Of course, Iâ€™ll cover the shipping fees :)

That price is too low, like 1/3 of the normal cost. Seems fishy
Edit: did it drop that much? I've been kind of absent for a couple of months and i remember them costing around 30 each, now they sell for 10-15?

If you don't want to wait for a long shipping time like ebay.
Banggood has them to and you can pay a little bit more for faster shipping ;)

I got both remotes and still working fine after 6 months. I prefer the bigger remote it feels nice, cheap but reliable and great control.

I got a winning 2.4 Ghz remote that I can sell, few scratches on it.
Edit: It actually isn't really scratched, only very slightly for one month's use.
