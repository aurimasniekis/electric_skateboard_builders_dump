Okay it's not 12s5p but the workmanship and self-developed parts are pretty nice.

Nothing of this caliber will be available off-the-shelf, unless you buy used.  The highest-end commercial board is the Metroboard Dual 35 mile and you'd have to wait a few weeks for them to build it for you.  The lhb Candy Crusher is probably the highest-end prebuilt model on the market right now.

@psychotiller is much closer to you. 
I know he's been busy but asking never hurts. He has the parts to build you a great board pretty quickly. It's just seeing if he has time this week.
He's actually making me a 12s5 now.
If it ment getting him a sale and you on a board asap, I'd be willing to let him use my battery for a board for you and just restart mine when he has a chance.

I have a wait list for builds. There's no getting around it or moving to the front of the line. 2 months out on a complete even if you paid double. Unless I went to china and had them make everything for me...Oh wait, then it would take longer :rofl:

Lol that board came out for sale before the Raptor 2 and there are only like 5 in existence. The production was painfully slow, probably the reason @chaka left the forums to focus on his business

Can‚Äôt go wrong with any of the boards or builders mentioned so far. I have a LaCroix and love it. @psychotiller builds some amazing boards...I rode his 4x4 board this past weekend, I‚Äôm pretty sure it will climb a wall, I‚Äôve literally never been on a board with that much torque...serious esk8 eye candy too.

Up to 3k.   At this point time I think I should stop looking for more stuff to buy.   I was hoping there would be someone looking to sell their build or something like that!    

I have to go over the suggestions you all have made and I will take it from there.    

I appreciate you all   Great info in some amazing boards üëçüèº

What are your thoughts on the Long Hair Boy board?  That thing fits the budget and what it sounds like you might be looking for.

I did hit him up a while back and it didn‚Äôt seem like he was interested in selling the board.   Asked for pics n finally got a couple the other day.   Still might be interested in it.   It looks pretty sick

Haha.  Funny story. Ordered a xl carve.  Took 3 months for me to get.  Rode it a few times then let my boy ride it.  He fell in love with it and kaboom.  He kept throwing hints at me that he wanted it so I let him have.    Sold it to him last week üòÇ
