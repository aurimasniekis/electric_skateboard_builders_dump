Anyone have any success with non eboosted enclosures on a jet spud/tayto. I'm thinking I can't be the only one wondering this. I'm looking for options to mount my motors enclosure side @psychotiller seems to have a couple options that might be close (Stealth 18 and Knuckles) anyone have experiences to share?

I'm really impressed with mine, really sturdy - strong enough to build the battery into

Ben is the tits! His enclosures are both affordable and well built and he won't treat you like a piece of shit after he's done taking your money.

He's the Anna Kendrick of the esk8 enclosure market.

I have a teenage daughter.  I know exactly who Anna Kendrick is.  The other one from twilight.
Looks a bit better now though but still has that mormon smile.

Iâ€™m pretty behind right now, and Iâ€™m working away again in the day job but will try to clear the backlog ASAP. 
@Ariehh this is the only one for the time being. It has 40 cells in the picture.
