looks good if that's what you need :thumbsup:
a little sugru around the switch...

Do you cut your own holes as needed in the lid for the rx, ppm/canbus...?

I haven't seen anything, all the cases get sold as complete 4.xx rebranded (v)escs

There's a hole right next to the ppm pins. 
I messaged the seller about buying up his remaining stock. He's in Lithuania so $38 with free shipping means a good chunk of that $38 is shipping lol. All of them in one shot should be pretty cheap.

I'm also thinking of potting a sucker in there :stuck_out_tongue:

You could just print the or take the shape file to a CANC/Fab shop and have it made...I'd think it would be cheaper.

Hmm that's something to consider, would need some tweaking. I like that his is enclosed with a lip around the perimeter and the enclosure itself is used as a heatsink for the fets

I can draw a top as well as a recess for mounting screws, It'll take a few days to get to it.

That would be awesome, no hurry whatsoever. I dont know of any CNC options around me atm, not that I looked much. That's why I was looking for premade ones

38 bucks just seems like a lot to me, maybe Im wrong.  I'll update the drawing later j the week and make a test print with pla to make sure the fitment is correct.

Well I'm hoping I can get in contact with him directly, if he could do $25/pc without eBay getting involved I would get them instantly, all the hardware bits being included simplifies things too. 

Found the seller on ES, waiting for response.

I would call the $38 a very good price for this enclosure. I can't even get one single CNC motor mount made for less than $200 for just 10 holes with two for the pulley and truck profiles.
