As the title says, I'm looking to buy a used trampa hs11 or holypro deck that's preferrably 15 ply based on their flex chart and my weight.    
  
I'm also willing to buy footstraps if they're attached :)

For shipping purposes, I live in northern California

Lol yeah :grin: I originally saw a listing a few days ago by @gogomrrobot with one but was late to that, then saw yours 1 hour after it was posted (again too late) so I figured I'd just try posting a WTB and see if this strategy might be better
