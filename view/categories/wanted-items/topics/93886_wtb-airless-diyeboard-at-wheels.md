I have the tires I’ll sell for $20 but they don’t have rims. They fit all the cheap ones on eBay/AliExpress 

PM me if interested

I've got a couple of used sets but I wouldn't feel comfortable selling them.

I had these wheels and still do they arent safe at speed.

I have them in a box. You can see the gap between the tire and wheel while riding its scary.

At speed they look like they deform and are just a shitty wheel in general. I had a set for a few weeks and the wobble is crazy.

Thanks I appreciate the response, any recommendations by any chance? I've got the diyeboard 10s5p dual belt but realizing my shitty roads in Maine don't handle these small 83mm wheels well and figured AT would be the way to go.

I concur with what @KaramQ said, the wheels are just unstable at high speeds, and the overall ride can be impacted negatively as a result.


That being said, they do have a chat feature on their website where you can try and ask if they will sell the wheels separate.

Keeping in mind that they are banned from the forum, I am in no way affiliated with DIYeboard, recommending business, or promoting their products, just trying to provide honest (and hopefully helpful) information.

All terrain wheels will sacrifice your range. I know how bad roads in Michigan are, if you want a decent wheel, look into the bergmiesters sold by timo at haggy boards

Understandable. I have tried to reach out to them to buy them separately but have not gotten any responses. I bought the kit second hand barely used and it works for everything I need it for and to get me into this hobby and the modifications have begun as well. But I've read a lot of the horror stories for sure.

Don't buy from this company. They're products are not only cheap, but are dangerous as fuck. Not to mention they will post your credit card info, address, phone number, ect... online. 

Just buy something like these from @dickyho on the forum. https://www.ebay.com/itm/F0-fast-pneumatic-6X2-150mm-inflatable-tyre-wheel-for-electric-longboard/303070670612?hash=item46906b6f14:m:mg_cxN-lmDKY7IaACePKCYQ&var=602004286969

Appreciate the recommendation I'll look into these! They look solid. I'm okay with the range taking a hit as I live within 5miles of anything and everywhere I want to ride ATM. I'm from Michigan originally so I do know the roads are similar but with Maine much more construction and road debris that have made for a rough ride. Hard decision after researching seeing people say you can't ungrade these kits much

It will take a big hit to your range, you’ll probably get about 7-10 miles with the all terrain. It’s so worth it though

Those airless tires are only good if you're above like 185lbs. Lower than that, and at 23mph they literally deform off the rims too easily, and even if you are heavy enough you must ziptie them anyway. They are also horribly inefficient, they take off 60% range compared to street (Normal pnumatics take off 40-50 and you can use higher PSI to gain some of that back). The L-Faster alibaba tires are excellent, you can actually feel them warm up and begin to grip/carve better. Highly recommend you grab dickyho's pulley setup & tires and give them a try, although it looks like you will.

Regarding recommendations: I have had a chance to use the dickyho wheels linked above pretty hard (for a 190lb old man) this week commuting 5-10miles each way on crappy roads. The wheels are 1000x better on my old bones than 90mm thane and they hold together well. I skated a lot in my youth so I like to carve. I tried to see if I could roll the rubber off the rim, i think I started to feel some deformation in a ~25mph corner that wanted to turn into a slide, but that's pushing it for me (my family needs me alive), and in "normal-to-peppy" riding they are perfectly adequate. On a sraight course i feel these wheels are good to al least 30mph (I'm still working up the stones to go that fast on my new board). That said, these wheels are not manufactured to arerospace standards (it's a skateboard not a rocket ship), so if you need wheels to go 30-40+mph, you will likely need "rocket ship" parts, lol... perhaps trampa and bergermister (I have not tried these so cannot compare).

Long story short: @dickyho wheels are great budget wheels for most of those who esk8, especially longer distance/rough  commuting. They are tough, smooth and comfortable. I even heard @chrischo1996 "might" have had a car run over the wheels and he's still rocking them as far as I know. So far I am very happy for the price I paid.

Wow thanks man I really appreciate the in-depth review! I'm around 180lbs and more comfortable even around the 20mph range being only about a month into the hobby/sport. Sounds like that may be my best go to option. I like the airless idea but if this many people have commented stating they are unsafe I'd rather not risk my life and money. Don't see anyone in my state on any eboards yet so the public doesn't understand that capabilities and speed . But sounds like this will be the perfect fit until I can continue to save to really build a nice trampa style board. So thank you again man!

Cool, that was pretty much my plan, get some cheap big wheels now and save up for something nice later...seems like the diyeboard wheels were duds, I don't think they are the same wheel as the dickyho wheel, but I could be wrong.

Agree, have been using the set of the airless tires from Dickyho for around 50km now and they are holding up well!

Probably not as soft as the hole-style, but they dont expand like them during high speed (and probably have less rolling resistance)

They are different, diy were airless and they did look nice as they came in some bright colors almost like some evolve wheels I've seen. But must've been problematic as they only sell them on the full "AT" boards now and don't sell them anywhere separately

Can confirm, mine were ran over to the point where the trucks bent like taffy and the rubber slid off about a quarter of an inch, but once I popped the rubber back into place they're good as new. I regularly hit 30mph on these wheels, but can't say how they perform at higher speeds.

Bought a set from dicky including trucks, motormounts, pulleys, belts, motors and airless wheels a couple of weeks ago. For the price im really impressed. Used the set for about 50km so far and i even hit 60 km/h with the airless wheels (replaced the bushings). Havent noticed any deformation or other issues with the wheels
