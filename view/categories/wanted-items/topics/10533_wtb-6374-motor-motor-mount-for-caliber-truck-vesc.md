Oh nice! I'm about 225-230lbs would that be sufficient for me with a mini set up TB v4 mount? Also what battery would I need 8s?

I think it would be fine! Especially with a lower gear ratio. You can use up to a 12s battery but 10s is recommended.

I know @torqueboards sells them. They are a little pricey, but worth it for the quality. He also sells pulleys / belts. I don't really know anyone else in the US selling them.

Ya, Torqueboards is your best bet in the US. 
They are good about getting your order out quickly as well.
I'm using TB's V4 mounts on my build. They are solid and good design.
Easy to adjust belt tension without affecting bracket angle and they work with a variety of belt lengths and gear sizes.

I have one from the last group buy. Only difference is the silicone wires. I also put 2 flat spots on it for the pulleys. If you want the one with silicone wires your going to have to wait a bit. Either way key me know.

@JLabs  What does the ETA on the product page for the 6354/6374 mean? Is that for when the package arrives or when the you're able to restock?

If you are going single drive you should get at least 12mm drive 15mm preferred if you can find it.  I broke a bunch of 9mm belts before switching.

The one from the last group buy can ship very soon. The silicone wires should be 2-2.5 weeks.
