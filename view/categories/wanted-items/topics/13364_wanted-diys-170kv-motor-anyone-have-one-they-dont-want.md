I contacted Torqurbords and he says they probably won't be getting these again. I have one and want to make a dual drive so I need one more.

Anybody out there have one your not using or don't want?

just use a different motor. its been somewhat confirmed that you'll get better performance than symmetrical...

also it would probably help if you said what size motor....

Good point! edited title with motor size 

My understanding is that a dual asymmetrical drive may have better top speed/torque performance, it is not better from an efficiency standpoint.
I've Been doing research and testing for a while and have 6 differnt motors. the  torque bards 170kv 6355 is perfect for what I want in terms of balance of speed, torque and efficency for my 12s setup on my everyday cruiser

if it has more speed and torque with same power then its obviously more efficient also. its just a matter of tuning that efficiency point to a everyday riding style...

most of your real world range is going to depend on how you ride anyways.....
