Like the Titel says, i am currently looking for a enclosure out of ABS or similar (Kydex)  in the EU or germany. Hence i cant find a good supplier there.

I already made one from Kydex but that does not work so well like i imagined, it is to stiff and without vaccum it isnt really possible.

Please help me providing some informations.

regards,
