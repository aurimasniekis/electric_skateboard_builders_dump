It's called urathane, and the biggest available urathane wheels out rn are the TB 110

Thx man, I am asking for the comfort side of the issue.. For the polyurethane wheels, after what size you say "ok thats not comfy anymore, I should go with the air filled wheels" :) Is that 110mm size (75-80 A I guess) ok for longboard rides ?

110's are urathane, it's 78a

Longboarders dont use massive wheels.

Bigger urathane = more comfy

if you compare TB110 and abec107, i'd go for abec107. the only reason being they're softer and they have a better quality urethane formula. (at least in my opinion)
