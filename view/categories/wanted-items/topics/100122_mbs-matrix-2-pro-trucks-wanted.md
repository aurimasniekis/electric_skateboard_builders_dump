Hi. Not looking to pay $200 for trucks... Please advise.  I have motor mounts for these trucks and a complete setup just trying to find them had a better price.   Also, they come with 12 mil diameter shafts.  All of my wheels are for 10Mm.  Does anyone know how or where I could get the bearings to fit my MBS wheels??

Ok... Perfect.  Please just confirm these are the MBS Matrix 2 Pro Trucks with the Metal Baseplate??  Can you send me a pic?  I believe so... Just wanted to confirm and the 12 Mill bearings will help as well!  Thx! üëç

The MBS Matrix 2 pros are the ones with the composite base and the metal matrix II are the ones with the aluminum baseplate. those are 180$ a set. I have both, and thats the best price I can do right now on the metal matrix II

Are they brand new? I think I would rather spend $20 extra for a brand new set.  Also, what color bushings did you receive??
