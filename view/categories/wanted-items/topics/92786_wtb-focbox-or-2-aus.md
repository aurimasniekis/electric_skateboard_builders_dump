Getting pretty rare nowadays mate.  Sad day when they discontinued the focbox.  Easily the most reliable esc I have used.  There are a few good options available though.  What are you planning on using them for?

For a powerful 6374/84 dual motor build, I have a raptor 2 at the moment, using dual focboxes.

They are very reliable as you said, which is why i am looking for them.

Unity if you're not in a hurry and the flipsky fsesc dual is a good unit too.  All vesc derivatives are fully programmable via vesc tool.  What size battery are you planning on going with?

Would use 10S first, but 12 S for sure in the future.

The flipsky looks good mate, have you used it? heard of any issues with it?

I will do a search on it, just want your personal experiences also, thanks

Good pal has had the fsesc 6.6 and done at least 6k on them with some very hard riding.  I have used focboxes (have 8 on various stuff) Hk 4.12, maytech 4.12, and Torqueboards.  Best value for money and availability are the HK ones.  Cheap as chips and run 10s just fine.  I have run them on 12s and they worked a treat but I only ran them for a couple of weeks so no long term testing.  Others have though with no issues.  I couldn't see any performance differences with the focboxes either.  Think they run at 120 bucks and you get them within a week from the aus warehouse.  I only got a set because I managed to fry my can bus chips on the focboxes.  Never bothered swapping them back out when I got replacements.  Still going strong after 8 months or so.

This is the one you mean mate?

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-esc-v4-12-for-electric-skateboard-conversion-w-bec.html?___store=en_us

It says they are rated for 12 S, will also research about the other ones you mentioned.

Much appreciate the knowledge.

Thats the one.  It does run 12s fine.  One thing to consider too is the returns policy with HK.  It is the absolute best.  I killed one vesc by reversing the battery polarity (don't ask lol) and they swapped it no questions asked.  Killed 2 of their motors too and again replaced no questions and no send back bullshit.  Thats a big plus for me because I do have a tendency to blow shit up. My 4,12's are in my test rig now as are sk8 motors with no problems.

[quote="moon, post:18, topic:92786"]
FS 4.12
[/quote]

Very nice build mate, i think i will be buying those instead of the unity, as enertion said if you change the phase wire connectors which we have to anyway if we use other motors, the warranty will be void.

And also considering the shipping time less than 1 week is great :slight_smile:

May i know the specs of the build in the picture, and top speeds etc? Thanks

Its my test rig so it changes all the time.  Its where products go to die.  In this iteration it has a 10s4p 30 q in it and the 192 kv sk8.  Running 16/36 gearing with 97mm wheels.  Will tear your shoes off torque wise because as its the test rig its amped up way beyond any sane settings and will top out at about 55kmh or thereabouts.  Not done any speed testing on it. 

 ![IMG_1053|666x500](upload://8k0FlHhDaYmEqYzcIzJAM9QTSHP.jpeg) 

This is the current fav ride though and thats running 12s4p 30q with focs 15/36 gearing and 97mm wheels.  Its a whole different animal.  Can only be described as ridiculous and it will eventually kill me.  Both will smash a raptor 2 for torque but this one will make it feel like a toy in comparison.  This has been gps'd and speed gunned and my best top end was 72kmh
or 45mph.

Anything that will make Raptor look like a toy is a beast in my view.

I will hopefully build the same as your second one with the silver motors mate.

I already bought the falcon 40 deck, have a 10s4p battery which i will swap for a 12S later on.

Can you tell me what motors you are using on this one?

Faithful old HK sk3 192's  Unsensored though so require a kick but with enough throttle they don't cog and are very rock solid.

why would they discontinue it if it was such a good product for those people only wanting to do a single motor setup or just dual foc's and motors?

Because you can sell the Unity for a higher price. There was nothing wrong with original FocBoxes.
