I'm looking for a second hand spot welder or someone to weld up a pack I'm wanting to build.

Either one of the cheap China welders or even one of the Arduino ones would be fine. 

Or

Is there someone who welds packs around the London / SE area?

You can try googling for battery repacking in your area, i know a couple here in Melbourne that do it, the sunkko spotwelders arent that expensive either, especially if you split cost's, their about 150usd shipped for the 787a+

You know what, I'm thinking I might as well but a spot welder. I can either rent the thing out or weld packs for people as it seems a little dry in the UK

I have by my Spot welder by Ebay i became it from from UK warehouse 

But the problem was that when u used the Welder was 230V an 16A fuse 

not enough.

I have  380V and there was 3 x 230V 20A and i used only 1 phase from

the 3 and then working with 20A Fuse.

Sunkko 787 

I think when you want a good Welder, you must build your self.

What about the 709a? All these devices need a leakage breaker. Starting to sound complicated and probably even more expensive. Maybe the Arduino kit that uses a 12 V car battery would be better. Its Â£50 and all I need is a car battery, welding tips. 

Also sounds a lot safer

I've just finished my Soldered pack. I know in an ideal world you'd spot weld but it might be an option if costs start spiraling. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/4/3425c36e5357b4e1820ef919933070451a489fb4.jpeg" width="690" height="388">

I did think about that but I'm worried about damaging cells. The Arduino kit is not expensive and will probably cost me Â£100. I can then at least weld more packs in the future. I'm thinking of building a second board this summer.

Funny how quickly before the first board is finished, thoughts turn to the next haha. I closely watched the voltages of the cells as I worked and took as many measures as I could to avoid heat building up, working in a freezing workshop probably helped too. I guess time will tell.

At least keep us all informed of how it performs @Norco

I'd been keeping watch on this [http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/also-usa-10s4p-samsung-25r-190/12458?u=hardwiring](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/also-usa-10s4p-samsung-25r-190/12458?u=hardwiring)  @EssEnn but I arrived after the party was over,

I spotted 1 post in it however

> I can build you a custom battery if you can wait one more month

Its about post 60.... I was thinking of PMing Tarzan or checking his previous posts as shipping to/from Germany might be do-able or just do this @TarzanHBK and see if he is going to start offering welding  or pack manufacture at a reasonable cost.

I have most of the parts ready for a build and the battery is going to hold me up TBH I will chuck in some cash towards a welder if that's the best option

Will do. I double checked every joint and all seemed solid. My concern was that any flex or twist might over time pull the joints apart but now it is wrapped in heat shrink it feels rock solid.

Well i have put my name down in the waiting list for  the Arduino kit. Hopefully they will be back in stock on the 17th and I can order one. 

@Hardwiring where are you located? I've pretty much decided that I'm going to get my own welder. I have not idea how much it is all going to cost. I'll work that out tomorrow but I think it could be doable if I go the Arduino route.  I'm going to try and get one of these https://www.tindie.com/products/KaeptnBalu/diy-arduino-battery-spot-welder-prebuilt-kit/ and then its just a car battery, wire, copper and a car battery. And a battery charger. And a foot switch. I recon I can find some of it cheap.

How are your soldiering skills? I'm up in matlock, I looked at that kit, the soldiering of the wires that lead to the tip were my ownly concern. You just need to use quite a powerful Iron to make good quality connections. 

Keep me in the loop, this might be the best solution.

I saw that link but i think the 12V method is a lot safer. 

The Arduino kit is about Â£55 landed to the UK. Battery chargers new from halfords are Â£25. I'm going to try and source a second hand car battery (I know a few mechanics who might have some knocking about) preferably a sealed one so shipping is a lot easier. 12V PSU is easy, about Â£6 on Amazon. Then its just the cables and copper welding thingys. 

I reckon it could be put together for about Â£100 and I can use my works UPS account to ship anywhere in the UK for about Â£15 MAX each way. 

I just hope the guy is going to have enough available when they go on sale on the 17th!

yeah i saw that one but then the small print at the end

Buyer will need to source:-
6 or 8 power MOSFETs, gate resistors, single sided copper clad board for power module.
One Schottky diode
One TVS diode
Weld cable - 25mm sq minimum recommended
Copper wire for electrodes - 5mm recommended, soldered to ends of weld cable.
12 V dc mains power adapter.
Footswitch - normally open.

I'm actually working on building my own spot welder with super capacitors. Right now it kinda works, pretty badly lol, but it does. All I'm using are 4x 500F 2.7V caps in a 2S2P config for a total of 5.4V at 500F and I just soldered two "electrodes" to the terminals, which are just really thick solid copper wire. Then I just press them both against a battery tab on a 18650 for half a second, and it works. Now obviously this isn't a long term solution because it has a lot of problems, though it did only cost me around $15 to do.

I'm planning on setting up a Arduino controlled MOSFET switch with a foot pedal for doing it in the future. I'm planning on using IRLB3034 FET's because 1, I already have some 2, they have a gate-to-source turn on of only 4.5V so I can use them with low voltage cap banks and with logic level voltages (5V) and 3, there relatively cheap.

IMUO providing that amps to spot weld nickle isn't the hard part, control is the problem. Ideally a double pulse of a controlled duration is desired from what I have read

Yeah I can see were thats true because you can just pickup a car battery and do it pretty easily, but I wanted to do it with super capacitors mainly because I didn't have a spare car battery laying around, and also I really like these caps lol. I'm still going to see about designing a control circuit maybe with a little 16x2 LCD display and a couple knobs for controlling pulse length and what not. Main problem I'm having right now is deciding whether or not I should use a MOSFET gate driver, and if so which fricking one!

esk8 is just a dilemma from start to finish sometimes lol

Getting a car battery is easy or you can just use two 3S lipo's in series. Though I'd not trust using Lipo just because of the fire hazard.

I actually put serious thought into buy a Chinese spot welder for about 125 then flogging it on when I'm done and just swallow the loss as the cost of doing the job. I've tried finding a second hand one and they're as rare as rockinghorse dodee so I think would sell for good price.

Same but they use high voltage so you need a leakage breaker I think. Not something that is installed into every home. 
Also those cheap china ones only weld max 0.15mm nickle strips when you really want to be using 0.3mm. You need to spend at least Â£200 I think. Or you have to double up on the nickle strips but that is more work. 

I contacted the seller of the Ardunio kit and he expects the PCB's to clear customs any minute now and should have the pre-built kits available to buy over the weekend. The other bits I can pick up with ease in a few days and then i can test it on some old 18650's I have knocking about

Well let me know about the BMS as I need to source one. I'm also going to need a charger and figure out how it all works

I bought my batteries from Amazon for Â£3.90 each delivered (I have amazon prime so no shipping fees). Just order them in pairs as that is the cheapest option. I looked everywhere and that worked out the cheapest and fastest. Also no tax or duties to pay either.

Reading the instuctions they say to use a separate PSU to power the arduino. Probably to protect the chips when the battery shorts.
