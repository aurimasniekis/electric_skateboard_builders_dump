Are you more looking for the size, or the kick tail and handles?

Ok I was going to recommend the Jet Spud but it does not have a kick tail. Good luck with your search!

According to the DNS system, they have no server.  That's the situation on the ground.

I have a few deck that are around the 27-29 size with a wheel base of 14” these are custom decks so you could choose the graphics on the board if you would want that option ![image|500x500](upload://zcWCy8y7T42GwBIJnAlqGnl25di.jpeg)

Those are the decks that I have in stock.

I’m personally going to be using freeboard S2 “bindings” to take tight turns and stay locked in at speed. 

I should have a build thread coming in a few weeks

Is the price a problem? If not riptide sells the deck only now for 119$. Personally I love it!

I wouldn't support the rip-off company "(ride-)riptide" as long as they are ripping off the real "RipTide" aka Alphamail (Brad).
On the one hand you have made in china, the other a high quality American product developed and manufactured by the company themselves.

What?! They asked permissions for the the name. They’re a decent cheaper alternative to more expensive eboards with a proper support. I do agree that when possible we should support USA manufacturing.

No they haven't. Brad asked them to cease trading with his name, they said they wouldn't call them selves riptide any more, and would go by ride-riptide.
Brad didn't agree to this, regardless all they did was register a website called ride-riptide but continue to refer to them selves as "Riptide". So they didn't keep their word there either.
