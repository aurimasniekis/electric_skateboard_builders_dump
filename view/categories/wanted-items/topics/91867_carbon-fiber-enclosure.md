Hi all,

I am hoping I can have someone from this forum make me a carbon fiber enclosure like Master Cho use to make. I'm located in US East Coast, I finished my build, and really want my enclosure to be clean and compliment my build I'll will post a pic of the enclosure style Master Cho made. 

I reached out to Master Cho and he informed me he no longer offer enclosures.

Here's pics of the Carbon Fiber style I'm interested in. The Honeycomb design, with the shape of the second pic. @Jinra, I need the case to cover 19x6x2 inches.![IMG_5588|666x499](upload://xcOyQ8sJOjAh1yK3aLX6nYwM4Cl.JPG) ![42)|690x354](upload://vgaD2vkKY7FYPgzcsjzTCLzWUKl.jpg)

The enclosure was made for a 10s2p, but the unity is pretty chunky. You might be able to make it work if you're good at cable management and organization.

This deck is generic purchased on Amazon. I've seen a few used on builds here in the forum.

Hopefully your deck is wood, because carbon fiber blocks airwaves for the remote.

If it's carbon fiber.  I don't have one, so I don't know.  It might be fiberglass made to look like carbon fiber.  :grey_question:

What stiffener is in the resin though?  I would guess fiberglass but maybe carbon fiber.  You'd have to ask @trampa

A carbon fiber deck is fine, as long as the enclosure is not carbon fiber.  Also, the other way around.  If both of them are carbon fiber, then you need to somehow route the receiver antenna outside the enclosure and deck.

Plus additional, I used the underboard tray from trampa on one carver deck. According to trampa the materials are the same. Never had drop out of signal issues.
