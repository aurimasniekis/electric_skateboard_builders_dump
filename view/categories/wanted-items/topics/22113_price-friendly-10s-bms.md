So I have a 10s2p battery, along with a vesc. Would a 10s 45A bms be safe?

These are the best available and they are reasonably priced.
80a continuous discharge, 20a charge, built in E-switch saving you $40-$60 that you would spend on an external E-switch.

send an email to lucy@bestechpower.com
copy this image to pdf file and attach it.
Tell here you would like to purchase this bms with these specifications.
Note: this bms comes with balance harness and a built in anti-spark E-switch.
Note: these specs are for Lipo application. For Li-ion application you can lower the over discharge detection to 2.8v or leave it at 3v

Thanks. I have a 10s 45A bms at the moment, would I be able to use it temporarily until I can get the money together for the new ones? Here's a link to what I'm running. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/parts-and-wiring-setup/22054/4

You should be ok, Just set your vesc batter max amps to 45a or less if you are discharging through the bms.

Mine burned out (my mistake) recently and I ordered the same one as a replacement. Can't be beat in terms of size IMO. I also do **not** discharge through it.

What do you mean by discharging through it? In the link I posted there's a diagram of my wiring plans. Will you tell me if I'm discharging through the bms and if so how to fix that?

## \#11 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-05-01T12:31:25.066Z Reads: 285

```
BMS's are designed to manage and protect the battery during charge and discharge cycles. 
This is what is meant by charging through or discharging through the BMS. 
Some people have taken a BMS designed for low current applications and used them in high current applications such as an Eskate. 
To do this they will bypass the bms during the discharge cycle. Doing this will circumvent any protection from the bms during discharge and is a compromised setup.

Your diagram is not bypassing for discharge

got three from:

How should the parameters be set on the BMS @Namasaki mentioned: http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html

.. if using LG HG2 in a 10s3p config?

There are several adjustable parameters. If I get an answer from Besttech maybe they'll have a suggestion as well.

The feature I like the most about the Bestech is the e-switch, you could save US$ 45 as you won't need to buy an antispark switch. 

However, what I also hate is that you need to have the switch on in order to charge the board which makes no sense at all.

Ya, I can't figure why they designed it that way but then I'm not an electronic engineer either.

so when you say that is built in..... i can solder a cheap switch from EBay... or i still need to buy a power switch like this https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/120amp-12s-power-switch ? i ask because i dont understand the e-wtich

thanks! :slight_smile:

```
Any on/off switch will work to activate the electronic switch that is built into the bms. 
Just connect the 2 white wires coming from the bms 
If you use a light up switch you will have to supply voltage for the light from another source because the bms does  not supply 5v for the light.
If you use one of those light up switches, disregard the instruction that come with it. You will have to figure out with a multimeter how to connect the wires.

I would recommend this switch because they are more robust, they have a very convenient quick connector and they are only 16mm dia. So they're easirer to fit on the edge of your enclosure. 
And they come in a variety of colors.
