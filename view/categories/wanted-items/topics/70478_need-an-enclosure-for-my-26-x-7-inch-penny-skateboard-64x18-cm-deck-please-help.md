Hello everyone, 

This is the first time I am starting a topic so bear with me, please. For quite some time I've been studying electric skateboards and now that I selected all of my parts I am stuck on what I thought the "easiest step" enclosure. 
Does someone offer any enclosures that can fit my deck (26x7 inch (64x18 cm))? I would appreciate it a lot. 
Maybe it is good to mention that I am living in The Netherlands, Europe.
Thanks for the help, I appreciate it. 

P.S. This will be my first esk8 so I will probably have more questions in the future. Looking forward to work with you all.

Well, as long as you know the correct words to your questions you could find your esk8 answers straight away just by using the forum search (extremely effective) 

There's a great forum topic/post that will help you familiarize yourself with all things esk8.
