In the USA, I noticed the similar post where mmammer reccomended “https://buildkitboards.com/products/bestech-bms?variant=7201537785886”

Unfortunately the day after they sold out of the 12s li-ion d223v1 model. Damn, was just about to buy one. Anyone got an extra on of these for sale?

I got it man. That’s a good deal though. I’m sure someone will grab it from you quick. For some reason I can’t edit this title.
