Hey everyone! I am starting my second build, and I want to make this one really special and unique. I want to keep the boosted board theme, therefore I was thinking @solidgeek 's firefly remote. I love the design and think the LCD screen is really cool. I really don't trust myself to make my own because I don't have the experience. Thanks, please offer in the comment section if you are willing to sell a complete one. I live in USA. Was going to buy last year when @SeeTheBridges had them for sale, but he is no longer accepting applications and I wasn't trying to start my second build then.
