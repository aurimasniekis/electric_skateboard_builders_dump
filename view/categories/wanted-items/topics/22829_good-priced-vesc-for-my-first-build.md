I need a VESC for my first Esk8 build, but really don't want to be spending anything more than about $120 Aus. I put another topic up on electronics about my general parts list, if I could some more feedback on that it would be great. Tips on buying, making, and anything else would be greatly appreciated.

You can ask these in that first topic you created.

I know I just figured maybe some other people might see it here and if someone has a good priced one they might say so
