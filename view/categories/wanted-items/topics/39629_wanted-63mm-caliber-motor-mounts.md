if you get the TB mounts be mindful of all the fasteners. One of the reasons i don't use them anymore is there's too damned many of them and they eventually rattle loose no matter how much threadlock you use. 

They're about as convenient as it gets though as far as being able to adjust things. They're just too high maintenance for me.

check out @marcmt88 , he designs/machines them himself.  I picked one up last weekend and it's very nice quality.

Looks good but only for 50mm motors

Actually that is for 63mm as well. The 55mm he was talking about in the description I believe is about being able to fit 55mm WIDE motors in conjunction with calibers and 15mm belts without having to mod the calibers. I think. @JLabs ?

Yes, Iâ€™m referring to 55mm in length ie: 6355 **(55)** in length

Yep. Paging @marcmt88. His mounts are superior to the TB mounts since they include idler pulleys. Same pricing too I think...

Yes, better design on the clamp as well, it clamps on and cinches tight with a single bolt, instead of a bunch of grub screws digging into aluminum.

Yeah I had an issue with diyeboard trucks because they flat out broke. Now he wants me to pay for shipping for replacements<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/8/18e20dd800d27a79b632cc1b1e11f9026147e633.jpeg" width="375" height="500">
