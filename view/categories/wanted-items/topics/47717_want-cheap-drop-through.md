To be honest it doesn‚Äôt have to have the drop out I just need a board lower to the ground as I have very little control over my board as I get higher speeds because my board is not really meant for this.

You are not far from NYC I‚Äôm sure you can find a cheap board on Craigslist. Other then that you will not find a decent quality board for $30.

I already looked on craigslist because I was going to suggest that too, but

A) @dg798 still hasn't put their location on their profile and
B) they were still 2-3 times the ridiculous budget OP set, at a minimum

If you have time but no money, you can learn to ride what you have. This will give you the skills to ride anything and you will not feel limited by your equipment. Be a samurai boarder.
