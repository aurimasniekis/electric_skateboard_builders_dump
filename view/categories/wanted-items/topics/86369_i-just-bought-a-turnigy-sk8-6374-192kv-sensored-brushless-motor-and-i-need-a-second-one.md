As the title says, I bought one of them, because it didn't let me add a second one to my cart and now I need another one and its not in stock. I paid 89 for the one I bought, so I am willing to pay right under 100 for this second one if it's in new condition, if it's used, still message me and we will talk! Please someone help, I really want to finish my build! 

This is the motor by the way [here!](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-192kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html)

Idk if you're still looking but I saw them on hobbyking for $97. [Link](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-192kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html)

Thinking of buying it for my board, how is one motor woking out for you?

I ended up back ordered it and they’re shipping it right now, personally, i like it, it’s like a more bulky sk3 192kv
