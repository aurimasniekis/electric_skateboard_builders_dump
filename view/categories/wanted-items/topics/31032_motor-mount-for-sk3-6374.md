Apollo trucks, never heard about them and have a hard time believing there are special mounts for them. Are they like paris trucks?

I think you could try HKs mount for these trucks and that motor:

are you mounting the motor back or front of the back truck? i ask because your longboard is a drop through so does not matter what mount your are getting you will hit the motor with the deck if you make a curve....

You probably could topmount it to get the clearance needed.

Maybe I'll put it behind because it's too low and to raise it I should change the truck
