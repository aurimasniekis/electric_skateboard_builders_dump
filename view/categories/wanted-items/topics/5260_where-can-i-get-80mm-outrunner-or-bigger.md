Hey, some of you maybe remember this motors ([80-100](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__5142__Turnigy_80_100_B_130Kv_Brushless_Outrunner_eq_70_55_.html)). Can't find anything similar that isn't totally overpriced:(
Looking for similar motors, can also be bigger than 80mm dia, and preferably low kv.

Yeah, but this is overpriced. The Turnigy 80-100 was under 100â‚¬ on HK.
