I'm after a set of these in either green or black (Evolve) I'm not fussed but they need to be new or in real good condition please?

I can get them from the states for around Â£120 and from Evolve direct for Â£140 so looking for a decent improvement on that price please, otherwise I'll just buy new.

Cheers :+1:

Hi e.board_solutions !

Can we get informations on this "New Black Superfly", please ? Duro, size and the rest is known and can be seen on the pictures but I can't find any other website mentioning this Superfly (even on the ABEC 11 website) so is this a limited edition or you're just really well informed on this new product ?

I'm really interested anyway but need to chose between black and green now ! ;)

Do you think the Reflys are black reflex flywheels?  Interesting.
