If you don't mind me asking, why don't you want a maytech VESC? I ask because I am from Europe and the may tech looks like one of the cheapest alternatives

Because I have bad experience with MayTech VESCs, but I think i will have to buy it again, because tehre is not other alternative in Europe...

I strongly advise against Maytech VESCs. They are, at least currently, the epitome of Chinese knockoffs. They don't give back to the creator of the VESC (Benjamin Vedder) and while they may function, it's almost a guarantee that they will fail you within a year or less. If you attempt anything substantial with them (higher amps, FOC, mountain board, etc), you'll be un-happy even faster. Save up a little more and get a VESC from a reputable seller (@Decdog's recommendation of esk8.de is a great option for the EU)

Also it's a way of giving back to the community.
Supporting the sellers that drive this community is important.
Buying Maytech VESCs is a big "F... You" to the community - at least that is how I see it.

I have a pair of Vanda VESC I could let go, see my build thread for photos (in Ireland). It's brand new 4.12 model, I read that the vesc should have maybe 3 caps but they were made to exact vedder specs so have only one, I can include the spare caps at no extra charge for soldering in parallel afaik.
Fitted with xt90 plugs.
I'll eat the shipping cost but would like what I paid $110 per vesc

Is it complete VESC with capacitors or just the "card"?

They come with only one capacitor installed, some vendors install 3 capacitors in order to avoid problems with long battery <-> vesc cables and current spikes, I have extra capacitors to install if that is required, it is a simple task but I have just moved so not got around to it.

Ps. I did get hit with â‚¬70 of import charges too but that's my problem.they are made in South Korea to a very good build quality.

They are new and unused

these are maytechs. egreenmotion is a maytech reseller. at least with the vescs. I bought one from them.. didn't live long. its in repair in china cince at least 2 months now..
as with the other maytechs, these don't have a bootloader.. but you can buy some kind of special cable/jig thing to flash them.

looks like it. but I bought it directly via their website 
http://e-greenmotion.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=282&search=vesc

you don't really need the bootloader for normal operation. there are custom firmwares that give you even more control and features that you won't be able to install without one.

Thanks

And you are right, it`s a Maytech vesc, just go an answer from the seller. Any change they have improved in 2017 ? I think my friend is going to be sorry to hear that.

I run the VESC from esk8.de and it`s just roox :-)

as of 3 month ago when mine died and I had to do some research on it, the maytechs firmware had a bug that you need to be aware of : http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-cant-control-motor-anymore/22322/8

no idea if they have fixed it since then.

I have some spare VESC and located in Germany, so shipping is no big deal. I am really impressed with the breaking capabilities of the VESC. We have steep hills here and it is just as awesome going them up with a hell of accelaration then having not to worry about going down. Breaking is very smooth and strong (depends on setting). 
I am riding 6374 190kv and 10S setup.

The VESC(brand new) is 120â‚¬ including shipping. Can solder some XT90S on it as well for 4â‚¬

I have also 190KV 6374 Maytech sensored Motor to sell. 3 Vesc and 3 Motors available.

Regards
Sebastian

I just checked 2 new maytech vescs that I got directly from maytech this week. These seem to be different (newer?) from the ones e-greenmotion is selling. theirs say good for 10S while the new maytech ones say 12S:

as far as I can tell the firmware seems fine.. still without bootloader though, I think.

They are the same one that i sell. No Problem with the maytech stuff so far. The VESC ist quite a simple PCB compared to other stuff comming fromm asia, so there ist No point to blame Chinese stuff all the time in General. You get what you pay for like always.
