I've got a trip to the US coming up in a few months and was wondering what parts are cheaper over there and worth bringing back.
I was thinking of a getting a pair of TB 218mm trucks as shipping is cheaper. 

Anything else worth thinking about?

Pretty much everything is cheaper in the US if comparing to Europe. Motors, mounts, trucks, wheels... anything you think of!Though cells are not, nkon.nl is the cheapest place to get those.

Most things are cheaper in the states. Especially things that only ships from the states like the TB 218 you mentioned. Or Psychotillers sixshooter. Def. worth bringing back if thats what you are looking at. Customs often kills you :)
