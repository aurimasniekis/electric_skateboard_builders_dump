You can run a smaller belt on a larger pulley.  I use 15mm pulleys on all of my builds but 1, I run a 13mm pulley on it.

Hey Mike!

I could use two (2) 15 mm motor pulleys. Yours are steel or aluminum?

Aluminum, 15T HTD5M 15mm.  I just happen to have some extras, not really selling a bunch of stuff. I can send you a couple if you want them, but the DIY steel are better.
