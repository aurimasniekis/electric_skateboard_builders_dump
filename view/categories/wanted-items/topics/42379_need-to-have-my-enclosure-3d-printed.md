I have an stl file with a design someone on the forum made for me. At that time I had access to a 3d printer but now it’s currently broken so does anyone want to 3d print this for me for cheap?

Shoot me the STL file to summitlabsllc(at)outlook(dot)com. I’ll be able to print it for you. What exactly do you mean by cheap tho?
