Seems like a solid plate would work the best. Aluminum or stainless or steel?

You could use big T-nuts and run the screws up from the bottom.

You might have to cut the screws or stack a couple washers between the baseplate and screwhead..

They are steel, from ace hardware.

The kind without barbs.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è my go-to knife I've been modding and using for 4 years or so..


I've stocked up them in case they quit making them..
Fits in the key pocket, allowing my edc folder to clip below it on the standard front pocket.




Blue loctite on the screw.
