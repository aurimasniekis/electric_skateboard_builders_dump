Is there anyone in the Portland/Vancouver area that has a sector 9 drift or Chanelle helmet? I want to try one on before I buy. Also is anyone looking at possibly selling any full face w/ visor helmets?

Even though many MC helmets, including the SS1600 weigh around the same as a full face downhill helmet there are design differences, field of vision concerns, ability to hear around you and loads of other factors to take into account.

You should ask yourself why DH bombers doing crazy speeds are using skate specific helmets and apply that to yourself.
