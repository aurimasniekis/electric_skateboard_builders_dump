he hasn't got anything, he's just telling you that you need to include this information. for one, foc in vesc 4 isnt really recommended and nor is 12s. so if you specify these things it'll help you finding a vesc

Flipsky has some good vescs. $80 and it will arrive in about 10 days. Buy it from eBay it’s cheaper
