I'm looking for a 10s4p to 10s5p Battery pack to further pimp my Wowgo. I currently have 2x 6.4Ah batteries with different cells though.
Cell wise 30Q preferred but Panasonic etc is good too as long as it gets me to my destination and won't sag like my LG cells.

Custom or prebuild is fine. Preferred to have a BMS installed.

Did you build them yourself? What range did you get out of it?
