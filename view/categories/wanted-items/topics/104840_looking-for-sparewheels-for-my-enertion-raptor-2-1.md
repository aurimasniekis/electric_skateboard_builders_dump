Since Enertion is not selling wheels anymore it's almost impossible to get a replacement.
I'm looking for R-Spec 90, 97 or 100mm outwheels, as long as they keep me riding :smiley: 

I'm living in germany.
Thanks a lot for any suggestions or help.

Same here!! Perhaps any ex-Enertion folks could hook us up with the supplier?

I donâ€™t know if you will find sleeves for your hubs but JeffWu back on the other forum is doing a run of the same hub motors boosted has on their boards. He also knows the factory who made the Rspecs but I donâ€™t know if he plans anything with them.
