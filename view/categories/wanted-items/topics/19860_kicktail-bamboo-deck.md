I have grabbed a few from funbox dist.  Not sure about price given shipping to EU, but check them out:

I haven't electrified it yet, but i have the 38 camber to try - looking for a split enclosure like vanguard - nice soft absorbing flex deck was the goal.

One of the EU folks might have other options that are closer/faster/cheaper.

Look forward to seeing it.

if you are looking for a 29' deck, you should consider a bustin bonsai; that's more expensive but it has a lot of pop. You can also get some nice discounts here and there.
