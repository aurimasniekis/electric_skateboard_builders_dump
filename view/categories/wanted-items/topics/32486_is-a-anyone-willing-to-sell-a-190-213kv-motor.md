Hey! On a budget build and looking for a nice 190-213 kv motor, but would rather not buy an expensive new one. Does anyone have any to spare (so I can buy)?

Thanks Pat.speed! I think I'm going to go with that route! Thanks Rich though, I think the 6355 is too small for torque and speed in a monobuild
