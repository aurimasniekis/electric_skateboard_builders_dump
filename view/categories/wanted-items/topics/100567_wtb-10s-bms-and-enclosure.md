Hello all! I'm from Chile and Bestech doesn't ship this way.

I'm looking for a good 10S BMS, I'm using an antispark so the e switch isn't necessary. 

Also I'm looking to buy an enclosure for my deck, no bigger than 23" x 7 1/2" .

Very appreciated! Kind regards to you all!

Pablo.

I have a mailbox in Miami that could work, depending on shipment costs. If not, I get small things shipped by USPS (US postal). What BMS do you have? Regards,
