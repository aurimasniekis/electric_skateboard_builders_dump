I have purchased pure nickel on ebay it's just hard to find sometimes. I purchased .2x25 from a guy here in the US on eBay and it was pure I assume he purchased a very large roll in China and is selling off all the extra.

Yes but there may be some similar people doing the same thing. I hear Ebiking is big in Europe so there should be alot of DIY guys with stuff that we need.

I think I have some

But I need to make sure it's pure nickel. I did buy it as pure nickel.

I can't confirm how much I have but it's around 5meters. 8mm 0.15mm thick

Why do nobody have 10mm 0.2mm pure..... I don`t want my nickel, to be the bottleneck.... So 10mm 0.2mm would be nice...
Copper for the series connections, is okay to find. But not nickel :-/
