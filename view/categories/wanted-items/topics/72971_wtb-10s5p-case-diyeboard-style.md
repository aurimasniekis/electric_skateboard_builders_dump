Are you taking about the really deep enclosure with the pointed front?  If so I have a new one you can have for free,  just pay the shipping.

absolutely..! I could have tried to gut my old meepo case to try n fit more than a 2p in it... since this will fit thier 5p style battery will give me some wiggle space to build a 3p and some electronics!

FYI, be careful when you open the package.  There is a gasket in there that will cut easy.
