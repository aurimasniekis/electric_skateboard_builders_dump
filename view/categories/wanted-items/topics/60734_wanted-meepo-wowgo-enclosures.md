Looking for a Meepo/Wowgo enclosure for a temporary board I’m building for a friend. I’d normally have them sent directly from China, but I’m on a time crunch for said friend.

Today my ownboard kit arrived.
They have the same enclosures I guess?
I'm not going to use them so if you want them let me know :wink:
I'm from Belgium
I only need to remove the esc, switch and voltage display.

Oh damn sorry I just saw you live in California, that's going to be way to expensive to ship :smile:

Unfortunately so. I’m banking on somebody living in the USA to priority mail their spare enclosures to me. Thanks for letting me know regardless!

The metal ones are honestly not that much more durable, they are made super week i had one collaps on me after hitting a bump with it 

Not my pic but for reference, this is how they break.

The Plastic is still very brittle versus the metal enclosures. That board in particular was run over by a car.
