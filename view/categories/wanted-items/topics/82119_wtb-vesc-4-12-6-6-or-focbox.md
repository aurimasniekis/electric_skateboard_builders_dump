Hi guys,

I bricked my focbox the other day. Does anyone have a spare or used  VESC? Or a place to get them for a fair price?

I got a TB 4.12 that will have a replaced USB port I'm fixing, it's got a couple miles so it's basically new, just a little ugly

Sent it you @Martinsp for repair. I think it’s like 35€ plus shipping round about.
As you in EU, shipping shouldn’t be much.
