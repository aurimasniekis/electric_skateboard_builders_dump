So I'm looking for some parts for my first build and was wondering if there were any good deals out there, whether from a website or if you have and extras just lying around.

•  **2x** _12008 - MBS ATS Truck_

• **2x**	_FOCBOX_ 

• **1x**  _Reciver and transmiter_ (Remote)

•  **4x** _13211 - MBS FiveStar Hub_

•  **5x** _Turnigy Graphene 5000mAh 2S2P 90C Lipo_

•  **2x** _KEDA 63-64 190KV Brushless Outrunner 10S 2000W_

One thing I should mention is I don't have the money to buy everything right now.

Thanks, but shipping might be expensive. Should've said I live in the US.
