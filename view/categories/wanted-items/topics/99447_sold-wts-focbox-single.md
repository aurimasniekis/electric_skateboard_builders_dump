Hey guys Iam going to upgrade to vesc6 so I want to sell 1x Focbox. The Focbox is still a very nice vesc sadly not available anymore. It is of course fully working and comes with a brandnew enclosure and heatsink. Also with stock xt60 and small bullet connectors! 

It will be also checked for suspicious things even its fully working (just to be sure you get a device like brandnew ready to go! )

Payment only via Paypal Friend or EU bank transfer.

Iam able to ship earlyest at Friday from germany :slight_smile:

Since the device comes like a new one price is about 110â‚¬ + shipping.
