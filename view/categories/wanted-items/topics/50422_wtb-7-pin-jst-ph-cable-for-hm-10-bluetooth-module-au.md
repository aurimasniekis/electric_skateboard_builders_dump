Hey guys,

I've got a HM-10 module that I need to connect to my Focbox.

I have tried to use a set of cables from Jaycar but the connectors stick out too much on the Focbox side and are a bit loose.

If anyone has a spare I will pay the earth moneys for it.

LOL, youâ€™re going to love this. Iâ€™ve got a 5,6, or 8 pin. VESC6 doesnâ€™t have a 7 pin connection so I never ordered those.

Anyone know if the above could be made to work?

China eBay options will take 4-5 weeks, but youâ€™ll have heaps spare to give away to fellow forumers who find themselves in a similar situation.

I'm going away with work for a while in mid April and was hoping to get one before then so I can have a working board by then (If everything else rocks up by then).

So China delivery will be a last resort.

@JasperM happy to chuck a 5 pin in the mail tomorrow if youâ€™re willing to give it a go? Not after any cash for this, so youâ€™ve not got much to loose either way. Just PM your address.

6 pin will work too, itâ€™ll just be asymmetrical

That wonâ€™t work if you have ocd

Thanks @lock, the 5 pin JST cable works perfectly and even though the little doo-dads don't lock in itis still very snug.
