Hello everybody.
I would need 2 VESC. I was planning to go with ESC first and then switch but maybe I can find them with your help. I am going to build dual hub set up, on the cheap side. I will probably use them in BLDC mode and not FOC, so I need two working VESC at a good price/condition (second hand too). If you have also all the necessary to connect them together even better (like for the Torque board ones Male to Male Servo Connector - VESC XT90 Parallel Connector - VESC CanBus Connector).

Thanks!

I have esk8.de vesc 4.12. Very reliable in FOC also. I did ~50km with it. Comes with bullet connectors and xt60.
PM me.

With focbox out of stock and god knows when everyone in the market is taking them like hot pancakes, a good reliable vesc that's at a affordable price like u asked for is not going to be in stock any time soon

If you need it immediately, VESC6 from @trampa is probably your best option, if you have the dough for it.

EDIT: just realized you want it cheap. Try Torqueboards vesc if you aren't using FOC

If I do not find a better deal with a second hand ones I will probably go with the Torque VESC. We'll see it

I have seen your website, good that you are in Belgium too. I know maytech and it comes with not the best reputation lately. Altought they probably work fine in BLDC, if you don't stress them in FOC mode. The DualMaytech VESC is a cool solution but I am afraid it won't differ to much from a normal ESC. The specs are a bit low. If you have fully functional second hand VESC please pm a quote.

Thank you Thank you

Faradaymotion Vesc's are awesome. They are working directly with Benjamin V. 
I've  ~500+km on their vesc in FOC mode

I think you can get 20% of the vesc's if you ask for a winter discount coupon. :slight_smile:
