Can anyone make a 12s4p flexible battery like a trampa or nyc but only US ?

I have a torque boards 12s4p battery but want a flexible design

@barajabali @psychotiller maybe any of you ready to make a flex pack?

Both are great battery builders. I'm sure one of them can get you what you need.

may be a bit early to even mention but i've got cells on the way and was going to offer P modules, backed with PCB, cap insulated, fish papered, clear pvc shrinked.  all ready to assemble by builder.

so idea is to ship P groups ready then the builder would just solder series connections as they see fit according to their build.

i won't have cells until well into november.

inb4 someone mentions sharp nickel on positive end, yes i know, they'll be rounded off in future packs, thank u.

some photos to get an idea:

@thisguyhere 
Noice. Was planning to get something like that for tip toeing into battery building. Ill keep an eye out for when you decide to sell a few.

All looks great but shouldnt you solder the nickel to the pcb instead?

```
yes and no.

first, i'm not comfortable with how thin the copper layer is on the pcb.  it should carry the current fine but the bigger issue is because it's so thin, you can very easily pull off the nickel.

during this build, after welding nickel directly onto the pcb, i tugged on the nickel lightly and it just came right off.

so...a nickel to pcb copper weld is weak AF.  a nickel to nickel weld, provided welder is set correctly, is WAY stronger.

and because these P groups are then PVC shrinked, P bus connection is secured down.

i'm going to demonstrate all of this in a future post once i'm ready to offer it up.

I am basically going to do the same thing for my build but minus the PVC clear heatshrink. And probably solder the nickel to pcb

Looks good though

Except here it looks a bit dodgy

good eye.  looks like it's lifting off the pcb a bit.  i think that was the pack where the nickel pulled off the copper.  i've got all the S connections taped off so no danger of a short (fingers crossed).

-- edit

actuall, i pvc shrinked each 6s4p rail again after series connections were made.

Yeah I have spot welder to a PCB before, I had mixed reviews

For me it actually spot welded much easier than nickel to a cell. But yeah its not strong enough imo or it is but it burns a bit of the PCB

for sure.

i'll take a video of nickel weld coming off the pcb in the future post, it's kind of alarming.

yep exactly, and it takes no force at all to pull it off, right?

15ms pulse on malectrics

And on 20ms blows holes in nickel![IMG_20181026_222723_HHT|375x500](upload://21lCr7A2ymPDPbtbQQJ8PNabzMv.jpeg)

i just welded my P connections and pre-tinned the gaps between the cells and soldered braided copper for the S connections, has plenty of flex and doesnt really get warm, like at all

@moon here's a pic of it when i was using cardboard until my fishpaper showed up.

Ok. I am using the malectrics spot welder at the moment and have done most of the p groups.

But I can't get consistent welds, I am guessing it's the tips. What ever it is, it's really really annoying

Ok. I just recharged the battery and upped the pulse time by quite a bit and then sanded tips and now its fine

@sk8l8r what pulse times did you use and what nickel?
