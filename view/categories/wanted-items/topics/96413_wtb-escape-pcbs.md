Looking to purchase any spare PCBs for the ESCape. offering 10$ ea.
Anything ESCape (housings as well) related would be appreciated. (Will trade sex for Gerber files)

Also planning to offer a PCB population service
Will be uploading pictures of example builds in the coming days.

Thanks to @magharees for helping me with this. Hopefully, we can finish what was left behind.
