I currently have 8" (200x50) tires on trampa hubs and need a bit smaller tire for wheelbite. Anyone have a set or know where to source them? Yes, evolve sells them but for a premium.

Huh.

On the website it says from $59 and up for a complete wheel 7" GT AT.  
When you click it, it's now says $75?



A complete kit (4 complete wheels and with belts and pulleys)  is $199...

They look like the exact same wheels and tires.

I agree, it's confusing. And all I want are tires and tubes!
