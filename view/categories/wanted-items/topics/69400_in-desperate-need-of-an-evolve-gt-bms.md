Hey there friends !

My Bamboo GT has been dying in a corner of my flat for months, my BMS almost caught fire while charging and evolve never wanted to send me a new one alone... I had just switched to a custom battery that basically lasted forever and gave me tons of power without any sag (thanks @okp) but I think it was too much for my already glitchy BMS to handle. 

So yeah, **I really need a new BMS, or even a used one that still works**, because even tho I bought an Emotorcycle (Super Soco TC), I miss my board (and the upgraded pack was pretty expensive, still haven't had enough fun with it !) 

If you've heard of anyone selling a dead battery or a functional BMS, you'll be my god :grin:

If you fill out your location in your profile, selling or obtaining things works better

I had the exact same issue, upgraded the battery and BMS died, Evolve won't and me a replacement by bms. 

I'm upgrading the ESCs with VESCs, bms with Bestech and I'll try flipsky antispark switch, soon I'll realize how this board should have been from the begining

After all that you basically just bought a deck, full wings and wheels.

I really like their GCT deck. Sucker for CF even though they are not that comfortable

@leomozoloa @Eboosted What were you charging the new battery with?  Was it the stock Evolve 2A or 4A charger?

wow! thanks for all the replies ! so:

@b264 I just filled them, you're right, I'm from **Paris, France, but anyway i'd pay shipping even if it was coming from the other side of the world.** BTW, I was charging with a regular 2A charger, not the stock one but never had problems before, It was very functionnal and charged to 41.2/41.5V.

@Eboosted Since I have this rad ass 10s4P I was thinking on going full DIY (with the focbox unity for example)**, the only problem,  I have the evolve R2 and it's fantastic**, I just love it and I don't see any DIY remote that come close to that feeling... **If you have any Remote as cool as this one then I'll take it, I haven't checked in a while**

Thanks again guys !

I don't think the Evolve R2 remote has a plug and play receiver, but in case it does so you could just connect it to a vesc and keep the remote

Nah, you know evolve, fully custom proprietary, It might be possible to reprogram the firmware tho, but i'm not even sure they're using the same wireless technology, I wonder if someone managed to do it, have you heard of anyone ? I'll search later rn i'm rushing to work ;)

I feel you pain for the R2. 

I am in proces of making diy, so I have ordered firefly remote, but I really really like the r2 shape, and separated throttle / brake triggers.

That's it, and the battery indicator and all, that gigantic range of motion, smoothness and toughness of the triggers, it's sooooo goood. I checked the photon remote but it has a joystick, I really don't get how no one has made a similar remote yet

I would just get 2 vescs bms and a remote with telemetry and you ll have an awesome board. Evolve has nice boards but their electronics sucks.

I agree, the thing is, as I sad earlier, I haven't found a remote that come close to the R2, if you ever find some let me know! I'll take it !

Do they have a history of selling BMS ? I remember that at first they were okay to send me a bms (Evolve France), but they ended up suspecting It was for a custom battery, and the decision came all the way from the top (the company is australia based) to remove it from every single store so I'd be very surprised if the HQ is okay to give a spare BMS

not sure - if you have a serial number, purchase history  maybe ? They sent me a replacement esc after mine went swimming.

Was it recently ? I know that at first they used to send people electronics replacement parts but they decided to change the policy in the first half of 2018. I actually was stupid enough to say "no" the first time they wanted to send it because mine started working again, two weeks laters it's dead and they won't sell it anymore...

In the case they'd be down to sell you a BGT BMS, could you possibly forward it to me to France ? I'm sure they won't be okay not going through my local distributor, I'll pay for everything !

Arf, Even if I give them all of the info they'll tell me "check xxx at evolve france he'll get you what you need" for sure because they won't send a small bms across the world if my local dealer has some... And about them (Evolve France) already tried everything so I'm kinda hopeless. If you could in any way at least try to ask them I'll be grateful for life haha, frequent evolve bms failure isn't really unusual anyway !

I have one BMS that has missing pin on the balance wire connector. I don't know if it is operational. 

I can send it to you to try it out, and if it works then we will figure out price for it.

I will send it to you later. I am not at him atm. You can also solder wire to the back side of the bms.

There you go.

I got the new one so I have never bothered to try if this one still works.

i do happen to have new male/female connectors, unnattached to the bms. the male connector has all wires already connected as well. its a bitch to remove the female end from the bms.

turns out that instead of jst 2.0mm, they use a unique chinese quick-connector instead.

What's the story of this BMS ? I'm very interested, I see you just soldered the wire to the pin which is smart. 

You say you have the new one, what are you talking about ? The BMS? I thought this one looked like it was the new one, mine has to be prehistoric haha.

If you don't mind sending it to me, I'll pay for everything, DM me for all the info.

I love you all guys :purple_heart:, I don't know why I didn't come here back when that shit initially burned

Story goes like this. 

I was making my custom 18650 pack for my GT. And at one point t my board would not turn on any more. So my first guess was that BMS was gone. While inspecting I have managed to short 2 balance wires for a millisecond but enough to burn that pin. 

So I have ordered a new BMS from a forum member. Got all connected but still the board wouldn't power on. So after rechecking all the wires I found out that the main switch wire got disconnected all the time. 

So I have resoldered it and voila. It works. 

I have never tried to put in old BMS to check if it's still operational. It's most likely that it is. 

That's it.

All hail the great @Eretron, great saviour of our time, I got the bms and my board is fully operational, it's been so long I have nostalgia riding it!

I love this community, peace all :purple_heart:

I'm glad it worked out, the thing I'm not glad is that the @leomozoloa has not been online since then. He asked for my PP address and went silent from that moment. 

I am not worried about the money, I just hope that everything is OK with the guy. Does anyone here know him personally? 

He was mentioning that he is moving to another place, so I hope it's just that...

Cheers
