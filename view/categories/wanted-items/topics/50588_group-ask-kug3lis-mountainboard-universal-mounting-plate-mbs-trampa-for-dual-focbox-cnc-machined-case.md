If enough people want it then maybe Kug3lis will make it available for buying!

Who wants it?


I need one. :star_struck:

I just wanted to mention we going to make several mounting brackets to buy as someone really wants one. 

There are two options:

* Plain aluminum (Would be available to buy in less than a week I guess)
* Black anodized (Would be available in 1-2 weeks only)

Hey Hey being a pain in the ass gives results! :stuck_out_tongue:

I'll take the black anodized one! (no problem I can wait)

As you know I've just bought your 'Dual FocBox Case with Cooling Fins v2' (order #1086)

You can wait when mounting brackets is done to ship. I can send you money with PayPal for the bracket.

Thank you very much! :+1::metal:

I want no make that NEED two anodised for Trampa and one for regular skate baseplate 

Make it happen! (My pay check awaits!)

Ps. if you can accommodate regular skate holes in the same plate then win-win. I would love not to make extra holes on the decks

I know it says focbox but would it be able to house a pair of max6 escs? Also where are you shipping from ? Do ship to the UK?

It's only made for foxboxes, but you would need to make your own holes and probably flatten out stand offs. We ship worldwide ;)

Hi here :wave:

I see this reporting in esk8fr forum.
This move way too much and this shock absorber are not good for esk8/emtb abuse ... (300km and 3 dead).
Just to start thinking about the upgrade :) 

I can't say by myself now, it doesn't fit whitout some DIY. But soon and with SA upgrade I hope. If you guys have other idea... I will use rubber 2 / 3 or 4 mm sheet cutting by hand. Show you soon ;)

Also, Kug3lis did you make the report I give you last months, about the holes issues that don't fit Street carver position? Or make the change for the new bach ?

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/img_20180601_153538.jpg?w=640
Even with the bigger drill I get (10mm) re-drill it doesn't fit right, then you have to send it ...
But I should make it fit finaly soon :blush: I have to finish my riser before.

The new batch which still havent been made yet will have it fixed for carve spring position like I said before :) 

Regarding dampers, maybe your cables pull it too much around?  You are first to report about it, some other emtb who went hard on offroad didn't had problems,  I have broken mine but mine because I pulled so hard was lazy to unscrew to push cables under.

Rubber sheet will not help too much as your screws will transfer vibrations from baseplate.

Thanks for your feedback, yes I see for the screw tips that will not work :rofl: you right ! Need to find an other thing..

For the dampers, yes maybe, like I told you its a feedback from esk8fr. Will transfert your too ;)

@Kug3lis : I killed the Shock Dampeners while unmounting the plate, because of too much Loctite. Is it possible to buy some from you? (maybe 20, something like that)?

We figured out it would be cheaper for you guys to buy own your own from amazon then from us as the shipping would cost more than those absorbers :D

Mine also broke but I found those dampers as well, wondering if something stronger could be used.. some sort of little metal spring with a threaded insert on one end and male m3 on the other

In mine the nut came out of the rubber casing on every one, the marine conditions would not help.

Actually I removed them because they broke.

![IMG_5691|666x500](upload://sil3xq8ks3X1zgZUhThXYQbabo2.jpeg) 

My fault because holes I made in carbon fiber plate were misaligned a little bit.
