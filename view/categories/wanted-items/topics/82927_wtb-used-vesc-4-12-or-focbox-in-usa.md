I am making an electric ripstik and I need a speed controller. I’m trying to make this build relatively cheap so I’ll take any condition of VESC provided it’s fully working. Shipping address is Minneapolis, MN 55414.

I have a hardware 1.6 focbox that I’d part with for trade if you’re interested. Your website has two types of enclosures. Both of which I could find use for. 
If you want to work something out shoot me a pm.
