Hey guys, looking for a mount for my loop key. I need the mount to make a cutout and decide where to put my loopkey. Willing to pay, just turning to the community before paying someone outside. Located in U.S.A, Texas. Iether a spare one laying around, or if someone was willing to print https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2016540. I think this would work.

You can search for this in your local rc store

https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/rn5DcEQ
Or this 

https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/bbZxfMgw

The 3D printed holder would work too and I would print you one, but iâ€˜m unfortunatelly not in the US

Those arent quite right, those allow for parallel mounting, like side by side a surface.. im looking for a panel/perpendicular mount to mount thru the side... if that makes sense

They have multiple different versions.
For different mounting angles.

Can be. 
But even if he from the country side there should be local rc stores around in other cities or as min there should be a rc online shop who can deliver this mounts. If I can find this things in Russia without big russian language knowledge itâ€™s shouldnâ€™t be impossible in the US. ðŸ˜…
