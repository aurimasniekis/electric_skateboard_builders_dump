Looking for a 10s3p li-ion pack that includes a charge-only BMS (preferably 4A+ charge), nothing else needed (will consider other options if the price is right, but I already have a switch and battery level indicator). I need it to all fit into an eBoosted Vanguard v2 10s4p enclosure (approximately 8.5" x 5.5" x 1.5" in the back and tapers to about 2.5" x 4" x 1.5" in the front per my measurements).

I'm located in the New England area in USA.
