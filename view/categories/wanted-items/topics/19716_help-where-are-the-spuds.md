Looking for a Jet spud 29'' Deck! 

They're hard to find since the manufacturer stopped making them. Also re-sellers are running empty :confused:

I'm not sure where to find them, I won't be able to help you there. However, if you want to make your own @lox897 has made templates for any deck.  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/printable-pdf-templates-any-deck/12170

The Jet spud 30" is there I believe.

@unik sells spud style decks
 https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/board/

Or try searching for "Jet Potato 29"
Should be the same deck

They were in stock a month or two ago. Just bad timing. You could try the potato 33 or rocker 34. 
Pretty the same but a bit more leg room.

it's not the same deck. It's 29, shape is similar but I have removed the ultra concave in the middle to have flat area for the batteries.

Well I had one but I broke it, but there is a board that is pretty much identical, I can surely find it for you if you want. But findin a spud will be hard though.

Edit:
Darn it, cannot find the board, do not even remember thhe brand.
But somehting roughly the same size, rather similar construction and most importantly the same (even bigger) wheelbase would be this. https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/70767/drang-dasher-31-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip

@michichopf: Soda Factory? Clutch and Candy Spanks-models. They seem to be really rare though.

I actually found a Candy Spanks on a flea market the other day for 10 bucks.

Would there be any interest in a group buy for these decks? Maybe a Chinese deck manufacturer could produce em

Mayby, but keep in mind that for 100.- upwards you get an excellent board in that size/wheelbase. I myself like to know what I ave under my feets and that i can trust it. Hearing ripping wood in a turn is the scariest thing, no more :)

Well I don't have any experience in deck pressing/making. I'll just ask for a price and then we'll see

this is the same concave as the potato but with a more directional shape.

https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/71833/jet-2016-vulcan-banger-33-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip

and the 33" is just turns the micro tail into a almost full tail. tempted to get this and sell my spud but its pretty used already :joy:

Okay prices are turning out to be very cheap, orders above 100pcs makes it <25$ per deck. Will order a sample soon and test it fully then let's start a GB.

Just as an FYI. I have the jet spud 29 and have tried the Drang Dasher 31...I like the drasher better. It's wider and feels much more stable and comfortable underfoot. Also has a little kick tail which is a plus in my book.

i can do a model, but not a copy :sunglasses:

@ChrisChaput: This thread is better suited.

[quote="rwxr, post:389, topic:23017"]
@ChrisChaput: are you with Jet Skateboards? Then where the hell are all Spud and Potato decks? We need more!
[/quote]


[quote="ChrisChaput, post:397, topic:23017, full:true"]
Yes, Jet Skateboards, Abec 11 Wheels, Biltin Bearings, Attack, Liquid and Fyre Trucks. Our wood shop ran into trouble and got way behind schedule because when they received a huge wood order, NONE of the plies delivered were cross plies. You can't make a deck that doesn't warp without cross. They got their cross recently and are in the process of making your favorite Potatoes, Vulcans, KillShots, etc.

Sorry for the delays ... I hate not having what you want when you need it ;(

So you are saying that there will be more Jet boards soon? Could you organize a group buy or provide some discount for the community perhaps?
There's a high demand for your boards in this scene :slight_smile:
