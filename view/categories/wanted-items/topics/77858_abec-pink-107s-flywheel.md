Some folks sold their car and only use esk8 to grocery shop and go to work.  They can definitely be more than toys :smiley:

And your quality of life goes up 300% just like that when you eliminate "sitting in a car" from your life.  Kind-of like if all of a sudden you didn't have to sleep any more.

Those wheels are 100% unobtainium.  You cannot buy them.

Also, no pulleys fit them.  This can be fixed though.  I can hook you up with some ---> aluminum <---- pulleys for them if you hook me up with a set of them :stuck_out_tongue:

Aluminum Electric Flywheel pulleys are also unobtainium but I will contract a machine shop to make 4 of them...

R1.
Its not stock tho. 
It will have caliber trucks, proper pullys om motors/wheels and 97mm wheels. 
Stock trucks/pullys are trash.
Might even upgrade from 6s to 10s

Unobtainium is the 227th element in the periodic table.  It's never been observed, but it's rumored that it's physically possible to exist.  The Pink Electric Flywheels are made out of it.
