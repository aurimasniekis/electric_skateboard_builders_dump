Winter is upon us and and I am looking for a new ride other than my custom which is running on 80mm Orangatans. Unfortunately I need a build which can deal with my local scenes and the shot-up roads, which is the reason I am heading towards Pneumies. 

IF anyone has been looking to sell a build and haven't found a buyer I'm just bumping this up.

PS I am not buying a brand new trampa complete as my cash flow isn't that positive.

Cheers

If you ask kindly maybe he can give you some discount ðŸ¤”
Thatâ€™s really only quality parts. I would like to have the gear drive and the hanger but he donâ€™t want to part it out ðŸ˜”

I see what your saying but then again sometimes the project of fixing something is just as enjoyable as using it. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
