Hi everyone,

I'm looking to replace the trucks & motor mount of my board, but I can't seem to find a 50mm motor mount that will fit between the back truck & battery/ESC enclosure.

I have Caliber II trucks and roughly 9.5cm-10cm between the center of the truck axle and the enclosure.

Does anyone have a mount for sale that would fit these requirements?
And if not, any idea where I could find one?

Thanks,
Sebastien.

PS: And if I can afford to be picky, I'm in Europe so finding something in the area would be amazing. :slight_smile:

Did you look at @Kug3lis's gear drive?

It's US but @JLabs has a shorter mount (not sure on actual length)  but they are 1/2 price atm.

I have these mounts: https://electricboardsolutions.com/products/caliber-mount-v2-pre-order

Don't know if they will fit, if you want I can measure them? :slight_smile:

Wow, thanks a lot for all the replies! :slight_smile:
Didn't think it would be that easy to find!

@e.board_solutions: That'd be great if you could measure them, thanks!
Could you maybe give me the distance between the center of the truck axle and the edge on the opposite side?
And what would be the min/max center distance with a 50mm motor?

Thanks,
SÃ©bastien.

Thanks for taking the measurement!

But damn... That's around 1cm too long still. :frowning:

Will this 50mm TB mount fit with a 107mm wheel?

@brenternet not sure.. I'd have to check. We have our setups close to the motor pulley so the motor pulley might actually hit.

Thanks. I just contacted them to see if they can give me the dimensions of the mount.

I took a look at his mount, but they seem way larger than the others that were posted here, so I'm not too hopeful. :confused:

I'll look into it again if the other options don't pan out.

@LapinMalin it's not that bad really... this is a short one made by him... he offers 3 different size lengths for different wheel sizes

Thanks for the pic. Seems a bit too long, though. :confused:

Would you mind measuring the length of the mount from the center of the truck axle to be sure? :slight_smile:

Do you have a link to that build? Which size are those Cal trucks, 9" or 10"?

@LapinMalin did you look into @dickyho mounts?  Looks short to me but I'm no expert. Why not try 3D printing a very short one?

I've got @dickyho mounts on the way for another board, I believe they will be way too big but I'll give it a try and let you know.

I've ordered TB reverse mounts just to get the board rolling while I try and figure this out or have one custom made.

I don't have a 9" Cal truck to measure.  IMO I don't think a dual motors (6354s) side-by-side is possible, maybe 5045s by RacerStar.

My truck is a 10", I was asking about the length of the mounts please, from center of truck to end.

Hi @marcmt88 ,

Thanks for your reply, but I'm not sure Brent and I are asking for the same measurement.

Could you let me know what the length (center to the axle to the far end - as shown on the picture) of your shortest mount is?

Thanks!

The BKB mount was next on my list, but I like @marcmt88's design with the idlers a bit more. :slight_smile:

Love @marcmt88 mounts. First esk8 part I bought. I have his longer ones for 107mm abec 11s.
Also have bkb mounts. Very clean looking and really good price right now.

AAhh, misunderstood you.  Measurements from center of axle to the far end of motor arm:

Short - 4 5/8"
Mid - 5"
Long - 5 1/4"

I also have a shorter arm w/o idlers that measures 4".

No problem! I should have added the picture from the very beginning to make it 100% clear. ;)

Thanks for the measurements, unfortunately, this might be a bit tight still. But I'll swap the trucks out tonight and measure the exact gap to the enclosure to double check...
