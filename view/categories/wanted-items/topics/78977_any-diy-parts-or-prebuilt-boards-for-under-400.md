Looking for a board or just these parts. I would like a motor under 200KV with the motor mount and belts and a BMS and VESC with a battery of any kind that would work with a simple external plug.

I was thinking of grinding down my average skateboard trucks and using that. If that didn't work I would definitely go caliber trucks and a cheap motor mount and pulley. I am mainly worried about all of the electronics working together. I am 180lbs and only need a max speed of 20mph. that is why i am looking for a lower KV motor for a larger torque. I just don't want to burn out the motor

Buy cheap,  buy twice. 
Be super careful with cheap mounts. Especially if you're running a budget motor.
If the mount comes loose and that motor hits the ground at any kind of speed you'll probably bust a magnet.

These are best bang for your buck atm

It's a cheaper more reliable substitute For an anti spark on/off switch. 
Not trying to be rude but in all honesty if you don't know what that is you should definitely spend some more time reading before you spend any money.

I actually saw these on ebay when looking for a motor mount lol this is going to be the one i go with. I think i will only need a single 6355 180-190KV motor. Ive read the false economy thread so that is always in the back of my mind

You are definitely right. I just can't seem to find much information on simple on/off switches and charging ports when it comes to the wiring. So my plan was to lay out my proposed build and see what everyone thought and where i would get in trouble. I have been looking into this build for roughly 2 months

I'm tempted but I think I need to follow your instructions and do more research. I thought that the external on/off switch would work as an anti-spark and therefore wouldn't need a loopkey. I just want to not have to open my enclosure for any reason. So external charging/on+off/battery LED gauge.

Everything that I would want to include would be:

180-190KV 6355 motor

8000mah 6s lipo battery and a BMS

VESC

On and off switch

battery LED gauge

charging port 

motor mount and pulleys for the caliber trucks if the modified ones don't pan out

80mm wheels and bearings
```

It will.  But anti sparks can blow. I burned out two on one week. I've heard some last months. Some a few hours. I hear lhb has a real solid one.  But i don't know first hand. 
Loopkeys work and cost less.

If you have heavy hills you'll probably need dual drive

Do you think the loopkey would still work with the on/off switch and the other electronic components? And I was afraid of that possibility but I think it is worth the risk of trying 1 motor first and if it seems to warm up and strain on the hills I would then upgrade to dual.

Do you think a single 8000mah 6s with that 6374 would be sufficient for ~20mph and 10 miles? And after looking into the loopkey, I am definitely going that route. Also, I have seen problems with the LED battery gauge only working with certain batteries. 

Electronically, would this system below work?

Battery>Loopkey>LED>charge port>BMS>Vesc>motor? Unsure of how much the order matters

Im not great with battery stuff just yet. Still learning alot myself. @b264 @Andy87 could probably answer that easily 

I don't have a battery gauge on my board. Just

That‘s right and that’s why you need to look which led display you buy.
There are some different where you can set the battery type, the cell count and what you want to get displayed.
I recommend to get the overall voltage displayed.
Way much more objective.
If you have a bit knowledge of electronics, the DaveGA display could be a good option for you too. 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/davega-battery-monitor-odometer-speedometer/71509?u=andy87

And yes the order of your components matter.
Maybe you can make a small diagram how you plan to wire things up and than we can have a look if it’s right or not.

That is difficult because of the fact that you need a vesc that is built for 2 motors. Plus can you really buy a quality motor for only $40? all the ones that I have seen are $90ish.

2 batteries is cutting it close but, I may be wrong, 16000mah multistar 4s, 2 of those in series should get you what you're looking for. However those lipos are $150-200 a piece. And a lot bigger than the latter.

My only requirements are 20mph and high torque for hills. I don't need very much range

Sorry if you got something wrong @gee  
Just if you link a specific one than people will eventually buy exactly this and end up being not happy in the end.
You right with 5Ah he should already get a good range. I get about 15km with 12s1p and 5Ah packs. This on pneumatics, so if he’s light and use urethane wheels he will probably get even more out of it.
Still would recommend to get a higher c-rated pack. 40-75C is a good rating for our needs.
There are the heavy duty series which offer for example the 5Ah packs in 6s for 60€.
If he has some more money left he can go with the graphens packs from hobbyking which last very long and probably the best choice.

Hobbyking's motor mounts are shit and I wouldn't buy an ESC from them --- but they are a great source for the Turnigy sk3 motors (if you don't want sensors) and the lipos they have some are very good.

I have never heard of them publicly releasing customers' credit card numbers and smearing their customers' names online like DIYE has reports of doing.

Yep, 6374 for single motor.  A single 5065 WILL work if you plan to upgrade in the very near future but it will be underwhelming.  If you're trying to keep it **lightweight**, dual 5065 is what you want though in the end, or single 6374+

If you're going for **cheaper** then you want a single 6374 because it only needs one ESC and pulley and motor mount.

For cheaper, you definitely want single 6374.  A 6355 or 6364 will work.  I'd try to stay on the bigger end.  A 6384 would work too but isn't needed.

Just remember cheaper isn't always better because if it breaks you have to buy it again....

I really think this would be superior to the single 6374, yes it's a larger upfront cost but your breaking is drastically improved, if you're turning you won't have the annoying slip in traction, and god forbid a belt breaks, you can just replace or ride home on a single belt 🤷🤷

I'm not telling you what to do, as the best part of esk8 is the availability to do as you please, but I stand by what I think :)

I use sk3 and they are a demon of a motor.  As for pushing to start well its not really a push as such more a slight movement to let the vesc know which direction you are going.  A simple hip flick is all it takes or indeed as @J0ker3366 said full throttle.  The only time it becomes an issue is starting on a hill but again the slight cogging is not a problem.  Good strong simple motor.

You do NOT want to get the MBoards charger because it's not a 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel plug. (it's a 5.5mm x 2.5mm barrel plug)  The devil is in the details, and this will be compatible with nothing else.  99% of all esk8 barrel plugs are 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel plugs and mixing & matching can cause loose connections, which cause heat and arcing, which can cause fires in certain circumstances

Just them selling this leads me to believe they don't know/care what they are doing and I would be super suspicious of all the things.

It's "safer" in one regard to discharge through the BMS, and "safer" in other regards to bypass the BMS for discharge (specifically as related to esk8 applications using a controller that automatically cuts load on undervoltage and has regenerative braking charging, like any VESC derivative for example).

I wanted to go with the barrel charger because I could likely use my laptop charger to charge the batteries and save on having to buy a charger (small savings) but I think I am going to stick with the simple charge BMS.

Only if you want a fire

Seriously, if you can't buy a charger you could buy a Meepoo.  It may not last long, but it's cheap.

Because it's not specifically designed for your battery.  If you build a "10S" battery, you MUST use a "10S" lithium charger, it's not negotiable.  I've never seen such a laptop charger, typically they are CV instead of CC/CV and usually a much lower voltage and a lot of times they are dual-voltage.

I always like to bring new things to the Forum, especially when they will make a big impact on the important issues we face in this industry. As a supplier and battery builder safety is always a concern. From the products we sell to the community and the work we do building batteries, none is taken lightly.......

We wish to lightly inform you of some UN-believable, but REAL developments that will be in the future of Power storage and safety with personal transportation.
With all 2D batteries, a liquid medium is needed for the transfer of electrons inside the cell. It's this liquid medium that is the hazard (flammable) part. A lithium sulfate solution.

Innovation and forward thinking have found a solution for the current HAZARD that Li-ion and lipo cells have across the board. 
 A battery that has no liquid medium and 35% more capacity, charges 35% faster. double longevity and can be made in any shape at a cost that is well below today's manufacturing cost of cells. While having little to no residual waste or pollution because of the water-based process of manufacturing. This is the future of power storage and will continue on to take over power storage systems everywhere..... electric cars to off-grid power systems 
We have just been informed that something tangible may be available by end of next year for testing. 
O yea, due to the fact that the hazardous part of the battery has been removed REGULATIONS change drastically when it comes to shipping and TSA.

We will keep everyone posted on the development of this REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY.
More public info will be made available in the future. At the moment the developers are working on manufacturing solutions with large (established manufacturers) to speed up production once launched.

As a noob, I was planning on seeing the size of everything, including wires and such, and then building it out of wood, lunch containers or 3D printing it. I really have no clue what the sizes of the parts are just yet and it is all quite complicated as is, without the sizing of each part coming into consideration

I personally would use a BMS, it's better and cheaper in the end than all the overhead of manually balancing, and you can make it a LOT more water resistant and debris resistant with only one tiny hole for charging.

There are pros and cons both ways though.
