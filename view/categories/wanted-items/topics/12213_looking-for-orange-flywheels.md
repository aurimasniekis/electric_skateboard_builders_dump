Hi guys. I'm looking for some orange "Flywheels" in 83mm. With bearings would be great. They should be compatible with the wheel pulley from Enertion, that's why I want "Flywheels". 

Or if you have orange Kegels with a wheel pulley (12mm) I would also be interested. 

My Enertion Powerwheels are too worn out after soooo many miles. Hit me up! :)
