Those just look like abec clones..... is trampa really selling those for $100?

The urethane is better than the old abec clones, but given, the newer chinese urethane is REALLY getting good now... 
Wowgo has been making this orange thane, and I gotta say they're not far off the big 2. There is still an obvious improvement when you try them against blue caguamas, but try them against not-so-well known urethane brands like these? :I
