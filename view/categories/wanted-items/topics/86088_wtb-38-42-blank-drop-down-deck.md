Looking for a new drop down deck 40" plus or minus 2" to replace my Minority (it's delaminating from water damage and I don't know if I trust the quality anymore).  Preferably something with a nice clean profile and symmetrical ends, wondering if anyone has something similar they don't want

These are what I'm looking at currently
