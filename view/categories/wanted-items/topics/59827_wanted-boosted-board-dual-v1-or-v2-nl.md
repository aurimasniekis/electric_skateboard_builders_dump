I recently visites a friend in the US who owns a boosted board and uses it to travel to work. After having a go, I knew I had to get one myself. 

So, if you are living in the Netherlands and have a Boosted board duel for sale, please send me a message or let me know.

Don't get a boosted just build your own since you are in the right place to do so

I have a V1 Dual+ in great shape. I modified it to have an extended range battery so it can do 10 miles on a single charge. It also has connectors to connect extra lipos. I have used this with 2x 5s 5000mah lipos to get 25miles of range total. Would you be interested?

Hi Rdz990, thanks for your offer. I would prefer to start with a board without any modifications, so for now, thanks.
