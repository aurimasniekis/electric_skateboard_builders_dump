This is my first build, and I am using a Loaded Vanguard deck. Unfortunately I don't have the experience for making a kydex enclosure and don't have the money for a 3d printer. I was wondering if someone could 3d print a vesc and battery enclosure for me. PAYMENT CAN BE DISCUSSED. 
Thanks.

I have a vanguard battery and VESC enclosure from eboosted that I will sell for $60 shipped  (US only) it does have some cutouts where the charge, power and display would go through. Comes with the voltage display. ![image|375x500](upload://ukrCy6XiZ4VTMrKzCV3zfuYb2aO.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://gzxolrZ30Yb4DxbXbeMs1ReUa8w.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://tid36bOgA9AfmHneCR4FldUwMPo.jpeg)
