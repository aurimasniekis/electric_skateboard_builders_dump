Hi,
So as the title already says I want to switch my current street setup to a pneumatic one.
That's why I would like to buy the cheap ass pneumatic wheels.. :smile: I don't need the  3d printed pulley... :slight_smile:["cheap ass pneumatic" wheels](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/cheap-ass-6x2-pneumatic-belt-setup-3d-printed-pulley-vex-versa-pulley-files-available/65559) 
If anybody got something just hit me up. 
I live in Austria/EU. :slight_smile:
Thanks for reading.. :joy:

Can I fit those trucks onto a normal deck? I'm going to assume that those risers will compensate for the degree/angel? :smile:

 those risers will compensate for some degree. 

yes, some normal board can fit, some don't.   for example this one below can fit.

this kit I never listed on ebay, because of it weighted very heavy, I was not planning to sell this....,   and I personally don't like the motor mount design too. I always want to make a CNC mount for it, still no time to do that.

My first attempt at a AT board used these the but those motor mounts would flex and cause the belt to slip. I just ordered 2 of your re-enforcing braces for your mounts and covers, overkill for dickyho mounts as they dont flex. But I wanted to protect my motors. My current build of AT is using Modified Caliber II 50 trucks + Dickyho Mounts + Dickyho Cross brace (on it way to Australia), Alibaba 6" x 2" AT Wheels + Nylon Pulley. 2 x Flipsky 6454 Motors, 13S4P Range\Speed Battery 18650 (80 Amp LG Cells) & 12S3P Hill Climb Battery 26650 (150amp Constant)
