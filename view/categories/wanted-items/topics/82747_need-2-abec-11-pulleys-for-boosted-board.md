As the title says, I need 2 abec 11 pulleys that will fit my boosted board. Maybe someone can 3d print them for me? I believe my boosted has a 56tooth pulley.

Boosted uses HTD-3M belts which are not compatible with any popular pulleys which will all be HTD-5M and have 5mm tooth spacing instead of 3mm tooth spacing.

So first you'll have to decide whether to try to find an HTD-3M ABEC11 pulley (I don't know where) or convert your motor pulley over to HTD-5M (recommended)

Or just use Boa Constrictor wheels
