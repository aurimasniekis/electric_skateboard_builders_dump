So my final parts are starting to be ordered or shipped, and I just realized I didn't look for a charger yet ðŸ˜‘ 
I'm going to be using [this](http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-150a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-391.html) charger.

Looking in the used section first since I'm kind of trying to get my build sorted on a budget.

I have this one and also a 12s one for my mountainboard. 
They work very good and are rather cheap. 
Delivery to Belgium took 2 weeks
