Hey Chris

just and FYI since you decided to walk away from the dual 6374 due to weight. this is directly from Jerry's mouth

[quote="LEVer, post:831, topic:36289"]
If you really, really, really need just torque…you shouldn’t do a direct-drive, a geared down system will provide all the torque that you need at half the weight. @psychotiller has a sweet 4WD belt-drive setup with SixShooters and mini 50mm motors. It takes off like a rocket and will not dislodge your arm from your shoulders when you carry it.

IDK weather I should comment here, but I will anyways because i'm fine with waiting a month or two to get them + save up for other required parts. 

I'm also looking for Carvon dd, also don't really  care what drive.
