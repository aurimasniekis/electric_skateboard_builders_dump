Hey everyone. I'm looking for some 218mm Torqueboard trucks that anyone in the EU may have and would be willing to sell them. Whether new or used. Not very fond of ordering them from the US.

I've seen it. It's out of stock. But even though, It's incredibly overpriced. 
Torqueboard sells them 65$ the pair.. = 57€ vs 107.99£ at StreetWing, supposedly at a discounted price from the original 144£?? That's 164€ LOL I prefer getting robbed by a thief, at least he's honest.

They are pricey, but import duty is a bitch.

i dont think you understand the economics of import. you will pay very close to that price by the time you add in all the costs.

here is what i pay on each set of trucks:
purchase price
shipping
import duty
vat
handling charges
forex fees
international wire fees

then i must charge 20% vat for eu customers, pay for the packaging, plus the other costs associated with running a business in one of the most expensive cities in the world which include eveeything from accounting services and insurances to paying the people doing work for me

That might all be true. But the original costs 57€/pair and the same thing at streetwing costs 163€ the pair, three times the original price. That doesn't sound right, even with all the taxes. I did a quick look at their site (streetwing) and most items seem way overpriced..

let me do the math for you, this is what you will pay as a customer ordering direct from the USA:

Pair of trucks plus shipping to UK (as an example)                $105
VAT @ 20%                                                                             $26
Sub-Total:                                                                                $131   / £101.59

Import duty and Handling (approx)                                           £30

Total                                                                                          £131

Then as a business you need to add 20% onto the sale price to pay the govt their VAT, pack the order, use packing materials, pay a tonne of other stuff a customer never sees or thinks about to keep the lights on .

So please tell me why you consider this to be "dishonest and you would rather be robbed :roll_eyes:

including shipping? 

![image|650x500](upload://crCey7UPbsAe4giEa4EEtU1M9Su.png) 

sounds like you were lucky and the package sailed though without getting hit by customs. I find on small packages everything from the USA gets hit. And if you are ordering large quantities of stuff everything gets hit from every country

I didn't mean to be rude @DavidBanner that's on me, sorry for the offensive comment, it was unnecessary. What I meant is that, for such a price difference, 163€ for me it's a no go, at least with the knowledge of how much they cost in the US. 
If you're selling them at that value there is definitely a market for it in the EU.

He is for sure Lithuanian, yet last time I checked he was living in London and was vacationing in Japan. Don't know anything else about him. Haven't even spoken to the guy, yet I admire a lot of heckin' good things he and his dad brought to the community.

Why do you pay vat / import on them? Uk businesses are exempt from quite a lot of that, and you can legally avoid paying them if you reship from ireland.

Not when importing from outside of the EU they are not.  If purchasing from an EU company it is possible to supply a VAT number and be exempt from VAT. When you are importing from outside the EU VAT must be paid on the import along with a load of other fees

the purchase price is not €163 it is € 122.30 including VAT and will continue to be that price once the trucks are back in stock

VAT Registered companies claim tax back as input tax though? You should not pay VAT then proceed to charge customers VAT too.

I'm not sure where you are getting your information from but you can't avoid paying VAT and customs duties by importing through Ireland and It is standard practice to pay VAT on goods and services if you are a VAT registered company and you are required by law to charge VAT to customers.

When paying an invoice from a UK based company or when importing a large order of stuff from outside of the EU the shipping company will demand the charges upfront or very soon after delivery, companies can reclaim the VAT amount later on but they often need to have paid the bill months beforehand plus there is a large overhead in terms of time spent and accountancy costs associated with being VAT registered which further adds to overheads.

Nothing is on perpetual sale, although I have been slack about updating the prices of late, this has now been fixed.
