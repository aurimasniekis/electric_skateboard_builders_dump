Hi! 
I am in the middle of repairing a VESC right now I am waiting for parts they will arrive in like three days. I will be able to sell you that VESC with all the tests you want me to do on video as a proof that it works (I dont trust people on the internet so I want to avoid these trust issues with evidence/proof). It is an Enertion VESC 4.12.
Cheers, Martin.

That setup should work perfectly fine as far as motor and VESC combination. 
http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":0,"batt-cells":10,"motor-kv":190,"system-efficiency":85,"motor-pulley-teeth":15,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":90}| 
here is a calculator, just put in your valuesand it will calculate the rest :) 
I would sell it for 80€ plus shipping (around 5€) I am from europe BTW. I can ship worldwide though.

As a outsider there isn't need to refund. Most of those fails are user based because people rush their builds and don't focus enough how to make it reliable.

Tuomalar is basically saying if it fails after you get it than it would be because you messed it up and not because it was repaired incorrectly. If I bought something from you and then broke it would you give me a refund?

I agree with you completely but unless you could prove to Martinsp that it was his fault, I don't think it's fair to ask for a refund

If it works before it ships then it would have to be user error in my opinion. Also the vesc is a wonderful component but it can be faulty too know this going into your purchase

## \#22 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2017-07-27T08:35:38.674Z Reads: 123

remember the vesc 4.12 is still a beta product guys.
If you are not prepared to have one fail, don´t use it!
If you like to be safer that nothing fails, buy a more expensive, upgraded one from one of our lovely vendors here.

As said before, if it is not a fail like you shorted the phase wires and blew the FETs or something that would be because of your settings or setup then yes I would refund you or repair the VESC.
I dont have any DIY VESCs because enertion is one of the best VESC manufacturer and they have very small amount that failed because of things like using cheaper parts or lower quality technology. People were running FOC on 10S (I am too) on them and they had no error (unless they set it up badly). FOC on high voltage seems to be like a challenge/test for the VESC.

But no foc and you are saying it will most likely not fail. Also my budget will go over if I spend that much on a vesc. Would you let it go for 60 euros and 5 euros shipping because then I will for sure buy it.
I'm just a first timer and I'm trying to be careful with what i buy.

If you can buy vescs in Europe shipped for €65 then I'll take 50. 
Any vesc in Europe is difficult to find unless you go down the maytech route. 
Even then you will pay a lot more than this. If someone is offering a vesc for 70 euros working then take it. Warrantied up until you have detected your motor and that's it. Even then that would be generous.

You misunderstand me. If I could find vescs for €65 euros including shipping then I would buy 50 of them!
You are being offered a very good deal on the repaired vesc. (assuming it is repaired)
```

---
## \#33 Posted by: dg798 Posted at: 2017-07-27T20:27:59.667Z Reads: 86

Then as I said before I will take it for 65 + 5 for shipping.

I assure you it will be repaired. I have always repaired my VESCs and VESCs that my friends use and I have not had a VESC I could not repair (assuming it was not burnt to hell and back broken in half and ridiculous things like that).  I studied electronics engineering and have been in this field for almost 6 years now. That is just to add some confidence in you. 
I am not fighting to sell it to you because it is cheap and I know it but to be honest I bought it broken for just dirt cheap so I am not all that sad to let it go for 70 :D 
Hope I did not jinx this and will be able to repair it :D I will inform you as soon as I have answers. :)

I am located in Slovakia, central Europe.

I am currently building a website www.electricskateboard.repair, it will be up soon! I am also planning on buying out broken VESCs of al kinds (focbox...) and doing something like Apple does with refurbished devices. :) I will make a separate topic once I am ready with everything. The parts that I was talking about are like 100 DRVs and stuff like that in bulk. :slight_smile:

Please stop rushing him. Other people have a life of their own. I understand that you really want a vesc, but seriously: you posted twice in one day asking "did you finish the vesc yet?" and "did you repair the vesc yet?". It gives off the impression of rudeness.

Enertion best vesc manufacturer?!  Maybe based on ur experience only. But then yours broke too.  I've heard of mannnny enertion vescs braking as well as diy's on this forum.  Read around and you'll find u can get a decent reliable vesc w a warranty for little more money

Well yeah enertion VESCs break, so do others. But the reason is most often user error. Also there were the max curent ramp stap that killed a bunch of VESCs (not manufacturer fault). You say a lot of VESCs that were made by enertion fail but you have to look at the amount that they sold.. VESCs alone also raptors and very little VESCs failed in raptors. The reason is that the settings were correct. So I disagre with you on this. And the VESC failed because of my faulty motor that shorted the phases with stator.
