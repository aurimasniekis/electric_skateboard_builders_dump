Which App do you want to use it for ? Some App are open to all BT modules and some aren't.

"VESC Monitor" is open to all BT
".metr" is only working with BT modules sold by the creator of the App
But I don't know if a BT module sold for .metr will work with "VESC Monitor"

Those are just two examples of App I know, make your own research to choose an App then decide which BT module you need.

What??? That is a BMS not a Bluetooth module, and I don’t see any wiring diagrams. 

Maybe I just don’t understand, but can you explain more?
