besttech and supower are routinely recommended by people.

do note that besttech requires a minimum order of two but you may be able to email them and get them to sell you a single one.

I didn't have much luck organizing a local (Vancouver, Canada) group buy.....so, I'm also interested in the following model:

HCX-D223V1 (S8261-G3P)
10S Li-ion PCM
Charging Current 20A
Discharging Current 80A
with E-Switch
Over Current Detection 150A+/-20A
```
