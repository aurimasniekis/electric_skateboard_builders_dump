I have 2 sets. But they ain't $99 now baby.  I will send you a set for what they would  $160 shipping included and long axles.

They are that reddish color and say SENDER SKATES on them.

Don't need to sell them.  They will get used for something around here, but if you are desperate.  Here is a solution.

Haha, just a while back I'd asked you what colors you'd used on the white LaCroix because I wanted to do something similar. 

If Psychotillers new trucks end up being something that aren't going to work with me, I'll most likely take the rods. Should know in a couple of days

@Sender would you sell me a set? I actually [created a thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wtb-surfrodz-200mm-rkp-50-degress-w-80mm-axels/92923) about it 18 days ago, it's the only part of my build missing at this point.

Sorry about that, must have missed it. Or read it drunk and didn't respond.  My bad.  I will look through my PMs.

LMK. @gmurad if he doesn't take them, they are yours.  I have 2 sets, but want to keep one for a rainy day.
