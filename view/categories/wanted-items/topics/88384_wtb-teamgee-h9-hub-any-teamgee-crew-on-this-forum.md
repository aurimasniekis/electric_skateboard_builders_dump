Hi guys,

One of my H9 hub is broken and i'll try to buy one via teamgee but the H9 hub is not on sale on their website and nobody from teamgee answer my messages.
I send them dozens of messages via mail, instagram, facebook  from more than one month and no one was answered. So if somebody want to sell one H9 hub, i'm on the market. By the way, if i can't find an original one, i will go by the DIY route  trying to adapt some meepo hubs...

Itâ€™s near impossible to get one off here, I havenâ€™t heard 1 person on this forum ever talk about teamgee. I personally have had a teamgee and I believe the meepo hubs will work
