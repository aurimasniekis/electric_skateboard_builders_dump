@mmaner made fun of me and now I'm insecure about my pink trucks. 

Was thinking of turning this:

to this:

I only need black hangers but I know that's like buying a single sock. But hey, if anyone had bought two sets of trucks to get different angles then maybe Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.

An alternative is spray painting it but I'm no expert at painting so I need some advice on how to get strong adheision

Apparently you can buy just a single Caliber truck from MuirSkate or two Calibers of different angles. :slight_smile:

I would know, cos I bought one 45 and one 50 from them.:rofl:

I'll make an admission. One time my parents surprised me with an awesome purple(ish) bike for my birthday( my dad is actually colorblind) and i was afraid of being ridiculed and returned it for a blue bike. I'm not proud of that and nowadays I'd rock a rainbow deck with pink unicorns all over it. Haha how we age and realize nobody gives a fuck

@ATLesk8 very inspirational story, I feel like I've come to embrace the pink. @scepterr I might just stay with the pink and save the money up for a tsg pass.

I've spray painted my trucks black. It's pretty easy. Wipe down with isopropyl alcohol and then hang them on strings and use sweeping motion back and forth to paint them. It's pretty hard to mess up tbh.

I have the technique for spray painting down, just not educated enough on how to use the hundreds of different kinds of primers and such to get a durable finish

on the base plate (boardside if topmount) you will see 44 CAL if they are 44. hangars dont matter.

Just go down to the local car auto shop get them to sand blast them, should be either cheap or free since its a 1 min job (I work at a auto shop so i know) And go down and buy so you can etch them with acids that will make them black, should only cost you a total of 5 or max 10 bucks to do and you have lots of acid / etching stuff to do 50 or so trucks.

How ive done mine, i just didnt use acid at the end but clear lacker some special stuff used for the underside of a car dosnt add any thickness but has a cemical reaction with the metal that makes it not stain or rust or anything.

If you want to strip paint, it is hard to beat AS10 Aircraft Stripper, it's not enviornmentally friendly, it's the old paint stripper of yore which hurts your skin if you're careless enough, it really saves on elbow grease.

Rattlecan paint, use a metal primer coat, follwed by two coats of whatever colour you like, if you get a 2k rattlecan paint. Use a urathane finishing coat or to protect, it's what they use on plastic hubcaps on cars.

Pink to make the boys wink :rofl::wink:

I almost bought those too, shame to destroy them, melon/pink...nice combo and very daring sir

Amazon is always a nice place to get calibers for some reason they are cheaper then anywhere else.
