Looking for a Mini Remote. Can be new or used, just has to work ;) As far as I'm aware @psychotiller's [2.4Ghz remote](https://psychotiller.com/product/24ghz-remote-controller) is a Mini Remote, but if I have no clue what I'm talking about please correct me. I'd buy one of those ($78 AUD shipped according to the site) but I want to see what my options are first :)

I'd prefer not to buy from China as the shipping times are ridiculous.

Ready... set... go!

As soon as you said $17 on eBay I knew what you'd be suggesting :P Nah I hate buying things from China.

Oh hey you're right, I actually didn't expect that to be available in Aus for some reason. I also didn't really know what to search. I'll buy that and report back on whether or not it works. Thanks :D

That first remote you posted is the epic boards remote. It‚Äôs actually kinda comfortable but the throttle/brake is backwards to normal
