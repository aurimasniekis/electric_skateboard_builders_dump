Hey all, 

Decided to build my wife her first board as a birthday present next month. Ive got all but a motor and a couple of lipo batteries. Anyone selling anything that they are willing to let go cheap? Based in the UK.

Thanks

I know 6s is not the standard around here but I have a used multistar 6s 10ah 10c lipo. It has had a max of 30 cycles. Based in EU.

This is what the badboy looks like, just not as fresh.
