If your place is that messy. The remote is not the problem hahaha. 

It's extra. Decided not to use it after redoing my raptor 1. I'll trade you for a pack of zealous bearings. Or TWO packs of reds

No. Myproblem is my wife who constantly buys things without having room or my son who treats my things as his toys. Not to mention my 89 year old grandpa who lives with us. He puts things away and forgets where he placed them but i digress i will gladly make that trade. I can meet up tomorrow if u have time
