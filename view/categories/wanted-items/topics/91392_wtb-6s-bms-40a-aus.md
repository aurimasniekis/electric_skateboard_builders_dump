Yo as the title says, i need a 6s bms and pronto.
No it isn't for an esk8. No im not stooping to the level of 6s ðŸ˜‰

In all seriousness, if anyone in Australia has a 6s bms i could buy off them it would be awesome. I dont mind what brand, it just needs to be in Sydney as soon as i can get it.

Pls show me what you all have. 

Cheers
