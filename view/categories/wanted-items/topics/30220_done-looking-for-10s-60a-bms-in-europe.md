Don't need it anymore 

Burned mine by stupidity, need new one, too lazy to wait long ass shipping from BatterrySupports. 

AlienPowerSystems don't have them in stock. 

More specifically I'm in Dennark, but shipping from Anywhere in Europe will be faster than china.

Stupidity. 

I tested balance wire voltages in a wrong way, resulting in balance wire order being reversed
