I´d buy from [esk8.de](http://esk8.de). They have the common used wheels and a friendly and nice support.
Other places are ebay or amazon.

They say that it is free shipping:
But when you add it to the cart and want to pay, at the last page they tell you that it is 65$ shipping.
And if you add 2 then it becomed 130$.
Maybe a group buy would be perfect. I would take 3.

I got these from Ebay, came to about £34 incl shipping (no extra charges from customs due to it being in the Global Shipping Programme):

I only ordered them last week, they are on their way (they tracking info is provided which is also super good of them).

I'll let you know once I've had a go on them. I'm used to much smaller wheels as my current ride is a small 22" Penny board.

I'm not sure about any 90mm, maybe worth looking further on ebay? I've looked in the .com, .co.uk and .de for mine, and often the parts come from China anyway if that's any help?

Whatever ya'll try be sure to check the spoke size. The black owlsome ones have thicker spokes which won't fit the Enertion pulley or similar style pulleys unless you file down the spokes.

I went for Stickies wheels in the uk in the end and they were uk based with cheap shipping.

I received them and they seem to be quite good from what I can tell. They are softer then what I am used to but not too bad I think (perhaps that's better for longboards when traveling over pavements and slightly cracky roads?)

I haven't been out on it yet as I'm still waiting for a couple of parts for my build. 

But for that price I guess they are quite good?

:smiley:

This clones are quite good. I have the 97mm version and really like the softness of the wheel perfect for eBoard, good grip and smooth ride :-)

I received the wheels mentioned earlier by me, and holy crap do they skate. riding on a brick road almost feels like asphalt. they're great quality,bearings popped right in, dimensions of bearing seat are correct. i definetely recommend them

ATTENTION!

the wheels from china i mentioned are NOT compatible with 3d printed or any other abec11 specific wheel pulleys. the tabs that connect the bearing part with the rest are thicker than with original abec11's.
Now of course you can drill the hole wider or do it with a dremel, but just a heads up for the ones looking for stuff that doesnt need tweaking.
