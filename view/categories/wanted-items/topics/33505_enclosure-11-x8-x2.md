Hey guys, im looking for an ABS enclosure on that size (11x8x2). Can anyone hook me up? I'd rather not have to rebuild my vacuum table just for this.

@psychotiller @longhairedboy ?

Gonna have to be long-haired boy. 2" tall enclosures are goofy looking and problematic to make.

can confirm, i have a 2" tall enclosure now but it looks weird.

i needed it though because didn't know how else to fit a 2-cell high 12s4p pack.

Doesn't look too weird on my board. I've got 100mm wheels too, so clearance is not an issue. But i agree, is a bit taller than normal.

Hahah! Those look realy nice! I like how the steep front/back angle makes it look "slim"

Unfortunately they're shaped to conform to my decks specifically, so @psychotiller's right, they would be goofy looking on a regular concave. 

and sorry about the mom stuff dave. PSYCHE. Your mom.

i really need to get into that game. i've had a few failed attempts, mostly due to my size and space requirements vs what's available.

Problem is, you need to have some sidewall angle to get a vacuum formed shape to release. If you want a 2" tall enclosure it'll have to be too narrow at the top of the mold to be wide enough for components, Or the alternative, too wide at the flange or base of the enclosure to fit on any deck. 8" wide x 2" tall are really goofy dimensions.

What about something like this?
From memory the  outside of the enclosure without the flange is something like 320mm, 150mm and 50-55mm tall. 
Uk based though.
