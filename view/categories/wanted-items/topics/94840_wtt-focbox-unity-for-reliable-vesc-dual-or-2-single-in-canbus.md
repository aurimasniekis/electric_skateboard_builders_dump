found out it isnt so reliable on 12s

 looking for one which is reliable for 12s and good quality maybe flipsky 6.6 or any other high quality one

if unity firmware update comes out to fix this issue then please say as i am scared of using it until this has been sorted

looking to trade pm me with offers

unity should come in a couple of weeks

Deodand has already completed the update that aims to fix the issues people are having. It's currently being tested by others who have the Unity

By the time it gets to you it's likely going to be fine to ride, but I can't blame you. 

If you want to buy some VESC 6s together from Trampa, let me know and I can buy a 4 pack so we can save some money in the end(low end bulk pricing)

I've been running 12s on unity since December and haven't had any issues... I log tons of miles weekly and ride fairly aggressive and high speed...

Might try it just want to get my board going as soon as I get the unity so just would prefer being on safe side

As I said in the first bit if the update is working by the time I get it then will just keep

We each save 20 pound(?), Sort of worth it 😂😂

I've got two 6.6 singles still in the packaging, we can make the worst trade of your life if you like.

No one can say.  The six point six showed pretty good with the testing and reviews.   Two functioning escs in hand are worth more than two that might show in months.  Or maybe worth more than four.                                                 Real dollars worth more than future dollars.

There is no perfect esc. The closest you will come is a proper vesc 6 from Ben's own hands. 

A unity can fail. A flipsky can definitely fail. Everything can fail. We're riding tiny bombs, if you want 100% certainty that you have the best product you need to drop the cash on trampas website and not look back. Everything else is a compromise.

There’s reviews here and you should search to get ahold of them then you will know more then us probably.  I normally don’t say do a search but people have made threads on these escs and the info is compiled there and surely more informative than this thread

DOnt have funds to go trampa so maybe if they are all going to fail at one point just go unity and hit and hope??🤔🤨

I typically do search things out as much as I can. This isn't really going to be one of them. I've only really read great things about the Unity, except for the very few mis-pairings or something with the Hoyt Puck, which was swiftly explained/fixed.

If there's a small concise list of problems with the Unity that don't have explanations as to why, I'd love to have it spoon fed to me in this very instance.

When any new product comes to market there are teething problems.  What you have with the focbox is a product that has had those tested out over time and fixed.  That said the unity has a very good back up in the shape of @Deodand who is working tirelessly behind the scenes to iron out these issues.  Some real and some not I would imagine.  Use the unity or trade it for foocboxes.  Its really just up to you to make that decision but used focboxes have zero back up while the unity has a warranty if you follow the instructions for modifications.  Now go off and make the decision.
