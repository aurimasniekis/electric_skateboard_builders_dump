Hello, i have no-name axle with square profile and I am looking for an affordable motor mount. It needs to hold this monster: Turnigy SK8 6374-192KV

If you have any idea or offer where i can get it, please let me know

As you can see the hobbyKing motor mount didn't do the job well for my axle. After 2 weeks of driving it went completely loose and I can not get it to hold tight permanently.

Get these and be happy/safe its not worth risking a sudden stop on a loose mount.

I agree, get a set of calibers, and boardnamics mounts if you want to go the distance. Alternatively, you might be able to file down the parting surface (surface perpendicular to the bolt hole) of the mount to get it to clamp down again.

Thank you guys so much. Unfortunately they are out of stock but I will check every day!

I already put in some effort to get my hobbyking mount working again. But now I want to drive again and not mess with this cheap part. I think it was just 10$ or so, but still not worth the price

I love to see that kind of stuff of skateboard, Can I use the same for the HyperOutdoor board, its little too old but go with flow always, Also I would like to know the cost for the same to making these changes on HyperOutdoor skateboard and always wonder if it works smoothly on the rollercoster and wish that my HyperOutdoor board never get broken.

I restocked them. For some reason the site was bugged. Thanks for bringing that to my attention :)
