Just a forewarning...

The second batch of Unities JUST shipped out. The third batch is being sold now and is slated for delivery "after may". If you want one right now, it will be a steep price to pay to skip the wait and get one from someone. Good luck!

This is true but there are always people who bought a few extras and will sell them.

No doubt, I've kept my eye out for them as well hehe. 

But the price I've seen them sold for.. :man_shrugging:

Just trying to prepare the dude to not expect current sale price.
