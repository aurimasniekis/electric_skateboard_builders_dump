Hi guys,

I am wondering if anyone is able to provide a service by 3d printing [this item](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2965134/comments) for my GTX - it's a simple spacer that i would like to use. Would anyone with a 3d printer be willing to make it, for a price of course?

Yeah that's the easiest way, 3dhubs, would likely cost very little.

In the US; I may have a contact on the East Coast who can help make it, but I would like to keep my options open

@karma I appreciate it, but I am in the US - shipping may be an issue

For sure - my friend ordered one from someone and said I can check it out once he gets it, so I will hit you up when that happens. Do you know what material is best suited for this?
