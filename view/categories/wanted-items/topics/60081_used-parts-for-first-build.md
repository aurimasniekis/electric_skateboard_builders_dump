So I finally got a decent amount of money saved up to start ordering parts for my first build.
I had planned on ordering things in about 3 weeks but figured since there's so many people on here with multiple builds someone's likely to have extra stuff laying around and possibly need money for their current build.
Things I'm looking for. 

6374 motors 190kv (ish) x2
TB 218mm hangers
Or Evolve trucks maybe? 
Remote control & receiver
Focbox x2
Deck ( I'm not dead set on any deck just yet but I want something that's going to handle higher speeds and fit my 107 abec11 superflys.) 
I have a stack of decks but they're all 31in and under and I think I'm going to want something slightly bigger for the duel 6374.
 I'm located in the Pacific Northwest and would rather not pay for international shipping.
Thanks for looking

I 2nd this... for 110$ shipped, u can get a deck made for e-skate from hummie. the enclosure i think is another £45 but i mean for $160 for a custom wood/carbon deck with battery cutout and enclosure NEW is a pretty good deal IMO

as for the 218's i have a set i might be willing to part with in the near future, i just got some surfrodz so yea

I have seen that deck and I liked it quite a bit my only problem is I'd like to start by build asap.
Looking for something I can fit 10s6 or 12S5 (haven't made up my mind between range and top speed just yet)
I ride my current board as my daily commuter (riptide r1) both its range and Speed leave me wanting much much more.

That is a gorgeous deck.
I'll probably be ordering the parts new in 3 to 4 weeks if I don't get any bites on used stuff.
Dry season is short here and I'd like to get this thing built before the rain comes.

My long-term goal would eventually turn this deck into an all-weather build. Something I can swap on tires in the rainy season and go back to urethane for the dry.
It's too much of a pain for me to drive to work even walking is easier. So I commute around on a skateboard or a bike 367.

I'll hit him up if a deal on something used doesn't pop up here. there's also a guy with a landyacht Evo and switch on the Facebook Marketplace locally to me that I kinda want.

@Skunk... @marcmt88 is the guy you want to talk to then, his kits are priced really well, and i believe he sells tires/rims

After many trials and errors, designing pulley/belt cover, experimenting and testing Acetal Delrin for wheel pulleys, locating reliable suppliers for belts and steel motor pulleys I finally am able to bring together a complete drive system for your trucks and motors.
Kit is $110 + $14 US shipping, $32 International shipping, includes the following:

* C-clamp x 1
* Universal motor arm x 1
* Dual idlers with 4 bearings
* Acetal Delrin pulley/belt cover
* Steel motor pulley 8mm bore x 1, choice of 14, 15, or 16t
* 13 or 16mm wide POM drive pulleys x 1 (30 – 42t) other sizes are available to fit ABEC, Kegel, MBS, or Abec clones)
* 12 or 15mm wide HTD5m belts x 1
* All stainless mounting hardware

Oh I've definitely seen this kit that's why mounts are one of the things I did not list for used items as I'm already positive that's what I'm buying.
The second I saw those tensioners I knew where I was spending my money.

I live in a college town and there's at minimum 20 used longboards for sale on the marketplace at a time and they're usually under $100 & barely ridden, especially since this town doesn't actually have any real Hills to bomb. mainly just kids on campus. It's a lot of cheap boards or overly flexi boards though not a lot of stuff I see working great for esk8.

I actually just picked up a used Canadian maple downhill deck. It had caliber 44° on it and a set of 97mm abec 11s. Paid $25 lol.
Decks not too bad and I'll probably actually use it for a downhill build but I don't think it's what I want for my e build especially cuz I'm going to have to use almost 2 inch risers to fit the 107 under it.

I guess I'm just kind of set on using my 107 superflys seeing that I already have the 97 on my Riptide R1.
I dug up long enough Hardware and enough risers to get them to fit under the board and it just feels a little silly. I guess the clearance would be nice for the enclosure but it doesn't feel like something that I want to ride as fast as I want to go.
I'll probably just use it as an actual Flintstone board & venture out to the hills just outside of town
