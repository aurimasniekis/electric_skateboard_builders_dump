Anyone got some boosted v1 motors willing to sell? I've found myself with a working v1 esc to play with...

Normal motors will not work?
I mean just different brand.

The sensors have to be plugged in for the esc to work.... so unless boosted rebrands motors and i can find them no, the esc is preset for a motor,30a per motor and 5 sensor pins

As far as I know they use an as5133 encoder. 
So if you find out which motor size and kV they use you could get it work by just buy this encoder and add it to the motor

I didnâ€™t measure the motors on my old v1

Boosted actually sells parts from what i've heard. and i found a v1 (damaged battery) for 250$ in nyc, still waiting on the guy to get back to me

boosted would probably service that board that i'm gonna buy.

unfortunately the motors covers are not incompatible, boosted v1 uses metal covers with sensors in them while v2 has sensors integrated into the motor (hence the plastic cover)

and whats wrong with your v1

Battery
Deck
Esc Case

But whats wrong with your v1?

Alan if you need V1 parts let me know. I have some i would like to dispose of.
List of what i have: 
2 motors(pulleys included) with sensor covers still attached to boosted vesc
V1 battery - opened up to charge bad cells and try to revive but failed. (bms still there in case you want to rebuild the pack)
all wheels, 2 with pulleys
Remote

trucks were salvaged along with the deck to make a standard kick longboard. 

let me know. We can work on a fair price for the components
