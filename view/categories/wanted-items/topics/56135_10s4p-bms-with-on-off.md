Do you want good or cheap?

If you want good, get a Bestech D190 and a switch from @Kug3lis

@JLabs has the besttech BMS with the e-switch

You'll have to buy a switch but you can get those cheap on amazon or something like that.

I have been looking at similar BMS solutions and i'm wondering how they will perform while riding? This one looks like it will handle the load just fine but, what will they do on over charge/discharge? 

Mainly over charge, since i live on a hill i usually start off needing the brake before any power has been used, not very fun if it just cuts out. Even if it turns back on, with a nano x remote you'll have to restart the remote to get it working!

Same for the LVC, i'd prefer a dead battery over a dead me. I guess that you could set your vesc to throttle down before there should be any risk of the bms tripping, but there still feels like it could be better. Or atleast some more info about it!
