Much like this one:

Atom and Paradox uses the same boxes and I'm guessing the same parts. Figure they're so old the should be pretty cheap. I sold my paradox 28" 600w and no I miss it. But I want to build it with a new deck and figured maybe I could get a better deal on alibaba or something just buying the parts and the case. But every DIY kit I find doesn't include the battery or BMS system for it. 

To keep it cheap I don't mind it being a 1 wheel drive or having a small battery. Just figure this is common enough that it should be easy to find the same kit.
