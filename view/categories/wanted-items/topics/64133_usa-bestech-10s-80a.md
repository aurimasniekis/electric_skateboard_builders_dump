Hey guys! Like the title says, I'm looking for a BesTech 10s 80A here in America, (East Coast). If nobody has it on hand I'm willing to do a group order of no more than 4 people, if that does not violate the rules. Please let me know! Thanks guys

Ive got one but Im not sure if I can get rid of it yet, if you can wait a week or so you can have it at cost if I dont use it.

this is their site they directed me to for small orders... doesnt seem like you need to do group buys anymore to get just a single....
