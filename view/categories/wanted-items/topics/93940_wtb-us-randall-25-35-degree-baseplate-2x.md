I got this monstrosity in the works and she can't turn for shit, '70' degree trucks don't turn under 70kg of rider...looking for a pair of Paris II compatable baseplates with a 30ish degree angle, best I found was the Randell 35 degree but it's still $40 for a set.
Thanks!

Don't low degree trucks turn less then high degree trucks?

Yes but I don't have leverage at 70 degrees, I can turn the trucks by hand a lot but leaning only turns it half as much before I fall off
