I buy all my stuff from https://www.electrokit.com/en/
What do you need exactly? I have all things needed to make a cable with a 6 pin connector in one end so I can make a cable for you. (located in sweden and shipping within eu is like 2-3eur)

Are you within Europe ? I have a spare 6pin JST lying around. You'd just need to change the pins and solder it onto your hall sensor cable from the motor.
