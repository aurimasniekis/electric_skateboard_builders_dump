IsTalo, thanks for the offer. But i decided to use one that is not specfically made for longboarding. The price in comparison with a normal ESC suited for the task is almost double. (want to have a budgetboard)

Sure, not always what the other people says is true. You can build a traditional board with Sk3 and Vesc and this things or you can build your own Frankstein, Good luck with your project
