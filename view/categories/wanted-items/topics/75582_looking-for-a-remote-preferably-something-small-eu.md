Title says it all pretty much

[This is the one I'm looking at now.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/XCSOURCE-Transmitter-Controller-Skateboard-OS917/dp/B073GX83NH/ref=pd_sim_200_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B073GX83NH&pd_rd_r=ec9b22bf-dfb3-11e8-b9c1-a789dd2b15b9&pd_rd_w=mgAdZ&pd_rd_wg=6QX87&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_p=1e3b4162-429b-4ea8-80b8-75d978d3d89e&pf_rd_r=P7NBY1DTWG6K0PK51043&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=P7NBY1DTWG6K0PK51043) But I'd rather go with something smaller.

Edit: bought one already

You go with that and you won't be disappointed. You can also mod it to a different case.

Nice that looks pretty cool. I notice this remote has 2 dials on it, what can I do with those dials do you know? I'm guessing throttle adjustment and something else?

As of now they are trims for steering and throttle. I personally hate them. I have seen people remove them but not sure how. Once the right (throttle) trim is set, usually @ dead ass center, you shouldn't need to touch it again. One of the reasons I like the avio is it hides those trims and I do t have to worry about hitting them and moving them or breaking them off.

Yeah that remote imo is the best on the market especially for a reliable signal, If you remove the steering wheel on the side too that will make it smaller aswell, or as others have mentioned you could just 3d print a smaller case.
