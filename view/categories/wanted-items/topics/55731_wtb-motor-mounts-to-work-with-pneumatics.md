I'm getting a set of printed 6" pneumatics and I'm not sure that my enertion style motor mounts will be long enough so I'm open to suggestions. What is everyone on the forum going with recently? I'd like to get them fairly quickly (next week or two). Thanks for the heads up. Also have a ton of stuff to trade. Open to all offers.

Posting a pic of the hubs and your location might help.

I am using my Street Wing mounts in my current 6 inch pneumatic build, very pleased with the results.

60T pulley and 6x2 pneumatics:

That mount gives me anxiety... I'm sure it works but in my head I see it sliding and moving (I'm sure it doesn't tho)

The former user used torqueboards v3 mounts and had sufficient space.

Don't go evolve wheels.. the 64t pulley is huge.. and I dlers won't work I don't think. I had to shave the trucks as well..
