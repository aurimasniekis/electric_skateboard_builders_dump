I am looking to buy two sensored 6354/6355 motors like Torqueboard's TB 6355 190kv or the Flipsky 6354 190kv. They can be new or used as long as they are functioning properly and in a good condition. I am located in Australia so shipping from other countries might kill the deal but if you have anything hmu. I am just looking for cheaper motors in the second hand market before buying new. Cheers.

Yeh I wanted to use them but found that they're longer than normal and won't fit when doing dual on caliber trucks
