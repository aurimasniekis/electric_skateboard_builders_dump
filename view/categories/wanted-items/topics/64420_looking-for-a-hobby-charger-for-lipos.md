What specs you need. 
Number of cells? AC or DC power input? Location?

Just got the old iMax B6 from amazon. About 30€, not the fastest but I bought two, still cheaper than for example the hobbyking charger.

I know you bought the B6 but coming from an RC background , these are currently the best chargers available right now hands down.

They will even show the internal resistance of each cell, and be able to charge above 1C for a little faster charge time.

Am I right for this once you link we would need a separate power supply too?

Yes that’s correct, I run a similar one to this. Although isdt make a AC charger that doesn’t require a supply and has dual battery output.
