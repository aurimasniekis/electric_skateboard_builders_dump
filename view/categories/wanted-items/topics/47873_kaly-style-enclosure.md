Most people that look for a decent or cheap price ftp for the DIY thing. It's not hard and most parts you can get online.

In my opinion, the enclosures from people such as Kaly and Eboosted are a very decent price, particularly considering the work that goes into design and fabrication.

If this is above your budget, maybe look at DIYboards - they have enclosures and battery packs for a pretty good price.

I agree that the enclosures are generally well priced. I just didn't want someone to upcharge me a ton.

Just finished a batch of the one piece enclosure for XL Carver (HS11) deck, will post pictures tomorrow. 

For the one piece Street Carver enclosure it has been an uphill battle but almost there, if you want to use a sectional enclosure we can go with that. 

The price including mounting hardware and plastic cover will be : 
XL Carver ( Sanyo 20700B Cells ).     $90.00 
Street Carver ( 18650 Cells ).             $85.00

Plus shipping

Ernesto,
Where can I see the prices of your mounts? 
I am interested on the latest black ones for a Trampa MTB with Vertigo trucks.
Saludos desde Toronto!
