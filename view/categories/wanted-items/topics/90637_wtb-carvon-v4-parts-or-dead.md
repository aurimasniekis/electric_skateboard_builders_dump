Got a spare speed drive lying around that is broken? Makes you sad that a good portion of your hard earned cash is unusable and sitting on a shelf? Looking to rid yourself of this predicament and recoup a little dough? Drop me a Line!

Looking for any Speeddrive R's you are willing to send my way, I need them for parts. Doesn't have to be working of course, but the more functional the better. Specifically looking for the can but I'm sure I will need other parts for future repairs.
