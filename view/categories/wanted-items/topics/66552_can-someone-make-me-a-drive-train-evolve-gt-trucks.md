No need for custom, just get the trucks and modify them to fit Maytechs 90mm hubs and it should be okay.

It should only take a file and an hour of your time.

The rear Evolve trucks have a longer axle for the bearing you should be able to modify it a little and make it work.

This is basicly the only way to get it to work unless your willing to use 1000+ just on the drivetrain since people would have to make a new hub motor from 0 and they most likely wont do it if its just for one person.
