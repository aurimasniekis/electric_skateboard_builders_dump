Someone could make me a Evolve Bamboo GT battery mod with Samsung 30Qs? I understand it would include the battery pack and the adaptor to raise the enclosure.

Shipping to Melbourne, Australia.

Thanks!

Thanks for the feedback! Will get in touch.

Kevin: Can you make the complete kit including the risers? I saw the different types of batteries on your page. Do you think 30Q are the best option? How long from the order to the shipping?
