Anyone has an extra deck or even deck + enclosure? I'm just realizing that the high power build I'm planning will probably not work well for me (6'2") on the HAYA deck because of the 36" wheelbase, I need a wider stance. The Hummie deck has the right wheelbase for me.

CORRECTION:  I have a SS enclosure from _Big Ben_ for the hummie.

Thanks, I'm gonna wait to find the deck first which seems to be the harder part.

When they come back will it be through a group buy which will require a waiting period or would it be "in stock"?

I have a deck, I routed the bottom to fit NESE Modules.  Still as strong as before, just not perfect lines.  Make an offer.

Never been ridden.  Just stood on it over carpet to make sure it was still as strong as before.  Has a few scuffs, but grip tape will cover completely.
