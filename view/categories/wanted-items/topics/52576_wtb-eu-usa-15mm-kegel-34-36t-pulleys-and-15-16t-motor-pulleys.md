Does anyone have some spares lying around? Doesn't matter if new or used. Only thing is I don't really trust printed ones.

Can someone tell me what the belt length on this set is?
I guess the motor pulley is 16T?
@torqueboards

Also I am in the market for an affordable 6374 sealed, sensored motor <190kv. Is bkb the best option?

Belt length is 265mm. Pulley is 16T.

We also have 15mm pulleys without the big hub (shown in the picture, which I don't like) :)

We have 6374 but not sealed.. We also have a 6380 4100w motor soon :wink:
