Hi guys, 

As the title states, looking for some odds and ends for multiple builds. 

Need some abec's, would prefer 107's but 90's or 97's would be fine/ok just want them in red or black. would reallllly prefer metroboard red's. Don't want any green's. Pinks are cool too but they're super rare/expensive/annoying to mount. 

Also looking for a raw silver etoxx bull bar 

now motors, I've got a couple sets so I'm thinking about moving a few of them around between boards so I'm either interested in: 
2 Big ol' TQ boards 6380 170kv's 
Or something like 2 6355 170kv - 200kv or even something like a 6365 in 170kv - 200kv

Basically I want some 170kv - 200kv "smaller" motors, OR the tq boards 6380's, or 6380+ but those 100% need to be 170kv. 

Also want some Trampa Gummies, I'm not interested in blue, just red or black there too. 

I'm assuming I'll need to buy motors new but if you've got a bull bar or abecs you want to part with I'm your guy.

Are those Abec 11â€™s or clones?
Also you sure they arenâ€™t 83â€™s?
If abec 11 and 97â€™s, Iâ€™m interested. That is if OP isnâ€™t buying them. 
Sorry to hijack. ðŸ˜¬

Yikes!!
How much would shipping be to Canada in the cheapest way? Like in a bubble envelope no tracking? They are quite nice.
