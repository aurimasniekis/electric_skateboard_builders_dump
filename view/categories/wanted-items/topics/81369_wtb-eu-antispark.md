Hello all, looking for a (complete, so no PCB only) antispark for a build of mine, just a simple single build, so nothing too fancy
If you have this in your drawers, that would be awesome !
With or without the push button !

Good day to all :wink:

Does it have the so called "pre charge" function as the fatboy does?
