Hey, I need a new VESC. As enertion does not offer a repair service, I would also like to get the old one fixed. I live in Eu, please suggest a good seller and product. Thanks!

Faraday Motion sells VESC in eu. I bought mine from there. Very nice company to deal with.
Another good site to get VESC is from esk8.de

Does Maytech has bootloader installed now? If not I wouldn't buy this vesc because you are not able to flash it with other firmwares for example ackmaniacs 2.54.

I'm fine with 2.18 which is what they have on them already...

```
Once you tried 2.54 you would never go back to 2.18. Watt control mode is better than current control and you can adjust the throttle/brake curve.

hehe, seems I'm one of the remaining guys that prefer the current control mode; maybe I'm too used to it since HW 4.6 !

Well so far my experience of VESC has been disappointing since I got sold a second hand dud, so I think I'll take the savings and go for a Maytech one with 2.18, they're only Â£85 delivered!

@darkkevind if you want this to be a fair comparaison, you should look to include the VAT / taxes to import such product.

As long as the item isn't sent via DHL or FedEx, you don't end up paying VAT or import taxes...

yeah I know, just saying that if you want your comparison to be fair with @fottaz and support local shops in EU; it's better to compare apple to apple which means include the fact that you must pay import taxes as per the regulation.

it's hard to get people to understand that we are paying taxes on Imported goods, all costs a company has to sustain will get a bit higher, as I often say, that's pretty obvious

Otherwise, it's your choice to support just Chinese companies or EU&Chinese companies togheter, getting a more affordable assistance in EU instead of somewhere in China, faster and Insured shipping...

who cares about this

I'm all for supporting the little guys, but when you're just buying what the Chinese are making and selling it on with a profit attached, if I don't have to pay for your profit, I'd rather not.

If you produce something yourselves and it's of similar value and quality, then I'm happy to pay for your services and expertise... #justSaying

I test them and wire up if needed, you get insured shipping and faster than Ali. 
This is offered by my own Company, not from chinese.

If I will produce a made in Italy Vesc the price wont be lower than 150, Will you pay for It?

the profit, even if marginal may also help the little guy in EU to invest into some R&D and so on; we are not talking about multinationals here or thousands of VESCs; just hobbyists that do that for their passion.

```
To be fair the Maytech VESCs come pre-wired up with bullet connectors, I'm quite capable of soldering my own connector on the other end...
If I have an issue with it, I can just return it as I have done with a few things in the past, sometimes they just say keep it and send a replacement anyway, like Benchwheel did with my remote...

Don't get me wrong, I'm not putting the little re-sellers down, I've been a re-seller in the past making tidy profits on what I re-sold, but for me, I don't need a re-seller, not unless their prices match closely to those that I can pay going direct.

150 GBP or EUR is just far too much IMO.

@darkkevind I was here just to saying what I can do for people that are not capable in soldering like you and that want something in EU like asked in the title of this Thread.

You got your deal! that seems to be perfect ;)

Made in Europe/Italy is not made in China, so you can forget to find 100â‚¬ vesc here!

Please let us know how the aliexpress vesc works out for you, I see you had some other exciting experiments with electronic components... I would also rather go with someone in EU than China.
