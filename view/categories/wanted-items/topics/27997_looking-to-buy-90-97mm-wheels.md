Yeah the JLabs wheels are very Premium, it would't be if it the name wasn't :)))))

Very high quality wheels, very good adherence at speeds of 35mph+

Works on snow and mud, the compound used to pour them is called "michelin envy"

I'll let you decide by yourself what is the best as it can be easily figured...

i have the Jlabs 90mm wheels on my raptor and they work great, much smoother than the rock hard enertion 83mm powerwheels.

I'm running a set of 97mm eBay clones and they are pretty good. I believe they were around $50. For quality reasons I'd buy the wheels @JLabs is selling though.
