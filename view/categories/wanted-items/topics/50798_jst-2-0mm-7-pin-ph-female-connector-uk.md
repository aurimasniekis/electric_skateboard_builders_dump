Does anyone have a JST 2.0mm 7-Pin PH Female Connector they are willing to sell to me in UK? I can't seem to find them anywhere shipped from the UK and was hoping not to have to wait to get them from China.

Thanks.

Thank you for the link, I think I need one of [these](http://uk.farnell.com/jst-japan-solderless-terminals/phr-7/housing-crimp-receptacle-2mm-7way/dp/3616230?MER=bn_search_2TP_LastViewed_1) and some of [these](http://uk.farnell.com/jst-japan-solderless-terminals/sph-002t-p0-5l/contact-socket-28-24awg-crimp/dp/2399572)?

Unfortunately the minimum order quantity for those is 100! Not sure what I'm going to do with that many connectors...
