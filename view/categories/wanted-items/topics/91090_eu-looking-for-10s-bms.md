I'm looking to buy  a 10s BMS for my current build. Nothing fancy but something reliable that has a good track record like the [Bestech D140](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/batteries/products/bestech-d140-charge-only-bms#), [Daly Power 16A 10S](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Daly-Battery-pack-bms-10S-36V-16A-25A-35A-45A-60A-BMS-Used-for-36v-10ah/4165007_32875971231.html) or [ANNPower 15A 10S](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-15A-BMS-for-36V-li-ion-battery/1195130789.html). I'm open to alternatives though.

I'll be using it for charge-only so it doesn't have to handle high amps.

Thanks :pray:
