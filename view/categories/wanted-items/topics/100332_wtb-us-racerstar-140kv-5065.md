Looking for a single new Racerstar 140kv 5065 for a mini build.  Other motors are acceptable as long as they are...
- reliable
- 90kv to 170kv
- sealed
- sensors
- 5065

I'm hoping to spend around $50 but there's a few more dollars in the budget if need be (they are only $42 shipped new from China as a price reference).  Hit me with your offers!

Will an 80100 work?

Lol I don't think so, it's the BKB 60xx fixed forward Caliber mount so it'll be a bit wide...I could use a 63100 if it wasn't for the weight limit
