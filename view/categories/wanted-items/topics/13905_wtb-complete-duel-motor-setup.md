Hey Guys,

I am looking to retire my old Gen2 bamboo and wanted to see if anyone had a good dual motor setup for sale, Bamboo GT or something custom? Please let me know if there is anything out there.

Thanks

Raptor 2 still available at a nice price point. Downside is that it ships in 6 months. The Inboard looks also nice. Do you have any requirements?

I had a reserve on the Raptor but after all of the stories I have heard from them Ill wait to see what it offers and got a refund. Looking for something with at least 2400W+ 7s or 10s battery thats not too crafty and possibly something that has decent range and re-gen braking.

I currently have a raptor dual that has been barely used that I'm trying to sell if you're interested.
