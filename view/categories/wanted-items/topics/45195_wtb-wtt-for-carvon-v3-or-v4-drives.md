I'm looking for a set of Carvon V3 or V4.  V3 DirectDrive, V4 SpeedDrive or V4 TorqueDrive, doesn't matter, they just need to be in near new or new condition.  Thanks for reading...

I'd be pretty pissed if they didn't ship them within the 3 days that they have listed in the top of the page with bold.

Last couple of times I've checked the website they had no mention of any Carvon drives. Then looked last night and they had all 3 listed but with only the torque drive showing stock

Honestly, she will prolly ride it once and say "Nah, this ain't gonna happen" :).  But that's ok too, means I get a new set of Carvon V4's :slight_smile:.   

I built a Jet 33 awhile back and she hated it, but it was a 6s dual 280kv, so very little torque and too much speed for her liking.  Im hoping this is the opposite.

Carvon v4â€™s + 10s (or 12s) = low speed and waaay too much torque for her liking. mission accomplished!

It'll most likely be 10s.  Ill have to figure out acceleration curves now for sure :slight_smile:

Ordered two of the torque drives on Sunday. They weâ€™re finishing up the urethane  and shipping today.

Edit: Jerry had said that currently the fly wheels clones or the MBS unstoppables are what fit . There will be an adapter released for the Abec wheels

Do you know if there's an estimated release date for the adapter? I tried emailing info@carvonskates.com but haven't gotten a response yet.

Those are pretty :slight_smile:

@joeadams101  do you have a wiring diagram for the phase & sensor wires that need to be replaced or substituted?

hey, i helped a friend put these together over the weekend. the higo connector it comes with is pretty straight forward. the three hall sensor wires match the phase leads colors of the phase leads. that leaves the black and red wires which go to the ground and 5v pins. the only weird part is soldering on a bullet connector to the phase leads because the wires are really thin.

i kind of like the higo connector. you can keep the exterior of your enclosure really tidy by having just two wires sticking out.

Only sensor wires. VESC can auto detects phase wires

Man the connectors have thrown me for a loop. Iâ€™m not entire sure how to connect to the vesc. Iâ€™m assuming bullet connectors as usual?
