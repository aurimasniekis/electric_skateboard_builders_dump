Add the title says, I'm looking for 4x 70mm axles. Just wondering if anyone has extras kicking around.

What are you using them for? I feel like maby setups workout better with 80 or 90 mm.

Using them on a spud with TKPs. I feel like 80s would be way too wide.

Ahh, I see.

What mounts are you using?  Just need to be sure you have enough room for motor clearance. Running smaller than 80s can make it tight.

Just don't want you to end up in a position where you have to buy more.
