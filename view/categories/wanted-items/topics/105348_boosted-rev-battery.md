If you go into the forum that will actually tell you the truth and not censor information. 

There is a recent thread about battery builders. 

One of them could make a battery for you.

Sorry I am new to this website and am not sure what you mean by go into the forum @Fosterqc . Do I just search battery builders on the websites search tool or is there a way to get into the forum that your talking about that doesn't utilize the website's search tool?
