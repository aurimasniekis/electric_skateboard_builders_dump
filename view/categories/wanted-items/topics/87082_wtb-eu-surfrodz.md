They're bad with emails and calls. Just go to their site and make an order of what you want. If you have questions SR won't answer I'm sure some of us can help

It's just a language barrier. He's asking for help from the community.

@Freakboard SR doesnt reply to emails often and they don't really export. I assume you're near Europe with that name? Buy from https://www.sickboards.nl/en/99_surf-rodz?search_query=surfrodz&fast_search=fs

If you're outside the US you can't order from them at all.

You need someone from the US to help you, they need to buy the trucks and then forward them on to you. If you want to buy quickly you need to get from sickboards.. but even stock there now is limited on full kits.

So there we have it.

* Sickboards have the EU market sown up
* Surf Rodz do not answer email, especially from a EU source
* You need a US reshipping service to get the great deals that sometimes come up on the SR site
* Spacers and Axle bolts are too expensive and can be sourced elsewhere
