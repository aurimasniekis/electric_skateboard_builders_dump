I don't know, never use sk3 6374 myself. maybe someone tried both could answer.

just this one is good,sealed, 28 pole core, not easy to get hot, torque is very good,  net weighted 790g .

The phase wires on those motors look like normal wires and not silicone...so expect to change those. Most likey the wire protective layer will start to crack. 

Also 10mm shaft and i dont see a keyway. 

Nevertheless still a tempting price.

I wouldn't go with @dickyho, he sells crap and then lies about it. Those aren't true 6374

I'll bet his motors are made on the same line as many others offered around these parts...they may have stiff leads and cheaper components but they perform similarly

Buddy, you sold me a kit that was functionally useless, lied about our conversations, and were generally slimy and totally unhelpful when I objected. I'm going to warn other people on this forum before they buy from you, and have to deal with the obnoxious process of returns/etc themselves.

Cheers. Or piss off, whatever really

my friend, check all massage you posted, you pointed out all those don't exist problems uppon you just received them. and before actually use or test any of them.   and you were blackmailing for refund.

Lies on lies, dicky. I did test it, as I said in the comment you linked. It's too weak to go up a hill, or get itself out of a crack in the sidewalk. It also started falling apart on the first test. It is also measurably not a 6374 stator in there.

You keep spinning your marketing nonsense, I'll keep calling you out on it. Your products are not as advertised, you are not honest, and your response to issues with your product is to blame the consumer, lie to them and everyone else, and offer no real solution.

I requested a partial refund as the product was not as advertised, which isn't blackmail either. You won't shut me up by lying, dicky.

Miami Electric Boards - maytech 6374 waterproof sensored motor. Paid $113 total... inclusive of fast and free shipping. It was a Black Friday deal. They will have another deal in December going on. Each day a different product. 12 days of deals or something... check them out.

Great vendor (Oriol) to work with... and they send you that little esc motor to vesc adapter for the sensor wires for free!

Like dicky has said in the other post the size of the motor is determined by the length of the whole motor and the width of the whole motor. You don't see torqueboards selling a 6374 motor with the stator size as 6374. Now when you say it's weak I'm not sure how this could be because that stator size is slightly larger than the motor I am using now and my motor is very powerful. What esc and batteries are you using? I saw you said something about 20a cont, that is not enough for esk8 and that is most likely why it's not very powerful

I know, I wasn't expecting a 74mm stator of course. 30mm still seems small. I've tried it with 10s and 6s batteries and it's pathetic in either case.

20a is perfectly sufficient for a comfortable 10s setup; that's ~1 hp. 10s is high for a 270kv motor, so I tried it at 6s on a friend's setup which should be good for 50 amps, and it was still shit.

I'm keeping the trucks for another build, but I think this motor's scrap. Might use it on some other non-skate project.

Ahh ok. I bought some wheels and an Esc of @dickyho just yesterday. I hope it turns out well, I am thinking so as I have asked him multiple questions and he has been very fast to reply and very helpful

Well, good luck and it's probably fine. If it doesn't you're probably SOL; those manners only apply when he doesn't have your money yet, and I think people should know that before purchasing from him.
