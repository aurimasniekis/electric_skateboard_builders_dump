Hey guys does someone need a full working FocBox just the USB broke off. Someone with smd skills or equal could repair it easy.

Just write a price you would pay if interestet -would get shipped from germany. :slightly_smiling_face:

FocBox comes without wires for motor and without xt plug just the cables.

Thanks!
