So I plan to make myself a Firefly remote, but while I'm building my board I need a working (but cheap) remote option for use in testing etc.

This seems pretty big and bulky for eskate? I'd perhaps get it if I could take out the internals and put into a smaller chassis over time, but I assume the bottom part is an oversize battery?

Ahh interesting, is this meant to be of decent quality? I generally avoid eBay listings with a month-long wait time though, but I can look around for the same remote.

Yes it's bulky but reliable (ok my receiver died after 3 weeks) and you can mod it, the long throttle throw is good for control.

It's for 3 or 4 AA batteries. I recommended this remote because you said cheap and i guess you want it fast. The link by @moon is awesome if they deliver to your country (I can't order it to austria).

Mini remote is the shit. Simple, works every time, no dropouts.

This is the exact listing I found not long after I posted my reply, seems like it's the one to go for as my standard reliable controller :) Thanks everyone
