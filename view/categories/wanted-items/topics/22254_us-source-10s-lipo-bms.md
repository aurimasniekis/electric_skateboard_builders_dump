Looking for a 10S LIPO BMS. Don't have time to wait for an overseas ship due to moving. Suggestions for US source? Also will need charging port and switch.

I've got the BMS that came with the group buy from @Jlabs if you want it.  I've got a switch and charge port as well.  Ill warn you, its huge.  Ill see if I can get a pick before the day is out, but its crazy busy right now.

It's 4x7.25.0.5 in.  The sticky residue is where I took the tape off when I pulled it from the pack originally.  It has literally been used to charge 1 time and then I replaced it for something smaller.
