Ideally with charge + discharge BMS.

Here's the tricky part; I need this shipped to Mexico.
[DHL's battery shipping policy to Mexico](http://www.dhl.com.mx/content/dam/downloads/g0/express/shipping/lithium_batteries/lithium_battery_guidance_document.pdf)

If you think it's worth your while, make me an offer.

You could use lipos, and I believe that @Eboosted makes segmented packs for trampas, you could talk to him

Haven't had much luck yet, but if we can get enough orders it might be worth trying to get them shipped to the U.S. and then driven down to Mexico and distributed as such.

We build custom batteries and are located in  Austin, Texas.
 I don't think it would be to difficult to ship to you.
