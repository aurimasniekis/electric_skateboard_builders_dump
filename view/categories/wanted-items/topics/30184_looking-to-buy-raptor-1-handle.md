@joeadams101 Do you have access to a 3d printer? 
If yes I can model up my raptor 1 handle and share the file for you to print.
I doubt anyone would be happy to sell you a single handle but hopefully I'm wrong!!!

Have you looked at pull handles?

Will a printed one hold up? I thought printed would break when the weight of an entire board is carried around.

Really depends on the printing direction and material type. I would say at least ABS and maybe even Nylon.
