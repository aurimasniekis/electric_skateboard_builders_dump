They all worked, but then they just stop when ever they seem fit. The controllers themselves are fine, but the dongles keep breaking.

I don't think it can get much cheaper than the link @Karmannghiagirl shares. Free shipping for $26 usd. 

Switching to gt2b was the best choice I've made for my esk8. I am much happier with it!
