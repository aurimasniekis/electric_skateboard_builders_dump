Broke my battery pack a while ago and board was left collecting dust over the winter. Now it’s getting warmer and I need to revive it.
Preferably meepo/ownboard/wowgo pack or similar in shape.

Have you seen that Meepo sell the packs online? They do the high discharge sanyo 20700 too. Reasonable prices too.

Yes. But I feel like they’re a bit overpriced. 20 cells of sanyo 20700B costs around $150. So bms + labor + shipping from China adds another $100. That’s more than half the price. I think it could be cheaper.

$100 to have a new battery made is pretty good in my book. 
You could get a 2nd hand one though so here's another bump!

where are you from?

I have two old meepo batteries for cheap. they are really not good cells, but good enough for chinese esc.
or I could replace cells with samsung 30Q, so you will basically get new battery with old bms.

Those prices are pretty competitive. I make packs and my prices are not far off from meepo. I can make a 10s3p of samsung 30q's 9ah 60amp+bms for $280 including shipping to u.s.

Ride1up has 10s3p Samsung 25r on “sale” for $175 (U.S.only). 60 amp bms at least I think that’s what it is.
