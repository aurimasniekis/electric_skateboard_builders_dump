Hi there!

I´m looking to buy the battery / electronics enclosures from a boosted board.

I really like the shape of these and would like to make some out of carbon fiber, thus I need them as a mold.

The boosted battery is epoxyied to the case you will likely destroy it before you remove the case from the battery. 

Just get an enclosure from @Eboosted they look like the boosted enclosure but are high quality.

Batteries can still be in the case. Maybe somebody got a dead battery pack.... 
I know the awesome Eboosted enclosures. But I got the hole equipment and like to do things by myself ;)

I have a V1 BMS, with the batteries and the original ESC attached to the v1 motors if you want it.
