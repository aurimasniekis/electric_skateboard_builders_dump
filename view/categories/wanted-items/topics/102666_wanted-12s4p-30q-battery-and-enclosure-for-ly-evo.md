Hello, I'm looking for a 12s4p 30q single stack with bms battery premade or builder (one that actually does it in week or so and not months of waiting). Enclosure for Landyachtz Evo falcon. Both new or used.

Was gonna order Psychotiller battery n enclosure but seems he's busy and not able to meet deadline according to some threads here. Located in Socal

Wish I asked the forum as well, I ordered a 10s4p landyachtz evo battery from psycho and have had 0 response. Do you think its worth waiting or should i pursue other options?
