Hi everyone, looking for a 10S 42V charger (or 41.5V you know what I mean) 4A to 6A current (it's for a 12Ah pack).
Looking into Europe for shipping reason, but if Swiss guy have one it's good too !

Why do you say that?

Whoops. if you order from aliexpress make sure to tell them what plug you want.
