I want them!
I've used 18650 form old laptops and even the cheapy ebay/amz cells for other electronics projects.

Most of them are spent now, I need some more cells for remotes and random things.
So If you have an 18650 pack that won't cut it for an eboard, send them my way....

after the cells hit around 300 cycles they are reduced to 70-80% capacity. but this is fine for low power things like lights and remotes, tiny robots....

25r @ 80%  = 2000mah
30q/hg2 @70% = 2100mah
30q/hg2 @50% = 1500mah
Stil usable for remotes ;)

i'll pay shipping, maybe a few bucks if they are decent capacity.
open to trades, 3d prints, spare parts... idk....

I have maybe 100 or so cells in the 1500-2000 range that didn't meet my 2100 cutoff for my PowerWall

I do have about 50 laptop cells that are around 1500 to 2250 mah range.
