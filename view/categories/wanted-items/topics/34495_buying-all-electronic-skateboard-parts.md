I've never owned a Torqueboards VESC so I can't comment.

Whichever brand you decide on it's worth doing a search on the forum here to check for problems to save cash/time in the long run

edit: I also bought the fast charger for the pack, if that helps sell my case at all :)

i need only the cells and you got ripped off hard for that in my oppinion

you got like 50$ worth of batteries in there 
the bms is too weak for me to usr and so is the charger and the on off switch i already have that 

i think you would sell it more easily by just parting out and sell it that way
