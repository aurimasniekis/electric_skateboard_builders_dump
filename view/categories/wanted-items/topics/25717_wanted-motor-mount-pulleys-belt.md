Hey Korry,

Thanks for the message. 

I'd love buy one of your mounts please.

It's for a SK3 - 6374, and I would like the non tracked shipping option.

Please let me know how to send payment.

You could also just buy one from alien or protoboards.

Pretty much everything is sold out at protoboards at the moment. I hope they restock soon as there a quite a few bits I would like to order from them

Well they say they want to restock soon so you will have it probably the same time as the mount from the US when it is ready and shipped

But my protoboards mount was like 40€ shipped which is far less than the US one will cost you ;)

@johnny_261 has a great pulley kit with belts too for flywheels. Shipping is also fast from Canada.

Hey @DavidBanner !

Just saw this on UK Ebay. Hmm not exact ratio as yours after but difference is very minor ( I think) :) 

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Electric-Skateboard-Kit-Parts-Pulleys-And-Motor-Mount-For-83-90-97MM-wheels-DIY-/152546001622?hash=item23847342d6:g:cuwAAOSwX61ZFYhr

They also do just pulleys as their mount won't fit your SK 63xx . I'm also looking for a decent mount of the same size :(  

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/152505100375

Let me know if this works or if you have aleady found solution - I'm stil looking ( @ProtoBoards - we are desperate for new stock :P !!  ).

Well you can use the calculator ( saw link somewhere here) to calculate desired ratio for speed you're after. Honestly you can play around with ratios ;) any luck with the mount ? I have looked into waterjetting my own but for the price I think I'll wait until protoboards have stock. It is still killing me to pay £39 for piece of metal :frowning:

yeah they ain't cheap are they, but without it no e-board so it's money well spent...

I got my mount sorted, just waiting for it to arrive.

I have a feeling mr protoboards is going to have a very busy july

Have you bought your mount somewhere locally? I'm struggling to get one myself.
