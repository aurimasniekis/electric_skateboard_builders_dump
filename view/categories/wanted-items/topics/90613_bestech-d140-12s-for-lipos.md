I donâ€™t remember the original price, but something like 25â‚¬ plus shipping would be nice (shipping shouldnâ€™t be more than 10â‚¬)
Still packed like new.

Sorry but that's not much cheaper than just getting it straight from the sellers like buildkitboards.com

And why would it be "much" cheaper? It's a brand new item? These are things that people keep in their drawers just in case. No point giving them away when you might need them one day..

Ah didnt realise that. Just thought people reacted to ``get rid of it``. But in that way its a nice thing to offer to sell :slight_smile:. @Andy87

Is that the Bestech D140 for 12s? Is it rated for 15A?

Ok, I am cool with that if the shipping isn't exorbitantly more than that. How do we proceed?
