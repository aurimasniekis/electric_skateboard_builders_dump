I am looking for a battery pack builder who could build me a 10s, 8p battery pack. I would need 2 quotes, one for if I supply all the cells and the other for the builder to source 30q cells for the pack. There are 2 restrictions. (1) The pack must be flexible. It is going onto a trampa deck which has loads of flex. (2) the pack must be able to be separated into airplane friendly packs, preferably (10) 1s 8p packs. 
Thanks,
Thomas

No DIY pack can go into a plane, unless it went through expensive certification. Some forum members did manage to travel with their DIY packs, but that's irresponsible if you stop for a second and think.

Unless your pack uses non-solder non-welded connections, like the NESE, you're not allowed to bring them into a plane.

Really? Even if you place them in lipo bags for transport?
Edit: Safety is the reason I was paying someone else to build the battery

expensive certification
[/quote]

what he said. If you are looking for legally allowed batteries, then Boosted standard or InBoard M1 are are only ones I think are certified to do so. I've thought about using the 3 M1 batteries I have for a build, that would be a 12s3p

I would suggest you just don't plan on traveling with this build. Just like our helmet debates, your life and safety isn't the only one on the line, you are also with a few hundred people who has no control over a lithium fire in a small cabin up in the air. Even with a lipo pouch there's no window for you to vent out the fumes

If you're willing to pay a battery builder you might aswell use NESE but you would also need some sort of container to make sure the individual packs don't short. And carefully monitor everything you ever put into the bag with them. Like usbs etc if a cable bumps about it could be vaporised by an 8p. There's no sort of situation where this is completely safe unless you have a dedicated case. And then imagine the weight of all of this together.

I would be the wrong person to ask because I only fly with Boosted or InBoard, those are my travel dedicated boards.

It is a guilt issue. If ANYTHING happened there‚Äôs  much less guilt since the responsibility can be passed onto those two companies.

Just to leave my two cents here
A 11s4p pack under fire filled our 100sqm flat in 5min with so much smoke that it was not possible to breath anymore. Even the open windows just gave me to come inside after 20-30min. Don‚Äôt wanna know what this would mean in a plane. 
I know it would be more easy to just take it with you, but please don‚Äôt fly with a diy battery packüôè

20x 2s 5000mah ü§î that would be 10s4p lipo.
What range you wanna kill with it?
It‚Äôs about 35-45km if I calculated right and something like 8kg for lipos only üòÖ isn‚Äôt it too heavy?

You travel so often with it that it‚Äôs necessary?
Bought my boosted board because I thought it would be nice to take. Till now never used and guess never will use because of troubles on the airport. Once I even had a long discussion because of my drone and 2 battery packs.
Usually it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue if you stay under 99wh but explain this to russian security üòÖ if they don‚Äôt want you to get it inside than they will not give you. Even wouldn‚Äôt know what to make than. Just safe the board on the airport? Would be a pitty...especially if you spend a lot of time making your own board.
Maybe more easy to go for a second board, like cabrio for summer days, you could get a travel board like boosted mini?ü§î which would be also more easy to pack

I‚Äôm from the USA. Security is very lenient here so long as your under 99wh. I travel 2-3 times per year where I would like to be able to take my board. I will look for some 4s 5000mah as those are maximizing the 99wh

Probably the best way.
I was always wondering why the battery is limited to 99wh but you technically could take 20 of them in one bag. If one inside start to blow the rest could start fire too.
I travel a lot and I really don‚Äôt understand some rules...like with drones in Emirates. It‚Äôs not allowed to have your drone in carry on, but batteries allowed only in carry on. So you need to check in your drone without batteries...üôà

What? This makes no sense. I would plan to place all the batteries in fire bags with about 3 or 4 packs per bag to that the fire would be smaller. I might even double bag them. I just had one of my diy lipo packs catch on fire after one of the cells overcharged due to a BMS failure.

They will all be connected to one bms. You wire up the balance cables from each parallel pack in parallel which gets all the cells balanced. Then you wire the rest up like you normally would

As you had your own experience already you can imagine how much smoke blown up when your batteries catch fire. Even if it‚Äôs only one it could be enough in the plane.

Just for my interest as I plan my next build with lipos. How much overcharged you or the bms the batteries before they blown up?

but then how do these packs break apart for this airline travel? you would need all bms wires able to disconnect.... all series cable able to disconnect and reconnect...  and the same for the bms... at least one of the main wires (pos or neg) would have to disconnect so you can have your 10 individual packs you ask for.

I don't have any of this data unfortunently. I should have replaced the BMS a long time ago when I found that the batteries were as much as .4v off. I assumed the BMS just needed to do its' work though and left it. When I removed the BMS as it wouldn't charge or discharge anymore, I assume that the highest cell just kept getting juice and the BMS may have been preventing it from overcharging before.

There would be a shit ton of adapters to transform the balance cables to how they need to be to hook up to one BMS but when all those adapters get removed, the pack would be isolated after removing the xt90 main port.

I wrote this to a facebook group that i'm in but it its universal so I am copying it here.

Here‚Äôs the lesson from this whole thing:
For an electric fire, cover you battery/board with wet towels.

I removed my BMS as it stopped working and I assumed that I could cycle my lipos a few times as they should have been previously balanced by the BMS and thus wouldn‚Äôt loose there similar voltages. On the very first cycle, One of the batteries overcharged when the pack was around 75% which caught me totally off guard. The battery started hissing and puffed up about an inch. I quickly took the board out to the cement pool deck at the hotel I was at. The hissing stopped so I assumed that the battery was STABLE. I got all the tools to remove my enclosure and the board burst into flames. Luckily I was unharmed and there were enough people around that knew what they were doing. There was no property damage other than a burn mark on the patio from the fire.

You can't use 1 bms...... If you add splitters to the bms lines you will cause a fire.... That would cause it to charge cells that are not low.

That is why you wire all the packs in parallel because packs placed in parallel will balance each other. So all the cell 1's would have the same voltage after a few hours of being connected, depending on how different the voltages are to start. They should never become different than each other once connected.

i feel like were either speaking diff languages or not on the same page here... there would be 10 packs in series... each pack is a 1s8p .... each packs positive would connect to the next packs negative until all 10 are connected. then the bms would plug into pack #1 negative side. the negative discharge cable on the bms hooks to an xt 90... and the main positive lead coming off pack 10 connects to same xt 90.. are we all here now?

I completely understand the concern. I have the same concern as well. The part that provides me with some comfort is that it happened during charging not while at rest. This is why I am not as hesitant to take them on a plane with PROPER SAFETY MEASURES such as pre-built packs and lipo fire bags.

I built a 12s/1p lipo pack that can be disassembled for flying. Its only 6 individual packs though, 10s/8p seems a hassle to disassemble / reassemble. The balance leads can be un-pluged. Also I use a ballance charger not a BMS.

What are the benefits of a balance charger over a BMS for this many batteries? I can get a BMS/ power supply that can charge the batteries in 1-2 hours. A balance charger would take 1 hour per battery and I play to use 8 of them.

Main advantage is more space in the enclosure and I already had a few ballance chargers before getting into e-skate. I also like that I can monitor the battery voltage and resistance of each cell, while for a BMS you just have to trust it's doing its thing correctly. You can charge 8 cells at one time with a balance charger. Your not charging each P set individually. :smirk:

The ISDT T8, is a nice balance charger.

For a BMS its more convenience you can just plug in and forget about it. Also just one DC jack rather than a bunch of balance wires etc. 

For larger watt hour packs the balancing current on a BMS is very small/slow, so it can actually take longer to charge to 100% with a BMS than a good balance charger. Sure you can get to 95% in one hour with a powerful enough supply, but that's equally true of a balance charger. 

Its each to his own kinda thing.

I made a new thread to get some more visibility but was wondering if anyone has used this company before. These cells look pretty good to me

They have been heavily discussed before.  30q are better.

Do you have a link to a thread? I am strictly concerned about safety on this pack, not size or weight

Sorry about some of the people here, batteries don't combust if you look at them.  Especially if you disable the entire pack for shipping.  Everyone always hears the horror stories and forgets about the other millions of lithium battery users.

You did however request a very unusual pack size and type.  Maybe build a non modular pack for stateside and come up with a different battery solution for travel.

I completely agree with @E1Allen. I have no complaints about the quality and performance of Samsung 30q. They function best for the electronics used today. I also believe that with the evolution of esc‚Äôs in the near future that can handle more amps 100a 180a  will open the door to using a cell like the Samsung 25r 20a 18650 and the Samsung 30t 30a 21700 cell. I know there are a few esc now that can handle the amps and motors as well. Two are being developed now esc one at 100a duel and one at 180a duel. So the options will open up.

I know. It‚Äôs obviously an issue. Anything ok to travel with battery wise is usually to small to amount to much.

If right used lithium and lipos quite safe, that‚Äôs right. And a million people use them safely, but fuck only one is enough to crash a hole plane...it‚Äôs kind a horror szenario but I think if you wanna fly with ü§î20x 4s 5000mah what is about 1680Wh you should know what you doing and get your batteries 150%monitored every time. Just in my eyes it‚Äôs irresponsible to fly with such a big bag, they still dangerous goods.

According to the regulations on Li-Ion batteries it‚Äôs the smoke created during an event that is the most dangerous. There is no way to vent smoke at 40,000 ft.

I‚Äôve seen it first hand and would prefer to not see it again. If you placed the lipos first in a lipo bag and then in a ziplock, it should get you the protection you need right?

Not sure thou about the pressure getting released. It could make your zipper blow up like popcorn and again the smoke will come out.

Not with chemical heat expansion. It‚Äôs a chemical reaction that doesn‚Äôt require air. So sealing in something wouldn‚Äôt help. If it did the Lipo bags would be air tight.

I‚Äôm not talking about preventing the fire in the first place. The bag takes all the heat and the ziplock locks in the smell/ fumes.

Yes any fire would be suppressed by the bag along with most of the heat. But it‚Äôs the air inside that expands when heated and this can occur with out the presence of air. So even if vacuum packed. The reaction releases chemical fume that expands.

So you would need a massive amount of extra air space. Something like a balloon would be nessessary to accommodate for this expansion. The goal of all this is to keep each pack small enough that the chemical expansion would be kept to a minimum.
