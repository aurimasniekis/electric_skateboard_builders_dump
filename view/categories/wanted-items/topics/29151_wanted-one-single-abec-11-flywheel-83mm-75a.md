I just need one wheel in used but good condition.  I flat spotted my drive wheel and I'm looking for a replacement because the other three wheels are in great shape. I'm in US. Please let me know if you got one.
Thanks
Michael

Your probably gonna have to buy a whole new set and save the other 3 for spares.
Or you could try contacting abec11 and see if they will sell you one wheel.

@Michaelinvegas sorry for the slow response.  Something flew into my motor or belt and it just instantly seized up.  Luckily I was kinda in a squat and I didn't get thrown off.  It just left a 20 foot thane line on the pavement.  I never found what made it seize up and ended up riding it another 3 miles home. Bump bump bump bump bumpðŸ˜©

@Namasaki thanks for the suggestion.  I didn't think of just requesting to purchase one wheel from Abec 11

I'll give it a try before I purchase a new set.

I was super stoked to hear that SK8trip Distribution was going to send me a single replacement Flywheel after my email request.  It even seemed they were willing to give it to me for free.  Awsome customer service from Diana.

I got a box in the mail yesterday that seemed excessively large for a single wheel...  They sent me a whole set. Free! I'm not sure if I deserve that but I am more that impressed with the SK8trip customer service.   They have a fan for life.  Never underestimate the power of a friendly email. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/3/331cb559bd1e9ae18c8b520a027a4410e2d2f097.JPG" width="632" height="500">

I'll sell you one of my new ones for the price of a full set and include three extra wheels for free. 

I mean you can't turn down three free wheels, amirite?
