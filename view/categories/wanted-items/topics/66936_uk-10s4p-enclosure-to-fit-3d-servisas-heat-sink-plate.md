Hi everyone,

I'm looking for an enclosure that will fit my 3D Servisas heat sink plate (dual focbox) and is also suitable for 10s4p battery packs. I've got a DB Freeride 38" deck.

Any one got anything?

Thanks,
Daniel

I have the same heatsink Iâ€™m going to be installing soon on my Diy... Iâ€™m using TB enclosure & battery 12s4p just by eyeballing it I can see thatâ€™s itâ€™s gonna be a perfect fit after I do the cut out...

@moon thank you.

@Rod12579 TB stuff is fine but it's from America whereas I'm from the UK. Maybe I'll have to get one from eskating.eu if I can't find anyone locally.

Cheers,
Daniel

You can probably ask @Eboosted to cut it out for you on one of his enclosures he has some heatsinks ;)

@Eboosted I've already got a heat sink plate. How much for an enclosure with it pre cut? Don't need any other ports to be cut as I've not got those parts yet.

Also, shipped to the UK (south west)?

Cheers,
Daniel

Depends on the enclosure, which one would you like?
