Looking for sheets wide enough to wrap 4p 18650 cells. Preferably from an American source. I saw that amazon had a roll of non adhesive back paper. Is there a spray glue for this or something?

I just realized mine is also not adhesive backed. :( I could have sworn I ordered with adhesive.... I wonder if hot glue would work?

This is a great source for adhesive backed fishpaper. They gave me almost twice as much as I ordered for free. Took 2 days.
