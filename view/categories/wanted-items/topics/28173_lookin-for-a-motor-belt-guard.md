I hear that a vinyl wrap is effective for light use. Lots of people like to use carbon fiber wrap.

Like this, except you could buy in smaller quantity.

Regarding covering your belts, I think the best option is going to be a 3d printed cover. Because most builds are all slightly different I don't think there are any readily available covers that you can buy. A custom solution is likely necessary. But then again, it would help if you gave some more details. :wink:
