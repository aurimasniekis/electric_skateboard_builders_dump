Need a bms and ordered one already and it had a few extra connections for more batteries which I don’t have. Not sure if I’m able to use it still or where I can buy a new one with fast shipping.

Not to be a total dick... but maaybe you shouldn’t be messsing around with batteries without doing a little reading first. It isn’t really something you wanna go all gung ho at.

Hey, tame it down a bit, this attitude won't get you good advice. 
If your BMS isn't one of the smart ones you can't use it. 
But really, before getting into your batteries "reading a bit more" is  darned good advice.

There is a saying:

"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"

Food for thought

If you are talking like this, I think nobody will give you any help. Be kind for the guys in this community. 

If you make a post without enough info nobody can help you. 
What we need: voltage of you pack 
Discharge need. 
Li ion or lipo.

I think you need to pull back on those reigns a bit there cowboy. Like @pjotr47 said you come out Huns blazing like this and when you have a question there won’t be anyone willing to help and all that anyone will say is use the search. Pretty much everyone here will help out someone in need but not if you are a noob and acting like a dink.

Haha yeah it makes me always laughing when some “noobs” with a small read time think they are the men on this forum.

This forum is full of people who have the same hobby and interest. 99% of the members respect each other and what they do. Almost everyone is willing to help someone. We often advise people with little knowledge to read a little extra and yet these people are still properly helped

Damn dude.... no need to be a child. A bad battery setup can burn your house down. I was giving advice not chastising you. But hey, you’ve read 12 hours. Do what you want jack....
