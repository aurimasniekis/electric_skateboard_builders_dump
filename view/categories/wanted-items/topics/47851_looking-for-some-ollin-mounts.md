I picked up some cool little 50mm motors from ollin to test out and of course they do not fit the typical mounts. I also emailed that dude who use to sell some in the forums, no reply. So I will put it out here..who has a pair of mounts to fit these..Im looking to put them on some torque trucks side by side..so I need a a left and right if asymmetrical...

I just use the standard Enertion style (i think?) Mounts ![camperpickup|690x388](upload://eWpSdOzP0OR9HcMuNjmKR9tWP03.jpg)

I'm not sure but I don't think they work with the Olin motors, they have a non-standard slot pattern.  

@squishy654 I'm using some standard 50mm mounts with Olin 50mm motors, just using 2 screws into the motors and 48h cured loktite.  Not my favorite choice but it seems to be holding up well.

Which has the non standard bolt pattern, the motors or the TB mounts?

The motors, I dont have one with me or I'd measure it but its slightly bigger than the standard 50mm hole pattern and slightly smaller than the standard 60mm.

So, it seems, mounts for these motors don't really exist then? I'm not keen on only using 2 of the bolts, I weight a lot..lol   Why doesn't Ollin sell the mounts?

You need a mount with an X pattern, last time I checked.

APS is an option...I think.
MEB still has some old school enertion mounts I think...

Eskating's mounts MIGHT work...I have no idea


Ollin had these specifically with their mounts, but they've since moved onto their 6085 motors.

Im not crazy about the idea either, but this is a board still in progress.  My plan was to drill holes for the other 2 bolts when I was sure of the motor position.  I've only got 2 short rides on it, but its been sitting for a couple of weeks and the bolts are still snug.

I will most likely drill the 2 additional holes before its over.  Just waiting on the permanent board before I do.

They are a little big for this motor though, it's prolly my best option though..

@Boardnamics has some 50mm motor mounts, he could maybe re-engineer the plate to fit olin motors?

@marcmt88 can customize for whatever you need. And he will not charge more (at least he didn't for me)

I second that notion, @marcmt88 can hook you up, regardless of which trucks and which motors you have.  The man!
