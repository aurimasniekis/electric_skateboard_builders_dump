Just like the subject line says, wanting to get an aluminum case for 2 VESCs 4.12 that will provide heatsink, hopefully avoiding another blown DRV8302 chip problem. Would prefer US seller, so I can get it ASAP.

I ordered from @Kug3lis recently and it made it to me in well under 2 weeks.  Barely over a week. 
I had it deliver to a friend's place and he doesn't come into town all that much so who knows how many days he had it before telling me.

I was talking about the Flipsky that @boardman had mentioned thatâ€™s on eBay. It takes a month for delivery.
