I have some caliper trucks that I just got (my caliper says they are 18.40mm from the two flat sides) and was wondering if anyone has a spare motor mount for a 63mm motor that they no longer need or have laying around

As a student i'm a bit on a budget, so I was hoping for something under $50ish including shipping. 

Feel free to leave your offers below or message me separately. 

Cheers!

You would get a better response if you listed your location either in the thread or your profile or both.
