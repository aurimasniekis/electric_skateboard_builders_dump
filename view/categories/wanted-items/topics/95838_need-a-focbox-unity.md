Zach is legit.  he sent me a free android phone along with the unity.  Good jerb dood.  Now it's time to find a replacement controller since both USB ports broke on my nano Xs.  

Suggestions?

I bought from Buildkitboards, who replied to all my emails, is shipping tomorrow, and us using my label for 2 day shipping so by wednesday I can be rocking my raptor with a remote I don't have to be an integral part of the charge process for, by physically holding the USB port onto the board during charging, while intently staring at the red light to make sure I keep the charge going.

I have half a mind to buy this one too since I don't know if reliability can be trusted. Probably can be trusted, and I probably blew it by shorting motor wires.

Yeah I had some sort of motor short in the wires, and I think that probably did my first unity in.
