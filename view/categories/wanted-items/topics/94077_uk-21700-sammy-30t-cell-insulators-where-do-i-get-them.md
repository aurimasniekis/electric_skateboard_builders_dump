Buy adhesive sheet and stamp out holes, sharpen a metal tube with the right dimensions and tap it into the paper over some wood

I cut it with scissors.
I'm fed up.:weary:
I also want to know the store where I can buy it.

You can buy them from Amazon Japan.
Not the best price but convenient.

Fishpaper is so cheap, just not that convenient to get. In the end I just cut them buy hand.

@pjotr47 thanks for the offer though
