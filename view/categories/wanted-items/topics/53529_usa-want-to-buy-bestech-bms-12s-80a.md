Hey guys I'm looking to get a BMS for my 12s battery pack but I heard bestech has a 2 order minimum.  I wanted to ask around this forum first in case someone might have an extra one laying around.  The specific one I'm looking for is http://bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html but if anyone has another 12s module I may look into that as well.

Also can someone explain to me the order process in the case that I can't find one from another forum member?  The website on bestech is pretty confusing; would I have to email them directly to place an order?

Yep, email them and tell them what you want. They will send you a spec sheet for approval. When you approve you may and they will ship a couple of weeks later. If you buy 2 I'm sure you can sell the 2nd.
