Why does is specifically need to be for matrix 2? Any wedge that uses your mounting hole dimensions will work.

Just to be clear the 51% is an electoral vote, not a popular vote. You are very welcome here :)

Etoxx @Nowind  have some that are specifically for MBS if you want to go top shelf

Other wise flatland 3d have some too that are more affordable but are longboard profile :slight_smile:
