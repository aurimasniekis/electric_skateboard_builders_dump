Looks like my build is going to be put on the back burner until I can source a good battery and some extra pieces until fall. Until then was wondering if anyone had a prebuilt in US that they would be willing to part with or just don't use. Range around 10miles, speed around 20mph. A few decent hills 25% in my area but not a deciding factor. Just looking for something around $600 shipped or so that I could put some good miles on this summer as I've got some great bike paths here in Maine but fairly rough roads. Let me know if you have anything you're looking to get rid of.
