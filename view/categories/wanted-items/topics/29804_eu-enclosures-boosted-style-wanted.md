Hi guys,

I'm building my first esk8. Logically I need enclosures for my build.

Since the board is rather flexy I'm looking for a Boosted style enclosure set.
Batteries in front. Wiring over the board, under the griptape. VESC and radioreceiver in the back.
Something like this would be awesome:

Can someone help me build these enclosures in Europe please?

Here is a picture of my deck may this be of good use to anyone..<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c630683365416e7f7bde0b9b340a3c4aea0a339d.jpg" width="374" height="500">

Thanks in advance

Greetings from the Netherlands

I know @Dunkirk used to make them but I'm not sure if he is still around. You could also 3d print the enclosures

I bought a set from @Eboosted like a week ago! Haven't recieved it yet so I can't comment on it, but other people seem to be very pleased with it!

I live in Sweden and the shipping cost wasn't that bad.

NI've made a few moulds for stiff decks. (I'm UK based)
If you give me a design I'll see what I can do. There seems to be a bit of interest in this kind of enclosure.

A blank one would be £40 or pre drilled with mounting hardware and a gasket would be £50.
I've made another similar mould for a deck with a different contour that may suit better depending on your deck. I'm in the process of finishing it up but here they are side by side.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/f/4f22c2bc77e251b7e783a57e4bb51cb3cc843cd2.JPG" width="666" height="500">
It's made to the shape of the landyachtz 9 two 5,

Hi @bigben are you able to make them less rectangular?
I don't think it will look nice when having 2 black little boxes underneath the board
Also what would that cost? Including shipping to NL

What did you pay for it if I may ask?
Definitely let me know when you get them!

I asked Eboosted for an estimate and what the measurements are for the battery enclosure. It looks quite big imo, keeping the flex of the board in mind

141USD with shipping included. Judging from the other comments I think it's well worth it, but we'll see. 

You can find the measurements in [this thread.](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-vanguard-and-never-summer-reaper-enclosures-for-sale/17137)

I could make any shape. 
The shape I made for my board was purely functional so everything fitted in. Are you in a rush? I have a mould that I didn't finish that may be interesting for vescs and recievers?

What I need to to is get a bit more time on my hands. Then plot out the space needed for a couple of focboxes and a reciever and make something a little more aerodynamic. 
Same for the battery pack.

Hmm 120 euro is quite steep imo. Will you also have to pay custom fees or did you sort that out with eboosted? marking it as a gift or something

Not really in a rush but it would be great if I could ride my board before the end of this month, my holiday.
Maybe I should face the facts and accept that that won't happen..

How much time do you think you need to make an 'aerodynamic' focbox and batterypack?
What would the cost be?

I don't think you have to worry that much. As long as you don't use this platform for marketing.
Helping someone out is always appreciated

Do you also have blank enclosures, meaning no holes are drilled? Even for the ESC ventilation?

that I dont have.  But, I would say,  holes are easy to sealed with a plastic rod melt gun.  I seal holes this way. Supper cheap.

PM me over some sizes I should work from and some idea of the camber in the deck. 
Let's see how it turns out to see if it's worth something!

Haha perfect
I got my vesc, remote, motor and bluetooth dongle from @fottaz through his website.
Should arrive here tomorrow!

His enclosures are allright, but I would rather have the vesc enclosure to be shorter. Like 10 cm for example

I've printed this nice design today - I've used Extrudr Green Tec filament and it's probably one of the sturdiest and nicest on the market. Should really hold well.
I've sanded it a bit so it's in a rough state atm, should look really sleek once it's finished - sanded, primed and painted.

That looks really nice!
Are you planning to have your wires run underneath the deck?

I'd like to run them above the deck, underneath the griptape. So those holes in the design would be unnecessary.
Is it ok to get it without the holes in the front?

Also, I've got a motor with sensor wires. This one; http://eskating.eu/product/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv-sealed-sensored/
The phasewire holes in the design are great!

Well, I've tested the whole setup and now when it works I'm trying to find a nice way to pack everything up so that it is sturdy, safe and easy enough to maintain. I'll have the batteries (2x4S Lipos) in another enclosure. I'll run the serial XT90 cable from VESC to them for which I need that XT90 hole. :slight_smile:
 
There's also a hole for the power button ready on the VESC enclosure. 
I'll have the battery indicator on top of the deck, above the back wheels. That way I'll get shorter connections in comparison to front mounting. 

I've remixed it to your liking: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2472906

Looks good! But the holes for the phasewires were perfect and now you got rid of them haha
Also my switch will probably be located on the battery enclosure since the bms is located there

Where are you located if i may ask?

I'm from Slovenia, fellow European.

But this is still WITH a powerbutton hole haha

What would it cost to print a battery + vesc enclosure and get it shipped to me?

EDIT: Yes this looks ideal (no powerbutton hole)

Well, I can try and print the VESC enclosure. You can then make finishing touches like sanding and painting the way you want.

I'm still trying to design and fit an enclosure for my batteries.
What BAT enclosure are you after? Any links from thingiverse?

Hit me up on PM, we'll try to work something out.

Looks great but I'm afraid that's too big for my printer. I could split it in two parts and then you'll have to merge/glue it together and finish it up.
Vesc enclosure is doable though.

Hi guys,

To give you some update about this topic.
Working with @Crossfire was a good experience, but his printer couldn't handle the battery enclosure because it was too big.
The vesc enclosure worked out really well!! Thank you again Crossfire
PICS COMING SOON

Atm @bigben has almost finished the battery enclosure. Only trimming and shipping is needed, so I expect to have it in by the end of this week!
Really looking forward to start building the damn thing (finally hehe)! Especially since today is the first day with good weather since almost a week ago in Holland! So I hope there will be more nice days this month so I can ride it when it's finished (;

It's out of the mould! I've left the flange as large as possible. 
If you need a mat finish I can do that then send it?

Is it too late to make the flange a bit narrower? Don't have the tools and environment to work on fibreglass
A matte finish would be great! Better than a sprayed on matte paint
