I am on a tight budget so buying second-hand trucks would be great. so does anyone have old trucks they'd be willing to sell to me.


(Preverably from Europe)

Get on Facebook and find a local longboard B/S/T group. You can get great prices on gear that's barely used

Maybe you should learn how to ride an unpowered board before you try to go 20+mph on an electric one...

I assumed that you've never been on a longboard before since you didn't know seemingly anything about trucks.  You also didn't heed anyones advice in your other thread about getting bigger wheels.

Ok, so your point is- If I don't know about trucks and don't take some peoples advice on wheels so I cant ride a skateboard??

You are going to fail.  You refused the advice of many experienced builders.  You will not be able to find motor mounts for skateboard trucks, you wont be able to fit pulleys on your wheels.  If you do end up making it work ill look out for the video of you faceplanting from speed wobbles when you try to go above 5mph

Its time to give up...

He doesn't understand that a normal skateboard with skateboard trucks wont give him a stable platform

Hmm, i partially agree with them but heres my advice, if youre going to use a skateboard deck, try using a longboard setup on a skateboard deck, like using longboard wheels and longboard trucks on a skateboard deck, see the differences and then you can progress from there. The pulleys for electric longboards wont work on hard skateboard wheels (i mean anything is possible just take a shit ton of work and possibly many failures) and just try to ride with at least a longboard setup before you try to go electric. 
Second advice is to just read read read and read the forums, read as much as you can before you plan to build an electric. Skateboards and longboards are generally very different and skateboards and electric longboards are in 2 different worlds. Just try to learn as much as you can.

Doesnt sound too bad, and some people on a budget drill holes on the kicktails and mount the trucks there, personally never tried it before but Im sure its worth a try if your setup isnt stable

Damn peeps relax :smile: let the kid build whatever he wants. Without doing proper research he will spend his budget on parts that won't fit, or they brake before he get it out on the street .
Anyway. Be safe and good luck
