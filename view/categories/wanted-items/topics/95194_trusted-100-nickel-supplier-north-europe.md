Trying to find a good and trusted supplier for nickel strips. Have one in UK, but shipping, tax and import doubles the price :frowning:. Hope someone can help :)

How pure is this?

And how much of this kilo is there still left? I feel like this will last for years if you only build a batt every now and then.
