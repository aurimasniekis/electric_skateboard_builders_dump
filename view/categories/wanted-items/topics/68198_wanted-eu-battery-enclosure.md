Hi Guys! I am lockig for a battery enclosure double stacked including Vesc. Ect. 

Found one here but the shipping cost is way to much for me, living in Germany.

Something like this or just simpler

Has anyone a good source for this in Europe?

What sort of deck is it for?

Hereâ€™s my instagram page there may be something there that might fit your requirements?
There is one that springs to mind that is 545mm x 145mm x 30mm or 40mm internal size that might work for you.

The enclosures I suggested weâ€™re made on the Landyachtz 9two5 deck so might be similar?
