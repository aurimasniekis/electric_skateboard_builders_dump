as the title suggests I'm Looking For Enertion Space Cell 3 (Raptor 1 Version) Or the E-tray because even though enertion had some they were too stingy to sell it to me, I look for new used or broken Raptor 1 Batts, I live in Brooklyn NY

*Created this thread because nobody had raptor 1 cells except for a broken one

You are probably better off having a new battery made that will fit in the board. A 10s3p 30q would do better than the original battery

only problem is that I need to fit the cutouts on the raptor 1 or else my OCD hurts, plus I already have a 10s3p LG HG2 pack sitting around

something like the raptor 2 etray

exactly that's why i was hoping to get a broken pack so i could go ham on it or maybe @psychotiller can (replace all the cells with ,30q and call it a day)

No. Psychotiller is busy making new things for his own website. I'm not running a salvage operation. If you want to buy used parts and build things with them, You need to do that yourself. I don't have time. Or want to spend my time doing that. 

This will be the last time I explain this to anyone.

Sad thing is. Enertion's new 10s3p packs for the raptor 1 is still using 25r. Basically I got it for the new lid and etray. Future battery would be 30q when the time comes. 

I don't push my boards hard so sagging is not really an issue. All batteries sag. Looking down at the LCD while throttle was the issues. That number is going to drop under load

No idea. I was asking about their upgrade a year before it was even made available. I don't think there were enough demand for it to even be made so only a few were available and it's not "gave" it's paid (overpriced) had to pay for shipping too!

If you have the deck just have a similar battery made for it. Or make it your self you don't need an old space cell.

I don't have a cnc to mill out the correct size plates for mounting for the two holes on the raptor 1 carbon plate.

The old batteries just had a yellow plastic plate where the LCD, port and button are hot glued onto it. No CNC. It was cut by a box cutter by the looks of it

This is one that Bara made for me a while back. ![image|666x500](upload://fT2ZebyzXB0hqGaI25ohRzUGitE.jpeg)

Raptor 1 battery is just dated. Still running it on my Raptor 1 though, but it can barely deliver juice for more than 20 km on flat and >10 km on a slightly hilly terrain. It’s a bottleneck that was also poorly put together. Better move on ....
