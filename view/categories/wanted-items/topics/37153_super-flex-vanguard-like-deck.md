Rode a few miles on a boosted v2 and it made me want more flex.
Loaded Vanguard is is nice but really not going to spend that much on a deck.

does anyone have a used one? or one of those china clone decks?

my bamboo pintail has some flex but not even close to the composite bounce!

had my eyes on db coreflex decks. expensive still but not as much as vanguard. 

trick is on enclosure and battery pack to deal with the flex.

looks nice but i'd want something <$100.
or i'll just stay with stiff spuds/rocker/potatos... 

but yea i've always use split enclosures so flex is no issue.

the boosted clone deck are only $25 or something crazy cheap lol

I have been thinking about an enclosure like @Kaly Trampa builds underneath a Vanguard or DB core flex.  I think you could do a similar thing and just get a flexier deck than you would want as the enclosure should stiffen it up a bit... But yeah, good flex decks are expensive... 

 But thinking about a Vanguard Flex 2 with a  divided (not split) Battery enclosure with @chaka newer dual diaganol mounts with those machined ronins..... mmm 6374,  mmm 10s4p..... mmm supa boosted...... these thoughts keep me up at night.

Diyeboard sells a vanguard clone(38 inch like the boosted). 
I ordered one to try out. 
Not sure how they are but looked good in the few videos I've seen. May have slightly less flex than a boosted board but cant tell for sure.

 Edit: other than that, since you're located in america there is customskateboards or whatever they are called. They sell some vanguard lookalike board aswell.

 Could try this http://www.customskateboards.com/blank-longboards/Blank-Freeride
I ordered this deck with 8ply and it has slight flex so I assume the 7ply will be flexy. Also its only 25 dollar board so if it doesn't work out it wont cost you much.

I like the fact that its wider. Only thing I feel abit concerned over with boosted board / vanguard decks is the width.

I'll try to get a video tonight if I can. The boosted board is my friends, so I don't have that at my house.  If you want real flex I would get the 7ply. I'm also modeling an enclosure like the boosted board has so I can also shoot you the stl when I'm finished if you wanted to make your own enclosure.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/6/36f244948c8413f44e1a235d3b4baaff0a4a28ab.jpeg" width="586" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/5/f53e30d0720097f82f23a8a07203bfa77b8f7018.jpeg" width="690" height="366">
