All I need to finish my first build is a 63 size motor! Looking for something used but but not thrashed. 6374 would be great, but 6355 would work too. What do y'all have laying around?

Wow, hijacking a thread much?

@Jinra, I would be happy to take one of them, but I understand if you want to sell both together.

@Ejsalvat, The kv is a bit too high on that one for my setup. I appreciate the offer though.
