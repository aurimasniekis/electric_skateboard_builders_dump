Looking to buy a decent remote. Due to my location (down under) basically every remote is super expensive. Even buying local through Enertion is gonna be like $150. I was going to buy the Benchwheel remote but its sold out everywhere. I know that the GT2b is really cheap so if someone has one with one of the smaller custom enclosures that would be awesome

I'm in brissy but I'm sure shipping such a small thing won't be too silly.  When I said atm I meant that this state of affairs changes daily  What I'm not using atm can easily become new build so take it off me quickly.

Had it my board for a day and realised I don't like it.  I prefer longer throttle travel remote like the maytech but they are pricey.  Its essentially the same unit as the enertion and its yours for 50 bucks plus shipping.
edit pm me

Well I'm still considering my options, but I'll probably get it off you after payday tomorrow night if you still don't want it

Too late I'm building something.......
