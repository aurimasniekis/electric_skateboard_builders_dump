Depends on what hubs you're looking for man.  I don't know about trampa hubs but I know there's more than one type of MBS hubs.

I would ask @okp if he plan to restock them. If no you can ask @Riako who could give you a good advice where to get some wheel sprockets as well, or @Nowind aka etoxx for sure can help you out.

I speak about sprockets all the time.
To be fair if you speak about sprockets you should also add which size of sprockets you want. I mean teeth count and chain size. I assume you want to go with iso06b, hope that is correct.

And well all the people I tagged have nice stuff for a nice price. If that‚Äôs still too much you will need to drill them by your own, but that is what you don‚Äôt want üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My 6061 grade sprocket last me  about 2400km for 1/4 of the price of some high quality sold from some sellers.  but if l can find a  drawing of the hub patern  this will help me a lot but l think l will have no choice to find a way to do it right . l will wait a little bit if can find some. Belt are nice but in the wood with all the dirt its no very reliable if a piece of wood roll in the belt will snap

I thought you already have the hubs?

Why not just to measure it out by your own. That‚Äôs not that difficult.

You could also use the search function. I know the drawings for mbs hubs are to find here. Just need some time of research. Sometimes google helps as well.

Hi Andy, what information do you have on sprocket geometery (teeth profile)? I have downloaded so many documents describing a sprocket profile but it seems like there‚Äôs always a dimension missing... I‚Äôm interested in chain drive with chain size: ISO 05B. I found ISO 06B a bit too big... what‚Äôs your view?
```

@spokie I‚Äòm running iso06b on my boards and i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much. So far I haven‚Äôt designed any sprockets by my own,  so unfortunately I can‚Äôt help you with that point. 

But maybe just get the sprockets from here

https://www.gearsandsprockets.co.uk/

Or any other source which is more close to you and than just cnc out of that the parts you don‚Äôt need to make the sprockets more light.

I have a set of etoxx 06b sprockets and they really not heavy at all with all that cut outs.

I might be over there in the end of the year and could bring you some üòÇ
But guess you want to get that done more early....

Yeah the supplier is really cheap that‚Äôs why I linked it. But you can‚Äôt find something similar around you?

```
In a way I can, but the sprockets available are standard designs ans will need to be machined to fit the necessary changes required. Machining is dirty expensive.... They reason why I ask for geometry is because if I can design what I need I‚Äôll be able to lasercut the sprockets... and that to me will be very cost effective.
I don‚Äôt want to take over this thread but it would be cool to meet you when you visit SA.

Ok understood that. Thought you have access to a cnc. Didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs only a laser cutter. 
And I let you know when ever we decide to come over to SA for a small vacation. Maybe you really need something I than for sure can bring (as long as I can take it into the plane üòÖ)

It‚Äôs not an unfinished one. Upper is etoxx, the down is from Unik. And yes there is a significant weight difference.

I'm getting a fresh restock on chain drives in few weeks. 

But FYI, I'm going to slow down the UNiK activity, I just spend way too much time and personal money to fix internal issues which I'm not responsible for and I'm no more having fun to do so.
