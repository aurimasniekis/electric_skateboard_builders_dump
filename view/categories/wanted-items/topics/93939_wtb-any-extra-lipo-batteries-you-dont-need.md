Hey guys and gals,

After building my board the wife (who thought my first board was a silly idea) now wants me to convert her scooter to be motor powered. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-dual-motor-30mph/88112

I have a Flipsky Vesc and a Flipsky 6354 190kv motor for the build but my budget for the batteries had to be used on something else (House emergency) so thought i would come to you lovely people!

Im in the Uk and in the need of a couple of Lipo batteries that someone desnt need and might just be willing to help a fellow esk8 rider out. Happy to cover the cost of shipping.

I know its cheeky but its worth an ask. Dont shoot me. I do have a faulty vesc i can swap if that helps lol

Thanks

Jake

I'd wait until HobbyKing has a sale, you can get a small 10s battery for $40 plus shipping if you're lucky
