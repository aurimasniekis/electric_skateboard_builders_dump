You can get them from Evolve France , I am from Belgium and it wasn't an issue. Shouldn't be a problem to have them delivered to Holland neither .But indeed it all depends of your budget...i paid 190Euro for front and back trucks (shipping included). I might sell them later to buy the parts i am missing for my mountainboard build.

Seriously? Damn they suck. Don't worry you'll find someone that is willing to sell you some on this forum. Because honestly , even though they are great they're not worth 200Euro imoo.But then again i never tested them with urethane wheels only with the 7" pneumatics...

I love them.  Some people don't.  I like the deep carves and don't exceed 30mph.

I regularly go faster than 30 in group rides and so do most of us so @Rod12579 converted one of his DIY evolve trucks to single kingpin for stability.

Then you might not want double kingpin.  Double kingpin are for carviness and turny

Do you use pneumatics ? I am pretty sure they are better with urethane wheels . With the pneumatics i don't feel safe at 40kmh but i didn't experience any whoblles and i like to have the trucks loose.

Yeah I personally don't like such carvy trucks but you can make them single kingpin it works well and it's super stable.

Yes; then you have a very nice set of TKP :smiley: 

And keep the thing you take off because some people need those ;-)

  i'll probavbly try with urethane wheels later on because i'd like my board to be much lower for carving. Carving with the 7" wheels is pretty cool but it feels weird being so high of the ground.Especially at higer speeds. Finding the right combination for carveing and speed isn't easy with those trucks.

Who wants to go over 30 mph at my age? Never broke a bone in my life, I don't plan to start now. Health care in this country went stratospheric!

Carvy truck all day, baby.

Have you contacted them by phone or email? I have dropped into the evolve dealer outside paris and they were actually very helpful. I seem to remember they shipped stuff to the UK for some guys on the forum too?

Huh?  I thought you were in the USA.  I guess not, because we don't have healthcare here.  I mean, unless you can afford $5000 to go to the doctor once
