Ok, with everyone switching over to Unity's, I'm thinking I might be able to shake loose a dual heatsink for a build I'm dreaming up. Looking for something like this... Thanks! ![PNG|281x499](upload://xRO91m3OnkeGXvnT2i4xAgNJv7v.jpeg)

You do know the same shop makes that for the Unity right?

Yeah, but I'm not lookin for a unity heatsink, just the regular Focbox heatsink in the pic. I know I can get it new, just wanted to see if there was one laying around collecting dust before I get one shipped from the EUüç∫

Oh right that would make it my bad, I think you probably could get one off someone upgrading 

Good luck

It's not exactly the Servisas heatsink but might be relevant.

Oh nice! I think I missed that becuase the heatsink was buried in the middle of the thread... Thank you, friend!

@mmaner
Please close. I'm trying to start a new thread and can't, could this be the reason why? Thanks!

No, that shouldn't be the reason. Are you getting an error?
