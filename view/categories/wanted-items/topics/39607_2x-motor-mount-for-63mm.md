Caliber II will not fit with dual 6374 motors, single is OK.  Another option is running crisscross (diagonal).   If you insisted on running dual 63xx motors, TB 218mm truck is the only one I know that is specifically designed to run dual 63xx motors. 

My custom design Caliber II motor mounts with dual 50xx motors :point_down:

Yes, those are Racerstar 5045s.  Check out Janux-esk8.com on ideas of drive train and motor mount options.
