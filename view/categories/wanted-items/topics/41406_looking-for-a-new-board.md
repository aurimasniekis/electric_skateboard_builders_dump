I am looking for my first electronic skateboard. I have recently moved to Florida from NY and I am looking to keep the speed I’m used to on my downhill longboard. Any recommendations? Looking to spend under $1500.

if you can stretch your budget a bit i’d go with @longhairedboy

he’ll make you a fully custom board. and he’s a fellow floridian!

That board is definitely a steal and very good just don't know if it's good to start in probably is not sure I just think it's a beast with those specs(am just paranoid with speed I guess ) it's probably good to start in if you play with the settings
