Just seeing if anyone in Canada has found somewhere to buy the pulleys and belts (kit) in Canada. I looked at the 36T ABEC Pulley kit from DIY electric skateboard, but shipping is $40 USD so I would be paying arpund $120 just for the belt and two pulleys. I am thinking I can do better.

Thanks for any advice (also my first post so if I put it in the wrong area don't hate me too much)

I can offer you a complete drive train (trucks, Motor Mount, Pulleys and a Motor) for 110â‚¬ shipped. Just check this thread out https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sale-trade-various-parts/54522/10

Thanks, but I am already buying those components elsewhere. I wanted a very specific setup

Shipping to Canada should be ~$20 from California to Canada.  Janux-esk8.com
