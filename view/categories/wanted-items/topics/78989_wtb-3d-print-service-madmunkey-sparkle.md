Looking for 3D printed service again, these time a remote case for my gt2b.
Was looking on eBay to see if @MasterCho had some but unfortunately not ðŸ˜©
If someone has one for sell let me know too. 
If not Iâ€™ll like one of theses remotes. They look promising. I live in California please let me know what you think

I donâ€™t think the Stl files are available for others to use. I did try to find them but didnâ€™t have any luck, maybe I am wrong though

It was ok, I rubbed it down ready for painting as i used support on the outside so the inside was clean for the install of components.
I have sat looking at it since because i never found a complete idiots guide to installation.

the sparkle files are definitly free to use on thingiverse.
sure @okp would be happy to get a donation for it , but in gerneral everybody can print them.
I like the sparkle very much. lays super ergonomic in the hand and is compact.
The nice thing about it, there is also a full tutorial on youtube, how to assemble everything.

If you need somebody to print, i could print you one, but keep in mind, iÂ´m far away too... :rofl:

The mastercho is also the sparkle? I didnâ€™t know that, thatâ€™s probably why I could never find it.

@MannyM0E I can see, Idk how well it will workout, my printer is only cheap and Iâ€™ve only got some pla on hand. If it goes well I could send you one. I live in Aus btw

Ok, I printed it twice, shell up and shell down.  Shell up ain't gonna work with ABS on my printer, it puts the perimeter to close to the outside of the bed and it pulls up. Shell down works, but it'll require a lot if cleanup.

Yeah. Pretty cheap one by creality. I saw the recommendation on here for it. Under $200. My first so not sure how to judge it. Seems pretty good.

There appears to be some severe underfil where there are gaps in the print. You might try upping your flow rate or adjusting the setting for diameter of filament down a few hundredths of a millimeter to fix this. @Makio13

Edit: Also notice that the holes are round. Might just be distortion in the picture. Check to make sure your belts on the x and y axis have the same tension.

I would think it would be cheaper just to find someone in Australia to print it for you now that the file is free? I looked to see shipping a 1 pound box and it was like $30 usd. Sorry
