Hi,im in need of 2x 15mm 5m wheel pulleys and 2x 15mm motor pulleys 8mm bore with 3mm keyway,preferably local so shipping cost is cheap.
Would prefer the push in style pulleys rather than bolt through. 
To fit ABEC 11 FLYWHEELS

I've said it a bunch of times, don't get the parts get the kit..its easier and complete...if you just get parts that's all you will have, if you want the kit get the kit..dont cut corners, it is already really cheap for what it is..its better to have extra stuff you wont need verses not all the parts you need..

Thanks but not what I need, iv had a full board setup for like over 2 years now just replacing the pulleys to 15mm i don't need all that.
I guess I'll just back order from Hong Kong and find something to use in the meantime.

Its not a board (I have no idea why there is a deck in the picture but it doesn't come with one), it's a kit that comes with everything but the deck and battery..it's designed to all work together...

I'd have to measure when I get home but it was a common size..I believe m5 or something, just guessing, but have someone take a caliper to them.

here's the bolts: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-cover-with-bearing.html

The ones that I have are around 4mm thick, so if you find them you should be good

Its skate hardware, I just remembered..you can use like a 2inch length skate truck mounting hardware bolt to mount this pulley to the core lol no really![15281658928761631390685218815532|374x500](upload://bpPjBOmwR4fC2KSX7GfRLEu18aq.jpg)
