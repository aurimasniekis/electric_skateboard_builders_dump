I don't have any recommendations since it would depend on your budget. But please don't go too cheap because if you buy cheap... you have to buy twice. It's proven throughout the history of eksate.

Welcome.
But don't expect us to tell you exactly what you need. Do the research and then ask specific questions about different components.
What you need is:
Board
Motor
Controller
Esc
BMS
Battery
Enclosure
Remote+receiver
Wheels
Pulleys
Belt
Loctite
Tools
Etc.

Honestly most people won't sell them used for a whole lot less than what they're on sale brand new right now.
And the newest ones have been updated to fix their biggest flaw (canbus failure)
Saying you're looking for "any DIY Parts" is extremely vague.
List what you don't have, list what you do.
And maybe give some insight as to what the goal of your board is.
There's a lot of helpful people on this forum.
But you only get what you give.
Otherwise the trolls come out.
