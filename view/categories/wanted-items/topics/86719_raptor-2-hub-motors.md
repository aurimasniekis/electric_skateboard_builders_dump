Looking for one or two Enertion Raptor 2 hub motors. Doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s broken or not but would prefer if the rotor was damaged/shaking. Send me your price in a PM :) Iâ€™m located in Norway but shipping worldwide is usually no problem these days.

Haha. This is the beautiful man that made this for me. He did a better job than enertion could. It's a shame they don't communicate their changes or I could've actually used it.

Is the only change that the threads are M10 on the new axle? Check if you measure 1.5mm between the threads because then itâ€™s possible to tap a M10x1.5 thread inside the M8 I believe. Should be 0.2mm clearance :)

Just out of curiosity, what are you planning with the hubs? I have a Raptor 2.1 coming to Norway in a few months.
