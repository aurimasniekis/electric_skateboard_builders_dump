They are roughly Â£117 from SR direct with a 80mm axel (which I presume you will want?)
Shipping is as we discussed in PM around Â£23.
Â£8 postal admin charge (To check package)
Â£24ish for import duties.

So from SR direct you pay Â£172.

From sickboards they are Â£151.30
Delivery is free to a UPS access point (Â£9 to your house but lets ignore this)
Â£8 postal admin charge (To check package)
Â£24ish for import duties.
Â£5ish for a 80mm 10mm shoulder bolt (cause the ones from sickboards have a 70mm axel)

So from sickboards all in they are Â£188.30

I'd order from SR, they come out less expensive, you can choose custom colours for hangars, seats and bases and you can get them custom engraved. Seems like a no brainer if you have someone in the US that can order them for you and forward them on.

Wait theres stupid charges when you order from Sickboards? And the axle I can just get from any store here. Yes but importing in EU?

For bearings and spacers check out @mmaner 's great post here:

We ended up ordering 10.02 allu spacers locally but the bearings came from fasteddy. Still the best option.

Ben's right, just checked my last order from sickboards. No taxes but still an import administration fee of Â£8.

There's really not much in it, order from SR I think.

Isnt it $120 for the trucks $35 ish for postage
Lets pretend the import charge isnt as high and say another $30 for fees and duties

Yeah about the same i guess

I don't think so. I have a couple of sets now and their complete lack of communication isn't reassuring. Have you had better luck?

Honestly I think I'm just going to order some from sickboards for Â£150.

https://www.sickboards.nl/en/precision-trucks/4787-surf-rodz-tkp-hex-10mm-177-truck-kit-set-of-2.html#/866-color-black_blue

Short axles but I'll grab some 80mm shoulder bolts and I've got enough spacers here for 4 sets of trucks.

If you email them they will honor the same deal. They did for me when they offered spring discount for me and didnâ€™t get back to me after several emails over a few weeks. 

I just donâ€™t get why they donâ€™t get back to you in a timely manner.

I sent them back a damaged hanger for replacement almost a month ago. 7 emails later and I still haven't heard anything or gotten my replacement back.


*just checked my email

I mailed them in September and then again in the beginning of October with an order. Money waiting $450 order - following their guidelines for international ordering. 

They just didn't respond ðŸ˜‚ I even followed it up and asked them again to take my money but they just don't seem keen!

Why do these established skate brands just not want to sell products? Blows my miiiiiiiind

How many sets did you want to order?!

You know what will be easier, getting someone in the US to forward them and we are all happy :D

Sickboards or if you have a US postal address service, they are pretty impossible to get by mail, tries and failed too

Hey mate, I'm in touch with Surfrodz.EU since some weeks now, and I got a good coupon for esk8er too (let me check my email and edit it).
Problem is they don't do Hex anymore only Grindz series now.
But you could buy a Hex hanger 10mm (around -20â‚¬) on sickboard...

**10OFFESK8**

This gives a 10% discount on anything in the EU store : [http://www.surf-rodz.eu](http://www.surf-rodz.eu/)

Also,
> In case of group buys (5+ sets) we can also potentially add some goodies or some extra % to the discount

:D hope you enjoy it guys !

Probably easily do a group buy, and then get hangers from sickboards.

Yes, if there is enough interest, I could be in the future one.

The good think they could make me a split set of 177 and 159mm for the rear (for the Mad hub - want a little cruiser on tkp) with specific color for 137â‚¬ shipped at home... but only grindz (What sounds easier for the customisation of the hanger) so I don't know if I could wait or not :smile:
I want this little easy cruiser asap !!
