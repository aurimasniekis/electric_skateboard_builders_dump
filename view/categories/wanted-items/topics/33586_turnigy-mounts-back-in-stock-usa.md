Did anyone else get a stock alert email for the turnigy motors mounts? 

I got the email, but I went on their site to buy some less than an hour after getting the email and it says they are back ordered :/..... Did anyone get any or was it a mistake?

EDIT 9/22: MOUNT AND NOW BACK IN STOCK, USA WAREHOUSE!
