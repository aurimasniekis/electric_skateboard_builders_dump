I am looking to replace the bearings in my TB6355 motors. I took out the old bearings and it looks like they use an NSK 698Z Bearing at the top and 2x NMB L-1680HH (688) bearings on the bottom. 

I would like to replace these bearings with some of equal or greater quality so I don't get yeeted while going down a hill. The problem is that I cannot find anyone selling these bearings in small quantities at a reasonable price. 

Thanks!

You donâ€™t have any local shops that sell bearings? Most of them can order any model

@kylepls eBay would probably be your best bet.

I have replaced them once per motor after about 1000 miles. Got sealed ones from Amazon. Just specify the Id, od and thickness. Have done 300 on new ones.
