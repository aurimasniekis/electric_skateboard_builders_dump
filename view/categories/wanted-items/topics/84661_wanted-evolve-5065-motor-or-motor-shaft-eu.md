Hi a mate has just bought a brand new evolve gt carbon off flea bay and 100k later the motor shaft has snapped where the circlip fits. 
Evolve won’t honour the warranty so he needs a cheap fix. 
Does anyone have an old motor or just the shaft? EU....

Really We are preparing to dump all our evolve stock and upgrade parts. We have decided to move out of the evolve upgrades and focus on eMTB products. 
So we will soon have 2 complete evolve boards (CGT) and a Bamboo GTX fully converted to focbox or unity and upgraded batteries for sale

starting next week all evolve stock is %40 off and I will post both conversions CGT and GTX on the forum as well.
We just got back into Town and have been put behind on a lot of things

Thanks for that... I’ve just spoken with the guy and apparently after a lot of emails, evolve have decided to honour the warranty on this board.
