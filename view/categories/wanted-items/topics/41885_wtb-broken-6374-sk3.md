yo guys what's up. I have a sk3 149kv 6374 motor. one of the magnets broke in half and it's a huge pain in the ass trying to source one.  If you have a broken 6374 motor i'm looking to buy it to take a magnet out and replace the broken one in my motor. Send me your offers!

(thanks for switching that @Namasaki)

If you find a broken motor I would just swap the whole can

that's... a lot smarter. ok.

i kinda assumed any broken motors would be breaking in the can area though. I'll take anything i can get really, i want to have a spare motor/second board (idk yet)

Shorted, burned motors are what you need to be looking for

I have a SK3 6374 149kV that has a broken winding. Still works fine though. It has a silicone wire mod with 5mm bullets and dual flatspots 

I bought a new one from HK and would be happy to get rid of this one!

A lot of cheaper motors use multiple smaller wires in parallel, so if one of the windings is cut it still probably has 5 or so more in parallel.
