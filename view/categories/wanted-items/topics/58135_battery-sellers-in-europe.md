Hi! 
I ordered a battery from eskating.eu a couple of weeks ago and has now decided to do a refund on the battery (they have a lot to do right now, other parts are still being shipped, great service!). I would like a complete pack with bms and 30q or sanyo cells. esk8.de had them until this morning I think, I was simply too slow...
So, are there any other battery vendors out there, or someone that can build a battery for me? 

Thank you in advance!
