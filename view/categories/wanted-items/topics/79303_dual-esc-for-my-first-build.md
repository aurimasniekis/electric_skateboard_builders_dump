Hi! I'm looking for any dual esc (like a focbox unity esc, or a flipsky dual fsesc). Let me know if you have one for sale.

Would the Winboard dual ESC interest you with a Boosted style remote?

Not sure, I'm thinking of going for a 12s battery and dont think this would be able to handle that? Think that focbox will be the way to go for me...
