-Like the title says I am looking for pulley and gears 15mm would be good. 40/15 or 36/16 gearing would be good as well.

-Motor pulley with Keyway.

-Metal preferred but will be cool with ABS as well.

**Also if there is an enertion style gear with the ability to have a bearing in the pulley that would be great.**



Thanks for your time

I have 2 with 8mm bore and only 1 with 10mm bore. 36€ for the pulleys. Shipping is 19,5€ with DHL. 
I think the shipping kills it. There should be better options in the US.

Dude just saying but it's cheaper for him to buy them separately from you than it is to buy them all together. It's 34€ if they are separate and then together it's 36€. And btw you can probs buy those aluminium ones on eBay for about 3€

There must be a good source in the US. Usually you can buy everything 50% cheaper than we here in Europe. But if you really do not find something cheaper (I hope you do), I will send them to you. Also for 34€ + shipping.
