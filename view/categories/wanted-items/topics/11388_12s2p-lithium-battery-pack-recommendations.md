I'm looking fo a li ion 12s2p battery pack with a built in bms. I don't know much about batteries but I've read on a few of these threads that li ion are safer than li po. I need something that I can just plug and charge without having to worry about the battery over charging. Does anyone have any recommendations?

What cells does it use? 

Bara's has Samsung 25Rs.

So they're not samsung, but you get what you pay for. If you have the dough, get bara's. I don't have the money for his though.

I have MEB's stealth battery and it's great. I haven't had any issues with the ~50 miles that I've put on it thus far... I guess 50 miles isn't enough to gauge how it'll do in the long run. Regardless, it's quite nice!

How does it compare to the strength of 2x 6s 5000 mAh Lipo's?

Strength = range or speed? Speed is your typical 12s speeds depending on your gearing. I get ~26-27mph on my 190kv and 15/36 gearing on 83mm wheels with my stealth battery. I'm not a very heavy guy though, weighing in at 115 lbs (52kg).

Range - I went for a leisure cruise that was somewhere between 7-8 miles and I still had ~35% on the battery. Plug and play functionality works as expected. The pack that I received was labeled "3000mAh" which I'm guessing is per cell so I'm guessing the whole pack itself is 6000mAh since it's 2p.

Thanks, I'm just gonna be using it to get around a pretty compact campus. So that range should be fine for me.

How would you charge such a large battery?
