Hello people
I just made contact to a seller from China. I want to buy Maytech 6374 closed motors. see link below:

https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-dustproof-6374-motor-12s-with_60561191541.html?spm=a2700.8443308.0.0.EasWlQ

right now I'm just asking how many people would be interested in a group buy?

I got contact to a very kind person, and maybe if I can order a right quantity they are willing to give a good price.

So if anyone is interested, write on me and let us see how far we can get.

By the way, sorry for my not perfect English, I live in Hungary.

@Steve-81 group buys are only allowed to be formed by L3 members. You haven't been a part of the forum long enough to execute on of these yet. If you like, you can contact an L3 member and share the contact information to order these in a GB.
