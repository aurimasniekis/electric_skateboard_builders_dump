Hello everyone, looking for a dual fvesc 4.20 plus (with the antispark) for my next build.
I'm don't have that much of a budget so lower the better, used or not as long as it works :man_shrugging: 

Also, I'm looking for a drop down deck that can fit pneumatic (5/6 inchs or 145mm to 152mm for non retards unit), without riser (or a small one) : if you have a good and cheap deck lying around, or recommendations (I discovered skateshop24 few days ago thanks to one of you), it would be perfect !

Well, that's it for now folks !

J'ai deja acheter les deux du forum de toute façon. Mais il me l'a vendu en m'envoyant des tests et il n'a eu aucun problème jusqu'à 40A en 10S.
