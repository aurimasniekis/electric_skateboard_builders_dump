@ARetardedPillow @Jinra pls make sure an L3 member manages the GB if you decide to do one. @Jinra you could do it if interested.

True but they don't fail often and charge faster most of the time.

@treenutter how do we go about in contacing a L3? I think we have enough interest to greenlight a US BMS GB

I don't see any movements so I'm looking for a partner to order this BMS. Two other people max. I want to keep this small because I am not a level 3, nor am I comfotable holding 10 orders worth of money. 

I live in the Northeastern part of the United States working on a esk8 project myself. If you are interested please PM me. I will update with the cutoff when I find 2 other people. I will be utilizing PayPal and UPS to deliver due to the store being the closest. Hopefully I'm not breaking any community rules, if I am please let me know ASAP.
