Thats a not enough of information. Speed depends also on motor KV and battery voltage. But You could try this one - [BG](http://www.banggood.com/Wireless-Electric-Skateboard-Accessories-Belt-Motor-Pulley-For-7270MM-Wheel-p-1112896.html?rmmds=search), but I recommend to read more.

Print the wheel pulley from this source:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/abec-11-flywheels-clones-34-36-38-40-42-44-48-50-tooth-pulley-stl-files-for-9mm-12mm-and-15mm-belts/7642
and file it down to fit your wheels and drill through your wheels.

Get a aluminium or steel wheel pulley for about 15 Euro somewhere.

And google for a suiting belt, i just ordered a 15mm HTD 5 255mm for 12 Euros incl shipping from http://www.hug-technik.com/shop/product_info.php?info=p5540_zahnriemen-htd-5m-laenge--255---15mm-breit----255-5m-15mm.html
