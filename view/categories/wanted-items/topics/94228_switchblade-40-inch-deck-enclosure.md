Hi all,

So i have a LandYachtz Switchblade 40 inch deck, and would like an enclosure for it which fits at least 12S4P.

I have looked online but cannot find any, do you guys know where i can get one?

Thanks

Join the club. @Eboosted is willing to make it but we need to have at least 3.

I am willing to buy from him if he makes it.

I believe the 9to5 deck is similar to switchblade, maybe that enclosure fits?

@psychotiller think Evo or altar wedge might work.

Ok guys, I'll do a custom enclosure for all you. 

Just placed the order for a 2019 Switchblade 40"

Would you like to make any requests on the enclosure?

I'll make a 12s4p for 21700 cells or a 12s5p for 18650s if there is enough space. 

Maybe a switchblade design

How many do you plan on making for the 40" Switchblade?
I may switch my deck on my upcoming build to one if your enclosure is fitted for it :slight_smile:
Also, how much could we expect to pay for such enclosures?

Although I agree that the 38" version is pretty much the perfect size for a board, 40" means more battery space and longer wheelbase for more stability.

Shame that the wheel cutouts aren't big enough relative to the truck mounting position for big wheels in drop through setup. Works well with supercarve trucks though, here's a build I'll share to inspire those ordering their enclosure:

I rather have a 12s4p made of 30T braking force and torque are insane at those current levels on these 21700 cells

I'm in for an enclosure as well. Just bought my deck from https://longboard.ro/shop/, they have a Landyachtz sale at the moment, much cheaper than from Sickboards + I got the old version of the deck with the sides colored white :sunglasses:
