I tried going drop through with GT trucks on a gen 2 carbon deck and the motors touch the kick tail. Maybe you ment the Carbon GT deck?

thank you :) inspiration is thanks to many including @ricardo and his Evolvenstein build, here:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/evolvenstein-carbon-gen2-enertion-focboxes-maytech-motors-unik-mounts-trampa-wheels-photon-remote/79866

I looked at this build and realized I had almost everything needed to build our own, and as a bonus, I think it will fit this humungous battery that @Chase sold me :) as we upgrade the Trampa Orrsum to 13S4P

so I bought this;

do heart supporting this community, in the small ways I can.  thanks guys!

This might be worth a shot. Not sure if the trucks are the ones you are after. Or if trucks are even for sale. Might be worth to ask though

Glad you took some inspiration from my build. As a word of caution, I'd have to say that fitting a 10s7p setup was a bit of a challenge, and if is was today I probably would have stuck with a 10s6p, making the enclosure less congested and giving me more space for a Metr module. 

Also, I used two FOCboxes, which I had to shave corners from them to fit; maybe with a Unity you won't have that problem.

Let me know if you need any advice, or detailed parts list.
