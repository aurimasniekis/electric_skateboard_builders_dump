Hi there,

I'm looking for a few custom batteries to be built for me by an experienced builder, I live in Switzerland but I guess it could be sent from any place in Europe without any problems) I thought that getting all the 100+ cells will be easier to one person then me sending them to many! 

Thanks in advance!

Hi, can you tell more about your needs ? Which range / which cells models / what max power you want ? Want spot-welded, want solderless ? What are you putting the batteries in ?

So I was thinking about getting 100 Sony Konion 3120 30A cells to have made:

1 - 10s2p battery in a custom shape with a BMS and LED indicators for voltage
Perhaps 1 - 10s1p with small BMS and LED's like inboard battery
These are for electric skateboards and I would like to get them spot-welded! Btw 18650

This might change but for now thats what I want)

Thanks for the reply!

You can look for services repairing/refurbishing cordless tools batteries, generally they are able to build a battery for a good price. They are even working with the same li ion cells as the most common builds. 
Still you may have to source by yourself the electric switch and the bms (if they don't offer or you want a cheaper one).
