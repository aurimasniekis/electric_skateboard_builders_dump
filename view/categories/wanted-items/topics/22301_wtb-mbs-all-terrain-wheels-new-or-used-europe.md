I'm alternatively interersted in 90mm+ flyweels and generally all wheels with the same mount/spokes because I want to test several products I'm working on with them

These are the cheapest I have found. Comes WITHOUT bearings.
I am also in Europe, and got mine after a week. They ship with FedEx express, or something like that.:slight_smile:

Not much, I am a first time builder, and these are my first wheels. 

Quality:
They look alright, although the ones I got have small air bubbles (only one or two in a wheel, and they are only visible from the back of the wheel)

Durability:
My board isn't finished, so they were never used. Can't tell much about durability.

Mounts:
I am using enertion's mount. It fits really nice.

If you want, I can send some pictures about them.

When's your 125mm urethans wheels going to be ready @trampa? I'm looking at those as a potential alternative to 150mm pneumatics for commuting.
