With enertion being a little busy with making their VESCs, my order will be a while until it comes in. However I wanted to play with the  VESC soon for a custom controller I want to make.

I feel like replacing a fried drv is within my capabilities and was wondering if anyone was willing to sell their broken VESC they don't use?
