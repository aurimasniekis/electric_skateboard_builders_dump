Looking for the BMS also,  just got off the chat with support, they have no idea and could not help me.  Just said to use any charge only BMS.

It wont power up, the LCD comes on when charger is plugged in but doesn't work other than that.  I would like to put in back in the spacecell so asked for the same size.  I checked the balance wires and all were reading voltage.  checked output from battery and read 32v so I deducted it was the BMS. 

Anyone recognize the BMS
