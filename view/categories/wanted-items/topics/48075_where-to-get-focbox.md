Anyone know where I can get a FOCBOX, or someone that is selling one? Enertion said it is out of stock and will take until mid-May, but I need it sooner.

I have checked the vendors on the list and most of them are out of stock. Also, enertion’s website says they cannot ship to my country. Is there an issue with the supply of focboxes? Related to upcoming the “unity” I have been seeing lately?

Thanks, I try to stay away from your website because I may end up ordering a jet spud while I have 2 boards that I haven’t finished yet. :sweat_smile: that sale you just l did almost got me. 

Anyways, seeing that the other vendors don’t seem to have stock at the moment, I will probably end up coming back when I am ready to order.
