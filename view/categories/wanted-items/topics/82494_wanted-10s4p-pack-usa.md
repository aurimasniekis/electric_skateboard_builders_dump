I am sorry for so many posts. The other posts both got removed because I accidentally double posted. 3rd Times a charm.

Anyways, I am looking for a 10s4p pack for my Evolve BGT. I would be willing to trade my stock pack and pay extra or buy one used or new. I cannot afford a 350$ service fee plus shipping so I would love to buy one from someone that already has one. I will pay shipping and can provide BMS if anyone will build one at a reasonable cost. Shipping to and from Tennessee, USA. Thanks a ton and sorry again for the posting difficulties.

I wish knew of some advice to give you, but there are only a couple of people that do this.  @longhairedboy is dependable and stands behind everything he does, $350 is actually a great price.
