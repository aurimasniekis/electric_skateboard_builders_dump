Hi Guys,

I was looking for a used Loaded Vanguard in reasonable condition, but they seem to be as rare as hens teeth in Australia, so I'm looking more mainstream.

If anyone has a broken or damaged boosted board that they want to offload, send me a PM.

Happy to cover shipping costs to Australia for the right board.

Thanks
