I do not have one to offer but maybe the community has one. So I will ask this.

Your charge cable is one of these, correct?

So that looks like a 5.5mm (outer diameter) x 2.5mm (inner diameter) barrel plug, which could be a problem, I think my 10s chargers are 5.5mm x 2.1mm. Can you send a pic of your charge port?
