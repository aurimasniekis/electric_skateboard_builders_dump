Hey dexter do your pullies require hacking the hanger? Is there a bearing? Do they come with hardware?

No bearing, no need to hack the hanger. They come with hardware. It's available now.

Caliber's they fit perfect but Caliber clone trucks they seem to need to want to be shaved "corners" maybe about 1mm or so.

Not very. It likely depends on what material you use but mine lasted about 75 miles of city riding (some pretty rough roads) in LA (read: hot).

If you've got glass roads and live somewhere it doesnt get so hot your mileage will vary.

That's not true.  I've been using the same set of PETG pulleys and I've done at least 150km which more than 75miles and they are still very much usable.  No significant sign of wear.  But I keep my belts tight, no slack at all.  That also helps keep them in good shape.

Plastic really isnt a long term solution.

Yes,  I agree but Nylon is. SLS Nylon prints are one piece prints,  there's no layers. Maybe not exactly the same process as injection molded but the strength and wear characteristics are similar.  You go that added benefit of chosing a more custom drive train set up if you go this route.  

@longhairedboy just came out with his set of SLS Nylon pulleys for flywheels and clones that are nylon just like enertion ones but you get a much greater selection of teeth and belt width options.
