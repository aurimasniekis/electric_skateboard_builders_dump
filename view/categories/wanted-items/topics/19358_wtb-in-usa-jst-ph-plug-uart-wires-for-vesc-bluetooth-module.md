**WANT:**  7-pin JST-PH plug with 4 pre-crimped wires

**COST:**  Will pay for shipping plus a few $$ for your time

Looking for a 7-pin (or 6-pin) JSH-PH plug for connecting a Bluetooth module to the VESC's UART port.  I don't have the proper crimping tools at the moment, so I was hoping to find one with wires pre-connected to the RX, TX, VCC, and GND pins

**Note:** JST-PH is NOT the same as the 6S balance connector on your lipos (that is JST-XH, which is larger than PH). I already made this mistake; hence why I need a connector :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

you can get it from digikey, flat rate on shipping and you'll get it next day (8 bucks a believe) (sorry flat rate is only to canada)

Thanks! I actually already searched Digikey and other sources.  But paying that much for a 15Â¢ connector ruins the point of making it yourself.  They want $7.40 for shipping, which is many times more than the cost of the product.  At that point it would have been better to buy a pre-made VESC BT module

Do you still have spares? I am making mine and only just realized the jst balance connector is not the same as the vesc!
