As the title suggests I want to buy a hummie deck (single cutout) if anyone has one, US would be preferred.

Trying to use the deck to house my 13s8p

Double cutout won't cut it for a 13s8p

My cells are gonna be layed out like this

Depends on the configuration of the battery.  It's my understanding that the Dual & single cut out share the same amount of space just split into two portions.

If your battery isn't built yet it's probably going to be easier to change your configuration than it is to find a single cut out for sale.

You can definitely fit a 13s8p in the dual....

Look how @Winfly did his
 https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words/2992/8793?u=skunk
You could take a router and cut out the spine where the unity goes or cut out the whole spine and do a layer of carbon fiber to stiffen it up.

That's a 13s4p..... so double stack and it fits...

That's just mock up.  His setup was clean as f**k by the end

I'm just trying to help you. you said it wouldn't work and it absolutely would work you just don't want to do what it takes.
I think you have a better chance of finding a dual cut out is all.
Or you can wait a few months for them to do another batch a fresh ones.

Then you could fit a unity in with no problem

13s5p or 6p

Total length of pack winfly way = 18mm x 26 cells wide = 468mm


Total length of my pack = 65mm x 7 cells long = 455mm

I forgot how much I routed out of mine to get this width on the single cut out deck. But this is going to be. 10s6p or 7p?

If you route out the center channel of a double cutout deck would you be able to lay batteries out the way you want?

The only way i uave managed to go past 35 with 0 wobbles is by carving with WFB bushings (95.5a and 93a) been meaning to get a set of kranks but this setup has been solid for me at 45mph thus far
