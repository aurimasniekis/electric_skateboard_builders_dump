I was planning to build an electric trampa board but time is short and I'm a bit afraid it won't happen because of that. If someone is willing to sell their board please let me know.
I have 2 focbox, batteries, bms and remote, so a board without this parts can also be of interest. I weigh 90kg so a bit stiffer deck is preferable.
PM.

I'm aware of that. I was just wondering if someone is selling a used one for cheaper price. 
Thanks anyway.
