Hello eSk8, 
I am building an electric longboard for a senior design project and my BMS D140 will not ship in time thanks to the Corona virus.  China has locked exports of many factories.  I need a BMS as soon as possible.  Does anyone have one for sale?  My backup plan was this,

But I can't get a hold of the seller.  
Thank you in advance!
