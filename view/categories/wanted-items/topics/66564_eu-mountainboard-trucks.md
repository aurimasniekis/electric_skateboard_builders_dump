Hey guys,
I'm getting some second hand parts together and the only thing I still need for now is a set of trampa trucks (looking for these ones because I can get the rest of the drive train very cheap)

Hit me up if you have anything lying around
Cheers!

So, the deal with the motor mounts and the rest fell through, so now looking at any mountainboard trucks!

If you're short on money, freebord makes wider trucks than longboard. You need a longboard base still, but it might be cheaper
