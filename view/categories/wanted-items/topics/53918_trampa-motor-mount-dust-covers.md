Black material 

Must be very strong so it does not brake.

I can send you the files and some other info u can look at and please let me know how much you would charge me to make 2 + shipping to me and how long  would it take until I received them ?
 
I can't seem to upload them to you here (unsupported format) so would need your email address to send them to ya.

I really don't know anything about  3d printing or material they use . But my colour scheme on my board is red so that might look nice . 

If you make it out of that material will it be strong and suitable for the application?

Can you send me your email so I can send you the files ?

It tells you what material they use .

Thanks so much dude
