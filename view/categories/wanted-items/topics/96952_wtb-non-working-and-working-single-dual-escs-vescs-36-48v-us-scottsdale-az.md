Looking to buy some ESCs, working or non working, preferably hub motor versions. If non-working, would prefer it hasn't been tinkered with so I can salvage parts. I have a bunch of enclosure designs I'm fiddling with so want to test out different layouts, boards etc so I need multiple.

What I had in mind was the Chinese ESCs (HobbySky?) that a lot of the mass market boards use or something similar. Let me know what you have and a price. Feel free to DM me with pictures as well. Thanks!
