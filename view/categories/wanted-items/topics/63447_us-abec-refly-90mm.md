Hi builders!

I’m looking for the Abec 11 Refly Black 90mm

Do you have 4 of them to sell or do you know where I can buy them? 

Most of the online stores don’t have them or are weeks away from delivery :frowning:

Thx

Trampa stickies are in stock in black I think. The black ones are 76a duro so quite soft. A bit on the pricey side but I rode a set for a while and i have no complaints what so ever.

Seems that the blue one are in stock as well. I wonder how they compare to the Abec 11 refly. 

I was thinking that another option is to get the @JLabs ones that are 75a (IIRC) but I don’t know how well they perform.

I dont really know how they compare to abec11 reflies but they are good wheels IMHO. Maybe @trampa could tell you a bit about them.

I ordered the wheels from @JLabs for a 78a and ~30$ IMHO they’re a steal, and the reviews are good!!!

If you need them for a client, I do have a set I"d reluctantly part with to help The Cause.

(yet seriously and from a die-hard ABEC guy, +1 to the BKB wheels @Mikenopolis @DAddYE  @blitz are on the money; BKB wheels work perfectly. 

One of the complete esk8s I bought out here has BKB parts and, long story short, BKB is still on that particular board - which is why these ABEC 90s are still new and I guess avail :) 

hope this helps!

Are the Re Flyes reflex formula the same as the cobranded Evolve Abec 11? Or they had a new formula?

Not particularly happy about their reflex formula.

The green Superfly 107mm are holding pretty good though

it might be entirely in my head, and please correct me if I'm mistaken:

* I think Evolve wheels feel like 'remixed' ABECs, and,
* I have a feeling this years' ABECs aren't exactly same as the greens from a couple of years ago.

This is probably in my head, I know.  I've weighed both the ABEC and Evolves and they're more or less the same, idk.  

Yet I own ABECs from 2016 that feel literally, perfect after all this time.  They feel dense and solid and they've never cracked.

Evolve wheels have always felt a little softer to me and the inner rim will tear when it finds a sharp rock under torque. 

Again, might be totally in my head. :crazy_face: hope this helps my friend
