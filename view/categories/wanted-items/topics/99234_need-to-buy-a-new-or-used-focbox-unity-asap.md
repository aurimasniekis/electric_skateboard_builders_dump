Does anyone have a new or like new condition FOCBOX UNITY for sale? 

The lead time  from Enertion Boards is currently 6 - 8 weeks and I can't get back to riding until I get a new FOCBOX UNITY.

Please email me at: petdetective4hire@gmail.com or send me a message on the esk8.builders website. 

Thank You very much.
