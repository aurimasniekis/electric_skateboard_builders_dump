Hello, figured I would ask here. Looking for a nano thumb remote like the ones above. One of them is busted, the trigger gets stuck, which caused me to accelerate and fall down...

I see then sometime listed for cheaper, and I really dont want to dish out $60 from DIYElectricSkateboards.

And it should automatically connect to my board since they have the same receiver cuz I'm not looking to open it up and bind it as one of these works for both of my boards.

Thanks!

Nope your wrong, haha once paired to one remote and you want to use another remote youll have to repair to that other remote, theres no way around it lol.

Moral of the story, you'll have to open up your board no matter what :smiling_imp:

I‚Äôm sorry to say it but you‚Äôre wrong.   As long as he buys the same remote There will be no need for him to open up his board!   Receivers are pretty much universal and will pair up with any remote witch signal is within range

@FranciscoV sorry but your wrong hehe :sweat_smile: these remotes are designed to not intercept each other 2.4ghz signal by accident imagine, this I have the same remote and receiver as my friend and i hyjack his signal because im closer to him lol (and i throttle and in reality his board throttles up)

winning built a failsafe aganist this


i have two of the same remotes lol and they dont work with each others recivers lol.

Really!?   Wonder why!   That‚Äôs the reason many people have gotten hurt due to their board pairing to someone else‚Äôs remotes at the beginning of the ride   That‚Äôs why is always a good idea to double check

You only need to open the board if the remote you use has to have a bind plug on the receiver to pair.  Otherwise you should be fine.
As far as I'm aware the nano does not need a bind plug.

They all have a bind plug.... You short two pins out, that's why I said you have to open your board up

I have 4 different rc remotes in a drawer down stairs that do in fact auto bind.  I can't say for certain that the nano does this because I took it out of the board as soon as I rode it once because its a nasty little bitch

Hoyt puck is better and than the modded gt2b on top of that

The gt2b is long range and long travel perfect for those people who are too scared to push the throttle

I will not have that blasphemy discussed further.  To quote @brenternet

 The only good mode for a nano is bin mode.

Or my modded version that I still haven't uploaded the files for lol. Still need to figure out a simple way to have brake working without the pressing the Deadman switch.

 I just borrowed the channel 2 button and added 2 resistors for the deadman switch, and upgraded to a bigger battery. everything else came from the Nano remote.
