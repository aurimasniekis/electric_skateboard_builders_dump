Iâ€™ve got a whole bunch of sizes. Iâ€™ll check when I get home to see if I have that size or not.

That's some large heatshrink. I use 100mm heatshrink for 18650's and it fits nicely.

180 fits both flat packed spacer-less 4P, spacer packed 4P,  and triangle packed spacer-less 5P. Its a versatile size. 

edit: that's complete packs, and would also include similar stacking of any length, not just 4 or 5P.
