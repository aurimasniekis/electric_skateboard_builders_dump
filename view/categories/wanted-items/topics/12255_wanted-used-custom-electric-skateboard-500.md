Hey again guys. My "rental" post idea was a FAIL, take 2..

Looking for a used electric skateboard in good working condition for commuting tests and time comparisons in Denver. My budget is $500. I don't care about the aesthetics or scratches, or used batteries (so long as I can get 7 miles). Your board will be live streamed on periscope and I will talk about the forum and the builder as I ride it around Colorado. I'm 125lbs 5'8" so single drive should be fine.

Thanks in advance!

I dont have a board available.. but are you ready to do some minor repairs and/or major redesigns? Make sure youre buying from a reputable builder.

That's looks like its worth a LOT more than $600, definitely a steal at that price.
