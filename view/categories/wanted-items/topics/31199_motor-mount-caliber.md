Ok well how much is it? I am running a 6374 motor so as long as it will fit with that I'd be happy to buy one. Also angle is adjustable I assume?

To answer both you guys, mine will be $40 per pair. That includes a 12mm wide 320/325mm belt, fasteners, and the idler. It is angle adjustable. Doesn't include shipping, $5 USA, $15 international. It fits all motors that I know of thanks to the cross design instead of fixed slots.

Due to the nature of the esk8 market, I don't want to promise a deadline so quick. I have just about everything ordered and ready, I would say a max of 2 weeks before you can order them.

$15 for Canada. I know shipping is a sore spot but I am limited to their prices, I don't mark up shipping. It's $15 whether it's 1 or 2 mounts. For more than 2, I give an upgrade to priority international which is a bit quicker at no additional cost.

 That's all good. It has been a pain throughout this build so far HAHA. Just solidifies my want to buy 2.
