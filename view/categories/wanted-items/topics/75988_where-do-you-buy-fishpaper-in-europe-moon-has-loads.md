I only have some [Alibaba](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20181125100743&SearchText=1m+65mm%2F80mm%2F100MM+18650+Li-ion+Battery+Insulation) China sources, [Banggood](https://eu.banggood.com/Wholesale-Warehouse-8Pcs-DIY-Red-Fish-Adhesive-Paper-For-Electrical-18650-Battery-Insulating-Cover-wp-Eu-1124133.html?rmmds=search) and [Nkon](https://eu.nkon.nl/accessories/heat-shrinks-insulation-paper/isolatie-papier-blank.html) are out of stock... but I don't like using Chinese stuff for things that can go up in :fire:. Please give me suggestions for trustworthy sellers! I don't care about shipping time because I am still waiting for Hummie-Hubs.

Do I have to order from the USA for real Fish-Paper? [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/battery-pack-thread-share-your-tips-tricks-fails-etc/64225/7)

I have some fishpaper, I can send it to anyone who needs them for the cost of some shipping and a little extra if you feel generous.

I can appreciate the banana for scale. Now I know exactly how long and wide your sheet of fishpaper is.

I think I heard from 10square meter you get a mini banana for free
from 20square meter the big one is included. Optional you can get the banana wrapped in fishpaper, but that would be plus 10%
