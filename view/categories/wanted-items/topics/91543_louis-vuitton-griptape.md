@Sender can get it put on fabric for you and then epoxy it to the deck with glass frit on top.

Like some sort of fucking hero.

Not personally a fan but people swear by it. The grip isn't the issue for me it's the shiny surface.

Looks good. I wonder how durable it it compared to other colored griptape. Obviously glass frit would be the toughest.

Not the exact one you're looking for but they do have it - [LINK](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=582665846867)

But it's from Taobao so I'm not sure if you're able to get your hands on it :frowning:

You know I can do it with matte finish, I just prefer glossier most of the time.

There are quite a few choices of "custom" griptape on Aliexpress, way easier to order on that site (make sure to choose one of the paid option for shipping otherwise it'll take months to arrive. I think I've seen LV grip tape there at some point but can't find it anymore.

I have learned a lot since your deck. Now I sand down any sharp glass edges.  They will wear down naturally with use, but I just do it before final clear coat now.

@MannyM0E I recommend going the Sender route. If you like the feel of standard grip tape, go with FINE grit. The medium grit is a bit rough and I'm trying to get used to it still.

My wife has like 6 purses I could cut up and sew together if that helps :rofl:

new LV Chains drops in two hours; they’ll sell out within an hour or so.

edit: I stand corrected; Reign's business has grown quite a bit in the past year and they possess professional manufacturing, now - the only limit is what they set themselves.

Looking at their shirts, they tried to bring back Generra Hypercolor.. I bet that sounded a lot better on paper. :)

Each to their own but LV stuff just evokes a memory of a back street in Tunisia with a haggling salesman called Maliq who showed authenticity by holding a lighter to a purse and then offered me 3 camels for my wife.  Fun times.

@mmaner can we do this? Probably.

It is just about finding the image high res....

I mean it is possibly a little questionable but for a 1 off hobbyist piece, I doubt they will hunt us down.

Mike, what are your thoughts.

The funny thing about copyrights and trade marks is that they only protect the owner from commercial use. You can make all you want for yourself, or make a file that others can use to print it themselves. 😏

Oh boy, I have to hate on this, I know it's irony of a sort but 9/10 won't get that

can never understand wanting to promote branding, especially geebags like L.V.,  Burberry and the rest of them

https://maxcolson.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/louis-vuitton-its-journey-from-high-street-imitation-to-romance/

Are you sure you don't want o do a 'didas or 'Ike? Pepsi maybe? Or how about **your own thing**

fuck branding

I misunderstood what you were asking, no that isn't possible.

I essentially add another fabric layer to the deck. It isn't like griptape, it becomes part of the actual deck, and that's way cooler!

Sure it can.  I approach everything with the subtlety of half a house brick through a jewellers window while being ironic.  Its a talent.
