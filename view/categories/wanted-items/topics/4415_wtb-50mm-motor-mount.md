Hey, just wondering if anyone has a motor mount they want to get rid of. I was going to DIY one but since I'm hoping to use this for commuting i want something a little more reliable. 

Note: i do not have the money to buy one now, but my next paycheck is on the 15th. I just wanted to get this out before then so i can have something lined up. :slight_smile:

I know, i figured if someone had one they wanted to get rid of i could get it cheaper and help someone more directly. will probably go to DIY if none pop up.
