I'm in need of a raptor 2 front truck. Enertion support won't invoice me one. So if you got one I'll buy it. I really only need the hangar as I have the base plate already (axle snapped). Worst case I'll rock out with a front e-caliber if nobody has one. I'm located in the US.

That wasn't my question ðŸ˜œ

@CarlCollins tends to be helpful, if you haven't contacted him yet, you should because I'm pretty sure he can help you out, even if you didn't buy directly from them.

Yeah it's the sellers choice honestly. I'd like to think I'm not gonna be good at it and I'm gonna cry the entire time, But I mean if that's what they're into.... Also I can pay instead if they'd rather choose that option.

@ThermalChild
I am able to get a front truck assembly for you with the invoice
All you need to do is provide me with the following information (PM me)
Your board's Serial number: 
Your current address: 

But the best way to do it is under warranty 
You can ask the original owner to contact Enertion support for warranty and ownership transfer then we can handle it under warranty, what do you think?

Is no one going to ask how the axel broke? :thinking:

Unless it was discussed already....?

Would you be comfortable sharing it? :) 

I know it sounds silly but it might help someone notice their trucks are failing before they actually do - e.g. Diyeboard trucks and the stress fractures and lines that would sometimes appear before the truck failed, and I believe that someone on Reddit was able to notice their trucks were defective and fixed the issue before it became a problem :+1:

Sounds like he only has the drive train on a diy not an actual Raptor 2 but I may be wrong.

The axle broke because I did something stupid. I'm gonna follow up with Jansen. Thanks all.

It's a known issue. There's multiple reports on the .club site with people snapping their axles. Poor QC and cheap products is probably the culprit.

Poor QC

seems like a common issue with enertion, but only specific products :thinking:

He said he did something stupid though... that doesnâ€™t seem like a qc issue this time around

That's always a plus. It's good to hear. Still doesn't negate the fact that there are some serious QC issues with Enertion products. This isn't the 1st report of snapped axles on Enertion trucks.
