I would be fine to settle with hobby king mounts, but they are on back order (I still plan to order some)
I may just 3d print a mount for now while I wait, but I really want it made out of metal. Anyone selling motor mounts for cheap (Under $30 plus shipping) I live in SF.

Use the search function and also check the Esk8 Market.  You will find a few people selling mounts at different prices.
