Where do you live? If you live in Friesland I can help you out (if you weld the cells yourself).

awesome, will be one more spot-welder in NL

i'v checked with nkon.nl crew, they said they can spot-weld any configuration i want but they charge 1€ per battery :triumph:

so i thought why pay them if fellow members of esk8 community has one which is not in use currently

A Sunkko one from AliExpress. Ships from the UK, so I thought why not :)

Will use it as well for battery packs for my long range rc airplanes

I live in Amsterdam and already have my cells but it's impossible to find someone with a spot welder. Any updates on anyone near-ish me who has one? :slight_smile:
