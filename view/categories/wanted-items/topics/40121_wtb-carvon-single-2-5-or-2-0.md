Located in NYC. Planning my first build for a carbon penny deck and desperately want to avoid having to worry about pulleys and belts and gear ratios. Looking for any Carvon single drives I can use with my 90mm flywheels. Thanks!

There's a search function, someone not so long ago was selling 2 single carvon drives and someone else that was selling his single drive build I don't think both of them got sold
