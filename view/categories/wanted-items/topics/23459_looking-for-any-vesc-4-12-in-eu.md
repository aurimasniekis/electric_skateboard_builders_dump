If I'm going with @esk8 I'd rather wait until he releases his new ESK8 Controller :)

Any VESC will do for the moment...

I know Imade this thread because I was looking for a VESC. Mine has undergone repair by lp-electronics due to DRV Error. I've gotten a FOCBOX in the meantime and have an VESC for sale 4.12 from AXLE. Located in Germany :) hit me up if you need one.

Yes it's fully working. I was still using it for about a week before getting the Vesc-X / FOCBOX. As with all 4.12 Vescs I wouldn't recommend FOC. But it runs just fine in BLDC.Also have the invoice from the repair which cost me ~40€. I don't want to cut in between you and Dwain. So pm me if that deal doesn't go through. :)
