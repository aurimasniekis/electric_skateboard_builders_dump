Does anybody have a extra vesc and/or motor they would be willing to sell me?
They just need to be able to handle a 12s battery.

With 12s you need much lower kv motor. Like ~160kv.
Otherwise you going to break the 60000erpm limit. Or you could buy a vesc6

Whenever I look at the a motor like for example the 6355 190kv it will tell me the "max volts: 12s"
