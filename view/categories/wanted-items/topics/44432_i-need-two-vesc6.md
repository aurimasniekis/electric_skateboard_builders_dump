I need to buy two VESC6 clones. I can't afford two from trampa so have to go with clones. Who's selling, the stewii thread has stagnated a bit.

I might be willing to sell mine, they're from trampa's beta program but they're fully functional.

These are with nrf. I would add all pin headers, remove my 2.4 ghz receiver and ship them in this case if wanted 220$ for both. If they fail wich I doubt I'll fix them free of charge.

this is kinda off topic but here you go I think this information is still valid for vesc 6:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-vesc-user-read-this-complete-walktrough-of-the-vesc/2980

If you want proper brakes, I suspect you will need a better battery too. Don't know if the stock meepo battery can take much charging current...

What QC-testing is done? Is the NRF included with the PCB antenna? How does Warranty work? How do you support Ben Vedder in relation to sales?

I just received the pics of the aluminum case it'll be housed in, and I'm a bit confused as to its size.  This VESC on its own looks smaller than any of the other HW 6 VESC, but the case is like 100mm x 90mm or similar.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-vesc-from-china-seems-like-not-only-maytech-is-making-vescs-now/5207/227?u=uigiroux

Now one thing I am quite curious about is will you be making a dual VESC 6, or at least a dual case for this VESC?  I plan on running 2 VESC's, but if I was to go with this unit, it seems odd that I would have to have two power on/off switches...  Also, is there a way to mount the buttons on the enclosure so I don't have to open the enclosure to turn the system on?  Or could I simply just leave them in the 'on' position, and add a anti-spark on/off switch further up towards the battery like a normal setup, and when that is turned on or off, the VESC's, being left in the 'on' setting, would turn on or off automatically, when the other switch is turned on or off?
