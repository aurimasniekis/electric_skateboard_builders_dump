I know this is probably a long long long shot, anyone got the MBS travel bag available?

Or any other bags that can hold 35 degree deck and 8inch tires. Most importantly, water proof?

I have no idea if MBS ones are water proof, just trying my luck here.

Asked Frank, he said it's not water proof. Which is a big bummer for me.
