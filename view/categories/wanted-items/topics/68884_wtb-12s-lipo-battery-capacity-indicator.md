Title says it all, I'm looking for a lipo capacity indicator for a 12s pack, in the US. I can trade for some parts if need be!

There's a few on Amazon if you need something quick and stateside.

Otherwise AliExpress or Ebay for cheaper.

Yup, fast was why I was checking the forums! Don't know why I didn't check Amazon first.
