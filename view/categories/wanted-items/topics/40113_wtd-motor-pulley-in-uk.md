Hi guys, I've just had my order for a kegel pulley kit cancelled by diyelectricskatebaords and I have no idea why. I've emailed them so I'm waiting on a response.

Anyway, just thought I'd throw it out there: anyone in the UK have a motor pulley? Or a full pulley kit for Kegels? I'm after a HTD5M 15t or 16t with 8mm bore and grub screw(s).

I'm after anything now as this is the last piece in order to get my board up and running! Cheers!

Try ebay.co.uk . I m sure you can find it there and it will ship pretty fast if you live in UK

Thanks for all the suggestions guys.

I had looked everywhere including eBay and Belting Online but they either didn't have what I needed or required up to 3 weeks to machine what I needed.

Thanks to @egzplicit for the Street Wing suggestion, not sure how I missed them! Have ordered a 15mm pulley as they're out of stock of the 12mm. Should be OK though. Thanks!
