One of my Diyeboard motors is probably busted so I am looking for a used one to replace it with. Hit me up if you want to get rid of one :slight_smile:

Maybe you want to add which motor exactly it is?
Size and kV.

Good point, not sure though the diyeboard website is rubbish. Considering buying two new Turnigy SK3 6364 213 Kv motors instead

63 won't fit. It should be 5055 280kv.

Hello, I have a diyeboard with dual 5055 270kv belt drive kit for sale. I'll sell you the whole set with truck for 50euro if you want. It is collecting dust for the moment and I need some money for my mountainboard build. I am from Belgium EU by the way.

Everything you see on the Pic except for the wheels. I have their dual ESC but one Op the phase wires came loose and needs to be resoldered. Will send a pic later.

@sanderfu If the esc for these is something you can fix, this would be your cheapest route. Again though, if you want performance, think about going vesc with the above drive kit.

I am definetly considering upgradring to a vesc, the only thing holding me back is basically the tought of chasing bottlenecks until I have bought almost an entire board in new parts. It was a mistake going with a diyeboard kit I have realized. 

@mikedv about to PM you regarding your kit. Lets see if we can make a deal :slight_smile:

Dual 5055 motors can give you very good performance. The only upgrades I would make the the diyeboard kit would be a 30Q or SANYO battery and a VESC, unless you're going up extreme hills you can get good thermal and acceleration performance from those motors.

If your battery is par then disregard the last post. But do think about upgrading the battery in the future.

That drivetrain with a vesc would be a lot of fun. Depending on gearing, you could get good speeds as well. And I doubt you'd have to worry about major bottle necks as the kit's esc is the bottle neck.

Due to the expensive nature of buying from Europe to Norway, I am considering buying two 5045 or 5065 Racestar 200Kv motors and use the Diyeboard ESC until it wont work anymore and then upgrade to vescs. Does this sound reasonable @J0ker3366?

The only thing I am concerned about the sk8 is a lack of circlip... Not sure it is the case with 5045 motors but the 63mm have no circlip on the shaft.

And HK sk8 motors have no circlips. which mean you will have to order them somewhere else, pay for shipping, loose some time and probably money. The racerstars seemsbrather good from what I've read.

I honestly don't think your current esc and future motors are going to work @ all together. As I said before, that esc is programed for the motors that came with it. Most likely scenario, you plug everything up, hit the power to go and it coggs like a bitch and you pop the esc. Vesc should be @ the top of your upgrade list @ this point.

Agreed. Will test with my faulty Diyeboard ESC, take it for a spin and see how it goes and if it blows I will have no option but to upgrade ;)

You can always get some cheap Flipsky 4.2 vescs (think you can get them for less than 50Euros from Aliexpress) or the Turnigy sk8 vescs. I currentky use the Turnigy sk8 escs with FOC on 10S and it works like a charm. My Vescs settings are pretty conservative but i can reach +-45kmh without any problems and i have enough torque to do some offroad. +450km's and no issues yet.

I use the Maytech controller atm but i am planning ffor a firefly remote. It all depends of your budget. A fully assembled firefly remote costs about 130Euro or more , the maytech remote (which is rather ok) costs about 50Euro .   Or you also have the Photon remote which looks fuckin' awesome and the Hoyt puck remote seems to be great also.

2.4 mini remote hands down. And its more than a decent remote. Great price and reliable most everywhere. Though there has been mention of certain cities causing drops due to the rf congestion. Mini ftw

The esc needs one of the phase cable to be resoldered and it is the dual 1.1 esc from diyeboard. Unfortunately Someone already asked for the dual motors and battery ...

Plan for now (if noone have major issues with it):

I am buying two Racestar 5065 motors, new pulleys from @Boardnamics to do an asymmetrical setup on my 180mm Caliber II. For now I will not upgrade the esc, I will test the Diyeboard 2.1 Esc that I have and use it until it breaks but add a fuse so that a esc-fry wont harm the battery/board. Anyone have the length measures of @Boardnamics mounts with idlers? I am worried that the one facing my battery encosure wont fit.

Will update when upgrade is done :slight_smile:

I thought the diyeboard battery was the bottleneck?
So even if you upgrade to VESC's it wont be able to draw more current from the battery rated amps

If I remember well the diy battery is rated at 50A.so the batt max per vesc would be 25A.

I cannot do it right now because i am at work right now. I'll think about it when i am back home. The ESC is ok but you'll need to have some soldering skills to solder the phase wire again , i'll show you what i mean on the pics i'll send to you.
