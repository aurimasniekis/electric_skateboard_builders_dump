Ok thanks just a few questions, have you previously tried to repair these? Are there any other esc apart from maytech? And if so what is the damage to them? I am really only looking for drv faults or other small repairs


Edit: I don’t really want the maytechs too much as they most likely fail again after repair

I tried to unsolder a drv chip on one of the other VESCs but that's it. VESC 3 and 7 are from a different brand as far I can tell.

What sort of price are you looking for? And do you have any idea what is wrong with Vesc 3 and 7?

Not a bad deal but I only really need 2-3. I also don’t feel like investing that much into broken vescs that I don’t know what is wrong with them
