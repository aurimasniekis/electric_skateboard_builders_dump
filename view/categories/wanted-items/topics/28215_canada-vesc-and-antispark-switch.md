Wondering if anyone has both of these and can ship to Canada.
I will also be in new york in a month so can wait there if it saves me a ton.
I was hoping to grab it from axle but based on this forum it looks like they have been out of stock for a while and they don't have the anti spark switch

Ask @JohnnyMeduse, he is in the land of Hockey and Maple Syrup and sells VESC's...he might have Anti-Spark switches as well.
