Hub motors are scarce right now.  I've ordered a set from a company, but they have just ramped up so I don't know if they want it to be common knowledge right now.  Ill check and post back.  Both DIY & MEB sell hubs but I don't know anyone that has them.  You might ask around.  Links below...

thanks again. The thing is that i am pretty new in e skating topic so i really need like a complete set with everything except the deck. I mean battery, mainboard, remote, cover, wires, even screws etc. Don't really want to buy parts separately just in case something will not work with the rest of stuff. And i am not talking about mellow or eon. Just loose parts but definitely all of them (something like IKEA furniture). Anything like that in the market?

I would look at the E-Skate build category and find a board that you like.  Most of the builds will have a "shopping list" all you woul dhave to do is order the components and assemble, nothing really groundbreaking.

try buy trucks motor mount belts pullys wheels from one place then u will know it will work easy,
as far as batterys,esc,motors, u will have to do a bit of reading,you need to know how many miles and what speed u want to go then find out how and what you need,
