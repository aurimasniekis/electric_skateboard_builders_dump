Does anyone know of a group buy going on for the vesc 6.6 or a vesc 4.12 or a vesc 4.2? I am looking to buy a vesc and get it shipped to Canada and thought group buys would be way cheaper

I don't think he has any going right now. I messaged him and he said not for the next 3 days or so

3 days is pretty short for group buy prices. 
Sounds more like your looking to buy somthing in stock.

I was using an alien power systems EV esc and was trying to program it and when I plugged the power into the anti spark switch the last time it killed the esc and the spark switch somehow. Tested all the voltages and they were not showing anything on my esc at any point when it was connected to another power source. That's what I get for not taking my time I guess.

I think it's still in but basically if you Like Flipsky 's  Facebook page and message them, you will get a 20% discount. The code is already in the forum actually, check @Lumaci posts, he used it. So you will get basically the same price of a group buy. :wink:

I was surprised it rode quite easily and I'm looking to make it 2wd or 4wd in the future so it will be a rocket. It will go 60km/h right now on a flat surface. It's a 3500 watt motor

The board does weight close to 35 pounds tho. Looking to buy a smaller battery as well so I can bring it around town on shorter rides and be able to carry it
