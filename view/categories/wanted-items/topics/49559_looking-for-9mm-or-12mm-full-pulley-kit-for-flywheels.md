Hi @sub6ix where are you based?  @TarzanHBK can hook you up with wheel pulleys if in EU and @thisguyhere if you're in the US.  Or if you're in my neck of the woods (Oz) I can hook you up!

I am based in the US. I am wondering if the Enertion pulleys work on my 10‚Äù Caliber II trucks without me cutting away part of it. I have generic 83mm flywheels.
