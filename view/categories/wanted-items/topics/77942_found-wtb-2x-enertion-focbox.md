Before black friday the going price was 130ish for new.  You could probably get used ones for the price your looking for.  I think with the black friday price and shipping 2 focboxes came out to be $230.  So does your price include shipping?

Well, if nothing comes up I wouldnt mind shipping out my two focboxes that I have chilling at school :) 

One has sub 100 miles on it, and the other one hasnt even run a motor detection. Ive also got two @Kug3lis single focbox cases for it, one with all the gromets, and one without(I couldnt be bothered to fit them.... lol)

I would be shipping from Utica, upstate NY so I figure it wouldnt cost too much. If you would like, just let me know and Ill try and hunt down some antistatic packaging as well

e: the <100mi focbox has the case installed already, just to be clear

You've got me interested.

You guys do know that focboxes can ship from New York to California for just 3$ right? Via first class

wow thats great, but I figure its lacking some protection during transit. What can 3 dolars do at the post ofice :rofl:

if youre interested though, I go back up the 20th of January, I know its far away, but I can get a shipping quote then, as the local usps LOVES to fuck me over and misquote via the phone
