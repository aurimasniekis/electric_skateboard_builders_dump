I am in desperate needs for new wheels. Sadly abes are so expensive for me right now. 
Clones can be found for 25.- but shipping is expensive to europe. So if somone has some to sell or knows a cheap place in europe to buy them from let me know:)

Lol.  The last "red" ones I bought looks dirty pink or something too.  Oh well - found some on ebay and they are so cheap I'm gonna give it a try.  

Weirdly I have been liking the harder durometer of the clones lately.  Something about the way you can feel the pavement

I bought 97mm from him before, shipping to EU was reasonable considering the weight, I cant see the shipping now cause im in the US.

For the US there is an american store on Ebay that sells 97 in all colors, fast cheap shipping.

Yeah thats a decent price. 25.- is shipping tough. So then I am only off 35.- from abecs.

I've got orange flywheel clones from the EU group Buy. They are 90mm. Have driven them once. I'm located in Germany so shoot me a pm if you want them :) I'd also sell the pulley that I got with them.

I've talked to this guy earlier. A set is $20 and he'll ship 10 sets for $100 if you ask him.

I would also be interested in kegel and flywheel clones (83mm for now). I have searched if there is a cheap solution from Europe but couldn't find any reasonable offer shipping to Germany.

Need also to get some calibet truck clones which are good and cheap.

Still searching for a good source shipping for a low fee to Germany.

Greetings
Ron

So I would be interested in a groupbuy

It is!! I asked them once what they're discounting for bulk pricing: 
_Hi Roelof Mark,_
_ _
_We only have 9 sets (4 wheels per set) in stock now.  However for large orders like below we can add this to our supplier order which will be arriving in March/April._
_ _
_10-20 sets 15% discount off RRP_
_ _
_21-30 sets 25% discount off RRP_
_ _
_31+ sets â€“ 40% discount off RRP_

Meaning 65 pounds
with 10 sets 15% discount makes it 55,25 pounds per set

I think I would even get two/three sets.. So 10 Sets would be easy to exceed.

I have bought these orange 83mm flywheel clones:
http://s.aliexpress.com/iqa2IRVR 
Only 30â‚¬ with shipping included!
The seller is changing the price like every week, sometimes they are around 30â‚¬ and the other time around 45â‚¬ so just wait a few days until he changed his price, just like today ;)

oh nice! will check it out. I already found wheels. Left overs from a group buy, for a price thats almost a steal at 23 for a set of 4. But still need 93mm someday. ( and since my raptor broke down, other parts as well). So good to know that EU is living up in supplies :)
