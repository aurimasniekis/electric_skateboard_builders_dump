Does anyone have a spare motor sensor wire to VESC adapter laying around? I was going to buy one from DIY, but the shipping costs more than the actual product.

psychotiller.com has them too. Maybe the shipping is more reasonable. I would say message either one of them and ask about the shipping for such a small item maybe it can go in a first class envelope or similar.
