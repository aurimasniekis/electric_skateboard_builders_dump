Are you still looking for a deck? I have a [DB coreflex crossbow flex 2](https://dblongboards.com/performance-longboards) that I could sell you. It's very similar to a vanguard.

This is a common meepo/wowgo swap to get a more 'boosted' feel, might be a good option for wifey while keeping costs down? :)

Hey @joeadams101 I'm assuming this thread is done and over since you are not planning out the build anymore?
