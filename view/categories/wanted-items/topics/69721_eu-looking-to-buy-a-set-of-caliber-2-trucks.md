Looking for a pair for Caliber 2 trucks. I live in Norway and almost no sellers here distribute the Caliber 2 trucks here, would love to buy a pair from a fellow esk8-er if anyone has some laying around. Can be any colour. 

Also interested in buying just one if someone for some reason have a lonely truck laying around.

75 USD shipped to your address with import charges pre-paid and all.
If you add 10 USD you get a set of bones bearings.

I've heard that Caliber-II (second gen) has many improvements over the first gen,
 But that could just be marketing or maybe both. some improvement and some inflation of improvement.

I am waiting on a pair of SR trucks, mounts and six shooters from psychotiller.
As soon as they arrive I will list my Caliber II 50 trucks with eskating mounts, motor pulleys etc.
If you are interested and can wait 1-2 weeks let me know.

Bought from @dickyho here on the forum, they arirved today and are looking very promising!

Looks to be good quality for a fair price, but vant recommend until I have tested them (probably later in the autumn or next spring)
