As the title suggests I need 8 x 15t, 15mm, steel pulleys, 8mm bore, no shoulder, single or double flange, no keyway or grubs needed but it's ok if they are on there.

I've seen loads of aluminium ones for sale and eskating.eu can customize what I want but lead times are an issue.

If anyone has any or a link to where I can get them that would be great! Thank you.

I actually do have access to a lathe but I was hoping to just sit in my armchair watching baywatch and have someone post them through the door :smiley:

Do those just come with a pilot hole?

They have a conical marking, but no hole. I managed to drill them quite well going on 0.2mm steps 

But you are right, quite a lot of effort just for some pulleys

Beltingonline can do whatever machining is required and they are like 15 mins from my house but I swear the lady in customer services just cannot understand what I want. Am I being unclear here?

**15mm wide, 15t, HTD5M, 8mm bore, with flanges, without hub, without keyway, without grubs.**

She keeps asking if I want it 9mm wide, I'm so confused!

Could I ask why you need them to be without shoulders or flanges?
(I feel like you're on to something).

I have 2 unused 15T 15mm wide, 8mm bore no shoulder pulleys with double grub holes bought from eskating.eu  if you need them.
Got them to use on my psychotiller mounts but settled on 12mm.

Just ordered Jared, yours just work off the shelf. I'll exercise some patience - If you want to chuck some 44t pulleys into the package for the modular set you sent at christmas that would be cool :smirk: :face_with_hand_over_mouth:
