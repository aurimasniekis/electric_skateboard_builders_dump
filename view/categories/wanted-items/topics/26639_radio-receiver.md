id like to buy a radio. there are plenty of options out there but i like the trigger style and i feel the gt2b mini is to bulky. im interested in the gt2b mods similar to this. unfortunately i dont have access to a 3d printer so thats why im interested in buying one thats ready to go. thanks

@lunasicc you can have the badwolf mod printed and shipped you from shapeways. I think @okp makes the sparkle mod and both @MasterCho and @FLATLINEcustoms sell their own gt2b mod designs.
