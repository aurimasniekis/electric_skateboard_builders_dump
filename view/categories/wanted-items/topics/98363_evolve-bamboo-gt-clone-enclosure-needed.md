Anybody able to provide suggestions for enclosures that'll fit nicely onto Evolve's BGT deck? Wanting to fit a 10s5p battery with plenty of space for a Focbox Unity and all the general stuff (cabling, etc)

I've checked out Eboosted's enclosure specific to this deck but living in Australia makes that ridiculously expensive for me.
