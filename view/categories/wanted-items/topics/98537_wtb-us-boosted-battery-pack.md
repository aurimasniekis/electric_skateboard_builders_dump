Looking to see if anyone has a boosted SR or XR battery for v2 they would want to sell. Bought one to play with for the summer while I collect parts for my DIY but I know range really takes a hit on it. Let me know what ya got

I have a standard range battery, doesn't have BMS and I think has 3 bad cells, but you can get it working again with a new 12s bms. (or 10s if you remove the bad cells)

pm me with an offer, I'm just tryna get it off my hands

Would you consider trading it for a different, working battery pack thatâ€™s not boosted?
