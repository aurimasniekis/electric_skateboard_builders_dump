I think @TarzanHBK is getting some hummie decks aswell. And he's from Germany. Perhaps you could share shipping cost in that case.

I'm keen for two decks, I was going to start another thread to see who would want their EU deck shipped to the UK then I can send them on from here. If there is enough interest I think we can get them shipped directly to the UK saving on the transatlantic shipping and at least saving a little on administration costs.
Also if whoever buys one in this order I can get an enclosure made for them and ship at the same time if there is interest. I will definitely be building a slimline single stacking enclosure and there has also been interest in a deeper double stacker.
