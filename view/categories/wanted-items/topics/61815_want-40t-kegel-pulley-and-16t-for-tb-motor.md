Just got a set of the new Boa wheels and they use the same 10 peg core as Kegel does.  Running dual motors so need two of each, and anything larger than 10mm in width. Preferably 12mm, but could do 15mm if necessary.  Not sure what belt length I'd need, but I'm getting these mounts which are new to the forum.

If you don't have them, but know where I can get them that would also be appreciated.  Trying to get something not too pricy as this will serve as my backup drive until the gear drive system that me and @moon are currently working on.

Thank you!
