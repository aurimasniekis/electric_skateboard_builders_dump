As the title suggests, I am looking for some pneumatic wheels. I have so far been unsuccessful finding any. Been looking at the skike wheels but it looks as if they have some flaws. If anyone has pneumatics they'd be willing to part with, I'll happily buy them off you!

I did not have any luck last time i checked @psychotiller for available but maybe that has changed since. Fwiw I ride various versions of the evolve AT 7" roadies and MBS 8" knobby pneumatics for NYC. Mainly so that I don't have to worry about unexpected street hazards. Don't have any to spare but you can get them from evolve or MBS. Also @Kaly knows all of this stuff cold and is my local.

I saw the evolve wheels on the site-- says **for GT only** but IDK if that means they won't work on other boards or just what they want people to think.

Gotta arrange another meetup in NYC and check out these AT wheels!

Aren't MBS hubs made for 28mm bearings, meaning they won't fit on regular trucks?
I've never seen the e-glide wheels... do they have the same 28mm bearings?

Yep, MBS wheels need a 12mm truck, hence why I went with MBS trucks and headed on a far more difficult path! http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/all-terrain-flat-deck-fattail-deck-mbs-matrix-pro-ii-trucks-mbs-wheels-dual-ollin-170kv-custom-mount-8s-vesc/7419/19?u=dinodave

Haha, yep. Saw your build. This is why I don't really want to do an MBS build. The trucks are also really expensive.

Yeah really, and they don't seem at all worth the extra cost. You could perhaps pad out standard trucks somehow to fit the larger bearings?

Why would there be an issue with pneumatics on regular size trucks? The Enertion, ADS, and @psychotiller wheels all seemed to work.

@michaeld33  those companies designed small pneumatic wheels to work with regular skateboard trucks. Mountain board wheels are generally designed for longer axles, wider hangers, and axles that are larger in diameter (in other words, mountain board trucks).  One main problem is that you'll get serious wheel bite if the 8-inch wheel isn't far enough away from your deck.

yep, I get it. I'm looking for pneumatics to mount on regular trucks though...

@michaeld33  I think the only options right now are the 5-inch Skike wheels (modified with a lathe or other cutting tool) or @psychotiller hubs if they are available.

I am minutes away from doing a cnc order for my wheels. I am only ordering a few sets. They will sell out fast. If you want a set. Now's the time to pre pay.  $350 everything included (single drive hub)

I will take a set. Remind me your email to prepay?  Also want to ask if you can do a custom enclosure for attaching to a loaded chubby unicorn deck, you said white abs was easy available near you?  Don't have exact dimensions yet, but needs to fit 12s4p 1865 pack and 4 VESC.

I can make your enclosure with precise dimensions for $80 in white. Still may need you send me that deck to pull it off well. May also need to make a gasket to get a good seal too.

4 vesc's? Dayum!!!!

Great, should get the battery next week (2 of the @oriol360 12s2p packs wired parallel) and confirm layout placement fit etc. Need to accommodate 4WD 107mm ABEC layout. Though may be worth it to shoot you the deck to get it done right, let me look into how cheaply I can ship it 2 ways.

Has anyone ever tried go-kart wheels? Stumbled upon these today. Certainly some retrofitting would needed, and I'm not sure about the size, this model seems gigantic but perhaps there are some smaller form factors for go-carts?

Maybe the rim below, a mountainboard truck w adapter bearings, and a custom drive wheel adapter?
