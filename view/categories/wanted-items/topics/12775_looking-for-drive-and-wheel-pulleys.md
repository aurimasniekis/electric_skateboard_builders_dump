Looking for a cheaper option either used or new. I think $56 shipped is little ridiculous of a price with TB pulleys with a belt. Especially the $10 shipping cost. Let me know what you have. Thanks

What kind of wheel pulleys are you looking for? Flywheels? Kegels?

For the motor pulley - how wide? Keyway preferred?

What kind of gearing are you looking for as well? And how long are you willing to wait? There's a lot of alternatives than buying from the known vendors but there are some tradeoffs...

@oriol360 sells drive pulleys for kegels and flywheels at a reasonable price, motor pulley you can find on eBay and same goes for the belts. If you know how to source the whole thing shouldn't be more than 35 USD
