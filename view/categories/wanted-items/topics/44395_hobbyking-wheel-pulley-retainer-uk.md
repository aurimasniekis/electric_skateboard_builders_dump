Has anyone got a spare retainer + bolts for the Hobbyking wheel pulley? I bought the pulley set not realising there was no retainer included and the retainer rings are out of stock :frowning:

You could supplement the ring with a large washer and drill the holes out and just get away with is and buy when they are in stock. I was running my first month or two like this because of similar issue.

Thanks for the tip, I'll try it when I get back to my tools. Cable ties are holding it for now :)

Mine is still held on with cable ties! 
I haven't ridden it much though, maybe 20km, my X car beast had purple light of death and haven't got around to buying anything new

There is a 3d print file on thingiverse that fits.
If you can't find them or print them I can help you out.
Those wheel pulleys are something like 25mm wide.

Hi Ben,

I said I'll print them :slight_smile:

We have found a file thingiverse but it sounds like you have already printed a retainer before. Which one did you use?

No, that's not the one. It needs 4 bolts. I'll dig it out.

It would be much easier to go to your hardware store and buy a 45mm od washer and drill the holes in it. That’s what I have done on both my boards and it has worked like a charm

Is that the 3D printed piece?![image|375x500](upload://xtUwKDqRzei3N9H5h84plxpDAyz.jpeg)

That’s the washer I used, it would look better painted black, I think

The actual part sits against the core of the wheel recessed which I think looks better but that was gonna be my Last resort if we couldn't find the file.

Yep that’s the 3d printed one. 
I used socket heads. Cap heads might look better. 
Like you say @WARMAN, the wheelside is contoured to spread the load.

```
The washer actually does sit against the hub of the wheel, it just appears not to, compared to @bigben’s as he has larger wheels and the core seems to be further into the urethane if you know what I mean. The hubs on flywheels are 45mm so I got a 45mm washer

That file says m6 screws,does your 3d printed part use m5 Ben? I bought some 2" standard skate hardware which I think are m5 which fit the hobby king pulley.

I will have used m5. Pretty sure.

So is your pulley retainer ring m6 like that file or did you find a m5 file,just need to know before @moon starts the print!

Yeah I'm thinking it should still be ok as when torqued down should be tight but don't want too much play,if I could get the exact size needed it would be best but i guess I'll have to just try them.

Ok no worries I have been searching seems hard to find,think I'll just get moon to go ahead with that file,the hole might be a little bigger but the head of the bolt will keep it in place.

@bigben  @moon has already printed out the other file,he just wanted postage cost but I will obviously sort him out more than that,if you could get in contact with him and send the right file and he doesn't mind reprinting then thanks.
