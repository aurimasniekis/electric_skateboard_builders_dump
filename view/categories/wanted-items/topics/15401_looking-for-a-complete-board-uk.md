Not necessarily as I already have an e-board to get around, but of course would like a build as quick as possible. What's the longest it could take?

Well i did a group buy for loads of eboard parts so you'll get the best parts possible.

I can either build a full eboard including a deck of your choice or i can build a kit for you so you can replace the parts for your current kit

Can I jump in on this thread? (Sorry, new to the forum).

I'm also looking for a board, I'm UK based with around the same budget as OP!
