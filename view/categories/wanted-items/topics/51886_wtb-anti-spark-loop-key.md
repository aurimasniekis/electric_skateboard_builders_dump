I have a neuromuscular condition that makes soldering pretty difficult. If anyone would be willing to put together a loop key for me (I can provide components or compensate you) using XT60's for connection between the battery and VESC and an XT90 for the antispark key, I'd be very grateful and compensate you for the labor.
