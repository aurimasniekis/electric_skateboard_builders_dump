My current remote sometimes will cut out at random times it’s from eBay and got .5 out of 5 stars on this forum so trying to upgrade. Looking for any reliable remote someone has.

You could go with a remote from a rc car or search for a firefly nano in this forum.

the hoyt puck from what I have read no one has had any drop outs. However it is more expensive than most other remotes.

afaik no, but you could reach out for a 3d printing company for printing the parts, if you don't have a 3d-printer. Have you ever done a soldering job? If yes, go ahead.

This is the complete documentation for building this remote. It's called DIY btw:blush:

The mini remote is IMO the best bang for your buck. It's been super reliable for me and has a ton of throttle control.

You can probably find it cheaper if you search around.

The [avio remote mini mod](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-avio-mini-remote-mod/72074) is a solid mod to reshape the case too. 

Here's mine:

Forgot to say, that a GT2B is bulkier, but cheaper

There's a reason people use the GT2B mod...

What a rip off u can get the mini trigger much cheaper.  I’ve seen it for 20$. Really reliable. Good feel. Modable.  Long lasting battery. durable.  Gives warning when battery low

From what I have seen so far it's either 2.4 GHz mini or the flipsky's vx1. Vx1 is newer and that battery isn't fantastic but no one's had drop out on that one yet and is not trigger style like mini.

Which remote you want depends if you are a thumb trigger guy or an index finger trigger guy. I personally like thumb triggers so i dont like the GT2B but alot of people do like them especially if you are coming into DIY from an evolve set up.

Every time I try to use another style I almost kill myself.  Once you go with one you’re hooked.  If anyone in Bay Area wants to take the thumb maytech remote and I have another....10$ if u grab them.
