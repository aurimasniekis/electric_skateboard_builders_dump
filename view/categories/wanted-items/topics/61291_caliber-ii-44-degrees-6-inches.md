Hi guys, does someone have a Caliber 2 style axel for a 44 degree base that is 6 inches long?

Thanks

Yesterday I got a Dremel, so I'm going to try to cut it myself once I get back home. If I'll screw it up I might need someone else making it :smiley:

That’s super cool! I was thinking on something similar but if I can shorten my hanger correctly I’ll try to make a direct drive using the inboard hubs (like carvon)

I mean... I just have to cast my hanger and thread my axle...

I'm taking a different approach at this type of drive system tho so hopefully I can get it working

Just finished to cut one side. These caliber are pretty strong. Took me like 1hr with a small Dremel. The thing is that you’ve to be very precise to not scratch the axel because it will loose strength.

Dang lol that takes commitment... I would have just thrown the hanger in my drillpress and used it like a lathe and used a hand file to file it down

I did it like in here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjut8hVuLWM

The only difference is my tiny dremel took forever (but give me more precision) and the caliber 2 is stronger to break.

@DAddYE I've been thinking of upgrading my r1.
What made you do it?
What all did you change?
```

## \#27 Posted by: DAddYE Posted at: 2018-07-10T04:39:14.042Z Reads: 62

```
The R1 was a nice way to start, and at the time it come out it was the only 30” eboard with a kick tail (I can’t live without). Then I got the M1, I loved the hubs and not worrying about belt skips. But hated the deck. So I modified the riptide with a ownboard ESC (it’s amazing), got the Sanyo 10s2p and used the M1 hubs. I then upgraded the wheels using the one of the raptor and some good old gorilla tape to fill the diameter gap. It’s a solid build. With the leftovers and a flipsky Vesc I made another spare board. However, the simplicity of the R1 makes it by daily driver. 

If I had to go back I would still get the R1, get still the new ownboard ESC and it’s remote boosted style BUT get either the hummies (but I’m not sure if they work on a normal ESC) or the 90mm Maytech. With the spare parts make another build in case something brakes.

I've been wanting to upgrade battery and esc. I like belt drive. Just don't like my battery sag.

Wait the new battery from them (they’ll release it soon) or get a Sanyo from meepo. It fits (but it’s tight) and you’ve to unsolder the jumper from the ESC.

Oh. I didn't hear about them releasing a new battery.
I'm building a dual 6374 belt drive set up now.
But it's gonna be a longboard.
I'll miss the kick tail......
I'll probably wait until my warranty is up and then tear into my Riptide.

Pretty sure I've seen it.
I like to ride with my feet on the trucks with kicktail boards. I have an old 80s Santa Cruz deck id like to swap my riptide parts to.

You switched the stock riptide esc with a ownboard hobbywing hub motor esc and it worked?
