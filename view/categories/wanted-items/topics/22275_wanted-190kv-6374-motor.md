I know I can buy one brand new with free shipping for about $85-$120 but figured I would give it a chance that someone may have an extra to get rid of. I will be running a 10s Setup so my 245kv just will not cut it.

Why just not buy from @torqueboards or @kaly?, you WILL get warranty unlike a forum member.
