It is, but Ive already chosen the BMS that @mmaner shared. 

I think Ill eventually upgrade it to a Neptune, as the rest of the build is being made better by the slow death of my emtb :joy:

I've decided to conformal coat my ESCs as well. Dual Focboxes. 

I know I should avoid the direct fets, but is there anything else?
