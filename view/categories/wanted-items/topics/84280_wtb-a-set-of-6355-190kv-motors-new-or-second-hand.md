Looking for two 6355 (not bigger!) motors with ~190kv.
Motors have to be sensored.

for example:

* APS 6355 190kv 2200W https://goo.gl/rsPZe8 or https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6355-outrunner-brushless-motor-190kv-2200w/ 
* Torque boards 6355 190kv 2500W https://goo.gl/SqGZoa or https:///products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv 
* Maytech 6355 190kv 3500W https://goo.gl/JTG1fS or https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32716637662.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail&productId=32716637662&productSubject=Maytech-e-skateboard-6355-190KV-electric-motors-for-mobility-scooter&spm=a2g0z.search0104.3.75.6d5a7403C3FJrm&transAbTest=ae803_3&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_10_10065_10068_319_317_10696_10084_453_10083_454_10618_10304_10307_10820_10821_10301_537_536_10902_10843_10059_10884_10887_321_322_10103,searchweb201603_55,ppcSwitch_0&algo_pvid=fc8b670a-dd4f-4e4d-8b02-2a879d48a7fa&algo_expid=fc8b670a-dd4f-4e4d-8b02-2a879d48a7fa-12

For shipping reasons; **EU ONLY**
I would prefer second hand sets

I don't like clicking on links if I can't see the destination, and I don't like doing a bunch of work to unshorten them.  It's silly, really
