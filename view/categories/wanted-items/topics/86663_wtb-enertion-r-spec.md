Looking for a pair of 6355 Enertion motors if anyone particularly in Sydney has some they don't mind letting go.

My current/only build ([eLFF](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ellf-long-low-flexy-loaded-dervish-or-tan-tien-caliber-10-inch-dual-drive-mounting-method-10s1p-dual-focbox/40006/1)) is a powerful, long, low and heavy beast. Great to feel that surge, but so damn heavy to lug around. Need to put everything on a diet for the next build, starting with some nicer, but smaller motors.

Also open to suggestions regarding alternative precision finished motors. Lighter and smaller would be even better.

Hoyt pocket rockets. But they ain't cheap.  And you'd probably have to ask someone to ship for you.  Not sure they'll deal with shipping to Australia.

Those are just maytech motors. Just buy them directly.

hobbyking sk8 are a good alternative too, and they'll ship to AUS since they fulfill out of HK.

A motor costing 3x as much?  Why? Do they explain why? do they make bigger power claims? Can they actually put out more power?  Whatâ€™s inside?

I responded purely off reading the reply and viewing a single image. 

About 5 seconds later I properly looked through the link and almost had a heart attack. :joy:

Have been searching the forum to find some reasonable justification for the obscene price, but am yet to find any.

They're not Maytech but I agree you can get more bang for your buck

There not Maytech

I was just going off looks. But yeah. Definitely can get these motors that are worth the money rather than looking for ancient motors.

Was hoping for something a little different/unique, classic perhaps.

I reckon the R_Specs would give any similar spec motor today a run for their money. Believe they were similar to Tacon?
