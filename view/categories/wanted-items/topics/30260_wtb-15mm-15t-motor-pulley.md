I know there are several new options but I'm sure there is someone like me with a few extra pulleys laying around. If so let me know and shoot me a price shipped to 07047.

A bit of misunderstanding. I need 15T or 16T 15mm Pulley with a keyway.

Hey @torqueboards, do you maybe have any "hidden" pulleys for 12mm belts as well? 14T, 15T? :slight_smile:
(keyway opening required, grub screws preferred)

Not sure what you mean by hidden. I have 14T but it's 15mm wide still could be used if your using a motor with a longer motor shaft. @SilentException 13T 12mm.

@johnny_261 has a nice setup but it takes a couple weeks from Canada. I'm going to pick up a set from @torqueboards.
