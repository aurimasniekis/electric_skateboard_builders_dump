I want to build a Vanguard eboard, but I can't seem to find one in Australia? They're all from the  US, and they blow more than half my current budget which is $1000 so $500 on the board is too much in my opinion. I saw a few around that were all sold out though, anybody got one they can sell to me, or direct me to somewhere that has them for a decent price in AUD? Don't mind second hand either.

Lol. I didn't check. I just did a quick google search. I couldn't find anything else. Boosted has probably taken them all.
