...they are 242mm wide trucks (hanger), and if you count their axles (32mm each), total width is 306mm. Very wide and super carvy trucks.

Great trucks but be careful the drive truck features a step down axle

You may need to use some witchcraft to use your own drive system or buy evolves set up

The only 218 double truck on the market is evolve.  They WILL kill you though over 50kmh.

Just use two front trucks and your own engine mounts

Not sure two of these will fit on the evolve truck front or back be honest.  Maybe go dual diagonal

because the design of the evolve trucks makes it a pain in the ass. evolves rear trucks are literally the front truck but with two motor plate mounts welded on so.....?

To avoid the stepped axle is what he is talking about.  The front truck has no 10mm section, or so I would assume

Why people still use these sidewinder truck style is beyond me.  I thought it was stupid then and think they are stupid now.  They are only good for carving and they are tall.  I understand that alot of esk8er enjoy carving but you can get most trucks boards to carve just swap out bushings or even swap one of the rpk trucks for a tkp truck and it will do the same thing.

What I was thinking of was using a seperate motor mount that I already have and mounting it on a front truck and using it on the rear. Save me the expense of a rear truck and another motor mount to suit ![image|375x500](upload://obwJXV4W27l3ugZDuvFNTXYQaQw.jpeg)

that's the HobbyKing mount which is only for hobbyking trucks. won't fit on the evolve trucks or even calibres

Nah you can definitely  (MAYBE) fit one with filing down excess, raising and filling surfaces inside the mounting hole - also coat the mounting clamps with hairspray and then gently rub some wax onto it, then clamp it down onto a blob of filler-reinforced thick epoxy on a roughened and paint-free area where you wanna place on the hangar. The hard way, they DIY way:)

Can you elaborate, please - in perfect I'd like to settle on a setup (as close to) like this DKP Evolve  https://youtu.be/O0zy5LHXPrU?t=215 - but with hub motors and up to 35km/h. I'm also really tempted to have Avenue/Avenue-like suspension on both trucks. Lot's of DIY-ing I bet, but do you say a DKP with great low-speed carving is possible with a non-DKP or special carver-truck setup? Thanks!

Technically yes you could change bushings and ride double cone or a barrel/cone set up. You could also do a rkp and tkp.  A lot of LDP guys do that because they can pump the board and use the centripetal force they are generating to have the board go a good amount of distance without actually putting their foot on the ground to push the board.

Hobbyking mounts will fit calibres style hangers if you file down the mount a little.  I used it for like a year without issue.
