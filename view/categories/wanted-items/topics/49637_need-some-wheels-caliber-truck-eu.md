To sell my build, I need some nice wheels in the style of kegels preferably 
New or used, does not matter as long as they aren't beaten up to death, around 90mm is what Im looking for
Also one caliber truck and a mount for one if you have an extra one you do not need, it must be able to me mounted reverse
Also some 10inch wide griptape...
