I have also been looking for a used set of mountainboard trucks. Where is the best place in the US to buy trampa or mbs trucks?

stateside, order mbs direct or look at ur local sports and outdoors shop... SOME skate shops have them but i have only seen them in the northern states.... down south where i live now its mostly longboard/skateboard trucks
