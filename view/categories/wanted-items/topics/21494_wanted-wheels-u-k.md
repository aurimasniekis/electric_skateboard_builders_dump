I have these: http://s.aliexpress.com/FbuUV73y
The price changes every week, I bought 4pcs for only 30$ inclusive shipping to EU. Maybe you can check the shipping to UK and wait until they offer them again at that price.

I used this 30T pulley from ebay and 3 or 6 M5 bolts, they fit perfect into the gaps.

I've got a set of blue 97mm clones. I can 3D print for you a few pulleys (any size) if you want. I can sell you wheels and pulleys for Â£50.
