If you're interested in a little more customizability and features, @uigiroux is selling a diebieMS right now. It supports 12s and 80a discharge, and has a fuse :+1:

plenty of peeps around... i could help you but would probably take 6 weeks with ordering cells and delivery time..
@thisguyhere probably has cells in stock, use search, he has plenty of threads advertising
@torqueboards has packs ready to go if you dont need any special specs or configuration...

i like 12s for the extra voltage... but nothing bad with 10s if it 4p or larger IMO opinion but depends on each persons needs and available space
