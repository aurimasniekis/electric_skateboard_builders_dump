Anyone got old or unused htd 335-5m-15 they have no use for? I've been waiting for 2 months to finish my build. Belts and charger have yet to arrive and I'm starting to feel desperate. If you have em laying around and feel they need a new home, send em to Canada where I'll put them to great use in these hellish streets :slight_smile:
