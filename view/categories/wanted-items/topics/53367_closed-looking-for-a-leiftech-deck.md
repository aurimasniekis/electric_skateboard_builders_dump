I wanted to use my old leiftech deck for a cheap build, I scraped the fiberglass topsheet to gain some flex, should not have cause now I got an enclosure shaped for a deck that's split in 2. 

If anyone has one lying around I'd be happy to take it off your hands. Offering 20â‚¬ shipped to Belgium.

Edit: Found a replacement. Post is closed
