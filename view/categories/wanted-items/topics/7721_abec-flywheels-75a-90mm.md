Anyone have these or can point me to a seller/equivalent? I have 83mm clones which are supposedly 79a but feel rough on my streets.

also check out the 97 flywheels if you can fit them.  Super smooth and my favorite!  A much bigger difference than 83-90.

Im trying to keep the build as light as I can. That is why I used 83mm clones. However, I've become spoiled by the 90mm yuneec wheels and, like I said, my streets are terrible. There are some newly laid patches of road where the 83mm feel delightful, but the rest of the road is just awful vibration and lots of pebbles. 

How much do the 97mm weight individually (no bearings)?

reasonable.  I'd also try a legit set of the 83's then.  They are softer in my experience.  Same weight - but better ride.  Almost all of the clones i've tried are decent, but a bit harder duro.  Regardless of what they claim.

This is what he posted. Blue one is 97mm clones. Last one is Electric Flywheel 107mm. I got lazy in the cropping.

I do but they are out of stock everywhere and even 90mm 75a is very hard to get.

Abec11 is idiot to stop producing these wheels, best esk8-wheel imho
