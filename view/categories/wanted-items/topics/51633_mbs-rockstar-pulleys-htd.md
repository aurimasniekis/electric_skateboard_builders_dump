Or 3D printed. Could make you stl file if you need, but for this I need to know the distance of the screws and how much teeth. I printed mine for superstar with petg holding up like 300km but sooner or later the teeth will wear off

From the center of the rim to the center of one screw. The other holes are calculing by there own. Those screws are m4?
You will need than probably longer screws but thatâ€™s all. Also let me know how much space you have from the inner rim corner to your motormount. I made mine 25mm and the 15mm belt sit perfectly. If you wanna use 20mm belts or your mounts sit more close to each other than on mine I need to make them more deep.

Do your mounts have a crossbar? Or can be adjusted individual?

Pm me your e-mail iâ€˜ll Sent you something over when iâ€˜m ready. 66th is ok?
Test print in low quality to check if everything will fit. Iâ€˜m make you a 30mm pulley. If you find out that itâ€™s to wide or too slim just let me know.
Itâ€™s just one click to change it.
More important that the hold pattern will fit

I think i posted it already somewhere else, but with this two pictures you can design every htd5m teeth pulley you want
![image|365x499](upload://oo50nJAQp9iQuiJzwUgz9wmzWM2.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://cbAgEMlI3zUhsSM3pvpeWBwdL7r.jpeg) 

The only thing you need to know else is the bolt pattern from the hub you want to design them for.
