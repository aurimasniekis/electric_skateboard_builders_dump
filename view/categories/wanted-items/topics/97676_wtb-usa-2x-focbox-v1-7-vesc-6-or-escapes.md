Looking for dual escs for my board since my vesc 6 connect fell through :( 

No 4.xx vescs other than the Focboxes please, this has to be a sturdy and durable setup for 12s and high amps 

If you've got a cooling plate / mounting bracket to sell as well, that would be cash money

Living in the 10605, so let me know if you're local or far away in your post / PM

Thank you :)
