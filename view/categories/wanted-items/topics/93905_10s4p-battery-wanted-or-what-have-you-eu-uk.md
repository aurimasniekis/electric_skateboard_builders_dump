Lipo/li-ion?

```
for liion, take vtc5a, vtc6 or q30 cells. I prefer the vtc5a. I would not recommend lipo anymore because they alwaaaays start sag voltage after time.

Liion is the way to go, for me. ðŸ¤˜

I have no experience with lipos but from what i read they only sag if they have a low C rating (like 20 - 30c for example). Not sure if you'll notice that much sag with 65c Graphenes for instance.

my experience is even with high end 50c lipos after the 30th ride they start to sag at 60% and start to lose capacity. I put them in storage mode after every ride and never over or undercharged them but did not help. Its just a lipo thing I think ðŸ˜€

I mean lipos are totaly fine and easy to get them working. But for a long term build i would take liion. If the board is meant to be cheap just go with lipos they just dont last that long :)

65c Graphenes
[/quote]

If you had a 6s 5000mah 65c lipo it can put out 325 amps (just ratings)


30c they are rated for 150a

But I'm sure you know manfuacture ratings mean nothing

i have 3 sony vtc5 10s4p packs for sale $320 shipped anywhere in the USA

In all previous experience, the VTC5 has a slightly longer lifespan than the the VTC5a. 
both are fantastic cells, but realistically they can safely only pull 25a each

here is a useful site for verifying info about the genuine current abilities. (read the fine print at the bottom of the site)

Edit: the bulk discount  it's not worth half the hassle.

He's not doing orders at the moment, I asked him like a week ago. Too busy with exams he said. I asked when he'd be done with them as it was a long term project...No response. 

Look elsewhere!

Haha thnx for the tag, I have to much guys asking me questions for building a battery, or battery building tips & tricks.

Unfortunately I am currently too busy with my studies.

I can build you battery, but I will need around 2 weeks.

30Q cells from nkon, fuse on charging port and I have both D140 and D596 from bestech. 

Photos of last build (12s5p) for @Halbj613:

Im also in UK in bham, where abouts are you mate?

Would you be able to put up approx quotes for the work to do a 10s4p 12s4p 10s5p 12s5p builds

Do you do it as a service so we order batteries to you and you put them together with BMS fuse charge port?

hey, I am in Croatia, EU

I have 30Q cells at home, also I have D140 and D596 for 10s and D140 for 12s.

My price is 4,80 eur per cell (includes cell, my work, fishpaper, nickelâ€¦) and 50 eur for D140 or 80 eur for D596 bms. I can add led on/off switch for 3 eur and/or battery % display for 5 eur with D596 bms.

For example, 10s4p with d140 bms is: 10 x 4 x 4,80 eur + 50eur (bms) = 242 eur. + shipping (20-30 eur with GLS to most of EU)

we can make any combinations you want. I can do only spot welding job with your or my cells, I can do whole battery, as you wish
