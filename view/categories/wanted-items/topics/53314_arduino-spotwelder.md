Make sure you burn your own house down. Donâ€™t set a fire at the CarvOn warehouse or youâ€™ll have a very angry mob after you!

A MOB!!!??? Does that mean fighting? I love to fight!! Done boxing for 1 year with my cousin and jujitsu(none Brazilian) for 6 years  but then our master had to leave and move back to his country.  I'll take that into "consideration " ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ˜‚ mobs are slightly harder to fight off. From that thread it would be 1 vs 30. 

Why not just get those Sunkko ones?

Tanto? As in knife? What are gonna go mount it on your board and send it towards people?  Enough of the off topic banter. If anyone has an Adrino spot welder, Reply. 

I guess if you really need to travel with a welder. Personally I hate hauling my build stuff around. Which I do often because of the work space I have at the office. But It sucks when you forget a part. I like my station to stay in one place if possible.

It has a great documentation and through holes for easy soldering. i just did not get the time and needed to buy some last parts (metal plate, some terminals, ...).
Now i need a spot welder and tried to sell the unused/unassembled kit and just buy a prebuilt. more expensive but faster :smiley:

if you are interessted i can check the part list and my bills. would be nice to get what i paid :) 
shipping will be around 10â‚¬ international
