Hello, thanks mate but meanwhile i've bought some focboxes . I am still looking for 6374's but preferably in the eu . How much are you asking for the motors? I'll check if you have other interesting parts in your previous post.

meanwhile i've also bought a mount .But iam still looking for motors and Trampa trucks. I would have bought your mount if i hadn't found such a nice bargain --> 50 euro for the okp limited edition mount (from a forum member). Your mount looks great by the way, love the Idea mounts. I ask around if someone is interested.
