I could NOT get one for myself so I'm converting my Bamboo into a DIY one, more power, more range more reliability, best remote control

I have 2 evolve bgt and they are not willing to provide me with a new battery for one of them. They want to to send them to there headquarters or travel over 2.5 hours to them?? Paying over 1k and getting poor customer service is not on....

Forget about built boards, I'll never buy a built board ever unless they offer spare parts for sale

Metroboard is pretty good and they use DIY parts for the most part.  All the others are meh, especially hub motor boards or boards that need unobtainium BMSs to function

I’m loving the belt drive, never tried hubs, I tried catching someone on a Meepo the other day and they were jetting away from me...

...and some are still thinking lightweights like Enertion can play along 'big ones' (a.k.a Evolve, Trampa, Boosted, etc.) :rofl:  These can not find a Leprechaun in a Sequoia forest, much less tiny Enertion can offer baloney.

You cannot make a stew with none of them. They are a Joke. All of them. They get hold onto their parts inventory as if they were protecting some kind of missile technology that nobody else has. Even Metroboard. Try to buy one of them stupid wheel pulleys, Brian? Is like trying to borrow a Tenderloin from a starving Tiger!

If you *carefully* choose your BMS, I think so.
