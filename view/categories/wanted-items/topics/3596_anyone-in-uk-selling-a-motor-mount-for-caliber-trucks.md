Hi I am after a motor mount and possibly pulleys to fit caliber trucks. I have priced them up from various sources but with shipping and duty it works out ridiculous so if anyone has a mount please let me know thanks.

You could also just ask some of the US/Australian webshops if they can value the package lower than the real value - ex. $35. Then you will not pay as much in tax/duty :)
