i have a customer who wants a build with these, and i'm inclined to build it. 

http://shop.mbs.com/accessories-488/mountainboard-wheels/mbs-all-terrain-longboard-wheels-754.html

They look like they have the flywheel clone style cores, so i'm sure somebody somewhere has designed a pulley for them. You know who you are, and i want them. Help a brotha out with some pulleys.  I'm hoping to start ordering parts for this build within a week or so, and i'll be starting a thread on it. Its going to be bright green with yellow accents so it should be like a nasty on road/off road hornet.

I have 107mm flywheel clones and i use these http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:545345, but tooth height is little low.

Could roll you some? Those look very similarly cored to Abecs/clones though?

yes, they do appear to be very similar in the images, although i can't be totally sure the dimensions are exactly the same of course without buying them. I'm going to buy them anyway, i could loan you a second set to design the pulleys around. 

You want to design some for these? i'm pretty sure other people would buy them from you here. Obviously i would buy them from you but i can see these wheels becoming popular for esk8 builds for areas with cobblestone and terrible pavement and packed dirt trails.

Yeah for sure, I'd be keen to do a design if you could loan a set. I'd just need 1 wheel actually. Some caveats about the design though. Will drop you an email about it.

I'm curious do you think TB's aluminum pulleys will work on these ?

That's a good question. Lets ask him.

@torqueboards hey will your larger bolt-through pulleys work with these?

I feel like they will I wanted to put these wheels on my board but a few months ago they were out of stock and this thread just reminded me how cool they were lol 

I think I want to put these on my board. If it's just a plug and play I don't want to modify it

Haha. I don't like the idea of chopping trucks. They're designed that way for a reason ðŸ˜‰. I can testament to this as my front Caliber is pretty bowed after an experience with a pavement.

the core is the same as the enertion wheels, so the enertion pulleys fits exactly in the MBS wheels and if the abecs fit on your trucks, the MBS will too. Torqueboards should work too.

I've testet them booth: 97mm 75a Abecs perform better on cobblestone and terrible pavement than the MBS wheels. The MBS look cooler but you get no real advantage, even on dirt trails imho.

Yeah, they'll fit. The new pulleys are 12mm width. Except currently we only have a 255mm belt. However, you could still use a 9mm belt. We'll have a few more options soon.

Unfortunately, we still only have the 36T.

Don't the various belt sellers sell custom belt widths?

Beltingonline offers them but the shipping is $40 to the US so not attractive for small orders.

I have asked at Polytech but haven't gotten an answer yet.

If your running TB's existing pulley's they will accept an 11mm belt which is not quite 12mm but still 20% more belt with no other changes in parts.

This is interesting. So despite the rounded profile and treat pattern these guys don't do any better off road than 97mm ABECs?

I'm going to run this by my customer and see what he wants to do. He may decide he still wants them anyway, but 97mm ABECS would be easier to work with i think.

It's not that much of a difference, both wheels are ok, you should try them yourself.
I like the Abecs more because they're softer (75a), on bumpy roads/gravel/dirt it feels much smother. It may depend on the sort of 'off road' you want to go. Have you seen the contact patch on the MBS https://www.instagram.com/p/BACtKEaD26a/?taken-by=eboarding On grass, the MBS will give you more grip, on flat surfaces, you loose grip.

Thanks for this feedback @E-Boarding I've wondered how these actually perform. They defintely have an  off-road Monster Truck look, kind of like a Tonka Truck. But I couldn't imagine a scenario where they are much better than regular thane for riding. @longhairedboy maybe your customer could be convinced to try actual pneumatics?

We backed away from pneumies when he found these and we were having a hard time finding some that fit the bill. 

Who's got pneumies and pulleys for them now anyway? I've been looking around and can't find any, but i suspect i'm looking in all the wrong places. Evolve is sold out or i'd just get theirs from thier spare parts shop. 

I'm just going to get these MBSs and see what's up with them. I have plenty of trails i can try them on. They definitely do have a much smaller contact patch on pavement though due to thier rounded profile, which could affect acceleration as well as braking, but i won't know till i test them i guess.

@longhairedboy the best pneumies are definitely the psychohubs by @psychotiller. Full kit with hardware for $350. Maybe @psychotiller can cut you a B2B deal on them? You've gotta admit it would be awesome to see them on a few custom completes! 

Evolve had them for sale in their aus shop for a while but they wouldn't ship to the US from that site. You could send them to one of our Aus friends and then have them reshipped here.

There are of course all of the mountainboard wheels and kits but then you're not really building a skateboard anymore :slight_smile:

Nice!  How do you like the wheels themselves?  The dirt seems to show it's riding high w/ only the center in contact - any issues? (contact patch like on a motorcycle tire).

Did you have to space the wheel pulley out at all to fit?  I have a set of the 107 flywheels i want to use, just haven't measured to see what will fit...

GJ!

The wear has been fine so far but only have 10-15 miles so far.   I ride on some paths that run thru the forest that have some rough surface patches and this eats them up no problem. 

No spacing issues, I just used two wheel spacers to give me a little additional space.  I have ordered a second motor and mount and should have it installed by the weekend.  We will see if I run into space problems having a second motor on there. 

I will post more pictures tonight to show comparison of these wheel with that of Enertion.

To give you an idea of sizing I have Enertion on left, DIY on right.  I have not tried mounting the Enertion pulley since it is for a different project but would probably have space issues with a dual setup. I am using 184mm Caliber 2 trucks.

I have these on the back, I'm wanting to get these mbs wheels on the front though. Have you noticed any slack from the bearing when you're stopped? Maybe they're defective. It could be under warranty!  And what speed do they start?  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7aea0a823dae29bb0a8d4a3444250be737e84d1d.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Not slack at all, was actually really hard to push the bearings in, I had to tap them in gently, not sure if that caused the issue due to the plastic core applying pressure on the bearing itself. 
Not motor yet, so I'm still pushing it, and it's so hard to detect vibrations caused by that since the  wheels them self are vibrating cause of the design. 
I just noticed it by spinning them by hand.

Yeah they're a bit bumpy, but not much. I've been wanting those mbs to complete it, the other set here is what I have to ride right now. I tried modifying the other two to complete the off road set, having a street and off road set. No luck yet on off road completion, with the mbs it might be possible though. Call mbs tomorrow! They should have warranty, if it hasn't been too long since they were purchased?(these are 97mm clones)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/902b12ce98241fdbe538dfd986086278db42eed0.jpg" width="281" height="500">

I just used them yesterday and had no issues i reccommend using a pulley with the right diameter of your motor shaft so you don't have to melt so much rubber. But it worked with no flaws! even on looses 50degree trucks no difference than the 97mm clones and top speed the off road tires get better obviously than a slower speed. If anyone wants to mount these wheels i reccommend that someone uses a large washer drilling diameter holes for the truck and bolt holes then cementing or melting the washer in place, make sure the bolts are tightened to a place where there is no pulley wobble. If the pulley is mounted on the motor shaft better almost no tread (maybe 5-10mm at max) would have to be melted away. @Titoxd10001
