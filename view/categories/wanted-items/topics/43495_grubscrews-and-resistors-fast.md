Hello I need someone in EU that has either

the resistors for vedder antispark switches with led toggle

Grubscrews for motor pulley 4m i think is the common one?

Best if someone has both so I dont need to buy a 200 pack and wait a month

Use regular screws with or without some super glue, it will hold, at least for me

if you have the right loctite, it won´t come loose ;)
Much stronger than every grubscrew!

How is it that you remove the pulley? I'm guessing a torch and a puller
