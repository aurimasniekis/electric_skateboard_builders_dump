Hi guys. I'm currently looking for standard very cheap knockoff flywheels, but suddenly I can only find one seller on eBay which is from the US.. Anyone having any up for sale or know a seller? (Black preferred) 

Also looking for a NANO-X remote or a Winning remote if anyone in EU has one. 

Thank you, 
best regards
fraannk

@ajaynagra has a huge EU group buy going for them (among other things)

I'm sure you can still jump in.

The orange ones should be in stock at amazon.co.uk :) https://www.amazon.co.uk/Slick-RevolutionÂ®-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard/dp/B01J835996/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1482361527&sr=8-5&keywords=slick+revolution

I have a winning remote that I've never got round to even opening the package that I'll sell at the going rate. 
I'm in the UK. @fraannk
