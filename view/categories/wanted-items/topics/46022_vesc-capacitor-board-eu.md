Hey Guys,

anyone here who has one or two capacitor boards left? I want to replace the big cap on my vanda vesc with that. The only source I found was vesc.co.uk, but there is an issue with the payment method.

So if you want to get rid of some, I will take em! :slight_smile: 

Thanks in advance!

https://www.mouser.co.uk/ should get you covered. 

edit: to find your caps. you don't necessarily need the pcb.

Thanks for your reply!

Yeah I thought so too, because the big cap is soldered directly on the power cables of the vesc. 
But since I have a dual setup and the other Vesc has this cap board, I want to make both look uniform :slight_smile: 

But I will buy the caps on that site, thank you. :)

You could remove the caps on the second and go for one big one,
