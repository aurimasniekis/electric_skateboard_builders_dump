Although sold out on their main site currently, if you look around the 100mm white boa wheels are very nice.

I have ahmyo Akashi wheels, really nice wheels but very small, they have the kegal hub![image|230x500](upload://kIqeGuQwA4NGH7HRzJYcGmI4cX5.jpeg)

hmm yeah... sorry they are just to small.

What? the white BOAs are 100mm kegal cored, the urethane isnt the same but surely its close?
You can get 97mm high rebound flywheel clones :slight_smile:
