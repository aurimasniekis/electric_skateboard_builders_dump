Hi I'm looking for a set of wheels for my board. It doesn't have to be new but neither completely destroyed.

I can't decide if I should go with 90 or 97mm. Currently i'm on a 230kv 16/36 ratio and I usually start giving a little push to the board. I'm scared that a 97mm wheel could lower my acceleration too much. Can anybody help me decide? 

Anyway if you have any spare set to sell hit me up.
