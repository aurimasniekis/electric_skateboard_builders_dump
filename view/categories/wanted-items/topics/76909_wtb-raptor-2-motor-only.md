hello
i finished my third esk8 now..  loaded vanguard, focboxes, evolve supercarve trucks, hub motors! super nice esk8.
Now im looking for a new project. i want to make another hub esk8..
i wil make another esk8 with evolve trucks but now i want raptor hubs.
Looking to hear if someone wants to sell them.

note: no i cant use the current selling hub kit on enertion site, because i need the raptor 2 motor and NOT 2.1.


hopefully someone has 2 willing to sell :slight_smile:


gr sam

Ask @SeanHacker. He probably has more than one pair. Although he clearly stated that the Raptor ver 2.0 has a lot of problems.

Yep. I have 4 pairs of them. 

@hoeksame1 Sorry but I'm not selling any of them. I would rather burn them in a fire than have someone else get hurt from these shitty motors that Enertion releases without testing.
