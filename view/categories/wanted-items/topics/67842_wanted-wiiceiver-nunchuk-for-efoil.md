I'm riding an efoil ride now:[my efoil](http://efoil.builders/t/superlefax-flylo-build/2192) and I'm looking for a working Wiiceiver and Nunchuk pair. 

Does anyone want to sell?

Wow that's a crazy nice build. I'd love to try one one day but I'm assuming I'm too heavy for this thing.

There should really be a waterproof remote for this

I'm going to begin an EFoil build this fall and winter.  Hoping to fine tune everything before the spring in Florida where I live.  Looking forward to getting my built.  Best of luck my friend.

Sorry for the delay, this is all I have, I though that I had a Wiiceiver but can't find it anywhere.
