In the process of building a Lacroix board and ive hit a wall.  I can't find anyone with motor mounts and driver gears in stock.  At this point ill take anything I can get, ATC, UNIK, IDEAL.  

Also if someone knows where a man could find some id really really really appreciate it.  Goal is to be off the GTX and on the Lacroix for the next esk8 ride next month. 

Paypal ready

How is the reliability of the matrix II trucks? Does the plastic base plate crack? Since many ask about mounts for these, I am considering it. What length would most
people need for the motor plates?

Etoxx makes some sweet stuff but I’m looking for a belt drive system.  
I’d really like a set of the UNIK mounts and driver gears.  

I have the new metal base plate and they look tougher en hell.

Unikboards out of stock, E-toxx, Janux, Fatboy massively expensive... so just a polite enquiry to see if Rocklocker had any luck and no need for your snarkiness asshole.

Search for @idea mounts here. He does some pretty nice job with his mounts and you can get pulleys and stuff as well from him in case you need.

I’m sure they actually do, I bought a deck from him so maybe that was my way in.  I’d like to buy a second set myself.
