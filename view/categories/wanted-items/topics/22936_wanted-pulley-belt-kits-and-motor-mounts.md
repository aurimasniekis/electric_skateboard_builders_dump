I have paris trucks and 80mm flywheels and I'm looking for two motor mounts and two pully/belt kits. I've been mainly thinking about getting two of these kits: [DIY Electric Skateboard Parts Pulleys And Motor Mount Kit For 83/90/97MM Wheels](http://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-Electric-Skateboard-Parts-Pulleys-And-Motor-Mount-Kit-For-83-90-97MM-Wheels/351923420520?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D40130%26meid%3Dbcd634b93ff044f49e1161228f7a4dfe%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D6%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D361935644731) but I'm not really happy with the 1:3 gear ratio. If anyone has any spare motor mounts or pulleys and belts then please let me know.
