As title says, BMS took a crap on my GTX. I don't know a lot about E- boards but good with electronics. Only been riding a year but its stuck in slow, no battery info and had corrosion on the board so that points to bms.

Confused on all the combos out there or what to run so was seeing if anyone has a replacement or a whole setup. 

Thanks

Sounds like your esc went bad had this same thing happened to me....I checked the board with 2 other esc & it ran fine...

Wish I had another to check with... probably going to end up turning it into a DIY planned on getting a battery soon anyway... just to bad that's going to electronics now.
