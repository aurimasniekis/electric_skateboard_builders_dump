You think you will only use it once or twice but once you get it you realize the possibilities. It's amazing knowing you can now make a battery for ANYTHING

And you will not be building just one or two boards.

Study study study, battery isn't something you can just wing that how mistakes are made and mistakes while making a battery can cause alot of damage.

Ask the library, usually they know where you can get stuff like that.  Or try a high school metal shop. Or tool rental shop like Cresco or United Rentals.

I think it's so worth it just to buy the boss spot welder. I thought I'd only build one battery and I was just barely saving money, but now I'm building my 4th one and I've "saved" hundreds on my other packs.

I need it for the next month to build my next two packs, assuming I don't build or rebuild any after that. I do have a broken one (my error) that gives a FET error that I can give away, if you're willing to fix it or send it to Aulakiria to get it repaired. He quoted me $25, presumably not including shipping to and from Korea.
