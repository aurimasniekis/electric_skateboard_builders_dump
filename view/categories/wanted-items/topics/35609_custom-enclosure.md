Looking for an 8 inch long by 6 inch wide by 2.75 high enclosure.
Donâ€™t want to spend too much money.

Give kydex a try. Just stick it in the oven and drape it over anything for a contour enclosure. It's on ebay

you seem like you haven't done much research. At any rate, kydex is a plastic material that becomes formable when you heat it up.  The material itself is, of course, "waterproof", but the waterproofing of the enclosure you make with it is up to you.

Check out my waterproof kydex enclosure! I used a yoga mat to make it water tight. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/build-log-waterproof-longboard-10s-life-with-vesc/7157/34
