As the topic says, looking for 6374 motors that are in the 230-300kv range and preferably the US. TB used to sell the 230kv ones but I think they don't carry em anymore, another choice was the APS 300kv but I want to see if anyone else has them before ordering from APS. 

Edit: Looking for motors that have sensors. (will have a build thread out soon :wink:)
