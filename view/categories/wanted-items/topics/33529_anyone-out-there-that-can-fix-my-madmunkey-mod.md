I destroyed the charging port on my GT2B during the MadMunkey Mod.  I literally only have about $20 to spend.  I would buy the one from @JLabs but believe it or not thatâ€™s out of my price range.  So anyone got a spare they could sell me for cheap? Iâ€™m in US.

Nah, maybe I can send my GT2B to someone and pay them a bit to do it for me, Iâ€™ve got everything else running perfectly.  I just canâ€™t charge.

Edit: Title changed

Did it just come un-soldered? Like @faithfulpuppy said...Show us a pic. If you damaged the board that is a whole other issue. Cool?

I think the simplest option would be to just buy a Micro USB breakout and solder it onto the old Mini USB pads. You could also do what I did with my GT2B and add a TP4056 module and connected it to the battery and Micro USB. I have a thread about it and I'm sure you can find it on here by searching "GT2B Charging".

Nothings really destroyed, Iâ€™m just horrible at solder connections that small
