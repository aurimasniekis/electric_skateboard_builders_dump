Before i agree to sell any of it....just because im surprised that anyone responded that quickly, i really dont want to sell it, im in love with it, and with 5 kids, id never be able to afford another one. But i need an esc and remote for it, would either of you, or anyone for that matter, have a boosted v1 esc and remote? I know i posted it for sale, but if i could find that and be back on the road, it would be ideal. Im only selling it because i havent been able to find parts to fix it.

If you want to fix it then get a mod to change over to "Want to Buy", I've seen other ESC dead V1s so it may take a while.  The other option is to get a VESC or non-programmable ESC with a new remote and mod your Boosted, if you replace the connectors and voltage match then run motor detection there's a chance to get it running again
