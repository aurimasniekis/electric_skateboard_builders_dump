Need to be a bit more specific my friend.  Belt, gear, hubs trucks wheels etc.  Also put the location on either your profile or the thread title.  Better the thread title to make things easier for folks to make offers.

You should post everything over on news from now on.  I'm like the rear guard.  Carefully guiding people to the fun side without getting banned.:laughing: 

Seriously though if you want attention then both is the best way.
