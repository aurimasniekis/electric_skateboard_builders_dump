I want to get an enertion 6355 r spec because they are the best motor. They do not sell them anymore however.

I'm pretty sure Maytech 6355's are identical other than the wires.

i need to go through my bins and box up some shit for a garage sale. I'll bet i have a half dozen perfectly good enertion motors sitting around now that i've been swapping them out for my own for testing. 

not to mention a pile of extraneous shit like bolts and heat shrink and samples from people like a Flier VESC that's never been used.

Hey Skitzor,
