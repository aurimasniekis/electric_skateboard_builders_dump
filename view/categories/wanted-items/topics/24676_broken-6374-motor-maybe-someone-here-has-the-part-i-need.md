hey guys, so i had a seemingly dead turnigy 6374 that i was playing around with and finally got inside of it (it had terribly stripped outer screws), to find the main culprit of my headache was the 'fan' in the attached diagram is completely broken.

this is the part that holds the main big bearing in place.
below i have images of my broken part

so basically what im asking is if anyone has this part from an old or broken motor that they would be willing to send to me cheaply.

I reckon you would be able to get away with superglueing it back together
