I would like to purchase your Carvon single or dual drive. I am also open to another different hub. Just let me know what you have. I'm looking for a hub motor to use with a 10s3p battery and an Arbor kicktail deck. Unfortunately it doesn't have proper clearance for a belt drive which I  learned the hard way. Thank you in advance.
