Hi!

Looking for a 16T 15mm HTD5M pulley, the local postal service lost mine I ordered from ebay, and don't want to wait 2 months for a new one to arrive (starts snowing here in Sweden soon...). At the same time I cannot for the life of me find a pulley from a shop anywhere in Europe where the pulley with shipping won't end up a costing ridiculous amount. So I figured I'd ask here if someone has a spare one they would be willing to sell?

Thanks! :)

Thank you guys, actually misstyped in the title, I meant 15T so this is perfect.

Feels like 20+ euros is a bit on the expensive side, but I guess I'll just bite the bullet! :)

Quick question, when configuring the steel pulley on eskating.eu, there is an option for the set screws:
On teeth
On teeth both inline

Whats the difference?

EDIT: Oh, the last option in litterally 2 screws in line with each other.
