I got a mini incomming. But i got a 1000€+ board in tha making so i want something sweeet with it. Somting thats feels Good. Becuse thats how i interact with THE board. 

But IF its small problems all över THE remote then i can skip it for now. THE mini may be Good bit its big n ugly i dont like THE wheel om it.

Sorry Im going to pass on this one. I did a bit of reading and i feel that the firefly is not completely there yet in regard to being problem free.

if u bought it from him, it's complete and like any other remote (but so much better). You can take the diy root and make it yourself.
