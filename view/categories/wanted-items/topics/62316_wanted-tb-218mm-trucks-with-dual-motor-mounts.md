Anyone by any chance have a set of trucks with mounts they dont need? The trucks and mounts are super expensive to get in Australia so was hoping someone had a second hand set. They don't need to look great, just still be functional

Not sure how much they will cost to send to you but I have trucks and mounts, I will have the now mounting rings in a couple days

I even have the original bushings which I used for 3 days and changed because I'm too heavy for them

Don't worry, I have them mounted only until I get motor mounts for my Surf rodz which selling these should get me some
