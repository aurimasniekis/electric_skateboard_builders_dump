Hi,

I have a Bestech BMS D596 for a 12s battery setup. According to https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/need-connector-for-my-bestech-bms/28475/21 (which is the previous version of the D596) this BMS has a JST EH 11 pin connector and a JST EH 2 pin connector. 

Question: From the hell do I get JST EH connectors?? I saw every other kind of JST connectors (XH, PH etc) but no EH ones, especially none with 11-pins. 

And: I live in germany so it would be great to have shipping costs of 20$ for a 2$ item :wink:.

Best regards
Andreas

Even if I could find those connnectors on the litechpower site (which I didn't) shipping costs would be very high.

Oh yes, you are right. Didn't see that you can choose number of pins and form factor. If I don't find an alternative I think I have to order it there

digikey and arrow appear to have JST EH (but you must crimp)
