Key ways are usually 3mm x 3mm.  If you don't have a key then use a 3mm drill bit and cut the shaft section to the length you need with a dremel.  Works a treat for a key.

Yes they do but they only sell them with the pulley kit.  Stupid I know because they really should come with the motors.

Don’t really have anyway of cutting metal bits so looking for an already cut into shape one

I don’t really mind about shipping times so doesn’t have to be uk based. More worried about price

A hacksaw is very cheap, so is a file, they are the foundation tools of elementary metalwork and it is possible to have change out of £10 for both of them

You can find lengths of keyway (tool steel) on eBay and Aliexpress etc

Mate I am 14 if I turned up home with a hacksaw my dad would take it and kill me with it

Either way I bought the key ways from street wing and the loctite from a local shop

It is loctite 234 red bottle

A metal hacksaw has tiny teeth, you would find it about as hard to cut yourself with it as a butter knife
Since you are 14, try talking to him and explaining why you would like it and how the diy scene interests you

I thought a hacksaw was like a normal saw

What would have happened if you came home carrying a saw one day when you were 14
