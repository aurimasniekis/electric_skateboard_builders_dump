Ronin cast trucks are changing model atm, was due to release mid Feb 2018.

So likely only old stock is around. I emailed Ronin the otherday asking about their wider 174mm axles for their billet trucks and Tony said they wont be doing them again as he felt 154mm was the new magic width... so I would expect the new cast Ronins to be narrower than 180mm,

If you need 180mm I'd jump on them quick!
