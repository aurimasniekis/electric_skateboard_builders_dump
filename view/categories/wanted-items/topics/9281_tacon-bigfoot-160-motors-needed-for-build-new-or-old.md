Fully aware these are scarce, and unclear if they are still being manufactured, I still need to track down 2 of these for a build. I barely missed @lever selling a pair last month, they went in like an hour lol. So have been on the hunt since then, anyone willing to sell a spare?

Are you still looking for these by any chance?
