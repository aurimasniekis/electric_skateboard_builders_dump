my current favorite budget motor mount is @Korryh's mounts.  Super well made and beefy, plus a fair bit cheaper.

GL!

Its because you have cheap shitty mounts from china and you're also using trucks that around round, get better motor mounts and use loctite.

Or you can try to shave down the truck, but still, get better motor mounts

I wouldn't know since I don't used them. But I haven't seen anyone complain. JLabs has sold me a bunch of good products so he's not here to scam us with graphics products

You should buy the truck separately

And those mounts are probably out of you $60 budget?
