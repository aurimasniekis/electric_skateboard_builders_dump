Looking for someone withing EU, Preferably Denmark, Germany Or England.


I have the Cells, all at the same voltage and a BMS all I need is the spot welding to be done and the connectors to be soldered.

They are from a Meepo Board pack taken apart since I need a flat 10s2p pack and not a double stacked.

An hour ago though but thanks, hoping to find someone from Denmark or Germany though.

Hard for me to ship to England, France or anywhere else due the 18650 Cells.

No :-) Ended up trashing the cells.

Not worth getting others to do since the price will be the same as a complete pack either way.
