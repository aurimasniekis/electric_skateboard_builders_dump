Thank you everyone who offered to lend a focbox. - I just do not have the time to baby sit enertion stock or vendor sites. I did however check and most were all out of stock or pre-order. Thankfully I only needed one. I was going to give up one of my focboxes for the potato for a repair/rebuild on a friend's board. But @Eboosted just got to the states with the Spud enclosures so wanted to replace it quickly to finish that build. 

@Acido thanks for mentioning hyper-ion

@hyperIon1   #1022 thank you sir.

@treenutter or @Namasaki splease close
