So you already have an enclosure it needs to fit?

Looks like they made a few different boards.

Probably gonna need a different enclosure. Looks like they didn't have much of a battery to begin with. 

Knowing the available space is important.

Pictures and measurements would help a lot.

Yes I would need an enclosure but I don’t mind building that or finding one.

Are all great battery builders. 
Can make something to fit your needs. 
Psychotiller even makes enclosures and usually gives a discount on them with a battery purchase.

But they would need to know what kind of space they have to work with.

I dont believe you when you say it is the biggest you can fit.  Technically as long as the enclosure is big enough and the wheels are big enough you can put any size on a board. I want to see a 12s9p on a board. :joy:  Can you imagine seeing something like this but on a board ![image|615x446](upload://zK7MbwkwMExRurFPILdlsNynMUa.jpeg)

Are you asking me that question I think...?

Range is so hard as everyone will tell you on here cause there's so many variables. I think real world range if I recall correctly I was getting around 13-15 on the 10s3 and a little more on the 12s3. But i used them with both urethane and pneumatic which changes a lot too so just hard to say. They're decent though.

If you buy bith if them I'd do a package deal for $400

 How much on just one of them I’d like both honesty but only need one for the moment. But love to make a second board.
