As the title say, im looking for a mtb for light offroading without any big jumps. I have my eye on MBS Core 94 for 300Â£ and decided to see if there is anything used and a bit cheaper here :D
So if you have any advice for where to look, or know someone who has used MTB, im all ears

Look for l-faster brand trucks and a generic mtb deck.
