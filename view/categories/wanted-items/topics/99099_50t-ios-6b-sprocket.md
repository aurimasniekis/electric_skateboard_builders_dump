Hello as the title mentions I'm looking for a 50T sprocket to fit super star hubs. I picked up a kit from over ion 10/35 to fit the Trampa treads 6.5' things changed and I upgraded my tyres to 200mm Mbs so I need a 50T to fit if anyone has 2 spare or know where I can get a couple that don't require any mods since I live in an apartment I don't have access to power tools to do so.
