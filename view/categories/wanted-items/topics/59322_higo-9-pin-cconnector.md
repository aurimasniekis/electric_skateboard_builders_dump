That was actually the 1st one I googled, but the shipping is ridiculous...

I didn't see that

Let me check with our manufacturer, I may be able to get you 2 of these for cheap, just not sure what shipping will be. Which bullet connectors do you need? And which sensor connector as well as their positions?

Thanks brother, I appreciate it.

3.5mm bullet connectors, male
JST2.0 sensor connector

Its the standard sensor wire position, 5v & Ground on the outside middle wires are auto sensed.  They will be connected to FocBox's if that helps any.  

@mikenyc said this back in february...

> hey, i helped a friend put these together over the weekend. the higo connector it comes with is pretty straight forward. the three hall sensor wires match the phase leads colors of the phase leads. that leaves the black and red wires which go to the ground and 5v pins. the only weird part is soldering on a bullet connector to the phase leads because the wires are really thin.

I think this is what you need. I'll ask for a shipping quote for 2 to Alabama and I'll let you know as soon as I have it. Should be less than $35 üòÖ

Could have sworn that Luna cycles carried them. I don‚Äôt see them on their site anymore. Maybe give them a ring?

I‚Äôve also seen them on Alibaba if you want to go that route.

Ive seen them on Alibaba and Aliexpress but its 20-30 days out, so I'd rather get them somewhere closer or at least somewhere that will ship out this month :).

Ill give Luna a call and see what they have to offer.  thanks

I got some from @PulseboardsJohn, I think @BoostedBuilder had some at one time too. You will have to solder the bullets and sensor wires on yourself though.

I can get them with bullets and sensors on and the male end as well but id assume i need a larger amount before its worth ordering.
