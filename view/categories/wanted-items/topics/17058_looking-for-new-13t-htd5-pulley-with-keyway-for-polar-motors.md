Do Polar motors have 8 mm shafts? If so, Trampa sells one: http://www.trampaboards.com/13-tooth-x-15mm-wide-motor-pulley-fits-into-trampas-electric-skateboard-motors-36-p-12855.html

Yes, they do. I'm not sure who sells a 13t motor Pulley in the USA.. How many teeth is your wheel Pulley? Your going to have a crazy reduction ratio.

We have **[13T HTD5](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/13t-htd5-motor-pulley-12mm/)** for 12mm belts with an 8mm bore. Not sure what diameter the shaft is for the polar motors.

Did you end up using a 13t? Belt slipping issues?

13/36T would lack of top end speed and belt slipping is crazy on 12mm belts.

I'm currently runing 15/36T on 15mm belts on a CRonin truck.
