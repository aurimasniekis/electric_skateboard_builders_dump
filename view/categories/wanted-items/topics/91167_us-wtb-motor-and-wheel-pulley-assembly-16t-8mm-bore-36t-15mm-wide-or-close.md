when i ordered them, the shipping only took about 8 days from the China to USA. 

It really is the best deal i have found yet.  even the belts are high quality.

one thing to note: the hole on the wheel pulley is to small for caliber trucks by about 2mm. i lightly filed down the trucks and solved it. It really is a small price to pay for such a cheap part. if you have access to a lathe you could easily fix it by boring the hole a bit wider
