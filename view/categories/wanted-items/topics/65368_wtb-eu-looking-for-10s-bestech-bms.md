Does anyone in Europe has a spare or used bms I can buy?
Preferably bestech because I have heard some good things about them.
With or without e-switch doesnâ€™t matter.

40 or 50 amps bms is preferred

Does anyone know some good sources to buy those new in Europe?

40 amps.
But with 50 amp bms I think the bms will run cooler
