Why do you need 4 plates to cover a single hole?

Also why not patch it with something like epoxy?

I used kydex and abs cement to patch a similar hole.

i have kydex but its super thin

one piece is meant to cover up the switch hole and the smaller hole while the shorter plate was only meant to cover up the small hole

A straight edge and a box cutter is all you need man

Take a few solid passes then crack it off. Sometimes old school is the best way

Dontz have that either... pretty sure stores don't let amateurs buy blades anyways, the last time i checked

But thanks for the advice anyways, im gonna stick to my original plan as printing a flat piece of plastic shouldnt be that hard or time consuming.

I can cut you two squares. My kydex is holding up well on the hole i covered.  Few coats of abs cement made it look pretty clean.

Put a piece of painters tape on the outside, fill it with hot glue, remove the tape after it cools then use a sharpie to make it black

Can do the same but with coloured epoxy/silicone. Suguru is a fast fix as well!

Why not go to a Hardware store, get a bit of epoxy, acrylic sheet, a hacksaw and sandpaper and make 2 pieces, one being a square piece and another being round. then glue them on top of each other. then put the circle side into the hole, and put epoxy on the square part so that it backs it and then glue. it's a $20 job

That looks better than any patch will ever look.  If you want it too look stock, that just aint gonna happen.  Maybe use a little paint over the glue.

Wire mesh tape behind the whole and fill it with Bondo or epoxy, sand it then paint it and you won't see a hole.
