What's the problem here? Maybe I'm missing something. Are you looking for them used or something? You're title is misleading if not. 

I got some for you here if you're looking for a new set https:///collections/longboard-trucks/products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks

Gotcha. I just wasn't sure. It seemed weird considering the title of your thread. Changed that for you to try and help with the purchase. Hope you find them soon.
