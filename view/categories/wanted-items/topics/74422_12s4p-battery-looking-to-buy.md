If you want 12s4p

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/brand-new-12s4p-400/71160

I can also let you pick from 4 different bms (two of them are still in the mail from bestech). Three of them are charge only and would come with a antispark switch. The one in the pics that is currently on it is a bestech and has a built in switch. The ones that are in the mail on the way here are micro bms so they will likely be ok for space.

That all being said, if your wanting a 12s5p then @psychotiller is your guy. Iâ€™ve bought from him on several occasions and heâ€™s very reliable.

I got mine from @hyperIon2 over at  https://hyper-ion-systems.myshopify.com/.  So far it's been holding up great!  You should be able to get a 30q 12s4p with the vedder anti-spark switch for around $440 or so.  Great customer service over there too!

I know I already mentioned this above but I figured itâ€™s worth saying

I lowered the cost of this and you can choose from a variety of bms to meet your size requirements if your still looking. Itâ€™s a quality built battery. Read the update on post 8
