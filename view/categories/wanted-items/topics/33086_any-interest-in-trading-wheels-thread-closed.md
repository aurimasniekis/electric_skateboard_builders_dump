So I have some Abec 11 97 MM Flywheels. Great condition, barely used. Basically just the side writing is worn. 
I'm interested in potentially trading for different wheels. I'd really like to trade down to 90 MM Flywheels, but other offers of equal value would be considered.
Let me know what you got!!

@bigben :joy: well said. 
@i2oadsweepei2 I'm not experiencing wheel bite because I'm not using  them on this build. I have some powerwheels on this build. Was saving these for the next build. Duel drive maybe carvon hubs on a drop deck. But i just thought I'd throw my feelers out there see if there's anybody that has 90's or something close that want to trade up.

You forgot to mention duro.
75a, 78a or 80a
it's an important factor

I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a bit larger wheels. 
Like you have 2 sets of kegels? 8 wheels?

@chinzw It was worth a try I guess. Haha. I'll have to pass. Incidentally, last night I found some 83 MM Flywheels on Canada's Craig'sList for $20!

I found some 90mm flywheels online brand new for $89 I may get them but are real flywheels that much better than the clones? Cause I have 90mm clones in 78a and the ones online are 75a

My experience is quite limited as I have just completed my first build. I upgraded from Enertion Powerwheels which are 83 MM and I believe 80a duro, to some flywheels of the same diameter but 75a duro. It's like riding on buttered velvet compared. Nothing against the powerwheels, and no idea what your wheels feel like, but i was astounded at the difference it made.
