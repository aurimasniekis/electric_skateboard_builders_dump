We have them they do seem to come loose but then it allowed us to get our boards up and running in double quick time and at a price we could afford. My advice aim to get out there riding it is great fun

@moderators is there a way to gag a user from posting new topics for a few weeks so that he can calm down and think about what he's done?

So far you have 3 days read time and you've asked us, with fresh topics every time, for the following:

1. Calibers
2. charger
3. keyway
4. loctite (seriously)
5. hub motors
6. motor fixing
7. vesc
8. bms wiring
9. remote
10. normal motors
11. how to make a battery

During all that angst you tried to sell us two shit boards and explained that you were better at building that the community here.

Honestly, take a step back and sort yourself out or you're going on the naughty cushion.

Seriously who do you think you are.
This isnâ€™t your forum to go boss us around if people really think that I was going overboard then they would say. You once were also a startup and had questions to ask. Itâ€™s the way it works.

It is not the way it works.

You are going overboard. 

Use the search.
Everything you ask form the many threads has been answered many times.
You will not be spoon-fed for much longer.
Have a little humility and people will run to help you.
Be a twat and you will be burnt.

It is, because 

a) He knows what he is talking about
b) He delivers his opinion in a colorful, entertaining, self-deprecating way

Hit those points and maybe one day you can own the forum too

But at least do your homework.

And if you donâ€™t like salt and want sweeties go to Reddit

People here will help you, hell, you're doing a really incredible thing. You're but a nipper and you're undertaking really cool project. Either just for fun or a workhorse of a transport device. 
Work out how to search a little, suggest what you have thought of yourself and ask for opinions then you may get a warner welcome. Just asking every step of the way won't help you in the long run.
Welcome to the forum and all serious questions answered!

You havent been here long enough to even begin to know how things work around here. And if @brenternet isnt being a twat, then something is terribly wrong. Do us all and yourself a favor, USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION. 

Thank you and buh bye
