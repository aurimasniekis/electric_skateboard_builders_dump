I will do it, but I have no idea what is a fair price. $30? What do other people charge?

My anti spark switch has been working with no issues for a couple months now(along with my battery and all other soldered/welded joints on my board), and I repair lots of electronics with cut up cables all the time. I use a Hakko soldering iron, heat shrink etc that gets the job done. I'm confident that I could make you a quality one for $40 shipped.
