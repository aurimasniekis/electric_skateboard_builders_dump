The front ones are in-stock right now

If the rear ones don't come back in stock soon you can probably find someone who has one already.

Thanks for the tip. I followed the link and browsed their website but could not find evolve trucks or any parts at all for that matter - only complete boards. Is there a particular place to go to find this?

Yeah, probably their website is only focused on complete boards, but believe me, they have both supercarve trucks. I bought two complete sets from them in two different ocasions in the past. Just call or email them and ask for trucks. Is easy.

I‚Äôm curious about the dpk trucks. I had some gullwing sidewinder 2s before and absoultely hated them so I wonder if the wider evolve ones are any better.
