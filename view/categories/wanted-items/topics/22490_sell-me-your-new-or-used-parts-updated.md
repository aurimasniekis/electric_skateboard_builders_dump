I'm building a board for a friend who is completely new to esk8, and has put me in charge of sourcing and choosing parts. He wants a simple and durable beginner board, I've got some of my own parts from previous builds but need the following items: 

- VESC 
- 190kv - 245Kv motor
- Motor mount (Purchased)
- Compatible Trucks (Purchased) 
- 36T Flywheel clone pulley (purchased) 
- 14-16T motor pulley (Purchased)
- 2.4ghz mini remote(Purchased)

I've checked online for the above items, just wanted to check on the forum to see if I could find a good deal here as my friend requested that the board be as cheap as possible. Also I'm located in Canada. Please PM me if you have any of these items available or know where I can get a good deal  :grin: !

Also thanks for the offer @Pathaim, but i'm trying to keep the cost low and dual vescs will probably out of his budget.

I've got a couple Torqueboards 190kV 6355s and a couple Maytech 230kV 6355s all of them unsensored. I also have a couple sets of Torqueboards mounts and 16/36 motor/wheel pulleys with belts along with 83mm yellow flywheels, 90mm blue flywheels and green, purple or black caliber trucks.

Most of it has relatively minimal use but some cosmetic damage. I'm located in Toronto, PM me if you want any of it.
