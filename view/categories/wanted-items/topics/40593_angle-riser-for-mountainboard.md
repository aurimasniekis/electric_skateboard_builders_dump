I used an adjustable angle base plate to mount my standard hanger on a mountain board deck. @okp has an adaptor that might work as well.

Khiro wedge risers. Or make your own angled risers from wood blocks.

If your deck is already at 20 degree angles on both ends, then you just need a 15 degree riser.

However, I am going to state here, if you are indeed using ATS trucks...then 20 degrees is the required angle needed for them, so angled risers aren't needed. The angle of 35 degrees is needed for spring trucks.

Thanks, it’s my Tiki mask. 
And by your location, I meant where do you live. 
I have a set of wedge risers that I don’t need. 
There brand new and you can have them for the cost off shipping if your in the USA

Although, they are 1/4” to 1/2” so they only add  4°
