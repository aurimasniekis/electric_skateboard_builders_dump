Hi everyone

I have access to professional soldering equipment and professional soldering workers + I'm pretty good at soldering myself.
as I understand, Lots of VESC's can be fixed by simply resoldering the DRV chip
I'm looking to buy one and try to fix it.
If some has a dead VESC and he's willing to sell to me? 
We'll work out something about the price/shipping of-course
maybe I'll start offer a service if all goes well

If someone from EU or maybe even Germany has one with bad DRV and wants to get rid of it, I would like to try my luck too.
