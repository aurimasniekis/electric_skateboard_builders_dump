I could rent it or buy it, but I need it ASAP.

Mine stopped working all of the sudden, it does not fire up, I need to send it to @aulakiria for inspection, but I need a spot welder to finish some projects.

Let me know if you have one.

I have one I am willing to sell - I am located in Orange, CA, USA so shipping should be fine. I have a battery pack for it as well but it is not sufficient for spot welding imo; I could sell that but tbh you need something with double the capacity.

I have the Soldering iron attachment as well. LMK.

Wow mine has been going strong and it was second hand. Are you putting a heat sink on the welder? What is blowing up maybe your welder can be repaired.
