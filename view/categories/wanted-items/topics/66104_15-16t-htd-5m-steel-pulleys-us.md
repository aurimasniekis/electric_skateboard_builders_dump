He only has 8mm... But if you can wait q month from china @dickyho has em and you could buy a couple different options while yur at it to.play with speed vs torque options... I'm a fan of 18/36 didnt notice any major hill climbing loss for the speed gain! 
"Eboard-shop" on eBay... Looks like 15t is his.only option right now but saw plenty of other metal kits on eBay some with US based shipping

I do have 14T steel pulley now,  this one is cheap, because it have been max producted.

I am planning to produce 15T, 16T, 18T  steel pulley now. hopefully with keyway.  just those need to custom make, and need big quantity,  so will be expensiver.  as I counted, need to sell 7.5-8us a piece on ebay, without shipping.

This is all because my $5 greed. lmao. I was gona get the dual 6354 for $60 each +$20ish shipping but found out they have 6364 for $75 each with the over $150 free shipping.
