I really want a gear drive for these beautiful trucks but trampa and kaly is killing me with 400-700 price tag. Is there any other options available now. I've searched the forum but I can't find where to buy. ![Screenshot_20190414-184248|250x500](upload://rqk9rOi1yphjWuaTnbuxs1fSuxD.jpeg)

If you want to jump on a public beta you can test out a drive for around $250 for a pair

![IMG_20190411_225634_389|500x500](upload://qT6cKqwQiF9mFVSBk5quO3MoRnK.jpeg) ![mmexport1555369612505|375x500](upload://dSQCBkKIdrVfBdPOhwXP2ufiKbr.jpeg)

A set well then I guess I'll need new motors for the other two. That's if I don't blow out these cheapo deapos on a test run of the new board tomorrow...
