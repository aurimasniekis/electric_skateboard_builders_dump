So I pretty much ruined my 9to5, which I really like, looking for a good deck to electrify, if you have some used or new and want to get rid of it send me some pics!

Located in Croatia :)

I'm also looking for a deck for my next build, I'd like a small deck with kicktail with a 20" wheelbase minimum, lightest as possible.

There are a few skateshops but all of them are a bit pricey and have a very small offer of products
