Thanks guys.  eBay and then J were my first two stops. :)  

MCHO enclosures are off-the-market, at the present time.

This is for a Loaded Blood Slayer that just arrived:

Good choice. Wish I could find another for my latest build. This enclosure has lasted 2 years. It's tuff as hell. Let me know if you're able to find one dude.

I always thought the shape suited the Loaded Unicorns.  The Blood Slayer is basswood (stiff) so the carbon fiber should be ideal.

plus the MasterCho is one of the few 'icons' that I don't have in the quiver.

top of mind, @bigben on the 13S Evo, @Eboosted enclosures on two more Evos and a Talon,  @psychotiller on the Carvon and the Mellow, @torqueboards on the Chupacabra and a few other enclosures.

 It's my own damn fault; I had that thing in my eBay shopping cart for 5 months sigh :expressionless: :)

@topcloud Are you still looking for one of these? I have one I can part with for a good price if you like this carbon weave style. I'm actually in the Santa Rosa area, but would probably still need to ship it unless you happen to be up in my neck of the woods.

Some more sanding and clear coat and this one is good to go!

Oh I don't, not really.  I just skin the ones psychotiller makes. Lol.

This one I made from nothing.  Such a PITA.  Only skinning for me here on out.  You don't want to know the money and hours into this... laughable.

I do want @psychotiller to make a plus sized Altar Wedge for the Xapham and 44s though!

Mmm. 12s6p.
