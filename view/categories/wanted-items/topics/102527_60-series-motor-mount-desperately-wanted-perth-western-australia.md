Those "vanpro" mounts are dangerous man, very thin brittle plate, imagine a snap at 25mph. 

We carry [paris style mounts here](https://nexusboards.co.uk/collections/mounts/products/dh-electric-skateboard-motor-mount) which would be shipped via 3-5 day mail (I think the shorter mailing times are prohibitively expensive) 

If you do choose to buy from us, please use the discount code "OUTSIDEEU" so you don't need to pay VAT.
