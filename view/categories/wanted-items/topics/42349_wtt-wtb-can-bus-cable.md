I need a can bus cable. If anyone has a spare I'd be willing to trade for or buy it for a reasonable price.

Doesnâ€™t it suck when you just need a can bus cable. Such a minor thing but it can drive you crazy without one.

where abouts can you buy these from, i need to get a couple for some FOCBOX Vesc's and im not sure what im looking for to make them plug and play nicely. i opted for this as i have a bluetooth module sitting here that i want to connect for some data to my phone.

Talk to @Mikenopolis he had some that you would just have to solder the leads together

I can make one. Where are you based and how long do you need?

Or just order the 4-pin JST-PH with wires from [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10-Sets-Mini-Micro-2-Pin-3pin-4pin-JST-XH-Connector-Plug-2-54mm-With-24AWG/32869189894.html) and solder two together (plus unpin or cut the wires at the sides).

Location in Australia Melbourne, i need to connect 

2 FocBox Vesc for 2 separate boards, so i believe 2 cables?

I was also wondering where people are getting there motor sensor cables from to connect to the FOCBOX Vesc

Thanks i might order from that link as i can make them to size accordingly. its just 2 male leads i need which i can solder together and wrap in some heat shrink thanks heaps!

I'm in EU. I would be happy to make one for you for free since the parts cost nothing and it's a 5 minute job, but the shipping to Australia would probably be crazy. You may be best off getting the parts from China and make one yourself. Just solder two together. Or even better, get crimping pliers and JST-PH crimps.

Sounds good. Just make sure you don't cross the wires. It's LOW<->LOW, HIGH<->HIGH.

yeh thats the plan i was going to buy the connectors for 7 euro each from a store, since i only need 1 per board i didnt mind and they also had the Motor Sensor cables but the shipping cost x1.5 times the order cost. was ridiculous. now i have the Bus connector sorted. i need to find out where i can get these motor sensor cables from for the FocBox Enertion dont sell them anymore since they discontinued that product...

yeh, cable needs to be parallel so both sides are the same when you connect them, but ill look up a guide just to be 100% when i get everything in for my electronics
