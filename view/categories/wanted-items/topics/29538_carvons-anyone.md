Not sure. I think they were $300 new. So probably around $150 depending on how things are going. There might be a number of people selling once they get ahold a the v3's.

It's a single and I'm not sure the HP. I power it with an Enertion Space Cell3. It's a 10S battery pack. I weigh 135lbs and the single has plenty of power for me. The range with a lot of uphills and rougher streets is around 20 miles. On mainly flats I get into the high 20's.

If I recall correctly each carvon V2 was rated for 2600 Watts peak per motor.

Don't remember exactly. My single V2 doesn't have a lot of torque or brake power. You have to push start it and foot brake if you want to come to a dead stop. On the other hand it has very little motor resistance so if feels close to a regular board when pushing and if your cruising without power. It does have steady power all the way and will take you pretty fast. In terms of feel, it's my favorite setup.
