Hi all,

I am in the market for a relatively high power battery pack (preferably 12s) and 2-4p.  

My first choice right now is a torqueboards 12s4p battery pack (as it comes with an enclosure and charger for $450) but I am looking for one either way; if anyone has one for sale please let me know!

Yes; sorry shipping to US.  I am willing to pay shipping depending on the item, cost, and location of course.

Edited the title a bit. :slight_smile:\
But since you are in the USA you have access to some great battery builders like @thisguyhere .

@hyperIon1 has built me one battery and building me another now. Communication is great and he is a really nice guy to work with.

Appreciate it; i'm open to a lot of options currently, my last pack was a 11s5p pack I built from cheap chinese hoverboards cells which I ran over a hundred cycles through... original range was just shy of 20 miles and now it goes maybe 3.  Best $150 of batteries i've ever purchased, but I am in the market for a high quality zero maintenance pack (with BMS, single plug charging, preferably with an enclosure, etc) as I am in the final years of college and I don't have time to make another pack myself and I use my board often.

I'll reach out to anyone who thinks they might be able to help me; I have a sector 9 meridian board so there is plenty of real estate to work with.

Thanks for the suggestions

The TB 12s4p is a great battery choice ive been using one for a long time the range and power are really good. The only draw back i can see is the double stack configuration gives you clearance issues on some decks. 

Now dont rely on the included slow charger its a good back up but its way too slow. If you dain your battery to 20% or lower then you wont be 100% till the next day. 16 hours took me to charge once. The 4a charger will cut down that time to a more manageable 3.5h from dead to full.

Yes the 2 amp charger is god awful but the pack is good. The included enclosure is a bit generic though.

Oh, good to hear it is a good choice.  Are there any particular short comings/annoyances you have noticed outside of the slow charging and thickness?  Is the weather stripping/hardware high quality; ie does it stay relatively water proof?

It seems like for $450 it is a great deal considering it includes a charger, 60A BMS and enclosure.

How do you think the lifespan is on the pack?  Ie, how long do you think it will last me under normal use?  I run a single 3300W 6374 w/ VESC and while I don't bash on it I don't baby my board either and it gets a lot of use per year.

Been ragging the hell out of mine since late 2017 still works perfect and has many many miles on it. I dont use it often anymore only because i made a much bigger battery so i never have to charge on group rides.

I've put almost 1k miles on mine and so far no noticeable capacity decrease. Only had it for about 6 months though so not really long enough to see more. It's been a good pack to me!

Id say you're good with 3-4 years of normal-heavy use.
