I want a dependable skateboard that is all terrain wheels if possible with a acceptable amount of range (i live in nyc but spend a lot of time in long island) pls give me a final offer. If you have a picture it would be nice. pls comment to tell me if it is a good deal or not because even though I have a general idea and bought a diy skateboard b4 I am rather new to the scene.
edit: I will need probably a minimum of 20 miles as a round trip is 15 miles-ish at around 25 miles per hourish (25 shouldnt be the top spd but rather spd it can accelerate and brake at fairly quickly)

Gets about 10 aggresive miles... More for cruising... I'm retrospect id probably build a 5p battery instead of 4p knowing how much i lile to ride and for how long...

If you want to make it yourself, I have the trucks/wheels/motor mounts for an AT build I can let go at a decent price

Dude, I know you'll be able to get what you're after sometime on this forum...

but if you can somehow up your budget $500, this will leave you with no regrets I bet.

looks great can i need probably optimally 20 mile range min to be safe and ill probably be riding around the spd around 25 miles. I can't really see the trucks but my first skateboard has a huge problem with the suspension when it rides on gravel ... that is y i need new board. Although i am looking around something used with 100-200 miles on it so i know everything works and gives me a bigger bang for my buck. Can i get quote. (the reason y i said optimal i am not sure if i can charge it for as long as I would like in addition I can shorten my last couple miles by riding transit even though i prefer not to)

Look for something like a 10s6p to 10s7p battery (650Wh), that should get you 26ish miles on pneumatics

I'll drop u a line.. But for 20mi on pneumatics youd need like a 6p or maybe more with 30q ... U could probably fair ok with less with a 20700 call but they cost more =\ this is always the battle lol
