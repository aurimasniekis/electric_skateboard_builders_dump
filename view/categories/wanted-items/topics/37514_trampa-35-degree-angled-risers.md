35 degree machined aluminum risers from UNiK? i do. 

They're expensive though. I need to dump them, i'm not planning on doing anymore trampa style boards because want to focus on street builds. 

$200 for a set of two, shipping included (if you're in the US). I have 3 sets left i think.

not much i'm sure since its not a hazardous material and they don't weigh much and can fit in a small box. If i had to guess i'd say around $25. I'd have to weigh them and take an address from you to be certain. 

shipping inside the US should be less than $10 for priority mail, i'm pretty sure about that, which is why i'm shipping for free to anywhere here.
