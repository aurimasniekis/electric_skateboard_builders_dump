Hey guys,

currently riding a Bamboo GTX and guess what, the range sucks :slight_smile:

I'm looking for an AT board with at least 30 miles real world range (92kg + 10kg backpack).
Landyachts Evo or Lacroix deck style preferred. EU based would be nice, because of VAT and customs. I'd have to pay like $3.755 for importing a La Croix....

I don't know if I would be capable of building one myself.... (I only have some experience with building electric helicopters :joy: )

If somebody has something to sell which fits my need or knows somebody, just hook me up with a message! 
Would be greatly appreciated!

Regards
Dominik

Yeah, was thinking the same and I'm still waiting for a response from "kevindark" for a 10S8P pack.
Just wanted to look for other options :slight_smile:

Better don‚Äôt get a battery from him if you don‚Äôt want to rebuild it directly again.
If you want a well made pack in the EU ask @pjotr47 he‚Äòs doing a great job.

Optional you can get a prebuilt trampa and get a battery from the guys I said or just get lipos as option.

I agree with Andy, Kevin isnt the man for these kinds of things anymore. @pjotr47 will sort you out nice and proper :+1:

 @Andy87 @Sn4pz
Thanks for this tag! 

A 10s8p upgrade is possible.
But you need to think about: is it worth to do such a expensive upgrade for you board. Sometimes it is better to sell your board and start with a new :slight_smile:

Exactly what I did, I was either going to trick out a Trampa deck and risk imperfections ruining it, or buy a kaly deck.... goodbye Trampa :drooling_face:

Yeah, that's what I thought, too!
The GTX isn't bad at all..but if I see all that Lacroix, Landyachts and other custom beauties....

The main problem is to find someone who is actually selling something well-built AND in my price scope (max. $2700) AND is in the EU... (that VAT, customs is killing every overseas boards)

The only reasonable board I found yet, is the Eskating Dual Beast Evo 12S5P version. But it's going to be like $2500 and a lot of waiting time. What do you think? Don't know if this board can carry my heavy ass to the 60km mark!

I don‚Äôt want to take your illusions, but with pneumatic wheels you can calculate about 20wh/km minimum (i need more likr 30wh/km), so 60km would need a battery with as min 1200wh. This would mean a 12s10p with 30q cells round about.

Skaterboy58 built a variant of Lacroix with "13-14 Wh/km consumption".

Then it would be around 900wh. But whatever, that would be my scope! :slight_smile:

On urethane or pneumatics? I‚Äòm ready to believe, but I want to have a proof for that üòÇ

I don‚Äôt see any data logs. Maybe I just have overseen that. Not gonna start a trouble over that. If people get 14wh/km on pneumatics than ok that‚Äôs cool. I can just speak about my own experience and that‚Äôs definitly double of it. Maybe my riding style is so different from his (what‚Äôs pretty likely üòÖ) or my tires not pumped up enough...üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ but I think I can say if you drive that power saving you either pretty light and slowly driving or you just invented the pneumatics super hix drive üòú

I do most off the time 18wh/km on my trampa. My weight is only 70kg. Rinsing style is not crazy but also not that normal/boring. 
If I keep it normal I can do 14wh/km. if I go really crazy I do 25wh/km

That sounds like the perfect amount of experience to competently build an electric skateboard as well :slight_smile:

If you do decide to go that route, I have a Hummie deck with a double stack enclosure I could sell you for 200‚Ç¨ + shipping. I bought it for a bit less because it was a good deal, but I wouldn't mind changing my build plans if someone wants it more than me :stuck_out_tongue:

I just don‚Äôt want to see another guy telling his board a la sag üòÖ i don‚Äôt say 14wh is impossible, just üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If that‚Äôs the range I aim for I would rather calculate with a value that is more average than with a value that is pretty much maxed out on the min scale. Still think that 20wh as average consumption is a good point to start with.
