Looking to buy a 10s or 12s prebuilt battery. Also interested in picking up a dual 6.6 or dual focbox (unity too if someone would like to part with theirs). 

Located in Canada! Thanks in advance.

I make packs here in the U.S if you're interested. I charge a rate of $140 for labor per pack and you pay what I pay for material. I also use pcb's for a clean, professional and safe battery pack you can count on. DM me for more info.
