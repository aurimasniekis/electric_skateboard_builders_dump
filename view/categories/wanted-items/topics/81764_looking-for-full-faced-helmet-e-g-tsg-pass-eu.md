Hi guys

I got my board working but have no helmet yet. I've heard some good things about the tsg helmets but I am open for other offers too. if you have got a barely used or new full face helmet I would be happy to buy it from you.

have a nice day! üòÅ

Many places in the EU sell TSG. I believe they are an EU company to begin with.

mmmm Apples & Pears, the price is not even that advantageous. I guess Olders are kind of certified? By the IDF whatever that means, testing criteria? 

TSG Pass: 
**CERTIFICATION**:	EN 1078, ASTM F1952
Developed and engineered in conjunction with three-time world downhill skateboard champion and product designer Martin Siegrist

New Olders -
First brazillian helmet within the safety requirements of the International Downhil Federation (IDF).

We are the first and only Brazilian company to make Downhill helmets with international safety certificate (tests made in the USA in our Super Race 2013 model). 

Whats are the actual certifications? Are the IDF set up to actual make conformity tests on helmets?
'within the safety requirements' mmmm, ok


Edit: Found it!
https://internationaldownhillfederation.org/2015/updated-helmet-requirements-2015/

Basically if the helmet has polystyrene inside, it's certified by the IDF!!!
