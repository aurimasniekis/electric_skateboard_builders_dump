Hobbyking's zippys. Don't buy used lipos.

You want all the cells in the batteries to have the same wear level and roughly same chemistry so you don't have half the cells dropping voltage more quickly and leaving the remaining higher voltage cells doing all the work.  You likely won't get a great deal used unless you plan to pick them up and the previous wear on them will be unknown.  Typically lipos will get 300-500 charge cycles but you'll have no idea how far into those cycles used batteries are.
