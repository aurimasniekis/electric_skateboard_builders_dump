Hi all,
I am curious where the best place to get my VESC from? I am going to make an electric long board,
The battery pack is going to be 10s. BTW I am from the United States. I would defiantly like to be local. Not just because I like buying from US, but I don't want it to have free shipping then take a year to get to me.

Do a little research on the forum to find whats best for you.
Take a look at Enertion's FocBox or maybe flipsky.

Edit: It also depends one the rest of you setup what else you using??

This is the _only_ VESC; the V6 is a single-motor controller (purchase two VESCs, for two motors):

This is our forum owners' dual ESC, it can control _two_ motors:

As others have stated here, there are many other single- and dual- ESC options for your research, all reviewed here on our site, available at your convenience.

good hunting!

Trampa Boards, they ship super fast to the US...Vesc 6 , probably best choice of the market, own two of them with 12S lipo's for each one...
