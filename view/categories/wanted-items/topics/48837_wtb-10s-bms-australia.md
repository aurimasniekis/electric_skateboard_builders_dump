Preferably looking for Bestech 10s 80a discharge (HCX-D223V1), but at the moment happy to get hold of anything 10s - even just charging. Anyone local (australia) able to help?

Im in Perth - happy to pay shipping, but safe to say im not going to be able to pick up. 

All the ones on ebay are shipping from china - I dont really want to wait for 3-4 weeks. I actually have started talking with bestech, but have yet to get any idea of shipping time, but Im not holding my breath - hence asking on here.
