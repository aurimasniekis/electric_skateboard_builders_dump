You are on an esk8 **builders** forum. There is more than enough information, just build your own! It'll save you money as well. Here's a link to an easy DIY guide: http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Electric-Skateboard-Extremely-Simple/

if you want cheap get one from China.  E-go or similar.

if you want to build your own - you are in the right place.  Start reading up on builds and figure out what you need.

GL!
