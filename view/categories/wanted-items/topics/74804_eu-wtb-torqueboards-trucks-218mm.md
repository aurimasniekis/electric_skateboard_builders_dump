Greetings!

I hope any fellow Europeans have bought a bit more than a single pair of TB 218mm trucks. :smirk:

I would gladly give them a nice loving home, for a price.

Shipping would be to Vilnius, Lithuania.

I will get back to you after I receive mine to be sure(drop me a PM so I don't forget). Maybe I just got goofed, but most likely not. :slight_smile:

That's what I thought too. Let's just wait(~1week shipping) and see I guess. Fingers crossed. :smiley:
