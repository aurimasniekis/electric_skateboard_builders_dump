Hello, does anyone have a spare 14t steel 15mm motor pulley by chance. Need one or more if have them. If you have 12t or 13t might be interested also. Located in the US.

Not to hijack, but I'm about to hijack: how about 40t-44t wheel pulleys (for Evolve ABEC 107s)?

@Titoxd10001 did you ever find the 14T  pulley?

I'm also looking for this or a 44T wheel pulley.

@Eboosted  Yeah torqueboards has some but not listed. Had some before from forum member but he no longer sells them. Running 14/44 actually but I think I'll be needing 6374s for even better brakes. 44t is 3d printed with insert bearing but still screwed on
