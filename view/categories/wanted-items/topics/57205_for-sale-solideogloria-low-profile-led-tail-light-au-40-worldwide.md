**Tail Light:** _Low-profile_. _Waterproof_. _Super bright_ and _slim_. Wire routes from the centre and runs under the trucks to the enclosure. Coated in a glossy black epoxy. Mount with hot glue, or similar. Powers either via. a voltage step-down regulator (not included, ~$5) which lowers the voltage to sends ~12v to the lights, instead of whatever high voltage your battery has (e.g. 25v), so the lights don't burst and burn, OR a separate 12v battery.

_**$30 each**_. Comes with long wires.
+ +$5 for each extra LED light (Custom designs)
+ +$5 for plugs: Bullet, XT90, XT60, etc.
