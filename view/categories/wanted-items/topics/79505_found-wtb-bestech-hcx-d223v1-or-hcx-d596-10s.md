Hey as the title suggest I want to buy a Bestech HCX-D223V1 Or HCX-D596 10s, I'm having a hard time finding one in the US for some reason. and BKB doesn't have them anymore, along with the bms I'm also looking for a power switch that goes with it.

*reason for buying this bms, just had a flipsky switch float on me today. Permanently ON
