If you're mounting to the enclosure abs won't cut it. You need fiberglass or carbon fiber.

Whatever you get to cover the size of battery you‚Äôre looking at it‚Äôs gonna be a chunk. There‚Äôll be no hiding it with curves as the mounting area and the depth you need to attain straight after is tight. 
Jump on the custom enclosure for $75. That‚Äôs a steal. 
Try to get some pictures of some past works.

He skins what's already there.  Doesn't change the shape.  Also (please correct me if I'm wrong @Sender ) but it looks like that enclosure is gonna end up with some really straight angles like @bigben was saying.  Won't that make skinning more difficult?

it could be possible to change the shape a little (just a little by sanding)

If you're getting it made out of fiberglass, unless there's an excess of material the difference In-Shape sanding will do will be minimal at best.

Yeah, skinning doesn't change shape like @Skunk was saying.

Also, definitely check out his work, because that i super cheap.  A fucking steal if it is well done.

Those corners are going to be a little tough to skin, and I charge more to skin something than that costs to get a one off...  

So there is that.
