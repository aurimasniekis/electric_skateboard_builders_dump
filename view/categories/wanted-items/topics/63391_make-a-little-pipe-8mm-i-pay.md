Does it need to be strong? I can 3D print one for you, but have no idea if it is going to be put under stress or not..

Not a problem, just mentioned it. 
Do you know how to use a 3d software? If so, make a quick sketch and try 3dhubs.com, their prices are sometimes good.

You can use 3dhubs.com all over the world! They find CNC shops which are closest to your location : )

Look up airsoft pipes! They sell "precision barrels" that go from 6.01mm and up with different outer diameters. Could save you a euro or two.
