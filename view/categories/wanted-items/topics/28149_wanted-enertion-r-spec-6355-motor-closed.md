Theres a guy on the Uk-esk8t page on Facebook who has a lot of stuff for sale. He has a dual drive setup for sale with a pair of maytech 6355 motors which have been said to be the same motor? I can try to get you in touch if you were interested?

Go to the website of unikboards, the motors are from the same factory (maybe by maytech i guess) @okp

I've got an r spec 6355 already but I need another one to make it dual drive. It's cause my other one broke and so I would like the same one. But if it's exactly the same and I can use it along side with my current one then hit me up.
