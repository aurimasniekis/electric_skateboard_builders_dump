Does anyone have one and don't need it anymore?
Im searching for one here because I can not afford to buy a new one (80e +shipping) because of Christmas and a broken car... 
Anyways if you have one to sell how much do you want?

Have you checked how much it would cost to build one, you can buy just the PCB, the bom is on GitHub
