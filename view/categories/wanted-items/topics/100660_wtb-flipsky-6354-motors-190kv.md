Looking for a pair of new or lightly used Flipsky type canister black motors. From SoCal. Tired of waiting for their so called promotions. PM me if you got some.

Next big promotion will probably be either an autumn sale or likely a large sale on black friday

Thanks buddy. Just wondering if there are good reviews on those? I have blue enertion r-specs now and tired of them 3 wires shortening. Too much time consumption to repair :rage:

The motors are rarely more than $5 off. They are already sold at extremely cheap prices with very little profit.

Not really. They're not made by flipsky and at bulk they're quite a lot less than the price on flipsky's website. Last black friday they had 50% off pretty much everything but they used those older C6374s then.

Yes I read a thread about Flipsky's motor having loose magnets but only from the larger 6374 motors and not the 6354s. I just like their stealthy look. Can anyone that owns these motors give me some feedback? I also looked into the HobbyKing's SK8s but I don't want to change out my trucks as they aren't really 6354/6355.

Well the newer H ones look nicer, better sealed and I've been running them (From the manufacturer though with minor changes, but hopefully similar) without issues. But its at scale that issues pop up, but I haven't heard any negatives yet and they've been out for a few months.

No, flipsky ones. Apparently SK8s have gone downhill recently and aren't really as good value :/ There are some posts here if you search for them

Ah OK, i see what you're talking about. Those H versions have a 10mm shaft. I actually like the older version: BLDC Belt Motor 6354 190KV 2450W for Electric Skateboard

They seem to be better designed than the Torqueboard's 6355 motors.

They're not, TB ones are better for sure. More power packed into the same can size and a better reliability record.

They are made by freerchobby and in bulk prices they sell for $32 each, and they dont have sensors. They will add sensors in bulk for $3 per motor. 

I know this because i recieved there pricing list when i was planning a possible group buy.

I will have to delete this post soon though. It is technically confidential information. Surely giving away 1 price without stating MOQ or custom brand labelling costs doesnt violate it too much....

I notice they have 2 styles. The TorqueBoard style is the old style? The all round sleek model are the newer ones? Thanks @Dirt_Bag for those. Would there be any group buy in the near future? I've done GBs before!

And yes, the FS ones are the newer model with a top retainer ring on the magnets as well as tighter stator clearence for better efficiency and more torque. The first time FS had them they sucked though. The bearings would break and magnets were low temp and would demagnetize with heat. Now they have been fixed.

On a side note, if you see cheap flipsky motors on sites like aliexpress or banggood, they are the old models being gotten rid of. They are not worth buying anywhere but from flipsky.

I'm particularly looking for this style.

Anyone have a good idea how to prevent them Enertion RSpec motors' phase wires inside the canister from touching each other? I can only do the shrinkwrap so much within the plate :frowning:

Thanks bud. I am looking it up. Can I get these at just a HD/Lowes? I think it would fix them once and for all. I did have an old VESC short out because of this ongoing problem.

A lot of drama happened a few months back with censorship and privacy issues.
Basically the community needed a forum that wasn't run owned and operated buy a esk8 company. 
 is funded by  its members via donations.

Idk.... that stuff seems like it would wear out over time.  The Conformal Coating drys strong.
And can be used on other stuff as well. Waterproofing and what not.

Honestly @b264 would be a better person to ask what type is best for your situation. 
Maybe tag him and ask on ? 
Maybe in the noob question thread. 
Hes not on builders much anymore. 
I only have this stuff and know of it because of him.

@c4Lvin I've been using them for a few weeks now. Dont have anything bad (yet) to say about them. Almost no heat and good specs :slight_smile:

Open it up. The the magnets are just glued to the walls its the old version. If it has a retainer ring at the top of the motor its the new kind

Yeah those look great! have you had other motors and how do you think they compare? I love duals, i actually thought about one size smaller 5065s? to get even better range. SoCal doesn't have huge hills like SF, etc.

I've had aps. One got unbalanced at the shaft cus of a single rock and another lost magnets in about 3 weeks. 
Can't talk for other motors or sizes, I'm not at the point yet. Just finished my first true build

![image|375x500](upload://uLeXHWWKx5PMstHyk8RTnKyNXS4.jpeg) 6374 looks like this these days, not like the ones shown on their website, it must be an old design or something like that.
