As the title suggests I am looking to buy Two enertion 190kv 6355 motors. I am half way through a build but the Enertion store is all sold out for the holidays. I live in the US encase shipping is an issue. 

Let me know if you can help me out. 
Happy New Year

I second the above comment. I have two of these 6355's on my mountainboard build, and I've been absolutely shredding them for the past couple months with zero issues.

I also have two R-SPEC's, and can't tell a difference in performance between them and @JLabs motor.
