**Links to pulleys for 9,12 and 15mm belts are below** 

So @sl33py asked for a bunch of larger pulleys for gearing down higher voltage set ups and so here is a mass dump.  The reason these thread right into the print vs using a nut is because with the kegels on my caliber trucks I couldnt find a way to mount the pulley using the existing holes that would provide enough clearance as to not hit the hanger with the mounting hardware.  I also didnt want to cut off a piece of the brand new trucks either so I got to work instead.

So these can be used without making modifications to caliber trucks, just bolts to the wheel. 

The 44T is a little on the large side I feel. Its roughly 69mm in diameter which leaves 5.5mm clearance to the pulley from the ground, before you put a belt on it.  So if you intend to use it just be mindful of that.

I will also be releasing the odd numbered pulleys (35,37,39,41,43) later on since I have to model the pulley for those instead of just downloading a CAD model from online and modifying which I havent started. I'll see if I can do those next weekend.

I'm gonna post a few of @mccloed 's pictures since I'm at work and dont have any here to post as a final result after printing.  The ones shown are the 36T 9mm belt by the looks of it.

With the built in thread, I found I would strip the tread pretty easily.
how are you pulleys holding up?
The one you just added with the bolt and nut looks very nice. Is there any clearance left? or does it tap the caliber trucks a bit?

@oriol360  Well I messed up my controller before I hit like 40-50 km but it's was all very slow speeds around where I live. But it held up okay. 

These ones do have clearance issues with the caliber trucks both I and II.  

There's pictures on the thingiverse link that I can't upload from my phone.  So these work with any trucks that have hangers which are 21mm diameter  or less. 21 is the absolute MAX, 20 would be better for more clearance. 

The link shows a highlighted side profile of the trucks that you'd have to grind/file down to to use with caliber trucks. Alternatively, you could also file down one side of the nut down to just before nylon the lock ring to give yourself more clearance which is what I'm probably going to do.

Pics are in the link.  Once I'm at my desk I'll put them on here.

The original radius of the Caliber trucks IS 21mm so in theory if you manage to center it perfectly, it'll work. But nothings perfect. So the blue profile is a ~20 mm circle superimposed overtop for a good clearance.  You'll have to go 1 inches or 25mm deep from the edge of the hanger to provide enough clearance to allow for the wheel to sit properly against the truck hanger.

This is what the profile will look like without modifications. Notice the nuts barely clear the hanger on the curved surface and would hit the corners.

I'm not going to print all of these but for reference for fitment on the kegel wheels, this is what they sizes will look like printed on your set up. The clearance between the back of the wheel and the belt is 1.5mm and if you do not want the integrated flange, just offset the print by 1.5mm and it will start printing at the teeth portion.

15mm Belt

@JuniorPotato93 Thank you for your amazing contribution in this community. 
For the pulley with the build in thread that doesn't require nuts, what bolts are you using? Thanks!!

```
@kingbing Same bolts as the ones that require a nut. Just using different  tolerances. The whole is printed to accept 10-24 or a 10-32 tap. If you dont have a tap, just look up what the tap drill is for either bolt and find the closest drill bit you have, without going over, and drill the holes out. 

Which is better in this application? The 10-24. There's 24 theads per inch vs 32 threads per inch. But doesn't more threads mean more hold? Not necessarily.  It depends on the material. The Pitch of a thread P is 1/24th for 10-24 or 1/32th for 10-32. The way thread depth is defined is P/2  so the 10-24 engages the plastic 1/48th of an inch and 10-32 only engages 1/64th which is very very little. If this were a much harder material, it wouldn't matter so much but because plastic doesn't keep a thread if it's very small, try to go for the 10-24 if you can.

I was planning to do this once I figured out how to design this for the kegel effectively first since I can test  it.  I don't have a set of Flywheels so my plan is to use the mating potion  of a 36tooth flywheel pulley that's already available on Thingiverse and proven to fit, and then create the tail end of the pulley in 36,38,40,42,44 at the 3 belt widths and just swap the pulley portions and save the assemblies as one solid body in an STL that prints as one piece. I think that would be the quickest and effect way of doing it from what I've learnt doing all these ones.

If you can link me to a Thingiverse or other STL file that you or others have printed and mates well I can start with that and I'll make both options again, without the nut and with the nut for those who want some extra security.

These won't be like enertions ones where you have to cut off a piece of the hanger to hold it in place. Unless that's what you guys want but it would still require bolts since the print planes are in the same plane as the shear stresses and studs would most likely break off either during hard acceleration  or breaking.

This one seems to have a lot of makes. And likes. Has anyone got a any experience with these? I'm thinking I'll add 34 and 32 to the line up as well.  For these and the kegels judging by some older commentary as I went digging through this place.

The Abec 11 ones you referenced are my go to for 40t. Unfortunately, when the creator made the 36t he made the teeth too shallow. I edited the 36t here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1714204
I also created a 32t for Abec11's with a different hub here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1704197

I still think your design might work better, though. @JuniorPotato93, Definitely let me know when/if you make pulleys for the Abec11's. :grin:

Yeah I'm going to make them for the abec 11 fly wheel and clones.  Just haven't had a chance to start them. But I'll be using that STL to get the mating portion since I don't yet have clones and then make 32-44 in 9,12,15 mm belt widths. I'll make sure the teeth are full depth.

Actual Abec11's have the "thin" hubs as do most 90mm and above clones(so I have found). Most of the 83mm clones have the "thick" hubs. I mostly use the "thick" hubs. The "thick" ones have worked for both but if you use them on crappy clones they tend to break the hubs.
```

## \#21 Posted by: JuniorPotato93 Posted at: 2016-08-13T18:31:42.532Z Reads: 196

```
Okay,  So the "thick" portion is the the wheel hub itself not the studs on the stl, that is to say the "thick" hub STL version has a stud that is smaller in dimensions and will fit into both the original "Thin" hubs as well. 

I'm using your STL file from [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1714204) as the mating portion of the wheel pulley.  I cant actually "use" the file itself but I spent some time and made an exact replica of everything but the pulley itself. Now I've started the process of inserting the pulley from another source file and merging and doing the 9, 12 and 15 mm versions. I tried making these from 32-44 but 32 is too small. The nuts would mess with the teeth of the pulley so I'm doing 34-44.

the 21 and 17mm disks are just as a reference so you know how big your axels are. you;ll need a minimum of 21mm clearance if youre going to use the hux nuts on the backside . thats all it is. if you have caliber trucks you'll have to file down the edges, if you have paris or others you probably wont been to. you could also put socket head cap screws in from the backside and that will reduce the clearance you require

I have 200 miles (320km) on my PETG pulley so far.  Pulley is wearing very slowly and looks like it will hold up for a long time.

I printed the threaded version.  Drilled and tapped it.  I have to tighten the pulley bolts every so often.

PETG is easier to print than ABS and should hold up well in this type of application.  Print it hot (230-250C) with a 70-80c bed and no fan.  I did 80% fast honeycomb infill.  Print slowly with PETG otherwise your extruder stepper may skip and u'll get under-extrusion.  Material is very thick.

PLA might get too hot in the summer heat or just from belt friction and distort/melt.  Don't know for sure.

Every 200 miles or so just check to make sure they are tight, and don't strip them out over tightening (tighten by hand and feel).  They hold up well with 10-32 coarse threads.  Drill first then tap slowly by hand backing out every so often to clean off the plastic debris.  If you tap using a drill you will likely melt the plastic with heat.

The nut version requires some grinding on square caliber 2 style trucks, so I haven't tried them yet.  If the nut holding area gets rounded over, there is no good way to tighten them, so it's a horse a piece (drilling/tapping then possibly stripped threads on the basic version or grinding trucks and possibly stripping the nut holder on the nut version.)  Both will get you riding though.

Did anyone experience a pulley that will not center with this 3D files?
I printed 4 of these (the 32T pulleys) and each one of them is getting out of center when it spins, 
causing the belt to drive like crazy and go back and forth. 

Can someone please share his success/failures with these pulleys? I might do something wrong here.

Any chance of getting the design files @JuniorPotato93? I want to convert them to metric M6 screws.
