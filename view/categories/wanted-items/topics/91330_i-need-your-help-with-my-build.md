What’s wrong with your list? Maybe just add some links of the components you already choose and we can say you if it’s good or not?

Different people would recommend you different lists. 

For motors and batteries hobbyking is a good start point. There you can also get all the cables connectors and other tiny stuff you will need. 

Maybe also to use an other remote than the nano x.

Which gearing you will go for? Which terrain you want to drive in? 190kV could be too much depending on what you looking for.

One hour visited. 

Buy a metro board if you can't be bothered to read and learn, your board will never work.

Maybe take a look at this thread. These are good parts, good prices and in my experience great sellers. Everything is together in a kit, but for the small fee it may be better for you to go the prebuilt option they offer. 

Good luck.

this is a diy forum where people are happy to help. this is not a forum where people design your board for you because you cant be bothered to do the research yourself correctly

Yeah, we are more than happy to grade your homework and find mistakes, but we won't write your essays for you! ;P

I suggest finding a deck and enclosure, that will give you an idea of how much space you have for batteries.

Are you in Greece?

1500€ will probably not be enough for a mountain board.

You are fortunate to have caught the attention of 2 of the primo emtb guys here to be honest and that means you now need to do some work to justify their time.  
Link what you want to use and then think about what you might need to get it all to work together.
Do you know how to link sites?  Not an insult, just an inquiry.
The best thing to do is to find a build thread that most covers what you want to build and study it.  Ask your questions of the builder.  Find out what mistakes he made and how he corrected them.  
Good luck my friend.

After reading your post it almost sound to me like you’re demanding a list of parts to build your board!    As stated by someone else here.   People are more than happy to HELP you just need to ask politely   Good luck brother

Sorry bro, I don't do Facebook.
I am in Athens.

The reason I wrote 1500€ might not be enough is that a lot of items (eg unity) come outside the EU and with import taxes etc they end up costing a lot more.

Plus some of the items in your list are not a good choice for a eMTB (eg hypa hubs)
