I just need a custom enclosure made for an extended battery for a boosted board 

Small design idea I’m working on. ![image|230x500](upload://oohbTBD8f7BDP9niclj24PuSCKC.jpg)![image|230x500](upload://mKlV59G2UHM9fZJjXuxEAsIYyAJ.jpg)![image|230x500](upload://iLXdRCjHBHUtro2Dub2gD3neTYR.jpg)

Just an idea that this gave me but somebody should make flexible cases like on Trampa decks but for flexy longboard decks like the Icarus and vanguard

Yea it sorta already exists with Ernesto’s design. Segmented enclosures are the way to go with flexible decks.
