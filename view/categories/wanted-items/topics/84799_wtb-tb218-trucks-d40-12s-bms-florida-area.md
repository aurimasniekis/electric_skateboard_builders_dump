Looking to purchase a set of 
1. TB218 
2. 12sBMs D4O
3. Nickel 10FT 

while on business in Florida. Purchasing directly from TorqueBoards is a no go, due to 3-6 days shipping. 

I live in grand cayman, and I will only be in Florida I from 25-28. Thanks much.

honestly if you order from TB i would think it will be there on time for you. Dexter has always been good with shipping in the past. Takes 3 days to ship from him (TX) to me (NY) :man_shrugging:

Good luck finding the nickel though... be sure to test it (preferably before you buy it?)

Yea, Dexter is very helpful. However in this instances he recommended not to proceed. I did buy other stuff that will be shipped to a different location. 

Thanks for the suggestion though. Much appreciated
