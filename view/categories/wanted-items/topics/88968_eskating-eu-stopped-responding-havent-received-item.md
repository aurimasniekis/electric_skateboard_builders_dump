Hey there. I've ordered [this item](https://eskating.eu/product/htd-5m-53-teeth-belt-265mm/) on the 25th of february with a shipping method stating to take 3-14 days. It's now been 35 days. I've contacted them though email after 22 days with the respond that the postage might take longer...

I then after 31 days contacted them again, this time with no respons.

Anyone know if there is someone here from eskating.eu that can assist one a bit faster? I really need  need my belt to be able to skate again.
Thanks Martin

Not sure, no criticism has been said, only facts that could leads to judgement, but they are facts 
Obviously PM would be better, but OP (like myself) must have no idea who contact here

Similar situation here. I was (still am actually) looking for an enclosure and really liked the slim enclosure on eskating.eu. Sent two emails to query additional information and have yet to receive a reply. This was around 20 days ago, maybe less. Glad I didn't place an order.

Yes WhatsApp him.

TBH the belts are the kind of stuff you can buy on regular supplies stores such as RS

Hi everybody! Very sorry for the situation, I have not stopped and I'm trying to reply as fast as possible to all requests, with more than 30 pending orders, a new eskating base to arrange, and all this alone is getting me in delay with everything. I had a big moving of all stuff for eskating and my house too in the last weeks.

I'm going to write something as alert on the website, please just be patient and I'll do my best to reply all emails and messages during the following days.

I cannot hide that is a super hard and busy moment for me, for eskating too.

For any info about orders and shipment, I need your order number to see how is doing., but write me in private please, is better to avoid sharing others emails because of privacy I think.

Clearup for everyone

My package was sent back by the swiss customs, bc of battery restrictions -> there is only a charger in the package, NO BATTERY!!!  

Alberto now sent it to a shipping station in Germany

@fottaz Thanks for the friendly support! :slight_smile:

weird, even if it was a battery, I was able to ship and receive a 10s4p no problem in switzerland
Swiss custom is very annoying

Man Swiss customs... or lets say every gd custom on this earth. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

12s4p from torqueboards, no problem at all.
Raptor 2.1, three attemps failed to ship my replacement board but first board from china no problems, me shipping the board to germany, no issue.
12s4p from pjotr via ups on the way soon... hoping..

Its all totally random!

If somebody ever want to send me something, please not with UPS ðŸ˜œ

Ok to be fair in US and EU they seem to work well but they totally canâ€™t manage the russian customs. Idk why but I had always only problems or I needed to pay a lot of extra fees.

Hope with your battery all will be good!

Ups here are more expensive but super reliable for me in the past. Ive ordered hundreds of airsoft packages from the us, china and japan and I can't recall any going wrong.

Hi Alberto! @fottaz

I have ordered an package at Eskating.eu on may 5th 2019. I have paid the same day but my order has not been processed yet. It has been more than two weeks now and have not heard anything. Could you please contact me or give me an status update? I am very worried something is wrong. My order number is #12100. I have sent severaleE-mails and hoped to get a response this way. I am a new user to this forum so unfortunatly I can not PM you. Thats why I tried this way.

Kind greetings,

Silvan Fokkens

I placed my order on the 13th and it just got shipped today. It was "just" 2 motors, some rubber cable things and stickers. No custom made items just pack and ship. Not a complicated task for a single order, but i'm sure it's not "just" when you got a thousand other things to do.

Like @Creavenger said, he is really busy at the moment and like it says on his website: "if he has to respond to all the emails he get, he won't be able to ship all the 30 constant orders he is getting".

Be patient. It sucks waiting, but there is not much to do...

Okay thank you for your reply. That really helps me. I see Alberto is know on this forum and that it is not some sort of scam. That really reassures me, thanks. The order I placed does not look complicated I beleve (I could be wrong!). But I will just wait patiently. Thank you for your response!

Hey Silfok, yeah the guys here explained my situation pretty well, thanks a lot for it @legend27, @Creavenger  , your battery will be ready soon, maybe not delivered the 27th as you have in the estimation, it could be some days later. Still be an estimation, that's all.

The situation is like they said too much orders and emails and all the stuff a company has to do, all togheter, it's pretty hard to keep everything in time. Batteries are mostly never ready and built by order, as you see the handmade things take a lot more days and sometime even fast orders take more time just because I'm super busy.

thanks a lot for the patience and understanding! will do my best to improve the processing time.

Hi Alberto!

Thank you so much for responding. Atleast we know that you are working on it and that everything is fine but it just takes a bit longer.

Good luck with the orders! We hope to hear from you soon.

Greetings,

Just want to add that I've ordered from eskating before and it was super quick, but I guess just have to be patient when it's busy
