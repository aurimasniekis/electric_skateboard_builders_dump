Looking for Gummies. Would go through Trampa directly but pretty sure they don‚Äôt have any on hand at the moment. Preferred locally in NYC, but open to other places if anyone has them. Also have 107s for trade if anyone is interested in those and has Gummies.

Will you be making the black gummies in different duros than 78?

No, they will come in 75A as standard. Soft and lots of grip...
We tested the other duros and figured out that this special Urethane mixture is by far the best.
It's a German made high tech polyurethane.

That's perfect. I wanted 75a, but the description makes it seem as if it will come in 78a. I will pull the trigger and order tonight.

For the now we will offer black Gummies only, but we could make them in any colour.

There is plenty of choice on our website. You can style your wheels A-Z and Black goes with all the hubs we stock.

The site said you had stock so I placed my order, but then I got an email that said you‚Äôre waiting for stock, then you guys posted on IG that they‚Äôre back in stock, so understandably I‚Äôm very confused üòê
