Hello, I relly want a hummie deck (1 cutout variant) like the title says. I am in cali and if you have an enclosure I would love that too. @Hummie if you think you are going to do a group buy before the holidays I would love to pick one up. Thanks for reading.

I’d like to order more but can’t afford to order any myself.  As soon as I get these last motors out probably by end of tomorrow I’ll organize a group buy and see if we can get there
