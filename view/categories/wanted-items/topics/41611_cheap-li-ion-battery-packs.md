Where can I buy a cheap 18650 battery pack of decent power?

There used to be some on eBay but the price went up, plus it's an odd size.

I would use lipos instead but I don't understand them well enough.

Anyway if someone knows of a half decent battery pack, please let me know.

Yep, most cells on eBay are likely fakes. If you can buy pre built or buy cells from nkon

I bought some legitimate packs on eBay for a 10s6p battery that’s running just fine - but yea the price went up after I got em and it’s always risky so I’d say someone like @barajabali is a great go-to for custom battery packs. They’re not the cheapest but they are reasonably priced for the quality.

10s3p and above or 12s2p

Sorry I just mean any prebuilt packs, I can always link them in serial.

The sale that I got them from for 35 each ended quite a while ago... it was [this one](https://www.ebay.com/itm/LG-18650-LITHIUM-ION-36V-4-4AH-BATTERY-EBIKE-VAPE-POWERWALL-EV-20-CELLS-WITH-BMS/201895735309?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649), but the seller updated it to be more expensive. My entire 10s6p with charger cost 120$ shipped.

Also yes, my username is from Ready Player One, it's my absolute favorite book. Kudos to you for getting that, almost nobody else knows the reference.  I'm driving down to LA for a weekend just to see the premier of the movie in march!

What kind of enclosure did you use? I've been eyeing this kind of battery for a while, but I haven't been able to find a enclosure that could fit it since it's so tall.

The batteries are very tall, 2.5 inches to be exact. @GrecoMan did something pretty cool, rearranging his pack to make it flat. You can ask him about that, there's a few pictures around.

For myself, I was too lazy to crack open the packs, so I made a parallel adapter and ordered a 1.5 inch tall enclosure from @psychotiller (btw, there is no better place to get a custom enclosure). I then cut some old plywood and added boat insulation to create a seal. It turned out pretty well.

You can try both Amazon or eBay. But don't try to get the cheap one.

You say you want it cheap. Thats great, everyone wants that... Dont cheap out on bad li-ion cells, If you cant afford quality cells, Go for lipos instead. What number are you reffering to When you say "cheap"

Yeah I can't remember who it was that got those exact packs, they're legit though. Shipping is what can jack up the price on those.
