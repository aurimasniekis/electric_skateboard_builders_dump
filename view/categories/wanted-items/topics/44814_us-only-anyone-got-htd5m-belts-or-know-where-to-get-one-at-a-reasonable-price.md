i tried using the belt calculator:
[Belt length calc](https://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/).

although i didn't find what i needed maybe you will. also 255mm is to short for me i think i might need a 280 like @ZackoryCramer suggested good luck in finding a belt that fits @Snowi!

A long time ago in a galaxy far away
People used them with short motor mounts and small pulleys on 83mm wheels
