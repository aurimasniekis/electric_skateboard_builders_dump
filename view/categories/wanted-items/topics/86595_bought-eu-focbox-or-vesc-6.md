I am now wondering if FOC is always the best option, I'm reading up on it now but it seems people have a lot of trouble with it with the 4.12 hardware. Do you have an idea if it's smarter to just keep my current ESC and just run BDLC? Or is FOC really worth it?

Foc is nice for sure but Bldc ain't that bad either. 
Foc gives you smoother control and a more refined feel. 
Bldc is like a an on/off switch when it comes to power delivery

Yea, running FETs in liniair mode can cause some heat issues as well.
