I need a battery for my wowgo 2s and I prefer not to have to wait for wowgo to ship one to me, I assume it will take thema long time to get it to me. Thanks!

Yes, my board got ran over by a truck last week, long story, but the battery enclosure shattered and it bent the battery pack out of shape, I am afraid to use it now, but I'm dying to get back on my board.  So how much do you think  you would want and where are you located? ![IMG_20190616_133357793_LL|666x500](upload://hUsM2dZvGBU6IcuGeA7C0qqMk11.jpeg)
