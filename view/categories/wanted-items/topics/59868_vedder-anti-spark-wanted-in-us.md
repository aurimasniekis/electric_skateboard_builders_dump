I think I blew my anti-spark. Power just goes right through regardless of the button. I got mine from sparkheaven (EU) last time without realizing the shipping was super expensive. Does anyone know where I can get one in the US? or can someone repair it for me?

Luna Cycles sells them, not too expensive either.

Thanks. I was gona say i couldn't find it but turns out they name it differently. It's also pretty cheap. @mmaner Do you happen to know how to wire the LED button? I have a bigger one and they are labelled differently with NO, NC and C, as suppose to the print on the pcb.

I don't, I just used the 12mm switch that came with it. It works well.  If it lasts more than a week that will be 4 days linger than any other AS switch I've used (I'm up to 8 now ðŸ˜€).

The SW+ goes with C and SW- goes with NO.

I have probed NC and C together with my multimeter and seems like they are just simply connected. Can you confirm with me?

longer as in the LED survive for longer or  the AS last longer? and what do you mean by 8? 8 days?

Im guessing he is hard on the switches(fets) and that he has killed 8 sofar.

im having problems with mine. if its too bumpy it will randomly turn of and on. is there a way with this switch to add a battery meter to it?

yes, you can. Itâ€™s just a matter of where. And how simple you want it. I carry a variety of led indicators and can tell you where you need to and if have one you want to use will work.

Haven't test mine yet. But I have my battery capacity tester soldered on the output side so that it only lit when i turn it on. Charging port on the input side.

Correct. If you use a stay on type. I have those and some new ones we are connecting directly to the batteries. They work really well and show volt and capacity.  With a easy install and low profile. The unit can be installed anywhere and has a three push cycle future witch the third push of the button turns it off. ![image|690x429](upload://yVwTr0KNsp9xpGmhfPX1Y4sPEfC.jpeg)![image|519x500](upload://yYKpfWtdosKXNxD4ZLyYFRSLPyN.jpeg)

We are currently testing flipskys version of the anti spark switch. Itâ€™s working out well. The push button is bigger but the resistor they use for the led is super low and the led light is low. 
But as far as functionality it works great. And they can get a range of fuses for it. Up to 400v
But really Iâ€™m looking in to 80a, 100a and 120a mini fuses

What I like about the Luna cycle ones is that they came insulated, soldered with wire and shrink wrapped. If you can do the same thing and have extra wire coming out for battery tester and Charing port it would be a plus. Also 19mm push button is what I am swapping to so that I can sink my whole index finger in.

I don't really understand the fuse. Are they just regular car fuse or fast blow fuse? Had some experience with the slow car fuses on a PDB for robots. Ended up leaving them out cus they take seconds to melt and essentially don't protect any powered devices. Also I think it would be nice for a fuse socket. If you give out extra fuse.

Sorry for the delay, they are fast wire 60a 58v fuses. So far no one has had a issue. And I think thatâ€™s an older version in that pic.

@mmaner you right mine just blow 2 weeks in and I didn't even use my board that much times.
@hyperIon1 do you have them ready? do they last longer than a week?

Iâ€™m putting a batch together this weekend. Itâ€™s so funny with these switches. No one makes enough. So Iâ€™m constantly looking for new suppliers. 
Now I have the pcb the correct pushbutton self latching switches are on back order. 
One issue I have noticed is the push button switches being used are under rated for the use. Most of the switches come duel rated ac/dc and they are not the same. The switch needs to be able to handle the volts and amps of your battery. 
I should have a few units working this weekend.

Why does switch need to be rated for the battery voltage?  It doesn't actually pass voltage, just completed a logic circuit that tells the switch to power on.

I didnâ€™t think it did at first. But a pushbutton self latching switch 1a/12v will fail on a 36v (42v) battery. Some will not even work from the start. And some will lock in the on position after working a few times. 
I have since ordered 3a/250v  pushbutton self latching and it works with no failure or lock position. ![image|375x500](upload://moAFrsk1VSXinFUWZnlLo3vhyWl.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://moutN9X4tYho2JCOJflDkUgUI4k.jpeg)

Iâ€™m actually going to work on some switches tonight. 
I have even had pushbuttons that will act like everything is fine right up to the point you connect to load. Then flat line. 
I think that was a pcb issue. 
The bad thing is no consistency in manufacturing. 
Everyone does their own version and there is never enough to keep a steady flow.

Not as designed. The wiring actually disabled the switch function. In some cases reversed it. So I would power up the switch and it would gradually power down. Strange shit.  But the best fix it to power your led off your out power and put a 1k resistor just before your LED + at the switch.
