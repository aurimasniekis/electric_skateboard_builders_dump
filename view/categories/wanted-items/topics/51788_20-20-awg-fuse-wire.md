Anyone got extra nickel plated copper wire? I would need 1.5-2.5 meters.
Found some in UK and USA, but shipping is outrageous

Hey I'm from Finland so it's not next door directly. Any ideas how much shipping would be from NZ? Perhaps it could be shipped with a regular envelope?

Yes thanks @luuke but as I mentioned in OP the shipping is killing it. Would end up paying 3-4â‚¬ per 10cm wire
