Looking for the trucks, don't care how they look they just need to work and be in okay condition metal wise, planning on repainting them anyways.

Only looking for some within the EU at this moment already tried to order from Evolve but unforrently they don't have any stock in the EU warehouse (Germany)

If you only have the front or rear it will be fine, but a pair would be prefered.
