My Kaly Trampa just got back from her check-up and needed two things: Loc-Tite and new thane.  

I bought 107s from @treenutter and they arrive tomorrow, however, I think it is time to finally cave in and try pneumatics.

Six Shooters will not fit this little beast; looking for 4 Trampa wheels, Superstar or Hypa, any color is fine, with Urban Treadz (or equivalent), with pulleys and timing belts.

I think the Evolve AT kit will fit - @kaly any guidance most appreciated bro.

Thanks!

```
The evolve wheels will fit 
But not the plastic hubs 
You will need the Trampa superstar hubs
