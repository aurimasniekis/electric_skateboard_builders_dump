Hey!
I have a Flex 1 Loaded Vanguard and I want to build my own Version of the Boosted board.
Are there any Vendors who offer these in the EU?

I have seen this one but I have my doubts about 3d printed parts holding up well over time given that the board has flex and that the battery will be quite heavy:

Has anyone used this one with success?

Thanks!

what you can do is carbon fiber lamination over 3d printed parts and then they will become very strong.

or just use a 3d printed enclosure as a mold ;)
