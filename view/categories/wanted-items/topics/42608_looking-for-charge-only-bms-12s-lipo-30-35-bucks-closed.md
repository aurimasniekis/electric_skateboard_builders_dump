this BMS says you can get it in lifepo4 or li-ion. I have lipo batteries, can I use the li-ion one?

A bit too high over voltage for lipo. Lipo is safe under 4.2v each cell (Better to stay at around 4.1 for saftey and longevity), but over is dangerous (Fire hazard).
You could try a supower bms

I would head for the 30a bms, but 60a isn't too much more expensive and gives you a good benefit

The supower bms is about the same price as the bms you posted.

40 + 3.50 shipping to USA so $43 as compared to your bms @ 31 + 12 Shipping $43

It is ok to charge Lipos to 4.2v per cell. Matter of fact, if you charge with a bms, you will need to charge to 4.2 in order for the bms to balance the cells.
The thing that you have to watch is that you don't over discharge Lipos. Doing that will damage them quickly.
Cheap bms's are a gamble. Ok to use a low discharge bms but get a good one like Supower or Bestech.

Try making a post in the items wanted category 
Looking for Bestech or Battery Supports(Supower) charge only bms.
There might be someone with an extra to sell.
