Hey guys I really want to use these on my dual motor build as they have dedicated bearings.  Does anyone have a set they can part with?  Otherwise does anyone have ideas for another option?  Thanks.

Marcus.

Thanks for the reply.  I should have specified I am in the US.  Buildkitboards is on my radar.

They looked awesome.  Being able to change between to a different tooth count in a few minutes would be pretty cool.
