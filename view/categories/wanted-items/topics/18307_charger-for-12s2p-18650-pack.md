The Meanwell LED drivers seem to make good power supplies - adjustable voltage and current, and last a long time.  The adjustable voltage allows you to undercharge the pack a little to prolong battery life.  No fans so nice and quiet, just a big aluminum case.

They can be found for around $40.

I have a new 12S (50.4V) 2A charger I could sell you.

I have two of them and just bought a 5A charger, so I don't really need it. PM me
