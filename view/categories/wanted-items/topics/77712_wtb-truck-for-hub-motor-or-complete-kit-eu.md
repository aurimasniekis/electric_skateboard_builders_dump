I have these:

which costed 185 after shipping. They're new, and there are 6 spare PUs with them so they will practically last "forever". Would like to get as much as what i've spent on them if possible, because I can still use them on my upcoming shortboard build. They're new 90MM replaceable hubs, can do 26MPH in 10S.

I have this kit http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-7051mm-350w2-6power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-617.html?zenid=18fd5ace7de0ff0728d21c808ca3a77a that I can spare. Its already used, the PU is already worn (typical hub motor heat damage) and I replaced the baseplate of the motor truck (for a better one ;) ) but you can get them for 50â‚¬ plus shipping. I'm not at home but if you are interested I can take pictures tomorrow night.
