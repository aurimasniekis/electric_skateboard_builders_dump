Hello, so i bought the fall special gold rkps from surf rodz but definitely dont want a 35 degree baseplate up front. Does anybody have a baseplate not in use they want to sell? There are no 50 degree bases on their website... color does not matter

@mmaner, @Sender, @thisguyhere ??

@Sender is working on getting a group buy together for rkp adjustable bases. If I were you I would wait for that

I dont really need adjustable, just a regular old 50 degree rkp baseplate. I know peeps here have multiple sets, and if theyre anything like me they have spare parts laying around for science and what not

I don't have any either.  I would have had you if you needed a TKP baseplate!

No extras here.
If @Sender ever gets a reply from surfrodz about the group buy :roll_eyes:
Then there will be extra fixed baseplates floating around after we get our adjustable ones.

Solved! Gave surf rodz a call and they had a black 50degree baseplate in the back üòÅ and it is getting added to my other order for shipping convenience. Good advise @mmaner
