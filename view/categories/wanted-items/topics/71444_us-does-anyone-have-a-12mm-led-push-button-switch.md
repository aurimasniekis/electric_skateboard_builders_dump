I’m looking for a 12mm led switch (latching type - on/off). I found several listings on eBay that goes $6 for a switch and listings from China that cost like nothing but take longer to arrive. So if anyone has one to offer/give away please let me know. Yea I know you guys might be saying why am I being so cheap well I just want to know if I can, if not I’ll end up with the eBay listings.
