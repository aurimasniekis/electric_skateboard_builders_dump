If anybody has a spot welder they would like to sell/ lend me please can u send me a PM. 
I was looking at getting a Sunkko 788 but have read about them having issues with blowing mains fuses etc being used in the EU/UK.

This is good, maybe up to 2 weeks for delivery, needs a 3s or 4s lipo to provide the welding power
