Hey! I was wondering if electricboardsolution online store is a trust worthy site. Has anyone ordered there before? They sell li ion battery packs for a good prize for me in the EU.

Store link:
https://electricboardsolutions.com/

They are trustworthy. You can ask @pjotr47, he will also confirm. I've bought lots of stuff from Fred's site even a 12s6p battery.
