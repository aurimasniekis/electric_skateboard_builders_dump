I'm looking for one of the classic blue and carbon fiber motor mounts from enertion. I already have one of these mounts, but I would like to get another to upgrade to dual motor and I realized that enertion doesn't sell them anymore.

The closest you are going to get from an online store, i.e. not from someone on the forum.
