Hello esk8 community

I need an enclosure that would fit a battery that is 272x138x19.5mm and also a ESC that is about 3x3x1 inches. I would like it all to fit into one enclosure 

Where can I buy enclosures or who can make and sell it to me? 

Iâ€™ve already checked out torqueboard and mboards, but they did not fit my specification

Thanks!

@eboosted sells some dope enclosures, as wel as @psychotiller they sell all different sizes and shapes, pretty much everything you could want.

@fottaz and @e.board_solutions sell some great enclosures in many different sizes. Maybe @bigben can even make you a custom one :smile:

I take around 4 days to manufacture the enclosure and then if you choose DHL you should get it in 3 days more
