Where are you located monkey32? I might be interested as well in the future. 

P.s.: probably somebody has posted this already, but all you need is a transfo from an old or broken microwave and some creativity...

I can build you a custom pack, or check out my tutorial on building your own if you want to go DIY but as your asking to buy one I guess you don't want that haha! [How To Build Your Own Spot Welder From A Microwave!](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-build-your-own-spot-welder-from-a-microwave/2747)

This is a 10s2p pack I've just built for a friend,

it ispired me to try and build my own pack of 10s3p
i already have an amature soldering station plus ive got an old microwave lying around that i can try making a spot welder out of. 

could you explain me how i should be welding the 30 batteris to make a 10s3p in one flat formation? not sure what formation would be better 10/15 in 2/3 raws or two 15 on top of eachother

Additionally on every side is a carbon fibre plate for protection...

Batteries cost me 52Euros each, carbon plate around 15 for two packs and the shrinking tube was around 8 euros but I have 1,5meters left!

All I had to do was to separate 2 cells, flip them to the side and connect the cells again.
Then cut the carbon plate, glue the plates on the surfaces. Shrinking tube around... thats it!

I have 8s with 20.000mAh now... Cheaper and easier is not possible I think.

You need a soldering iron, a cable, I used 8AWG and a heatgun.

where did you get a 4S 20000mAh battery for 52â‚¬?
Got it - I think you have[ these ones](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=65272) correct?
They are 4S 10Ah - so you either get 8S 10Ah or 4S 20Ah depending on the connection. NOT 8S 20Ah.

Hey.. Since I've got two of these Batteries in spare I can modify them and post pics by this weekend. Before I ordered them on ebay, but the seller said they are out of stock and he will refund my money, then I ordered them via hobbyking. And finally I got 4 of them :) @Maxid or Others: I would sell them modified if you want, I only charge the material costs and the costs I had for shipping etc... Could send them to Berlin from Germany (Freilassing) on the 4th of july, from Austria next week but there are more shipping costs. @listgaus I'll post a tutorial on this weekend and send you the link afterwards...

Pure carbon is, but the resin it is molded in is not.
so it should be no problem

Then let me tell you that carbon is good thermal conductor too! One big sheet of heatsink.^^

Will solve many problems in Eboards.
if it was not that expensive.
Maybe in 5 years or so.
