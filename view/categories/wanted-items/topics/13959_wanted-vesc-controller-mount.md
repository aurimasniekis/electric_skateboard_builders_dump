Hey Guys,

To finish my build im looking for a VESC, controller (not a trigger one, one like boosted, benchwheel) and a motor mount to fit my new 6374 motor. 

Living in The Netherlands :D

What about @ajaynagra ''s group buy? He should have everything. Maybe don' t take the maytech vesc, everything else should be fine

Best VESC option EU is esk8.de. Get it from @elkick.

If you like the thumb style, you have two good options:
enertions controler or benchwheel (talk to @ajaynagra to get one)
the winning remote is nice to handle too, but a lot of people reporting connection and battery problems.

Motor mounts:
again @ajaynagra or from every other vendor around the EU.

Yeah, but it's been tested by 4 people. That's not enough to recommend anything. From what we know, it may be worse than the winning, there's people who love that and people who nearly died because of it
