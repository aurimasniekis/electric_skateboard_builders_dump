I got a steel pulley stuck to a motor shaft after using loctite bearing retainer. Bought a bearing puller and ended up pulling the shaft off the motor... I need two more motor pulleys, somewhere between 14-16 teeth. Wanted to check here before buying it directly from BKB.

I think @longhairedboy just got a bunch of pullys in stock. 
I'd recommend @psychotiller since he's west coast based but i think he's not home for a few days if you're hoping for something to ship quickly.
