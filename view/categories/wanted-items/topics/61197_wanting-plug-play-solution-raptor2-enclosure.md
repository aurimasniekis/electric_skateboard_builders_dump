I love my raptor 2, and was wanting to get something like it has for another build Iâ€™m doing. Where the enclosure has battery, meter, switch, esc/focboxs, receiver all together so you just put on a deck and plug motors in and mount on trucks.

What do you want the 2nd board for?

There are a lot of options for different purposes.

Wanting it to be a pretty versatile & adaptable board that I can switch b/w street & pneumatic wheels.
