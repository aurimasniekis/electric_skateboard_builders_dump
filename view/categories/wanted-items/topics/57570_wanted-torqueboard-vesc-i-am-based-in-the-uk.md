Hey there,

I have currently a dual-drive system where I purchased two VESCs from @torqueboards however one was faulty and shorted. I still want solid compatibility, hence in need of another torqueboard vesc. I thought I might as well use the community forum to source this vesc without the annoyance of shipping from the USA. The VESC must be in working order and preferably new.

PM me for details if you happen to be able to sell! 

Fraser
