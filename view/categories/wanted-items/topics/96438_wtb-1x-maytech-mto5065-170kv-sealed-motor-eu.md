Hi, does anyone have a  **Maytech MTO5065 170kv Sealed Motor** laying around unused?


I burnt one of the motors of my shortboard, and I would like to replace it ASAP as I plan to fly to Barcelona in a couple of weeks. (My travel batteries only fit in the HB83 deck)

Thank you in advance

Best, Mathias
