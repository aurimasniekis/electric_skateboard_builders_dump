@dickyho has both budget motors and mounts

Also unless you're mounting diagonal, dual 6374 won't fit cal 2 trucks.

Yep. Esk8 isn't cheap. 
You can spend 2 grand on a board easy, and still have something break randomly and have to do $200 worth of maintenance.

Isn't not a cheap hobby

Go buy some Cal II trucks on eBay and buy the mounts and motors from https://ebay.com/usr/eboard-shop

It'll run fine for a while...for the budget crap you're trying to pull it's the best you'll get

You and @Halbj613 should just bounce off each other and stop creating threads you can answer with the **slightest** bit of research.

@onloop - It's time for a fucking community mute feature on the site mate.
