Heyy I have just finished my first electric skateboard and have a new (dual) board coming up.

I already have most of the stuff including a flier dual 8s esc

Unfortunately it broke and I have now two options: Sending it to back to flier for repair which will cost â‚¬80 or buying a second one and I am curious if anyone has one for me for around that price.

So does anyone, in EU, have an 8s+ dual esc for me?
