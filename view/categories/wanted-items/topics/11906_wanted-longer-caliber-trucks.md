Have a broken Boosted Board? I'll buy your trucks!

I'm looking for anyone who has a beatup/old/broken Boosted Board who doesn't mind parting out the trucks. Will pay $100 for them after verifying their condition.

Do you know the width of bb v1 trucks? :nerd:

saw a deck on here a few days ago, trucks must be somewhere....

Yep, but they're wider by about 1-2cm! This will help me immensely in getting the angle of the mounts on my new build up.

@saul not sure, but i'd say 194-204mm given regular calibers are 184mm?

Ok i thought maybe you confirmed it already, what do you have planned? at wheels?

I found some truck factories, I was going to try to price a custom super wide order, Do you think others would value some super wide rkp's for $100 a pair?

I'm positive there's a market for them. I'd expect to pay about $50-60 for extra wide calibers though, probably not $100 unless they had some extra features like ronins.

I'm wanting to use them for this build http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carbonated-enertion-vescs-hi5ber-overtaker-custom-10s4p-25r-pack-with-cell-level-fusing-abec-flywheels/10879/12 I'm currently using authentic 184mm calibers, but reversing mounting them leaves about 1.5cm clearance for the motor mount to the ground. My preferred way of solving this issue is getting wider trucks.

I would also love to get some modified Calibers too.

I actually meant $50-60 for the pair given Enertion and DIY sell clones for about $40. The only difference with these is that they'll have a bit more real estate on the hangars.

thats true i'm not even sure what the bulk price is yet, the steel axles would need to be longer too.
what do you think is the target hanger width?

x2 6374 needs 160mm or so + 12mm x2 for belts. 184 + wheel offset + 40mm
230mm? 250mm?
or go evolve with 320mm?

I think 200mm with 284mm axle is sufficient. I find 42mm from end of axle to hangar to be the perfect width for Enertion pulleys. and 200mm should fit to 6355's with 15MM belts. If you want to be able to throw 6374's on there I imagine 230 (314 axle) would be sufficient.

You could commission someone like @korryh to make a sweet extended motor mount to provide more clearance for the reverse setup.

@saul/@Jinra - They honestly look the same. The difference I saw was ~1mm (183/184mm), which isn't substantial enough to believe that it was on purpose. When looking at them, it's all about perspective that might make one look longer than the other:

I think its the small 70mm wheels! next to 90/97mm that diy boards usually have the wheels look tiny, hanger looks wider!

I like how its day time in china right now, might have a lead for custom order.

found this in the mean time.
looks like randal style 180mm width flat spots and motor mount flange.

Ask and you shall receive. :slight_smile: Just a note though, these are the v1 mounts. I haven't taken a look at how the v2 mounts work, but I know they're different in the aspect that they aren't a spring loading, self tensioning system anymore. 

The mounts themselves are held on by a type of glue. Not very efficient seeing as loose motor mounts was one of the v1 owners' pain points:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/7/f7d2f2448c00fc8bacd1a393d23169fb35cc4511.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Here you can see the grooves in the mount for where the springs sat. The motor slides into the mount and compresses the springs. When a belt is attached between the pulleys, the springs would self tension the belt. This was made possible by some bolts that went through the encoder cap through to the motor through those holes (I think... it's been awhile):

Also, @chaka is working on a 107 drivetrain so am assuming that could be bought with trucks, which would also solve the problem...

So I found that factory that can do them, they can also do caliber style hangars but should we stay with this?
I know caliber are the standard/most options for mounts but it these are made specifically for esk8, why not have some more mount friendly hangers?

This should also help guage interest, an order would have to be 100 pairs :joy:

I actually like the idea of a hex hangar a lot. However, since there are so many Caliber mounts on the market, it's kind of hard to adopt. It'd make it easier if you offered both mount and trucks at the same time to drive adoption.

True true, but Caliber have their issues, i'm more worried that there would be small variations that make problems for current mounts.

I'm working on my own mounts for a gb and I would do the trucks after/or same time.
I think a hex hanger could make mounting even more solid and simple!
and with exact specs available a adapting mounts would be cake! tasty super wide carving cake! ;)

Once they are done, i don't see why they couldn't be made in standard and smaller widths for mini/penny builds ;)

Calibers are the past, and present, But **I don't think they are the future of esk8**. imho :sunglasses:

Almost. I should be getting the samples soon. Will post some photos once I have them in hand.

They're 220mm with 40mm axles. I stuck with the Caliber Style hanger to keep things more compatible.

If you don't need the 40mm axle. Just add in a 10mm bearing spacer.

Could be sooner but the actual truck height is a bit bigger than the standard Caliber Trucks. Depending, on the motor mounts people use it so it's not a perfect fit just yet. Something really small like 1mm.

@osbor - Should be about $55.

The axle is about 40mm. Do you guys think you'll find use for the longer 40mm axle? You can use a spacer to space it out which will be included.

Ideally, I was planning on a bearing pulley but didn't like them as much as the aluminum pulleys.

I do like the lean for the longer pulleys though.

When you say the trucks are 1mm taller.  Are we taking relative to the base plate,  do overall height,  or are you referring to the profile of the hanger being larger than that of the caliber II?

The hanger profile is:
1) lager 1 mm all around (therefore 2mm wider and 2mm taller), or
2) is larger 1mm overall (therefore. 5mm on the cured portion and. 5mm on the rectangular portion),or
3) is 1mm taller only on the height of the hanger on the rectangular portion, or
4) is only 1mm taller on the curved portion,  or 
5) is 1mm wider on the rectangular portion? 

Just want to clear up exactly how it differs and a follow up question is will that be adjust or is that to be the final dimensions?

How'd you know.. you checking up on me @michaelcpg lol

They're nice and wide.. Great though how I like them. You can lean harder without worrying about tipping over on 180's. Not sure if other people have the same issue though.

170mm gap between the motor mounts. So you could fit Dual 6374 with 12mm, not sure about 15mm possibly.

The D shape truck profile is slightly bigger than standard Calibers so that might be a slight issue for some.
- Our older v4 Caliber Clamps won't fit but I'll discount a replacement for previous customers.
- Enertion clamps might be fine.
- Not sure about the other "new options".

218mm hanger, 37mm axle, 11mm thread, 48mm total axle + thread
314mm end to end.

## \#119 Posted by: Gromok Posted at: 2017-03-22T06:40:57.725Z Reads: 332

```
The mounts are [Trampa mounts for Caliber II's](http://www.trampaboards.com/caliber-ii-axle-connectors--carbon-fiber-motormount--p-13681.html)

You can see [here](http://www.trampaboards.com/caliber-ii-carbon-fiber-motormount-with-axle-support-p-13289.html) and [here](http://www.trampaboards.com/caliber-ii-carbon-fiber-motormount-6364-2400kw-motor--pulley-kit-p-12993.html) that the clamp is supposed to be that way cos the wheel hubs are actually large enough to go over it.

Turning it around wont make any difference anyway as you can see the two motors are just about in contact with each other anyway :smile: 

I also see there is a problem with the clamp base being wide and thus putting the belt/pulley line up out of whack. Look like I may have to either get a different compatible clamp or buy another motor mount entirely.

Also with it the other way around the mount will either be too high up or too far down as you can see in the pics below

How wide belts you're using? With 12mm it fits, but your mount bolts are too big. You can save 4mm with slimmer bolts and another 2mm using 2 spacer between truck and wheels.
```

## \#122 Posted by: trampa Posted at: 2017-03-31T07:49:56.686Z Reads: 317

Hi, using these mounts you want a long motor shaft (min. 38.5mm outside motor) and use the support bearing. You can flip the caliber shaped disc, so that the panels are just in the right angle towards the deck/truck. Making long motor shafts is not to much of a job. We use 15mm Belts to prevent belt slip. Wide belts make all the difference. @Gromok: the flat spot on the Carbon Panles faces towards the ground to prevent the carbon from splitting when touching the pavement. It works the other way around but you could ruin the Carbon. Depending on your motor size (diameter), you could also reverse the carbon panel to stick out in the back of the board. Just reverse the caliber shaped disc and the carbon panel.

15mm belts.

Another problem is that Trampa 33t pulley is 27mm wide or 21mm after inserting it into my wheel hubs.

I'm holding out for Torqueboard's wider calibers.

Trampa informed me that I can get refunded when I ship it back to them. Holding onto it for now till I get torqueboard's clamps and mount kit and see if 275mm belts are useable or not.

If someone else in EU has better shipping rates within EU, please step forward :)   

Torqueboards has free shipping on orders over $400.

How big is the package?

If (length + height + depth <= 90cm)
then i could send it for 9€ ;) (max 2kg)

otherwise it would be 18€ (max 5kg)

I'm based in Poland and from the experience I've had with polish customs there'd be no way that I'd be able to avoid paying 23% VAT, and that on top of some customs tax, for a package this heavy, coming from outside of the EU and especially from the US.

Explain plz, cause I don't seem to get it. So the "one central guy" receives the package, and the customs contact him saying that they won't clear it until he pays 23% VAT on the good's cost - from what you've said I gather that he gets to pay all the tax costs all by himself, but that is "not what it's about" because internal EU shipping costs matter more?

The 23% are for you if you receive them in Poland from US, which is not the case. So yes there may be some import tax for the guy in EU who will receive the whole package, and it will need to be assessed, but then there is no tax for re-sending in EU. So we are only talking about shipping cost in EU. You will not have any tax in Poland if the parcel comes from the UK or Germany (for ex. if one of the two Dans does it).
```

## \#164 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2017-05-12T11:08:43.348Z Reads: 235

```
exactly. the 20% everybody has to pay no matter if you do a group buy or not so they are not necessary in calculating if a group buy makes sense (at least not as long as there is no huge price reduction due to higher order numbers).
So what matters is the price difference for shipping between you just ordering them yourself or through the group buy.

So if the postage from the US is 20$ and inside the EU it would still be another 12$ there is like no point in doing a group as all you save is 8$. If the postage from the US is 50$ however and the EU stays at 12$ you'd save a substantial 38$

@jga makes no sense - you always pay the full VAT! no matter if you do a group buy or not. It is all about shipping cost savings from overseas

What makes no sense? That's exactly what I said! But the VAT is not the same in every country in Europe, so I confirm that depending on where the package is received from the US, the taxes will not be the same.

There is also the aspect of not getting your stuff caught in customs. Bigger package and value = bigger risk.

Samples and gifts are free of import duties, but a box with 20 trucks in it will most likely be subject to customs. Best thing is probably teaming up with 1 or 2 fellow countrymen and order together.

Just so I am clear we are talking about a group buy of TB wide trucks at $50 - lets say we get 8 takers so that we meet the min for free postage - that means VAT will be $80 plus handling fee from carrier of about £15.

Total bill to land in UK circa $500 or $62 plus onward p+p of $20

$82 or 75 Euro or £62 

I'm not sure the maths stack up on this one. No doubt a chinese company with clones will pop up shortly. That might help us EU guys.

Sorry for the lame photo lol.

It will fit Dual 6374 12mm. We are working on 15mm pulleys as well and it should be able to run 15mm.

Dual 6374 is overkill IMO though :)

But it's possible.

@sl33py They're in hand. You can order it and we'll ship it out in a few days.

Just know these trucks aren't exact spec to Caliber. Caliber sits at about 19.40 these sit at 20.20 so almost about 1mm taller.

For anyone who's using TB motor mounts (older). We'll have some new clamps soon which will be $15/ea (special price) for those who have purchased before. If you wanted to upgrade to longer trucks.

@Jinra The axle is 10mm longer (usually use a bearing spacer) than standard so not sure on actual specs for Enertion pulley but it should fit might need to pad 5mm gap though with washers or something.

Awesome, should work then. Enertion pulley requires exactly 1 bearing width worth of axle to work, so 7mm.

EDIT: Actually I realize you might mean 10mm longer overall which would mean 5mm per side. Guess we'll still have to chop off about 2mm per side.

If that was not there, then the clamp most likely would have fitted. I will just need to file a bit off on the flat part of the clamp so it can go over that little ridge you see in pic.

I have been working on my DIY clamp and motor mount design. Still waiting on the trucks to get the exact profile of the clamp area. In the pic above it looks like draft angle for the mold, like a 1 deg angle from each side meeting in the middle. Which is perfectly normal it just we are used to caliber which are flat. I guess they grind them down after or have a different mold design.

very cool.

consider making the clamp a 2 piece, kind of like enertion's.  i've experienced and also heard from numerous people that the crimp-style one piece clamps tend to come loose regularly and also has fitment issues since the hanger dimensions can vary just a little between trucks.

got a chance to play around with these trucks just now, and i must say, they're pretty damn wide.

comparing psychotiller's [rkp trucks](https://psychotiller.com/product/200mm-50-rkp-trucks) (bottom), normal caliber ii (middle), and torqueboard's 218mm (top):

axle's are wide too, will need spacers:

trucks will easily fit dual 6374s, i'm gonna trade in my dual 6355 for 6374s...:

Do you think using a pulley like enertion's or evolve's with the bearing would suit these and solve the spacer issue? Or is the axle still too long?

Not sure don't have those on hand. @torqueboards may have an answer.

After seeing how simple it would have been to just file down the Truck, I kind of wish I didn't order clamps that have now pushed my order back by at least two weeks. 

I am jealous of all you people who already got their trucks :/

After several 3D prints I have figured out the cross section of the clamp area for any one else making their own clamps. 
 * Just note the distance from the top of the curve to the bottom flat varies maybe + - 1mm from truck to truck. And a little from the axel area to the clamp area. Being a little larger at the axel end. The left and right flat sides seem consistent. This is just based on the two pieces I have on hand, yours might vary more, I cant say.  All dimensions in mm. Ohh and I made it a tight fit by design, you might want a little more wiggle room.

The spacers are pretty easy - use speed rings if you want, or you can cut some 13-15mm spacers.

Easily fits 97mm wheels, dual 6374's and 15mm belts.

Or you can get the 107mm Abec 11 Electric Flywheels w/ 12mm belts.  Just swap longer bolts and gtg!

Mockup of my setup. The extra long axels mean I can run a pulley with a bearing in it which also pushes the motors out a bit aaand there is still a spacer on the end of the axel. Fronts have spacer wheel spacer nut.  I needed to file of the square corners off to make room for my pulleys. :scream:

I'd agree, but it may have to do with softer brushings.

Can't say definitively until both front and rears are on.

It would be super tight. If it worked youd have to have the motor pulley super close to the motor since the mounts will have to be taken to the very edge of the hangar. I think there would be fitment headaches but maybe possible. I'll try eyeballing with my one sk3 later today.

Hanger is 7.26" or 184.5mm.

Hi.

This picture of @lrdesigns do not match. Two examples: 

1) If I set his picture in 3d program and create box width 20.70 (11.70+9.0),
it is smaller then his picture. 

2) If I use picture of real life clamp and compare with his picture 20.70x18.20, again
sizes do not match.

What is real size of NORMAL caliber 2 clamp hole?
