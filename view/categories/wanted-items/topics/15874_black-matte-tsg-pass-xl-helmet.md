I got a Black Matte TSG Pass XL helmet for Christmas, but it has a white TSG logo across the sides.  Was looking for the more stealth grey TSG logo instead, but having trouble finding that in exchange.  Will be returning this helmet, anyone have the older grey logo version or know where to get it?  Seems the 2016 version is white logo, and older 2015 version is grey logo. Thanks!

You could carefully tape off the logo and the rest of the helmet and use some automotive tail light tint spray to darken it as you desire. If your up for some light painting. Or have vinyl cut to lay over top the logos in the color you desire.
