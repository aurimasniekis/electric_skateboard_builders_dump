Yo.

Anyone selling a complete 15mm kit? Could go for 12mm for the right price.

9mm just isn't doing it for me with a single drive. I'll need a motor pulley, wheel pulley, and belt.
Already bored to 8mm for the motor pulley, any length belt for now

Cheers :)

For what kind of wheels?

@johnny_261 might have a 15mm kit left. (http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/15mm-wide-pulley-kits-wheel-motor-pulleys-belts-and-hardware/17131)
I bought a kit from him, really pleased with it. It's for flywheel style wheels.

Thanks for all the replies guys, got a good few options here. Anyone got a 15mm wheel pulley for sale? Pref 36T but not picky. 

3d printed would be fine, or if anyone has a suitable 3d and wants a commision..? 

15mm 5M wheel pulleys seem to be the hardest thing to come across :persevere:
