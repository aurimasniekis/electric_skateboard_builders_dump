I'm looking for the front truck of a mountain board with 2 wheels (7-9inch diameter). Doesn't have to be new. Needs to be in a decent condition. We can talk about pricing if you are willing to sell. I am located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, so we will take shipping into account. 

Please PM me pictures with the price you are looking for. Thanks.
