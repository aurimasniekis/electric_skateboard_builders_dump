They are now selling a newer version with different clamp and mount but I'm looking for older version as on the image above.

New, full motor mount kit with screws preferred. Pulleys / belt not needed but if you do have them, make note and I'll think about it :)

Thanks!

Tip for installing those mounts.

 Put the clamp on the hanger in place and snug with the main bolt and then Squeez it down on the hanger by putting a C-clamp on it and then tighten the main bolt.
This way you won't strip the main bolt.

Ya they do need a lot of force to tighten them. I slightly stripped both the stock bolts. Then I ordered new hardened 12.9 bolts and never looked back. I like the c-clamp idea. Good thinking.

Don't worry I know about those. Those are for the next build. I need DIY one for the dual upgrade :)

Still looking for this older-style Torque Boards (DIY) mount, if anyone has it. Mount + Clamp.
Come on, sure they sold heaps of those, some of you must have extra! :) Cheers!
