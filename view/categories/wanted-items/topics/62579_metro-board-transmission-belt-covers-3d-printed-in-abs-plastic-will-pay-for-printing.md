Hello, first post here, so apologies if this is not the right place:

Where could I possibly get a set of these transmission covers 3d printed in a hard black ABS plastic?

https://metro-board.com/shop/transmission-cover/

The metal stock ones rattle like crazy, sounds like a tin can is attached to the board.
I could buy the part, ship it to you, and pay you moneys to model and print it.
i'd just need 2 printed in black ABS plastic. Located in the U.S. 

Thank you in advance.

Just paint them with rubber undercoating maybe?  I have some and know the sound.  It doesn't bother me anymore

That $2k skateboard is way better than the other $2k skateboards and way, way better than the cheaper ones.  A little noise here and there isn't that big of a deal.  You could make your own for about the same price.

I'm going to have to. But it's not just a little noise. any road that isn't completely flat turns my board into the audible equivalent of a tin can dragging on the pavement. its fucking embarassing.

That sounds like more noise than mine has.  Are you sure the bolts are tight?
