If you only need 2 for drive wheels I have the front wheels off my Ownboard, used for around 20km to see how they went before being swapped for some Haggy wheels.

Otherwise there are a couple of sets of the Evolve stoneground 97's on gumtree, apparently they are a bit more aimed at sliding

Maybe throw up your location, pretty sure your Brisbane based ?
