Hi!

Does anyone in EU have 12mm or 15mm wheel pulleys? 
Im using 100mm mbs all terrain wheels.

A couple of 275mm belts would also be nice! :slight_smile: 

Thanks!

I am using these on my 100mm MBS which were made by @JuniorPotato93 and am quite happy with them. Not Pulley, but files for printing:

Okay, Iâ€™ll se if I can use the 3D printer at my school. Would PLA filament work?

Sorry, can't answer that question because I'm a noob when it comes to 3D printing. 
Mine are made of PETG with 100% infill.
