Like @bigben and @jga mentioned, hobbyking is the way, cheap and fast.

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-high-quality-10awg-silicone-wire-2m-black.html

For example, here locally in a shop they take â‚¬12,50 for 1 meter 10AWG :crazy_face: 
At hobbyking you get 2 meters including shipping for less than â‚¬10

Actually I thought he meant battery wires.  Phase wires don't need to be quite as big.  Still big though

That's what Evolve is doing. And i think the phase leads on like every hub i've seen are 16awg, i'm pretty sure even the Raptor's phase leads are 16awg. 

I use 12awg throughout my builds, battery and all, but they're running 60amp BMSs, not 240 amp BMSs like @b264 apparently. lol I also have very short wire runs, so it matters less. 

I may start using 14awg phase leads on my motors just for wire management purposes, but not likely. 12 on the phase leads is way overkill, i do it more for aesthetics than any real need for it. I really like they way they look.

A mixture of Mains work, wiring for 3d printers, and mostly for building a 52s-9p battery pack :D

@FredrikHems I am about to spend 2k on a new battery shipment.  I always bulk buy and save what I can. then use slowly over time.

initially its going inside an E-Quadbike, to test the "battery"  should be able to get about 198V @ 200A.  then after testing, im going to make 3 more ( 4 total) and put them inside my <a href="http://www.arielmotor.co.uk/style/temp/nomadColours/Nomad_High_Front_3qrtr.png">super ghetto </a> ATV ive been building for a while.

just a fun little side project ive been working on for a year now - eventually ill get around to finishing it and will probably put a post up about it.

your welcome.  its not much of a diffrence from Esk8 to Evehicle. just some slightly more expensive parts.  Cant wait to see what your coming up with :D

If you want a decent motor for light vehicles/ quads <a href= "http://www.revolt.org.il/rv-160-model/rv-160-short/"> here is a good ~20hp motor </a>  --- can definitely reccomend this one!

A normal Vesc can pull 40A without a heatsink before overheating.  you only need to get upto 90A to get close to the 5Kw mark.  with a decent heatsink and some airflow its not too difficult at all.  even a cheap low profile pc cooler could cool it enough to work
