Hello everyone,

I'm in the need of a charger suitable for a 9s battery pack (37.8v 3a). Preferably one with a smart charger.

Does anyone have one for sale? I'm in the UK and it's proving very difficult to find a charger that's suitable and can ship to me!

Thanks,
Daniel

Do you need a bms, adaptor or both?

I've got a BMS already. See below. I'll be using this for charge and discharge.

Thanks for the link but why do all these charges take so long to arrive?

Because they ship from china.
and the postal services they use are slow but cheap.

I think you can add like 2e for standard shipping on Ali, It's a bit faster according to there shipping times.

Nightmare. If only there was a company in Europe that could provide the goods!

Not to worry. Thanks :slight_smile:
