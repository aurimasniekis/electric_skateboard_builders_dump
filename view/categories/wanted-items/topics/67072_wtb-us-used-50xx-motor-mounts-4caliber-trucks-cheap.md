Looking for temporary fix for my Riptide R1 until I can afford surfrodz TKP trucks and mounts.
I'll be sure to pass them on to someone in need when I'm done.
Motors mounts for caliber trucks and 50xx motors.  
Thank you
Hail skatan

I've got 2 BKB mounts you can have, just pay shipping.  I don't know if they fit 50mm motors perfectly, but I think you can use 2 or 3 screws with loctite and should be good in the short term.

There's also 3d printable pulley covers if your into that sort of thing.

Funny thing is those are the first mounts i tried to use to fix this board before they replaced the truck. They didn't work out. Jlabs was nice enough to buy them back.

I've actually had a rear truck brake two other times back when I was first getting into downhill. 
Was going way faster (this thing barely goes 20mph) and yeah.... that hurt.

This happened to me last summer riding downhill with some hard carves and the arse of the thing literally fell off.  Put me in a neighbours front yard with a quite spectacular front flip over the wall via the kerb.  Extended shoulder and three weeks off work.

Genuine Caliber with about 40 lbs of groceries, at full speed.  Thank skatan I didn't wipe out.  Thank skatan I like "full speed" to be about 25mph.

Another part of the reason I'm trying to move to all Precision trucks on my boards.
I've broken a lot of cast trucks over the years.
If I can spend around $1,000 on all my other parts, I can drop $150 on some Precision trucks.

Had no catastrophic mech failures yet on esk8 but on my analog stuff yes. Lots of human errors and electronic failures but mechanical, no, touch wood.  @b264 that truck must have had some k's on it I'm guessing but still not great really.  I'm hopefully having some hangers made up based on the tb 218 soon if I can get the guy to lower his moq if not then the rest will be on here for sale.
