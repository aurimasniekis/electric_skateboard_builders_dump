I have some old Carvon dd's in USA but they need some repairs so probably not something you want.

You can get some nice chain drive kits from overion.fr if you don't mind buying new.

Iâ€™ve got a set of the old style Trampa mounts and pulley if thatâ€™s any good

Budget around 1500/2000euros, i can build it myself but after many issue (joy of diy) with my twice street builds, i prefer buy a completly build emtb, ride is easyer and more pleasant for me than program fucking vesc/unity/what you want or waiting ton of parts.

 Looking fot trampa r2r but little out of my budget.

Ah I mis-read, your after the full build. Iâ€™ve only got the mounts. There are some options on ebay. If you message this guy you could maybe arrange something re postage. His names Matt I think. He has 3 boards for sale
