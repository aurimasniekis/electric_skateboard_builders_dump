Im looking for a 10s bms preferably a cheap one just to balance charge but I'm also open to a high amp rated bms if anyone has one.
Thanks!

 Hey dude. I do have one. Never used it. It's a 60 amp discharge. Doesn't have the balance leads though. Would need to make those.

If yo still need one I have one that you can use for charge only as I don’t know the amp rating. I’m in the US.
$25+$7 shipped
