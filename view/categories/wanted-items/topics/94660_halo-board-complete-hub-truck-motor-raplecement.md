One hub and they want $500 as they refuse to replace just one- and they’re saying the control board needs replacement.

The Halo board is fun to ride, but if you break any of it past a year expect to have to buy another.

Bastards wouldn’t replace my one hub.  F Halo, imo.

Halo board is a shitty reseller of a shitty board. You can replace their hubs/esc for $200 total or better yet get a VESC and belt drive for about $230.

Do you have a link?  I replaced the bad hub with one of the front wheels and slapped my city-board wheels on to get it back on the road.

The acceleration is much slower as the torque is halved, but it’ll still get up to 22mph. (I’m 165# wet).

Bah!  I just ordered a Nazare.  I need more speed anyway.

Halo’s a good starter board and it’ll last maybe year if you like riding as much as I do.  Halo service will not send you parts- you have to send them back your board to get retail repairs and you can’t just get the parts anywhere and do it yourself, as far as I know.

If anyone knows where I can grab these parts. ❤️❤️

What size hubs are those?
Comfortable 97mm hubs @ $200 https://www.backfireboards.com/collections/all/products/350w-hub-motors-with-hub-wheels-and-caliber-truck-with-off-set-wheels?variant=15634227363889

Good ESC https://www.meepoboard.com/collections/esc/products/esc-for-classic-mini-2-standard

(You can find cheaper hubs, but for the extra urethane i'd reccomend the backfire ones)

Thanks so much for the info and link!; I’ll be sure to swap both out as soon as I pay off this $3500($3200 now) debt I just made.
