Hi, I'm currently in discussion with Bestech about buying 2 of these http://www.bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html which is what I think you are after? 

I only need one and I'm happy for you to buy the second one from me.

a while ago as of course you can't buy 1, I have a brand new unopened one if you're interested

I paid $116.55 (Â£82.53) for the both + shipping so I'd like to get half of that if possible
