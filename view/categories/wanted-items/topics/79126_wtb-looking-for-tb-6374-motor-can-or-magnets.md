Hey guys!
My motor had a bad sound and today i found the issue, it was a broken magnet inside the motor can.
Im going to need a new motor can or some spare magnets to get it working again. 
Is there anyone here that has a torqueboard 6374  spare can or magnets that i can buy in the EU?`

Thanks in advance!
