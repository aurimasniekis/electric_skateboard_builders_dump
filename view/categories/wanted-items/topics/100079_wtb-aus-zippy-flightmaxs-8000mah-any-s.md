hey all,
so for my cruiser build im wanting to use zippy FlightMax batteries (6x 5s 8000mah packs to get 10s3p 24ah) and i have 2, yet HobbyKing are out of stock and have no idea when they'll be back in stock (it's been out for months).

So basically I'm diverting to making my own packs out of the zippy cells. The ones on ebay are fucking expensive so i wanna see what yall have

Doesn't matter what s rating, just needs to be zippy 8000mah FlightMax's. 


also gotta be in Australia bc shipping batteries internationally is a bitch. 

Cheers.
