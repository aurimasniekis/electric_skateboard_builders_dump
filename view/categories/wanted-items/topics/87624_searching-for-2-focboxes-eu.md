@ju5t 

huge margins? what are you talking about?

The price of a FOCBOX on street-wing.com is ¬£124 for customers outside the EU and the price is ¬£148.80 including 20% VAT (which is not a margin and goes straight to the government).

The margin on those is about ¬£18 by the time I have paid for shipping and import duty into the UK. And out of that I need to deal with customer service, repairs/replacements and help when people get stuck.

and you might want to check the shipping costs, street wing has really cheap and fast shipping which brings the total cost down when compared with many other retailers

its no secret :slight_smile:

 i own street wing which is a limited company and a seperate legal entity.

Check my profile, it links to Street Wing and pretty much everyone who has been here for more than a minute knows I run the company.

Are u kidding me?

Steet-wing: 
148.80 + 22.60 = 171,4 pounds = 199‚Ç¨

eskating.eu
155.73 + 16,93 = 172,66 ‚Ç¨

30‚Ç¨ difference for what? Nothing. Dont get me wrong, but the price is better...

Anyway... street-wing is out of stock.

the 155‚Ç¨ from eskating is also including VAT... i just added the shipping cost! not the VAT.

Please tell us, why should we pay 30‚Ç¨ more on your store? Just a question. I dont want to blame or anything.

@StefanMe

the shipping you mentioned is too high
![image|453x500](upload://gJj3Ri3I3TeOSJ5ou7sFEcEFM51.png) 

Shipping is ¬£9.05, total cost inc VAT and shipping ¬£159.66 so approx ‚Ç¨186

Can you please let me know how you got the site to generate that shipping cost so I can do some debugging

my issue is not being mentioned, always happy to help where I can on stuff that is Street Wing related or even when it's nothing to do with the site or a purchase.

I do however take issue with statements like "HUGE margin" when it is not correct.

@StefanMe thanks man, I really appreciate it!

It's never good to see customers charged too much for postage and it saves me a job refunding the different in postage costs when customers order.

@DavidBanner @StefanMe

Jus as a side note the 155 on eskating website is without VAT, VAT is calculated at the check-out (new since this year) so with VAT 190

@e.board_solutions thanks for checking into that :)

so what you are saying is that it's actually  ‚Ç¨3.33 cheaper on Street Wing (before shipping) once you add the VAT!

@treenutter @mmaner would this be too much to ask for? It would help with official vendors being identified
