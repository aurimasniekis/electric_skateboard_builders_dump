Hi, is it even possible to get just battery in Eu?

Seems like most places sell just complete boards..

How about finding a 3d printed case and build a pack with better cells, like 40T if they fit ? That would be noice

Yes, was thinking about this also. Case seems quite wide indeed

maybe you can make it a 12s1p instead by eliminating all that extra space :P 

Can the inboard esc run on 12s?

its actually a 12s1P. The side of the casing has 2 extra cells.

Turns out I participated in inboards battery discussion a while ago, they seemed to use 20A cells in there

I hope this thread isn't dead.  I recently bought a used M1 and am very interested in making a custom battery pack for it with some higher capacity cells.

I opened up one of the PowerShift battery packs I got with the board and found the following

The cells they use are LG HE4 18650 2500mAh 20A.

The BMS is a PCM-L13S15-876(A).  However that BMS is a 13s, and the PowerShift only has 12 cells.  Also, one of the MOSFETs was missing from the BMS.  If you look closely you can see it missing in the picture Okami posted above.

I'm still learning about battery packs, but it seems like making one with some Samsung 40T 21700 4000mAh 30A would be pretty awesome.

If anyone has knowledge or experience they are willing to share, I'd LOVE to hear it.  

And if anyone wants to partner up on this project, it would be great to share the load and do this is bulk.
