I'm doing my first build and thought i'd check the forum to see if any1 has a motor to spare and also might be interested  in battery and charger.

Looking for a good single motor, preferably pretty low kv.
Battery/charger should be 6s plus.

I have one used SK3 6364 190kv (function unknown, can't test since I don't have any ESC) and one never used 6355 sealed 170kv Maytech.

Located outside Helsingborg.
