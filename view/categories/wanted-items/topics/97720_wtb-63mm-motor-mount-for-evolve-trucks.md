I'm looking for a motor mount to be able to use 63mm based motors on evolve trucks. I know that there are the unik mounts (https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/core-serie-support-moteur-pour-truck-evolve-supercarve-street-et-at/) but they are out of stock.

Any alternatives in a *comparable price range*? They should be shipped to germany.

Thx, saw that but with $170 they are very expensive.

Maybe you should add a price range.  Idk.  That might help

Ideally the price would be something like ~$70. That would be comparable to the ones from unik.

Unik's are the simplest among the threee major Evolve mount suppliers: [Janux](https://www.janux-esk8.com/product-page/evolve-gt-drive-system-kit), [ATC](https://allterraincreations.com/) or [Unik](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/core-serie-support-moteur-pour-truck-evolve-supercarve-street-et-at/)

I like how you can adjust the angle a bit.  Are you Australia based?

Thinking of starting a group buy on 63mm evolve motor mounts as I didnâ€™t find them anywhere in Europe. Anyone interested? CNC machined aluminum 7075 black anodized
