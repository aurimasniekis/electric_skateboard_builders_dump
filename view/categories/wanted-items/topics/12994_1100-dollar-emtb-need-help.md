Please try to do it on a ''NoSno'' board.. here's one on auction right now:

Would be tricky to place your huge battery there but who knows.. would save some weight for the board probably.. I also hear they are quite stable at fast speeds.. though, have not seen anyone do a mounts for them.. maybe nowind has done something on simlar axles / trucks but im not totally sure :)

What about the Battery cable length problem I keep hearing so much about?  Won't this be longer than 12"?  I'm trimming all my wire lengths to accomodate.  Am I making too much of a deal about this??

@SageTX NEVER add any longer than 12 inches....12 inches is ok just dont add any more. So say if your vesc wires are 2 inches and battery wires are 2 inches, make sure all the wires dont add to over about 16 inches

This is extremely dangerous. 
You are not considering an accident. 
A pack of batteries strap to your back is asking for disaster, think carefully about what you want to do regarding the batteries.

That's a ~14 pound battery not including bms and wire etc. that's a bit heavy and will throw your balance off

I've ridden with a laptop on my back + some other things in it.. I assume it could have been close to 13lbs for sure.. It was possible to feel the weight.. but unless you plan to do carving or things like that it is manageable, I think..

@Okami @mountainboardlover69
  To me The problem here is not the weight. The problem is the likelihood of an accident and damaging some lipos strap to your back is just a little bit too risky. :slight_smile:

What board are you planing to use ?  
If you have the cross section of the truck I can machine the mounts for a low price, you'll need to provide your design in  cad.
