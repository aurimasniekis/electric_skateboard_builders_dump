have run out of those rock solid enertion caliber mounts and am looking at getting some made locally, Brisbane Australia. cut from 10mm ally and probably going 6mm ally for the motor mount plate.
Cost of course will depend on numbers. I am after about 5 sets myself. 
Machinist has the drawings and a sample. hopefully get an indication of price and viable quantities next week.

It's the same mount enertion were doing - they made the file available after they stopped selling them.
for 63xx series motors.

Hoping to get enough to keep prices under $30 aud.

I don‚Äôt think it would be too hard to drill a hole, where as modding a .stl is a bit tricky. I might be in for 1 depending on price.

Ps try HK for bolts, they are pretty cheap, IDK if they have M6 tho

The files are open source so it can be done easier than drilling a hole :)

stl files are just a guide. the machinist has to manually punch in the design anyway. Will look at extending the motor plate and adding a pulley.
Am going to base a price around 20 of them. Machinist is recovering from cancer treatment so is a little slow the week of his chemo.

Am waiting for my machinist. He is having chemo and radiotherapy. :( 
Little spot on his cheek turned out to be melanoma.

He's ok - but the treatment knocks him around a bit.

Hoping to catch him this week

sorry for the delay guys,

Mark is doing ok - another fortnight of radiation and chemo - he's getting knocked around a bit.
Treatment is brutal. Tough watching the physical changes - weight loss - tiredness. Cancer is a motherfucker. treatment is a bitch.

He has some other work he is behind and has to tackle first - it's still going to happen - just taking time.

He only gets about 3 hours a day on a good day when he can work.

another teaser. tomorrow we will be doing the motor plate, in Ally for better heat transfer, then I will be stress testing.

will fit the racestar motors same mount design as the enertion mounts. 

am looking at annodizing next week. most likely plain black.

Will the motor plate be long enough to accommodate 63XX motors with 107mm wheels? The motor and wheel will touch if centre distance is 85mm. I'd need a bit of clearance between them, too. 95mm centre distance or so. Do you have an idea on what yours are?

EDIT: Yep! I definitely didn't remember that motors are on the opposite side.

am not understanding mate. motor and wheels are on opposite sides of the mount. belt sizes and various gearing options will allow 63xx motors with 107s.
