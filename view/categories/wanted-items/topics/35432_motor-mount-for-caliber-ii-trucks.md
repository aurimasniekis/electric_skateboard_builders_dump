Hey. I'm looking for a motor mount for caliber hanger.
Location: UK
Preferably adjustable in length, angle and motor size 63xx and 50xx.
I could buy a new one exactly as needed for 50£(shipping included) from Alien. But looking for cheaper one if possible.
If there's someone with a mount they don't need, send me pics and price.
Just don't offer me one for 49,99£ ahahaha

Have a nice day

Currently updating it with the V2 clamp piece that is a 2 piece set instead of the set screw collar that slips over.
It would end up being about 38£ shipping included.

A few weeks tops. If you are willing to wait I promise it would be worth it :slight_smile:

I saw your original post and remember that you explained all the details of  mount and that you listen to suggestions and  feedback.      So I can wait for couple weeks. 
If my opinion helps, would it be better, easier and easily replaceable to have a clamp with bolts & nuts instead of threaded clamp?
