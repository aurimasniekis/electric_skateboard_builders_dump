Hey Everyone,

I recently had an unfortunate incident involving my remote which ended with a missing trigger and shattered power switch.  I'm looking for a new one and really wouldn't wanna pay the 20$ shipping from HK, so I thought I would check and see if anyone else has one laying around.

Does anyone know if the one on Amazon is the same one?  I am looking to reprint my case mod (used to have the john case remix of the badwolf) and use the MadMunkey one because it is nice and slim.  I also really enjoyed the reliability and the rechargeable battery.  

If all else fails I will just get it from HK.

Only difference Ive seen between the oned Ive bought on Amazon is that some have mini usb and some are micro usb charging ports. Both fit in the case mods I use just fine though.

You live in Riverside? Lets ride! Im only like 30 mins from you.

That looks pretty sweet! Little more expensive than printing myself one but definitely cool. His enclosures are sick too
