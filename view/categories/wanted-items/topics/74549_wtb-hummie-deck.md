I've got one I would get rid of. I think I spent 120 cause it was a first batch board. Where would this be shipping too?

I've also got a psychotiller split enclosure for it too if you are interested.

Thanks for your answer, unfortunately i live in Paris.
I would prefer to find an european option, shipping sounds to be expensive from US.
Maybe i will wait until the next group buy from @bigben if can't find one before.
