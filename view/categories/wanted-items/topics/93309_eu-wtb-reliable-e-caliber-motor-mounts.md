Probably @Boardnamics or @dickyho mounts should be good for ecalibers. I think dickyho ships worldwide for cheap.

already ordered some time ago but sadly the package got lost by the postal service. But i read some threads that a single "grub-screw" Motor mount will always come loose and that two-piece style clamps or similar hold onto the hanger better.. ?

PS: As soon as the trouble with the delivery company is sorted out i will almost certainly order some parts from him again. He was very helpful so far ! :)

Just another vote for dickyho's caliber mounts, never once did they slip out of place for 3 months back when I had Caliber trucks.

The dickyho mounts I got from @chrischo1996 would not stay put... and they were very soft, bent all the time... had to try other mounts. So I'm onto the boardnamics mounts... made in USA üëç

I haven't had the chance to abuse the Boardnamics mounts like I did the dickyho mounts (3-5 miles each way commute 3-4x per week on crappy roads), but the motor mounting plate is almost 2x thicker. And the hangar clamp has 2 bolts/2 peice clamp, much more of a positive clamping setup than the c type clamp.

Also @Boardnamics lives nearby so I just went over to pick them up, EU shipping might take some timeüò¥
