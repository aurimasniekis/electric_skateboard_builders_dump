10mm gear/pulleys are a little hard to find.

Best (but most expensive) is beltingonline.com (in the UK, so somewhat close).

I also find some on ebay you can select 10mm bore from dropdown selection.  Almost always aluminum, and no keyway, so just grub screws to hold it (not a problem i'd just add a bit of blue loctite).

Any motor pulley can have a 10mm bore, if you have access to a lathe.  I had to bore out all my motor pulleys to the correct diameter.  It only takes a minute.  Your local machine shop might even do it for free
