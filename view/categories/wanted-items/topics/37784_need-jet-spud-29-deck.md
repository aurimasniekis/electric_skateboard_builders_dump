They're out of stock atm btw.

I doubt you will find anyone to sell, just because if you get one you want to keep it, but hey, best of luck finding a seller.

I've got 1, it's all ready drilled for a volt meter and switch though. Also, it's promised to @GrecoMan but if he doesn't want it I'll prolly sell it. 

It was originally for my son but he won't get off the RE Caldera (@treenutter) for 5 minutes ðŸ˜€

I'm in no hurry, your call brother. If you decide you don't want it let these folks know so someone else can use it.  I hate that it's just sitting there, hurts a little ðŸ˜€

oh my god this is the hardest decision of my life ðŸ˜«
if I had the $$ iâ€™d pick it up right now and use for a different build.

hopefully @JLabs stocks the spud again...

**@mmaner now has a spud for sale!**

Don't overdraft dude.  If you want it I'll save it, told you I would. I just knew you got a new deck so wasn't sure if you still wanted it or not.

As I said earlier the deck has been drilled out for a volt meter and switch. If anyone wants the deck I'll send you links for the switch and meter at Amazon.  

I also have an extra set of Freebord S2 Bindings, bindings are awesome with this deck. 

I'll take $100 for the deck and $50 for the bindings or $130 for both. Shipping in the US should be less than $20.

It's really not.  It's much wider, has only a minimal kick tail, has wheel wells and push wells.

Yeah mike said most of it. The curves are amazing.. so sexy (Iâ€™m totally biased). It also has a long wheelbase and a short deck size making it great for commuting or use with binding to reach higher speeds. Oh yeah, and itâ€™s sexy.. did i mention that?

only in 2d. the 3d concave is really nice. double the wheel base of a popsicle.
