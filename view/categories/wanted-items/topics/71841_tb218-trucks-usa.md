Looking for a good deal on some TB218 trucks.  Ideally want something clean and unmolested.

Thanks!

You are probably going to have a hard time finding any that are without scratches from motor mounts anywhere on the forum.  If you are interested I have an extra pair but they are fairly beat up. They work just fine just not that visually appealing.

You can get them Directly from TB

collections/longboard-trucks/products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks

They are well priced and they ship very fast.

What @Battosaii said... 65$ is really cheap for trucks considering the only real comparable trucks in size are SurfRodz with 200mm hangers... 

If u want an unmolested set drop the 65... if u want a scratch and dent set for around half that, try ur hand here at the forums... but looking for like new trucks for scratch and dent prices won't happen.
