The remote works fine but I seemed to have fried my receiver (mistakenly had my ubec set to 9v instead of 5v - this is my theory anyway).

Would like to have it shipped soon.

Thanks, yes it is the same. There are several options out there... however I was hoping someone local had one so I didn't need to wait until the middle of July to get it from China.
