Ain't happening unless you get a small battery. 

- unity: $250-300
- deck: $50 (for a cheap one)
- enclosure: $10 (ikea) - $50 (psychotiller)
- shipping: $$$

leaves you at **most** $200 for a battery. good luck.

You really need to make reasonable requests. No one is going to give you stuff at a loss. Diy esk8 is expensive and cutting corners with a low budget will always result in wasted parts and buying new ones to replace it. Its far cheaper to save up a little extra money and build something that works.
