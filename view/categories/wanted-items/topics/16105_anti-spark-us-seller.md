some bms have a light switch. especially if you order a custom run. or wait for the open source batman.

Never thought about getting a custom run.  Good point!  Thanks.  I was also thinking about the batman BMS, but it's still in beta,  hopefully I might be able to incorporate them in something later. I'll look at some bms makers then, thanks
