Hi I live in France anybody have a used drive kit(Wheel pulley, motor pulley and belt) laying around or is willing to sell me one at a low price? I've got a motor mount from @fedestanco  , which is a copy of the enertion motor mount. My motor has an 8mm shaft and my wheels are 83mm Alien wheels, which are like the clones I m pretty sure.
Thank you
