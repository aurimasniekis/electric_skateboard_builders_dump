My advice is "buy used" and "good luck"

I think (am almost sure) that 50dollar is to low. Chinese wheels already cost more.

Yeah... good luck finding a set of used chinese pneumatic wheels for $50, let alone a good set. 

A brand new kit from Psychotiller including all the fixings is $300, and it's a hell of a deal. Fantastic machining. I had a set of prototypes from him, and they were great. With that as a benchmark, I'd say it'd be unrealistic to find a full set for less than $100, and $150 is probably closer to reality. 

The AT kit from Evolve is $200, but is designed for GT and GTX boards.

Not to mention, you'll have to make everything fit - The deck shape of the 1 looks like it doesn't have as much clearance for wheelbite as I think you'll need.

Do you have access to a 3d printer? You can then get the 6x2 tires+ tube from Alibaba for as low as about 4 dollars I think. You can then 3d print the hubs.
