Hello,

I missed getting in on the sale of the new V4 Speed Drives, but have the money for them now.  Ideally I'd like to get 2 sets, but I'll settle for whatever I can get.  I would prefer an XL, but if that's not possible, then the R version will be just fine.  Willing to pay a little extra...   

Hope to hear from somebody soon!
