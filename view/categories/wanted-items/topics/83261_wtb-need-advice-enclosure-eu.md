Hi,
Ok, so I got a small problem with my enclosure solution. I just can't find a fitting enclosure. It would need to be around 65cm in length, 4-5cm in height and 20cm wide. If anybody got an idea or a fitting enclosure for sale just hit me up.. :slight_smile:

Where in the EU are you? I run a fibreglass manufacturing company - could easily knock that out cheaply

I live in Austria. How much would something like that cost roughly.. I will send you the exact dimensions later on. :slight_smile:
Thank you...

For a one off? Probably in the region of £40. If there was a few wanted, more like £25 each.
