I have two that I am not using, but they need new bearings. I damaged them taking them in and out so many times. They still work with the damaged bearings tho.

I can do $30 each shipped if you or anybody else is interested. You can buy new bearings on ebay for $6.

My bad, i thought Enertion pulleys were $40. I just realized I paid $40 for the pulley kit. How about $10 each shipped?

We just found a stack of 12mm wide alum wheel pulleys during a tidy up. Is this what you wanted?

Deal! Are the bearings usable at all, or should i buy new ones? Got pictures of the pulley?

@onloop I want the nylon pulleys but getting 4 of them is $60 and shipping is $32.. I'd much rather buy from you if it were more economical. Unfortunately i don't have anything else to buy for free shipping.

Bearings are totally usable. Tested them myself. They look worse than they really are. Maybe you should wait till you get them and see for yourself before you order new bearings. These pulleys are practically brand new. I only used them for a week.
