That sucks. Sell it to me.
I've got a weak 10s2p battery that needs a cheap vesc for a light weight short board.  Sell me your disappointment. 
Or just give it to me to free yourself of your shameful purchase.

*im totally gonna lowball you.  Lol im looking for cheap haha sorry.

Is space an issue?
If not I'd just go for 2 flipsky vesc 4.12's You can get them on ebay for 50 bucks a pop I've heard some people negotiate it down to like 40 45? (Via ebay messages)

Well then I'd look into 4.12's.

In my mind I think there like in-between HK and TB vesc's But I dunno maybe you'd know better.

Edit: you know what basically HK vesc's running 4.12 software.

we'll get this debatable fact,

I've heard of many issues even on 10s with the 4.2s

But I've heard less issues (actually none) on them flipsky 4.12s 
I actually got one maybe I should get of my lazy ass and test them and be of some help LoL.

Im getting a free 10s2p made from less then desirable cells. Its a meh battery.  But it's better than the 6s3p in there now so ill take it.
Figured it'd be worth even a minimal upgrade to the vesc if i can do it cheap.

yeah 4.2s should work fine just  follow @mmaner's guide and set them up right.

It's just I doubt they'd be any cheaper.

Goodluck man I hope u get them next to free ;).
