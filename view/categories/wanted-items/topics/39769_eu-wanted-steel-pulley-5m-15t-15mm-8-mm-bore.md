Alu pulleys are worn out somewhat, looking for steel replacements.

x2 for dual drive.

I think [this gear](https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-Motor-Gear-Red-For-BRH5065-BRH5045-Brushless-Balancing-Scooter-Motor-p-1139957.html) meets all that criteria.  The two I have are steel.  You may want to ask to make sure they didn't change to aluminum.

Profile mentions 5gt. Any issues with HTD5 belts?

these have been used by evolve owners with HTD belts and worked just fine. But I think they are aluminium.

ah, excellent. Thanks. Looks like the profile fits just fine.
Ordered two at eskating.eu and will get a few from banggood. Alu or not, the price is good.

At first I was like: "Wow!! 6€ for 2 steel gears, such a great deal!" But then they charge like 2€ for each option and it ends up being like 15€ :joy:
In the other hand, I've never bought steel gears so I don't know if thats the normal price but considering you can get 2 aluminum ones for 5€, it seems a bit overpriced to me.

I hope they will be worth it..
The alu pulley has become very sharp after driving through mud for about two weeks. A new belt will instantly fail :expressionless:

Though it's obvious from the uneven wear that I have to improve my pulley alignment, it's also obvious that aluminum and dirt roads don't go together.
