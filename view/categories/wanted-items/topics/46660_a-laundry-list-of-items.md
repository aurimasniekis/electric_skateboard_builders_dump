Hey everyone I’m going to get right on with my rather large list of parts that I am looking for. New or used is perfectly fine by me. Anywho here goes:

Trampa flexible enclosure for kaly style 2 in 1
Battery pack. I’m looking for a 10s3p+
Motor pullies for kegels
That basically covers my wishlist here & thanks for reading
