I don't think it's a specific model or anything. But we've been using it for a long time. It's a 12S 60A BMS.

Basicly I'm wondering if I go downhill on a full charge will I lose breaking?

@Skyart15 Depends if you have a very steep hill or if it's a tiny hill. Ideally, if you ride around the block before you go downhill you should be fine. I haven't heard of any issues with our pack having issues going downhill on a  full charge. We're looking into offering a braking resistor pcb in the near future.
