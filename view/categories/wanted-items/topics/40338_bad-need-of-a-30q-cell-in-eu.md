When do you need them by? I'm about to order (probably in the next week or so), a bunch for a couple of packs I'm doing, I could add a couple in the order for you?

Unfortunately I've only got Sony Konion VT6 in stock...

Hey @stormboard1 I have one leftover from my 10S3P. I ordered 31 to be sure. It has never been charged/discharged/soldered/welded or anything. I am from Slovakia.

What exactly happened? Can you share pictures? It the short was not sustained then your cell might still be ok.

@darkkevind thanks man hoping have it asap lol so close to having first board finished
@Martinsp  thatd be great thanks man
@PXSS not 100% as it happened so quick but i think a piece nickel shorted on the cell between the cell casing and and the positive of the cell which caused a spark and fire at end of the nickel for a millisecond before i grabbed it and pulled it off which sliced one my fingers baad lol this is the cell...checked the cell its at 3.4v

I shorted some cells too when building various packs... They work just fine, no drift. You might be able to get away with that...

PM you location so I can look up shipping if you are interested.

BTW it is from nkon if that matters to you.

Can you take a picture from top view? The side of the can is all negative. The damage there isn't bad. I would cut heat shrink, clean the can and apply new heat shrink.
