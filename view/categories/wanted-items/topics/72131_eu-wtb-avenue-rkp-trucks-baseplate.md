Hello,

as my topic said, i'm looking for a set of Avenue Trucks or baseplates. I know the chance are remote but maybe someone wants to depart from them or knows someone who has a pair. 
Everything else can be done via pm.

They are moded to fit evolve supercarves. Why? Because I needed flex in my carbon GT when I went to Tahoe summer ski slopes and trails.
