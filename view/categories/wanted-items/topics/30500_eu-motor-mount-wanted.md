Hi there

I was in the group buy for @Shogu12 but he doesn't respond to anyone anymore. Hope he's doing ok
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-us-22-carbon-motor-mounts-anodized-aluminum-clamp/20795
@thisguyhere bought some (if not all) of his stock and shipped it to murica

I was wondering if there are any people in europe who can help me and possibly others on a mount for caliber 2 trucks?
If not i will order a mount from thisguyhere, although it seems a little like a waste of money to get such a part shipped across the world :sweat_smile:  

Thanks!
