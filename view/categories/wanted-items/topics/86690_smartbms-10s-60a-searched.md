Hello Eboarder!
I'm searching for a Smartbms.
I know I also could buy them from china, but I live in Europe and I don't wanna pay those much costum duties. 
It should be able to handle 60A because I'm building a 10s3p battery.
So if there is anyone who wants to sell me one, pleas let me know 😉👇

As they all made in China anyway...and shipping is free... your arguments doesn’t count.
Just get this and good

Always depends what value the Chinese company declares. 💁‍♂️ 
20% Import fee would be 8€. As shipping is free it’s probably still cheaper than source it somewhere else. I guess. Do not have big experience with Import stuff.
