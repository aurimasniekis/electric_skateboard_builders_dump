Loose magnets or faulty bearings?

@marcmt88 might have extra motor cans, will require a shaft transplant though.

If not, maybe open up the motor and see if you can glue/epoxy the loose magnet(s) back in place?

Easy fix if the magnets not broke yetüòÖ just open it up and glue the magnets back. 
Before you throw the motor away, let me know ‚òùÔ∏èüòå

If it clicks while turning slow it doesn‚Äôt sound like magnets.
I would tag @torqueboards to get the size of there bearings.

The bearing probably says a number on the sheild of it.  Generally they start with a 6

Also, the reason the mags wont move when ur tryung is ypu need to remove the retaining ring at the top otherwise u need to be able to swperate the mag from the can by pulling it directly off lol

See here how there isnt that matte gray ring, it will just pop off w/ a flat head screw driver and a few LIGHT taps in different spots so u dont warp it

So u know its a TB lol

No theres an issue with the recipient that i was assuming would be kept private for now, but since he wants to air laundry out... 

No there has been an issue with flooding and wet roads. Today is finally clear and the roads shpuld be dry enpugh by morning that i dont have to uber around anymore (15-30$ a day 6 days a week between work and school) topcloud doesnt understand that a student working 2 part time jobs (sub 20 hrs a week at each) barely has money to get arpund let alone eat AND uber... so dont come at me sideways like ypu understand what the fuck ur talking about and forget about the motors

Not to mention dealing with a lithium fire and getting 1st/2nd degree burns on my feet (which i really didnt want to talk about but is another reason i havent been skating)

Just saying if you have issues to send out things than better for now don‚Äôt offer anybody something that makes you just troubles... üôÑ
I have no idea what was with who ever...and I don‚Äôt piss on your leg...just say don‚Äôt make your self work and disappoint other if you can‚Äôt manage it. If you can all is good üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

PS: if you had a fire than please share your experience, it could save others from get injured as well...

PS PS: hope you and your board recover soon from it...if that is even possible...

I was gonna share after we (my pregnant gf and myself) finished remodeling our bedroom where the fire started to show a before and after with a acurate damage report of cost... but thats neither here nor there... its spring break i was gonna ship all the packages i have out monday (none of its esk8 stuff besides topcloud) i took off from both my jobs, school is out, and i had plans to drop everything off monday morning on my way to the dmv to get my occupational DL (a friend is taking me and covering the cost of my license)  THEN i have to turn around and tear down my motors heads to replace the head gaskets, radiator, brakes, oil, and oil pump over the course of spring break so i have a running truck... 

My problems with 1 member of this community shouldnt inhibit my ability to help others, especially when i wasnt even trying to makw money off this... I have been in ur shoes with tb motors and i know how irritating it can be to want to ride and have busted motors, hence why i said id givw them to you for the cost of shipping

And to show you i actually have the rims

I‚Äòm not concerned about the money thing... but was worried that you don‚Äôt have a time to ship them...as you said buy your own, it sucks to don‚Äôt be able to drive and waiting for parts. Same here if somebody is waiting for your parts for weeks but could have a running board already just by ordering a new one or get a bell from somebody else.
That‚Äôs all I said. If you can ship them out in time than all is good and no need for you to write endless stories around it. No need for justification.

So the Chinese pack got on fire?

My thing is, a cpuple weeks before (when the weather was nice) he bought a set of matrix pro 2 trucks, and a complete drive train for around 500$, i sent it in a couple days... it was never an issue to ship just a series of unfortunate events and weather

I don‚Äôt mind what was and what caused which conditions. Those things you need to clearify with people who bought from you. I didn‚Äôt bought from you, so i don‚Äôt mind.
All you wrote you should explain your unhappy customer and he will understand and believe, or not.

My only concern was and still is, that you shouldn‚Äôt offer things (even for free) if you don‚Äôt have a time to sent them.
If you have time to send things than again, all is good and no need to discuss other topics.

again monday is when im taking my parcels to ship, adding one more wouldnt have been an issue... and he's the only one of my customers that has had an issue, and when anyone starts giving me ultimatems where neither condition is doable and refuses to listen to reason 1st thing when i wake up to go to work and then blocks me... makes it kinda hard to communicate...
