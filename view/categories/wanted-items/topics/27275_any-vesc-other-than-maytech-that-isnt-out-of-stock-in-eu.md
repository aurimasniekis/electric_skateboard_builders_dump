So far I've only found Maytech VESC that is in stock in EU, some have said it's not the best vesc so I'm asking, if there is anything else.

Thanks

I second esk8.de. Although they are not cheap, they are worth it.

You can also check this list of vendors:

I bought 2x VESC from them (esk8.de). All working very well! Well worth the cost.
