they are sadly out of stock from hobbyking, maybe a fellow member has a working one or preferably new one lying around, only after one. 
thanks

Have one in box, never used 149kv. Gonna be costly to aus tho.

I'd recommend these instead: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-192kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html

i havent heard of any issues with the sk8. can you not get it from the international warehouse?

I've got 2 of those motors. just letting you know it's an absolute pain in the ass to mount onto tb218s. just sayin güòÉ

it's in stock there. if you're doing a big order try to change everything in your cart to international. it takes like 4 days from Hong Kong. my order to Sydney took about that long

hk mounts dont mount onto tb trucks. also the mounts are thick as so it'll be difficult. get @dickyho mounts. much easier
