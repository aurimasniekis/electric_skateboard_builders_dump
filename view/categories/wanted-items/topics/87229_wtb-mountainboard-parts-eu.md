Hey Guys.
I want to build a Mountainboard and thought I first check out the second hand market before going for new parts.

So please offer anything:
* Motor Mounts
* Decks
* VESC / FOCBOX Dual
* Complete Boards

I really like the Trampa Boards but I am not close minded.
I am from Austria so it would make sense if you come from Europe because of the Shipping.

Thanks

A couple of options on eBay (whether they will ship from UK to Austria though, you could ask üëçüèª)
