Paris style should fit as the hanger is round. I'll check dimensions of everything and report back

Correct. But im using a 10mm bearing because surfrodz. But yeah,  normal skateboard bearings.  It's the pully that has a special bearing.
But i have pully bearings with 12mm inner diameter

the shafts pressed in, or only fixed with a scrub screw?
maybe it´s possible to change the shaft.
but than i also don´t know where you can get a 10mm shaft which fit to the trucks.

I have a pair of MBS ATS trucks that you could have for free if you pay shipping. They have 9.5mm axels. You can get a set of bearings from MBS.com that would be 9.5x22 for regular wheels or 9.5x28 for Mtn Board wheels. Also here’s a link below for some bearings that are 12x28 not sure what size OD you need but these work with Rockstar 2 hubs.

Edit: also @Rithblu makes some badass motor mounts for these trucks. I think I paid like $100. Anyway, his quality is epic and he’s also a nice guy.

You could get some calibers for those.  don't need those big hangers

I thought the sealed ones wont fit side by side because of the extra can length.

Mate maybe.  I just know you can get 55's on there so maybe that bearing housing messes things up.
Thinking about it you would probs need the ecalibers anyway.  I don't know just enjoying the convo.  You good pal?

Getting by. Staying busy

All my pullys run bearings.  So i figured i would trim the hangers a but for more axle length

Ask around then because calibers are easily got.  You don't have to cut much off the hanger either.  LHB did a good vid about it.  Always nice to watch that crazy man anyway

Its like that hey?  Feels like we've been here forever lol.  I did lurk though on and off for ages.  Like 2 years.  Found it by accident when I was converting the kids board to lipo and just popped in to read and then disappear again.  Much like I'm doing with the efoil forum.  I will actually join that one soon though for a read time count.

Wish i had lol.  I would be one of the true old timers.  I just wasn't into it for myself back then though.  I just raped the place for knowledge.  Someone back then said you could run 8s through a 6s esc and yes you could but only for about 10 minutes and then fire.  lmfao.   I was heavily into building and racing rc cars.  The esk8 was a side bar for the kids.
