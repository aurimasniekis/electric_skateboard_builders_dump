I am looking for a 10s3p enclosure and cant seem to find any. I am going for a split style setup on my loaded vanguard so I do not want an enclosure which covers all of the deck, ruining flex :slight_smile: 

If anybody has any advice on where to buy such an enclosure or have one they want to sell, that would be awesome!

Look up eboardsperu. It’s @Eboosted ‘s site. There should be what you are looking for there.

Thanks for the reply, I think he only has 10s4p enclosures though. Will go for it if another 10s3p option does not present itself :slight_smile:

There’ll just be a little spare space in the enclosure. It’s very tight anyway so probably about as near perfect as you’ll get?

Hey I’m doing a carbon fiber enclosure (10s3p vanguard) for myself. Where are you located? I could make an additional one for you.
