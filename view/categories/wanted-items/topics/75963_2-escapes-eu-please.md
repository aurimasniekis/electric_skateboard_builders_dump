I can feel you man, don't give up! 

Why not try Flipsky 6.6 for now? Eventually.

Edit : Didn't know the issue with bimmer.

I’m on 6.6 dual, which are working well apart from voltage readings... trouble is my metr pro is the only battery readings I have on my hummie.

Metr is a great app, true.

Why not try using a standard BT thingy and use a simpler app? Maybe you can get correct reading values this way. Just a temp solution till Metr issue with your 6.6 is solved or you manage to get ESCapes
