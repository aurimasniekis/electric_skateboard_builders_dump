Man, you spent the $$$ on the Lacroix.  Get some Surfrodz trucks with adjustable baseplates.

honestly I'm going to try and keep the mbs trucks and run urethane, I have Tq board's trucks laying around so I wana just try eem. Figured the riser would be somewhat cheap and easy way to try urethane before I buy some expensive bearings.

Ok, that makes more sense. Though, the surfrodz are fuggin sweet on the Lacroix with 107s.

The second I ordered a LaCroix I was like "how do I get urethane on here?" your build was inspiring as hell and drop dead gorgeous. These are the bearings I think I need to just buy and try https://www.vxb.com/Bearing-Sealed-12x22x5-Metric-p/kit20376.htm

Worse come to worse I just copy and paste your truck/mount set up, but I really really wana keep the MBS trucks.

It would probably be cheaper to buy surf rodz and adjustable risers.  The only 30/35 degree risers that are available quickly and worth using are the OKP risers, and that's only because I have a set but they cost a ton and I wanna get a ton out of them :slight_smile:.
