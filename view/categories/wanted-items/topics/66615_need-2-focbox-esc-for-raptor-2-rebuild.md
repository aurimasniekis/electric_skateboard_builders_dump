A while ago I purchased a TorqueBoards kit here on our forum advertised 'as new'; regretfully, after finally finding a home for them, both TB ESCs failed within ten minutes (one was actually DOA).

I'll look to have both TB ESCs repaired later, yet I'm rebuilding a Raptor2 that I bought here from a friend and now I want to keep it all-Enertion.

Would anyone happen to have two FOCBOXes that they want to sell or trade?  

Thanks!
