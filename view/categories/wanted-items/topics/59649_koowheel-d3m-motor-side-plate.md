I need a Koowheel D3M side motor plate/cover. Mine is a bit rough and I'm not sure if I wanna keep riding like this. An electrically broken motor would do as well, I'll manage to take that out.
EU/Romania.

Ah cool. It's a waiting game then :slight_smile:
Hope I fix it as it's been pretty great so far. It works no problems, but I'm afraid the part will completely fail, and at that point I presume the magnets are going to get messed up, so I'm trying to save it before it goes on me.

Contact Maytech, the ones from the 90mm motors they sell works  on them without an issue :-)
