Dude:

I know it is still pricey, but it is the best I have used to date and at a reduced group buy price that literally began today for a limited time. 

Get that shit engraved!

If you use Mini Remote you can use multiple receivers.  Which allows you to make both drivetrains independent along with cool stuff like brakelights on your helmet.

I have a new NanoX, but it will cost more than a Mini Remote from aliexpress.  But that will take a month or more to get to you.  What's more important: time, money, quality, or stealth/pocketability?

time: buy Mini Remote from USA vendors on this forum or USA NanoX (I have one)
money: buy Mini from alibaba
quality: Hoyt puck remote
stealth/pocketability: benchwheel
```

I have an extra mini remote I can sell. I think I got it for 35 bucks. Attach some shipping and it's yours. I can take pictures later tonight when I get home.
