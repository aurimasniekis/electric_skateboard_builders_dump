Hey if you want the flywheel pully cage you can get it on . I have a used pair and willing to sell it if you're interested. They are really worn resistant.

Is this what you're looking for? I'll sell the how pulley and mount for $15. These work on conventional caliber trucks so...

@joeadams101 Traitor! You shouldn't be publicly seen buying/using pulleys. Direct drives only
