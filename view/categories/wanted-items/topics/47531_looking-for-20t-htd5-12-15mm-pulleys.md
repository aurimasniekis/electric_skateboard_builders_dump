Fairly certain they are unavailable to order from torque boards.

I have 2 brand new ones from TB, if they are out, but I can't imagine shipping from me would be any better.

No that's USPS priority to USA.  Not sure how$40 happens.  That's absurd.  I'd call them and try that route if it stays $40 to ship

I'd call. That's expensive.  Also what type of build and gear ratio is this going on?  20T is pretty tall gearing.

I bought [This one](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F262632208084) and it took 2 weeks to ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. It's heavy and sturdy, well built

I have a bunch of the 16t version of that pulley, never had an issue with them.

I'm with 6s setup running mostly on flats, want to test it out if I get little more top speed compared to 15T

What's your wheel size and wheel pulley teeth?
And motor.


Just don't think you will get anywhere remotely close to the theoretical top speed going from 15t to 20t on a 6s..

Going from 15 to 18 teeth is a pretty big jump and is going to give you better results than 20t, but idk really without all the info.

My wheels are 97mm motors 36t wheel pulley 200kv. I'm not expecting crazy results on switching Pulleys

I can't say about 6s, but when :ghost: I "upgraded" to a 20/36T setup on my 90mm 12s 190kv 6374 and although it was way faster, current control just didn't feel right. Acceleration was noticeably low and speed is really fluctuant. You only go way faster if you are light. Switched back to 16T after two weeks.
Hill climbing is also out the window FYI. :mountain:
Better upgrading to a 12s setup. :man:t2:

You will simply not be able to get your motor up to speed.


Your top speed could possibly end up lower than with 15 teeth.

Which is why I asked his setup.  I had 18/36 on 12s dual 6374, it had the power but I could for sure see a difference between 18t and 15t.
