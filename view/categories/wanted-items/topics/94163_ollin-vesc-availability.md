Does anyone know when the Ollin VESCs will be back in stock? I burnt my cheap Flipsky 4.12 and I want something that will last, and I heard that this is one of, if not the best single motor VESC out there.

FWIW my Ollin vesc broke and gave me a concussion after a couple months. My Focboxes, however, have been going strong for over a year and a half.

From my knowledge, Focboxes don't come in single motor variants though...or am I wrong?

Focbox is single motor, Focbox Unity is dual. But you're kind of right in the sense that the focbox single is no longer being made. You might be able to find it on the user market though.

No I didn't. The VESC failed on me, was not user error.

To be clear, the VESC didn't give you a concussion...the fall gave you a concussion.  You can fall on any VESC.

I don't think anyone reading it would think that the vesc fell on my head and gave me a concussion :joy: but perhaps I'm giving people more credit that I should. The vesc failure was a direct contributor to my fall and resulting concussion though.

There's always a risk, but to sell you have to be a "Regular" member on here for whatever that's worth to you. Most people will ask to send via paypal "friends & family" which is always risky unless you know the person.

This is why I wish I could draw :slight_smile:

Im just saying that any ESC can fail, any of them.  Ollin fail less than most.  By saying that the VESC caused your concussion you make a purposly inflammatory statement that doesn't tell the complete truth.

I never said Ollin vescs are bad, that's why i prepended my statement with "FWIW" "For what it's worth". It's defines my statement as anecdotal.

The statement came across as you dismissing Ollin ESC as unreliable in favor of a discontinued ESC with no better track record, based on your own single experience. And then without any evidence you blamed a device failure for a crash.

Um you're just making assumptions now. There is evidence, when I first posted about it over a year ago. Again my experience is anecdotal and in no way applicable to everyone's experiences. Yes I am blaming a device failure for my crash, because that is what happened.

Burden of proof lies in whoever is making the claim. Feel free to link me.

FWIW, I'm not actually saying that your particular ESC didn't fail. I'm saying that you're coming in making statements of authority without backing up what you're saying. 

Furthermore, it's actually pretty difficult to determine an exact point of failure unless you've done a complete post-mortem analysis, and even then it's guesswork simply because these systems lack the sensor data granularity & logging to make it very accurate.

Many different factors at play. It's hard to say whether or not an ESC failed due to an internal defect or due to external environmental circumstances such as heat, backdriven current spikes from impacts or physicality on the motors; any number of abnormalities beyond standard operating range in the power system can cause a mosfets and other more fragile components to fail. 

The bottom line here is that all ESCs will fail over time and use. The FOCBOX has had plenty of failures and is considered one of the more robust ESCs on the market. All ESCs can and will fail. Your personal one time experience doesn't immediately condemn a device.

> I’m saying that you’re coming in making statements of authority without backing up what you’re saying.

and AGAIN, I never said my experience is applicable to everyone. What's so hard to understand about that? My experience is anecdotal, I don't need to prove anything to you or anyone, I'm simply stating the experience I personally had. I only care that I know the VESC failed, I don't really care if you believe it or not.

> FWIW you gave yourself a concussion.

Burden of proof is on you for this one.

That's the point.  You made a claim with no evidence.  

We are all being cordial here and your'e being hostile. so let me make it plain.  If you gonna let stupid fall out of your mouth, you WILL be called on it.

Nothing you've said to this point has had any basis in fact, just saying some stuff that cant be backed up with the sole objective being to cause a well known and respected vendor grief.  Maybe google "scientific method" if you wanna no more.  Either way, until you can be logical this is whats gonna keep happening.

Have a nice day.

What claim did I make? That my VESC failed within months and caused my fall? That's complete fact. I'd agree with you if maybe I said "Ollin VESCs are bad and will fail on you", but that's not what I said.

I stand by everything I've said so far which is essentially recounting my own personal experience with ollin/focbox vescs. If I'm going to be chastized by the community for telling my personal story so be it, but I believe I did nothing wrong.

Additionally, I never called anyone names or threatened them. You guys have been more rude to me throughout this conversation as your message has already proven.

nobody is chastising you.  the statement you made was inflammatory, by any standard, and I'm not the only one that thinks so.  All I'm asking is that you provide some evidence of what happened to the VESC.

This statement has the following absolute content.

`My Ollin VESC broke, but my FoCBox didn't.  Ollin caused me to sustain a concussion.`

Theres a lot going on there, If you honestly think negligence on Ollin's part caused you to sustain a concision then call him out publicly for it.  It can be debated and maybe a resolution reached, if theres a an issue it needs to be known.

I don't own any Ollin VESC's currently, I bought one used and had zero issues with it, later it was sold with the board it was in.  From every source I have access too and everyone that I speak to on a regular basis, Ollin's gear is top notch.

All I'm saying is that inflammatory statements will be a point to argue on this forum, every time, without fail.

It really isn't hard to grasp the point here.  Your vesc failed.  You fell or whatever.  Your vesc failed for an undisclosed or provable reason.  There are so many variables at play with an isolated incident that is nigh on impossible to pinpoint what actually happened.  So to come out all guns blazing on a product is pretty much bullshit.  I for one have killed practically every vesc I have ever owned and most of it was my fault.  Its diy.  We build we learn we build again.

I did below, and in PMs with Ollin, and maybe one or two other threads I can't recall because it's been so long. The VESC absolutely failed, but again my post in this thread was anecdotal and wasn't making any claims on Ollins quality or lack thereof so I didn't bother substantiating anything.
