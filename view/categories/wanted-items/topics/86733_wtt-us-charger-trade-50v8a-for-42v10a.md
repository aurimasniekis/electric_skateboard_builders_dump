A while ago I bought a YZPower 50.4V 8A charger and it just came in, but in that time I've strongly considered changing from 12s4p to 10s5p since I'm using a 4.12 based ESC

If anyone has a 42V 10A charger I'll probably trade for it

This is the exact one I bought, looks the exact same IRL.  Its absolutely massive and weights a ton, it feels legit.  I'm gonna max out the rating on the cells, 2A a piece.  The plan is BesTech D140 which should support 15A and an I/O fuse setup so I'm not worried about cells going up while charging.
