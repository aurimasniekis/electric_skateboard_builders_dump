Maybe you can check with @Acido , @pjotr47 or electricboardsolutions.be . Good prices ,nice and helpfull people. Dunno how urgent it is but building a battery will take some time  (10 days or more) . Finding a used 12s7p will probably be mission impossible. I searched a lot for a 2nd hand  12s5p but at the end i bought a 12s6p battery from electricboardsolutions and i am glad i did so.
