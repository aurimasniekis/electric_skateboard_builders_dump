I'm looking for 6374 motors to use for an hub assembly test. The stator and magnets are what I'm mostly interested in so it doesn't really matter if the motor is damaged or broken (as long as it hasn't melted into ball of metal).

I have 3 bad 6374s 190kv. I'm in Lima Per√∫ though, that could make things complicated

I need the longer stator of the 6374, but thank you for the offers!

@Eboosted I figure the shipping cost to Germany is probably very high?

I have a damaged 6374 190 kv motor. Damaged in shipping never used. 1 magnet is broken and there's a dent in the can where that is. Stator is in good shape. Minor scratching from manual turning before i realised there was a broken magnet.

Thanks for all the offerings. I wrote you a PM.

I got a couple of stators from Hummie, so I think I'm set with motor for a while :D

I have a couple of hub motors that were on a Chinese board. They should still work. You can have them if you buy a shipping label I can print

@Jayallday The shipping from the US is quite expensive, therefore I'm not sure if its worth it.

@Dougieman1001 how much do you want for it?

I want the motors mainly for their stators. Taking apart a functional one for this is a bit of a waste.
