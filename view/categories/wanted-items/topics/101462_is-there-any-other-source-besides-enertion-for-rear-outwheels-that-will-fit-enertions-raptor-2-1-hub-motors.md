Just out of curiosity, does anyone know if there exists a second source for new Rubber Outwheels that fit the Rear Raptor 2.1 Hub Motor without modification??

Perhaps another major ESK8 Company or Skateboard Wheel supply company that has identical Dimension Hub Motors???

I'm wondering how other people are maintaining their Raptor's with regard to the Tires or "Outwheels"?

I replace my outwheels about every 200 miles. That is when the chunking starts getting bad.

You must be ripping around on that thing

Nope. The outwheels just flat out suck. I would only get about 100 miles before I couldn't use them anymore. Some even less.

Yikes, hopefully that gets improved eventually because even the chinese brands manage to make sleeves last longer, even though they're less powerful so its not apples to apples. 

For my money, i'd have Hummies instead

Haha. I highly doubt it. They've been trying to "improve" things for years.
