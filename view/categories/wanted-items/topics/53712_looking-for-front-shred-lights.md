I bought a couple tactical flash lights at Aliexpress.
They are very cheap and up for the task.

What do you need Alan? I can help you out. My [local shop](https://www.lastmilesf.com/) sell those Shred Lights like bread out of the oven.

Not listed in ther web page, but they definitely carry that item.

My friend Jay will help you with the shred lights at [Last Mile SF](https://www.lastmilesf.com/). Behind him the shelfs with the shred lights. They sell both boxes containing either two front lights or four front and rear lights.
