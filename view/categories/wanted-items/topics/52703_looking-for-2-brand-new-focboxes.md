What’s a fair price? I have two that have a one year warranty on them which started in January that are basically new. Never ran them on my board but I did solder on some 10 gauge wire and 5.5mm bullet connectors. Ran a motor detection successfully afterwards.

@Eboosted
The price is in AUD by default 
Also you can get a 10% off coupon from the Live Chat support of Enertion.
