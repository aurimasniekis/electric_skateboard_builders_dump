You need the bms as fast as possible? If no than just order some from bestech directly and sell the the left over for a good price and in the end it will even pay you off your. If you order just a small amount like 2-5 i can imagine you can request a sample declaration, which in fact it is and tax should be like nothing.

If you write them a mail ask for special sample declaration ðŸ˜‰ did work for me last time.
