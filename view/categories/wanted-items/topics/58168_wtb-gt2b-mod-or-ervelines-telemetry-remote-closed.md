$50 is too cheap. If you say like $30 in ADDITION to the Nano-X I would do it. GT2B and housing is already $60 and the time it takes to mod one makes it worth more. 

I have one on the shelf. It’s even got an LED battery indicator in it

Mine is new. My selling price is $100. I always push people who wants to buy to my video. It’s a simple mod and cost you less. I’m not looking to sell but willing to if there’s a need.

As mentioned I would do $30 plus Nano-x (which I don’t even like, but the slow/fast switch is useful) this will bring my “selling price” to $80
