I have the remote from the original board but need the receiver that works with VESCs and CAR ESCs. The original receiver doesn't work as it requires a TX connection from the original board ESC.

I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think the board remote will pair with the DIY style receiver. The remote is the one that requires a tx/rx connection.
