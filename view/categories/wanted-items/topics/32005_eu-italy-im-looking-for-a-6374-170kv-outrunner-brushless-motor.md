I found those:

https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-dustproof-6374-motor-12s-with_60561191541.html?spm=a2700.8443308.0.0.lrW72A

if we would buy at least 6 we would get them for 120 USD shipped to Europe + VAT if we have to pay.

Those are sealed motors, and the seller was very kind.

I wanted to start a GroupBuy, but I'm not high level enough :(
