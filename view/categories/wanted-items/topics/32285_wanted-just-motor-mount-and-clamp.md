where are you located?  If you want uber cheap (not sure it's reliable) - there's the HK mount...

Otherwise the best one i know of is @Korryh's mounts.  Inexpensive and really well made!

Might be worth knowing your budget.  If you are looking for a used mount and super cheap Korry's might not work.  If you are comparing to Enertion/ADS/DIYes - Korry's is already a steal.  And again if you are in the US fast shipping.  Location definitely helps

if you want help, i'd suggest volunteering as much information as possible instead of relying on others to try to figure out what you're doing.  you may get better responses that way.
