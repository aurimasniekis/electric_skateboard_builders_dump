Like the title states, I am looking to buy some Enertion motor mounts, also while I am at it, some motors to fit those mounts could be cool too. My main goal here is to find 2 Enertion motor mounts.

I think @longhairedboy might be selling those motors/mounts in a more appealing color. :) 

my info could be wrong.

in a more appealing color

And with more torque per speed from the skatan red... :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

i have two or three sets left and i'm trying to get more from Jollin. Emailing china is slow. 

The red anodize easily adds another 20% performance. 

Hail Skatan.

are you in the US? I've got one of the Enertion blue and Carbon fiber ones, never used. Seeing that Miami sells them for $65 I feel like this should be worth 50? No charge on shipping
