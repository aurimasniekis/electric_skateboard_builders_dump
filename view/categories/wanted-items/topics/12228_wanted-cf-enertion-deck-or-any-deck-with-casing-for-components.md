I can press a custom deck for you if you have a board for me to press it from. All of my decks are pressed from 20-25 layers of 100% Canadian maple grown in the northern part of Canada. I carve two hollow channels for electronics to imbedded. My current board fits a 12s4p plus a quad vesc without issue. Prices vary based on the length of the deck (which has a big effect on the cost of veneers), but prices are anywheres from $150-$200. Let me know if your interested.
