Hey there,
i just found [this thread](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=61608) on ES. Tumich is selling 18650er for 3,79 each. That sounds amazing!

Do anyone have some experience with **Tumich** or these **Sanyo NCR 18650GA** cells?

I have 10s6p pack out of this cells from him (..huge range^^). Only thing i think you should do is going 5P or 6P cause they are only 10A discharge cells.

i have build 4x 10S6P batteries for evolve carbon replacements from tumichs GAs! he is a great reliable guy and the cell is the best high capacity cell on the market imo! but like nordle said: 10A/cell! works for very large skateboard battery projects :slight_smile:

What do you mean? he just sells 80 batteries. It seems as a good deal but i am located in germany... the shipping from austria will be a problem.

Thanks for the hint. I totally overread it. Well there is no information about the discharge on the ES thread so i could not read it ^^

I think at 10S you wont need 60A. I think we need less than 40A because the voltage get converted to ampere?

```
I easily hit 60A for a few seconds when I accelerate hard ... with a single 6374! probably much worse for dual setups that youd have to limit to 20A each then!

for a 40cell battery, the GA wont work imo, it will constantly be on the edge, heat up and cycle lifetime will decrease. for 40cell layouts, go with hg2! the cell has become a lot cheaper too, can ger it for 5€/cell @ nkon nowadays! 3-4months ago it still was 7€!!

I think it would be better to use a 10S6P from the Sanyo than 10S4P from the HG2 because it would be

1. cheaper

1. better range

1. downside: heavier

wellwell, larger batteries are nearly always better, but: for how long do you think you can skate? I hit 35-40km on average with my 10S4P and usually I got enough of skating by then! :smile:

also, for continuous current, the hg2 would still be better!

the GA is perfect for the evolve. low power application cruiser board for relaxed touring! thats why I chose the GA for the carbon replacement. for other boards that might not fit - depends on what you want to do!

Thats true but i am still thinking:

Longer range for better price? Why not? I dont need to skate it until it is depleted...

Do you have any other argument why i should stick to HG2?

yea, with 18650 = 18mm diameter, 65mm height, youll end up at:

2x 6.5cm = 13cm width
30x 1.8cm = 54cm length

if you pack them flat like me ... I just dont like bulky enclosures. you can of course fit such a large battery if you pack triagonal or so ...

I could have calculated that by myself but it will be slightly bigger (wires, etc.).
Thats why i am asking you about the exact measurements.

I'll just add 5 cm to the length and width and it will be ok. Thanks for the quick reply.

[/quote]

cool, lets do physics!! :smile_cat:

energy stored in a capacitor: 0.5*C*U^2. I build a capacitor bank of 6x 2200uF = 13200uF caps, that was already fairly large, this stored the energy of 11.6Joule @ 42V, so best case with max charged battery.

now, to accelerate a mass of uhm, lets say 90kg (you with clothes + board) from 0 to lets say 10m/s (36kph), it takes the energy of 0.5*mass*velocity^2 = 4500Joule, so about a factor of 50 short!

lets see what we CAN do with 11.6Joule:
11.6 = 0.5 * 90kg * velocity^2

<=> velocity = 0.5m/s = 1.8kph

so yea, not super convincing and like I said, 6x2200uF caps is already pretty large:

generally yes, but what kills the battery is heat, not really the current. basically the internal battery resistance & current generates heat R*I^2! high drain low capacity cells have, you guessed it, a very small internal resistance, so they generate less heat and can therefore endure larger currents.

Hi there! Could you throw in some data on how much amps does eboard really consume?

I would be interested in amp draw for 15kph (9mph), 20kph (12mph), 25kph speed (15mph). 

Also, a distinction between e-mountainboard and e-longboard in terms of amp draw, would be great because of the wheel / gear ratio difference.

By the way, here is a comprehensive discharge chart for these sanyo cells:

http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Common18650comparator.php

**You have to choose sanyo NCR 18650 GA (red), then you can also compare it to other cells.
/Couldnt post direct link anymore, unfortunately.

-----
Concerning amp draw, folks on ES forum, were building 20ah or 30ah out of laptop cells, with suggested max amp draw of 20-30A continous. Although, they have different motors and different wind / rolling resistance, so the numbers could vary..

this one is fairly old (2014), but currently the only thing we got:

http://img4.hostingpics.net/pics/668723esboardevaloct14.jpg

someone should start a thread about this and collect data properly. with enough and properly verified data, one could maybe have a hit on quite a few interesting topics: single vs. double motor, 63 vs 50mm, foc vs bldc, vesc vs. other escs, impact of KV values, impact of wheel choices and and and!

I do agree about creating a new thread about this. 

I know this opinion is vastly unpopular, but I think the amp requirement for e-boards are ''overengineered''. And for everyday use you don't need these 30A continous.

-------------------

From the chart alone, it tells that it takes around 100w of energy to go 20kph.

That would equal to **~4.5A for 24v (6s),  ~2.7A for 36v (10s) and ~2.4A for 44v (12s) system**. 
--

As about the consumtion climbing hills, I think someone mentioned it could take around 20-30A. But, as the place I'm living basically has no hills, I would count something like 15A for 6s/22.2v (333w), 9A for 10s and 8A for 12s. That should suffice to climb some streets with a slope and also for acceleration. 

-----

So I think it comes to the fact, that the end user / battery pack builder should really consider what his power requirements and use would be like.

well, first of all, dont follow that quadratic air drag line - you can see that most boards level out at 200watt+. you have the belt that costs energy, the deformation of wheels - obviously none of these builds were really getting below 200Watt.

I have done a quite constant speed 23kph average run with a vesc foc driven single motor and it took me 9Wh/km. using the 23kph average, Im getting a 207Watt average power consumption as well (thats 1.5A per cell)  - riding conservative and without changing my velocity all that much.

a 27kph average run gave me 13Wh/km, thats 300watt already (thats 2A/cell)!

but now comes the important point: thats on average!

I know for certain that I can easily hit 60A battery current with just a single motor build - for my 10S battery thats more than 2000Watt of power, that has to be kept up for a few seconds at least (for my battery thats 15A per cell - LG HG2 rated 20A continuous). I recently pushed my vanguard really hard - basically full throttle <-> full braking and my battery, thats already over-engineered for 80A continuous current, was slightly more warm than my hand (through enclosure and felt sheet)!!

nothing is more deadly for a lipo and liion battery than getting warm, so here goes your overengineering. peak loads can simply be much much higher than these averages!

as a test, why dont you limit your vesc battery current to 20A and see how much fun youll have with that! :smiley:

Ok, You got a good point there, I agree. The temperature of battery should not be very high. 

Although, I think it once again comes to the point of what kind of board and for what use it is going to be. If you want a racer board, then, yeah, those 60A, will perhaps weakly sustain your energy needs.

But if you are on a ''budget'' and don't plan to go speed racing with over 25kph (~15mph) and just cruise at 15-20kph (~10mph), then you can live off with lower draw battery setup.

 I would like to quote the ride time / distance thread, where people usually have 40+ minutes of ride time, if they were going at 800w all the time and their batteries are in 100-200wh range, then they would not be able to do so.

Attention should be placed on that table in the bottom left corner.

(taken from: http://www.nature.com/articles/srep12967/figures/5)

25ºC = 77ºF, 55ºC = 131ºF

For that specific battery (which is LiCo chemistry), when comparing 25º C and 55º C operating temp, only 2.45% capacity decrease difference over 100 cycles.

At 200 cycles the difference becomes more wider - 7.19% (3.29% vs 10.48%) capacity loss for running at 25º or 55º C. 

-------------
So, let's look at the real loss when subtracted from total capacity of the battery.

As for 1500mah battery, at 100 cycles that would be: 
1474,2 mah total (25º) and 1438,95 mah total (55º)
at 200cyles: 1450,65 mah (25º) and 1342,8 (55º) 

Now  a 5000mah pack would be 3.33 times larger
10ah = 6.66 larger. 

If the same percentage applies, then at for 5000mah and 100cycles = 4914 mah (25º) and  4765,5 mah (55º)
at 200cyles = 4835mah/164,5mah loss (25º), 4476mah/524 mah loss (55º)

**For 10ah**

_100 cyles_ =  
**at 25º C** -> 9828 mah / 172 mah loss 
**at 55º C**  -> 9531 mah / 469 mah loss  

so - 2.72 times more
 
200cycles = 
**25º C** - 9671 mah / 329 mah loss (25c),  
**55º C**  - 8952 mah / 1048 mah loss (55c) 

3.19 times more

-----------

Enough calculations for one day. I think the test was done by keeping the battery at that temperature all the time! I do wonder how big difference there is for LiMn batteries (the high discharge ones) compared to the one in test (LiCo). 

So, in general, little ''bursts'' of heat shouldn't damage cell that much, if the heat does not reach 70-80 degrees celsius, I think. Especially considering that LiCo bears high drain current worse than LiMn.

So yes, I think it is a tricky matter to precisely estimate / calculate capacity loss over time, since if we take two different batteries, their real capacity may vary depending on load / amp draw. That's of course why the majority stay on the safe side, not to degreade / heat their batteries excessively. 

If I find something more related to this, for example, why exactly tesla has battery cooling, then I might post more info. 

-------------
Im still confident that the real amp draw should be found. 

Once we have that, we can more accurately estimate what batteries we might need, how hot / warm they may run and what capacity loss we may witness. We have 10A / 15 A / 20A / 25A draw configurations available. Plus there is capacity and price..

We will need a battery calculator at some point in time.

Different max discharge rates X batteries in parallel X running temp X Capacity.

----------
If we add battery cooling, then we would be able to ''step into'' using batteries which get warmer or does not have as high discharge rate. 

Not saying that running batteries hot all the time is a wise idea, it may pose a risk that some batteries get weaker (balance problems) but I would aim, that in the future we better understand how all of the system operates and can design it a way we need without choosing a ''safe'' estimate. 

This should become wildly important for someone who is going to build larger or more than one pack.

One comment about something that is important for some users: wind resistance. I live in the SF Bay Area, where in summer we almost always have 15-20kts winds in the afternoon by the bay. So even though it is flat, riding upwind is very taxing on the ESC. Even at low speeds (in which case the RPM is lower and therefore the motor is less efficient even...). I built my system initially for 6S but I'm already considering going to 10S so I can draw fewer amps. When I ride against this type of wind I have to push so much more to keep the same speed. 

One question: I am waiting for a cable (damn unusual VESC connectors) to connect a bluetooth module to the VESC. How are you guys logging the data from the VESC? I'd love to collect these data riding full speed against the wind / no wind / with the wind. Doesn't have to be real-time. I have an openlog board.

@Okami you didnt read everything of that article - the authors Qm is an artificially calculated capacity of the battery - the problem is that youll have to get to your electrons somehow and the increased inner resistance of the battery will lead to additional heating and a reduced discharge capacity. the authors of the paper discuss that before the conclusions.

its dangerous to just cut pictures completely out of context! its more reasonable to look for papers, that do the things that we do: just use a battery and count the Wh you got out of the battery. for example this: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.606.4672&rep=rep1&type=pdf

which kind of draws a different picture:
at 500 cycles, the drop in capacity as function of temp has been:
room temp: 22.5% drop
45°C: 26.5% drop
50°C: 43.2% drop
55°C: 70.5% drop

after pushing my board I surely have been at 45°C battery temp and its over-engineered already with 80A continuous current!

also interesting the batteryuniversity read in that respect, especially the tables, most impressively the storage table! http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries

Ok, I do agree that the paper I found was not that reliable concerning our situation, especially with the little 1500mah battery which was not 18650 and also the few cycles (250) compared, that some users may push the battery way further. Will have to sit down and read all of that paper + yours completely. It does point out some very important factors etc related to batteries.

And yes, I somehow tottally forgot about the wind! In that matter there is a need for higher amp setup.

Well apparently your beloved HG2 perform almost identical

so no reason to switch - especially with the price difference

hELLO , I new to this thread
I just bought 84 this type of battery
But I hesitate about the originallity
I buy this battery at local store..

1.When I buy from titan battery.com,, the battery have "C" mark,, but when I buy at Local store The Mark is "B",, 

2.I Set with NIMH operation at the charger,, discharge set to 2amp
When The Charger begin, it show discharge at 1.4 amp,, the voltage drop from 4.2 to 3.88 Volt ,, this is normal? this is good resistance?
I have no graphic,, I try with note,, 
>when the voltage at 3.4 Volt,, the "Mah" that I got is about 1100 Mah..
>when the voltage at 3.0 Volt,, the "Mah" that I got is about 2300 Mah..
>when the voltage at 2.8 Volt,, the "Mah" that I got is about 3205 Mah..
everything is normal?

I did not try The "C" Mark Yet


Discharge with SKYRC balance charger,, 2 amp discharge,, until 2.8 Volt,, I got about 3205 mah

thank YOU,, I upload the Picture

It apear to be ok, for a better measurement take a resistor of about 10 ohms and measure the loaded and unloaded

With your numbers the internal resistance 228 mOhms, but the charger is taking into account the wires resistance

measure the 2nd cell too!

http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Sanyo%20NCR18650GA%203500mAh%20%28Red%29%20UK.html

Compared to this, looks correct!

2amps - 3208mah

How big battery are you planning to build? It looks like, you could make about 2 batteries of decent size with so many cells.. unless it is for ebike

84 / 2 = 42cells per pack.. 6s6p (36cells) / 8s5p (40cells)
OR go all the way and build 12s 7p...

@arij u might want to read this too:

Maximum recommended constant current = ~7A per cell.
