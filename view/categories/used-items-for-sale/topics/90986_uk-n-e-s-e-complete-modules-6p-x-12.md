Hi everyone,

I've got some brand new N.E.S.E modules for sale (6p). I was going to use them for my 12s6p build but I didn't have space. Decided to weld my batteries instead.

**They're brand new**. Never used/hooked up. I doubt I'll be using them so I may aswell sell them!

Product description can be found here. Remember it's a 6P option!
https://18650.lt/index.php/product/n-e-s-e-module/

From the site they're €131.40 (£113.64). Looking for £90 + postage. Can be shipped immediately.

Thanks,
Daniel

Cheers bro. I took them out of the box, placed them on my board and said "£&#@, no space.." then put them back in the box :smile:

Oh, I did put the gold plus/minus on them aswell because I couldn't tell which way the cells would need to go!

Other than that, brand spanking new!
