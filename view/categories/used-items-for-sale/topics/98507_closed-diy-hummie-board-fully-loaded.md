Decided to part out some of the board instead and form a base for a new build.

```
The remote is scratched up on the edges from my fall but the general lines are from being 3d printed.
The motors arrived in that condition from the original owner (I assume it's from general wear and tear). It has no issues from riding it.
The deck does not have any scratches I am aware of, just some dirt which can be cleaned off
