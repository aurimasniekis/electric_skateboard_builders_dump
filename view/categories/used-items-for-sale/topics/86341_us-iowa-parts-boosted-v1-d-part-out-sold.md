Everything but the Vanguard is going. Open to money or trades. Looking at enclosures, 10S2P 30Q pack, or other general parts.
Battery is shot. Took it apart after the treadmill treatment didn't work and the pack is at 7.8v. I was momentarily able to connect it to the app and the odometer says 128.4 miles. But since the board wasn't able to legitimately turn on I can't say if the ESC is functional or not. If your ESC or motors don't work here's a chance to try your luck.
Any other questions or pic requests ask away.

Go cyclones! I was the guy riding around campus on the prototype banshee. I heard about your board fire. Sad to hear that it went the way it did.

Not a damn clue. If I were to guess it'd be low voltage.
