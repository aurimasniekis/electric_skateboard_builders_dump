So I've had the 90mm wheels for about 2 months and have used them daily, when they first arrived they were very stiff and slippery, but they've definitely worn in and are much grippier and comfortable to ride than they were when new. I'm selling them because I'm making a 22 inch board and need to get closer to the ground with 83mms, maybe even 78mm wheels. I'm used to riding 71mms with my push board, and want to keep the wheels as small as practically possible.

I'm selling the on/off switch because I decided to splurge on the chaka vesc with the antispark plug on the battery side. It hasn't been used at all.

Shipping out of Los Angeles, CA, or local pick-up around Santa Monica/Venice area if you want to pick up. 

Going to the best reasonable offer!
