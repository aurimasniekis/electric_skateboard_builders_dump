Genuine Kaly.nyc 4:1 Direct Gear Drive, purchased here from another forum rockstar for $777, works beautifully (only bench-tested in California; authentic NYC road dust included at no cost (as pictured).  I'd say the condition is 9/10.

Includes:
1 Trampa Vertigo Truck
1 Kaly 4:1 Direct Gear Drive with custom CNC Kaly hanger
2 Badass Motors (Turnigy SK8 6374 192kv)
4 Trampa Superstar Wheels (Carbon Fiber print rims)
4 Evolve Tires
4 Evolve inner tubes 


**$675** firm, PayPal & insured shipping available at buyer's expense.  Thank you.

Isn't he tho?
I don't think the board/battery/Vesc-bindings comes with it.
Price is just too low. (And no other parts are mentioned) 
Just Geardrive, wheels, trucks makes sense at that price

Thanks friends. 

Iâ€™d remove the can of spinach motors and knock off $150 for the buyer of this Kaly:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/us-sale-kaly-street-carver-1399-brand-new-motors-focboxes/76961

I personally vouch for both @FranciscoV and that year model of Kaly (perfect batteries).  

As Cisco is local Iâ€™m sure assembly and test could be arranged for, as well. :sunny:

there y'all go.

The combined listings are:

- 2017 Kaly Trampa City Carver with new FOCBOXes, new Street Wing motors, 12S4P and
- 2018 Kaly Gear Drive with the wide-stance Trampa trucks, which includes both ABEC 107s and genuine Trampa Superstars 

**= a Kaly 2-in-1 _with_ _a 2018 Kaly Gear Drive_ for only $1925** - maybe Cisco keeps the old trucks and mounts in exchange for assembly services.  

Maybe you sell the old trucks and mounts here and assemble yourself since we're on a builder's forum. ;)

we'll never see a Kaly 2-in-1 complete Trampa City Carver .with. a Kaly Gear drive for that price, again

buy genuine Trampa Primo Alpha tires in the color of your choice and you own the street, park, driveway, your Nanna's garden, etc.

Or get the motors too for $150, and a couple more FOCBOX's or Unity for $300, and have a 4wd gear/belt drive hybrid Kaly unicorn for around $2,400. :exploding_head:
