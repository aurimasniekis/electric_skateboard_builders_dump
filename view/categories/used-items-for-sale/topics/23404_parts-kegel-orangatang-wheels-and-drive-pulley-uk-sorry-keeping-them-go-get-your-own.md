Set of four used Kegels (which I'm now keeping cos they're lovely) with aluminium drive pulley. Comes with home made retaining ring which may not last for ever.. Could do with a printed replacement or a new one fabricated.
They have not done many miles, 3 wheels almost still as shiny as they were when I bought them. Just the drive wheel has started to wear in.
No money could buy these with standard untracked postage in the uk. All other postage options are available at cost.
