It’s a hardly used bamboo 1, has the lcd r1 remote and regular r1 remote. Comes with its charger and an extra set of wheels. Has 97mm abec 11 flywheels. I usually cruise around on it at 18mph, and get an easy 10 miles per charge using fast mode. Want 500 for it but open to reasonable offers. You pay shipping but prefer someone in SD pick it up. I got this board from a friend of my dad who works at evolve, he was the last owner, but only used it for about 2 weeks, then decided to part with it because he upgraded to the carbon gt. This board is technically new. I have cleaned it every time I’ve rode it. It has less then 50 battery cycles. From what I was told, he replaced the motor, and that’s the only mod other then the wheels I added on them
