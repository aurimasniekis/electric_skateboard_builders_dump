Yeah, looks like 50a is more what you get out as continues. Same values for the Flipsky case.

Completely off topic, but are there any Esk8 related shops in Hong Kong? I'll be there 19th-24th and would be interested in checking them out.

I was there in July and it is difficult to even find longboard shops. If nothing changed since I last checked electric skateboard are not allowed on the streets there. 
Best bet to buy anything diy esk8 is taobao, however I don’t know how if you can have them ship a hotel but I think some courrier services deliver to collection points like convenience stores. 
There are many hobby RC shops in Mongkok close to the night market and for electronics and tools you could probably head to Sham Shui Po, the shops are right outside of the train station’s exit.

@YUTW123 do we meanwhile have some real life values which show how much current this vesc could handle? Still a bit confused, the label says 240a, the description on the website says 150a peak and 50a const.

Also could you give a short explanation what’s the main difference between the hw 4.12 and  hw 4.4. if i‘m not wrong the vesc you sell is hw 4.4, right?

I am sorry for the confusion of this logo. The original version of Benjamin's official 4.12 hardware is installed inside the shell. The continuous current is 50a (may be higher because there is a heat sink). Maximum 240a
