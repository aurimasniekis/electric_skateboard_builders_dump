Hey everyone, I am looking to possibly sell this in the SF Bay Area to fund a backpacking trip that I am taking through Europe this summer. It would be sold with every part on it seen in this build thread except the trailer hitch, so the buyer knows exactly what they’re getting. I’ve been busy with school and other things, so the board only has about 175 miles on it in total, the Trampa Gummies less than 25. 1 of the motors has an issue with the C clip, but I have a replacement that will come with the board and it’s a 5 minute fix. 

Edit: I can also put a mini-remote in instead of the Hoyt Puck if you’re not too keen on having a remote with my username engraved in it

Yup. Cross-country trip got forked when I realized that my two closest friends have never been out of California, whereas I've had the luck of visiting several other continents. We're now going on a 2 month, 16 country backpacking trip through Europe and I need the funds for food :laughing:. Still got the trailer and the trailer hitch though, so I can do it in college if I want. Also, this way I don't have to deal with being a minor when State Troopers inevitably pull me over mid-ride.

I’m willing to part out now, need some of these things gone:

**All items are used. I will only do transactions over PayPal business for both your safety and mine**

Motor mounts from @Idea:
**125 usd + shipping from the US, with 4 tensioners (single bearing).**
- They have a few scratches (very minor) and were filed down in the motorshaft area to allow room for protruding C clips

Atom 90 Deck + Trucks + Riptide bushings, + hubs w/ 3D printed gears:
**90 usd + shipping from the US**
- true, it doesn’t have the original tires but you don’t want those bc they were shit anyways

BKB motor (needs new C clip)
**90usd + shipping**
- Has 1 or two scratches, works just fine. Just needs a new C clip or the existing one bent a little tighter

10s12p battery + MTB case (sticker bombed) + voltage meter + waterproof charger & charge port + buck converter w/ 2 USB ports (iPhone compatible). 
**350 USD**
- SF Bay Area pickup only because I think shipping this would cost a stupid amount of money and be major hassle

It's using LGEAMF11865 batteries, and that's why it's cheap. This 10S12P would have 26.4ah compared to something like a 10s12p 30Q battery which would have 36ah. These are the same kind of batteries that @squishy654 (get better soon my man!) used in his 100 mile range build

Oh yeah, I had a 10s2p battery I got off of a starkboard and it used those batteries. They have somewhat of a voltage sag but still, this is a hell of a deal, if I’m able to come up with the money after I buy some more stuff to replace in my room, I’ll take it, no promises though

No idea tbh. The longest I rode was on two of those SF group rides and both times I didn’t have to pay attention to the battery because it’s so massive that it barely sips the surface of its capacity. I never got the chance to run it all the way down.

Pleasanton. It was built out of 10s2p blocks in parallel, so it has 6 BMSs.

Sorry for interrupting this sale, but 6 BMS’s must mean way faster balance time than if it was just one BMS, right? I’m guessing the balance time is the same as for one 10s2p?

Yes, but it’s not for sale.

![image|427x500](upload://fIgZoAGnbOhBadp4vY8pRR3M1Fb.jpeg) 

This is a picture from when I built it, all of the 10s2p blocks are connected with a 6p adapter. The hot glue that you see is purely to get rid of sharp edges, everything is soldered well and heat-shrinked like normal.

Didn’t we have this conversation over Pm? I remember doing research and it was still quite expensive. 

The thing is, I need the battery gone now because that amount of lithium sitting in my garage for a few months is something I’m not comfortable with. The mounts/deck/trucks can sit there over the summer no problem. I’m in no rush with those, so I’ll just go with whatever is most convenient. If you’re willing to pay for shipping + the price that I listed earlier then I’ll happily send those items your way.
