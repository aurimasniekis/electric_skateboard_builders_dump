Moinmoin,

I gonna sell two Maytec 90mm Drivetrains.
They have been used for maximum 200km. 
They work perfect and come with the Truck.

The hubs have 22A with 800W each.

 (170‚Ç¨ for one Truck and two 90mm Hubs +shipping) 

They have been used in a 10s4p Setup with two 50A Maytech Vesc‚Äòs in Bldc Mode only.



One of the hubs has a custom hubcap because I tried to cool the Motors on a single Hub Setup. 

I drilled holes in the hubcap and closed the holes again :slight_smile:

Hi,

I have no focbox to tell you the performance with this hubs.
With the Maytech Vesc‚Äôs it was better to
run Bldc Mode.
I tried it for 10minutes in foc with the maytech Vesc‚Äôs and it worked very well.
So I think It will work with the focbox aswell ü§î

Ah yes, of course they ran in FOC mode - they marketed it themselves with their dual ESC

I'm definitely gonna go purchase these from you, but could you wait for 10 days max? Until a new paycheck clears 
My phone got waterdamanged yesterday which I took, dried and cleaned up today, but it glitches and dies on me.. I'll see what the repairman can diagnose tomorrow tho having to fork out for a new same one is not a far gone conlusion...

E: Hey man no worries I can make payment now:)

I would advise you to halve down your prices and add shipping. Else you might not sell them anytime soon :sweat_smile:
