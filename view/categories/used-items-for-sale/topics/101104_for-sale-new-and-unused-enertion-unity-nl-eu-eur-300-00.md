Hi guys, I ordered an Enertion Unity in April and since I had to wait for so long I made other ESC arrangements for my Trampa Carver build. The ESC arrived last week so I'm willing to sell for a fair prize at EUR 300,00 - basically enabling someone to cut the line for a small extra charge. I live in Amsterdam The Netherlands and I'm able to ship fast. `
