I will be traveling through Europe in July, if someone occupies something of this could tell me to put it in the suitcase, there are still the trucks, the vesc (the good and the damaged), the motor mounts, the wheels.
I'll be in 10 countries so if something interests you, ask and see if I'm passing through your city, I'll be in Paris on the 11th in case someone else will go.
I can sell the parts separately
