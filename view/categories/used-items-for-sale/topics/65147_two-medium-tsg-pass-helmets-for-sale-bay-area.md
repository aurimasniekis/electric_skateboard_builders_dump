Hello

I have a total of 3 TSG Helmets, but am selling off 2 of them today to help with a purchase. I have a Red and White One for sale, which I purchased new for $250 each, it was more after tax.

They are both size medium. The Red I did take a fall in, it was my first fall ever after riding for two years, so there is some cosmetic damage on it, but nothing too bad and it's on one side. Easily covered with a few stickers. The white one however is in perfect condition. Both include original boxes, new unused visors they came with, and manuals.

I am located in the bay area, between Sac and SF, local sales only please.

Selling the Red one for $150, and the White for $200. Much appreciated if both were taken off my hands for $320

Any questions or comments, send em my way. Thank you

1. How old is each helmet?
2. You might have a hard time selling the damaged one due to the fact you can't see the damage/ foam compressed under the Shell.  I understand you said it's superficial.  However if someone bought it to wear instead of no helmet...

I bought em at the same time, around 3-4 months, I have 3, so I would wear a different one everytime
