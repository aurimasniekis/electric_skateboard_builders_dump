Did a number on my shoulder a few weeks back and unfortunately I need to let this go.  My loss is your gain.  Have about 10 charges on the board.  Let me know if you have any questions.

@thisguyhere,  @PredatorBoards Not giving up in any sense, just need to take it easy for a while.  I have two other boards that are more casual that I will cruise around with.  Its not fun hitting the street at 27mph when a little kid runs out in front of you.  This took a toll on my wife and kids.

@scepterr, Thanks Max, I'll come and see you with another batter soon enough.

Thanks man, freak accident, could have been way worse if I wasn't paying attention.  Got about 2 maybe 3 steps before I had to tuck and roll.  I have full mobility back, docs said if I was an athlete, this is a career ender.  Good thing I'm retired from shoulder modeling because my career would be over!

Glad to hear you are recovering well.
I hurt my shoulder about 4 weeks ago riding on the boardwalk and had a head on collision with a bicyclist.
Luckily I only had inflammation. Doctor gave me a cortisone shot and a perscription for 800mg ibuprofen.
I'm already back to surfing now though my shoulder is still a little stiff at times.

Glad to see everything will turn out okay. On a serious note, I always treat kids as wild cards. One recently had the audacity to kick a soccer ball in front of me while I was riding... even when it was pretty clear I was nearing by. Point being, you always have to look out for the small things.

Wow someone please take this, my willpower is only so strong. Ronins! heasunk chakas! LBL deck!!!

Here's a price breakdown to help it along. Rough estimates, and not accounting for misc parts like connectors, wire, shrink, voltmeter, risers, screws.

lbl 160 (LBL amazing stuff)
ronin x2 90 (ronins!)
mounts x2 120 (unobtainable?)
mastercho 100
motors x2 200
vescs x2 500 (heatsunk chakas!)
bms 30
flys 120 (almost unobtainable)
batpack 250 (low capacity but seriously high discharge)
bt 10
remote 30
motor pulley x2 30
wheel pulley x2 50
(switch) 50

$1740

And the thing looks like it's never been ridden.

@Chris1 get well soon! Some questions, er, for a friend lol.

- Is the Caiman the stiff flex?
- The aps mount, the whitepony design?
- does it include switch?
- is bms bypassed for discharge?
- belts included, ready to ride?
- charger port type?

Thanks Deuce, there is a lot of good will on this board so I'm just paying it forward.  It's just going to be sitting around all winter while I heal and do PT, so I would rather it get some use.

Caiman only comes stiff flex, to my knowledge
Mounts are done White Pony style
Switch is a TB switch
BMS is bypassed for charging only.  Couldn't fit a full sized
All belts, ready to ride
Chargjng port is a standard 5.5x2.1

This was from the day I crashed.  I have never ran the batteries dry, so I couldn't tell you an official range, but I would say about 13 miles.
