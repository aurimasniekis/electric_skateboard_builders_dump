Hey,

Considering selling my DIY Board as Iâ€™m not riding it much now that I have moved to a less suburban area. Trying to gauge interest and how much I could get.

Could sell as all seperate items or as a complete build, depending on interest and if I think I could sell it all. It is pretty much a DIY of the Raptor 1 before the Raptor 1 was released but with 97mm ABEC flywheels! 

- Original Enertion Carbon Fibre Deck
- Single Enertion Motor 190kv
- VESC 4.12 (Enertion)
- Original Enertion Spacecell battery system.
- Enertion Trucks
- Enertion Single Motor Mount
- Nano X controller
- ABEC 11 97mm Flywheels 78A!

Probably only done 10 small rides on it.
Australia delivery only, as postage will be too hectic otherwise. 

PM me if keen. 
If someone is just interested in letting me know a fair price that will be awesome too. 

Cheers,
Pat.

@Mikenopolis I'm in Australia, like the seller. 
To get a battery made in the US and shipped can be eye wateringly expensive.
Local is always easier!
