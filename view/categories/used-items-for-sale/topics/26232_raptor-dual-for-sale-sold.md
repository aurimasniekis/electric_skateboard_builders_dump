Selling my Raptor Dual. Purchased it last year. I live in the bay area. Will come with extra belts and an extra charger. I put maybe 35 or 40 miles on it. I posted it on Ebay. All interested parties can check it out on there.

Damn! If this would have been 2 weeks ago, I would have totally bought this from you. I just recently paid $900 w/ shipping for one in much more beat up condition. Yours is practically mint condition, other than some scrapes on the motor mounts. Oh well, it's a great deal for the buyer

No dude sorry. Can only do ground shipping. International shipping with the battery is too much of a headache to deal with.

What a lucky SOB. Wish I had the chance for this one, but mine is still kicking strong. I also ended up selling my Blink S2 preorder. Acton is truly a joke of a company and so is their pansy CTO. Lie after lie and people still put up with them. Just for an under-performing over weight board with generic off the shelf parts. You will totally love the Raptor. Damn thing is a beast and scary as F***!
