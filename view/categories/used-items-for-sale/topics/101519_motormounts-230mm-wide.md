This is for a SYL-08 Drivetrain, the v3 Covered version which is actually not used by the factories that produce these anymore as they make a simpler design. The trucks themselves are actually okay though, strong 12 (I think, maybe 10) mm axles 

Here's the V3

Here's the better V2 (The mounts actually clamp on, and have adjustment)

The V1 is kind of shitty, its literally a bent* bit of aluminum with holes drilled into it. Works, but it can eventually bend. 

They use countersunk screws because they all make use of standardized phillips machine screws, which are super weak and annoying to deal with.
