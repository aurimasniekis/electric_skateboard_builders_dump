Hey folks,
Ive been building electric bikes for past 8years.. So I have some experience with building small battery packs..which can be wired in series for higher voltages... below is a pic of a 5S4P pack I just built..
Custom sizes can be made..

This is very inexpensive to build.. no soldering.. no welding.. 

I am going to buy brand new 18650 cells (NCR18650GA 3500mah) from a trusted Hong Kong supplier
I have purchased 18650 cells from this company previously and 100% confident they are genuine cells.

I am located in Canada and ship to Canada ONLY.
Shipping can be choosen and calculated at a later time for each person individually.
I planned to buy the cells early in the new year 2017.
if you are interessted write me a pm!!! 
Then i will update this post with the summary.

Hello

Actually..I..switched.to..using..Tesla..cells..from..a..2016..Tesla..
cells..are...3400mah..very..close..to..the..GA..cell..qualities..
However...the..GA:
300 cycles to 70%

the..Tesla..cells..are..showing..very..good..cycle..life..
still.mid-95%.capacity..after...100,000km's..
(https://evannex.com/blogs/news/understanding-teslas-lithium-ion-batteries)

So.....If..you..have..interest...
I..will..purchase..more..cells..soon...ship..to..Canada..(Vancouver..area)

My..first..order..was..in..May..this..year..for..30..cells..approx..$220..CAD..delivered..UPS..

If..we..purchase..100..cells..the...price..drops..approx..$.65..per..cell..
so..for..example.
100..cells..shipped...to..me..&..I..re-package..50..cells..ship..them..to..you..

$5.68..per..cell
+..shipping..from..Vancouver..to..you..

let...me..know..what..you..think
