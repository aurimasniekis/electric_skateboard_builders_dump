Ceramic bearings don't do so well on esk8's. Prolonged use at high speeds can cause fractures, so they typically don't last long. I'd pull them and keep them, sell the wheels cheaper without them.

There extremely smooth and are the best out there, plus they won't rust as much because they have "hard ceremic balls" just like mine :wink:

Apply heat to ceramic balls and then apply same heat to metal balls. Apply pressure. Tell me which one explodes first. I'll wait lol

Welp you see that's called brittleness 

And also the regular balls would also deform so much it won't be useable

Fair enough lol. My wrong choice of word then lol. 

Ive had ceramics and I personally liked them, but the maintenance on them was far more than metal bearings.

There's no real point in ceramic bearings for Esk8.
Yes they will roll longer and have less resistance, but you'll never really notice considering the resistance our Motors already cause.
They're great for push boards or for downhill.
But they suffer far more catastrophic failures than all metal bearings.
When a metal bearing goes you know it's coming.
When is ceramic bearing goes.......
