these motors and the board have been used but they are still in great shape(besides the holes for the wood screws i used to attach my case). each hub motor can handle up to 3,000 watts but i suggest using 9s and limiting your vescs because its a lot of power and im not sure if the urethane can handle 12s at full tick lol. I'm asking $300 for everything shown plus shipping

Which hubs are this ? JBloy's hubs ? Hummie's hubs ? Have a good sale ! If I wasn't already in for my own builds (need reserve in case) I'd take it right now from you.

honestly i dont know what kind of hubs they are... i got them from a friend and he gave me the specs. i ran them on 9s for about 2 weeks but i have tested them with 12s and they did not have any problems :)

@Vanarian Those look like Jacob's hubs given the placements of the screws on the side.  I have hummie's hubs, and these definitely aren't those.
