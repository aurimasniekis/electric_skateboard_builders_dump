Have a R2 deck I used for a couple of rides before doing a deck swap and instead of collecting dust in my garage I figured someone could get better use out of it than I will....

Not really sure on price.... is $200 sound fair given the price of the whole set up?

Get at me and we can figure something out. Pics below. Can't have more than 10-20 miles on it.

Yea....you aren't going to get $200 for this

A Red Ember deck is cheaper than that and I would take that any day.

is it really? I always figured treenutters boards were priced higher due to their nature

Thats good to hear though, I was worried about speaking to him about price :P

There is a range, but you can get one for under $200!

Hit him up, buy one, ride that damn piece of art.

There are alot of people buying from him. @treenutter is just a one man operation.

But anyways, let's not derail this post.

@Jansen good luck with your sale, but you will need to adjust the price, or post it on reddit!

Like my post said fellas... I had no idea what to price it at and just threw that out there and that I'm open to work something fair out.. Appreciate the honest input @Itsmedant @Sn4pz @venom121212   and there's no need to get your panties all twisted about it cause I'm wide awake @brenternet which is why my post said what it did ya turd. Always so sarcastic you are :kissing_heart: 

@joeadams101 if I have no better offers by the end of business tomorrow it's yours for a crisp Benjamin (an electronic one of course) Where are you located? 

On the other mentions of Jamie's decks, I'm in the middle of getting one ATM and to get one under $200 once all is said and done is pretty much not gonna happen and the only way you miiiiiiight be able to is not having him do anything to it besides the shape I believe. Between custom add ons (paint, routing, etc), which deck you choose, shipping? etc you'll have a hard time doing so. Rode on a few of them and they're worth it though :-)  It's actually the real reason I am selling this deck. to fund my red ember for my new TB DD build. HAHAHA.

Huh? How do you figure? Think is thick and rigid as fuck, why would it crack? And im sure whoever buys it will add an enclosure on there....?

Stick some trucks on it. Then take a picture of the deck with you standing on it. The enclosure provides structural support.
