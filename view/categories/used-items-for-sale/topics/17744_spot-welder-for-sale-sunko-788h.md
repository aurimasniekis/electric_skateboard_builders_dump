Sunko 788h spot welder was working fine till it blew a fuse I replaced the fuse same thing happened again.
Think it's a comon fault remember reading from @longhairedboy that someone was buying these up and fixing them,i don't have the time to pull it apart I just bought another.
Payed over a Â£100 looking to get Â£50 for it think that's more than fair.
Â£6 postage royal mail uk

I bought mine on Ebay from a guy in Chicago who allegedly was buying them in bulk from china and replacing certain parts to make them reliable. 

I've been using it for about a year and i've made probably 20 packs on it, some much bigger than others. 

I have yet to have any sort of issue other than burning down my welding tips from not getting quite enough contact pressure with the strips on occasion. 

One thing I like to do though is set the unit on the edge of the bench to where i can hold the unwelded pack oder the welder's tips without touching the edge of the bench, then i clamp the welder to the bench so that i can put more pressure on the weld location before hitting the pedal. IT gets much cleaner welds that way and they are stronger too.

i clamp the welder to the bench

That's brilliant how did I not think of that before!? I end up lifting the thing off the bench trying to get better pressure. Good idea...

Wish I knew what part it was that needed fixing it is actually a good machine it's just the reliability issue once that's fixed will be gtg.
That is a good idea to clamp it down will try that with my new one!

I'm amazed at how inconsistent these machines seems to be. I've only done one pack so far on my machine, but it worked except for two small hiccups. I ran it on a 16amp ceramic fuse, even though the "manual" that came with it said that minimum was a 25amp ceramic fuse.
