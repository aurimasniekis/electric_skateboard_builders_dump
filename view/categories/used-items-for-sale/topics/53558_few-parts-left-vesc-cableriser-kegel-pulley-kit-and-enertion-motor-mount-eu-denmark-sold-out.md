Special made :-) Not from a company directly, caps from a torqueboards vesc, rest of the parts are soldered on by a local guy that didnt do an amazing job so had MartinSp to fix it up for me.

Using same parts as the Esk8.de vesc or atleast most of them  i had a while ago so should be a solid vesc.

Didnt have a picture of the mount before but here we go, used cargrade paint on it and baked it so it should last.

All screws are there, also fixed up the carbonfiber s√• it looks great again.
