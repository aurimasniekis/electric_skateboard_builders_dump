Purchased the Evolve Carbon GT 2:1 about a year ago.  Rode it for 2 months and then put it in storage for fall/winder.  Recently had a baby and am looking to sell.  If you're interested put in a reasonable offer.  I live in Los Angeles so a local buyer would be preferred.

Did you keep it charged for those two seasons?

Unfortunately no.  I kept it charged for the first season but then had the kid and forgot all about the board.

Does it still charge? Technically you are supposed to keep lithium ion batteries charged at about 70% 

If you leave them discharge and if they sink below like 2.5V per cell, you can easily damage the cells and lose capacity?

I just put it on the charger today and it still charges.  Not sure what the range is now, but I rode it around the block in GT mode and it's at 99%.  Won't be able to test it until next weekend if you're still interested.
