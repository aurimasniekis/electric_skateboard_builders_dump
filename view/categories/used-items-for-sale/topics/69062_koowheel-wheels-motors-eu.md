I have a set of 2 front and 2 rear wheels. Motors had new bearings put in and used for a month. No hanger. I'm also not sure if the motors work. 40Euros for 4+ shipping.

Europe, Lithuania, I have all the electronics from that board, but either motors or ESC is not working.
Edit: I can add ESC and remote for 15$ if someone wants to try to make it work.
