Hi all.

Ive just upgraded to the new Flipsky dual FSESC as one of my current ESC's gave me the pink flashing light of doom. Pretty sure its the DRV chip. Kinda used it as an excuse to buy the new shiny one :smile: 

I have sold the working but the broken is still for sale

Amps:50 continuous / 240A Peak
Cells: 3-13S liPo
Voltage: 8v-60v
BEC: 5V:1.5A

Open to offers, will post to the uk for £3, happy to post to the rest of the world but will need to look at shipping costs.

Reasonable offers please.

Thanks

I've just had my Maxfind board go totally dead and think that I may need to put in a replacement esc.

The customer support are on Chinese holiday and not guaranteed to even help after.

Based on the above I'd be interested in the functioning esc at the right price as a security for them being useless.

You should replace it, my maxfind was a joke. speed, range, safety.... Taking out the normal esc and putting something more customizeable is pretty neat, just don't forget you're still working with the same battery. So you'll have to either stick to similar discharge rates as the last esc unless you want to suffer range issues

Makes sense, I'd like to make a new battery with some high grade 18650s later on.

Part of my hesitation is I have the maxfind C and have no idea if it'll fit as a replacement in the small space.

Im in UK so shipping should be easy. 
I just took a look online and theyre about 45 GBP new incl shipping on ebay, so for used I'd say 30GBP is my offer.
