Hey guys,

I’m selling my 90mm 78A flywheels clones, only ridden once on my (non-electric) longboard as I wanted to try out 90mm wheels. Turns out they’re wayyyy too big :joy:

These were bought from MarkOne Boards on the  forum (https://markoneboards.com/store/pvc_887548_3842129/flywheel-center-wheels-90-x-56mm), as I said, only ridden once to try out. I’m asking for  **25€**  for the set + shipping (~10€ in EU, 1.1kg set).
