it's all brand new.
I was in the hospital for months, in an old folks home for two months and I've been home now for a month or so. It's been a crazy roller coaster ride and my family controls all my money, so if I want to buy anything I have to sell stuff.
Probably worth more, but people won't realise it, their so dumb lol

That's a niiiiice build. 2 months ago, I'd have snapped it up. 

Seriously, anyone new to esk8 who wants a great setup without alllllllll of the headaches, you should buy this board.
