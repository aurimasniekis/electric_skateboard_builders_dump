I have a barely used flipsky vesc 6 dual for sale. It was given to me by a friend and he asked me to sell it on the forums. after about a month of communication with flipsky, they said it was likely issues with the bootloader. the lights turn on when powered, and then turn off a few seconds later. If anyone knows how to use the specialized programmer and unbrick the thing, it should be simple enough i hope.


The price we are asking is $215 USD or your best offer (includes shipping anywhere in continental USA)

Please buy this because I get $10 from him if i manage to sell it here :smiley: 
totally worth the effort lol

If it’s so easy to repair why he/you didn’t try to get the esc back to life instead of selling it?

thats why the price is what it is. hes not a vesc expert, and neither am i tbh. its not worth the time to learn how to fix it and get the parts here to do it.

Im happy to close a thread, but dont change the topic title to "Close this thread".  The thread will still exist, all you achieve by renaming a thread like this is to confuse the hell out of new users.
