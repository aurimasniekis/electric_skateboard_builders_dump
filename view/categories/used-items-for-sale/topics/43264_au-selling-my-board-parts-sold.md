Unfortunately the time has come where I am needed to sell my board for other commitments as it has seen little use recently so I'm trying to get as much money as I can for what parts I can sell. 

Motor - Torqueboards 6374 190kV
VESC - Used Enertion VESC 4.12 and New Torqueboards VESC (spare)
Belt Drive - Torqueboards V4 Mount and Torqueboard V2 Trucks (mount supported with two part epoxy, prefer to sell these two together)
Wheels - 83mm Flywheel Clones with Bear Space Balls Bearings (haven't maintained bearings)
Battery - 12S2P Torqueboards Samsung 30Q with enclosure and 3A charger
Remote - Mini Remote
Deck - Landyachtz Nine to Five Wolf (has 6 holes drilled)

Feel free to offer a price on these parts, which have been through about 150-200km of use.

Is the Enertion VESC still available? I already have 1 and having a spare would be mint. Could even convert to duel motor.
