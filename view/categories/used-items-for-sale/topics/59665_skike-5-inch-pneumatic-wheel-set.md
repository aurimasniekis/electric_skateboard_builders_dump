Are these made by using my files? Did they hold up? Mine just exploded...

@biggdaddyhawk they fit standard skateboard bearings

@Maxid I don't know who's .stl design they are but I got them from thingiverse. Mine held out great. The other pieces broke due to excessive force when disassembling the wheels. As for the mud cover, I designed that myself.

Thingiverse or grabcad? got a link? I'd like to see what is different to mine. Maybe I just need to add something to make them hold. what material did you print them in?
