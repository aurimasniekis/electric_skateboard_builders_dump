zippy 8s 8000 mah 30c (two bricks of 4s) they are in series with a 10s balance pcb
If you don't have a 10s charger you need to undo the pack and balance them on your own.
Good shape, half life still ahead. Fireproof bag included. 
I also have around a very fine 8s bms 150 amps not for sale...but if you need it i send at cost.
sold
And last but not least

Underwear used 24/7 for 15 years, never washed. Smell guaranteed at 30m. 50.000 euros

I will consider to pay myself the shippings or part of it (eu only) if you take many things. The prices are more than fair therefore i will not accept offers. They go as they are.
