Hey folks-

A lot has changed in my life over the past couple years and I‚Äôm no longer riding the ol esk8 nearly as often. I‚Äôm going to de-electrify the Arbor and sell off the parts :frowning:  I likely only charged and rode this thing ~20 times so the cycles on the battery and all components is low. Here‚Äôs the part list:

***Mono Drive-train-***
-Enertion R-Spec 6372 190kv
-Enertion Motor Mount
-Enertion VESC Platinum  
-SpaceCell PRO3 10s3p  - the housing is a bit old and cracked- namely some of the mount points but the cells are in tip top- you could just get a new enclosure and be solid. 

I‚Äôve also got some assorted parts:
15t 12mm motor pulley and 12mm belts 
-@torqueboards 2.4ghz Nano (v1) Remote Controller   diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller/


If you‚Äôre interested or want more info/pics just hit me up and make me an offer. üôåüèª If this gets some traction I‚Äôll start pulling it apart and post pix. 

Here‚Äôs a link to the original build thread:

I think all in with the battery 300 would be fair

I am trying to piece together a second board so my 14 yo son and I can do some riding together.  I could offer 100 for the motor and mount and another 100 for the battery.   I know this is not nearly what you paid but if your interested in a quick sale I can send over the money ASAP. Thanks for your consideration

Why not? someone in this same forum was asking $120 for TWO 6374 R-Spec motors! Someone has the good chance to adquire that motor (and mount) for $100 (which is a great profit for the seller).

Hey folks. So people do seem to be interested. At the moment the motor and mount look to be sold (pending a transaction) as are the belts and pulleys. 

That leaves the remote, battery and VESC. Still fielding offers so hit me up. I‚Äôm going to do a tear down today and get some photos up.

Okay here‚Äôs so pix as promised. I‚Äôll start dissassembly when someone actually sends me money. I found some extra bits in my kit if anyone is interested. I have a spare metal kegal pulley as well as a 3D printed one that is good in a pinch (think of it as a donut- won‚Äôt last very long) 70* and sunny in SoCal today is really making this difficult to let go of!![image|666x500](upload://aMk0Hu8EH1SLNqP5Ofzjv87TX5E.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://st1VbP0234MCaLpy4BGoPw9CjIc.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jK3Qnv3wY2GPwWwtqsqmGAhw3Um.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://uP0vJYz6sqOdijYwFLM1dY1qyrg.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://9Knbc0T3apZ3tZKuj7zEAlAtojU.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://iPHUshLxWT9GciXHIE55w2QS2S0.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://shZIHFnFPh8GrpRKDuIUDTmYNaE.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://m1Hr63hFfBrEMtQD6fMxOdzlrBB.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://jOfQwbcLK3CHVPvGuxdH6uQO51u.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://cbKe35HMdLCTT8iclO6bGJDOOpc.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://5xuslwHDaTVped8SdRnaJedt8DS.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://yGl43s4oosUlVCEKMBJ9sVnrBN3.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://2yXHGp3OXX6Nhnf5Ibalk1ZglIi.jpeg)

Before you sell that space cell you need to take it off the board and show it off a little... space cells are known to have issues with water ingress, and unfortunately its pretty important :(
