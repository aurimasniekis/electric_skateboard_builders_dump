So I'm switching to 97s for my current build which means I'll be letting go the Evolve 107s. They're still like new condition with one very small chip in one of the wheels. As you can see from the picture, only minor wear&tear of the Logo and wheel surface. Asking for $110 shipped conUS.
Also got the Evolve 38T upgrade gear and belt set, still in mint condition, barely used. Asking for $85 shipped conUS.
Both all together: $190 shipped conUS
PM me if interested.
