STOLEN in Santa Monica

Suspect is Asian, about 6 feet tall, heavy accent (possibly english as a second language), lanky and mid to late 20s. 

He claimed to be an avid skateboarder and community member but really just an POS. 

Please contact me with any info if someone tries to sell you a used Evolve Carbon All Terrain. 

It has 8" rubber tires with black wheels. Looks exactly like pictures attached.

There are a few discernible features that I can point out that will show it's mine.

He pretended to be scared about how powerful it was. Left his non-powered skateboard and iphone (which turned out to be busted and probably also stolen) almost hit a car then took off across the intersection.

Dumb of me to assume the stuff he set down was real or of any value to him. He took it out of his pockets because he didn't want to break it when/if he fell. He played the act well and I have sold many items successfully on craigslist without issue or thievery. Always met in well light, high traffic area, etc. If there is a next time it'll be cash up front before riding. I've met up a few times for group rides in the area and they we're all good people. I'll have to have my guard up in this hobby too, unfortunately 😞

Wow, what a scammer. I was in L.A. South Bay earlier this year... all type of scams around Hermosa, etc. I was sitting down eating and there were some guys pimping out their relatives who said they had no money to get back to China... they wanted a donation... I said OK... they said they need at least $100...lol.. I gave them $5.  They had a picture book and a little pamplet about their cause and everything.  Did not seem legit at all. Not to laugh, I know it feels really bad what you are going thru right now.


Maybe we have to get a GPS tracker or something... this one below looks like there is no monthly fee...

That sucks. The description almost sound like me! but I'm just heavy, no heavy accent. Were you trying to sell or just offering to put a smile on someone's face? I always have my GoPro when selling to Craigslist people.

I sold my un-used Acton Blink LITE to @joeadams101 over the weekend and let him ride my Boosted 2. I was hoping he would take off with it, he left me his car.  

This story was on the news a while back, hopefully you have some luck.

The suspect also left items behind (iphone, skateboard and charger)so hoping for a finger print hit.

This is why if a stranger or someone your selling asks to ride, you bring a faster rider along to tail them. I'll push anybody off a board in a second if your stealing/running. Lol we had this one guy so excited to try a boosted and he kept saying "I'm not stealing it" oing around the parking lot passing exits. I simply said "that's fine, I'm just ensuring you don't, continue your test ride I'll he right here behind you." Of course he didn't steal it, but he was about to get roadrashed the way he was acting. Gotta keep your guard up boys.

It would be possible to disable the board with @Ackmaniac's firmware over Bluetooth?  I know only 33m range

That would be a cool feature, if the board leaves the signal range of the app then shut down board

So were you trying to sell the board, or was it just someone wanting to test it out? I wasn't clear on that part.

If this was a sale, I wonder if it would be an idea to try making another posting with another board as bait, then getting a friend to wait at the location for you to see if this guy is trying this multiple times?

To Mikey :
Constructive criticism is always helpful to others, but just plain old rudeness isn't.

 This guy was trying to sell his board, and of course people are going to ask for a test ride. Most people test ride a car before buying, for example.

Update: I have followed up with PD and there is not an ETA on when they'll have finger print or video evidence.

On a brighter note, the way my renter's insurance is structured, it did cover off site property. I was able to provide the police report, all the information I had and they decided it met the requirements for coverage less a dedictible. 

Let this be a cautionary tale, GET RENTERS INSURANCE IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY. Policies range anywhere from $100-$250 a year depending on your area and coverage preferences.

I feel slightly better that I'm not out all the money but I am still furious about the theft. I'm actively checking classified sites and if you all could continue to keep your eyes open, I would appreciate it.

Thank you all for the support (and criticism). It's a thread like this that remind me how many good people are in this hobby and I won't let one a55hole ruin that.

Good to hear!

I hate to say this though...but knowing the Asian community in Cali and how those kind of thieves operate...you might not see the board posted in the classifieds. I find it completely wrong, but I have relatives that buy stolen merchandise, just to save a buck, and don't care if it's stolen. There's a network of people who do this bull and it's word-of-mouth.

Heck...some will fake the asian accent just to dupe people too.

No but it certainly is a learning lesson.  We all have a ripoff because of some POS at some point, all you can do is learn just how silly you were to have this happen in the first place and learn from it...

Ive had a skateboard stolen to me in this exact same manner when i was 12.
Wasnt able to skate again for another 7 years because of $$$.  But i didnt care, especially because i realized... yeah letting him ride around the lot seemed like a great idea at first.   

or Like how i bought a liftboard thinking i was making a good investment.

Like he said live and learn... learn to laugh at yourself lifes not that serious.

I get why you blocked my comment though, i guess im just used to people who can take criticism.  hence why ill stop talking now.


p.s. the other comment i admit was personal xD..

Of course it is a learning lesson. The biggest mistake one could make at this point is to NOT learn from this experience and be better prepared next time.

Constructive criticism is pointing out something done wrong or not as well as it could be and then offering some advice of how to go about it a better way for next time.

that might turn off a prospective buyer.. best way to do it is to go to an enclosed place with only 1 exit that you stand by, so like a basketball court or tennis court.. also good to ask for cash upfront too, and if they're not happy with it no worries you will just give back their money.

Man how frustrating is it when some scumbag does that shit.  My 10 year old recently lost a 1200 buck pro scooter by letting an older kid ride it at the local skatepark.  He was chatting,  turned around and old mate was halfway across the park.  Gone.  I staked out every skatepark in the area for 2 weeks but no joy.  He learnt a very good lesson that day.  Just glad you had insurance and hopefully the cops will get the arsehole.

Would be cool if someone could develop a Bluetooth key fob type device that you can keep in your pocket so if your bored left you from a certain distance it would just shut off.

I thought about doing that, or just having some other sort of remote shut off but it is just another failure point within the design. I'd prefer to just be careful and not let people I don't know ride than introduce another device that has a potential to fail and loose breaking ability at 30+ mph.

I got an idea: why not try to meet with the client.... outside, on the parking lot of your nearest police station!

No unfortunately not. Didn’t look into that topic.

Yeah Bluetooth is not good for this application. Afaik sim card GPS trackers are more practical. I just don't know which ones work and cheap. Most of them are 2G based so we can't use them in the US.

@Andy87 
I Have the Tile on my wallet, keys, and in my day bag.
Yes they have short range. But if it passes others with the tile app it will track its last known location. 
I actually found my wallet last November after 
black Friday shopping because of this feature. Someone picked up my wallet when i was shopping at Ross.  They made the mistake of going to best buy lol. Where every other employee has a Tile. Lol

Tile isn't *super* viable for an esk8, I'm putting one in mines since i'm always near my board but in terms of getting stolen, I don't see anyone carrying an esk8 slow enough for any connection to be made. And even then it's an esk8, if they have the remote their busing away faster than anyone can identify them. and if they don't have the remote it's worse since they're probably going to sell it off. 

I wish their was a long term gps solution but good ones either require a subscription or die within weeks.

Get an old iPhone, put it in the enclosure and hook it up to the battery so the phone charges when the board is on, install "Find my iPhone" and BAM!

If they don't have it they aren't moving very fast. 
If they do have it, you'd be surprised how stupid thieves can be when they think they got away with something. Especially if what they stole is fun to ride.
I got my bike stolen 2 years ago. For sure thought guy sold it after 3 months. I shit you not,  i saw my bike locked up outside A buger place 2 blocks from where it was stolen.  I just waited outside after calling the police. 
Im not saying the tile is a for sure thing. 
But anything helps. Thieves are not always the sharpest.

True but it's not like your walking around with a big ole board. they'll be at home (lets be honest if your stealing a board you'll have a car ready to jet) , where the chances of a passerby with the tile app penetrating his home is the chances of seeing a killer whale in the desert.

True True True

But a tile will work less with them flying around. You're betting on the chances that they'll stop at a red light and that someone who so happens to have the tile app AND not have their phone in power saver mode to detect the tile in the board.

I feel you man , just don't want people thinking tile are as viable for esk8's as they are for wallets. Usually you walk around with a wallet, not very likely the case with esk8's much less 15lbs+ ones

Ive never put my phone on power saving mod.
And idk about you.but i go places on my board. And you know stop to eat. Talk on my phone, shop, take a piss, smoke a blunt.

As i said. Its not a for sure thing. But a $20 piece of plastic that increases my chances of finding it by even 10% is woth it to me.

Yes, but it can get within 45m of *anyone's phone* that has a Tile.  Not just your phone.  Someone can drive by with a Tile and it will ping you that yours has been spotted.
