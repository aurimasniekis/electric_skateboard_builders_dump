Everything is in pretty much brand new condition. I bought a 12s4p pack so I‚Äôm selling my first build. Literally has about 30 miles on it. 

TB on/off $40

B6 chargers with power cord - $30 ( each charger has extra charging Plugs, xt60 direct charging cord then 2 parrelle charging boards one is xt60, other is banana plugs )

I have 4 turnigy 5s 5000mah lipos, 20c with max 30c discharge. All have xt60 connectors. $30 a piece or $100 for all 4

4mm HXT series connectors, changed from banana plugs to deans so you can run each pack in series for 2, 10s1p packs. 

Will add pics when I get home. Will not pay any shipping and only US unless you want to pay shipping.

I've had this same thing happen before, customer unhappy with what he received and starts bashing seller on forum, this is a quick way to get shut down and piss off seller, calm down and just talk, I agree those lipos don't look too hot

okay i Tried talk him trough and he offer me another free set of garbage lipo for me to pay the shipping. This just crossed me. u think Im ganna fall for that mockery?
i offered 25 shipping back since its partially my fault, and refused. why? cuz i posted picture here.
he knew what's comming. 

u know whats more shocking? the pakage was a literally a big box bunch of paper. fully charged lipo just tumble through all the way from Olando. this guy has no standard.

hey whats with the golden charger? IT does look quite interesting and im sure I havent seen many like that.. is it also just b6 50W one?...

Other than that.. not really into buying it.. just curious what it is and it might some other buyers.. bad luck with the lipos.. i assume they were as puffed before u shipped them out, right?

I said it was a garbage enclosure. If they didn‚Äôt work and hold a full charge I‚Äôd understand but they do. I was getting 4-5 miles out of those each ride. I‚Äôm 190 and used a Tb 6374 190 Kv.  I sold them because I know have a 12s4p pack. It wasn‚Äôt enough speed or range but there were no defects.

@Mattmccrary8 This was clearly misleading. The LIPOs are obviously not any good. If you want to sell on the forum again split the difference with the buyer.

@onepunchboard sorry you were mislead. You two need to hash it out directly not publicly. Even after a FNF sale via paypal you can contact your credit card company and dispute a charge. Try that.

Closing this thread.
