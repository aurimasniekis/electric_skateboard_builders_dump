Hey guys, 

I am selling off my Trampa MTB. This board i bought from a local guy here which seldom use, after i bought and start to build put in ESC and battery. All running well. 
But the problem is i cant always take out for a ride. I living in singapore, this MTB is too large for me to take along and taking the train and buses. I am thinking to get another board with pneumatic wheels. ESC mount is made by own self with MDF board. this is not permanent solution, you have design your own one. 
So i try my luck to sell here. 

Pricing for the board with motor, FVT sleeping lion ESC and mini remote all together is USD1000. You can just plug 12S battery and go for run. 
for the shipping fee, depend which county you from. i have to check my local shipment. and try to bargain a good price. 

Anyone if interest just shoot me a message. We can discuss.
