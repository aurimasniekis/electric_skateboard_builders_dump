I have two boards, fully working only ridden about 10 miles.
They have been collecting dust for about 8 months now so I need to sell them.
$219 each or make me an offer.

Based on the remote I’d say the meepo 1.5 or lower

The MEEPO is sold. 
I still have the TEEMO.
It's the same thing, really. But the TEEMO is a good amount faster.
Make offers.

samsung cells

:arrow_up:

This means nothing.  That's like saying "It's a Ford car"

Ford makes Mustang and Focus and everything in-between.  Even a 1978 Pinto is "a Ford car".

Samsung makes some great cells and some much-less-great cells.
