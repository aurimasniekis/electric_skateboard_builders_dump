These baseplates make your ride way softer. Dampens impact and nearly eliminates road vibrations. The reason i’m selling them is because they don’t fit my carvons.
Because they move over only 1 axis they do not affect the likelyhood of speedwobbles. They cost 100 dollars new and i’ve used em 3 times for testing purposes.

They’re going out for 85 dollars
