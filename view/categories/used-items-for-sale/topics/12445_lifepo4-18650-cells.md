I have many valence saphion Lifepo4 18650 cells about 3000 to be more exact, and was going to incorporate them into budget Longboards but many people have stated they would prefer a battery pack from a manufacturer ( after the whole galaxy s7 media reports). These cells altough are very duable and can be punctured and overcharged without causing any danger to life or limb, they will not work afterwards though. So I was thinking about selling a large amount at 2.5$-3$ a cell is anyone interessted?
