Hello, i want to sell my mountainboard. This is my 2nd version, made 1 year ago. Done about 300-400km, no problems.

-Aluminum drive train with 1:6 gearing, HTD5 15mm width belts (one belt as spare (i can provide more))
-Modified NE:XT Blaze mountainboard with channel trucks and 9" tires (two inner tubes as spare)
-Custom remote controller, made from GT-2B car RX/TX.
-Tires, bindings, trucks, wood - perfect condition, just normal usage.
-At rear is red blinking 4W LED strip for road safety.

-Range is about 18-19 km at full power - avg speed is 22 km/h.
-Speed is limited to 32 km/h, limit can be changed in BLDC VESC tool, theoretical max speed - 60 km/h.
