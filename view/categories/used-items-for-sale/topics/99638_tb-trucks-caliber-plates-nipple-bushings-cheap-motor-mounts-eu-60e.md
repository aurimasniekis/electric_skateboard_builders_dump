Here I have a pair of used TB trucks.
With all the usual upgrades:
Caliber baseplates in 50/44,
Rocking Riot pivot cups in 97,
Nipple bushings.

I would like 70euros for them + shipping inside Eu

And a pair of motor mounts, one is cut tho for faster motor replacement. Comes with bearing idlers. 25 euros or 20 with the trucks. I am open to offers.

So is it 44 or 50 deg.? And as I understand you sell it with caliber baseplates only? (without TB baseplates)

It's 50 for front and 44 for the back. I could sell with TB plates, but why would you want that?

if trucks have different baseplates the back of the deck will be lower then front? 
and what is wrong with TB baseplates? :P

Caliber baseplates are a bit more well made and trucks come out a bit more stable, than with the stock plates, height difference is like 2mm, pretty much no difference in real life. :)

Are you willing to sell the baseplates by themselves?
