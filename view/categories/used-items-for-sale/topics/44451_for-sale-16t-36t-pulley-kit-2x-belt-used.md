You really need to combine these for sale items into a single thread.  It will be easier to manage for you and wont clutter the feed with half a dozen threads.

I've got 4 things for sale. Could have combined my two motors. But other than that they have nothing to do with each other. So I think it's fine like this. When people start to comment it is easier this way. But thnx for the tip, will use it next time.

It’s not that the items has nothing to do with each other rather that you are the same seller and all items belongs to you

Not sure, it fits the SK3. I'm at work so I can't measure it right now.
