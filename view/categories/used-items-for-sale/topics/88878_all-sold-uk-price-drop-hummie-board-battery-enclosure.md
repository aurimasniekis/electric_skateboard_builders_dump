@Balta_6 this could be your chance lol.

Darn, if only I hadn't been dreaming about modifying a switchblade for so long I would grab this for myself. Very compelling deal. Been staring at this post for a while now lol

I looked at myself, my decks look at me, my banker look at me
It's a general decision, but I'll leave it sadly 
Goodbye Hummie deck, you were never mine but I still loved you like my own child...

Aaaand bought! Hahaha :smiley:

Does anyone want to trade their single stack Hummie enclosure for a double stack one? I can't imagine needing that many cells (would rather have the deck closer to the ground), so am looking to acquire a single-stack one :slight_smile:

@rusins even the dual stack is really slimline when on the deck due to the internal cutout in the deck.
Wait until you get it to see.

Well the deck doesn't have mounting holes in it yet, so works for me :upside_down_face:

I'll get back to you after I receive the deck and enclosure!

Nope, I bought it. Going to trade enclosures with @linsus . Don't want to sell the deck because I'm already committed to a build by purchasing Haggy wheels. Thread can be closed :slight_smile:
