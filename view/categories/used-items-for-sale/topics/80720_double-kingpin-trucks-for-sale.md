Bought for a previous build, but never used them. Asking for $40 for the set.

What are the specs? I'm helping guy who wants to build his own and he want a diy evolve with the AT tires (who doesn't?). These might be perfect for him.

Pss. I wouldn't ride double Kingpin over 30mph unless it was on a bet or i was getting paid.  They are fun to carve but are not made for speed.

That was exactly my thinking. My friend wants torque and light offroad ability, not speed.

I love DKP but also wouldn't go over 30mph on them.  But I wouldn't go over 30mph ever anyway --because it only adds astronomical risk and doesn't really get you to where you're going much quicker at all.

10". And the reason I don't want them is exactly what everyone here is saying. It's not great for over 30mph, but that's exactly my planüòÅ

This is the link I got it from, but it looks like they raised the MOQ.
