If I buy everything new I come to 814£...
Even less as you wrote higher prices for some articles than they are on the trampa website.
Why people should by yours instead of new parts from trampa?
It’s 800£ shipped or without shipping?

I don’t think he has put a price, simple what they are worth new. On offers I think 👍🏻 That’s how I read it anyway

Over £800 PM me offers!

I understand this like: from 800£ I take offers, below no.
Maybe it’s just written strange for my understanding 😅

ill admit, after seeing so many boards erupting into fire i do not feel confident in doing it myself. 
I had Kevin Dark making 2 pack's  for me but it took so long to get them completed i got a refund.

I'm pretty sure it'd be prohibitive, but there may be others out there that are curious.
