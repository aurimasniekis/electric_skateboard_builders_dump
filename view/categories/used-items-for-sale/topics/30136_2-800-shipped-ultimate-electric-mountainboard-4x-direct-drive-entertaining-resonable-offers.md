You should add a video of it in full flight :sunglasses:
Might help you get a buyer
Including the ply# of the board might help too

Seems nice but $3400 seems steep for a used board. My 4wd boards cost me around $2800 at retail pricing. 

Best of luck selling it though. Looks nice.

It would probably be because this is a direct drive setup with brand new drives that just hit the market not so long ago the mounts for the motors alone go for $1,000 not to mention the battery Bank on this is a 12s 20 hour lithium polymer battery Bank in the board recharges in 2 hours 320 to 35 miles is possible with this board in two wheel drive set up the sport also has two wheel drive front or rear or four-wheel drive select ability also I wouldn't quite call this board used I would call it test that I built this 2 or 3 months ago and I've literally taken it out for four or five rides most of which were used to tweak the board no more than a custom builder would have to do to make sure everything operates correctly if done right. Thanks for your interest I have a button available for people to make offers for what they seem fair I don't have any sort of a limit set I'm really looking for offers from everyone at this point

Problem with the Lipos, They look like they are only 20C so not the best and because they are 6s packs, they are thick leaving what appears to be too little ground clearance.

It wasn't meant to be annoying or disrespectful. Just a truthful observation.
I misunderstood your thread, I thought you where thinking of buying the board, not trying to sell it.
And as far as who flagged my post, I wonder.......
No matter, anyone can view the hidden content with a click of the mouse.
I also read the post that you withdrew and I personally like and use Lipos on my builds as well.
As for the lack of ground clearance, you did post this as an Ultimate electric Mountainboard not a street cruiser.
So one would only assume that it is meant for offroad use which is what most peeps use them for.

Well a bit of information to counteract that I think I will share with you all that this battery bank is able to produce 600 amps without breaking a sweat and continues to do so every time I have wriden it.  WiFi batteries are not capable of producing that kind of power especially not enough to feed a 12 kilowatt monster and still able to go 25 miles without breaking a sweat as for bottoming out a ramp this thing off of sidewalks over curbs and onto the concrete and have rarely ever bottomed out if you are bottoming out you are definitely not riding this thing correctly I can promise you that this thing is not going to bottom out any more than any of the Longboards that are out there this was not made to go off-road this was made to do what longboards do but only better

Didn't you seriously ask for others to pay for your hobby? You are having a hard time selling your board because to the majority it's just an overpriced toy. I realize you have spent time and money in it and you should have never done this if you could not afford it. This is an expensive hobby. You will have to greatly lower your price or part it out. Good luck.

alright, I'll bite. Will you be willing to sell the board without the batteries and vesc? I don't need the boxes either, so basically i'm asking if you're willing to sell the board and etoxx drive trains only. You can sell off the other parts in this forum and it'll probably be easier & profitable.

I wish you were willing to name a really good price I would unfortunately be unwilling to do this I would have nothing to do with the cart if they didn't sell and all of my parts are made specifically for this bored.

How about this, it takes 2-3 weeks to get my batteries done and I can always buy a direct drive from another local DIYer. You try to sell the parts here on the forum and if no one bites (on most of the other parts) or if someone is willing to buy the whole board, we'll call the deal off and be on our merry ways. 

However, if someone does buy most of the parts, I'm willing to pay for the board and drive trains at cost. Meaning if you show me the invoice for trampa and etoxx direct drive, I'll pay for the cost you pay and I'll pay for shipping also. 

Honestly, selling it for parts is a lot more better since people here will always want to buy parts like vesc, batteries and enclosures. I'm only willing to pay for your "used" board at cost because I was planning on making 4wd anyways, Unless you already put some dents/scracthes on the board or hundreds of miles on the drive trains, then I'd probably just call the deal off. Give it a shot and think it through, hoping you'll reconsider.

I don't want to overstep, but it might be worth trying selling the other stuff in parallel, even as a bundle, just to see what happens.  If it can sell for ~$2800-(whatever Nate is offering), then it would be worth at least _trying_, right?  It really is an impressive looking board, but it's also quad direct drive and even though I'm still a noob in this esk8 world, that seems like it would require a bit more niche attention to sell, IMO... and getting cost back in return for a substantial portion of the board is worth _trying_ to make work... if you're serious about selling, that is.

I was flirting w/ the idea of throwing out a much worse version of Nate's offer before he made his :slight_smile:.  

If Nate's offer is still off the table, I'd suggest including some video footage of the board in action.  The more attention it gets, the better your chances... you need to find someone whose priorities and budget align closely w/ yours to recoup as much as possible.  It is a badass board, though... just too much for _me_.

BTW, what wheels are those :slight_smile:?

To be honest I don't remember the exact ones I know that they are from trampa I could look them up if you really want me to I think I custom picked the rims and spokes separate.

The way I see it the only parts that are on the board that would sell separate is the deck the trucks the motor mounts the batteries Maybe maybe the vesc 

And there's a lot more on this board that people wouldn't buy like the hundred fifty amp power recording module the underglow the VSC boxes the supercapacitor banks that are built for the board the controller the charger... I would be lucky to get 2100 bucks parting it out and in all honesty unless I get 2800 bucks for this thing still put together I'm just going to pay it off and keep it and joy ride it on weekends I'm already taken a 1.5 k hit on it I'm not about to go anymore and quite honestly it's probably the best board that there is out there for what it's built to do so in all honesty I'm not really going to rush to sell it I guess I'll just pay it off and keep it unless someone buys it from me before then

Thanks man I tried to over build everything I do the less work your drivetrain has to do the longer you're bored will last and the more reliable your system is not to mention the fact that I wanted to have acceleration like no other. I live in the Ozarks in Missouri and I do go to some pretty hardcore hills around here and I have yet to find anything I cannot climb. Funny story My Brother and I took a couple of two-by-fours and tried to stand it up as vertically as we possibly could and I stood on the board and was able to climb up at successfully we were able to achieve an angle at which the rubber could no longer apply the traction to the wood so technically give me an ankle with traction and I will climb it. :)

All of this talking about this thing makes me want to keep it LOL

If you're willing to part ways with it for $2600, I can take it off your hands. I'm not trying to lowball you, but its hard for me to justify paying more than that for a used board. I understand the thoughts and design you put into it, especially the switches, but as I said, why would I pay more than 2.6k when I can make one for almost the same specs and off road?

That said though, I honestly think you're making a mistake by selling this board for less than 3k. I'm not shooting myself in the foot here, but you don't sound like you want to sell it at all. If its within your ability to pay it off and brave a couple of days/weeks of cup noodles, why not do that? Its very unlikely people would pay 3k for a used board, the diy esk8 market is not yet big enough for people to spent that kind of money on second hands, and on top of that, you can't quantify the amount of man hours of sweat, blood and agony you spent building this beast. Anyway, let me know what you think about the offer.

Thanks again for the kind words Nate I really don't want to sell this and it would be more like 6 months of cup noodles for me I have two or three other parties offering me around my asking point right now and two of them sound relatively interested so I feel relatively confident this will sell if I don't get around my asking price after fees and what not I will just keep the board and cup noodles for a while.

It really does suck selling something like this you couldn't count how many hours is spent trying to heat up stupid heavy gauge wire to get it to solder and what not not to mention the design and money thanks again

Hi ieatflys, you might find that you get more quality inquiries if you do not come across as being so desperate. I'm not so sure spam posting your topic to keep it at the top of the thread list will really help. Try periodically adding posts that add pictures or video content to engage people... & show them how cool or fun your board is...

All that towing was done on 4wd sensored FOC at 12S  with the TB VESC's you built it with btw 😉. We also added 1" risers and swapped the remote and receiver to a GT2B in a Master Cho enclousure. It takes off buttery smooth from a stop and has great throttle modulation for acceleration and braking with settings of 30ABatt max, 60A motor max, 8A Batt min, and 60A motor min.
