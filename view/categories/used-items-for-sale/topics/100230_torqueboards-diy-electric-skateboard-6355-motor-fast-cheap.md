This is a Almost New 63mm 6364 Electric skateboard motor from torque boards and  it works great but I'm in a bit of a money punch right now. I got this about 2 weeks ago and was really looking to start using it but I need to pay rent payments. Kept for only two weeks since recent purchase in a smoke free home and adult owned.![20%20PM|668x500](upload://mayM8AnxDKESVjGfyZpEMGx8jwk.jpeg) ![26%20PM|668x500](upload://dU4U2X3OFLgxPQ1cjhAQk7A90hD.jpeg) ![32%20PM|667x500](upload://9HAdjewVIEQGXmhxhDhJxHIy1Vy.jpeg)  Please message me with any questions about the item.

I changed the title for you, but your post says its a 6364.

It is clearly a 6355

@Rdz990 Dude. Stop spamming the forum with single items for sale. If you have a pile of shit to sell, make one thread and list all the shit in it.
