I have more parts than I need for my custom boards, so I'm selling off a large variety of components. Some parts were taken from brand name pre-built boards (brands ranging from Liftboard to Evolve), some are from "universal" diy kits, and some are parts I have 3d printed. 

Recently I have put a website together to help showcase my custom builds and to help sell some of this overstock. I am still adding content and products, but you can check it out at [PitbullElectricSkateboards - DIY Parts](https://pitbullelectricskateboards.com/collections/parts-new-and-used)

On that site payments can be made using Paypal, Credit Card, and Debit Card. 
Everyone can use the promo code "ESK8.BUILDERS" (without quotes) to save 5% of your total order.

Feel free to contact me with any question. 

I have about 20 of these electric skateboard ESC's for sale. These ESC's were taken from single and dual motor Liftboards.

These are not used, but they were previously installed in boards.

Each ESC includes:
ESC
Receiver
Receiver extension wire
Remote controller
On/Off button with integrated anti-spark circuit

These ESCs were designed for **6S** setup.
Single Motor ESC = **40A** (900watts)   **$50**
Dual Motor ESC = **80A** (1800watts)    **$80**

The remotes are 2.4 ghz, they have two speed modes pre-programmed and offer direction change by pressing a button. LED lights on the remote show the status of the battery on the board (6S only) and indicates when the remotes battery is getting low.

The remote charges via a common micro USB cable.

More explanation would be great, is the throttle and braking smooth, is there a rpm limit, does it have a lvc, and is it running foc or bldc. 


Answers to these questions would help you to sell many more

It means you have spent more than a day on this forum to either sell parts or scam people.  More explanation about the parts with pictures would be extremely helpful for those interested.

I will be posting more photos of all the parts I'm selling. The photos will be much more close up and detailed. I am also writing up more thorough descriptions. It's just taking a while because I have a lot of stuff for sale. 

Regarding how to purchase from me, I own a few online retails stores, so I may list all of the items on one of my e-shops, or if someone is interested in a special order or bulk order, I can send a custom invoice via email or direct message through esk8.builders messaging. The link will lead to a secure payment page and the payment will be processed through my online store, which is powered by shopify and processed by shopify payments. This will allow for multiple payment options including debit card, credit card, Paypal, Amazon Pay, and even Bitcoin.

Because of all the items I am listing, I will probably make a new thread, as there are many more parts other than ESC's. In which case, I will post a link in this thread that will direct everybody to the complete listing.

Since you are new to building electric skateboards, feel free to message me if you have any questions. This is a great site, with tons of useful information and members that are willing to help. Don't be shy. I have been a member for a while but am just now finally trying to be more active.

Actually my first comment on this forum was over a year ago. But I understand the skepticism. Although I'm not sure what about my post throws any red flags, but it's good to be cautious. I am trying to take photos and write descriptions of everything I have for sale, so that it will be easier to look at, and not segmented. It is taking some time, but should be posted soon. Hopefully tonight. 

Some parts are new, but in limited quantities, most parts are unused but were previously installed. Do you think it would be more appropriate to list everything in one post or to divide new and used parts and post in the appropriate sections of this site? Do you think, in your opinion, that it would be best to just continue this thread listing everything, even though the title only mentions esc's? I want to act inline with the preferred etiquette and rules of this forum. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks.

And the screen name "Money" was chosen because I am trying to change my association of with the word to something more positive, rather than something stressful. =)  It was a nickname given to me about 15 years ago, and I have fond memories of that time. That's all. I'm actually one of the most honest people you will encounter. (I'm sure a scammer would say the same thing though.) Don't worry. I'll add to my credibility in my next post/comment.

I'm 39 and run multiple businesses. The only thing I take personally is my word. =) 
I like the fact that the community is on the look out for sharks. And when I made my account a year ago, I wasn't thinking that I'd be posting stuff on here for sale. I can see how it would make a bad impression, like it's my sole purpose or something. Lol.

Would you please give me your input on how I should post the items I have for sale? Should I make a new thread that lists everything? or just continue this thread, even tho the title only mentions ESC's? 

And some of the things I have for sale are new, and some are used. I noticed that there is a separate section for New items for sale. So I should probably post there, but I have a limited quantity of these items, as I am not a vendor.

What would you suggest?
Thank you.

You can update your top post with the pictures followed by the specs @b264 was pointing you in the right direction with his questions. Just make clear you have updated the post for more transparency about your product, it’s all we’re looking for here. Complete transparency and communication :slight_smile:
