Where are you located? Probably not worth it just for one item if you factor in shipping but I can check shipping costs quickly.

Cheapest I got is 20 euros with UPS. Let me know if worth your while :slight_smile:

Do you need a Enertion Nano x remote by any chance? I will have one for sale in about 2 weeks. It just seems silly to pay 20 euro shipping for 20 euro worth of items lol. that's all 

The last option is I have family visiting me from England first week of March who fly back on the 9th March. I could give it to them and they can ship it to you from there. Just depends how fast you want this stuff.

Hi @mutantbass,

I had several issues preparing my battery modules before my flight and I couldn't bring them. That means that I wont be able to prepare my eskate in spain... 

I'll have to take off my offer for the bag sorry :( 

Lets meet the next time Im in Barcelona, I'll message you
