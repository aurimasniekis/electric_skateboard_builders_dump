[/quote]

Sorry, but I can't. I have seen too many people get screwed over on this forum and I don't want it to happen again. So no I'm not going to mind my own business. Especially after I asked him a serious question, he ups the price $20, and then says only friends and family payments are accepted.

There is also absolutely no reason my posts should be flagged.

Your forgot @ajaynagra, who had already done a couple of successful group buys and was cooperating with jlabs himself, who got screwed as well. Don't trust anybody, pay that 3% more and get covered by PayPal, there's no reason not to.

The only concern i'd have is when someone says F+F *ONLY*.  

For a bit of protection, i'd pay the 3% over the asking price to have the insurance.

Maybe @ekitesurfer - allow folks to pay goods/services if they add on 3% to pay the difference?

Seems reasonable and sounds less Scam'ish.

Sorry for the slight off topic but is that F&F PayPal thing only US-US? My PayPal account is EU and even though I choose F&F and enter amount, I always end up selecting if I want the receiving party to get less money than I entered or if I want me to pay more and receiver gets full amount. In other words, I cannot avoid any fees.

## \#49 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2017-07-25T19:14:31.280Z Reads: 111

F+F is only "free" when there is no currency exchange. So EUR to EUR is free for example

I did couple of USD-USD payments. But not doing any exchange. Paypal charges my card in USD (bank is doing exchange, not related to PP) and receiver gets money in USD. Not sure if I made any P&P payments EUR-EUR, will check.

If your using a credit card to fund the payment I think paypal charge you a fee. Other than that, it could be the PayPal fairys :confused:

I am not a vendor. I am a consumer. I am selling these as is, that is why i require f/f. When they leave my possession, i never want to hear about them again. They are fresh from Johnny meduse, that is the same as factory refurbished. I dont want any more questions about how they broke, got fixed etc.
