I am looking to sell a set of 5"x1" set of pneumatic wheels used around 10km. Tires in great condition and can be pumped up to 85 psi. They do not fit directly on regular longboard trucks but would fit on Torque boards 218mm trucks. They accept standard size skate bearings (22mmx8mm). The hubs are aluminium. I can include bearings if you want. 40USD + shipping (I paid 100USD and waited for a month)

I like the idea of 5in numies, but how do they ride?  Have you made pulleys for them?

I made a single pulley but its a 3d printed one in ABS for HTD3M  so wouldnt be that great for the new HTD5M "standard". 
They ride actually pretty great better than urethane wheels for sure. And offer less rolling resistance than 6x2's or 8x2's.

That would be great.  I just need the wheel profile, then I can likely redraw it with an HTD5m 42t pulley.
