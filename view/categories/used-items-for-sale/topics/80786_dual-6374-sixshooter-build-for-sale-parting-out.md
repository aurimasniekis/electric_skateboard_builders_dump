I built this up as a single motor first and used it for maybe 100 mile and then put the dual motors and sixshooter on it, starting another project and so this has to go to fund the next one. Only put about 20 miles on it since the upgrades (To cold to ride here now).

Yes it has everything ready to put the urethane wheels on. With the pneumatics on I'm not sure cause I have only went 5 miles or so on a ride but they sure deplete the battery faster (10-15 if i had to guess), with urethane wheels 15-18 easily, I have done rides with my daughter pretty slow for 6 miles and had 96% left when I got done.
