Bought an extra one of these so am letting it go for $20 shipped in the USA.  Item is brand new, its the Caliber 2 version with double/mirrored idler slots.  Save a little money, and get your motor mount without having to wait 2 weeks for Chinese shipping.

Photos help immensely when selling things.  Also, filling out your profile so folks know what country you're in can help a lot.
