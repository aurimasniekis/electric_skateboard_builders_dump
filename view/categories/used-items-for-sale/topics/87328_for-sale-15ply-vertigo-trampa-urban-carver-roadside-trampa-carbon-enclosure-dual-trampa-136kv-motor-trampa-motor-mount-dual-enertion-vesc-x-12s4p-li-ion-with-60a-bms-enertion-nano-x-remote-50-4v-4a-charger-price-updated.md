Right now the board is **EUR 2500** EU shipped - you are welcome to PM me for a discount. Cheers!

Selling my beloved board I just realised that I have ridden it only like 10 times since I had built it… the new baby, full-time job + some part-time work and writing my MA thesis all make it just impossible to ride it enough to justify having such an expensive piece of equipment stored in my closet 24/7

The board has:

**15ply 35º Street Carver deck (with holes drilled for the bindings - binding included: see below)**

I was building it for myself and done everything super clean to make the whole thing last - and I am convinced I’ts gonna last you a lifetime. The modular battery is my design, made in such a way to minimize the risk of the thing catching fire as much as possible and I do find it to be the safest design out there - also convinced it’s not gonna fail like ever. And **it’s basically new, and everything is in more or less pristine a condition** .

I’ll let it go for about **2500 EUR EU shipped**

and if you really plan on buying it and have any doubt, please read the original thread - there’s **everything documented there step by step** : [BIEDA Board | 15ply Vertigo Trampa Urban Carver | Roadside Trampa Carbon Enclosure | Dual Trampa 136KV Motor | Trampa Motor Mount | Dual Enertion VESC-X | 12S4P Li-ion with 60A BMS | 2.4Ghz Remote ](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bieda-board-15ply-vertigo-trampa-urban-carver-roadside-trampa-carbon-enclosure-dual-trampa-136kv-motor-trampa-motor-mount-dual-enertion-vesc-x-12s4p-li-ion-with-60a-bms-2-4ghz-remote/26902) or don’t hesitate to contact me via PM.

Probably the last pricedrop on this thing. If no-one buys it within few weeks I'll probably just give it to some teen family member to save it from rotting away in my closet.

Someone commented why I just don't ride it myself... I did a few times, and in case you were wondering, it still works flawlessly, but I can't really drop off my one-year old son to his day care with it, and after work I just spend time either taking care of him, or writing my thesis or some other article and there is no way I'm gonna get more free time within foreseeable future.

**Price drop: EUR 2100**, shipping NOT included
