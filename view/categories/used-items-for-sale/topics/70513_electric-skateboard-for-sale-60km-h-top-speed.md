I've only used this board for a few weeks so it is used but ever since I fell I just can't ride it anymore and I'm willing to sell it for $1000 Canadian even though I spent much more than that. I also have a BMS, an extra brand new FOCBOX and the power supply and plugs and everything that I never got to use so you want it I will give it to you with this they are still in the boxes. 


These are whats included to be more specific maybe I missed some but I think I got most.

Also interested if â†‘ doesn't get it.  Looking for an easy way into the esk8 arena that leaves lots of room to customize and experiment.  This seems like a perfect match.
