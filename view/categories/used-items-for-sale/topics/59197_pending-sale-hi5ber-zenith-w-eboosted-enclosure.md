Hey guys selling 2 combos here since some stuff didn't fit properly on my board. All prices listed below are the local price to Los Angeles, CA if you are from San Diego or Santa Barbra area pm me and we can work things out. Lastly, if you want something shipped I'm not opposed but only shipping to CONUS.

~~1st up is the: **Hi5ber Zenith w/ @eboosted Enclosure**~~

~~**Price: $200** for reference new you're looking at $370 -> $215 for the Deck and $125 for the Enclosure + $30 shipping from Peru to US cause that is where Alan is located~~ PENDING SALE

~~2nd is the: **(x2) Sealed and Sensored 6374 190kv w/ @marcmt88 Complete Drive System and TB 218mm Trucks**~~

~~note: the trucks don't come with any bushings I threw away the ones that came with it as they were utter crap, I bought some Riptide bushings with the help of @Deckoz~~

~~**Price: $475** for reference new you're looking at $605 -> $290 for the Motors $240 for the Drive System and $75 for the Trucks~~ SOLD
