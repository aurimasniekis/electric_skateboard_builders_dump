 If you still have a evolve remote, I’m  definitely interested,  are they second generation of the r1?  Are they r2? R1s  are going for 60-70  on eBay, r2s $85 and up.  There just aren’t any at the moment That can ship to me  before my big trip in 10 days,  so I’m kind of desperate and will pay a little extra.  Thanks!
