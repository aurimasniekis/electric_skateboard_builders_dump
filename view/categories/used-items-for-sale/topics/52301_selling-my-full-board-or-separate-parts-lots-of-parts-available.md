Hi, I built my first ever e-board, which has high speed. It goes 50+km/h and has a range of 21+ km. 
I want to sell it because it's too much for me and I wanna build a gaming PC now.

Here's the build:

190kv 6374 motor x1
VESC from diyelectricstateboards
12s2p battery - plug n play
enclosure big enough for battery and vesc
90mm black wheels and trucks from diyelectricstateboards
Deck is constructed all by myself. its about 98cm long and 25cm wide.
battery charger included
nano remote brand new with receiver and micro usb charger as well

I never even went to ride the board. Built it for a school project and showed it in an exhibition, that's it.

If you want, I can sell the whole build to you, or separate parts only.

Some pictures of the build below :)

I can sell for $700 (all the parts and the deck).

expensive because the parts are powerful and expensive

Its getting old when new people come from watching a YouTube video on how to make a electric skateboard without doing there hw and reading and come in here like a car salesman thinking he can talk jiberish and fool us for our money
Anyways  you must post price if your selling something its the rules

I'm sorry man, I will post the prices. Also, the board IS powerful and the total cost of everything together was $865, not including the money spent on building the deck. It was expensive for me. :frowning:

But if someone wants to buy the whole build, I will sell it for $900. I'm not making any profit, simply getting the money back.

If someone wants the parts only, I can do $800. I'll also send the deck since it will be of no use.

If you want to talk about price, you can message me.

I will give you $200 for it, that's my highest offer, with no more than $50 for shipping (your profile does not list your location)

To clarify, in this case not being used is a "con" and not a "pro" because it's completely unknown if there are any problems.  There are always problems.  I can see the belt is not aligned, the screws holding up the enclosure look weak and it's unknown if heavy vibrations will cause an immediate failure.  Half or more of the "DIY" part of building it is not done yet.  Plus it doesn't use a nice remote like the Mini Remote, it has a low quality ESC and it's only 2P and to top it off, it's 12S instead of 10S.  So lots of issues here.  Nobody knows if the motor mount will come loose on the first ride.  It looks like it's not even close to waterproof or water resistant.

The most your going to get for that is 500$  or less most diy boards price drops like a car the second it leaves the lot most of them drop price significantly,
TB trucks 70$
Wheels 50$
Deck - 60$
Vesc 110$
Motor 120$
Battery 330$
Motor pulley gear 100$
Adds up to 840 brand new but its used so your not going to get much for it sadly. Parting it out probably could cut your losses less, also one thing that I would like to point out plug and play parts and charging for "labor" is pretty pointless its diy board.

Man I cant do $200, its way too low for the build. The battery itself cost $330...

I can do $700 though. I changed price but I didnt even ride the board. Just tested it.

I live in China and for shipping, its probably less than $50, so don't worry about that.

[quote="TurtleMan, post:3, topic:52301"]
board IS powerful
[/quote]

Well then is must be powerful... lol

Power is measured in watts. What watts did you actually measure from this board?

In my book, theres 6 categories:

1 - 500w and less - Weak
2 - 500-1000w - Medium Weak
3 - 1000-2000w - Medium
4 - 2000-4000w - Medium Powerful
5 - 4000-6000w - Powerful
6 - 6000w and more - Ultra powerful

You fall in category 2 or 3. since at 40 amps (most a 12s2p can safely discharge) and 50.4 full charge, the best you could ever pull is 2000w. And I doubt your pulling that.

Kudos for actually using a VESC, but these parts aren't known as "Luxury" parts in the DIY community. His parts are meant to be economical, at the cost that it will fail completely for some (because they push the parts too hard) or in maybe have some weird quirks to them, He's not over engineering anything for complete abuse so far, though I hear he might have something new soon that is a higher standard of engineering.

Yea you forgot the pulley and controller stuff. 

Okay, I can do $700 for it. I didnt use it, only tested it, that's it. It's practically new.

But isn't $700 good for this build?

Then say your board is long range and high speed. Power is power, which is measured in watts. Sorry, not trying to be rude, but these forums are frequently read by many who don't know better and it confuses new builders when people use the wrong terms to describe their boards.

If you don't like the board, or don't have interest in buying it, let others see it. I never asked about your board anyways.

Just to make it clear, 700 bucks is not that bad. I basically have the same board (just a bit better battery wise). If you tried to build it from scratch, it would end up costing more, and you need a bit of knowledge in order to put it together without damaging it. Since the 700$ market is basically non existing, it wouldn't be a bad deal for a newbie in the diy scene. Unfortunately, most of us either already have a board better than this, or are willing to built it by ourselves. If I had an offer like this before jumping in the diy scene, I would have considered it

Powerful is fairly subjective. Maybe he has a different opinion in what the term denotes. Maybe ease up a bit since his definition doesn't effect you in any way.

@TurtleMan I apologize if any of us seem a little harsh, it’s just that this is a DIY forum and those with a large amount of experience here know exactly what they like in a board, and the parts that you have chosen happen to cater to a smaller amount of members that are willing to buy it. Additionally, this has happened a few times where people have built boards and then tried to sell them for original cost + labor. In this case, I regret to inform you that since the labor that you put in can be done by others and that since you’ve put the parts together on the board and tested it (even on the bench), they are classified as used and therefore not worth their original cost, putting the total value of your board at less than the original cost. 

That being said, I can understand any frustration that you may be feeling and I highly recommend that in order to recoup costs, you try selling the board on EBay or another similar site. It looks nice aesthetically, and someone who has no experience with boards like these will likely be more willing to pay for labor than someone here who is used to putting in the labor themselves. Again, I’m sorry if you feel offended by anything that we have said, I’m sure that that wasn’t anybody’s intention. Have a good day, and I wish you the best of luck in your sales and the building of your PC!

Look buddy, I'm not trying to call your board shit or anything. In fact, my sportster build is basically identical to yours, except with a 6355 and focbox. Just trying to communicate that the standards for "powerful" on this forum are far above what we have in our builds, commonly costing upwards of $1.2k.

With that being said, like @anorak234 said, go advertise this on a different website OR try to individually sell the parts separately. I'm eyeing up that motor mount.

@TurtleMan, You should just keep it. You went through the hassle of learning about how to build it and bought all the parts...it's not a bad looking build at all. Some of the comments in here are just plain disrespectful. Can a more expensive board be built? Yes, absolutely. Is you're worth the 200 dollar offer from a previous comment? Yes, it is. + more. Problem is this forum is .builders...not .buyers. You're not wrong in assuming it's worth more but truth is when you're selling something, it's only worth what someone is willing to pay...if you can't find a reasonable offer then keep it and use it. Your savings on gas will eventually give you the extra you need for the gaming computer. BTW, you probably already have a computer, have you thought about DIY upgrades to it?
