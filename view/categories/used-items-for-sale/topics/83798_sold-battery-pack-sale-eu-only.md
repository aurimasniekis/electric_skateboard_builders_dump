Selling a battery from my previous build, it’s a 10s5p Made out of unbranded cells 2000mAh, so it’s a 10Ah battery square configuration.
I used for about 100 cicles and it has an integrated BMS, I tried to unwrap  it but I dont find any brand. It’s fully operational, I’m based in Italy![image|375x500](upload://ojPOOYMdgM0zXIBqTJYDwmsHTLx.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://gTYxK8kpVkev3APKq9uW65DymZW.jpeg)

Looks close to the Diyeboard 10s5p, same shape and wiring at least (how it all come out of the one area and the types of connectors)

Yep I think it is, it was on a prebuild board, also unbranded, it was very similar to a ninesteep... The board was from ALien power system
