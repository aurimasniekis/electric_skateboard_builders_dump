Thank u i think I am very interested in the enskate...  dimensions would be awesome.  I am a supporter of old school hammerheads and such far before longboards and I need to know it’s not super long.  Does the enskate  have built in enclosure I can’t really tell from pics.  Looks like one side had a small compartment but it wasn’t very big....
