Like problems you yourself couldn't fix or problems ther people couldn't help fix? There are tons of people on here willing to help get you rolling. Myself included. But you said mac and I don't do mac lol. Care to indulge us on your exact problems? Maybe you get you rolling

You should only need to program it once. The unity is also the easiest to program....

The issue is with the unity itself I believe itâ€™s doa even after consulting with enertion it wonâ€™t connect at all and the only solution left is to send it in

Or perhaps try using bootcamp instead of parallels. Easy to download (since the program is preinstalled by Apple) and ensure the correct drivers and such are installed. If not, why not try and hop on Craigslist, and find some crappy second hand android phone that will work for you needs? (Make sure it will work before you buy it ;) )

Apple stuff won't work if you want freedom.  Which includes freedom to use custom software or do whatever you want.

Lol, people sometimes say to me: "you have an _android?_ " , to which I reply "yes, I'm an adult". They always take offense, which makes my eyes twinkle even harder when I see their cracked screens. Ever throw money in the toilet? I had an ifone4 once. I threw it in the toilet

Edit: I don't know what I'm on about tonight. Opinions are like kittens, I'm just giving them away (-modest mouse)

I still have an iPhone for software testing at work, but I leave it in my desk where it belongs and take my Android home.  When I lost my phone last year, I had to get service turned on and use it for a month and it was the worst month ever.  I don't know how people can even deal with that, much less *want* to overpay for it.

Lol, it's like "give me **ALL** of the pricetag, and _ONLY_ the status symbol (which translates to "I don't know what I'm doing in life") hahaha. I _do_ have friends with apple products, and don't judge them **too** hard about it. However, I DO give them shit about it, and at every possible opportunity. @b264 , the world is ours for parody

I got to witness a real life anti apple commercial play out yesterday. My cousin graduated from UK and we had a big party. Their whole family are appleholes. I watched the girl pose for a picture, the mom's phone ran out of storage on the photo. Girl hands mom her phone. **THAT ONE RUNS OUT OF SPACE AT THE SAME TIME.** I was dying laughing and started a slow chant "android, android, android"

Apple is fine for the normal everyday person. However if you ever want to do anything different or cool forget it. Apple are rich prics that will only let you use their shit. Thatâ€™s why they donâ€™t even sell spare batteries for there phones. Turns out all those spare batteries are aftermarket rebrands

I use the UNITY tool with PARALLELS on my Mac. Not the finest option, but it works. At least with cable.

I also don't like that there is no iOS or Mac Version... that really sucks.

I'm TOTALLY taking that line... ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

I love seeing iPhone addicts piss themselves when I explain how my note 8 camera can blow theirs lit of the water, when I'm not using Snapchat (that's a whole rant in itself. What kind of idiot created the Snapchat Android app. A low res screenshot of the the camera? Wtf?)

If you need any help, i'd be happy to remote into your computer and help you set it up. Assuming you have the correct cable. Your really lucky because everything your using is rock solid and you won't have any issues once it's up and running.
