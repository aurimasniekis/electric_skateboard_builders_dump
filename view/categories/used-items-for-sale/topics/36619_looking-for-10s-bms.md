I have an 80 Amp bestech 10s BMS. Used for about 3 charges. Removed when i had the pack repaired. Neff ever put back in. Would sell cheap. But no balance wires. You'd need an 8 pin and 2pin jst connector to use it.

@willpark16 & @Lionpuncher How much are you asking for those BMS'ss? If @twan doesn't want them or is not interested, I would be. PM me prices, if you'd like. Thanks!
