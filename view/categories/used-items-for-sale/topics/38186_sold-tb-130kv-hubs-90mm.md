I have for sale 2 of these 130kv hub motors. One has around 250 miles the other has less than a mile because the drv chip blew. Both will come with the 4mm to 5.5mm bullet connectors and sensor cable adapters. I will ship the more used one with new urethane installed. 
$150 for the newer one
$120 for the one more used
$260 for both
Price includes shipping to US

Edit: I'll upload pics later today.
