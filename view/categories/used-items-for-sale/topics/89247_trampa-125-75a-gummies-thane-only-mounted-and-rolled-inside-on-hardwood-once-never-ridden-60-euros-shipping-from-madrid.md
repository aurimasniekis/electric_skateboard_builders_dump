Just checked and if your in uk then:

60 euros + 20 euros shipping = 80 euros = Â£69.33

Brand new from Trampa these are Â£17.50 each so a set of 4 is Â£70

Well sir that just happens to now be the price ......so I imagine these are sold. 7ish euros to ship north. I'm in Caceres til Sunday, so if it's alright I will send you my PayPal info then and will ship the wheels out Monday.

Bueno, seÃ±or, ahora el precio es asÃ­ entonces que imagino que se venden.  7 euros para enviar al norte.  Estoy en CÃ¡ceres hasta el domingo, asÃ­ que si estÃ¡ bien, le enviarÃ© mi informaciÃ³n de PayPal en ese momento y enviarÃ© las ruedas el lunes.
