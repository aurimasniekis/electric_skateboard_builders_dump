These are parts that I used for my most recent build. They are all in very good condition as I have not had the board for that long, and have treated it well.

1 set of 100mm MBS All Terrain Wheels - $50

1 set (2 tucks) of Caliber II Longboard Trucks - $30 comes with hardware to mount to the deck

6355 Motor from  (excellent condition) - $75

12s2p battery from  - $300 (comes with case) would prefer to sell with deck that has holes predrilled for the case

1 VESC from  - $85

1 Blank Longboard Deck from customskateboards.com (PREFERABLY WOULD BE SOLD WITH BATTERY CASE BECAUSE HAS HOLES DRILLED TO FIT THE CASE) - $15

Motor Mount from diyelectricskateboard - $40 
(missing 2/4 of the screws to hold the mount onto the trucks, but these can be easily replaced. Also they are not necessary)

This could also be sold as a complete board

Specs: 
30 mph top speed (can be changed through the VESC)
15-18 mile range

I am trying to get rid of a few of my boards, and possibly get an Evolve. Already sold a Meepo.
Its a great board, but I just don't need multiple boards.

This looks like a well built board.  Is the LCD screen in the bottom a battery meter?  It looks like it could easily get damaged there.
