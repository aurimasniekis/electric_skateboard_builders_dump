This is a Slightly used 63mm electric skateboard motor mount. I bought this from torque boards and  . I got this about 2 weeks ago and was really looking to start using it but I need to pay rent payments. Kept for only two weeks since recent purchase in a smoke free home and adult owned. ![14%20PM|369x500](upload://rCq6WJ0ruc2Pbei0MHGstRQJ4jx.jpeg) ![18%20PM|340x500](upload://jd1h1Gmzo7cYtskwQGykfxtBXHF.jpeg) Please message me with any questions about the item.
