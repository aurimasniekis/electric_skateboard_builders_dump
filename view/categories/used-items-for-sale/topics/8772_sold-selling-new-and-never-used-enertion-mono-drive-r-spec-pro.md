Hi,
new and never used kit from Enertionboards - mono drive r-spec pro. Bought it in may 2016. 

http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/enertion-single-motor-mount-pro-kit/
The motor is different, probably because inventory updates or something at Enertion. Check picture below.

I live in Sweden, so I would preferably send it to someone around here. I live in Örebro, and sometimes I visit Stockholm. I could meet you in person if you can come to Örebro, and maybe send it to my mother which could meet you in Stockholm.

**I want 200 USD for it.** 
If you live in Sweden I will pay for the shipping cost $0
Shipping cost to almost whole Europe (I've checked Scandinavia, France, Germany, Netherlands and etc) would be around $45 USD with tracking included.
Shipping cost to US would be around $60-65 USD and no tracking and $80-85 USD with tracking.

If you are interested we can discuss it. 
(I'm selling this since I was unprepared for my moms 60 years birthday and I need to buy a Michael Kors bag for her, she deserves it more than I need this :slight_smile:)

It's the 6355 motor if that's what you're asking

Edit:

Didn't expect someone to sell something from my hometown! I'm interested but hadn't planned on building a board at the moment so I'll have to think it over a bit.

Since there was alot of confusion why Enertion link said 6355 and I the box said 6374 I took some new pictures.
Don't know if Enertion changed out their inventory.

See pictures here:

Aha, then they just used another box. Then the description on the website is correct then!
