I am selling my Unlimited x Loaded Solo kit. I ordered it on Kickstarter a long time ago and got it this summer. By the time I got I, I have already built my own skateboard so I just tested this one and decided to sell it to have more money for future builds. 
https://unlimitedxloaded.com/products/solo#1
The range is around 11km and top speed 40 km/h. I tried it on three different board setups and it's great, versatile and really light - only 2kg. 
Wheels are Caguama with motor liner from the same material. With the board, I have bought an extra liner but this one doesn't show any signs of wear on it. 
Original box available.
Kit is under warranty.
Price is 550 euros, the price of the new one is 850 euros. 
Kit is currently in Lyon.
