Sorry to ask but I am very new to electric anything modification...never mind skateboard/longboards.... So the trucks have wheels and pulley or no? And if say I swapped this truck out and put it on the front of my Yuneec (uniquely slow) ego ...and added 7s battery (which is not included?) would I need the ESC or could I attach this motor to the exisiting one and another battery...so the one controller could effectively command the now 2 motors???

THIS then would give me the actual speed of 12mph.....cossssssss it certainly does not travel at that speed currently...and would it give me more torque and mean it could climb hills or at least slight inclines at a faster rate than a travelator ..........can anyone make these machines things perform better without incurring a cost which may as well leave you ordering a Boosted or similar????...............................................

youÂ´ll always need one esc to one motor. So when youÂ´re using two motors youÂ´re using two escs. If you search this forum a bit youÂ´ll find some threads about if its possible to tune an Ego and if itÂ´s economical or not.

Great thanks! So did it work...re pictures in above post? ...That is exatcly what I was thinking! Do you need two remotes though? if not how do you get your original remote to talk to both ESC's?
