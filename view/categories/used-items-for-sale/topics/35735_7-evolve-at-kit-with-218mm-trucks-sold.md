As the title says it’s a set of four 7” Evolve AT wheels and pulleys. I have mounted these on a set of Torque Board 218mm trucks and the rear truck has been lathed 10mm to accept the hubs and pulleys. This setup has about 15 miles of use on it and I spent $300 putting it together. If anyone is interested I also have a pair of Torque Board Extended Motor Mounts I used with this setup for sale as well for $100 for the pair.

couple questions, only because evolve's site doesn't have it.

what is the width of the wheel pulley? 9, 12, or 15mm?

are the belts 5mm pitch?

are belts included?  if so, what's the length / diameter?

I'm not OP but 15mm wide, 5mm pitch is correct

I wish I saw this before I bought an AT kit last week for the wheels and hubs :stuck_out_tongue:

They are 15mm on 5m pitch. I have a few different belt sizes and can throw them in if you want them.
