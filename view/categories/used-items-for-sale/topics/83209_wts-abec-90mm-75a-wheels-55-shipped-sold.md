I'm located in California and will ship to continental US at the prices given.

Basically new 90mm ABEC 75a wheels - SOLD

basically new - I mounted pulleys and rode around my room (non electrified). There is dirt from the pulleys, and a very thin layer of the core was shaved on 2 of the wheels from inserting these on a metasurf drive - $55

If he wants it! I do recommend he reads the description, as there are cosmetic issues as it was my first real build
