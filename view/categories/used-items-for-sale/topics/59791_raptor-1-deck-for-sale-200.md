Not the most comfortable deck, but excellent for high speed runs. Surprisingly durable too.

If someone is willing to pay $270 I might sell one of mine too! I‚Äôve been thinking about that 4wd CarvOn more and more which means the Raptor CavOn V4‚Äôs deck needs to go

I think the deck by itself was $400. Plus it was kinda a small run so considered ‚Äúrare‚Äù?

You seriously need to make an add-on enclosure for the Raptor 1 that mounts to the bottom, we just need to drill an XT connector hole and like 6 mounting holes. Can you image us adding an additional flat pack?! Easily fit a 10s4p so it would be 10s7p!
