[/quote]

You don't need to calibrate the remote so Maybe that's what ur talking about.
but you still need to set up In the vesc settings like you do with all remotes,
You also Have to put the bind key inside to get it paired but it's super simple,

@Zertax that's a great deal.
It's 13 from bangood and 12 for normal speed shipping so, 25.
And I don't know if that includes the receiver

Last Time I got a remote from china I waited 2 months gave up bought a used remote from Spain so it would come faster, and then 2 weeks later my Chinese remote came.
