Alrighty kids, I'm selling all my Trampa stuff. These parts served me well I just have no use for them anymore. 

I'd prefer to sell this as one lot but we'll see.
 
Up for sale is...

* 4x matte black and red superstar hubs. 

* 1 set of very used Urban Treads tires. They still have tread on them for another couple hundred miles. I just missed the perfect time to rotate them.

* 8x tubes for the Urban treads. The 4 inside the tire have never had a pop or leak.

* 5x Trampa Gummies in 75A,  I legit put one mile on these before my board took a shit and never used them since. One of them has a bubble on it from the factory 2nd wheel from left. The one without a hub has never been ridden and is new.

* 2x  Trampa 62T gears for the Urban Treads

* 2x 44T Trampa gears for the Gummies (I put a mile on these)

* 2x 66T Boardbumper gears, (I used to use evolve trucks)

* 4x Boardbumper Trampa adapters (already installed with set of reds)

* 4x orginal Trampa spacers for the hubs in case you don't need the boardbumper adapters.

* All the original screws

I'll sell all for $350, shipped next business day via FedEx ground from Philadelphia, PA.

I'd be interested in the Urban treads and tubes if you end up separating the lot.
