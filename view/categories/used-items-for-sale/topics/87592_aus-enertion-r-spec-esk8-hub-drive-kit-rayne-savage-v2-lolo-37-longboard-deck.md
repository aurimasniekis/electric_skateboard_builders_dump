I am curious though as to the change in plans.  Only because I am the most fluid builder here.  They start they change they go somewhere else.  Oh and I am in a flux regarding what to do next so I am shamelessly trolling for ideas.  sue me.

After brexit us Australians might be able to use some monopoly money to transact with you if you like? :stuck_out_tongue:

Not bad prices there :). Just FYI though [Concrete Lines](https://www.concretelines.com.au/) really does the price of that deck to about $240 AUD in their seemingly once per month 20% off sale.

Never seen it at that price at Concrete Lines myself but yeah if they do 'once a month' then good on them. Currently on special @ $310. I bought it from them when it wasn't on special at & $360 and paid $20 postage. Still a decent discount as it is brand new.
