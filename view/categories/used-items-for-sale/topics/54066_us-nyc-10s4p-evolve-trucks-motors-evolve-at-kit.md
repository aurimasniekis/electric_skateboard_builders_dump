Hello, I started this build about 3-4 months ago but i fell off my boosted in the winter when i got caught in an expansion joint and fractured my arm. I don't have full range of movement in my arm still and as much as i like riding, I think i'm going to give it up for a while, or at least feel it out. All these parts are close to new, the battery pack has literally 1 charge and i've briefly setup the the FOCBoxes to ensure that they work,

Evolve front and rear trucks with motor mounts $100

Evolve AT kit $150

Racerstar 140kv, wired for FOCBoxes  40 ea

Enertion nano X: $50

FOCBOX $100/ea, I have 2 of them

ChiBoards 10s4p 25r with on/off switch, BMS, vedder anti-spark, battery gauge and charger $350

Misc. stuff.
Psychotiller signature enclosure
Arbor Dropcruiser 39” deck, the back of it is shaved for motor clearance and there's a bunch of holes drilled into it for the enclosure, if you take all of it, i'll throw this in for free, i'll have no use for it anymore.

I'd prefer not to ship, especially the battery.

i think the battery is my biggest hangup in shipping, that and NYC post offices are horrible and crowded.
