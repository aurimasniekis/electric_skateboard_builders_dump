If anybody wants a $2000+ pre-built board, this is **THE** deal for you.

I can't imagine if I saw this pop up before I started building, I would have bought it immediately having all the knowledge I have now. This is a pristine build with top notch components for a shockingly low price. 

I'm so sad to see it go man :cry: 

Best of luck

Dude, that's both rad (the board) and sad (needing to sell). I wish I was in a financial position to buy it from you, and hold (ride) it for you until you could buy it back.

I was thinking the same. I've already spent half that in this hobby and my board isn't even close to this, lol

For real... the amount of parts I bought that weren't compatible that I just have sitting around is embarrassing :expressionless: 

This will get snatched up quick if someone is smart.
