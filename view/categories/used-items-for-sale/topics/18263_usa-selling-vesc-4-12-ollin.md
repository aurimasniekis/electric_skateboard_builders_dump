Hello everyone! 
I am selling my stuff since I am not riding it anymore (_rains/snows all the time and I am finishing college_).

(USA Only) (**Video bottom of this post**)

----------

1. [VESC 4.12 from Ollin Board](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller)
Purchased: $170
Selling: $130 + free shipping
**Details:** 
> Motor Wires: 4mm Bullet
Battery Wires: 5.5mm Bullet + with Anti-Spark
Kept safe & clean (besides the wires) the entire time I have been riding. Since it costed $170!!
Selling it for so cheap compared to other people here since I've used this a lot _(0.5 mile trips from car to class and back for 1 college semester, so say 30 days, 0.5 mile a day)_

OllinBoard provides 2 year warranty and I bought this June 23rd 2016. So about 15 months left.

----------

I am not selling [this Motor mount](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-only/) for 2 reasons.

1. The Motor mount had a crack in it but I fixed it with epoxy, but still I would not risk riding with it.

1. The clamp/motor mount is heavily epoxied and removing it would just damage the mount more. When I was assembling it I had to make sure the mount would not move.

----------
I am selling the [Drive Wheel Pulley/Motor Pulley](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/36t-abec-drive-pulley-belt-combo-kit/) from diyelectricskateboard for $30 [Free shipping (USA only)]. It is 36T/16T.

I'm out.  Shipping + Parts + Labor makes it a bit too high for me.  I would have to change out all the connections.

Yea I agree, it's a bit high for me. I'm in Canada so idk if you'd even ship for free.

The pricing is VESC ($120) + Shipping ($10) = $130.

Canada is a lot for shipping so yea can't ship there for free.

If anyone else is interested then give me an offer and we can negotiate. I don't want this laying around when I know someone can be wanting/using it!
