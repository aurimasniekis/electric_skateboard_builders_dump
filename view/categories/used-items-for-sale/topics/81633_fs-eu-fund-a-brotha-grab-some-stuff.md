**Dear fellas** ! 

I've been moving between cities **a lot** lately, like ***a shitload lot*** and end of the year happened to be damn expensive.

I have to focus on my main ongoing projects - @moon got a taste on what's going on behind the scenes :beers: thanks again for your help bro - but "Pele demands a Sacrifice".

So I'm parting out with little extra I have in reserve. Listed VESCs are one-off & I'll provide ported Ackmaniac's FW files with it should you wish to FOC and wattmode.

Updated the list! 

Following listing is as follow : Price + shipping to your location (I'm based in EU, France). 

- New unused VESC LM5109 based, made by Roger Wolff (BitWizard.nl & "rew" on Vedder's forum), 2.18 FW + a pair of 5v regulators - PCBs headers needs to be plugged **55‚Ç¨**

> LM5109 gate driver replaces the DRV8302 and is a  **100v**  chip. On my VESCs there are 3x stacked cause DRV is one chip integrated with 3 phases, here there‚Äôs one LM5109 per phase.
>
>
>
> Also the FETs board has them irfs7530 stacked together on a single face (√† la Ollin VESC) of a separate PCB, meaning you can simply slap an heatsink on the back of PCB and keep them cool easy.
>
>In summary : you can‚Äôt overvoltage fail them at 12S or 13S and you can put a nice big ass heatsink on the back to run a steady temp. I didn‚Äôt try max amps yet.

- Lightly used VESC LM5109 based, but I messed up the USB port (most probably needs a STM link debug) and cables soldering is ugly (thin phases were for testing on bench) ; 3.100 ACk FW - **25‚Ç¨**

- New unused BMS 10s 40A (eBay model so don't push it) - **13‚Ç¨**

- Two New unused Htd belts 265-9 5M - **5‚Ç¨/part**

I need to check then I can update the length for you but IIRC it is 6374? Maybe shorter, not sure.

I am pretty sure they are 6374. They're too smal to be 6384's and too big to be 6355.
Those are the APS 6355's and my annoying cat ,he always need to be on thr pictures...

@mikedv Thanks for the pic, yea these look definitely shorter than mines ! So must be standard 6374 (and your caat looks gorgeous, no wonder he photobombs like a champ) :smile:

@mutantbass Well I didn't dare putting more random stuff here _yet_ haha

Edit : Updated with new parts!

It is the Diyeboard / Meepo style 90mm hub ; @Anubis it is indeed the replaceable PU with hexa screws cover, new pu set costs like 10‚Ç¨ IIRC ; I was planning a full refurb (pu + metal raw polished) and still hesitating to sell the hubs and trucks (as you see the board was sitting  to be finished)! I'll post another pic. 

More torquey on low speed than MAD hubs for start and hills but less cruise / top speed too.

@Anubis Just checked your sale thread, if I decide to keep my hubs do you still have spare PU sleeves in stock ? I'd eventually take a pair.

The RT has seriously been underhanded by Microsoft, for taking notes in class mainly it is ok but OS is very locked. It has potential to run Windows 10 and Android flawlessly but well, it is stuck to RT (only insiders have unlocked tablets).

"It's not about the board... It's the rider!" _Sean IRL after crashing his Monte Carlo in few houses and losing driver's license_

The AS is reserved, one of the motors might go too.

BTW I figured you don't have a clue yet about LM5109 based VESCs? 

> LM5109 gate driver replaces the DRV8302 and is a **100v** chip. On my VESCs there are 3x stacked cause DRV is one chip integrated with 3 phases, here there's one LM5109 per phase.
> 
> Also the FETs board has them irfs7530 stacked together on a single face (√† la Ollin VESC) of a separate PCB, meaning you can simply slap an heatsink on the back of PCB and keep them cool easy.

In summary : you can't overvoltage fail them at 12S or 13S and you can put a nice big ass heatsink on the back to run a steady temp. I didn't try max amps yet. 

Ah, I forgot : official name was BESC (BitWizard ESC) cause trademark ‚Ñ¢ üôÑüòè

Show them some love guys, & I'll provide help on every data I know / tried about them :v:

It is difficult for me for multiple reasons, please consider : 
- I make no profit from any of the parts listed cause either put buying price or lower than buying price, except motors which are a gift ; 2x LM VESCs cost me 150‚Ç¨+ shipping approx back then.

- If you're knowloedgeable in electronics you can service it easily (you only need to work components on top face for both PCBs and there are Reboot and DFU buttons). 

- Used one has never been on the road, only on bench (hence the thin phase wires) and max amps I ran through was 5-6amps from PSU.

- I'll be reinjecting all of the sale funds straight into projects too (which include a sick ultra compact & workable solderless module for the DIY community :sunglasses: confident it can tackle any of previous ones I've met, be it NESE or VRUZEND or else -and I'm not saying these are bad by any means !) 

Note that it is not a standard 4.8 or 4.10 or 4.12 VESC ; due to me sucking at proper soldering and being clumsy, I ended up with USB not detected but LEDs are steady green (no bliking or red blink triggered). Maybe just plugging it on another computer will result in USB is not broken, I didn't try that.

I'd gladly lower price but trying my best to fund main projects :sweat_smile:

Well what are you building, do you have a build topic ? 

Depending on your setup and budget (and your skills) I may even advise you to get the brand new VESC if it is a good brand.

I'm confident you can manage a great build with mines but it will require tinkering and probably a repair before being put on road. If you prefer a "keyturn" solution, the other one is better. If you're ready to get your hands under the hood, that's something else :wink:

Ok your best bet for this price is something like : 
-10S max (2x5S Turnigy batteries for example, graphene are great but expensive) 
-one motor drive, try 6374 if possible
-one @dickyho mount
-one VESC
-a GT2B or Mini remote + receiver 
-a 10s charger
-an eBay BMS (it happens I sell one lol)

And you still need all the rest (xt90 connectors, cables, bullets, JST for receivers, a battery indicator or BT HM10 module, an enclosure, vibration dampening pad, a deck, flywheels or kegel, pulleys, belts, Paris or Cal trucks...)
