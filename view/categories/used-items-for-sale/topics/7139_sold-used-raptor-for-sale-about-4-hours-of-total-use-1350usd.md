Purchased this board in November, used it about 4 hours, and it has been sitting in my room ever since. I wanted the most powerful board with the longest range, and I got it! I live about 5 miles from work and thought I would make the daily commute with the board, but I just have not done so beyond 3 times. I have the upgraded, larger wheels, and the new battery cover which prevents the signal dropouts. I've charged the battery twice. 

I live in Redwood City, near San Francisco, California. I would prefer to do a local transaction. I paid about $1600 with four extra belts and the tuning wrench, putting this up for sale for $1400. I also have the USA charging adapter I will throw in. Serious inquiries only please, reach out to jes   terf  uj   at G   ma     il   .com    For buyers out of the area, I will probably ask for OnLoop's / Jason's help to hold the money in escrow or something like that.

I think you mean GF lid. The one with 100% CF was the one with bad signal.

Oh yea, GF lid you are correct. The 100% carbon was the one that cut out initially. Jason mailed the new one to me thx.

bought it to commute to work, but 10 mins in car vs 30mins on board... too long. I also thought I'd take it for rides around the neighborhood which I don't.

Yes, dual drive! 
Good idea about reddit, I wanted to post here first to see if anyone wanted it before I hit craigslist and reddit. 
Here are pics.

@jesterfuj If you brought it on presale you probably didnt lose out at all for that price.  I think you did well
