Overall good condition. There are a few spots in the clear coat that could be refinished or covered with grip tape. There are some scratches on the bottom but no cracks. The nose has a few scuffs as pictured.

Asking $350 shipped, it’s $750 from Evolve

If you have focboxes, the heatsink in this thread is perfect for this setup. 

P.S. Also have two focboxes available
