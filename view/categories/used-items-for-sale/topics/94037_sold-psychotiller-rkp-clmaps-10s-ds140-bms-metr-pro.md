Selling a bunch of items because I'm not going to use them any time soon. 

**Never used Psychotiller press fit Surf Rodz rkp mounts. **
I mounted one side once, but never rode these. **(sold** bought originally for $195 I think.

**Metr pro,** **(sold)** going to buy a unity metr so don't need this.

**DaveGA with screens and @lrdesigns resin case** (pics coming soon) but it is brand new unopened. One davega is assembled and one is a kit. I have two screens I can include with this so you don't have to wait on it from China. Everything mentioned above **(Sold)**
I need the foot space on my builds so I can't use it so might as well sell it.

And a bestech ds140 10s bms. **(sold)**
