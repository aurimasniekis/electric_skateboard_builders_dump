Here's the truncated I built with a thicker enclosure. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-truncated-tesseract-calibers-popocas-6355s-focbox-5x-2s-graphene-lipos-10s-custom-fibreglass-enclosure/40933
The one in the photo above is unfinished, I made this one with a slimmer enclosure and then painted it.
Fairly simple with a bit of patience and masking tape.
The enclosures fit both the tesseract and the Truncated Tesseract.
Here's my instagram page.

Great boards, someone buy it.

If ya could give me a price on that, that'd be awesome.

Depending how much shipping costs it might not be worth it.  I can order a board only for 260$ cad plus tax. But definitely interested!

Hey sorry it didn't pan out. Just ended up being about the same price to buy from a store locally.

Good luck on your sale!
