Besides the batteries and deck, most can fit into one or two large flat rate box from USPS. And sell the deck and batteries separate unless buyer wanted to pay shipping.

the fact you want to sell everything and only have it picked up in socal is very particular and will make the sale difficult. I'd take the 107s.... to Sydney Australia

Understandable. 
But you're drastically limiting potential buyers. 
Maybe make people make $100 minimum purchases so they have to buy multiple things rather than the entire thing?
