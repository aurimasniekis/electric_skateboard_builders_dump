Hello I live in Norway and its soon wintertime, so I really need a car instead of my electric skateboard. Its used 5 times, so its like brand new. the setup is this:

10s lipo 5500mah
DIY 230kv brushless motor
DIY VESC
DIY mounting kit
Mini remote controller
The board it selfs looks like a boosted.
The covers for the battery and vesc is also bought at DIY
I dont know about the price, but I am selling to the best offer. Not selling it below 1050 dollars.

I will post pictures when I get home from school. I also dont know what to do with shipping, The buyer will pay, but havent researched the price for this yet.

If you are talking USD than I think it should be a little more. I would say near $1000 is fair. (I didn't gather prices for everything so I don't know how much you spent)

You would be better off selling the parts and just keeping the deck. I would give it a day to see if there are any offers on the whole board and then just sell off the parts, more people will be interested.

Not with that price. You can make new dual with that money or buy new raptor 2. 
Someone might buy it with half or even lower than half of that price.

Is it a custom LiPo?
If you're willing to sell it as parts I might be interested in the enclosures.
