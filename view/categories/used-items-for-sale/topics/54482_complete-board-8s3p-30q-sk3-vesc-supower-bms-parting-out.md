**_I part out now!_**

Hi, I started ordering part half a year ago as a noob and all things came at different times and some broke etc etc. ex I got my remote 2 week ago. So the board itself is in good fkn condition imo. 

But now I know much more and I want to finance a build before the summer so I have to sell this quick.

Perfect for a beginner that want a complete set! 

Here are specs

**Oxelo fishtail** 73cm long and 21 wide ( best cruiser board ever imo) 

**Caliberstyle trucks**, silver painted black

**flywheels style 83 mm**

**Motor mount** by forum member that went shit. But the mount is pretty damn good, enertion style CF mount 

**36/15 black** anodized aluminum and steel pulleys, 15 mm wide by a reputable forum member, can't remember namne sorry haha.

**Custom glasfiber** boosted style enclosure by @DjamboBuksne 

**Sk3 6364 213kv** 

**Maytech vesc** It works in bldc no problem but don't do foc please

**Antispark** by @goldenHusky btw he is amazing, its his old design not the new ones but still works no problem. 

**Bms** from supower 60A, Good reputation and quality, works perfectly

**Charger,** laptop style black 2a charger

**Benchwheel** remote, it is good and reliable and work perfectly. 

Lastly a **dubbelstacked 8s3p liion pack** of samsung 30Q. Genuin and spot welded with triple nickel. Secured and wrapped. balancewirers comes out and then to bms.


there you have it, it is a top beginners build.

**I am in EU** 

**You pay shipping**

**Pay goods and service to avid conflicts** 

**I ship only after payment** 

and yeah price is **500 euros** which is cheaper than I paid obviously

**_Please don't be cocky behind a screen complaining about pricing, it is not for you then_**


I will maybe part out inte a mechanical kit  ( Deck, wheel, truck, mount, motor, pulley, enclosure) for **240** euros

and electronics kit ( vesc, antispark, bms, charger, battery) for **285** euros
Remote will be given free to the first buyer 

**Send a pm if you want a specific part so I can see if I will be able to sell everything!**

Price can be discussed

Mods plus @GrecoMan let me know if I have forgotten something! and have a nice day all builders :grin:

Looks nice. I like that they include sticker with battery info. Also nice that u know number of nickel layers your battery has. 

I assume as that was somewhat special order u were able to specify such details / conditions for making this pack
