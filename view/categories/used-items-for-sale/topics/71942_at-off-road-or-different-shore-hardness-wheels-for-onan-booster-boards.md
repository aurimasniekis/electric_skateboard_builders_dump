Hey, I'm making some aftermarket wheels for my ONAN boosterX2 and thought someone else might be interested in buying some.

I'm modelling them after the MBS A/T wheels - will be using a TPU filament from Polymaker and printing them. I have a couple of designs. But I think 100mm will not affect the torque and top speed too much but will make for a more comfortable ride. 

I will be printing with 90-95A filament - but will use about 20-30% infill with 4-8 perimeters to create a softer yet durable wheel. It has taken a lot of effort and research to get to this stage and figured there must be someone else out there who would want more wheel options for HUB motor boards.

Will be interesting to see how they hold up

Printed TPU won't hold up for long I'm afraid,
 did this some time ago. ATM I'm doing some pu casting with the same goal (MBS wheel for hubs), I'll post a short tutorial/build log soon :)
You should try it anyway, maybe you're lucky.

I have already done a PLA print but they were too hard. I'm after a more shock absorbing finish, as I'll be using them on very rough, but still road/concrete terrain. 

What print settings did you have - re: infill and perimeters?

I printed them with 100% infill and only one perimeter since they tended to get loose layerwise. The infill actually lasted much longer.

100% infill!! and they didn't last long? What kind of life did you get from them?

They're a bit thinner than I was planning to make

What about buying some mbs wheels and making an adapter to turn the hubs into a direct drive like @Martin

Looks good, did you try it yet?
Edit: take care that your infill pattern has the same stabilityin every position ;)

No yet, this is the PLA print to make sure the size is correct.

What kind of infill would you suggest?

I did consider this (mounting the MBS wheels) , but it seemed more difficult and created additional fail points. I was also worried about the axle length of the trucks.

This video about the infill bouncyness problem. I would suggest something where the pattern direction is always directed towards the ground, similar to the video:

As I already said, the TPU wears off pretty fast, when you do a thicker version it will hold longer but nowhere near a molded PU.

This was my first try to get some feeling for the process. I'm currently waiting for new molding silicone and I'm pretty optimistic it will work almost perfectly if not absolutely perfectly :D

@Richter This is how the impact will be handled differently.

:smiley: Mine are for landwheel only (But the basic technique can be used for every system available) and if I apply my normal hourly rate it would be way too expensive :D I'll do a tutorial so everyone can do it, but first I have to test the strength of these (Due to the long curing times I have to wait until next week for results ;) )

First wait for my final result, after that I have enough experience to tell if I can do it or if it is at all a good solution :)
edit: Have you tried my old hubs yet?

Most of the infill patterns are preset - I could use hexagons for a more uniform finish. Or I could try and design my own. I was thinking normal wheel spokes (obviously just a small section of them) with a common center point with angled struts between might work well.   Kind like this    \I/   repeated in height and all angled towards the centre.

I can tell you in a week. :) curing for the pu is 48h so I need 4 days alone for that ;)

Do u by chance plan on sharing or uploading the stl files to thingiverse? I am having the hardest time finding wheels for the onan x2 and don't have a caliper handy, other wise i would just design my own. Thanks!
