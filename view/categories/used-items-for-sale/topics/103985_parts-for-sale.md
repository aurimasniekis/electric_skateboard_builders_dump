I have a slightly used focbox unity, used psychotiller six shooters with extra full set of tires (only 3 extra tubes though), a BEAUTIFUL HAYA deck, new 10s bestech d140, new TB 218s, and motors plus motor mounts from dickyho, also a bluetooth module from BKB![15741061890532145167946279474030|375x500](upload://vuOm8O5DkNqbkenrp8A17ey8BaE.jpeg) ![15741062886208675584133408671155|375x500](upload://mmL1jgvkn6PeYLWVUJ4ndR5s5qU.jpeg) ![15741063213601157440179940530506|375x500](upload://pxAjpzsoopILNeI33wOxOKdRokO.jpeg) ![15741063833078838942652051731041|375x500](upload://aQnh5LJ0QP0hEW4unsgpxjIjq4b.jpeg) ![15741065063352374374612969963165|375x500](upload://3FTnJtSFH5CP4V8tN1dJlHvllQR.jpeg) . I'm cleaning out because I dont really ride much anymore sadly, I only see myself using my AT. Make me some offers, not looking to price gouge seeing how I'm looking to off this stuff. The haya has neoprene laid into the enclosure but the board has never been ridden.

Depending on the first people who responded. The shooters have a buyer, and same with unity, I'll let you guys know if that changes, possibly a buyer for haya. Please just PM me, I'll check more frequently now. My day off
