I have a skateboard i built of a basic plywood longboard deck. Running 6s 8000mah setup, 2 cells are weak and dying soon, I have not used the board much at all, but once i went below the recommended minimum and caused the two cells to die. they had higher resistance from day 1 anyway , no idea why.![10%20PM(1)|666x500](upload://rCdF5ht6PMQ7uPJXyaTtZjlkVk7.jpeg) ![10%20PM|666x500](upload://q7vbjnjMZombeCi0QEBgfayKabU.jpeg) 

NOTE: Looking to sell locally as shipping is expensive. I live in United Arab Emirates :slight_smile: 

Currently, I have attached a front handlebar and wheel mechanism of a micro kickboard, to be safe when i drive it. 
I would like to sell it as a whole, but willing to part out

Its pretty tough. My build in progress has an enclosure almost identically shaped. I have spent probably 18hrs getting to to a super glossy perfect finish. Most people have no clue how hard it is to work with without a mold.

yeah i remember, placing tape over a food container for a mold, then placing it on the board to get the curve.

Next time, try and find something like a food storage container where the inside dimensions are nice. Then take the top and trace it on carboard and cut it out. Glue the cardboard on like the brim of a hat and that will be the skirt your enclosure is mounted by. Then fiberglass small strips of mat glass in over about 2 days.

The results are alot better and easier to finish. I just wish my most recent enclosure would have worked like that. I could find a container i liked.

Just make sure to add mold release. I cheap way to make some is to melt candle wax and grease of some sort together and then its soft and easy to rub a very thin film onto your mold.

Alternatively, mold one out of clay if you are confident in your abilites. Clay makes great molds.
