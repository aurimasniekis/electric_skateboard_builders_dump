Hey everyone! I've been making decals for a while and since I just started digging into electric longboards I figured I'd offer my services here.

I can make custom vinyl decals up to 24" wide and some crazy lengths (in other words, big enough for an entire board if you want, or just a smaller decal to stick somewhere). I have been thinking about some decal designs for my board but it's already got a graphic and I don't want to ruin it :stuck_out_tongue:

If anyone wants to see some of my work or request a mock-up of something, just comment here - you can PM me if it's something top-secret but if you just comment I can show the mockup to others so they can see what kind of decals I can make. I can also make "reverse" decals to be used for painting templates!

My online store is www.adamsvinyl.com - I mostly just sell small water bottle decals and wall decals there, but I do custom designs pretty often with company logos and other cool stuff. Hit me up if you're interested!

_NOTE: If this isn't allowed someone please tell me and I'll remove it!_
