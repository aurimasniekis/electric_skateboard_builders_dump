I was going to build this board to bring to college but I need the money elsewhere so I never finished.  Spent about $200 on everything.  Leaving soon so all of this must go.  $120 shipped.  PM me for questions, more pictures, offers, etc.  Include your city or zip code so I can calculate shipping.  Thank you! :grin:

I'm building my first board, if this sits long enough to reach $100 shipped my PayPal will be on it way.  Looking to buy items but I'd take advantage of a deal as I was looking to go VESC.
