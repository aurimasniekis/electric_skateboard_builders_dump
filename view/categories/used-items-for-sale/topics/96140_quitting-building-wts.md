The $40 - $50 figure I gave you before was from FedEx. Perhaps you are right it maybe cheaper with UPS. The USPS definitely wont carry batts. Freaks them out.

You can use usps flat rate boxes for batteries. That's how I send mine out. Fedex is too expensive and slower.

Yeah, but this is not a normal batt and we need to split them in six in order to send it. That makes it difficult.

A sales platform twice as good would be twice as good.

But to answer your question to the best of my capabilities (without spamming too much) a sales platform that is


1.0000000000000000001 times better would be 1.0000000000000000001 times better. you get the picture.

Actually your wrong, the answer is 2 sale platforms

The second part is based on the first part,

A sales platform with 100  users is probably better than 2 sales platforms with 20 each.
