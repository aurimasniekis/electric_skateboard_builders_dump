Disassembled my old street board and got some parts to sell!

Used SK3 192kv with 5.5mm connectors and shaft with some flat spots (used to attach grubs from pulley).
Still works perfectly, never rode in wet conditions.

If you’re interested and you live somewhere in Europe let me know and she is yours! I’m located in Utrecht, the Netherlands, pickup or shipping, your choice.

Price: €40,- excl. shipping.

How many miles it has or how long did you use it?

No idea how many miles. Only added the bluetooth module pretty recently. Bought it in november 2016. Used it on the sunny days and full summer of '17.
