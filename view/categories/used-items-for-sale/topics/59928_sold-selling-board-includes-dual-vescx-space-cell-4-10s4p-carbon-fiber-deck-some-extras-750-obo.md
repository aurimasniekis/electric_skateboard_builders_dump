Selling my board, electronics all in perfect working condition.  I overtightened some of the elevator bolts on the motor mounts and they cracked, so it needs new ones.  I tried a couple local parts stores and they kept ordering the wrong sizes.  I'm going to order a Raptor 2.1 after this sells.  The board specs: SPACE Cell 4 (10S4P), dual Raptor 1 motors, dual VESCX, Hifiber carbon fiber deck, Raptor remote.. top speed around 27-28 mph.  Extra parts included: 1 extra enertion remote, 1 extra receiver, 1 extra 2.4 ghz remote, extra belts, extra VESCX *this additional vesc kept giving me an "ABS_OVER_CURRENT" error so I think the extra included vesc is defective. Let me know if you guys have any questions about the board, or if you have a link to order new bolts for the motor mounts so I could fix it before it sells. You can call or text me if you have any questions about the set up: 407-504-1221  -Ian

I know you don't want to part out, but if you do, LMK what you want for those motors!

If I can't sell everything together, then I'll definitely consider parting it out.  :)
