GTX AT for sale bought one year ago january 2018.It has a few scratches on it two remotes r1 & r2 works fine, both board and remotes.$1000 plus shipping have all the origional packaging.

This was my 1st electric skateboard and i love the turning radius really an awesome board I rotate between this and a custom trampa moutainboard.But I need money to add things to my trampa just looking to see if anyone will buy at this resale point.
