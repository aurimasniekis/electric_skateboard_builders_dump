I am selling an electric skateboard I custom built in 2017.
The skateboard works and comes with an extra VESC and set of green wheels.
I barely used it because the range we had a kid so I have no time.

Either way this is a great setup for bodega runs and the battery could be replaced to get better range.
but all the parts are still good and everything works!

**Battery: diyelectricskateboard LiFePO4 12s1p**

**VESC: Dual Ollin 4.12 Vescs (+1 extra from diyelectricskateboard)**

**Motors: Dual Hub Carvon v2.5 motors with carbon fiber hubcaps**
(comes with extra set of wheels)

**Transmitor: FlySky FS-GT2B 2.4GHz 3-Channel Transmitter**
modded with https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3363820

**Deck: Arbor Rally Skateboard Deck**

I can also include a small box of extra parts I purchased during the build.

Looking to sell everything asap for **$600 OBO**

**NYC pickup only** not going to try to mail this thing.

This thing reads like a @b264 build. Hopefully the insides are as nicely lain out as they should be! :) 

This should sell fast, if not simply for the carvons. Werent the 2.5s really nice?

It was modeled after @RunPlayBack 's builds.
I added a few more photos of the insides.
Also the Carvon 2.5s are very nice and have a ton torque. I weigh 185 and I was getting speedwobbles uphill.

Wow, this looks really, really nice.  You should list this on the new builder forum.  This does look like something [b264](https://bitlylink.com/m5YYY) would build.
