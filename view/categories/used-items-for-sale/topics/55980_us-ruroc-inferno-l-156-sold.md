I ordered this helmet during the sale but after using it once, I decided I do not like it (glasses get in the way). I am currently selling it for $156. I have the inferno goggles, goggles bag, helmet in a large size, and a helmet bag. Please let me know if any additional pictures are desired.

Great deal. 
Still in your hands?

I got the Titan and same size including clear and orange lens. Got the orange lens for free because their mount doesnâ€™t hold a gopro without using a socket wrench screwdriver.

I dunno. Never touched the orange. Iâ€™ve used the clear on cloudy days and evenings. 
Was planning to use the orange for snowboarding. 

Since using the tsg pro carbon I havenâ€™t used the ruroc at all. 

Maybe, whatcha have in mind?
