Hello, 

I have a set of four Orangatang Kegels, they are not used a lot, barely visible. All of them still have that shiny finish on the part that is in contact with ground. They still have 1 year and 8 months of warranty to go, I can give you the receipt for that. My asking price is 50euros, bought them for 67.5 and after 10-15km of riding I think that is reasonable. I can ship them to you worldwide for under 10 euros or USD its almost the same. Reason for selling is that I no longer have a use for them, I can include cast pulley HTD 5m 36 tooth that fits perfectly for free othervise it will end up in thrash :smiley: 

For more info PM me or ask down below. :)
