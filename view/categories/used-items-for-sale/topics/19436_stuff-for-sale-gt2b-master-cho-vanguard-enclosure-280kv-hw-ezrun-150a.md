This stuff has been sitting around for a couple of months so I figured I'd see if anyone wants it.  Make an offer if you like something.  Shipping is usually $8 in the US for anything of this size.  If you want multiple items I will combine shipping.  

I'm not trying to make anything on this stuff, just trying to find it a home and to keep from throwing it in a box....casue I need more crap in boxes right :slight_smile:. 


**[Vanguard Enclosure - $20 + Shipping](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/meb-electric-vanguard-loaded-vanguard-carvon-v2-single-hub-motor-6s-flier-esc/2952)**
I had this printed a few months ago, just to see if I liked it.  I ended up going with a different board, and am not a fan of split enclosures unless its necessary.  I paid $25 to have it printed, plus shipping.

$100 takes it all, just trying to get rif of this stuff before it gets packed away or donated.  Make an offer if you see something you want.
