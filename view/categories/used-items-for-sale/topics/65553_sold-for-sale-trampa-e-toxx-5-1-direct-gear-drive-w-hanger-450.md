As much as it pains me to part ways with my favorite gear drive, I must sell my E-Toxx 5:1 in order to make room for other drive systems. 

For sale here is a E-Toxx 5:1 "direct" (gear) drive with its original CNCed hanger by @Nowind. The 8mm motor spurs and wheel gears are unused, meaning there is 0 miles on them because I brought a brand new set of wheel gears few weeks ago from @Nowind but never replace them. The 8mm motor spur gears was also unused because I was using the 10mm spur gears for my 8085 motors. Regardless, my loss, your gain. So in a sense, you're practically getting a "new" drive system.

As a bonus, i'm also including a set of 80xx mm adaptors and 10mm bore spur gears if you ever want to upgrade to a bigger motor from 63xxmm motors. All the smaller parts, such as kingpin bushing, nuts, washers and etc, I've replaced. Whatever I can't replace, i've already wash and rinsed twice.

Please DM for offer.
