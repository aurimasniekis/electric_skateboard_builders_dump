Hey guys. Looking to sell This weekend only. I need to get rid of these items ASAP. My fiance finally caught on to my insane esk8 addiction and found my extra parts stash. So unfortunately I'm cleaning out house. I'll probably be adding more to this short list in the next day or so. Thanks for looking!!!

Here's what I have so far:
I will sell this whole package for $450 shipped

**2 NEW Ollin VESC's with heat sink package** _$150 a piece or $280.00 for the pair shipped in the US only_ 
These are brand new. I purchased one from here that was new (still has 1 year left on warranty). And the other I purchased from Ollin directly (2 year warranty). I literally had them on a board, bldc_tool'd it, and was ready to go. But I broke my collar bone the day before on my other esk8. :(

**1 Enertion Space Cell 10S3P** _$220 (not sure about shipping. I've never shipped a battery before.)_
This was a spare raptor battery that I purchased after I got my Raptor 1. I've only used it maybe 2 hours. There are marks on the heat shrink from the lid of the Raptor (see picture).

Not sure if those are a better buy considering the high quality that Ollin vescs are known for. They also have warranties. So I would say nope. Not a better deal.

It would cost me too much to ship the battery international. I'm only shipping to the US. Sorry about that.
