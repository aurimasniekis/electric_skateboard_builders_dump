Hi guys, I have come to the conclusion that I no longer have time to spend on this hobby (hint: dogs and brewing beer takes up lots and lots of time ;-))
Bought in November 2017, used 10-20 times since then. Everything is in good condition and will take you through some pretty rough terrain or cruise some really, really bad roads. 

Specs:
* Deck: 16ply 35Âº Holypro
* Motor mount: Trampa Pro Motor mount
* Trucks: Trampa Vertigo Trucks
* Wheels: Trampa Superstar 8 inch
* 2x original VESC 6.0
* Motors: 136kv TRAMPA Motor
* Battery pack: 12s5p Eskating.eu (Samsung 30q cells)
* Tires: 8 Inch HARD TRAMPA Treads Tyres 
* Remote: MAYTECH
* 1x Trampa Bluetooth module
* 1x Muck Off Bag
* 1x Quick charger
* 1x Regular charger
* 1x Vedder Antispark
* Custom 3D-printed VESC box (original VESC-holder included)
* Custom riser for battery container.
* Extra tires

Interested? Give me an offer 

The board is located in Sweden and I can probably arrange shipping which will be added to the price (or feel free to drop by and pick it up).

Hi Ozzie!

I haven't had a odometer logging on it unfortunately, but let's do a worst case calculation:

* 20 rides / 30km each, all including some bit of rough terrain => I.e. very little use
* The hardware and electronics are both in very good condition (and there are spare tyres included if you are worried about wear on the rubber etc.)

I would rather not piece the board out if I can avoid it.

Price can be negotiated, but just so we're clear a similar board from Trampa is 2050Â£ without any wiring done, and without a battery, bluetooth adapter, extra tires. 

You're probably looking at 2500Â£ ish, at least to get a similar setup. That's my **estimates** though.

_I just want to be absolutely transparent here. I'm looking to price this fairly, if you guys think I'm way off in terms of pricing, let me know, preferably with reasons behind it._

What was the max range you could get from a charge? (Not interested in the board but need a good battery)

I'm a heavy guy (100kg), if I remember correctly I maxed the range at 35km or so with the AT wheels on some damp riding (mostly asphalt and dirt roads, some grass)

I think the price is fair tbh, okay so a complete pro belt drive from trampa is 2100Â£ with the Vertigo trucks, that is roughly 2400 euros. Then add the cost of a 12s5p eskating battery  which is 500 euro and the Trampa board sums up to 2900. 

This is 900 cheaper than that which for sure is a noticable difference.

Hi Alan, thanks for the feedback. So, what would you suggest? 

I am not pricing the items "close to retail", but with a discount, both for usage and for the fact that I am not a business. I can't say I'm charging for my time spent assembling the board, or you would be looking at a whole other type of price tag, considering normal hourly rate in my business ;-)

I must admit ive been looking on this site for a week and have come to the conclusion everyone in Europe want to much for second hand boards,which is which why they never seem to sell,look how much second hand cars drop.i think1500 euro more realistic especially as its 1 and a half years old and who wants to trust an 18 month old batterery,im not being rude,but thats what i think its worth

Than donâ€™t buy it. You about to comment that on every trampa sales thread to make the sellers drop the price and than make a good hunt?

And to be honest the 2000â‚¬ is a good price to start with. 

Aand we sell boards here, not cars. So that argument doesnâ€™t count.

Actually to the contrary I think you have no idea just what good value some of the pre-builts out there are when you consider the cost of the components.. and buying from a manufacturer directly most likely won't get you as good a quality build if anything as they cut more corners for profitability.  This guy's price is more than fair.

Honestly ,can get a new kaly nyc here for not much more than that,can also get new trampa top of the line trampa spur gear or probelt for 3200 which is what 2000 euro converts to here in oz,so makes no sense to spend that on a used board built by a non professional and who wants to put faith in used battery,dont worry im not hunting for used board anymore as i said way over priced already got latest trampa 6 weeks ago and getting a second from them next week their builts are very clean looking when it comes to wiring,and set out.oh and warranty helps too.Would u buy a used car built with ferrari parts from a backyard dude or straight from ferrari for similar price,honestly its not rocket science,afterall sellers ask what we think its worth then i get critised when i speak honestly.Lets face it good deals go quick the rest are still here months later,lighten up guys its only my opinion and others i talk to,just get out and ride

Than get that and donÂ´t spend your time telling others what is a good and what is a bad price. if the OP will not sell the board he will understand that by his own.
Have a blast ;)

I will not go into the price of that particular board but I will explain a few things.

Some of you guys do not live in the EU so you may not understand how we are taxed on purchases.

Everything skate related has to pay an extra 17-27%VAT (varies from country to country). If it comes from outside the EU then chances are the original purchaser already payed additional import taxes and brokerage fees.

So the fact that you can get a Kaly for $2500 does not mean the same for someone in the EU as it would end up costing him over $3500.

If that board is sold second hand for $2500 it does not make sense to a US customer however it can be a hell of a deal in the EU.

[/quote]

Oh and, warrenty helps in not so much cases... as soon as you DIY your stuff the vendors donÂ´t give you warrenty anymore... so this point is totally useless here as long as you donÂ´t buy a prebuild.

My point exactly if u buy a ready board u get warranty,if sellers dont want honesty dont ask what we think its worth if they cant handle our opinions,once again chill out everyone we love and share the best freakin shit ever,i dont build im not talented or patient like many of you,the only reason i responded was because i got a hot headed email from someone on this thread i had already moved on,PEACE OUT

"Would u buy a used car built with ferrari parts from a backyard dude or straight from ferrari for similar price"

No comparison - it depends entirely on the backyard dude and what he's put into it that Ferrari wouldn't.
