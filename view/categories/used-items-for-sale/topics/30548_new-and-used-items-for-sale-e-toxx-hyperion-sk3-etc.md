@Sourcecode

It would have to be split into two 7s packs for charging though right? Never used it because I was running 8s packs.

@benjammin Here is a vid, its not in English but you can see whats going on. Basically one balance port is high and the other is low, just connect the batts in series if its two 7s then plug in the individual balance leads and away you go! i have the same charger and it took me a while to figure out how to do it so hopefully it will help who ever sees this :slight_smile:

@Sourcecode

No worries man, I appreciate the info. My problem was I had 8s packs. If I would've known better, I would've gotten 4s and wired them in series.

Hello, are you in Europe?
What would delivery to Hungary cost, I am interested in the 2 motors together.
Sorry I just saw you are in the USA. But if you come up with a good price in total (the 2 motors, delivered to Hungary) I am still interested.

@DilatedPupils

I'm still not really sure exactly :smiley: Most of you guys run circles around me when it comes to the electronics. I'm just trying not to turn into a moving torch :joy: I had originally thought that this was something I would leave connected to the board while I rode in case there was a short, but apparently that's not what they're used for. FWIU, it's just used temporarily to check if there's a short, but it's not supposed to be left connected. 

Perhaps someone else with more understanding of this will chime in.

I picked them up after I had a connector meltdown on me:

Since adding capacitor banks I haven't had any issues though.

From image in first post, boom stopper seem to be inline fuse holder with replacement or different rating fuses included. XT60 connectors, male - female.

Sounds about right. Still not exactly sure on their application though.

Looks like all the fuses are rated at 2A.

Yeah, those are probably just for testing for short circuit. Connect them while first powering up the system and if the fuse doesn't blow, you're good. Don't attempt to ride with those connected :)

I'll look into it, but as far as I can tell the shipping will cost you more than the remote is worth.

Ok, so shipping did end up being a little more than what I was quoted online,  but not nearly as high as what I was told in the post office yesterday (think the lady there must've been a new).  Just went ahead and ate the difference. 

Will send you guys the tracking info here in a minute. 

@Mobutusan
@Mikeomania12
@Nate

 For the mini remote:

Shipping to Alberta will cost 9.50usd
@Multiple_Scoregasm

And shipping to Israel will cost 13.50usd
