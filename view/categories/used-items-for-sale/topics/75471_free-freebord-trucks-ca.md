Hey all,

i've got a pair of freebord trucks i was going to throw out. there basically brand new. anyone want them? it would come with the center wheel but not the actual skate wheels. im in so cal right now but will also be in the bay over the next couple weeks. 

i would ship them too if you wanna pay for shipping but its prolly not worth it.

I'd be interested. I'm in the North Bay Area. Are they the newer hangers, or older ones?

I know this is over a year old but any chance you still have these trucks? I'm chasing a pair. Thanks
