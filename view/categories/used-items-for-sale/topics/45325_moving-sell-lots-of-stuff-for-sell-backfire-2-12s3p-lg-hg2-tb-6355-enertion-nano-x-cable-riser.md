What's wrong with the vanda VESCs apart from a missing USB port on one? 'Burn' can mean many things...they turn on? They give any errors?
```

---
## \#13 Posted by: SFJerryTW Posted at: 2018-02-03T08:54:30.683Z Reads: 297

```
I forgot to unplug the VESC cause the USB Port broken.
The burning happened immediately when I connect to the battery, so I assume the issue not from the chip.
I can't run the motor and also can't connect the ESC tool( There is no any light on VESC but the remote and Bluetooth receiver still have power supply).

I contacted with Vanda and she said it is not difficult to repair, but it is not worthly to include the international shipping. 

If it still unsold, I will keep it and repair them in Taiwan (or China) during my summer trip.

The bent truck bends the motor shaft.
It cause magnets and inner axle friction.
