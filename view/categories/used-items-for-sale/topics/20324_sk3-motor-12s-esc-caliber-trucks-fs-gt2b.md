Hi!

I have a few things for sale - I started building a board but money got tight and so did time. I'd like to sell everything for $220, but can part out if that doesn't work.

EDIT: Parting out. Would like to keep things as bundled as possible but let me know what you're interested in!

- Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 6374 Motor 168KV

SOLD - TorqueBoards 12s 120A ESC w/ Programming Card

SOLD - FrSky GT2B Transmitter w/ Receiver

- Black Caliber trucks (original, not the Caliber II's)

- Pyschotiller Flagship enclosure

The transmitter is brand new, and everything else is used. I purchased the SK3 and ESC from someone here on the forums who had used them briefly, but I never did. The trucks came off an old longboard of mine and would work well if you're going a DIY motor mount route.

Like I said, $220 for all would be best case scenario. I can take PayPal or Venmo. Let me know if you're interested!

Approx 7.5" x 16". It's the Flagship model - looks like @psychotiller is only selling the Flagship v2 online now.

Not entirely sure yet -- gotta see what kind of package I can fit it into. I'd also like to see if I can sell the lot first, but I'll keep you posted if that doesn't work out!

Nope! Caliber 1's look exactly like caliber 2's.  1's were just better made and a little bigger.

The trucks you have are randal clones.

Haven't used those in a long time but I don't think they were much looser when I was riding on them. I'm a pretty big dude and prefer to have stiff trucks for cruising lol
