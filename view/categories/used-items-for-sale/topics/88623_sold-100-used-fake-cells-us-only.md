These are 100 FAKE 30Q cells I bought awhile ago, pulled from my NESE modules so the heatshrink is messed up on a few of them... Would anyone be interested in these for science lol?  i hate to see them all the time and i cant bring myself to just toss em away. The closer you are to TX the cheaper the shipping. Ide like $50 plus shipping but idk know if its worth it to anyone.![1553811935273975116320|374x500](upload://r3dWmRXnAqsHpwStt3LXYxTZaHY.jpeg) 


Please see the threads for full details on how these were determined to be fake.

You should buy 100 Mini Remotes and mod them to be li-ion and sell them ;-)

Dude it took me like a year just to get my board ridable, and its still not perfect. Ide probably die before i modded 100 mini remotes ðŸ˜‚

I actually just bought one of those to manually balance a stubborn P group, so i could maybe use a couple... but not 100. Either way im a lil bitter at these cells lol

Would it be viable to build a portable Battery Pack with the sole purpose of charging your board to a certain percent.

Here is what i would do. 
Buy a DPS and use those cells as a portable charger for various things.
Build some small Powerbanks for mobile devices.
What did you pay for the 100 cells?

Not dead, they arent balanced either. Just checked 5 at random 3.869, 3.877, 3.818, 3.880, 3.882. If ur actually interested ide be willing to go through them all but they are fine. I just dont know their actual mah or discharge capacities and what not

These are liitokala cells right?

Last i heard they actually deliver on capacity, but at like 0.2C. They just don't deliver the amperage of genuine cells. So may be fine in a low current application. 

Make a bunch of usb charged power banks as gifts to friends and family?

If you have a basic load, even a small light globe will work. You can make a simple circuit and measure the current draw of the load and then set a stopwatch, waiting for how long the cell takes to reach about 2.8v. Then multiply the current draw of the load in Amps by the time taken in hours to get the Ah of the battery.

Iâ€™d be interested if the capacity is reasonable. I am in Aus though so Iâ€™m not sure what shipping will be like

If this falls through for you, check out some local recycling centers, home Depot/Lowe's battery recycling bins, or batteries plus. They all usually have slavageable packs you can strip cells from or if you don't want to clean spot welds I've found that vape shops recycle people's old cells and 10-20% of a box of old cells they gather usually hold charges well and you don't have to deal with spot weld cleanup. All these, great for practice! 

If you care about having a good pack from salvaged cells, the litokala li-500 is great for rough IR and capacity testing and this site https://secondlifestorage.com/repackr.php is nice for helping you determine which cells should be part of which P groups in a pack.

All the shops around me do, they take people's old worn out vape cells for recycling... I've found more than a few perfectly good cells given up after testing that I just keep using in my vape for free.. And for the at least stable but crap capacity cells, no weld junk to deal with when practicing spot welding. Unless rewrapping, I just go ahead and separate out all the shitty messed up wrap cells from the get go to be safe handling them.
