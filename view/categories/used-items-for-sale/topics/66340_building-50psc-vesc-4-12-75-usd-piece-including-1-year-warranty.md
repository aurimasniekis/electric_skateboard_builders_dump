Hello
I am new to this forum and this is my first post

I need 8 ESC controllers for my project. I was going to buy Flipsky VESC 4.12 from ebay for 59USD/piece + shipping. When I looked at product info, I realised that it uses FAKE IRFS7530 mosfets, cheap no-name current sense resistors, different PCB layout and rest of the components is propably replaced by lower cost and quality parts too. (look at the included photo of side-by-side original VESC and Flipsky clone)

I am considering building 50-100 pcs using professional reflow oven, keeping 8 pcs for myself and selling the rest

I will have them completed in 1 month from now. I am not asking for any deposits, I am just making a market analysis

Price will be 75USD/piece, 70USD if you buy two pieces (shipping NOT included)
Board will include only high quality parts and genuine mosfets from mouser
All boards will be flashed with newest firmware and tested. They will come with 1 year free repair service. For example: If your DRV8302 dies, it will only cost you 3.50 USD for the IC + shipping

I will be most propably selling them through ebay (or other escrow service) since I am new to this forum

Are you guys interested?

how about the JST connectors for Hall sensors, UART and CAN cables. This vescs will come with them soldered on the PCB or not?

Board will come with all JST connectors, 3.5mm bullet connectors for motor and XT60 for battery

If you do go about this make sure to use octopart to find the best prices for all components, all octopart vendors are legit. Also consider upgrading some of the components like Ollin Boards did, most notably C37.

Interesting, I'm excited to have another Upgraded VESC like Ollin's. Are they all going to be Single's and in that long rectangular format rather than the "Square" format?

Would you be willing to request of a lazy SOB and have larger bullet connectors on instead of 3.5?

Would be interested but im from Eu, so i guess, that partly kills the deal for me.. 

Do u have any info on flipsky dual vesc? It seems to be better built but who knows whats really under, as there are not that many public reviews, at least yet

@Blacksheep @Hummie  There is not a lot of parts that can be upgraded without changes in PCB design

IRFS7530 is the lowers RDS(on) 60v mosfet in to263-7 package

I am going to replace C37 and C51 with bigger value capacitors and 1mOhm shunts with PSG4NTEB1L00F because they have better temperature stability and 8W power rating. Changing other parts will not improve overall performance

@Jc06505n standard single "long rectangular" HW rev. 4.12 boards. I can solder any connectors based on your order

@Okami I am also from EU 

I can ship them worldwide for as low as 7USD

I will definitely build them. Thank you guys :slight_smile:

The 3.5mm bullets aren't really compatible with any motors regularly used in DIY. 4mm or 5.5 might be more popular?

There are people here (admittedly quiet but probably because there's nothing to complain about) who have put many many miles on that flipsky vesc. It's good to know that something built better can be reasonably priced considering that the cheap clone parts just work.

Well until they release their changes I can only tell that they use the same mosfets everywhere, caps are the same 3 x 220uF 100V no idea about their ESR rating probably just simple caps, expensive ceramics missing and etc ;) Issues with resistors and other small stuff :) 

Don't even know if mosfets are legit, as they are discontinued and nowhere available since beginning of year, so either they are fake mosfets (just label on them); Bought from spot market (rejects or old stock), or got them from another company old stocks; Ordered from manufacturer with MOQ 6.5k and lead time of almost half year which I doubt :)

I mean they would work even without capacitors and half of other components just reliability, EMF, control efficiency and other things would be out of scope :) Just don't forget that DRV are pretty sensitive pussies they start cracking from any shit :D

Im no electric circuit designer or engineer or whatever you would call it but i still do not understand why the drv chip has not been replaced by something else that wouldn't pop if you.
But then its majorly popping because of us pushing the limits very high :slight_smile:

They are based on the same pcb as the Tourqeboards one?
Is there a reason why are you not going with the focbox pcb layout?
I would like to get one but not sure if i could fit it

The focbox is not available cheaply which is what they are starting with (all of the base components in a working condition) and upgrading with new components to improve reliability. It doesn't sound like he's starting from scratch.

DRV8302 is good enough for 10S battery. When you connect 12S battery, then inductive voltage spikes from your motor and wiring can (and most propably will) kill your 60v mosfets and the DRV8302 IC. 

I don¬¥t want to desing my own PCB. I want to use something that is tested and works. VESC 4.12 was designed around 2 years ago and it works perfectly

FOCBOX is based on HW rev. 4.12. It¬¥s using the same DRV8302 IC, just different FETs and board layout

PCB design for VESC 6 is not open source. I could buy PCBs from stewii for 10 USD/piece and assemble them. Stewii is selling assembled units for 168 USD (shipping NOT included). I could build them for less, around 100 USD/piece. But he is the person that spent hours with PCB layout and to me it seems kinda rude selling the same thing for less than he is. 

I really like VESC 6 design, it uses 3 sense resistors instead od just 2. It also uses directfet mosfets that can be better cooled in an aluminium box, increasing total continuous amps. I would still consider 10S battery for VESC 6 as "recommended limits"

Would you be more interested in VESC 6 build using stewii PCBs?

edit: I really like Stewii¬¥s PCB design. I will send him PM

I really like the focbox layout because its much smaller, steewi sold vesc6 for a lower price like 90gbp if i remember well in the beginning but he increased it and its still a great deal

Probably if you buy 100 pcbs the price could drop also the pcb design he uses is a lot more compact than the standard 4.12

Stewiis escapes coming with a heatsink, single or dual. That add like 35¬£ on top.
@JantySVK  your calculation for the v6 with 100$ is probably only the pcb with components but you will not provide an housing, right?

@JantySVK which parts of the flipsky vesc would you recommend to replace to make it better?
Capacitor and shunts only or something else?
I get a bunch of flipsky vesc soon and maybe i can train myself on one to do this in the future.
