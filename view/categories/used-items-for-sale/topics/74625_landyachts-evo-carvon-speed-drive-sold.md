Pretty much similar setup as the one in this post.
- Street 97 or 107 wheels
- Ideally 10s5p for the extra range as I don't see myself going super fast a whole lot.  
- Doesn't have to be carvon direct drive.  Any powerful dual belt setup will be fine.
- I am light weight at 135lbs, so weight isn't as issue.
- Budget is gonna be ~$1500usd on the dot
- Timeline: not too much in a rush as its the rain and snow season where I'm at. 
- Shipping: I am located in Vancouver, Canada.  But I can ship it to Washington and drive over to pick it up.   


Feel free to pm me the board(s) that you think will fit the bill


Thanks a bunch! :)

Maybe you could make me a combo deal?
