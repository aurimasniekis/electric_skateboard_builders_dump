This is my custom built electric longboard.

• Top speed is +31mph.

• Range is 12miles

• I built the board about 1 year ago but I have very little ride time on it since I’m pretty busy.

• It was a fun hobby project and not a daily commuter so not much wear on it.

Spec/Parts:

• Battery 12s2p 6000mah Samsung 30Q (bought in the last 4 months from Miami electric boards)

• Motor 192KV SK3 2750W

• 36T 14T gear ratio

• Caliber II Trucks

• Orangatang Kegel Wheels

• Orangatang Nipples Medium Bushings

• Sector 9 long board deck

• GT2B remote

• Ollin Vesc

————————————-
Price:$650

I am willing to sell the trucks, motor, motor mount, and wheels and mounting gear for $249 and if you want the board I will throw it in for $320.
