Hey everyone! Before I start, I will tell you pictures will be uploaded when I get home from work later tonight. 

I have a lot of stuff for sale! I'm trying to clear out for a new, safer build. A lot of these parts were given to me by fellow forum members after a pretty bad crash that destroyed my board. While that board served me well, I need  to make some upgrades in terms of safety. I have asked, and they approved me selling the parts. Because of their generosity, I plan to sell the items at a pretty steep discount (50%+) so I can help someone else!

**Electronics**

Do these switches ever fail “open” to where you can’t turn your board off?

I honestly don't know, someone else will have to chime in on that one. I don't think it would if you are using a fuse for it.

The diyelectricskateboard switches will fail without any load on them so a fuse wouldn’t protect that

You wouldn't happen to have any spare 8mm 6374 motor shafts? If not would you know where I can get one?

I don't have any. The motor shaft will be different depending on the manufacturer. You will have to contact whoever you got the motor from

Yeah, that's the messed up part. After 2 weeks of not hearing anything I contact them and they say it'll be in the mail the next day. The next day rolls around and I get an email saying it won't be mailed for another week.
Has anyone tried to have one machined? CNC or otherwise?

I'm sure someone with a lathe could do it for you, they'd just need the dimensions of everything.
