EDITH: will let go for $125 plus shipping 

Selling as JUNK for parts only 


Carvon 4.5 speed drives 
Originally I purchased these from the link below unfortunately they turned to be a total bust since one of them had issues since the day I received the board. 
Warranty repair didn‚Äôt do very well and here we are 4 months later just tired of waiting around for the board to get ‚Äúfixed‚Äù 

one drive works well.   The other one seems to skip under load, even on flat smooth terrain (watch video)

Make an offer if you need parts.  
They fit Abec wheels. 

BASEPLATE NOT INCLUDED

Hey brother.   Thank you  I appreciate it but I had it with these things.  I just want them gone!   I‚Äôve wasted 4 months waiting around for them to be fixed and at this point I don‚Äôt even want them near me.  They make me nauseous ü§¢

Thanks again for the offer üëçüèº

Hey I know that board! I literally know the history of that drive! It‚Äôs one of the ones from Miguel‚Äôs/Exiledd_Top 4WD crash. Last I saw it was working after Jerry repaired it (yeah he actually used to help out)

Oh damn!!   That suxs.  
I didn‚Äôt had high expectations for the dd but unlucky me.  I didn‚Äôt even get to ride it.    Still one of the motors is good.   Totally worth the $$ for parts I think lol
