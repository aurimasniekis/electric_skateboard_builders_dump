As soon as I get the pulleys I'm going to be running 2 belts in each wheel for a total of 24mm...for science of course. I mostly just wanna see how much drift I can create with a boatload of torque and NO slippage.

How much would you let them go for if I pick them up?
I can grab them today. 
I can't work out how to message privately, so if you could message me that would be good. 
Thanks.
