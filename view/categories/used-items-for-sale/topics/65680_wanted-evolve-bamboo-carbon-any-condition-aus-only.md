Hey guys and girls,  after an evolve board for a platform.  Not really interested in your perfect condition stuff but if the price is right then maybe.  What I'm after is the older crapped out dual motored versions that are stuffed/ out of warranty and collecting dust in the garage.  Unfinished builds etc etc.  
Yeah I know big ask but hell if you don't ask.......
pm why

Yeah a little crafty giggle because esk8 has gotten to the point now where we need scrap/junk yards and a used board market and esk8 repair shops and perhaps an official used board price guide.  Now we just need built-in hour meters in ESCs...

*Jim's esk8 shop*
*2017 Evolve CarbonGT with only 2700 hours for $price*
*2014 Metroboard Shortboard with 8500 hours for $price*
*2018 Boosted Stealth, written-off as total loss by insurance, $price OBO*
