I’ve decided to sell my complete board if anyone is looking for a good setup at a decent price. I will consider splitting it up and selling off separate piece if enough people are interested.

-  Dual TB 6355 motors
-  Dual DIY VESCs
-  MEB 12S2P battery with BMS
-  DIY Reverse mount motor mounts
-  Bustin Deck
-  Caliber II trucks
-  Genuine 97mm Abec 11 wheels
-  Custom 3D printed motor covers and mount supports

Price is $550 for the complete board. Buyer pays shipping. Msg me for more details or questions. ![image|500x500](upload://uGt6yhpUwV3KAX0QjFLe4jn7Np0.jpeg) ![image|500x500](upload://fNODCtM9xy26yICBeKpPSky5nGl.jpeg) ![image|500x500](upload://ryrGErCZHKZ6hV7cPr2BnWzUXlp.jpeg)

Thanks for the interest guys. I have a few people interested in the complete board but if that doesn’t pan out I’ll break it down and contact everyone about parting it out.

Thanks,
Stephen

I am always so skeptical when people put up completes.

This one is a great deal.  Best of luck on the sale!

That's right!  Genuine Master Cho enclosure and wireless remote.  The enclosure is awesome and my favorite part of the build.

putting these internals into the green Landyachtz Flytrap Falcon, yet further replacing the wheels with new 90mm red ABEC11 wheels from Metroboard, and Alan’s enclosure. 

I think then it will be suitably ready; final step is figuring out how to put the flytrap graphic on the top and spray it with grip, and then it’s off to eBay for charity. 

Broken arm slows _me_ down, but trying to keep on keepin on.  

Thank you for noticing I buy more than I can skate. I do hope, in some small way, buying the old stuff and funding the sciences helps us all, since y’all go on to build what’s next. 

Happy 2019, gang. Can hardly wait to see what you guys cook up!

Really good price for a dual motor but I really need to stick to the budget. I think $420 is my absolute max for my build

Might have to lower your expectations. 
Or
Save more 
Or
Build slow and hope to jump on used parts at low prices

I'm about to start learning to make batteries. 
It will be a bit before im comfortable with it.
But i MIGHT be willing to make a few batterys at cost for charity/practice.
Don't hold your breath tho. Lol

Hahah just keep me in the loop, i am interested. Those 18650 cells are pretty darn expensive though. I have heard that there are a lot of fake 18650s too so reputable seller is important.
