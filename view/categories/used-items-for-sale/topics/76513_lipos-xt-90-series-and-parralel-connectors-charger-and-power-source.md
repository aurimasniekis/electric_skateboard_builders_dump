Plus the board you sold me was a dud...
Motors sudder on take off...I think you should credit me a few hundred to repair a problem that was clearly there when you sold the board to me...

I also don´t get all the context.
the topic is only about lipos, you speak about a board.
so you purchased a full board from him and now parts missing or not the parts which where promised to be be sent?

```
which motors you now have?
the trampa motors?
what are your motor max setting in your vesc?
if the settings too hight, than the motors can get hot.
as min it can be one of the reasons.

I have no idea about the electronic side of this .I've been getting my drone friend to setup my quad setup...I just bought this board as a 2wd to play with while the quad is been setup... we're still having trouble with the firefly nano remote but getting there slowly ...as he works family and builds drones...so I don't push him to much...

So far all I see is a highly technical board was bought buy a not so highly technical person. 

Why did you buy a board you nothing about? And further more, why did you buy the supposed "Tesla of EMTB"? There's no such thing.

Again that wasn't the question. Plug your board up to a comouter, open the vesc application on your computer, connect, then tell us thise settings.

Bruv... You did this to yourself. You bought a board you knew nothing about. Apparently, as you avoided my post, you have no way of connecting the board to any computer. If we knew what the settings were, we could tell you why your motors cog. Next time you decide to make a costly purchase, research what you're buying. With most of these board that get sold here, there are build threads on them. Search them and research your purchase. 

With that said. If you have an issue with a seller, keep it in pm and not in public threads please.

what you paid? the 1400 or the 1900?
as far as i understand is the 1400 only for the basic things.
if you want all the extras too, he wanted to have 1900$
did you make everything clear before you bought it?

Nah bruv. You just got a board. He had a whole bin of stuff but it would cost $1900 for the stuff and board.
