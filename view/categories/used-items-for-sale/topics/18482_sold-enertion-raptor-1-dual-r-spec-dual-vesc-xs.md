Hey guys. Once again I'm selling some more excess eboard stuff. It's not excess to me, but as far as my fiance's concerned I don't need two eboards in the house. Especially with having a broken collar bone at the moment I can't skate either of my boards. I'll be getting my Raptor 2 in May also. So that will be just too many! Anyways. Just thought I'd test the waters and see what kinda offers I get. I'm looking to sell fast. Otherwise I'll just hide it at my brothers place and have a spare board. I'm hoping to sell by this weekend! Thanks!

**$1,100 obo shipped in the USA**
1 USED Raptor 1 (Purchased it in November. Last batch)
1 Set of Wheels- Original Enertion Wheels (Only used once)
1 Front bumper guard- Helps protect the nose if the boards gets away from you
2 Vesc-X's- Only ran these vesc-x's 4-5 times to test. So they are basically brand new
1 Enertion Nano-X Remote controller- This remote was fixed by Enertion. It binds every single time with no problems. 
2 Enertion Caliber 2 Trucks- I painted them black a while back
2 R-Spec 6355 Motors 
1 Carbon Fiber deck w/built-in enclosure- The board is definitely used. It has scratches all over it. Tail is scratched from actually using it. Doesn't affect it's use.

This board works great! I'm very happy that I've owned it and that it inspired me to build my own board to replace it. Thanks for looking guys!!!

If there's anything else you guys need like more info, pics, videos, whatever. Just ask.

**I WILL TAKE A MORE CURRENT PICTURE OF THE BOARD WHEN I GET HOME TONIGHT. IT WILL HAVE STOCK WHEELS AND THE LIGHTS IN THIS PICTURE ARE NOT INCLUDED.**

Sorry @SeanHacker don't want to hijack this thread...

@massive-attack I'm sorry but I think the kick starter and group buy possibility for the raptor2 are now over... I think you won't find a better price that the one on Enertion store right now. Except if someone from a group buy is willing to sell you is place. ðŸ˜§

Yep. @JohnnyMeduse is right. The kickstarter is over with. I think all the group buys are full also. The price on the Enertion site is the choice you have now. 

You're not able to post until you've read a little bit on this website. So just search around a read some things for a little bit and then you'll be able to post soon. They do this so that spam bots can't just come in here and start posting.

I would go down to $1000 shipped. That would leave me with around $900 after I pay shipping. It will be available as long as this thread title says "FOR SALE". I've been getting some offers. Just none that I will accept quite yet. ;)

The raptor 2 is around $950 at tier 1, so for $50 more you can get this one.

Darn it! I just bought the broken Raptor one for $700 PLUS SHIPPING Plannning to used the deck battery and vescs for a hub build and fixing and selling the mount and motors. I would've bought yours for $1000, just the VESC-X is worth like $300

I'll get some more pics after I get outta the hospital. The top is just grip tape though. Nothing different than any other raptor.
