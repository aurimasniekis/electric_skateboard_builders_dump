Some basic stats of this battery:
Used for 50 charge cycles, always kept below 80% and above 20% charge accept for when charged once to 100% for cell balancing.
10s3p configuration
36v nominal voltage
270 watt hours
30 amp max draw
30 amp fuse as well as BMS for maximum safety
Samsung 25R Cells
I purchased the quick charger to accompany this battery and is included in this sale.
It has an on/off switch as well as a percent charge display.

The reason I am selling is because I want to get into making a large pack myself out of 18650 cells. I need the money to buy these cells and supplies. 
I am asking for 250$ for the battery and the quick charger.
I will post pictures when I get home. If you have any questions feel free to ask. If you are interested in purchasing please pm me.

Thanks for your time, Hans Swanson

According to this website, if you run it in the 80-20% range as I have you can expect up to 900 cycles.
