I have two TorqueBoards 4.12 vescs for sale. They only have about 7 miles total on them. Both were killed due to shorted phase wires. One has a shortened power lead, and neither have bullet connections. Would be used to fix and resell or use for your own build. Both have a little bit of weather foam on the bottom, but it will come off once you open up the shrink wrap to fix it. The bullet connections will be desoldersed because I need them for the new vescs I get.

Asking $45 for the unmodified one, $35 for the one with shortened wires plus shipping. OBO

I can't ship outside the continental US.

Still available? They just need new fets right?
