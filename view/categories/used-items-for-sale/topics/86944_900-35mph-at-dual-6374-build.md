Only about 50miles riding the board,, in mint condition tbh. W/ both sets of batteries you can travel approximately 20-25 miles depending on your weight, inclination of your terrain, wind, trigger control, etc 
Can reach 30-35mph... 

Dropped price to sell ASAP... PM if interested 
Would like to sell to someone near me, LA and surrounding would be best.

Definitely keen! Approximate weight of the board? Would you consider shipping to Australia if I cover the costs? Cheers.

@Slydunan I'm not exactly sure on name/specs, but they have about a 15 degree inclination and are the ones pictured in the img![Screenshot_20190329-144950__01|480x108](upload://dR57oWYSKaba0sqbzSPElBMpFeS.jpeg)
