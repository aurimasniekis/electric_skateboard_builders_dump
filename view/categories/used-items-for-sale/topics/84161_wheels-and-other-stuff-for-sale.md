Cheapest shipping to Australia in general is 36$ usd, @mynamesmatt was going to buy wheels but the shipping cost broke the deal unfortunately

Unfortunately the shipping is too high.  Shipping prices from AU to US and US to AU is always just ridiculous.

Thanks for getting back to me.

Good luck with the sale.
