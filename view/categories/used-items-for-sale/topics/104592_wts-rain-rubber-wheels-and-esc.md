I am clearing out some parts and components that I don’t need specifically, I have a set of rubber rain wheels.

I think ownboard used to sell them for a while. They’re pretty solid. I bought them for $100 asking $50 OBO.

Second, I have an ESC that I bought a year ago from http://www.diyeboard.com/v11-dual-hub-motors-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-608.html.
I bought this to replace the ESC in my ownboard but did not see any significant difference in power. It’s rated for 50A continuous and 120A burst at 10S and was originally designed for hub motors but it can push belts as well.

Asking $30 OBO
