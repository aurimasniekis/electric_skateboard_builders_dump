Im in Florida, USA.  What do you want for it?  Might be worth it to me to ship.  I can't find them anywhere.

They're discontinued. Mine has about 300 Miles on it through light-medium use on footpaths, its twin blew the other day, but im not surprised because its shown issues from day 1. 

Anyway, I think it was 139$ + tax originally, would 75$ + Shipping make sense?
