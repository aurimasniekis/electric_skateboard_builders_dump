So the Vescs died and now you're just selling the whole thing. How many miles did you ride it? Looks fairly well used. 

How much would it be to ship the whole thing to the US and would the battery be cleared by customs? Not sure what the regulations are.

The grip tape just collects dust, just needs a clean with a grip tape block.  The mounts get scatches by  kerbs hence why scatches to just the bottom.  Can be re touched up,  but they will get scratches on it again.  Doesnt affect use.  The board runs fine when running.  Motors are rock sollid. 

Its used not new.  Battery may need to get sent separately.  If your serious about item i can investigate further.

I'd like to have the trucks, motors and motor mounts. That's all. Of course that depends on shipping expenses. I've never shipped anything from Australia to the US before.

If you seal the section where the cables come out to the motor it will prevent water getting into electronics. Cover on top allows access to battery. You could make it water resistant with some seals and covering the power and lcd cutout. Ive got a clear screen on it.

I dont thnk you want to be skating in the rain. It can handle puddles, Ive taken my Raptor through some. Its more the motors need to be dried afterwards, but as all battery and esc/vesc in cover they are protected from the water.

Cant really give you an answer as never kept track. Random use.  10,15 km over say year,  but random minimal use over that time.   The enertion motors are rock solid. Hence why they are that expensive. The vescs are the issue as far as the whole package is concerned thats why im selling.  No vesc.  You might need to adjust trucks. The motor already has a key on shaft for pulley set.

@nngg What did you want to pay for them? Happy to negotiate a price with you pm me.  As you would know no one gets the price they list for.  Everyone puts in an offer for 1/4  or whatever of whats listed then the seller goes down to the buyers offer or counters. I dont check every deal that goes on or past.  Bet for now you probably cant get the enertion 6533 now as probably out of stock. I do know its listed at 179.95 aus. Not including postage. And by the way you can always get a cheaper motor.  Just depends on if you want the Enertion ones.  Its up to the buyer to do the research and I did sell the other motor etc today,  so dont think its totally unrealistic.  Have you had an Enertion one before?
