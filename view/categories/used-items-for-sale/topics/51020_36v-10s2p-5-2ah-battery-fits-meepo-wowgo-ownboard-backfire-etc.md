10s2p 5.2ah 

Maybe 5 miles of use on the battery.  

Used for my first build, which I quickly upgraded to and built a battery myself that would fit a different enclosure.

Fits wowgo/meepo and all those that use that size battery back, or custom build of your own.  This is an upgraded battery since they typically come with 4.4ah batteries.

I can also include a JST connector and wired charging port with a pigtail that you can solder onto your own charger.

$85 Shipped.
