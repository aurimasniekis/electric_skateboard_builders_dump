Hi @Acidfie ! Maybe giving us the enclosure's measurements would help you to sell it.

Inner dimensions are: 385-145-35 **inside**, fitting a 10S3P and BMS easily.

Hey @Acidfie I want your battery, enclosure and bms. Would this be ok on a flexy deck? And how much would you charge for postage to the UK? 
Thanks

Can we get a closeup of the VESCs please? two pics one for each pcb, just the pcb as clear as possible

4.12 hardware I think I see, presume they turn on and only give the drv error when trying to spin the motor?
```

yeah, i can take macro pic when i am at home.

they worked both without problems, although i fried the DRV while connecting the can bus. (GND Loop).

Hardware is 4.12.

Do you have some more details on the 10s3p battery? What dimensions is it? How many cycles has it been through and does it come with a charger?
```

---
## \#22 Posted by: Acidfie Posted at: 2018-03-30T11:09:21.683Z Reads: 112

```
the dimensions are like every 10S3P Pack: 300 X 150 X 20 (where the BMS sits its a bit higher about 4mm)

cycles around 15
