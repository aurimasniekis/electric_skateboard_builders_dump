I decided to go a different route. So I got these two just collecting dust. I'm selling both because I can't remember which receiver pairs with the right remote.

I actually use one remote for two boards. A receiver in each.

Does anyone else have one of these, and can I pay for it, and send you an overnight label so I can keep riding ?  My nano x got scrubbed on the ground at speed during a wreck, and the USB cable connectors came loose.  It looks a bit tiny for me to solder, however I'm about to try.  I need a back up remove for shizzle.

Could anyone else point me to another controller I can buy to replace the nano X in a raptor 2.1 set up?
