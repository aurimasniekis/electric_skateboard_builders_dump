Whats the condition of it?  (any damage, how many miles, was it abused)  I'm guessing $1300 new and it looks in good condition so maybe you're looking at $1000 give or take for it plus shipping

Very nice looking build though, but you might wanna show whats under the enclosure too

Not sure on the mileage, it was my commuter board. I was a pretty easy rider, cruising and carving was my focus. I rode it everyday i could, its just that fun. Ill upload some more pictures when i get the chance. Thanks for the kind words

Added your location to the title. Its annoying to click on a thread only to see its in the wrong country.
