Eskates still not legal in Germany and I don't want to push my luck being a foreigner.
Moving on to bigger, faster, 2 wheel, legal modes of transportation.  

Almost everything is brand new and never used since I never got around to finishing a build, has been siting in my storage room taking space.  
Questions or offers, please ask or PM. Everything is located in Germany.

**Carvon V4 Speeddrives -  €400**  

Got these second hand so has some scratches and signs of use. Only thing that is used out of everything.  Phase wire connectors have been removed but never got around to putting the new ones on for the unity.

[/quote]

The antenna were purchased extra and not with the metr pro. you must move a resistor on the pcb if you want to use an external antenna over the internal one.  They are being included free with the metr pro.

Everything is excl. shipping since the price varies so much for different locations in Europe.  
Charger is currently only included as an extra with the battery.

import duty and Vat, on top of enertion delay tax. 
The unity is actually underpriced once duties and VAT is added.

That’s complete balls. I paid 8 euros in tolls for the import of mine (to Sweden).

Good luck with your sale! I’m sure some fool will bite.

Sick story mate, why don't you buy another one! Or are you not interested at all and only here to talk shit? 

Same price that I've already sold 3 of them for with no issue.

Yea and a lot of people do pay Vat. So why should I sell for less than what it cost just because some kid on the Internet has no idea how importing stuff works.  And that's not including that I have the unity ready to ship now, more than what enertion can say.
Now go play outside in the sun with the rest of the kids and enjoy the weekend before school starts again.

Just chiming in on the hoodie, it's a really great piece of gear.

I enjoy it for riding at any speed, because as long as you're going above 5mph it's breathes enough to not bake you alive 👍 
(Worn on an 85 degree day to test it out)

Additionally the padding seems like it would be enough to take the brunt of a fall, but I can't say for sure as I havnt taken a spill on it yet :+1:

My only downside to it is the weight (which is a small complaint, it's not *terrible* but it's certainly hefty), and the hood. Imo the hood is quite large and a little floppy, so it sometimes flops around in the wind at higher speeds.

Overall, if I took a fall tomorrow and somehow ruined the hoodie, I would totally buy another one ASAP :)
