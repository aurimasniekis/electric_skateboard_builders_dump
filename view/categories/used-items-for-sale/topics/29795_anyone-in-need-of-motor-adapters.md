You may want to add pictures for all the people that don't know the different type of connectors. Also, maybe look around on the forum to see what other connectors people are having problems with or most commonly used and make those as well. My .02.

Thanks, edited and put some pics of the one I am currently using on my board, it is a 4mm male to 4mm female to extend the length of the motors phase wires, all will come with heatshrinked connections and cable mesh for a cleaner look. They will be made upon request.

Hi guys I'm looking for 3 x adaptors to change 4mm bullet (male) to 3.5mm bullet male - the shorter the better.

Can anyone supply there?
