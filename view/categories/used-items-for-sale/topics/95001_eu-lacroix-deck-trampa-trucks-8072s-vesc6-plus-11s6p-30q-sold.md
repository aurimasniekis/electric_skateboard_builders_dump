I genuinely have no idea what it would sell for. I don‚Äôt want to be *that* seller that way overestimates the selling price. The deck goes for 700 dollars new, but I don‚Äôt know how much being used and the holes I drilled takes off that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

No worries üòÑ

It is, but I (and you can see a pattern here lol) drilled M4 holes in it to fit an 80xx motor instead of the stock 63xx.

11s6p 30Q with about 4-5 cycles on it. There‚Äôs a DieBieMS and a VESC 6 Plus inside. Motor is an APS 8072S. Remote is a 3D printed baby buffalo, but I‚Äôve been having cutout issues with it so I‚Äôd give it for free for testing.

In terms of price, I guess I‚Äôd be happy with maybe 1000 euro?

This is a nice deal, ‚Ç¨1000 would be a great deal for the lot. Would it be difficult to convert the pack to 12s?

maybe a sign I shot a bit low, right? üòÇ

It was originally was a 12s, with an externally mounted VESC, but I wanted it to be a bit more rugged and splash resistant so I removed a pack of 6 cells and put the VESC in their place. It wouldn't be hard to undo that.

It also wouldn't be hard to remove another pack of 6 and add a second drivetrain.

This is an insane deal at 1k euro. If I needed even a fraction of these parts I would be all over this like a fat kid on cake.

The fact that this is still sitting here at that price blows my mind. 

Get on this gents.

Fixed the post, I really didn't think used parts went for much of a proportion of their new price.

Yeah you're right, normally it's only a fraction of the original prices
But here you have some highly wanted stuff (in EU, Lacroix is not common here)


(The build fall more on the very-powerful / beast builds of the forum, 11s6p and)
I just realized it was single drive... a dual 6.6 with 8072 and you have your beast build

I dislike myself for saying that because I can only affords cheap parts but when selling stuff, aim a little high (not saying to the moon), and if nobody wants it, just lower the price

There is nothing wrong with correcting this to 1.5k, still very good value, with easy change to monster power for another ‚Ç¨500 = total animal 

Plus just ride and enjoy a perfectly good design as is
