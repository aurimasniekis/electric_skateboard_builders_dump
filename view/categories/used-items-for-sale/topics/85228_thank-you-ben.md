As the title suggests.

**1. Flipsky Anti-Spark (New) - $15usd**

FATboy 100A Anti-Spark (Used)) - **(SOLD)**
Removed the buzzer for the FATboy antispark to make it slimmer.

*Do note that the FATboy Anti-Spark drains 0.5W of power as long as it's connected to the battery. I will recommend disconnecting it from your battery if you intend to store your board for extended periods.*

3. Flatland 3D Glove (New) Size M - $45usd **(SOLD)**


Will be shipped from Singapore. Shipping would be $10 usd to anywhere in the world, for either antisparks, or the glove, or for all items combined.

Does the fatboy switch come with the free integrated battery drainer Jeff? 

Oh god I'm so sorry I did that but I'm also not going to remove it because I feel like I've earned some maturity points in the last week or so?
