Was just snooping around my closet and came across these trucks. These trucks are enertion trucks and they have extended axles from what I heard. The trucks have been on a deck and have been rode on for around 5 miles until I switched to a different truck. One truck has some slight cosmetic wear from the motor mount clamping on to the truck. If you put a motor mount on that truck, it would hide the scratch.
I paid $30 per truck +AUS shipping a while back, but I'm willing to give both trucks for the price of one ($30) +Shipping.
PM me if you are Interested
