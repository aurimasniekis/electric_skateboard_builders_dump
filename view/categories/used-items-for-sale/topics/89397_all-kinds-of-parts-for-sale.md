Hey guys I know I been gone for a while... My wife wants me to sell off this stuff... Not in the hobby anymore :( 

I have to catalog everything and so I will sell them off as I can figure out how. Probably first are the vescs and escapes...

![IMG_20190403_215955940|375x500](upload://kUxeqPZPWKg7V654XP8nTw7Bwue.jpeg)

**UPDATED PHOTO OF WHAT'S LEFT:**
![IMG_20190408_070143678|375x500](upload://fHLbutU8TnpVQj6qB7fZekqSITk.jpeg) 


**BELOW IS WHAT IS LEFT:**

1. These things to wire battery packs... from Kuglis..
![IMG_20190406_071928495|666x500](upload://leBVrV6OkD4lJxkHesXJkdHylwJ.jpeg) 

2. One amazing deck from long-haired boy ($350 shipped for the deck else I am keeping it)

**Update**: only the white board left. Spuds are sold out.

![IMG_20190406_071654460|666x500](upload://q1r5Rf0MM3BcngfrvZVONxw4civ.jpeg) 

3.  **SOLD** - Muir short board with home built 12s charger. Board doesn't start because bms could be fried or antispark is fried.  There are (2) ESCapes inside of it. The batteries are 12s but graphene ... 2 x 6s configuration.  I know people want just the ESCapes but if I do that it will be a total loss. It has everything and the large sized maytech motors.  So I appreciate someone to nurse this back to health. $500 (lowered) shipped for everything.

Here are the details of Muir short board build -- it comes with a transformer that charges 2s-12s 50v in ultra fast speed.

Here is my build log:

[/quote]

Do you just have that somewhere for copy and paste-ing?

By ‚Äúfor some‚Äù you might be talking about 2% of people. For all we know, you are the ONLY ‚Äúmiddle?‚Äù aged man who can afford a car, maintenance and the fossil fuel needed to run it and decided to go 100% skate instead. 

I would understand not having a car if one lives in an area with useful mass transit. But for most this remains a hobby of building and riding with groups. My commute to work in a car is 10 minutes. I ride to the office on weekends and it take about 45 minutes.  Of course one cost almost nothing and the other cost a few bucks in gas and wear and tear.

Your constant argument that rain, snow, etc is fine for riding if you go slow and carefully is odd. I‚Äôm not going to carry an umbrella while riding. Might help if the brakes fail though ü§î.

Anyway HOBBY HOBBY HOBBY MINIVAN!!!!üòù

I guess you just like polluting your descendants' planet, then.  I actually care about the children ;-)  I try to be green whenever possible.

Riding with an umbrella is ridiculous unless you melt when wet.  Typically it's only your ankles and shoes that get wet anyway.

You will need 3.5 to 4kw to maintain 50mph. How you get there is another story. Rear drive ok.  My opinion, front drive is the better option.  I would advise heavy armoured motorcycle road leathers and a lightweight Snell certified full face helmet. A neck collar would be a good idea as well. Pushing your delivery limits will find you rag dolling.  Bad setup the same.  Might want to see how 110 mm thane distorts at 50, I'd bet it's a grower not a show-er.  For your delivery system I haven't a clue.  If it's overbuilt with good components it stands a better chance of getting you there and back.

I will give it this week to see if I can sell off the whole board. It's listed right now for only $500 shipped.  The (2) x ESCapes would be at least $200 for the two. The motors are $150, etc.

Idk I will wait  a couple of days... if no one comes thru I will sell the parts out of the board including the ESCapes.

Here are the details of Muir short board build -- it comes with a transformer that charges 2s-12s 50v in ultra fast speed.

Here is my build log:

Sorry y'all. I can only sit here for so long looking at this broken down beauty before I can't take it anymore. I blame the community for this, cause I was waiting for someone else to buy it and remove the temptation. Way to go, guys. :roll_eyes: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

That deck is beautiful in its simplicity. Although being white, it probably won't stay that way for long unless it's hung on a wall. I've always wanted an LHB deck, but my poor credit card is basically limping around on crutches in my wallet. Plus, this deck is basically a blank canvas for anyone wanting to personalize it. With a lot of @longhairedboy decks, there is so much cool, custom design work, that I'd feel like I'm slapping Skatan in the balls if I undid any of that artistry. At least it's not Tutti frutti green or orange or blue, right @pixelsilva? :roll_eyes: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Sorry, sorrryyyy...je..je.. hope you excuse me @gogomrrobot and @Mobutusan (no hate and no diminishing the board, Goldie), is just personal taste. Wish you sell that board soon my friend, I'm pretty sure there are lots of guys here that will snatch that board in a sec. You beat me fair an square with the ESCapes, Shawn (God, no tutti frutti, please!), enjoy the board bro. :yum:

@gogomrrobot I was thinking you were still in ATL, and was going to get @Indiangummy to grab that LHB deck for me.


I do not need this thing at all.  It would be put on the wall!  

I have this sneaking suspicion that in a few years as Esk8 and PEVs become ubiquitous and @longhairedboy is revered in some God like status, this thing gonna be a classic collectible.
