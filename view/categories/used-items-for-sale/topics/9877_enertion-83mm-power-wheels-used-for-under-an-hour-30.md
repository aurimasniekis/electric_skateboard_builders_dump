Recently bought the Enertion Raptor duel which came with these bad-boys on but already had some real Abec's sitting in waiting so don't need them. Literally under an hour of riding time put on these stock wheels so they're basically brand new. If you're building an esk8, these obviously fit the Enertion pulleys, grab um cheap before they go! 

Looking for £30 + shipping. (**UK BUYERS ONLY**)

No clue lol, let me ask at my local shipping shop. Will report back with quote in a couple hours. Do you care about speed? Bc obviously Fedex is gonna be more than just standard first class shipping with tracking..

That quote was Royal Mail with tracking, and I'm sorry to say but I wont send unless it's tracked. This is why I'm hoping to find a UK buyer if poss..  If you want it let me know.
