I have a bunch of parts I am looking to sell, they were meant for a project that was never finished so all this stuff has never actually been used! I am based in the UK

Trucks are brand new but have dents where some motor mounts were attached with grub screws to one of the trucks, other truck is mint condition.

2 unused 6374s motors that have never been used with 2 15 tooth pulleys with keyways and keys (https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/63mm/aps-6374s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-130kv-3200w/):

4 x 8 inch hypa wheels with "treads" tyres. Can offer 2 3D printed (ABS solid infill) 72 tooth pulleys as well if someone wants them (only two pictured but I have 4 wheels available).

I also have 2 DIY motor mounts for the motors listed above. They are 10mm aluminium with 3 x M6 grub screws to secure them to the trucks.
