Hello, I'm looking to sell the following:

SOLD: **Bundle:** Caliber 2 truck with a 5055 motor welded on, single motor ESC, Rough Stuff 110mm Wheels, Front Generic Truck, Meepo 10s2p battery (no charger). **The battery is BRAND NEW!** Everything else has been used before. 

I'll sell this bundle for **SOLD**.

I'm also selling used Evolve F1 Abec 11 107mm with 33t wheel pulley + 14t motor pulley. I rubbed off the Evolve logo and I used a black sharpie to try to color in the market. There are some small chunks but it's pretty much unnoticeable when you ride. The 33t wheel pulley was drilled to fit the wheels. The last picture shows how the wheels look with my board (board not for sale). Looking for **$60 shipped OBO**.
