Is there any way that we can get verification that this man is ok with you selling his parts for him? Maybe a short post or message would be reasonable - the quick price drop and lack of immidiate pictures make this entire thing look like a scam.

Why didn't he want photos to be posted publicly? Sounds pretty dodgy without a good reason

You are right. The question is: are these trucks good? It looks solid, but I have no clue on what kind of alloy would they use for stuff like this in China.

The usual answer to question like that would be: cheapest.

And if you don't have the data or you're not sure, just assume and expect it is the right answer.

No, they are not. Essentially similar to the 11" kit sold over at diye.

OK if you are a beginner. 
*No replacement parts available
*kingpin will develop play/bushings will wear down
*no dampers, unstable at high speeds 
*no proper motor mounts with belt tensioning available
*wheel hubs come with bearings pressed in, thus difficult to service. 

:frowning:

Mount only fits one particular type of maytech motor.
