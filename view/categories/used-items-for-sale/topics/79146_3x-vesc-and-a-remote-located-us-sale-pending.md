2x Ollin Vescs, and 1 focbox all fine except they were loaded with incorrect firmware, might be a simple fix with st link might not be either way you can send them to someone else to get repaired if you canâ€™t do it yourself, Iâ€™m tossing in the gt2b remote mod for giggles but it has to be within 1ft range if the receiver(again may be a simple fix idk) ![image|375x500](upload://eEPEr1vAhKyG80LsbkcwrFbgdwa.jpeg)

Just shoot me a price Iâ€™m not trying to make a crapload of money just trying to sell them for something
