2 barely used focboxes for sale.

I’m in NEWCASTLE but happy to post or have someone collect. I’ll be making regular trips to Sydney soon as well.

$150 each price is firm.

Cheers

I am pretty sure latest version they would be less than a year old but honestly lucky to have put 50km on them.

I’ll be down in about a month I’m happy to ship to Sydney for free.

I’ll pm u my mobile
