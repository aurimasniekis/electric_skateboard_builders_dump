As the title states, I have two focboxes to sell. Both focboxes are v1.6


1x used focbox 1.6 with stock heatsink (no bulets ~100 miles)

1x used focbox 1.6 no stock heatsink, with blown off cap (replaced ~20 miles)

My price is 200$ shipped (f&f)

[/quote]

they both work.... and the one with the blown off cap is considered fixed :grinning: the caps are wired in parallel so adding a extra cap on top shall do

but yeah sure you guys can split

Hell yea we can do that. I was actually also interested in the one with stock heat sink, so that’s perfect I guess.

Guess you would pay a little less than me because yours doesn’t have heat sink and blown cap.

@AlanZhou how much for shipping to Denmark or Austria?

I think you are right.

I don’t mind buying the one with heat sink for a bit more, so you can sell the one without for cheaper and make it more attractive.

Decisions decisions...

I won't do that cause then I'll feel guilty

But if someone claims the one without the heat sink, the one with the heat sink is all yours

@seaborder

Shipping from me to you is actually surprisingly cheap. $10.

Looks like you could add one of these and it would be back to normal

Pretty sure I had already posted this, but apparently not...

So if I pay $115+$23-$10=$128 then you pay $80+$10=**$90**? This includes shipping from me to you.

And @AlanZhou, would you be able to put the value to $11 instead?
