Back in January I bought a bunch of parts to make my own board but didn't get around to completing it. 

Torque Boards 6355 190KV motor on eBay (I have 2). These are 100% new.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/272858735779?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1558.l2649 

Not on eBay:
**SOLD** - VESC (NEW UNUSED) - $90

**SOLD** - DIY Electric Skateboard motor mount kit (16T/36T 12mm ABEC Drive Wheel Kit) AND the Caliber Style Trucks. These were lightly used for about 2 weeks. - $75
**SOLD** - 10S BMS (unused, no JST cables-- it requires one 8-pin and one 2-pin) - $30
**SOLD** - 36V laptop-style battery charger (unused) - $30
**SOLD** - Really good remote (unused) - $40
**SOLD** - 100mm MBS all-terrain wheels (google for more info) - $45


I also have a VESC with a broken DRV8023 chip (I have a replacement chip but don't have the tools or knowledge to fix it). Selling for $50 I guess

So if anyone wants to buy any of this stuff, please let me know! 
I live in NYC if anyone wants to do local pickup-- otherwise can ship. I can negotiate the prices a little.

I got the BMS from https://bmsbattery.com/bmspcm/732-12s-16s-30a-lifepo4-bms-for-battery-case-07-bms-pcm.html 

For the JST connectors you will need one cable with 8 pins and another with 2 pins. If you look in my original post, I uploaded photos of the one I have-- on the right side at the bottom there is an 8 pin connector, and right above it is a 2 pin connector. When I bought this BMS, they gave me the cables but the battery I made was badly soldered and short circuited, so I had to throw it all out :frowning: 

The BMS itself doesn't cost much ($20) but the shipping they charge is $30-40... crazy. So I'd like to sell it for at least $30, shipping included.

-- I got it for $47 back in January so I'll sell it for $40. Is that reasonable? I have not been keeping up with prices recently.

Just added the motor mount kit photos. 

It is currently assembled on the trucks with my wheels but I have also included a picture I took when I first received it, so you can see each and every part of it.

Then you would end up with a 9S battery. I am not sure if BMS' supports fewer cells than it is made for.

If you still have the remote, I would be interested.  My kid took a spill and used his benchwheel remote as a puck :slight_smile:.  I'd like to get him another one, cant find a place to buy them anymore.

The motor mount kit - $80
Toasted VESC - $50? 

Where would I be shipping to? I can check prices-- I usually go for the cheapest option.
