For some reason I can't post in the group buy category so I'm placing it here.

I got a hold of what seems to be the original FLIER factory via alibaba. They are selling this switch for 35USD/piece with a MOQ of only 5 pieces. Shipping to me is pretty expensive (at 38USD) so it would only really make sense if I where to buy multiple sets.

Is anyone interested in a group buy? Realistically I can only ship to European countries to keep the 2nd shipping cost down. If your from Belgium you can come by for a pickup to!

Tought that would be the case, well I can buy them in advance but it would be a little pointless if no one else had any interest in them.

Just got a very nice link from a switch by @Martinsp. No need to buy these anymore.
