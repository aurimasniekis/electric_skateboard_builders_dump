I’ve got 3 new in package MBS grab handles. The closest I found online was 39 euro. 
$25 each shipped in US

I’ve got three new in package replacement springs for Matrix trucks. I’m not sure but I can’t see why they wouldn’t work in Trampa trucks they seem identical to the ones in my vertigos. 
They’re $17 plus shipping on MBS site. 
$15 shipped in US

Thanks
