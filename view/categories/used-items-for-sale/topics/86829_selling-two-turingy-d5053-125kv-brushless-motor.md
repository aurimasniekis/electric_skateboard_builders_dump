First build electric mountain board. After a couple of rides (20 km ) I conclude that those motors are not provide  enough torque for a mountain board. I upgraded to 6374 motors quickly . 
Reading here at the forum and in my experience - those 5053 motors would work on a E skateboard riding on pavement . With the right setup ( battery and ratio ) those motors will bring you good speed and fun . My range was 13km with max speed of 34km/h ( 8inch wheels)
So I think with a  longboard , smaller wheels - those motors would work well . Any questions - please do not hesitate to ask.
The motors are sold as in the pictures , 100% working !
