I got a 100a Hobbyking esc that I donâ€™t need.  Still in perfect condition.
I also got 2 3s Zippy 5000mah batteries with 1 dead cell in each.
$20 for both or $10 each shipped in us
Iâ€™ll post pics when I get home

Uhhhhhhh. Does it have breaks? It looks like a beefier version of what I have which doesn't allow for breaks. Are the breaks like drag breaks, where it breaks on neutral?
