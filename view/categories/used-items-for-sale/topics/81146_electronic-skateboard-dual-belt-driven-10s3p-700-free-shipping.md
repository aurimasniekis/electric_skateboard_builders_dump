Probably the ones used in diyeboard's kit. The board look like it's made from the kit.

i think so too, that¬¥s why I ask.
but isn¬¥t the diy kit new even less, or am I wrong here?
700$ seems a bit much here.

700 is a lot for this type of board, both motors cost 150 new, the enclosure 60, cheap Chinese esc 80, 10s3p battery 200, and deck would be probably less then 100, you probably want to consider changing the price

without any disrespect, it¬¥s a used board and the hours somebody spend to build it doesn¬¥t count.
But if somebody ready to pay 700$ for a delicious street face after the rear truck snapped, why not :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

One is trashed, one is on its way and the ither two are fairly new but I'm about to fuck em up proper like üòÅ. The esc is ok but dont try and do speeds on it. Poof it goes.

@Drakkennith  My friend this kit is forward mount motors not reverse.  They are reverse king pin trucks.  Means the king pin faces out not in like the front.  Flip it and re advertise before you get absolutely hammered.  Oh and drop the ridiculous price point.  I can buy this thing direct for far less.  Good luck

Yeah I think the only issue with some reverse mounts is riding off of large lipped surfaces / speedbumps that will hit the motors.  (or on a kicker lol)

I prefer my front mounted motors :stuck_out_tongue:

Wants to sell electric skateboards to electric skateboard builders...

Has extensive history of research and interaction with the community...

oh, or rather, has barely even seen how to make an electric skateboard or how they break, and is completely unknown in the community.

@Drakkennith you're being disrespectful here. This "thing" costs 300$ max. And it doesn't matter how much you paid. It's used. These trucks are a life hazard. Please remove this listing or update with real price. Don't try to bullshit us or new builders, we know our shit.

You've gotta be pretty heavy to break em and if you do congrats you just joined tons of other people who have broken trucks 

Gotta be pretty skilled to not get wobbles on these trucksüòè
