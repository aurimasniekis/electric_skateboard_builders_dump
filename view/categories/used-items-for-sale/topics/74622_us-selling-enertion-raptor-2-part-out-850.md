Hello community!   I‚Äôm thinking about parting out a raptor 2.   Board is nearly complete   Drivetrain sold  ‚ÄúNo trucks or motors‚Äù.  Everything else is available 
Board had been used a total of 27 miles before I took it apart.

EDIT 
$850 takes everything in the pictures 
10s4p Space cell 
Focboxes 
All components including deck and enclosure 
4a fast charger 
Nano x 
All you really need is a drivetrain and you‚Äôll be good to go 

Thank you

UPDATE:
battery enclosure and focboxes are SOLD!!   
Everything else is still available
