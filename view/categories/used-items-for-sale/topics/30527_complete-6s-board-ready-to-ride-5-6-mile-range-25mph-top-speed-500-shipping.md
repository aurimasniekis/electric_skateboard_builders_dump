I build this board about a year ago, don't really ride it much at all and could use the money for classes this fall.

Has a antispark key I made that is removable and can be clipped on a key chain. The ESC also has an on off switch. Nothing is wrong with the board just charge it and go fast. The board has lots of torque and for me going 20+mph feels way fast enough to me. I can climb hills fast no problem at all and weight about 185lbs. Board has only 20-30 miles on it. Board has a pretty long and wide wheel base so its very stable.

Only asking **$550 plus cost of shipping** so price is **firm** I'm not asking much for a very well put together complete board with quality components. 

Located in USA, Florida.

PM me any questions or text me at **239-634-3zero3eight**.
