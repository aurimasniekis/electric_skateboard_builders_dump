**Located**: Sydney, Australia.
**Postage**: Prefer postage in Australia, but international is possible. If you let me know where you are I can calculate postage. (Roughly $50AUD to US, EU)
**Price**: As most people here know the raptor 1 was fairly limited production board and most decks were thrashed. I haven't got a set price as I am not sure what people are willing to pay. Offers welcome.

Selling my loved Raptor 1 deck. It's been displayed in my room on my wall for too long. Someone should be shredding on this great deck. After about 200km I moved all of my raptor parts onto a shorter carbon fibre deck as the raptor 1 deck was too long for a commuter board. Board is in great condition. It has the tail guard so that has protected the tail. Comes with 2nd gen lid, so no connection issues. I have the handles, just didn't take the photos with them attached.

This was one of the first raptors to be delivered so it had some issues with the grip tape adhesion. I still have the grip tape rolled up but I re-griped it a week or so into getting my board. 

I have resprayed the deck with a matte finish rather than the gloss. I always like my carbon fibre matt finished. If you want to buy the board but want it in a gloss finish then let me know. I can for a small amount re wet sand the board and reseal with a gloss finish. BUTTT the matte finish does look totally killer.
