I need to get rid of some things. Decided to go with bigger motors for a All Terrain setup. I need to make this a quick sell so I would like to sell everything in a combo. I need the money to buy my new 6374 motors.

What you see below is These are Maytechs 6355 190kv outrunners 
Ecalibers trucks one complete truck and one hanger. And one has torque board baseplate
Boardnamics motor mounts (can be mounted either way)
36/15 pulleys 280mm belts
4x 97mm Abec wheels

Wheels has about 200 miles on them. They were on my evolve GT for awhile
Motors has about 60 miles on them
 
Asking price-Sold
Only thing that doesnâ€™t come in the picture are is the orangatang nipples
