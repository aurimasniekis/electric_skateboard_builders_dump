so let me get this straight. you are selling a deck (not mentioned which one) a $170 outdated esc, 8s lipo, $40 trucks, skateboard wheels and some sort of pulleys for $1300?

your posts says no motor, remote or charger? so im confused af.

For perspective.  I built a similar board in 2015.  @Skunk sold his hummie build for the same money and that came with 2 motors.  Don't think this is going anywhere soon my friend.  Price revision needed.

I think it's a typo. Must have meant $130 or maybe $300, which would still be a stretch. Either way, a 4 digit price for a rolling mystery board can't possibly be right. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Maybe that's why it doesn't have a motor. It's got vinyl warp drive. Don't I know exactly what that is, but it sounds amazing. $1,300 actually sounds like a steal for warp drive. I wonder if you have to wrap yourself in vinyl for it to work though. :thinking:

If you can add pics of the other parts too, there is no sign of the motor mounting hardware or charger you mentioned, just the deck/wheels/trucks/enclosure

I suggest you part out everything if you want to _really_  get your moneys worth and not get roasted at the same time.

People here are really good at roasting sellers who are asking way too much for way too little (e.g. yours).

the deck is $130 new, esc $180 new, wheels are $60 new, lipos $100 new, mini remote is $35 new, trucks are $40 new, charger is $30 new.   I could buy this setup **brand new** for less than $575.    The fck are you smoking asking $1300, then $900 and now $700.

Motor has arrived quick speed test, only went comfortable speed, probably can go faster. Gearing is also updated to 18-35, has a ton of torque in my definition, can include 42th pulley too. Updated thread with pics
