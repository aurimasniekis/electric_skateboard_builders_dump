Just as mentioned I have 1 Evolve Bms , 1 remote and 2 150kv motors for sale. The motors were modified with 5mm bullet connectors and the sensor plug was replaced with a jst connection that fit a vesc 4.12 hense why the black wire is missing but still works. Also the trigger on the remote is damaged but works just needs to be replaced or glued in place. I'm hoping to get some funds so I can rebuild the board for my kids but I wont need these items since im going to build it diy style only thing i kept was the trucks wheels and enclosure. These other items r for grabs let me know if u r interested thanks will ship for free if bought in whole 

$30 for the remote +shipping

Yes thats correct 5065 150kv just changed the plugs from xt30 to 5mm bullet plug and the original sensor plug was also changed to fit on vesc because I changed to the racestar 200kv

If the remote comes with receiver and works on a normal ESC, I'll take it and a motor

doesn't come with a receiver and doesn't work with any old receiver, its specially designed for evolves bldc controller and connects straight to it (like a boosted)

Oof...so it's only good if you're making an Evolve? That's kinda useless...still interested in motors
