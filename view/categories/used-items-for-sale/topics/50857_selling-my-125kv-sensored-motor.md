Hi!
I have recently build an esk8 and got the hobbyking 125Kv motor.
![IMG_20171026_122531|375x500](upload://QuVDaL0Nxbivbfwi97R5c4gkLE.jpg)
The topspeed I get with 10S 15-36T and 83mm wheels is around 30km/h which is just to slow for me, I really like speeds around 35-45km/h so I selling this motor to switch to the keda 190Kv motor.
I did around 100km with this board and the motor still runs so smooth, has a lot of torque but just a bit to slow for my opinion.
Here are some pics of the motor.

The motor only has got some hits from gravel as you can see but works perfect. I have always 2 rubber rings around my motor to protect it if something should go wrong but nothing happened until now ðŸ‘Œ
i have made an ''adapter'' for the sensor wires so it fits in the single motor ebay esc but you can just unplug the wire to put the sensors in a vesc.

I would like to get around 50â‚¬ shipped (EU) so I can buy the 190Kv with the money.

There was no keyway in the box, I'm using 2 setscrews so I have 2 small flat spots on the shaft.
