On here i don't think anyone would pay much at all. You've made it clear that you hardly grasp how esk8 works. so i personally wouldn't trust the board as is. I'd see it as buying a pile of parts.

Also wasn't it just like 3 or 4 days ago you were asking if you could buy a flipsky? 

Did you really buy one, get it shipped to you and install it on a board in like 60 hours?

List all the parts and add their cost together.
Then take away at least 15% of the cost.
Because you're not a professional builder and no one's going to pay for your assembly skills.
You're not going to get your money back or make money selling the board.

Okay I'll take the bait

Board unknown $5
Bearings unknown $0
Hardware unknown $0
Flipsky used I'd take it for $25 
Dual hubs unknown $15
Legit 30Q 10S5P? $75-100
Battery safety inspection/rebuild -$0 to -$50 to -$100
BMS unknown $-15 to $10
Trucks unknown $3

Overall
Condition good? Add $20
Condition shit? Subtract $40

Could probably get more money if we knew what you actually had. Paris trucks used? $20 Caliber trucks used? $25? Shit Chinese trucks? $1... 

You do the math.

You don't really help yourself either.....
We CAN'T help you when you give us a vague information.
We don't WANT to help you when you have an attitude after us calling you out on things or just asking questions to clarify your vague questions. 
The problem isn't us......
The way you approach this fourm is.
I don't want you to leave or quit the fourm. 
I want you to listen, learn and be part of the community,  not feed off it asking random crap you're to lazy to look up or to stubborn to believe when you're handed the answers.

101 of selling items. 
List every detail you can possibly think of and always include pictures.
Also keep in  mind that earlier this week you made it very apparent that you are still learning the majority of what it takes to build an electric skateboard.
So when in less than a week later you make claims about selling a board, people are going to be questioning the situation.

Why are you listing a board that your not even trying to sell. My whole point here is, you‚Äôve painted a bad image of yourself. You fail to use the search bar, as well as literally have no knowledge on esk8. How can we trust to buy a board off of someone who has only asked noob questions, and creates new threads on questions already answered. If I where on your behalf, I would call it quits

creating new threads that don't add much to the community is definitely not a great way to make friends on here.
