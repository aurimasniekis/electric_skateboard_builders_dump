Hey all,

I have an original v1 Raptor Dual, with the battery rebuilt with all Samsung cells, along with an unused spare R-Spec 6374 motor, spare cover, belts, skate tool, ABEC Flywheels, with pads and helmet included:

![20181204_183500|666x500](upload://y2tJTfuWNRADlVGFVrzMk3sXceZ.jpeg) 

The battery has a faulty spot-weld in it, so the board is flaky right now.  With that fixed, it rips!

I'm selling because I've just got too many toys.  I don't want to deal with shipping, so the best local offer in the Denver, Colorado metro area (I'm in Boulder) takes the whole lot.

Thanks!

 - Fred

HAHAHA!!!  I've been strongly encouraged to edit the price.  Let's say $500.  That should get the deal done and clear out my workshop.  :grinning:
