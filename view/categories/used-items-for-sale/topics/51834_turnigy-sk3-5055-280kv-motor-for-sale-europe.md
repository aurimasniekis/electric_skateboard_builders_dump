Hello everyone!

I'm selling the Turnigy sk3 280kv 5055 bldc motor

I've been using it for about 2-3 months and now I'm upgrading it because my ecs has some sort of rpm limit so I need a lower KV motor.

Specs:
Turns: 18T
Voltage: 6~10S Lipoly
RPM/V: 280KV
Internal resistance: 0.031 Ohm
Max Loading: 60A
Max Power: 1510W
Shaft Dia: 6.0mm
Bolt holes: 25mm
Bolt thread: M4
Weight: 369g
Motor Plug: 4mm Bullet Connector

The price is about 40$ + shipping

I'm shipping it from Europe, Croatia
