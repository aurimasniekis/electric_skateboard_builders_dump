Imagine the mentality, they are gold, they make the board go broom. Must be worth a bomb.

Yeah these ainâ€™t gold and they ainâ€™t $600 ðŸ˜‚
I know thereâ€™s cheaper options out there but I figured Iâ€™m not using them and maybe someone wants OEM

That was the Pitbull dude that was trying to sell them.  The odd thing, I think _he did_ sell them.

I know the racerstars are drop in replacements. Not sure if Evolve just rebrands them

Racestars 200kv work just as good, Evolve products are way overpriced just cause of the Evolve brand. I bought some Evolve brand 107mm Abec wheels cause no one had them in stock when they first came out. love my 107's though.

In 2018 there are still people incapable of minting the gold....

These will be a tough sell my friend, new ones are less than $40 a piece.

EDIT: Actually, black and with those pulleys(steel, gates). It's not a bad deal.

No, these are black: 150kv, the Racerstar are 140kv or 200kv and are red/black.


You CAN use 140kv Racerstar motors as replacement but they aren't exactly the same as stock replacements.  You can also use the 200kv Racerstar motors as replacements -- but they are running the ESC beyond rated specs

Are there VESC kv measurements - would like to know if they are actually wound differently or just renamed.
Also I do have a full black Racerstar 5065 and you can also buy them on AliExpress so the color is not really different (they do have the kv printed on the side though)

Yeah Iâ€™m well aware that there are cheaper options for evolve. I only posted these in case someone was wanting OEM. The point about the steel gears is a good one as well.
Maybe Iâ€™ll just sell the gears separately lol.

I know for a fact there is a difference. Switched from stock evolve motors to the 200kv racerstars. I know the 200kv ones are close to 200kv(in vesc tool i think they were in the 190s), give or take.

Well if the stock motors are 150kv and you switched to 200 there is obviously a difference ;)
I was interested in 140kv to 150kv

Ahh i misunderstood.  Thought you meant no difference between their 140/200kv models.
