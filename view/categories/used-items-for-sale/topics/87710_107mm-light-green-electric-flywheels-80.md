Looking to get 100$ for the wheels, if not, I am real open to decent trades. Logo was scraped off for a cleaner look, extra wheel is an extra 20$. Disclaimer: this is not the flywheels sold everywhere. It requires a different pulley because the hub fits deeper into the wheel. You’ll need to design, or buy a different pulley for it. I also have a set of the dark green ones with the logo still on.

Shipping is quite expensive, it would be around 30-40 to ship

Some better photos might help? You mentioned dark green but those look light green?

@ChrisChaput made I believe 3 different colors of these wheels, light green, dark green, and the legendary pink

I personally don’t because I found out they require drive pulleys no one currently has. That killed it for me. The closest thing available would be 3D printed.

Maybe link here for some people doing new builds personally have extra set of wheels already in a box or I'd probably grab them.

@carrotstrip, since Michigan roads are pretty rough, you might want these wheels, they are super comfy and deal with bad roads greatly

Yeah I've heard great things, could somebody explain the whole drive pulley situation? I've got the DIY 15/36 drivetrain. Right now I'm rocking some 90mm flywheels clones, actually I think I also got those from DIY.

I had some on [the Blue One](https://forum./t/the-blue-one-12s-lifepo4-170kv-6374-caliber-2-30-43-powell-peralta-focbox/75) for a while and have them on another build

I like them but fitting pulleys is an issue

These are the widest 107mm wheels you can get

@pixelsilva, any updates, need some pulleys so these will sell lol, did you try to 3d print duplicate it?

@b264, you got any pulleys? Any 3d printables?

I got a half 3D printed @moon's version which sprockets fitted the hub pretty well. Teethed pulley section still needs to adapt from a previous design for Electric Flywheel.
