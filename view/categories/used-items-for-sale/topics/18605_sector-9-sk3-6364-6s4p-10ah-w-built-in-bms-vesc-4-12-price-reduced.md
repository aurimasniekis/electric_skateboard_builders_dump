I have a completed DIY SECTOR 9 board for sale. The specs are as follows:
Sk3 6364 245kv
LG 6s4p 10Ah (w/ built-in BMS)
VESC 4.12
Flywheels clones 83mm 78a
3D Printed Enclosure (100% infill of PETG; decently waterproofed for riding in rain but not puddles)
Caliber II 50 trucks
2.4 GHz Winning Remote
TB anti-spark toggle switch with blue LED on/off button
6S intelligent charger
Enertion motor mount
16/36 gear ratio, 12mm HTD 5M belt
Built-in LED headlight and tail lights
Voltage percentage LCD meter

Super fast and powerful ride with top speed up to ~22mph and hill climb ~15%. 12mm belt eliminates belt skipping and adds to increased torque for bombing hills. Range of this bad boy is about ~12-15 miles in one charge. Board is lightly used and shows minimum signs of wear/tear.

Asking for $740 OBO complete and shipped (US only). Will also include an extra 3D Printed enclosure for $10 more. All proceeds goes toward building a new mountain board. If interested, please PM me or reply below.

yes still available. And I can prob do $730 lowest price to you if you are committed to buy. Can't go any lower than that since I still have to factor in shipping cost (which is going to be a lot). This board costs me over $850 to make, esp with the 3D printed enclosure which eat up a lot of very expensive PETG filaments at 100% infill.

I don't normally sell things in parts, especially how the 3D printed enclosure is made specifically to this battery pack. But if you insist, I can do it for $620 without battery pack and the bms (they are attached).
