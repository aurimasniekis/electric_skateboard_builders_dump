Hello, I need some money  to finalize my 2 builds so i am selling the following parts:

1) Used and abused Koowheel gen 2 dual hubs with front and rear trucks and 97mm wheels (still working great) :  NOT FOR SALE ANYMORE. I removed the hubs from the trucks and they are still in perfect condition, i will keep them for a future built.

1) Almost new Koowheel gen 2 5500mah 10s battery. Used 2 times at most. I received it as replacement for my broken Kooboard battery about 2 months ago. It has now been +-1 one month since the last charge. I want to sell this one asap.--> 75Euro 

2) Koowheel gen2 dual esc for hubs (with remote) : Works flawlessly but Koowheel connector has been swapped to xt60 because i used a 10s5p battery with it instead of the standard one. Please note that the esc casing and the remote have been damaged because of an accident (Pics will come). Other than the visual damage the esc works without issues.
--> NOT FOR SALE ANYMORE , will keep it for a future build

3) Kooboard gen2 deck (to be restored as it could need a new paintjob , has many drilled holes ) --> 30 euro

4) Orange Single hub wheel (ordered from Banggood , 70mm i think , need to double check) . Never used  --> **SOLD**

parts are max. 6 months old but i have to admit i abused them a lot. Going full speed 80% of the time as i have long roads with almost no traffic in my neighbourhood :-)

Grtz!

Hello , that's ok for me. I am from Belgium. But i'll send you pics of the esc and the remote so you can take a look at what's damaged. It's only aesthetic and has no impact on the functionality but i prefer that you see it first. I might have a pic on my mobile (i am at work right now) will check and send it to you if i can find one . If not i'l lsend you pics this evening . I won't be at home before 7pm. Grtz

I found a pic of the remote but will need to take one of the esc. I'll do when i am back home. 
This is how the remote looks like:

battery:

The esc is still functional BUT has some damage because of a recent accident. The casing is scratched and the parts that can be screwed to the deck came loose (see pics) , i've also replaced the koowheel connector by an xt60 connector . Because i have 2 left hands and i really suck at soldering you might need to redo the xt60 soldering (but i don't think so ). Please take note of this before buying the esc! I am willing to do a refund in case you'll notice other issues but it really shouldn't be the case as i've tested it a few days ago and it worked flawlessly. Let me know if you want to see other pics :

Hello , will send you pictures when i am back home this evening , i'll take some close ups . Hubs should be ok but if you buy them you will really need to change the trucks. I used it with bent trucks and fell of the board because of whobbles (which never occured before the trucks were bent) . And it really hurts when falling at +35kmh...

same as you , i was going to use it on a small penny board (for my daughter) but i couldn't find the right trucks to use it. I am not sure but i think the maxfind hub trucks are compatible with the hubs.

Hello, still got them. I have some belt skipping and as you cannot change the belt tension on those trucks they became useless for me. I didn't have any belt skipping for months but now it always occurs even with new belts. I can let it go for 50 euro if you want them. But then I advise to mount the motors on other trucks. As it seems a few members broke those trucks while riding...i like the motors though. Was able to hit 50kmh with 97mms and hills were not an issue.
