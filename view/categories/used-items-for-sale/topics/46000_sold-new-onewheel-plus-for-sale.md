I hope this is allowed as it‚Äôs not a SKATE board. I just thought I might find someone in this community who‚Äôs interested. If take down is needed, I understand. 

$1,300 shipped in the 48 states...$1,250 if you pick up in Irvine 92618 with cash

Has under 5 miles on it. Decided to stick with skateboard after a few runs up and down smooth parking lot. Never took a tumble, just the gentle step off so it practically new. 

Included is the installed Craft and Ride Carbon Fiber fender ($140). I will ship it with original box

@pkasanda if you wanted a third one üòâ ![image|375x500](upload://g0QaOhnEA6SoESPsPS2rci9C0A2.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://i3j5IPdzqEiSWFZF7pEl9FJAvEf.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://2at55wAjCIAifoSDs12RcFIknIk.jpeg)

@pennyboard Irvine. 

Learning curve is there but everyone I talked to loves it after a week of riding. If you got the money and time to learn, go for it. I lack the time
