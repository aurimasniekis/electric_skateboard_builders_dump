Hello, I recently killed half of a maytech dual vesc. When turning on one day, it did not work any longer. I looked at it with a thermal camera, and it seems like one of the MCUs is dead.

If you want it, there is still one of the two VESCs in working order, and if you can fix it, you get a dual VESC.

I am in Denmark, so you should either pick it up in Aarhus or pay for the shipping.
