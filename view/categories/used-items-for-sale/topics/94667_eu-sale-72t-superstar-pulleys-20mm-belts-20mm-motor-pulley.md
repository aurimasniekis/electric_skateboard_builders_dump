I would if I could, but I do not have the juice to delete posts.  You'll have to ask Mamma, aka @anorak234.

I will do you a favor and make an offer since the prices are way to high, and without pics this post is useless.

$100 for it all.

Have I been unkind to you somewhere?

Please stop this nonsense.  Tomorrow you will see photos of the parts.  I have described each part well so those who are looking behind know what these are like and they can just look up on Google.

@pjotr47 do you still have the motor and wheel pulleys?
If you do, will you ship international?
