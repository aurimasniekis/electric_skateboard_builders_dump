Hey guys

Selling Maytech remote and receiver, works great.
Barely used, ordered it, tried it and decided to part with it.
The only thing I added is the shrink on the bare receiver, otherwise as new.

28$ shipped in US.

Thanks,
Dani

Hi
What other remote can be used with maytech esc. I have the same remote you sold and want to try something else. 
Thanks

Hey

If Maytech esc is like any other motor controller, you can use just about any other remote that's out there.
You can always use the newly released [fish hook](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fish-hook-in-reverse-thumb-option-for-the-mini-remote-files-added-01-18-19/79480) :slight_smile:
