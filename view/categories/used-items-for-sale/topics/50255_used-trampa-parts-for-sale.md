(SOLD) Ultimate trucks, asking 180usd plus shipping for the pair.

Comes with extra baseplate, two extra springs (four black, two red in total), extra set of spring retainers, extra pair of adjustment screws, an assortment of bushings (although some don't fit the housing very well, might need a little sanding), and an extra set of yellow dampas with 1/4 inch holes drilled down the centers for looser steering.

Some minor scrapes and scuff marks, but all in all they're in really good shape. Kind of embarrassing how little I've rode these things considering how much I've spent. Very little off-road use, and no jumping.

@High-roller mentioned the trucks, and @scepterr the drive, but otherwise they're up for grabs.  

Also... I still have this charger if anyone wants it (it's new in box) :smiley: Asking $170 plus shipping. I know, no one wants my charger :pensive: lol

(SOLD) I have a new set of 8" Primo Alphas somewhere too if anyone wants 'em, $50 plus shipping.

You mean 9 inch tires right?

I haven't, but I don't see any reason why you couldn't.
