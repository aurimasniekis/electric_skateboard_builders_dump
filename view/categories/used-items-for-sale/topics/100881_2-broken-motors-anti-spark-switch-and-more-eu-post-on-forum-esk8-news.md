Yo what is your problem dude.

From what I've understood half of the people went to the new forums and some people didn't. I'm just trying to sell my stuff. All the information is in there if u click the link...

If you're on the other forum don't spam us with your shit,

We don't have the endless sphere guys posting links to each product there selling and that's nice.

So If you're posting here have the decency to copy pase the info and allow people to PM you from this site.

Now i know that sounds a little harsh but I hope you get my point.

Sales is business and marketing costs money.
drooping links seems like a lazy way to boost sales and can be abused by other parties.
