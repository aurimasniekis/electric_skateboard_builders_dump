Lightly used Carvon V. 2.0 dual hub and matching front trucks set up for sale.  

Outer bearing have been changed from original to ceramic with the help of @Namasaki .
Inner bearing on one of the motors makes a clicking and will most likely need to be replaced.

I only got a  chance to put a few hours on these hubs.  

I am asking $300- US shipping only please.
