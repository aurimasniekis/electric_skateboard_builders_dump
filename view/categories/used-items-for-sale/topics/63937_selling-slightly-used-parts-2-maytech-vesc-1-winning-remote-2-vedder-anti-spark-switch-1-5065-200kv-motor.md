First is 2 Maytech VESC, i started this project a while back so the left VESC is the first one i purchase and back than alot of people mention its a good idea to put some heat sink on the fets which i did, i dont know if its still a thing or not i used some heat sink glue and its stuck on pretty good so i didnt bother taking them off.

right VESC $80 ~SOLD

next is 2 Veddar Spark one is unused and the other you can see im using it in the video.  the unused one does not come with fuse but it comes with the pins to hold the fuse but you would have to solder it yourself it came to me like that so i never used it. the other one is all set to go. both come with an LED latch switch.

I'd take the unused anti spark, if you'd consider shipping to the UK? It shouldnt be more that $5-10 to ship in a small bubble envelope (I bring my bearings over from the states to UK all the time and a couple of tubes of bearings costs somewhere in that region.

Many thanks

Might be interested in that Racerstar Motor.  I see you already changed out the stock connectors, what size connectors did you put it?  Also, do you have the motor gear for this?
