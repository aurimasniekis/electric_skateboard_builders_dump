Hey guys, throwing my metroboard up. It’s a great, reliable board as a back up, for friends and family or if you’re crazy enough (or lucky enough) to get the gf/wife to join the hobby. 

Comes with the 25mile range battery, dual 6374 motors, 97mm ABEC Flyeheels and the 10W lights. It’s a really nice package and will hang with quite a few of the DIYs around here. Had considered swapping everything into a Haya or other deck but trying to reduce my esk8 addiction to a more reasonable 7 boards.

Cupped washer and barrel not included, will come with caliber red barrel/cup bushings.

Located in Los Angeles and asking $1275. Local pick up only
