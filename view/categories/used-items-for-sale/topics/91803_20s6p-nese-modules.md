Putting this here in case someone does bikes too :) I have 20S6P kit that was intended for my cargo bike. Driven 200 meters  and crappy BMS drained my cells dry over winter. I am building new one, only larger.
Modules are in bright red color and include everything to build 20S6P battery pack. Very easy to build and even easier to take apart to swap cells. The kit is reusable and can serve for a lifetime of human.
List:
20 6P modules (bright red)
19 series bus bars
19 twin bolt caps (blue)
2 single bolt cap (orange/blue)

Thanks, but these are for another buyer.
I was only interested in the 20S6P module, although I preferred a 20S8P module :slight_smile:

I have some 8P modules which are discolored, has brownish tint. I had smoke situation in my workshop and plastic sucked some of it in. I need to see how many i have and i can make 50% off on them. Only thing wrong with them is color.
