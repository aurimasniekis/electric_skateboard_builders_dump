Hola everyone,

After few months riding my beast I have taken the decission to part it out and build a lighter & safer short AT board. 

So the main item to be sold in this thread is the **Raptor 2.1 R-Spec dual hub drive kit** (everything included but the Unity) I purchased on the Black Friday @ 12/2018 [ **SOLD SOLD SOLD** ]

Then I also have following stuff from previous builds/intents that I would like to sell as well: 

- **Jet Spud from BKB** imported to Spain with black griptape, used couple of times as regular skateboard so no enclosure holes were ever made [ purchased for 75€ + import taxes | **SOLD** ]

- 10x HDT5M **330mm 12mm belts** [  **1x7€ | 2x12€ | 3x15€ | 10x40€**  ]

  ![image|281x500,50%](upload://joyh9lrzx3JeZAHfZTmz31nmqtN.jpeg) 

- 2x **Dual FocBox 3D printed holder** [  **1x10€** | **2x15€** ]

  ![image|281x500,50%](upload://mgFVuORl4Zc1vR1UN6qgw9Vp4UH.jpeg) 

- 2x black **Caliber 50 trucks**, used a couple of times mounted on the Spud, few minor scratches [ **40€** ]

New things on the list:

- **SPACE CELL ELITE** from Enertion, less than 100 charging cycles, good shape. Balance wires connector was changed to match the BMS one [ **200€** ] 

- **BMS Bestech HCX-D223V1** for 10s battery [ **50€** ]

  ![image|690x388,75%](upload://8spDIRLQIVUUGTnwuTwbYunkFUh.jpeg) 

- **[Moonshine Hooch](https://www.sickboards.nl/es/longboards/6448-moonshine-hooch-deck-only.html)** 38"/97cm downhill lightweight **deck + enclosure + charging port + switch** with inserts and holes done, neoprene and rubber gaskets included. Good shape in general, the ride is awesome! [ **160€** ] pictures in few minutes

All these prices are without shipping cost from Madrid (Spain) and without the fee for f&f on Paypal, both to be paid by the purchaser. 

Even tho I did not write a lot on this forum, I was an active member of the other one, you can check my profile here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/Lobap

Cheers,

I will ask but I guess too much, shipping batteries overseas is usually expensive.
