After becoming obsessed with esk8 and going through tons of different configurations over the past couple of years, I've finally settled on a couple builds that I'm keeping, and I'm getting rid of everything else.

Everything works perfectly and is at least 8 or 9/10 condition. The hubs have all been used less than 50km each.

I've basically taken the current new prices, chopped 'em in half, and added approx shipping from Canada. I'm hoping the prices seem fair.

_All prices in USD (includes shipping to USA/Canada. International probably not worth it?)._


**6" airless AT wheels (fits pretty much all hubs out there): $50**

**Single belt ESC (6~10S, currently 10S) w/remote: $35**

The max watts on the 90mm hubs is 500  per wheel right? Have you pushed them farther than that at all?

Yup, 500W/75kv.

I only ever used them with the Chinese ESCs, which surprisingly packed some punch.

Most things are pending sale at the moment. I think only Skullboard stuff is left. I'm about to have a crazy busy work weekend, but I'll have everything settled by Monday.

Are you still selling?
I live near Toronto (hopefully that's reduce shipping price). 

Is the **Skullboard 105mm hub kit w/ESC and remote** still available? 
Does that also include the front truck?

Yes, that includes the front truck, and that's actually one of the last things left! I'll shoot you a pm.
