I am selling two vescs which are NOT working. One appears to need a new DRV chip and the other one had a short of the uart port. Thy are both HW 4.12 with bootloaders. One was purchased from DIY and the other from APS. Asking $80 OBO plus $7 shipping for ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. Also contact me if you could do the repairs on them please ðŸ˜‰![image|666x500](upload://b8ZnWSxQIHyd8Oi4ss1CUIKQae9.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://6CLZKeWbb5Tp55VqxskwnVkCYC8.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://qshWfjZjg8WU6Bakkpa7i5ufrXE.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://rpq2SSdsoOwdqLCERNhUc8ofy1Q.jpeg)

Itâ€™s usually $50 each, but depending on what all needs to be replaced I can discount between $10-$20 off for doing both together
