10S10P is INSANE, sick build. Those fans made me laugh a little though, wouldn't they restrict and offroading you can realistically do quite a lot?

Nice build :)

Just really baffled why the open fans? - not only that but super expensive noctua ones when all other noises will still drown out any fan no matter how loud :-/ one little pebble and they're dust - plus they're constantly being thrown off axis so the bearings wouldn't last long...

10s10P for 400â‚¬ wtf.  I would buy this instantly but 100km on hubs would kill me. 50km already knocked me out.

Be careful, i had my worst injuries on a onewheel, banged up my knees up pretty good, many times. 
If you decide to part things out I might take some stuff of your hands ;)
