samsung 30Q battery - brand new cells, from Nkon eu - 4 eur for cell

12S battery with bestech 80A bms with e-switch - I will build you a battery! I like building batteries and I have spare bms for one more battery. I know I have no battery building reputation here, so my price will be quite cheap and I will post all photos of battery building process in this thread as proof of methods I will use. I will use 0.2mm x 12mm nickel strip (maybe few layers, depends on cells layout), fishpaper between series, insulation rings and connections between series groups will almost always be made with 2 silicone wires. on photos you can see stuff that I will need in battery building process except jst connectors, kapton tape,foam and hot glue. price is 70 eur for bms + 4.80 eur per cell. for example, if you want 12s4p, that will be 70 + 4 * 4.80 = 300.40 eur. on/off switch and charging port included. I can add LED on/off switch for 3 eur and battery % display for 5 eur. - not enough batteries left! order if you are ready to wait two weeks for shipment of new batteries from nkon

shipping inside EU is from 10 to 20 eur with tracking, depending on weight of package.

paypal preferred

Where were you one week ago? I was looking for the supercarves! (Both a pair brand new) Coincidentially I got Xanex lights too. Could you share the 3D files for the lights mountings?

I asked if @Tinp123 could make me some 4P packs so I could build a 10S4P battery myself using these battery PCBs. Sure enough he could, the packs came out great and they were decently priced. Also Tin is a very nice guy to deal with. Can definitely recommend!

Love me some battery *pr*on, buuuuut

* maybe just pass along to place more distance between the welds? I think that spacing them out is recommended 

![image|690x152](upload://svGocKzJ2k5bdpEHBbUKANq81As.jpeg)

Heres a good example from @Eboosted website, 

![image|690x119](upload://hac6GSWsJtarr5BfCM4JLwaZa7L.jpeg) 

Your cells seem fine, just spreading awareness that spotwelding as much as possible  isnt a good idea

God damn.  I could use the Hobbywing ESC and the Nano remote IF i can get them to work. Again Money i don't really want to give awa, but the prcies are good! (Is the hobbywing the 2 Mode or 3 Mode version?

On @Eboosted batteries, wider space between spots is on second layer of nickel. I am using spot welding guide from member of this forum. 
@Sn4pz  Why do you think there can be too much spot welds? I feel more secure when I put them more than 2 or 3 pairs.

@xsynatic there is no way to connect hobbywing esc with nano remote! You can only use remote which comes with esc, or similar hobbywing remote.

[/quote]


Well, its been shown that increased heat entering the cell from spotwelding isnt great for the cells, so its best to limit the amount of spot welding, and focus on a few cash money welds that will hold your strip just as well as the batteries you have 

Additionally I think theres something to be said about spacing out the welds that you make so itll hold better in terms of stress and strain on the welds(sort of talking out of my bum here, but it makes sense in my head :man_shrugging: )

to be clear, I dont think your battery is bad at all. Im just offering my thoughts on it. Its certainly not this beast ( i was gonna post a link but im struggling to find it. )

Yes you have point about heat, but I do only 2-3-4 welds on each cell at once, and then repeat it after some time. Cells are maybe warm to touch, but not hot.
About strain, I am not even sure how could we measure that? My logic was, more welds = better connection
```

Well, they say that you shouldnt be able to rip your welds off with just your hands

Thats the only good 'strength check' I can think of

## \#16 Posted by: xsynatic Posted at: 2019-02-28T20:49:40.068Z Reads: 124

no no, thats correct. I mean connecting the nano remote to my own receiver.

How about the hobbywing ESC/Remote 2 or 3 speed modes?
```

## \#17 Posted by: Tinp123 Posted at: 2019-02-28T22:16:28.093Z Reads: 125

3 speed mode. But if you have any esk8 experience, you won't use 1st and 2nd speed cause there is no point in them :D
@Sn4pz yes you are right, but it is not possible to check every weld that way :D

I'm currently on the fence if i want to order either a 10s4p (or 5p) and/or a 12s4/5/6p from you now or wait until @pjotr47 takes orders again. 

Both of you seem to do a great job. Pjotr has a higher Reputation if i may say so, but it could take months i assume until orders are open again.

Yes, I understand! He builds perfect batteries and I am new battery builder, also I am a little bit slow with building, but I think I have best prices. I will take photos of building process, so you will know every part of your battery :)

The 2 batteries from meepo are they both using the same cells?
I was thinking buying both and putting them in parallel.
And are all cells still alive? :slight_smile:

nop, they are different cells. in one battery they are samsung, in other they are panasonic. but I had them in parallel almost all the time, and they did work. you can charge them both through charging port of working bms, without disconnecting them.

@PaulRocco hobbywing esc is from ownboard, you can see it in my post in 3d printed enclosure :slight_smile: . but it is sold.

Hi for everyone looking at this thread I have recently bought a 12s5p battery from @Tinp123 and it is great really impressed with service and quality 

Also he built me an enclosure and printed a bunch of parts

All for a really fair price

Definitely worth going to him
