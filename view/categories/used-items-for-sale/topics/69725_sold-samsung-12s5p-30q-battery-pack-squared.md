I hereby sell my 5 months old 12s5p battery, which I bought at Eskating.eu!
I have fully charged the battery 5 times, so it's like new!
If you want to see pictures, then I can put some into the forum!
The battery includes a 2A charger, the battery and a matching housing!
The newprice what about 600 € with housing!
I sell it for 400 € without housing and with housing I would like to have 450 €!
Best regards ;)
