I have a VESC from  I just purchased that has a bad DRV chip that needs to be replaced.  If anyone knows how to fix this themselves and wants a cheap VESC this is a great option as nothing else is wrong with it.

I do not want to undergo the repair myself and I am going to purchase a FOCBOX to replace it. I would take $40 for it with free shipping anywhere in the US.  I can also ship internationally for pretty cheap.  (I run an online store and I get reduced shipping rates depending on the country.)  Message me best offers.
