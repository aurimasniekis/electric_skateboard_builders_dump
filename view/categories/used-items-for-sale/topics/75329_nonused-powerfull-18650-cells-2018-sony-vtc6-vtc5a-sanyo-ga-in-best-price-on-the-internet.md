Looks good and it happens I'm in EU too.

No offense but almost too good to be true, and you're pretty new member. Yet as long as you're fair then great. 

Anyone can vouch for @silaczdotoalet?

Can you estimate shipping for 40 cells to US? (This is a fairly common case I think)

I think he means, if he wants 2000, cells do you have?

VTC5A are better than VTC6 in my opinion. Have lower capacity but more life cycles. VTC6 under 10A are hot, VTC5A even not. There are the coldest cells on the market under 10A from 18650 probably, lower temperature = more cycles. All depends on config
