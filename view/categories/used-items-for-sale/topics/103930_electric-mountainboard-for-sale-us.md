Time to let go of one of my boards, just have too many and not enough time. I am located in Tampa, FL and would prefer someone local but am willing to ship in the US. I will keep this board before I part it out so please don't ask. 

Asking $1400 for everything - my zip is 33615 for shipping quotes - I can get weight and dimensions later if needed as well. 

I can accept credit cards through my business for an extra 3% fee, same with paypal. Otherwise cash, venmo, zelle, etc... Locals are welcome to take it for a spin first as well!!

This setup has less than 100 miles on it and I purchased everything new, all work done in house including the battery. I've ridden this board 25 miles on a single charge (170lbs), its quick and it handles amazing.

Awesome! You have no idea how long I'm trying to get pulleys for my twistar hubs.. Can you print and sell a couple? I've found you design (i think) but can't find a company here to print those for me. Let me know if you can sort me out since that part is the only one missing on my diy project.

Same motors. Same bindings. Same hubs.. Only deck, escs and battery are different. I thought about getting new hubs to finish this project but maybe now i can finish it if you can help me.

Sorry work has been killer - just uploaded them here: https://www.shueboxed.com/file-share/04f2df22-be84-468a-adf9-f6775818946b 

It's the zipped STL file

File is here for 66t for MBS hubs - with the twistar hubs you can change gears without having to deflate the tires too. You'll want to install heated brass inserts for the screws to keep everything lined up.

If you PM me your shipping info I can get you a total price for a set of this shipped to you.

You got 25 miles of range on pneumatics with a 10S4P 30Q battery? That seems super unrealistic.

I am likely going to keep those for another build I have planned - I am taking them out this weekend, if I don't get any hits on it I'll be posting parts for sale next week.
