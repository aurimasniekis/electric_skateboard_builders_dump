Up for grabs is my latest build. 
I find the deck a little short for me so I’m building a Landyachtz Evo. 
Here’s the build in a little more detail. 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-truncated-tesseract-calibers-popocas-6355s-focbox-5x-2s-graphene-lipos-10s-custom-fibreglass-enclosure/40933

I’d like to sell as a complete but would consider selling the deck, enclosure and power pack inc bms as a unit.
Then I can build up the raptor deck from secret Santa with the drivetrain. 
I’ve not used it much so it could be considered nearly new. 
3 cycles on the battery and wheels still shiny. 
It’s super quick fun little board. Set up with 15 tooth 32 at the moment so I’ve never been close to top speed. 
For the brave it should top 30mph. 
I’m based in Dorset UK.

How do you charge this? I see you have a bms for the battery - is it just a power brick?

Do I need to tension the belts, or is this not required on your system?

Will you include a remote?

Thanks

Hi,
Yes it has a bestech bms so charges with a charger and jack plug. I have a 4a charger with it and has a mini remote.

@Pavel I’m into this for over £1k so would listen to an offer of £850.
Edit, forgot the costs of motors in this math!

Hi,
I’m in the UK. I don’t want to break it up just yet unless someone wants the deck and battery pack/enclosure because this wouldn’t suit my next build.

I knew I’d forget something when calculating...
Forgot motors in my calculations.. well over £1100 build not including connectors and wire etc.. oh well.
Price still stands at £850.

I like that one very much!
Does the enclosure fit the Cantellated Tesseract?
Can you tell me which motors, motor mounts, pulleys and belts you used?
Trucks are 50° base?

PS: no offence, but you should think about using bushing that fits your weight and riding style instead of tighten the stock ones up that much. This would be the proper way to adjust your truck :)

Hi @Luuke,
no offence taken. Mr seasonal postman has lost all trace of hard bushings.. I need all the help I can get though.
I have no local shop to talk to or no crew to mix and match what works and what doesn't. So suggest away...

I pinged an email to Loaded a few weeks back to see if the two decks were made on a similar mould but they never got back to me. They do look a pretty similar shape.
The trucks are 50' base (calibers), the mounts are enertion clones, belts currently 12mm but have 15mm coming.
15mm steel pulleys bearing loctited to the shafts. Wheel pulleys are alien power systems 32 tooth aluminium.(15mm) Motors 6355mm unbranded but I think you'll recognise them in quite a few of the esk8 vendors.
```

You could change to 44° for more high speed stability.
Or try different bushings (duro and shape). But that's up to you.
Maybe @Alphamail can help you here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bushing-set-up-help/42036/11

Motors are 190KV unsensored?

As @taz already said a list of enclosures would be very helpful. With measurements and everything. So one could estimate which one to choose.

That would be greatly appreciated

I have dual 6355 with 12s3p and they are quite scary on such a small deck.

IMO you do not need any more power in the Tayto but ofcourse your case might be different.

Nothing really.
The only things that I would (and I will) will change is the wheels (I have some 77a caguama on the way) to make the ride softer and some e-calibers so I can run 12 or 15mm belts.

You will have to get creative with the battery layout.
I think a very good solution (possibly the only one) is to use the layout @eboosted used on his moonshine sidekick

Not in that case. If you can fit it in a single stack enclosure why go double stack?

For me the Tayto is a small deck that I chose to build it as light and portable as possible. There are a lot of better decks if you want to go for range, speed etc.

Do you think the 10s4p can fit in the single stack case ?. I got a Unity coming in sooner or later so i would use a 10s4p + Unity + Receiver + bms in there. Do you Maybe have a Picture of the interior size of the Tayto single stack enclosure ?

I believe you can fit it. It is going to be tight though and will require very careful wire management.

There are pictures at my thread and you can also find more if you do a search.

@bigben is also making an enclosure for the Tayto that may have more space available.

Not exactly but considering that I had to modify my battery to fit without a thick gasket, I would say approx. 20mm taking into account the concave of the deck
