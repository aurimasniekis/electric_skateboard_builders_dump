As the title states, i'm selling two of my Alien Motors.
They were intended for a project but i won't have time to finish it.
They have XT150 Bullet connectors soldered to them (caps in black and red)
The only runtime they have was the motor calibration with an VESC-X at 6S.

I will add pictures shortly.

Selling from Germany.
Shipping international for 14€ (9€ without insurance)
National for 5€
PayPal preferred

I was about to build an all terrain board.
Since every application uses a reducing gear i figured to go for a low kV Motor so i don't have to use a 12 tooth pulley in any of my boards.
This with 12S and only 1:2 gear is fast.

Great motors for an AT build, so you don't have to gear down that much.
