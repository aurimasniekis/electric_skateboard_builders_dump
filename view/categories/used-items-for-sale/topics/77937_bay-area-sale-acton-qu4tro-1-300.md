haha, I wasn't ever able to get to a group ride with you to try it out. Was always curious how this thing performed.

Still think 30% grade is a bit exaggerated. It's hard for any urathene wheel to even get enough grip to go up a hill that steep.

Maybe I can catch it in a group ride before you sell it!

lol, that is based on testing from others that I've ridden with. The reason being, at least in SF, steep roads are made of concrete, and it seems like they haven't touched it in 50 years, so your gona bounce all over the place.

Maybe if you had a decent quality road, it's possible. Also depends on your weight.

I've yet to see anyone, besides Baja Board, post a video going up a 30% grade hill for any length of time. Enertion did a steep one that got really steep for like, 5 seconds, but that wasn't sustained.

A lot of it is the difference in Concrete and Asphalt, concrete is a much denser particulate so friction is less.

That right there is probably it. I've just never seen a 30% grade hill made of Asphalt... But I'm sure they exist somewhere outside of San Francisco.

I kind off feel like it might be a hard sell to sell this on a builders forum. Totalling the parts value, you're looking at:
$150 ESCs w/ remote
$200 4x Hub motors w/ trucks
$250 Battery, less with cycles
$250 CF AIO Deck, like the raptor 1 deck. Its hard to quantify the deck's value

All together, new thats about $850 for a builder to make something similar. There is merit in selling the board as one and things, but people here don't tend to buy prebuilts, we're here because the building process is part of the fun :) I should clarify your price is not bad at all, its just you might be trying to sell to the wrong crowd of people.

You might have better luck selling on ebay, craigslist, facebook or other local marketplaces in SFSC.

![Image result for 30% grade](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Slope_quadrant.svg/2000px-Slope_quadrant.svg.png)

30% grade isn't that unbelievable with four motors. I have a small hill like that in front of a dollar store parking lot near my house. I guess they needed to elevate the land for drainage but then they were like "oh shit, now we have a penssylvania driveway, oh well, fuck it." We roll up it slowly just to give the motors a nice warm up.

I think Tompkins St. is the king here in SF. But my back street (Taylor St.) comming up from Fisherman's Wharf to Grace Cathedral is 13¬∞ gradient and that is 25% !! So there are some nasty climbs here all over the plce.

That is true, there's steep hills everywhere. But 30% is pretty insane...

This is Jones between Filbert and Union St (supposedly a 29% grade hill). Looks just as steep in real life:
