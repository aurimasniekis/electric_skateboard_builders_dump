Hello Guys!
I wanted to build a Firefly esk8 remote, but than i changed my mind and bought an other one. 
A friend printed it for me and i had to pay 10â‚¬.
If you're interested, please make me an offer!
Greetings, Jonny

It is probably not worth the effort to ship internationally for a low cost part.  I will look for a source to print in the US.  Thanks,
