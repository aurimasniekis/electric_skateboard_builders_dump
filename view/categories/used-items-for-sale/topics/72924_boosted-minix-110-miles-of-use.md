I have about 120 miles of flat road commuting to work with no abuse. My roomate got squirrely on a start and the board rolled and slid a foot or two upside down, so there are some very minor scuffs on the top edges. otherwise, perfectly good. I am selling to pay rent because a client of mine didn't pay me as promised. I will include pics when I get back from work. 

I am located in ANDERSON, SC. Hope for a local sale, but will talk shipping.

$850.

Edit: Number removed, please send DM for questions.

Just some help here. Your board is likely worth about $500 - $600 dollars on this forum unfortunately. Also a picture or two are both super helpful and required to sell.

That doesn’t help at all. I’d rather wait to see if anyone is interested and lower the price than to have you start a lowball auction.

LOL we're just messing with you. But seriously, not many of us on this forum would pay what you would like to get. I think you'll have a better chance on Facebooks groups where there are non builders. Best of luck

I am wondering if this is still for sale. If so, I would offer $500 for it.

I like how everyone openly hates boosted (like android fanboys hate apple) but secretly always want one
