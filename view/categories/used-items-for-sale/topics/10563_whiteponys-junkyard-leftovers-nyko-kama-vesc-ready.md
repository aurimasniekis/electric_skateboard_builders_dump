I really collected too much stuff during the last 2 years and its time to clean up again. I got a few items I just dont use anymore - usually always because they have been replaced by something I liked more. Other times, I simply had spare items from shipments from china, AUS or US.

Ill keep updating this post - there are a few items left that I havent put up and there will be new items from current boards that will become new leftovers.

**Important: shipping EU only!**


* oldschool enertion 9mm flywheel/generic mount: 20€

* new grab handle 15€

* nyko kama with 100% plug n play VESC receiver module (fits right into any new vesc and sits ontop of it. all wires directly soldered, hot glued and shrink tubed - this is as solid as a nyko kama gets). loved this one and worked great until I started working with a lot of carbon. within 100% carbon enclosures, the reception was too bad so that I started using 2.4Ghz mini remotes. not easy to get in europe, 40€ for this mint condition setup.

* now this item is complicated and Im not sure if I want to sell it --- but Ill leave it here and you can offer me whatever you want. Its my Loaded Cantellated Tesseract with a DIY 10S4P battery, vesc, mini-remote, routed carbon enclosure with sunk in motor wires. build thread is VERY lengthy: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=75291

and starts to become interesting here: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=75291&start=75#p1170801

batteries are still in great shape (also with balancing cables), the board rides gorgeous and looks great (yea, I couldve cleaned it up a little ...). currently the rear truck with the drive train is used in my jet spud, but we can talk about everything. I still got an enertion mount with 6355 rspec and 15/16T 9-15mm motor pulleys. ah well, just throwing it in this mix - if you are interested in parts or just the board or the complete with trucks and drive train just message me.

hehe, getting spammed a little with PMs. please use google for estimated shipping costs, takes about 1min (shipping from germany)! and please no "I started this build and I wonder if I could use anything from your parts ...?" or similar ..  :smile:

basically I put them up too cheap I guess - noone has transferred paypal yet, but I got a LOT of people interested. currently reserved for a guy who wants more items at the same time (convenient for me, cause I dont even have so many boxes for shipping :smile: )

i had a lot of requests about the board and i wasnt home all day, so i wont be able to answer all today anymore. got someone interested and price seems to be working for both sides (750€ as complete without charger & without wheels, 600€ when i send it without trucks, mount & motor).

Hey Simon,

do you have anything left that would add to a vanguard build ? Iam also from Germany and your vanguard build inspired me to actually start this thing :) So I actually have nothing besides a 6374 for my single setup and the deck. I'd be great if you have any parts left for sale that would help me get this going. Since you are also located in Germany I figured I'd give it a try and ask you.

best regards,

Phillipe
