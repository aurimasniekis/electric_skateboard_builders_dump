Incase some of u didn’t see the ad on the other forum so here it is:

As u saw in the title, I used the battery only for the summer so it’s not heavily used, with hub motors I got about 30km of range. Bms is from a meepo board battery. Asking for 200€ for the battery+shipping. If u also need the enclosure (evolve stock enclosure) I can give u a great deal for both of them
