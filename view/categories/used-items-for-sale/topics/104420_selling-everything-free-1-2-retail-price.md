Wassup Boys,

I've got some new projects that I'm gonna be needing some cash for and wanna let all these parts go as I never really got into e-boarding as much as I would have liked. I'm in Australia by the way, but anything that isn't a battery I am happy to ship internationally if you pay the $.

All items are barely used or not used at all.

First up, 10S3P battery made with Samsung 25R (from memory). This was based off of someone's design on here (I forgot their name). The battery is split across two sides and connected at the end. Aus only. It includes a BMS and charger.

The remaining things I'd like to sell for 1/4 to 1/2 of retail price depending on what you think is reasonable:

Hummie Hubs with Arsenal Trucks and Otang Kegels (epoxy job wasn't the best with these)

2x Enertion VESC 4.12 ESCs (never used)

Benchwheel Remote and Receiver (used once)

Mini RC Car Remote (used a couple times)

TB 12S ESC with BEC rated for 6S

Drop down deck from Ebay

Psychotiller Enclosure that fits two 4s batteries and an ESC (comes predrilled)

Globe Concave Deck (about 36-38")

Pics are on post 16 or 17 of this thread

Send me offers over DM. Hope this stuff gets some good use.

The hummies are the old style ones, yeah? Not the super wide recent version with the grey urethane?

Still at school bud and I have sport commitments (it's only 1pm here, last time I checked afternoon is anytime between 12 and 6?). I've let everyone know that the pictures are coming. Didn't know there was a specific way to sell stuff on a public forum. If you're a mod I'm happy to change it.

You can replace the thane but you have to have the new thane to install. The thane for these was made in Hummieâ€™s kitchen by pouring himself. Youâ€™d have to see if he had the moulds and was willing to do it, or pick up a set if someone had some spare from a few years ago..

Theyâ€™re from long ago the small motors.   I do have some extra tires that fit.  I donâ€™t know what he means by the epoxy.  Could be motors I sunk in blue thermal epoxy.

I have a couple I can give u free. But I donâ€™t sell them anymore for reasons. Hard tires that deteriorate, hot motors, small bearings, thin axle,..  but I thought they were great then and if u donâ€™t over-push them theyâ€™re good and will be fine.  Donâ€™t get above maybe 150f on outside max and make sure the tire is still not damaged from heat and loose

By the epoxy, I mean the Omega Epoxy. When I did one test ride one of the hubs came loose, maybe because it heated up too much and the epoxy holding it to the axle loosened. ![15753167100102408841970851187551|375x500](upload://9DYzujjfmw0V2B3hjylIg5yECBx.jpeg)

If you got the motors hot enough you could probably take them off. Otherwise, just run them on a lower voltage (I was on 12S) and they won't get that hot
```

Is it possible to redo the epoxy and put some more on?

I would say so. Just use epoxy for extreme heat.

It's possible but if you're running 10S or under you probably won't need it
