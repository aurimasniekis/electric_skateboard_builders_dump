Hello, I dont know if this is the right submenue but it Will do. So I have a dilemma that I am stuck with in my build. I have to ammount if cells for two packs of 8s3p one is 30q cells and the other one he2

The thing is that they are brand new cells and I tried solder the pack since I don’t have acces to a spotwelder. It worked I think but not good.

Keep in mind I have never put the pack in a build the have half finished solder points on apx half the pack and the rest is untuched. So thing is that I find it difficult and do not know what to do since I cannot do anything with the packs so here are alternatives and I want to check intreates

1 Find someone to help spotweld and fix the packs 

2 sell the packs at its current good state( brand new) 
and buy lipo instead

3 try to solder the whole thing.

I’m just sick of it taking such long time so what you guys think? If you have a bid pm or something

The 30q pack is identical

It looks like your soldering iron is not powerful enough. Id suggest desoldering and finding someone with a spotwelder, those solder joints dont look good.

Agreed, doesn't look like the solder flowed proper at all.

Ouch...  Yes - iron is not hot enough.  Unfortunately when you "cook" a cell to get the solder to flow you can damage them...  So i'd be careful and monitor for any damaged cells when you get it finished.

I also suggest a bit of flux - stuff helps a ton!

Where are you located?  Maybe someone can lend you a spot welder, or a better soldering iron that can do it quickly w/ plenty of watts to avoid damaging cells?

I'd tear it apart and start over.  you can test the resistance of the cells if you want to confirm none are damaged.

I vaguely recall someone who had done some calculations on heat damage for 18650 cells and to greatly simplify... i think you need to have your solder done in just 2-3 seconds or you are risking damaging the cell.  Maybe they'll chime in, but hopefully this gives you an idea of how quickly you need to move on each cell.

that's about right. 

its tricky to solder packs, it takes flux and a hot iron and some quickness. Itsd way riskier than tacking them, but decent spot welders are hard to find.

This is the spot welder i got and its from the same guy i got mine from. I went back through my ebay history to find it for you. 

It's been a real champ.

I forgot to take the picture, but mine is defeinitely set to 40.2 and the current knob is on 10 because i use 15 mil nickel strips and that's about the most these things can handle. Even then i have to manually add pressure in addition to the spring pressure sometimes to get a solid weld.

The pressure knob on top is pretty crap too.. Like it turns forever, how do you know when you reach max pressure?? I'm surprised there's no quality standard product available on the market.

that knob is useless. Sometimes i tell new people visiting the shop that i need them to turn it while i'm welding a pack or the pack won't weld correctly, so they turn it while i'm tacking something useless and inside i'm laughing. 

I have made a pad on top of the two probe arms with a piece of gauze and some blue tape that allows me to press down on the arms with my finger tip (and not burn it) while holding one side of the pack with the rest of my hand, so i can get a quick three tacks in (for the six spots per cell i do) rather quickly and i know that they took and won't tear off at the first impact on the box.

you mean the 709A with the wand? not enough juice. it just won't weld that 15 mill with the wand. It needs to be modified with that arduino and lead acid battery mod. I have a 709A in the drawer waiting to mod so i can have a decent wanded welder.

I realize now that these things are meant for making vapes and rc car batteries and shit where the strips are thin and tiny and don't have to carry 44 volts at up to a 100 amps before blowing a fuse or tripping a BMS without wicking up like toilet paper on a stove.

i'm going to have to start getting that shit by the bag of cut strips pretty soon. It takes to long to cut the strips i need to build a whole pack. OR invest in a strip cutter and start getting giant reels. If i did that i'd be selling pre-cut strips for sure.

its two pack with two different cells but same layout.

I want a cheap solutions, so buying a brand new spotwelder isn't going to work out but I really appreciate you taking your time @longhairedboy

Let us know what you find. Best i can tell, and based on my own personal experience, there is no cheaper solution than that spot welder if you want to not permanantly damage your cells while building a nice pack. 

but since you will risk it, make sure you get a high wattage iron, 60 watts minimum. should find that for under $30. And some flux, maybe $6 for that on amazon. And some 50/50 solder from amazon too. And you might want to try the hole punch trick, that seems to work well for me when i don't have a choice but to solder a strip down. A decent hole punch can be had at walmart for maybe $5. 

basically you punch a hole in the strip with the hole punch then flux the inner edge of the hole and the cell top then spread the solder in along the edge. you have about 2-3 seconds to get it right before you start to lose charge cycles. But if you do it right, you have a very low profile solder weld that looks pro and won't fail. 

good luck and skatanspeed.

I was planing on findung someone that could send the packs to. He Will probably be equiped with  spotwelder and a decent solder iron and get it Done for me at low cost

I have found a Guy in sweden that can spotweld everything for 50dollars and desolder for 50$

So about 100$ to get it ready What do you think?

This is for both packs

When you receive your nickel from SuPower, would you mind measuring its thickness with a caliper,  if you have one, and then share it on here? I used their 10mm x 0.15 strips and then a different one that @darkkevind linked to from ebay, and the second one (ebay) was definitely thicker and required longer weld times. (btw, none of the two showed any corrosion after salt water baths.)

I'll try. Not sure if my calipers are capable of measuring a tenth of a millimeter thickness.

Thanks @Jinra! Measuring one layer only might be tricky I guess, but measuring like 10 layers with a firm compression (if strips are really flat) would give an idea of the thickness.

if you're doing a single layer of cells i would double up the nickel. and use 15 mil if you can find it, 10mm wide.

-confirming this... I tried some 25 mil and there wasn't enough power to get through it (I have the same welder).

Since the cellgroups are already glued togheter he Said that he was going to use triangle strips over the triangular cellgroups. And 3 strips on series connections

yeah that's how i do it on my trapezoidal 5P stacks. one strip on the two cells, one strip on the three cells, then diagonal strips all the way down. Then the ends get a full triangle.

Here's one of mine without the heat shrink on it. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BTh_40Mlakh/?taken-by=longhairedboy

i'm only using a single layer of nickel because the cells are stacked in a trapezoidal pattern which allows the energy flow to be split across two strips which are joined in parallel all the way down the side of the pack.
