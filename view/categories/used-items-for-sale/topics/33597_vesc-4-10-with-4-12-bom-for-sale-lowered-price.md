Hey guys! I am trying to sell a VESC. It is the 4.10 PCB but I added the capacitor that is the only parts related change that is between 4.10 and 4.12, I believe it was to improve FOC but not sure. Firmwares and specs are all the same as 4.12. I used it in my electric scooter build and it was very space limited so the CAPs are in a different order than they usually are (see pic) they are 680uF 63V as the original ones. I would like 95€ for it including worldwide shipping. Payments by PayPal "for goods".

@banjaxxed
Sure I will PM you.

@BoostedBuilder
Hi, sorry I only have one Ollin VESC left and two miami VESCs.

@Lionkev55
I am, looks like if I will get things arranged with banjaxxed I will be down to 1 miami  and also depending on boosted builder I might not have the Ollin. They messaged before you so I will sell it to them if they want it, just to keep it fair.

I did not make these units. @Martinsp what made you think they were Ollin VESC's?

I was sent two broken VESCs, one of which was for a repair and I sent it back and kept this one (pictured in the first post) that was the agreement between me and the customer. I used it in my scooter build as mentioned and now I am trying to sell it. I thought both the VESCs were made by you @chaka but now that you mentioned that they were not, I looked through the conversation with the customer and did not find any information as to who made them. **I am sorry to all of you for providing you with false information, it was not intentional.**
