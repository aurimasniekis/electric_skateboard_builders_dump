Hello
What would be the lowest price you would sell them for?

I'm working on a mountainboard (has nothing to do with Trampa) but the mounts look interesting, just not for that sum.

I understand if you say, you won't sell them cheaper‚Ä¶ just asking. maybe.

Cheers

Hi there, those mounts fit the Trampa Hypa hubs. You can however adjust by drilling a new hole pattern. That would work easely.
Its a nice double setup mount and new. So 250 is a good price. Trampa sells the successor for 450 Pounds right now. 
As I said, brand-new never used. I could however take the shipping cost depending where you live.
Let me know if you interested.
