Hi guys, it’s time to sell the next board (still dogs and brewing beer that takes priority).
Bought in the summer of 2018, used 10-20 times since then.
Loaded theoretical max speed 63.8km/h, I have never gone faster than 45 km/h.
Estimated range 48.2km, never driven more than 30km in one go myself and it had about 25% battery left. Everything is in good condition.
