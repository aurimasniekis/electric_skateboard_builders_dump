Story behind these, used for Max 100km, due to a really low clearance scratches appeard very fast, also because of the clearance I shattered one magnet. Fortunately all windings survived. The other motor works perfectly. Maytech sells new cans for 60usd. So you can have two working motors, Iâ€™m selling both of them for 110e plus shipping. Please PM if interested. Based in EU.

Just a reality check. "fairly new" in the title does not match this description at all. Good luck with the sale.

welp, they seen a week of use and less than 100km, they are not new, also they are less than slightly used, scratches are cosmetic, both would run fine being fairly new for 140.

I know they're not "old", but no one but you could say these are "fairly new". ;) The price is great though, if the other one is running well and just ugly.
