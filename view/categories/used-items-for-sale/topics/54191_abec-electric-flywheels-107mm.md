Hi I got my hands on a set of electric flywheels ( a bit dusty) and won’t be using it so I’m selling it 140$+shipping from Canada ![image|375x500](upload://9o9tW0bB4ML9nTSpngQxag67Z8i.jpeg)

Why is it so important to know what size the contact patch is anyways? it's a 4mm difference

Some of us already have one version, but not the other.  Also I like them specifically _because_ of the wide contact patch

Those are the 62 mm contact patch!  95% sure (look at the recessed core well) Take a side picture, @Pr0dy ... if they are 62 mm I may consider buying....
