Hey guys,

I have a couple used ESK8 items up for sale. Here are pictures and prices:

Torqueboards 218mm trucks:

$40, free priority shipping to the US. One is new, one is used.

Torqueboards V5 Fixed Dual Motor Mount Set:

$120, free priority shipping to the US.

I'd prefer to sell them both to the same person, so I will take $150 for everything.

Thanks,

Harry
