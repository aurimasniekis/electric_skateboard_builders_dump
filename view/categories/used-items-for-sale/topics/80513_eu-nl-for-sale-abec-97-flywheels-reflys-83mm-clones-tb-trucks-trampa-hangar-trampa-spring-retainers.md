Heyo there,

Selling my esk8 stuff and gonna try the onwheel this year. So here we go, all I have left:
I'm only selling/shipping to people within the EU, preferably in the Netherlands (also welcome to pickup).

**!! - I'll add pictures of everything later - !!**

**97mm 75a Flywheels green** (set of 4)
Price: **€85**

Not a lot to say about these, they roll great and are well known. Little dusty.
