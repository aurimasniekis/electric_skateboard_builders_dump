This seems like a little much for this?

Its not a budget diy board .as you can see the specs are way better than for example. A backfire g2t.

payed for parts
[/quote]

parts never sell for retail on here (new)

also we dont charge assembly fee unless it built by a known source, and that abs enclosure is janky super thin why not go with @psychotiller

Saw this thread as it was created... ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Hive mind strong 


You'll never get the price you paid for assembled parts, on used board OP, that's like me buying a used drill with word down bits and then asking full price for it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

80% of the original price is probably the best you can do

Honestly guys if the price is to high don't buy it.
If it doesn't sell he'll lower price. 
Yes things don't sell at what you paid for them but unless you're trying to negotiate a offer commenting is just cluttering his post

IMO it's good price when he is selling his own time - and it's preety good piece of work. Personally I'm impressed about the 6P battery - however build with enterion parts shows it's not a cheap or crappy project. I'd like to see some pics from building process - will you share any ?

I didnt take any pictures of the build process. I can share you some. I think its not fair to tell some one that a almost new diy is worth less than the parts. I spent a lot of time tinkering selling and buying to get it finished.![temp3|614x461](upload://9zBZEoUckBAnMMiI8JYir5DWyNq.jpeg) ![20190209_202746|666x500](upload://6rtIsHj1HjCKONOAJQPQUwN53rx.jpeg)

That's not dirty at all.  Dirty is when it has 15mm thick grime stuck all over it.

And yet here it is.  As its clearly not spam or a blatant attempt at squeezing money from the valued members of this forum then no harm done imo.   Nice little build and should go to a good home.  Lets try not to mess up legitimate sales threads with non purchasing related posts. (apart from this one lol) This build will make someone very happy i'm sure.  @Stas74
nice job and good luck with the sale.

Also take into account his location. The EU guys don't enjoy the low prices and low to no taxes we pay for parts.

It looks like a good board man I hope it finds a nice home.

A loop key. Its safer than a antispark. I heard that antisparks blow up, but loopkeys are reliable.
