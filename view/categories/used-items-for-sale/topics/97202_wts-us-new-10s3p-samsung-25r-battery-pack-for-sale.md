Brand new 10s3p Samsung 25r battery pack:
- has 1 cycle on it, only because I tested it to see if it was working, works great, really popular cells, I'd say best in the market after 30Q's.
- 7500mAh (7.5Ah), 270 Wh, gets about 12-14 miles with my WowGo 2s with fairly aggressive riding.
- compatible with all Chinese boards, comes with XT-60 connection.
- will throw in a free charge port w/ JST connection so that it can work with your existing charger.
- will ship anywhere in US, USPS Priority Express. can ship same day as payment, delivery in 2-3 days.
- will consider shipping international, depending on location. (shipping extra)

name your price. for comparison similar packs of similar capacity are around $230-$250. feel free to PM if you have any questions.

if you want pics, lmk, I can post after I get back home.

Show some respect...it's hard to be nice to someone who clearly has no regard for the seller.  I'd bump the price up just for you if you bought my stuff

no, not really. Maybe he doesn't know how to price it and thinks this community is nice enough to not lowball him.
