Hi guys, first of all love the community and esk8ting is growing so damn fast so keep it up! 

I bought 2 tested focboxes couple months ago for a new build but that never came to be so these to bad boys has just been collecting dust! So I want to sell them to someone that can have better use for them!

I’m from Sweden EU so I will prioritize Eu buyers 
also because shipping is expansive as hell here. 

Payment through PayPal’s business thing (you pay fee) 

If not then use friend & family (not recommended) 

Also pay in Swedish krona
100 euro each 
Excluding shipping
