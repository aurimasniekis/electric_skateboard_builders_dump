I have made the decision to get away from esk8 and I am selling some of the parts I have left. For now I am posting the focboxes I have. I bought both of them from @yummyblobs in a group buy two months ago. Both have been used on the bench but not in a board while riding. I will take $110 each or $200 for both. Shipping is $8 within the US only and will have tracking.

I’m more of a builder than a rider. Moving on to something new to learn and figure out how to build.
