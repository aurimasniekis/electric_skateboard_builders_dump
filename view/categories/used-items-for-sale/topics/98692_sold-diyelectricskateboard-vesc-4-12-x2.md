![image|383x500](upload://9atbvOd3yvmZeYmEGYacae3RozA.jpeg) Currently getting rid of some other parts and upgrading for a new build. Iâ€™m selling **2X** Diyelectricskateboard Vescs. Located in USA. $65 ea. Used once, like new, just has holes in the heat shrink where the canbus and receiver port is located.
