I have a set of Freebord S2 Bindings I bought 1.5 years ago, they have been mounted but never ridden.

I have another set that has also been mounted but only ridden a couple of times. I painted the bases black, comes with everything and are ready to mount.

Would you ship the S2's to the UK?  If so how much for cheapest shipping?  If it looks good I'll take them :) Cheers
