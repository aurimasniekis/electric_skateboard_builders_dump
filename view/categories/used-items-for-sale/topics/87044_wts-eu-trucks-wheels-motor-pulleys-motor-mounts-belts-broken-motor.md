Well, it allows for a faster motor swap with out removing the pulley, besides that it is rock solid.

Hi @Komamtb,


I'm taking the 14t 8mm pulleys, but just to be sure :

* You do have 2 of them to sell, don't you ? If yes, how much for the 2 pulleys (14t 8mm) shipped to Paris in France ?
* Are all the belts in the lest picture brand new (like never used at all) ? I could need some as well, just have to check wich size tonight :)

Regards,
```
