Iâ€™ve got some beat up caliber 2 trucks I donâ€™t use anymore. $10 + shipping from Utah.

Are those boosted calibers? ðŸ‘€

How easy is it to remove the motor mount? I would try it myself but currently my drivetrain is out getting spruced up ðŸ˜Ž

Yeah they are. I just used a heat gun and a hammer. Wasnâ€™t hard.

Any shot you have them and can provide measurements? I'm wondering if I can somehow mate mine to surfrodz ðŸ¤”

If not it's cool, I'll just wait until I have them again
