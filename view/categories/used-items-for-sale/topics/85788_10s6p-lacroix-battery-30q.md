I have a friend who wants to sell their 10s6p Samsung 30Q pack. 

He has 65 ish charges on it and he wants to sell it off for 400usd if possible. But honestly name a price that you think is **reasonable**. It comes without BMS but has balance wires already on it.

( He doesn't have a forum account so he asked me to relay a post for him)

Ah sorry, Montreal Quebec. For some reason I am unable to upload pictures o-o Dunno why but I keep getting errors.

Edit: It looks like any other Lacroix battery, the packs are solid, is connected to a 6p PCB and is very easy to solder and desolder packs from each other if needed.

Edit: As I said before, it will be soldered and wired with balance wires. But I can get them de-solderd if needed for easy packing and use.

The pack is literally connected, save for the bms

Surely the service they provided is still worth something
