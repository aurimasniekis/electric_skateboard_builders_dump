I know what the product is, I would like to see what condition the one he is selling is in, hence the ask for pictures. . . . is it a kit, is it new? is it assembled? if that thread states pre-order, how does he have one?

If you have read the thread you would know the remote has never come as a kit.  It's always been a fully assembled product.  I imagine he had 'pre-order' up there because he might be out of stock and is getting more soon.  Pic's would be good though to see the quality, I certainly agree on that, lol.  :slight_smile:  Also, it says in the title and the description that it's unused, so I would assume it's new, just never opened.
