Not at home rn. I will post pics tonight. They have Japanese bearing but one of the big bearing has a flat spot on a bearing ball so it occasionally makes ticking noise that annoys me. That why I'm getting that bearing swapped out.

@DerelictRobot @M77 @Blacksheep

I'm not in a rush for money so I will leave this as an auction. I will close this out at Sunday 11:59pm.

Current highest bid is $455 by @Blacksheep

Let me summarize it again:
  Hummie V4 hubs
* 73kv
* Japanese bearing
    * One or both big bearing will be swapped out.. a ball has a flat spot that makes ticking noise
    * -$20 if you are ok with not swapping them. They are fine just makes some noise occasionally
* New PU sleeves
* New centrax
* New Paris trucks for the front

Count me out, I'm likewise in no rush so paying more than retail on used parts isn't my preference. Good luck on the auction.

Bruh idk why you are making it such a big deal. It's literally the same as phasing $450 obo. I'm just waiting til the end of the week. I know someone paid $600 for a new set so $450 used is nothing. Plus I'm adding everything new to the deal. So I don't think I'm asking for too much. Money will eventually go back to Hummie.  I'm just trying to not make he lose too much because he's doing me a favor to save me material for a custom kv set instead of selling it. Fyi There's only material for 3 more sets.

I hear ya brother n I’m not judging you.    Only thing I kinda disagree with is the whole auction thing.     Make it easy for you and the buyer and just set up a price and get it over with!   If not me I’m pretty sure someone else will say something about your selling practices 🤷🏻‍♂️
Good luck with the auction ma man👍🏼
