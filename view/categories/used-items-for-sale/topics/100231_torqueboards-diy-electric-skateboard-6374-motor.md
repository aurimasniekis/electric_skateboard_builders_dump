This is an Almost New 63mm 6374 Electric skateboard motor EXTRA TORQUE AND POWER from torque boards and  it works great but I'm in a bit of a money punch right now. I got this about 2 weeks ago and was really looking to start using it but I need to pay rent payments. ![13%20PM|669x500](upload://hIUCNOgiA2rHCsRQTYiEw11stFb.jpeg) ![20%20PM|679x500](upload://p4tfCwaQAsO9LvOQCcZXjgZyzy0.jpeg) ![25%20PM|672x500](upload://wXzGll5cPnjJJnJJtJeKs8rIAvV.jpeg)  Please message me with any questions about the item.

And to be combined - There is no reason to have a half dozen topics with one item each when a single topic will work fine. It's just spam.

Can we also add that you probably shouldn’t be spending $100+ on esk8 motors if you’re tight on rent. 

Unless you’re planning on sleeping on the board

Nothing beats plywood, maple, and bamboo to sleep on?
