I’m located in toronto canada. Selling is in new condition, is to narrow for my needs. Bought it from diyebords for 110usd.
Deck is 38" bamboo and maple. Dimensions must be same as loaded vanguard.
Paid 110usd.
Looking for offers, shipping might be a problem outside canada![6321b446d97a0ea3d617539eaad27337d2998d8b_2_750x998|375x499](upload://5C9mbeXAbWncm5WYc1gna7F1BGR.jpeg) ![ebdeb89dad5221895405ad365080009912989705_2_750x998|375x499](upload://pG2cuEgtAGGRbdpgsrGXg4bQNVL.jpeg)
