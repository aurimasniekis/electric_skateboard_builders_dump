Selling my 3weeks to a.month old unity. It comes with mr60 connectors. I will include its male counterparts.

Unit history:
* Purchased it from Jlabs (Surplus from GB -1st batch)
* Used it for a little bit then type c port broke.
* Got a replacement about a month ago

I can provide exact dates if needed. This unit is "mint". I have acquired 2 vesc6. I like redundancy on my setup with ackmaniac firmware. Just my preference. I have no use for this unit.

Since I purchased it for $325. I'll ask $300 shipped.

We all know we love pics. Here we go:
