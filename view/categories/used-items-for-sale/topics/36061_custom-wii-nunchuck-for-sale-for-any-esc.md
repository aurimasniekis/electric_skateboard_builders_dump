How does it work? You need a special receiver? 
I heard about those things but I don't know how they work

Just wanted to bump and vouch for Vishal.  We've been chatting on and off for a few weeks now off the forum and he's just ran on some bad luck with an ESC and is pretty close to having enough $$$ to get something as a hold over to complete the project.  He's sent me a few videos of progress on the board (you should share your setup too @vishal_tejwani ) and we've chatted about the controller he made based on the wii controllers.

Since I haven't had hands on I can't say anything about the controller but it's a wii analog stick, so if you've used one of those you know roughly what that feels like in the hand.  Just wanted to let everyone know since I'm here more often that Vishal isn't just some scammer and he's just looking to get enough cash to replace a burned out ESC (also if anyone in india has an ESC that is good and they're willing to part with for cheap or free, post in the thread).

@vishal_tejwani would be good to post a picture of the hardware you have on hand to make the controllers and/or to clean up  a sample controller for pictures so people can know what they can expect to get to improve confidence of potential buyers :slight_smile:
