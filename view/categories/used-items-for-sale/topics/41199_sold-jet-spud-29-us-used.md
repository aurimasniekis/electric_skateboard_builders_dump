I've got a lightly used Jet Spud 29 for sale.  I'm tearing it down this weekend.  Using some if the parts for my new 40mph build and some to fix my kids street deck. I hate to get rid if it but I can't justify spending a bunch this close to Christmas. 

I'll take $65 for the deck.  I'll sell the enclosure for $40 with the volt meter.

Here's pics as it is, I'll post more when I've disassembled the board.

There are quit a few screw holes in the bottom but the are only 3/8 deep.  It would beast to fill with putty and sand, which is what I'll do if I don't sell it.

Also, the factory grip is not great, even new.  So I'll stick a couple of 33in pieces of grip in with it.

Is 10s3p the largest pack that will fit in there (@psychotiller - FlagshipV2) with (2) VESC's? 

I know totally OT from your sale but I got (2) Jet Spud 29"'s trying to make two builds (one to sell and one to keep). Need a nice enclosure and gonna go carvon v4 for dual drive -- I am thinking this FlagshipV2 or Knuckles (18 x 6.25 x 1.60") the latter would definitely support a double layer of 18650's

If you double layer the cells you could fit a 12s4p I imagine.

The deck is all I'm really trying to sell.  I have some blue Caliber II 10in 50deg trucks that I used on this build I'd sell, but Ill prolly use them again as well.

Just too many boards build and building too many. It's a great deck, and I love the bindings. The eBay ESC not so much.

If it wasn‚Äôt for me just getting one from Jared I would‚Äôve gotten it from you. I just needed a board to leave at the office with the Landwheel. Deck feels really good. Someone should get this and just have psycho make you the same enclosure.

Lol every time one of us post a picture with what I call ‚ÄúX-Washer‚Äù we get that question. Maybe we should just call it ‚ÄúX-Thing‚Äù? 

@akhlut hey Matt. Since you are now famous. You should name it!

Sorry to go off topic.  Back to the subject. The Spud with the deck hook would be perfect together
