The onewheel is a blast. Get the XR or you will regret it. 

Iv'e had mine for a few weeks now and iv'e put about 200 miles on it. It really is a whole different experience. 

Good luck with the sale!

Hey guys,
Calm down.
Does @hoeksame1 still has the remote available?
Because it is easier to ship within the Netherlands. If his is already sold I also could take the one from @pjotr47 for â‚¬30? 
And one last question: the enertion remote and reciever are able to be used with a Hobbyking X beast car esc? Because that is the esc I have. Thanks

Calm down.
[/quote]
Haha we are only joking we know each other. 

Mine is fully new in package. So the lowest I can do is 40 euro. 

I think that is possible to use if you bind and do calibration again. I have also 2* vesc for sale

Thanks for reply.
â‚¬40 is a bit too much for me considering my total build costed â‚¬280. I already have the Hobbyking gt2b that works fine but is quite bulky. But I will stick with that for now.

I got a refund from him after similar  handling, was surprised to get a refund since I F&Fâ€™d. Maybe reeling in a big dupe

Something about the package returned for wrong address (perfect address used 100s of times). Asked for refund as shady ðŸ’¯ 

The eBay email is a joke name and if you email the owner of the address you get an email from someone else

Not cool whoever you are

Edit: I have the fixed ones, not the APS one. they're thick as fuck.
