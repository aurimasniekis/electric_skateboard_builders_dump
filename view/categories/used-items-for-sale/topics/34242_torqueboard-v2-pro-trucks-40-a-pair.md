I have a pair of lightly used  [TorqueBoard v2 Pro trucks](collections/longboard-trucks/products/torqueboards-v2-pro-trucks) -- selling for $40 for the pair. 

I live in NYC so if you live close, we can do a local meetup; otherwise I can ship it to you. I do ship internationally but you will have to pay for shipping.

Any idea on how much it would be to post a 6355 to Melbourne, Australia?
