I'm thinking about selling my 2wd Trampa Hs11 build. Looking for around 2.5k I've put around 30ish miles on it so far, love the offroad, but its a bit stiff for me. I'm an engineering student, and I'd like to move to another project. I'm in Chicago and willing to drop off pick up locally, or you pay for shipping.

Specs:
Kaly.Nyc Direct drives
Trampa Carve Deck 35deg 14 ply
12s5p Samsung 30q Top mounted Battery
2x Focbox in the same top-mounted enclosure running split PPM
Flipsky 6374 190kv Motors
Trampa Barrels (and original springs w/ dampas)
Metr.at BT module
Firefly remote
On/Off by loopkey
Includes 12s 4a charger
