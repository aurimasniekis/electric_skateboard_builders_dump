Hey guys, selling some new and used esk8 parts I no longer require. Price includes 1st class shipping to UK or EU. Payment via PayPal goods and services. Thanks any questions PM me :slight_smile:

**Street Wing 6374 190kv Motor - £OFFERS**
The motor works fine however the motor can is loose which I believe is a common problem on these motors. The original hall sensor wires also came loose and wouldn't detect so a replacement was sent out to me which has been soldered on and now works. Open to offers if anyone wants it for spares/repairs.

**72T HTD5M 15mm Wheel Pulley with Trampa Hypa Hub Adapter x2 - £15 shipped**

I'm not sure it depends on the hub. It's the same hub for both the 7" and 8" tyres but although they look like the trampa hubs I'm pretty sure they're slightly different and will need measuring for someone to make a pulley for them

As a new user, PMs may not be open to you yet. A bit more reading and posting and it'll magically open up.
