The cheapest source I found in Canada sells them for 17.00$ CND, but I can sell them for lower than that depending on the number bought.

For any Canadian member interested, eBay has a -15% code today (PRONTO15). I am willing to let it go for 260$, which comes to **220$ CND** after discount. Here's [my listing](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/123277790817), use the "Make an offer" button.
