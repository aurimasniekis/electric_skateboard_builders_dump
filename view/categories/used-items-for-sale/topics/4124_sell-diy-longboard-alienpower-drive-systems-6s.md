Hi guys.

I want to make a new board so this board has to go... 

This was my first board and is finally fine tuned to my personal likings.

It's a 95cm Longboard
6s zippy 5000mah
torqueboards transmitter
alienpowersystems ESC 12s
Alienpowersystems 3200W 63mm motor 
Aliendrivesystem mount
2 Ledstrips for the nightglow. 
Caliber 2 trucks
Seismic speedvents
zealous bearings

Optional, Can sell you the charger aswell for extra fee
Have an arduino to control board with phone. 

Board reaches 30 km/u with lots of torque
range of +- 10km depends on your weight. 
Have not found a hill I couldn't climb. 
board has maybe 100km and is in perfect condition( has 3 extra belts) 

What would you give ? 
I'm from Belgium

don't really know ... 
I paid a lot of money for it because it was in the early days of Esk8 
So i'm gonna loose out on a lot of money anyway. 

What is the price you would pay for it ? 
I spend around 850 on this board. But the prices have gone done a lot

If you still have this board I'm interested. How much would shipping be to the USA? Then I can determine a fair price

Is it expensive because of the deck? The parts by themselves look way under 600

Well that's the issue. I was pretty early with building this board and APS and ADS were en still are pretty expensive. 
So I'm losing already a lot of money on this. The board and setup were 300 euro

It is not about the pure cost of the parts. he assembled it and invested time into getting it to work properly. Parts for a macbook are also cheaper than the assembled macbook. This applies to basically every product from every company.
Also in a free market he can choose to charge whatever he wants. It is up to you to accept the price or not.

bruh im simply saying that even if the parts cost a $100 dollars when he bought them but are only worth 50 now then its reasonable to sell them for maybe 60 at most. However if u have an iphone 5 and try selling it for the same price u bought it once it was released its almost like a scam if not a rip off. im just trying to help possible buyers realize that they are paying 600 for a 350-400 dollar setup.

That is really fair , and it's good you let the people now. 

But this board is perfectly tuned for my use. and all the parts are of high quality. 
The only reason this board will be sold is for a price that I see as worthy because otherwise 
I will keep it to give to my friends to ride with me.
This post was to see if there would be any interest. Since this is my first board, the looks are not as fancy as the builds you see here.

Currently I'm in my Exam period. So no free time at all. 
Your 600 dollars bid is nice but i'm from EU so I was talking about Euro's my bad for not stating it. 
this makes it even more expensive for you. 
So I'm thinking of just keeping it for me.

not a bad Idea. I get the feeling that board has some sentimental value best not to part with it then regret it later

Hi, 

I am trying to control my board with my phone and I have pretty much the same components as you. Do you mind sharing your arduino program ?

Thanks, 
C.Baker
