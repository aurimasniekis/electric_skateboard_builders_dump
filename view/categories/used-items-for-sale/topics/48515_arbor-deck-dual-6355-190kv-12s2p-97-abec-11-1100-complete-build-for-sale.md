Ok guys, looking to sell my latest build since I have another board coming and need to get rid of off one of these bad boys. I’m not really looking to sell my dual 6374 12s4p build but I’m open to offers on all 3 boards including the Evlolve Bamboo GT with a modded LHB battery (Samsung 30q) none of these boards are even 5 months old besides the evolve which got a new pack 4 months ago. 

Not parting anything out but have parts for sale on my other post. 

All Torqueboard parts from the vesc to the trucks battery and everything besides the remotes. I use benchwheel remotes from Miami electric skateboards and both DiY boards have Bluetooth modules installed along with shred lights. 

Looking for $1250 for the 12s2p build has 40t/16t gearing 

Not sure on prices for the dual 6374 or modded evolve BGT

All my boards have 15mm pulleys and belts. Hearing is different but I also have videos showing how they ride. Located in Florida

All of this is from torque boards all of it besides wheels and deck all he did was connect things together not even solder. What labor I sold my dual 6374 with 12s4p and may tech vesc for 600$ and we wants more and its used no logic

You get abec 97 flywheels for $80? Youbget torqueboard trucks for $50? 

You do labor for free, bearings, adhesive velcro, shredlights, all the other parts and extra belts. I’d say $1250 for someone who doesn’t want to build is nice. I’m not in a rush to sell and will part it out.

My arguement is valid. I listed the cost of your build came up to 1,140 brand new and your selling it more as used  because 'labor " plug and play is not labor its called having 2 hands.  
You always lowball and play it off as "am not trying to low ball because xyz excuse of having money "

dude calm down...both of you. Labor making a board for yourself, family and friends should always be free, BUT when you build for someone else you may not know you have the right to charge them. 

My current build is looking to cost about $1,250. I will walk to a mirror and argue with my reflection that I should pay myself the labor cost :smirk:. Matt is fishing, just let the man fish.

To us these are "plug and play" that's why these completed boards mostly gets parted out because no one here in their right mind would pay that much. What he really should do is sell this on ebay, craigslist, facebook groups, etc.

The selling point to people not in the know would be a comparing it to a Boosted showing that it outperforms it at a "lower" price.

I think the major point here is that you stepped on it and USED it, thus price dramatically drops like everything that is used. A car looses 30-50% the second you leave the lot.

The link you provided does not sell Flywheels.

It says "Out of Stock" like everywhere else.  An historical price does no good to someone trying to buy some.

I don't see what the issue is. He's selling it assembled for less than it would cost someone to build. If someone is willing to pay that price then let them. 
It'd be different if he was selling a used TB Vesc for $115, but he isn't. All you guys are arguing about is how much the value of something decreases as a result of it being used. That's completely subjective.

You are correct but when he's bin doing that all the time on other people stuff no one bats a eye but all the sudden now its subjective. Guy selling boosted clone spent 1000 was asking 700 he offered 400 , guy selling 12s8p asking 800 offered 400$.

I don't see too big an issue with that. If you go to Latin American countries that is a typical way of doing business, start way below your target price and haggle up. 

Though if he's lowballing people, then he has no right to be mad if people lowball him.

I’m not opposed to part with anything right now so what are you looking at? 

I have a Kaly 2 in 1 coming so I’m willing to sell just about anything right now because I don’t want to have 4 boards. I can’t ride them enough nor do I have enough boys to come over daily to shred with. So I’m going to just keep 2 in the end
