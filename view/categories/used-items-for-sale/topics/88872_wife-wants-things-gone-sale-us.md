The orange hubs are working fine about 7 months ago.  One was used for less than 20 miles and with original pu on it.  The other orange one has more milage on it and the PU was replaced.  After replacing the PU I noticed a little bumpping sound on it I turn on it.  I think (not sure) these hubs were maytech 90mm hubs  60 kv.  I am not sure.    I actually have 3 of these.  One broke that why one is one is newer than the other.  Sensored hubs.  

Do you really want to ship it to EU?   Shipping will be expensive.  I will ship if you are willing to pay.
