I am selling a set of motor mounts for Trampa Vertigo/Ultimate AT Trucks. This is an advanced prototype, fully functional. You can add an adjustable belt tensioner (idler) with a M6 screw and 2 bearings.
It's a perfect fit for the trucks
The mount is very sturdy and it works perfectly with a 450 belt, you can also adjust the tension of the belt by moving the motor up. It comes with black covers.
I am asking 140 usd

Included:

Motor mount set for Trampa Vertigo Trucks (you will just need 8xM4 40mm screws) + Black Motor and belt covers

I can include 2 HTD 5 450mm belts for 20 USD

Esc enclosure: 35 USD
2 SK3 245kv motors (100 USD)
2 Emax EZRun Max6 ESC already configurated (200 USD)
Previous version of the motor mount with covers: 130 USD
