Putting this up here as well, as I suspect most people come here when looking for private sales.

Everything is totally new and unused, from a project I unfortunately didn't have the time to work on. 

Bestech 10s BMS with e-Switch - £45 [LINK](http://www.bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D596.html) - Is the high-current charge/discharge BMS. 

<s>Flipsky Dual 4.20 Plus Vesc </s> SOLD

<s>Bergmeister Wheels (Red Aluminium) + Tyres/Tubes + Pulleys & Belts - </s> SOLD

<s>Haggy Drive System Kahua Trucks + Motor Mounts -  </s> SOLD

<s>Restless Mantis Bali 33" Deck  - </s> SOLD

<s>2x 6374 170kv Sensored Motors - £70 (would prefer to sell as a pair).</s> SOLD

Happy to post within the EU, shipping costs will obviously depend where you are. Everything will be sent Tracked + Insured. 

Let me know if you have any interest :)

Do you have a postcode I can put in? Or which part of Ireland are you based? It might matter whether you're north/south (I'm not sure)

Assuming just standard Ireland, tracked and insured is £18 so call it £15. That's express 3 day delivery. There's also express 1-3 day which will be £20. Up to you. Can also go economy 5 day delivery for £10.

I've asked, flipsky warranties aren't transferable :confused: js.

You'd have to warranty through him if you had issues.

The flipsky website says it's transferable. Not sure who's told you otherwise. 

I'm happy enough to contact them in case of a fault though, it's not like I'd have to post it to them they can't tell where the item was shipped from. So either way, there's a warranty in place if the item fails on delivery.

Double update on this in case people are actually concerned - had confirmation direct from Flipsky that **all their warranties are in fact transferable**. 


Update on sales -

* Motors are sold awaiting payment

* Bergmeisters are on hold for someone who's interested, however if anyone wants them WITH the trucks I will do a deal for it. 
* VESC is sold awaiting payment. 

Everything else is still available.

Trucks and wheels are currently being discussed with someone else who's considering a bulk purchase, but I'll add an update on here if that falls through.
