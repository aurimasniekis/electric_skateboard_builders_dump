Alright. 
So I have a few things for sale, I am not sure on the price and since many people pm'd me about the raptor deck, how about a bidding war :slight_smile:, since I Have no idea about pricing that one. 
@GrecoMan,  @stormboard1, @Hariboisawesome, @Bensaida,   

For the rest, let me hear your offer, trade deals etc. But no crazy lowballs please. Shit is expensive in EU. (lol just saw basically all decks are on sale now, unlucky man :smile:  )

What I would trade for generally:

- Wheels (abecs 11 85mm+)
- Carver trucks
- Leather slide gloves
- Decks (depends )
- gopro 5 or others
- Decent condeser mic

So my stuff for sale/trade (provided with link if you need more info, such as wheelbase etc.)

**Decks:**

- Raptor 1 
has a few scratches, no structural damage and comes with the second gen lid with no connection problems.

- **_SOLD_** Never summer soldier tm
peeled of the useless griptape to see the beautiful fiberglass and texicum. The stuff you see is dirt, almost brand new.

Will be leaving it at this atm. Didn't you purchase R1 decks before, if that doesn't work might come back to you for a reference of pricing.
