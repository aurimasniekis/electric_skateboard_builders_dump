Great kit for someone looking to get into eskate but. Doesent know what to buy, all you need is to add a battery, deck and enclosure! however i think your price is a little high at $600.

These are estimated prices

Cal trucks - 40
Dual focbox - 220 
Anti spark - 25
Dual 190kv motors - 175
Dual pulley - 40
Bt module - 10
Mounts ( no clue) -50?
Wheels - 30
Remote - 20

it adds to 610, so it's high but not ridiculously so ðŸ¤·

They look like new products, I can't tell and nor do I care =')

Yes it is valued correctly at retail price however the parts look lightly used to me.

I know, but some things on build kit boards can be purchased from other vendors at a lower price. Don't get me wrong i don't think this is a bad deal at all but i personally value used/slightly used parts a a bit less then retail.

I'm not saying anything about anyone who has commented in this thread, I'm just making a general statement

OP, On this forum you're going to find people who will debated you at every corner possible. Price, opinion, whatever you might have, someone will have something to say about it

Fortunately, you don't have to listen to them, if you don't mind waiting. Keep in mind the lower prices go, the more incentive people will have to get them faster. Eventually you'll have a bite. It's all about how your cash flow can take it.

E: can't grammar goodly. I need to get some sleep ðŸ˜‚
