Just have a few extra parts.  Cost is $10 per motor pulley, $10 per wheel pulley and $5 for shipping.  I can throw in extra 12mmx330 and 12mmx305mm belts for free too.

Make sure to use friends &amp; family.

Its against forum policy to use Friends and Family for payment of goods sold here.  Please don't do that in the future.  You are welcome to have the purchaser add the 3% that PayPal charges to make up the difference.

Good to know.... Funny though because I don't think I have ever purchased anything on this forum except through F&F.

I will keep this in mind in the future.

Horrible idea not to use F&F? Not if you know you can trust the person.  Pretty easy to see who you can trust among the many well known and respected vendors and builders on the forum.

You don't have to like it.  The policy exists to protect people. There have been multiple incidents where someone seemed trust worthy and turned to not be.  One recently.
