Hi,\
So, last September I bought this: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/selling-new-10s4p-battery/60410 battery from @OskarCastrone since then it hasn't been used extensively (only about 20 to 30 cycles) since then. The battery is in my opinion pretty unsafe so I would prefer to sell it to someone who knows what he is doing.\
It needs some "service" to make it safer but theoretically, it's working perfectly. :slight_smile:\
Asking around 120â‚¬ +shipping since I need the money for a new battery pack. :smile:\

I can also include a 2A charger. :slight_smile:\
I would prefer to sell it within the EU because of shipping restrictions.\
Just pm me if you are interested.\
Thanks for reading. :slight_smile:

Well, there's a lack of fishpaper between the p-groups. The balance wires are improperly placed and insulated and the bms is in an unsafe place in my opinion. :slight_smile:\
Those issues are relatively easy to resolve but I honestly don't feel comfortable doing it on my own. :slight_smile:

In a sense that it isn't up to the latest "forum guidelines" but it's not like it's about to explode...

Those weld spots look a bit weak tbh, but hard to tell. Not gonna lie, I'm PRETTY hecking interested in buying this as a temporary battery for my next build. Not gonna go for it until I really need it though.

Depends on your configuration but I got around 20 to 30km with it but you can easily use one of the calculators that are on here. :slight_smile:

A bit yes.
