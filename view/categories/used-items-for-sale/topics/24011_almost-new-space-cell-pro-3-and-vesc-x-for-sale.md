Hi,

I recently bought parts to make a board. I ended up not needing the VESC-X nor Space Cell Pro 3. They are both in near perfect condition (never fully attached to the board, just used to test it). I'm unable to return them so I'm trying to sell them. I can ship anywhere in the US. Anyone interested in either one or both?

Best,
Sam
