How much if I take the VESC, ABEC and Caliber 2's?

Also how does the combo of green orange and red look for the trunks and wheels?

I never actually got to mount the motor. Just got in all the mechanics and then had to bail on the build

I actually just sold the VESC. Color combo doesnt look great but its pretty subjective. PM me if you still want the ABECs and Calibers though.
