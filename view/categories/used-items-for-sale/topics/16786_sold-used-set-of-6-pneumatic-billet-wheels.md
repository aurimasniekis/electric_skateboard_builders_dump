These are off one of my personal builds. Still pretty new, but there is a slight wobble in one wheel. Not like an evolve hub, but still a wobble...Hasn't bothered me or anyone else while riding the board though and we've been mobbing some trails and rough terrain. Matco Tread is 95% $225 takes them.  Free ship in the US.  No pulleys or belts included in this price. First come first serve. No holds.
