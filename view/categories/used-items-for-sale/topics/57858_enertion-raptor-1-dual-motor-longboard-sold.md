I recently got a raptor 2 and have decided to sell my Raptor 1 dual. This is an excellent board and it is in great condition. It is ready to ride!

-comes with nano x remote and original remote
-about 150 miles on it
 The board is in excellent condition. It has some scuffs on the tail and some light scratches on it. 
-10s3p battery holds a full charge
-dual 6355 Enertion r-spec motors
-90mm ABEC 11 75a Flywheels installed with only 20 miles on them
-original 83mm enertion wheels included
-extra belts included
-charger

This is your chance to get a great board that is no longer produced. 

$1150 shipped in the US (US only)
