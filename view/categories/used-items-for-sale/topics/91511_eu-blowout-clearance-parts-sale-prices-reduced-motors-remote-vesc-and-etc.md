Just make a price for each then you can still be open to offers. It'll also help you not get 2cents offers.

Btw I'm bidding 5cents on the hubs üí∑, 10cents for the package, I pay shipping ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit : More seriously your prices are very good, wish you a fair sale! I'd have bought both and built a 4wd if it wasn't for these damn inline skates.

Anyone wanna make a torque monster for July's World cup? Could be a more than decent setup.
