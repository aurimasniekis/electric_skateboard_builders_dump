This board has been used maybe 5 times over the last 6 months. I keep it at 70% charge because that's what the batteries like being stored at. It has two scuffs on the motor mounts but other than that it's brand new. It comes with the charger, the remote, the board, four shred lights on the front that illuminate just about everything, and a duel charger for the lights. Asking $1,600 plus shipping, i can negotiate but please no low balls.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/b/9b6018e90502455be2291250130de6314f9ce8c0.jpg" width="281" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/1/51c63441870d5352d17287364ffca60ed593a774.jpg" width="281" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/4/542200ec155925c611ad2ee63deb72e3e3f3ee0c.jpg" width="281" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/8/5856d64d0f326a64405304efa890d7b4c957d6d3.jpg" width="281" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/1/213d9740e3be941d3d322fa4ad3e1a92bbd45ff4.jpg" width="281" height="499">

I just don't like prebuilts.  I just realized that comment was pretty dickish, I didn't mean for it to be.  Was just joking.  Been a long day surrounded by asshats, so I didn't proof read very well.
