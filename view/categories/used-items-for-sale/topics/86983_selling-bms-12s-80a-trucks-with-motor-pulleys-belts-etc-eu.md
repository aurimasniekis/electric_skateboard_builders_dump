Hey Guys

I need to get rid of some stuff that I don't use in my current setup.

I have the following:

![20190312_205727|690x388](upload://I6pYjaLzW0L5Yff4U851VjdScw.jpeg)

![20190312_205816|690x388](upload://kFgbOeDZnDfyBy8G70K7afapqLO.jpeg)

![20190312_205820|690x388](upload://kPWa2bgD61pQRa4WXYxWwDVMyca.jpeg) 

I would love to sell everything of as a set (at a great price).
So basically I have a 12S 80A BMS with bluetooth module
https://de.aliexpress.com/item/12-S-100A-smart-board-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-batterie-schutz-bord-f-r/32848466970.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dckAu11

Then I have some parts left from a maytech kit (2 Trucks with motor mount and the motor - motor however cant detect the sensor so I ran it sensorless)
https://de.aliexpress.com/item/Maytech-8pcs-electric-skateboard-with-big-off-road-6374-motor-e-mountain-board-kit/32774894872.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dOiNa0O

Both trucks have brand new wheels!
I use Pitch 5 belt/pulleys on these trucks - however I also have the original pitch 3 parts available.

I also have some aluminum/steel/ABS pulleys left (Pitch 5).
I also have 2 of the original maytech wheels.

Last but not least would be a chain drive set.

So let me know if anyone is interested so I can think of a set price for the parts that you want.
I ship from Austria / Europe.

Have a great day.
Patrick

Lo siento, prefiero venderlo como un conjunto. De lo contrario será difícil venderlos por separado.

The Motor is a Maytech Motor 6374 - 170KV
However the Hall sensor is not working properly (at least on my VESC) so I used it sensorless.

@Hansg
So are you still interested ?
Let me know - like mentioned the Motor is a 6374 Motor from Maytech 170KV.
The Trucks are also from Maytech and include the motor mount, pulley, belt etc.
The wheels only have 5km on them (almost like new).

It was working fine for me. Just use it sensorless (the only difference is that you can not start from a standstill as good as with the sensor working).
so you only need the motor ?
```

Yes I just need the motor because my motor is burned so I need a good motor only for install thats it.

I just connected it to my other VESC and ran the Motor detection and it seems the sensor is working. Seems the problem was with my other VESC.

![image|371x499](upload://pqsflDpDaYmdvyHqJZaOydBrPmT.png)

But I can not guarantee that it will work on your VESC. So I better keep the motor I guess
