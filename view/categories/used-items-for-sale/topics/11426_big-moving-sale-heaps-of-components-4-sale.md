Gd day everybody. I have been a long time lurker in this forum and with all various topics floating around in this forum I was able to build a few eBoards here. I am soon moving back to Europe (from Taiwan) and I would like to lessen the load, so stuff I do not need anymore is now for sale. Most of the stuff is brand new, never used or only used a couple of times.

Things include brushless motors, trucks, wheels, connectors, belts, motor pulleys, wheel pulleys etc....you can download the pdf (yardsale.pdf) from my dropbox account: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ga2q407eomcjcul/yardsale.pdf?dl=0
if you have any questions or an offer I can't refuse, do drop me a line or email me (thaggy.1@gmail.com). Cheers Timo

XIII, hi there. Unfortunately not. Everything would have to be shipped from Taiwan. Unless you could wait until mid January. I will then be in Switzerland. Best if you could pm me and let me know what you are interested in.

nothing specific, but you prices are pretty good for the motors. And you can never have to many spares ;) 
taxes/shipping would up the price too much though

you are absolutely right. shipping and taxes are a pain. I could let you know in case I have a friend of mine who travels to Europe earlier.

any ideas on shipping costs for your enclosures? they're light, so should be relatively affordable?

Hi, i would like to buy 4 motors (022,023,024,025).
But i think the Taxes and shipping would be way to much. (I live in Germany)
But i can wait untill you are back in Switzerland.

I think it would be better if you make a list in your original post and write down whats sold and what not.

boys n girls, hi there
I have been rather busy today, so my lack of reply. (and being a new user on here...i have reached my max amount of replies allowed...so have to wait another 6hours)
I have received an overwhelming amount of replies and I will attend to all of them. To be fair to everyone, I will reply in chronological order and await your reply, as most of the questions are in regards to shipping costs from Taiwan.
Basis shipping costs being out of range for you and you choose not to buy it, then the next one in line who inquired will get the chance. Trust this is in everybody's interest.
thanks again and best regards
TImo
