For sale all the hardware from a yuneec ego. The hardware includes:
1. -------------- (no motor)
2. Batteries - defective
3. Battery cover
4. Controller (modded for always on light)-SOLD
5. Esc with antispark plug (modded with arctic silver paste for heat disspiation and rotated for standalone use)- SOLD
6. Wheels (with reds, one has a small chunk from the edge removed but does not affect performance)
7. Trucks with mount and pulley
8. Misc- screws, motor cover and fan assy, some rubber pads, etc)

I have the deck but its pretty trashed and would be extra due to shipping if you want it. 

Asking $170 paypal shipping included (priority usps) conus only.

Thanks!

****UPDATE UPDATED***

ECU and controller SOLD.

****UPDATE****

I reduced the price of the sale. Also, i eliminated the motor because I tried taking it apart and completely trashed it. üò≤

If you want just the ESC and the Controller i can do that for $120.

I'll include the cables necessary for a new motor connection as seen on the photo, or if you already have a yuneec motor, just plug it in!!

Forgot to mention that the controller has a modification for permanent lights on and the button is loose inside. 

Also the ESC comes with an xt-90 plug that came with an antispark (but the antispark is actually on the battery side).

The trucks and mount are $100. But you might as well get the trucks, mount, esc, controller, wheels with super reds (cept for two bearings which are stock) for $170 shipped. I think its a good deal.

Everything fits on a large priority usps box which is $18 shipping and im willing to absorb that cost. However, now that I think it through a little, I am not including the battery cover. If you want it, it would be an extra $20 due to the additional shipping costs because it doesn't fit in a large usps priority box.

I'm pretty sure the trucks are standard 180mm. I can measure them with a caliper and get a bunch of pics when I get home this afternoon.

Had to ask. All my other parts are good. I've just bashed the motor mount a bit and I figured it would be good to have a spare ;)

Some photos of the stuff I'm selling. The walnut arbor axis deck is not included obviously. Also the original bushings are included not the green ones in the photo. 

I can include the deck and the battery cover but buyer pays shipping. 

All of this stuff for $170!

I have the battery, but the cells are low on voltage. The miltimeter tells me the output is 6.5 volts and its a 7s3p pack. Maybe they can be salvaged? I don't know.

$40 for the enclosure +ship, can use the the same motor, move the connector from the Yuneec ecu to the vesc, or you can replace on the motor end with just bullets and regular sensor connector
