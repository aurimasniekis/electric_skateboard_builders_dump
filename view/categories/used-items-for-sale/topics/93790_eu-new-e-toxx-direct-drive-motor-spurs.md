DIbs on the motors, Have you tried spinning them up? I've seen some post about whining APS motors. Would be great if you could test that.

I have not tried the motors, I would have to solder new connectors as they do not fit my actual controller.  I have 6 x APS motors and they have all worked perfectly out of the box.  I will give you your money back if you have any issues.

I own a pair of APS as well, they're not the same motor however so I'm a bit paranoid. Will PM you shortly :)

Hi, it's an old thread, but just in case, is the Direct Drive mount still for sale? And does it include a gear spur for 8mm shaft, or do you only have the 10mm gear spurs that you are selling separately?

Thanks
