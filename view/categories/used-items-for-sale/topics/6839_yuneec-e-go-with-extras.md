Yuneec E-go for sale. The board is used but in good condition. 

Its a fantastic great commuter board. The range is incredible. The speed is more than enough for commuting and perfect for beginners. This one comes with the controller and charger. Also I'll include two trucks with wheels (including the drive wheel) as well as motor shroud and belt. 

This is a great commuter board and perfect for getting into esk8'ing. This one only has 64km.

I ship to any location but buyer pays shipping. Board costs new $700 but I'm willing to part with it for $550.
