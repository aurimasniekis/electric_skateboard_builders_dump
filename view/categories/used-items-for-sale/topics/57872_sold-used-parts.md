The mbs 100mm's have been my daily's for about a month and going from them to six shooters is night and day, but on asphalt they are god awful, on concrete they feel like normal wheels on when ur riding on asphalt lol...

Thanks for the honest opinion...  however my roads are a bit rough and for $40 these seem like
a steal.

For 40 they are a steal, and with the Middle worn out they should be smoother, mine are staying rough because my 218's are warping, so my middles aren't wearing and I'm riding bumps

@Holyman92 thanks for the information. I hit 35mph on those wheels on pavement.  My other wheels are off Balanced (look warped) too on my other trucks which makes me think it’s my mount position, slave wheel is out of balance, or my 8mm axel is bent (im about 210lbs) 

There is one wheel more “used” than the other.

@Bobby do you still want the wheels? I have others willing to take them, thanks

218 trucks warping? Do you jump with your board cause I'm really heavy and I've jumped curbs and my trucks are fine, I did bend one axle but I wasnt on the board full throttle and the one wheel hit the wall

If the 218 are warping there must be something seriously wrong. Are you sure they are warping or is it that the axle is slightly bent?
