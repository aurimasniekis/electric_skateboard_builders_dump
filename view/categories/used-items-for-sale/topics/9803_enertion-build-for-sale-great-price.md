I'm selling my first build to fund a new one. this board is amazing and I love it. I took a bad spill 2 weeks ago (broke my collarbone) and I want to build a slower more stable board. the board goes about 35mph with my bigger battery 6s 5000mah. it comes with 2 sets of batteries 4 in total. batteries you can check out my add on ebay.

Not even close to a Boosted Board.... lol

I think you might get more money just selling it in parts. Someone will pounce on that VESC and Motor really fast...

Umm, I may have misinterpreted this, but f**k no. 35mph at 6s with a 14/36 gear ratio? Uh no. Sorry man just telling the truth. MAX speed should be more like 18-20mph.

You would need a 420KV motor to get to 35mph with that setup.
