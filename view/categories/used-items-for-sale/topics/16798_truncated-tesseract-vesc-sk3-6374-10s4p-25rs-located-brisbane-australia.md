I have too many boards.... I'm going to sell one. 
Any interest in my truncated tesseract?

[Build log is here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/e-tesseract-single-3kw-170kv-baja-spacecell-10s4p-caliber-2-rear-gullwing-sidewinder-front-abec-11-83mm/9438)
I've replaced the abec 11's with the new black 83mm evolve wheels as per the final pics.
I bought the board from George Li from baja boards on ebay, enertion vesc and spacecell, enclosure from evolve.
It's a great board, pulls up hills, max speed currently at 40k, is capable of a lot more.....but I aren't!
Have done around 1000 k on it. Have just been using it for commuting to the shops and to the gym.
Just finished my dual motor vanguard so can't see this getting ridden for a while.
Am located in Brisbane Australia, would look at postage within Australia but really, you would want to ride it first right?
Am also posting my evolve gen 2 carbon with all terrain setup on gumtree.

Tesseract is back on the market - motor has been replaced with a SK3 6374.
Need to free up funds for a mountainboard.

any interest in parts?
evolve/custom mount for 63mm motors on gullwing sidewinders, vesc, deck. SK3 6374 15t 15mm pulley
Probably keep the battery for my next build and shipping is a pain.

If you wanna get rid of the deck, I´d probably take it with the motor, if shipping to germany doesn´t kill it ;)
