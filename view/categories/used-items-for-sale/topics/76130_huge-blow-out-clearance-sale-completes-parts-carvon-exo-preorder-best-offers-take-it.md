Kinda realized the reality of the situation(No money to be made all custom builders have day jobs.) So now I'm selling all my stuff going to list what I payed for this stuff and what I hope to get.

Ok, take them, maybe he could ship mini remote together with your stuff, and then you could ship it to me. 

I am in Serbia... I dont know if that would be more or less expensive then shipping from USA to Serbia directly. 

Enjoy those 107s

Greatly appreciated. I think Shipping will be a ginormous pain in the ass to Serbia from the Netherlands let alone United States. Think the costs will be around 45$ for just the shipping. from the Netherlands to Serbia.
Just a guess no experience with shipping to Serbia :)

The reason you don't run them higher is because the higher the KV combined with higher voltage, you get pretty high top speeds. Motor controllers have RPM limits. Max I would go is 7-9s with these motors.

Now that I read the fine details shipping would be closer to the 200. Would have to ship to a US warehouse and they would ship to you. That would add about 30-40 dollars.
