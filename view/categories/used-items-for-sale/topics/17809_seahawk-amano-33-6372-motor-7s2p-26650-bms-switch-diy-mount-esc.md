Ha that's a BL-serie 5374 if I'm correct (outer diam is 63mm inner stator is 53mm) which should have around 190Kv.

Motor is reputed to be rock solid in R/C. No magnets or bearing issues.

I had 2x units like that few yeras ago, sold them unused to fund other parts.

Glad to hear (and glad to see you again then) ! I kinda feel kindness toward your board now haha

And that's a fair sale price for what's under the hood.
