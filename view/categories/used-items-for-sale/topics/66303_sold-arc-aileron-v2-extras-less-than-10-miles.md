[SELL] Arc Aileron V2 + Extras. Located in SoCal (Inland Empire).

I've decided to sell my Aileron V2 because I've realized that I just don't care for the feel of shorter boards. I've ridden the board less than 10 miles (right around 6-7 miles total).

Here's how much I'm into it:
* Arc Aileron V2 with 90mm Wheels - $1,199
* Pre-Order Discount - -$100
* Arc 97mm Wheels - $80 (Got these for free. Thanks Arc!)
* Extra Arc 3A Fast Charger - $65
* Arc ShredLights Combo (2 Headlights, 1 Tail light) - $58
* Shipping & Handling - $80

In total, I'm in it about $1,300. I'm willing to let this go for an even $1,000. I'd prefer a local deal, but I'm open to shipping it for the cost of shipping.

It might be tough to sell a prebuilt like that for a price so close to retail.  Especially here.

Have you considered selling on reddit?
More likely to find a buyer over there.

@goldrabe I have it posted on Reddit, as well :slight_smile:
@b264 They are both 38V 3A chargers. Arc uses a 9s2p battery pack. :+1:

Good luck with the sale brother.  Selling complete boards in this forum can be tough 
I couldn‚Äôt get any offers above $1000 for my raptor 2 so I ended up parting it out lol

Unscrew and rippin things apart is easy, getting it all sold is another matter.
Things that are easy to sell: 

Board(dibs): 100 bucks min (150 brand new)
trucks and wheels+motor and mount, 125 bucks min
Battery with bms(unless integrated with esc ofc) and charger (but harder to ship), no idea about the wh of this battery but another 150-200 bucks easly

the enclosure and with esc and remote is a harder sell. And i understand you want your moneys worth since the total is alot higher :stuck_out_tongue:  but you know.. support your local DiY hub etc !

Price updated one last time, here and on Reddit, before I think about starting to part it out.

@linsus Yeah, I'm not too worried about pulling it all apart - more just the hassle of having to sell all of it separately lol
