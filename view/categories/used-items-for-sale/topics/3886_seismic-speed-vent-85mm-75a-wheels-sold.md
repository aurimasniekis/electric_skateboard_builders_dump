I thought it's better to list them individually so that there's less confusion. Last time I did it all on one post ended up with people confused over which item is which lol

I'd be interested if you included the wheel gear you drilled them for!  (for additional cost of gear of course).  Where are you located?  shipping cost?  PM maybe?

(super old thread... whoops! if still available PM me)
