Sup guys and gals. 
I have over the last few days collected and refurbished a lot of my esk8 parts that I do not use. I also decided to part out my [Mall Grabber](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/whats-my-mall-grabber-worth/50089?u=fraannk) since I wanted to use some of the parts myself. 
Most of these parts are used for quite some miles, but I just repainted and refurbished them, so that they look like new. 

**WILLING TO TRADE FOR EVOLVE AT KIT OR 97mm+ WHEELS**

Broken MayTech VESC ‚Äì <strike>**30‚Ç¨**</strike> **ON HOLD**
I'm actually not sure if it's the DRV or a MOSFET that's broken. Will test if anyone is interested. 
![IMG_8671|666x500](upload://j5TEDY4DKa0vlBMIJqXQfLtywD0.JPG)

Generic 22" deck with griptape and my logo (#ad) ‚Äì <strike>**20‚Ç¨**</strike> **NOW 15‚Ç¨** 
I just applied new clear coat on the backside to withstand wet conditions. Comes with mounting hardware for an enclosure. (And a Boosted arrow :wink:)
![IMG_2877|690x239](upload://vWEtz8iE1PQ48GYg1R4J7tTgdOe.JPG)

3D printed but surprisingly sturdy enclosure ‚Äì **15‚Ç¨**
Fits the deck above. Re-painted but has a few scratches. Cutouts for XT90, VGA and a on/off button. Also two cutouts in the back, one for phase wires and one for power to LED strips. Rubber gasket included.
![IMG_1813|690x428](upload://zuk4WNRFSYn81RofmYKjZyoHcNW.JPG)

**BUY BOTH DECK AND ENCLOSURE AND SAVE 5‚Ç¨!**

I will probably have more parts here soon. 
Let me know if you're interested, and I will send more pics and measurements.
**LOCATED IN DENMARK/EU ‚Äì YOU PAY SHIPPING**

I have had the motor apart once to clean it, but the motor bearings has never been changed or serviced. Seems like they're still in OK condition though. Theres no c-clip, but I' not sure theres supposed to be.

vedder anti spark

standard stuff but I'm really happy how everything turned out at a great price. 470‚Ç¨ all in all and using only high quality components.

Thanks guys!

Non the less, might write u a PM, if nobody rushes and grabs these 2 parts

Hey Fraannk , Amazing build by the way super portable and amazing specs for the price. Im also trying a small 24' Mirco-Me deck build just except with hub motors just that the deck is kinda expensive but looks like you've manged to fit a a 10s2p and a vesc on a 22' Amazing.I was interested in buy your 22' deck and enclosure not sure if they're still available but HMU if they are.

If you want to make a small built those decks are nice because of the wheelbase. I have the same deck but the 27" version  i am pretty sure it is way more stable thanvdor instance a 31" cruiser deck. No wobbles at 45kmh...the only downside of these decks is the lack of concave. Hope for you it is still available .

Do have picture of enclosure placed under the deck?

I still havent figured out what trucks might be needed for such board..

If roads were better i might have sticked to penny board idea.. though roads are so bad here u always have to be for a lookout where to cut pass in grass, gravel or other uneven road surfaces..

So yeh... shootout to get it out to someone.. not sure why it is not 'moving' lol
