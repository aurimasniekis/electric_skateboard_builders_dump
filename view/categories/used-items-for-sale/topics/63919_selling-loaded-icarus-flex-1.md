I'm selling my Loaded Icarus Flex 1 deck. Excellent condition, hardly used. I'm asking for 180$ or best offer that I get until this Tuesday, and pick-up only in Berkeley, CA!

I'm selling all my stuff, because I'm moving to Germany on Friday. You can check out my other stuff as well:

Not ESkate related so I won't go into detail, but if you are coming over to pick it up anyway, I'm also selling an Epiphone Les Paul Studio and an Ibanez W310. So PM me if you are interested. All my shit needs to go until Friday...
