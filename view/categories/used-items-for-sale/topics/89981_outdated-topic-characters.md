150 EUR per piece is a bit steep. 149 EUR was the [price for new at unikboards](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/focbox-motor-controller/). I doubt anyone will pay 300 EUR for two used focboxes when they can have the Unity for $250. BTW, I'm selling mine for less than 100 EUR.

125-130 euro is a fair deal for one Focbox

As it is a rule here if you want ot sell things, I would kindly ask you to add some pictures.

Did you modifiy something (change of bullet connectors xt60 to xt90 or similar) ?

How old those are? Are they from the last batch and version1.7 (it´s written on the pcb) ?

The Focboxes never left my house. I only tested the board in my Bedroom to see if it works. Haven`t used it since. So they have like at most 20m on them. Sell them because i will be upgrading to a Unity
