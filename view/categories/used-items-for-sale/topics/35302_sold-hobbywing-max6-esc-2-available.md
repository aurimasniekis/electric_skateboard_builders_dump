Heâ€™s in the U.S because he said international is extra shipping, and $185 is in USD

Correct. Please PM me if interested.

I have been out about 5 times with them. No off-roading it's my first build and started a second. So hours... i went thru 3 battery charges of use... maybe 5-6 hrs of use. They come with box, etc because they are fairly new.

Priced to sell quickly.
