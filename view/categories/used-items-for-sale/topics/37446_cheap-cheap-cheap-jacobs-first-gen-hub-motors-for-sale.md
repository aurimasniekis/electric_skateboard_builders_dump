Hi there,
I got 6x small and 6x big hub motors from Jacob's first production batch with plenty of unused CNCed urethane wheels.
They all work, however some have a few screws (for the front plate) missing and some also have slightly damaged wires.
These motors are collecting dust in my workshop as I prefer my sensored belt-driven setups.
Any takers? Preferably I would like to sell them all in one go...shipped from Taiwan.
Gimme an offer I can't refuse.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/0/a0e52bdd2d684f1a7ee4d30574b83e98129f7462.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/f/3f007c598ddb740a2ef8cdfe4518019ed84716fa.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/0/50d947247e2f9c45a57c6e62eb3640e5fa55038e.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c6954b586bc67d02fc46f4690931311ffb5dc452.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/6/76251ff67fc7bc03dd8abb6cff32ebe7598fc4d5.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/988f0e02aa978909d01f1c33bc5d5a042c410167.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/4/b498a31cdede78bf4c112c40aa527c75de7f8759.jpg" width="375" height="500">

I'm tempted but I have no need for so many or hubs in general lol, got carvons ordered. All that being said, I would do a 3way split with 2 other people in the US..

Edit: nvm, Im really never gonna use them myself and will just end up selling them at cost later lol
