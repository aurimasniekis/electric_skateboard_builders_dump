Hi Everyone,

Up for sale is a 12s7p battery made by the man @barajabali. I have put about 400 miles on this battery and it is in perfect working order. This is the battery you get if you never want to worry about running out of juice. I have gone 30 miles on this battery and still had about 20% battery left! The reason I am selling is for a smaller build. Sale also comes with charger and includes shipping in the US! Reach out to me with any questions.

Because I donâ€™t really need it but if someone needs the money Iâ€™d throw $400 at it. A simple no from him is all thatâ€™s required. Anything I sold on here, has been lowballed and I eventually sold it for low because sitting on it was pointless.... stay in your lane

If this was 10S8P I'd be all over it.  12S is too high for comfort, for me

Last time I checked you sold lipos to someone that were no good and they complained about it , about the swelling

That was me, this Beggar sold me lipo that doesn't charge to 4.2v, based on balance wire burn he must have shorted. Described "Practically brand new" 

Than he calls me "cheap"

Stay away from this bag of D's

Brand new pack of this 12s7p is $875, asking for $400 is an insult.

Cells alone is $400. again no standard from this guy

I threw the other 2 away and they were perfectly fine just like the ones I sent you. Iâ€™m not cheap by any means (I have a modded BGT by LHB and a Dual 6374 12s4p beast while youâ€™re ordering a 2 used lipos in another country) BUT IM THE BEGGAR ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ 

Youâ€™re quoting these battieres like theyâ€™re brand new. For all we know this guy could of ran through this pack and not set the cut off settings right.
