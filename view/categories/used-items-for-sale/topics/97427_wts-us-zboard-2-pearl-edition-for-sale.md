I ran into an old thread and it seemed like quite a few people were interested in a ZBoard 2 pearl. I have one that I bought to commute to work with, and by the time they got it to me I had changed jobs and had to drive. The thing maybe has like 30 minutes on it and runs great. It's an awesome board but I have no real use for it anymore. The list price is $1499 US. Iâ€™ll let it go for $1000 and you pay the shipping. I am located in Texas, and I can send pics if anyone is interested.

Oh boy I just looked at what a Zboard even is, and it's way overpriced for its specs. You might have more luck selling that thing on other sale platforms like ebay, craigslist or facebook, yuck.
