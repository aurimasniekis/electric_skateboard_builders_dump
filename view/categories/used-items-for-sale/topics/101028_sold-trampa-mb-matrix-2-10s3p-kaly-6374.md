SOLD  Selling one of my boards, I moved to SoCal and don’t ride it anymore- 1100 plus PayPal fees and shipping. 

I put razor go cart wheels on as an experiment with special bearings and shin but will include the original bearings.

I don’t have any pics opened up but can take some of the outside this evening. 

It has only been ridden for a few hours.  I have 3 boards and this was the last one I made before moving to SoCal. It is too crazy here to ride other than around the block, so I’m selling.  If u don’t like the wheels I will include the 10mm bearings for normal cruzer or off road wheels.
