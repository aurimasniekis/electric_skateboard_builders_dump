That’s the worst click bait method I’ve seen. 🤣
BTW, I would snatch those mounts and pulleys if you weren’t 8000 miles away. 😝

I've been to Mt Gravatt a couple of times, both times specifically to go to Garden City shopping centre. It's freakin huge. We definitely forgot to look at the section of the carpark we parked in one time and lost our car for a good half-hour :man_facepalming:

Hah well I avoid Garden City if I can help it, but there are definitely some cool tracks up Mt Gravatt itself for mountainboarding!
