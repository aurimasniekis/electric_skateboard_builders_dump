Judging by the dirt inside the enclosure and around the cells I assume the pack has more than 15 charge cycles. Where are you based?

I cant understand why anyone would want a battery in this condition, can you explain?

imo... some items are better off properly scrapped :eyes: 

(my own space cell was in that group too... lol)

If it's anything like how my space cell was (virtually same wear and tear, water damage looks the same too) it's trashed.
