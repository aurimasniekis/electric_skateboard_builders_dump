While this is in used- it has been trialed without electronics.

Offering a beautiful setup for cheap to Europe:

This includes:
Board- Real Dirt
Trucks - Trampa Vertigo
Bindings - Trampa
Wheels- Hypa hubs and 8 in primo Tyre
Motor Mounts
Pulleys
Belts
All for 400 euros plus shipping

I can include 2xnew  6374 motors with sensors with axel's that would need to be cut for an additional 

180 euros.

Can you tell me something about the 2 motors, I would be interested in them, only them if you want to sell them sepretted. If so, can you tell me what shipping to Hungary would be?

No motors will be 210 if sold without board. Purchase from one of the group buys a year ago or so. Never used. Long axel's with sensors

Where do you ship them from?

Thank you for quick respond. I will think on that. But to be honest, I saw sealed maytec motors for 115 shipped. And they seem to be very nice, and about the same price on the end.
