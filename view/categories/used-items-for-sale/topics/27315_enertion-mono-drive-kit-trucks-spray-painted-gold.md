Switched drive trains and haven't used it having it take up space isn't helping meðŸ˜‚ It was honestly great but my area isn't hilly and my single carvon has worked great so far so I sadly must say bye, funny thing is I flipped a coin to decide

Okay! $250 seems a bit high tbh. Would you consider $190? Just that i have a set budget, and you know, gotta conserve. You will be saving many lives if you lower it to $190 for me. Think of all the good you can do!

Ohh okay gotcha and I'm seriously considering that but I'm a college student so money is tight and I don't wanna have a crap board bc I don't have the money to buy an expensive one ya know? Do you think 150-200 would get me anything reliable?

Short answer no

Edit: it doesn't have to be a thousand dollar board but except to spend 500 dollars if you want something that you feel comfortable carrying around with zero issues a 10s4p batter is roughly 400-450 dollars alone. I think you would need to be really creative or have access to a lot of tools to build a good one for less. At 100 dollars is about what u will spend on a good esc

Even used will bring you over 500. Many of these parts can last a lifetime if kept in good condition

I'd just like to point out that I'm a college student too, and my first build was pretty kick-ass and cost less than $500, so I do think it's do-able.

ESC: VESC - $120
Motor: 6374 sk3 - $70
Batteries: 2x  3s, 5000 mah lipo - $46
trucks: caliber II on amazon - $35
wheels: 83 mm flywheel clones - $25
gearing: abec 16/36 from Torqueboards - $47
motor mount: Hobbyking one: $8 (I didn't use this but its the cheapest option right now)
charger: hobbyking lipo charger: $23
remote: G2B - $25
board: existing penny deck I already had.

Total: $399

And then add another $50 for wiring, connectors, and diy enclosure.

Yea I wouldn't take lipos around though someone here burnt down there house and Idk who has time in college to sit next to them while they are charging. I think it's doable but after a few months you will want to replace things or have to replace the loops if they puff which happens sometimes at random

## \#39 Posted by: pennyboard Posted at: 2017-08-02T06:08:21.542Z Reads: 50

```
I literally left mine in my dorm room charging all the time while I slept/went to dinner. No problems with them, and that was without even balance charging (cause I'm too lazy to do it). Did have to replace 1, but it was more preventative than anything.

I honestly think the whole lips blowing up thing it over-blown. Of course everyone hears about it when some off-brand cheap limo blows, but no one hears about the thousands of lipos that don't have any problems. 
I'm not saying it can't happen, just that it's less common than it's made out to be.

Haha It's not garunteed but when I'm putting my roommates life and personal belongings in potential danger well I just wouldn't take the risk but good point I should have told him if he used lipos it was much more possible

Yeah, that's good point.

And yeah that's true, using lipos vs lions in this situation deffinetly makes the difference between under $500 or over $500.

[/quote]

LiPo route would definitely save money on a build, That was the most expensive part for me

I'm sure with a balance charger and no abuse LiPos would be safe. I totally would charge the way you do 20 years ago (damn I feel old) when I was your age living in a dorm room, but now with a family and a house I own and three cars in the garage, I take potential fire hazards with a lot more caution.
