I built this battery (one of many) less than 6 months ago and it’s only seen 4 cycles as it’s not my main board. I had plans to make this my dedicated off road board with the ability to change battery boxes.

Here's a link to more photos of this build: [10s4p 30Q Battery Box Build](https://www.shueboxed.com/post/10s4p-lithium-ion-battery-box-42v-60a-cont-12-000mah)

Pelican 1150 Case which holds everything with room to spare (keys, wallet)

*two holes in the bottom that secured it to the board (Holypro)
10S4P - Samsung 30Q’s
Bestech 80A BMS (HCX-D223V1) from BKB wired for charge and discharge
Volt Gauge
On/Off Switch
Charge Port
XT60 Output (with cap, just have to find it)

Asking $300+ shipping or can meet in/around Tampa (will be in Orlando Thursday and Friday as well).

I can check shipping rates if you PM me your address - any questions just let me know!
