Hi, i recently sold my evolve GTX and i just realised that i still have my old gt remote left that i have no use for anymore, the remote is in good condition. At one point the micro usb connector fell of from the circuitboard. I replaced the micro usb port with a new one that i soldered into place. Everthing works as it should! 

If anyone is interested i would like to sell it for 40â‚¬ + shipping from Sweden.
