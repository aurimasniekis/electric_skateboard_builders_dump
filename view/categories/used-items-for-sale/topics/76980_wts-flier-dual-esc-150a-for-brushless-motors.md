Bought it like 2 months ago and never could figure out to to use, so switched to vesc. So bought it for 250 trying to get a 100 or another vesc if anyone wants to trade. Then I bought it from hobby king. ![15438932585688019015583115059576|375x500](upload://AsTyf79c06Iy3vKPTnGM6Y6D6Zp.jpeg) ![15438932994072307784610640873349|375x500](upload://m1QlMLX8hMHxbYb2iXtAqgZQrAU.jpeg)![15439262487707207104151342834203|375x500](upload://CG6vTWacMT2ldHzRW41tZP5yqC.jpeg)

changed the title so that people understand that you want to sell it and added the company you bought it from.
Good luck with your sale!
