Decided I want smaller wheels (83mm instead) since my board is only 32" and a top mount.  Barely used, only been on the road for about 200 feet lol.  Just trying to recoup some of the money I wasted.  US only.  Let me know if you want pictures of them.  Here's the manufacturers picture.  Thanks! :grin:

Title is misleading. These aren't flywheels but flywheel clones
