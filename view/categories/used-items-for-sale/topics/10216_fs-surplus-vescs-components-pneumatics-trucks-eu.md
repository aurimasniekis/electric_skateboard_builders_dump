I'm selling off surplus stuff to clear out my hobby room.
I'm located in Belgium, will ship to EU only.
I won't split the lots. Take 'em or leave 'em.
PM me if you're interested.

----------

## Full set of AlienDriveSystem's 5" pneumatic wheels
Complete with bearings, tyres, inners, 60t pulleys, belts and 3 spare inners.
Brand new, zero road time.

## Set of VESC's, components and programmer/debugger
* 4 x DRV8302DCA mosfet driver - new in packaging
* 2 x STM32F405RGT6 microcontroller - new in packaging
* 2 x Nichicon 63V 2200uF capacitor - new unused
* 1 x STLINK V2 programmer/debugger - used/working
* 2 x VESC V4.11 - not working

The VESC's are two remaining units from a run of 10, which I was unable to flash firmware to. 
They are sold as-is. A decent hobbyist should be able to get them up and running.
