Last time I checked these cells were not designed for 20 amps maxiumum discharge.

These cells are designed for 8-10A Continous, 15A burst (85D and down) or 20A burst (90D and up)

Also I dont think the 85D had 3.4Ah cells, thats only in the new 90/100D packs (although if im wrong please let me know!)

I'll give you $50 for one, because the time it's going to take me to break it down and build what I need will cost me too many hours to make it a viable option, sorry..

at 74P those numbers look more like a wire-vaporising 594-740A continuous, 1110A burst (85D and down) or 1480A burst (90D and up)

Are you selling them here thinking that people will split the cells out individually?

it's $1425 / 444 cells, that's $3.2 per cell, then whoever gets it will have to break them down into individual cells.  30q are about $3.6 per cell shipped so...not sure if this'd make sense.

unless...take the whole module, keep it intact, then mount trucks to it.  the module becomes the deck.

genius.

That's correct, ludicrous mode on the P90/P100D will peak around 1500A, they had to switch to inconel contactors to keep it all from melting. The motors themselves can draw something around 150KW each.

Don't forget while those are the peak specs of the cell, Tesla definitely doesn't draw that much out of it, they're aiming for as long life as possible and the less you stress your cells the better

Hmm, these seem like the perfect size to wire in series at 12s and put them on this thing. It's one thing to go the farthest or the fastest, but how about the MOSTEST! Time to set a record for the biggest, longest, fastest group Esk8 ride on ONE E-skateboard. Who's with me?! I'm thinking 4wd, VESC 6's, 12s74p, 120-100 motors, giant Six Shooter wheels...umm...

@BigBoyToys I'm using all my Jedi Force powers :robot: to draw you back to the community ASAP, cause I think this is a project that would have your name all over it. Even if it is just a crazy thought experiment. :pray: :muscle:

12S74P

Even I don't think that ridiculous.  I was thinking 10S74P  :stuck_out_tongue:

Well, they're already configured as 6s74p, so it just makes sense to go 12s. Plus the VESC 6 should be able to handle the voltage, but how many amps x4 until they explode? 600 amps? 26,000 watts? I kind of really want to build this now.

You'd need motors with multiple sets of windings and one esc per set.

Yeap, pretty much what I thought.... but in the end... who said I know something about this, right? Could be anything to someone, an electric sled for Santa, 444 cell blender, or a super duper eboard for the 4th of July.
