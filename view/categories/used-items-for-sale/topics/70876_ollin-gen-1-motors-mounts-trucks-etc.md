Re-listed due to sale falling through.
Spare base plates of varying angles, spare hangers , bushings etc . 
One of the motor mounts has a snapped bolt which will need drilling out however this doesnâ€™t affect its function (the newer Ollin mounts donâ€™t even have the bolt/thread hole).

If you want to split it up, I'd take a single mount if the price is right.
