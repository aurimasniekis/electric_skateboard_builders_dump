Hey guys. I decided I want to sell my Enertion Raptor 1.0. I've added MBS all terrain wheels which are amazing. I've had a fair share of issues with the raptor, so this purchase would be ideal for someone with a decent amount of DIY experience as there is some repair needed. The board has about 30-40 miles on it, but one of the bullet connectors from a motor has come unattached and needs to be resoldered back on. The board would come with a second battery, but its On/Off switch snapped (the button) and also needs to be fixed. I have the part but not the expertise. Having 2 batteries really extends the range massively. I''ve realized that e-boarding is amazing but i think i'm switching to downhill mountain biking for more excersize. 

Im open to all offers for the board. I'm located in Denver, Colorado, but would be willing to ship domestically <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/c/bc699aac62fd718d298af8dc9c9dd74535de7f8d.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Open to all offers that are reasonable. With light use (been in storage all winter) I was hoping not to take a huge loss on it

@ZackoryCramer It is still available. I realized the issue was one of wires coming out of the VESC had vibrated loose and I got a PCB board tech to resolder it, and I rode it in the fall. I'd come consider selling it, PM an offer and we can talk
