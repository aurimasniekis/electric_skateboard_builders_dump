Bought this new last month and build a pack for my board. Everything works perfect and all original accessories included such as the petal switch, weld wand,soldering iron, spare fuse, etc.  Probably even have the original box. 
$200 new , selling for $140 plus shipping. I also have a bunch of pack building supplies Iâ€™ll let go for cheap as well. ![image|375x500](upload://vy7kLQnjFRbNQz044ElYnngS0qc.jpeg)
