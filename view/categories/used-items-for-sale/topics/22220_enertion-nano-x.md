Okay I finally received the replacement receiver from Enertion so I am putting up the nano x for sale.

This is brand new and was only used to test the first time around which is when I found out that the receiver was faulty. Took a few months but finally got the replacement from Enertion.

$50 Net + $5 for shipping takes it.

After doing all the math for all of this one would be saving about $300 all in. That's including shipping. And keep in mind all of these parts are new and I can forward on invoices.

Will consider $1100 shipped

Just letting you know, if you were to part this out, you would probably get everything you put into it and get rid of everything a bit faster.
