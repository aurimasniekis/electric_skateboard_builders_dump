Truly like new Evolve Carbon GT 2 in 1 with a ton of accessories for sale. As you can see in the photos, it has barely been used at all with only 14 charge cycles total. Look at the tread on the AT tires and the condition of the Abec 11 wheels, as well as the stock Evolve wheels, and you will see that it really hasn't been ridden much at all. I just don't have the time to ride, due to work. Unfortunately I can't use it to commute to work.

So here's the list of gear:

Evolve Carbon GT 2 in 1
Evolve Standard Remote (not the R2)
Evolve GT Street Wheels (83mm 76a)
Alec 11 Fly Wheels (97mm 75a)
Evolve GT All Terrain Wheels
Gears and belts included for both Street and AT wheels, of course
Evolve Standard Charger AND Fast Charger
Venom HPF Green Bushings (93a) upgrade along with stock orange Evolve bushings
Original manual and paperwork, and Evolve Skate key
Flatland 3D Trigger Guard (for Evolve Standard Remote)

I am not interested in shipping this package, so local pick up only. Cash preferred, although I will accept Paypal, or a cashier's check from a bank or a USPS money order check
All of this cost me $2600.00

$1700.00

Interested buyers may contact me via PM, or at
