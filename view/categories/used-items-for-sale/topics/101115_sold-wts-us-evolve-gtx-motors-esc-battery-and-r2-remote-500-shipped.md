Motors are bought new in June, everything else are just over 1 year old. everything works
as it should. Was lucky enough to never experience cut outs with this remote. Can provide proof if requested. Not looking to part out at this time. I am selling because I am upgrading everything on the GTX.

Just showing off my collection cause itâ€™s my first time selling on here. Been in this hobby for 10 years.
