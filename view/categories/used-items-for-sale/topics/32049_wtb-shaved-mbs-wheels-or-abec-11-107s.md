You can shave them yourself. Just do it the @Kaly way ðŸ˜‰

Why would you want shaved wheels?

More traction since the MBS wheels are convex

Then why would you buy them in the first place?

I want taller wheels than the 97mm  and they also have a wider contact patch. But I just realized that after you shave them they are smaller by 2mm according to Kaly. So I guess superflys it is.

I have a set of the older 74a (orange hubs sry) they are new but you might need to lathe them down.   Is the whole point is you don't want to modify them ?  In that case sounds like waiting for the superflys will work.
