WIll post photos once im home, this is to fund my improved board so im selling my 6s tb pack with a pre programmed esc, Both for $300 shipped in the U.S. The battery has exactly 4 recharges on it and is able to get a 245kv motor up to 22-23mph flat, 15-19mph uphill esc was also bought from tb and so far has had 0 issues, all parts are a few weeks old.
