@Auris you might have a better chance to sell over at forum.
this forum is old and has problems, most of us ''migrated'' over to forum..
Also, shipping a battery is fine within europe, i had someone ship a battery from the uk to france and it cost 15Euro, if it is ground shipping then you don't need to tell the shipping company, but make sure to disconnect everything before shipping the board and battery to avoid discharge and fire hazard. it is super rare to have li-ions catch fire.
Cheers
