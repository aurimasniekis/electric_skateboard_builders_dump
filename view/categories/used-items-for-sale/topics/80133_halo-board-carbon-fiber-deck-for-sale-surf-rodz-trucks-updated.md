Hi Everyone,

Selling a halo board carbon fiber deck. I was originally going to use it to build an other board when I removed the stock electronics and to put in better components. However I've decided to move on to a different project.

Looking to get about $160 for it. 

The deck is missing 4x M4 counter sunk screws for the ESC/electronics plate that I can't find at my place. It uses the same screws as the top plate. The rest of the hardware is included.

I will also include Surf Rodz TPK 177m machined green trucks - in great condition. It is also missing 2 nuts and 2 spacers that I happened to misplace. Those are pretty easy to get. I would recommend running Zealous bearings as they include the spacers.


Located in SF Bay Area, will ship only in United States as I do not want to deal with customs and international shipping (unless you can pay extra and help me out with the complexities).

I could ship to the EU or world wide, but would need the buyer to cover for the additional shipping costs.

I would like something like this but I am unsure as to the max size of battery you could fit into that cavity...Hoping to put a 10s5p or even 12s4p...? Is that unrealistic do you think?

The deck supports a 10s3p configuration with BMS. Here's a photo of the batteries it used as well as the stock inside as a reference. You can easily fit a Unity or 2 VESCs in there without issue. On the rear where the motor phase wires come out, is a spot for a charger port and power switch (go with anti-spark).

Battery dimensions are:
Dimensions: 330mm x 140mm x 20.5mm (LxWxH)

The deck has a little bit less space as the Enertion Raptor 1 lengthwise, but also 6mm depth-wise.

I don't think a 10s4p pack will fit inside this deck.

That's the plan... well eventually. For now I might just stow a notebook in there on my way to class :wink:

From the looks of it, a 10s4p can be fitted. It will be a really tight squeeze. 
If you do that, I would bypass the BMS for discharge and somehow place it between 2 VESCs as a small BMS will fit. Recommended to look for 4-5A charge, which are small.

If you use a dual VESC or Unity, it may be hard to fit the BMS in. I'll leave it to you guys for your build. 
The 5th post has a tear down of the battery for your reference.

Could you please let me know your set up to fit 10s4p to haloboard deck. I'm also a haloboard deck user and my battery builder cant find a way to to fit larger than 10s3p.

hmm Weird, length is enough for me, for a flat 10s4p (even got a little room), the problem was height, which I fixed by using some dense foam on the side to support the weight on the side, not the battery
