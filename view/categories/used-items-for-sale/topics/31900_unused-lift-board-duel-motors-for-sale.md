The motors have not been used but when they were shipped to me they got kinda beat up... not sure how but you can tell it was side impacts that caused the scrapes. They work with up to 9s batteries (i asked the lifttboard people but they seemed kind unsure about this, i would run it with 8s). Comes with everything shown:) im asking $100 plus shipping
