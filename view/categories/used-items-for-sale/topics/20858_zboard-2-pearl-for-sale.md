Took delivery of a ZBoard 2 Pearl I backed on Indiegogo, but since backing I started building my own boards and have no need for another. 

Tried it out for about 10km. Works great! See their website for specifics. [ZBoard 2 Pearl Edition](https://www.zboardshop.com/products/zboard-2-pearl)

List price is $1499 US. I'll let it go for $1000...buyer pays shipping. Located in Canada.

It really is. ZBoard did a great job on this one but I just don't have room to keep it. It's almost time to sell some of my spare parts too.

:joy:Well, it was worth a try! Sorry for the lowball offer, I don't have much of a budget. I might check back with you in 4months though when I have the money.

What's it like riding a board with no remote?

Took a few Km to get used to it, but started to feel "normal" after awhile. 

The board itself is really nice. The foot pads modulate speed by the amount of pressure you put on them. They have decent sensitivity. The brakes are favoured by the firmware so you can sort of leave your front foot over the front pad and pivot your back foot to hit the brakes when you need them.

I think my biggest reservation with the board is the braking. I'd be afraid my foot wouldn't be close enough to the brake pad if anything sudden happened

The pads are pretty big. I find the most natural stance is to have my rear foot right in front of the pad. When I need to brake I just pivot my foot and my heel is right over the pad.

Yeh, but how sudden are you going to brake, anyways? I like the idea A LOT although I haven't had a chance to try it yet. This or stress sensors on the front truck.

Hi,

Yes it’s still for sale. Still only about 10km on it. $800US plus shipping is my bottom line. That’s a great deal. 

Let me know!

Possibly interested for if it’s still available. Where in Canada are you situated? Since I also live in Canada (BC), I’d be very interested if it’s not far. Thanks!

I’m in AB. About 45 minutes from the BC border via the #1. 

I roll through BC pretty often. I could deliver depending where you are. 

Cheers.

Hey, did you manage to swap the board for some cash? If not, I would be keen to buy it — as long as you're still willing to ship it, cause I live on different continent :)

I still have it. It just sits in my living room untouched. Still only about 10km on it. 

Where are you located? I could look into shipping to another continent but I’d be concerned about the batteries getting flagged.

That might be problem. Here is some info, don't know if it's relevant: https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/tdg/lithium-batteries-are-dangerous-goods-1162.html .

I live in Finland and reveiving the battery shouldn't be an issue here. Maybe we could continue via private message so I can pass You my poatal code for a shipping quote?

Hey man, feel like selling it to a fellow Canuck? Been saving for this model for a while now, but both the Blue and Pearl have been sold out for a while (maybe ZBoard is going under?). If it's still available let me know!

Are you still interested in the Zboard 2 pearl? I have one that I bought to commute to work with, and by the time they got it to me I had changed jobs and had to drive. The thing maybe has like 30 minutes that I put on it in a parking lot.
