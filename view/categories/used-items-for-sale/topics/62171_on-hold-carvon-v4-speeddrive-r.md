<h2>holding for @Blacksheep, sale on hold for now</h2>

direct drive life is just not for me.

looking to get rid of my carvon v4 SDr.

product page:

https://www.carvonskates.com/collections/parts/products/carvon-v4-speeddrive

$600 shipped US, $630 the world.

paypal to igbad@hotmail.com friends+fam, or price + 4% goods+svcs.

it's been hooked up, calibrated, and tested.  in short, it's used but barely.  it's been run about 10 times up and down the corridor inside my building and run once on the street for about half a mile or one km.

**phase wires have been shortened and bullets replaced to 4mm.**

i like the ride but not all that impressed with startup torque.  top speed is no concern to me so just going to stick with satellite setups.

be aware of the issues before going into it:
