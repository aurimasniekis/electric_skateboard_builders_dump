The r-specs both have a metal pin in the stator to stop the stator from spinning if the epoxy broke.  When i bought these, that was a problem so I just did the mod. 

They are not sensored.

```
Drill a few inch hole between the stator and the inner housing that holds the bearings. Usually the bond is done with epoxy but in that batch there was risk of the epoxy breaking so a mechical pin would stop it from moving if it does break
