Hey guys,
After winning a GoPro giveaway some time ago I got a huge pile of unused GoPro mounts and accessories collecting dust on my shelf because I don't need them. 
As there are quite a lot of you guys using GoPros to make videos I thought of selling them here or willing to trade a fair amount of them for parts you have to offer.

I'm from Germany and willing to ship everywhere you are paying the shipping cost to ;)

I don't think he intended it that way. As I do, he's probably trying to trade for parts for a build. Money isn't the only thing that talks lol. Just ask @Skunk.

I think it's related to the esk8 community as quite a lot of users on here are using GoPros.

exactly, if I aimed for selling it to the highest bidder I would have put it somewhere else to sell
