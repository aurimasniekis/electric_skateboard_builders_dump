Mmmmm, very possibly interested. I'll tell you what, can you send me a PM if you don't mind, what you think is a reasonable offer? 

Just FYI I'm in between dropping on building my own battery soon or just sticking with what I got, so no guarantees. Either way, GLWS

Why don't you just keep it and do some more research into how to build a proper pack?

These things are easily remedied...

I know how to build a pack correctly now but I like having the feeling that my pack was built by a professional. :rofl:
