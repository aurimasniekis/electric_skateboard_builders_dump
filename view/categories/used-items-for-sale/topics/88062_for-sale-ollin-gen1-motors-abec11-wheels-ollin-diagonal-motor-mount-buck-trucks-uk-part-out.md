So? You can clearly see with your own eyes that every part of this has more than 20 miles. You buying something advertised as that doesnâ€™t make it true. And, by then advertising the same, you are blatantly lying to potential customers.

I sold them a while back . Showed all the pics of the condition of all the parts and happy to buy them all back for what I sold them for. Never said theyâ€™d only had 20 miles on though . Not sure where that figure was pulled from ??

People can ask whatever they want, doesnâ€™t matter what they paid. Are you really trying to shame the seller into lowering his price?

I agree about lying about the condition.

no its allright a while back i got roasted for some stupid threads i started

i ended up paying Â£215 for them so $300 is actually equal to Â£225 meaning i am making Â£10

also sorry about the 20 mile figure that was from a different drive train that i bought 
therefore i changed it

sorry if anyone misunderstood me

also if anyone wants i have 50 samsung 30q batteries for sale and a vruzend battery kit
all new(look on my other thread)

also for your knowledge i am selling them as it was to complicated for me to make them compatible with my fesc as it has only five pins with no temp sensor(motors)

so if anyone has another 6 pin drive train for sale then please tell me looking for one

yes i do 

however buying extension cords because the motors are diagonal is also annoying since i have a dual flipsky fesc

also i bought an adapter from flipsky but it was to small for the sensors
