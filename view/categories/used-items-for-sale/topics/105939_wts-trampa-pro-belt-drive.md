Since I recently got my geardrives I am selling my complete trampa pro belt drive. They still work great and run even more efficient than my current etoxx helical drives. All hardware is included, including spare bolts and offsets. I will also include the ASA printed guards if you want, they are worn down a bit but still work! Got one worn belt set and one belt set in good condition. Motor pulleys probably need to be replaced soon since they are worn down a bit. You can order them direcly from trampa.

**Price: 150 euros, buyer pays shipping**

Im located in The Netherlands, can ship internationally.
