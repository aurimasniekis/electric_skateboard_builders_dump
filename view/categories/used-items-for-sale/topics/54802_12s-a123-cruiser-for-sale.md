what kind of range do you get with it?

sorry if this is a dumb question but is it less than 99w?

That seems like a great deal.  Out of curiosity, why are you selling?

I think itâ€™s exactly 99wh. You will get very little sag from these cells. Nice looking deck too.

Never saw a build with LiFePo4 batteries. How much range do you get? How different is it to LiPo or Li-On

itâ€™s a lot safer (, and can discharge a lot even in a 1p pack. range is a bit under 10 miles riding normally with few hills

Oh that's a little expensive for 10 miles. But it is 12s and I don't know anything about that so im probably talking shite(talking about how much you payed for the battery not the price of what your selling your board)

Hey if for some reason one of you wants to buy $300 worth of parts from this board and doesn't want the carvon bits, let Greco know so that I can grab em (I know I'm greedy, but the hub motor would be a gift for a friend - I swear I'm not *that* much of an ass)
