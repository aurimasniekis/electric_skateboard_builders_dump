**Enertion nano X remote**
I have never realy used this remote (only have pealed of the stickers on it). The joystick is a bit rotated to clockwise and that can result in sliding with more resistance. It is fixable by yourself and on the end of this topic there is a link to a video that can help :wink:

**About the flier dual ESC:**
This is an 8s 200a esc for a dual setup and works great and has a **built in antispark**. The esc has been repaired by flier themselfs so it is a fresh esc. It is also programmable! you can **program** functions just like the vesc (but then a bit more basic) with a special USB stick. I have lost the usb stick unfortunately but you can buy one for cheap from here for instance (I am still looking for mine tho):

The first person that buys two things or more will get a free enertion whistle (the wasp) :slight_smile:

Thanks. No good for me since they have the flat spot and I don’t want to modify my axles.

Okay last bump I think

Who wants a whole set of 8s electronics for only €90 + shipping? **It includes a 8s bms, charger and dual ESC which is programmable** very nice! :slight_smile:
