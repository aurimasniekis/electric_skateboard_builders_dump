You can put new schrink wrap on and it will look like new.

UR18650SA not very well known cells from Sanyo, rated for 1250mah 18a, perfect for budget build, got 33 pcs- 60 euro for all of them

No prices are listed, so how would we know if they're wrong?

I don’t know if you price are wrong but if you ask for propositions, I would take the focbox if the price includes shipping. But as you know shipping cost to me is a bitch so I’d understand if you say no.

Just a lil' post of appreciation to all of this community, you guys hammer home the mantra of wearing helmets and that saved me today. I dished out the money for a nice full face lifer because of y'all, and after hitting a pot hole going about 32 down hill I went flying and smashed my head on the ground at mach speed. The sound it made was terrifying but i'm not dead because of that mantra. Only damage to my body was my hands and forearm, but other than that I walked away from what would've killed me. Not sure exactly what the point of this post is other than to express my gratitude and thanks to all of you. Thank you, and be safe.

Wow! Glad you’re okay and glad you had the helmet on. You might have to replace the helmet, afaik helmets are good for hard impact. Stay safe man!
