I'm looking for this specific motor, new or used, because I really need this one because it is best compatible with the setup we want to use. The sk3 that was used before broke because of a small rock that hit the winding :frowning:

No we have what we want, and without you we would've probably missed the sk3 so a huge thank you man!
