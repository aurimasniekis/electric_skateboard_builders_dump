If you are interested in selling only the bms I'm willing to take it off your hands; the original battery pack not being a good one even when new.

I went for a quick look on this forum; you can get a Bestech 80A for around 50 USD shipped; Usual price range is between 30 and 60 with the DieBieMS being the priciest at 120USD shipped but it is no normal BMS.

Evolve is a bit harder to get hands on so I'm willing to buy it at 50 without shipping. What do you think ?

By the way I've tried to sell my own battery pack in France and it just ended in scraps; I suggest that you don't expect much from yours or you will likely be disappointed, their lifepo4 setup just being to much of a hassle (mostly due to its sag).

I actually pmed the guy to apologize about the lowball, I've asked the last guy that sold one about the price and kind of realize my own stupidity.
Also I've decided to import mine from europe as it was a pain to source anyway
