Hello E-skate community, with a bitter sweet feelings I have to sell all the extras that I bought for eskate.

Let me know what you want I live in southern California and can deliver or ship anywhere.

6 - series adapters with xt60 free if you buy something else
2 - vesc ollin board w/heatsinks and can-bus - 378
2 - 6355 motors 80/ea

Will sell everything for 1200 obo

Let me know what you think

I will be taking whatever set I don't sell to Sweden to finish my build there.  

Nothing is used except the trucks and wheels that got a few hundred yards of bombing the hill outside my house.

Thanks for all the help and inspiration I got from this forum life just got in the way of my first build but I'm looking forward to continuing this adventure in a new place.

Haha well I bought 4 of everything and I kinda need the money so this is all the extras I dont need to complete a whole board or two if I make each with a single motor.  I went a little overboard

You are most welcome to Sweden. 
Why not build a board fully working and sell it here in sweden? You could get more then you gave for it. Everything is expensive here.
