I'm selling some used parts, because I switched from a street longboard to a mountainboard.

* **Wheels**

   * Bigfoot Wheels 83mm 78A - **25 €**
 Good condition, barely used. Only the printed label worned a litte bit. Including a 32T HTD5 Pulley + screws for 9mm belts. For use with standard skate-bearings.

 * Powerslide Roadwarrior 5x1 Pneumatics - **20 €** **[SOLD]**
A set of 4. Good Condiiton, only about 30km ride with them. Unfortunately one wheel bursted due to too high pressure, caused by myself. I dont have a spare tire, but you can simply use skike tires to replace that one. Comes with 3d printed 50T HTD5 Pulley for 12mm belts. For use with standard skate-bearings.

 * Noname Full Rubber wheels 5x1 - **10 €** **[Reserved]**
These are in a ood condition too. I barely used them because they have a high rolling resitance compared to urethane wheels. But lowGuido said that they are getting better the more they worn out. Couldn't  get so far. Comes with an 3d printed adapter to mount pulleys on.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/9/d945edb4392757c1d81aa3819eba8010b92180c4.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

 * Next 9" Mountainboard Wheels + 12mm Trucks - **40 €** **[Reserved]**
Got them from a friend, but even he rarely used them. I dont need them, cause they are too big for my setup. Bearings are slightly rusty.
Maybe there is a guy out there who wants to build a monster :slight_smile:

Hello @bullrider12 I am just curious as to how do you mount the pulleys to the shaft? do they have grub screws between the teeth? I am asking because I need to modify mine and I am not sure if there is enough mass for the grub screw to sit in under the belt.

@tux-scooby
I need to calculate the price and get a nice package. Please be patient with me :slight_smile: 

@Martinsp 
Im glueing all of my pulleys with Loctite 648. It's a rock solid method to mount the pulleys on the shaft :slight_smile:  

@akira 
you can pay me per paypal. PM me :slight_smile:
