Iâ€™m officially quitting eSkate since I have ridden much lately. 

I have a Kaly XL carver that has a 600+ WH battery using Sanyo batteries. Itâ€™s the best board heâ€™s built but doesnâ€™t have direct drive. Itâ€™s belt driven. No cosmetic wear and about 200 miles total if that. About 6 months old $2300 or best offer 


Evolve bamboo gt with a LHB battery. Yellow MBS wheels and like new condition. Has both the original and R2 remote. Will also include street conversion kit with orhinal
83mm wheels and 97aabec flywheels the $120 ones 

Selling this for $1800![image|666x500](upload://l3aLzovSZXPN9qKumdkNNMpHROa.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://5Gd5LQALlYGWf77g7Qt0Hn81wiM.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://pAUGygCRwwuoyFovhrN39aCGAwc.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://6ZN9Wa9qihcrF7Fg93AdpadZOkw.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://mHhTrOMnLePZhCliG64oiUBf1Iy.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://6MNSXltg2X2nmtuxhfUi9Uhe3He.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://3bnP483r6QWx2X5nCSzkmNEkc3D.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://r5IXY1LW4BzTin4lG4l3p17MlBL.jpeg)

The Kaly board doesnâ€™t have a single scratch on it. Comes with the big ass 8amp charger as well. 

Must pay shipping AS WELL

You lucky bastard.

Iâ€™d buy it if it were local. Iâ€™d be in even more debt but just think of the credit. Such a nice build.

I think the problem you might run into is everyone want to get a brand new kaly 2.0 with gear drives, more range, power, and a better looking board for only a few hundred bucks more.

Wish you the best on the sale though!
