Have a nice adjustable PSU module to sell. You need a AC-DC power supply for the input and you can hook it up to charge anything up to 5A with your desired termination voltage.

Input voltage: 6-55V                                
Output voltage: 0-50V
Output current: 0-5A                                                
Input voltage should be at least 1.1 times greater than desired maximum voltage (for example, if you want 0-30V output, use at least 33V input)
Price: 20â‚¬ + shipping

Can the input voltage be higher than 1.1? Can i buy like a 12s brick charger and use this to charge a 10s battery?

Yes of course. I will make that clear in the first post. It is actually very efficient step-down module.
