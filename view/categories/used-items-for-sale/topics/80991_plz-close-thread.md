I found that I like building moreso than riding, however this is a beast, I had a coworker with a raptor 2 and the power is quite similar, this board in particular is like the raptor 2 without overheating issues and better urethane(not to rag on enertion or anything). The ride was definetly one of the smoothest I’ve had on an Esk8 with the urethane. Unfortunately I don’t see myself having the time in the future to ride as much but if anyone wants it you’ll be getting one of the most powerful stealth builds out there, all the components are top of the line and have passed through the airport 10x so far without an issue. The board will be shipping from California and any other questions about the board or specific parts let me know!![image|374x500](upload://qG3WqoDhB5X67Ra0iUTtOQwHFZ4.jpeg)
