Hi, I'm seling these escs. I switched to hubs so they are just laying around. 
They are for brushless motors and not for the hubs. The dual one currently doesn't have an XT60 on it but I'll solder it before I ship it.

The dual motor esc is 50 euros + shipping,
and the single motor vesrion 30 euros + shipping
I'm in Croatia so for people in EU there will NOT be any import taxes etc.

The shipping to ireland is 8 euros. I dont have any motors and it is an esc that is used in boards like riptide etc. It can work on 6S, 7S and 10S, currently it is set up to 10s but I can change it for you if needed.
