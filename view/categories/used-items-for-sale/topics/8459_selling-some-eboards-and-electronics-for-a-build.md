Hey Pablo, you can look up the metroboard web site for all the specs on the board. It is the "stealth" model with upgraded bearings and 20 mile battery. I took the stickers off and added the red trim myself. I believe I paid little over $1400. Iam asking $780 for it, has about 300 miles on it. One of the boards Iam keeping is another metroboard the "micro slim".  Hey lox897 I was thinking maybe $170 for the 2 esc's. They have 4mm female connectors ready for motor wires.

Gt2b remote is $20. The switch is $40. Iv gotten a lot more reply's on selling all the components altogether. So if your interested for $200 I can do the esc's with the switch and programming card, $215 total to add the remote. The lipos are $80 each and I'll throw in the imax charger if both are bought. I'll split all the shipping costs with buyer. Thank you, David

I use my electric to take my kids all around the place. When they were in strollers, I'd push them while riding my board. Now that their older, they can ride along with me on my board. It's a great way to get them to school.

I absolutely love it. It has great power(can tow my buddy uphill on his Acton blink when he runs out of power), range (about 20 miles on full charge), and has amazing build quality. 

Metroboards are soooo underated. I think it's because of the max 20mph speed. It has always been fast enough for me, although I could handle a bit more. But while other boards break, get recalled, or just take forever to ship, I'm riding my metroboard. 

I got an amazing deal on it used, but I would pay full price any day after trying it.

If it uses a mini remote (made me chuckle with it being $1800) you can just MOD it or get a GT2B. The mini remote has limited throttle range, and if you change it out your bound to get about 2 more mph.

I love Metroboard. Ive had 4 different manufactured boards and metro is by far the best built and most reliable. After I sold my stealth I bought the micro slim model. They have a new more responsive remote now and last week Ilan the owner is releasing a new more powerful motor that will get you up to 24mph. He is offering it as a $150 upgrade to existing customers with the older motors.  I have foot bindings on 29 inch micro slim for curb jumping and skate parks. Just hit 1000 miles on it with zero malfunctions. ( knock on wood) Also best customer service around.

I started playing around with a 48v 500watt mototec drift trike which already was getting 22mph with 20 mile range. The stock hub motor burned out so i replaced it with a 1000 watt front hub wheel and switched the lead acid batteries to an ebike lithium battery pack. Now goes nearly 35 mph with little more range.  Its too fast for the stock manufactured frame I believe so Im building another one from a flat-out trike kit. All the neighborhood dads want one now. lol
