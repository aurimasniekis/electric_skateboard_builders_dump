Edit: only have one maytech remote left, sold the other and the mini

I have 3 remote controllers for sale

both the maytech remotes are giving me the same exact problem so I'm assuming its something with my setup..Each maytech remote was also purchase from different people.. while I accelerate sometimes they will lose power briefly.. very strange and can't figure it out

also selling the mini remote, tried it for 20 minutes and just didn't like it

message me so we can negotiate

US only, sorry
