Bought it premade, wasnt made that well so loads solders kept getting undone.

No clue how to put it back together, comes with everything you need works well.
Remote shell is being painted black, but everything as seen on the picture.

Would like 60 Euro or a remote in trade.

Reciever already made and fully working.

Can ship if buyer pays shipping.
