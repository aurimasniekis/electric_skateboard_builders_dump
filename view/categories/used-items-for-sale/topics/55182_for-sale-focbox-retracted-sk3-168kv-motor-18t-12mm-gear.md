Pretty much unused focbox, bought about 2 weeks ago(120$).
Turnigy sk3 168kv motor, used for about 1 month on and off. I believe one of the motor wires was rubbed a little bit and was exposed at one point with my old vesc (rip), so the wire has been completely heat shrinked etc. (50),60 with gear. Has a couple scratches as most motors do. 
18t 12mm gear. 13$
