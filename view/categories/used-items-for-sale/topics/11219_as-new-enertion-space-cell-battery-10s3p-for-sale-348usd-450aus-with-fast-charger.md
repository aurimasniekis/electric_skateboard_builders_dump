I think the price is a little high. You can get the space cell pro with the enclosure and a nano x right now for 350 usd....

Does it come with a fast charger.  Im open to offers for just battery.  Assume old raptor battery still priced correctly.  If anyone raptor owners wanted a spare I have one.  At the end of the day I will only get what someone is willing to pay for it and what Im willing to sell it for.  The cell is practically new. 

Could sell cheaper without fast charger for example.

Hi Dedbny,
would be prepared to pay the 350 USD with both chargers if you can accept to ship to France for the same price.

You do realise it costs $42.00 USD alone for postage not including packaging and associated costs. And thats just for battery as it weighs 1.8kg. Its $330 USD new not including shipping from Enertion.

Need a local buyer anyone.

Hey mate, from Adelaide. What would shipping cost? Would you do a deal for $350? And I would cover postage depending on total price. Cheers

That probably explains it. Thks might need to rethink what to do with it. Probably the only advantage over it is if a Raptor 1 owner needs one. Also comes with a fast charger as apposed to a 2A charger

Dedbny, do you have access to any other batteries with the fast charger? I am located in Melbourne as well and am looking to buy. If not any info on where to get a 10s3p battery for a custom skateboard would be appreciated.

Hi Hayden, only had a raptor 1 and usef charger with that battery with a bms. Would have thought it would charge any similar battery. If your still aftet a fast charger I still have it for sale. Pick up preferred. I work in Richmond, so can do a deal there at lunchtime if that helps otherwise Im located in Moorabbin
