I'm selling a few items. As there are so many, **I currently don't have pictures or prices for them all**. If you'd like to enquire about a specific item, please post below or PM Me. **I am sorry the pictures arent uploaded here, but this is a reddit crosspost**

Evolve Bamboo GT 2016 Street - https://imgur.com/a/eyXVn8o

  - Under 100 battery cycles 
  - New motor controller replaced by evolve recently
  - Light asthetic wear on the trucks. Checked thoroughly for microfractures and couldnt find any
  - 100% Operational with all evolve parts
£660 UK Collection (~45% original cost)

Loaded Fat tail w/ Metal ESC & Battery enclosure, 10S2P Sanyo w/ Dual hub motors and chinese ESC (Recent meepo ESC, I use the 2 speed remote because it gives the board higher torque) https://imgur.com/a/iDipBjT
  - Venom bushings
  - Paris front truck
  - Under 300 Miles
  - Under 75 Battery cycles
  - Rear hub motors replaced less than 50 miles ago. Small rock has been embedded in 1 hub, but this usually wont effect the lifetime of the hub (hasnt done for me in the past)

  - Battery sag is only noticable at 25% battery, probably better than my evolve.
  - Rear tires fairly worn, may need replacing within 300 miles but may go on much longer depending on rider weight
  - The battery casing is quite tall, and can scrape against the ground if ridden off a sharp slope or over speedbumps, it was also chipped by a rock and has been sealed with tape for 300+ miles 
£470

Samsung 30Q 10S2P Battery w/ BMS  (Winboard branded) - https://i.imgur.com/HUbzb8G.jpg

Winboard branded ESC with boosted clone (Exact copy) remote - https://imgur.com/0r5Nuxh

2x diyeboard N5055 270kv Brushless motors. Never used, not even on testbench. Asking 50GBP - https://imgur.com/DQjCTJV

If you were to buy an item from me, especially if its a complete, surely you would like a picture attached to the listing? 

Even if I offered multiple items, you (normally) want to see the item to choose so you dont have to bother the seller asking for information that should have been a given. Now I (you) look silly for wasting your (me) time, and I would want to leave. just like @brenternet  :)

come on, do it right or dont do it at all ;)

Good luck selling your stuff if you can't keep cool head and do some basic... Calling your potential buyers lowballers from start is... Well!

Came here interested to check what you have for sale (you're in UK so good location for EU buyers) and what's for grab ; missed pics and prices, though there is some info, oh well why not ; looked for more insight in the thread ; lost interest after reading the topic. 

Sorry. Have a fair sale.

Edit : Thank you for adding pics.

180 probably, winter did bad things to me ;-;

mine sagged consistantly throughout my use, but would still last about 7/8 miles b4 the sag really grabs hold(then maybe 5 miles of faster than walking speed

(this is at almost  W̶O̶T̶ ) This is when I would just smash the accelerator and dump amps the entire way :) I dont travel slow unless I need to :D

edit how do i get strikethrough text? i had to generate it online and it looks like shit

Probably 2 tildes, ~~strikethrough~~ (~ + ~ + text + ~ + ~) 
Yea, but the advertised range is 9-13 miles so if were both heavy (Im 200lbs) and we both push the board to the max, 7 sagless miles is pretty good.

metasurf hasn't really properly been tested yet. Carvon will die if its like what happened to hub motors a while ago (Everyone stopped paying triple for hummies/maytech, except very very few), As long as metasurf drives are good enough. I personally don't think a 1000% markup on the material costs for carvons is sustainable, despite they're okay, it will be mass manufactured soon.

I had a whole response written up but I came off as a fuck so ill just retry one shot:

I don think that Hummie hubs are dead, or even relatable to maytech hubs at all, besides the fact they operate similarly, as well as theyre both called hub motors :P 

@ professor_shartsis provided great information as to why theyre seperate products, generated for different uses


I agree about mass manufacturing, but I wouldnt buy then. Wait for someone to innovate and redesign, just like hummie did ^^

edit: include statement about chinese products vs domestic and profit margins never being enough to make it more than a low supply, niche consumer product :man_shrugging:

I don't even know where to start with this statement.

Hummie hubs are in huge demand, he can't make them fast enough and there's a plethora of people waiting on his kickstarter to get a set. Maytech hubs are being stocked more and more in stores all over the place. You can get them on 2 day delivery locally worldwide now. I'm pretty sure that's only happening because people buy them. How do you measure "very very few"? Suck on your finger and lift it into the air?

Blanket statements will generally make you look silly when they are based on personal opinion.

Maytech used to mass produce hubs, the ones on sale are old as hell dude. Try and look for any recent complete boards that are successful using those hubs. Where are you even finding them on sale? this isnt based on opinion, its based on the fact I love esk8 and look at everything and i only see them in old webshops etc.

Prices updated. Is the 30Q price not very very low? I'd almost keep it at what im trying to sell it for here.

@Anubis 
I might be interested if you would send me more pictures of the 10S2P 30Q battery...
Also I need to know how does it perform...did you experience any voltage sag? On what setup? 
Does it have BMS (I guess it does)? Switch? Charging port? Discharging port? Any issues? accidents with it? 
How did you use it? 
Where did you buy it from? When? 
How much for shipping to the Czech Repulic?

You can send me a PM, if it is better for you :)

Its a winboard GTm8 mini battery. No it does not sag, and yes it has a 40A BMS (Possibly 50 or 60. I know it can run 2 motors at 20A) Yes it has a charging port and XT60 "discharging port".

Sanyo and 30Q cells have very minimal sag. Of course if you're running it to like 10% they will sag, but when someone asks "Does it sag" they don't usually mean does it sag at 5%

my 12S4P of 30Q sags at full voltage, its nothing wrong with it, It just has to do with how much load you put on it. Sure, if I ran a one motor setup with smaller wheels, the sag would probably be minimal. But yeah, you get my point.

What? No, voltage sag doesnt mean it drops below 3.7V. Voltage drops as part of ohms and kirchoffs law. You want current, youll get voltage sag. End of story.

I run dual pneus of etoxx drive. Start torque gives sag untill current draw flattens out.

My bad. Can you even tell its sagging at that point though? Like when people talk about voltage sag they aren't referring to the physics of it just what is experienced

Well, theres always an expected ballpark number, but if your voltage skydives and dont recover that well, id be alot more worried.

I am probably going to list these on Ebay. My account says "Cannot list more than £0" which is unhelpful but when I figure it out they will not be on here. 

I have put the evolve to £360 just so see how low people here won't even ask about it and it got no responses in 2 days, so I am probably not going to sell any completes on here.

They come with pulleys and belts, asking £50. I am likely going to put the batteries into builds and sell as completes on ebay, because people here apparently don't use 2P in builds too much. I may have 1 spare afterwards though so let me  know if you're interested soonish

Ah crap, the evolve has sold. Sorry, the shipping would have been $130+++ USD and trouble with batteries. Best bet for you is probably to actually make a battery locally if they're hard to find. Best of luck!

Np. what's the total weight of your evo setup? I can do even ship freight as shipping, because ill be going home still in april, so 2 months more. Current work is on sea and at will be on houston on the following days . How's that setup with the evo? With china completes, I will still do shipping so might try yours. And also I can pay only by western union.
