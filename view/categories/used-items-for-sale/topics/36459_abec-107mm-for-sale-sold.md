So I just got Evolve 107’s and took them for a spin. It’s just a little to much wheel for me. I don’t have a 38T so I’m going to just accept the loss on this one. Wheels have less than a mile.

$145, save $15 and shipping will be $13 flat rate USPS box so you’ll get them shipped for cheaper than buying them from evolve.
