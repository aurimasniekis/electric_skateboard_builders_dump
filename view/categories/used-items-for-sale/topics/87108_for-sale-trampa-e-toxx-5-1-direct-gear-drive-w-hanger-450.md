I bought this drive here and unfortunately life has gotten in the way of finishing (or really starting) my build. Below is the original description from the user I bought it from, the drive has been untouched since I bought it. I'm asking $450 + shipping.

For sale here is a E-Toxx 5:1 ‚Äúdirect‚Äù (gear) drive with its original CNCed hanger by @Nowind. The 8mm motor spurs and wheel gears are unused, meaning there is 0 miles on them because I brought a brand new set of wheel gears few weeks ago from @Nowind but never replace them. The 8mm motor spur gears was also unused because I was using the 10mm spur gears for my 8085 motors. Regardless, my loss, your gain. So in a sense, you‚Äôre practically getting a ‚Äúnew‚Äù drive system.

As a bonus, i‚Äôm also including a set of 80xx mm adaptors and 10mm bore spur gears if you ever want to upgrade to a bigger motor from 63xxmm motors. All the smaller parts, such as kingpin bushing, nuts, washers and etc, I‚Äôve replaced. Whatever I can‚Äôt replace, i‚Äôve already wash and rinsed twice.

Please DM for offer.

Unfortunately if I purchased them separately, I'd have an extra pair of regular gears, I doubt I'd be able to sell them üòÇ

No but you would be able to design your own gear drive or sell them to someone doing so
