Are the hub motors a full set, or just the motor unit?

They are just the hubs but they come with bolts to mount them on the trucks of your choice.

It seems as the hub motor does not have the two new grub screws for alignment. Could you post a more detailed picture about the hub motors?

Yes of course <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/b/2b01d74bd2e30f0369d3be8962df780c054d84e8.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/5/254b13552f113fc3816f88349e96ffe42962767e.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/6/e656a85ae184f8fd34d042f50371fb03f1ca419c.jpg" width="375" height="500">

I meant the side where the cables come out of the stator.

I think the next buyer will have the problem to mount these motors to a truck.

You are unfortune... you are missing the holes for the alignment pins:

Actually as you see here there are alignment screws.

The problem is that the aligment screw is not strong enough for so much power which the motor is capable of!
So the buyer has to modify the motors.

that is not an alignment but a grub screw.

I got it from a friend who builds electric bikes. He bought it and realized it was the wrong shape for his bike. I'm not sure where he got it I will ask him.
