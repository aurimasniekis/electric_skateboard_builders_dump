The motor is the sensored 6374 stealth motor from the group buy here on this forum, so I don't know the specfic brand but its a really nice motor windings look really clean and neat.  the lipo are 3 4s zippys and the charger is a really nice one I don't have it in here with me but it's not a cheap one. i probably spent 100 on it from a local hobby store.
