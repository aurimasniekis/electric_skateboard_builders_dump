Hi guys, I'm selling off my old build that I made about a year ago. I gave up on it, but the parts are still good! I would preferably like to get this off my hands all at once at a big discount, but if there isn't any interest I'm willing to scrap it off. Currently the battery LED indicator got cracked and the on/off switch broke. I spent over $1000 building this but am willing to part with it for $400 or obo. I just want to the least hassle so whatever you are buying YMMV. I have not touched this in a while. If you are buying this, DO NOT EXPECT A WORKING BOARD! I am not responsible for whatever troubles you run into, which is why it is so cheap, I don't want to deal with the hassle anymore. Here are the specs 
-SK-6374 motor with included drive train
-FOCBOX controller
-10s3p Samsung 25r 18650 battery pack with BMS
-Generic deck and wheels
-Controller included
Here is a parts list, pm if interested in parts or full build
