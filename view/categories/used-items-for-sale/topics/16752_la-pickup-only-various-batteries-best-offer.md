Pickup only, **don't PM me unless you basically live in LA.** These were all free but more than one person is interested so pm me an offer




All have low cycles (<10) and have been used briefly with various prototypes. Not pretty to look at but with the right home these will be as good as new. Age varies from 1-3 years but honestly not going to impact capacity more than 2% per year as stored predominantly at 50%SOC. All will come with 2-4 spare new cells so you can do whatever you want.. since they are barely used with low cycles, it doesn't hurt to add a cell to the string as long as you **balance for every charge**.

6S5P VTC4 pack $60

 At one point this was two packs. Actually out of balance between 3.3-3.45V. The seventh cell is dead and will be taken off before I give it to you.

yep. Pls be safe with these old guys and throw them away properly!
ItÂ´s nice for some guys to get cheap batteries, but in this case just get rid of them :+1:

can you rephrase your post so it doesn't jeopardize my sale.. these cells are fine for $60 other than that one cell and this is  a bargain. I won't have the bad cell included with the sale. The others are fine.
