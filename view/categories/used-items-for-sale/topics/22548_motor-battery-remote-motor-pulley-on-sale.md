Hey @aigenic! , I got the 195kv version of this Keda, one question, how did you mount it? I have a turnigy motor mount, but the little black locking thing in the root of the shaft is blocking a bit. Did you have this problem?

Try putting a washer between the mount and the motor or make the hole bigger.

I had custom mount :/ but as far as I remmebmer it was also a problem...but i didnt solve it anyway :) If i remember correctly the black clip can move loosely, so it should be such a problem...but putting washers betwwen the mount and motor is a good idea :)

Yeah its moving but creating some unnecessary friction, I'll try with washers or filing the black click smaller! Thanks!
