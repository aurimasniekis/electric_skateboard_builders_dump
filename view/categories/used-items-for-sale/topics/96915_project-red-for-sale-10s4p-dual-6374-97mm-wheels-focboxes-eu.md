What range do you get on that battery? Also maybe some recommendations on what you would like to change or is worth changing? I'm going for the same build almost and main goal is torque with pretty nice range.

Depends alot on the riding conditions and how hard you are on the trigger.
But around 30-40km on a charge.

Torque is crazy with those 6474 in dual.

I dont really have anything that i wish to change or improve to be honest.
Only reason for selling is that i need space for new toys :sweat_smile:
