Hi guys ‘n gals! Since I’m upgrading/refurbishing my boards I have some used parts up for grabs. Take a look :smiley:

Used Orangatang Kegels (used for a lot of kilometers) – <b>28€</b>
I would say they are in a pretty good condition, considering the amount of kilometers they’ve been through. Measured the diameter, and at the worst they are about 79,3 millimeters out of the original 80.

3D printed but surprisingly sturdy enclosure – **15€**
Re-painted but has a few scratches. Cutouts for XT90, VGA and a on/off button. Also two cutouts in the back, one for phase wires and one for power to LED strips. Rubber gasket included.

I will probably have more parts here soon. 
Let me know if you're interested, and I will send more pics and measurements.
**LOCATED IN DENMARK/EU – YOU PAY SHIPPING**

Yes, but unless you're from Denmark I don't think it will make sense with the enormous shipping cost...
