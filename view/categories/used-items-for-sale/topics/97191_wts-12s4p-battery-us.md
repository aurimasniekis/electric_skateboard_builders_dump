Im selling my 12s4p torque boards battery. I've had it for about a year and I am in Texas/ Dallas. Only thing a changed on it was the charge port and the charger to xt"90 connectors. But everything else is the same as I bought it. The charger and the torque boards case is for sale also pictures tonight.
