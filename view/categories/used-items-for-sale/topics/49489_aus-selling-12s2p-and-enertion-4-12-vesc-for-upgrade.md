Hey everyone,

I am planning to upgrade to a 12S4P to increase my range and decrease sag. Also plan to run FOC so I am going to upgrade to a FOCBOX.

I am selling my DIYes 12S2P 30Q battery pack with it's enclosure for $300 AUD (SOLD), and my 4.12 Enertion VESC for $90 AUD. I am open to any questions and offers although won't budge too much on the prices.

Only selling within Australia. Thanks :slight_smile:
