Hey all, 

I took advantage of the tsg group buy (here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/tsg-group-buy-completed/54231) and I'm selling my pads **(size large)** for what I paid for them.   I put them on 1 time and they are too small (arms and legs) so I'm selling the whole set.

I'll lose money on this, but don't need them and know someone else can use them.

They are brand new, that's why I didn't post pictures.  They look like the picture in the group buy above.!

Updated op.
