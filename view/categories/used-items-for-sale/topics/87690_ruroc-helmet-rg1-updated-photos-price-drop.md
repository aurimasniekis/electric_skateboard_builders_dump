Selling a lightly used Ruroc Rg1-DX size M/L. 
Includes a new orange lens insert, goggle and helmet bag. 
Gave it a good once over and could only find a very light scuff on the back. Tried to get a good picture but itâ€™s pretty minor.
$160 shipped in the US, international would need to cover the difference in shipping cost.

Hey maybe try taking some new pictures . with a solid back drop . its hard to see details . with all of the distorted reflections. Mayne better lighting. Its just a suggested best of luck.
