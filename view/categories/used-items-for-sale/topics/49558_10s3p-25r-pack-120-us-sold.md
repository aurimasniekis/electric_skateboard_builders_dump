itâ€™s got less than 50 miles on it, originally from an @JLabs GB a year or so ago 

i suspect it has a dead cell in the first p group. the voltages are as follows

The money for my board came from a part time coaching job I had for a year and a half. The money for the 3d printer came from the leftovers of what I was willing to spend, but mostly money you get from your entire extended family for chinese new year :slight_smile:

Edit: The pass came from my parents, they thought they would atleast contribute to my safety and well being LOL

Damn. Just got back here. Dead group = me not wanting it because I'm too dumb to fix it myself.

That's weird that the forum said I was here when I wasn't though. Hmmm...
