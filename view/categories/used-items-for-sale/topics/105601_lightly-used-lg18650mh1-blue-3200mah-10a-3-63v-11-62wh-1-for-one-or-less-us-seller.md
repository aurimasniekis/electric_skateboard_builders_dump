LG18650MH1 18650 cell,3200mAh 10A 3.63V 11.62Wh GENUINE CELLS



These cells are in excellent condition, testing at 95% (or higher) of the manufacturers rated capacity.  

Please take note, these cells were extracted from brand new battery packs, so they have spot weld marks and leftover nickel from the welds on the positive and negative terminals (see pics). This does not affect the cell's performance in any way, you could spot weld or solder over them or remove very easily. 

You are getting brand new quality & capacity, for the price of "used" cells which would normally have noticeably decreased capacity.

Most of our cells still test over their rated capacity, though to be on the safe side, we say 95% or higher. 

Besides the spot weld marks, they are otherwise "new" in performance and quality

Rest Assured, Always 100% Authentic, GUARANTEED!
