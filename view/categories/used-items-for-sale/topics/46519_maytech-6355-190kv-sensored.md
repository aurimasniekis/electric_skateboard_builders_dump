Hi!:slightly_smiling_face:
I am currently building my first board, a Trampa street cruiser. I bought 2 of these 6355 Maytech motors. Meanwhile I figured to get some bigger ones (because there is enough space).

I mounted the motors a few days ago, just for test fitting my motor mounts. They were never powering the board, since I am still building it. So they are perfectly new.

I am asking for 95$ each plus shipping worldwide. Payment via paypal.

You can find all the info over at maytech:
