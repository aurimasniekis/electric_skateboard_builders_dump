I hate the goddamn post office so much. If you were short a crucial part, I‚Äôd hook you up, but I cannot go in that building. Drive out to SD... or better yet, live in a southern state for me and a well known esk8 vendors ‚Äúesk8 across the states‚Äù RV adventure next spring ü§ô

It‚Äôs alrigth dude, I am not in the US and although I would love to, I cannot drive to San Diego ü§£. You probably  thought I was the op who‚Äôs from Mexico I think. 
Anyways, just looking around for MTB parts and I am not in a hurry to build one but I‚Äôd love to.

When that happens, I would be interested to know what will remain and how reasonably low we are talking about. Unless there is really no way you‚Äôd step into the post office to ship it abroad, which is cool too, not going to push.

Quite interested in this one. We can discuss later about the price. I assume its the reverse motor mount? Whats your price of shipping to the Netherlands.
