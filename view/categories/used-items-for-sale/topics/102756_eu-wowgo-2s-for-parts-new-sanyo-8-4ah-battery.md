Hi guys, I've got a used wowgo 2s for parts. The board turns on, pairs with the remote, but it won't accelerate. I suppose the ESC is dead. 
The original battery has been upgraded to a Sanyo 8Ah from wowgo and only has ~20 cycles on it. 
Sadly the esc died shortly after the battery was changed.
I upgraded the bushings, the rest is stock.

The deck, wheels and motors have ~1200km on them. Pictures attached.

It was my first esk8 and it's been a great boar. I loved every single km on it but I need to cut the expenses and get some money back to furnish my newly acquired apartment. Instead of paying 50€ for a new ESC I hope to get 200€ from it (which is the cost of the battery alone).

PU in pretty good shape after 1200km

Can you get all up in that ESC and see what failed? Is there a blown component, or did it squeak out and die?

No, but iirc you can technically buy replacement urethane anyway. But its rather uneconomical, only $10 less than just getting a new hub

i prefer paying less for shipping and buying without deck and hubs

No they're the first editions. But you can get at least what I got from them I'd say given their condition atm.
