Hey guys,

Like the title says, I have my Raptor 2 that unfortunately I hate the fact but I have to sell due to employment opportunities not allowing me the extra time anymore.

This has the New Silver Motors installed, Firmware updated and controller re-calibrated. This also has the new formula 90mm wheels installed ever so slightly used.

I received this board in June part of the 124** batch and has been used for short hops. The silver motors were just put on and have recently been tested and configured (11/2) so are good to go out of the box! This will also transfer my warranty which is for 2 years and is good till June 2020.

*Raptor will come with a brand new nano-x NIB wich is calibrated and 2 perfectly working extras, as well as a spare set of 90mm back, and brand new 97mm fronts.

Asking for $1500 includes PP fees + shipping within the CONUS or 1400 Cash Pickup in the Metro NY / LI area.

Please see pics below and let me know if you have any questions.
