Hello, selling my Kaly.nyc with Evolve nubby tires. I am located in Northern California, and would like local sale only. Bay area would be perfect. I will also be in So Cal this week.

I took a fall on the board a little while back and got scratched up. When that happened, the back right motor got banged up a little and something sounds a little loose, but it still rides good and launches fast. It should be an easy fix, but I have another still. 'll include a medium red TSG Pass as well and Free Board bindings and maybe a few extras.

I can take more pics if requested, thank you

Edit: Selling for $2000

There is no visible damage to any motors, it's an inside thing but still rides amazing

At first I thought you are selling the domain. You might want to change the title a little to reflect what you are actually trying to sell.

As I posted in another Kaly board up for sale...

"Ernesto charges like $2,700 for his Trampa build. What would be a reasonable price? Keep in mind that this forum is full of people that could build this"

Post a price, update with picture of the mentioned dinged up motor/mount (and rough mileage)

Probably a loose or broken magnet or busted bearing?
