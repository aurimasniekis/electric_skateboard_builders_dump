Was there an older version of Freebord decks?  Im interested in the deck if there was.  It doesn't look anything like what they sell now.

That I can see,   

You got me all excited :slight_smile:.  I love the Freebord concave, but the deck shape is just frikkin uncomfortably weird and limits enclosure size.
