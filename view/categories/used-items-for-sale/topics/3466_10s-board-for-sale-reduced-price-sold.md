Im selling this board to fund a mountain board build.

-random deck off ebay that i cut down to what I wanted. maple ply. very stiff. drop through. 
-custom stain and grip design
-213kv sk3
-TB 12s ESC
-83 mm blue abec wheels
-40:14 drive ratio  (shit ton of torque cuz im heavy) (also have a 18T if you want) 
-volt meter
-very cleanly done GT2B badwolf mod
-custom thick aluminum welded rear facing mount
-9mm belt (works fine and im at 220 lbs) 
-breaker on/off switch
-hanging battery with rusty ass steel plate (never painted it) 
-10s 10 amp hour lipo battery 10c.  they're redone multistar batteries. 

Battery is sold.  400 bucks for the rest of the board plus shipping. Which is usually around 20 bucks. 

This was always my secondary board so naturally doesnt have very many miles on it.  mostly likely much under 80 miles. its dirty because of life. works 100% fine put my word on it. its got about a 27 mile range max speed of like 25 ish. under current gearing ratio. thats with a 220 lb rider.  Carves very well.  I dont have to sell the battery if you dont have a 10s charger, its one single battery and i know most people dont have a 10s capable charger.  

Asking whatever i can get for it lol. 
Yes im willing to part it out if their is enough interest in enough parts.
