Hey guys,
just selling some parts that I got from a used meepo v2 I bought for the battery. 
The seller rode it for ~100km so parts are barely used.

Post office online service says 20€ shipping. I have an offer for the whole bundle though. If it goes through I won't be splitting the parts.

Hey US buds,
here's my post office quotes:

I didn't weight the items yet but I suppose this is around 3-4kg.
Not really interesting to ship to US. Maybe you have another parcel service which would provide cheaper quotes to suggest.

Edit: tried UPS they offer a very reasonable quote of 450€ but it's extra fast lmao

That's not too bad.  That does include the delivery truck itself, right?

They did mention a "Happy ending". Apparently something related with the truck driver. But I0m french and I don't understand english so fuck do I know what it means. 
Sorry for the strong language in France we use those words as ponctuation ^^
