Mike, @KaramQ's is arguably 2019 best Esk8 treasure find. It all happened two weeks ago in SoCal. A ton of complete Altered boards with their motors, trucks, pulleys, batteries, remotes, and the cherries on the cake... 28 'unobtainium' ABEC 11 107mm Electric Flywheels!! thats about 7 complete 107mm sets of all colors from these highly regarded wheels. A find like no other.

That Landwheel is gonna chunk like crazy! get that fixed ASAP.

You need to round out the edge with a large file or emery cloth. Wear thick gloves doing it.

Check out this video, He's a talker but informative:
