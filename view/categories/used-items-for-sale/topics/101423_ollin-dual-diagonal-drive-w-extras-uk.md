Ollin Dual Diagonal drive with Ronin trucks powder coated in purple. Come with two 200kv APS motors, 4x ollin popoca wheels and spare belts etc. Less than 100 miles on them. The rear base plate is angled at 25 degrees so more stable at speed. These are sold out at the moment so no silly offers. 
EU shipping only. Â£450 plus postage ![image|375x500](upload://re8OEV8fcafPmOSBtCkxOWWhc4d.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://i54ryZu9VCNxzWCh6KSgoEEYI3U.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://ccrKp439b0wwGdKODt5WZIlXwod.jpeg)

Theyâ€™ve been sitting around since Xmas and not getting used. Originally they were for the Ollin recurve deck but who knows when thatâ€™s going to materialise so Iâ€™ve gotta let them go.
