Selling battery packs, all 3 packs have a BMS i guess? There's a pcb with Mosfets and Resistors with the batteries.
Cells are LG 3500 mAh, 10A
Big green one (2x16s2p = 16s4p) 400€
Blue ones (16s2p) each 200€

Hey, I may be interested, what's the history of these batteries, how's the life on them, I hate to say it but I need a 10s3p battery pack and that 16s2p looks like a good contender ;) let me get this correct, a 10s3p pack with 3500mah cells will be a 10s3p 10500mah battery pack? (3500*3=10500)

Hi @SpeedyGornzallez
sent you a pm.
Yea, the 10s3p pack will have 10,5 Ah. 
Just keep in mind that the cells have a discharge rate of 10A so 3p could result in lower performance (depends on the rest of your build ofc), also mentioned this in the pm.
