I bought the VESC-X for a project where i have no time now to complete it.

It was only once set up with an Alien 6355 (selling it too).
It just ran the motor calibration on 6S.
The motor leads have XT150 connectors solderes to them.

I will add pictures shortly.

Selling from Germany.
Shipping international for 14€ (9€ without insurance)
National for 5€
PayPal preferred
