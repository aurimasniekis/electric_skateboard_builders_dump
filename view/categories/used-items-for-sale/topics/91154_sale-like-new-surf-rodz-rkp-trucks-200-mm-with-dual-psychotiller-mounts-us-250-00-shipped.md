![image|375x500](upload://I0QkbamLrL83ND35GsFaVfaoiy.jpeg)  These trucks and mounts have been ridden once and not far. Due to the unexpected loss of my job I need to sell. ![image|375x500](upload://zCBxK1U5I90Fpzfh2w3CM9UB47m.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://cd4nTv3hgLOoEXrdNK2yumJVBko.jpeg) If you can’t see the pictures I can email them to you. Forgot to add that picture hope that doesn’t screw up the sale.   Asking $250 plus shipping.
