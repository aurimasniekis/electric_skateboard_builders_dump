oh Acido you bad, bad man, I've asked for them already above to go on the 3dservisas ATB drive I bought.

I think my 9" wheels are going to need belts instead.

@Kug3lis want some hypas in a partial swap (with $$$ of course)to get new POM wheel drives made then proto on this build and sell with it? Then hypa can be added as an option

There is person interesting to buy everything apart wheels/trucks/gear drive. As gear drive/trucks can't be separated as hanger was machined for gear drive will there be someone interested in gear drive with mini trampa spring trucks?

I know @banjaxxed wants wheels..
