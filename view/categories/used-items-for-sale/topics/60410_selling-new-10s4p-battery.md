Hi guys

I made this battery last fall. I never used it. Now its just collecting dust. 
Its a **10s4p** with **LG 18650HE2** cells. 
There is installed a **BMS** for charging. As you can see on the pictures there is also installed a battery indicato, charging port and **XT60** connector. 

You can buy the battery for only **215EUR.** 

Some of you might know, that I am running the webshop; pwrboards.com. 
This battery will be sold as a private transaction. Just so we are clear about that. 

If you are interested in another battery though, please take a look at my webshop.![DSC00602|690x460](upload://hfFZU5ciPxLqi7XOjTBFEltoFGk.JPG)![DSC00604|690x460](upload://9fdfqQeoUotKRTZVQxMTdZbHcya.JPG)![DSC00603|690x460](upload://2hYgnETrGxOENY1vkPyskD8IBnU.JPG)![DSC00605|690x460](upload://15d41Ckrv8XYQ7JdNfxmOUaCSFB.JPG)![DSC00606|690x460](upload://qmcrMthYryAijHAf41LF5OQLr9G.JPG)![DSC00607|690x460](upload://rpEhXKxREFeuG5mq03cEVBMYo5q.JPG)
