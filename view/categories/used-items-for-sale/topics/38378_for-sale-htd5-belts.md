Anybody here in the market for some HTD5 15mm wide belts? I'm migrating to the 12mm system and am looking to shed some of my excess eSk8 parts.

Here's what I've got:

2x New 53T (265mm)
1x New 57T (285mm)
2x Used 53T (265mm)

The used belts probably have around 350 miles on them. They were used on a 1600w dual drive setup (800w per motor), so they saw relatively low stress in operation. They have no major cracks or tears, and no pebbles or sand pressed into them.

Asking prices:

New Belt - $8 ea.
Used Belt - $5 ea.

Add $2 for shipping in US
