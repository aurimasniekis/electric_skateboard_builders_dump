Hi there,

I'm selling my Nano-X remote for 30â‚¬. I just got it from @Bor.inc (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-prices-reduced-end-of-year-garage-sale-vesc-8s-electronics-remote-etc/79392/5) and its in good condition. Its a little bit tight and off so sometimes it doesn't recenter fast. This was not my problem with it, I know It might not help my sale but WTF!? This remote is so annoying, you always have to recalibrate every time you switch it on, sometimes it doesn't even work and apart of that its too small for my hand. I just got my Flipsky Nano so who wants it?
