Have a bunch of things I no longer need, most are brand new.

Located in Tampa, FL if you want to pick up otherwise shipping is included in the prices of everything but the Comp95 Board.


**$200 + shipping –**
MBS Comp 95 Board – great shape but I have too many. Will come with MBS Velcro Bindings but the orange gears/pulleys are not included. (see below, selling some)

Enertion Nano-X Remote – like new, used it for one ride while I was waiting on my flipsky. Looks and performs as new and includes everything.

**...SOLD...** Broken FOCBox Unity – since I am clearly not going to get my paid replacement from Enertion so theres no sense in keeping this. Not sure if anyone is able to fix them but figured it’s worth something. Has Bluetooth module that can be easily used on other setups so make me an offer!

These are fully adjustable universal steering dampers (steering stabilizers) for motorcycles. I bought these with the intent of putting them on one of my road boards for speed but after my first crash I decided there was no need to go 60 on a mountainboard. They are both brand new.

72T Wheel Gears for MBS Wheels (hubs) with 6/32 inserts. The orange ones were used for a test run around the neighborhood but the others are new. Design and print these and use them on all my boards, currently have over 200 miles on one set with zero signs of wear.
PS: you can get a number of different bolts or screws at any hardware store to use on these depending on what wheel you are using.

MBS hubs - basically all of them you'll just need the right length bolt depending on which hub you're using.
