maytech 6355 motor if thats needed

Diy electric has them.  Or you could grind up a stainless screw or metal rod from the hardware store

I had to file mine from DIY electric.  They almost fit.

Cutting that with a butter knife is a minute lol
is it worth waiting a keyway if you can get it in an hour
