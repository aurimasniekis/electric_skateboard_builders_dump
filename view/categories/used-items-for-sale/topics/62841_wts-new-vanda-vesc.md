Ordered this back in Feb for a DIY build, used once or twice for bench testing a motor and battery but never ridden. My technical ability isn't sufficient for a DIY so I'm giving up and buying a production board, and my overconfidence in my ability can be your gain! This VESC has been sitting in it's plastic wrapping in the original box, practically new. Originally $140, asking $100 + shipping. Based in NYC
