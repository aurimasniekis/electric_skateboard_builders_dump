I have a couple of questions: How is the skateboard rangewise and how long does it take to charge? And where could I try it and maybe pick it up?

Yeah but I kinda wanna try it first before I buy it. Maybe you can send it after I pay and then I can try it and then I can decide if I send it back or keep it.

Shipping in Netherlands cost 12€. The board is working 100%, took it yesterday for a last cruise and everything is fine. 

For programming the esc check this video: [12s ESC tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvljCjOZLUc)
Pairing is easy, just turn the controller on and off twice.
Charging is a bit complicater, you gotto set the right settings. You can charge 1 battery per time or you need a bms for parallel charging. 
I've setted up the settings so they should be fine, just make sure to put it on balanced charge. 
I can always help you out.
