Last call, and really hoping I can get it off my hands I would hate to have to throw it out in the airport or have to take it apart to reuse the cells and waste a good pack by doing that.

I'm moving to China, so won't be needing it.
I bought it not long ago for my board, did 3 or so charges really nothing only to balance it out after being made and check if its good.

Its made by PWRboards, not Unik.
Comes with a 2A Charger, charge port (Round) BMS preinstalled that can be on top or in front its bypass so charge only and an antispark loop.

Works perfect, the seller claims it runs up to 60A just fine.


Its made out of Samsung 30Q Cells for those that not sure about the title.
Totals out at 9000Mah.
I'm located in Denmark, can ship most of Europe prices are around 10 - 15 euro depending on the area. (Some places a bit more)

I accept PayPal or bank transfer (Transferwise). (Buyer pays all fees)
For quicker shipping, I would prefer to have the shipping fees paid by Friends / Family or Bank transfer to prevent it being on hold.

Also, I only ship to verified addresses or the one mentioned on your PayPal receipt, unless we do a bank transfer.

Again the price is 180, that's 100 euro less then what I paid and so far the cheapest 10S3P made out of 30Q I've found by far.
