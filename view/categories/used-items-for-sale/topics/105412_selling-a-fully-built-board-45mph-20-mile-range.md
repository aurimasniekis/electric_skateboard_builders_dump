Hello all, I am selling my build, I'm selling it because I just need the money right now. This board is sweet and I have not put more than 200 miles on it. The board is quality, and extremely fast, with a rider like myself who weighs 165 pounds, I have hit 45 mph on a flat surface and 52 mph going slightly downhill while tucked. It has a 20-mile range approximately, I have gotten 32 out of it as the maximum. I would wear a motorcycle helmet with it. Message me for any questions or concerns what so ever. 

The board's specs are as follows:

Deck: 1x Loaded Tesseract from Alpine Ski Shop

Trucks: 2x 218mm trucks from Torque Boards

Wheels: 4x ABEC 107mm 74A reflex (black)

Wheel Pulleys: 2x 36T HTD5 12mm from Torque Boards

Motor Mounts: 2x 63mm motor mounts from Torque Boards

Motor Pulleys: 2x 16T HTD5 12mm from Torque Boards

Speed Controller: 1x FocBox Unity

Motors: 2x Turnigy SK8 6374-192KV Sensored Brushless Motor (14P) from HobbyKing

Battery: 1x 12S4P Battery (Samsung 30Q with battery percentage indicator and on/off switch) from Torque Boards, also includes the 2 amp charger

Remote: Vanpro Electric Skateboard DIY V2 Edition 2.4G Mini Wireless Remote Control Receiver Transmit 80 Meters Away Wireless from Amazon

Longboard Nose Guard and Tail Guard: Rubber, from Amazon

Bearings: Bones Bearings Reds Bearings (8 pack W/Spacers and Washers), from Amazon

I am looking for $1,599 or best offer, feel free to negotiate with me and message me, also if its easier for you, you can text me 7033713519, that's the fastest way to contact me!

$2350?!?!?  Wtf?!?!
Unity= $250
Motors = $200
Battery $350 with enclosure 
Wheels $90
Mounts $100
Bearings $20
Remote = questionable- it looks like the type that will cut out randomly 
Deck= ugliest thing ive ever seen

Your board is closer to $1000 bud, figure it out...

I put this for a reason, if you don't like it, you don't have to buy it. Also, you didn't factor in the labor and other components into what you said.

This is a builders forum. No one cares how longs it tooks you to builds it  and most can do it better and faster! I was just listing prices so peoples can get a basic overview. Board is worth $1000 and thats being generous. Potential buyers now have a baselines to go buy and can negotiates accordingly

labor for what?   You're using off the shelf hobbyking motors, and off-the-shelf components that anyone could bolt together.... and you're charging $2350 for a board with a **DUCT TAPED ON ENCLOSURE**! LMAO.

You could literally buy a brand new evolve gtx board and a boosted mini for the price you're asking. You're either stupid or trolling.  I can't tell to be honest.

This board is mechanically incapable of hitting 45 LOL. Check the calculator, I've found them accurate to the 1/10th mph. Overpriced is fine- but stop trying to lie

Ebay and craigslist is your best bet finding someone who would drop that find of money. I just sold my board for $1,200 posted it on news forum for a while with no biters...why? because everyone is a builder around here, we are just vultures for parts. I think the only thing worthy in that mess of a build is the Unity

Really on the fence about getting the board. What's keeping me from getting it is the price.

How worth do you think the board is? I'm also worried about how long this board will last me. 1500 is a lot of money.

Any experiences or opinions help. Thanks!

Edit: Thank you guys so much for all the responses! All this truly helps!

I would say that the actual parts of the board are nice however put together in not the best way

Therefore I would say probably $1200-$1300 is around fair for this

I'd say its worth for $1000.
You'd need to do alot yourself to fix it up

New enclosure thats not taped on 
Fix the phase wiring
New deck

Taking all that into account plus labor, $1000 seems fair
```
