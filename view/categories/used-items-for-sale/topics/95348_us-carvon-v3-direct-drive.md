This Carvon V3 set was my daily driver for a while and was amazing for me. This set will flat out scoot and can take any Abec wheels to allow for swapping. I generally just used 97MM Abecs and that was a great setup.

Make me an offer. Thanks for looking.![CarvonV3|690x335](upload://kTxAwK2p7ItibMaHErUn1wtPmWJ.jpeg) ![CarvonV3back|690x335](upload://sNI9GbIwRIaGxSOGLACjpH4XVUr.jpeg)
