Hi I think 15 would be ok, just. I have a 16 ply deck you can have instead. I don’t mind which I have. I’m 72kg so 15ply is probably better anyway 👍🏻

That one is sold (the one in the comments). The ones I have left are up top. The 15ply is hardly any different to the 16ply. Well for me it wasn’t (I’m just under 11st) 👍🏻

Hi 
Witch of the 180 pound boards would you recommend if i was to convert it to a e-board? i'm 95kg

Hi, 

To be honest the 3 boards I have will not be best suited for the 95kg range. If you look at the above chart, a 16 or 17 ply long deck will be the best option for you. 👍🏻 I did have a 16 long but it has sold now. I have a 15 long but like I said I believe you may be better with a 16ply or 17ply.

I think it would be better if you used the translator to translate to English, since the everyone here speaks English even tho its not their main langue

@isqueromeroderviz Penso que seria melhor se você usasse o tradutor para traduzir para Inglês, já que todos aqui falam inglês, mesmo que não seja sua língua principal

@Acido this is a google auto translation of your wise words in portuguese :joy:
