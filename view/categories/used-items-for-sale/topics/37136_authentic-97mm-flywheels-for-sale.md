Ive made the decision to part out my e board. I have attached a link to a video I made about the board and all of the parts you see in the video are for sale. In addition to those parts I have brand new 83mm flywheel clones and a brand new sk3 245kv 6374 motor. I am in Canada so shipping within Canada should be easy however I am willing to ship globaly. I will post photos soon, PM me if interested:)
Thanks!
LIST OF PARTS STILL AVAILABLE:
authentic 97mm flywheels 75usd
Bustin mission 36 deck 25usd

BRAND NEW PARTS:
83mm flywheel clones 25usd

From Canada too!
Would buy the mount, the remote, and the sk3 motor if it hasn't sold. Pm me if this would work. Or a portion of it. Or just say what's up. HAHA
