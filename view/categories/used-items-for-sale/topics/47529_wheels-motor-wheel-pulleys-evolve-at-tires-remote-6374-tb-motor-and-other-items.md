Im talking with @Latemate  right now because it will be pretty pricey to ship them but Im waiting on his reply. He is only interested in the 36t/16t 12mm pulley kits from TB. 

I can lock you in for the 36t/15t 15mm pulley kits and if he doesn't grab the 12's then they're yours.

Im not really selling my black MBS 100mm wheels but if you wanted them I'd say $60 plus shipping because they're barely used. I wanted to wear them in for the shaved grippy look/feel they get.
