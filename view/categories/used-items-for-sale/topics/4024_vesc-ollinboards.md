Why not return it to @chaka and buy a TB 12s ESC directly from @torqueboards, so you're actually covered under warranty through TB.

because i dont have the time to set it up and this is the only thing keeping me from my boards completion. I also plan on running 3p with 120amps so i no longer need the vescs 60amp cutoff. I also plan on running 12s with lifepo4 which wont work with my motor and the vesc
