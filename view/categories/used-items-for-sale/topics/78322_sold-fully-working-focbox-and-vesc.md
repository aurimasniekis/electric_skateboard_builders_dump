Hey guys Ive got 1x Focbox and 1x Vedder Vesc 4.12 fully working for sell. Because I need the money atm I would sell them a bit cheaper.

The Enclosure of the FocBox has a tiny bit silicone rest on it because It was in my build but it doesent affect any function at all.

I dont have pictures atm because they are on the way back to me from MartinSp Repair so I can send them directly to the buyer. Both Vesc and Focbox are working without any problems!

Just write a price for what you need. Payment only with paypal and Iam shipping from Germany.

I was thinking Focbox about 60 bucks and the Vesc like 20-30 bucks. I think thats a good and fair deal.

Who hits me up first gets it first.

Greets :)

Heyho, so for the focbox there are just the Motor wires without bullet connectors atm, I used them on my new build, and yes you are right I changed it to xt90 but as said everything works fine no worries. The Vesc is a original vedder one with heatsink. MartinSp does a really good Job there :)

I don’t doubt that everything is working fine, but usually you need to upload pictures if you want to sell something here. As you can’t do it, i think it wouldn‘t be bad as min to write a bit more about the general conditions like you did now.
Maybe you can get Martin to make some pics?
