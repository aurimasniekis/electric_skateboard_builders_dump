Hi everyone,
I bought this mount new from Marcmt88 and put about 300 miles on it.  Only selling because I want to try a mount without idlers.  This mount is rock solid and never once shifted or came loose.  The top end of the motor mount and pulley cover were eased (by me) to allow me to tuck the motor as close to the deck as possible.  The pulley cover has also been bored out so the motor shaft can poke through.  I took extra pictures so that you could see this.

Included in this sale:
(1) Motor mount
(1) Adapter for Caliber II trucks
(1) Pulley cover
(2) Idlers
(20) New mounting screws (motor mount to truck adapter connection)
(7) New pulley screws
(4) New pulley lock nuts
(9) HTD-330 Belt (15mm wide) - 6 new and 3 slightly used

I paid about $120 for all of this new.  Will let it go for $50 shipped anywhere in the CONUS.  Send me a message if you are interested.
