[Ebay listing here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/172712953083?ssPageName=STRK:MESCX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1585.l2649)

I put up my used Zboard 2 Blue on Ebay if anybody's interested. The board is controlled via footpads on the deck, so you step on the front footpad to go forward and the rear footpad to brake. The board has front and back LEDs as well for nighttime riding. The board is in great condition and I've put less than 100 miles on it. If you have questions feel free to post them and I'll get back to you ASAP. 

Some specs:
Motor: 1000W Brushless outrunner motor
Modes (from slowest to fastest): Slow, Eco, Expert, Ludicrous
Range: 16 miles (on Eco mode)
Speed: Up to 20 mph
Weight: 17 lbs
Wheels: 90mm
Recharge time: 90 min to fully charge

Haha didn't realize you were one of the DC skaters! I'm jealous man, I bet you all had a blast. As you can see, I'm still in the market so I'll check this out :) 

I've always been intrigues by the foot pads...not sure If I'll love or hate it.
