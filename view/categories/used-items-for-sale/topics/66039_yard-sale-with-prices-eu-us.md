So with Hummies hubs/boards finally coming and Carvons Exo Pros being shipped I'm in the position to move some of my stuff to make room. The parts are listed in bundles if they don't sell in three weeks I'll break them up an re-list in this thread.

*Note: Prices do not Include shipping. I am happy to negotiate........ within reason. Make dumb offers and be prepared to be told to fuck off...with love.

These are located in Madrid Spain, however I will be coming stateside around Dec. and can potentially carry over with shipping from Florida
