Lightly used 6374 190kv sensored torque board motors.   
Theyâ€™re in perfect working order.  Just taken off a badass board and replaced for something different (due to personal preference)  
They come with 5.5mm male connectors 
8mm shaft with 3mm keyway 

Pulleys not included but that can always be negotiated 

Will ship within the US only 

$140 for the set or $75 each plus shipping 

Thanks for looking ![image|375x500](upload://9ulXYHgbVspkZOJePAabsasv6Ba.jpeg)
