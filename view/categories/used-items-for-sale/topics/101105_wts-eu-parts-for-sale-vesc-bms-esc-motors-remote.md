Hi,

I've updated the post with some pictures. I'm not sure about hub and/or belt motors for the dual-esc. I've tried belt motor and it seemed to work.

Hi, to Madrid with UPS it’s 12€. 

In fact the motor is already attached to a torque board motor mount, I haven’t took the time to take them apart, I had some loctite applied in there. I was not planning on selling the mount, let me come back to you this afternoon with some pics and an updated price. 


Thanks.
