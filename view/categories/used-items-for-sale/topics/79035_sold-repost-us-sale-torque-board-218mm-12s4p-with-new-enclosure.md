I'm quite interested in the battery, and if I got the battery is get the trucks along with it....

Not trying to hinder the sale/be rude (I'm sure it'll sell on this forum) but like - can anybody comment on what a battery in like this would be new? I know the cells alone would be close to $200 (~$4x48?) - and is presume 250 miles is about 20-30 cycles? How much degradation on the system does that really equate to?
