Hi there

I'm selling my Meepo board, only used for around 15km to do coffee runs in the morning, the thing is I finished my own build and I don't need this board anymore. 

It's in very good state, as you can see in the photos, I'm selling it for €130 + shipping

Let me know if you're interested. Sending to Europe only

It is the older model of campus yes, but the parts are practically similar, the board looks slightly different

Never actually measured range or any stat really

On the website when I bought it it said it has a 9km range, goes 22kph 

I think the only thing different is the actual board, not the components
