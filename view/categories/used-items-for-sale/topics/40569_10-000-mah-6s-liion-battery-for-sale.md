This one is from an eboard I purchased back in October 2016 (Lectric Longboard). It's a 6S battery -- I think it's 10,000 mAh. (EDIT: Probably 8,000 mAh). No labels on it. I had about 8-10 miles of range with it, going 15-18 mph on average.

I just wanna get rid of it-- willing to sell it for whatever honestly. $50? I'm not sure how much it's worth.

Someone online told me it was 10Ah but you're probably right. I updated the post.

Is this a lipo, liion or whatever? What is the Max dischare rate?

It is a liion. 
Not sure what the discharge rate is but I used it with a VESC and reached 25 mph just fine.

How is it too flat to be a li-ion? I've seen plenty of them in my life.. like the ones in phones and various other electronics.

It would have to be 18mm in height minimum to be li-ion

So why do they say li-ion everytime? Does it even matter?

@GrecoMan
@Sk8Board  

your average lipo is a lithium ion polymer battery. It's essentially the same as a Liion but in a prismatic pouch

Yes, but 18650 is the most common for electric skateboards.

His point is that lipos are a type of liion.
