Truck width isn't the main thing that brings stability, the bushings and kingpin angle are also very important. 
That being said, these trucks are mega wide, but I do not recommend for stability.

You could get the Paris 11in trucks but good luck finding bolt on mounts for Paris not many people make those anymore... 

Your only other option is ghetto frabrication :) make a mount

Production on those trucks stopped though. I'm working on a solution. Actually, buck trucks will work too, but you need to file down some of the hanger. Also I'm going to make a slightly larger mount in the next week or so.

You could also try "spring loaded". Not sure how much stability it will give tho

Around $90,- for 2. Not super cheap but seems decent for a beautiful set of those

Paris 11" may be hard to find a mount to go with but go easily with hub motors.

Would only throw hub motor on the front, but 90 isn't bad was checking out 215mm independent trucks for 50

Liquid Frye CNC 200mm probably best you can get.
