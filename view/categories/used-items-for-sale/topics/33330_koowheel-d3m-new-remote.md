The remote is useless without the Koowheel skateboard, so please bare that in mind.

It's scandalous to sell this remote for 30 euro.
It's offered for 7€ on Aliexpress, directly from Koowheel.

How can you ask 23€ more than the newprice of the item.

I shouldn't hijack your thread just like that, but fuck me, this is a total ripoff for anyone here in the community.

Yes, it’s 8 Euro, plus another 9 for shipping. I bought it from AliExpress. 

I’m not selling this remotes for business, I just bought this one, doesn’t fit to me, so I’m reselling it. Where’s problem?

The price includes shipping cost and you don’t have to wait a month for shipping from China
