The remote is gone am I right? 
May I ask if it had any connection issues? I heard that this new version of winning is better....

I'll ask but I think 70 is his best offer, he had 20 more budgeted for ABS to make an enclosure, I thought I could him a little higher if you had a good enclosure for it.

They've taken a few hits but still hold tight. What you're mostly seeing is that they're dirty.

I would do 90 shipped for the battery :slight_smile:

edit: are you sure the battery is ok? How much would it have flexed in the plastic that broke x.x

Ok Mike. Time to tell your friend it's time to put up or respectfully lower the auditory tone of his $70 offer slightly. :shushing_face: Otherwise, I'm snatching this up.

Hey, for the shaft, look at the base, there is some set screws... snug those up and it should be good, mine come loose quite often

All thatâ€™s left are the 90mm wheels, any offers or trades? Iâ€™ve got them listed for $20
Something Iâ€™m looking for is 2 15t 15mm motor pulleys with a Keyway. Maybe some griptape, hexâ€™s would be awesome.
