Looking to trade 10s8p battery.
The cells are made of Samsung 26j 18650 batteries.
Discharge current is 42a and charge current is 21a.
No BMS but there’s a balance connector attached.
I had a smaller 10s6p made out of these batteries and it was working great and the range was amazing.
I built this battery for a stiff deck but ended up buying a vanguard deck so it will not fit.

Looking for:
Motors, Vescs, Smaller battery packs, Wheels Enclosures and trucks.
I might be interested in different things so don’t be shy to make an offer.

I’ll upload pictures tomorrow.
