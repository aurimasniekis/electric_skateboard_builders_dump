Since I upgraded the electronics and enclosure of my Bamboo GT, I'm selling the surplus parts. Would like to sell everything together, make me an offer I can't refuse :slight_smile: .

 Everything works, except perhaps the bms, see the pics where the glue is slightly burned. I think the bms may be salvaged with a little technical magic.

I know it says the bms is 50/50 but it might be worth looking into at least :)
