Hello!

I need to make some space, so here's what I've got:

2x Yuneec E-Go Decks (Both used with some wear, but intact) ($50/Ea)
2x sets of Yuneec Wheels + Trucks (8 Wheels, 2 normal trucks, 2 Powered Trucks) ($100/4 Wheel Set)
1x Yuneec Charger ($50)
1x Dead Yuneec Battery (Needs new cells, BMS OK) ($20)
2x Remote (One in good condition, one thats beaten up but will work) ($50)
1x Working ECU ($100)

This would be sold as a single unit, shipped in the original Yuneec Box by FedEx.
Shipping is about $20-30 USA.

I'm looking for about $550 USD for the lot.
Shoot me a PM or reply here.

- Ken

Yep! Turns out the battery cells in the pack are at 24.34V so they're not damaged. They need to be charged above 25.2V to get charged by the BMS though.

I'm really not interested in all but I would like to take a few things if your willing to. A bus ran over my board today and I need a new deck, battery enclosure and front truck. I got lucky

I can respond to this pretty quickly.  Turns out the cells are OK - 24.45V is low for a 7s system, but they need to be charged a little higher before the built in BMS can charge them.

I'l get back to you tomorrow

Whoops!

Sorry, I just got back to school life.  I left the majority of my Yuneec EGo parts at home and only brought a partially stripped down Yuneec BMS.

Oh, it's okay if no battery contained.
How could I buy the BMS board?

## \#19 Posted by: KMeyerson Posted at: 2017-02-07T05:26:47.626Z Reads: 116

```
The board is literally just a PCB and the resistors and capacitors.  I used the TI-BQ chip for my own BMS and used the MOSFETs as well.  

I don't know what part you need to repair, but I can tell you what part you need.

I'm headed to DC on March 3rd to give a lecture. I can see how many good motors I have. I SHOULD have one motor/rear truck that works. I admit I haven't tested it since I repaired it. But it should be fine? I have one good one that tests OK, but I would like to get rid of that whole board (the battery cells needs to be boosted up at least 1V total to get into the BMS charging range.

Yes.  I'd prefer to send the board (minus battery) or with battery with the understanding that the battery needs work.

Hi Yall,
I'm still in Boston till July.  When I get back to DC, I can ship the parts places.  I'll take reservations though.

1x Deck (OK)
2x ESC (Working, 1x Crapped Out)
2x Battery (1x Enclosure, 1x Battery and Enclosure [needs a bit of charging to get out of the red zone])
Motor Trucks, Charger, and Remotes.

I'll add pics but that's what I've got if my memory serves me right.

Last I checked ( a few months ago) they were all above 3.0 but too low for the BMS to begin charging them.  The TI BMS doesn't charge batteries that are too low and I didn't have a charger I could rig to charge them.
