Bought a DIYEboard kit, used it for a month or so.  The ESC died so I tried my hand at replacing it with a Flipsky 4.20, found out I'm more interested in the skating than the DIY. Selling all the components.  Shipping is not included in pricing and is at buyers cost.  Happy to provide pics and shipping estimates on request.  Will update as things sell.

Your not off with pricing, it‚Äôs just diyeboard, is not a reputable company and is a known scammer, @Bobby Is laughing because of his bad experience with them
