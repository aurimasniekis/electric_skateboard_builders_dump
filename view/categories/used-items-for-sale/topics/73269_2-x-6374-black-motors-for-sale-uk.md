That is a good price , I am old skool and prefer to drive round , see the stuff and pay and collect but you live other end of England . They will sell quickly at that price , if you lived in London I would drive round today and buy them , I am going to pass for the moment unless I can‚Äôt find anyone more local to me

For anyone that was interested, I am sorry I cannot them sell them as new. I just opened those box properly and inspected them.

1 motor has a broken magnet and the other spins  a little weird

Hi,

I bought them from a factory in China, I bought 4 motors 2 were good and the other 2 were dodgy. I had used them before and had similar experiences but that was a while ago. I have no clue whats wrong with mine apart from that one of the magnets in the motor is broken.

I am planning on getting some from directly from Maytech or SK3 Factory and I know those motors are rock solid.

I think you can, but at the same time I don't think you will be fixing your problems. You could have more problems down the line
