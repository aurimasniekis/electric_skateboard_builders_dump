Hello world,

I have slightly used 97mm Evolve wheels, our roads are not good enough for 97mm so I went up to 107 F1...

As you can see on the images they have some chips, I have pictured the worst part of every wheel, so you have clear picture of the state they are in... I've ridden them for about 2 weeks...

60e for a set + shipping from Serbia (Europe, but not European Union).

I hope someone will use them well

but are they really 78a or are they just a hard sh*t like most of the other clones out there?

Well it's clones dude. At this price you won't get much better IMHO ; and between Reflys/Boa and clones rebound you got Orangatang wheels which fit nicely.

Did you see the cyan Caguama 85mm BTW?

(And if you're used to harder /lower wheels clones do feel pretty smooth and sticky)
