I bought this board a couple of months ago and just haven't had enough time to work on it. **Asking $550** (Shipping details at bottom)

The board does **NOT** come with a battery. It will require a 10S3P spacecell-style battery.

Comes with Venom bushings, ABEC 83mm 75A Flywheels, unused replacement lid, carrying bag, 3 replacement belts, carrying bag, remote (of course), and some misc hardware. I also have an extra Triple Eight helmet, I can throw that in too if you want it.

As part of my ongoing restoration of this board, I added new grip tape to the deck/lid, and replaced the steel mounting bolts with stainless bolts. I recommend that the buyer also replace the lid screws with stainless screws for increased longevity.

Now, before someone asks, I am not going to part out this board. I would like to send it all off in a single box.

Other Stuff:
* One of the VESCs (the master I think), had the USB port just fall off. I can include the USB port and some replacements ones. Just has to be soldered back on.
* For some reason the board came with a fake plate saying the board has a <100Wh battery. I don't know how that's affixed but I imagine that it will come off with some heat.
* I diy'd one of the lids to have a charging port/LCD glued into it. This lid is missing a switch. It's meant to hold a pushbutton switch from Ebay/Ali.

Obvious Stuff:
* I can't offer refunds, please do your research. As stated, the battery is a dud. If you can't fix/replace the battery, then don't buy it.
* There is some minor cosmetic wear to the body/motors.
* Both VESCs are tested/working with different battery. Remote works, Motors spin, etc...

Shipping: Shipping is via UPS from Boulder, CO in a 40" x 12" x 12" box weighing 20 lbs. Shipping is included with the purchase!

PM if you have any questions!

That's all!

Not getting as much interest as I would have hoped. I just added free shipping, and am no longer shipping the broken battery with the board.

Feel free to PM an offer!

do the esc's and motors in this board support a 12s configuration?

The motors are indeed rated for 12s.

For the ESCs:
From what I can tell, they are just plain old 4.12 vescs. It looks like a lot of people have had good luck with a 12s config. I can't make any promises though.
