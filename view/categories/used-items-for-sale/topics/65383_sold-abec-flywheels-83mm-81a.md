Because then it  is convoluted and people ask if stuff is available still that has already been sold or there are a bunch of questions that are unrelated to the rest of the items for sale.

Then just edit it out after itâ€™s bought... or even say sold , or even ignore. No need to clutter the feed with separate threads for an item
