Hello I am jumping on the ban wagon and selling my current build because am allready in the process of making another one need the money. I will be selling this build for cheap it was my first build and alot of versions of it over the months of owning it. 
The parts are 
TB esc -145$ X 2 -290$
Bamboo loaded  flex 2 -240$
Dual 6374- 240$
TB 218mm trucks -50$
Genuine abec wheels 97mm  75a - 80$ (from Chaka)
The remote is gt2b with madmonkey mod -50$
TB single bolt on motor mount w/drive wheel kit -106$ X 2 -212$
Batteries -  2 6s turnigy nano -tech 4500mah 25-50c lipo -120$ ( used only about 10 times brand new )
The enclosure was from pychotiller at the esk8 meet up got it for free 
The total for everything I've paid was about 1292$ in parts not including my fuck ups
I will include 2 lipo chargers and 2 lipo fireproof bags for free in the board purchase
They are 
Hobbymate HB120AC duo -100ish$
B6AC 80w 6A -60$
My asking price is at least 750$ price is negotiable 
Am selling this for cheap because it's my first board and alot of mistakes have bin done am not trying to rip anyone off so am going to clearly state what the board has gone through I had two 6355s and the strators both got mest up so dual 6374's the bamboo board has alot of screws holes roughly about 15  I've had 3 different types of mounting methods on it (I've bounce on the board several times  like a boosted weigh 180 and nothing has happened)
Before the motor teeth keep coming loose I think it's because I am to lazy to apply red locktite , and the mounting brackets one screw on each bracket is stripped can still move them freely and change the angle no problem. Just can't pull them apart. This board is my daily commute to school (highschool) I've recorded every mile on it and have babied it. Yet to find any hill I can't destroy
NOTE :ABEC 11 WHEELS NO MORE THAN 60 MILES ALONG WITH 6374'S
