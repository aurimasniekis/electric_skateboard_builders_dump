Hey fellow esk8rs! I've got a hugertech racer for sale road it about a hundred miles so far and put after market bushings on it and comes with an extra battery remote and charger. Honestly I would prefer to trade it for someone's abandoned project but ill consider offers! I'm in Boise![20190316_134037|666x500](upload://2xotvuUaVhH9118MMTx9t3QwgnW.jpeg) . ![20190316_134123|374x500](upload://dhoEZCgc21GPc2tU5ckoiieUx76.jpeg)

depends on what your willing to trade including said 150 this board goes 26 mph has a 20 mile range and has a cool app a decent controller and an extra battery 150 is kind of a silly offer by itself no offense you probably just weren't aware of its epicness.

The speed is entirely possible and you would know this if you had ever ridden a landwheel.  They have a flight friendly pack and achieve those speeds.  And please don't get negative on a guys sales thread.  You don't want to buy or trade then keep your opinions to yourself.

This board is worth maybe $300 upon further review.... I am no expert but I‚Äôve read a bit on the specs. 90mm hub motors with a 10s2p, lg cells rated 2200mah. A jerky esc and the remote uses Bluetooth as connection.  Ive read power usage and cutouts can be a problem. I personally dont like the deckshape, but the lights seem cool. 
All things considered, id probably get meepo motors with a dual and a 10s battery yo go just as fast if not faster. May have better luck on reddit

Edit: I could be wrong and mean no offense. Just my opinion and those usually aren‚Äôt great to begin with üò¨. Good luck with the sale

I don't know the mm of the hub motors but they're not the motors your thinking of. the 90mm hub motors are rated at 500w these are 1000w each. you may be thinking of the other huger tech board.

I had the Travel board and it was fucking awful. Deck was the worst. Had no concave so you didn‚Äôt feel locked in... sold it for $268

Hope I didn‚Äôt ruin the sale... just felt like I had to say it...

Thanks lol

Hubs where actually pretty sexy. Not sure if they where actually waterproof. Stones got stuck pretty easy though. I did consider keeping the hubs and build a board with them lol. The remote was actually also quite nice.

Make a new battery and it‚Äôs much better. Mount the parts on a new deck and it‚Äôs 10 times better. Probably get some new bushings while you are at it too.
