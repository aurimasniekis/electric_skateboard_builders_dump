Hello,
I am looking to see if there is any interest for a dual sensored esc rated for 12s 150 amps. Really should be called new as it has less than 5 miles on it but I will put it under used as I has had power run through it. I am looking to replace it with vesc's so that I can implement the monitoring apps that are available. Asking $275 shipped within the states or $300 international. The esc has a capacitor bank that was installed by Bruno from APS. Also would be interested in a trade for 2 standard vescs if anyone would be interested. 
Link to new product.

Easily worth $350 by the time you calculate shipping and capacitor bank.
