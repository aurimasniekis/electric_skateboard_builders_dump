I'm selling parts from my electric skateboard.  Been sinking too much money into the hobby and need to cut expenses in the fun time department.  I included a few pictures and can take more if you need close ups or other angles.  I'm flexible on prices for everything within reason.  Just trying to cover some bills. I'm located in Houston, TX and prefer to ship to US only.

6355 bent motor = $40 shipped
6355 good one = $50 shipped
Marcmt88 mounts = $100 shipped
15T motor + 38T wheel (15MM) = $30 shipped
2 TB VSEC = $125 shipped
Remote with receiver = $30 shipped (Unsure which one but it's in my pictures) 

Battery, wheels, and trucks have been sold. All other parts available as of 11/11/18.

One of the motors is bent, not sure if its an easy fix but the casing is bent so that it rubs and recently stopped spinning freely.  The other motor is only cosmetic damage. I have 2 or 3 sets of belts all in good shape, 320MM and 340MM length (15MM belt). Have the enclosure for VSEC as well.

Whole board

Do you need the enclosure to go with the battery? It will have the charger.  I would go $95 with shipping included.  The remote, I would go for $30, if I toss it in the same box I may have to charge a little more for shipping since I'll need to use a bigger box to ship it.  Post Office is the cheapest I've seen so far.

I would say $40 for the set. Shipping, I'll have to get back to you on that, I don't have a box that would fit it so I'm not sure the exact cost.  If I can fit it in the small flat rate box, then probably just $45 with shipping included.

I'm not too sure as far as international shipping goes. I tried to see what Fedex would charge and I'm sure I did it wrong as it quoted something crazy like $130. If you know a way to ship them, I could try it. I'm aiming for US only as I heard it can be a pain to ship outside the US. The trucks though, I'll probably go for $40.

For all of it with shipping, aiming for $190.  I don't plan to go cheap with the mounts as they were only used once and only about 50 feet to test them.  Trucks would be $40, pulleys about $30 and $110 for whole mount kit (https://bit.ly/2EztYsr) and $13 for shipping.

If you don't mind me taking them apart, like taking the truck off the king pin, I can squeeze it in a small box and let it got for $45 including shipping. I have them with the yellow nipples but can swap them back with my purple nipples if you prefer. That or dig around for the original black bushings they came with.

Yep, still have both of them. I'm not sure if bent is the right word to use. In one of the pictures, you can kind of tell the can? is off center.  I'll have to post a better picture but the back end of the motor is tilted and rubs against the part of the motor you bolt down to the motor mount. I'm not good with naming the parts of the motor I'm afraid. If you can re-aline the back end, the motor works perfect mechanically, it just stopped spinning freely due to grinding into the other part.

Beyond the bent motor, is any other repair/work required?  How much would you want for the full kit (including caboodle)?

Not sure if I would call it repair or work but the one motor with the bent casing, it will need to be realigned.  The mounting bracket came loose and so it's off center and needs to be put back in place so the belt doesn't shred. I need to update the listing but I did end up selling the battery earlier today. Still have everything else at this moment though. As far as price for the whole thing, I guess about $500? I don't know how I could ship it all together though. I guess I could find a big enough box for it but I'm sure it may be a bit expensive.  Didn't think anyone would want it all together lol
