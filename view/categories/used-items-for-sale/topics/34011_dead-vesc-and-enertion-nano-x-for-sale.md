I am selling a dead vesc and a Nano x remote. Vesc was purchased from Diyelectric 2 months ago. It throws a drv error whenever I apply throttle. Nano x remote is in perfect condition, only had a small scratch by the thumb wheel. Was used on my friends board for 2 weeks before he received his remote. 

Vesc is 45 shipped ( CONUS ONLY )
Nano X  (SOLD)
