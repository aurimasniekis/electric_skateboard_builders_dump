6mm shafts are alright. I have built several boards with 6mm shafts and they do just fine.  I have snapped a couple after extended use with bent brackets and physical abuse but replacement shaft is only $5 and easy to do.

I'm having a problem finding 6mm bore 15mm wide 5mm pitch pulleys for the motor, preferably 16 teeth. Do you know where to find those fairly cheap? I have these same motors for a dual drive but I can't for the life of me find the right pulleys.
