Leaving Esk8 for awhile, sad to see these go but I just don't have the time anymore. I gotta sell everything. 

MAKE ME SOME OFFERS!!

First board cost like $1500 to build?

Hummie deck

Big Ben enclosure

SR TKP trucks with 80mm axles

Bergmeister pneumatics with custom 56t pulleys

Senor Pepe 90mm with custom 32t pulleys

12s4p flexy pack that I built with a Bestech D596

Focbox Unity

TB 6374 190kv motors with 16t pulleys

Psychotiller quick66 mounts

Mini remote 

2a charger


Needs one motor fixed or replaced. The magnets have came loose so either you could swap out the can or you could battle harden them and I'm sure that'd hold them in place

2nd board "Spud Lightyear" cost like $1100 as it sits?

Jet Spud 29"

Jlab 11s3p Samsung 30q with bestech D140 and 3a charger

Metr bluetooth module

Maytech 100a vescs

Freebord bindings with Cerakoted bases

SR TKP trucks with "Space Ranger" engraving

Boardnamics 50mm motor mounts also 
Cerakoted

Dual 5065 170kv sealed maytech motors 16t pulleys

Orangatang 80mm 83a kegels with 32t pulleys

Nano remote

Extra belts, ppm splitter (to run the switch in parallel) and extra switch

Ran this board as a single 6355 for awhile until I snapped my mount and broke the motor at the same time. Started to convert it to Dual Diagonal 5065 but haven't had time to finish it. One of the vescs needs to be checked out, I plugged it in and it never worked for me.
