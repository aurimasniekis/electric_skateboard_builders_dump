Ever since I have fallen in love with pneumatics, I don't want to use anything else, hence selling these **unused hubs**. I mounted them on a board but never completed it and hence unused, but since they are not in their original packaging and has been mounted I am listing them as used. I am hoping to get $140 shipped(only USA) to you. 

If you buy them new they will cost you $110(rear) + $45(front) = $155 including shipping
