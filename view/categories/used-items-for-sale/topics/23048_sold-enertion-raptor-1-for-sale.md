Yea. Carbon fiber board with trucks as tight as I like em just wasn't the bizz.. I did tune it in w some venom eliminators & freeride hpf's along w some 90mm flywheels. Must Do's and always overlooked I feel like. Right now I'm enjoying my longboardlarry dk penguin custom errrthangg 30q 12s pack.. (the new standard, 25r cells are dead to me) stoked I get my Carvon's on Friday, and raptor 2 sometime this century. My trampa build is on pause till my vesc 6 arrive. (Any day now) the motors have 3.5-4mm bullets so i opted to wait rather than resolder. The new focbox have 3-3.5mm bullets on em now tooo. I'm liking it, less wirey mess for sure. Crazy how overbuilt we had things before.

Dude, this was a post from 1.5 years ago. Thereâ€™s a very good chance the post is no longer relevant. You might wish to continue looking. ðŸ˜‰
