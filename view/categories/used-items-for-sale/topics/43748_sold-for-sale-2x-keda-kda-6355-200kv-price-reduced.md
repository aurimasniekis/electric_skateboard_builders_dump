Hi guys,

I upgraded my daily recently and I have these motors that I dont need anymore. They are KEDA (on some sites KDA) with 6355 dimensions and 200kv suitable for 10S max. I used them for one year and they are absolute beasts in my opinion, I dont have a hill around in my area that these could not pull me (70kg) up with ease. 

I originally bought them locally in an RC store that I think has them from HK but who knows. They were 53€ each, I made some mods to them: key slot on the shaft, replaced silicone wires with 10AWG 25cm long with sleeve, added hall sensors.

I would like to sell them for 35€ each (if you take both we can negotiate something :slight_smile:), including shaft key, pulley 5M14T 10mm width, 4mm bullet connectors and the connectors for halls also I can include some cir-clips that I am not planning on using anymore. 
Worldwide shipping.

I would love to take them off you, but my motor pulleys are for 15mm D: the pulley shaft seems a little small for me...
