I am selling the penny board style deck from a LouBoard 1.0.  The board was maybe used a couple of times and is in new condition.  The deck is blue and the top/grip section is black.  I have additional parts if desired for this board as well.  Here are some stock shots:

I am in Los Angeles, USA.  Anyone outside the country would need to cover the extra shipping charges.
