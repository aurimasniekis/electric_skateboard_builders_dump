Got a few things to sell after my upgrade project.

Racerstar 5065 200kv motors. Both are in great condition with less than 20mi on them. The sensor connectors are set up for vesc but I’m pretty sure I have the Evolve connectors as well. 
SOLD shipped US for the pair.

I just shipped some parts to Germany in a small flat rate box and it was $30 and it was there in a week. I can check if there are any other options
