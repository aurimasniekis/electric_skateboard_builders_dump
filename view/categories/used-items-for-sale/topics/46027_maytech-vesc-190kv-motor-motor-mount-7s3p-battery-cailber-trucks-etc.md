Do you have some actual pictures of the enclosure? Also do you ship outside the UK? (Netherlands in this case)

Edit: is there room for dual Vesc in the enclosure? And what are the enclosure dimensions?

(30-35km)

Thats a 189 Wh pack. You will never get that distance from it.. 20km would be max, but probably more like 16km.

Yes for a 189wh battery averaging around 10wh per kilometre the range should be about 19k. Not sure why the website says 30-35?
