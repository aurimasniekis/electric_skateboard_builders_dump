Hey guys!

As some of you may know, I set out to build a Trampaboard last summer (Summer 2018). I stopped posting on the forum, and never really got along to finishing the build log (ran out of time with college and stuff). It was a blast, and I really enjoyed every step of the way! Anyways, after having this beast for a while, I realized that I just don't use it as much as I wanted, and therefore I will be getting rid of it.

Location - St Paul MN (USA)

Price: $1750 + shipping, I am open to REASONABLE offers. See cost breakdown in imgur link below.

Willing to trade for a OneWheel XR + cash.
Willing to ship if the price is right - ideally would sell locally.

Specs:

* Has about 30 miles on it
* 12s4p, 18650 30Q cells, made by a professional battery builder (@barajabali)
* 149kv 6374 BLDC motors
* Top speed: 25mph at current gear ratio - hit 45mph on a different pulley setup previously, but that was too fast, so I lowered it
* Distance: at 25mph top (average 17mph) was 20 miles in distance

Costs, build, and parts: https://imgur.com/a/frSi6dG

Reason for selling: I built it as a side project this summer as I was learning more about the eskate hobby. I have realized that this board is just too much power, and a bit too heavy for my liking. I live within a 5 minute walk of all my frequent destinations, and therefore do not need this beast of a board. I also have 2 other boards, so I don't really need to hang on to this one.

Comes with board, charger, and remote. Has bindings, but are not currently attached, which I will include as well. Please supply your own helmet!!! This thing is a BEAST.

Board is solid as is. At the time of posting, everything is working as intended, and I can't complain about anything. I did have to send the battery in to Bara to have the antispark replaced previously. Ever since, the board has been working just fine! There doesn't appear to be any impact with any of the other components, but I figure it's best to be honest about stuff like this.

Feel free to ask questions here or in PM.

I have some added photos/videos of  the board powering on/ motors reacting to controller, charger working, overall quality of board, and the board getting packed away for shipment.

Haha sure thing! 

I have some other boards (Onewheel+ and a DIY "WowMeepOwnGoBoard" thingy), just no need to have 3 boards laying around haha.

If you find anyone, hit me up. Definitely prefer not to have to worry about the shipping!

Yeah, I've had a lot of interest, and some people right on the cusp of pulling the trigger, but nobody came through yet.

Kinda sucks to lose over $1000 on this, especially since i've only gotten 3-5 hours of fun riding it... Hopefully I find someone haha

Literally just joined the forum in search of a possible board/ build ideas. After doing a group ride with a budget hub motor board I've been inspired to find something with more hill climb power and better motors. I've been leaning towards an AT build or something with AT wheels, and I have to say this board looks sweet! 

How's the charging time? (If you ever drained the battery)

Hey,

First off - welcome to the forum! Glad to hear you're having a great time getting into the "hobby"

I have never really drained the battery fully. Worst I have done was about 5-7 miles on it in a single session. That being said, it comes with a 4Amp "fast charger". The battery is a 12s4p with 18650 30Q cells. 3000mAh x 4 = 12000mAh total so in "ideal world" it would be 12000mAh/4000mA = 3 hours. In reality it would probably be around 4hours(?) from 0 to 100% due to inefficiencies and such.

Let me know if you have any other questions! :)

It's been a definite journey, that's for sure! I've seen people with similar boards styles like the Kaly that swap out Urethane wheels. Can this one as well?

Sure thing - but you would need to purchase them on your own. [Here are some](https://www.trampaboards.com/wheels-c-48.html) common wheels from Trampa themselves (gummies, urethane, and pneumatic). You may also be able locate others [elsewhere](https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/products/evolve-f1-street-wheels-black-107mm-74a) (such as ABEC11 107MM's). 

One thing to consider would be the gear ratio, and how to adapt to the specific wheels. You could keep the same motors and the same 12T motor gear, but you would likely be unable to do the 72T drive gear due to the size and such. It would be likely to go down to around 36T or so. Keep in mind that this will increase the speed a LOT, and decrease torque, so you may want to re-program the FOCboxes. Belts would also have to likely be replaced and you can find [belt suppliers](https://www.vbeltsupply.com/) which will customize sizes and such to match what you need.

I'm sure some people on the forum would be able to assist you with this if you have questions ;)
