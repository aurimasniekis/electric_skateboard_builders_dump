I had a 7S1P with a single hub motor on it.

I do NOT recommend more than a 350 watt drivetrain on this deck, period.  The wheelbase is too short (11.25") for any more acceleration or braking.

It would work good with the Meepo Campus drivetrain, as long as it was 350 watts or less

That one, the ones that were on the first-gen meepo campus and the cheap eBay boards.  The deal with this deck is you have to stay at 350W or less, because the wheelbase is 11.25"
