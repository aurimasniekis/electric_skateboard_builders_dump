Reason for selling is raising funds for another project. The ABEC 11's have not touched the ground, the kegels and all other components have been used for testing for about 10 minutes on smooth tarmac which is why I've listed them as new.

All prices do not include shipping as calculations may need to be made if sending to europe etc. Convert prices into your currency if needed!
