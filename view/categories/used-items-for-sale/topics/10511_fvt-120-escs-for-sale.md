I have 2x fvt 120 escs for sale. Both little used. Both have 4mm bullet female on the motor side and I think they're called mini deans towards the power side. 
I have the y link cable if someone took both. 
£36 each, postage included to the uk. Possibly Europe but best to check the cost first. 
I'll upload a pic later.

I might be interested in these if they are still available.

Do you happen to have a programming card to go with them as well?

I've got 4 escs in total and I have a USB programmer. 
I'm on holiday for this week so can't really do much but if you're still interested drop me a pm or reply next sun. 
Cheers.

Hi, Totally forgot about these! I do still have a couple but no programer. One of them needs programming to work properly as I mucked it up. I've got loads of other bits and bobs.

I'd do it for £32 inc postage to the uk. That's just a regular postage service with no tracking. It could be signed for service for a few quid more. 
I'd do them both for £45 quid posted.
Cheers
Ben
