Hey guys, im looking to sell both of my current vescs.

They are both v4.12 and run very well, One is enertion, and other vesc is from jedboards (both very high quality)

Never had any issues with them.

Located in Australia, Melbourne, looking to get around 80 US (+5 for shipping) but price is negotiable 

First in best serve

EDIT: They are both loaded with Ackmaniac's custom firmware
