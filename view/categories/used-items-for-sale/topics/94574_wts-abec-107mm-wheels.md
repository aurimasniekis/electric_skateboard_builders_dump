Did you get it from

Yeah, people tend to react like that sometimes, especially when something as "crazy" as your ad shows up. 

You say you don't know what they are worth but you wrote "$450 new", which does sound a bit unreasonable, for the least. Where did you get that price from?

As someone mentioned, those wheels are usually sold around $120 (give or take) new. Aluminium pulley is around $30 new. Belt ~$5. I hope this gives you an idea of why people over-react to your ad.

Would love to see your builds.
There is nothing wrong with your listing, we just think it’s way to over priced. They are really good wheels yes, but 350$ just seems unrealistic. The point everyone is trying to say is that you can get a near equivalent set for less then 250$ New with pulleys off of many venders on the site.

@Kyle77 why the hell would we treat you otherwise?

You shame us for you giving you a hard time over a dumb as fuck price? Really?

We are the arrogant assholes? Really?

You have been here less than a fucking hour and you try to sell this shit at this price and expect a friendly welcome?


We have a community and we look out for eachother.  We call bullshit bullshit.  And this is bullshit.  

You say you thought this was a place to learn? Hell yes it is. But you didn't come here to learn, you came here to sell your shit. And we aren't buying.

I don’t see the need for the harassment. If someone could have said that it’s a little high priced and where I should be on them, I would be fine with that but all the responses were negative, not helpful. I was not disrespecting anyone in here. With everything you have to go to even post in here thought this place would be more civil and friendly. Friendly advice would be taken and helpful, not the bs responses

Don’t take too much offense man, I’ve been here for a long time and I’ve seen plenty of grief myself just for asking questions. Everyone around here that’s being negative is just responding with pride because we are a proud group. When we feel taken advantage of or like someone is trying to hustle us, we group up like lions on a hunt. Again don’t take offense, just realize that we are the people in the world that are keeping this sport going. We are the innovators of most of what is coming out today. I mean take a look at Evolve’s newest creation, it’s a basic bitch compared to what this forums members have created. Anyway, chin up man, thicken your skin and stick around. All those things you thought this place would be, currently are. Adjust your price to be competitive or sell it elsewhere. GLWS!

That is true, HTD3M belts aren't really useful on anything DIY. Boosted uses them, but 99%+ of DIY builds use HTD5M belts.  

Also you can ask any price. Don't pay it if you don't want to. Offer less if you feel the urge.  

Ridiculing sellers is not super-helpful.

Sorry @Kyle77 (don't take it badly), but your price is wayyyyyyyy out of range. $350 for a 107 Flywheel set with pulleys and some Boosted belts?? C'mon man. You are hurting the community and hurting yourself. My man @FranciscoV here bought a set for me (in much better condition than yours) for just $87 dollars! Bounch of printed Flywheel pulleys go for $20 and those Boosted belts for another $20 tops. No more than $130 for all. Your price is from another Constellation in a far away distant Solar system. :roll_eyes:

Hey @Kyle77 you were baited by the forum kids who have not yet learned the subtlety needed to put forward an argument without injury.

The prices are too high but can understand you if you did not know this. Realistically you are looking for about third of that price from anyone here.

Post up your builds!

No, they are NOT IN STOCK anywhere. [Sickboards](https://www.sickboards.nl/en/1057-electric-skateboard-wheels) carry almost everything except the 107mm Electric Flywheel.

They carry 83mm, 90mm and 97mm ABEC 11 Flywheels thou. But not the legendary 107mm Electric Flywheel.

They also carry 83mm, 90mm and 97mm Refly and the 107mm Superfly

No 107mm Electric Flywheels at that place. There is a difference.... :point_down:
