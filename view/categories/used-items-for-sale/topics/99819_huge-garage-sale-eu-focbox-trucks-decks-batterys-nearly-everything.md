How much for that?
What is missing to complete the build? Just a remote?

How heavily battery was used? Still charges to full?
Also, can a battery lid be bought separately from the deck? If yes, how much for battery lid alone?
```

It only does include the complete Hardwear you can see on the picture and a battery 

You would need vesc, remote, higher risers, fixe the enclosure properly, charger and anti spark
 
300E should be correct
