Okay so technically not Used parts here (They are brand new). But listing them at Used Prices. 

We finally got these bad boys in and wanted to throw them up on here while we are running our sale, so everyone on here that‚Äôs needs a few pulleys can pick some up and save a few bucks. We really want to shoot for low prices. Pulleys seem to be a little more expensive than they need to be. 

Finally got our Aluminum 36T 15mm Wide Orangatang Wheel Pulleys in. Nothing you guys haven‚Äôt seen before, but we feel like the price is much better than typically seen. 

For $30 you‚Äôll get the following:
- 36T Wheel Hub
- Wheel Retainer
- 5 M4x55 Bolts
- 16T 8mm Bore Motor Pulley W/ Set Screws
- 265mm Belt

IN STOCK AND SHIPS IMMEDIATELY 

Again nothing new about this product except for the price. 


You can get them here:

How about selling just the wheel pulleys separately? A lot of us are flush with belts and motor pulleys already, or don't need/want to run that motor pulley/belt combo.

I don‚Äôt think so, imo a aluminum pulley is a aluminum pulley, but I could be wrong
