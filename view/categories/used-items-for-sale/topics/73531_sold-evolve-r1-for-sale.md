Evolve R1 for sale 

Remote is used and has some wear that I tried to capture in pics. Seems to work fine, but I used it for a few weeks last summer while waiting for my R2 fix and there was one time where the screen got all pixalated and weird. Turned it off then back on, no issues since. Selling as is.

$50 shipped and paypal'd anywhere in the continental US.  No international shipping.![IMG_0743|375x500](upload://8u77Co1BsbEnM2DS3G1JTkDCn48.jpeg) ![IMG_0744|375x500](upload://6wkoXc47fZTgjqiOaohrcmJX0RP.jpeg) ![IMG_0745|375x500](upload://1dKmlpAcKFFgEl9G0wY6sy0d2VU.jpeg)
