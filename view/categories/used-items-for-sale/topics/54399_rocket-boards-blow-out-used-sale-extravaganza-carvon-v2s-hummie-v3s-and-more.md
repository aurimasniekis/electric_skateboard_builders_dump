I need to clear out space and pull some extra $$$ together, so clearing out old parts that I don't need anymore. Here's a listing of all of the parts I no longer need:

**PLEASE NOTE: Prices do not include shipping. Items are also sold in "as in" condition. Guaranteed to be working on delivery, but come with no warranty..**

Hummie v3's dual drive with front truck and wheels - $350
These are a rare posting. prototype motors, these are a rock solid design. However, we don't have good wheels for these and no plans to make wheels for these ever (v4 has new wheel locking pattern). So this would be great for someone who wants to play with pouring their own wheels! Includes 2x PC-ABS cores that wheels can be poured around, as well as 2 used wheels. These wheels had core failures. They don't slip, but they have "play" i.e. undesired movement. Two of these sets are for sale! Includes the 3d wheel design!

Enertion Single Drive Train with trucks and wheels - $200
This is a limited edition gold enertion motor mount, with enertion wheels, enertion r-spec 2 motor, enertion trucks, and standard bearings. Includes 4x wheels with bearings, 2x trucks, 1x mono drive fully assembled. Just needs battery, esc, and deck!



Enertion Vesc 4.12 - $60
Freshly repaired by the wizard. Includes caps, no phase wires or power wires.

Enertion Spare Wheels - 4x enertion 83mm wheels - $20
In new condition, these wheels have no use.

Enertion motor mount with stuck motor - $10
I have a motor mount with a motor that is stuck can get pulley off or screws. It's possible to get off, just will take some work. Includes screws, wheel pully, motor mount, and motor mount plate.

![IMG_1248|375x500](upload://83sbJglMHXkLDoxQoPUvmQGJldR.jpg)

Burnt out r-spec 2 motor - $20
Great for someone looking to rewind a motor and get a great price. These motors have a fair amount of power, just needs a rewind.

![IMG_1250|375x500](upload://oLo2BL6OShGZ8BCYu3SBqtvw28Y.jpg)

Enertion dual drive carbon fiber bash plate - $10
This plate is meant to be used on a dual drive old enertion motor mount system. If someone needs a replacement, this is probably your only chance ever again.

The motor btw is blown out and not a very good one. But the mount is good if you can get the plate off.

Gotta couple of questions, hope you don't mind

The prototype v3s, which is the later of the two sets left? What were the changes? 

How used are each set?

Are they the prior design which can short a phase?

What size wheel?

Any pics of the front truck showing the front truck & wheels?
```

[/quote]

Both of these sets were done together. It was used in my 4wd testing board I use in the performance day 2 race and I rode them for 6 months.

The changes are the follow:

v4:
Open the motors via a C clip
Square grooves for the wheel locking
Reverse thread self locking nut holds the motor on

v3:
Threaded ring to open motor
Round grooves for the wheel locking
Red locktite holds the motor to the 12mm shaft

[quote="banjaxxed, post:17, topic:54399"]

[/quote]

About 200 miles, fronts wheels and trucks would be new.

[quote="banjaxxed, post:17, topic:54399"]
Are they the prior design which can short a phase?
[/quote]

No, there's nothing "wrong" with this design. It's just much harder to take the motor apart since there's more red locktite holding things together. The new motors are breeze to open.

It really shouldn't matter since you should have to ever open them.

[quote="banjaxxed, post:17, topic:54399"]
What size wheel?
[/quote]

83mm x 78mm

I can, give me a minute.
