Not sure what they are worth.
Kinda old buy they don't seem brittle or cracked.

$20+shipping?  OBO & open to trades
I think I can probably fit them in a large flat rate box. So shipping should be about $18.

If they fit MBS Rockstar 2 hubs, I would be interested in tyres and tubes only. But I'm in Iceland :man_shrugging:

Feel free to walk up the price guys.
12$ would be better than 10$ in my book, Maybe write in the PM title how much you offering.
