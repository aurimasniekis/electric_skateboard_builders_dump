Up for grabs are a few parts which I will most probably add to. 
1. Evo shaped deck, Urban hybrid speedboard. Itâ€™s similar but not the same as  the evo. In so much it wonâ€™t immediately fit my evo enclosure without some fiddling. Looks like itâ€™s got some fibre coverage on the underside. 
Â£50+ postage.

Loaded Tesseract deck with colour coded enclosure fitted to it with fixings and rubber gasket. 
Could do with the top of the inserts grinding down and re grip taping. The nose of this deck has been cut down but still retains the usable tail. Â£150![image|666x500](upload://pIK18tHtU1OoInSbJElW3aOn3x6.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://4vCz9ArQ0efRMVpAnr29izZgb1E.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://5bFnFrkvFA4ZZVgaIvmSa3IB3G3.jpeg)

Any questions ask away. 
Iâ€™m considering selling my evo build but perhaps this isnâ€™t the place. 
(So many boards)

Do you know how much postage would be on the trampa to uk? otherwise where are you based if someone wanted to collect?

@ducktaperules I can check but by the looks of it parcelforce express 48 would take it for about Â£12?
Iâ€™m in Dorset, and am visiting London on Monday for work. Iâ€™m going to try and make it to the velodrome in Bournemouth for something slick revolution are doing this Sunday.  
I get around the country quite a bit otherwise.

Hey, would you ship to United States (California), and what would be the shipping cost? I just created an account so I think I can't send direct messages. Can you DM me?

Say Ben just to ask, would it be possible to remould an EVO enclosure to that deck at the top or is that a buyer thing?

Maybe if you took a pic with a spare enclosure to see if seal by itself could do it or a bit of hot air gun, just to get the buyers syndrome flowing ðŸ˜µ

I think it would be doable, I'll see what I can do. I have a dodgy blue translucent enclosure that could be sacrificed..

Internally it is 450mm x 145mm x 25mm. 
Should be good for a 10s3p.
I do a deeper enclosure (37mm) that can take a double stack but without the paint job.

Awesome work with the tesseract! Iâ€™m planning a loaded basalt tesseract build, would you be able to make an enclosure for that which is similar to what you did to this one?
