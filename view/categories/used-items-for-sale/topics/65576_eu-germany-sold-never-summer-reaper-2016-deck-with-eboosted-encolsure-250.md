**Price €250** + shipping
Total cost new was around €320.  

Have for sale a Never Summer Reaper 2016 deck with a eBoosted enclosure made specially to fit the shape and lines of the 2016 Reaper.  In _almost_ as good as new condition.

Only damage to the board is 4 threaded inserts have been screwed in to attach the enclosure. Although If you're going to be using it as an eskate then I wouldn't really consider that damage.
Have also attached a rubber gasket around the bottom for the enclosure to rest on to provide some protection.  Can be removed with no damage to the board.
Board was never actually ridden, only built up then everything was replaced.

Enclosure has 4 holes drilled for bolts to attach to the deck and a hole on one side for a power switch and a hole on the other side for a charging port. There is also a small chip by the charge port that you can't see from drilling the hole.

It is a good looking deck. If I wasn't worried about it sticking out too much and drawing attention I would keep it.

Posted from the UK prices start from about £30 for a 1m long 4kg parcel. Perhaps there's a German equivalent service??
