I used Kevin darks format adding fibreglass reinforcement to parralel groups and fishpaper series insulation and balance tab insulation. Flexible connections with kapton over the ends to ensure balance cables aren't rubbed. Neoprene padding under the BMS (safe to 260C) and some thick heatshrink which is so sturdy you could almost make a compression pack with it. Not yet compressed. Oh and electrical tape across the middle for structure. I used a sunko spot welder

I'm selling up because I was hoping to replace a bus pass with these parts. Half new half used and almost made a £300 20 mile folder commuter. But with the charger breaking ruining my chances of my own compact battery I'm giving up the ghost

how does a 10S3P pack fit on a penny board?
Should have been an amazing ride.

Just get a 30€ charger instead of giving in and losing on the sale. 10S chargers can be had even cheaper than that when you're fine with low amps.

No I need a 4.2V charger to give the BMS a little push start. I didn't ride it on the penny haha thought that would just look funny plus it's easier to store. The vesc's and battery are new but tested

Sent you a PM @Newby regarding some stuff :) I have to admit its a bit sad that you're giving up, so close.

## \#11 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2018-09-13T11:39:22.606Z Reads: 165

```
why do you need a 4.2V charger? The BMS takes 42V and takes care of the difference between packs by itself. You could even hook it up to 42V without the BMS if you wanted to to - BMSs are nice to have but not crucial. you're using quality cells so don't worry.

And while we're at it: 0.1V is not much - just ignore it and charge the pack to full voltage.

I am trying to prevent you from a stupid mistake that you'll regret later on. You are so close!

Yeah I agree your giving up early, but if you need the money... Then you need the money

Maybe I can rent the spot welder? I just want to complete my battery asap and then complete my spot welder later. Just want a working board now :joy:

## \#16 Posted by: Newby Posted at: 2018-09-13T11:50:34.943Z Reads: 150

```
When the cells close to a 0.05V gap it gets warm meaning in balance. And it's dangerous to run a battery like that as it can't be left to charge overnight etc. I guess the BMS would stop charging because it can detect overcharge so I would still get 99% capacity, but it is not my time yet. This isn't my final attempt, I will be back with an 11s2p 8ah 20700 pack and 6355 jet spud or similar. But it is not my time. I appreciate all the help guys but for now this is a money thing. I'll still be on the forums though

0.05V is nothing and the balancing only starts at the end of the charge. So once you are at the balancing stage and have only 0.05V diffeence between packs that would mean your pack is full. Just ride it then!

Yeah it's at the balance stage 8 groups are at 4.2V and the rest are sitting at 4.1V. I'm not losing out by selling this it's just wasted time although I still learnt a lot (before building obviously).To anyone in the UK this pack is literally a full pack at parts price

Hey man i'm a bit lost with all your stuff here but anyways,

How much for the penny? 
I.e Board, trucks, wheels, single drive setup + extra belts, vesc, bluetooth module, remote, essentially a full setup minus the battery. 

Cheers

Heading off Saturday. The eBay seller has only offered a half refund which is ridiculous but I can keep it so fair. Ill set up a renter rota with you first. £15 for 2 weeks? Check you can actually draw 20 amp through your breakers though it might not even work

Fairs. Most of the time in the 40 amp setting it worked for me. But it would trip the breakers sometimes turning on, although more when turning off which was odd. And like once while using it

Bestech BMS 80A 10s still available? What are the exact specs on overcharge and overdischarge protection?

What kind of Flipsky Vesc is it and is it still available?

I might also be interested in some of the smaller items!

## \#40 Posted by: Newby Posted at: 2018-09-26T17:40:01.000Z Reads: 85

It's the classic flipsky vesc 4.2. If you look at the polls it's one of the more reliable ones. Especially for the price. 
Bestech share a lot of the same values.
I have just realised it said 80 I will change that soon. It's a 60 amp

hmm oke but do you have the specifics on the BMS? As I want to keep the option to use LiPos open, I prefer a BMS with overdischarge protection at 3V. Also, I have seen people buy a Bestech BMS (80a) for 69-70 euros (shipping included) so 67 euros (60 pounds) is a bit much maybe?

How much is shipping (tracked) to the Netherlands?

No litech power don't ask about the adjustables sorry. Beware to anyone who orders from them. The vesc is a safe way to protect from over voltage still?
