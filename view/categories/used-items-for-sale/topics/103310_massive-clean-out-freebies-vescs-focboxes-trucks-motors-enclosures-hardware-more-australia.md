Hey all.

I was very into diy esk8 a while back, but i've since lost interest (mostly due to time :frowning:). I'm happy with my production board so I'm selling off all of my parts. Please see the photos a list of items below. There's also a bunch of freebies down the bottom :slight_smile: 

I know i'm a new member, so feel free to ask and i'll be happy to send you a photo of the item with your username + date. I'll accept paypal payments + Australian bank transfer (or Payid). I'm also happy to meet up in Sydney.

I will post in Australia with Sendle (cheaper) or Auspost. Will also post worldwide if you'd like ([calculate pricing here](https://auspost.com.au/parcels-mail/calculate-postage-delivery-times/#/), select send from Sydney NSW 2000, standard or higher (economy has no tracking)).
Pricing is in AUD

Feel free to make offers on anything, I may have priced things high since I haven't been in the game for a while.

I've also got a bunch more stuff to list as I go through it + a complete diy board to sell.

They are just 3 screws. The only thing you renove is the housing, nothing to worry about. For some people its rather important if they buy 1.6 or 1.7 etc focboxes.

## \#8 Posted by: xsynatic Posted at: 2019-10-26T12:08:23.867Z Reads: 207

I'm no expert but i think it was the Canbus protection. If you have 2x 1.6 focboxes connected via can and the cable disconnects while driving it blows up the CAN Port? (correct me if i'm wrong) the 1.7 had a protection against it. If you drive single it shouldn't be a problem. Not sure if there are any other changes.

Really? Would you pinky swear on that?

I am hopeful that I can negotiate a little, I am already lucky Brian canâ€™t swoop in, or can he?

@exantra providing those are v1.7 and you are open to discussion on the price Iâ€™d like to make an offer. Otherwise, no harm done and good luck in tourney sale.

[/quote]

If the can bus cable becomes disconnected while both vescs are powered up the canbus chip on the connected one will blow.  If like me you disconnected the power to one while the can bus was still connected then both chips are fried.  1.7 was supposed to fix this but I have never been game enough to try it.  When you are talking about disconnecting the gnd I think you mean split ppm where you only use the signal cable for one leg but according to trampa this will create a ground loop and cause your board to implode and create a singularity and destroy the galaxy.

All mine run split ppm and have done for years so that is simply not the case.

I actually use superglue.  It aint ever coming out.

The good news is though you can just snip off the can bus chips and run them split ppm.  Don't be like me though and drawer one because you didn't get a light on throttle input only to realise a couple of weeks later that it was still programmed as a slave.  I am a slow learner

why do you have to snip the canbus chips off?? surely split ppm just works without doing that...
