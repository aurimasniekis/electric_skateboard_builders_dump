This is a genuine Imax b6 V2 charger that works great other than that is does not charge 6s due to the they 6s balance ports were shorted out. $30

2x 3s batteries 5000mah and 20c I have not used these batteries at all the only thing that i have changed is that I put XT90 connectors. $45

The adaptor is brand new never used but I will only ship it with one of  the other products. $3

I also have a brand new never used Miami Electric Boards 6s adaptor to VGA.( will post pic soon)$10

I went to eBay and typed in the name of the charger and scrolling through it I found that the lowest was $47 but if you can find it for $30 I will gladly drop my price on the charger. Also it just does not charge 6s. It is not completely broken.
