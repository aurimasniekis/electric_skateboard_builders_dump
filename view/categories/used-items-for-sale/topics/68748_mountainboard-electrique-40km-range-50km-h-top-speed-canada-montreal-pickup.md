Hello,

I sell my DIY electric mountainboard.
The base of the setup is a Trampa Holypron 35 board with Vertigo trucks and HYPA hubs.
There are Trampa bindings and off-road tires.
for the mechanical and electronic part:
- 2 * motor mount in marine grade aluminum painted in black with extremely resistant nylon printed parts + rods to maintain rigidity in shocks and all terrain
- 2 * 450mm HTD 5m Belts with spares
- 2 * 190kv motors / 3500w
- 2 sets of 10S LIPO type batteries in perfect condition, 8000mAh give 20km range per set and it takes 30 seconds to switch
- a waterproof box with battery controllers that gives voltage / cell + percentage remaining
- 2 * FOCBOX ESCs speed controllers in a custom enclosure with heat sinks custom + Bluetooth module + quick access to USB withtout having to open the enclosure!!!
- an XT90s key to avoid sparks during connections
