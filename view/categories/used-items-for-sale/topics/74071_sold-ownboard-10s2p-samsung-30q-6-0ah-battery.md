Ownboard 10s2p Samsung 30Q 6.0aH battery for sale, under 15 charge cycles.
Upgrading to a beefier battery for my DIY build, but this would be a perfect upgrade for anyone with standard Meepo/Ownboard/Wowgo/Riptide batteries.
For context, I'm 180lbs and get about 8 mile range if I'm on full throttle the whole time and about 12-14 miles if I'm riding more gently at around 15mph.
Comes with 10S 2A charger as well.
$140 shipped!
