These are some items I have on my workbench from previous builds. All parts are working and in good condition. Items will be shipped in USPS Flat Rate boxes so shipping will be $9. US shipping only.

Two 4.12 VESC. Both were used in a dual build and replaced with FOCBOX for running FOC. 
Ollin Vesc with no faults or issues. $200 for pair or $120 each.

Lipos have only had 3 charge cycles. If you get the batteries and vesc I'll cover shipping.
