Made a 10s4p Samsung 30q's for my evolve GTX upgrade. Then started my own build 12s5p. Has a 45A discharge BMS. And xt 90 connectors. I will shorten wires and add the shrink tubes today. Lol. Was just testing it. Can be used for any liion purpose I suppose it's 36.61 volts at checküëç.  I'll off it for $325. That's a good deal. If certain wire length or connector are needed please let me know prior to shipping so I can unsolder and attach correct/needed connector ports. ![20190919_064448_HDR|690x388](upload://kFn8XkvzCFLKA7ezFYWLzw5QZ8L.jpeg)

Yeah actually. Lol. Documented the whole build. Wires were cut short to length prior to shrinkwrap of course though Lol. I may just finish GTX upgrade and sell whole if no one wants it. If be happy to Skype or whatever and do meter test and such.  ![Message_1567086651472|374x499](upload://fNiOI6WPO3JlxoIhQfC1LnVjeck.jpeg) ![20190829_192239_HDR|375x500](upload://2uhL533GpjIKL3TMnLTh0euqYeH.jpeg) ![20190829_213510_HDR|374x499](upload://spx5hOyJQIoTaDqvpz6x8fyQdhd.jpeg) ![20190829_213547_HDR|375x500](upload://wPPsm6TxyyTrxSqj9ZCHeIejnxs.jpeg)
