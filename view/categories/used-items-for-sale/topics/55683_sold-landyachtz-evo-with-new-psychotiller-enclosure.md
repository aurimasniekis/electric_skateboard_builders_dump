You think 12s4p with the N.E.S.E. cases would fit in there??

What’s the length and width? Height wise it would fit fine. I can measure the enclosure tomorrow night.

I'll have to measure it all out, I have his enclosure for the shuggah deck and its all just barely fits in there.

I think that one is about 23 inches long...maybe a bit longer

You wouldn't want to trade for a basically new loaded tesseract would you?  Mine is in the same condition as yours. Mounted stuff but nothing else on it ever.... ![image|374x500](upload://dF6Pa0BQVpfZ71RF70vJWQUCN6m.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://nPu9JyHL05qUhp2saOnp4fNpNdq.jpeg)
