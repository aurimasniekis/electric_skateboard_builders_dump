Hello everyone, I'm hoping to sell my Ninebot One C+ 

Its in pretty solid condition, I last rode it January and its been sitting in my closet at 75% charge for a few months now.

some of the notable damage would be the little tear in the leg padding on the front left leg pad (zoomed in pic -> 
![20190518_072427|243x500](upload://nYR00JSqFOgRduEakRHB1bflfkG.jpeg)  ), as well as the scrapes on the 'pedals' and outer white shell (you can see those already :P ) 


Most parts are replaceable, and can be purchased directly from ninebot here: https://www.ninebotus.com/parts-ninebot-one/ 


Im hoping to get $250 + shipping from this, so the total for the buyer *should* ( shipping is stupid) be paying less than $300 usd total


E: Here is the invoice I got when purchasing, to be 100% transparent ![image|690x453](upload://2YX7k28VGElmvbO0C6inSXYYhkN.png)

I got a spare ps4 slim. I never really thought about getting a unicycle but hell if you wanna trade I‚Äôm not using the ps4 so I‚Äôll trade you. 
If not no biggie just read this and thought I‚Äôd throw it out there.

Man I upgraded to a pro and sold it after a month while it was still worth something.
Was not impressed with the "upgrade"
Stuck with my special addition ps4.
The xb1 to xb1x upgrade was much more noticeable.
