Hey guys,  purchased earlier in the year for my first build. It actually took quite a while to find it as they don't make this version anymore. Well regarded design with a great "locked in" feeling concave. 

Selling since I've decided move forward with a kicktail based deck instead. Plenty of room for a spacecell and dual motors in a 34" deck!

Very light use (see photos for small marks). $130AUD. shipped.

That's what I thought. Stay local and get a new one. It is a fantastic deck. I might end out keeping it if it doesn't move soon.
