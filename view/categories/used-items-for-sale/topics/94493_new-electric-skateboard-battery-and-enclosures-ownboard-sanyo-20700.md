You are paying premium for lifetime, those 21700's will get far more lifetime than the 25R's will

No. You are paying a premium to ship parts direct from China. If you think there is a significant lifetime difference between cells with the same chemistry, but different housing size, maybe read some more. There may be a minimal lifetime difference, but it is definitely not significant enough to pay more for less output. http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/165/14/A3284.full
