All items have never been used. I was going to build an electric skateboard, but due to waiting for a part for longer than expected and an unexpected work assignment that is taking me out of the country for a year I figured it'd be best if someone else used these parts. I didn't want them to sit around for that long (especially the battery):

Again all items have never been used

_Vedder's Speed Controller (includes Heat Sink Package)_
_With 4mm Bullet Connectors Motor Side/XT-With 90 Anti Spark Battery side -  $175_
_(Has a warranty of a year and a half still)_ - **sold**

Ollin Motor (OM5065-200kv) - $74

_space cell pro3_ - $300 - **sold**

I'll free ship if everything is bought together. If not we can discuss shipping costs.

Nice. I just need the vesc to get my board back up and running. Let me know the shipping and out the door price. Is Paypal fine with you?

Just a heads up- depending on vendors sometimes warranties don't travel when sold to a new owner

I think Ollin is special in this department, but maybe @chaka can chime in to confirm.

Ollin's support team responded they are going to uphold the warranty and let me transfer it to the new owners. What a great company.

Nice! There's a reason why they have built such a solid reputation.

Only the Ollin Motor remains if anyone is looking for a solid motor that has never been used.
