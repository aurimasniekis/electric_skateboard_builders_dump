Selling my super reliable Turnigy k force esc never had any issues with it. Its not the prettiest as I had it superglued to the bottom of my deck so the plastic plate on the bottom is a little broken. The main battery leads I will switch out before its sold as they have been cut and re soldered a few times. Ill throw in a AAtransmitter power pack if you don't have a BEC to use with it. It has programable throttle and brake settings I'm looking to sell it for 100cad.
