Yep 90mm Premium Abec flywheel clones 73A (Only been on the road once)

And no clue I paid 50 euro for them so 30 I think sounds fair but keeping them a little until i know if i can get more sold else i smack them on the trucks and a deck.

If the pack has not been sold before Friday next week i will have to take it apart and try to reuse the sells, so someone take it of my hands for 200 now.

And before we waste each others time make sure you have a validated paypal adresse when you contact me and its the one i need to ship to else i simply wont ship it or accept the offer.
