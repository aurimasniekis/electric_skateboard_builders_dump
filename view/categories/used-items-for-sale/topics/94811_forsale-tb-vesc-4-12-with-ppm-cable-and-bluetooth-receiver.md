If someone wants to make a dual, I have one with a busted programing port I'll let go for $50 shipped OBO.  It still runs fine and only has a few miles on it

The ones I purchased for $50 have lasted me hundreds of miles and been completely reliable. Not trying to give you a hard time, just saying that you may need to lower your price to sell it
