I’m selling my build to fund a couple of projects. Everything has been ridden for about 50-75 miles. The projected top speed is 25-30mph and the projected range is about 20-30miles.(Those answers are straight from TB) Here is what I have.

TB Pro1 Kit (this is what comes in the kit)
-TB Vesc
- TB 6355 190kv Motor
-TB Upgraded 12s4p 30q Battery
- TB Inwards Facing Mount
-Clear Blue Flywheel Clones (83mm)
-16/36 gear ratio
- 12mm Belt
-180mm TB v2 Trucks
-TB 12s4p Battery Enclosure

These are all on a Jet Potato 35.5 Deck

I also have 3x 4s 5500mah Lipos for sale if anyone wants them (contact me separately)

I would like to get around $750 for it. If multiple people want parts from it then I will end up selling the parts.

How much for just the power train (battery/ESC/motor/pulleys/belts) Without the deck/remote/enclosure/mounts/trucks/wheels?  Maybe $200ish

You can keep it as a push board with a cargo hold

I can vouch for you because I've personally done it. I've never run single accept for when one of my TB 6355's shit out on me on my way home. I just unlpugged it and went on my way. Granted it takes twice as long to get to that speed and the brakes suck. ;)

Thanks @SeanHacker ! It means a lot. Still hoping someone will buy it though so that I can fund my next build...

Man this seems like a great deal, but being such a basic complete, I feel like most people would rather spend a little more and build something exactly how they want it. That's why people probably aren't biting :/

If you part out, I would buy the motor mount. Or I could trade you a reverse motor mount from Torque Boards if you wanted it.

The problem is you're trying to get $750 for a deck and a $730 TorqueBoards kit. It looks like your first build that you've only bothered to keep for more than 50 miles and most people on this forum would rather buy parts to build something for themselves. I'm not trying to offend but that's what this seems like to me.

Misunderstanding, it has a 12s4p which is another $200 which makes the kit itself worth $944 plus the fast charger. And then a $100 Deck
