Selling my first E-board set up with 5060-300kv motor.  I used an RC esc but need it for an RC project (I would go with a VESC controller anyway, the best!).  The ratio is 3.33:1 (40T drive 12T pinion).  This yielded a good balance of top speed and acceleration on 6S.  I'm including Nunchuck, Wiiceiver, 2 Green Abec 83mm clone wheels, ABS 3D printed battery enclosure, 9mm belt, 3D printed Nylon drive gear, 3D printed Poly-carbonate motor mount (this is a freebie, you'll need to make a solid interface for truck mount.  I used structural adhesive, it worked OK but a metal mount interface is ideal).  Hit me up, let me know if you have questions.
