Hi Everyone,

im selling my Trampa 35 Holey Pro Deck 16ply deck with Trampa Ratchet Mountainboard Bindings.

Thew reason why im doing it is due to having a hummie deck so this one will not be in use anymore.
Binding have been used only for 1 days and thats it.

Price (deck + bindings): 230EU
Shipping from: Croatia
