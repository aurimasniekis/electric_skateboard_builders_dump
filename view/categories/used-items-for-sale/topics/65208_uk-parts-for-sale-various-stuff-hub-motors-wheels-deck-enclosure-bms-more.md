Ok no worries.  Could take the kegels but they would need to be a fair bit cheaper than that.  Won't insult you with an offer that is lower than you want so I will leave you to try and sell and if you can't shout me back with a better price

Yo hit me a message if the x2 drive is not taken, I'm interested in rear trucks + tb baseplate and front truck, won't take the battery case :wink:

Would you let them go tor 50Â£ +shipping to France? Or just the rear truck with tb baseplate for say 35-40Â£ +shipping?

I wanna do a stealth build with them! :beers: Got spare parts to complete it and couple VESCs ready to roll.
