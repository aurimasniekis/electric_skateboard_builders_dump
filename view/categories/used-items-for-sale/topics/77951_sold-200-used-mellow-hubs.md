Update: SOLD! 


Selling these Mellow hubs. I had plans for building something small and easy to carry around for short trips, or possibly something to travel with (they are very light weight).

Located in NYC

Not interested in the hubs, but I'd love to see the insides if you've taken them apart before. I'd assume most people wouldn't want to mess with a mellow just because of the price point, but since you've already gone all the way.. ðŸ˜‚

Has anyone ever posted a mellow teardown? All I've heard is that they're good and have fancy German engineering, but I've never seen the inside ðŸ¤”

The braking resistor is somewhere in a box of parts that I'd have to dump out to locate. (I won't).
