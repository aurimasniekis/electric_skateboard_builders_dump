You've joined 10 days ago and your first post is selling a board with bad spelling and grammar. 

Seems fishy to me.

Seems a little rude...  all they are saying is that if you are going to sell a "working" board tben you should show videos of it working.  Who would spend any money on something without any proof...... wait, do you have a relative Prince from Nigeria?

Am just going to call bs on his 4 3s pack of lipos getting 30 miles, I've gone thru several lipos before going 18650 cells and let me tell you  2 6s 6000mah 35c  graphene batteries  on dual 6355 motors only got me 15 miles. Second you don't state any information of the build. How long ago was it bought? How many miles?Does it have a BMS ? Picture of inside the enclosure ? You can't just jump into a community and jump in fishy and wonder why were being rude we were not born yesterday to just start learning about esk8.

This whole thing is fishy, and the rude demeanor doesn't help. Videos would be nice, better pictures are a must, and a range test is advisable. Honestly, with lipos I'd estimate the best you'll get for this is probably around 600$. The thing about DIY builds is that while they are expensive for the builder and perform better for that individual than a market board, it's not worth much to the next guy who wants to take certain parts and make it his own.

Why did you just post order confirmations when people are asking for pictures of inside the enclosure?
