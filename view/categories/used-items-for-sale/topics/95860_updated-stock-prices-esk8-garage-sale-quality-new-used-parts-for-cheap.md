UPDATE: Check my latest post in the thread to see the items that are still available.

US shipping included in prices.  DM for additional international shipping cost.  I will take offers if they are reasonable.  If you want multiple items, I can reduce the price.  paypal.me/MorganKuphal

I am also selling 2 brand new 190KV motors that I have on order in a group buy. $100 each & I paid $110 each. More info on those here:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/selling-2x-6374-190-kv-motors-for-110-each-from-group-buy/95336

I am also selling my vac forming molds for my enclosures: double stack LY 38 Switchblade, single stack flat enclosure, double stack concave enclosure & double stack flat & short enclosure.  DM if you are interested.  They are really nice but I just don't need them anymore.

![IMG_0064|500x500](upload://rPvKhm2ylAXrep3xD9eTzJawKyi.jpeg)

The price is pretty firm on these unless they don't sell within the next 3 weeks 

EDIT: Screw it, I'll take offers on these too! All they are doing is taking up space anyway and I'd rather see them be used than get dusty.

![IMG_0069|500x500](upload://olngWSfYjQRlJErCUFBtR1GWexY.jpeg) 

190KV motor is sold!


UPDATE: I'll take $15 each on both of the remaining motors. The 6355 260KV is super easy to fix, you just need to put two 10mm long m4 grub screws in the back and it is ready to roll!

 ![IMG_0076|375x500](upload://7KmGrZysW6yYaT0v2JJVT7uxRCy.jpeg)

All 37T wheel pulleys are sold! 42T pulley & both motor pulleys are still available!

 ![IMG_0074|500x500](upload://c1hRwhrhZRTwSwh8SONvcRu8kZs.jpeg) ![IMG_0077|640x480](upload://t2srvYUd8msBX9jrpDLpWXcGscs.jpeg)  

Only the 320mm belts have been paid for so far!

![IMG_0072|500x500](upload://7uxJ6kmxm8bpDxmGMA8VOTHjiS5.jpeg)![IMG_0080|375x500](upload://sRrf0HPHhrGoPcxqnPuqIA6JX0V.jpeg)![IMG_0082|500x500](upload://6OIyCSsRpq95LuUYZFUdHbm5D1w.jpeg)

I'll actually just take $10 for the speaker.  It works great!

$10 total including shipping for the short double stack. lol its less than I paid for the plastic to make it but I value a clean closet more than money at this point.

I can't bring myself to throw it away so I might as well sell it cheap!

I am not gonna hold anything unfortunately. First person to pay gets it.  That's partly the reason the prices are so cheap so its more convenient for me.  Hell, its only $10 which is about as much as it costs me to ship them to you so they are basically free.

As promised, here are the pictures of the vac forming enclosure molds.

I will sell these two for $50 each.  Its not a crazy good deal or anything, but if I can't get $50 each then I'll probably just keep them. Shipping is NOT included because shipping rates vary greatly depending on the location since they are heavier.

Concave Molds (Made on a Bustin Robot 41" Deck)

Here are the other 2 molds.  I'll take $40 each for these not including shipping.  They are cheaper to ship since they are lighter though.

Also, you will have to wait a week for me to ship the long single stack enclosure since I need to make 1 more enclosure for someone.

and a couple pulleys and belts once I figure out my ratio

5055 is sensorless?

abec pulleys fit the wheels?

wheels are clones?

Just to know why the tape on the mold? To make it was to release it afterwards? At what temp do you heat it up the ABS before forming? Sorry for the off topic but since you have experience in that. Plus maybe useful of someone wants to take the molds.

ok thanks a lot for the info. Yeh I was surprise that you get it smooth although you have holes along the molds. Probably is due to the thickness of the ABS and you get a bit of signs only on the inner side.

well these are what I bought & I bought 2 different sized pulleys as well (as shown in the pic in my first post)  https://www.janux-esk8.com/product-page/6-x2-pneumatic-tires-and-hubs

They fit the 6"x2" tires which I think are the most common ones used on the forum.  Same tires and tubes as psychotiller's aluminum  6 shooters
