Hello everyone,

I'm selling a complete build that I built about a year ago.
I've had a lot of fun riding this build. I used it for my daily commute within Manhattan, and as a 200+ lb rider, I had no problems with it as long as I gave a gentle kickpush at standstill.
I've never had a chance to ride from full to empty, but from rough calculations based on my commute, I would estimate the range to be about 8 miles, going around 15-17 mph for a 200 lb rider.

The specification is as follows:

Jet Potato 33"
CarvON V2.5 Single Hub Motor
VESC (I will find out which version it is, but I think its 4.18)
Miami Electric Boards 12S2P Stealth Battery
Miami Electric Boards Electric Remote
Khiro 1/4" Shock Pad Risers
metr.at transmitter (rpasichnyk's product: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/configuration-and-telemetry-for-vesc-ios-android/13483)

I understand that people here are mostly builders so complete build sales aren't very popular, but if possible I'd like to sell it as a whole. If I don't find any buyers then I'll sell by parts.

Looking to sell it for $600 plus shipping.
FYI, I live in New Jersey, USA

I will post pictures during the weekend.

EDIT: Decided to sell by parts. Part prices below.

The wheels are 90mm, 78A Durometer.
The batteries should be 18650. I can confirm over the weekend.

Your VeSC is not 4.18 as that does not exists. It's probably between 4.10-4.12

If you do split it and the deck is in good condition, I'll take it.

I'd be interested in your battery depending on its specs.  I know he's making those out of 30Qs at this point.  Does it have a connected battery meter and/or on/off switch?

PXSS, you are right, it definitely not 4.18. Upon confirmation, its VESC 4.12.

Additional info:
The case is Psychotiller's The Coupe (one of the earlier version)
Power button and battery meter.
Charging port is on the side of the case and I also have the charger as well. I'd say charging takes about hour to hour and half.
Battery is Miami Electric Board's earlier version, which uses 18650 cells.

Super sorry,

I just didn't have time to get back on this forum to respond.
I still haven't sold the entire build yet so I guess I'll sell everything by parts.

Jet Potato 33" - **$60**
CarvON V2.5 Single Hub Motor w/ matching front wheels - **$175 or best offer**
VESC (4.12) w/ battery meter - **$100 or best offer**
Miami Electric Boards 12S2P Stealth Battery w/ BMS & power switch & meter - **$200 or best offer**
Miami Electric Boards Electric Remote w/ receiver - **$20**
Khiro 1/4" Shock Pad Risers - **Will throw it in with any purchaser that wants it. first come, first serve**
metr.at transmitter - **$15**


Again the prices above are without shipping costs. So shipping cost will be added. And I guess I'd prefer local trade, anywhere around Northeast New Jersey and Manhattan area.
