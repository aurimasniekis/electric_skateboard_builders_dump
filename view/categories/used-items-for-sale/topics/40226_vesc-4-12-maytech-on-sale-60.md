I have couple vesc pretty well used, from Maytech, with more than 1000km on my commuter skate and they run like the first day, with 0 problems. Please keep it in bldc, don't play foc and they will last a lot.
Im asking for 60€ each, because of shipping cost mostly for EU peeps.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/c/ecd1f4b38ac2a49b7a60760f4c4c6ddeda86b69f.jpg" width="690" height="345">

You gotta post photos. The other thing is not many here recommend the Maytech VESC so it will be hard to find a buyer.
