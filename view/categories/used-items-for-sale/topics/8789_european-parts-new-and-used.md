GHey Europe,

I have bit to many parts and thought maybe someone would like to try  merchandise from the states so I have some new and lightly used parts for sale here in Europe (read- cheaper shipping and no import tax)
Everything is new unless otherwise stated.
I'll add to the list as I have time.....first up

CarvOn V2 Dual Black hubs with Ceramic bearing

These come with near mint ABEC 90mm 81a compound Flywheels AND a set of 97mm flywheel clones. I have yet to mount these and was thinking of trying my hand at re-wiring to make V2.5s per Nordles recommendations. I'm looking to break even as these were purchased on this forum from other reliable dudes............

BThe Bubblegum drive has a 265kV 5055 motor that was made to be paired with the battery which was also old bubblegum board stock. The mount is welded onto a Paris 195 truck with two black ABEC 83mm clones, 9 mm belt with printed belt guard and both pulleys mounted.

I have two of theses welded trucks - the other has been stripped of the motor but I still have the printed belt guard, pulley, and sprockets....the idea was that dual diagonal motors which would be a pretty beastly ride....

If someone wanted A dual diagonal drive board I would sell the bubblegum drive, two batteries and throw in the complete other truck and mounting gear (Everything but the motor) and the set of white wheels for 400 euros.

( that's basically a complete dual setup minus 2x esc, a remote, board and a motor for 400 Euros, wheels and extra truck and mount for 25 euros!!!!!)

Otherwise the unbuilt truck and mount by themselves are 75.

As for Hummies Hubs they are 80 kV I  believe ( that's what I requested from him, they haven't been used so I haven't confirmed) if not then they would be 90kV. They mount with heat resistant epoxy to the trucks...specifically longer spindled trucks like the Arsenals I have ordered, if you'd like I could throw in a set for 80 euros. Basically you carefully coat the threads of the hanger, and pour a little into receiving threads of the strator ( motor) and let them cure. Read about me in Hummies threads.

All this stuff is at cost, I make no money with any of these deals......just trying to liquidate some assets and provide goods to the euro peeps.

I'm I'd say 30-40 euros- make it a flat 35........
The extra welded motor mount and truck is 75 if you aren't grabbing the batteries........but I'll drop it to 60 if you get the drive setup.

All told 
Set of welded 195 Paris truck with welded mount and one complete drive and one partial with shipping

175+
60+
35
=
270 euros

The battery is never used: here are the specs

Li-ion battery
7s2p- 9000 Ah, 25.9 V w/ BMS, battery charge monitor, and switch
laptop wall plug charger 
I am 95 kg and run a 6355 enertion motor with a 15 mm belt on 90 ABEC clones and 14-36 gearing......I get around 10 km and have hit max speeds of 38 km/hhr

I bought three of these from what was bubblegum boards - a vendor in the early days of DIY when Jason and enertion were cutting their teeth over of endless sphere. I beat the piss out of one - taking it up and down some longer hills - had BMS cut the discharge a few times- I eventualy  eventually overheated my torqueboard  HV ESC 12s and it still give good power when charge.

 I hooked up a second of these to power my Seahawk build
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/seahawk-amano-33-6372-motor-7s2p-26650-bms-switch-diy-mount-esc/17809?u=monkey32

 and the board moves (the bigger motor helps too !!! Haven't even tripped the bms yet with draw. So far these have been a great investment for me. I have two new 10s4p's now so I figure I can let this last one go to someone else
