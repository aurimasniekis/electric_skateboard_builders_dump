Friends, my roommate is screwing me over and I need to sell the following items:

Bestech hcxd 223 12s bms  - open bag but never connected. $50 shipped US (paid $62)
![20180909_212412|281x500](upload://daWVl8qgSrpYT9jpgQ1OLPad3Sb.jpg)

Abec 11 97mm - used but fantastic shape. Asking $50 +shipping in US but I can negotiate (I really need money)![20180909_213227|690x388](upload://vomtkvvDJAT2RgFNU315RXq7MFs.jpg)![20180909_212935|281x500](upload://pxAx36eu9ti27CKiCvMiXHuPxS3.jpg)


Abec 11 90mm used, good shape, but one wheel had a metro-pulley, and thus, has a loose inner bearing seat. Asking $25 +shipping (please!!)![20180909_213437|281x500](upload://iJILDXDD55UoTT8ANto5GfQ36Ij.jpg)

One metroboard press fit pulley and spacer $15 +shipping![20180909_213622|281x500](upload://fIu84cJBEsUPzMr6sFEB5DgZ8LJ.jpg)![20180909_213639|281x500](upload://rMkRTOPHSTbEGkuIkzUwsIjn21T.jpg)

 Two evolve 38t pulleys and the 6900z NSK bearings they come with - NEW $40 +shipping ![20180909_213531|690x388](upload://emKwicWbmJedp4pQ7tMPUgxLrNu.jpg)![20180909_213525|281x500](upload://6fZpkmH2tJUuiE0fOGLJCioVeK6.jpg)

Again, please consider this a negotiation, but be kind - I could really use whatever you can spare :( 

If these items seem grossly overpriced, I am open to polite suggestions. I am also considering selling my DieBie BMS, which is unused, but haven't decided to let it go yet. Would consider $100+shipping, but I will probably keep it. 

PM me for whatever, but I gotta hold out for the highest bidders cause I'm BONED right now ðŸ˜­
