Hey, I haven't used this at all so it comes how it is out of the box. I'm assuming it would be fairly easy for you to upgrade though. You just need to plug it into a pc and download the update and install I would think like most things.

12s folks on the Unity thread have experienced cut outs and suffering bad injuries.  My buddy joined that in DC also did on his Unity based LaCroix. He suffered a separated shoulder on Wisconsin Ave.  Shit sucked.  Has me a little worried to tell you the truth after my last crash.  I will move the Unity to a 10s commuter build instead of my 12s emtb build.

Oofff I wonder if it's anything to do with the latest firmware. I've only used it on 12s with no issues but I haven't updated the firmware in ages....

Weird, buddy went down 3 days ago doing 34 mph.  Regardless, I want a video from enertion showing me that it is ok to run at speed with their product.  After busting the shit out the back of my head from a cut out (NOT RELATED TO UNITY), I am not trying to fly like fucking superman down the road.  It is one thing if someone has speed wobbles, I can correct those.  If there are people having cut outs, you got my full attention as I can't prepare for a sudden jolt.

Yeah I'll likely lose money as i'll probs only get one person who bids the $410 and then also Paypal and Ebay fees, postage parcel etc..

You know 410$ is the max you'll probably sell it for as in Easter they were 2 for 400$

**Edit price is in *AUD, so not so overpiced
