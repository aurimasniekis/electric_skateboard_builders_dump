I‚Äôll go and dig up a pic. Basically looking for something quieter. Maybe I needed to fine tune the meshing better.

Yeah, the Kaly is much better. A bunch of guys in new york that bought the one from 3d servisas are now running the kaly system -- I think that says a lot. 

I'm starting a new build soon. So this one has to go to make room. I'm also open to selling the deck and enclosure.

I dunno if it's just because I got the first gen gear drive system from Ernesto but mine is louder than all my belt drive boards put together... Did he switch to helical or something?

There's quite a bit of lubrication... the entire compartment is full of grease... Is this enough grease?

No, it needs to be fully packed. Apply more with the syringe through the lubrication port while it is closed.

Make sure your backlash of the gears are set right. More backlash than correct will result in alot more noise

What type of lube should I use? Also where's the port? üòÖ

@FredrikHems what do you mean by backlash?

Have you read this thread? Ernesto decribes what backlash is anf how to set the correct backlash. My guess is that you have too much, which makes the drive way louder than necessary.

Do not fully pack the drive with lubricant 
I put 30ml on each drive, if you need a bit more just add around 10 ml

if it's not the lubrication, it has to be the backlash. can you make a video?

I can when I get home again, but @Kaly put it together himself... I'd assume it's "correct"?

Well, they run old ingear style system which is loud and everyone knows it (Also you comparing open gearbox and closed lubricated) ;)

You can check @mackann videos on latest gear profile he runs on abec's

Also, the whole London crew was amazed by the difference of sound from FatBoy SS (which runs new gear profiles which was designed with help from professional transmission engineers)

@Arzamenable which one version you have v1 or v2 if v2 check your meshing because v2 shouldn't be loud at all. If it's v1 then it is louder than new ones :)

Because even 1mm mesh difference can make a lot of noise difference.

During the group ride last Saturday, did you think mine was as loud as yours? I'm using a different grease that what's suggested by Ernesto.

You installed the motors, right? Then you were the one that sat the backlash. Its impossible for kaly to do this for you, unless you bought the gear drive with including motors. :grinning:

At least that means it isn't _annoyingly loud_ to be noticed even when you weren't paying attention.

The noise level of the drive will feel louder  for the rider on the board than for someone riding a few feet away, this is due to a Doppler effect and the way sound behaves on a moving source. 

The best way to judge the noise level is by letting somebody else ride the board and you stay a few feet away to assess noise.

side story and then let's close the thread :slight_smile:

I hear all these yet my younger brother cannot hear the last two (OG metalhead).

Conversely, @boardman built a board for me using Hobbywing hubs that emit a high-pitched frequency that I cannot hear - yet they'll drive certain people out of the room if you engage the 'brake'.  Richard can hear the motors, and pretty much anyone in their early 20's can hear them, too.

idk if gear drives emit these same frequencies.  Sofu and I can compare the two and figure out the difference if any. 

...but I'm keeping these anti-millennial hub motors lol lock it up!
