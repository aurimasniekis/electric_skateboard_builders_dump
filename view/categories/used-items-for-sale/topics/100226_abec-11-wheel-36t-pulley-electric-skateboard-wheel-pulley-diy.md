This is a slightly used pulley set for the Abec-11 wheels. It comes with the wheel pulley, the motor pulley, and the belt to connect them. I got this about 2 weeks ago and was really looking to start using it but I need to pay rent payments. Kept for only two weeks since recent purchase in a smoke free home and adult owned. Please message me with any questions about the item. This item can be shipped out next day and is 100% as advertised in working order. Thanks for looking and god bless! :)![25%20PM|677x500](upload://liPd1khfOECwdWRq86gUR3yHcrk.jpeg) ![29%20PM|690x495](upload://gWLzHVKJKGTtgfVDDQtlNs5jZEo.jpeg) ![33%20PM|690x494](upload://t2URkMFA5cISABfJGvceLgR7ezh.jpeg) ![38%20PM|690x497](upload://pyaF4kyj8oYB19wOkJ8PJbDa1Ou.jpeg) ![47%20PM|649x500](upload://l4RRHaodj1Wa1VNfpEecmp6hsQr.jpeg) ![53%20PM|668x500](upload://a8LrLIm4wgEoxJcOgTXL3REqege.jpeg)
