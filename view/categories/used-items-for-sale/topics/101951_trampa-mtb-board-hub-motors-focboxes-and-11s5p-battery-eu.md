Shame to admit but yes, had to postpone the selling to use parts for another project, but for now it is again back in sale. Current state is unassembled.

Interestes. Do you have better pictures og board underside, focbox. The rear truck looks a bit abused, is it just scratches, or did you remove material?

Rear truck is redrilled to adapt those 8" hub motors. Also the wire of motors are going through the truck. Scratches are from removing the original axle.

I'll add pictures of underside and focboxes.

Yes, I can sell the deck with straps and motors(since they are already integrated to the rear trucks). I'll ask 500 for it including shipping.
