While browsing I found this almost as-new [Flex 2 Vanguard for sale](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Loaded-Boards-Longboard-Vanguard-Deck-42-8-5-/153236323477).

Flex 2: For riders 150-210+ lbs / 68-95+ kg

£50 opening bid, £12.00 UK delivery after the auction ends.

I thought this might help somebody :slight_smile:

Cheers,
JJ.
