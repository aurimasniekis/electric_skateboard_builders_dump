Happy Easter fellow builders! As the title says, I got a bunch of stuff to sell, unfortunately my life has changed suddenly I have to let them go off before complete my hybrid build... !

Battery pretty much brand new, I got it from @pjotr47, 12s4p Sanyo 20700b cells, 17Ah with BMS 60A with an anti spark loop key with fuse strip in it and it sits in a Kaly enclosureâ€”440euro

Dual focbox with Bluetooth module and enclosure by 3dServisas (FocBoxes fully operative one of them the wires for connect the remote is missing, I cut it for mistake while closing aluminum enclosure) 230 Euro


I got also 2 Bluetooth modules which I give for free to whoever buy something of the item listed above, got em from Flipsky they will work just with original Vesc firmware (no Ackmaniac supported)
If interested and needed any infos let me know!!
Cheers

115 per used focbox is a bit steep. Would be interested in one if we find a more appropriate price.

It's less than 115 per focbox, the 3dservisas case isn't cheap. It's actually a very good deal. 'if I hadn't already 2 focboxes I would have bought them for sure.

The price is meant for two FocBoxes (around 300â‚¬) the aluminium case (60â‚¬) and the Bluetooth module (20â‚¬)... the price isnâ€™t going anywhere lower than that

Man, this is exactly what I was looking for one month ago XD damn sadness kicking in now :P Well, if you were to part out any of the drive train I'd be interested in the motors, they seem to be exactly what I'm looking for to replace my 6355's

I'm split. I'm searching for a 10s4p battery for my Wowgo 2s but i also search for a 12S4P battery for my E-MTB board and both at the same time will rip my wallet.

EDIT : what range did you get out of it?

I never rode it, I got it from Pjotr 2 weeks ago and unfortunately my life has changed because my job hence thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m selling... with my 15Ah battery I did around 30km but iâ€™ve done some heavy offroad on some part of the track, so I donâ€™t know exactly how much you can do with 17Ah, try the esk8 calculator!

Hey man! Unfortunately Iâ€™m not selling the focbox as single, and there is a guy here who already wants them, I didnâ€™t put SOLD yet as till the money doesnâ€™t land is still on hold.
The battery is 440â‚¬
