My diy esk8 is looking for a new owner! the reason is that I want to make an new Esk8 this winter as project! 
its a Loaded vanguard deck with glassfibre layer on it for carbon look.
Eboosted enclosures
Roll to start martinsp antisparkswitch ( latest version)
Evolve double kingpin trucks 
custom build on MAD Hubs! 
Magsafe chargeport!
Mtr pro
Dual focbox
10s4p wich need some love ( a little voltage sag or i it needs to charge for a while.. )


this board is so smooth, flex, the looks, but also the performance ofcours! 
the hubs are powerfull as heck!!

with a new 10s4p you will get over 40km per charge!

part out possible! 
I am open for offers!
