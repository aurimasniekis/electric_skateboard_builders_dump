Hi guys,

Here are some items that I bought the wrong sizes for and have no need for them. I installed theses items just to find out that they don't fit all that well. The belts are practically new and the motor mounts have a noticeable scratch mark on the side edge from testing on both of them. I believe the mounts are also older versions but should work with current Caliper clamps according to their support.

Two 255mm belts- $12 shipped
Two 265mm belts- $12 shipped
Two motor mounts (no clamps included)- $45 shipped

$60 for everything. USA only. Thanks.
