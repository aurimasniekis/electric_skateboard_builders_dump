I paid $198.95 plus shipping for this moonshine hooch.  I ran the deck for a couple of weeks but it wasn't for me.  It's been sitting in a box by my bench for months. I figured I'd put it up and see if anyone else is interested.

There are some screw oles in the bottom of the deck from the enclosure and VESC mounting, they are 3/8in deep & 2mm wide.  It was a fairly small enclosure, most other enclosures will cover these holes.  The grip is not in great shape so I will include a sheet of Jesup Pimp Grip, new.  I will also include the hanger hardware including bolts and nuts.

Make an offer.  I am willing to trade for another deck, electronics, whatever of similar value.  Please PM me offers.
