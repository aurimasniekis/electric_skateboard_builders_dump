Hi guys,
I have some things for sale:
- Maytech VESC with 6x heatsinks on Mosfets and one big capacitor instead of them three, it has bootloader flashed, everything works flawlessly; 70 EUR
- Orangatang Kegels 80mm, 80a,  in very good condition, used for a month, a little over 100km's on them; 45 EUR
- a pair of Paris trucks V2, 180mm. They are in used shape, still ride amazing. I've trimmed down one side so I could fit the motor mount. I'll throw in the 3D printed motor mount too; 30 EUR
- Alu wheel pulley for Orangatang Kegels, 36T, 12mm, great condition; SOLD
