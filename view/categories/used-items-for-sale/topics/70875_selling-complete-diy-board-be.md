Great board, But used parts for the same cost retail, (And everyone can debate retail cost)

Might not get loads of hits here,
you could maybe if you like try also post this to some local for sale website, you may have a lot more interested guys there.

Your board looks cool. Can i also buy parts from you or do you only want to sell it as a whole? Because it is gonna be though to sell it as a whole concidering the price.Would be interested in the trucks, 1 motor and mount and the wheels.
