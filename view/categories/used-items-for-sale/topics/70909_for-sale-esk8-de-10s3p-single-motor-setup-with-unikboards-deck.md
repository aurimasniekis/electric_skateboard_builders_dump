After buying a Boosted Mini X for commuting I'm planning to start another build. Therefor I'm selling my current setup to (partly) finance a new build!

All the parts are used/scratched (and dirty, but will clean them a bit before shipping :smile:) but in good condition. For transportability I disassembled most of the parts so you'll have to re-assemble it yourself. Only thing you'll need is a remote and receiver.

Ideally I would like to sell all the parts at once to 1 person, but I'm also open to sell items separately. I'm from the Netherlands and able to ship within Europe. Need some more info how to ship the battery pack though :) Shipping costs need to be paid by the buyer.

DM for more info/pictures
