Good condition, has extended Warranty until August 2018, very clean inside. 
The wheels have been changed to 90mm clones and thus it now has a slightly higher top speed.
Running split PPM at the mo and has been since it came back from a service in Belgium. This can be changed to Can Bus but I haven't tried as never had a problem, and the can bus ports have solder residue on them.
Comes with Nano X remote, spare Winning remote, normal charger, fast charger, spare belts and pulley/fuses etc.
Would prefer colection due to size. NB, at the moment  the hole at the back for the motor wires is open, I'm happy to supply a tube of black silicon if you want to close it up to prevent dirt/water ingress.  
Â£850
Any questions please message me thanks.
