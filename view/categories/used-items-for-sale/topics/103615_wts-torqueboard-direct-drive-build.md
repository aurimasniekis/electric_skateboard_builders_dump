Hey guys, selling this DIY board, either whole or for parts. Unfortunately i wont be able to ride it for another year due to my ACL being torn so itâ€™s better off being used by someone who can. Parts: TorqueBoard Direct Drive 75kv motors 97mm Abec 11â€™s TorqueBoard 12s4p Battery Torqueboard VESCS TorqueBoard Mini Remote w/ Receiver LEDâ€™s Headlights Comes with the battery charger. Everything works great! Iâ€™ve ridden many times and itâ€™s been super reliable. Top speed is around 30mph.

Seems like you could get it for 5 bucks.

Maybe it's been updated tho. You can try to find that user on the new forum (not ~~run~~ abandoned by Jason the basin of unity desolation)
