Try pictures if you want anything sold. Also part of forum guidelines. Not really an issue but prices are abit steep unless these are prestine and new parts.

Isnt 100 eur a bit much for 218mm trucks they are 65$ at TB? How much are the customs because otherwise this is one crazy price.

How much is the tax maybe that explains the high price?

So to the UK its like 65 + 30$ shipping + 15$ tax = 110$ = 96 Euro, but I know denmark, norway and germany have higher taxes/imports and shipping etc.

Hi, I'm planning to build a very similar setup, so I could be interested if you still have the parts. Would you mind sending a PM? I registered just now and can't send them myself yet. Thanks!
