Bought this brand new and was going to use it for a build but went a different direction. 

Only had ronins mounted up to it for a little bit to try it around the block. I did shave the grip tape as I didn't like the overhangs where the feet are positioned. 

The indents in the grip tape were from the Loaded pan head hardware (highly recommend). Board is otherwise in great condition. 

$170 shipped

If you look at a new tesseract, they wrap the grip tape over the edge of the board at the front and back feet positions
