The arbor deck has been used for various projects in the past so has filled holes etc but is still in good condition. I still have the original meepo deck which is in great condition so can be changed back easily if needed. Uprated venom bushings also. 
All in good condition and has very light wear to the wheels. £220 or near offer 
I’m in Bristol
