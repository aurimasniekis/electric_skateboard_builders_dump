Infinity trucks, have some cosmetic damage nothing is bent
Comes with a few replacement bearings idk how many honestly
You will need to make/buy the mounting screws
Probably a one or two replacement spring holder plastic thingies will come as well
I also have a waterproof case and some mounts that were converted from vertigo to infinity and will need a washer between them and the trucks to fit properly
These need to be found to take pics of them :smiley:
