I have a like-new **TSG Pass Pro Carbon** for sale.  I wore it once and packed it back up because it's too small for me.

It's a **M** size **TSG Pass Pro Carbon** (black with green stripe) and I'll sell it for ~~$285~~ ~~$235~~ ***$199.99*** plus actual shipping cost

I’m 57.5cm and it’s a tad too small.  TSG says M is 56-58cm but the "Pro" model runs slightly small.

Others [say this about medium](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-are-the-tsg-pass-full-face-sizes/32257/5?u=b264) but I think that's not the "Pro" model

Why don't you get it? Is perfect for you. Move to Size L. (I'll get rid of it and I could also move onto Size XL, we kill two birds with one stone)

Almost always your head is one or two sizes larger than the helmets advertized size (or viceversa)

I have this exact helmet and size, the size is correct I am normally a 56cm size in Arai.
If you have a Shoei shaped head AKA balloon, you may be in trouble
