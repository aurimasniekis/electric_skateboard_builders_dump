It may be a good idea to post pictures - also you're going to sell a lot faster if you part it out

I'd be interested in your mech kit (minus the wheels and trucks) and the motors...if you part out :slight_smile:

Depending where you're from and if you'd consider parting out, I'd be interested in a VESC or two?

Hello,

If your selling the complete board... what RC or control setup is this using?, what charger?... BMS on the 6S2P? or 12S1P Zippy Lipos?

I would be interested in the whole setup without the Zippy Compacts or the Deck, much easier to ship that way too... PM me with a price if interested :slight_smile:

Regards,
Mike

PS:
Shipping would be to 19086 USA
