Used this as a commuter board, it's great for a beginner im selling AS IS. Selling in SF Bay Area, more than willing to test it out with ya 

Pros: Small Portable Board, Integrated Taillights, up to 10 miles with 20mph top speed, Upgraded bushings to Orangatang Orange and Zealous Bearings, Small Tail

Cons: It is beat up i shredded on this thing throughout SF to get to school, Sticker residue was not able to be removed and name engraved but all this can be covered with your own personal stickers, will also need new grip tape 

It is a single motor board the belt is still in like new condition, just the board, controller and charger is included in the sale

Would a prospective buyer be safe to assume it comes with the charger as well, or not?
