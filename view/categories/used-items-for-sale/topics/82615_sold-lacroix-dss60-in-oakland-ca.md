Hey guys,

I'm selling my barely used Lacroix board :sob:

Check out the craigslist post here: [https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/spo/d/oakland-lacroix-dss60-electric/6807677124.html](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/spo/d/oakland-lacroix-dss60-electric/6807677124.html)

If anyone on here wants it, I'll take $2000. Just let me know you saw it on this forum.

Mannn, voltures are really fast today! Naaaah, Wing, don't tell me you believe that crap? He wanted that board. Some volture came first and snapped it before anything.

I just never made time to ride regularly and we just moved to Oakland where it's not a practical commuter. Nothing I didn't like about it!

So-Lucky me! Had been looking for DSS50, and was waiting to pull the trigger on a new one, and than this one came on on C/L, and snatched it up. Already put in about 25 miles in 2 days b4 the rains came in.

It’s a beast, and everything written on the forum, YouTube and online has been true. Fast, stable, carves like a dream, BUT also a bit scary...
