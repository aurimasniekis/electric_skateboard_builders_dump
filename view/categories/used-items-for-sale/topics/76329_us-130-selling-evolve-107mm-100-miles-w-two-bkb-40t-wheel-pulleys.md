The Wheels have ~100 miles on them, and only one of the BKB pulleys was used, the other was mounted and 'ridden', just sans a motor and belt.

The wheel with the most wear is the drive wheel, and thats why ive taken 2 pictures of it, just want to make sure I show all the flaws :slight_smile:
  
Looking for 130 + shipping

WOOPS, yes. 

sorry. I had the wrong price in my head for the pulleys(thought they were around 50 each, my bad.)
I can do 130 + shipping, I think thats a fair breakdown 100 15 15:)

Damn, this seems more than fair.  Can't believe someone hasn't hopped on this.

More than fair would be $35 for each used pulley ($70) and $80 for the wheels.

I wish I needed them right now.

I've been debating this silent for the last week, lol. Thanks for putting that at rest 😂😂

I think this is the time of the year where everyone's wallet is looking a little yikes 😅😭

I'll sit on them until someone wants them, or I might take them off entirely, not sure.

I dont think raising the price is an option anymore, let alone fair :joy: so itll stay

Ah, a buddy pointed out that they weren't the press fit.  

I didn't look close enough.

Still a good deal!

There are 6 DIYers in my local community and we don't organise group rides during the winter, it sure slows down. Sure i guess we ride around and stuff, but remember we have more "general" periods of 2~3 months where the ground is constantly very wet in the EU. From my time in the US, it did rain about the same amount but it didn't remain wet on the ground for weeks. Also im not going to argue about the DIY elitist bullshit mindset you have but i will acknowledge the sly little comment you had to put in there anyway. As i know you'll respond, what language do you write in?
