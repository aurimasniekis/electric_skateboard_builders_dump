Just ordered a Bestech Bms which is coming in the mail sometime this week.  It comes with 2 so i'm willing to sell it anyone is interested.  I set the parameters for a lipo setup.  Willing to sell for 60 + shipping to even the cost. USA for easy shipping.

What are the specs for this BMS? I am running a 12s 5ah lipo battery pack.
