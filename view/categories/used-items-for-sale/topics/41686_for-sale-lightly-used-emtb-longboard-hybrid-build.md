This is my second build. It's got some minor issues that need to be worked out before it's completely roadworthy, and I just don't have the time or motivation to fight them right now, so I'm selling it AS IS. 

Bamboo drop-through deck
Caliber II 50 trucks
Prototype sixshooter wheels
Dual 6355 190kv
Custom CNC'd adjustable motor mounts w/idler
Dual beta vesc6 from Trampa
360WH 10s4p 25r battery pack with 80A programmable BMS
Working (BRIGHT) headlights with high/low beams in front, and brake lights in the back that respond to braking
Custom molded Kydex enclosure
4A fast charger (set to ~4.15/cell)
GT2B in 3d printed case (Has seen better days, but is functional)

Excluding all the parts that the board has gone through that aren't on it now, I think I have about $1250 in it right now.

Since it has "issues" (random braking, haven't been able to track it down, I think it's tx/rx related, might be as simple as swapping to a different tx/rx),  I'm willing to part with it for $900 shipped, or best offer.

Thanks! Nah, I think I'm going to stick to vehicles with handlebars. That way, when they decide to act up, I have something to hold onto to keep from eating pavement. (I am not a graceful person.)

As soon as I find a suitable frame to hang everything on. Then I can start ordering shit and putting it together.

I really need to replace the worktable in the garage though first, it's nasty and falling apart.

If I don't get any good offers for the whole thing, I'll add individual prices to all the parts listed and let you guys duke it out. Be aware though, that if I part it out, I'm gonna charge more overall than if it's in one piece, since I'm selling it at a steep discount due to the issues.

Even though I don't need it were you in the EU I'd be sorely tempted, very fair price and good man for the caveat

This is a steal folks and the dropout could easily be resolved and probably safely during testing/logging with @ackmaniac firmware to have the dropout reduce speed more slowly

Those mount adapters were custom made by @Qwiksand a while back. Realistically if you have the know-how and equipment to weld, it would be a simple piece to make. Just get a scooter handlebar for the tube;s circumference measurement that's needed

micargi are fat tire bikes, if i didnt have a chopper frame already i would buy 1, are you gonna go mid frame or hub? because i have always been curious about  adding a nexus hub "transmission" in conjunction with a middrive system

EDIT: this would make a pretty neat looking "snow" bike lol

Oops, didn't realize micargi are fat tire. I'm thinking of going hub, just for the peak power capability, and the relative simplicity of installation compared to a mid drive setup. I've got my eye on a Gravity Bullseye Monster as a possible frame donor.
