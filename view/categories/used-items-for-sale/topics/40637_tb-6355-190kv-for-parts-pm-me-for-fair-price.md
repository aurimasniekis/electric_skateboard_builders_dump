I’m not sure what it is but it sounds like a piece of metal is bouncing around inside the motor. Is that possible? How do I fix it?

Could be a broken magnet or it's just came unglued partially. Probably will have to take it apart to find out.

How do I take it apart and what am I looking for? Is it even fixable?

Pics of your motor would help. Most likely a circlip or two will need to be taken off. You'll need to take off your motor pulley first. 

Yes it's fixable.

Took off circlip already, motor won’t come off more than halfway.

could be that the magnet is snagging. Just keep trying. If that doesn't work it might just take some force.

It sounds like you might have a small rock or something in there. I'd try opening it again, but gently hammer the motor shaft until it separates. Also when bearings go bad or get full of debris they can seize or make noises like that so clean those out as well. This is what I use to clean my motors and bearings

you could have a small pebble stuck in between the stator poles.

it helps to bolt the motor to the mounting plate so you have something to hold on to, then pull really hard on the can to get it off of the stator.

you can't do it with a screwdriver.
You have to bolt the end of the motor where the shaft comes out to the motor mount so that you can pull the can of straight. If you don't pull it straight, the bearings will bind on the shaft

it looks like one of the stator poles is damaged.

It looks like you damaged the stator with the screwdriver.. not sure how much this will affect how the motor works, but it probably can’t help. Try screwing it back on the motor mount, then tapping on the motors shaft with a hammer or something so the can comes off? At this point if it’s has a broken magnet and damaged stator it’s probably just good for parts.. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/4/944bca7525534d08aa75615d2f87e330eb8817e0.jpeg" width="547" height="500">

I took my motor apart the other day for the first time and at first I didn't know why it wouldn't come out but then I realised it was the magnetic field holding it in there. I just pulled as hard as I could and it popped out

You already damaged the stator like @JohnA mentioned. 
It´s cheaper to get a new motor, than trying to fix that.
Also you still don´t know what else might be damaged if you still can´t open it.

My advise: keep it for spare parts and get a new one.
