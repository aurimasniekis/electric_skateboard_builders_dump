**ALL WITH PICTURES**

Heya guys, I've decided to restart my build...gotta sell everything so I can pay for new stuff, and then buy new stuff.  I'm open to trading anything for anything else, items with leading asterisk will be bought/sold if replacement is found.  PM me for anything, I'll keep everything up to date with a status.

That dickyho drive kit, how much use did the mount get? Any experience with it getting wiggly or loose?

Also, the koowheel set up, have you been able to open up the hubs/take it apart for servicing? Ive had a hard time in the past getting motors open! Any specs on the ESC discharge rate?

That kit has maybe 30 odd miles on it but the mounts are very secure.  I have a set of the prototypes for the original shorts that came loose but the new long mounts are very good...that doesn't even have loctite on it and it stays

I have not been able to service those hubs but I also only gave it 30 seconds...that ESC is rated for 1300W per motor, the motors are about 350W each

I am interested in the batteries. Where were the cells sourced from, just tentative as these cells are often fakes. What is the best price you can offer shipped to 53202? 

I know I am new to this forum but I have the same handle on endlesssphere and have completed many transactions there and have perfect feedback buying and selling on eBay: joshuahandrich91. 

Thank you,
Joshua

The cells had the original Samsung 30Q wrapping when they were salvaged and they have the authentic marking in the exposed cans.  It will be $89 for the cells and approximately $30 for shipping (single cells require extra padding and handling, I can't risk getting in trouble so it costs a bit extra)
```

I’d be interested for $100 shipped if that was agreeable. If you’d rather wait to see if someone bites at your originally asking price, I understand that too. 

Thanks again.

I would like to get as much as possible for them, I need funds to get a real battery :sweat_smile:

If nobody goes for the batteries in a timely manner then I will get back to you about them

I need to sell my off road kit to make room for an upgrade. These are almost new (40mi of light use) and have been modified for 8" pneumatics. The front wheels have different hubs*

Asking $156 plus shipping, should fit in a $19 flat rate box or I can use a cheaper (but slower) shipping method

![9A8E7CE8-E8F8-4308-ABD8-0EBE40636433.jpeg](https://esk8-news-objects.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/2X/0/0b1b46066f5e33fc330325499dec54f001d364f1.jpeg)

Kit includes…

* 2x 330mm TKP trucks with bushings
* mounting hardware (screws, nuts, and 6mm shock pads)
* 2x motor mounts with clamps and reinforced cross bar/carry handle
* 4x 8" pneumatic wheels with tires and tubes (2x hubs are aluminum with integrated 60T pulley, 2x are plastic**)
* pulley hardware (2x 12T pulleys, 3x 495mm x 15mm belts)

Just add 2x motors for a complete off road drive kit! The ride is super smooth even on uneven sidewalks, but it’s to beefy for my shorter campus build

*Will require 4x 16100-2RS bearings or I can include a set of adapters for 12mm bearings on 10mm axles

**Front hubs are made from blue plastic off an older MTB, but they are still strong
