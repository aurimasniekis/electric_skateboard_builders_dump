I have 4pcs DEFECTIVE Flipsky motors

2 x 6374 190kv
2 x 6374 150kv 

They are all having the same problem, wich is **LOOSE MAGNETS**. This could be fixed, if you want to spent the time on it. Or use them for science or simply spare parts.

They are all pretty new, and have not done so many kilometers.
Two of the stators are having some solder balls, they are all measuring just fine with my LC meter, so i think the only real problem are these loose magnets.

**Im asking 68 euro plus shipping within EU.**

This is how they sound, due to the loose magnets : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQsavh2sBdo
