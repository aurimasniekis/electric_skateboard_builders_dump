25 bucks? Does not come with power brick as it was my monitor power supply. Will come with balance board.

If its a 'clone' then you can get these brand new with a power supply on ebay for Â£22...

power brick

imax B6 does not use a power brick, they use a power cord like a desktop computer.

The IMax B6 uses a laptop style power supply, the IMax B6AC uses and ATX cable.
