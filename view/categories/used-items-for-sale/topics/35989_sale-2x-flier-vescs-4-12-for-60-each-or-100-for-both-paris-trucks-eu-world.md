I have never used this trucks, I bought a complete longboard because of the drop down deck and the offroad wheels. But the hanger is not really straight so it might be difficult for esk8 but might be good enough for normal use, but it's not top quality, that's all I know. But to be honest, I fell in love with paris trucks, they carve butter smooth and are miles ahead in performance and feel compared to any standard truck I have ever tried. Gullwing and Caliber are nice, too. But I switched to street/urban carver that's also why I sell this parts which were supposed for a longboard build.

danke sch√∂n @rich !
 
Waiting to hear back if I should pay you for mount depending on whether Lionpuncher is willing to pay whatever the shiping is to Canada from √ñsterreich.

@Lionpuncher it's very beaten up dude and shipping will probably be like ‚Ç¨20, you're looking at almost $40 before you get it....you could theoretically get a new unbroken, unblemished one with dual idlers for similar coin in US/Can, threads a'plenty, look homework sir -

Full disclosure; I have a twofold reason for interest in the mount
a) The post is free to me since I've eaten up lots of the list above = ‚Ç¨15 extra cost to me, that's it
b) More importantly - I can't figure out & pay up my total and get all my shiz till you piss or get off the pot! lollolololol

I see you really want the motor mount :laughing:
@Lionpuncher already paid it, there is economic shipping for 10‚Ç¨ to canada by mail.
If he changes his mind due to your links or you offer him 5‚Ç¨ :joy: we can talk about to add it but I think he wants it.

I'll send the first orders tomorrow morning.

Haha @banjaxxed you must trust me here, I've defo done my mount homework. And if shipping wasn't so decent I would have passed. But this came in under 40 Canadian pesos still making it way cheaper than any of those options.  There's a misconception that shipping in north America is cheap. The reality is to get this mount sent from Austria is actually cheaper than any of those mounts just to the north. Shipping kills it every time. Those mounts at their cheapest are 65 us$, that's like 82$ CAN. Even if i buy a new mount clamp from APS, this mount still saves me like 15 bucks. And this is for a budget build for my sis who's still not forked over any cash. Sorry to mess up your plans bro, but it's much needed over here. 
I hope your builds go smooth. 
Happy ripping!! :grinning:
