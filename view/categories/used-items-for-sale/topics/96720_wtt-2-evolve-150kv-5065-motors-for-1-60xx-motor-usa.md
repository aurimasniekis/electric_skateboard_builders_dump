I'm mainly looking to trade trade these. 

Really good shape. 
 One looks like it has zero miles the other has slight fading paint on pulley and the phase/sensor connectors cut off. 
But i can provide replacements

Preferably 6064 or bigger 
And 200kv or less

I have a 6355 190kv motor from torqueboards the shaft spins freely, and I think it's just loose grub screws. Interested?

Ill think about it. I like thats its a tb motor. Was hoping for somthing a bit bigger since im doing a single drive.
Was offered a 6364 sk8 and so far that's my favorite option.

They fit @boardnamics mounts but not tb ones unless you only put 2 screws  (btw the tb ones will fit the motors that you tried to put on the boardnamics.)
