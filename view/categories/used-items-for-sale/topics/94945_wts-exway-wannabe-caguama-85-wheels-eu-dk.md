Selling this set of "unused" Exway 85 80A Wheels, they have a core like Kegels but ever so slightly different so kegel pulleys aren't a native fit.

Worked with a 3 bolt 3d printed one I had.

Been on the road for 500 meters at max so like new.

Asking 42 Euro, can ship if buyer pays shipping.

Located in Denmark.

Accepts PayPal or Bank Transfer.
