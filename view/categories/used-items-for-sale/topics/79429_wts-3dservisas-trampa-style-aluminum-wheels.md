I have a set of 3DServisas Trampa style aluminum Wheels for sale. They came with the [FatBoy Mini Drive Train 1:3 for TorqueBoards 218mm Trucks](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/products/fatboy-ss-mini-gear-drive-for-torqueboards-218-or-fatboy-230-240-trucks?variant=6605335265307) that I bought in March, 2018. I have since swapped to 6 shooters which are a better fit for me, I like 6in wheels and a flat profile. 

It's a 3.75 in hub which fits 125mm Gummies, 6.5", 7" & 8" tires from Trampa/MBS tires and some others like 200x50.  They come with 7in evolve tires. The wheels and tires have about 300 milrs on them. 

There is a 5 hole mount for pulleys on 2 of the wheels.  You can see everything in the pic below. 

When new the wheels sell for about $275 US plus the cost of whatever tires you buy plus shipping. I'll take $275 with the tires plus some extras shipped anywhere in the US. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
