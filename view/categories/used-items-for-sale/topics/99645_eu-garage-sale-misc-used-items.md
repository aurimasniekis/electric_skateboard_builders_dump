Here we go! I have a bunch of items from my first esk8 build that I am in no need of. I´ll list everything available down below. Everything is located in Sweden, but can be shipped on buyers expense within Europe. 

I would like to sell everything as a package, however each part could be sold separately. Please contact me if you have any suggestions regarding the pricing, I´m open for discussion =).

**Complete Drivetrain**, ***70 Euro*** - Paris 180mm trucks, 90mm Bigfoot wheels (bearings included), 36/15 gearing, motor mount and 270kv 5060 PropDrive motor. This setup is great for beginner builds, especially paired with 6s lipos and a 150A car ESC. There are some visual imperfections, however, the drivetrain is really mechanically solid and will last for a long time.

**Lipo Battery charger**, ***15 Euro*** - Like new, complete with box, all original wiring and manual.
