Would prefer a trade for a Unity or sell for $300 
 These have never been used, I'm just looking for something with a built in switch. I'll throw in some 4mm male bullet connectors. I'll get pictures up tomorrow.

Build in switch on the Unity saves Soo much space. 

I'm waiting for the firm ware update for 4wd. It will turn on both Unities through canbus but won't shut them off.

And then the switch fails and you're like: OMG, its all on the same PCB! I'm fucked!

Thatâ€™s not possible! ðŸ˜… itâ€™s the unity ðŸ˜Œ
ðŸ˜‚
Seriously, a simple xt90s saves the same space.
Just in - on, out - off. Minimum risk of failure.
Just looks not so good...sometimes.
For a top mount battery I still canâ€™t see anything better than just to use the xt90s to switch on/off your esc ðŸ™Œ

Right! Forgot!

I have Diebiems that I've been too lazy to install. Rumour has it that theres a push to start function... I regret the holes made in my enclosure already :sweat_smile:

ESCapes can use the AS5047 encoder, Unity cannot, right? Hmm...

They're based on the 6.4 hardware vs the focbox based on 4.12 hardware.

I would have fucking bought them but budget is over, I'll have to sell some stuff on the contrary ðŸŽ­ I got a white pair already, collection would be complete!

... Heck I'm not sure to wish you a fair sale so maybe I can grab them later :laughing:

I've got a message from someone saying they'll trade for a unity, which is my preference. I'll let you know if it doesn't go through.

Just curious, what's everyone's opinion on the Escapes after using them for a while? 

I've had a dual waiting for the right board for a while now. I did test a motor detection with them on a 10s battery, worked perfectly.
