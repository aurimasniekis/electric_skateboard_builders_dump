I bought a Vestar V-1 board (https://vestarboard.com/collections/vestar-boards/products/v-2-vestarboard-longboard-dual-belt-drive-motor-electric-skateboard-with-wireless-remote) earlier this year with the intention of upgrading the parts as I figured out what I liked.  After about 20 miles in I got a little water in the anti-spark switch which made the ESC not turn off so just upgraded everything at once. 

Original Prices:

* ESC - $89.00 - https://vestarboard.com/collections/accessories/products/vestarboard-accessory-esc-mother-board-for-electric-skateboard

* Remote - $19.99 - https://vestarboard.com/collections/accessories/products/vestarboard-accessory-remote-controller

* Drivetrain - $299.99 - https://vestarboard.com/collections/accessories/products/accessory-dual-belt-drive-bridge-gear

The ESC is twitchy for sure but I was able to get used to it and I think it is just the switch that is causing issues. Depends on your battery but it was plenty powerful for a starter board and got me up any hill I tried.

Buyer pays shipping from 97225 in Oregon. I am moving and need this stuff out of here this weekend so make me an offer!
