Hello reader,

I just recently broke my FOCBOX v1.7 and now want to sell it. The FOCBOX was never used on a board, only tested. I have no idea what's broken. U401 and C25 are not present on the board anymore. C25 Can be resoldered to the board as I still have that chip. I am located in The Netherlands.

Please PM me to discuss a price.
