Selling my very lightly used Hoyt Remote. This thing doesn't really need an introduction but its definitely one of the highest quality remotes out there. Used only a couple of times and is in mint condition - not a scratch on it. Comes with reciever.

Asking: SOLD

Will ship for free to Canada and USA (ships from Toronto, ON, Canada).
