Hey all. I am getting rid of some parts from a build I am no longer pursuing. I ended up buying a Mini-X and I think that is all the board I need at the moment. All of these parts are brand new and have never been used. Located in Northern Virginia but I am willing to ship (shipping costs on the buyer). DM me with questions or inquiries. I will be keeping this post updated as things are sold.
