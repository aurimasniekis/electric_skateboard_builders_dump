Hi, guys I am selling my Evolve Carbon GT 2 in 1 which I bought in Dusseldorf, Germany (2017 June).

The deck has some scratches on the center of the bottom but everywhere else looks like new. Battery condition is not the newest I was able to get ~20km distance riding in the Fast mode with an average speed of 15km/h riding in the city. All terrain tires have medium wear, street tires were used maybe 3 times I did not like the feet massage :smiley:

I am really sad to say goodbye to this board. It was my transportation device in London, but I am already building the third one and just don't have space, plus I don't use it anymore so I think it is better for someone to use instead of standing in the closet.
