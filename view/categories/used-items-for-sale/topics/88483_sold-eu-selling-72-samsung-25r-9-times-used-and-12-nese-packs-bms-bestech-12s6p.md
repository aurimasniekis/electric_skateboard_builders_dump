Hey there! As the title says I got this battery which I realized it is a bit an overkill for me, I want to sell as whole pack but I can consider other offers. I got all the invoices which can prove all the items are pretty much brand new, I used just a few times before realizing I wanted something different![image|375x500](upload://vPl5YnD46m7sIIItmQpSxW1qn7T.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://oZx5KKcBLhkooRg4NHUSXNSzCkg.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://aXuqBMCFD93UEU7s9G9h8oA9NpW.jpeg) Iâ€™m looking for 300 euro the whole pack

Damn that's a good price. Since they're NESE modules I bet parting it out could increase the total value, but you do you man :slight_smile:

This stupid phone keep getting on my wayðŸ˜‚ I edited the price but I wonâ€™t ask anything more than that, I payed around 400 total, but since I used a bit itâ€™s not worth like brand new

As @rusins says, you should check on the calculator, range depends by your gearing and where you are going to ride
