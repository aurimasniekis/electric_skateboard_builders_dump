I ate it really hard on that board a few nights ago on that board up there at 30mph. My helmet 100% saved my life along with a Kevlar padded flannel I was wearing. I slid on the spin protector a good few feet. Lost my phone for 30mins too. The board was just sitting in the middle of the road chillen. I didn’t Think a small raised bump would knock me off but I was wrong
