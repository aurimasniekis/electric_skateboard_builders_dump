I purchased several torque board 6374 motors this past summer. While I was waiting for my FOCBOX’s, I primed the motor housing and painted it black with hi-gloss exterior latex paint.  My FOCBOX’s arrived just recently and I was able to test my motors. This motor successfully completes both FOC and BLDC setups with the VESC tool. However, when trying to use the hall sensors a bad result is always received. So if anyone wants an almost brand new sensor less 6374 motor, this is it! I’m open to any offers. I think $80 with included shipping is fair.![image|375x500](upload://aND8d00opd9cJzbQsFJw7HgYUBy.jpeg)![image|428x500](upload://9Ydje0XX2qimzv9ycsAR4xtnHs9.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://knaKrzxcbngEazJPkZdq68PKHay.jpeg)
