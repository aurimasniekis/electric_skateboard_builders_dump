I have a 44t flywheel pulley that I bought from diyelectricskateboards.com a few years ago. I used it a few times but it was too large for the 75mm wheels I was using at the time. Its 15mm wide and comes with some brand new bolts and the outer washer.Im looking to sell it for 30cad (22usd)
PM me with offers
