Hey people,

I am looking for a Motor pulley with 10mm bore. 9/12mm width. 
Last thing to complete my build :) So hit me up if you have anything and are within the EU.

Unfortunately 10mm bore is so unusual :/ No major shops in EU have it...

Just seen it. But the shipping would be as expensive as the pulley itself :/ Not looking to spend 20â‚¬ on a pulley...

Thanks ! But they are 15mm width. My shaft is too short for that. 

I'll wait for @fraannk ^^
