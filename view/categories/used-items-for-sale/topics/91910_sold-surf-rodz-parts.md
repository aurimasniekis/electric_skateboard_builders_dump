Selling a lot of surf rodz parts that I bought. Haven’t been building as much as anticipated

Have not tested any of the threads on the hangers but they visually look good. One or two of the hangers look like they use a larger size axle, not sure. 

(5) 200mm hangers
(2) polished 45 degree plates
(2) machined 50 degree plates
(1) blue 50
(1) gray 35
(1) stealth division plate, unmarked, looks to be 45
(1) part of adjustable base plate

$225 shipped, US only. Sold as is

You need to add pictures for this post to be taken serious. It sounds like a decent deal but no one will buy it without pics

The Carvon hanger does not fit surfrodz geometry, it matches caliber geometry.
