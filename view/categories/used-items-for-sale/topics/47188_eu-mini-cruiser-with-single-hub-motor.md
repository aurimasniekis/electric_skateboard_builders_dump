Hey guys, 

I have for sale, 2 of these boards. These are everywhere on eBay I think. Both are used but in near-mint condition. I’ve just ridden them around my hood to get to the gym or get to the market nearby.

I’ll add the specs later but it should be everywhere :smile: it has a 18650 7s1p battery and the generic nano remote.
I‘d say for everyone below 80kg it’s a fun ride to get around nearby or using as a last mile vehicle. Just what you’d expect at this price range. Voltage sag is acceptable but it won’t handle hills unless you are <60kg. Very compact and lightweight. 

Both are in working condition except for one board on which the led light on the button is not working anymore. But it still beeps when turning on. So no biggie. 

Prefer EU buyers, paypal available. I’m ready to split shipping fees.

80€ for the fully intact one.
75€ for the one with the not functioning LED.

EDIT:: 
2,2 AH Battery
Around 15 km/h depending on Weight
400w Hub motor
It says 10km range. If an infant would be riding it. More like 5km tops.
Wheels are 70mm and board should be 30" ( ca. 70cm) length.
Weight is 3.2kg.

Up this thread
This is basically the same board. The normal version, not the Sanyo one. Specs differ from website to website though.

The hub motor is 120w and the meepo one somehow goes faster and has a bigger range.
