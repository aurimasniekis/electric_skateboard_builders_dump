I have for sale and if lightly used version of Hummies V2 hub motors. This set has lovingly been paired and bonded to a Freeboard hanger and build to be a super cruiser/ carving machine.

The hubs are believe 90kV but it was difficult to know during the early days ( let's put it this way I ordered 90kV). 

Set includes a matching Free board hanger for the front ( these pair beautifully with Sidewinder II base plates) NOTE: the hubs include hangers only....NO Baseplates in other words not a complete truck.

The full set of origional orange thane ( careful this can get soft if ridden to hard) with matching orange front ABec Clones 
And  2x New set of the specially molder rubber that is stupid durable and very solid.

I have too many projects going and have Hummies newest hubs and board coming so time to clear out some stuff. Looking for 150 euros but feel free to make offers.

I am in Spain or EU but will be traveling stateside in Dec. and can ship from Florida.

Jet spud/sidewinders and true ABECs in photos not included .....just for perspective.
