Since my dream was to get a Boosted Board I decided to sell everything I have that I don't need for now so I can hopefully save up for my dream board. 

Since I never got my money from my last sale I would prefer to be paid via bank transfer / Mobilepay or find a solution via PayPal since my money is frozen for 180 days.

I'm located in Denmark, can ship everywhere in EU if buyer pays shipping but shipping prices may or may not be high so would prefer to sell to someone in Denmark.
