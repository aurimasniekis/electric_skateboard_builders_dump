Hey,

do you have any more information on the deck? I am interested...

How does it look from below, where are the mount holes?

Also, are the 90mm flywheel clones still available? If yes, where did you get them from?

Sorry but the guy who bought the focboxes insisted on getting the metr pro... he paid me 50â‚¬ for it and picked everything (lived in my city) up 30 min ago. 

I do have the old metr module if you want that? You can have it for 10 euros

Again im sorry man., :slightly_frowning_face:

Still possible to record rides, use modes and change settings. 
Dont really know the technical difference  maybe someone that knows can fill in ? ;)

Old metr modules do not work with Oreo and above, slower and less reliable connection, but still possible to use for records, modes and stuff :slight_smile:
