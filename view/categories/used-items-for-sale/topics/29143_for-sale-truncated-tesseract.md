Selling my board for the simple reason that I don't really use it and I need funds for another project.  Really I had more fun building it than anything else.  I'm asking $800 for it.  There is over $1300 in parts alone and less then 2 hours of ride time.  

I will like the build thread for all the pictures and build specs.  

I would like to sell locally so I don't have to go through the pain of shipping LI-Ion batteries.  so I would say 1.5 hrs from new London CT would be ideal. 

Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for looking.

Agreed, beautiful board. Thought it would be gone by now for sure. 

Just out of curiosity, what kind of range and top end do you get? And how much for shipping to the US (California)?

Theoretical top speed is in the low 30's but I've personally had it up the 25 mph and there was still a little room to go, and I'm 6'3" 200 lbs.  As far as range it is around 24 miles. It uses 40 samsung 18650 25R5 cells.  Shipping would be via ground and I can't imagine more than $50 to California.

Jesus christ, now I definetly need this, screw NA/EU shipping. I am totally taking this off your hand now, If shipping the battery will be an issue I will gladly take it off your hands, with as much time you need to sell the battery seperately!.

Let me know, I am all in mate.
