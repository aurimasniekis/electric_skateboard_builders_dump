Hey Guys

I bought 2 VESCs from [enertion](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-x-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/) but dont need them anymore, because i bought a complete eboard.

My first idea was to give them back, but why not give it to one of you.
So, if you like send me a message.

They are brand new and absolutly unused. Including warranty.

130€ each.

I live in germany, so you can get them in 2 days without any problems with the customs (it took them around 2 weeks to arrive here...)

All the best
Stefan

I'm not interested. But the first question people will ask is if it is a pre-trademark FOCBOX, or just a plain VESC. **Post Pics**.

Guys... i thought it would be a good idea to help you to get a brand new vesc as fast and cheap as posible, but most of you try to get them from me for a price where i lose money.

So... if somebody really want them for 130€ each send me a mail... if not i send them back to enertion on saturday and say good luck for you!

130€ = $154.12 USD at the moment.

Enertion sells them for $159.38 USD.  Not too much of a savings for the buyer so I recommend you getting a refund from Enertion in the next few days. People here will always want something for lower cost than a seller wants to make.

Also, there is a EU group buy currently running, you can get one for as low as 122€ although one or two weeks later. 

I think 130€ is still very good price for FOCBOX in EU. I offered @driver 135€ shipped but didn't hear back so I got in the group buy...
