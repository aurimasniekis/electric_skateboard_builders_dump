Is this still available? 
I have a genesis hellfire that I need a new motherboard for (it got wet and started smoking). 
The parts available through Koowheel are all Gen 2 so I would need to replace the remote and hub motors too I think.  If anyone knows if I need all of those parts I'd be grateful for the info.
I am now looking for 2nd hand boards to use for parts.

You could hit that mileage if you weigh like 115lbs! I have a genesis with the same battery and 16mph and 8.5 miles hilly/14 miles all flat was the best I could get out of it, I weigh 160lbs and road mine a ton, brother had the same exact board and would get the same. His wife however can get 12 miles and have plenty of battery left lol
