My barely used Bajaboard G4X up for sale. This is a rare opportunity as I am not aware of one ever coming up for sale second hand. I bought this Bajaboard from Bajaboard Europe in November 2018. You cannot buy these direct from Bajaboard Australia as you get redirected to the European distributor. I paid 4150 euros including delivery. This was a boys toy present to myself for Christmas. The board has only covered approx 2 miles and has only had a top up charge so not even a full battery cycle.
The reason it is up for sale is that the board is just too much for me to handle and Iâ€™ll admit it scares the bejeebers out of me. Know your limits. I wonâ€™t lie this thing is crazy fast and even at 20mph my legs started turning to jelly. Thatâ€™s not far off half the speed this board can travel at.

Item is on Ebay Uk. Collection only. Please take a look on eBay and you can see the pictures and the full spec and description.![image|375x500](upload://UrjXuVRdHaMkv5xvwfzKqKld3b.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://bWclQ6GYgYBcrgKkSDvxqExqfab.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://5TFU82M2EhZcyg0sn9ZlpFoM0RA.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://kODOAcYOQdKxjgmNJlAPLbaK3ul.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jJFSmAASW4kLNlg0buGckxBfvNA.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://qI1YGnRc1fECjpaJkSiLYokgy7l.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://1P44ZXkUOX5Y7KYVIsxf4yPzRLu.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://284WkfJW8TQ6iWjVQgBBLSJ3n5M.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://cRx116FF7MfWAGONlXwPKNwEgoV.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://1PhOGzPdnemZgjmdDIE1gr2H0uI.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://2Vn2ygG9LCqedExx9urNlnsA37N.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://nl9hwdLrBVHRhgXBP6UHiU86mJ2.jpeg)

Iâ€™ve got a carbon gt that is a lot less scary. Esk8 is addictive. Iâ€™m not giving it up. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

He does have Best Offer - maybe he'll come down $20 so you can pay for a ride through an automatic car wash :)
