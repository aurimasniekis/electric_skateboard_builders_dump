Hey sorry, in Kentucky and the longest ride I ever took with it was 6 miles I do not know the exact mileage hard to track.

Would you be willing to sell the ABEC wheels seperately?

Was not going to ask for friends and family look at the other person thinking I am a scammer and my response. I will post a picture of the board with my username in it and your username in it when I get back home if you need me to prove it that way.
I was recently scammed through friends and family so im not going to pull that crap on someone.

Chill dude, every thread has the guy who will post that
1250$ is a lot of money and you are new here, its understandable for people to be a little sketchy about you, you need to prove yourself first and hopefully you will.

i apologize for everyone’s doubt. we had someone come on here and take over $10,000 from people without delivering products. we’re very cautious after that.

I think as long as you use goods and services you’re just fine. good luck!

IP banned I hope. The electricskatebording subreddit took a big hit not to long ago by a guy named Jailbreaktim selling a GTX for a really good price he hit about 6 to 7 people for more than $1000, they managed to track him down though, through social media, IP addresses, and domains his email was linked to. Most of them got their money back in the end.

This is correct. 
It is forum policy that sellers may not ask for friends and family payments. 

@DarkZed1 
Please don’t be offended by this post. It is no reflection on your integrity, it’s just a fairly new forum rule that applies to everyone.
