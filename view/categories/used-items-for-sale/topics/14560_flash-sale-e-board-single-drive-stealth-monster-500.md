12s, single 6374 190kv motor, AXLE vesc, diy mount, caliber 50's, 83mm flywheel clones, xt 90 loop key, custom deck/enclosure, 6amp charger.

This thing is sweet it's wicked fast and awesome to cruise.  

Make me an offer just trying to raise a few last minute funds.

If you wind up parting it out and willpark16 takes that stuff, I'd be interested in the pulley kit.

Where's the pulley kit from, and what are the measurements?
