Selling my beloved board :/ I just realised that I have ridden it only like 10 times since I had built it... the new baby, full-time job + some part-time work and writing my MA thesis all make it just impossible to ride it enough to justify having such an expensive piece of equipment stored in my closet 24/7 :frowning:

The board has:

I was building it for myself and done everything super clean to make the whole thing last - and I am convinced I'ts gonna last you a lifetime. The modular battery is my design, made in such a way to minimize the risk of the thing catching fire as much as possible and I do find it to be the safest design out there - also convinced it's not gonna fail like ever. And **it's basically new, and everything is in more or less pristine a condition**.

I'd let it go for about **3000 EUR EU shipped**

and if you really plan on buying it and have any doubt, please read the original thread - there's **everything documented there step by step**: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bieda-board-15ply-vertigo-trampa-urban-carver-roadside-trampa-carbon-enclosure-dual-trampa-136kv-motor-trampa-motor-mount-dual-enertion-vesc-x-12s4p-li-ion-with-60a-bms-2-4ghz-remote/26902 or don't hesitate to contact me via PM.

Thanks you for the headsup @Sn4pz, but there's a saying in Polish that goes like this: Don't teach your dad how to make children :stuck_out_tongue: And you are actually wrong :P You cannot just delete your threads at will after a given time. You gotta flag it for deletion for the admins. And I have right before posting the new one. And still waiting for an action on their part ;) Thanks anyway, tho!
