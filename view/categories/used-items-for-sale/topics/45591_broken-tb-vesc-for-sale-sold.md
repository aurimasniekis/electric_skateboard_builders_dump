Worked for about a month 4 month ago, never touched it since until today. Don't know what went wrong but when I do motor detection in bldc, the motor jiggers for a split second, stop for 10 seconds, jitters for a split second again and stop and repeat. Could be me trying out FOC initially and not working. DRV chips seem alright. Almost sold it as working. :sweat_smile:
Going for $30 shipped. US only.
