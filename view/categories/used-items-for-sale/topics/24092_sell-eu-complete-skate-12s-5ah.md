Hi,

I am selling what I rode a few time for, let's say 800€ (+ shipping) to debate.
Specs :
esk8.de   vesc and antispark,
 4x3s 5ah lipos, caliber trucks 50°, emma daigle kebbek switchback board with a sweet concave.

Mechanical : sk3 192kv, a 15/36 but I will also provide you with a 16t + another sk3 192kv motor perfectly working.

If spliting ill take trucks/vesc/192ks shipped to Ireland

Only if u are spliting, it can be hard to sell full boards here.
Put local add up on 2nd hand sites

Alright, I will think about it.

If some of you guys are interested in the complete board but find it too pricey we can discute ;).
