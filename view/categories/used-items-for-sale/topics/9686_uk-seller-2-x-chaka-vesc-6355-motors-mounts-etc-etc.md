Hi guys
I have just got to many boards lying around and for my next project I need the deck of my dual 6355 build.
Before I strip it apart I want to see if there is any interest here to get the parts before I put them on Ebay.
What I will have will be:
2 x Chaka VESC (CAN connected and with DIY mini controller) - GBP150 for all
2 x Paris motor mounts with practically brand new 6355 230KV motors (including 15T gear) GBP100 each
36T wheel gears with mounts for ABEC Flywheels (aluminium)  or ABEC clones (3D printed) included in above.
4 x 83mm Flywheels (Original) GBP30
4 x Complete pneumatic dual setup - wheels 5", with extra tubes and tyres + tool for tyre changing. Includes 60T gear s+ hubs on two wheels + belts - GBP50
1 x Electronic Anti-Spark switch 2-14S 120A - GBP20
3 x 14T - 8mm shaft motor gears

Various other stuff I probably have that I never used.
I shall post pictures if anyone is interested. 
Postage is extra. You can google the costs as well as I can.

Cheers

VECs placed on small platforms for better air circulation / cooling. Aslo placed small heat sinks on MOSFETS.
If you want the platforms you can have them too.

First pneumatic setup with 50mm motors. Changed later to 6355 motors.

Hi Guys
If someone else wants the other VESC and the other motor mount I will start stripping and sell separately. 
If I do that I shall of course send individual photos of each part you will get before we do the transaction.

PS
I take it you are both in the UK?
I am in Bournemouth if that helps.

@Jujet - no problem mate, just the postage gets more expensive.

@ Alex - I would rather not split right down to just a mount. To many pieces left over. Mount would be with 6355 motor and both wheel and pinion gears + belt. All together 100 quid.

@ Alex
Sure thing mate. Just hate the hassle of the postage for all the bits - but if it goes that way I will post it on here.
I am in no rush though so may take a while if it does go that way.
I am hoping someone want to build a dual :slight_smile:

Hey man, new to building but definitely interested so would appreciate some help here.
haven't even began to buy parts yet so i'm starting fresh (own numerous long board/skateboards etc).

Would the motors/vesc's/wheels all work well together? I presume this would just leave me with batteries to buy?

I'd be pretty keen for a lot of this, so hopefully we can figure something out (UK too, way up north)
Cheers

Now that would of course make everything easy, one package. 

Below are a few pictures of what is offered. Any questions just ask.

Just say exactly what you want, if a lot I would pay shipping to UK mainland. 
(Or offer a discount)

Well they are all on a present build which is up and running.
Motors are genuinely practically new. VESCs have not run for more than 10 hours I would estimate, the motors maybe 1 hour. (Had 50mm before)
I have built a few boards and can honestly say I have more fun building them than actually riding them. I prefer my LDP board (so just pumping without motors). :slight_smile:
I just have to many boards,with and without motors, right now. (If that is possible)
If you bought everything off this board all you would need is a deck and the batteries.
Oh, and the trucks.
Shit, if you really want I will sell it as is, a complete and running board - but where is the fun in that. You gotta say you built it yourself. :slight_smile:

Wheel gears. 36T
Both ABEC original wheels and clones. ( clones are 3D printed but honestly are the best fit of all the variations of all types of gears I have used)

Sorry man, you replied quicker than I could post those pics.  :slight_smile: Anyway, tell me what you want exactly. I take it the mounts&motors, both VESCs with controller. And anti spark. Which wheel gears? If ABEC do you want the wheels as well? 
2kg packet to Germany was about 20 Pounds so I think thereabout.

Ordered this a looonnngg time ago but only got it recently due to delays supplier side. Looks well cool but I have never even switched it on as my boards have already got controllers and why change a running system (OK just lazy)

25 Quid if someone wants it.

As much as I do not wish to upset anyone it would of course be easier to sell all at once.
If you want the switch, both vesc, alien controller, both motors & mounts,, ABEC wheels with gears that would be 400 GBP. I would have to weigh it all and see what postage would be. If not too stupid price I would pay it, if crazy price we could split it.
How does that sound?

3 to 5 working days delivery aim	
Up to £250 for loss or damage

If you want the parts for 400 GBP I will pay the postage as above.

I am not sure of weight, my scales here do not go down that far. If over 2kg the price skyrockets. 
Stupid I know but then I would have to divide the package into two, so 40 Quid postage.  Grrr
I will check at post office tomorrow and let you know. Either way I will pay one package. If there is an extra cost will you except that? Really sorry but out of my hands.
Oh, belts and 3 extra gears not in picture but will be sent. (Extra belt included so 3 total)

Hi guys
I have had a few offers for pretty much everything but nothing binding and no actual money been transferred - but it is weekend. I will wait until the start of the week for confirmation or will then repost what is left.

What I do have is a mini remote I bought from Alibaba. All I have ever done with it was hook it up to a FVT controller and spun a motor - but that was all. 15 GBP if someone wants it at own risk.

Another thing is the 3D printed 36T gears for ABEC or ABEC clone wheels. This is the only design (not mine) that I found to be a perfect fit. Used them for testing on both 97mm clone wheels (pictured above) and 83mm ABEC Flywheels as below. 20 GBP for both

All sold or spoken for apart from the 3D printed gears pictured.

Only "spoken for" are the pneumatic wheels & gears, one anti-spark and a TB mini transmitter. (As one package)
Many people have expressed interest in the various parts but if someone wants to offer 90GBP + shipping (UK = 12 GBP / Europe = 20GBP / USA = 25GBP) then they will get first choice and I will send immediately on payment per Paypal.
Basically first come first served for the package as it was already packaged for someone who has not got back to me.
If split will go to the people who asked first.

Sorry if I have not back back to everyone but there was a shitload more interest than I thought there would be.
