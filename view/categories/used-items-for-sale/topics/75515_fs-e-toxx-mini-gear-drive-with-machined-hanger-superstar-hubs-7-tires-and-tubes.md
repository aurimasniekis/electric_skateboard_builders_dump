Basically brand new, put on everything tested for less than 5 miles. 

Then it's been sitting in the corner collecting dust.

Do u happens to know what size it's for the MTB trucks ?
Because I think I mess up my street urban deck holes by forcing those wrong size bolts into the holes .
```

---
## \#27 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-12-23T18:21:32.193Z Reads: 135

```
The holes in the deck should be m6.
In the Mini hanger base plate the holes m5.
In the ultimate, Infinitiv base plate they m6.
What is now your problem?
I don’t exactly understand what is wrong where.
Just get some m5 bolts, washers and nuts and mount your hanger.

He supplied me the MTB bolts.
N when I was doing it . I didn't have the trucks with me that time .
So I kinda snug into the street urban deck holes .
Now I am afraid that the holes on the deck might be a tiny bit too wide for the M5
```

## \#29 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-12-23T20:22:45.358Z Reads: 129

Try it with m5.
If it’s too much play you can always file out the holes in the base plate to m6, but I don’t think it will be necessary.

I dunno.
I really snug in the m6 onto the M5.
I thought that's the way to go with this .Until next day when I has the trucks .
I might just drill out the truck base plate to fit m6

Do I need spacers in between anywhere ?
