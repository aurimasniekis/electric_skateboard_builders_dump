I was one of the lucky people who got the Carvons even though I purchased from the website. I just rode them once and was a little ahem a bit underwhelmed by their performance compared to a belt driven system. I stay in a city that has more hills than flat roads so this was very important to me. 

These arrived in December and I have ridden these just once. I got them for $460 and I paid $70 for the other set of adapters. Letting them go for $420+$15 shipping for all. Lemme know if you're interested.
