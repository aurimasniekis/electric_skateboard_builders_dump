Since I finished my builds a while ago and im not planning on a new build Iâ€™m looking to sell my spotwelder. It has been used for two packs in total and works great. Would like to sell it fot 50 euros since its just catching dust in my garage. Welder comes in the original box with footpedal, extra fuses and steel plated nickel strips for testing. Shipping in the EU will probably be 18 euros with DHL tracked.
