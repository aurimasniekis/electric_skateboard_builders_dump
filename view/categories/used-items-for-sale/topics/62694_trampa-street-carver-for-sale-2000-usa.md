Bump. Just wondering. Is the interest for builds not there or is my price too high?

I dont know, but i think that more pictures will gauge more interest. Especially pics of how the battery and wiring was put together, so people can see and inspect the quality of your work. Just my thoughts. :grinning:

It's also hard to sell a complete board here. Most of the guys on here are having fun building a board, not buying one. Ya know?

A few things that could influence the price/reason for a lack of interest.
Trampa drive trains are no longer that popular (replaced by superior belt or gear drives).
SK3 is no longer that popular (amount of affordable sensored brushless 6374 motors has increased).
Lipo for these boards is not popular, unless you have an off-road build (range considerations).
Most choose bigger '' wheels for such trampa builds.

Might be more interest via Ebay or similar websites.
