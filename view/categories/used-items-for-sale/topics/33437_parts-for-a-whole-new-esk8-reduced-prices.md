Box 21x17x6 10$
Percentage display 5$

So I have a he2 8s3p liion pack with 60A bms from batterysupport comes pre assembled as a plug and play pack. With a charger laptopsyle. No pics of the pac since it’s on it’s way to get spotwelded and assembled so the buyers has to wait for it to be done to ship. So you know. 150$  Reduced price

As you can see I probably missed something but it’s everything needed for a complete build. I can think of a deal for everything pm for that 

I have a Guy that gets his hands on second hand loaded boards Tan Tien, dervish and if your lucky a Vanguard and som of the fat ones - around 250$ pm for the ones available.

Ask questions! If intrested dies I will part out and the more you take I can give discount.
