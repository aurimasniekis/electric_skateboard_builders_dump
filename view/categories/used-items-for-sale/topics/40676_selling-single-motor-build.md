I am selling a lot of stuff! Here's the list

1. My single motor build- linked here: [build on a budget](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-an-attempt-at-performance-on-a-budget/24468/38)
this is the build: (would prefer to sell as a whole)
Single 6374 Maytech Sealed motor
5m Belt kit (drive gear and  motor gear)
90mm wheels
front and rear trucks (motor mount on rear trucks permanent)
2X 5s lipo batteries 5,500 mAh with connectors to wire into 10s2p pack

As of now, please only contact me if you are interested in buying all of the parts/the entire board. I will part the board out if I change my mind and will update this post. Thanks, and happy skating!

****Contact me for pricing****

Sorry! I quoted the wrong price- they were 13 a piece when I bought them. Looks like the price has gone down since, but they are out of stock. Will sell for $9 /piece
