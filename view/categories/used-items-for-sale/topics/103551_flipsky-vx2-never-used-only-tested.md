Price-$75 shipped. I paid $95 a few days ago for it

Selling this VX2 by flipsky because Mboards won’t reply to my emails for me to return

-great remote feels good in the hands great throttle feel to it. I just did not know it doesn’t show live data from the UNITY but it does function as a remote

I've seen a lot of different versions of this floating around, is this the color screen? bright or dim?

Not the colored screen. And I’m not sure if it’s bright or dim. ![image|375x500](upload://cGDAeWgy8eomMSkNXgPY4fszxJw.jpeg) 

Don’t know if you can tell by the picture

I believe just the colored screens come in the bright/dim variety. Only one brightness for the monochrome that I've seen.
Wish you'd posted this a couple weeks ago, just looking for a colored screen v now. glws though!

The live data just isn’t compatible with the unity. It is with other speed controllers
