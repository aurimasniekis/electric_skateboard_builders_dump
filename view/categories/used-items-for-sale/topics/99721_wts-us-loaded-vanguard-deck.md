Just because I didn‚Äôt offer doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs all I trade for. 

But it seems like you‚Äôre just trying to throw shade for some reason. Have I offended you? Or what was the purpose of your comment?

Weird products?

Just because you don‚Äôt understand what they are it doesn‚Äôt mean you can call it weird, publicly, affecting the reputation of someone else.

They are internal and external battery packs taken from new scooters like ninebot es4 etc., with bms already installed. 

Some e-bike packs as well. I wouldn‚Äôt be selling them on ebay, repeatedly, for many months, if they were some ‚Äúshady‚Äù products.

So brand new these are about $170ish?

Not sure how to make a reasonable offer for a used version with holes already drilled.

Where are you located?

Bought the deck which had additional holes drilled in it that were somewhat hard to see on the photos (there was a zoom in on the deck but not the additional asymmetrically drilled holes that would definitely be noticed by potential buyers before making the decision to purchase) so not sure about the price fairness on the deck. 

The battery enclosure came without the board side lid, which one would assume should be included thinking that the lid for the battery enclosure is an essential part of the battery enclosure itself. The abscence of the lid was not mentioned either, which also would definitely influence the decision making process. 

Not to mention the front trucks that were cut in a very rough and weird way. No photos of those manipulations were offered and none of it was mentioned in the description. I wouldn‚Äôt bought them if I knew the condition. ![image|669x499](upload://9OpCVStkBrDkmW9n5UKlKMmSNIh.jpeg) 

The esc enclosure and the rear truck mounts look fine tho.

Seller offered a refund for the trucks but I didn‚Äôt hear from him for days. 



Would not recommend.

It took me an extra day to reply to you. 

You have been refunded on PayPal for $12.5 (full amount for the front truck) plus $10 for the battery enclosure (at your request). Refunds take 3-5 days to post from PayPal, the last message you sent me was 1 day ago. 

I did NOT drill additional holes in the deck after taking those pics. At this point i feel like you‚Äôre lying to get me to refund more and more money to you, which is not fair. 

I have sold parts to so many others on this forum and I‚Äôd be happy to tag them here for a review. 

I‚Äôd be willing to post PayPal screenshots and screenshots of our conversations here too to prove it.

If you‚Äôre unhappy with anything else that I sold you let me know.
