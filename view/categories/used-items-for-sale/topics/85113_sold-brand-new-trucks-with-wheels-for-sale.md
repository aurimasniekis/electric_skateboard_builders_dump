Hey guys, 

Just bought a new longboard and am selling the trucks as theyre not wide enough for dual motor setup. 

Brand new never been ridden

180mm "Slant Block" Composite colored trucks
WHEELS  69 x 55 mm
WHEELS MATERIAL casted polyurethane
WHEELS HARDNESS 83A
BEARINGS ABEC 5
COLOR  Natural


Will post anywhere if postage is paid.

Looking for £50 plus postage for both trucks and wheels. Postage in the uk will be around £5.

Also open to swaps as looking for large longboard wheels that fit 10mm trucks.

Thanks

Nobody here can really use any of those components, you're better of selling on ebay and expecting more like £20 than 50...
