So as some of you know I've had these parts for a while, some I've built and some bought from a UK user. I haven't used anything myself. Just tested it all apart from the Bluetooth module which I followed a bad wiring tutorial for. So here is my inventory:
GT2b remote and receiver (Â£30) New

Enertion R-Spec 90mm Kegel style wheels, 1 worn others new (Â£20)
tb knock off trucks with assorted bushings, Â£15

10s3p 30Q battery, Bestech 60A bms. I built this battery myself using good format and methods. The cells were posted out of sync. I got it so just one group was 0.1 out and my charger broke. I checked a few weeks later and the gap had closed up to 0.08. I just tried to check now and my voltmeter fried. Message me if you reckon you can handle it you might get a very good deal.

I know it looks jank but I've just stored it safely with the connectors tidy.
Reason for sale is someone hit my car. 
Also my soldering iron packed in as I was trying to remove the connector from the vesc so that needs re-heatshrinking

Worth noting the gt2b comes with spares to transform to a trigger controller aswell
