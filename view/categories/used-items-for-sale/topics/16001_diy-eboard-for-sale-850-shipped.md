I have a e board I haven't ridden much maybe 30 miles. Parts are

Diy 230kv single drive.
Diy 16/36 gearing
Diy 6s4p with charger
Caliber 180mm trucks
Ebay flywheel clones 83mm
Diy 6s esc and program card
Winning remote
Pshycotillers 405 enclosure.

Just testing waters. Build is 2 months old. All parts were brand new when installed. I ride it occasionally usually just in my shop. I don't want to part it out. I'd rather keep it if it came to that.I also have a extra set of Caliber trucks and pink 83mm wheels and bunch of other extra parts and goodies I'll send to the buyer if wanted <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/4/1407cbc702c3decfdf229d97013fdc3e4c5c6bcb.jpg" width="374" height="500"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a1a4f67f22fe6aa51f38d91943b0040be179837c.jpg" width="666" height="500"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/e/4ea92040cd9eefa88fdf10e049dcac2630e74987.jpg" width="374" height="500">
