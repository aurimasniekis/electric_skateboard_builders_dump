I am selling my FocBox Unity because it is a unpredictable PoS at 12S6P with 168kV dual setup. It ruined my leg. Selling to a guy/gal with 10S or who knows their limits (apparently 60A battery, 30A motor is too much for this).

I could trade it to equivalent dual setup. Or just cold hard cash.

It has XT90, 12AWG phase wires and 4MM bullets and Platinum warranty(useless in EU).

Used for less than 25KM, not even dusty.

Asking for 350€ including shipping.

Can add the heatsink I have for it for extra 45€.

i just dont fell safe with 3.5mm and 14awg bullets on 13s (especially when i planning to push a car which is mega continuous current you would never see in normal usage.

This is standard practice among electrical engineers designing consumer products.  The exception to the rule is the way you are talking, and it sounds silly.

Everything is about tolerances and extra leeway so stuff doesn't fail.

And if streetface is a failure result, it's more important, not less important like you seem to believe.  Would you rather your coffee maker be more robust than the thing that can streetface you?  Because that's what you're saying.  Normal products don't use devices at their full rating, because that's a stupid way to design things, and those things will have high failure rates.  And if the failure mode is exceptionally bad, like streetface or aircraft malfunction, you should be MORE careful, not LESS careful.

Pro tip, if you’re selling a product that you know doesn’t work reliably then don’t try to sell it for more than you paid for it. I don’t care what modifications it has.

Also, I am now worried because I have a unity to upgrade my dual board that I ordered a while back and still has yet to ship but I run 12s and I don’t want to die.  I have been using two FocBoxes for nearly a year now all the way up to 40MPH w/o fail... maybe I should just not touch em if they work & the unity is known to have issues...

I don’t think you can warranty something if it is used beyond its rated voltage. It makes sense that they could only warrantee it if it is used under 10s conditions. I recognize that I am not risking the warrantee and my potential safety for the extra performance

I agree but Unity is rated 12s so we consider replacing.
But it's not the issue with the replacement actually, there is another story.

I was more going off what @b264 said. That DRV chip is only rated for 60 V. Systems must be over built. Engineering 101. I just wish they were more transparent about the rating. It should say capable of 12 S but not necessarily as reliable as 10 S.

Edit: Yeah they should warranty if advertised for 12s and it looks like they are doing just that.  Just people need to be aware of the additional risk, that's all.  You can't have people blindly trusting it at 12s voltage if the DRV has a 60V max.

It's quite simple tbh. I have bought my unity with platinum warranty. My country, during imports, declared it as a warranty policy. Meaning, that Enertion should replace unity with no cost, not even imports. 

What is their opinion on the matter? 

That I should put this warranty policy, which is protected by Lithuanian law deep, deep inside my ass, and suck up 100+€ for a "instant replacement warranty". 

I don't remember warranties working like that the last time I bought stuff outside EU with a warranty policy.

Let's just say that I am beginning to have a sour taste in my mouth, and my knee, thinking about Enertion.

I'd prefer this shit storm to be either erased completely or locked. To be left behind as a lesson.

I mean this pricing sounds just about fine. First batch unity with all imports cost me just 399€. Used for not much until it rekt me. Pretty much brand new. Not really planning to sell that for 200€, don't you think? 

And this was first batch preorder "special price" that will never be seen again. Current pricing is lower most of the time.

We don't know the full conversations that have gone on between you and enertion but you keep going on about your platinum warranty.

As far as I can tell @Deodand offered to send you a new one and requested your one back for fault finding. @CarlCollins made a statement saying the same.

Instead you are trying to sell a known faulty unity for more than the cost whilst morning about the warranty.

I get that this has put you off using the unity but why not get the replacement they have offered? Your more likely to sell a brand new unit than a known faulty unit. Additionally returning your faulty unit will help @Deodand work out what's causing the fault and help to find a fix, making everyone else's unity safer and stop the same thing happening to others. 

Seems like at this point your more set on starting 🔥 rather than actually trying to get the problem sorted out.

I accepted the offer by the way, but paying 100+€ of imports again for a replacement hurts my budget, doesn't it? Makes the Unity that initially cost me 399€, cost more than 500€. Quite a price, isn't it?

I'd prefer to lock this thread as I am still trying to resolve this.

Let's say I was _a bit_ angry that moment. A dysfunctional item to be shipped back and then a new _potentially_ fixed unit generating total cost of 500€+? Thanks, no thanks. For 500€ I'd rather have grabbed two VESC6'es and a few beers.

@murloc992 there is pretty much going on with your accident, so to be fair I didn’t keep up with everything, but what would be interesting for me is, what was your hole setup and could there be other components caused that lock up? Are you sure it was a total lock up or maybe just a cut out which feels like a lock up when hard accelerating or driving with 30+mph?

TLDR version:

It's a 12S setup with 168kV dual SK3 motors.

I rode at 55km/h for 10 seconds, I run, I roll, much hurt.

Board didn't ride when I walked back to it, cogged no matter what I did.

Next day friend reconnected the battery, board is alive again. He used the board without hitting too much speed for two days now, no cut offs.

There are several other people who had the same(even three times) happen to them, hurting them.

I'd rather either get a fresh unit, as this was first batch, with reversed connector and barely soldered wires (I resoldered all of them) or just a full refund by this time.

Because the unity didn't ride afterward and still showed high voltage in the battery. It cogged the motors, no matter if I stood on it or it was upside down. Deodand confirmed with me that it could have been a latching fault, which only got fixed by a full unplug and replug, so something is faulty in the PCB.

The board also rode two days now, used by my friend without an issue but way more conservatively.

I think the offer of a replacement Unity possibly direct from Jeff is something you should look into. Who knows perhaps he can agree to mark the goods for warranty replacement to your satisfaction.

On the flip side you can mark your return to Enertion with having a value of €20000 c/o Jason Potter 😂

There will be no admission of liability, an expectation of that would be naive in the extreme. The deal you’ve been offered is about as good as one could expect, I would take it when the meds wear off, perhaps there is something to be learned from your unit, perhaps not

And RC snubbers as well as plenty of other transient suppression (such as a transorb on the power rail).
Engineering rule of thumb is bare minimum 10% headroom, 20% for reliable operation.
While the absolute maximum rating is 65V, the operational voltage is 60V, and it is recommended to use the maximum operational rating for headroom calculation.

12S doesn't cut the 20% headroom rule, the VESC really is only suited to reliably perform up to 10S, unless properly speced RC snubbers are used.

Theres actually quite extensive layout examples on the DRV's from TI with aux components, so if you're unsure of the hardware you're holding you could atleast check if components match somewhat. 
From experience i know the powerstage on the layout causes the most problems however, the better powerstage, less transients

That's what the RC snubbers are for ;).

Or, if the designer is lazy, gate resistors for slew rate control.

But can't fault the designer too much, RC snubbers are a pain in the ass to spec properly, requires several iterations of probing and soldering  in different test values to get resonant frequency of oscillations, etc. This adversely affects time to market.
