Hey guys,

I'm selling an almost complete diy electric skateboard in parts. The main thing was a dual belt drive kit from diyeboard.com. Selling individually or as whole thing, basically you just need a battery.

I'm located in Germany.

Selling as:

* Power truck with wheels, motors, front truck and a spare belt. I changed the gearing and the wheels to Orangatang Kegel and 12/36 (original 13/35). If you want, I have a spare Caliber II 50 truck for the front (+15€)
**150€**

* Diyeboard Dual Belt ESC with 4 Speed Remote **70€**

* Globe deck without trucks, wheels. Foam pads can be removed **35€**

* FVT Dual 120A ESC "Sleeping Lion" 12S version with UBEC and programming adapter **85€**

* Wowgo battery and ESC enclosure (with battery meter) **30€**

* 42V 10S 2A charger **10€**

I have many small parts if you need something like connectors, riser pads, bolts, etc.

You can write me a pm when you're interested in a part. I can look for the shipping cost then.


Cheers!
