A few weeks ago I was shopping for a Unity on the black market and ended up buying one too many :sweat_smile:. Selling this like new Unity for $275 and a nano x remote for $50 (+shipping). If you want both, I will sell the bundle for $310 + shipping.

**Since I don't want to track multiple shipments, priority will be given to bundle buyers.**

Original packaging is NOT included. I can upload more pictures if you want.
