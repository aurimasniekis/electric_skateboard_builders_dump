Hello fellow Europeans,
Iâ€™m selling several used eskate components. I ship from Italy. Shipment cost will vary depending on your country.

I'm now offering a discount on the last stuff remaining. Consider it a Black friday week deal ;)

**DECK + ENCLOSURE + ANTI-SPARK SWITCH + BLUE LED POWER ON BUTTON =  90 --> 80 euro**
* Witko Natake: Artisanal deck made in Italy. Dimensions are 102 x 23.7 cm and it has a nice kicktail. Very little flex below 70kg. Few scratches, hardly visible.
* ABS Enclosure from Eskating.eu : 25 x 16 x 4.8 cm. A few scratches are present, as shown in the pictures.
* Antispark Switch and Power button from Eskating.eu

**83mm BLUE FLYWHEEL CLONES + KROWN ABEC 7 BEARINGS + SPACERS = 20 --> 15 euro**
Good general condition, but the wheel that was part of the drivetrain has a rougher surface and has a small indentation.
