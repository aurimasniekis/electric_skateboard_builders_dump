Hi. I am looking for that. 

Does anybody know if i can pair my remote to another esc than the one it came with?

Thx

No, has to be a hobbywing esc. But nobody in the EU sells them new yet, you could get dual VESCS but it'd be at least 120 euros to get going.

Could get one from wowgo directly. But would prefer to take one off someones shelf.
