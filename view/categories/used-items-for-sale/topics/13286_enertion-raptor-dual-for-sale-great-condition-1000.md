I have a friend who already owned a boosted Dual + and decided to buy a raptor dual to compare the 2. He literally has only ridden it a couple times and decided it's just too powerful for him to handle.I originally wanted to sell it locally and numerous buyers bailed before I met up with them to sell the board. Finals came and so did the holidays and now I'm reposting the board back on the market! It hasn't been ridden since my original posting back in November and still is just as new as when I originally posted it. Open to all reasonable offers! Will get some pics up soon. Located in San Jose, California. Can ship wherever if buyer pays the shipping.

All I have to say is don't let anyone cheap you out, especially if it's basically brand new. If you want $1400 or higher, you try go for it.

I actually live in Santa Rosa(about 1.5 hours away from San Jose). I'd be willing to scoot down there and pick it up in the $1200 cash range. Do you have any current pictures of the board?

I had multiple offers locally but all fell through before they came to see the board. Put this on hold so I could finish up semester and now here I am. It's all good. I don't mind taking the loss. But I can't sell it for anything less than $1000 at this point

@ArmandR What I was saying is that the OP had offers of 1300 previously,  and why now was he asking 1k. Yes that 1k should now be in your price range. Its a bargain, but you need to pay postage.

@Haick Arent you selling for friend.  Your last post made it sound like it was yours. Anyway good luck. The thing can be pushed as fast or slow as you want it to go,  so surprised by friends issues with it. He could take 1 of the motors off to make it less powerful.  Just a thought.

I'm surprised no one jumped on this yet. $1000 is a great bargain. I'm planning on the next CarvOn V3 build, I just have too many boards and only two legs or I would've bought it already. Plus I have a wife who's been supportive of this expensive hobby, not gonna push it =)

No such thing as too much power. Just change the VESC settings I'm sure @onloop posted something on what settings to use so the Raptor doesn't rip your ankles off.

I bought it from said friend thinking I would just keep it after the offers that were being given originally. Now that school is starting I cant really justify having 2 boards

I'm in the same boat as @Mikenopolis and can't convince my S/O to have another board yet especially since it's a whole 14 degrees here in Minnesota. :slight_smile: 

I've always liked the raptor's carbon deck and always thought it'd be cool to have a raptor to add to my line-up. Especially now that it appears they're discontinuing their v1 board to promote their next gen board.
