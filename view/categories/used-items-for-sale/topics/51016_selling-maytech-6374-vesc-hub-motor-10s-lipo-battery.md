Make an offer for what you're interested int! (i've edited the post now) I'm looking to get rid of everything, and am hoping people will make reasonable offers. Unreasonable Lowballing will be ignored.

I am selling the parts! I am not sure that you would want the motor mount- I can give it to you but i have not been able to get it to stay put for more than a month at a time before I have to re-adjust it. the remote and receiver I will sell for 25 USD + Shipping from BOSTON MA, USA.  Pm me for more details

I can post more pictures if you would like. It works perfectly, just has some scratches on the Can. I will include the mounting hardware with it as well. Here is a link to it on [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-finger-longboard-6374-170kv-electro_60567428139.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.22.7d2ef427RRagJN).

@accrobrandon I have actually decided to no longer sell that board as I am still using it. It's also my first build and I've found that i'm more attached to it than I thought... sorry. I will still be selling the extra set of hub motors though.
