Selling off my 10S3P Samsung 25R battery pack, built for an Evolve Bamboo GT. Was fitted just for testing then decided to build a 10S4P. I built this myself, all the details of the build can be found on my post:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/evolve-bamboo-gt-12ah-battery-upgrade/65235/15
Comes with SUPRA gold plated bullet connectors for easier install. Plugs into the original BMS, charge connector and Amass XT60 power connector. Charged and discharged just 4 times. 
Can only sell in Australia due to postage regulations.
A bargain at $280
Postage $35
Pickup if your in the Perth area.
