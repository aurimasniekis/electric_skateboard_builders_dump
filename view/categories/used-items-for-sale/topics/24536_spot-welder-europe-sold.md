I got this week a sunkko 709a. It's a wonderful machine. I have not used it yet but i will.
It costed me a heated discussion with my wife because it is another big device in a small flat. I plan to make a pack and probably sell it later. I just want to test the market here. Any interest?

This sale is a good chance for someone who is looking for a new spot welder of this caliber at a discounted price. If you are on low budget look for a cheaper model or make a diy custom welder. Please do not pm me with ridiculous offers anymore. I will not lower the price. As a matter of fact i wanna keep it but i am low on room.
Thanks for your attention.
