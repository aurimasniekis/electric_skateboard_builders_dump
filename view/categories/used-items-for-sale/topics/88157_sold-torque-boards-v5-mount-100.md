I bought this mount as new never been used off of the forum.  I test fitted it to my board, and unfortunately it is not going to work with my setup.  I am asking $100 shipped anywhere in the USA.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.![IMG_20190324_151350|374x500](upload://ygVaZCMGe2QVS3smHynldGzTKFb.jpeg) ![IMG_20190324_150655|374x500](upload://zdhXCUaHZ9ZT4Sh908LGyTbv8O0.jpeg)
