So after riding the new Raptor 2 I have found it would probably be best for me to go with a hub drive! That and I don't know to much about esk8 (had a buddy helping me out) so here is my old board for sale, it's really geared towards Flats than hills but he said to swap a pull and it would be fine!

Specs! 
6355 200k Maytech?
22T Pulley 36T drive pulley
83mm wheels
2x 15mm Drive pulleys (was going from Duel drive)
350mm 15mm belt 
2x Vesc unknown brand but from reading around Maytech?
ABS enclosurer, was bought here though! 
2.4Ghz remote
Torque Board 218mm trucks
Torque boards Rear Mount & Clamp 
Quest board from Walmart ðŸ˜‰ (may not want to part with it haha)  
42v 3.5ah Charger
10s BMS for 18650.

I'll try to answer any questions but I did just copy and paste the parts list from what my buddy told me! All items would be shipped via USPS beacuse it's the easiest for me, most people take paypal here so I'd prefer that be the payment! First person to offer me a decent offer gets it! 

Thank you guys! And looking forward to learning more about DIY and maybe pick it up when I get my Raptor 2!

If I decided to part out I'd like to keep the whole mechanical set (Wheels belts etc.) Together, I'd guess I'd want around $160 Shipped for it? PM me and we could work something out.

@anorak234 I'd like to try to sell as a whole before parting. Otherwise it's a laptop type of connector, if I find the bag from RadioShack I'll let you know what type.
