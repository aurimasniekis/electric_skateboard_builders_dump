I have two for sale.  Both have about 30 minutes run time on them.  Sold the board but the buyer did not want the ESCs.  
Firmware version is 170818.  Programming interface is included.  One Red and one Gold.  Can't see it in the pictures but both have EC5 connectors on the battery leads and 4mm bullets on the motor wires.  

$120 for both.  $70 each.  Shipping extra.  

Video of them running taken just before they were removed from the board: https://youtu.be/hO0QN-sTeHY
