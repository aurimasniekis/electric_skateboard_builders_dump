Yo !!I need to sell somestuff for buy a new push.
Unik like, 100kms (all the pieces have 100kms )

The same as the Unik but assembled by me
what changes:

10s3p battery Eskating
Remote APs
focboxs x2 under tool Akmaniack tool
hourglass rings
charger

All the rest come from Unik, very good quality on the way.

Excellent board, I'm reluctantly selling, but I have other projects

Bearings, wheels, battery belts etc, all at a distance of 100km,  the remote  had a small accident, I let drag a rag soaked in acetone above and the coating of a blister on the surface .. it is purely visual.
