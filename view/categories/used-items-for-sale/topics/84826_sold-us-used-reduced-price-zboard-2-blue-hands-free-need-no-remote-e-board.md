I'm selling a used Zboard 2 Blue electric skateboard. Originally $1200 (Indiegogo discount. MSRP is $1300). The board has some of the usual cosmetic wear of owning this board for 2 years, but no electrical or mechanical failures whatsoever. The only thing different than the ad below is my real-world range as a 190lb rider is a little lower than the 16 miles range the company promised (more like 12-13 miles for me under normal riding conditions). Please let me know if you are interested or have questions about the board. I'll be happy to answer. Asking for $650. Below is a copied description of the board:
