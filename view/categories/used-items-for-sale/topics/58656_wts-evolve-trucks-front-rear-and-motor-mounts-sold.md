I have a front & rear evolve truck and motor mounts for sale.  I bought them thinking it would make for an easy build and I'm a big fan of carving, but these are just not a good fit for me.  The trucks have less than 50 miles on them, the motor mounts I bought used so I don't know but they appear to be in good structural condition. 

This is what I paidâ€¦

Im asking $175.00 plus shipping, or if you have something to trade I'm looking for an Evolve AT kit (or other AT wheels) for a donor board, 6374 or larger motors.
