Considering the shape is different, doubtful, but with enough ingenuity I'm sure anything is possible

@mynamesmatt you would need paris style mounts for gullwing.  Caliber are much bigger and are d shaped
@MannyM0E no the back truck would need to have a longer stepped axle.  Evolve trucks are double kingpin, not much more expensive and will definitely fit the evolve at kit

You can put a supercarve hanger on a sidewinder baseplate to fit the evolve AT kit and also get readily available motor mount(s) from evolve or unik if you aim for larger motors I believe.

@MannyM0E These are double kingpin like the evolve trucks. Some people, myself included, use these with the evolve gen 2 axles that are wider than the gen 3 (latest evolve gen).

Only looking to ship to US for now. Would probably be cheaper for you to source locally

They are mad expensive in EU, each are like 60 - 100 dollars here so its cheaper for him to get used from the US.

I love how these things are advertised as

 **• Highly unstable at high speeds. Do not recommend for downhill skating.**

We are basically downhill skating all the time
