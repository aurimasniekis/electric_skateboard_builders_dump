Hi,

2 months ago I have build a trampa board with a enclosure under the deck. I did not know that I would like to ride a trampa. Now I absolutely love my trampa and I do a lot more off-roading. A housing under the deck is not really suitable for this, so I am selling this. Because my old enclosure has several scratches, the battery would be transferred to a new enclosure without scratches. 

**Price: 790euro**

Included in this package:

* Holypro 35° 15 ply deck with inserts + new Kaly enclosure (€350)
* 12s4p Sanyo 20700b flexible with cell fusing (only 9 time charged) (€430)
* 60A High discharge BMS (€45)
* Rubber gasket (€10)
* Bolts (Free)
* Motor cable riser (Free)
* XLR port inside riser (Free)

Hi Pjotr,

Are you interested in selling the 12S4P Sanyo + enclosure and BMS? (everything except the deck?)
