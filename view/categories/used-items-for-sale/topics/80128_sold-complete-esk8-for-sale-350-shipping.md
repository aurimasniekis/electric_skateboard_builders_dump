Iâ€™m selling a board I built for my wife (she now rides my LaCroix). This board was very lightly used as she never really became comfortable on it. It does have several chips in the paint, but that is more related to poor paint primer (and my weak painting skills) than wear and tear. 

Deck - Valhalla Skrilla 37.5x10
Trucks - 50 degree Caliper 2
Wheels - 83mm Abec 11 78a
Bushings - Riptide Krank barrel/cone front, chubby/cone rear 90a
Gearing - 15mm 15t x 40t
Battery - 12s2p Miami Electric Boards 
VESC - Ollin Boards
Motor - 6355 Torqueboards 
Remote - Nano 2
Enclosure - ABS by Psychotiller

This board is about 1 1/2 years old and has at most 150 miles on it. The reason Iâ€™m not asking more is the battery will only charge to 84%...I havenâ€™t opened the battery, so Iâ€™m not sure what the issue is. I weigh 215lbs and live in a hilly area, this board will give me 5 miles range before it hits voltage cutoff up longer hills. 

This is great board for anyone in flat areas looking for a lightweight board with about 10mi range. 

This was the 5th board I built (at the time) and I routed the phase wires through the deck.

Iâ€™ve never done 10 miles on it, but my wife has (sheâ€™s much lighter than me). I have the same battery on another board and Iâ€™ve done 10 miles on that one in flat terrain multiple times.

Top speed is around 25mph. I didnâ€™t build it for speed as my wife would never go fast. 

The deck, trucks, wheels, bushings, motor, motor mount, remote, and pulleys alone are probably worth $300 used. So youâ€™ll be getting a good vesc and a half decent battery for $50.
