i think it has a one year warranty from APS.
And so far, I've not had any problems with it throughout my light use/testing.
Comes with the ESC programming .iso file for use with USB port and works flawlessly.

In terms of frying, I haven't heard anything of the sort but my best advice is to not run it at the max voltage, which is 7S in this case. So 2S-6S would be the preferred voltage for this ESC.
