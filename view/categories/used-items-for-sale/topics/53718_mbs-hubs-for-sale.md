I am not sure if you would consider these Rock Stars? They do fit an 8" Tire. here is a comparable picture next to my Rock Star II Hubs. It seems the only difference between the two is the baring size.

I believe they would, but I'm not 100% on that since I have no way to check. I did attach a picture as a comparable next to Rock Star II Hubs, that come off a Evolve Gen 2 board.
