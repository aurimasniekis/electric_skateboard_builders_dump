Hello peeps , any interest in new items from last EU group buy? 
Because of the guy who organised this GB it took to long to get the items , more than 4 months.. In the mean time i lost my job so im not doing the build.. Im willing to sell all items i got for the same price as i paid for.
On the base price of the items we all paid extra 10-15% for the shipping (this is where the group buy organiser fcked up)
I have:
90MM Flywheels Set - base price 29 eur - end price 32 eur
Trucks caliber clones - base price 25 eur - end price 28 eur
Motor mount - base price 22 eur - end price 24 eur
Pulley kit 16-36 pulleys with 3D printed retainer ring ( the original one from china was crap so i paid extra to get good 3D printed one) - base price 35 eur - end price 38 eur
Slight discount is possible if someone buys everything at once.
Im located in Serbia , shipping only to Europe , buyer pays shipping
Here are some pictures of the items

Motor should fit to since everyone in this GB got some 63xx motors to.
Shipping to Portugal : Air mail (valued letter) 200gr = 6.5 eur
