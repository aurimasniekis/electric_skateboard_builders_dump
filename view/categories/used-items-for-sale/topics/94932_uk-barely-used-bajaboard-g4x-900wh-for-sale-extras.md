Hi everyone,

Listing today on eBay, located nr. Winchester in Hampshire:-

[https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/173913608270](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/173913608270)

I purchased this from another forum member here a couple of months back and just haven't found the time to go out and get used to the beast!  I did try it out but it's just too much board for me and I'm happy sticking with my slightly more mundane DIY Trampa :slight_smile:

It's not even had a full battery cycle - has the upgraded 900Wh battery and (protected) light kit as well as upgraded CV joints.  I'm also including a brand new ISDT intelligent discharger (which I bought to protect the battery as I topped up the charge once and didn't even use the board enough to drain it back to storage voltage!), and a brand new set of Freebord S2 bindings.

Decided I'm going to put the money towards a quad bike to get me and my Trampa out into the sticks :slight_smile:
 
Some pics (these from original seller, but board still identical condition)..

No longer on eBay. I’m guessing it has a new home?

Maybe the £200 in fees made him take it off

Nope - it was on a £1 max FVF and cash on collection only so all I paid was a quid ;)

Quite simply,  it sold.

Nice, I've cancelled ebay orders and delivered in person a couple times ;)

Hope the new owner enjoys, beast of a board.
