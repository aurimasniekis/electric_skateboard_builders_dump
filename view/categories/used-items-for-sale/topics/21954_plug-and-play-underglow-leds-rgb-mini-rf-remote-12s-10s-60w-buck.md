Did a rebuild so I took this off my old board and its just sitting there....

* 12 rgb led strip 60led/meter (I have 1.5m of unused strip, i can solder them in 1, 2 or 3 sections for the best underglow effect.)

```
the buck module alone is 12 so no it can't.

obviously it can be cheaper if you do it al yourself which is why I listed and linked some parts.
this is for someone who wants to skip the work and time. :zap:
