Hey folks,
i just upgraded my spare board from a enertion VESC 4.12 to a focbox :slight_smile:

Now i do not need the 4.12 VESC anymore and gonna sale it. It was not used much because i rarely used my spareboard. 300km at total i think!

Whats specials about this deal?
- Hardly used VESC
- Good quality
- Rocking it on 12S 149kv
- Fully FOC-Compatible (only used it in FOC :D )
- Heatsinks on all mosfets
- I can include the female XT90 connector if wanted
- I can heatshrink the VESC again if wanted. 
- PPM-Cable included if wanted
- Added some coating for splashproofness

I just took the heatshrink to make a picture of the PCB. The white, transculent stuff on the cable is some excess coating.

Looking to get 80€ + 8€ international tracked shipping. 
Sending it from germany. Can ship the next day :)
