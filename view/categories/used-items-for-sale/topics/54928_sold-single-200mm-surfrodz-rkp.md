Hi all, 

I have a single

- 45Â° Baseplate 
- 200mm Hangar
- 70mm Lathed Axles
- Surf Key

Looking to sell this in _Lower Cont. 48 US ONLY_
The truck is basically brand new with a couple miles on it

A new set(pair) with surfkeys is $175 new, or (87.50 per truck), if you part together a single truck it comes out to $130~ without surf keys.

I'm offering a single truck, in basically new condition shipping included (see above restrictions) for $85

I'm pretty sure this was the fastest sale of an item on the forum... (with exception of free items of course)
