No offense, just pointing it out.  $123 shipping included. Apparently shipping quickly.  But granted, not US shipping... good luck on the sale.

So your asking price is like the item price at a Chinese bargain market? 

If not then put up something reasonable yourself and stop wasting peoples time,
nobody thinks $100 = $35- they just think its $12- off the retail price for a used item.

It's his FOCBOX, and his sale. He is not begging anyone to buy it from him. I don't understand how he is wasting time here.
