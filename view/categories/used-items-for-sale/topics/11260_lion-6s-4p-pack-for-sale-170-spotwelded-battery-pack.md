Will include an 80a fuse, xt90 antispark connector, 6s bms charger, charging port  connector and led. Looking for 220 shipped but will go for less all it needs is a bms or a charger. Current voltage of pack is 25.6 and its spotwelded with cell holders. pack only has 6 full recharges on it. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/7/77a99e9b63d4365edce52e1502ea886cf1942b20.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/5/f5113d5525bbd68d5aae416956c39d60c67297b7.JPG" width="375" height="500">

It was a minor short on the bms unfortunately I don't have a replacement and the one I would use with it isn't reliable. So rather than wait for one I'll just sell this and use an old lipo I have instead
