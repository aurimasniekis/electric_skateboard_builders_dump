EDIT BOARD IS SOLD!!!

Well I'm sad to say but time to move on to a new project. This board was an absolute dream, will do 40+mph without skipping a beat, and will out accelerate damn near anything out there. Completely turn key setup. Needs nothing. 

Easier to just check out my super detailed build thread here....

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/13s-evo-from-hell/41468/81

$1600 bucks and it's yours. (Buyer pays shipping) 

EDIT pictures added in this thread below...

Please forgive my total lack of experience using this forum. Im brand new to the site and haven't quite figured it out yet. Im interested in the board and possibly buying it from you but I have a couple questions. Is there a way I can message you directly?

Hey man. If you don't have enough post history I think they lock you out of doing a direct message potentially. Not sure though. If DM doesn't work just email me here :slight_smile:

Ah I gotcha. Yeah I can do that. Sorry been outta town for the past 4-5 days so things have been a bit crazy on my end. Here's some pictures from a recent 22mile ride we did... I'll try and get better pictures here soon. My board is the evo closest to the camera.

I would like to see more recent pics of the board, motors and underneath when you get a chance. Also how is the battery holding up and whats the braking like? 
Sounds like she is a speed demon.

@oo8moto @FranciscoV 

  Here‚Äôs some quick ones of it in the current state. Few changes as I swapped the base plates due to the torqueboard ones having slop in the kingpin. Was fine up until about 40mph and there was a slight wiggle I was uneasy about. These new ones might as well be welded. No slop at all and it‚Äôs dead solid at high speed. 

I had a spare brand new motor that I wasn‚Äôt doing anything currently with so I went ahead and changed it out with for the motor that had the most wear on it. 

The battery is super solid, had only been charged fully probably less than 10 times. Board overall has extremely low mileage (obvious) by the pictures. 

As far as braking goes there is no way to explain how much power this board has under acceleration and braking. It‚Äôs absurd....

I've most definitely met the match for my will... Respect.  

This much power almost needs a new kind of controller.

All: @pshaw is the real deal; this build is every bit as pro as my others.

[quote="bigben, post:21, topic:65264"]

[/quote]

It did :)

need to find an engineer who can produce me a controller where I can get a little more fine-grain control

I want to select modes on the fly faster, with a physical switch, that each have pre-set amounts of acceleration and braking 

(e.g., have a "gear" for accelerating out of curves that will take me from 20 to 27 MPH and then hold, and then another "gear" that will take me from 27 to 32 at a certain rate and then hold)

beautiful work, guys.  thank you.

Glad you are happy!!! Trust me just get some time with it you don‚Äôt need 2 ‚Äúgears‚Äù. You‚Äôll thumb will get Jedi like and will be able to control it within a mph! 

I thought the first thing when I first was getting used to it but then it comes quickly.

I had the same problem with torque control on a 4WD.  I bought the Maytech MTSKR1712, because it has a low and high power mode.  Then, I added on a stick extension with Sugru, and put a patch of grip tape on top of that.  Helped smooth things out a lot.  Low power mode is especially refined.  Could do more in Ackmaniac's settings, in the future.

Here's the last pic I took of it.  I added a bike bell as a trigger guard, and it started to look too much like a pistol, so I i had to paint it clown colors.  Have stripped that paint since this pic though.  Repainting in yellow to match TSG Pass.
