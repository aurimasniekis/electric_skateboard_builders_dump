Hi guys,

I'm getting out of the ESK8 game to spend more time with family + dog. So we're having an old fashioned yardsale, wohooooo!

There's stuff enough to go around for everyone ;-) Some of them are unused, some are lightly used.  The items are linked in the Google Sheet, and I will be maintaining the list as items are sold:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaorD-vzlTTTnyCYFNA-142XuMmQQDfOz6sAZQyEc0Y/edit?usp=sharing
Let me know if you want more pics or info.

Buyer pays shipping, all items are sold as-is and there will not be any refunds. 

Cheers,
Ronny

Don’t understand the two other questions. The bus is also unused.

Meter of charge? Voltage meter? It’s not in the package, I recommend you buy something that fits with intended ESCs or anti spark switch or just go with something that fits your build

Ok guys! I really want to get rid of the last items on the list. 

We have: 
* 1x Trampa Urban carver setup, with all the mechanical parts you need for a pneumatic dual drive (incl. motors) setup, a single drive street conversion, extra tires, belts, muck off bag is included (see list for full details)
* 1x esk8.de 10s5p Sony Konion VTC6 with quick charger
* 1x TSG protection set (large). I will wrap up all the TSG protection if you give me a decent offer on it. I'd rather sell it than have it sit here and collect dust
* 1x Winning min remote

Yeah sorry, on the esk8.de battery how many charge cycles? Does the battery have a BMS built it (i looked for this model on the esk8.de site and couldnt find it) ? Does the battery have a switch or a voltage meter, or an antispark/fuse?

TBH, I don't know if Attila has upgraded the build since I bought it, but here it goes:

It's basically this model, but mine does not have an integrated on/off:

* It has around 10 charge cycles on it
* It has a charge BMS
* There is a charging port that I made detachable
* It has industrial velcro "male" mounted on the bottom to fasten it
* There is no voltage meter included, you can just get any voltage meter for a 10s system
* Charger included
