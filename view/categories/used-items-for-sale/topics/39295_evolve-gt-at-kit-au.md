Hi, Selling my almost brand new Evolve AT kit for the Carbon/Bamboo GT.
Will ship Australia wide, but local buyers (around Sydney) preferred! Complete kit for $160 AUD.

Cheers<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/c/0c6179282dffd1eaa800960ccab1044aab11d699.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Shipping is really expensive from Australia. You can look that up under

from Sydney to wherever you are.

Cheers
