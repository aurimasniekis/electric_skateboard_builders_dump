Hey :smiley:
I'm selling my SPECTRA Mini Plus skateboard, I received it for free, used it twice, unlike what you can read on the internet I can make it work without the remote control (with the posture control system), but the problem is that the board is way, WAY too small for me, I am used to 1.5 meter boards so I can't find my balance and I keep falling, I give up: lol: 

New price 285€, sold 200€
I don't have the free bag that you can see on the website.

I will add pictures later

I live in France, but depending on where you live the shipping can actually be quite cheap in EU (with mondial relay for exemple).

This might not be the best place to sell something like this

It's generally accepted fine as long as it's not 3 times a day :smiley:
