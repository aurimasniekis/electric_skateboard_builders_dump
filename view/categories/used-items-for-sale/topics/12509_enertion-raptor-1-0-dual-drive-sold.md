I still do love the Raptor. Just look at the pictures of the dam thing its awesome, but need to fund another toy. Something needs to give. Not using it that much at moment and thought with Summer coming here in Aus soneone might want to see what all the fuss is about. Not going to sell it for cheaps as if I dont get a reasonable offer I wont sell it. Still selling my other Raptor parts. Only carbon deck, motors and few other bits there.

We have the same taste. Ive got 3 Aerons. Mine is the aluminium base one as well. No headrest. Is that the one from ebay. Always thought it should have come with one. Was thinking of getting one, but expensive to ship to aus as US seller.

The pictures dont really show off the CF that well and that grip tape hides alot of the top deck CF

Have a look here. Grip tape is fine just needs a bit of grip tape block cleaner.
