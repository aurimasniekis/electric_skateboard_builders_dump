Hi, I'm selling compenents of board I made, I have:

-Maytech 2x 95mm sensored hubmotors with trucks and front wheels  £190

-APS 2-12s 120A antispark switch + APS remote  £60

-APS 120A 2-12S V4 FACTORY ESC HV TWIN  £110 

Also I have red and white led lights and battery indicator but those are worth pennies so I'm gonna give them for free to anyone buying something. All items used, all items working, I drove very litlle on this setup. I prefer to sell few products at once because of shipping cost. All prices negotiable.

Feel free to contact me by PM or by leaving comment bellow :)
