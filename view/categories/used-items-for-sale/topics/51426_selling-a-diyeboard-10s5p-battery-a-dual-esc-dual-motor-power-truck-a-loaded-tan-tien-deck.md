Hey guys, I built this board a month ago electric skateboard after I finished building my first one.
I instantly noticed that this is too much power for me. Thats why I'm selling it! All the parts apart from the deck are from diyeboard and the deck is a loaded tan tien flex 3 board.
I'm selling all the parts separately, if you want to buy the complete it would cost 550€.
there weren't any problems with the board.
Pm me if you're interested ( I'm located in Vienna, Austria) I could ship it out to you just ask me how much it would cost...

I dont want to be toxic, or anything like that, but [this](http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-360wh-battery-esc-dual-motor-belt-drive-power-truck-kit-p-590.html) diyeboar kit has everything as you do and it is way cheaper :) 

It does not include Tan Tien though :/

The only thing that gives the board some value is the deck. Rest is generic.

I instantly noticed that this is too much power for me.

Ok, I actually needed to pay about 60 € for taxes.
I know that it is a bit overpriced but I could go down with the price and sell the parts separately if someones interested.

I was just making a suggestion is all.  Most people are looking to build their own version of a electric skateboard.  Quite a few other users have sold their premade boards for much less than what they put into it.  That's why I suggested selling the parts.

Can you eventually put a list with price per part? I am interested in most parts but it all depends how much you will ask for it.
