Asking for $40 shipped, so basically $32

I used these for less than 100 miles and my OCD of keeping my motors leveled  just didnâ€™t work out. After 10 miles they would not be aligned. I think you have to commit to red loctite for these to truly be secure. 

I can ship you the extra set of idlers bolt and screw. Just gotta dig them up since I used single and 330mm belts with 16/36 teeth gearing

If you can figure out a way to add a cross bar. That would be great becuase this happens with blue loctite.
