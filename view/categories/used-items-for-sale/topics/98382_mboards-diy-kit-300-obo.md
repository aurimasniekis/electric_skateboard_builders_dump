One of the motors is out of line.  You need to check your motor bolts before offering this up for sale my friend.  Make sure that that is all thats wrong here.

shouldn't you be getting more range on a 10s3p 30Q battery?

unless these are non-30Q cells?

Throw it on ebay, 5 day no reserve 1$ start and repost the ebay link to craigslist, facebook marketplace and here. Make sure it ends on a weekend at about 5PM and you'll probably get $300
