Hi all,

I’m putting up for sale my Photon, with the latest receiver for $120 shipped in the Cont US Lower 48 only. If you are outside of this the price is $115 + shipping. But would prefer to keep it domestic.

The remote is in complete working order, never been dropped, and was used for about 10-15 miles totals. I am no longer using the remote, as the side to side play of the joystick does not bode with me well above 30mph. However, It’s a wonderful remote for a cruiser, and has the latest firmware already updated.

You will receive
Photon Remote
New Receiver
Connection cables bought extras from eBay as well so x10 of them 
USB cable supplied with the remote.

Here’s footage of it working.

If you fell both hands would have something in them OK.. so lets say you droped them real quick,
you're then falling face in what Now Maybe protect your head but putting your hands in plank position,
But wait Your only wearing a t-shirt You would rip the skin off your arms.  

Get this the people who ride down hills at 40mph without a t-shirt are safer than you.

I’d rather have a remote with 2 speed modes so other people can ride my boards and am not a fan of the joy stick thumb trigger.
