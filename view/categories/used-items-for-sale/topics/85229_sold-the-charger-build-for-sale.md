[/quote]

For the benefit of anyone interested, I'll be heading to SF/Hawaii from 22 March to 2 Apr and hence can bring the board with me to save on shipping (Local shipping as opposed to International, for the US folks.)

 No AVIO drive with this sale? That was a huge part of what made this build so awesome. Really wish I had the money to take this off your hands. So sexy.

The Avio urethane drive requires the use of larger wheels. Wanted this build to be smaller, 90mm wheels and henve a belt drive haha. (:

That's why a shortboard with weight will be good for this application. 10s3p battery with a dual drive can be used to swing and knock out potential kidnappers. **not a marketing scheme**
