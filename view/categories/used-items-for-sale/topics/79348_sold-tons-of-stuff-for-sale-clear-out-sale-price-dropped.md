I'm not big on top pricey brands but I do believe you get what you pay for when dealing with electronics. Was looking @ one around $300. There are a few I like in that price just cant pull a trigger on one.

I've got to flux drive 6374s. One needs a new can or the magnets remounted. The other one has a new can and runs well @ 12s. Was going to use them on a dual build but scored some more appropriate ones for it. 

And actually, I have a set of, I believe, sk3 5055s. Haven't hooked them up yet. Was an impulse buy.
