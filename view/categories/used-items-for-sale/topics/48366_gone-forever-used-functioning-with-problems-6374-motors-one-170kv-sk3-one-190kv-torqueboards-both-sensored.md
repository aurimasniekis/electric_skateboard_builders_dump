GONE - @Mobutusan got em, please yell at him if you're upset 

you can have both for $35 shipped.  but you have to take both.

they're working fine, but both have some noise coming from them.

the sk3 is 170kv 6374 sensored, i think it's worn bearings.

the tb is 190kv 6374, i think something inside the barrel is scraping against the strator.

both are just guesses.

send $35 friend and family to igbad@hotmail.com and i'll ship out next day.

i'm sorry, it would not make sense to ship to EU, too costly.
