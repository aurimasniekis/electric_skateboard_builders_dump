For sale are a pair of Evolve Trucks.

I used them for 3 rides of 7-10 miles so they are in almost new condition, see photos.

Selling for 95 Euros, shipping is a fair whack though at 20—25 euro depending on if you want tracking or not (Postnord). Shipping to US $22.5

Any additional photos etc, let me know.
