Dudes, my car has shit itself and the Baja is the only thing I have worth selling so I can fix the car.

Bought brand new for $5500 at the start of the year. Has done about 600kms.

Comes with:
Alloy remote
Charger
Added grab bar
Vicious grip
Loads of belts
Spare tube
Spare tyre
Other random spares

The board has a slight creaking sound coming from the front end that has not affected performance. Has been looked at by Bajaboard and given the OK.

Only selling due to my car being about to implode and need cash fast, very regretful sale.

Will get some more photos up tonight!![20190922_215950|374x500](upload://gq32zdmvvaYHzC9voTlLdH27KhU.jpeg)

Can't you use this to get to work, instead of the car?  It's also less pollution :+1:

Wtf? I work in construction bro, I can't pick and choose where the next building needs to be built.

Try to be less opinionated, you come across as an ass hat.
