I bought this for my kid a little over a year ago. He wore it once, didn’t like it and it’s been sitting in his bedroom ever since. He is wanting some new gear, so I told him I’d put it up for sale. I am listing it as used, but it has literally been worn once, never ridden in, as near as I can tell it’s near perfect.

He wants $225 + shipping ($22 anywhere in the US). The cheapest I have I’ve found is $249 + shipping. If he can’t get that I’ll probably just keep it and use it myself.

It comes with removable cheek pads, clear visor, x2 mirror visors and carry bag. See pics for details.
