I have an Onda board that I was going to motorize but can't get behind the trucks.

When I ride the board around unpowered and hit anything like a curb cut it has unsettling kickback behavior. It really doesn't want to cross a curb cut for example at 45 degrees but behaves better going 90 degrees to the transition.  That is nice but one cannot always hit a transition square.

Sure can install black bushings but then it barely turns.

Anyone in the market for a Onda Longa with Turbokit (ebay) motor mount? essentially new condition. Save a lot over retail.

PM me if interested
