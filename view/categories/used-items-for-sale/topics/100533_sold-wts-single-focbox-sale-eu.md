Selling 3x fully refurbished FOCBOX.

They all are fully working without any issues. The vescs are checked and tested completly and come all with a new enclosure and heatsink. They are like new devices. 

I sell 2x (1.6v and 1.7v) for 80â‚¬ + shipping each. (SOLD) 

And 1x (1.3v) for 70â‚¬ + shipping

I think the price is fair for what you get :slight_smile:

What's the difference between the higher and lower voltage one? Are they coming from different batches or they were just like that by default?

haha I don't mean to disparage but you actually made me laugh from a simple mix-up. It's not voltage, it's hardware revision. As for the difference, I'll let the seller/others more knowledgeable than me answer that. 

Again, no ill feelings have a nice a day :slight_smile:
