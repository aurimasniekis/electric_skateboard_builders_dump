I left my battery on and drained it completely rendering it useless. Don’t have the time or motivation to source a battery when I don’t ride very much so am looking to sell up and cut my losses.

Feel free to make me an offer in a private message on any remaining parts.

I will post at buyers expense and happy to negotiate prices if you want multiple parts. All of it is barely used, would be about a year old but wouldn’t have done more than 50-100km.

Cheers
