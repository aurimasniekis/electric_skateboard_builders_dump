Lost most interest in DIY, and haven't been able to sort the money out for a battery for this build so trying to sell it. (wasn't prioritized high enough either)

Most parts are brand new, some of them have some run hours on them but it's minimal and those who have been used prior has been restored so they look as good as they can without being replaced.

The motor has some tape over it to protect it while I was building it, motor wires are cut to size for the riser pad.

Comes with everything you need to have a solid well working board other than the battery, even metr module skate-tool, and a charger (10S 42V 2Amp).


Parts list:

Deck: Unikboards 29" (Brand new)
Enclosure: Unikboards Enclosure + Gasket/Seal (Brand new)
Trucks: Caliber II Custom painted + Black Hangers (Hanger's brand new)
Wheels: Orangatang Kegels 80A (2 Wheels brand new the back wheels have been used for 20 - 30 miles)
Bearings: Red Bones (Brand new)
Riserpad: SWITCHBLADE E-RISER PAD (Brand new and wired up for dual motor)
Griptape: Lasercut vicious with logo

Motor: Eskating.eu 190KV 6374 3550W (Brand new)
Motor mount: Enertion
Vesc: Torqueboards 4.12 (Repaired and checked by MartinSP)
Gearing: 13T/36T 12mm Kegel Drive Wheel Kit
Bluetooth: Metr (Brand new)
Remote: TorqueBoards 2.4ghz Nano Remote 
Switch: OPK/Unikboards Anti-spark (Brand new)

All it needs is a 10s3p battery pack and its up and running. (Might also need to swap the VESCs XT90 out with an XT60 but might do it before sale if I get my solder in the mail)

Not looking to part it out unless I have a buyer for most of the things, paid a lot of money not expecting to get all my money back but if I'm able to get a good amount its fine with me since I'm trying to save up for a used Boosted V1.


It's located in Denmark, pickup or shipped no problem.

I would prefer to be paid in a way where I won't have to wait weeks to get my money so either bank transfer Mobilepay (Danish) or anything else like that would be preferred or even cash at pick-up.

If I missed out on anything please let me know, or if you need better pictures.

Parting out will for sure be easier to sell and a bit faster, but i already did it once and sadly had more parts left then parts sold so lost a lot that time :(

@Lumaci has been around for a minute or two, he can probably best decide on how to sell his gear.

Do you have any asking price for whole setup or if it is sold in parts?

If anyone wants it as a complete ready to go board i can buy a battery pack for around 270 - 280 depends on what cells wanted and smack in and set the vesc up and tune in it.

Shipping price will be higher but it will be ready to go for a total price of around 750 (With shipping)

I know its way more poweful and will have so much longer range and all, but i really like Boosted.

Wanted to repair my old V1 Dual+ but honestly not worth even considering so really want to get a new V1.

Basement yeah, and nothing worth it in.

The deck is really beat up, motors are broken and beat up esc is broken battery is from the time where they had charge problems.

Was planning on just making it look nice and hang on a longboard holder for show.

@lumaci Maybe I would be interested in the battery, would you be willing to sell it? It is probably quite old and beaten am I right? :)

Most cells in it are dead and the enclosure is pretty broken or scratched, but id like to keep it and go over it one day and make it look nice while i still have access to a car paint workshop. :-) 

Only selling the Unik.

I just finished my build, one month ago I would have taken everything w/o think about it. To me your parts are 1000 times better than the mini boosted.

They indeed are, but Boosted offers something my DIY will never get.

Thats crazy good customer support and the name Boosted :/

I am not judging your choice. That was only my opinion. To me the spud deck is the best looking one for a short deck. I personally do not care about the brand name. I like to have something "unik" (word pun :rofl: ) than a stock board. Not saying that Boosted is not a good board. A bit overpriced but as the other on the market.
