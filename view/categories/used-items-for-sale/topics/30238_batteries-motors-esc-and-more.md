Hey guys, 
Was trying to build a eBoard that is no longer needed. Due to the design troubles (3D fabrication) and lack of necessary, I decided to end the project. Board was never fully assembled or ridden. Electronics were only setup to test motor mounts and pulleys.

I have 1x new and 1x basically brand new, Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5055-280kv Brushless Outrunner Motors for sale. Brand new, they are $50 a piece but will sell them both for $80 ($40/ea).

1x new motor:[**SOLD**]
-Box opened 
-never been used, connected to an ESC or modified
-no connectors

1x basically new motor:[**SOLD**]
-Connected to ECU and less then 15 mins run time.
-Will clip the current connectors (no connectors)

1x Wii Receiver setup [Make an offer]

I can provide pictures or videos of parts later today if anyone request. I believe prices are reasonable but I am negotiable. Trying to reclaim some money from this project. Let me know if you have any questions.
Located in USA and would prefer to not ship internationally.

Sorry for the confusion but it reads " New, they are $50 a piece but will sell them both for $80 **($40/ea)**"

So, the motors are $40 each. Priced to sell.

Make me an offer on the whole lot, I'll throw in free shipping.

I honestly haven't though about shipping cost but it can't cost to much. Figure up to $10 for shipping for the batteries. If its more, I'll eat the rest. Can send you a picture of shipping receipt. 

I'll add a picture of the Wii remote and receiver when I get home later today.

Wii remove, Wii receiver and the receiver chip. The two parts connect to each other but it is highly suggested that you solder the connections. Plenty of walk throughs on the forums.
