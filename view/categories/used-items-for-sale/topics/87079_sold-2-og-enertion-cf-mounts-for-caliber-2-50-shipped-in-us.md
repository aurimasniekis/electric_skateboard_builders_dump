Rare mounts for sale. $25 each seems like a good price. PM me....I have three of these so if anyone wants a single one, let me know too. $50 for the pair $30 for the single (because the single is NEW)

Very interested!!  I would need 2 of them.. what size motors and trucks do these work with... Also, what would be my wheel options with these unique motor mounts? What day work with the Trampa trucks??  Do you still have any other parts for sale?  Also, are these belt-driven mounts or chain?

Short answer is NO, NO, NO and NO!

Details:

-Specifically for Caliber 2 trucks or E-Caliber 2.

-Any 63XX motors will work, restriction is mostly from the width of your hanger.

-Does NOT fit on TB218 without some dremel work since TB is a bit bigger.

-Does NOT fitTrampa Trucks

-NO more parts I'm looking to sell

-Belt or Chain doesn't have much to do with a motor mount, it has to do with the belt pulley or chain sprocket.

Pretty sure these fit well to @torqueboards 218 trucks? I had some clones fitted to some no problems.

@bigben Oh yeah. Is stand corrected. I forgot that TB218 are bigger but the not fitting issue was with Caliber mount clamps that were NOT designed to split (BKB's for example) into two like the Enertion ones are. So theoretically they should fit

_"The dog dances for the money"_ (old saying fom my native country... pardon my french, Mike :rofl:)

I bet one eye, that at some point in history those mounts hold these beauties I 'inherited' from @Mikenopolis ....

![IMG_20190209_170231|690x388](upload://i4R2gvo6yqtkNU5GNsU9ND1Yaqy.jpeg) 

![IMG_20190208_144027|281x500](upload://E9YXqWEEuJ7l7ctzHQ6UwuevJl.jpeg) 

So, hurry up girls, free Mike from the burden or I must 'inherit' those mounts too!

PS: got two different TB 63mm reverse mounts right now. If someone take those out of my hands, you will solve my problems and I can take Mike's mounts to divert those for my Pintsil 218 trucks instead.

Got this (TB 63mm Reversed Mount for crossbar and idlers) by some mistake...

![IMG_20190311_231233|690x388](upload://sFPNtVzVDD8bgwiaCUXZsA6rBaW.jpeg) 

...and also got that one (classic TB 63mm Reversed Mount)...

![IMG_20180425_091035|690x388](upload://hwa5iGz2TFYR6iA1R7gG7psQkQI.jpg) 

But both mounts are slightly different and never been used. Don't want 'em. If any of you take both out of my hands then Mike's mounts are mine!

BTW. Did I tell you about those long bolts on the motor shaft? I was advised that the grub/set screw would come loose so I added those on top to the set screw with blue loctite so they don’t back out.

No prblm Mike. I assumed thats what you did, because normally those grub screws are smaller. If you did it was for a good reason, no? Thanks man. You are gonna make someone happy with those mounts. They are museum quality. Next time my friend.

PS: yo people, forget my offer for the reversed mounts. That was in case I got Mike's carbon Enertions. But they went south so mine are no contest now.
