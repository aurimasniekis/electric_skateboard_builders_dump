Hey guys, so my boosted boards battery died over the winter when I had it in storage. I'm pretty salty at the limited options I have to fix it, so I'm just looking to sell it as is. Has a little less than 400 miles on it. I did try the treadmill trick with no luck.

It comes with the charger, remote, and board. The battery case was opened to test the battery. Esc and motors should be working fine.

Taking offers. I don't really want to part out unless if I can sell everything.

Can't you just replace the battery?

Boosted v1 has a non replaceable battery. The bms interacts with the esc, so you also can't stick any other battery on there.

Couldn't you replace the battery and ESC? Even just a cheap Chinese $50 esc

Shipping to Latvia would be about $100, but I could ship it there. PM if that sounds alright.

Sorry, not interested, but you really could change the battery to 10s2p 30q, buy cheap Chinese ESC and make a bigger buck from the board
