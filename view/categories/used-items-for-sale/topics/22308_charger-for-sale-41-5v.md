"High Power" 36v (nominal) charger. It's output can be adjusted slightly. I have it set to 41.5v unloaded and it charges the battery to 41.3v. You could adjust it back to 42v or I can before shipping but the lower cutoff is better for battery life.

Also, can potentially help with vesc shutdown errors due to braking with a fully charged battery. 

Asking $65 shipped obo.

Is this still available? What would be the difference between getting this and something like this https://www.amazon.com/EVAPLUS-Adapter-PowerFast-3-Prong-Connector/dp/B01HXMY0TE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494307978&sr=8-1&keywords=42v+charger

Yes, still available. 

The one you linked is a cheap hoverboard charger. They usually have an output voltage of 42.2-42.3v 

The benefit of the one I am selling is that you are not charging the batteries all the way to 42v and this extends the life of the pack. Table 4 on this page http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries

To add to this, every .1v you drop from full charge doubles cycle life.
