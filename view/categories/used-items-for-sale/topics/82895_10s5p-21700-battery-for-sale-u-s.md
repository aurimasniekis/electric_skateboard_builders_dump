Selling a battery pack I made using efest 21700 purple 35a 3.7ah cells. Specs 120amp continuous, 18.5ah capacity, custom pcb (thanks to akhlut) with flat tinned copper braid cable for series connections, 10awg to 5.5mm bullet connectors. Shrink wrapped in black pvc. $500 plus shipping U.S

This pack has 9 recharge cycles and has been a steady performer landing me in 5th place at the barret junction race just under stooge boards, doctor mike and ollin's 12s boards. 19 miles of range with an average speed of 25.8mph on 8inch knobbies and a 3.3.1 gearing, 165lbs rider. This is my fourth pack and I really enjoy building them. This time I've decided to build a 12s version using a different format of cells. Thus I'm selling this one to finance perfecting my craft and to keep the mrs. Off my back. ![20190110_133734|374x500](upload://1kneSLXBTuZfm8orhe7SVzOb15s.jpeg) ![20190110_161609|666x500](upload://yGhTU9k80S0n2OOZGi0GbOlbKmo.jpeg)

He used 21700 cells, so I guess
5x5x21= length 
70x2 = widths 
Plus some mm for nickel and shrink wrap.

Bump for price drop. Battery still at 9 cycles, I can change the 5.5mm bullet connectors to xt connectors if you need.

I made two of these batteries identical in construction. Im currently using one of them as my daily driver. The second one was only used 4 times to range test, 3 times durring the races at barret junction. And two times at 60% discharge. Sense then its been sitting at storage voltage and I check it every week. Price is still $500. Its a solid and proven build.
