I wanted to try that remote for a long time, my mini remotes are the most reliables but they are bulky, the Enertion nano X remote is also nice but only on the weak Raptor 2, on a powerful esk8 you need more trigger range

@Eboosted in case this is not working out for you, I have a new one I sell for 45$ plus 5$ shipping 
Used once on the bench, didn’t liked the travel of the trigger. It’s too short for my fat fingers.

I just need to figure out how to use the feather remote internals on a finger trigger style remote... put it in that remote enclosure.... and have the coolest remote ever :smile:

Whereabouts in Canada?
Did I see this remote on KIJIJI like 2 months ago?

Used for about 1-2 charges so fairly unused.
