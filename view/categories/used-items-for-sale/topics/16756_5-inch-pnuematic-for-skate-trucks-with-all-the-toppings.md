Decided on full on mountain board so going to purge a bit of material.


I have a complete dual kit of Enertion Aluminum pnuematic 5 inch rims - THESE FIT SKATE TRUCKs!!, gears, bolts, belts and 15 tubes and 14 tires ( with two different types of tread).

These have been run with a single motor for maybe 200km. I bought out Alien all terrain tire when there was a shortage on skikes and they were marked down stupid low .....Looks like he found another supplier though.

The Enertion tires are more durable but slower  and Aliens Skike wear out quicker, hence the investment in tubes and tires. 

Carving on these is awesome, I ran mine setup as a single at the time. I only had one ECS. With the Enertion 6355 and 8s  5000msh lipos I was getting 6-7 km and speeds of up to 28 km/hr and carving was sick. I liked the feel more than with Thane.

I'm in Spain. 
I'd like to get â‚¬250 plus shipping for the whole lot.....But make an offer, the worst I can say is no thanks.

Here is the board with the setup mounted.

Enertion rubber is wider and better tread for off road, the smooth skinny Skikes roll better on flats...Pardon my Hobbit feet

Alright people, moving some stuff so let's knock 100 euros off my asking price.....

150 euros for the wheels,  drive train pulleys and belt, stupid amount of tires and tubes. Anyone looking for an all terrain setup this is the money shot.

Buyer pays shipping but this is like 350 worth of merch at less than half price. Come on, someone wants it.
