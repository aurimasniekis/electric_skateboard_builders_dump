Hey guy's,

I have:

 - Rayne Reaper Gosha - Painted black ( paints flaking but in excellent condition )
 - 2x BKB 6374 190kv with 15mm pulleys and keyway
 Forum Member Mounts with pulleys  new in packaging
- Evolve F1 Abec 11 107's
- remaining drive train ( Torqueboard extended trucks, Reverse mounts with C style clamps ** stripped mount screws, in tight  but both motors are slightly misaligned can be drilled and tapped if needed ** will include Enertion 12mm pulleys )
