I will give the buyer the option for a benchwheel remote or a feather remote for an extra $70. Its pretty much sealed watertight. But there is a gap where the cables come out.

Here are some pics I took right now. It’s scratched at the bottom but they’re minor and I just rub some polish and it’ll be spunky fresh. 

Also note that the battery meter is cracked. I can put in a new one upon request for free.
