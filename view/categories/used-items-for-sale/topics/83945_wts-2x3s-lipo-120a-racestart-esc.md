Hey guys

Trying to reduce the number of unused items that I have.

4000mAh 60C Lipo from [Banggood](https://usa.banggood.com/ZOP-Power-11_1V-4000mAh-3S-60C-Lipo-Battery-XT60-Plug-p-1104629.html?p=HB2313087411201210MC&custlinkid=148475) - two of them (they are slightly different in size)
120A Racestar RC car ESC also from [Banggood](https://usa.banggood.com/Racerstar-120A-ESC-Brushless-Waterproof-Sensorless-18-RC-Car-Part-p-1085232.html?p=HB2313087411201210MC&custlinkid=148478), good for 6s . The phase wires are cut (see pic) and the momentary switch was extended so the ESC can be mounted inside an enclosure.

I will throw in a wired 6s BMS to help with charging

These were in my early board, and saw something like 10 cycles. 
Everything works.

Selling because I don't use them anymore.

Make me an offer, shipping in US

Thanks,
Dani
