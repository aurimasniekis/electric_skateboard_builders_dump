Hello all,

I'm selling two Enertion VESCS. One is still in its original bag, the other was used for a duration of less than two hours.  Long story short, I bought them but enertion took forever to ship them, one of them died due to the power cable puncture thing, and I only got a replacement a few weeks ago.

I'm looking to sell both 4.12 VESCs with FREE, Insured and Signatured shipping within the USA for $200.
So thats $90/VESC + $20 Shipping via USPS.

As usual, just PM me or reply here.

- Ken

Do these vescs have the xt60 connector on the cap board ? Also do they include the beefed up upgrades to the board ?  Not sure if Jason ever did those upgrades but remember there being some talk about that a while back

I only have one enertion VESC left and its $85/VESC as last negotiated.
Free $50 shipping insurance + Tracking, no signature verification for $85.
It is new and unopened. It has an XT60 on one end but no bullets on the other.

There is First Class Shipping too. It is only like $3. No point in using Priority for this. It also has tracking.

3 days, firm box to prevent it from getting crunched.  I believe $6 is worth it.

You try juggling engineering school, a social life, work and occasionally checking this forum. Clearly my earlier efforts on the forum didn't go where i wanted either.  Sorry my existence from the early days clutters your present day existence. Furthermore, Enertion quality control sucks - I had to RMA the second VESC out of the bag because of the short with the server header.

Buy Maytechs - at least you won't have to wait months for an RMA or have to pay inflated shipping prices for a unprofessionally assembled product.  Just my 2Â¢.

Plus, you should always read to the bottom of a listing before reply.  Unless you only read the titles like the new US Admin. seems to be in the habit of.
