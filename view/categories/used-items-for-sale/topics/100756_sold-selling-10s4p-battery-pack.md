Selling used 10s4p battery pack that I ordered from Hyperionsystems in February of this year but started using it in April after completing my build. With roughly 20+ cycles hasn’t hit it’s prime so still alotta life to be had for this pack. There is a tear in the shrinkwrap but I secured it with kapton tape and tested with no problems.
Price $245 shipped only in the US from Chesapeake, VA.

-10s4p Samsung 30Q battery pack purchased from Hyperionsystems.  Roughly 20+ cycles.  13"x 6" or 17.5" x 6" with BMS extended.

Had requested clear shrink wrap cause I wanted to see the batteries. Real quality built pack IMO.
