Give me an offer for the mounts. The enclosure will fit two 3s lipos 5000mah in series and an esc and receiver. Probably best for a single motor setup but you might be able to squeeze two in.

Hey @psychotiller @Kaly @mackann @trampa I just saw Fatdaddy's Instagram post. They claim to be the main eboard retailer in the EU. They said they'd want to partner up with you to sell with them. What do you think?

They mainly store Evolve. Jonifin literally told them that nobody likes Evolve anymore and that they should buy your stuff haha

I guess they'd liquidate their stock and bulk purchase yours, hmm? That's how the free market works laddee

Problem is that a store like that is asking for a price around 50-60% of the store price. And the profit for the producer is not even close to that kind of numbers for "diy boards"

Mainstream...Let's see. Mass produce one board made of the first version of every single part you started your campaign with. The dollar being more important than ride quality. Genius. 

A small group of people make a bunch of money, every customer that bought one gives up on the piece of crap they bought weeks or months later figures out they should have bought an LHB, Kaly, Ollin Or Psychotiller build. Reason? We keep innovating and upgrading every time we build a board (We can do that!) 
Mainstream slings the same tired shit over and over again.  I know you get it @dareno

There are a couple people that need to get off my lawn though.

Yeah @Skunk just reminded me of that shitðŸ˜‚

I deleted it so I wouldn't be embarrassed anymore, but I guess you guys caught it. 
The bio was from last year when I knew nothing about the electric skateboard industry, but really wanted to make money off it, so I was basically going to do a "group buy" of the SYL-08 and make some profit on that. Obviously it fell through. I never go on Linkedin anymore, so thanks for catching that. Super embarrassed thoðŸ˜…
