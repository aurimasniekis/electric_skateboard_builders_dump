So let me get this straight just so I understand.  You have disassembled 4 vescs and are now asking $73 each for someone to reassemble said vescs to continue your research into whether the cap upgrade works?   Not sure thats a very good deal.  Could be wrong though.

Erm no I did know what cap works because I had a recent thread and I have moved twords focboxes

[/quote]

Actually it wasn't the reason why I had disassembled them it was because I intended to use two on my Spud and 2 on my mini build but never got to it and just used a cheap esc substitute

And partially because my antispark kept failing so I never finished my buildðŸ¤£

are you selling these with 10awg wire and xt90's and bullet connectors? because if someone wanted to buy these and assemble them they would also have to buy those parts and at that point would you not buy it from @torqueboards for $85 assembled?

I can include all the parts and assemble them...

I have a shit load of 5.5mm and xt 90 (the kind that won't melt)

Ill just drop the price because I'm too lazy.


**_68$ shipped_**

Ouch, hope you recover, if there is instructions I could probably do it myself, any idea if it would work with this [800W motor](https://www.miromax.lt/en/m-6/c-39/c-45-brushless_bldc_motor_with_permanent_magnet/product-52-three-phase_permament_magnet_motor_800w_blt-800#tog109). It is 3 phase and has the Hall sensors so it should work.

No, those motors have too high a kv.  You want a motor kv of 190 or less.  (100 to 190)  That one is 1100 I think
```

## \#14 Posted by: AlanZhou Posted at: 2019-02-06T23:51:47.504Z Reads: 87

only 140-230kv for 10s belts and 120kv below for hubs 10s

cant immagine 100kv on belt :rofl:

isn't Kv, ERPM/Voltage? (1333/48 = 28)
```

?? huh no i think its more complicated to find kv,

but erpm is **_v times kv= erpm_**

lower kv= lower torque but there is a logical limit...

noone would use a 1kv motor/

![image|690x74](upload://vMfE4JHgFdWTMlV0EHBnhuQp1kM.png)  
So in this case at a rpm of 1100:
kv = erpm/V 
1333 / 48 
= 28

also these seem to have plenty of torque

but this is an 800W motor at 48V it shouldn't exceed 25A which the Vesc should handle (nvm just read the edit)

usually our motors clock in at 55k erpm

with conventional wheels and a 1:1 ratio you are correct, but I am running 14in wheels and a 3:1 ratio

My bad, was looking at the wrong plan, it will be a 1:1 with the 14in wheels (If I use that motor). But dw, I have already opened a topic asking about this motor, so don't respond unless you want to (to me I mean)

Can confirm; 100kv on belts is torquey as a mofo.  Rip your shoes off

100kv or below for Hubs. ...sweet spot for belt driven is between 140kv to 190kv for good balance (between speed & torque).  ...200kv is aceptable (for speedier) .... up to 245kv under certain conditions (speedier controled with big pulley ratios).

Just solder them together while plugged-in.  The pins stay perfectly straight.  Even Amass brand ones.  Solder while mated.  It also helps pull the heat out while it's cooling.
