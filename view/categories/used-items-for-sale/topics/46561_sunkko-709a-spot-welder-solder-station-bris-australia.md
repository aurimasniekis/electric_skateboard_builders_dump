Copper might have too low a resistance to weld effectively like this

My guess is that 60a will not be enough to weld copper or maybe it would if the copper is thin enough.
Also the electrodes are copper and would need to be replaced with maybe tungsten electrodes.

Iv'e never seen tungsten electrodes used for resistance welding so I'm not sure how that would work.
