THIS IS NOT MY THREAD, POSTING FOR SOMEONE ELSE

ANY PRODUCT INQUIRIES SHOULD BE SENT TO @PixelatedPolyeurthan, I won't answer your PMs if you msg me 

Link to thread on .news: https://forum./t/wts-eu-worldwide-focbox-unity-evolve-stuff-abec-97mm-great-price/13406?u=sn4pz


I have a huge amount of things to sell, Basically need to funds for a board I am going to sell shortly.

I can ship worldwide. If there are multiple buyers from the same country (ex. US) then we can discuss via PM collective shipping to reduce costs for everyone.
Some prices might be better or worse depending on where you live (ex.abec wheels below).

Prices are in Euro, Shipping is not included, prices for shipping are like usual depending on the size and weight of the item. Expect like 15 for a set of wheels for example inside the EU.

**100Euro**  ABEC 97mm Superfly+2x evolve 32t wheel pulleys. Everything includes bearings (10 in total)
About 5km total use, the top left wheel has slightly removed ABEC logo but other than 5km of use and some minor visual defects on the logos, they are new.

**25Euro**  2x evolve 66t AT wheel pulley+2x evolve blue AT knobby tyres (15km) (no tubes) + 2x evolve stock 66t Belts Quite used but still very functional (i can’t find out the exact length)
Bearings in Pulleys are included.

These were the front tyres, the back ones are trash because I was discovering what standstill burnouts were lol, but these are still perfect as you can see in the photos.

**115Euro**  2x Evolve GT Trucks (front and back!)+Evolve 55xx motor mount+New never used Evolve 95a Reflex Formula bushings installed.

These are in quite a good condition. There is the occasional inevitable scratch but I photographed everything in detail so you can see for yourself.
I have also repainted 2 little spots on each hanger but this is just behind the bolt of the kingpin so totally invisible and I also sanded & repainted the motor mounts as they had a few scratches.
All of this is with quality spray paint and multiple fine layers so this isn’t just some crappy paint job for hiding esthetics defects but a rework to make things feel new.
Trust me if I say this it is so you don’t buy it and then think ‘‘oh he covered up visual defects to make things look new without my knowledge’’.

**250 Euro**   **SOLD**  New never used Focbox Unity. This does not include 3.5mm bullet connectors or power on switch because I am using them but if you need an MT30 or whatever just PM me and I will send you some for free with the Unity. If it doesn’t work then send it back and I will give a full refund. I have never tested it.

**15Euro**   **(SOLD)**  Maytech Remote. Receiver included of course. I used it once for bench testing. The scatches are from me reaching over for it on my boards and dragging it all over the griptape LOL.

**30Euro**  Evolve GTX Case+charge port & power button.
No JST connector on the charge port, I will include one when they arrive
(fuck eBay’s long shipping from china)
The heat sink has also been repainted with heat resistant primer and then black paint (multiple coats of each). It also has four holes (see picture) where I had a Unity in place but that is plugged with heat resistant epoxy. Yeah, I am smart, I know :wink:

**10Euro**  Fucked up Evolve ESC. Maybe one of the halves work. It just stopped working (would not turn on) and I can’t see any visual damage. I also sent it over to @seaborder but he can’t spot anything wrong either so very salvageable I think.
