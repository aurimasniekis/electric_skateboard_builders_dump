if you need the belts i will give you those.

if you don't have a mtb i have a brand new one not really for sale but could be negotiated.

Thanks, 90cm long. how does it feel under your feet? I am looking into MTB but I am short (170cm) and I am afraid the popular offerings have too wide a stance for me.  Sorry for the off topic.

Scrub. Those pulleys are specific for those hubs. I guess many chinese wheels use the same shape.

No, not exactly the same screws pattern. They are compatible with the real dirt board i posted and most chinese wheels.
Btw price drop time. They have to go.
NEW PRICE
80 euro  wheels+pulleys.
