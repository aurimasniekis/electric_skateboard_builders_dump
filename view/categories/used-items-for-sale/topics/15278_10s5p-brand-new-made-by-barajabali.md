I have a 10s5p battery for sale. Built with Samsung batteries with anti-spark switch, on off button, battery gauge display, Bms, brand-new which I don't need because I bought a complete setup. They retail for $540. Willing to let it go for 440.

@barajabali @unikboards

Jerry wants the 4x4 EVO beta boards identical for testing and filming promo vids tho.. which is understandable... grateful to be on one t- minus 30 days :slight_smile:  (the perks of living in LA)
