Selling my Samsung 25R 10s2p because am looking to upgrade.  
Came with my Meepo NLS that I got last month. I have 2 packs, I've only cycled each about 6 times.
Good upgrade for budget boards still running the Samsung 20R.

I really dont know any of the battery terms.
It measures 40mm height x 98mm width x 140mm length if that helps in determining your question.
