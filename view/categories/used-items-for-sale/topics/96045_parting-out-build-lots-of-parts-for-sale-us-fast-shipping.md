Iâ€™m parting out my build. Selling everything besides the deck, wheels, and trucks. General rule of thumb is click the link to whatâ€™s being sold and subtract $10-$30 from their listing price. If you donâ€™t think thatâ€™s fair, just DM me, Iâ€™m open to all offers. All of these things have been used for less than 30 miles.

The battery was built by @thisguyhere and is very safe. It is heat shrinked. Itâ€™s clear heat shrink. The tape is electrical and just holds the wires down.

I donâ€™t like voltage control. I prefer the boostedâ€™s control where full throttle = full speed and acceleration is determined by how fast you move the throttle. If I want to go half speed I just go half throttle on a Boosted, I also just prefer how smooth it is. There were also vibration issues on my board I spent days trying to figure out and couldnâ€™t.

i feel both of these are things you can fix, but you're a grown person, do as you please.

i was the opposite.  i got a boosted first, thought it was shit - so went diy.  maybe boosted boards have come a long way, i had the v2.

It looks like all you tried to do was make a boosted board anyway. You can change the current control type to a few different options based on FW and just in the Vesc tool if you were really that unhappy with it. Personally if I put half throttle, my board isn't going full speed it's going half. It's a shame you didn't just ask for help as it looks like a pretty reasonable build.

When you get bored of the boosted and build 12s ask us next time ðŸ˜œ

I have ridden both VESC based boards and the Boosted board extensively (my V2 has over 4600 km on the odometer) I can totally relate to what you feel. The Boosted control is just on another level really.

It's similar in some ways to the VESC current control but feels much more refined on the fine details.
Sad to see you leave diy but you can't go wrong really. Have fun bud!

Thanks for not hating on me for disliking the DIY control! It's good, I just preferred the Boosted control and found a used one for a really good deal.

Not selling the deck, but if you want the trucks I could sell those, theyâ€™re caliber 2 ones. I have 2 sets (4 total), one thatâ€™s scratched up and one that is brand new besides the 4 screw marks from the motor mounts.

You built that board and then went back to a boosted?  The mind boggles.  The boosted is a toy compared to that build.  There was so much finessing you could have done with that thing.  Vesc gives you total control over the riding experience.  You could have set your amps to get you that feel.  You could have changed the throttle curves to suit your needs.  Limitless.  Not bagging you out my friend but surprised is all.  I fully expect to see you back building very soon.  Good luck with the sale.  Had you been in aus I would have bought the complete.  Nice build.

I did all of that and it was good, but I found a stealth for a great deal and prefer the boosted feel and control.
