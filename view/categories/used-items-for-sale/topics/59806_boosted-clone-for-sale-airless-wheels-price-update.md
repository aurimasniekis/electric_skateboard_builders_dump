Hey guys. I’m trying to put some money together for a one whee XR. As you may know they are $1800. Crazy expensive. So I want to let go of a few things. 

Price for the board is $600 shipped in the US. 

I have a boosted clone which is pretty much a Experiement board that I just mess with when I have time. It’s currently got a boosted board battery on it. It does charge, it all works fine. I am not including a charger.  

Boosted board standard range battery
Aluminum pulley and steel motor pulley 
15mm belt
97mm original flywheels
The extra wife torqueboard trucks
It’s a loaded vanguard  deck which I skinned in cardbon fiber. I put some holes in it which I filled with epoxy and never felt like sanding down. 
It’s got an anti spark switch with 40amp fuse. 
Vesc-X with settings for a 12s lifepo4 battery 
Running sensored foc
Has a Bluetooth module
Lcd display which is not really accurate since it’s not running lithium ion anymore
An extra electronics enclosure since the charge port and lcd display are not obselte 
Gt2b master cho mod remote
190 kv 6384 sk3 motor. Sensored 
Enertion motor mount

Not sure what I want for this yet so offers are welcomed. 

Also have those airless wheels. Someone buy them. They have ceramic bearings.
