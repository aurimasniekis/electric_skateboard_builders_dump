Bought these a few months ago looking to restructure them into a flat pack. Didn't realize how heavy they were so I went with 18650s in the end. 

Charged them to storage charge as soon as i got them and they've been sitting in my room since.

I took the heatshrink off one to see how the pack was structured and figure out how to make it flat, but I never went through with it.
