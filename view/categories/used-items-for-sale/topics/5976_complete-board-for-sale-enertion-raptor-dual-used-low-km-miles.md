Have a Raptor Dual wifh Steeve remote. Carbon fibre deck, carbon fibre look cover. Enertion trucks and 83mm wheels. Can include original carbon fibre lid. Custom black wheel nuts and covers to rear wheels. Clear protective cover to battery screen, shorf screw sets for battery cover for ease of access to battery compartment.

Handle and kickplate. Standard charger with Aus lead.

The decks used, so not perfect. Still looks great. Has had reasonable use early on receiving because it took so long to come, but finding Im not using it as much now. Might as well share the love if anyone is interested. Prefer Aussie buyer given its a pain to send batteries OS, but if the right buyer comes willing to post at buyers expense.

Have another one Im waiting on new VESCs. Must be sold as complete.

Hi, side qs, how did you get the two handles? I can't even get my hands on a single one and I've been looking for them for months.
