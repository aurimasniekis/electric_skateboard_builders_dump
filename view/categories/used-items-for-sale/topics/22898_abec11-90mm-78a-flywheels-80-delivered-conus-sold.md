Just a few miles on these before I switched to smaller wheels to gear down. As the title says, they're genuine ABEC11 90mm 78a Flywheels. I'm asking $80, delivered via Priority Mail.

The _incremental_ shipping cost would be about $20, so that would make them $100 shipped. Do you want them at that price?
