If @Sapphirinia doesn't want the deck i'll definetly take it. @slerm, im not in NY but I am in US so if you'd be willing I would take that deck off your hands.  I can pay you for the trouble (and shipping obiviously), but only If your willing

edit: haha got this confused with the micro slim, thought it was a spud deck!  Don't need it now, @Sapphirinia can have it all.  Besides, I already have a working build :wink:
