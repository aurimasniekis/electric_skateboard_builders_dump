The same battery I've been speaking to multiple people about, I'm just too uncomfortable shipping it

I can do local (914/Westchester area) or NYC(Grand Central) drop off

Ridden for less than 100 miles, fully discharged 3 times, looking for 95usd

I just want it gone, I don't like having batteries sitting around doing nothing ![15467950723966866574962019291736|666x500](upload://zCW0Wlj6mR3yHcdyHc95YMMyhL1.jpeg) ![15467951838394307795002079645430|375x500](upload://nIspQCnpi2MceZfqXuWG5DHDwFt.jpeg) 

I dropped a little drop of water ( not by accident) to test if the sticker works, and yes, it does :slight_smile:

The electrical tape on the charging connector is to insulate as the sleeving around the wire has cracked in two places, likely due to the temperatures I rode around in Upstate
