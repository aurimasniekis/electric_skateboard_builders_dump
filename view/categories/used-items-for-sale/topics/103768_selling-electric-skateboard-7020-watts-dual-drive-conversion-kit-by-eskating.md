Hey everybody,

I bought a “Electric skateboard 7020 Watts Dual Drive Conversion kit by Eskating” [link ](https://eskating.eu/product/electric-skateboard-7020-watts-conversion-kit-by-eskating-assembled/) about a year ago. Unfortunately I thought I would have more time to ride. Since it’s lying around most of the time, I would like to sell it. I rode it semi frequently for about 2 months, so it’s pretty new.

The kit includes:

* 2x3510 Watt Motors
* 10s3p 30Q 9000mah Battery pack with bms (all assembled in a 420mm long enclosure)
* a second backup enclosure
* two focbox esc
* a 1 channel receiver with low and fast mode (Eskating V2 remote)
* 97mm flat black wheels
* a 36" globe blazer deck

The kit without the deck was about EUR 1.600,00. I'm willing to sell it for EUR 1.000,00.

I'm located in Austria/Europe.

Please pm me if you are interested or have any questions. :slight_smile:

Best regards, Phil!
