Judging from the gear, I would say range is around 25-30 miles at hard riding and speed probably pushing 40mph. But maybe the actually owner could tell you lol

 Depending on how you ride it where you ride and how you weigh you can get anywhere between 15 to 25 miles. Top speed is about 35+ but if you wanna go faster you can get a bigger motor pulley would you bring it up to 40+
