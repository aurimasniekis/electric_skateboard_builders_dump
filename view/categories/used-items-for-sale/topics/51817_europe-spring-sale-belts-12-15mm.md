Hi folks,

Sadly I'll have to part with my DIY board.
Everything works flawlessly and is in great condition.

Battery is 5S4P and can be connected in series (10S4P). It has around 200 km clocked and is still performing as expected. I've charged the battery in parallel with hobby charger+ server PSU. It was charged around 15 times. I'll supply the serial cable with 2x XT90 connectors for both batteries, 2x XT60 connectors for Focboxes and antispark XT90 key.

I have all the parts listed in the table below including quantities and prices without shipping.

All prices are in EUR.

Shipping is from Slovenia, Europe. I prefer to ship it tracked, I ship worldwide.

You are selling used 30Qs for more than nkon charges for new. Any way you could change to a more reasonable price?

But in the OP, it is said :
[quote="Crossfire, post:1, topic:51817"]
Battery is 5S4P connected in series (10S4P) and has around 200 km clocked and is still performing as expected
[/quote]
Can be clearer IMO !

I've edited the misunderstanding around the batteries.
It's a ready to go battery - not 40x single cells. Both of them were spot welded with thick metal strips + the batteries are are placed in 3d printed 4 cell holders from my design (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2526936).

Hi, I am interested in your battery pack.
But after 200km, I'm wondering if all your cells are properly balanced ? 
150€ is quite some money for me and i would prefer to be sure that it wont have a faulty cell in a month.
Woud love if you could tell me more about it ;-)

Those are the screenshots from the hobby charger after plugging each 5S4P cell for the test today.

All 40 cells are in great shape and ready to rock. With some little modifications you can easily hook it up as 10S4P with BMS too.
