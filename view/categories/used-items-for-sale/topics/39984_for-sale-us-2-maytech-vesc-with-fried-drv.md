yeah they had seemed to work when I played with it last night. Now they're both pulling drv errors. I don't really need them since the enertion sale but I guess I could keep them as backups

Ide say they are more worth keeping for practice repairing later on if you feel like it

If you decide to keep them, it might be cheaper and easier to just send them to the Drv wizard for repair.

You could send them back to Maytech for a refund as they seem so adamant on their social media accounts that their Vescs can do FOC no problem??

They're also second hand so I don't even know where they came from or when they were bought
