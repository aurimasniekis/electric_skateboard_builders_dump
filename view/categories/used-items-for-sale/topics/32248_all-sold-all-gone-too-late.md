It's a 6374. It came from a group buy similar to motors from alien power systems but with 8mm shaft. 
There is someone interested already but you can have 2nd dibs if you want.

Hi, I'm interested in the motors - can you tell me their KV ?
Also I assume they are not sensored?

I've checked on a site called Parcel2go and it seems that I can send one for around £10 or both of them for about £15. Which is probably cheaper than a lot of European destinations! Go figure.
