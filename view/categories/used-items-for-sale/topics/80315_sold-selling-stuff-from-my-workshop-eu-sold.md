3500 is probably a good price, but alot to dishout over one sale. Gut says you'd do better parting it out.

Intrested in the Landyatch and the HS11, maybe more!

Well, Splitt 4 ways its still around 800 euro per head. 

Biggest chunck of dough is on the complete trampa board. If we have to part out that as well its a hell of a distribution job xD

I did a swift addition on my calculator and came up with the number 2830 euro. I took the prices of roughly what I knew was retail price and cut of about a chunck since its not out of the bag new. So the starting price is a tad bit high, **in my opinion** (dont take to hard on this tho, very swift calc..). So maybe 3000 is a compromise?

Edit: I suck, I missed some items

Don't take anything for granted, if OP answers me back i will be willing to discuss a price but i think 3500 is stretching the value a bit. Especially since its all sold in a package the price should be favourable for the buyer in my opinion. 

Its a large pile of cash to pay up!

Everything is quite expensive I must say !
I looked for the eskating enclosure (one of the things that interests me) and it's even more expensive than in the shop !

No the prices that @martijntje42 posted were just the new prices. It would be/should be cheaper than those prices.
