Hi,
 I accidentally bought 2 focbox and do not need the second one. It's up for sale in the NYC area. 
Completely 100% new. NEVER used and available right away.  280 USD. 
For further details I'll be happy to talk :-)
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ron.

Hello @ron.k,
 
Just created an account as a friend messaged you about this for me. I would like to see if we can work something out. Is there a way we can contact each other?

Thanks,
Jkarma

Just very suspicious about any phone number posted on a public forum. No longer interested.

Like that price point? Why not bio boards? Unless you want xt60s and 4mm butts
