Also, in the future, no need for multiple posts. You could put all of the things you want to sell in one post as not to clutter things. Good luck on the sale!

yeah if you want to wire all the contacts and everything yourself, feel free. Cost me 140 bucks to buy with all the wiring added on, and I'm not willing to take a 45% cut on new equipment. Good luck in your search

I apologize if I came across as blunt... I'm still a super n00b in the eboard world, so didn't know wiring was that large an expense. Wiring consists of perhaps sensor wiring, motor wiring with connector, and bullet connectors to connect to the motor, right?
