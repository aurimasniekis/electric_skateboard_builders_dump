Almost 1 year ago i bought a Space Cell 4 from enertion. I got some mounts and a skateboard and started playing around and got my skateboard to work. I was extremely happy with it as it simplified the process of building and assembling the skateboard a lot.

After playing some months with the Electric skateboard i stoped using it and it is sitting there so now i want to sell the Batterry as it is in perfect shape and it is a extremely high quality device.

atached some pictures and i can answer any questions :).

Price would be 200 € + shipping from Spain, i still have the original packing material.

Just cheked and they are 25R.

I went to work +- 20 times. Its aprox 5 KM . So it has only aprox 100 +-  KM on them.

I would have to check shipping to US , but its probably going to be Expensive from 70 to 100 €.

o US and how muc
[/quote]

Sorry let me clarify, 

You asked to ship to the US, (United Stades) that one would be probably on that price range i mentioned.

Shipping to ireland is probably much cheaper.

I used IE as In Example. 

Sorry for the confusion.
