Hey,

I would like to trade/sell two Turnigy SK8 6374 192 kV motor for the same ones with lower kV. I like this motor, very good quality but too high kV for me. 

Condition is very good, maybe 200km on them.



Located in Germany.

Would also sell them now. Price is **165€**.

I know this is near the new price but keep in mind you have to pay import taxes and dhl express fees. So I paid total 230€ for it. So I guess this a fair price.
