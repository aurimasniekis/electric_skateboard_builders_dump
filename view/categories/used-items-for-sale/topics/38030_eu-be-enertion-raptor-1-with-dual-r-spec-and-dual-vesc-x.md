Hey guys,

I'm selling my Raptor 1 from the batch 2 which has no more warranty but is in good condition.

The board cost me around 1800 euro in total. I would like to have around 950 without shipping.
I'm from Belgium [eu], it would be easier to find someone close by to avoid long shipping distance. 

It has a low mileage as i didn't used it that much.

Here is the spec:
- Dual R-Spec motors
- Dual Vesc-x (brand new) - plus one vesc as a part
- New remote controller installed (http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/) - still have the stock one 
- 4 abec 11 flywheels 83mm 75a - 4 enertion wheels
- A fast and a normal charger
- Battery pack 10s3p
- 2 front and 2 back lights
- Space belts

If you are interested i also have a set of protections: (size M) https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B00G90EDXA/ref=pe_386181_136957881_TE_item https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B009S781SY/ref=pe_386181_136957881_TE_item

Sounds like a very good deal. Too bad I don't have the cash.

Why are you selling it? Are you replacing it with a new eskate?

Hey, 

No, the main reason is that i don't do eskate anymore (at least, for the moment).
It's quite hard in my region to ride everywhere (pavement, no bike lane...).

So yeah, i prefer to sell the board to someone that will do something with it.

Have a nice day and yes the board is still available.

I will probably sell my board also because of that reason, its just not enjoyable when you have to slow down every 100m stop and take your board across the street and just get one of these
