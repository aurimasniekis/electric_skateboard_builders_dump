Due to extrinsic financial concerns, I have unfortunately made the decision to sell my esk8. 

The board is a Route the Architect painted bottom 37in deck, with DIY electric trucks and wheels. 

It features:
DIY Electric VESC
Eneretion Space Cell 3
DIY Electric 190kv motor
Enertion Motor mount
Space Cell 3 Charger
Nano X receiver

The price for the list above is in the high 950's though I am asking for 800. **THE COST IS NEGOTIABLE DEPENDING ON VARIOUS SITUATIONS.**
I am trying to get rid of the entire board, unfortunately, I am hesitant to ship individual parts.
I am happy to ship anywhere in the USA or internationally, please let me know if you are interested ASAP.

**PLEASE NOTE: THE STICKERS ARE VERY EASY TO REMOVE. I PURCHASED TWO SUPREME STICKERS FROM A PRINTER IN NEW YORK, THEY ARE QUITE VALUABLE, HOWEVER, IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO INCLUDE THEM, I CAN REMOVE THEM AND GIVE A DISCOUNT**
