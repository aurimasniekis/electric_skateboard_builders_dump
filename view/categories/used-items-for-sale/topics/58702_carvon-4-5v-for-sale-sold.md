yes was involved in the crash but this one was not the one that broke off and crashed but everything was eventually replaced regardless because of the upgrades . The only thing that's the same is the Strators no damage to them . they probably have less than 150 miles

Sorry for delay response man. Work calls I have 2 sets of the Torque drives. I get between 27-30 no problem but that’s really heavy when put on a longboard with 107s and a 60cell battery haha! If you haven’t sold this by tomorrow let me know. Trying to rationalize getting it
