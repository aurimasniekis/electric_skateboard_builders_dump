Hi,

I want to get rid of some things to make room for new stuff :slight_smile: 
So here we go:

**[NEW] Turnigy SK8 6354 200KV**
Brand new, never used Turnigy motor. Only opened the box to let you see there is actually a motor inside.
![49|690x388](upload://no2WlVGrpEQSoIdhvwISWw0igxP.jpeg)![28|666x500](upload://tBsHwxmwRZMnLB2lh2QMwNBimNP.jpeg)
**Price 55€**






**[USED] Turnigy SK3 260 KV**
Used but still great motor. I ground a flat spot on the shaft so that you can use a pulley with screws to fix it.
![59|690x388](upload://ox1QXGRZMW7bwugFw0Gh9GQIkN.jpeg)
**Price 40€**



**[USED] 8s (33,6V) 2.0 A Charger**
Used but stil in a good condition. Laptop-style charger.
![18|690x388](upload://p3HwrDifAO653jj7Bn6h77o6EfS.jpeg)
**Price 5€**


**[USED] 10s2p Samsung 30Q spotwelded**
This battery was only charged once and hasn't seen the street. Only used for testing purposes, so its like new.
The battery was spotwelded by a german guy: https://www.ebay.de/str/akkuservicedellinger without fish paper.
I added a charge only BMS from ebay.
![47|375x500](upload://xIbWsprNPMLfPGzOl8ARVuYrsgf.jpeg)
**Price 90€**


All prices are without shipping cost. If you are interested in an item, we can look for the best possible shipping method/price :slight_smile:

The racerstar motors probably werent detected because it seems you have to run them in FOC for them to be found.  I had one that was detected when I did bldc and another that wasnt.  Updated firmware on vesc and motor/sensor detect in FOC and both came up first try.

@briman05

I couldn’t try foc because my vesc weren’t able to handle it. I simply bought new motors and now everything is working :smile: 

Since that I don’t have any use for the racerstars and I can sell them to @Maxid probably that he can experiment with them :slight_smile:

Battery still there?

Sorry for no response. I was going to from someone else and this was the backup, and then the guy sold to someone else instead even though he promised me :frowning:
