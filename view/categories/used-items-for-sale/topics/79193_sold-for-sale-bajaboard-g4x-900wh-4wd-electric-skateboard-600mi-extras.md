Selling to fund DIY builds. ~$4,200 new, 600 miles since July 2017. I‚Äôve done 37mph, 26 miles max distance. New tires. Modified trigger. 4 wheel drive that is faster and more capable than any Boostedboard, evolve electricskateboard, or literally any other commercial mountainboard. It can take ANY hill you can drive a car on.

I got the 4 wheel drive version with the large 900wh battery.

Asking $3k. 
I don‚Äôt want to ship, it‚Äôs a 60lbs package.  (could be convinced), would be ok with driving to meet up anywhere in SoCal, I‚Äôm in San Diego . No international. 

Listed on Ebay too. May cancel this posting at anytime.

Don‚Äôt care if it doesn‚Äôt sell because it‚Äôs awesome. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

See my Instagram @anonable for videos of distance and speed. 

Will update with details.

It is. A Seam rattled loose. It‚Äôs a 120$ usd part. Bajaboards recommended tapping and adding a few screws with locktite. Has held so far. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Not a wt bearing part, would just as soon replace if gave way.

Unfortunately, you posted just after I bought a Bajaboard last Nov. I live here in SD and would like your advice: The bajaboard is not street legal. Have you had any problems with police? Also any suggestions where to ride - including any off road? Thanks! Miguel
