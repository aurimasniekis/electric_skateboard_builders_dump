I'm selling 2 Torqueboards 12S ESCs.  Bought them off a forum member a while back but never used them.  They should still be in good working condition and had little usage according to the previous owner.

Note that these are ESCs that are programmed with a programming card, not VESCs.

Looking for $120 USD shipped for both.
