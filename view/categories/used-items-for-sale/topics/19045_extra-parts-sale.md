The single jacob hub, does it include the other truck? Also how much has it been used? Does it have the slipping urethane problem?

I have ridden my Jacob hubs for ~200km now - with the easy fix that I proposed I did not have any urethane slipping so far. Even if these motors had it - you can fix it easily
