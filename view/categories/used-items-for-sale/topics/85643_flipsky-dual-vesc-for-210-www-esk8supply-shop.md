Have these been tested. I ask because there are some people having trouble with this esc saying that half of the esc doesnt function? I know u offer 3 months warrenty but still for most people spending their budget on it even woth a good price shipping to china can cost more just to fix it or replace it

I will make sure flipsky test their vesc before shipping. The vesc itself seems reliable from the forum. Other than user error, faulty products will be covered within 3 months.

Have tested both the single and dual on high powered boards, they work great. The only thing that dont work great is the built in anti spark so i suggest you get a external anti spark and the voltage reading on them is not 100% correct, jumps +/- 6% all time. But all important function works great and it holds for high power.

You have a very good price on your custom gripe tape! What is the grit on them?

I'm aware of the antispark issues and this is the exact reason why we don't stock it. I will keep testing the antispark and I will not stock them until they have perfected it.

I'm a University student based in UK but the products will be shipped from China with tracked DHL 5days shipping.
Also I'm not sure on the exact lumen, I'm using the lights on my board currently and they are very good in the dark!
