These are some parts I have from building two 6s boards and now a 10s board. All parts are in good condition and everything is working as new. Shipping cost will be reduced for items purchased together. This is basically the main components for a 6s build minus the VESC and drivetrain.

How have the 8000mAh batteries been stored?  Seems like a low amount of usage as well. Are they modified in any way or stock?


Also, anything missing from the charger?
