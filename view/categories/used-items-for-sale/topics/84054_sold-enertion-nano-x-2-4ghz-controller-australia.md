I am selling an Enertion Nano-X controller in perfect working condition. There is only some minor cosmetic scratches on one side of the controller (see 2nd photo). I am selling it for AUD$100 which includes the remote, USB charging cable, receiver and binding plug(already binded together). I am located in Melbourne but I happy to ship domestically, quote me your postcode for postage prices.
Thanks

@ProjectEldor  Yeah but for that price you can get a good Modded GT2b, enertion should have kept the price at 27$

@mynamesmatt I've heard the travel is not great plus it looks like its just a modded winning.

They're the same as the V2. They're not a bad remote at all, the winning V1 was terrible. The OP has a right to sell at whatever price they like, you have a right to decide whether or not to buy it. Let's not muddle up this thread with opinions and hearsay (alanzhou).
