Does the 8mm shaft just swap out, no grinding or glue or anything?

I don't know how it exactly works but i think you need to unscrew something.

Normally, you just remove the C clip from the pulley end and pull the can off. Then loosen the grub screws on the opposite end and pull the shaft out of the can.
Depending on how tight it fits, you might have to drive it out with a small press or a drift punch.
