Hi all,

I'm putting up for sale my Photon, with the latest receiver for $120 shipped in the Cont US Lower 48 only. If you are outside of this the price is $115 + shipping. But would prefer to keep it domestic.

The remote is in complete working order, never been dropped, and was used with gloves for about 300 miles. Condition is "Like New"

I am no longer using the remote, as the side to side play of the joystick does not bode with me well above 30mph. However, It's a wonderful remote for a cruiser, and has the latest firmware already updated.

You will receive
- Photon Remote
- Old Receiver
- New Receiver
- Connection cable
- USB cable supplied with the remote.

I may be interested in this, does the side to side motion affect the throttle and brakes or does it just make you lose orientation?

It takes some getting used to, I have only used it on cruisers for the same reason.  It's just a matter of training yourself though.

Alternatively you could 3d print rails on the sides of the remote so it doesnt move side to side while riding.
