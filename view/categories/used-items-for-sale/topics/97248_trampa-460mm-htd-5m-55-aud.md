You are right 450mm sorry, and tbh l dont have any first hand exprince with this belts but based apon my knowladge of belts yes, the belt should last quite a bit longer, whether it's worth it is up to you

Cheap belts are like $4 each... even the most premium belts I have seen were like $15 each... these must be made of diamonds or something.
