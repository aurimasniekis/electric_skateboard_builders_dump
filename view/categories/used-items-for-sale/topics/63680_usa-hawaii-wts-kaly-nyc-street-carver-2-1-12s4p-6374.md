Ernesto charges like $2,700 for his Trampa build. With under 500 miles and multiple repairs, what would be a reasonable price? Keep in mind that this forum is full of people that could build this

You would need to ship the battery separately as hazardous goods ground shipping typically. I guess you could ship the whole board like that buts it's pricy as fuck.

While that may technically be true, we do absolutely know it is not actively for sale because it’s a 4 month old post and the the OP hasn’t responded to a post or DM in just as long.
