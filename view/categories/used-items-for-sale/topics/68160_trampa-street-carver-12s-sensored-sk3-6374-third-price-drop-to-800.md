I have decided to give up e-skating and am selling this board (build thread [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-street-carver-sk3-6374-12s-vesc-and-trampa-mount-kit/10259/47)). 

This is a 24 mph board that climbs hills very well. Upgrades since the original build include:

* _sensored_ SK3 149kv motor,
* ABEC 11 83mm 75a Flywheels (genuine),
* ceramic bearings, and
* new Turnigy Nano-tech batteries.

you can buy a sensor kit for motors, basically you glue the sensors and the pcb in the case

This is from [wmj259's group buy](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sk3s-big-size-motor-group-buy-closed-end-v-thumbsup-thumbsup/13540/288). It came from the factory with sensors (and a long, keyed shaft).

Bump for big price drop (embarrassed to have messed up the Â£/$ conversion with my original listing).

Thanks, but it doesn't sound like mine is the board for you. 

Incidentally, with12S LiPos and the low kv motor, this single motor will be more than sufficient for most. It outperforms Boosted Duals on the hills (and flats) here in San Francisco.

I don't want to part it out, but I'd send it to the EU as long as the buyer pays shipping.

Gotta get this out of my garage. I continue to think this is a very nice build and would prefer to sell this as a complete board, but will sell the board, trucks, and wheels as a set to someone wanting to do their own Trampa build for $600.
