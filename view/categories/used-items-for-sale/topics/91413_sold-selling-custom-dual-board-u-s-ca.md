I live on a boat so the wife says one has to go. Battery has approximately 30 charge cycles with only 6 to 10 of them being range tests in various conditions. And the rest around 40-60% SOC.

27-30lbs. It has a huge battery. 10s5p of Efest 21700 purple 3700mah cells rated to push 25amps each. So the pack can push 120amps with no noticeable sag. These are currently my favorite cells.
