No problem. I imagine they will go quickly at that price as they currently sell for $120 per motor and have one month(if your lucky lol) shipping times, so if you want them you may want to act fast.

those motors look so used, seems dishonest to say just a few miles or new.

and by the looks of it, you took payment from 3 different people for the same motors..

something smells funny

He seemed to have replied to PayPal about my stuff but PayPal didn't passed the message to me, they are saying that they are still reviewing the claim and will let me know once they have solved it.\
Lucky you, his prices where good. Is your stuff in the described condition?

The only thing I have to say is the 6374s that I got had the sensors cut, which was not described, this however I remedied, the other things he sent me seemed to be as described, this was a set of TB trucks and mounts that were "never used" indeed it does not seem that they were ever used.
