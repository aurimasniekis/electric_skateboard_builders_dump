I have a basically new VESC BLDC motor controller based on the 4.12 hardware revision which was manufactured by Ollin Board Company ollinboardcompany.com in the USA.
I originally purchased a pair of these in May 2016 and bench tested them with a BLDC motor to confirm that they were working. 
It's been sitting in a box for years unused.
Before listing these I downloaded the latest VESC Tool and updated the firmware to the latest 3.57 version.
