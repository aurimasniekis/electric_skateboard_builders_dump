I have a Carvon v2 hub kit. It comes with motor hub and wheels, the VESC, with transmitter and reciever, and with two Turnigy 2650 mAh 6s lipos with the charger. Board will not be included so the shipping can be cheaper. There are no problems with anything just looking to fund my next build. Lookin for $320 obo. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/5/c57dd331de964c3387ccff31c1b4aa08fdaf6aa9.JPG" width="666" height="500">
