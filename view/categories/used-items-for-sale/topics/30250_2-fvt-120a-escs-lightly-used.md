I have two 120a FVT esc's for sale. Programming card included.
I will also include the dean's style parallel connector with xt60 connector and Y cable to connect the receivers.

@Mobutusan  was the first to reply so sold pending payment.  Thanks for looking.  
These are very close to new with probably less than an hour of ride time logged. Only selling because I decided to go next level with 2 VESC-X's!

@trancejunkiexxl I hate to admit was running a very poor multistar 6s battery and never really got up to max speed before I broke said battery.  I think with my carvon v2.0 I could have gotten up to about 25 mph.
