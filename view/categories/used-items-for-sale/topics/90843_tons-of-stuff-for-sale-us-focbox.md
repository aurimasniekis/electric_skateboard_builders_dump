$200 for a single Chinese hub drive is a little too pricey yeah. I have some friends that are interested in cheap Esk8 (it's a gateway drug I'm feeding to them) so I'll be watching this to see if there's anything I can buy.gald you're back home and your family isn't too mad about what happened. Be safe with them batteries my dude

I was sbout to mentioned, but the caliber, with boaramics and sk3 is a really good deal. Don't know why peeps keep saying all this is noobs garbage? Well, seems that @Blacksheep is wise enough to take those from naysayers. Also the @MasterCho enclosure is a good one, @iamasalmon wants it. Good pick. 

See girls, there are good things in this parts sale. Doomsday seers stay away!
