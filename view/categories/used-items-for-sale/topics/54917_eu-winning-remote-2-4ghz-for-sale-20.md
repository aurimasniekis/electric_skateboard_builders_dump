Hi,

I'm looking to sell this Winning remote I've got laying around.
Has a few scratches on the front, but nothing major.

Comes with its receiver and a binding plug.
Works well but sometimes drops connection slightly around big metal structures, but that's a known winning remote issue. Connection always recovers within half a second if it happens.

Price is €20.
