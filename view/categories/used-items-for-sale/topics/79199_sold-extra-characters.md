Basically new factory LaCroix DSS50+. I’ve ridden it three times. Absolutely amazing board. Includes Hoyt puck remote, already installed but very easy to switch back to nano if you prefer. I’m in San Luis Obispo, CA and would rather not  ship but I could look into it if I can’t find someone local.

$2500 firm

I don’t believe there’s a scratch on it... just the tire wear from around 40-60 miles. It’s an absolute beast!!

Are they seen in duck duck go searches?  What about bing searches?  Are we safe on that front?

You tell us “source code”

Just looking out on what I was taught but open to hearing your side of the story. Is it safe to post your number on public forum?
