Barely used 15t steel pulley with 4 set screws, 8mm bore, 3mm keyway. For HTD5M 15mm width belts. I'm looking to trade with someone that has a 12teeth with 2 or more set screws with or without a keyway. I'm from Canada. ![15319169967347683982854426647726|375x500](upload://iVoPp3pv2qqHARWN4FmpYrbS6XC.jpg)
