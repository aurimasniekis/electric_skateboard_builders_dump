For sale or trade! Located in Hillsboro, OR 97123 These hubs are very powerful and quiet but they consume a lot of juice! I planned to use them on a haya deck but dont have enough battery space for the range I wanted sadly! Looking to get $275 +shipping.

It's going to be very expensive, about the same price I'm asking for the motors. Shipping to London costs $240
