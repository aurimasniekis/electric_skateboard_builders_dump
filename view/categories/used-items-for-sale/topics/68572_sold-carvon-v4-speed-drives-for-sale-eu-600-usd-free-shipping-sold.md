Slightly used. PU cut for better heat dissipation. 

Better pictures will follow tomorrow. 

Iâ€™m looking for $800 if people are willing. I wish to go belt drive with 74â€™s. Make me an offer. I am in the EU Netherlands. 

Here are some pictures. Better ones will follow later today after I have had some sleep.

I everyone broke or nobody interested?
These puppies used to sell like hot cakes. 

As said Iâ€™m looking for $800 but very willing to go lower especially since demand seems to be existent to none. 

Here they are on my current test build.

I think the $800 price tag is what is hard to swallow. a lot of budget is for a $1,000 board. Spending $800 leaves very little room for everything else. Good luck...have you posted on the CarvOn group buy thread?

800â‚¬ is a bit steep especially since the Exos pros were going for 700 something dollar ....for a full landyacht board...... 10s3p.......moded hubs..........running. significant drop to 500 may Garner more attention

Where is my badge? I replied via email. 

I was not expecting to get $800 honestly but I thought demand was still high for this so it may go for $800.

Â£500 for a very lightly used set of Carvons in the EU which are rare as rocking horse shit.
I'd say these will be gone pretty quickly.

Maybe the price will look more appealing in EUR.

[/quote]

Correct, that outer can is a ferrite? sleeve. It keeps the magnetic field withing the motor itself, this is why your tools don't get pulled in. They are also pretty thick so shouldn't get too damaged if you run then without the urethane sleeve

IKR?! a bit surprised it's still not sold. Maybe it's the EU thing. I assume it would sell pretty easily in the US?
