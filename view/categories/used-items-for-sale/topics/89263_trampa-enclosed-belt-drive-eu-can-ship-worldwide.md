I am selling my Trampa enclosed belt drives.

The drives must have around 100km on them, most of it on tarmac but I have also taken them off road.
The bottom of the drives is scratched as where I live the terrain is really rocky but there are no dents or deep scratches as the bash guards have done their job and protected the rest of the drives.

The motor cages have been modified to allow for the use of SK8 motors which are longer than the stock Trampa motors.

Included in the package are 2x 13T (used, maybe 90km), 2x 14T (new and unused) and 2x15T (used around 10km) motor gears as well as 4 x 425x15mm (2 used and 2 brand new and unused).

The cost of these items new are:
* Drive :495€
* Motor gears: 4 x 13€=52€
* Belts: 2 x 22€ = 44€
* Total: 591€

**I am letting all of the above go for 380€ shipped in most EU countries.**

**I can also ship worldwide but will have to check the cost first, my guess is it will be approximately 20€ more**

The reason I am letting it go is that I ordered a mini direct drive for the increased ground clearance.

The enclosed belt drive gives you choice between 4.4:1 , 4.7:1 and 5.1:1 gearing and has all the advantages of a belt drive without the main disadvantage which is the susceptibility to debris etc as it is completely enclosed.

Still available.

The drives are scratched as can be seen in the photos but if you use them off road they will end up getting scratched anyway. Mileage is very little ca. 100km

Hit me up with an offer if interested.

Come on guys. This is your chance to buy an enclosed belt drive for almost the cost of an open belt drive.

Obviously.

Although with the mounting system it has it could probably be used on MBS hangers but I can't say that for sure.

Oh, I know about that. I never expected @mmaner to buy it.

I am genuinely interested how much I should sell it.

It is a better system than any other belt drive as far off road goes since it is enclosed and allows for various ratios with only a change of the motor pulley.

Trampa gear is good but expensive so this should suit someone very well at the price point.  You just have to find someone building a trampa.  Personally I would keep it and build something else.
Like a channel truck crossover street carver with numies.  Or adapt it to fit tkp's.  Oh the possibilities.
