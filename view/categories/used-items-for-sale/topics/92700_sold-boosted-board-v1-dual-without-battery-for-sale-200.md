 Alright, guys. So basically this is what happened. My boosted board would go over a bump and then turn off. I then proceeded to open the battery and while trying to take out the BMS, a battery tore and then caught fire. Unfortunate, I know. 

Now, I have a Boosted Board V1 Dual+ for sale. $200 bucks + shipping. The motors have 400 miles on it. It also comes with the remote. It also has Red Bones bearings and brand new belts with like 3 miles on them.

Thank you for doing that. Yeh im sorry guys, if there is a way that I can ship to out of US, let me know. It may be possible since there is no lithium on the board anymore, but theres a couple batteries where the motors connect so idk.

What is shipping to 33615? I'll take it if it's still available, given shipping is ridiculous.
