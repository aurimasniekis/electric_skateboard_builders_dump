Wheels are **gone**
Esc's are lightly used..
Mr. Roboto said around 2-3 rides iirc.

Let me know what you have to swap by posting up a pic of what you have. 



Thanks for looking!


I don't know what I want, other than eskate, longboard, skateboard, and mountain board parts..new or "tested".

Please post your location when posting pics of what you have to trade. 

Even if what you have is worth far more, or less than new flywheels **that are no longer availible** and max6'seses, post it anyway..

I'm located near Sacramento, California.

Yes, I believe so..

it was set up at 37% braking iirc. 

Original ad I can't find for some reason.. 
But when I bought them I asked about their condition:


I asked: 
"About how many hours of use, or miles, on them?"

and I'll throw in a Welcome old school shaped park deck too with a cool sabre tooth skull graphic on it..value well above the wheel cost and I'm not using them..

[TRADED ALREADY]

I have 2 sensored [Torqueboards 6374 motors](collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv), slightly used.  They went for a few test rides before I decided to use the [Dark Matter motors](http://esk8.builders) instead.  They are mostly unused but have a few cosmetic-only blemishes from me testing them.  I don't need them.  What do you have that's extra?  PM me; if I need what you don't need, we might be able to trade

preferring: enclosures, lights, batteries, cells, rework station, Carvon motors, kegel pulleys, 1980s {replica} decks, carbon fiber, composite epoxy, vacuum-bag accessories, X-things, TB 218mm trucks or hangers, gold coins,  Supercarve trucks, Electric Flywheels, ESCs, grip tape, bearings

don't need: motor mounts, trucks, wheels under 100mm, sand, motor pulleys, SuperFly wheels

It can make 700mBar vacuum, good for vacuum laminating, resin infusion should work too, I didnt test that though :/ But I have discussed it with composites expert and he said it will work for sure :)

Hi everyone, I have a moose blank drop-down deck (about one inch), 9 ply and fairly stiff. 40"x9" at its narrowest point. I had gotten it all ready only to find that it's too narrow for my enclosure, so it's never been used besides checking the mounting of trucks on it. Mini remote is for scale, not selling.
![IMG_20180422_072302|666x500](upload://8lqNkLpMEDL0bKaXuHFL2CT0UdK.jpg)![IMG_20180422_072422|666x500](upload://vdqIuiqLyqLUPyKDPF4Mm2LI2rC.jpg)
I treated the bottom with mahogany wood stainer, followed by spray-on lacquer. The top is covered with custom griptape. I'm including a pair of 3d printed risers that bring the ends of the deck down to zero degrees.
I'm looking to trade for a shorter deck with no drop, something between about 35 and 37 inches long.
Example: https://m.ebay.com/itm/37-X-9-5-Downhill-Longboard-Deck/182952679776?hash=item2a98d45960:g:jcUAAOSwLEtYh-hF

This is why my @marc88 custom mounts are large. I thought about putting larger 107 mm Superflies in the future and for that reason the idlers are positioned far behind. No wheel bite, no interference.

This dicussion has been had many times, TB motors and Flipsky motors might look similar, but unfortunately Flipsky just isnt reliable with manufacturing, while TB *usually* (probably 95% of the time) has quality product

(the c clamps ;P, sorry dex :heart: )

Ok good to know. Because I’ve spotted the similarities between the motors and posted a link to a listing on alibaba for comparison, but people keep insisting TB motors look different.

If you order in bulk you can customize it. So I think TB has them made to order to make sure it’s reliable.

It could be a different factory. All of our motors rely on a fairly easy to repeat design :man_shrugging:

The cans and shafts come from the same place, that's why a lot of them look similar. The stator, magnets, wind, epoxy and all the bits that actually make it work vary significantly between factories in China.

TB's motor is not this motor, at all.
