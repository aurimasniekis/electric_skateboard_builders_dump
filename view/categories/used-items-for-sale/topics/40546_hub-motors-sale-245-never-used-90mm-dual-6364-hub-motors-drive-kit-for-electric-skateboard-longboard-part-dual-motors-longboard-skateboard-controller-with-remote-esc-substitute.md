I'll give you 140 plus shipping if you want to get some of your money back. I have parts for 6 boards I still have to build so this is very much not what I need, but I love esk8 and I have an addiction.

looks like the non-replaceable. Usually the replaceable Motors don't have the screws near the black ring.
