I burned the DRV-chip on my **flipsky VESC 4.12** yesterday and since i don't have the equipment the re-solder the chip i'm selling this thing to someone who can or want to try his luck. ![IMG_20191022_150300|375x500](upload://bB5pCRe1J6qP28845G07mU2LK3u.jpeg) ![IMG_20191022_150308|375x500](upload://d2hRjqdjHdj6WpNo6QUK9hc6nkn.jpeg) ![IMG_20191022_150316|375x500](upload://eCH7dot3B06htXraKxVglZ8BJIu.jpeg) ![IMG_20191022_150327|375x500](upload://At1GVKBW00xyo1vaDZ6DFCr6XSy.jpeg) 

I  don't know exactly how much it's worth, but i think 25â‚¬ seems somewhat fair to me, pls correct me if i'm mistaken. :)
