Hi, 
I used these for about 1 month. They have some dents scratches and chips, which does not effects the performance. I changed the bullet connectors and soldered the sensor wires new, because I needed the jst plugs from the sensor wires for another build I cut them off.
The Hubs are coming with the rear truck and I can include two 90mm abec clones in matching colors.
Please make me offers, i am willing to ship anywhere.![20180826_124920|690x388](upload://6DydKLxBXDdR2VOR4LjdETj5ewr.jpg)![20180826_124935|690x388](upload://pDqjecpSLt5ZYXJOWxayBHCmcf4.jpg)![20180826_125000|690x388](upload://zhzzMmmhz9B6UtMmuW8tYZu5RWa.jpg)![20180826_125012|690x388](upload://c5HJDpDGHjP532tvvHAYeyhTgeU.jpg)![20180826_125019|690x388](upload://rKmX3WcwglBQnSj36mhQ2CzaMNF.jpg)![20180826_125140|690x388](upload://jG5gwgwfmRrNggiTuf5dcq1GAqi.jpg)

Did you ever figure out what hubs those were? Also, did you figure out the solution on the problems you were having with the setup?

Those are 90mm 60 kv Maytech hubs. The generic e-bay ESC and the weak battery i tried to run them with was not a good match for them. With vesc's or the proprietary maytech dual hub esc they perform much better. They are torquier and more powerfull then the meepo style hubs but tend to get hotter at full speed.

Sorry for the late reply,
3500 is too much for that shit!
Can you get the rubber grommets, which fits in the holes for the wires, easily? 
If not I will try to get them here and include them.
I had two Maytech Vescs placed in the casing and that was a really tight fit. The Capacitors where larger than in the original design. Which VESC's do you want to put in there? 
I also include two capacitor boards which came withe the case from @Kug3lis. Maybe he can advise you which capacitors to get.
3000 Yen is enough for me.

Sorry, I did not see your reply.
I have 2 Ollin VESCs 4.12 I honestly don't know if it will fit maybe I should ask @kug3lis about that.
I don't know if I can get the rubber thingies here but if that is too much trouble for you don't worry i will manage somehow.
Anyways, send me your paypal address so I can send you the money and I will send you my address for the shipment.

Thanks,
