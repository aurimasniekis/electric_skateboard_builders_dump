Yes I have pictures on my phone and will upload some. What I love is that it goes from plain black to carbon fiber n silver skull EMERGING out of darkness!!!! Lol here is a pic... I will have to upload one at a time on this phone so it will take me a little bit and will start with a short video as you will see it in daytime but can see how it goes black when not direct light like a hologram here is one link...

Here is a link showing the holographic carbon fiber style paint job at dusk to see it in a different light...
But that is what is so cool... That it changes how it looks depending on the positioning of lighting and the viewer and this short video is at sunset...

I will start uploading pictures of the custom painted boards now and in this first picture the board on the right is custom painted with high gloss and heavy duty BLACK APPLIANCE EPOXY!!! Painted to hold up long term and hold up better against wear and tear such as scratches!!!! the board on the right is not for sale but is an example of someone taking a koowheel and using it as a diy board and swapping the deck with a drop through deck and adding a battery meter! Just some ideas for mods!!!! Also I put a pic of my kid with one board in the carrying bag and one in hand to see the bag
