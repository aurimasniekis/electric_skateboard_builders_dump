Hi there! 
I am selling all my carbon fiber material. I made my battery and esc enclosure with it and sadly won´t build anymore eSkateboards in the next time... (I´m selling a lot of stuff, see my other thread).
Anyhow this stuff takes a lot of space and wifey isn´t happy about it.

It contains everything to vacuum bagging carbon fiber!

* 4 m seperation foil (12€)
* 13 m vacuum sealing band (11€)
* 1,5 m carbon fiber 200g/m^2 (45€)
* 4 m porous foil (10€)
* 4 m foil tube (11€)
* 1,2 m sucking fleece (10€)
* 3 m glass fiber (25€)
* 350g epoxy and 150g hardener and spatulas  (11€)

 = **135€**

It is all high quality stuff and was purchased from a German vender.![IMG_0586|685x500](upload://lWJOob2kVUwdEsoIcMQHyYwBRiO.jpeg) 


In addition I´m selling a needed KNF vacuum pump. It comes with a barometer, tubes and a connection for vacuum bagging. KNF is German manufacturer who is known for his high quality pumps and expensive prices. After all the pumps keep their value. 
Pump costs **220€**

Awesome price!
You should also try selling on << forums. esk8. news >> (just remove the spaces).
It will sell quicker there i would think since there are more people over there and it is more active then this forum.
Cheers!!
