I am selling a 10S2P 40T Battery from Meepo for 220$ plus shipping from IN, USA (original price 300$). You can use it for DIY and it is compatible with the Meepo V3 ER, Meepo NLS PRO and the Meepo MINI 2 ER. 

Battery Pack - 40T 10S2P,
Size: 185x109x44mm (7.3x4.3x1.73inch),
Voltage: 36V,
Continuous discharge current: 30A,
Power: 288Wh,
Charging time 2.5h

I received my new Meepo Mini 2 ER on the 9th of August, 2019 and used the board twice a week, therefore it was only charged <15 times. I will fly back to Europe, and I can't take the battery on the plane. I am selling it here since shipping a 280Wh battery outside of North America is a real pain. :)

I know this is a ready to go pack for those who can't build but just fyi the raw cells online are about $7 so that's $140 new... If you get in a pinch and are willing to get under that price lemme know... Not trying to low ball...
