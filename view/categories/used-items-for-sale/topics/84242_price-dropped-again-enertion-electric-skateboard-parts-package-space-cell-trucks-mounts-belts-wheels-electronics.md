New price is 350 for motor, mounts trucks, vsc, remote, battery, wheels, pulley, and everything you see besides the deck. 

 Everything you see looks dirty and ugly, but it all works. has large RC controller that works but is large. I weigh 175 and I was going over 20MPH easy.  I had to open up the SPACE cell to change the press button power to a switch, as it was tripping and killing the power in the middle of the ride. Battery has been sitting unused for almost two years since my 25 or so rides when I got it. Still works great! I can text you a video of the motor running if you are interested. Thanks!

New price 350 for all things electronic and drive train.

I'm really not trying to be mean, but you really shouldn't expect to get more than 400 of the 650 (excluding the board) you threw out there ( not judging, I understand you just guessed it lol) but a used battery is a heavily devalued item, as well as used anything in esk8, really. 

That being said I hope you hit your target, goodluck

Thanks for the information. As an FYI, the battery has been charged approx. 25 times. Still lasts quite a while. New price 600 for everything.
