$15 obo. Buyer pays shipping or pick up near DC.

Esc wont turn off but otherwise works. Used for a month before i got the replacement. Could be used for a cheap diy build.

Also have a new ownboard esc with remote. I'll sell if you have a reasonable offer.

I'll take it. Do you go to the northern Virginia group rides? They have one Wednesday, we could meet up there.
