Hi,

so I have two APS 6374 for sale. I bought them less than a month ago, I am willing to provide the details (invoice) to the buyer since the motors are still covered by warranty by APS.

There is a mistake on their site, the mounting holes are not only 30mm apart but also 44mm
These are the motors I bought and then **added hall sensors to them**, you can see their performance in the video below. They work in BLDC and FOC with no problems.
The motors have been used for 3 weeks so they are almost brand new.

I was using them with 18 tooth pulleys so I am willing to sell those too if you are interested. Or I could even get machined pulleys of your choice locally and send you those, that could be arranged.
The price for these is 85â‚¬ per piece.

If you are interested in the reason why I am selling these: I sold the board that you see in the video but with different motors so now I have these with no use, paperweight.
