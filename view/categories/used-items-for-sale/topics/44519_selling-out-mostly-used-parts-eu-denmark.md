Hi there

I have some parts I am never gonna use, so I guess someone else could be interested... #recycling4ever?
I can take some more photos if you are interested...
The parts will be send from Denmark, so I guess it doesn't make sense to ship outside of Europe...
Please send me a pm for info about shipping prices.

Anyways, here we go!


**Torque Boards Dual Hubs 130kv - 250USD** 
As you can see on the pictures, the urethane on the hubs are pretty worn. I think the urethane is too soft. I guess I have only been riding about 15km on them, so the motor bearings etc. is still in great condition.

**Inflateable wheels, 6 inches - 60USD**
Normal truck hangers is too short for these wheels, so you need to modify the wheels or the truck. Or maybe you can find a special truck for them.
6 x 1 1/4 inches with a 8mm bearing bore.

I imagine you are referring to the used "dark green" Cult wheels? They are 83mm.

Do you know if those pneumatic wheels would fit on the TB extended trucks?

```
The bore of the wheels are 8mm i diameter and roughly 3.2 cm (1 1/4 inches) in length, so if the hanger of the torqueboards extended trucks is around the same size, then yes. But I dont know the dimensions of the TB truck, sorry...
