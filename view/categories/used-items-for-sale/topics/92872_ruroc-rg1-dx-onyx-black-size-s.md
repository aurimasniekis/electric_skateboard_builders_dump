I sell a brand new Ruroc helmet. Black onyx in size S 52 - 56 cm head circumference. I bought it in the internet because of a sale. I ordered it at risk because it was cheap. But now it does not really fit ðŸ˜› my bad. i have a circumfence 56 - 57cm. With a <56cm circumfence it would suit you. That's why I offer it here for 200.- Euro (i payd 240 on sale) . New price is approx. 360.- Euro. Everything complete with original packaging and box insert etc. once tried.

Im from Switzerland... ship it worldwide (shiping not included).
Cash, bank transfer or Paypal accepted. DM me if interested.
