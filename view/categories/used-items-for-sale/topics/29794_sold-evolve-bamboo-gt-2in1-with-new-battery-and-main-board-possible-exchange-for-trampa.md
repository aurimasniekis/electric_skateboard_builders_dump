Hey guys, selling my Bamboo GT 2in1

It's about 10 months old. **The battery is brand new (around 30 cycles on it) and the mainboard was replaced last week, too.** **The controller firmware is still V1 (no ECO when the battery is low).** So what you're actually buying is **a used shell with brand new electronics** (except for the motors).

There are some cosmetic imperfections like: scratched motor mounts, dirty griptape, scratched rear truck and the black paint is worn out on some places too. Look at the pictures to see how it looks. 

The board is fully operational.
Bought if for 1650€ from Evolve Germany, **selling it for 1300€**. The price is negotiable.
Shipping to EU only. Buyer pays for the shipping.

________________________________________
UPDATE #1: I asked Evolve Germany and they confirmed that the warranty is transferable. So **the buyer will still have more than a year of warranty.**
