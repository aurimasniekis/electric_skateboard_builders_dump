Hey, I won a LandWheel L3-A at an event here in NYC with the electric skateboard group I roll with. The problem is, I already have a Boosted Board V2, I have no use for this board. I'd like to sell it to get some pocket change so I can hopefully get a good camera to use while I cruise around. For those who don't know, it's a modular dual hub motor drive that could be taken off and mounted on any decks big enough to use it.

 I've looked around on the internet and LandWheel L3-A (Full Kit with Deck) goes for around 800$ retail but even I know it's not worth that much, so if anyone wants to take it off my hands for around 500$ I'll be happy to sell it to you.

It comes with all the stock/retail accessories including the battery, charger, remote, battery charging case, replacements wheel skins, even the manual; I barely used it just to test it out.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/c/9ccf079d416665124fbba4dbfca466c99074359b.jpg" width="225" height="225"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/3/13e68833074ca6596d841e305093503f5642aee1.jpg" width="225" height="225"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/d/ed210def53f8f0ffe0d862a82ae26ad1667b9136.jpg" width="602" height="500">

I'll give you $300. Probably not as much as you hoped but it also needs to get shipped to Holland (where I live) and that's probably another $100.
