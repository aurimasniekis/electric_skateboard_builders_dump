I accidentally bought dickyho's 95mm caliber mount instead of his 78mm mount.
Yeah, It's only a difference of a couple of mm but I'm doing a small build and i would prefer to get the smaller one for aesthetic reasons and because I already have belts for the other one, so I'm selling the one I've got.

10 Euro for the mount plus shipping.

I scratched the paint while trying on my motor pulley, only then did i figure out that i got the wrong mount and that my belts don't fit :stuck_out_tongue:
