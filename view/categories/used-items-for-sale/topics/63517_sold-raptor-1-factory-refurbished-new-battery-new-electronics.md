For Sale: Raptor 1, in better than new condition.

Fully refurbished by Enertion & unridden since then. This Raptor has a brand new 10s 3p battery, new BMS, new dual FOC Boxes, new Nano-X Remote, new grip tape, upgraded MBS all-terrain wheels. The original R-Spec Motors are still strong, clean & fast. The full carbon fiber deck is in ‚Äúlike new‚Äù condition.

The Raptor 1 is the ultimate belt-drive esk8, built on a full carbon fiber deck.

I‚Äôm thinking $1,200.00 (USD) is fair.
I live in Denver, Colorado, USA. So the board will ship from there. Purchasing party to pay shipping.

This board seriously kicks ass, and it‚Äôs available right now!

Honestly i want nothing to do with belt drive.   Just not my cup of tea.   If still available I am very interested in deck and all other components.....

This drive is amazing, still running mine every day, more than 100 km a week. So far more than 3000 km on the clock and still going strong. Only stupid thing are the 9 mm belts, those rip like nothing. Anything else works like a charm üòÄ
