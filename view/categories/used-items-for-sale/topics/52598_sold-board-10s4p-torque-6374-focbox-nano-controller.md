I made an electric skateboard this past summer expecting to use it in college but have not used it at all because I ended up getting a car. This board is fully functional, but does not include an enclosure. Will also include battery charger. I was too scared to reach top speed so not sure what it is but the calc.esk8.it estimates ~25mph. Super long battery range and I have ridden less than 10 miles on the board so everything is basically new. Strongly prefer to sell the full build. I spent upwards of about $1000 without tax so asking for $800. If located in LA or bay area I can deliver.

Did you build the battery yourself, or where did you get it? Do you know what kind of cells were used?
