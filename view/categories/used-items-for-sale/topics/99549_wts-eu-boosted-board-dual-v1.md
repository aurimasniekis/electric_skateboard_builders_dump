Hi,
Because I'm living alone and having a lot of boards, I'm willing to sell my Boosted Board V1 dual +. 
It's still working well and is in good condition. 
I'm selling for cheap because I assume the mileage is really high. 
The battery is still OK and I'm giving some spares belt in case. 

I'm willing 300 euros or  325 CHF + shipping to eu. ![15646847592198072358562430229722|374x500](upload://31TP5CgiVKHjwM7GbPLoCVgqodF.jpeg) ![1564684823165787575334090756184|374x500](upload://dqIztieuGEOemOXTtOZ6nWXaKf9.jpeg) ![android|250x500](upload://wbEbXS4YmNrVfJW9bOphCJOCEh0.jpeg)
