Selling a big lot of parts that I ended up only ever using for a few months before letting them collect dust in the garage.

Imgur link for pictures of parts: https://imgur.com/a/U62Unol

PARTS:
- Tacon Big Foot 160 245kV Motor **SOLD**
- Hobbywing Xerun 150a ESC 
- iMAX B6AC V2 Balance Charger/Discharger 
- Caliber II Trucks - Midnight Satin Blue **SOLD**
- 83MM Blue Flywheels w/ Bones Reds Bearings
- Enertion Aluminum Wheel Pulley and Carbon Fiber Mounting Kit 
- GT2B Transmitter/Receiver 
- Enertion Carbon Fiber Motor Mount **SOLD**

All parts were bought and assembled a few years back with the help of this forum (which now look like the caveman days compared to the progress I see in the community and technology now!) - but sadly couldn't commit to the hobby due to time restraints.

Located in SoCal - Make me a fair offer.

UPDATE - Some interest has been shown for a few individual parts, anyone have a need for some of the other ones? Would like to avoid being stuck with any if I sell them Ã  la carte

Iâ€™m doubting these days that esc would get you much traction. Theyâ€™ve come a long way...
The hobby charger you could probably list locally, along with the trucks and wheels. Just some thoughts....
