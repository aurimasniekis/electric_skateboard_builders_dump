Hey All, I am parting with my tried and true Carvon V2.5 single hubs as I don't really need additional builds at the moment and am more than satisfied with my Dual V3. What you see in the pics is what you get and they do not come with any front trucks. They have the black anodized sleeves, trucks and carbon fiber hub caps. They have typical cosmetic wear and tear but otherwise in good working condition. Do a search on these forums for all my video and review posts if you want to know how much I love these things. Selling for $150 a piece or $250 for the pair (not including shipping). US shipping only. Send me a PM if you're interested.
