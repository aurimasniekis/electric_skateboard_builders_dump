I've got a Loaded Vanguard I am trying to get rid of. I bought a Tesseract and have no need for a Vanguard. Price is $155 via PayPal and shipping charges depend on your location. PM me for shipping quotes.

Do you have pictures? I'd swap the too. Do you have trucks and wheels or do you just want to do a deck exchange?
