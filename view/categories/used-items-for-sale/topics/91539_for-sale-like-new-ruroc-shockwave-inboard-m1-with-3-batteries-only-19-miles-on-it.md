$50 shipped in the US - Ruroc Shock Wave

$750 Pick up in Irvine CA - InBoard M1 with 3 batteries with only 19 miles on it. **Or Best Offer!**

This was from their Black Friday sale? Got it for $80 plus shipping. It fits the last generation 2016-2018 BEFORE they put in the blue Rhoen lining. This is said to fit M/L/XL. Was used in two morning rides (not sweaty hot days üòâ) and worked well but I just don‚Äôt wear the Ruroc as much as the TSG to make this useful. I might send it in a smaller box to save on postage

Selling the board I never use. I travel once a year for work and brought this with me once üòí. company then moved trade show to 15 minute away now so no point in owning it. Anyone in LA/OC/SD wanna buy and pick up? Damn InBoard knocked the price down so I‚Äôm asking for a lower price. Board is like new, with three batteries. One charger and one remote. If I have to ship then buyer pays $50 more.

SOLD - $50 shipped in the US - Landwheel Hub Motors
Cleaned up my garage this past weekend and pulled out a set of Landwheel hub motors I had forgotten about. These things have basically a few meters of ‚Äúuse‚Äù then tested on test bench. From my experience, motors are good and has plenty of power. LW esc and batteries was what sucked badly resulting in FIVE iterations before the final ‚Äúgood‚Äù drive.

[/quote]

shouldn't be a problem I tested them on Vesc-x. Never plugged in sensors though. they wired it different with their esc. So for VESC it needs to be like this https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landwheel-hall-sensor-wiring-for-vesc/51323

Lol it‚Äôs $999 on Amazon with a Hat. Do you have the hat @Mikenopolis

If he does that‚Äôs probably why he‚Äôs priced it this way. That hat is basically as valuable as gold evolve motors. üòÇ

I know, but I don't charge TAX. Honestly it's hard to let go seeing that It was $1299 plus tax, then $299 + $299 for each battery. Got it for travel purpose and ended up not traveling. InBoard dropping their price like crazy suck.

Anyway. I'm OPEN TO OFFERS...yes yes I know, bidding starts a $1, but let's be reasonable. Valid offer get basically gets a new board, I get to lose a lot but gain space for the next build.

I do you one better, I have a CarvOn hat. that's as rare as a unicorn

yup. board, batteries, charger and remote for $600. I just looked, that board was $1,399

Shipping is gonna cost me around $50 so if buyer can pay or at least split that, it would be appreciated.

just you pay the $600 over two months at zero interest. But this kind of financing means you get the good after you've paid in full. so more like a layaway :rofl:

Try on Reddit. I'm sure someone will cough up at least $600 for this.
