So I'm sad to say this but I'm selling my brand new CNC. My partner bailed on me because of personal issues right when we were about to launch our brand. Any way water under the bridge, it's a Millwright Carve King cnc with a custom cnc'd router mount and an upgraded 2.25hp Makita router, black starboard and homing switches. We used it twice to cut out a set of aluminum motor plates that came out looking great. Aside from two test cuts the machine is brand new and working as expected. I really don't want to let this go, but I live on a sailboat and although its a decent sized boat the cnc is too big/loud/power hungry to move aboard.  
Brand new and unassembled the machine cost $1039, custom cnc'd router mount $180 and the Makita 2.25hp router $189, +3 2 flute end mills designed to cut aluminum/steel $100+,  $1508 total not including taxes and shipping. Asking $1200 obo, Local delivery or pick it up in San Diego CA. Not eligible for shipping. Ill post pictures soon.

Pictures of the sailboat and CNC would increase the level of interest by at least 1000%
:smiley: Greetings from Europe! I'm just replying because I sail as well. :slight_smile:
But on little ones, because I live in the middle of Germany.

Is it really great to live on water like that ?
Like wetness, salt, problems that can happens to a boat, the fact that you need to take it out of the water sometimes... 
And how much room (like general surface) you got inside ? 
Would love your input

I love it. The boat stays nice and dry during the summer but can be a challenge to deal with moisture if you don't have proper insulation or a good heating element during winter time. As for salt, I haven't really noticed it. I wash everything down with fresh water a few times a week and it's not an issue. Every 3 to 5 years or more the boat does need to be pulled out of the water for a new coat of paint depending on many factors but its not that bad or expensive. Most boat yards let you live in the boat while its being worked on so we dont't get displaced. As for how much room we have,  it feels like living in a small 2 bed apartment that has a huge deck. Compaired to sail boats in the same LOA (length overall) mine has one of the biggest interiors. Two full bedrooms with queen beds and private heads (bathrooms). In the master cabin we have a seperate shower/tub combo that's not at all common but very welcomed. Some of the things that suck are having to deal with plumbing issues that involve black water. It's a very gross undertaking. Also cleaning bilge's isn't fun.

 But it's all worth it the moment I hoist the sails and the boat suddenly springs to life as they take form and pull you along. It's a deeply personal experience to control something so big under so much force, you become connected to it as if it were a part of you. I just feel freedom and empowerment in its most purest form.

Awesome.
I lived on a sialboat for 8 years, and I'm certain those memories will bring a smile to my face when I'm on my deathbed. Definitely not for everyone, but if you're here reading about how to scrap an electric skater together, you might find that the cost is worth the payoff. Freedom, mate, freedom... Fair winds, shipmate!

We've been slipped in San Diego bay for a year and a half practicing and gaining the experience and confidence to eventually cruise long term. Our plan is to either take the panama canal, cross the gulf and the Atlantic over to the EU. Or shoot for the south pacific and make our way towards New Zealand and Australia. I discovered esk8 because I was looking for an alternative mode of transportation other than a bicycle and fell in love.
