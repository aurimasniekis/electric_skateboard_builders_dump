Selling my torque boards 6355 190kv. I just bought it, maybe 30 miles on it. Not the hill climbing performance I need so I’m going 6374. I can send whoever wants it a copy of my order to prove it’s relatively new, I bought them on Memorial Day weekend. Asking 70$ Shipped to cont us.Payment only through PayPal. Motor runs great, it current has the stock 6 pin connector cut off, I can solder a connector on that plugs directly into a VESC if you want.
