Some months back I have bought a boosted V1 from another forum member. It was shipped from the VS to Belgium. Due some other projects I have running is the board laying on the shelf and waiting for a new owner :stuck_out_tongue: somebody who can give him some love. Put in a vesc and battery and you are ready to go.

I have paid 400euro for the board incl shipping from the VS to Belgium and custom cost.

So that is also the price I want for it.

The board comes with the original esc (only 300miles on it). Remote and charger.

No battery cells! & no working BMS.

What you see is what you get
