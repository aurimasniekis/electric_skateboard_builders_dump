Its been used for probably about 25 cycles.  Still working beautifully.  Will come with charger (2A).
Only thing missing is the little charging plug cover but they are like $1.50 on eBay.  Perfect for a cruiser or entry level board.  Bought for $200, selling for $140 OBO.

Willing to buy it if you still have the battery. Been a lurker for a while but I'm starting my first build.
