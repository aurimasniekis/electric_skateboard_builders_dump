I have a pair of torqueboards' 36T ABEC PULLEY COMBO KIT

They include 36t 5M 12mm wheel pulleys for abec wheels, all hardware included for mounting wheel pulleys,  13t 5M 12mm motor pulleys with keyway for 8mm shafts, as well as 265-5M-12 belts

I used these for about 5 months. Don't need anymore since I'm running pneumatics now. 

It is exactly what is listed here: (except mine is 13T motor pulley) 

collections/electric-skateboard-pulley-belt-combo-kits/products/36t-abec-pulley-combo-kit

These kits go for $47 each brand new, or $94 for a dual setup. 

I'm selling my two kits for $60 shipped priority mail within CONUS.
