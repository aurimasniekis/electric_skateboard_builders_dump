Hello,
Before I put this stuff on ebay, I like to see if there is anyone interested in these things.
I have brand new ESC form alien power sistem : http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/alien-120a-2-7s-ev-mini-esc-sensored-bec/
and this little used motor: http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-5065-outrunner-brushless-motor-220kv-2200w/

if you are going to correct people, you should correct them to the correct "spelled" place. 
I have seen you do it multiple times now.
