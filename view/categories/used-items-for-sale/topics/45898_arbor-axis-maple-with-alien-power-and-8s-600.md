This is a barely used (less than 40 miles) Arbor Axis board (see below for details).  I just never ride like I thought I would.  Custom fiberglass enclosure for the hardware, comes with charger.   The digital battery display does not work.  Comes with bluetooth to use extended bldctool developed by @Ackmaniac.   See pics and let me know if you have any questions.

^^This is a tag from my original build post.  which you can see [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/arbor-axis-maple-aps-6374-240kv-tb-vesc-8s-6ah-lipo-tb-single-mount-kit-caliber-ii-50s-abec-83mm-aps-remote/14217).  After multiple attempts at the enclosure I am well over $1000 into the board, but I only included the price of what components are actually on it (lots of failed attempts at enclosures).

you know what they say...third board's a charm.   or maybe I made that up...probably the latter.

It's hard to sell a full board here 
Selling in parts might be the way to go
I'll take the remote if your sell parts
