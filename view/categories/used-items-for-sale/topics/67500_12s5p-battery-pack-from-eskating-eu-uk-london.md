12S5P battery pack for sale - £480

Came in my dual beast from eskating.eu - specs [here](https://eskating.eu/product/flat-12s5p-eskating-electric-skateboard-battery-samsung-30q/)

I have done less than 50 miles (that's being conservative!) on the board and the battery has been charged between 20% to 80% about two/three times.

I'm 'downgrading' to 29" deck for something more portable and suitable for my commute. Planning to move the parts across to the new deck but the battery wont fit. Hence I'm selling this and will buy a 10S3P. 

Alternatively, if you're interested in the whole board, let me know. 

Based in W.London but can deliver/meet-up in London and surrounding areas. From what I've read, I'm not sure I can legally ship the battery.

Comes with charger.

I was planning on selling the deck and enclosure separately but I can do a deal if you want the enclosure too.

The board is fantastic and that's why I'm transferring most of the parts over to the new deck but it's just too big and heavy for my commute which involves lugging it around through train stations and storing it on the train.

I'm trying to build this so if anyone has a flat 10S3P that will fit the Unik enclosure, I would take that as part of the deal.
