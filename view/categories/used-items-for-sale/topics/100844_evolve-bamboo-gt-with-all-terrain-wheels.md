Hello guys, I know this is a place for Esk8 builders only but I thought someone may be interested in this board.
This is an Evolve Bamboo GT still under warranty, I bought it in May, and I used it too little, unfortunately I have no time to ride lately and I want to sell it.
It has no connection issues and any problems at all, if you want a dimostrative video feel free to ask, I paied 1350 Euro to Evolve Germany and what Iâ€™m asking is 900 Euro.
