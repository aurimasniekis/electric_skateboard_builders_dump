Have some items for sale that have just been lying around. Was into building a year ago but now just have a bunch of parts so i'm just trying to get rid of them.

Sk3 6374 149kv motor (grinded the shaft so that it has room for a key when attached to a pulley) - $60 never used comes with original box and everything in it

2x Flourean 22.2V 45C 4500mAh lipo batteries (comes with used 6 cell charger for free)- $35 each or $60 for both

I have a few extra stuff, most is shown in the last picture that I'm willing to throw in for free if you need any of the items. 

Free items that I can throw in with a purchase:

Mini remote with receiver
36/16 pulley set with screws and plate
90MM replica flywheel set of 4 used
Locitite blue
3x 255-5m belt
3x 265-5m belt
Random connectors
Battery percentage display

Free shipping. Only willing to ship within the US. Willing to go through paypal invoice if you pay the fees.![IMG_2008|375x500](upload://2vpPuTjkNRZLoquaroZibeID4L.jpeg)  ![IMG_2009|375x500](upload://iZRxmGjlgvFz3eV9BHLRc1C2wad.jpeg) ![IMG_2012|666x500](upload://aCs01tvE0r9EcZswADFgwwyvT6w.jpeg) ![IMG_2017|375x500](upload://mVm0rZPpxBvFVmUxskR4GIABuhh.jpeg) ![IMG_2011|375x500](upload://4hQgRwubZFjQs8P42VGK8WTgoxI.jpeg)
