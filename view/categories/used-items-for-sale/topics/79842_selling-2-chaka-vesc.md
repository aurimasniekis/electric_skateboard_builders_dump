You can turn them down in software.  You want to keep those...

Did you get them without heatsink on one side and the aluminum plate on the other?
I never tried any other VESCs than Chaka‚Äôs 4.12 so I don‚Äôt have any idea on how they compare to others but those are great. Good luck.

Dude, how could they not be right for your build? 

When I set them up, I limited battery amps to 20a between the pair because the 10sp2 you have is made of cells that can do 10a per P group, and that‚Äôs the burst rating. 

I mentioned they were Chaka vescs so that if you get a higher rated battery, you would know that you should upgrade the tiny leads and bullet connectors I threw on, but that the PCB was solid. The leads on your hubs are also a limiting factor. 

Anyways, to potential buyers, they powered a raptor 1.0 back in the day (2016). @Longhairedboy set it up after I bumbled my first ever attempt at using BLDC tool on a pair of ancient enertion 4.8s(4.7?) and I learned to fear the sparks. I didn‚Äôt ride them hard. Never saw 12s voltage. 

Fun fact: they were shipped from Arizona to me in Maryland, then to Longhairedboy in Florida, then back,  then went to Hawaii, the Okinawa Japan for a few months. In Japan, I thought I killed an Okinawan local tinder date who was reasonably good, but got ballsey and wanted to top it out. I couldn‚Äôt catch her on my stock carbon GT. She wrecked and cracked her helmet. 

They also powered my carbon GT for a few weeks after I bumbled a 18650 swap with @E1Allen in Kailua hawaii.

And this is the type of background report we should expect when buying used electronics, especially a vesc

I've got no reason to buy these, but I would be much more receptive after reading that, good job :)
