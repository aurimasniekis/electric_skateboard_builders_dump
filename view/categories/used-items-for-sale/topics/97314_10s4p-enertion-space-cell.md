I bought the battery in December couldn't use it until April (because of rough Canadian winter) I've been using it for about 3 months. All cells are perfectly balanced and the pack is in good condition. Comes with bms already installed and 2a charger.

Let me know if you interested. I will be shipping from Canada.
