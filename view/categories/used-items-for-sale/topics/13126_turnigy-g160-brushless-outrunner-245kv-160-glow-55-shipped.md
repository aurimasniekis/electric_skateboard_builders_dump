Whats the bottom line? I build boards for people who in most casses can't afford e-boards.  It's not just about
the money it's about when we were little and wanted something with a passion but parents couldn't afford it. Not trying to pull on your heart strings just giving you a little background on what I do. If you'ed like to see what I do you can go to www.kickedoutskateboards.com to see I'm not full of **it. lol, Hope to hear from you soon and thank you!
