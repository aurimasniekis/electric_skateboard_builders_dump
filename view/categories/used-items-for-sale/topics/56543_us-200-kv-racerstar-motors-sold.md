I am selling these motors because they are a bit more than what I need; the top speed exceeds what I usually ride at, so I am ordering the 140kv motors instead. I rode with them twice before deciding that it was not for me. 

Unfortunately, the family pupper got a bit bitey and chewed on one of the motors; specifically on 2 quick connectors. While the motor still connects just fine, as I was able to do the rides afterwards, I am dropping the price of each to $20, or $40 total for the pair. This will not include shipping. 

Edit @16h - The motors have been sold as of now.

These would be perfect for an 8S build.

Would you throw in the pulleys for an extra $5?

Nope, sorry, those came with my evolve at kit, not with the motors.

It’s best to buy the motor and the pulley together or it’s another long wait.

These motors have worked out well for one of my builds. It was a 10s build and has hit 30mph. (Dual)
The board has probably done around 1000 miles. 
Any pulley with a grubscrew will do. 
Good luck with your sale!
