Umm. Yeah it is. But if you have to ask that I would look else where for a remote. This one might not be for you.

The battery is new, and it hasn't been used at all. Assembled just a few days ago.

Replacing the hall sensors is super easy and cheap. I just recently made the repair on a pair of 6374's.

So I was lurking for a while and didn't get an account for a while, so I don't think I can send a PM.

I am interested in buying the remote, the catch being that I'm not in the US.

I can dish out a tad more to cover international shipping.
