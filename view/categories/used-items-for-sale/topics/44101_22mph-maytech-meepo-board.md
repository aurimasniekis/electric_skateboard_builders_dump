He is too new to the forums to link is my assumption. But I think he is talking about an amazon board. I will not even mention the boards name because then it would be advertising.

This forum is a proggressive forum. IE the more time you spend here and the more posts you do the more privaliges you get. 

I do not see any pictures. You might have to spend more time on the sight to post pics.

Yup see it now. Just an FYI people will be curious about these questions: how much are you charging? Are there any issues? Why are you selling?
