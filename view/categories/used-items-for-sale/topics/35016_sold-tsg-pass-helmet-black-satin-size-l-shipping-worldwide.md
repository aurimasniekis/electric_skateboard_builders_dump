Worn for only about 2 - 3 times from a friend of mine.
Was kind of my spare helmet, which i have no real use for.

It rolled over a piece of not really dry painted wood, so i had to pollished it but there a still some little white marks on it.
Other than that nearly brand new.
Comes with the original package with all the stuff like second visor and things you see in the picture.

**130 € shipped in EU countries**
