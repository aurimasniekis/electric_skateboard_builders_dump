Hi ! :grin:
I bought a lot of equipment 2 years ago but in the end I used it very little, I though I coud get ridiculous acceleration [like in that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhRYiQufwF4) with a single motor lol, but nop so I prefer using my electric bike, that is why I sell everything. 

Everything has been used about 10-15 times, except the VESC which I received for free a few months ago, it is new, I only used it on 1/2km to see if it changed my opinion on skateboarding compared to cycling but it is not the case so here is the list :smiley: :

(I will add real pictures later)

ESC 120A (works pretty good with e-skate, but the acceleration and brake are really strong so you need a belt that can handle the torque)

I live in France, but depending on where you live the shipping can actually be quite cheap in EU (with mondial relay for exemple).

If you bought another Lipo and atttached then in series your acceleration would go way up 

Your voltage is just not high enough

Well it's also because the 12mm wide motor pulley can't handle insane torque, but it's not the subject of this thread :smile:

No but seriously

Why give up a sick sport like esk8 just because of an acceleration problem which could be fixed for under $100 just by a new pulley a new belt and another Lipo. All sorted

Someone made me realise somehting, I said "sold x€" on every product I sell, but that doesn't mean their sold, it's just a bad translation, so I replaced the "sold" word with "selling it for"
