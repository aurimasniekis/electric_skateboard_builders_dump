I'm in EU (Sweden) my prebuilt Landwheel broke down. Now looking to do a VESC conversion. Preferably I want someone with a parts within EU because shipping batteries is always a hassle.

I already have two VESCs, working motors, wheels, trucks, board, enclosure all sorted. All I need now is a battery and a remote.

I'm pretty new to all this, I'm not sure 100% what I need specifically. But I have been recommended a pack with 10s 2p Samsung cells. I will be using a flipsky vesc with Landwheel hub motors. Any advice/offers is appreciated.
