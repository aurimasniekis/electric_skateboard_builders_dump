Hey guys, got 1 set of pink abec 11, and 4 sets of green abec 11, the green set I would like 120 for, and the pink set is the best offer, these wheels are real rare but do have some fading in color, like the pink wheel looks more orange then pink, so beat it and it‚Äôs yours, you pay shipping. Have some pulleys for them, extra 20$ per one, PayPal is Karamqudeimat@gmail.com, 120 for all green sets!!!!!!!![image|666x500](upload://e3KggeE9CUd82KkYGZvHrHzZGP0.jpeg)

I must add, the fact that @karamq sourced these deadstock wheels is not only very impressive - _where_ he found them is kind of amazing. :) 

Well done.

pulleys

the first time I ever saw a 107 was on a now-defunct esk8 pioneer called Altered Boards, who worked with Chris Chaput, the inventor of the wheel that changed the world:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jsUjvL8rdo

Chris was also an early influencer in the development of Hamboards.  Bonafide world champion skater, inventor.  @psychotiller calls Chris a friend, as many here do.

In any case, to find these super-rare 107s, Karam found what has to be the last rack of Altered Boards completes in the world. Full retail demo rack with 4-5 completes on it (from an all-star builder, here, no less).

A true, esk8 barn find :)

These are unicorn unobtainium with a very small market.  You've saturated the market.  Pull them off the market for 8 months then put one set up for auction at a time and you'll sell, and for a much higher price

Yeah @KaramQ, pull the plug as @b264 suggested. These guys don't deserve them. Electric Flywheels are unobtainium. I've seen lots of people here begging for these wheels, now that you are offering them everybody is mute! Fck'em. Close the tread and make them suffer. They will come for you later crawling and begging for these Flywheels, you'll see.
