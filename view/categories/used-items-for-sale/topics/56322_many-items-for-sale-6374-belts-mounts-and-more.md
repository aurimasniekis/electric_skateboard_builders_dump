A TB 6374. It was having a few issues; it would stutter when I gave it throttle even with no load. If I gave the board a push it would work fine. I was running unsensored. The sensor wires are there, but they have been trimmed short. They are tinned and ready to be soldered to. Here's a video of the stutter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqDQX3jzf3E $55 for the stuttery motor. $10 shipping;

Two volt meters. Both have a green display. The lunacycle meter displays volts, and the other shows percent. The clear meter is 12s only, as the switch to cycle between voltages has been removed. You could replace it if you wanted to though. The small connector goes with the lunacycle meter. $10 each and $5 shipping.

The Vesc I bought from you does not work. I have tested my new board with another Vesc and it worked.
