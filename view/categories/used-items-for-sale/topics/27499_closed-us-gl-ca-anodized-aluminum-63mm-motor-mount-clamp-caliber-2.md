Hi Community 
Late night post, I have been building lot of eskate for myself and friends, yet i still have a lot of problem with motor mounts, some are good but can not mount to rear end, or nuts get loose when riding - I believe everybody  had this problem like I did. 
So I decided to CNC small motor mount with standard clamp ( raw cut pictures below), I made the screw hole differently, total of 6 on the clamp and can be mount securely with 3, allowing room for adjustment, it can also mount rear end as well. Mount are designed for 63mm motor. 
I already made myself a couples and can also make a couple more for those in need of Caliber 2 63mm mount. 
I live in Fountain Valley, CA and can deliver or pick up locally for 45$ each, shipping statewide for  another 5$.

Specs: 
Motor size : 63mm slide-able 
Clamp : Caliber 2 
Including : 6 Clamp screw + 6 Nylock nuts + 6 Spring Washers. ( this combination is very secure), six angle screw 
Color : Anodized in Black/Green/Blue (TBA) 
Material : Aircraft Aluminum
Mount Style : Rear or Front. 

item are ready as soon as need week. 

I want to know if anyone interested :) and willing to meet more people locally. 

RAW CUT w/o Anodized.
