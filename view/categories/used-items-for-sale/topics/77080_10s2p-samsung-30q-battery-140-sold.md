It's in my board at the moment, but I will put pictures up once I get a chance to work on the board. Its sticker got peeled off because of the sticky foam that Ownboard uses to seal their enclosures but I'll post photos of my receipt.

Receipt doesnt really tell us what we want to know. We want to know the quality of the battery, wiring, connectors, wrap,... Plus not to mention, picture are required on all sale threads.

Photos along with receipt from Ownboard website since the sticker peeled off from the sticky foam they use on their boards. As you can see battery is clean and undamaged, I can remove the sticker gunk before shipping.
