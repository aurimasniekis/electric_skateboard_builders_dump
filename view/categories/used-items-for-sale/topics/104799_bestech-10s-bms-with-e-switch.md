Forgot that I still had this knocking around. Still completely unused, was never installed or wired up, so it's just a brand-new Bestech 10s BMS! 

It's the high charge/discharge model, so it's pretty much the best you can get for a 10s system. [Link](http://www.bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D596.html)

 - Â£33 plus postage (probably be about Â£10, depending on where you are). 

Happy to post anywhere in the EU, but I'm based in the UK so that's preferred.

well this escalated quickly. And no, I wouldn't post to Australia for someone with only one post on the forum. Though this is now 30 days old so I suspect you've found a replacement anyways!

Hey I'm interested and would take it.

Want to use it for a 10s Lipo Battery Pack. 

I'm located in Germany.
