Located in New York. 
Used motor (about 2-3 miles on it at most) Works perfectly fine.
No mounting screws but has a 16 tooth motor pulley.
Selling because I bought a different motor
Looking for about SOLD PayPal + however much shipping is in your country...

Correct, no sensor wire. I don’t even think they come with sensor wires…
