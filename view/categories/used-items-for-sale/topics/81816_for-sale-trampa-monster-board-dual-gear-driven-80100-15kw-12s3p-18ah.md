FocBox running 150A Motor/Bat amps
[/quote]
Is this per focbox or for both? Is batt max and motor max the same?

So your running 150 batt amps each? 300 total? I thought the max that the focbox could measure was 140.

I haven't heard about 140A, but I just assigned 150A and absolute max is 200A as I was getting a lot of `FAULT_CODE_ABS_OVER_CURRENT` with values near 180A so I don't know how it measures that but it works for me without issues :)

**EDIT:** I am running unlimited firmware as firmware limits 100A and 150A abs

Hehe, it is really fun and scary board I think it's one of the most powerful ones here in forum. It was amazing project and I liked it very much but at the moment my life style and work is changing so less and less time I pick it up plus the weather right now is not much suitable for riding. So in the end even if I keep it as weekend board and etc, everyone knows that LiPos don't really like to be standing doing nothing you need to move the energy around to stop the batteries from degrading :)

I will be adding a lot of parts for sale like 35Âº risers, evo deck, trucks and etc stuff as I am doing house cleaning. I will probably will be building something really light in the spring time which I could jump on and drive for few kilometers and carry it like its nothing with ultra fast charging :slight_smile:

But right now I want to focus on the works and etc.
