Hey guys,

Bought the VX2 for $99USD 2 months ago, but prefer to use the VX1.

Next to no use, comes in original box.

Item located in Sydney, Australia, will ship if buyer pays for shipping.

Throw in your best offer!

I find the VX1 fits in my hand better, and that I don't really look down when I ride therefore I don't see the point in the VX2.

But I guess everyone has different preferences

Don't you have to choose v4 or v6 for the vx2? Which hardware version does it suit?

Does this one have the huge deadband?
@glyphiks There is a VX2 pro colour model after this one which works with all (inc unity) just needs to use a different provided connector to accommodate the different pinout. It also has switchable MPH?KMH

I think this one is just called the Vx2, the vx2pro is the one with the colour screen.

Should just be a simple swap of the rx/tx pins on the receiver plug? The pro version however does work with the unity where this one doesn‚Äôt I believe?
