Thanks for your help, I've been away from the hobby quite a while and things have changed ! That first picture is the same as my esc, I've pressed the red button while switching on the esc and get a solid green light on it but nothing from the Tx (steering servo is working) !

Sorry, I meant nothing happens to the light on the esc using the throttle on the Tx.
