Hi guys,

I am selling my H2 electric skateboard with dual hub motor. The 10s2p (?) Li-ion battery seems to be dead (20V) but the rest should be fine.
Selling the board for AUD $40.

Board is pretty heavy, shipping will be expensive.

Did you build this board? Do you have parts list? Do you have pictures of it?

Post more pictures this afternoon. Nope, I bought it yesterday. It has two China generic hub motors, a simple ESC, nice and sturdy metal battery enclosure which seems to be sealed and a wooden deck.

Could you define a bit more of how its "dead"?
And where are you located?

The 10s2p battery shows 20.5V on the multi-meter. Everything else worked fine.
I am in Sydney.
