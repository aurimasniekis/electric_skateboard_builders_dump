Great looking board! I have done some research and noticed this to be a premiere esk8 builder! I have a few questions...1) Have you experienced any issues at all with this board or remote? 2) Being a DSS60, what is the range you have gotten with moderate and aggressive riding/carving/off-road usage? 3) I live in VA, if I was interested in it, would you be willing to meet halfway or ship the board? Thanks!
