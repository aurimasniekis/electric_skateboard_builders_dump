Excellent condition. Perfect mechanical order.
Some cosmetic wear on motor from rubbing into an accessory I had too close but no effect on performance or durability. Selling because where I live in Brooklyn, traffic is too nuts for this ride. It deserves better. It will hit about 33-34mph with current 16:40 gearing.16:36 will get you 37mph. Also, with the Flywheels Arbor combo it's super stable. You'll get past 20mph and still think you're in slow mode.

No idea on the bolts. I didn‚Äôt build it. Matt McCrary did. My guess is virtually all hardware comes from Torqueboard

I average anywhere from 12-15 miles depending on terrain and speed. Batt is 12s2p from Torqueboard
