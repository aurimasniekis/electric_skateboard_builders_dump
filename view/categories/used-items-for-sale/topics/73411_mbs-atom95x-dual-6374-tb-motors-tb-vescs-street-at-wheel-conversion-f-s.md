To make them fit you need the right size bearings for the wheels and your truck’s axel. For my board, I have the MBS ATS trucks that have a 9.5mm axel. I went to www.MBS.com and they have a bearing that has an outer dimension of 22mm (that’s what fits in the MBS All Terrain wheel) and an inner dimension of 9.5mm and BOOM wheels fit.

I don’t think it’s an old style, just another style. I don’t know who would make those bearings but you need 22mm outer dimension and 12mm inner dimension. Try googling it and see if you can find em!
