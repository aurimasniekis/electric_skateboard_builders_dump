Hello, I'm looking to sell my Evolve Bamboo GT which I purchased new directly from Evolve for $1560 total in November.

I'm asking for $1100.

I've taken excellent care of it since getting it, never abusing it. I'm not able to pinpoint an exact number as to how many miles I've logged onto it, but my best guess is somewhere from 300-500 miles. The board is in great condition, the board itself has not had any bad things happen to it really, just normal riding to and from class. The metal motor mounts are a little scuffed on the ends of them, since I normally stand the board on them like in the photos.

I'm choosing to sell this because I have tendinitis in my knee and it's hard to ride with it.

The original box, charger and remote will be included. I got a new remote on May 4 as well, so the remote is also in almost new undamaged condition. I'm located in Northern California near Sacramento, and also in East Bay Area when I'm visiting some weekends.

Maybe you should try and sell this on the Evolve forum. Most people here are DIYers. Also post it on ebay and Craigslist if you are in America

Good call, I did post on Craigslist but figured there's a slim possibility someone may be interested. If not, it can be ignored.
