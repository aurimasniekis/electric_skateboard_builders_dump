Selling slightly used inner gear drive from 3dservisas, packaged and ready to go. Need some funds for my other builds so this will have to go. 

**150 usd with shipping**

Compatible with trampa trucks. 

There's some scratching on the motor gear, but it doesn't affect performance.

oh cause replying here on the forums requires you to write out at least 10 characters. 10char is just filler so short replies like "yup" can be made.
