**Located in San Diego, California.**
Hi everyone. So I haven't touched my board since February because I had something going on with my 10s5p battery everytime I rode out. It wouldn't charge all the way and I'm not sure why. I haven't done a lot of homework on it, so I kind of just left it.. 

 On top of that, life hit me with a lot of things and I just finished school so I won't be riding around any longer. I've only been riding for about 30 miles, and then I just gave up on trying to fix it. ):

Anyway, here are the things I'll be selling:

**SOLD** Wheels:  Abec 11 x Evolve F1 (107mm/74a) w/ original bearings - **SOLD**
![IMG_20190710_222334|666x500](upload://4L8WJDVVIdNdfftwqB5hGx8N37j.jpeg) 

Wheel Drive: 2x TB 36T Abec Drive 12mm - **$45 for both**
![IMG_20190710_222312|666x500](upload://2e6ieX3JicUT73uuQ3GhwW2zMVd.jpeg) 

**SOLD** Wheel Drive: 2x TB 36T Kegel Drive 15mm  - **SOLD**
![IMG_20190710_222317|666x500](upload://k0Jk0Bzt455wbkkVDKMjk4Vt75v.jpeg) 

**SOLD** Motor:  2x TB 6355 190KV attached to @Boardnamics Caliber II Mounts with Idler Tensioner   - **SOLD**
       **Note: I'm sorry, I cannot remove the motor mount because of the 16T motor pulley ): But it will come with all the hardware including belts. Again, sorry. I won't add any additional pricing to it because of this. **

Sorry guys, I'm doing it on a first come first serve basis. Some people have PMed me first. Currently, both focboxes are pending. I will be updating the original post as time goes by. 

Does everyone get notifications when I edit the first post? Or is it only by new posts? If the latter, I'll keep it updated by doing both.

Hello everyone! Updated the post and items. Sorry I couldn't get back to most of the PMs, but if some of you were wondering, I went down the line of people who contacted me first about items. If those people weren't able to continue with the sale, then I contacted the next person who had dibs on it and there were many.

Thanks again for looking!
