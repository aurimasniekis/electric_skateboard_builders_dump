guys @barajabali / Chiboards makes AWESOME batteries. I've traveled to 3 countries with a 10s4p battery he made me. I ride 10+ miles a days for almost an entire year now and it STILL hasn't let me down.

about 15 cycles but never full discharge so maybe 10ish full cycles? 3 damaged cells were the issue however another had an issue with fishpaper on top so that was also replaced. All removed cells were replaced with brand new samsung 30q cells

This pack is priced right.  Stacked batteries are for sure more work to build.

Itâ€™s a very good battery and the only reason Iâ€™m selling is because I donâ€™t have a build that would need such a large battery, but anyone looking for a relatively compact high power battery then this is it, not to mention nearly no voltage sag if any. This is smaller length wise than a spacecell and only 14ish mm taller than a single cell flat pack

so i have never built a pack before... I understand the concept, but experience>books (in this case reading online) 

I am comfortable with welding the cells (i will have help in person) but i am curious as to the way the tabs are oriented. I keep hearing people talk about both copper and nickel for their packs and double layering stips... can you point me to a decent spot for info? I want to build the same style pack you have here (same size and orientation) for my Hummie deck w/ dual 6380 motors. Any advice is greatly appreciated

Sure Iâ€™d be glad to help but wouldnâ€™t it be easier to buy what you're going to have to make? Whatever you decide, if you want to build your own make a new thread and Iâ€™ll comment there
