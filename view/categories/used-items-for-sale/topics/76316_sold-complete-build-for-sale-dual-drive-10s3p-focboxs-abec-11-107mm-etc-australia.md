I'm selling my complete deck. It's only been used for around 30min. That's what happens when you have a baby. No time for hobbies. 

Extreme care was taken in building this with safety in mind. Cell level fusing (plus regular 40amp wiring fuse) for peace of mind. 

Well protected against vibration with gel damper pads, enclosed in a custom built aluminium enclosure, powder coated in a pearl white. Mounted to a carbon fibre reinforced Powell Peralta Samurai deck.

You can see from the photos that the wiring is elegant and simple (by using right angle joints). No messy spaghetti cables.

Everything is virtually brand new, no dirt, dints or scratches. In mint condition. Works perfectly and very powerful.

Over $1700 spent on this. 
**Selling for $700.**

Pick-up is from Melbourne AUSTRALIA. Can post anywhere in Australia. Inspections welcome.

What are the specs on the motors? And how easy/hard would it be to do a deck swap on it? 
Also can you give more details on how the battery was built.

The motors are 5065 150KV. 

A deck swap would be very easy, as long as the enclosure fits under you deck.

The battery pack was put together using 100% copper bus bars for maximum energy transfer and each cell has its own fuse. Each parallel pack is packed in hi temp rated wrap to add extra protection from other packs. Then the hole pack is wrapped in a clear shrink wrap for easy inspection. It was built for maximum safety and performance.

Yeah if this was US I would have bought this and hid it from my wife until my birthday.

Just looked up tickets $1100 round trip. Makes the board about what it's worth though.
