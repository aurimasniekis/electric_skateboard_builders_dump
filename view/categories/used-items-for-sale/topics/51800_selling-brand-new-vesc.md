Hello, I'm selling a brand new VESC speed controller. I bought it from enertionboards.com some time ago, but I never used it cause I never had the occasion to complete a project. The ESC is flawless as you can see from the photos. I'm selling it for 100 euros, shipping from Italy.

Looks like 4.12 to me, i have some from the same batch, they just work fine. But only up to 10S cause the big caps on the power wires are underspecced.
