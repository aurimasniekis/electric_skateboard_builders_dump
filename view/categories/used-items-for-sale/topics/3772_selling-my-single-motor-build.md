I am selling my board that I built right before winter last year. I don't have time to ride it or really finish the way I want. I have only ridden it a couple times, so it is pretty much new. I will even through in an extra motor if someone is interested in making it a dual motor build. The only thing I didn't get done was the enclosure. 

The board build is linked above. If you have any questions or want more pictures just let me know. As far as price goes I am open to reasonable offers.
