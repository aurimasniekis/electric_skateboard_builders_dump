Hey Fellow eSkaters and eMountain Boarders!

I have a Trampa eMountain Board and a bunch of gear for sale.  Sadly, I just don't get to ride it as much as I'd like.  On top of that, where I live, a One Wheel is far more convenient.  This board is a Beast and in Fantastic shape. 
I did replace the Battery pack with a Pelican Case to house the (x2) (larger) TATTU Plus LiPo Smart Battery Pack 22000mAh 22.2V 25C 6S and VESCs. I also have a 60 Amp Charging Station for the batteries and a big Ballistic Nylon Carry Bag for the board. There are also some spare belts, Trampa Dampas, and tire tubes.  Below is a more detailed list pulled right from my order invoice.  

1 x Electric Mountainboard BELT DRIVEN PRO - VERTIGO
     - 16ply 35Âº Electric Deck - STIFF 
     - GUNMETAL Anodized with Black logo Baseplate 
     - BLACK Powder Coated Springs 
     - RED DAMPA's - 80a Stiff Steering 
     - 136kv TRAMPA Motor - All Round Performance 
     - 14 Tooth - All Round gearing 
     - Matt Grey Naked Superstar Rim 
     - GUNMETAL Anodized Spokes 
     - 8 Inch BLACK Primo ALPHA Tires 
     - 12mm ATB 6001 2RS Bearings - BLACK x8 
     - Please set me up in a REGULAR ride Style (Left foot forwards) 
     - RATCHET Style Bindings please 
     - Carbon Print Strap with Black Foam Footstraps

     - GUNMETAL Anodized Ratchet Buckles

Serious Inquiries only.  Shipping will be from Zip Code 32814 for quoting purposes.  
I am asking $3500 OBO for the whole lot.  I'm not interested in piece-meals.  All or nothing.
