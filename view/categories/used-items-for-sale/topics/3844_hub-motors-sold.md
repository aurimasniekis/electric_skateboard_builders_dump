Not everyone is selling and I wouldn't be either if I wasn't 190lbs and living in hill country. These motors RULE on flat ground. There very fast and very smooth. There also very well built and durable. Just my TB Esc's kept overheating when going up long steep hills.

Yes, what a deal. I want to get these and make a 4wd setup with my other carvons. But I don't have $400 right now. (unless you could wait a few weeks until I get paid).

@Namasaki

Are you going to start a new build thread?  I'm really curious to see what you put together next.
