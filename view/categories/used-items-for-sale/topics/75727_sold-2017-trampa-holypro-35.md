Includes 3 22.2 V 5800 mah batteries and turnigy balance charger. Lots of extras not listed,  I also have one extra  trampa 136kv motor with sensor and a box of various spare parts $1900 for everything + shipping! Trampa + vesc six = Tesla of EMTB ing:) Super clean board was basically my transportation before I got my license back. I am an avid snowboarder so I felt very comfortable cruising at a steady 30mph via gps speedo and With more throttle to go! but I’m to scared to run this thing wide open, top speed is unknown but I would guess high 30’s possibly 40 mph. When running 2 sets of batteries together @ 44.4 v each set,  my range was close to 30 miles. Running only one pair of batteries I can go 14-17 miles consistently.  willing to negotiate a little. Text me for more info or pics. (435)219-3035 I am located in Utah.  Thanks for looking have an awesome day! ![image|666x500](upload://mmIz73p3pnTQd1box9bBYVm4TM0.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://2xDKZfDtdFwkOJj3leAPeH5BDyC.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://pdoQqEdFPjylMz9K70EshpSHfT4.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jhN9ihhHa8GxUTfHxhaLfCcVs4l.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://11TF2PUXYI5KjD6MsIQFrDkvbGk.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://r67YzBafNPbMBo4lSWyhkys87GZ.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://8UZ2SwFddK60nUIChkb41jJ7rOf.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://1HZA0QjO4PkdLufXEJ3xdhsoMa1.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://ywSCWvYr5dm0eYyIeBjYBsXyS5C.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://kbuAi1cQITOsRkYsY8dZ0CKoaHo.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://dEMAZL1ebF4J4s73av5goTfO9Xe.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://xKnECjTQ28LLwxG26WpFR3kEaS1.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://6B74vr2k6v22ZyMV8IxvzD6kCui.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://lE1BMtdcoDZ6kOT3ZpDDrGm4phi.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://5XZOBC3bS2wyJQ37pkGgkUSXuHj.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://6rq2bllIQ1UnDhy7A3nDFv0MDSh.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://jBfZ1P6eFnLNVwfU9dcWOoyC6Co.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://j5caXolSTMGpMkmKFOzOw1SAucJ.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://mo764d5lC4oSh75BMxSUbRga6dF.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://di9tzGIVLbm5KvhLRsvSxzIqwmp.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://e93dB1fGtZHG6kzJ6mriRFlBxSb.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://6UEflPQlWcky54jZMLxAaTR5Yu8.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://49XMpoiGDm6urmSxYtmHUPsYSGL.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://u34tNb99gHCeOSVW1rH0hqFH4vT.jpeg)

We’re you interested in the board sorry I got a lot of messages about it. But I would be more then willing to try and meet in the middle I’ve just been getting some low ball offers so it’s been frustrating me.
