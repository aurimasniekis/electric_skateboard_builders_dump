For sale in Canada (all you Canadian's who're sick and tired of being screwed by the shipping), I have a barely used, like new, 36T wheel pulley from DIYElectric. Used only to test. 5 KM's Max.

Sells for $37 US plus shipping, I'm looking to sell for **_$30 US plus shipping_**. If you live in Canadastan, this is a great deal, if you live in the states, it's an OK deal.
