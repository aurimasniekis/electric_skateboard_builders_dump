Asking 150€

**Whitepony Carbon enclosure**
Extremely light compared to my EBoosted enclosure. Fits a 12s4p (with a narrow BMS 50mm wide) 20700b cells if you have the ESC top mounted and a 10s4p 20700b cells if you want to have the esc in the case. Fitment seems spot on

3D printed 20700 cells (pic belongs to previous owner)

asking 45€ for it

175€ for both the deck and enclosure

Everything is located in Malmö, Sweden but can ship world wide at buyers expense but US shipping is 80€ (what our postal service charges not my ''proffit'') as a heads up,
Payment thru PayPal :slight_smile:

to make a new one but didn't want to make a new thread until the old one was gone cause that would be a bit spamming imo :) as everything ells is sold I wanted to make one just for the deck
