[Here is the thread I bought the deck from originally](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-germany-sold-never-summer-reaper-2016-deck-with-eboosted-encolsure-250/65576)

I have made a few changes to it since purchase:
1. Drilled holes in the enclosure for phase + sensor wires (8 holes in total)
2. Drilled 2 holes in the deck to hold down the phase wires as they come out of the enclosure to make sure they stay out of the way of the motors
3. Slightly opened up a couple of the mounting holes on the enclosure to make it easier to mount

I have ridden it once since I bought it but simply don't use it so might as well sell it. I haven't used it in about 3 months. Still in very good condition.
Here are some pictures of the changes. I'll take some better photos when I'm home next (away for the next 2 weeks)

I'm open for offers but looking to be as close to the 250 euros I paid for it (dropped to 220). You pay the shipping :smile: 
Note, this is for the deck and enclosure only. For more pictures, see the original thread above

Batteries are what I primarily want (will pay the extra), other than that, not really sure, just about to start work on my next board so if you have something in mind let me know and I'll have a look
