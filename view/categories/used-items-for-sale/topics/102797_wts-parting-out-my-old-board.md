Only very lightly used parts. I have ridden on them maybe all of two times. The parts I'm selling are as follows:

1 set of Caliber II Fifty Blackout Trucks (https://www.tactics.com/caliber/caliber-ii-fifty-longboard-trucks/blackout)

1 set of MBS All-Terrain Wheels 100mm (https://www.amazon.com/MBS-13401-All-Terrain-Longboard-Wheels/dp/B015GJN0BA/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=longboard+wheels&psc=1&qid=1570734830&sr=8-1)

1 Hi5ber Zenith (https://www.hi5ber.com/zenith)

2 6355 190kV Motors (https:///products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv)

1 12S4P Battery (https:///products/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-12s4p?variant=712901591063)

2 Motor Mounting Kits (https:///products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-w-drive-wheel-kit)

1 VESC (https:///products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller)

1 2.4 GHz Mini Controller (https:///products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller)

DM me with offers. I don't need to sell everything together, but the more you buy the better the price will be. I live in GA, but have to drive up to West Lafayette soon to grab the parts. So I can drop parts off along the route or meet up with anyone near me. If it needs to be shipped, then we can discuss how that factors into payment.

Edit: Adding pictures of the parts that I have pictures of. They aren't with me atm as is stated in the post, so I will add pictures of the rest when I retrieve them. Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/PAciJku

Edit 2: In terms of pricing, I'd happily part with the lot for $1100. If you would rather buy them individually the price will be higher, but we can negotiate in DMs.

Thanks! I added both. I don't have pictures of the battery or remote and they are in storage far away from me right now (as is mentioned in the post). I will happily provide pictures of them when I pick them up.
