@Skunk do you think there would be any merit on using just the front binding for a kicktail board?

I don't see a problem with it. Especially on a deck with a flat nose. Basically a overkill foot stop.
Would probably make doing manuals easier and give you a nice locked in feeling . @BruSkater

Sounds interesting... If any regular stanced (as in not goofy) member likes to split the bindings I am in!

Are the Haggy pulleys the ones with the integrated bearing?

Yes.  Intended for 12mm axles but with proper bearings fits 10mm axles.  ( surfrodz )
Last i talked to @riverside.rider he had made progress on setting them up for 8mm but you need trucks with long axles so caliber ll are a no go.

I was going to say I would take the spud but I would have to take all that paint off to burn a design in it. So I think @sender since you are getting the spud I think it need to get pepe le pew fabric on it.
