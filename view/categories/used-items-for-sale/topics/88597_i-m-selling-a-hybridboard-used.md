Hello Everybody!

I decided to build a smaller board because its a bit to heavy for me. 
So I'm going to sell this selfmade "Hybridboard". 
Called "Hybridboard" only because its half for street and half for allterrain. 
You can find all informations to the board there: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/14-year-old-boy-builds-hybridboard/80510

I'm thinking about 1300‚Ç¨ for the whole board. 
Newprice was ~1600‚Ç¨ (i think).

I can ship it everywhere in the EU. 

Please pm me, if you're interested or if you have any questions. üëç

Please make me an offer, if the price is to high for you. 

I cgarged it 4 times. 

10A charger is included but you also could use a 2 or 4A charger. 
It only depends on the charging time. 

A few short informations: 
-Samsung 30Q 12s4p battery. 
-Smartbms with smartphone app. 
-2x 6365 3500w motors. 
-Alienpowersystem 2,4 Ghz Remote. 
-3d printed enclosure. 
-All terrain wheels (EVOLVE).

Mind if I ask where you bought the 10A charger from? It looks super compact for that power so I'd like to buy one as well.

If you're tired of boards being heavy, take a look at [this board](https://forum./t/the-blue-one-12s-lifepo4-170kv-6374-caliber-2-30-43-powell-peralta-focbox/75).  Heavy, long-range boards ***definitely*** have a place, but for most rides I prefer something closer to that.

Looks like you have an XT90 charge port and an XT90 loopkey.  I would change that before you sell it to be honest.  Too risky for potential fires to the inattentive buyer.  @Andy87 can testify.  Other than that as I have said before, amazing build.  Good price too!

At the minimum, it needs [a fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) on the charge port to be safe enough to keep indoors.

You would be very surprised at what we are capable of blowing up no matter the experience.  Just trying to protect you my friend.  Good luck with the sale and future builds

I used a xt90 anti spark switch to charge and activate it.

Yes, no harm meant.  I've accidentally stuck a piece of metal in the charge port like an idiot just because I was in a hurry and wasn't thinking.  @Andy87 accidentally stuck a loop key in the charge port.  Do we know not to do that?  Yes, of course we do.  But humans make mistakes, plain and simple, and that's one of more than one reason I always recommend the fused charge port.  If you use an XT90 for your charge port then I ***STRONGLY*** recommend you fuse it.  Especially since fuses are dirt-cheap.

there's nothing wrong with it at all. the price is good, the board looks great. Thing is that people on this forum wants to build their own boards and people that ride retail boards just doesn't understand that most DIY boards outperforms their boosted/evolve boards in every aspect.
