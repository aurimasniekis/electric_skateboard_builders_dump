Could you please tell us the motor name Or share the Specification sheet?

also you could split everything because some people need a new remote some a motor @High-roller wants 5mm belts. Good luck with your sale!

and fit most pulleys I have used other belts of the same size on a trampa yes .

The motor is from scarmboards it is 300kv really fast and works well I have used it  before  €40 + shipping.

Sorry only 1 wheel pulley think 72t €15 will fit trampa
