I currently have the alien power system single motor drive kit + motor mount. Will include 4x alien wheels (will fit the drive pulleys) (only used for a week) the truck adapter is for Paris 180mm but you can buy different ones from their site (or cnc it yourself ) looking for about 100 for the whole thing. Will also sell the Paris 180mm trucks if you want.  Will send worldwide pm me for more details
