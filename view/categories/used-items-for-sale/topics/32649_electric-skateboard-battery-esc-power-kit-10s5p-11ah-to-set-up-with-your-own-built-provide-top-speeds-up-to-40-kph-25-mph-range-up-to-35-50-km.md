This looks like a more expensive version of the meepo board https://meepoboard.com/products/meepo-board-electric-skateboard, but without the deck, un-assembled. I guess all the components are from china, bought on alibaba.

If you say you are the manufacturers, how come i can find all the parts in your board on ebay for CHEAPER than you are selling them on your website. I could argue about the [quote="diyeboard, post:3, topic:32649"]

These packs are 50A discharge, correct me if I am wrong.

@diyeboard How does that BMS deal with regenerative charging/a VESC?

If you made your battery packs with Samsung 30Q cells with an adequate # of nickle strips and a 60-100A BMS you'd have many more intetested people on this forum imo. Nobody here that I know of recommends using 10amp ccr 2200 mAh 18650 cells for battery packs when 20A 3000mAh 18650 cell packs are available.

@diyeboard sorry for the push, but would love an answer on regen braking before I potentially eat dirt due to the BMS cutting out.

```
A regenerative brake is an energy recovery mechanism which slows the electric skateboard by converting its kinetic energy into a form which can be either used immediately or stored in the battery until needed.

and there's a tech bug for all regenerative braking system, that when battery is fully charged, the regenerative braking will be invoid thus the braking force is not obvious. the BMS handles all ampere and voltage balance in operating and charging, bms manages the regenerative braking with a smart convertion system in ampere draw and output, voltage cut off and max voltage protection.

Forgot about the holiday, sorry. Yes, I know what regenerative braking is.

Let me rephrase the question. What happens if you feed the BMS that is integrated into your Li-Ion pack with say 20A through the xt-60 plug. That's what will most likely happen if someone hooks up a Vesc and rides down a hill for a longer period of time. Does the BMS shut down, or will it keep functioning.

One of the reasons why many people are using a bestech bms

brakes always there if remote and battery pack has enough battery. in your said conditions, if longtime downhill riding the board, there's possibility the battery fully charged and regenerative braking will stop working, then brakes are going weak, but not too weak, you still can brake down the board.

Can you carry 6374 motors?  You have 6354 motors but with an odd 10mm motor shaft from RC cars. 10mm pulleys not as easy to come by.

http://www.diyeboard.com/180kv-n6354-outrunner-motor-2000w-for-diy-electric-skateboard-p-540.html

Instead bring motors like these at the $40-$50 range:

Use Alibaba trade assurance transaction---Pay by PayPal or credit card. Enjoy China prices without the markup. Prosper?

EDIT: Can anyone tell me why this post has been flagged? I did not say anything offensive or rude have I? Poster said he was nervous about purchase. I outlined their trade assurance purchase which protects the buyer and seller. I don't see the reason to flag this.

no you can't, they are of different firmwares and progrom in the esc, different algorism.
they are not compatible.
belt drive use belt verion esc, and hub drive use hub version esc. if use the same, there will be noises and motor spin problem. longtime riding can broken the motors and escs if wrongly use the different version esc.

@diyeboard Hi, is it possible to change voltage for this dual layer esc (the one who comes with 10s5p battery??

Or is it 10s only? Havent seen any instructions or tutorials whenever it is possible..

Would be great if 6s was also possible
