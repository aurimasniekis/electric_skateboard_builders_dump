Hi,
It's been a good while since I used these forums but I was pretty active some years ago. Life happened etc.
If you need references you can just search my username.
Anyways, I'm moving and I'm parting out with all my esk8-parts. Most of them are never used, like the Trampa VESC.

**Motor:** Maytech sensored 170kv 6355 sealed, never used but have some minor marks from storage.

**ESC:** Trampa Vesc6, never used.

**Mini remote and receiver**, just used for testing on bench.

**Pulleys and belts,** only used on bench. NOTE: I can't find the keyway for the pulleys so they are missing.

**Metr.at BT-module**, used.

**Anti-spark board**, used.

I will also throw in some good-to-have stuff which contains latching switches, silicon wires, XT60 and XT90-connectors, shrink tube, bullet connectors and other stuff.

Price â‚¬280 + shipping from sweden for everyhting. **Will not part out.**

Interested. Can you reserve it for a few hours?

Also is that a legacy metr module or metr pro?

Sure, but not forever :slight_smile:
Yes, it's the first version of metr.at. I actually found a 4.12 ESC too that's broken but I'll throw it in for free.

I need this gone because I'm moving and I need both place and funds for new furniture.

Therefore shipping is on me within US and EU.
