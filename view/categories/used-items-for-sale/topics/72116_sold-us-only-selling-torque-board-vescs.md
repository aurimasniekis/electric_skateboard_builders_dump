Hey everyone.  I have a set of 2 torque board vesc that I would like to sell. 
They have been used for about 150 miles without a single issue! 
5.5mm connectors 
They’re in perfect working order.  Only reason for selling is that I’ve parted out the board I had them on and no longer have use for them 
They were purchased just a couple of months ago directly from torque boards 

Asking $100 for the set. 

Will post some pics soon

SALE PENDING
