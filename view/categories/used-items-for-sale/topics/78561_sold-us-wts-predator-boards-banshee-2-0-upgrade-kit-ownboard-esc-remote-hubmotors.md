Just to clarify, is there anything missing from this kit other than a front truck setup, battery, and deck? If so, dibs.

Correct. It's everything that was offered in the original group buy. The only difference is in the connectors, only being that there are no waterproof glands like those offered in the GB.

I'll send you the matching front truck with green bushings and clone wheels for free, bud.  I have no use for them, seriously (gone Trampa) :)![IMG_0619|666x500](upload://nkl8a6aNtLCkOASRPqNnbotT9h4.jpeg)

Any idea of mileage? This seems a steal. I'm enjoying my set. Love the remote.

Honestly, I didn't ride these much at all. I seem to be happier in the process of building because I'm constantly changing my mind and the boards end up in surgery more often than not lol. I would hazard to guess no more than 10-20 miles - that might be hard to believe, but I only took it for test rides in my neighborhood. The urethane is fairly clean, absolutely no cuts or chunks, etc.

And @topcloud can attest to the quality with which I promise to pack these up, lots 'o bubbly wrap :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

That's dope, I went back to CarvON hubs because I'm an addict, but I'm glad these won't waste away in my closet and @venom121212 can take advantage of them. The urethane is holding up well?

Almost zero chunking. I ran over some glass on a rough road in Hawaii but other than that they are great.
