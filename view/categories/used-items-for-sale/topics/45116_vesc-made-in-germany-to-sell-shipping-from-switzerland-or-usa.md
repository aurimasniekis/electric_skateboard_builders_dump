Vesc, bought on esk8.de to sell. It is fully funtional, never had any problems. Has around 50miles on it. The plug for the sensored motor has cables glued to it, since I didn't have the plug. Either you can take it off or solder the sensor cable to it.  Also heatsink is attached to it.

Make me offers. Can be shippid within a day from the states. (In 3 weeks from switzerland)

Reson for selling: Dual setup with focbox.
