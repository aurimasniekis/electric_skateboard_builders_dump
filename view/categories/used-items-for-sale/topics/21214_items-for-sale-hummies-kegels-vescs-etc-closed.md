2x Hummie hub motor - wires reinforced - 190€ (total)
bought from monkey32 (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/european-parts-new-and-used/8789)
They're currently mounted on Avenue Suspension Trucks but can be easily removed. The Trucks would add another 70€ (Shipping from the US was expensive and import-tax wasn't cheap either)

2x v4.12 VESCs from DIY Electric Skateboard - 200€ (total) - sold
bought from WARMAN
They had the faulty 2.18 Firmware, so the DRVs fried. B4Me was kind enough to replace them and also upgrade some other Components to the chaka standard. They're both tested and working and are running the patched 2.18FW. Currently they're connected via canbus and are hooked-up to a bluetooth module via UART. Please note that the battery-connectors are cut off. 

2x Orangatang Kegels dyed black, including ABEC-9 Bearings - 40€ (total)
Diameter: 80mm 
Contact Patch: 56mm
Durometer: 83a
dyed using "Rit Dye Powder-Black"

4x Flureon 3S 11.1V 90C 2200mAh - 50€ (total)
They're compact (43x95x18mm each) and claimed to be able to output almost 200Amps each. One of them is reshrinked in black PVC and they're currently stetup as two 3S2P Packs. The Smart Guard 2 is also included
