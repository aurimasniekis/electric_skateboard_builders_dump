You got great parts. I always feel bad when I see someone throw the towel at the very end just before wining by knock-out

Thanks dude. Yeah I didn't anticipate it taking 12 months just to mount the motors...:rofl::disappointed_relieved:

So, now that you have them at last you are throwing everything overboard?

Tell us the real story

The real story is that it's taken 12 months to mount the motors. After my Dad died in 2017 I basically had to take on a lot. Then I decided to quit my job and start ESK8 Stickers UK (launching soon) and everything in between (life) has slowed the project to a halt. I also rode the new Evolve GTRs this week so I would like to redirect funds for a Bamboo AT. And I've finally realised that I value being able to just ride and chill with friends more than brainstorming how the hell I'm doing to mount a Focbox to a piece of sheet metal with the correct sized screw, for example. So, as much as I respect the DIY community (as I know how much effort each board demands) it's just not for me at the moment. I love a technical challenge but I just don't have the time for this project.

Maybe you could send everything to some well respected builder in the UK, and they can assemble / finish everything for you, and send the board back?

You can ship batteries all over Europe with GLS, they are an extension of Schenker

Nice idea, but I'm more interested in potentially owning and riding a GTR.

A GTR and the beauty you can make with those parts is not the same...

I consider the GTR a step forward for Evolve. The Bamboo deck is great (nicer than the Vanguard in my opinion). It's simply my choice. While the peak power isn't as much as the UNiK motors, for me ESK8 is all about having a diverse board (AT/Street) and the Evolve will tick a lot of boxes for me. Also remember I have a Raptor 2.1... :smiling_imp:

What's the difference between the 10s and 12s versions of the eboosted enclosure?

## \#17 Posted by: mrjonnyjones Posted at: 2019-06-15T11:53:37.952Z Reads: 110

The 12S enclosures are simply a bit bigger to take 8 more cells. The enclosures I have for sale are for 10S only, so 10S4P (larger battery enclosure with more depth) and 10S2P (shallower battery enclosure).

Hope this helps :-)

Sorry for the bump, I just wanted to say thanks very much to those that have purchased parts from me so far! It's massively appreciated and the funds are now going to be diverted straight back into ESK8 Stickers UK to make a better website for you guys when it launches after the Paris ESK8 Cup!

I still have a METR Pro - brand new, never used, the link is above in the original post, as well as an @Eboosted enclosure set for a Vanguard, two helmets and some other bits.

Have a good weekend guys/gals! :D  :sunny: ⚡️
