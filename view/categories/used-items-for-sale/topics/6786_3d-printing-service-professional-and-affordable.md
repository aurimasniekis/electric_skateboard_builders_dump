I currently have both a white PLA filament, and a wood filament; but I can order any filament a client desires

I generally charge depending on the complexity, and size of the piece. For a fan vent cover, I've charged 10$ in the past, and for a motor mount, I've charged 40$ to give you some idea.

I can vouch for @cj1556, very cool dude, great prices and pretty decent quality prints. 

I have a flash forge creator pro now so I won't be needing his service anymore but he saved my ass in the past
