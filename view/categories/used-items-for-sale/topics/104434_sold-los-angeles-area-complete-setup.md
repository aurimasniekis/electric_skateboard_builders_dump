selling as complete setup. 
Parts: 

Hi5ber limelite deck

42v 1.5a charger. 
torqueboards 12s4p battery enclosure

The only thing not included is a remote and receiver and a Power switch. I have a remote and receiver for the board so that you could test it. Im using it for my other board so youâ€™re gonna have to just use yours or buy one.

Yeah. I bought it from you. And btw itâ€™s $450 because one of the motors isnt working well right? And there are no hall sensors wires because you cut it for some reason. And also this doesnt come with the belt drive you sold. This has the elofty direct drives

Seems a bit steep for the condition of the board, motors, battery, etc. just my opinion though.  You can buy a new board for about that same price.
