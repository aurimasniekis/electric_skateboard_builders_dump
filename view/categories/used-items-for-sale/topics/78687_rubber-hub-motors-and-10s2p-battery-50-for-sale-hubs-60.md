Yes, possibly. I havenâ€™t heard of starkboards. Couldnâ€™t find any wheel specs on their site. 

What size are the wheels? What kind of material?

No it cant be mh1, that would be 4.4ah. Also i highly doubt the range stats he has on there. Nomal ruding will struggle to get 5 miles out of poor cell lg packs

Nah they are fine for small cruiser boards, but they can only handle a max of 20a so for high power boards they are not powerful enough
