I’ve been  wondering why there have been more reports of charging fires...

You should really really really take some time and clean that wiring up. That’s some dangerous cable management there. At this point, not a lot of people are going to want something like this. If you clean it up and make it safe and secure, you would have a much better chance of selling it
