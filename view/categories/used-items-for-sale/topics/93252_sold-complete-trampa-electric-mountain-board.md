he doesnt say what rims he is riding but the board build he is talking about would cost 3500ish all new parts without bat i almost have this build myself but its really less then 3500 because the trampa drives u buy could be resold on here what i did.so around 3k new parts without bat.its hard to give a good recommendation price range without pix.![20190226_151806|374x500](upload://kHiXKAinw3m4RIixMOMDo8oCXLz.jpeg)
