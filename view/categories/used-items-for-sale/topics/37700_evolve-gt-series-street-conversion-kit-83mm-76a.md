Hey guys,

I have for sale a used Evolve GT Street conversion kit for $110 shipped.
They are very lightly used, only took it out for a test ride before I switched over to the 107s.
I am selling them to fund for my next build and also for those who what a set of spare wheels at an affordable price.

Please note that both belt covers are missing as well as the bearings, spacers, etc. 
This is reflected in the reduced price.

If interested, please PM me. 
Thanks
