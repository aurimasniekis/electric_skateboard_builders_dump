Selling my Boosted clone deck because I've changed my mind and I'm going for a Jet Potato. It's in the used category, but it hasn't been outside. Just some small pushes in the house and I removed the grip tape (still some sticky residue on the deck but can easily be removed/cleaned, see picture)

Board is from taobao.

Right now it's in The Netherlands.

Shipping in Europe should be possible for around 15 euro.
