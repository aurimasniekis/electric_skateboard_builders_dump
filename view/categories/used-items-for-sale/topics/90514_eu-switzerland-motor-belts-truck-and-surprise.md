Hello everyone, I'm selling some bits of things I've got and have no use for
I can ship in Switzerland and Europe, I'll be in France in a week so you better hurry if you want those cheap shipping price (or you'll have to wait till I come back :wink: )

APS motor sensorless 230kv 2400W
The motor is a little ugly on the outside (like most of you, so what's the big deal), but it's just the paint that scrapped a little, the inside rolls without a problem
The motor must have done 200km not more

79€ new, selling for 40€ 

One APS caliber 2 style truck (180mm, you know it)
The clamp damaged the paint

23€ new, selling for 15€

1 belt 15mm wide and 265mm long new

4€

4 belts 15mm wide and 395mm long (can't sell together or not) new
![IMG_20190414_201322|666x500](upload://6M4v6fmIc8j6jxHP7cLDptZRqWS.jpeg) 
5€ each


And finally the unusual stuff, a pair of freebord (first generation) center wheels
They have another hole drilled, so 3 fixing points, so it won't move no matter the hard time you put them into
Come with an almost new set of wheels and another set new

Suggest a price if interested

That's it, see you on the road !
