Hello

I am selling a set of motor mounts for Trampa Vertigo/Ultimate AT Trucks. This is an advanced prototype, fully functional, except for the belt tensioner as it was not properly located. 

It's a perfect fit for the trucks
The mount is very sturdy and it works perfectly with a 450mm belt, you can adjust the tension of the belt by moving the motor up. 
I am asking 110 USD

Included:

Motor mount set for Trampa Vertigo Trucks (you will just need 8xM4 40mm screws) + Belt/Motor protection (the belt protections were a draft and printed in lower quality and the right side is missing a few materials on one side but itâ€™s barely noticeable and there is no impact on the motor mount integrity)

I can include 2 HTD 5 450mm belts for 20 USD
