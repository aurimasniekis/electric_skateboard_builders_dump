Your parts from torqueboards costs $426.99 already, excluding your board, connectors, UBEC, enclosure, batteries, and I'm assuming the charger? 

I would aim for $500+ if I were you. I'm a bit salty because I ordered the same stuff from torqueboards for a 6s set-up two days ago lol. I would have gladly bought everything here! Good luck!
