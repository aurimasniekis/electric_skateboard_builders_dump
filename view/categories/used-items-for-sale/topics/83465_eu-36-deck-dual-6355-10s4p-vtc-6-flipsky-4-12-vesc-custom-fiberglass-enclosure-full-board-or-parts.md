Yo guys!
Selling this build to make room for a new one :slight_smile:

Going to give it a week trying to sell it as a whole if not I'll part it out and sell most parts individually.

The build is an absolute monster, I've done a ride of over 40km on it. Never reached top speed as max I dared to ride was 48kmh but it still had some power left in it.:sweat_smile:

Specs:
*36" Deck from Amazon. 
*Dual 6355, identical to FlipSky but unbranded.
*10s4p Sony VTC6 12A battery, I never ever noticed any sag but I am very carefull and never discharge further then 3.2V.
*FlipSky 4.12 VESC, I got a good deal on these but they haven't dissapointed me as of yet.
I also added a bluethooth module so it works with @Ackmaniac firmware and app. 
*Custom Fiberglass enclosure that I made with the help of a friend. Feels extremely strudy.
(Only thing missing is an anti-spark switch, using a simple loopkey atm)

I include everything from remote to charger as soon on pictures.

Asking price for full setup: â‚¬699 + shipping(From Belgium)
