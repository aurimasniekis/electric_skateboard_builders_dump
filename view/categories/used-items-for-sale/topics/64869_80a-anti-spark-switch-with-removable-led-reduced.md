Hi,
Im selling this almost new 80A anti-spark switch with removable LED for easy fitting to your enclosure. I bought it from eSkate.eu in Italy. After postage and 'extras' (Led push button, Xt90 connectors, 80A fuse) it cost me an arm and a leg... 73Euro.

Im selling it for £35 and delivery in UK will be £2.50 on top of that. Thats a saving of about £30 sterling![IMG_2030|666x500](upload://xVGsFRhDEdg42gDBxvRrv2ONul.jpg)![IMG_2029|666x500](upload://wtN1fc4fLxRNzcNmLShIkLtvjmz.jpg)![50|606x500](upload://nPMGLTeGSYkUYeaJbHyj7DGCD9x.png)

Would you be willing to shop to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada? I'd pay for the shipping cost as well.
