Hey everyone.  I‚Äôm considering parting with yet another raptor 2.   This time I‚Äôd like to sell The drivetrain before anything else 

Board has a total of 26 miles on it and everything works perfectly fine 
Kit includes enertion latest version of motors (silver), both trucks (rear one with extended axles) and 90mm wheels  
I want $500 in my pocket for the complete drivetrain 

Let me know if there is anyone interested in it. 

Thanks

That‚Äôs a good question.   To tell you the truth.  I don‚Äôt know.  Imagine 10s will bring them up to 30-32mph ‚Äúdepends on urethane size‚Äù I can imagine 12s will probably be around 34-35mph   Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong

Cuz we have each other‚Äôs backüòÇ.   Nah.  It‚Äôs easier, safer, convenient and cheaper to ship within the country.  That‚Äôs all

Those motors are super super heavy might cost too much to ship. 

I have an extra R2 motor and when I toss it on my tempurpedic bed it just sinks in lol

Reason they‚Äôre so heavy is cuz belts, motor mount plates/clamps, motor/wheel pulleys have all been squeezed inside the motor haha
