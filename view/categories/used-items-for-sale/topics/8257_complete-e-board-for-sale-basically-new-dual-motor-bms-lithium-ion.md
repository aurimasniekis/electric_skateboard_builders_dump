I've decided to sell my board. Had some expenses come up recently that need to be paid. If the board doesn't sell in a week I will begin to part it out. I've put about 30 miles on the board now with zero issues. Whoever buys will unbox and ride. It needs nothing since I upgraded to the 120A 12S TB ESCs. 

I have compiled a list of basically everything I have spent on this build. All of these prices are exactly how much I spent on everything. I checked all of my statements to verify. I’m sure I have forgotten some things. EVERYTHING that is listed here is included in the sale. I’ve spent countless hours on this build and ideally I’d like to make a profit but instead I will be losing about $500 as well as my labor for the build.

My computer died and I need a new one for engineering school. Can't tack on that cost and keep this. Plus I really just enjoy building them. Riding them not so much lol.

I would be interested in a lot of your board but you're pricing it at brand new (which it is, i understand) but mos tof us would rather just buy direct from the dealer at the same price

Sorry maybe I wasn't very clear. I am not parting out. I'm selling as a whole. Those aren't prices I am asking for parts in just showing what I paid. I've discounted it

It means that the GT2B comes in addition to the winning remote. Also the 60A BMS will come with the board even though it already has a 45A BMS.
