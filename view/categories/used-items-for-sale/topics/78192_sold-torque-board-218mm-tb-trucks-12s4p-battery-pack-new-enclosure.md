Up for grabs 
Some of my torque board stuff I no longer need 
First 
12s4p Samsung 30q battery pack with built in bms and on/off switch as well as porcentaje display, used for a total of 250 miles 
I will also include a brand new torque board battery enclosure.  This is the updated version with cutouts instead of holes for vesc leads (it also has more room) and Velcro straps to secure battery pack.  
$275 for battery pack and enclosure 

Torque board 218mm trucks.   Installed but never used $50
