I have an fvt 120a 6s esc with an led power button, voltmeter, loopkey, and xt60 connector mounted on a g10 plate. 

I used it on a previous build with the Tacon 160 motor and 5200mah 3s Lipos (connected in series) shown below, and it was rock solid. I'll also throw in the cable to connect these 2 lipos in series.

The motor spins and runs fine, but I think it has a cracked magnet (I don't remember exactly).

$95 shipped (in the USA) takes it all.
