Hello,

My name is Marcello, I live in Lausanne, Switzerland and I recently finished building my first and last E-board with dual 2400w of power although after buying all the pieces and building it i realized i dont have what it takes to build a electric skateboard, I get frustrated to quick and im not by any means an engineer or anything similar. 
although I bought very good pieces for building it and i've only used it a couple of times only. I would like to know if you would be interested on buying the E-BOARD OR ITS PIECES, everything its functional and its only been used for a couple of weeks:

-Arbor deck
-caliber II truck 
-Enertion narrow Truck
-Enertion Space Cell 3 battery(It has only been charged twice)
-1200w 5055 Torque motors X 2
-Enertion Dual Vesc 
-Enertion Dual Drive System 15mm X 2
-Alien Power System Remote Controler

Let me know if you are interested so we could discuss prices. I attach you a picture of the board.

Looks like you already took it out for a ride or two. Looking good also! So what problems are you facing with it?

True! I did use the board without all the electric stuff for a couple of weeks while I was waiting for all the rest of the stuff to arrive. And there's no problem with the board, its working just fine, it was a nice project with lots of fun, work, frustrations and waiting. Now I need the money for a new project completely different (buying a drone) and i haven't been using it as much as i thought so... why not.

Im thinking something around 800usd would be a fair price. let me know what you think, Im willing to negotiate.

PD. I'll fix all those little scratches on the trucks and mounts before sending it.

Hallo Marcello, I really got some interest. Maybe we can talk through private message to talk about the price etc?

Thanks
