Hello, I have a complete board with mostly Enertion parts. I haven't decided on a price. I can probably part it out (maybe). So just send me your best offers. Thanks!


I've had this board (or parts of it) around late 2016. Finished the build early 2017 and only used it on weekends during summer. So it's not a commuter board. 

Here's a list of all the parts:

- **Enertion Space Cell Pro 3 battery 10s3p + tough  case, bms, 40amp fuse**
- **Enertion FOCBOX vesc**
- **Enertion R-SPEC motor** (6355 motor?)
- **Enertion motor mount, pulleys**
- **Enertion truck**
- **Globe The Maiden deck**
- **Avenue Trucks longboard suspension truck** (front only)
- **Winning remote**
- **blank 83mm wheels, Bones bearings**
- **skid plate, kick tail attachment**
