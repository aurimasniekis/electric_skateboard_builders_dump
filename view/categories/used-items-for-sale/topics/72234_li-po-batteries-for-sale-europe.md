Hi, I'm selling some batteries and a 6s bms.

I have two of these 3s 5000mah Turnigy packs that can give 100 amps (They are 20C)

The cells are balances and the battery is in a good condition but without the blue wrap because it got very dirty so I removed it

Price: 30usd for both packs + shipping

I also have 4 single 5000mah cels, the same ones used in this pack but the tab broke on one of them

Price: 5 per cell, idk what about the one with a broken tab, myb it could get fixed somehow.

The bms: 6S5W001
