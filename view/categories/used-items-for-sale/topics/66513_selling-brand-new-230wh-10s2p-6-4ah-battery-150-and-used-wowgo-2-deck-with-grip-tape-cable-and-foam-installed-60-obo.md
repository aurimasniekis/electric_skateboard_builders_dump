I'm selling a 230Wh 10s2p 6.4Ah battery, brand new and in the box, unopened, never used etc (value $190). A friend of mine bought it for me, but I know I want to build my own one/ buy a bigger one. I'm from Philadelphia and asking 150$ + shipping or best offer, prefferably to not rip me off. It was barely shipped a couple of days ago. Obviously can't have him cancel the order :frowning: 

As for the deck, brand new it would cost 95(deck, cable, grip) + 8 (foam) = $103. I am asking $60 + shipping obo. It also has 2 new holes that allow you to use a small kicktail for sharp turns. still no wheel bite, even with softer bushings, However, I do recommend tightening it a bit more in the back if you're going to install the trucks in the kicktail specific holes. Has a couple of scratches and the tail and nose are scuffed a bit more, grip tape has a small rip in it because I checked the water sealings (still sealed, water can only enter through the enclosures you put).

Will post pictures tomorrow because the deck is in the locker.

You posted this as a wanted item instead of for sale...
Currently Skullboard  has the same battery using Samsung 30q for $130

Thanks, changed it. Also thanks for the battery info, will look into that. 

However, I can't really thank you 100% since you made me lose all possible buyers of that battery :frowning:

I guess whoever already has the 6.4Ah and wants to put it in parallel to this will still want it.

Grip is ugly and ripped on the edges. Easily solvable. I will sand the nose and tail so they look better. Can't say the pictures are very good cause I had to take them with my selfie camera (main camera is broken). Lmk if you need more pics

Looked at skullboard again and they're selling it for $189. Any idea where to look for well priced already built Samsung 30q batteries?
Btw, opened the box after all![received_245054222825756|375x500](upload://1QaPtbgfJH1pdeZTLxllIKwUFPp.jpeg) ![received_1136620346488785|375x500](upload://vWXMEEpHAH3Pe2wG6hFH6Q5UM5Q.jpeg)

4.0Ah is same size as 6.0Ah pack from 30Q or any other chinese 10s2p battery. I have 2 older 4.0Ah packs if you really need photo
