I am trying to sell my e-board to be able to fund my next build. The VESC, hub-motor kit, and transmitter and controller were bought from Carvon. The hub motor is the v2 and with a 12s battery pack it'll let you cruise at 30mph. I am selling everything together with a deck and charger and two 6s 2650mAh lipos for $500 obo.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0e76a0af72287b267e9eea75cacc0dc0af541a6e.JPG" width="666" height="500">
