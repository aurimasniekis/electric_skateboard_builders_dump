This is a TKP hub hanger you're looking for, interesting since I have only seen rkp. 

Where did you get these hub motors + truck originally? I've been interested in a tkp hub motor for a  while.

Tbh, anybody above the age of 25 seriously trying to rag on somebody under 17-18 is kinda petty and stupid. 

I'm not exactly trying to say that people at those ages are dumb either. The only thing that's really changed about me since I was 12 is that I know a lot of fucking math and have been almost mugged a few times. Somehow I'm managing to get dank ass internship offers still being a 12 year old inside.

Anyways - no reason to start a shit show on the forum. Play nice
