So I am trying to buy the parts for the mechanical build for my Esk8. I already bought the aluminum and the exertion pulleys so all I need is the motor.

The point of this topic is to raise awareness for the problem of Esk8 motor availability. My main choices are the Turnigy SK3 245kv or the SK3 213kv from hobbyking. I know there are DIYES, Ollin's and Enertion's but I don't want a sensored motor and the shipping and cost from Enertion is simply too high as well is 190kv is a little low for me. The SK3 213kv came in to stock yesterday night and I planned to buy it today but it went out of stock a few hours ago. 

I have also looked at the Tacon Big Foot 160 245kv as a motor since it has been used in Esk8 before. 

http://www.hobbypartz.com/96m608-bigfoot160-5335-245kv.html However, it is also unavailable. 

The other motor I see is the Turing G160 245kv out runner from hobbyking.
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__14408__Turnigy_G160_Brushless_Outrunner_245kv_160_Glow_.html

 It looks very similar to the Tacon but I haven't seen this particular motor used on Esk8 yet. My question is will this motor work.

Also if you have any other available motor suggestions with a kv rating between 220ih and 250 that will work for 8s and has a shaft diameter of 8mm then I would be happy to see them. Thanks!

the g160 should work fine, pretty sure I've seen some using it.

I just got the smaller one of these.. https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/

190kv will keep you around 20-24mph which is really the sweet spot to balance torque/speed....
you can always just not plug in the sensors but if you have a vesc(hope you do) dont see why not....

Just worried that the G-160 is a little small and the watts are a little low compared to the SK3 and the Tacon. If you think it will work then I trust you!. Would go for Ollin board 200kv if it wasn't $90 but we'll see

Hmm. Done some more research and https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/
seems like a good motor for the price. Looks just like Ollin boards but cheaper. Thoughts?

Might be biased but it is very very similar to DIYs. You will not regret buying it ;)

You can very easily turn a sensored motor into a non-sensored. I'm using DIY/@torqueboards unsensored at the moment (i've tried both, but debating about using the sensor port for other things, so I'm trying unsensored) and it's fantastic!

Sweet! I feel confident in my motor choice!

Hey @Smorto thanks for supporting Polar! 

 On your comment about the motor being cheap. They are by no means of poor quality. There are very similar to DIY, and are bigger than Ollin Boards.  I'm sure it will work just fine for you! Let me know if you have any other questions!

Thanks for the response. Just a few questions, I think it will but will it work well with Ollin VESC? Also does it come with bolts for a motor mount or do I have to just pick some up from my local hardware store?

It will work great with Ollin vescs! I will throw some M4 bolts in the shipment for you, although they may not be the right length to fit your specific mount.

Oh, just thought of one more thing. Will the shipment have a tracking number and if so can you pm it to me?

I am running @JLabs 6374 in dual diag with an enertion r-spec big boy 6374 and works great. Also ran @JLabs 6354 before and happy with both.

Yes it will. I will enter it on the market, and it will be accessible to you through there. The next shipment is in 1.5 weeks.

Thanks for the kind words @caustin!

So it will ship in 1.5 weeks? When I ordered it it said 1 left in stock so I am just wondering what delivery times may look like.

Yes, delivery is 2 weeks to you. Sorry for the wait, the manufacturing is held back due to the holiday. I will get it to you asap.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

No problem, it will work with the enertion 12mm motor pulley right?

Yes, @cmatson put a 12mm pulley on it!

Thanks for understanding!

Yep, you can use an Enertion 12mm pulley. 

Just beware they don't have set screws, so you will have to keep the pulley from moving forward and backwards with red locktight. The keyway on the motor shaft will keep the pulley from spinning on the shaft, which is the important part!

How would I go about locking it on the shaft, on this particular shaft their is a cut out

https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/

So wouldn't that keep it from going down?

EDIT: Would 8mm circlips on each of the cutouts work like on enertion shafts?

## \#26 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2016-10-16T23:01:20.838Z Reads: 106

```
The Enertion motors have a little slot on each end of the shaft for the circlips. You could dremel your own slots and use those circlips, but otherwise they would likely just slide off. 

The locktight will easily hold it though... as it is the pulley is a tight fit on the shaft, so a little thread locker just makes super it won't move

Will blue loctite work (blue liquid not the bottle)? Also, the motor in the picture does have 2 cutouts that look like they would work for circlips.
```

## \#28 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2016-10-17T12:09:12.751Z Reads: 96

```
Ah, true. It does have circlips! 

Make sure the distance between them is 12mm, and if so, then you are good to go with just two circlips on the pulley! 

Otherwise, the blue locktight is fine

Hmmm I am not sure how long the shaft is. Maybe @JLabs can help. Maybe the enertion pulley will fit the shaft with the circles on either side?

True, and if there is a little extra space, you can always add a speed washer
