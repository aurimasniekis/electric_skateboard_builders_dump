Hey everyone.
I’ve been trying to fix a problem that have caused me several broken motor pulleys.
For some reason when the wheel spin forward, the belt moves to the the side of the pulley which causes it to rub on it and break the pulley<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/4/94233896638a47c130760f17317d719416ba8806.jpg" width="375" height="500">
When the wheel spins backwards the belt aligns properly in the middle of the pulley<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/6/d6b53ae1f441debfda1b7e60c5104f0339861ea8.jpg" width="375" height="500">
How can I fix it guys it destroys all of my pulleys.
Please help

Probably the motor mount is not perfectly aligned to the wheel pulley. Need to adjust that until belt stays in place when spinning wheel both forward and backwards.

Smaller imperfections probably affect belt more if it is over tightened as well.

Adjust your motor mount it's a no brainier it's going to go the other way  it's physics. Play with the alignment of your motor mount bring it closer. I had to fiddle with mine for a good 30 mins it's really close but it fixed my problem.

Got that same problem, i adjust the mounts, ifbthe belt tends outward, i adjust the mounts opposite to balance, spin the wheels forward backward and check if the belt is align, if not, adjust accordingly. It's a trial and error, hope this could help.

Adjust how? How would it help if a move the mount a little closer? The problem disappears when I move it backwards and it is still the same mount position

The issue is quite visible here.. in the lower part of the photo the belt is closer to the mount. How do I fix this? Sorry for the ignorance

we understand your problem...

your motor mount is probably not at a perfect 90 degree angle to the pulley, causing the belt to move.  if your wheel wasnt in the way, it would come completely off the pulley when you spin it backwards too.

No offense, but you posted what seems to be the exact same issue a few months ago and got plenty response and help.

Why creating a new post getting the same replies? Go back to the older thread and you'll find the answers there.

Why is that screw so loose? Looks like pushing the belt.
Play around with the belt tension moving the motor forth and back and align the belt in perfect line on both pulleys. 
Also check the wheel pulley screws. If they are not right the belt will move left and right. 
It is a paín in the ass but it must be done right.

@rojitor mentioned the same issue I was thinking... I'm affraid your belt is rubbing against this protruding screw head :point_down:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7d980781e08e28fa193bd55ea05cfebff57496d3.jpg" width="690" height="500">

....and is the probable culprit for breaking the belts. It wont allow the belt to normally slip sideways thru  the motor pulley's width play. See how the motor pulley has two flanges? They constrain the belt's normal travel, side by side, but in this case the belt never got the chance to travel all the way to the right flange because the screw head interfere midway before It completes the side travel.

This is causing the breaking belts.... I think..

Guys thank you so much for the advice and help!
This miss alignment has caused SO much frustration and anger.
There are so many little things that can destroy the board but when you FINALLY fix all of them it’s incredible.
