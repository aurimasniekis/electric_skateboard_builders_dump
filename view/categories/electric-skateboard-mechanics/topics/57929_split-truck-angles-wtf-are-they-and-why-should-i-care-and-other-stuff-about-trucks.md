The lesson I wish to teach here is that you can setup your trucks in a way that increases stability (reduce the chance of wobbles to zero!) and also increases agility, all at the same time! You can make tighter turns and curves at higher speeds and sharper angles, all while reducing the chance of wobbles to zero and increasing your confidence, safety and ability no matter what you are doing or where you are riding. Who wouldn't want to have some cake and eat it too? Interested?


Split angles are just another name for having two different truck angles, it could be in any configuration but I thought I’d break down the most common uses and setups that I have found work for me with electrics.

Split angles can be achieved many ways, the Evo deck is a fine example of angles built into the deck itself. Different trucks, baseplates, wedges and decks, all contribute to the truck angle and change it. The term "split angles" could mean almost any configuration and that fact means it could contribute to a setup that’s completely impossible to ride if you don't know what your doing. That’s why it’s important to understand split angles if you are going to seek the benefits of using them.


![landyachtz-evo-side-view|400x88](upload://1rQVkZR32nDqNEMaksJDDCwOAkx.jpg)


When we say, “truck angles” we are specifically talking about the angle of the truck pivot in relation to the deck (it’s leverage). Measure all truck angles by the pivot itself, not the kingpin (common mistake). All trucks, be them TKP or RKP or even things like Moe’s 3-link trucks, all have an angle, even if it’s zero.


![randalangles|386x199](upload://5r4WHEUPvj5ceZQVeAmqmSjHYKJ.jpg)


I discovered split angles myself when I bought a Carver skateboard, they are more of a “surfskate” than a skateboard and are designed to pump in a surfing style to propel them forward. I used one of these to commute to work for a year once, it’s a great workout, but I wanted more speed and efficiency. Carvers are designed for fast acceleration with a low top speed and I was always sweaty coming into the office, lol. 


Carvers have a unique truck setup, with a TKP (traditional kingpin) rear truck with rake like an old Tracker RTS (pumping slalom rear truck), while the Carver front trucks are super weird special designs. The CX is a RKP (reverse kingpin) with crazy amounts of rake and it really does work, it feels like surfing and everyone should get a chance to try one of these. The ability of these boards comes from the extreme split angles and rake of the trucks.

![1221000080_15734|357x500](upload://jeTIRyc7AYwHY5LjfvTJZCZgsb1.jpg)

The physics of pumping is debatable and it’s not important for electrics unless you wish to charge while riding and get a workout. All you really need to know is that split angles make pumping more efficient, just like a flexible deck and well-tuned bushings. Split angles have been used in skateboards for decades to significant effect.

I soon discovered something called LDP or Long Distance Pumping. And this is what the ultra skaters do to break those 24-hour endurance records, I believe they are above 300 miles within 24 hours now (unpowered). This was obviously the more efficient way for me to get to work without sweating as much. These take what is learned from old slalom setups and surf skates like Carvers to create the ultimate pumping machine. The Subsonic Pulse and Skate Kings Blaster are notable examples of a long slalom board to facilitate a longer wheelbase and pumping trucks under a flexible deck with tons of leverage. They are not meant to be stable or for high speed but for a giant longboard they can turn on a dime (put a pin in that thought).


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0HnjTBYd94


Then came the Gbomb bracket setups which allowed you to pump a lowered deck, combining pushing and pumping efficiency into one setup made to go far. The newest Gbomb model, the Black Panther, comes with a zero-degree rear torsion tail truck, it’s lightweight and totally unique. It can be paired with a Bennett Vector, Bhanger or Poppy front truck which all turn like mad with tons of rake. This is the most extreme example of split angles you will find and it works beautifully.


Rear truck at zero degrees, front truck at 65 degrees (0/65)

Ok now that you have some examples of extreme split angles here is some more practical use for us electric builders. Because that’s why we are here, right?


Downhill riders discovered split angles a long time ago and they use them to reduce speed wobbles. While a LDP rider will take the front angle to 65 degrees and the rear to zero, a downhill setup will be more moderate, angles in the 20-45 area and gently tuned for how fast they are going. These days downhill setups have trended toward very narrow truck widths to gain traction in the corners, and with such narrow and fast turning hangers, the angles have been going down, along with the wheelbase to keep the turn radius the same while having more stability. A giant longboard simply isn’t a necessity anymore to gain stability for high speeds, we now have very low angle trucks which do the same thing on much shorter decks.


This downhill setup features 47/23 split angles
![66874_1015571881814972_3713838787384362478_n|690x460](upload://oqYBU4p7ed7vZQY8cTpJc5MSc30.jpg)


The best truck solutions for electric longboards I have found, that are readily available, are the Calibers and TB218 (Torque Board 218mm). Both use the same baseplate geometry and you can interchange them, even with Randal and other brands as well. This means you can tune your truck angles without having to use wedges or bent decks, and you can find upgrades to make them work much better.


Caliber II trucks work the best with Riptide pivot upgrade in WFB  96a, use an ice pick and pliers to take out the old one and put in these, you will thank me. Same thing on the TB218 and Randal baseplates.
http://www.riptidesports.com/wfb-96a-pivot-cup-choices/


Caliber II’s take Riptide barrel bushings, because the truck is only 180mm wide the leverage isn’t high when compared to the TB218. Riptide Krankz work perfectly for beginners in this application and are very forgiving. Sometimes I prefer APS for a more precise rebound which I use for long range riding and even WFB for a squishy dead feeling if I’m going to do some speeding. Use the chart on his website to find the right ones for your weight.


Torque board 218mm trucks are wide and have a ton of leverage, they also have a wider bushing seat, lending better to the Riptide Cannon bushings on the road-side. I really like the Fat Cone bushings on the board-side of TB218 trucks, but I weight 200lb’s, lightweight guys may get away with Cannons on the board-side, who knows. Try it and let us know.


The following is stolen directly from Riptide’s website, experiment and find what you like. The most common is the barrel/barrel, I would always start there and change as needed.


•	The Cone / Cone setup is for those looking for a very carvy or surfy feel.  With this choice, the further you lean, the less resistance there is.

•	The Cone / Barrel setup is for those looking for a carvy or surfy feel but with a bit more stability.  With this choice, the resistance is constant throughout the range of motion.

•	The Barrel / Barrel setup is for those looking for higher stability at higher speeds but still highly maneuverable for slides, high speed carving and downhill applications.

•	The Barrel / FatCone setup is for those looking for higher stability at higher speeds but still highly maneuverable for slides, high speed carving and downhill applications.  This setup is ideal when you need to restrict the ends of the lean to prevent wheelbite or if you just like a more progressive feel to your setup. 

•	The Barrel / Chubby is our go to set up for most applications due to its versatility.  It is excellent for Freeride, Fast Freeride, Technical Downhill, Downhill and just flat out speed.

If you are using a single motor or dual diagonally mounted, go with the Calibers. If you are building a short wheelbase, like less than 19 inches from inside bolts to inside bolts, then go with the 44 degree Calibers on front and rear. If you are going for a faster more stable long wheelbase setup like most people are, then a split angle is the best option. Get the Randal 35-degree angle baseplate for the rear truck, and 50-degree Caliber baseplate for the front. this way you don't need wedges or you can further tune with wedges after that. Rule of thumb is to not have the front truck over 65 degrees. 

Rear 35 degree baseplate further dewedged a few degrees.
![20180225_142742|667x500](upload://kmEozW14FZALmY0bypVe2yOrhn7.jpg)

Front 50 degree baseplate wedged even further.
![20180225_142730|667x500](upload://ogsz52dgtOfRy6vaZg7CpY7QncK.jpg)

With a split angle setup, you can haul-ass at high speed without wobbles that are generated in the rear, since the rear truck just leans more than it turns now. And to make up for that lack of maneuverability, the increased front angle at 50-65 degrees will help you get around those turns you need to carve on your favorite routes. Tune your front angle to make it around those turns, altering them or changing them based on your experience in your area on your routes. That part is subjective and both the front angle and your wheelbase will determine if you make those turns in style or you must get off and reset the board.

If you are using or wanting a dual motor setup, TB218 are the shit, they are wide enough to carry some big motors and one of the only solutions now. As I stated above, these take the same baseplates so you can also use the 35 degree Randal baseplate in the rear to make the rear end feel dead and stable, while using any Caliber 44 or 50-degree truck with a combo of wedges on the front to get the desired turn radius. Keep in mind this also allows the truck to lean a lot more in the rear so pay attention to your motor clearance if you’re going to run those giant motors side by side. I have had to use 1 inch risers on my TB218 setups, get a strong stable riser for these super wide trucks, they need a kingpin upgrade as well. 


The axles of the TB218 trucks are longer than your typical skateboard truck and you can simply use spacers to get the desired width, think of them as variable width trucks because you can put the spacers on the inside or outside of the wheel bearings depending on the needs of your setups. Obviously precision spacers from companies like Don’t Trip will help a lot, bearing spacers work in a pinch, but I would recommend finding some thick precision spacers made for the job.

The take away for eskaters is that we can learn from all those types of skateboards that came before. We can take the agility of a Carver and combine it with the stability of a downhill setup and take advantage of everything learned before and push it forward. I now view split angles as a necessity on eskates to increase performance without any drawbacks, who wouldn't include the feature in their build?


If you need specific help with a setup already built and you are getting into tuning the finer details, post what you have and what you want it to feel like over here in the Bushing Setup help thread:  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bushing-set-up-help/42036/439

Nice post, I've been using the TB 218mm trucks with the Miurskate almost precision kit and it's been my favorite truck set up so far, feels carvy for me but super stable at higher speeds. My bushings hardness is different upfront its softer 90a and in the back I'm running 97a

That's a great start for the wheelbases we end up at with electrics, yup, great start dude, you are on track..Only suggestion would be to to try to change the angles as much as possible using baseplate options before wedges. find a 35 degree plate for the rear and then you won't need any wedges there, just risers. Wedges change the way the truck forces function and also might bend hardware in ways that make them weak. @Alphamail might have better info as to why wedges should be the last resort over baseplate or deck options.

This is a good way to "mimmik" what split angles do, and typically when you have different angles, the leverage on each will be different, meaning you will be forced to use different bushing duros on the front and back. 

If you stand on a 35 degree truck with a 90a bushing, it will be easier to lean over than a 50 degree truck on the same 90a bushing, and if you wish the front and rear to match in feel and reduce the chances of wheel lift, then the lower angle truck should feature a harder duro bushing or even a different shape. I personally run a Fat Cone on the board-side rear of my commuter setup, giving that extra leverage more bushing to compress and better matching my barrel/barrel in the front. get it?

In this way, both angle and truck width impact the amount of leverage put on the bushing, and we "tune" this fact using different duros and shapes in certain places. That's a subject better suited for the bushing thread and it's been talked about already, but highly related.

beginner pumping trucks pairs:

Bennett Vector 109mm in the front  
Tracker RTS 106mm in the rear
or
Bennett Vector 109mm in the front  
Randal 125mm 42 or 35 degree in the rear

there's also special modded Randals for the rear too like the "SKANDAL"  108mm

Probably the biggest argument against split angles is that it takes away the ability to ride switch.
That's basically non-applicable here, so split angles should really be totally standard for eskaters.

I'd also like to add, aside from riding trucks with different baseplate angles, or running wedges, another option is choosing a deck with split angles built in. There's quite a few out there.

Personally I prefer ~ a 7 deg split. I don't think there's really good reason to go all the way to a 0 rear for general purpose riding. Lowing the angle of the rear is a great way to provide stability, but its not like a board isn't stable unless you do that, so I would suggest designing around 'stable enough' rather than 'stable as possible'.

My advice for choosing your front/rear trucks and geometries is to put in the trucks that will give you the turning you want in the front, and the trucks that will give you the stability you want in the rear, and you'll basically get both.
That goes for everything, you're not just limited to splitting angles.
You can split angles, axle offset, hanger width, bushings, so on and so forth to get the best turning in the front, and the best stability in the rear. Even to the point of having completely different designs between front and rear, as indeed you see with a lot of the Gbomb stuff.

Also if you want precision on a budget, I think if you put precision just on the front you basically get most of a full precision setup, because turning is coming from the front.

Lastly, as far as speed wobbles coming from the rear, this isn't really relevant to the message of the thread, but my take on it more and more has been that speed wobble actually comes from the front, and you control it by putting your weight there. And the rear just has to be stable enough behave on its own without you having a lot of your weight on it to control it. In other words having a more stable geometry in the rear allows you to move more of your weight off of it so you can bring it forward to control the wobble coming from the front.

On the topic of TB218's I've had them only a couple months and they are warped to shit... like I have to replace them already and honestly doesn't feel like I got much use out of them... I don't do crazy anything with this deck it's my daily commuter to get to and from work, I even upgraded the bushings, because the stocks were trash imo, and it was a solid setup for a good month (1st month or so i waa working bugs out) now i cant even keep a belt on without popping it or shooting it off... just my experience thus far 

As for bushings I use riptides wfb 93a chubby's and 95.5a Fat cones, super stable, no speed wobbles w/ 0 wedges and 1/2" risers @30mph steady cruising

I got confused a bit, so I checked. Randall default baseplate is 50, just in case anyone else gets confused.

Flexy like Vanguard is not optimal because the flex dampens and delays response, but can kind of work. It's good with Randall IIs, but it's like a high gear pump. Kick it up to speed then start wiggling.

All setups can pump, but they just feel like different gears. Short wheelbase TKP can accelerate pretty well at low speed but it's hard keep it going at high speed. Big wheelbase RKP is hard to accelerate at low speed but you get big efficient pumps at high speed.

Oh I forgot to add, 3 of my LDPs have crazy riser and wedges with super long screws. Doesn't feel or look good but function is fine.

Kingpin upgraded to grade 8, this is a good upgrade for LDP if your baseplate doesn't have it.

[quote="CHAINMAILLEKID, post:10, topic:57929"]
but my take on it more and more has been that speed wobble actually comes from the front, and you control it by putting your weight there
[/quote]

I agree with everything you said...in regards to analog and ek8 except this. RWD Esk8 have shimmys from the rear because of motor torque, whether single or dual, that ends up being amplified by the front.

So making the rear as dead as possible minimizes the effect of these shimmys on the front. The less energy transferred through the board due to stiffness, lower Baseplate angles, or even a higher duro bushings. The less likely these will be amplified by the front to a point that the rider cannot control.

I think you actually experienced this the other day? Or was it someone else? Edit: it was @skatardude10

This seems like the perfect place to ask this question. What do you guys think of my truck setup. The trucks are just HK trucks as I wanted square hangers to make custom mounts easier to install. Now the question is that I have made a slight mistake in the angle that the mounts sit at so they are a little too low to the ground and scrape on certain curbs, so to fix that I have wedged the rear truck up slightly which has fixed the scraping issue. But now I think the angle might be too high for a rear truck as I had to wedge it on the opposite side to what you normally would, so the angle is now something like ~60 degrees. Will this be to high of a degree and the board will be unstable? I have it geared for around 55km/h. If it is, would I be able to get stiffer bushings to fix the issue? Oh and I think the front truck is about 45 degrees. 

That might be hard to understand so here is a picture for reference.![image|375x500](upload://yjN9aosYwEYU5gVe64C08iX3NDr.jpg)

Yep! I had this last Friday at 48.7mph, ouch. I can't dewedge the rear anymore with my current mounts, so I've ordered some WFB 95.5A chubs for the rear and 93A barrels for the front. Also, I think flat washers boardside on the front (obviously flat with chubs on back too) will lead to less rebound from the front to minimize wobbles accentuated by rebound.

 Subjective question alert...

What's yer wheelbase? (Measure correctly)

What is the truck hanger width?

Do you wish the overall setup to turn more or less than it already does? 

Can you make all the turns on your intended routes? 

At what speed if any do you get the wobbles?

Stability is in large part due to the rider, and technique. A 35 degree plate in the rear will help quite a bit though. You will be able to be more stable at faster speeds with a 35 rear. As for super stable? That would still depend on how you in particular handle that speed... It will be much more forgiving riding 35/45 or 35/50 than riding 45/45 or 50/50.

Just make sure you can adjust your mounts the amount that you are reducing degrees... I have 35degree bases with precision pivots... But I'd have to lift them off the deck with many inch risers and wedge (defeating the purpose) to get my TB mounts to fit under my deck.

Wheelbase is adequate, and sounds like a bushing tune issue too. 

With a 35 rear you would want a 50 or more front,  but to be honest I'm gonna recommend a 42/50 for ya because I think two wheel paths and better tuned bushings would get you there without going extreme. Try randal 42 rear that you could dewedge further if needed and a 50 front at 50..no more..and how much do you weight?

You shouldn't be getting wobbles at 15 deg on any even half reasonable setup.
No truck, and no setup is going to make up for form and practice.


Not to say don't make changes to your setup, but don't stop at just making changes to your setup.

There's good discussion in this thread:

@Deckoz @squishy654 @Cobber Thanks

So even if I was to whack in some super hard bushings you still think it wouldn’t work? I will try it out first and see what happens, I am pretty good at controlling speed wobbles. If that doesn’t work I guess I’ll just un-wedge it. 

What would you say is the max base plate angle as I’ve seen 50 degree calibers 2s

Edit: I actually made a bit of a mistake as it was a very rough guess before the wedge is around 9 degrees probably a little less, that would give me about 53 degrees in total any better? Just a hair off 50 degree calibers

If you do as DeckyBro suggests and go FWD, 53 in the front is workable (your HK hangers have no rake?), it is personal preference to a point. I'd drop the rear right down to say 20 degrees to balance it out so it really steers from the front and the rear is planted. With the right experience, bushings you should be able to ride that safely up to 55kmh no drama. It is not ideal and would not be my starting point if I could suggest anything. But if you learned to get along with it it could be really fun. As a crazy thing to try to make the rear more stable, if you have offset wheels flip the rear wheels so you shorten the track width of the rear, this will make them track inside the front wheels and add a extra feeling of stability to the rear.
Just try it, if you like it, keep it, if not change it back.

Right now I am liking 45/25degrees with 5mm/2.5mm rake, for general shenanigans & tomfoolery. I'd probably go to 45/20 if I was attempting to break the sound barrier or make it back to 1988.

55-60 Front/Rear 17-12 degrees works as a pump slalom set up...

Ok, thanks I’ll give the wheel flipping a try, and I would go front wheel drive but my motors are rear facing... that would look a bit goofy. 

I have riden these trucks without wedging (so 44 degrees front and back) upto 50kmh before without any wobbles in sight, I just wasn’t sure about with the new 53 rear, if it’s a no go I’ll just take out the wedge and maybe put it on the front truck.

Thanks heaps man I really appreciate the helpfulness of some members in here

if you imagine 45 degrees is the tipping point from being more stable, more twitchy, also going past 45 degrees puts increasing latteral load on the hanger/kingpin/bushing interface. The same truck design at 50 degrees will likely have more slop than at 40 degrees if it is prone cause the force comes from more the side of the bushing than in line with the king pin...

Rear wheel drive is really great for extended standup slides too, as you can keep the wheels spinning😎, so much fun! 

I honestly haven't tried this on a front setup though to see if it has the same benefit here... I do imagine my wobbles the other day were due at least in part to my motors pushing from the rear... I was gunning the accelerator when it happened... So for stability, I'd love to try front at some point. How many people realistically run fronts for stability?

I tried FWD by mistake for 2 rides. Had the phase wires incorrectly wired. Spud 29 with calibers, and a single 5065. I had the truck with the motor's kingping pretty tight. I got some pretty weird and consistent oscillations on FWD! Mostly in the back, it just started waggling, at a fairly low speed. I loosened the new front truck and tightened the hell out of the new back truck, and oscillations got better but still could not stomp them out with posture/weightshift.

Next day, with phase wires corrected, RWD, and trucks adjusted, no wobs of any sort, up to about 27mph no problems whatsoever.

Not really sure what was going on. I can't really call it speed wobs, as it wasn't violent or fast enough to throw me off. It oscillated while under power, coasting, and braking. Anyway, no more FWD for me :)

You think FWD is better then RWD. I just thought of it as a car the more power the better it is to push you along instead of pull you. I could see where fwd could be more stable as you have your planted foot that you keep most of your weight on right above the motors.

You got it, also it allows the rest of the board to act as it does when you fall DH. When the rear pushes this loads all your driven force in to the deck like a leaf spring.

I think the Front vs rear vs all wheel deserves it's own topic but to add to the current discussion:  

Back when I was still racing rally cars, my weapon of choice was Front Wheel Drive and it was much faster than Rear Wheel Drive cars on loose hillclimbs.  Front drive also has a tendency to level you out when coming out of a turn and getting into the throttle again.

only down side is that you have less grip. Mine sometimes does that. also you can't use kick tale or it will be very hard to.

but for speed board I see the benefit.

also car has lot of equipment at front so it is better to put mid engine and rear wheel config where it needs to control big momentum and more acceleration to eacape corners. at least for the racing cars

```
Unfortunately SZ does not give any spec's on the angles the base plate can adjust to.  The basic idea behind a split setup is to allow the front to turn more than the rear which can improve stability.  As the king pin angle approaches horizontal, the steering increases and conversely, as the kingpin approaches vertical the steering is reduced.  Along with that as the king pin angle approaches horizontal, the leverage over the bushings decrease and conversely, as the kingpin approaches vertical the leverage over the bushings increases.  This is why you cannot use the same bushings front and back unless the split is slight or the bushings have a high amount of adjustability like our KranK compound but it can only go so far.

Im not really having stability issues atm but when i upgrade my battery my speed is gonna change a bit and I'd like the board to be ready.

You are running a "synthetic split" (symmetrical trucks angles with asymmetrical bushing setup)?  I am also wondering you are are running the softer bushing boardside and the harder roadside.  Not that is is wrong, just the effect is minimized buy having the harder bushing in the non load bearing position

@Alphamail 
Hard board side. Soft road side. 
I have wedge risers atm but want to do real angles via the baseplates.

Kinda like the third one down.
I was having wheel bite issues so i thought having the rear truck de wedged would help.

In most setups using SZ TKP's I have not found a need to wedge the front, just dewedge the rear because the frucks turn a lot already

I kinda got confused, need a check. Can you please confirm if the usual correct layout for max effectiveness is : 

 - hard bushing road side and soft bushing board side,

Or 

- hard bushing board side and soft bushing road side? 

Also, when you mix shapes like chubby / barrel or Magnum / Cannon, which shape should go where?

- chubby / magnum board side and barrel / Cannon roadside

Or

- chubby / magnum road side and barrel / cannon board side?

Given bushing seats are asymmetric cut in hangers, usually the deepest side is roadside too right?

@Vanarian, good questions.  (Roadside = Top and Boarside = Bottom)

There are no hard set rules but the place to start is Hard or Larger bushing boardside and Softer or Smaller bushing roadside since the setup is more controlled by the boardside or weight bearing bushing. This covers you first two questions.  As for your third question, truck hangers vary, so you need to deal with each brand individually.

Half the fun if working with a setup is trying different things so if the traditional guidelines listed above aren't giving what you want you need to experiment.  A prime example is a Canon / Magnum combination, with one pair each you can try the following combinations where they are listed Roadside / Boardside:

1):  Canon / Magnum front, Canon / Magnum rear (symmetrical setup)
2):  Magnum / Canon front, Magnum / Canon rear (symmetrical setup)

3):  Canon / Canon front, Magnum / Magnum rear (synthetic split setup)
4):  Magnum /Canon front, Canon / Magnum rear (synthetic split setup)

Thank you for the explanation. This info should be a sticky!

I gotta try this, my current bushings are mounted the wrong way (based on start guidelines).

I have chubby board side and barrel road side both 90a kranks but I recently got some different duros some hard then 90a barrels in krank wbs aps and some softer barrels and got some sleeved washers. what should I expect as I mix those and should the chubbies always stay board side

Go nuts dude, experiment and see what happens, try all sorts of combos and see how they feel..

Here is something that doesn't happen so often, precision slalom trucks are available from Sweden, these will be gone quick..

At $550 I don't think so.
Why not go with a more established truck like Ronin?
They don't seem to offer any new technology. Just a normal precision RKP truck with removable axles.
