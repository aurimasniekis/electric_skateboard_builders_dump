So here's a quick question, what will be the best way to attach this motor hub to the motor shaft, the shaft has no flat edge nor does the motor hub have a key hole, I can always drill a key hole in some way and thread it. I wanted to avoid glueing them together but at the moment it may be the only way. The hub hole is 8mm diameter as is the shaft but it spins freely on the shaft - it is not tight. Any help would be appreciated.

It consists of grinding a flat spot of the shaft and drilling a hole for a set screw. Then, inserting the setscrew.
