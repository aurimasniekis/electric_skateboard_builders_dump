So I got these new caliber mounts but they don't fit. So guess I'll need to do some filing. Question is: Do I file the inside of the mount or the outside of the truck?

I'd file the clamp and the truck.  Whatever it takes to get a rock-solid connection that doesn't wiggle at all.

I'd file them away and get a split clamp :man_shrugging:
