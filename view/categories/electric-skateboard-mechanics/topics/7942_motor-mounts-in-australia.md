Hey!

I have been looking around for motor mounting kits, however since i'm in australia my prefered option, the torqueboards kit + pulley, is $170 USD inc shipping to australia which is very expensive.

I looked at entertion system, which is $110 USD, but would require me to modify my trucks and purchase abec wheels instead of the kegels I was originally looking to use.

Is there anyone who sells mounting kits for the kegels in australia, and if so, where?

Thanks!

Even if I ordered the VESC it would not go over $300, but thanks, is there a coupon?

You could stock up on some quality parts from @torqueboards , if you add a vesc that would be 270, maybe add something and sell it here afterwards?
