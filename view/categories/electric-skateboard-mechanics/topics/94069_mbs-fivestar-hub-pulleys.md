Does anybody have an idea for hubs for MBS Fivestars? They look to have the same mounting holes as the Rockstars. I want to have the option of 9" tires. 
Im specifically looking at these pulleys and am wondering if they fit.

If not these, then which Pulleys can I use? (US source)

@Idea 's pulleys fit both. Question is do @marcmt88 's ? 
(I've asked Marc, he does not have Fivestars to test this)

I use idea's 20mm wide pulley and love it. I can confirm the hole spacing is the same across all 5 hole pattern hubs from mbs.

The fivestar hubs have a hexagon shaped recess for the bolt holes that will most likely require a hex shaped, threaded stand off.

hmm the only problem with ideas is the euro location. 
Marc is comparatively down the street and I already have an order in from him for motor mounts. 
Im debating on if I should order the Pulleys before the mounts ship.

Maybe just mention to Marc about these hex standoffs and see what he thinks.

Some pics to show the gap between wheel and pulley where the standoffs sit

@marcmt88 Takes a different approach to the pulleys. They seat almost flush on the hub by the looks of things:

Yes, flange is 4-5mm thick that seats flush against the hub.

Why such long stand offs? I have seen a bar of pulley material which explains why thee isn’t a flange but surely this limits distance between motors? The biggie motors maybe

Just room for extra belt width I suppose. I've got too much room between motors still.

If anything longer standoffs would just increase wheel width

Going to be printing these over the weekend and test fitting them on my current TriSpokes.
Loosely based on Marcs design.

Yeah no MBS trispokes are a rather old design.
It's what my 2nd hand board has on. I've ordered some cheap generic pulleys of AliExpress for now. Eventually I'll be getting 5star wheels and will contact you then.

Even twistar? The same pattern? Can you confirm this? I've got 40mm from the hole to the center and 47mm between each hole. This twistar holes are not as good as rockstar but you manage to pass some M4 scrus.

Yep 40mm axle to bolt, evenly spaced in a 5 spoke pattern.
