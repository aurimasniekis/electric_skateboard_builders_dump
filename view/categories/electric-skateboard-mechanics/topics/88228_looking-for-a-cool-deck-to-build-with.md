hay I am looking for any sort of longboard deck that isn't a common type of board for my new eskate. I had a surfboard design before but I don't want to do that one again. I was considering
another board from flea-bay but I don't mind paying 60 to 100 for a neat looking board...I don't need a design on the bottom sense there will be a carbon fiber enclose underneath. any links are appreciated.

My cousin thinks this is pretty cool.




You gotta define "cool," otherwise you're just asking to be trolled ðŸ˜…

I would suggest reading some build logs untill you see something 'cool' 

I personally love kick tails and decks must have pop, most here don't care about either.

I thought I might get trolled..................


anyways I'm looking for something like the decks that phychotiller uses. something that pops out not something that is cookie cutter looking.

there's a make your own kit out there, with the ability to select the number of laminates you want... It would be relatively easy to add a fabric top and bottom layer, just grab some t-shirts with a design you like and go to town, I'd think.

Choose the enclosure first and you should end up with a professional look esk8 later.
