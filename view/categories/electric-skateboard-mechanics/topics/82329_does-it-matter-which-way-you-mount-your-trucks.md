I feel like a total noob typing this out but my searches didn't yield much info. With longboards it seems customary to mount the trucks with the bushings outward as opposed to inward on usual skate trick decks. Does it really matter which way though? 

In my current build, I want to reverse mount my motors, but the Boardnamic Mounts are kind of short, and I could get the angle higher if the bushings weren't in the way and I could mount them inward. 

What's the scoop on this?

Hey my friend.  It all depends on what trucks you have.  If you have longboarding trucks then they will be most likely reverse king pin or RKP and will have the bushings outer.  If you have traditional trucks or TKP then the bushings will be on the inside.  Facing each other.  Never reverse either.

Cool, so how do you know which they are?

In theory if you reverse, tighten, and lower the angle of the back truck you get a sliding motion but a massive turning radius, its a bad idea and you shouldn't do it, but you can

Traditional king-pin (TKP) trucks point above the outside of the axle, reverse king-pin (RKP) has the kingpin go under the axle

So it's obviously safe to say Caliber II are RKP trucks then

RKP have an angled kingpin and TKP are more vertical.

So, maybe an angled riser would be a better way to get the additional ground clearance with my motors

```
Careful with angled risers, the angle the king-pin makes with the deck/ground changes the turning/stability...
- shallow angles -> wide turning radius/more stability
- steep angles -> tight turning radius/less stability

```
The pivot/cup always goes toward the end of the board, away from the rider, regardless of where the bushings are.  The bushings will be on different sides depending on if it's TKP, RKP,  DKP, or NKP

That deck is really designed for RKP trucks but its on the short side for a longboard so if you want it to be carvy then you could go TKP.  Keep the thing under 30mph though.  RKP are designed for stability at speed so if you want to go fast then RKP all the way and do some reading on angles and bushings.

If you want that deck but longer than buy a Minority Downhill on Amazon...RKP Paris clones but the wheels suck...very nice at speeds even with cheap 90mm ABEC clones

Come on now.  You have to start somewhere and if you don't ask then you won't ever find out. 
To a lot of guys and gals this is all brand new, to others its something we've done for years.  A thread like this opens your eyes to all kinds of possibilities and I for one would not be so arrogant as to assume I know everything and really helpful links pop up a la @treenutter.  Thanks for that btw.  Encourage not ridicule is the name of the game.  Peace

@Treenutter is on top of it but there are something that are just to simple if you have ever skated/looked at complete boards.  Plus there is a noob question thread for these type of questions.

You definitely want the pivot cups toward the ends of the deck.  That being said, everything else is up for negotiation.  Your imagination is the only limit.

@Skunk Yes, you can even mount the trucks on top of the deck if you want, with the nuts on top.

use some offroadwheels with snow chains, apply snowboard wax to bottom of board buy ski pass and head for the hills :smile:

I saw what you're saying.  And I'm telling you that I saw a similar, but different, image in the past and to find it again, I used [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lowrider+skateboard&t=canonical&iax=images&ia=images).  And ended up finding a different one, one that was better than the one I'd seen before.  So you can listen, or not listen, I don't care.  ***It doesn't fucking matter anyway.***

I'm sure a Google search would have provided me with some decent info as well, but this is better because now I can see and learn how it directly applies to the application of Esk8, which is far more beneficial. Just how I feel at least.
