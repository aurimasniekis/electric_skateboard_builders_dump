Is there a gasket on the core to keep from debris entering?
What are the draw backs of a 10mm gear?
I suppose this fits dual 6380 with the 240 hanger 
Is the cover POM or 3D printed?
```

## \#3 Posted by: Kug3lis Posted at: 2018-11-14T14:27:17.555Z Reads: 592

```
There is V-ring same as on Mini
6380 would fit on 240 but I think they would be bit too much if ran high currents but it depends.
Cover is the same plastic used in FatBoy SS impact/noise reduction plastic.

Oh okay so I guess there will be a stainless face as well.
They may be fine as I am considering them for 4wd. So less stress per drive.

I like the thinness of this drive! Will torque/gear wearing be an issue as they are 10mm? Let's say if i were to use one of these for a single drive.

Shouldn't be I just updated as in reality Mini gear width is 14mm. So 4mm less will not have much different :) Also don't forget this is on urethane in worst case you will slide which will reduce stress on teeth compared to pneumatics.

Also on the side it should be even more silent compared to mini as contact area minimizes so I wouldn't be surprised that it will be the same noise as belt drive :)

So i have some good news and bad news...

Good news is that the drive will fit e-caliber hanger with 6355 motors (on non angled decks like evo or will need to tighten down as it can touch the hub because drive lift ups on evo my -5º degrees) 

Bad news because of 2mm difference between TB218 and Caliber hanger profile it will be two options when buying TB218 bigger one and E-Caliber:

Caliber: 16.6 mm x 18.2 mm
TB218 18.4 mm x 20.4 mm

![image|375x500](upload://fIVyFQiB4gzXoYOLNshnenCuaGD.jpeg) 

You can use e-caliber one on TB218 but will need to sand down 1mm on each side :) 

So here are first prototype part fittings.

TB218:

![image|666x500](upload://5xwby5lASEe5d7zC9Zf1NFKQDR0.jpeg) 

E-Caliber (Used normal hanger)

Baseplate with mounting hubs

I doubt we going to make multiple mounting styles for this drive... As it would increase the price of it :) But if you grab FatBoy SR 230/240


@BruSkater the drive is 80mm height so you would have like 5mm clearance on the bottom if you don't mind it sure you can ride with 90mm but I think its too small

No, we just starting making them and collecting pre-orders "small group buy" on black friday so we could order material in bulk for it :)

Hanger is from separate group buy if you want you need to get it separate.

Regarding sound it should be same or less than Mini at the moment everything is in making and also if we record noise in workshop it would sound loud and not pleasant compared to the sound on the road :) You can look up @mackann board

Hm with nano I was hoping for small, light and maybe cheaper. Like 2x6355 on e-caliber with 97mm flys.

TB218 or FB230 is not that small. Boa not that light. FB230 makes it not that cheap.

Hmmmm! Still watching, holding my breath!

Hey sorry, didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I understand all of above. e-caliber story sounds like it's not fully developed, so I'm still hanging around. And you're right, running tb218 it's still a very nice price point (but sigh I don't think I would).

Wheel gear sits on wheel hub adaptor which itself has bearing and then 2 bearings on the wheel so 3 bearings for wheel gear should be more then enough :)

@sebaszz you mean into the inside of the board? It only fits on the inside on the outside kingpin is problem :)

I love the price of this one, like its seriously competitivly priced for a -dual mount w/ stabilizer- type of mounting system. 

even if i go gear on my trampa i might still throw money at this :heart_eyes:

Is the width important for the strength of the gears. I mean, For 100kg + rider should I choose wider and go for mini or it doesn’t matter?

Width is more important for power if you considering running high power motors like more than 60A per motor when you should go for mini but for everyone standard boards with standard vesc settings this should be more than enough :)

I see, thanks. I don’t really know much about materials or design strength in a gear so I wanted to make sure that I would not break the gears by hitting the brakes too hard. 
It surely is not the same thing but my fat ass used to strip 9mm belts like they did not even have teeth on to begin with.

I know this probably wouldn't work on the Nano, but @Kug3lis have you tried making a herringbone or helical gear drive? With no manufacturing or CNC background, I can only imagine it would be very difficult to make, but I cream at the idea of hearing how silent some of your drives with herringbone gears and glops of grease could be, even as a one off.

With the 3D printed herringbone gears I made, they were about 70-80% quieter than my spur gears, and it was amaaaaaazing.

We have tried in the spring but results there not what we expected or wanted :) So after many fails and tries we decided to stick to simple spur gears :) At least will not need to replace gears for customers who fail to align correctly. Also helical require much wider gears than spur gears :slight_smile:

So neither nano neither mini would work with them as it would too small...

Here is 2 nano kits ready to install on the deck with 6374 and tb trucks:

Not quite same, G-67 is NLGI#1, G-4700 is NLGI#2 (viscosity rating, larger number is thicker)

Also G-67 is not synthetic, G4700 is synth. Usually synthetic seems safer for plastic/rubber.

Hm and G4700 has MoS2 which is great for metal but usually not good for plastics (but maybe okay with POM?)

It's so crazy, the datasheets for the greases are so different.

G67 is mineral oil based (possibly not good with plastics/rubbers) with adhesion improvers, specified as "extreme pressure". With properties tested against DIN and ISO standards. Viscosity specified as NLGI#1 (most greases are NLGI#2 which is thicker). It's very interesting because it's thin, and very sticky.

The others are plastic compatible synthetic greases (not mineral oil), with properties tested against JIS. The Penetration Density spec might also be a viscosity spec, and the numbers are similar to G67. No adhesion improvers. No claim for "high" or "extreme" pressure.

I'm as confused as ever.

The funny thing is, I think you can run these gears dry. The lube most likely just changes the sound but not so much the wear.

Thanks though @3DServisas for asking the lube specialist.  Despite my confusion, it's very very helpful.

Finally cut the motor shaft to put the motors on.. a little too tight to try to fit these 6374s on E-caliber. not sure if it's a good idea. there's basically not a lot of axle to work with after fitting everything together.

Also, still waiting for the right Kegel core wheels to put on. either 100s BOAs or up-coming TB 110s, these 90mm Popoca will stay on for looks for now.

I literally just took a hacksaw at it. put the motor gear on, marked a line and used some elbow grease. 
I'm using e-caliber. I dont think my 6374s actually fits if I pushed both pressfited all the way in, forgot to check the first side. that's probably why one side has slightly more room on the axle than the other.

Boas are great, i have been waiting for them to restock the white ones since I paid during Black Friday sale tho. hopefully they will actually restocked them. I was told a few weeks back in December, asked again this week, and they said the same thing.

im open to trade these old TB 6374 (sensored, cut axle) for either TB or Maytech 6355s +- some amount of money. got them from @Lambjr088 a while ago (only "bench tested" but a lot of scratches :woman_shrugging:)

yeah I would prefer 6355s. if anyone is planning to use these on TB218 and open to trade hmu. 

I think if I lower the the mount angle and then wedge the base plate it should be fine. it will just be a slight split angle, which i'm a fond of. Right now, it still has room for turning but idk if I like my motors so close to the ground.

im more worry about e-cal not being long enough atm. turning should be ok.

Hey guys, I'm new to the forums. Just purchased the nano gear drive for my diy belt driven board and this will be my first gear/direct drive. I plan on using dual torque board 6374 on a tb 218mm, just wondering anyone that runs the same setup, how much of the motor shaft did you have to cut/ how long does the shaft have to mount perfectly to the motor spur gear so that it doesn't hit the cover? Thanks in advance.

It's best to use loctite for bearing glueing on the spur, on the keyway and most importantly on set screws because if they come off the hole they will destroy gears.

Hi everyone!

Received my drive today and it feels and looks awesome! Money really well spent :+1: 

Only issue i'm having, is that I can't press my flywheel clones on the wheel pulley. Think it's because the core is a bit thicker than normal abec 11 flywheels. Could probably be fixed with a bit of drilling. Just thought i'd let everyone know.

Anyways, awesome work @3DServisas & @Kug3lis  ! Keep up the good work!

Wheel hub adapters are hard fit. You need to hard press them in so no movement.

I definitely didn't press very hard. Will try that. Just looks like there is not enough room for the core when comparing the wheel adapter and wheel core with a screw.

Tried pressing but it didn't go in. I'm afraid if I press any harder I will break something.
This is what I mean with the screw.

Nano-drive gears were not made to drive big wheels, you will probably grind the gear teeth’s… Imagine that the bigger the wheel the bigger leverage you put on the gear teeth

Don’t know we never designed or experimented with pneumatic wheels for these drives. These are urethane gear drives with max wheel size estimated 110mm. **If something happens its up to you**

So, this is over? :D 
Good!
What made you change your mind?
Have you taken time to ride it?

I have done some more testing since the 1st 50kms.
I feel more and more in confidence with the Nano-drive on AT wheels.

I don't really know (I haven't tested this kit with urethan, and I have ridden 107 with 5065 140kv only), but here with the 6374 130kV the torque it's pretty awesome, direct, like the brake too compare to belt :smile: but it's more noisy.

Will I be able to rock the tb218 trucks with the 6380 170kv motors or do I have to go 6374. How often will I have to lubricate the gears and should I be worried about the plastic gear breaking? Last, when will the group buy price end and when are they going to ship? Thank you so much and keep up the amazing work

Hi @Kug3lis @3DServisas 

Ive ordered these drives but in order to work on a custom talon deck design and some TB218s and i could really use some of the dimensions of the nano drive.
(already checked website and thread for them)

Would you have a drawing with the dimensions on if possible? 
or if you could share privately as im really eager to know if customisations are needed to a talon design using your product.(an answer i assume many more here would like to know too)

Hi buddy, couple of questions for you?

what KV motors did you go for with the 2.67 ratio and the bergmeisters?
130 or 150KV?

what is the length to cut the motor shaft so it fits the nano gear drive?
```

yes exactly i see you are very quick to try and flame people for asking relevant questions....
on a li-ion 10s 130kv would hardly do 20mph real world and 150kv 26mph

already done the esk8 calculations hence i put 130kv or 150 hoping to gain insight of another person doing the same.....

Received the gear drives already and i have to say first impressions are these are very nicely put together precision made product!!!
The loctite being included for the drives  is a very nice touch!!
Focbox somehow arrived too even though im batch 3 (i guess most people fed up and cancelled orders as they are unable to get any meaningful answer from the company owner on the focbox cut out issues)

but gear drive 100% QUALITY!!!!! cawnt wait to get the rest of the kit!!!!!

I've got my drives setup and I've taken a couple 6ish mile rides. I've been having some grease escape through the crack between the plastic cover and the mount plate. The egress is happening around the top and bottom of the motor pulley. What could this mean? Too much grease in the drive? I've tightened the mounting hardware as much as I can. I stripped one screw already so I don't think I can make it any tighter. Maybe it's too tight. 

I'm also getting quite a bit of heat from my 6374 motors. Could too much heat build enough pressure in the drive to force grease out? I'm working on fixing this with my vesc settings.

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!

Depends of which grease, but I think you probably just added way to much and after it heats up it tries to escape as there are no space for it inside should be okay just clean up after ride until it has optimal amount.

@Touch415 it all depends on how you ride. There are people who ride 100mm wheels and have only few scratches and there are people who grinded through the case even with bergmeister wheels :)

I changed to Mobilegrease 28, made them louder then with the originally shipped grease by 3DS. You could develop a special riser i guess which would turn the deck even more in a resonance body.\
But seriously, I like the sound but the Japanese citizen are getting scared. I had to run off the police a week ago and would like to continue using this setup as my main commuter.

Has anyone experienced this? I took apart my drives to service them and noticed that the plastic of the housing started to melt a bit under the circular metal gasket. The rubber v-ring was a little dirty but wasn't completely dry of lube. Since the melting area was only under this metal ring and since the only moving part that is in contact with this ring is the rubber v-ring I am hypothesizing that the metal ring itself just got so hot due to friction between it and the v-ring that the housing melted a little. 

Other than cleaning and lubing the metal ring and v-ring, is there any thing else I can do to prevent this? 

Also, how much lube should I generally be using? I've taken to basically just 'painting' lube on the wheel and drive gears. Should I fill more of the housing?

you could try asking the owner of the company @Kug3lis  for support but his attitude to me was he cant be bothered to offer a assembly guide or bother responding to PMs on the forum so good luck getting support from 3D print services.

You can try but all he will say is your not a good customer, you dont spend enough money with him for him to even respond to emails and if you have problems read the forum for support...

good luck

You should use put a bit more than normal grease inside the gear drive as the excess will be slowing leaking through the v-ring and lubricating it. Without lubrication v-ring heats up. Also bit of melting is nothing but as it only melts a bit of plastic on the sides.

Here is typical example of how much grease we put in our assemblies:

![image|375x500](upload://62qHXvmG7wLsqzmSQDFdRVSDRDW.jpeg) 

@ju5t sorry but your attitude was not acceptable in the first place how do you expect anyone to respond to your messages when you spam everywhere and accuse of things which don't make sense like the small difference of different grub screws which were different than photos because they were out of stock and got different brand ones and you asked to replace gear drive because you can't make screws stay tightened and always getting loose and after my recommending you use red loctite if green breaks for you and can't hold screws in place you started blaming product design... 

Also I am not owner of the company I am just bridge between my busy father which works all the time making stuff and this forum. I am trying to provide as much support I can do in my already busy work days.
