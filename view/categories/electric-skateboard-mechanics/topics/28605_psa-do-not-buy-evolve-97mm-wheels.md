While the Evolve 97mm wheels look totally badass, they have a couple major flaws with them.

1. The hubs are center set. This combined with a wider contact patch leaves regular ABEC pulleys like the Enertion pulley sunken into the wheel a bit which means part of the teeth goes toward the inside of the wheel. This leaves the belt touching the wheel unless you space it out with at least 4 washers.

2. The 76A duro is misleading. This feels much more like 78-80A duro and is very noticeably rougher to ride than my 97mm 75A flywheels.

3. The biggest and most important flaw is that the thane formula is god awful. Mine chunked on the **first** ride

and someone on the Esk8 squad on facebook had this happen to them on their first **week**

Hahaahahah, I was looking at the FOCBOX's on his website thats why I had the name left in mind. But I was seriously about to buy those 'Evolve' wheels! Like another 20 minutes and I would have lost a $100( but I must say they are beautiful!

Yeah this still is a problem with their 83mm wheels. They most likely didn't bother because most of their demographic/user base wouldn't know any better...

Most DIY'ers and long-time Longboarders/Skateboarders would know though.

On the plus side Evolve are willing to take back both sets of wheels i got from them. I might pick up their 75A flywheels since they're the only ones who have them in stock.

Also, here's what I mean about the pulley being "sunken" in. You can see that if the belt was resting against the retaining wall of the pulley, it will hit the wheel in resting position. I'm using a 9mm belt in the picture, but a 12mm belt for the 12mm pulley would be even worse.

(excuse the cat hair)

The solution would be to either give up those couple mm of teeth and have the belt sitting further out, 3d print a ring to sit in between the pulley and wheel, or use a lathe to cut off some thane from the pulley side of the wheel.

ChrisChaput said 6 weeks, even less than a month, for them to become available.  and this was said 9 days ago so we're as close a couple weeks for them to drop.

I actually had the same problem with a pair of flywheel clones and diys wheel pulley so I 3D modeled and printed a ring that would space it out. I found it even helped on abec 90mm flywheels especially if I want to use a 15mm belt. I don't believe it will work on enertion mounts though, as the hole and mounting gear all need to line up If anyone wants the files for that lmk.

I can provide similar feedback here as well. I'll post pictures once I'm alone in the office later. Mine are beginning to chip near the edges after only 4 days of usage. I was able to correct the sunken wheel pulley problem in the Raptor V1 by cutting 2 small pieces of CAT-5E cable and inserting between the wheel pulley and the wheel itself. I simply wrapped the cable around the wheel pulley. This allows for about a 1-2mm clearance, so that the wheels don't touch the belts. It barely clears and I still don't see any sign of belts getting worn down so far.

So here are some pictures of my Evolve 97mm wheels. It's not as bad as previously thought. Only one small chip and small crack on the edge. The overall vibration is reduced, but not as durable as I'd had hoped. I know the wires are not aesthetically pleasing, but it does the job. I'll have to cut those ends off of the wires when I get some free time.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/2/72e9f5412871d3d5df3fd281fa7e167be5e3d06f.jpg" width="374" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/3/5306c3527799b80c2c49cb2210e7b8e8d0a80b12.jpg" width="374" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/2/42237c6ea0f0bdb916a6ba3ff03ff43263a145d4.jpg" width="374" height="499">

Why would you want a narrower contact patch? Less drag? O was under the impression that people like wider contact patches for best grip.

My shaved MBS wheels have a pretty wide contact patch, they are grippier than my 97mm flywheels, I love them

That is a wider contact patch compared to the 44mm of ABEC flywheels. I've ate it losing traction on a sharp turn, so I would definitely appreciate a wider contact patch.

I've heard from a few different people now that black thane in general is crap since some people are taking shortcuts and saving money by mixing old crappy thane in there, and since its not a colored thane, you can't tell what kind of quality it is or what's in there just by looking at it. You could be getting somebody else's leftover crap from last year in there, who knows.

Riding with a few folks on evolve last month two of them had chunked evolve wheels... super lame.  And Evolve wasn't fixing/replacing them.  I'd avoid.

I love my Abec 11 83/97/e-fly 107's!  Kudos to @chrischaput for such quality wheels!!!  I even got the efly 107 monsters to mount up w/ dual motors...  But will still grab the new 107 flywheels when they become available.  Remember a group buy or discount to the folks here when they come out!!
