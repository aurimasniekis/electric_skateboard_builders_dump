Planning on converting the board ive got now into an urban instead of street (Flipping the trucks) Therefor im looking to see if anyone know if i can just buy the new mounting clamp from urban and mount the carbon plate from the street onto it? Anyone done it before?

Oh well, they only write it on the clamp for the street one but it turns out it does no problem.

They need to update the website.
