Hi all, 

Found a really nice dropdown deck but my enclosure won't have enough clearance. Would someone happen to know if I can just topmount my Calibre trucks without any risks involved. 

Can't find a way / kit to do this.

Do you mean drop-through? People do it often, no kits involved. Just mount it as you would any topmount and maybe reinforce the hardware with one of these:

Or those X plates floating around the forums.

Drop-trough, that's what I meant to say :smile:

This is great advice, just what I needed. Thanks a lot!
