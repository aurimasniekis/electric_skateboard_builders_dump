I am a huge open source/hardware proponent and I am kind of annoyed by people not sharing 3D models for mounts, pulley, gt2b mods, remote covers, pulley cover, wheels etc. This in my opinion, slows down the progress that can be made. STL files don't matter because they can't be modified(easily)

I have decided to post the relevant solidworks files(and the formats the that I can convert to) on my github page. Also I am taking requests to design the commonly used parts for you, for free and share it. 

To give you an example, if we had all the parts together we could assemble the whole drive train and inspect for errors instead of sorting things out by trial and errors. I started ...

What I am hoping we would discuss in this thread is different design needs and solutions. The designers will design based on common needs and suggestions and also make modifications. Requests in this thread would be awesome. 

And what I am hoping comes out of this is a sticky thread that has links to all the 3D parts out there.

Designs Completed
1. snap in version of pulley
2. Mud flaps
3. Pulley cover(derivative of something I found here)

Things to do:
1. VESC Enclosure

Snap in Flywheel and Kegel wheel pulleys with built in bearing inserts would be nice. 

I think the most common config is 36T with 9mm, 12mm and 15mm options.

I tried making the a 32 Tooth one with room for either the nut or the head of a bolt for both the kegel and the abec/clones. There wasn't enough room. The head of the bolt or the nut extends into what should be an empty cavity for the belt.  

The kegel version without the nut cavity did work because the kegel hub pattern is smaller than the abec/clone one. I'm at school for the time being and don't have a lot of time to do bulk models and batch releases for a bit but if I get a chance I'll double check to see if the 32 can work with a smaller bolt head or maybe a socket head cap screw would work

I use M5x65 mm bolts and they are pretty small, maybe they could work.

I, absolutely, understand that schools sucks in so much of ones time, but you already have done an awesome job with all the pulleys, thanks for that.

I know you are not a huge fan of the snap in versions, but I think we should give them a try. It actually might be very easy now, given that you already have the models.

When I get time maybe during automatically reading week, I'll see if I can do a mass upload if a snap in version but I can tell you know it would work for the kegel. I've snapped off the prongs that stick out quite easily during the test phase of me making those when they came out too thick, just so I could check the rest of the fit.

The flywheels do have an advantage in their hub allowi ng for thicker studs that kinda integrate into the hub portion of the pulley as well.  But we'll see once I get the time.

My brother and I have been talking about enclosures in general. I had the idea of an almost modular enclosure set up. Say you wanted this type of box with this nose and this back. Or one with the same nose and back but a bit longer or shorter. But he sucks at 3D modeling. So that's as far as it got.

Now, how safe will this be. Nylon has some flex to it as well. The clamp will definitely need a wider clamping space due to how much more flexible nylon is compared to aluminum and other mount materials.The mount is also going to be connected to a potentially 70C motor and higher.

What about this idea. 
When it starts raining or it has been raining then the roads are wet. Is it possible to 3D print mudguards that snap on or slide over a caliber truck?
This way the water on the roads are no problem because it stays in the mudguards and it doesn't splash on the battery enclosure. 

Only problem is the side with the motor and belt. 
Is there somebody that can help with the 3D design and collaborate if this is a good idea or not?

Thx!

Hey, 

looks great so far! Some things You might want to extend the part for screwing in the motor mount - currently there is not much room for moving it. 

Check [this onshape tutorial](https://www.onshape.com/videos/lets-assemble-a-vise) - it illustrates how to connect different parts (with mechanical movements) - check the last part with the screws, might help for testing the movement of the motor mount ;-)

@mishrasubhransu
I will have a look - do you know if the measurements are correct?

I've got a parametric version of an HTD-5M pulley, but I can't get it to render below 34t- it's in the source file linked above, part studio labeled "36t HTD 5M Pulley", if anyone is fluent in OnShape and would like to trouble shoot it.

I can handle most file types: Parasolid, STEP, IGES, solidworks, etc.

The smallest pulley I can find a decent step file on is 18t.

These look just as they should if you were going to get these injection molded and this would work excellently if you were going to pay the thousands of dollars to get a mold made and get them made out of injected nylon but as a 3D printed piece it wont work. when you get these 3D printed youre going to have the shear stresses in the same plane as the print planes. you WILL snap the prongs/studs on these. I snapped then off by hand then I was making mine and hey came out too big to test the fit on the rest of the wheel. The cavity it goes into are about 5.75mm in diameter so these will be that size or smaller and then 10 of these wont take the strains of a full grown persona trying to accelerate or brake.  Looks like to me your design only goes as far down as the outer most edge of the core and not all the way down to the curved face of the core which will make this affect worse since youll have twisting between the pulley over a longer length allowing for more twist and strain on fast accelerations or hard braking. I bring this up again for **your** safety. I've printed like 40 kegel wheels in total (some stock piled back ups but a little less than half of that was fine tuning the fit and I'm telling you from considerable experience if you have someone use this they will more than likely get hurt due to a sudden loss of braking or power. 

Please dont take this as discouragement of new ideas and concepts, its not that, It's just not safe for this particular wheel. The flywheel has much larger areas in the same shear planes and so that is more than likely well suited for this application though I would still recommend using Nylon SLS vs conventional thermoplastics. This concept may very well have worked if the holes in the core were bigger or if the printer materials were much stronger. PLA/ABS/PETG wont work with this. Nylon SLS _might_ just be strong enough if youre using this with dual drive and splitting the load over two wheels or 20 prongs/studs. I think with a single wheel drive youd be pushing the limits here.

If you fillet the base of the prongs, I am sure it would survive with nylon SLS printing (offered by shapeways). 

I didn't have a weighing scale around, else I would have given a concrete proof.

yes like this, this will limit the amount of bending the studs will experience. However you see how you have a fillet on the inside as well? that isnt needed because the center of the wheel is flat once it gets to the bearing. Between the bearing and the edge of the hub I measured this to be just shy of 8mm so thats what I use on my models. Hope that makes sense. Pics for reference.

I completed the snap in for 40Teeth 12 mm. I still need to work on where the spacers go and reducing further mass. The pulley I made is completely parametric(based on tooth number, pitch, bearing measurements, pulley width) so one can change just those values as per their need. 

As you can see in the pic below, this doesn't really work with standard caliber trucks, so I'll have to modify that in cad as well

My original plan was to put things in github and do version control from there, but apparently github doesn't like the solidworks file, because these are binary file and the diffs(difference in texts between the previous file) are huge. I'll probably share it on google drive and give you guys a download link.

Any one have 3D models of the commonly used wheels that you might want to share or have links to files. @JuniorPotato93?  

I am going to modify CAD model of the standard caliber trucks to fit the snap-in pulley, but need to design it with respect to particular wheels. Thanks in advance.

Good to see you are doing this hobby a service mate. Seems like everyone is too interested in starting a business here than sharing designs. Dont get me wrong, people on here are a big help in pointing you towards already available products but i feel theres too much marketing and not enough sharing going on for a DIY site. Providing already manufactured parts to those of us who dont have the equipment to manufacture them ourselves is a great deed but i think that the designs should be shared for those of us they want to have a crack at it seeing as they are marketing in a forum about DIY. Just my 2c

To answer my own question, the 3D cad of the abec 11 pulley is available at http://www.3dcontentcentral.com/parts/download-Part.aspx?id=703494&catalogid=171 thanks to @zeinstra.

I made the final pulley and made the wheel mating part to perfectly mate the above model. I assembled them with 180mm caliber truck models. Sure they are short, I was wondering if I can use 184mm caliber 2 trucks. **Can someone give provide me the dimensions** of the caliber 2 trucks. Just the length of the rod and the length of the threaded part.

I completed a mud guard for 90mm wheels. It will need shims to make sure that it doesn't rub against the bearings. Also will have to increase the clearance distance so that small rocks don't get trapped in between the wheel and the mud guards.

Nice work!

Do you need to modify the wheel to make it fit?
When you make the pulley exactly as the inside of the 3d model of the wheel  that it will be a very tight fit.
I needed a press to make it fit which is perfect for my purpose.

Looks nice, but there are problems with the design

1. The pulley cover has some structural problem(the part surrounding the wheel pulley has no support) and I am fixing right now
2. The pulley cover is tested in assembly only for the 40T snapin pulley that I made. 
3. None of the holes are threaded, so I don't know how you will assemble the whole thing on your trucks

Looking forward to see the changes you are making.
I won't go over 40T for now so that should not be an issue for me at this moment.

Unless I am missing something, I threaded the holes myself, no need to have that in the design. M4 seems to work fine so far.

@mishrasubhransu - He has the 6374 motor and it's 10mm and steps down to 8mm. 6355 is 8mm all the way through. For other motors it would also need to clear the cir-clip which can be almost 12mm diameter.

That is exactly right. 
The clip however seems to need a clearance of about 15mm but it's about the same height as where the motor mounts. So I am not sure if it would rub and needs to be cleared.

Thanks @torqueboards and @EMC75. I increased the clearance to 11mm. Didn't do more otherwise it might affect the structural integrity.

Did major changes to the pulley cover. Let me know what you guys think. 

Right now the system is meant to be used with 90mm wheel, 280(56Teeth) mm belt, 16T motor pulley, 40T wheel pulley. All of this is configurable by just editing the motor mount part and all other part will modify themselves automatically.

I have saved the stl file for the mud guard in the flywheel folder. It's only for 90 mm wheel though. I need a 83mm wheel dimension for make a 83 mm one. Does any one have one?

There won't be any drag with the bearing because of a shim(spacer) between the bearings and mud flap.

I think a smart idea would be integrating the mud flap with the pulley cover but then it has to be made specifically for a particular mount.

The new design is pretty similar to the last one except that I just made it into two parts which can be slid in from both sides. Their movement is restricted in all direction except one and that is fixed by using screws. This should prevent even the tiniest of rocks(except fine dust) entering into the pulley assembly. Files are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1q9GisJy4tHN1JiSlZubmVpaUk?usp=sharing 

Please feel free to critique this design and post your suggestions

I have designed this for 90mm wheel, 280(56Teeth) mm belt, 16T motor pulley, 40T wheel pulley. I'll design a new one for 83mm wheels, 16T motor pulley, 36T wheel pulley because it seems to be a popular option. @EMC75, you can try the 2nd config and let us know how it works for you.

The two assemblies can be found at final_assemblies folder.

The only problem is because of the pulley cover design, dual mount is not possible with above truck. If you don't plan to use pulley cover and use dual rear then let me know I'll make snapin pulley that will also support dual rear.

They came out okay and some of that was my fault. I switched to petg and did not adjust my temp correctly but it's good enough to have a visual on how it will work.

I am am a little concerned on the mount holes that stick out if they could get hit by something. Just seems like a weak point. Also, getting the cover to slide over the mount might not work as well as attaching it against it. The mount that I printed was too thick in the design so it was difficult to test.

```
The mount holes are on the sides rather than facing the ground, so they likely won't hit anything if the bottom won't hit anything. I thought about that scenario but it actually looks pretty good in assembly. 

The mount is actually doing both: Attaching by sliding and attaching with screws. Extrusion printing tends to bloat the parts a bit and fitting might be difficult, but if you sand the motor mount a bit you could definitely slide it in. 

I know you said the parts didn't come out well, but could we see it? You could also pm me the pics. Thanks.

Here you go. I was messing with the parts a bit and broke some pieces off... 
I used some PETG that was supposed to be red but turned out to be pink :unamused:

When I cut out the mount in carbon I am sure it will fit a lot better. I only have 3mm carbon fiber but I think that should be strong enough.

Let me know if you need me to check anything else.

Some more pictures to see how it would fit.
It's difficult to get the cover over the motor pulley. Not sure how it will work with pla as it's not as flexible.

The wheel pulley is too big and I will be printing a 36T to match this.

What pulley are you going to use? My snapin pulley?

This pulley cover is considering snapin pulley. Pulley directly mounted on the wheel won't work. I'll have to design a diffeerent cover for that. What's your plan, use snapin(cut 7mm off the hangar) or use regular pulleys?

The motor mount is supposed to be 5mm(based off TB motor mount, since I trust it) and made with aluminum. The plastic cover should just slide in right from the side. If it is not hapenning right now, you can try to sand the edges a bit to reduce thickness.

I was going to use this one and I think it's pretty much the same as yours.

It looks like 5mm fits but I will probably have to print the cover with some additional support to make sure it will fit perfect.

His pulley is supposed to be joined to the flywheel using nuts and bolts, whereas mine(like enertion's pulley) will just snapin. Mine will use an additional bearing, some shims(2mm and 1mm) and cutting 7cm off the caliber trucks(like longhairedboy does)

Before you print again, let me know what you plan to use and I'll prepare the assembly for you accordingly. Give me the following specs.
1. Wheel dia
2. wheel pulley teeth count
3. motor pulley teeth count
4. Belt teeth.

Hi, in this very moment I negotiating price of CNC making motor clamp/motor mount in aluminium for caliber that @mishrasubhransu share. My setup consist of: blue caliber ver.1 trucks, enertion r-spec 2.0 6355 motor, 83mm abec clone wheels, 250mm HTD5M (15mm wide) belt, 16/48 teeth pulleys. Is there's something I should know before sending files to be made?

Yes, 3 main things. 
1. The 48T pulley is very big when compared to 83mm pulley(even 40mm might is pretty big for 83mm) 36/38 will be the best. If you go for 48T it might make the wheel pulley(and the belt) dangerously close to the ground.
2. The pulley and the pulley cover is meant for 12mm pulley, I'll have to modify files for you to use a 15mm pulley. Do you want me to work on it?
3. The clamp that goes on the caliber trucks is the one that you get from . So you might as well buy it from @torqueboards.  Moreover, the clamp doesn't have any threads, so you'll have to request the thread from the cnc place.

Thank you for answer. I already printed 36 teeth pulley, to try fitting to the wheel, but I am still considering bigger ratio (~3). 
Would be great if i could get pulley cover for 15mm belt, but of course motor mount is my main concern now. During my negotiations I am sending your files with annotation about threading clamping hole for m6 bolt (i also considered to remix clamp, to not rely on threading the hole but to make socket for nut at the end). Also, from pricing i get from one of places (for now only one cnc place gave me cost of material+work) i can get motor mount for one third of torque price (not including shipping that would be 40$ for me in Poland).

Nice nice!. Can we see the 3d printed 36T pulley? Also, are you using my snap-in wheel pulley or something else?

If you are not concerned about the the pulley cover, then the mount can be much smaller. That's because the cover version of the motor mount has to be a bit bigger than the wheel pulley.

The max number of teeth in wheel pulley for 83mm wheel should be 40(I use that), otherwise the pulley will be dangerously close to ground and might get damaged.

For test, I printed first pulley that I found on thingiverse [My print on thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/make:257798). 
If You are using 40T pulley with success i will recreate this in my board. 
Pulley cover would be nice addition and ill try to implement it at some point (for now im still waiting for European distribution of vesc+6355 bundle from enertion)

@mishrasubhransu Is Your snap wheel pulley (when printed) is strong enough to not crack along layers in place where in-wheel part ends during driving

EDIT: Today I spoke with guy that will be making parts on cnc, he said that he does not have access to 7075 aluminum alloy (that is stronger that normal alu, almost like steel) that torqueboars use. He is not sure that motor mount will be sturdy enough. He proposed to thicken this part to 8mm and making it from PA6 aluminum, and making clamp without changes to thickness from PA13 alu

Hi @mishrasubhransu,

Amazing work! I very recently joined this community, and it's great to see there are so many helpful people. I hope to be able to give back to the community someday :slight_smile:

I'm collecting parts to build my very first eskate board. I'm buying enertion's 36t 15t 12mm pulley kit, 83mm flywheels, and most likely caliber trucks.

I don't have a 3D printer myself, so I was thinking of looking this up on 3Dhubs.
I know the motor mount should be a stronger material (carbon fiber, aluminum, etc), but would 3D printed plastics be okay for the pulley cover?

Sorry for the noob questions.

You can find the files in folder named **SR_Caliber2_83mm_TB6355_40T_16T_56T(250mm)_15mm_partialpulleycover_Seawolf** at  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1q9GisJy4tHN1JiSlZubmVpaUk?usp=sharing.

The pulley will work great if you use nylon SLS(sylective laser sintering) 3D printing,_ else you just have to print out a part and check it out. 

Since you want to use 83mm wheel and also 40T wheel pulley, a full pulleycover is not possible, so I made a partial pulley cover.

I can make the part 8mm thick. Were you going for dual rear or just single rear?

EDIT: FIles not ready yet. I'll let you know when they are.

Now I want to give you a little bit back.

Since I'm building my own electric longboard, I also wanted to model every part of it, as far as it is possible for me.
In the last few weeks I tried to find a 3D model of the VESC to generate my own housing for it but with no success. So I just sat down and drew my own model with the data Benjamin Vedder put in hits github repository.

Here is the link to thingiverse, where you can download the part!

I think you should create this 66T pulley. Actually if you can also provide a 62T pulley as a 3D printable file (STL) it would really be great.  This is just roughly my CAD of it. Haven't tried making into an STL yet -- if you did it would be great.  66T HTD5m 20mm wide and 62 HTD5m 20mm width.

Does anyone have a model of the 2.4GHz remote that has the wheel and trigger?  This one...

![image|331x476](upload://3SWJi0DZ3sO2vWYReEJw2JfUPmX.jpg)

I would love to make another case that relocates the wheel potentiometer as a thumb trigger, that way the user could use a thumb wheel or trigger based on the channel used at the RX.  I started this a while back but I no longer have this remote, I gave it away to someone who had broken theirs.

I think @LukePL [modelled a very similar case](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/enclosure-for-the-mini-remote/18790/101?u=boostedbuilder) for this remote however it excludes the wheel.

There is also [this](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mini-remote-mod-hall-effect-sensor/13377/5?u=boostedbuilder) which is very interesting and seems to be what you want, however the case doesn't look to be very comfortable to hold.

Hey guys, I am working on a 110mm 70a PU sleeve option for the meepo boards, primarily targeted towards the AWD GT. I could really move a lot faster if anyone has a meepo sized (90mm) hub motor sat/step/solid file, or even better a model of a 90mm pu sleeve for meepo hubs. Thanks a ton!

Just wanted to ask if you still have these solidworks files available for the battery packs?!
Can not access without requesting access.

Wanted to play with it to see how I could adapt it to my needs... Thank you very much in advance.

Hey, I restructured a lot of the directories and purged a lot of the older files but I still have the original part(from agnius the creator of NESE) that I just added hinge to. PM me your email address and I'll share it with you. But know that this is a older design and @agniusm  has since upgraded them. You can find the files(look for google drive link) in NESE thread. Agnius was supposed to create a new thread with all the information in one place but not sure if he had the time to get to it yet.

OK so I have made these models myself with the part and a pair of calipers. They are as accurate as i can make them without original cad. If a dimension is included its probably cause i measured it, but that doesn't mean its the same as your part and i recommend checking any important dimensions before committing to making something based on any of these models.

That said, in no particular order, here we go . . .

FOCBOX - https://a360.co/2Jdm3Bs -This model has accurate heat sync if you ever want to make your own.
![FOCBOX%20v12|690x423](upload://2dSxPK9YdFq05SFDpd9K1vPJEbj.jpeg) 

FOCBOX UNITY - https://a360.co/2Ua0OTk - as accurate as i could get it inside without taking any screws out.
![Unity(Recieved)%20v13|690x423](upload://9WeTnWZefHo60qRpV0HddhGJ9ER.jpeg)

![BMS%20v5|690x423](upload://mMAfQk7hwsKzJwn8CVTvFNOMkYw.jpeg) 

Trampa Street Carver Deck - https://a360.co/2SLjigP - Unfortunately no holes but it is a "sheet metal" part so it does fold flat.
![TrampaFromDxf%20v11|690x423](upload://r2zF3gjut0ulD5C4Nn1siXrOdtG.jpeg) 

Trampa 90mm STICKIES - https://a360.co/2Jg96a1 - with 9.XXmm bearings
![Wheel%20v1|690x423](upload://gcqhQ6CWcsXhVg6qRfHHcz5LgQ8.jpeg) 

Trampa ULTIMATE Mini Spring TRUCKS - https://a360.co/2DU2HgI - lots of rads done by eye in this one so make sure to double check things before making motor mounts based off this.
![Trampa%20Street%20Carver%20v1|690x423](upload://ldDOLNYoCmMKzbxFqiiQ0XC8TEv.jpeg) 

StreetWing 6374 - https://a360.co/2IZV8dd - dont think they sell this motor any more but its the same as some from other vendors so ill post it anyways.

![samsungQ30%20-%204P%20v4|690x423](upload://u8tBTm8NbU1EhJL5IQ2J0W4wLHt.jpeg) 

Kaly Enclosure for 18650 12S-4P - https://a360.co/2VhPxFC - This one is rough as lots of dimensions are hard to get accurate measures for but I did my best.
![KalyEnclosure%20v3|690x423](upload://3fzB8oZVAYUpqqvzD2lq1BhA1Hq.jpeg) 

MR60 Male - https://a360.co/2JgqqM7

MR60 Female - https://a360.co/2IZdATp

XT60 Male - https://a360.co/2J0mdx0

XT90 Male - https://a360.co/2JhjfmU

I release these models with the intention of encouraging innovation and helping others plan their builds before parts arrive. @onloop @trampa @Kaly if you would prefer these not shared then let me know and i will remove them.

Honestly I just use the default settings. Usually make some effort to find reasonably correct material finishes, mostly from the ones included. Always run the renders on my local machine rather than the cloud. Wait till they look acceptable then save them. 

Noting fancy.

So does anyone have a link or file for 3D printing a riser incorporating MR60 connector?

Has anyone done a CAD for the 90mm Ghost wheels and the plastic/ nylon insert? If someone can develop an accurate drawing/model based off their own wheels then I'll take it to a high end wheel manufacturer in the US and get some wheels made up for all of us waiting on Enertion to send replacement wheels (cheap Chinese ones that will fall apart again anyway) for their Raptor.
