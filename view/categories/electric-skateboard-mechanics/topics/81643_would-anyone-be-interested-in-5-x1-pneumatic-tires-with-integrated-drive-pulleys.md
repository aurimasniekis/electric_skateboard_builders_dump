I bought a bunch of acetal delrin to make some 5x1 hubs with integrated drive pulleys for these tires.  I am wondering if anyone else would be interested in a set.  I am trying to get in contact with whoever makes the tires to see if I can get them cheaper in bulk so please let me know if you would like them.  I can do whatever pulley size you would like.

The hubs will be able to fit standard Caliber trucks,  I am currently in the process of drawing them up in solidworks.

I can sell them for $200 a set including shipping to the US.  I will update this post as soon as I finish machining the first set of hubs, but it will take much longer for me to get a sample set of tires since they will be shipping from Germany.
