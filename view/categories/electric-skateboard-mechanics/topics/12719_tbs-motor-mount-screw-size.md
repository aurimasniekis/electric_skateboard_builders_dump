Anyone know the size of the hex screws on TBs motor mounts? I've tried a bunch of stuff both imperial and metric but im finding it impossible to work on these things without stripping everything.

They're metric, which screws are you talking about. There's like 4 different screws on the mount.

The v4's, both the screws that mount the motor and the ones that mount the 2 pieces together. I got a second pair of mounts slightly used from someone on this forum and the screws attatching the 2 pieces seem to be different than the ones on my mounts...
