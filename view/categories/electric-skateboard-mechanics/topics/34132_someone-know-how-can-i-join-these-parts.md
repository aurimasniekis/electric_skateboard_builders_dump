Please provide a little more explanation next timeZ. You will have to solderthe wires to the connector or get new connectors and desolder the old ones.

Also, get a more powerful soldering iron. Esk8 uses large wires, and you need a more powerful iron to solder them.

Now that you added the second picture, there are definitely spare connectors on your motor leads. I knew it, haha! The supplier probably included them for convenience, and just plugged them on the motor wires so they didn't get lost

It looks like there are unsoldered connectors plugged into the ESC too.  Do those come out?

Pull on this gold connector. Does it come out?  If yes, there is going to be a female bullet connector inside the ESC housing.  If not, you need to solder wires to those fittings
