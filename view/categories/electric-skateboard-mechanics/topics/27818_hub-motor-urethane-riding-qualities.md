Hub motors are here to stay. Not because they are any better or superior than their comparable belt/pulley driven motors, but because it is irresistible to NOT want to stash your motors inside your wheels and make it look aesthetically pleasing. Stealth is cool. Uncluttered boards have sex appeal. Having fewer parts is also nice, as long as the parts that you keep perform well and are readily available and reflect a flexible/open system and not a closed/proprietary system. Most of the people on this site are here because they don't want to be boxed into ONE person's idea of what an electric skateboard should be, or only what ONE person wants to produce and distribute. In the "push" longboard market we stick to a couple of known standards (new school hole pattern, 608 bearings, .400" bearing spacings, 1" bushing diameters, 10-32 mounting hardware or equivalent, 3/8"-24 kingpins, 5/16"-24 axles), and the consumer can mix and match and upgrade parts from different vendors as he/she chooses. This is a beautiful thing.

If you trust ONE person/company to make these unilateral decisions for you, then you buy a complete. Rarely is every link a strong one, but as long as everything is "acceptable", you can ride around and be happy. Most people here aren't going to be happy with one vision, one way.

As this relates to wheels, my current plans are to support the community with a number of nice wheel options. My experience is that you want a LOT of top notch urethane as a percentage of volume when considering the harder hub/core/bearings inside of them. When I oversized my cores in the V1 Flywheel series, there were only a couple of wheel/hub combos that proved to be viable. When I evolved the wheel and hub designs to include more urethane, EVERY wheel got better. Here are a few pictures of the history of the Flywheel and related big wheels, and a comparison chart showing the depth of urethane as it bears to the size of the wheel and hub. Let me know if your experience is the same or different.

We learned a LOT about oversizing the hub with some the big wheels here ...

The 83mm OD x 78mm width started with a "Double Wide" Flywheel where I cut and glued two wheels with 4 bearings. Later I used a medium hub with 2 bearings, then a small hub, and then a narrower offset version ...

"So bad we never made it"

millions of 50mm skateboard wheels with really hard urethane formulas and similar urethane depths (10-12mm) have been sold to skaters across the globe and they love them, becasue they are better for certain things...  specifically tricks due to the light weight. 

Rolling resitance & other characterisitcs like "pop" also play a role in wheel choice for pro skaters.

How a wheel feels & what makes it good is **VERY SUBJECTIVE**


**ALSO: the application or the specific use case will always dictate the design constraints**

"Performance" is absolutely subjective, and depends largely on riding styles which progress and change over time. Most of what I've targeted was a high level of control at a high level of speed. This is because I love competition and raced in several skate-related disciplines. I've raced downhill in packs, single rider downhill for time and/or speed, Giant Slalom, Hybrid Slalom, Tight Slalom, Super-G in water drainage ditches, street luge, buttboarding, push races, LDP, etc. If I'm 100% honest, I've also raced downhill inline, and did some short-track speed skating and ice hockey to better understanding "blade" type wheels that take only radial loads instead of the non-radiused wheels that are needed for sideloads.

The great news for consumers is that if a wheel is great for racing, it's fantastic for carving and cruising and skating outside of competition. And they're getting the exact same wheels that are being used in racing. There are reasons that virtually no one races on wheels with huge cores and little urethane. They can't win. They can't hang in the turns, they can't handle imperfect track conditions, and they wear out quickly. So if someone looks at "performance" as the ability to out-race, out-maneuver, out-corner, and out-run the competition, I agree. 

I personally believe that the performance requirements for electric skateboards are very close to what racers want. You want to have control at speed. You can compensate for not having "fast" wheels by having more power, but it comes at a cost (draining the batteries prematurely). You can compensate for having components with less control by developing more skill, but when someone else has the skill AND the control, they're gonna win. Some racers are paid to ride a certain product, even if the performance is substandard. And they can even win on inferior equipment. But I don't want or expect my customers to have to overcome equipment deficiencies in the products that I market. I make products that I love so much that I can't wait for people to feel what I'm feeling. Not everything I've made are studs, but I've managed to avoid making very many duds. 

I think back to some of the cars in the late sixties and early seventies that had big powerful motors but objectively horrible braking and handling characteristics. The truth is that it's understandable that they were made (testosterone and all), but they are dangerous. Putting all that power into something that can't handle it is not a good idea. I need the full package.

We choose asphalt and concrete to be our medium. We choose wheels sizes that are less than 5" in diameter. And we choose to turn using lean-steer. Our wheels are our interface -our **_connection_** to our chosen medium. It is a critical choice. And since I'm basically choosing for a pretty large group of people, I'm going to make sure that they get smooth, fast, controlled, and long lasting wheels with lots urethane on them. And when, as, and IF I do some hub motors, they will be very tall wheels indeed.

Urethane depth really does have a significant impact on the ride quality.  I can notice a difference even between 90mm and 83mm Abec11 Flywheels at the same duro (75a, classic)

Side effect of lots of urethane... The wheels last forever.  The 75a Flywheels on my push setup are a decade old now, and still at 86mm after thousands of miles

Tell that to Usain bolt, do you think the guy with the silver medal should have gold instead because he had a better running style?

You were the world champion in speed racing because you got to the bottom faster. You performed better, your wheels/gear was probably better too, but that was not the method the judges used to award your prize.


Anyway, this is stupid, Performance can be both Subjective & Objective....

Objective performance can be measured and there can be a winner, Subjective will lead us to have stupid arguments.

They say that there are no stupid questions so here we go...... :slight_smile:
I never ride a longboard..... did try skateboard few times but that was it. Now I want to build my eboard of some sort and I can't understand why longboard wheels are shaped like they are? I belive 99% of videos that I saw was just riding straight with few not very hard turns. A big flat surface in longboard wheel = more friction and resistance, right?
So maybe they should look more like roller skate wheels or something in between? Please guys educate me ;)

First of all, there are a LOT of counter-intuitive realities in skateboard part design, and you just mentioned a BIG one. It's kind of funny, but some of the WORST ideas in skateboarding come from really smart AUTOMOBILE engineers. I think this because they don't differentiate from the lean-steer skateboard and the manual-steering cars, go-karts, and reverse trikes. They also tend not to understand that a gravity or push vehicle is grossly underpowered compared to a vehicle that weighs way more than the rider and has an awesome amount of power available to him, as well as a suspension system and the ability to countersteer.  BMW Carver anyone? Rubber radiused tires, huge metal cores with swing arm type steering on a heavy metal brick of a deck? No thanks ... no ultimate driving machine there.

Rubber and/or pneumatic tires can provide a tremendous amount of traction and control (Psychotiller's Six Shooters and Carve Board tires come to mind) but if you don't have a motor, you better have a chair lift and a steep hill around because they ain't no fun to push. At least the Carve Boards are like that. Only tried Six Shooters under power and me likey.

On (dry) pavement the urethane wheel can be magically fast and smooth and you can dial in the amount of traction and/or drift that you want. You can make fast wheels that stick like suction cups, and fast wheels that you can push sideways, but in either case you won't get greater "rolling resistance" with a wide wheel and/or wide contact patch. Just the opposite. Think of it this way. You're driving your car on grass, sand, and dirt roads. Do you take the "road bike" path and use tall, narrow, highly inflated tires on tall stiff rims to "minimize rolling resistance"?  Oh hell no. That's about the worst thing that you could do. You want soft, wide, underinflated tires that keep you from sinking into the medium. Skaters should treat the board like a dune buggy in that regard. From a dead stop, my board with SIX 83mm tall ultra-soft high rebound 74a Centrax that are 78mm wide each will out-roll a board with FOUR smaller wheels of the same urethane. As I said before - counter-intuitive. 99.9% of skaters don't know this, nor do they want to accept this. They will quote books and say things such as, "the smaller wheels will overcome the moment of inertia more readily and accelerate more quickly". And they would be dead wrong.

In the mid seventies we started adapting roller skate wheels into skateboard wheels. Narrow 52mm medium durometer wheels. They only had to be narrow for roller-skating because of the size of the human foot. Too wide and they'd rub. Skaters begrudgingly increased the height and width and softness and rebound of the wheels until it was clearly demonstrated to be a winning combo. On super smooth ramps and concrete, you want a harder smaller wheel in the same way that you want the balls in your bearings to be steel and not rubber. You give up on traction but then again, you don't need a lot of traction to land a trick or grind coping. That's a different medium altogether.

Given gobs of high rebound urethane on a steep asphalt road and you can roll at over 85mph without a motor and start thinking more about better aerodynamics to go even faster. There are good reasons that no one is using a narrow inline wheel on a skateboard, even for going straight. They suck. If you like speed, traction, and control, go big, wide, soft, and high rebound.

The innovators dilemma...
Much of what Chris postures about in a broad sense is discussed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma) by C. Christensen.
(It's a pretty good read I think, dated but timeless).
Clayton discusses the disruption of industry using historical models and attempts to formulate why some business makes it though disruption and some don't. 

[quote="onloop, post:11, topic:27818"]
Subjective & Objective....
[/quote]

As for subjective or objective, in the sciences we break stuff up in to two broad categories, [quantitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research) and qualitative. In the former we look for hard data things we can measure and repeat. In the later we might do a interview... If you get a big enough data pool  (n1 (sample size) doesn't mean a lot) both can be valid. It's just: I did this once and this happened so... doesn't mean much on it's own except for a persons experience. Maybe this one person has cred, and a mass of experience so it might have marketing appeal. But that's not science and we are blurring the two.

Ok, so two identical boards (same size, weight....) with different wheel sets and we let them go from the same hill at the same time...... which one will go more distance?

Well maybe this is the reason that you have mentioned but thats my point and doubt here. Maybe there should be new approach to this? I belive that there will be more and more people like me who never ride a skateboard or longboard and eboard is totally different thing. For most users it is a way of commuting and that is going to be the mainstream. The industy is where it is and its easier maybe to adapt existing solutions than come up with new ones or maybe it's a matter of scale at the moment?
This is my DIY thinking not based on any science and not even on riding a longboard once, so I'm a bit keyboard warrior here but just want to understand :D

Yes, electric skateboards have motors. And they have batteries. I'd rather have my motor taking small sips from my power source because I have very efficient wheels than taking huge gulps because of inefficient wheels, i.e. wheels with a lot of rolling resistance. What I'm saying is inflate your "normal", narrow car tires to the right level for better gas mileage on asphalt, but if your in a dune buggy, don't use highly inflated narrow tires. Skateboards are dune buggies. Ignore that analogy at your own risk.

What I'm saying as an approach is to do actual testing in real world conditions. Go to a downhill or street luge race and try to find hard narrow wheels without much rebound. Hit corners at speed on an electric skateboard and tell me how comfortable you feel on small hard narrow wheels. The difference is easily noticed.

And when the only difference between two boards is the wheels, and one board pulls away from the other from a dead stop AND has better traction and control and speed through the corners, which one do you want to ride? Better is better. It's not rocket science.

Gravity is simply a different type of motor, and bad wheels hurt performance whether the force is gravity or the force is a brushless DC outrunner motor or a hub motor or a different direct drive motor. Most electric skateboarders will not go as fast as downhillers, but downhillers know how to design boards that are stable at high speed which means that they are safer and more stable at "electric" speeds. And believe me when I tell you that there are plenty of electric skateboard builders out there that are not at all content to be slower than gravity boarders. It's like building cars that are beaten by a horse. A ONE horsepower horse. As we continue to go faster and faster, our wheels become increasingly important to us, and so are our trucks and bushings which are not getting a lot of attention right now. It's a system, and you are only as strong as your weakest link.

How about this?

**107mm 74a Abec11** Reflex thane, with a 63mm diameter hub for an **R-Spec Hub Motor,** would give 22mm of urethane depth.  That would result in such a smooth and plush ride. I suspect it would feel similar to how good a soft Abec11 90mm Flywheel feels (22.5mm urethane depth).  It would also cut down the weight (and cost) of the monstrous 107mm Flywheels

Best of both worlds. That's a collaboration product I would buy in a heartbeat

It's not so much that I have a bad taste from the automotive engineer, it's the **_abomination_** that he created, called a "next gen skateboard", and then peddled to the unwitting public using engineer-speak and his company's reputation as his marketing ploy. The board is a turd on wheels. Bad wheels at that. I've seen other who created these dual swing arm trucks and they were adamant about how they were able to keep their outside wheels in contact with the ground during a turn. They were doing all these desktop demos where a dollar bill slipped under their wheels was harder to pull out with their swing arms on. They never showed it compared to a normal truck, they never showed it under a proper load, they never showed it beating a different system, and they never showed it any "real world" conditions. It's so frustrating to listen to a staged "win". That whole concept was based on the idea that in a turn, most of the weight is transferred to the outside wheels as it is in a CAR. A car with a steering wheel, not a lean-steer vehicle. They were literally telling me that my outside wheels were experiencing as much or more force as my inside wheels. I asked them to explain how much force was on my outside wheels when I carved past them with both my outside wheels completely off the ground and they told me that I was just doing that to be a prick. Seriously, there was ZERO force on my outside wheels and they denied it was even happening.

I told that them that if you DON'T put more force on your inside wheels, you can't and won't turn in that direction. The simplest concept, but they had an agenda. To sell whatever they were making. 

I had a HUGE financial investment in the original Flywheel hubs and wheel molds. I desperately wanted big cores with small amounts of urethane to function at a high level. They looked awesome, like a car with crazy big rims. But it doesn't take genius to know what that tire feels like going over a pot hole. But even on smooth surfaces the big core and absence of unsupported urethane that could deform and stay in contact with the road meant poor traction. And OF COURSE we tried the cheap fix - to use super soft urethane in the hopes that it would be good enough. Nope. Not even close. We tried duros less than 70a, and marketed wheels in 72a. No amount of engineer-speak or marketing hype was going to make that wheel/hub ratio a viable high-performance contender. 

At the end of the day, I had to bite the bullet, create a big, expensive, multi-cavity hub tool, and create a set of wheel molds for every different size. I was racing, and I wanted to win more than I wanted to make money. One hopes he can do both. And as the style of riding changed from controlled slides in the turns to pre-braking better and then "railing" turns, we moved to even smaller cores, wider wheels with more square and flexible lips. 

It seems as if there is a big conversation of distraction that pulls away from looking at something at the heart of the matter here. We talk about windings and KV ratings and torque and "maintenance", as if those are the only things that matter. What about the ride? I've never been able to put a thin band of urethane around big hard hub and have it feel good or perform well. I still own the big hubs and can make any mold I want. If speed is all that is important to someone, he can put some big ass motors on his trucks, slip some rubber bands over them and be happy. He won't be able to stop as quickly which is problematic since speed is his thing, but safety isn't the number priority for speed demons. He'll be able to drift his back end well, especially on rough terrain because that back end be a-hoppin'. Tokyo drifters rejoice.

I am not anti-engineer. I am pro-reality.

Nicely said and thanks for the wheels. Been riding Abec 11's for years and they're the best f*cking thing I've put on my longboard. 

I agree that with more thane, you get better traction and a smoother ride, but I feel like I'm able to get up to speed faster with my 72mm Freerides vs. my 77mm with less work. Once up to speed, my 77mm go farther and have a smoother ride, but it seems to take more work to get there. Why so?

If I were to put my best guess forward here, the minimum wheel size for a 63mm hub motor would be about 111mm. In order for a fair amount of urethane to work efficiently, you have to bond it to a core of sorts - let's call that a "sleeve". The sleeve is structural, like the cardboard tube at the center of a roll of paper towels or TP. You don't want urethane that can be pried up and away from that structural sleeve or core. A "mechanical lock" is that ring with the holes in it that goes around the hub's (or sleeve's)  OD. It allows urethane to flow through it when the wheel is poured to provide an extra measure of protection should the chemical bond fail under a load. All of my wheels have cores (even the shortboard/street) wheels. All my cores are made in a material that provides and excellent chemical bond. All of my cores have one type of mechanical lock or another. Call these my "core values" :open_mouth: )

So, assuming that the wall thickness of the sleeve is 2mm (and that's on the thin side), we're essentially adding 4mm to the hub diameter making a 63mm hub motor into a 67mm hub. With an 111mm wheel as a starting point, you'd yield 22mm of urethane depth. That's a little less than a 90mm wheel on a 45mm core (22.5mm depth), less than the 97mm wheel (26.0mm depth), and way less than the 107mm wheel (31mm depth).

But here's the thing. You've heard me talk about the wheel-to-hub RATIO or the urethane-to-hub RATIO . Even though the depth of urethane may be a relatively big number, how does it relate to the size of the hub? Maybe 22mm of urethane depth feels nice on a 45mm hub but it may feel horrible on 90mm hub. When so much of wheel/hub combo is hub, it rides rough. Period. If it looks like you're riding on the rims, it's because you're riding on the rims. I added a Kegel and a 111mm wheel on 67mm hub motor/sleeve so you can see some numbers. My experience is that the higher the number is in the rightmost column, the smoother the ride. I'd be interested in hearing if anyone else's experience is different than mine. And last but not least, when I made my hubs narrower and allowed some unsupported urethane to deform and adapt to the road, life got better still. The hub in the first Flywheels went edge to edge. This is only desirable when we do 127mph and the urethane wants to pull away from the hub (seriously). We're not there yet.

I suggest an objective test. You need to actually time yourself getting up to speed. When I'm on the freeway in a 1667 VW bus doing 65mph with the widows open (no A/C), I feel as if I'm doing 100mph. Vibration, wind, suspension woes, motor noise ... it's scary. When I'm in the back of a limo doing 100mph, I don't even realize that we're over the speed limit unless I look outside tinted windows and see us passing everyone. And I'm trying to focus on my supermodel and her twin sister. And when guys on street decks try to bomb a hill, they SOUND like they're going fast and they do LOOK terrified, but speed-wise they're crawling by comparison.

One test I've done in the past was to take a board with four (4) 77mm Centrax in Lime 80a Reflex and compared it to another board with six (6) 83mm Centrax in 80a Lime Reflex. One guy puts a foot atop one board and I put a foot on the other. While holding onto each other add the other foot, start to roll, and let go. We'd get up some speed, then foot brake and stop. We'd change boards, and do it again. Whoever was riding the 6-wheeler with the bigger wheels would always pull away from the guy on 4 smaller wheels. And you have to set up the 6-wheeler so that the front four wheels are perfectly parallel or you'll build drag into the system. I heard a lot of people worried about the weight of big wheels. It is SO WORTH IT. Go on a diet if you want to lose a pound or two. High rebound urethane on  the pavement is a GOOD thing, and you almost can't have too much of THAT good thing.

In the end my main push decks have 77mm and 83mm wheels, so that pretty much says it all there in terms of what I ended up with. With the 72's I had to push constantly which in the end took more work. Perhaps it felt like more work for each push because I had an extra 5mm more before my foot hit the ground? My main test was always the bikers on my route. Off the starting line, I did better with the 72's, but the 77's allow me to keep up. If there's any downhill slope, there's no competition. The bigger wheels with more thane blow the smaller wheels with less any day. 

One of my friends told me once, "It's a lot more fun to go fast in a slow car than fast in a fast car."

I have to give you a HUGE high five for pointing something out that many/most people miss. When trying to perform a "scientific" experiment, you often want to "change only ONE thing" to better understand what caused the change in the results (if any). So someone might think that "only changing the wheels" is changing only one thing. Nope. You nailed it. You are also changing the ride height. And where the difference would be negligible let's say "aerodynamically", if you have to push that board around like a flamingo for long periods of time, you're going burn your quads faster on that tall board sooner.

One thing that drives me nuts about skaters, okay, human beings in general, is that they tend to like to do something the way that it's been done for years as if "there must be a really good reason for us always doing it that way". So many times we do the things we do purely because of the cost, the convenience, the availability, or because you're "safe" from ridicule if you do what everybody else is doing. For example, I think that we can all agree that electric skateboards and most all race boards are directional. There is a front and a back. They are different. Why do we put the same truck on the back as we do on the front? Does it really "not matter"? I think the answer is somewhere between "it's easier"  and "it's cheaper" and "we don't know any better" and "everyone else is doing it".  Argh.

We recently got our production sample 107mm SuperFly's and they came out just as expected. We've put in our initial order and that can take as long as 6 weeks to get them in our hot little hands.

Right now we're planning on only making the 107mm SuperFly but if there is a demand for the 76mm monster wide version, we can always put in a special order. We just can't afford to have a bunch of big, expensive wheels sitting on the shelf when we want to develop new and exciting products, such as the 83mm, 90mm, and 97mm SuperFly's!

Trust me, when they are available I won't be shy about letting everyone know.

On a side note, I'm a huge fan of your brand. I wont ride any other urethane wheels unless they're Abecs11 approved. So big ups to you man. Whoever shaman you paid to imbue magics onto your wheels needs a pay raise.

When i was looking for a longboard to start -and not have a clue about electric boards- i read some downhill riders use different angled trucks for their board, like 40 front 15 back, to turn from front and not lose back that easily.

 flywheels and superflys are awesome but is there any chance in the future they will come in colors other than bright green? Its really hard color to match to your average build unless your a green lover. I know its the signature color and all but its so harsh. :confounded: A lot of DIY builders like to take pride in the look of there boards and wheel color is a big part of that. Out of your past colors the transparent red bigzigs are really nice. 

Sorry for going off topic. :flushed: and I agree more urethane is better than less.

Here's an overlay of the following three wheels:

Classic Centerset 97mm Flywheel (52mm wide / 44mm contact patch)
Original Centerset 107mm Flywheel (76mm wide / 58mm contact patch)
New Offset 107mm SuperFly (64mm wide / 55mm contact patch)

Yes, the SuperFly is "trimmer" so that it is 100% compatible with all of the existing Flywheel pulley adapters. The other sized offset SuperFly's will also be compatible, but the profile of the wheel will be more like the BigZig HD's than the Classic Flywheels. They will be little narrower at 62mm wide.

I think you have that backwards. The Classic centerset version of the 107mm Flywheel is 76mm wide making it 38mm from the center of the hub to the inside edge of the wheel. The offset version is 26mm from the center of the hub to the inside edge of the wheel which is identical to the 83mm, 90mm, and 97mm Flywheels.

So ironically even though we called the 107mm wheel the "Electric Flywheel" is the one wheel that almost no one used for electric skateboards. It is too wide to the inside for most people to be able to use dual motors. Since most everyone wants/uses dual motors, we made it the same as the other Flywheels so that all existing wheel pulleys fit perfectly. Here's a 97mm Flywheel and a 107mm SuperFly "inside" the original 107mm Flywheel.

Im enjoying the conversation about wheel size, thickness of urethane and hubmotors. I agree that handling is very important for safety but also for riding comfort and fun. In another thread I mentioned I used a Boosted Board for a couple of days, and although it doesnt have amazing speed, acceleration and range compared to my DIY, it definitely was just as much fun to ride, simply because it handles so well and carves so nicely.

@ChrisChaput you mention that if you would ever develop hub motors, you'd go for a very large diameter wheel to have enough thane thickness to get the right handling. I personally have concerns this could negatively affect handling by increasing the ride height unless you compensate with a drop down deck. Wheel bite and weight are also increased. What do you think about that?

I mentioned one way that I would approach the challenges regarding hub motors. Here's how I'm looking at our current situation. "Our" meaning the electric skateboard building community. And I'm not going to speak on behalf of the guys oversees who are just trying to make a buck by selling some piece of junk that looks decent enough but falls apart or dies in a week or two. They build boards to make money. I want to make boards for skaters who can tell the difference between acceptable and exceptional.

To get a decent urethane-to-hub ratio you're going to have to one of two things, or a little of both. Increase the height of the wheel, decrease the size of the hub/motor, or both. Because of my (negative) experiences with metal cored wheels delaminating on the first run (Labeda 90mm Streetluge Wheels), I always want to make sure that my thane is securely fastened to a structural component such as a hub or a sleeve that provides a good chemical bond. A good PU material like Estaloc works great but I still use a mechanical lock as a fail-safe. If 2mm is the minimum wall thickness for the sleeve, you'd have to add 4mm to the hub motor diameter. If you used a 5065 motor then you'd be looking at a 54mm minimum hub diameter and a wheel that's at least 65mm wide, more if you want your axle-nut to be recessed. 

That's a pretty small motor and yet it's a pretty big hub. It's 9mm bigger diameter than the Flywheel hub so to get the same urethane depth you'd need a wheel that was 9mm taller. The 90mm wheel goes 99mm. But if you look at the fact that the 45mm hub is half of the 90mm wheel, then a 54mm hub would need a 108mm wheel to be half.

So that's just the math behind urethane depth, but are the current 5065 motors good enough to power your board with 99mm to 108mm wheels? If not, then what can we do?

1. Find a way to make small motors powerful enough
2. Put bigger hub motors into bigger wheels
3. Put bigger hub motors into the same sized wheels

I don't have as much confidence in making huge technological gains in "small motor" power. It will happen, I just don't know when and by how much. I know a bit about making nice big wheels, and I don't like not having enough urethane. What makes sense is to get the best small motor that you can find and make the wheel with the most urethane that you can handle. 

You can drop decks, drop trucks through the deck, and use rocker to lower your ride height. Big wheels are tricky. Wheel bite is a bitch. But I'll do whatever I can NOT to go back to steel wheels.

Ask the risk of sounding like a teacher here, "There are no stupid questions". And I just assumed that people would know what Rit is. My bad.

Rit is the brand name of a dye that is perhaps used mostly for fabrics but is also really good at coloring a lot of other objects. Their FAQ's on their website is https://www.ritdye.com/faq/

I used Rit Dye to turn some green No SkoolZ into amber colored "BertZ" that were used in the Lords of Dogtown movie (I played skater Russ Howell). I think that you boil water in a big pot (vat), add the dye, stir, and soak your wheels overnight. I'm sure that there will be some guys on here with more experience who can tell you of their results. Certainly turning light colors into darker colors would be easier than dark into light, but it doesn't appear to harm the wheels in any way so check it out.  (Just now realizing someone had also answered the question ... Doh!)

@ChrisChaput big thumbs up!! loved your input here, ride quality and carving grip were my biggest arguments against using hubs and Im glad to hear a professional talk about his development experience on urethane thickness & cores.

I have tested a lot of wheels and I completely share your view - the thicker the urethane ring, the more comfortable and grippy the ride, most noticeable on rough ground. sadly, for me, at around 90mm wheel size, boards start to look way too tanky and loose a lot of their natural beauty. :sunglasses:

when do we get back our 90mm 75A flywheels?!! :smile:

@ChrisChaput : Whatever your motor diameter is, a bigger urethane sleeve will always impact your gearing (e.g. 0.7:1 instead of 0.9:1), putting even more strain on your system and making it more inefficient. You would need to make your motor produce more torque for compensation and we know that there is a square relation between torque and efficiency. 
Your motor would produce more heat than you could ever dissipate. Heat = inefficiency.
In consequence a skateboard hub motor always wants the thinnest urethane ring possible, no matter of motor size. Adding more urethane is the last thing you want to do, if you don't want a steep drop in performance.
In consequence the hub motor urethane tire will never perform as good as a proper urethane wheel, especially on rough roads this is a big issue. Hubs are made for relatively smooth roads. The reason why hubs on bikes work, is the weight of the motor. Big and heavy stator with lots of copper in it + a lot of poles.
Have you ever lifted a 1000W bike hub motor? Same output power as a small 500gr outrunner but 5KG in weight. Unfortunately we can't squeeze such a heavy motor into a skateboard wheel, nor would we like to carry it. 
There is no solution for thick urethane on hubs.

The whole point of the newer (narrower) 107mm SuperFly is that you CAN put them on just about any board that fits an 83mm, 90mm, or 97mm Flywheel. If you don't design an idler pulley or a belt housing correctly, the increased diameter of a 107mm wheel could create some clearance issues, but the 107mm Superfly is narrow enough (on the inside edge) to fit just about anything where the really wide original 107mm Centerset Flywheel wouldn't.

Carvon v3's and 4's aren't in the wheel. They are Direct drive. There are no limitations to the motor diameter they can use in relation to the urethane. The wheels sit next to the motor. What you just outlined though is the absolute reason why hubmotors arent ever going to be an equal contender to belt driven setups. They may work, but they don't work well.

Neither the 13mm depth nor the 16mm depth will run smoothly. An 83mm Flywheel on a 45mm hub has 19mm of urethane depth and most people are upgrading to 90mm or 97mm wheels to get even more. And since just about every hub motor you'd consider using is 50mm or more, and that you'd want to "sleeve" the urethane which adds even more to the hub diameter, what you're proposing will always ride way rougher than a 76mm Flywheel. Not good.

".   super smooth when going through road cracks and imperfections ..."

Super smooth COMPARED TO WHAT?  If you set your expectations super, super low or only compare the feeling to other hub motor wheels or to smaller China clone urethane wheels, then perhaps you can exceed expectations. 

And this ridiculous notion that nice, smooth, fast wheels that feel great, stay in control, last a long time, and inspire confidence while riding are only good for competitive downhill or street luge is just plain ignorant. Those are EXACTLY the qualities that just about EVERY longboard skateboard, motorized or not, is looking for in a wheel. If it's great for racing and you can attach a pulley to it, it's more than likely great for electric skateboards. But the opposite doesn't follow. If a wheel sucks for racing, why would one think that it's great for electric skateboards? Tolerable, maybe. Great ... not a chance in hell. If huge rims and a small amount of rubber was great for racing cars, you'd see dragsters and funny cars and Formulas One cars and Indy cars and Stock Cars and go karts using huge rims and a little rubber. None of them do. 

Why would sticking a huge hard object in the middle of a skateboard wheel make the wheel better, and how could that wheel feel better?  I suppose if you simply deny objective reality, deny science, deny physics, and deny common sense, then putting a thin band urethane around a relatively huge hard object feels smoother/better than a generous amount of urethane around a significantly smaller object.

Designing products for other people means weighing the pros and cons and making choices, many of of which include compromises. Rarely is it the case that you can have your cake and eat it too. You try to find a balance and mitigate the downside to any tough choice that you have to make on behalf of your customers. You have made the choice to use hub motors. A fair number of people on the planet are going to be totally okay with that choice. But let's not pretend that "hub motors" are the perfect choice, or the only high tech choice, or the best choice, or a choice that comes without any baggage. Your choice is acceptable to many. Be happy. Work it. Sell it. 

Your choice isn't acceptable to me. I require more of a wheel. I'm willing to live with a slightly less efficient transmission of power and I'm fine with having motors that live outside of a wheel. I don't pretend that mine is a perfect choice, bit I'm more than willing to work within it. I want to be able to have a choice of a large number of wheel diameters, wheel widths, urethane depths, and pulley sizes so that I can dial in the amount of torque and top speed and maneuverability in handling different conditions, on the road and off. Belts and pulleys have worked great for me and I think that there is still a lot of room for improvement. And just because someone sticks a motor in a hub and claims that he is king of the road doesn't suddenly mean that belts and pulleys are antiquated or low tech dinosaurs. That notion is both dismissive and condescending.

I know what smooth is and isn't. And just because my idea of a great wheel doesn't align itself with your marketing strategy doesn't mean that my decades of experience in wheel design is somehow suddenly invalid or limited only to downhill racing. Take your product to market. Be happy. Let others pursue their happiness doing their boards their way. Full disclosure ... on the record ... my shit stinks.

It's not a good comparison to compare car wheels to skateboard wheels. You're arguing that thicker wheels are better on skateboard because they're better on a car, but like @onloop said, that's not necessarily true.

Since skateboard wheels act as suspension to make the ride "smooth" they have to be thick. However, car wheels have suspension on them that helps them maintain contact with the road when they hit bumps. Skateboards do not. So making that comparison between cars and skateboards isn't really valid, for reasons that you noted earlier when you talked about the problems the BMW skateboard had.

If you place the motor to the side of the wheel, ground clearance is the big issue. You would want the motor to be as big as possible in reference to the wheel diameter anyway. The same efficiency issue applies. The only advantage is better cooling of the inefficient, potentially overheating motor.
Again: limited to smooth and even surfaces.
People do get impacts on their regular hangers already.  This is why I don't believe to much in the concept of placing the motor to the side of the wheel. If the motor is outside the wheel, you can use a belt drive and place the motor in a much better position + have the benefits of gearing. I don't have any issues with the belts (15mm wide). Two years of usage without any service of the belt drive. A quality, premium belt lasts very very long.

It is noted air inflated car tyres act as a slight dampening over road cracks buts it's like nothing to the car, but I can feel it. I should not be butting in. It's true there are fast cars with big rims and rubber band wheel thickness, but much thought has gone into consideration why a car gets the tyres and rims they get.

I can see where this discussion is going. The decision to make wheels that are good enough and wheels above good enough. This comparison is like those Buzzed Feed food videos where 3 guys go to 3 selectively chosen food places at 3 price points base on one topic be it eggs, burritos, or pasta. The choice is purely subjective. The topic is "Hub Motor & Urethane Riding Qualities." Riding quality is subjective from person to person. Leaving aside the many technicalities of a street tyre and race tyre or durometer of urethane wheels.

I cannot attest to the urethane quality of Onloop's products because I do not have a set and do not know who makes them. With ABEC11 I can because I kind of know who pours them from online forums discussing which manufacturer pours for the longboard wheel companies. Even though, I would still want the best wheels I can afford. I'm already biased for ABEC11's because they got their urethane formulation the right characteristics

While the point you make about ground clearance is valid, during actual use I havent seen this be a real problem. Between my two Carvon boards over the last year and hundreds of miles Ive never sustained any substantial damage to the rotors, just little nicks. Also note that the rotors have always had a protective(replaceable) metal sleeve over them.  The newest version adds a second urathane layer on top of the steel sleeve for additional rotor protection.

Well, using big wheels in reference to the motor diameter gives you less gearing. You ride at e.g. 0.7:1 instead of a 1:1. In consequence you loose efficiency. Direct drives want to be as close as possible to a 1:1 ratio. Placing the motor on the side of the wheel doesn't help to avoid the gearing matter. 
Thick urethane and direct drives (hub/side to wheel) contradict each other. 
You will get your board rolling, don't get me wrong. Still it's a highly inefficient way to power your board.
Heat is the consequence. So you end up using two motors instead of one properly geared motor.
A geared single drive will outperform a twin hub and will still be under less strain. One ESC, one motor, simply cheaper and more robust + you have the comfort of riding on thick urethane or pneumatics.

@chaka @JohnnyMeduse 

Just so everyone's aware, i will be offering my hair for Premium esk8 builders and components experts to use in their boards and board components if you guys are interested in licensing the use of it. I can mail you samples first of course.  

Also i have NOT licensed my hair to anyone in the wheel industry, so if they are making premium claims they are false ones! only thane that has one small strand of my hair cast into the wheel itself is premium. 

So basically no one has premium wheels yet. YET. Sorry downhill community, none of the expensive bad ass high performing wheels you have been using this whole time were premium. 

I'm in talks with Orangutan about premium 85mm wheels that not only feature a strand of hair but also a speck of beard which should improve performance by as much as 300 megadanders.

Dude, you quoted my post perfectly. Where do I say that "thicker wheels are better on skateboard _because_ they're better on a car"? I don't say that, and I wouldn't. What I'm saying is that race car drivers use what works for racing cars, and if huge rims and tiny tires worked, they'd be using them. They don't. Similarly, if huge hubs and tiny bands of urethane worked on skateboards, THAT is what we'd be using. We don't. And there are reasons why huge hubs and tiny bands of urethane works so poorly on skateboards. And I don't employ wishful or magical thinking that if the giant mass that you're sticking into a tiny band of urethane happens to be a hub motor, that somehow THAT makes it feel good or ride smoothly.

We have the choice to design a skateboard wheel that doesn't suffer from having too little urethane. There are several good ways to supply power to those good wheels. Yes, there are some downsides to using belts and pulleys and having motors that live outside of a wheel. But I'd rather work on mitigating those issues than having to deal with the issues that you're faced with when you choose to stick big motors inside the drive wheels. At this stage of electric skateboard development, I think of choosing hub motors as "painting myself into a corner" where I'm trying to solve a problem that I unnecessarily created for myself. That could change over time. Right now I see a much brighter future with all of the options that are available with either a belt/pulley system or direct drive systems where the wheels remain whole.

There are trade-offs either way. Choose whatever path you want.

[/quote]

We are bound by a common language here, and we are accountable for the words that that we use. When you say that the "ONLY" advantage a direct drive system that isn't a hub motor is "better cooling", that simply isn't true. 

The ability to use a whole skateboard wheel which is designed to be a skateboard wheel is a HUGE advantage.
The ability to change that wheel quickly and easily with any of the other wheels on the board is an advantage.
The ability to change the size (diameter and/or width) of that wheel is an advantage.

You also stated that "the LAST thing" you'd want to do is to add urethane to a hub motor. I disagree. It's the first thing that I'd try, and if it didn't work, I'd rule it out. I think that encasing a hub motor in urethane is going to get hot whether it's a little urethane or a lot of urethane. I think the bigger problem is that you're increasing the diameter of the wheel which has the effect of reducing torque, when torque is already an issue for hub motors. At some point, you're going to exceed that practical limit of a wheel size for the average rider. But until you KNOW what that limit is, the least you could do is try a lot of urethane and see how it works. I think of adding more urethane as an approach, not as a bona fide all-encompassing solution.

That is why the last thing you want to do is adding more urethane. You gain ride comfort, while your motor struggles more and more. In consequence you need two motors and two ESCs to compensate the lack of torque. Wheel size is gearing in the wrong direction. From the point of view of a hub motor, big wheel diameters are painful to deal with.

I'm not sure that I understand the question. Do you want me to chuck up some Flywheels on a lathe and cut out most of the core so that it will fit over a hub motor? Do you want me to tool up for some plastic injection molded sleeves that fit hub motors and then pour urethane on those sleeves? Is there a known perfect size and universally agreed upon hub motor size so that someone wouldn't make a sleeve that is worthless in six months or a year?

Do you want to pour soft urethane tubes with no structural support of any kind? From a liability standpoint, that is what I'm least likely to want to do. Try doing 60mph on a Labeda 90mm street luge wheel with the aluminum core and feel how awesome it is to have the wheel delam in the first turn. Epic Fail. And just so you don't think that I'm making stuff up NOW to try and prove a point, here's a post of mine from 2011.

Labeda has a history of taking whatever roller skate hub they have laying around and convincing people to stick it in a skateboard wheel and see what happens. The customer becomes the tester. Some customers just completely blew right through the "foam" cores that can only handle the radial loads of an inline skate. Oopsy. Then there's the tall inline core with the exposed spokes. Oopsy. I'm not trying to be your dad here, but I think that I can save some of you the trouble of having to re-invent the bad wheel.

Many of us have discussed the problems with low torque and hub motors years ago. Mainly just an issue on a single hub drive. With big 12 pole stators you can generate plenty of torque with a dual hub setup to have a fun and fast board. Double the stator poles and you get even more torque but there are limits and efficiencies here when dealing with the relatively small motors used in electric skateboards. You do still need a huge pack to have consistent power. No sense using huge motors if you don't have the discharge capacity to run them long term.

It's easy to cherry pick an image of a "fast car" that uses bigger than normal rims. When you look at real race cars in the real world (like the ones I mentioned), here are results of THAT search. I don't need to cherry pick an "exception to the rule" image to defend a claim. 

I believe "Face Skate" wheels were used on the fastest official downhill run (over 85mph) in Quebec. Not Venom. That is a house core that Venom uses with their own spiffy core name. You could use it an Enertion wheel if you wanted. So could anyone for that matter. But you won't be able to pour Abec 11's Classic or Reflex urethane in it. Those are proprietary formulas and I'm not sharing outside of a co-branding relationship.

You and I know both know that pneumatic tire are very different than poured urethane when it comes to keeping the wheels on the rims. And we both know how to solve the issue of inserting and removing bearings easily.

The bottom line is that I really liked riding your wheels and want to put a LOT more time on them and really put them through their paces. I really like the smaller size as a good "tweener" fom street to full on off-road. 

The only problem is that I need more of your wheels ... hint hint ... and you're going need to heal and get some SuperFly's ...

I think that we mostly agree on more points than we disagree on hub motors. If we only talk about hub motors having less torque, then that theory would hold that a board with hub motors would choke off the line but then have a higher top speed. It seems that when using a couple of big motors with more poles, you can get all the speed off the the line that you need. And you get a high top speed. But skateboarding isn't a drag race. Many (most?) of us are in it for the long haul. How much energy was lost trying to get that thing up to speed? How many times will you be able to "win the drag race" before sagging occurs due to the "always high" gear that you're running? And what about with heavier riders? There's a pretty high correlation of fat wallets and heavier riders. Kids tend not to have enough money for a high performance machine. And what about hills? Heavy guys on hills? That can be a real problem if you don't live in Kansas (flat state). 

What I'm saying is that the THEORY of hub motors is that you'd go slow off the line, but the reality can be very different. And what is the price you pay for getting good acceleration from hub motors? Big heat and small range, especially on hills. Some people are going to be okay with that. But what I'm NEVER okay with is a board that feels rough and rides poorly. I have experienced "URETHANE NIRVANA" and it's really hard to go back to "Urethane Starvation" and be okay with it. If I were FORCED to use hub motors, I'd work on solving the issues with heat and torque and use more urethane.

Do you not want to make a mold for a core that fits a specific hub motor and pour urethane around it? (even if the cost of the mold is covered and I guarantee a min number bought over the coming years?)

We can't all agree on whether hubs or belts are better, it is a personal preference, but shouldn't someone that knows how to make good wheels be the one making hub motor wheels, since we're already at that thin urethane dis-advantage?

Looking at that picture I was wondering if anyone has tried a half in half out hub motor? Meaning the motor is long and narrow and extends out past the edge of the wheel to the truck. That might be a way to reduce heat and keep the inner diameter small. Just an idea.

The V2's had the motor part way into a 90mm wheel yet preserved the entire outside portion of the wheel. The V3's preserve the entire wheel. A 90mm wheel without any structure (core) bonded or attached to it has at MOST 13.5mm of urethane depth when using a 63mm hub motor. Next to it is a 107mm SuperFly. Got thane?

Making a plastic injection molding tool that creates a hard PU sleeve is an expensive proposition. When you have a very small hub you can make an 8 cavity tool or even a 16 cavity tool and then produce hundreds of thousands of wheels that use that hub. With a large hub such as the Flywheel you're going to want at least a 4 cavity tool which is pretty damn expensive at that size. The original 50mm hub and 70mm hub come from single cavity tools. Making a tool for a 63mm to 67mm sleeve could be pricey. Making a set of wheels molds is also expensive ... about $10,000 if you do it in the US. It would probably be at least $20,000 to perform the "experiment", and that's for ONE motor size with ONE wheel size on it. 

Just making a urethane tube instead of a real wheel is more cost effective, and we already have someone doing that. I'm in no hurry to jump in and spend a lot of money right now, when I believe that real wheels are the way to go. But if you have unlimited amounts of money and choose some sizes, I'd do it.

I appreciate you want an enjoyable ride, we all do! 

**You have a tough challenge ahead, the masses just aren't listening to your rhetoric!**

The blink campaign is a great example; $1.5million dollars worth of people this year didn't seem to care about ride quality or performance, let alone the **micro advantages** you claim are gained from thickness ratios & secret urethane formulas....

The twats on shark tank clearly have no idea what you're talking about either, or maybe like most don't understand or believe urethane thickness plays a key role. The sharks valued inboard at $25 million! Inboard has just 7-8mm urethane? and can't really climb hills!...  **are you beating a dead horse?**

According to your [scientifc scale of wheel ride quality](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/0/b044fe742052171b6a815caa834cc50084797690.JPG) this setup would be rated lower than your lowest possible rating which is **"So bad we never made it"**

## When it comes to performance & speed, world record results are achieved when using less urethane, not more!

## EXAMPLE #1

**The worlds fastest downhill skateboard** Kyle Wester, speed record of 89.41mph, uses[ Road Rider Shred Mags 73mm wheels](https://www.nhsfunfactory.com/shred-mags-73mm-team-78a-road-rider-skateboard-wheels) with **Just 16.5mm of urethane**. 

_Interestingly these wheels are actually made in china, [learn more here](https://www.silverfishlongboarding.com/forum/longboarding-skateboard-manufacturers/209432-road-rider-34.html)_

Chris, your expert opinion rates the worlds fastest wheel as "Not too bad" -  Just 1mm less urethane and your rating drops to "Feels Harsh, Rides Poorly, Limited Appeal" 

**>>So why does Kyle Wester use it to set records?**

> **This is what road rider say about wheel performance:**
> _The larger core adds to the performance by supporting the wheel and maintaining it’s shape under serious high speed and weight loads. This helps both maintain exit speed, and straight-line acceleration._

I don't disagree that more urethane is a nice feature for some, don't forget that skateboard have 4 or more wheels rolling on the road absorbing shock & vibrations, [that's why I offer quality, US made, 90mm wheels standard on the Raptor 2!](http://www.enertionboards.com/raptor-2-direct-drive-electric-skateboard/)

Let's just be real with each other, Overall, Urethane thickness is not the most important thing needed to make an electric skateboard nice to ride, there is so much more to it. It's not the year 2000 anymore & esk8 folk ain't just rolling down hills in leather race suits trying to shave milliseconds off their best time to win a shiny medal.

I not sure what @onloop is trying to argue here. That thinner urathane has a smoother ride and more grip than thicker urathane? 

Or people who buy complete boards don't care about the benefits of thicker thane? Seems like the second. 

Also comparing to cars is non sense as they have suspension. But since that nugget is now in the conversation I will put some thoughts in the hat. The trend to thinner rubber for road cars is that it looks better, for sports cars it is also so you can have larger brakes. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa0E-9v5Iqs

If you take your regular car in put huge rims on with thin rubber you will get a noticeably harsher ride and be more prone to flat tires. People do it anyway as the benefit of the look out ways the downside of ride quality. 

As for purpose made race cars they often have thicker rubber, like formula series cars, trophy trucks, drag cars. 

When maximum grip is needed, huge rubber. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9L3bllEbm4

Though I still think there is thin correlation between cars rubber and skateboard urethane. 

Lastly I will put this here for pure entertainment value.

[/quote]

Just had the "pleasure" to ride such a product on relatively smooth tarmac.
My feet are still numb.... The deck is stiff like a plank and the wheels are hard like a rock. If you have never ridden a board before, you might find that acceptable. This must be how skateboards feel like...
In this case it was really the first board the guy owned.
I gave the guy my board for 15 minutes and you could see how disappointed he was about his plank after just 15minutes of riding a high performance board.

I was really shocked by the performance. The product seams to be purely designed to look stylish when you carry it around the campus and this is what sells on the internet. If people would buy their equipment in a shop, comparing different models, that thing would still sit on the shelf. 

With regards to race cars: Nice on the track, useless for every day usage. 
Setting a record in a 5-10 minute ride doesn't require ride comfort at all.
If you want to win a race, you are prepared to suffer.
I would not want to use a car, being set up like a race car. 
There is a reason why regular cars are different to race cars. 
Big alloy rims with thin tires do not offer the best comfort. It's all about style, trying to indicating performance (of the usually male driver). A show off feature....
A car has the big advantage of having a suspension system that can swallow most of the discomfort
those wheels produce. A skateboard doesn't have such a feature. If you combine that with a stiff deck you get a board potentially causing medical issues sooner than later. 

From a sales point of view I can understand hubs, don't get me wrong! 
We thrash our boards down shitty roads, down the trails and through the parks. 
With a board I can choose different paths than I do when driving my car through the rush hour. 
In consequence I set it up for the task. Horses for courses...
We have plenty of cobble stone over here, tarmac that suffered from winter etc.

If you go back and read my last post on the "car" analogy, you'll see that we agree. Racers use what wins races. Period. They don't get "style" points for the size of their rims. The point is, when performance matters, you use what performs. Similarly, racers in downhill and street luge and slalom skateboarding have all found that having a lot of urethane on wheels  works. Larger hubs are used sparingly as they tend to suppress the amount that a wheel can deform and contact the asphalt. You can have a super wide contact patch but if the wheel is on edge (as it tends to be because of the lean-steer nature of a skateboard when cornering), it can't provide very good traction. Cars are also trying to maximize the amount of contact and down-force on its wheels, and the more power that you provide your wheels with, the more important it is to provide traction. That's true both for acceleration and deceleration. I seems as if most race cars have figured out how to effectively cool their brakes so I'm not sure why the "bigger rims / bigger brakes" approach provides much value. In other words, if the tire is like ice, why do you need a better brake when it slips so much that can't stop a car? 

Unlike the big rims in low profile tires, hub motors "free-roll" more and provide less braking so you can't put "less braking" as a con to having high profile skateboard wheels. Since you can have a lot of urethane with EITHER a direct drive system (Carvon) or belt/pulley/gear reduction systems, I'd say that's a PRO.

I see.... I see... How much torque per speed you think, it will be able to produce. Because I'm also looking in a different technique to provide much more speed per torque than supra conductor.. I thinking, that if I coated teflon over regular regular wheel or even hubs, I could reduce the friction coefficient by at least 5 torque per speed which should be more than enough to propulse me over the 11 torque per speed require for sonic speed...

[/quote]

Not always, and I know this is nothing new to you:

In Downhill these days, almost all races are won on cored wheels with less urethane depth.

At Maryhill, for example, some might argue that an 80mm Kegel (cored wheel / less urethane depth) is a better choice than 83mm Centrax (larger wheel with way more urethane). Less urethane depth can equal greater roll-speed, and a harder / wider core supporting the lips can equal more traction. Maryhill likes roll-speed and traction.

More technical courses (that require sliding / pre-drifting) are also almost always won now on cored wheels with less urethane depth. But for different reasons: Smaller wheels tend to me more desirable for accelerating and decelerating. So lets compare a couple: Take a 75mm Big Zig HD (36mm wide core X 59mm wide core) versus a Venom 76mm Cannibal (46mm wide core X 62mm wide wheel). Big Zig core covers 61% of the width of the wheel. Cannibal core covers 74% of the width of the wheel. Some might suggest because the lips are supported more on the Cannibals, they pre-drift more predictably. They also might offer greater traction around corners, and slow down quicker, due to less deformation (more leverage) for both. 

The above completely leaves out lots of other factors (core diameter, lip shape, durometer, formula, etc. etc.), and less thane depth is always going to equal a rougher ride. But winning races isn't about comfort. Traction going around a corner is different than traction starting from a stop and going in a straight line. It all goes back to trade-offs based on the course. Drag wheels don't win Indy races and visa versa.

As for Electric Skateboards, we all want different things. For me hub-motors will never be an option, for many logical reasons, but that doesn't make them wrong.

If all you care about is how something looks (for example), and you think hub motors look better, they're for you. Put it on your wall and be happy.  Comes down to what you care / know about... and what you will never know won't hurt you. 

If you just stand there pressing a button barely turning, you'll never appreciate the nuances of wheels.

Keeping you fillings in is another story...

As a skateboard builder you should make sure you tighten your nutz. Maybe if you spent more time building eboards, instead of playing shop, you would have more experience? 😘


The Raptor 2 has more than 19mm urethane on the outside, more urethane than the world's fastest wheels, dampening ain't a problem.

I guess that is the real difference between a builder and a marketing "guru", working in my shop does feel a lot like play! I am sure you would be miserable, manual labor is beneath you right ;). Please don't let me stop you from expressing your contempt for those who are passionate about building boards and sharing information.

Back to the topic of ride quality. Please explain how your hub motors have a superior rider comfort when compared to a quality longboard wheel, that is what you are trying to say isn't it?

My 3-year-old does this kinda shite at the dinner table;

**I say:** "how would you know, you have never tried one?"

**This thread is so ridiculous, What I do love about this topic, however, is that hub motor critics are no longer trying to dismiss my claims about hub motor performance!. It's hard to argue against video evidence.**

...... So now whats left to bitch & complain about? Ok, let's talk about the extremely subjective topic of "comfort" on a product that none of you have even ridden.... haha...  just like 3yr olds with invalid arguments





----------


----------

**In summary, It's all relative, each system has advantages & disadvantages!**

## Here is what we know to be true

If you want to go really fast you actually don't need lots of urethane or extra large wheel diameters or high urethane to hub ratio. Proven.


##Here is what we need to test further
If you want greater vibrations dampening & comfort increase urethane to core ratio. What is the optimal ratio? maybe somewhere around 30-50% - Not Proven.

The main thing we should take away from this is the fact that the evolve and boosted are using much smaller motors and are running factory settings. The evolve still proved to be similar in performance off the line. Imagine what it would have looked like if the evolve had the same size motors as the raptor.

Possibly, but he has already shown his stator and it is much larger than what we see in a 50mm motor.  So it isn't likely that he actually has 19mm of thane.

It is hard to tell from the pic, but it looks like a locating bead on either side of the wheel is 19... it certainly looks to be deflecting from the caliper more than the outside of the wheel that suggests it does not have equal mass.
I am surprised no one has mentioned the recent Carvon 4wd, two hub motors on one end and duel drive belt system at the other? Wonder why that was?

When I was looking at drive trains for my build I looked in hub motors. The the fact that the urethane choices for hub motors are so limited was a real deal breaker. You just can't over look the advantages of standardized parts. When my current wheels on my belt drive are shot I'll have a nice choice of replacement wheels from reliable producers. When my motor blows up I'll have just as many choices. I have my doubts about hub motors, and availability good replacement urethane. If hub motors get standardize I'll think about it.

Im also trying to wrap my head around the math here. If your wheels are 90mm in diameter and 39.2mm of that is Urethane then your motors are 50mm in diameter right? U said you are using bigger motors though so are you just refering to the stator length being larger or is there another 13mm of motor hiding somewhere?

I'm not sure your table is statistically relevant. You have only used 5 riders cherry picked out of 1-13 rank over two years. That could be as many as 26 skaters in your supplied ranking ? I would be more correct in stating (If your ranking and details supplied are correct) that 9 out of 26 skaters used a average wheel size of 74.2mm. Thane duro of 79 and a contact patch of 64.3mm... 
Kind of leaves you thinking about the other 17 skaters?

That wouldn't make for a very entertaining bait, duck, and comeback would it?

I'm talking to somebody about getting some 75a 85mm kegels made. I'm all about stickyness and comfort on an attractive looking wheel. 

I rode on evolve's wheels and i think they got it right on those for general purpose eskating. By general purpose i mean everything from casual cruising and commuting to stock street racing. Literally the only thing that sucks about Evolve's boards is their battery packs. And some people don't like the remote but i'm strictly speaking of the board. The smaller motors are perfect for the application and i totally get why @chaka went with similar ones. 

I've ridden several ABECs and i prefer the softer ones but not the larger ones, i like my wheels in the 80-90mm range as any larger and i feel like too much leverage is being put on the motor. Any smaller and i start to loose wheel pulley options. I'm running 80mm kegels on my daily right now with a 16/32 pulley ratio and its goddamned perfect. I think on 85s with a softer durometer and a slight adjustment to the ratio and it would float like a caddilac and still sting like a beamer, to continue the car comparisons. 

But then what do i like on my truck?

Yeah, it is amazing how much power those little motors can lay down when they have enough cells to power them. I have been telling you all for years, power starts at the battery pack. At least Jason is humble enough to follow our lead and use a few extra cells. Still, 40 cells will never out perform a 60 cell pack. At 60 cells we have 50% more power than a competing board with only 40 cells. It is also the reason why we can climb a 15% grade at 30 mph.  

Another aspect we have not discussed is weight distribution and why I think dual rear drives and hub motors are purely an aesthetic choice. We need our boards to be balanced if we want them to be predictable while going through a high speed turn. Hypothetically speaking, take a group of downhill racers and tell them they need to add 4 lbs of weight to their board. Do think they would strap all the weight to the tail end of the board?

I second that. pack placement and weight distribution is critical. The pack is the heaviest single component in the board so being able to position it to offset the weight of the motors is also critical. You should be able to balance the entire board over your forearm at the center point length wise. 

 i prefer rwd over ddd because if the feel of it, not aesthetics. On smaller motors the startup is probably a lot smoother which means the difference in handling is a non-issue during hard acceleration but with the larger motors it makes a noticeable difference. I ran dual diag SK3 6374s on one of my boards.. actually two of my boards. and while it wasn't an issue of rideability, it was definitely a different feel that i found slightly annoying. The flavor difference there is so minor though. I'm just picky, really.

This is a common misconception, it really depends on foot placement and riding style. In a car you cant shift 95% of the vehicle weight forward during acceleration. This is basically what happens when we accelerate on a board, we lean forward. The rear wheels actually have a greater tendency to break free when we do this. 

@longhairedboy The only real way to explain this would be to show you two boards on the same turn and you would see the difference in predictability. Dual rear drives "ice out". I think any undesirable handling you encountered was due to your bushings moving on those calibers, the bushing seat can be a little sloppy on them. If you want to know what I mean check out what Zak Maytum had to say about bushing slop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAjB1Xhzc6o

We have to wait 2 more weeks since our machining factory didn't follow our drawings and made a crucial mistake on the cans.

Oh trust me, I'll be there when we have an official event setup. With these motors, in 2wd, it will be similar in the performance of 4wd with the old motors, except quite a few other things have been optimized. So it will be even better than my 4wd was, and that 4wd... That thing could climb almost anything with speeds above 20 mph.

This thread is quite humorous.

I think everyone is arguing different points, sometimes even within their own argument. There is obviously a distinct difference between what type of wheel will provide the smoothest/most comfortable ride vs what is optimized for speed. These are two completely different things, albeit having some small overlaps of course (you can only go so fast if your bouncing all over the place). 

Then we have an argument that the wheels that the fastest downhill riders (going 60-70mph) use have "x" amount of urethane and are "x"mm in size, and are therefore ideal for a e-sk8 which goes half the speed (30-35mph tops). Not sure what point is trying to made there.

I'm the odd man out in that I don't really care that much about having the smoothest ride, and have been fine with the ride quality on a variety of thin urethane hubs I've ridden. I'm just a street skater who got turned onto e-boards, and like that "feedback" and vibration where i can really feel the road, slide easily, etc, but that's not what we're arguing here. It seems like the vast majority of users want the smoothest ride, and to achieve that, it is pretty obvious that using a full urethane wheel, built specifically for skateboarding, is the best option. That doesn't mean that the Raptor hubs are crap and ride horribly. I'm sure they're fine, and 95% of people would be more than content with the ride quality.

yeah they do that. ABECs slide out of control for me but the kegels are juuuust sticky enough to control...

No offense to everyone, but the whole NVG core and rubber separating was a result of poor design and not hub motor wheels in general. The problem is big companies like ABEC aren't making hub motor wheels for hub motor manufacturers. As a result, we have make our own. There's a learning curve to that though. The ABEC core has "hooks" that essentially, make it very difficult (nearly impossible under normal circumstances) to slip. I think as long as we use cores, with some sort of hooking design like ABEC, hub motor wheels will be much safer, and that'll be a thing of the past.

They also attach the core to the thane. Not quite sure their method, but that's another important factor. Good core design, and get the core and thane to bond, and I think what happened to NVG will never happen again.

I'll share some stats on my own customer base. These aren't precise, but based on what i've observed:

43% wanted the fastest board possible for reasons of insanity, and cited adrenaline dependency as the root cause of this condition. Some of them also openly admitted to the use of cocaine, alcohol, and other drugs that have been known to turn people into wild fucking animals. 

15% wanted a more expensive board than the guy in the other cubicle who was riding theirs to work and had an average of 72 things they didn't like about the other guy and his board combined. 27% of the time i agreed that the other guy was a jerk and asked whoTF he thought he was, that jerk. 

22% simply wanted to destroy their friend's evolve because they were sick of hearing about it and wanted something "that would leave it in the dust but not all the time because i have to ride to work too haha i'll leave it to you." so they left it to me and left their friends in the dust. 

9% don't want to bother with anything else, i'm simply the fastest and most expensive board that can be had by the typical joe for cash as found on google and "besides he'll put a transformers logo on there too if I want because fuck yeah i love that guy" which is basically true, i'll put just about anything on your deck if you want. 

7% are investment brokers that have enough cash to troll me with bizarre combinations of features that i'm pretty sure were meant to conflict with each other and thwart me hilariously but somehow i always pull it off. TRY HARDER.

4% are teenagers with supportive parents encouraging them to get into a fun, rewarding, and often dangerous sport and they know i'll take care of their kid's board and won't give them shit about it when something happens. 

Lots of people are out there with money to spend. Lots of them are skeptical, cautious people who don't want a crap board. You just have to appeal to them.

Wide wheels can be great if you allow them to deform to contact the ground. The height and width of the hub is a factor. Note that I've made a 83mm tall x 78mm wide wheel with a small core, a medium core, a large core, and a double-large core, so I can tell how much difference a hub makes. Virtually EVERY race wheel is wide compared to a freeride wheel, park wheel, ditch wheel, trick (street/freestyle) wheel, pool wheel, cruiser wheel, plastic board wheel ...

So "wide" can be great if you know what to do with the width. If you have a lot of urethane depth on a wheel that is too narrow, it is HORRIBLE. I don't think that it will be news to anyone here that an inline wheel totally sucks as a skateboard wheel. And when a wheel is that narrow, adding urethane depth makes it even worse. The urethane bends (tacos) when any sideloads are put on the wheel. And even in a straight line there isn't "reduced rolling resistance". 

My point is that you have to intelligently combine hub shapes and sizes with wheel shapes and sizes, and also consider the durometer of the wheel and the characteristics of the urethane (grippy or drifty).

I decided to follow this with a picture of some of the wide wheels that I was talking about. Note that the wheel design AND hub being used evolved over time as we were learning more and more about what worked and what didn't.  All of the "theory" about how a wheel will perform isn't nearly as valuable as building the damn things, bolting them onto your board, and then being realistic about what you're experiencing. All of the below reference wheels are 83mm in diameter. From top left to bottom right:

1. Original Flywheel, 52mm wide on 50mm x 52mm wide hub
2. Second Gen Flywheel, 52mm wide, 45mm x 40mm wide hub
3. "Doublewide" Flywheel, 78mm wide, 2 hubs, 4 bearings
4. Momo (unreleased), 78mm wide, 35mm x 38mm wide hub
5. Centrax prototype, 78mm wide (thin lips), 25mm x 25mm wide hub
6. Centrax rain proto, 78mm wide (thin lips), 25mm x 25mm wide hub
7. Centrax production, 78mm wide (thicker lips), 25mm x 25mm wide hub
8. Centrax HD, 78mm wide, 35mm x 38mm wide hub

Wide can be good, but you need to know how to couple it with the proper urethane depth, lip flex, hub flex, contact patch, urethane types, durometer ... It's like what they say about making omelettes - you're going to have to break some eggs!

Judging by how very dark and impossible it is to see inside, I'd have to guess that we're really looking at here is a very narrow section (or sections) of an otherwise very thin band of urethane that is a little deeper in spots to prevent it from flying off the hub.

Perhaps you could "enlighten" the image and/or enlighten the viewers as to how much of that thin band of urethane is actually 19.59mm deep? The urethane band is going to be very thin for most all of the motor width, but it would go deeper at the end(s) for a small fraction of the hub motor width for purposes of fastening it in place with end caps.

What exactly is the relationship between comparing skateboard wheels being pulled down windy mountain roads by gravity, and skateboard wheels being powered by motors in a straight line?
[/quote]

PLENTY!

Sooner or later, both of these boards will need to corner ... life is never a smooth straight road for very long.
No one riding the DH board or the electric skateboard wants a wheel that feels like shit. It's completely avoidable in both cases. 

Let's not pretend that both riders don't want performance. They want performance at speed whether that is simply to be comfortable on a commute or a ride in the park, or comfortable as in having confidence when going into a hairpin turn in a race. There is simply no upside to having a harsh-feeling vibration-inducing wheel that slips and skitters on imperfections in the road. None. Even on the smoothest skateboard wheels we get enough of a feel for the road. There is no downside to smoothness, traction and control. None. And there's no downside to speed when you can control it and/or have brakes. None.

No one here is pretending that downhill is the same exact thing as electric skateboarding. But the performance requirements are nearly identical. When I'm going into a turn at high speed on an electric skateboard do I suddenly care that a motor got me up to speed instead of gravity, as if that mattered? Hell no! You care about having what it takes to negotiate the turn. Stability, traction, control, smoothness ... nothing janky. 

There are some of downhill race course that require a lot of braking and pre-drifting is a popular and effective way to scrub off speed. On those course bigger/wider hubs are used to provide a more uniform and controlled slide. Less urethane than you'd find when the course is faster but less technical. On hills where speed and traction is more important than controlled drifting, smaller core are used which of course gives you MORE urethane. A 75mm wheel with a 25mm hub gives you 25mm of urethane depth. That's a lot of urethane on a (relatively) small wheel. But you can use a small wheel because races tend to be held on smooth roads.

I really don't understand people trying to argue that electric skateboarders DON'T want or DON'T need wheels that perform well. WTF? Or that people want fewer options. WTF? Really? One rattley wheel size one way? One gear ratio? One wheel width? One duro? One formula? 

I thought that we were here to make better boards, not better sales pitches to unsuspecting customers.

Think you're taking my comments a bit too literal Chris, and if you read some of my posts you'll see that you're preaching to the choir as it relates the ride quality, and what's best for electric skateboards wheel wise.

I'm a dealer of both Boosted and Inboard because I feel they both have their place. 

Personally, I will never choose a Hub Motor for many of the reasons you mention. 

That said, my last sale was an Inboard to a customer who demoed both the Inboard M1 and the Boosted V2. This customer had a friend with a Boosted V1 that she had already ridden many times. The customer called before coming in, specifically asking about the Inboard M1.  The customers biggest concern was which board would handle moisture better and which board was less maintenance. And since the board was headed away to college she would need to deal with belt replacements on her own. Besides that, she liked the stiffer M1 for her own reasons. She chose the Inboard after me making very clear the pros and cons of both.

Seems like you might be the type of person that crams what you feel is best on someone, maybe? I'm the type of person that presents all the information and lets someone choose what they feel is best for themselves.

Totally agree, many people buying compete boards as an appliance don't care much about ride quality or high speed cornering grip. While enthusiasts like the DIY community care about every tiny detail of feel and performance. 

Though anyone going over 20mph really should care about cornering grip, does not mean they will or know what is good and what is not.

You couldn't be more wrong about me if you tried. My mantra from day one has been:

1. There are many, many ways to ride a skateboard
2. What you ride, and how you ride it is up to you
3. When you provide many great choices/options to consumers, they can dial in their ride

The evidence to support this claim is the INSANE number of wheel, hub, and urethane combos that I have personally designed, tested, and produced. The insane number of hangers that I have produced (raked, rakeless, fixed pivot Fyre, 100mm to 200mm inclusive at 5mm increments, cast, CNC machined, RKP, TKP, Dual, etc.) The insane number of baseplates that I have produced (0° to 60° inclusive at 5° increments for the the CNC Liquid and Fyre Trucks and 7 more for the cast Attacks. The insane number of pool, park, street, ditch, downhill, slalom, freeride, mini, cruiser, tech-slide, and dance decks that I've produced. 

To suggest that I make ONE thing and try to cram that on someone who doesn't know any better is an asinine accusation. You obviously don't know me and/or prefer to ignore evidence to make a point. I don't give rat's ass about making money as long as I can keep the doors open and the lights on and continue to develop great skateboard products. I've been putting function first since 1974 and will do so til the day I die.

As I've said here before, hub motors are not going away any time soon. There's nothing evil or wrong about them. They represent one of many ways to skin a cat. Right now, I don't want buy them or sell them but it's totally fine if others do. If anything they will help people realize how nice a real skateboard wheel can feel and perform. You asked the question, "What exactly is the relationship between comparing skateboard wheels being pulled down windy mountain roads by gravity, and skateboard wheels being powered by motors in a straight line?"

I answered the question. You're welcome.

I'm not arguing that they don't.

I'm suggesting that "craming" wheel performance on someone that wants hubs motors for other reasons besides wheel performance isn't the answer. Informing them of the options and letting them choose is a better way IMO. 

15mm of thane depth is a horrible idea for many of us that know better, especially with a massive steel core in it. I've enjoyed many sets of Gumballs and Big Zigs, and that's the ride quality many of us want to replicate on our ESK8s. Just some people don't care as much, even when they've tried both (my Inboard sale example). Some may eventually figure it out. Others will never use an ESK8 in a way where wheel performance matters much to them.

Come on Chris, we all know you are here primarily in an effort to prop-up your diminishing sales as the downhill skateboard market, that lined your pockets with cash at the start of this decade, slowly dies! Based on what [wheels are being used by the pros](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/1/7/1791ece42c8060bd483548d620ecef8b9aaa2db4_1_690x243.png) it seems your _oversized_ product line up is slightly out of favor in that market anyway. 

>>>>> On that note, where on earth do we need to go to buy the large diameter products you are talking up? - it seems most of the big online stores [Muirskate](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/wheels/abec11) - [Daddies](https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/skateboards/skateboard-wheels/abec11) - [WarehouseSkateboards] (https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/skateboard-wheels#class=1W&pg=1&brand=AEL|) - [Tactics](http://www.tactics.com/abec-11/skateboard-wheels) - don't sell big wheels, 83mm & above, are they just not popular enough to be kept in stock? why is that?

Considering the dwindling supporter & competitor numbers, my guess is that the IDF has just a few years left before it's not viable and only a fool would ignore those signs, your no fool Chris. _Explains your increased presence here._

Fortunately, there is a new market ripe for abec11 insemination, A rapidly growing ESK8 market that just happens to love your wheels primarily due to the fact that your core is perfect for attaching a pulley, your saving grace, and last but not least because they are fucking good wheels, Chris.

**Yes, You resell very good products, bravo!** 

However, in your misguided attempt to further grow your loyal fan base of esk8ers & sway opinions towards your clearly superior products, whilst simultaneously using back-hand rhetoric & expertisims to smack down other popular & rapidly emerging trends, such as hub motors, I feel you have become lost in a flowing sea of your [secret urethane formulas](https://www.basf.com/en/company/news-and-media/science-around-us/longboard-wheels.html) & soft sales pitches....

**Chris, Your sales pitch & reality are slightly misaligned right now!**

FACT: We have already proven that the fastest wheel don't have the most urethane. _Capisce!_

ALSO: Your own [customers testimonials](http://www.abec11.com/products/abec11/abec-11-76mm-83mm-90mm-97mm-flywheels-75a-78a) on your own website contradict your "Expert Advice" proclaiming esk8 riders must have gargantuan amounts of urethane otherwise they will be doomed / unhappy / unsatisfied / uncomfortable / unaccepted / etc / etc...

Yep - I'm way off on the GT weight. So a 17lb Carbon GT is what a timid college student should get to class on, and not have to maintain?

I do want to sell the things I stock - I feel we offer great products. Many of our customers see and learn about DIY products when I'm making a mess at the shop. Some products from vendors here and others I'm working on for myself. I've been selling skateboards / longboards for over 30 years and have never been as excited as I am now (because of ESK8). I'd like to think that rubs off on some of our customers.

Looking forward to offering more ESK8 products in the future... maybe even some of our own.

Yes. **Build her own.** She's going to college, so: 
1) the knowledge us good
2) the price point is cheaper if you only need little range, and having extra money in college is always good
3) she can make it a shorter board, as the inboard is hard to stuff in a bag or carry even though it's lighter than other  production boards

@onloop I think the only reason that @ChrisChaput's sales are going down isn't the quality of the wheel (because everybody loves it) but the **color** of the wheel. That weird limy green with the orange hub is ugly as f*ck, and it's led other people to look for better options aesthetically.

@chrischaput between myself and my friends, we own a 3 pairs of your wheels. We all love them for cruising and carving on regular boards in the suburbs of SF. But there is no way in hell that I'm going to put them on an electric board because they just ruin the look! I know that you are always after ride quality, and ride quality is what most customers **should** be concerned about, however the truth is that some customers like myself are equally concerned about the look of the board. As a seller, you have the job of catering to the mass markets, and the mass markets are demanding something that both looks good and performs well. I think that if you were to produce a lineup that had better looking wheels in the first place with the same quality urethane that the serious riders love, then it would be a win-win for everyone. I know you probably aren't going to take this into too much consideration as you've already started producing your new lineup but here are my suggestions for a better looking wheel:

1) Color Options - Solid Black, Gel Blue, Gel Green, Gel Red
2) Change the ugly font and get rid of the fly logo on the wheel. We already know that it's called a 'fly'wheel.
3) Make the 'Abec11' logo smaller. On road-worn 76mm wheels, it starts to wear away with the wheel and looks even worse

Anyone interested in the R-Spec Ghost Raptor 2 wheels?

These 90mm wheels are made with premium high rebound urethane, 75a for plush comfort on all surfaces, made in USA. Think orang.

The core is super strong, made using Nylon 66 Reinforced with glass fibre. This core is extra strong and can handle high torque load from wheel pulleys unlike some other brands with cores that have thinner more fragile spoke design.

Onloop can you get some footy of the R2 railing corners at 28mph?  That's 42 litre-coulours or something metric...Ok ride quality is one thing but high speed cornering performance is incredibly important for safety reasons ... 

This is obviously more practical than doing kickflips or grinds on an esk8 which is still cool but very few riders are ever gonna do that.  But everybody wants to take corners haha

Every single one of my customers has mentioned wheel durometer and size. A few of them were after more casual commuters and cruisers which can use softer more generic wheels like clones and not chunk them inside of a year. but the adrenaline junkies all get abecs and orangutans. I'm actually leaning hard toward orangutans for our non-custom premium complete we're working on. 

I think the people that don't care so much about their wheels aren't after the performance for reasons that actually matter. They're probably just looking at bullet points. 

I find Hummie's use of nitrile rubber rather interesting. After riding around on fresh tires with his hubs a bit.. its different but definitely a solid choice for the application.

dude seriously, you need to get with the program, very few, if any, skateboard brands make their own wheels....

it's all contract work done by [specialist wheel factories](https://www.silverfishlongboarding.com/forum/longboard-skateboarding-wheels-bearings/63430-wheel-manufacturers-distributors-10.html#post1300280147), these skate brands all want you to think they are pouring thane in their garage using special formulas & magic potions but they aint... 

The majority of skate brands are just glorified branding, marketing & sales companies.

You could easily get your own flavor of LHB wheels made by the factory that makes ABEC11... 

If you're serious about manufacturing your own brand of complete esk8 your nuts if you pay double the price for wheels just because they have a fancy logo / brand printed on them..... cut out the middle man and make your own flavor of wheels. I did.

I find Hummie's use of nitrile rubber rather interesting. After riding around on fresh tires with his hubs a bit.. its different but definitely a solid choice for the application.
[/quote]

Yeah, I like Hummie's rubber idea too. With thinner hub depth I could see rubber being a better option over urethane for hard carving traction. Likely at the expense of roll efficiency/rebound, and durability. I think all this talk about the fastest wheels for ESK8s is pretty funny - The fastest wheels for ESK8s are the ones attached to a power system and drive train they spins them the fastest. Period.

Should I be worried I bought a R2? I am in noways a pro skater, used to skate regularly for a few years cause of girls in highschool  so I don't know about what you guys are talking about lmao.

All i'm getting about this thread is that Hub motors need a lot of urethane to be good and that the raptor's hub motors need more? I don't know. :sweat_smile:

How I understand it is if you're a beginner, or just cruiser then hubs will be just fine for you. You're not likely to travel at the higher speeds, or more importantly try turning hard/sliding at those speeds. 

Advanced rider are harder on urethane. They slide a bit more, and hub motors with thin urethane likely wont last long under those conditions. This has yet to be tested fully. But if a hub motor fails and the urethane gets pealed of the motor at speed you're likely in for a world of hurt.

That is NOT at all what is being communicated here. Whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced, the laws of physics hold. Virtually ANYONE can feel the difference between having lots of quality urethane under you, or a small amount of urethane. Having said that, if the only thing that you've ever ridden is a poorly performing and rough riding wheel and if you have NOTHING else to compare it to, you can accurately say, "It's the best I've ever felt". 

You can feel the smoothness of having lots of urethane while riding in a straight line, regardless of your experience. You can feel the increased traction and control of having lots of urethane while cornering, regardless of your experience. Of COURSE it's more important to people who are going at high speeds and to people who demand performance. But just because you aren't a professional skateboarder doesn't mean that you don't benefit from high performance products. This idea that it's "okay for a beginner" is really just a cover for not wanting to say that "beginners might be able to feel the difference". I might not know the difference between a good golf club or a good tennis racket and a bad one, but I can tell the difference between a Tesla and a Yugo without being a race car driver.

Most beginners don't WANT to slide when turning and more good urethane can help them with that. Vibrating and dancing around on rough surface and breaking contact with the ground can be hazardous to your health, which is a legitimate concern for the newbie.

Thin amounts of urethane wears out more quickly than large amounts of urethane whether you are a beginner or a pro. Yes, the pro may put more wear and tear on wheels than the newbie, but BOTH benefit from having more.

This HAS been tested fully. More is smoother. More is better. Hub motors aren't inherently bad or evil, but there is a price that you pay when go that way. I think that the price is so steep that I'm going a different way. There is a price to pay for using belts and pulleys and I wouldn't dream of denying that fact. But I think the belt/pulley price is minimal and the upside is awesome and so my choice is an easy one. And I could change my mind if hub motors can be miniaturized, come in a number of widths and diameters, can be easily cooled, and provide gear reduction ratios that are better suited for the weight of the human being and his/her board. 

And yes, I don't quite understand how watching videos of hub motor wheels flying off the rims at a relatively slow speed and when travelling in a straight line is helping the case for hub motors.

From what I got from this there is a noticeable difference from using wheels with more urethane than not. My question following this is by how much of a factor will the difference be, I do plan on hitting high speeds once I get used to it which is kinda why I got the R2.

Yes, agree.... lots of great subjective info...


but eventually, as a community of people who all crave cutting edge performance specs, we should all collectively ask for some test results not just more walls of text.

I believe chris should now back up claims with some specific data related to wheel performance on electric skateboards, I'll be very interested and more than willing to learn.


1. At what point does a wheel diameter start to have negative impacts? if ever? 20cm 30cm?
2. Is it possible to have too much urethane? if so how much? urethane to weight to diameter ratios?
3. At what point does vibration dampening characteristics of thicker urethane become undetectable?
4. What types of surfaces are these results based on? smooth, rough? how does this impact the wheel design? 
5. how is surface quality defined?

It is a LOT easier conduct tests when there is a large number of items to test, and where those items are incrementally different than one another.

**Example #1:** Try a group of wheels all of which have a the same hub, the same urethane formula, the same durometer, the same wheel width, the same (basic) wheel shape, and the same number of teeth in both the motor pulley **and the wheel pulley**. Of course you use the same direct drive system to power the wheel. Change only the wheel diameter and possibly the riser pad height to maintain the same ride height for the deck. Now you're in a good place to test the difference in torque and/or urethane depth.

**Example #2:** Try a group of wheels all of which have a the same hub, the same urethane formula, the same durometer, the same wheel width, the same (basic) wheel shape, and the same number of teeth in the motor pulley.  **Use a different wheel pulley** for every different wheel diameter to try and maintain a constant level of torque. Consider ride height for the deck. Now you're in a good place to test the difference in urethane depth and wheel size.

This type of test is essentially impossible to do if you only have one wheel size or one gear ratio. What this tells me is that unless and until we have all of the equipment to do the tests, we can only speculate about the results. We're getting closer, and part of my contribution to the community is to make a lot of different wheels and make a lot of different pulleys that fit those wheels. 

I've already done a TON of testing without the pulleys and with gravity and pumping as my motor. Ignore my findings at your own risk ... it'll just give me a huge advantage.

Like the guy that used a board in high school I bought a Inboard M1 as my first board in 15years and my first longboard. What I can say is the the ride quality was fantastic on my first run on it. This board has basically no urethane on the hub motors.. I then tried a regular longboard inside a shob on a nice floor and even there I could feel the big difference on having more urethane. 

Also when I ride longer sessions of 10km++ My feet are killing me since it's shaking like crazy in the rear. I would love to test it with more urethane but it's not a option since it's hub motors :( 

So I think you will be happy with it if it's your first board like me buts it's not for the reason that little urethane is great. Ignorance is bliss.

At least he is trying to increase the quality of his components even if the only reason is to use the made in the USA print on his front wheels, the absence of this print on the rear wheels leads me to believe they are poured in China... Maybe Jason could clarify this for us!?

Maybe hub wheels other than Carvon V3's can have disposable urethane like contact lenses.
[/quote]

I don't think it's necessary. I think it's up to those of us investing in hubs motor technology to create solid wheels. And it will happen, it's not rocket science. The rubber the easy part when talking about building your own hub motors.

I think from an in wheel hub motor stand point though, hummies motors will win the thickest possible wheel, since it still has the smallest (diameter wise) can as far as we know.

I still don't understand the math of @onloop with the hub motor wheel 90-19-19 = 52mm can. another 4mm on the can (at least, you need enough iron behind the magnets) would mean the stator is only 52-4-4 = 44mm. Hummies stator is 47mm, which would mean hummies motor has a larger stator in both directions... I don't think that's true, as I was under the impression that the stator of the raptor 2 was atleast a 53mm diameter stator. so I'll have to find someone with a raptor 2 in the near future that'll let me crack their motors open and take real measurements. Then we'll get to the bottom of this.

To sum up what I've learned so far:
- Smaller diameter can is better, allows for more rubber
- More rubber is not always better, depends on what the goal is (a soft ride vs the fastest speed (lowest rolling resistance), but for the masses, more rubber is better
- Wider wheels may provide a more plush ride than narrower wheels

All in all, we'll see how this all applies in the real world in the coming weeks as we test hummies new motors.

Can you give me a specific example where more urethane (not rubber) is NOT better? If keeping a low ride height is the issue, then we would just ride on our bearings, or use a drop-deck or drop-through. So let's rule out "ride height". And we can normalize torque by using bigger wheel pulleys as the amount of urethane increases. Given the wheels that we actually use, when is LESS better and why?

My experience is that:

More urethane provides a softer ride
More urethane provides the fastest speed
More urethane decreases rolling resistance
More urethane increases traction and control

When, why, and where exactly does someone want to skimp on the urethane?

p.s. Answering my own question I'd have to say, "When we want to transition in and out of powerslides or drift rather than track". I just don't think of that as the holy grail for electric skateboarding.

[/quote]

So you would agree then that if someone wanted to design a setup for sliding he/she would put LESS (or harder) urethane on the FRONT wheels as well as the back wheels, yes? That skater/designer would put a hub that has a 63mm to 67mm hub in the front so that both the front and back end would drift in an even and balanced manner, yes? Or maybe that person would put even LESS urethane in the front since he/she can't "light up" the front wheels under throttle nor does he/she have the mass (weight) of magnets in the front hub to help it induce a slide, yes? 

It kind of makes you wonder why if having LESS was a good thing, we're seeing MORE in the front wheels. LESS urethane costs less to make - it would be a win-win for the builder.

Maybe builders are putting MORE urethane on the front to try to preserve a little speed, smoothness, longevity, traction and control on ONE end of their board to try and compensate for those losses on the other ...

I only build 4wd boards these days, so I'm in the same board on all 4 wheels. This is so I have even braking, even acceleration, and maximum control of my board.

I ride skateboards, I jump down fair sized drops on skateboards, I grind handrails with skateboards, I love hubbas more than all of those combined, and all of that with hard spitfires that slide the hills of SF of sf like butter and right now, are worn down to only 41mm.

I love the feeling of a nice plush wheel when I need to get from point a to point b, but personally, if I want to slide around, I prefer smaller (50mm), harder duro wheels, that will likely never have a motor in (that's practical. I've seen a few try).

Maybe some will like a harder duro, smaller wheel on their electric board?

To me, it's about giving people options. Everyone wants something different. You'll never get a mass of skaters to agree on something like this that is really about personal preference. Different wheels for different purposes.

If we really wanted the best ride, wouldn't we all really be riding air filled tires, like @psychotiller's 6 inch tires?

There's a case for all types of wheels. If big plush wheels were the only real option, why do you still make wheels smaller than 90mm?

I don't see any evidence to support the claim builders are producing boards with hard urethane and/or using less urethane as an option to promote sliding. I don't see it in their primary builds, and I don't see it as a secondary option. I see a lot of soft urethane and options to get bigger wheels with more urethane. Maybe you are aware of some electric slide board manufacturers and can enlighten us.

I'm all about providing options. Who is providing these hard wheel/thin urethane options?

My response is the same question I asked you before, If big plush wheels were the only real option, why do you still make wheels smaller than 90mm?

Personally, I like being as close to the road as possible. Bigger wheels mean I need risers, and I'm way higher up off the ground. Less stable at speed.

This leads you to want to use a drop down deck, which is a solution, but maybe some don't want a drop down deck, they want a cruiser, but don't want to be so high off the ground?

Spitfire, Ricta, Bones, Darkstar, ect. Make small wheels? If big wheels were great for everything, why don't pro street skaters use them?

I make wheels for electric skateboards that start at 83mm and then provide MORE urethane in a 90mm wheel, MORE urethane than that in a 97mm wheel, and then MORE urethane again in a 107mm wheel.

I'll be doing an offset 83mm SuperFly that has MORE urethane width-wise than the original 83mm Flywheel, an offset 90mm SuperFly that has MORE urethane width-wise than the original 90mm Flywheel, and an offset 97mm SuperFly that has MORE urethane width-wise than the original 97mm Flywheel,

Not surprisingly, I'm using a SOFTER 74a urethane in the 4 different SuperFly sizes. If you don't like smoothness, don't like speed, and don't like traction and control, then go out to Drift City and get those harder/thinner options that you suggest vendors will be providing and be happy.

I make wheels that are 83mm or smaller with smaller hubs in order to maintain a nice urethane depth. I'm all about providing options. Good options. 

I'm discontinuing some wheels that have little to no sales. The 76mm Flywheel for example. Why? Because it has too little urethane and the public has spoken.

Are you really going to pretend that anyone here has suggested that "big wheels are great for everything" just so you can say, "no, they're not"? Seriously dude?

Like I said, it depends on what you want to do.

You took one little thing, and draw it out more than it needs to be. I said in the OP that bigger wheels are the best for the masses. I'm pretty sure that was the whole point of this thread. But that other wheel shapes and sizes have their purpose. This is true or else these companies wouldn't be making them.

So who is making the harder/thinner options of which you speak? Where can I go right now and get these awesome drift options? And if the answer is "nowhere", why do suppose that is? Didn't E-Toxx put some Drift-Trike wheels on a deck so they could do donuts on cobblestone?

Depends on if your goal is commuting or sliding or popping and grinding.

I think for the mass, the goal is to commute, and thus, we want the most urethane. But it doesn't need to be the only option.

A poll was conducted on this forum maybe about a year ago, and the majority of the people said they prefer the 83mm orangatang wheel over the 90mm abec 11. Maybe ask them why they want smaller wheels?

Like I said before, for me, eboarding is about commuting, so yes, I want bigger wheels.

Here is the urethane depth chart and you can see where I broke out the 80mm Kegel into two rows to show the two different depths. I've also included a cross section of the wheel so that you can see the wheel width, contact patch, and profiles in question. Notice that everyone below it is basically obsolesced and that everything above it (except the 92mm on the smaller V1 hub) is currently being used and will be offered in a wider footprint (MORE urethane) and with SOFTER urethane. First and foremost, I want this for myself. I know what works, I know what I like, and I'm willing to fork out a ton of money to make it happen. If I'm wrong about what everyone wants I'll lose a lot of money but I'll still get what I want.

We already have professional Skateboard racing events that publish the results. It's the IDF.

74mm diameter at 65mm wide contact patch is on average the optimal wheel for speed, handling, racing.

Top results from last two years of racing.

If you want speed at all costs it seems less urethane is actually better. 73mm diameter with just 16.5mm of thane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbN_imu_ewA


If you want comfort only. Buy the largest possible wheels with max urethane, or just go with pneumatics.
If you want large urethane your only choice is Abec11.

When it comes to the best wheel for racing Electric Skateboards nobody knows the answer. Thats a fact!

Some experts say that if it's good for gravity racing it must be good for esk8 racing!! 

My expert opinion says the pilot with the fastest acceleration, highest top speed wins... Wheels will be 2nd place to raw performance.

Once esk8 racing league matures and performance has reach maximum levels, wheels once again will be critical, however, the difference will be measured in milliseconds.

Jason, you seriously need to stop embarrassing yourself and stop posting that fake "speed record" by Kyle Wester who has never done 89mph. Everyone knows how easy it is to put the two timers of a speed trap closer together than what you say they are in order to get a ridiculously inflated speed. That is a farce and everyone (except you apparently) knows this. You seem to like to use "fake news" as evidence. Nice. The fastest times on that hill have been a touch over 80mph.

On a different hill and in the presence of a sanctioning body (and not a company willing to cook the books), Kyle got waxed by other downhillers, the fastest of which did a little over 85mph. Mike Mac did over 100mph on his streetluge on Flywheels, proving that a lot of mass in an aerodynamic package is what rules the day. There's a turn at the bottom of the hill that you have to set up for just right or you can easily crash, which Mike did on his last run before going to the hospital. With speed comes the need for traction and control, and setting a good line.

At the speeds that these guys are hitting and without any motors, what every downhiller knows is that AERODYNAMICS plays a MUCH bigger role in top speed than does the wheels. Any decent wheel can win. Your weight, body type, tuck, leathers, speed suit, and fairings are what rule the day. 

Strap a motor on a race vehicle doing 200ph and aerodymics is THEN used to create downforce BECAUSE YOUR WHEELS AND TRACTION IS EVERYTHING! If you can't stay on the road in a turn, you're not a contender. PERIOD.

Maybe cause there's such a thing as specialty wheels? This thread started off about urethane and hub motor placement then it devolve into being about relevancy of materials, then wheel size. To add the cherry on top, everyone started sh*t talking about each other companies, such a dramatic bunch. But i love drama so i grab my popcorn and eagerly await the next posts.

To get back on track, yes, you're right. I also agree that evidence about wheel size is moot. I think both side of the arguments in this thread is missing a fundamental thing, downhill is not esk8. Using downhill evidence to compare with esk8 is like using tour de france results and comparing with moto gp results. Completely irrelevant when there is motors involve. 

Are there similarities? Yes, just like counter steering is similar to motorbike and bicycle, but they're still two very diff sport on a fundamental aspect.

Jason, please explain how having a mixed bag of wheels on your board is better than than a uniform set of user determined wheels in any size and durometer? When you split the original topic and created this thread I thought you might be ready to give some meaningful content, so far you have failed to do that. 

Maybe you can split this thread again and regain some footing?

Great question Jerimiah

Mixing wheel type/duro is not a new thing, maybe not so common DH, more common in slalom.

https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3257/2728959536_fb21abc8f4_b.jpg

Actually, Different tyre widths, tyre compounds & tyre pressures are quite common in 4 wheel vehicles, Especially high-performance racing cars like F1.

In the near future, Enertion will offer a suite of different wheel types for race enthusiasts who want to tweak their performance.

We have been working very closely with our chemical engineer in our wheel factory developing & innovating (as usual) various flavors of performance urethane so come race day our pilots can customize the ride to suit the track conditions & maximize performance.

Top secret race formula being developed & tested.

What Jason doesn't seem to understand is that he's proving our point for us. Slalom racers use SOFTER duros in the back and/or bigger wheels in the back to get more traction and drive from the rear. The front doesn't need as much traction - it needs to be able to steer more quickly ... to be more "nimble". Similarly, race cars are evolving and the tires are getting BIGGER. 

What I don't understand is if having thin condoms around heavy metal hubs is so wonderful in the back, why would you then put a decent amount of urethane on the hubs in the front? Is this a drift-board by design?

Maybe someone can me why I used double REAR trucks in Giant Slalom and double FRONT trucks in Downhill and Street Luge? It's difficult for others to say because in order to really know, you have to race in slalom, race in DH, set up double truck decks and try them in real world conditions, something VERY few people have ever done. I love how people here who have never been in a downhill race in their life say that there are no performance similarities in DH and electric skateboards.

That's why we moved away from CF & designed a system that can go on nearly any longboard that doesn't flex, drop down included.

Actually, the R2 deck has a micro drop which further lowers ride height about 5/16"

Personally, I like a good drop through deck that gets you low to the ground. This is the biggest weakness o the carvon v3's to me. Having a can on the truck and not in the wheel means you can't reverse mount them.

I'm having a really hard time staying quiet when all my friends are making hilarious arguments and all i want to do is antagonize everyone until they start blathering incoherences. Blathering more incoherences than usual, that is. 

Part of the reason i build custom boards is because no one solution is right for everyone. So arguing over what's better is totally and completely pointless. What's better for one person is terrible for somebody else. In this case, one thing is actually terrible for a lot of people and only ok for most. 

Comparing rubber to urethane.. i mean what the fuck people. Hey my apples are better than your rice. WTF its not even fruit. 

For starters, the R-SPEC "direct drives" aren't even direct drives. They're fucking hubs. The only fool making direct drives is Jerry over at Carvon. The motor attaches to the wheel and sits just outside the wheel. IT is not IN the wheel. 

Hubs are IN THE FUCKING WHEEL. Do i need to explain what belt drives are too? Buy me a fucking ticket to australia and i'll give a little reminder when the raptor 2 is somewhere behind me getting stuck in the hot thane i left on the street.

It's pretty self-explanatory, "Direct Drive" simply means no transmission components. It a top level category identifier & can be legitimately used to describe anything without transmission components.

Under this top category, you can have several sub categories, as long as they don't have transmission components.

1. Hub motors, motor fully inside the wheel.
2. Off-set Hub Motors, motor partially inside the wheel
3. (Carvon) Direct Drive Motor with universal wheel attachment.

I think you will be disappointed with your performance, specifically torque, once you compare it to Raptor 2 - Just remember, I'm very familiar with your motors, I have them on hand & I also have experienced the R2 first hand.

Even if the raptor 2 is the fastest board "in the world" that does not mean it has the best wheels, it just means it has the highest power system. Motor/battery combo.  The fastest wheel is the one attached to the highest power system with a pilot with the biggest balls. Speed does not equal ride quality. 

The topic is "hubs and ride quality"

My primary argument is that there must be a minimum amount of urethane that delivers acceptable "ride quality & high-speed performance" to satisfy the end user. What that minimum amount is nobody knows at this point in time!

My secondary argument is that saying MORE & MORE & MORE urethane is automatically better is actually false... We already know this because of IDF racing results, for some reason pro's don't tend to use much larger than 75-80mm diameters.

Finally, larger diameter wheels on esk8 put more strain on the drive train electronics, require more reduction and take a bit longer to spin up to speed, eventually there will be some other design constraints that prevent us using INCREASILY MASSIVE wheels, like wheelbite etc... 

**MAJOR POINT: There will be a practical limit, in both urethane thinness & thickness, when it comes to perfecting esk8 wheel design.**

----------


----------


To address the ride quality argument without objective test data, we can only take feedback from first-hand experiences & so far people are saying the R2 is smooth to ride.... here is a new user report from today.

Btw, hummies v3 will have the largest contact patch with the rode at 77mm for high speed stability, and is the most tried and tested and mechanically sound hub motor produced so far.

Also, I mis spoke, it's 77mm wide contact patch. Was looking at the wrong wheel.

And before you say something about DH riders using 78mm wide wheels or larger, it's not the same as a hub motor for multiple reasons.

Ride quality is partially subjective and partially application specific. So there can not be one right solution for all. 

Smaller or lighter wheels will accelerate faster so are good for push boards and racing. Bigger wheels are good for rough terrain or softer ride with the main downside being extra weight. Acceleration is not an issue for powered boards but if you need to carry your board around a lot it can be an issue. Wheel bite can be an issue depending on board design and truck width. 

For me personally I use my board to commute and the terrain varies from smooth, to barely ride-able to dangerously un-even. So I will use the largest wheel I can get provided its not too heavy.  For me 100mm is the sweet spot.

lol yeah i'm literally shaking in my bare feet. 

Bitches i'm running 12S 530 watt hour packs STANDARD with over 6000 watts at the ass end on 2.1 ratios on 83mm wheels and up. I've got top speeds of over 43mph and enough boost on launch to break traction. The only one building bigger packs with more punch with an LLC and putting them into boards is @chaka, who is pretty much responsible for my battery habits. 

But i'll beat a raptor r2 on 80mm kegels. Actually i'll bring a couple sets since they change characteristics basically after the first race. Might want to do the same with your ghosts since they're 90mm kegels too. Don't know what to tell you about the 13mm of thane you have in your hub drives. 

or maybe i'll show up with my brand new set of SuperFlys and fuck everyone's world up. Shit i'll put all that minus the giant pack in a raptor 1 deck and totally embarass everybody. 

google. ITs whatever people say it is. Apparently according to google i'm the only one making legitimate custom boards because after the ads i'm the first result, nevermind my seo skills...

I love you like a brother LHB, but watts in your battery ain't shite if you can't get it to the ground....firstly you would need a 120AMP Cont BMS for 6000watts to get to the motors/esc. Then you need to get it to the wheels via your 9mm wide belts! 

This is exactly why they invented the dynamometer for performance tuning - it measures true power at the wheels which is all that matters (total power minus transmission losses)

This is probably the 10th time I have shared this [info](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/are-hub-motors-worse/13330/70?u=onloop) & most people ignore it, I think after the 100th time I share it people will actually take a second to soak it in.

Assuming you can get 6000Watts to the motors.
**Belts have a torque transfer limit!.**
You need minimum 15mm wide belts.
3:1 reduction minimum (will require idlers to achieve this with 5mm htd)


Now sir you probably destroy everything on the streets... Just need to work out how to stay on board.

correct. Even during hard, face melting acceleration you'll never use all of that 6000 watts the ass end is capable of. But hey, the bullet point says each one is 3000+ so that MUST mean its actually making it to the street, right? I mean marketing is utter truth, amirite?

and 9s are plenty, or don't you remember the long speeches you gave about how its actually like having a single 18mm belt? Not that all of my builds have nines... i mean.. we have 218mm trucks now thanks to Dexter. I might show up with dual 15s and twin sensored 6374s who knows. OR i'll just do it on my nines like i always do.  Shit i'll just bring Ru down there and use your own hardware to win. Because your old hardware was solid but now somehow its crap. The new stuff is probably solid too because you produce awesome shit. But next year it will probably be crap too, huh?

Shhh! You're gonna give Jason a complex over his tiny battery.  400 watt hours is good for a couple quick sprints and when his battery tires quickly from use he will tell us all about that torque limit he likes to quote. 
 
You and I are the single biggest threat to these posturing astroturfers. We are showing people how good it can be and have normalized appropriately sized packs.  We are the tip of the spear right now along with all the other fine builders who are taking part in this most excellent of pastimes. 

What Jason hasn't realized is we could build a single motor drive and smoke "every" mass produced board on the market just because we use a larger powerplant/battery. Sure our single motor would get hot but it would illustrate were the power begins in an electric vehicle. 

I can only guess that Jason is ignoring the fact that we can produce more power because it is harder to market a more expensive and properly designed board.

he has to qualify that as the fastest direct drive in the world because somebody else here is building the fastest boards commercially available.

gear drive with swappable pulleys for adjustable ratios. 

That's the fucking future. Until then i'm staying with belts. 

I have a feeling its going to be another 5 years before materials science allows hubs to perform as well as geared or belts systems do today in high performance boards and by then gears and belts would have improved as well. There, i said it. So far i've only said that over the phone to a guy who makes wheels, but i'm getting a little cocky these days. 

Do you have anything i can test?

I still like the idea of using a belt as my final power transfer. Really just a personal preference, feels like it decouples the power a little and might treat the gearbox more gently?.

Seems about right. I'm double checking the numbers I had with hummie, cause those wheels look narrow compared to the ones were using. The motor wheels are a few mm wider too. So, still the widest hubs.

So I don't have a dog in this fight. Full disclosure- I do have a Raptor 2 pre ordered. I was able to ride both the Raptor 2 and a custom board with Carvon V3 motors on it. Now my test ride was just around the parking lot and sidewalks, but both felt really good. The R2 had much stronger acceleration.  The Carvon v3 acceleration had a smoother feel to it but definitely slower ramp up. Wheels on both felt great for the 5 minutes that I spent on each. I'm coming from a boosted v1 dual+ with the regular orangutan wheels on it.  Both will be fun boards to ride. I think consumers will be looking to see which board has better long term performance of the components. How do the motors last under stress. The clearance on the V3 carvons is quite low but the outside of the motor looks sturdy. The R2 is heavier and from my weight testing on site it is primarily because of those monster hub wheels. When you pushed the kick tail of the R2 to the ground, it actually felt lighter than pushing the kick of the Carvon V3...even though the R2 weighed more (think about 4lbs more).

I have my Carvon V2/2.5 drop-thru mounted and the hubs extend out onto the hanger in a similar way that the v3 does. I just had to carve out a small wheel well so the motor doesn't bite. Not sure what or if there's a difference in motor diameter, but from the looks of it, I don't think it will be that much of an issue to drop mount a v3.

Here's the way my Carvon V2.5 looks. It's a 9-Ply deck. No bite and I can carve pretty deep. I have the knock-off wheels on this one and the thane is not as nice as my V2 that has Flywheels. These don't grip or absorb the bumps and rocks as well. It's not just the thickness of thane you have, it's also the formula.

The V3 build in long beach did not have VESC settings for drag racing in the least. 

I Wonder if the video segment of my brothers budget build carvon board doing 10kph faster than your Raptor will make the cut hahaha his board also came in 2nd after the raptor2 on one of the drag races we did and my brother is 80lbs heavier than Moja. Moja tried my brothers board as well and hit 57kph on the Carvon board before it was too unstable for him to keep accelerating. He even told us he could tell it had more in it!

I rode your raptor 2 in LB yesterday and Im not here to bash it in the least. Here is my review.

The board looks very well made and feels very sturdy. It accelerates better than any of the producion boards Ive owned or ridden. Top speed is decent as well but Im a tough critic in that department. It accelerates similar to the Jacobs hubs I have with high amp settings.

Since we had a Carvon V3 there on Abec 11s, I tried them back to back. It's a noticeable difference having the full urethane wheel. Not sure if thats even argueable. The ride quality on the raptor2 is also good though. Its much smoother than the other hubs Ive ridden. I think this has to due with the fact that it had such a wide wheel. I belive that there might be a factor that has been slightly overlooked in our discussion of hub motor urethane ride quality thus far. We have talked about urethane depth, but I think the urethne area (depth x wheel width) might be what helped the raptor dampen shock better than I expected. I also like that there wasnt any slop in your setup and Moja said he had lut quite a few miles in it. There was some lateral play on one of the hubs though and the bearings were loud on that wheel as well. Might wanna check that out.

I checked the temp of the motors after our cruise on the V3's and on the Raptor2. The motors on the raptor2 were hot. Too hot. The motors on the V3 were hot as well but not nearly as hot. To be fair, Moja was rode up the last hill a couple more times and is heavier than @DaviDjembe who was on the Carvon V3's. 

The boared does feel heavy though, but 10S4P and powerful hubs always will be though lol.

I don't understand you saying it might brake more like a bike and belt rub.   ?

 I've never heard of transmitting braking through a cvt but I guess it would work.  but looking at it again it doesn't seem a traditional cvt with a flywheel to pull the belt along the cone to a bigger gear but instead some other mechanical thing pulling the motor forward to increase belt tension.  maybe it uses another little servo motor.   looks too complicated
the chrome is butt ugly and who wants chrome on a skateboard anyway.  chromed plastic for sure.

Ive built race minibikes with torque converters like that. Lots of slippage and drag that will wreak havoc on your whr/mile numbers and of you though belt maintenance was bad on your board now youll be in for a big surprise. The belt has no teeth and torque is transmitted through friction along the sides of a v-belt. The belts get hot and harden super quick from my experience with them.

Well it has already begun. The 107mm SuperFly has just been released. It is 12mm wider has an 11mm wider contact patch than the 97mm Flywheel, along with 5mm more urethane depth. We have some 83mm SuperFly prototype wheel molds cut that are awaiting a new/different mold insert to slightly modify the wheel profile. I have a bunch of large diameter 12 foot sections of round aluminum rod stock (that weigh a ton), and am moving toward having 83mm, 90mm, and 97mm molds ASAP. We're doing this in house, and as safely (read slowly) as possible because these big rotating chunks metal can become projectile missiles in a split second if something goes wrong. Lathes are freakin' scary ... always some puckering involved ...

These "smaller" offset SuperFly's each grow the contact patch by 16mm compared to the original centerset. They're a bit like taller BigZig HD's but with the Flywheel core. Molds could take a month or so, lead times for production can be up to six weeks. They may not be released all at once, but once they're all out there we're going to want 32T, 34T, 36T, 38T, 40T, 42T, and 44T wheel pulleys for the 83mm, 90mm, 97mm, and 107mm offerings. You can dial in your torque, top speed, depth of urethane, urethane formula, footprint/handling characteristics for whatever style of riding you like. Unless of course you like rough rides, in which case we can't help you.

[/quote]

Some of our wheel molding-making and production tools are intentionally obscured in pictures because I'm not in the business of launching everyone else's "new wheel company". It's fairing simple to cut through a wheel and reverse-engineer a finished product, but we don't need to also tell others HOW to make them. There are too many people (overseas) who know nothing about wheel design, were never around testing the viability of new hub and designs, never sponsored a race or racers, never advertised, never marketed, never branded, never established relationships with shops and skaters all over the world. They just copied what we did, made them in a substandard urethane using whatever minimal pay and work environment they could get away with, and peddled them on the cheap. And because they look the same it makes people erroneously believe that our products are mediocre AND they also directly compete in sales with ours. Other people launch their skateboard companies using these crappy clones without any regard for who designed and paid for _everything._ 

I have many lathes and mills and machine tools including an American made CNC lathe, an American made CNC mill, and an American made CNC router. It's expensive and there's a big learning curve, but we don't want to just copy what's out there or make stuff and "pray" that it works. We've never made outside sales calls or tried to force our products on people. We make our own wheel molds in house on the CNC lathe here in Huntington Beach. I was there at the beginning when our wheel house opened - their first longboard wheel customer. They're in HB as well.

The reason WHY we do what we is because we love respect ALL types of skating. We are willing to make wheels that other people can't or won't because they're more interested in making money. We aren't motivated by hitting a big demographic and selling ONE cookie cutter product to the masses. I'm a freak. I like freaky things. THE FREAKS ARE MY PEEPS!

Some of our wheel molding-making and production tools are intentionally obscured in pictures because I'm not in the business of launching everyone else's "new wheel company".
[/quote]

It's not about launching each others wheel business. This is an open source forum I'd like to think at least. Sharing information is what this forum is suppose to be about (though it's become a catalyst for selling products lately). I try to be as open and honest about the processes I have tried so others can learn from my mistakes. And when others have done the same, I have learned a lot.

Things like how to make a good molds for things like wheels or some ideas of what blends of urethane have what properties I would imagine reveal some secrets, but would help a lot of people. Look at how many hubs we have on the market and how few that don't have slipping problems or just shitty urethane. Since the cost of making hub motor wheels are so high for you, maybe you could share any information so that others could learn and become as enlightened as you?

[/quote]

**1)** Imagine that you attend a trade show wearing an Abec 11 shirt and walk past a booth where someone is displaying what appear to be Flashbacks, Gumballs, and ZigZags. Then you see 83mm Flywheels, 90mm Flywheels, and 97mm Flywheels in a bunch of different colors on a Flywheel hub, and an opportunity to put "Your logo here!" A salesman from the country of origin comes out to greet you and has no idea whatsoever who you are and what an Abec 11 is. He starts to tell you what an awesome product he is selling and quotes you prices that are lower than what you can make your own wheels for, and at MOQs (minimum order quantities) less than what you can do for your own wheels. They sell to anyone and everyone at less than wholesale, as long as you have the almighty dollar. **Now tell me that I should teach these pricks how to make a better wheel. What sense of duty do I have to these parasites?** Do you have any idea of how long it's taking to sell off all the crap that has inundated the longboard market in this "race to the bottom"? Too long for some of us to even survive. I'm not bitter ;)

**2)**  There are some people who routinely come on this forum and intentionally deceive the viewers or just out and out lie about their skateboard parts. They can't even cop to basic dimensions if they're worried about how it may be perceived. I agree with you about what this "supposed" to be. But when I ask direct and pertinent questions and they are met with dodges and misstatements and are then followed up with the typical "kill the messenger" commentary, it's NOT particularly valuable to the community.   

**3)**  If it ONLY helped the guys in the garage trying bang out just enough to outfit their own boards, I'd do it in a heartbeat. 

**4)**  It's not that the cost of making hub-motor wheels is so high for ME. The cost would be high for most everyone else. And it's not that I lack empathy. Prototyping can be an extremely expensive path and one with no promise of success or a return on investment. So if, **and only if**, I think that it's a worthwhile venture will I open my wallet and get behind the project. I know myself. I like options. I like lots of urethane. Others want to skimp or take another path. That's fine. But I personally believe that I would be painting myself into a corner and forcing myself to solve a very unnecessary problem. If we had 26.5" to 29" tires and/or gears I'd probably be singing a different tune. But our street wheels are between 3.5" to 4.25" and we weigh what we weigh. I want most of my wheel to be urethane.

Great video, thanks @NummThumz for taking the time to document specs and edit the video. 

How do you guys think this race would have gone had the Carvon V2 board not had a 75lb weight disadvantage. My brother riding it is 250lbs. Moja told me he is 80kg(175lbs). 

The video Moja posted with the boosted 
, the carbon GT and raptor 2  totally changed when the 26kg(57lb) advantge was taken away from the Raptor2. Just say'n lol. 

And on the speed test where the Carvon board hit 35mph compared tok the raptors 29mph, my brothers board was even less than 50%. He couldnt even make it all the way back to park which was less than a mile away haha. Its only got 2.65Ah lipo since my brotjer wanted to keep the build under $700 hahaha. Not bad for a buget build.

It was nice having Luis swing by for a chat/tour/ride/wheel pickup. After getting some of the SuperFly's I had to finish up a conference call but by the time I was done he had already swapped out the 97mm Flywheels that were on his board with new 107's. He's got a collection of components that work well together and allow him to change/test different configurations quickly and easily. I'm pretty sure than he kept the same wheel pulley spec so as you could imagine, the 10mm wheel diameter difference was more than a 10% increase in the top speed potential over the 97's. I would expect that there was a reduction in torque, but I hadn't tried it set up with the 97's on board. There was plenty of acceleration from a dead stop and I never fully tested the high end because the first time I'm on someone else's board I don't like to hammer the throttle and roll the dice. It was plenty fast and felt solid every step of the way. The Ronin trucks turned well - somewhere between a Liquid and a Fyre. Because of the idler pulleys and 15mm pulleys system, the belts could be run fairly loose and still provide excellent tooth engagement when accelerating and braking. It free-rolled better than I expected and to the surprise of NO ONE, the wheels felt super fast and smooth and well behaved in the turns, over crappy asphalt, up and over driveway transitions, and other imperfections in the road.

I'm pretty impressed with the battery enclosures (plural) and the wheel pulleys that he made. The FOC BOX and 6355 TorqueBoard combo performed well together. I really enjoy getting a chance to ride everybody's projects. Keep 'em coming!

I appreciate that. I really do. Sadly it's a modern day reality. It is VERY expensive to do business in Southern California and (price-wise) it doesn't help that we're near the beach and in a decent neighborhood. Knowing that these companies exploit workers, do no R&D, and make such a poor product and yet make a bunch of money off of my designs is a bitter pill to swallow. But hey, I'm supposed to be "flattered", right? 

So I try not to get mad ... and think hey, it's time to get EVEN. Sometimes I wish that I was more motivated by money and was a better business man than I was a skater/designer. But my heart is in building an objectively better mousetrap. And as long as I can keep the doors open and the lights on, I will occasionally be able to bring that "holy f*(# the is feels awesome" kind of smile to the face of a fellow skater and know it's all worthwhile!

The probably have a bigger stator than the r-spec ghost motors. I was looking at them yesterday, and their stator is pretty large. If you rewind them to 80 kv or so (like the v2.5's were), I bet you might beat the raptor 2 on a dual drive.

Everyone needs to forget about @ChrisChaput  and his fake DNA containing green wheels. I snuck into his factory last night and found wigs. WIGS. Not even REAL HAIR. How THE FUCK do you expect to have SERIOUS PREMIUM performance when there is fucking WIG hair in the wheels and not GENUINE TAINT HAIR?

This concernered me, and it also concernened my freind @chaka who actually called me yesterday while sobbing softly over this travesty. After a few "there theres" and some words of encouragement for each other, we decided that the world has had enough of non-premium wheels. 

Therfore, we are releasing the WORLDS FIRST MOST POWERFUL VIP CLUB PREMIUM LEGENDARY wheels:

From trying many wheels more urethane has ALWAYS been better.  Kegel are so bad for my riding style can, can't even walk after a ride. Once you go faster over transitions and unexpected potholes you want bigger wheels. Abec 97s are really good for most of my rides but, even 97mm to 107mm there's is a noticeable improvement of ride quality. The thing that impressed the most is the reflex formula, it just rolls and rolls, might even get better milage. Will drop a tooth to get same final drive ratio to get some of the torque/brakes back. Probably have to sell all my other wheels.


Matt, Dave would have bought these wheels regardless. More Urethane>Less Urethane 😎

My picture would be similar except you'd have to replace tho 90's with clones, which do not even compare to REAL Abec 11 wheels. I was surprised when the 107's felt  even more cushy than the 97, 75a's. When you take the "Donuts and Burnouts" class from @ChrisChaput let me know. I need to learn, too.

After doing extension research in the music business, I've come to realize that the "White Album" sold very well and that the "Orange Album" would not have. Now if you take the AC to charge up your DC and remember why "these go to eleven" (obscure Spinal Tap reference), then surely we should be "back in black".

I think that we'll be using black cores in the near future.

No, no, and no. It's a 90mm wheel. Jason was putting an intentionally deceptive picture on here trying to get people to believe that the urethane depth is over 19mm when there is only a tiny fraction of the wheel's width where it is that deep. It's a small section toward the outside edge of the wheel near the cap. The "can" is fluted and varies somewhere between 63mm and 70mm in diameter making the depth of urethane about 10mm over the raised areas of the flutes and about 13.5mm in the sunken areas of the flutes. The entire inside edge of the wheel is at its shallowest.

The urethane is only 19mm deep between the fluted can and the end cap above.

It's not 90mm. It's 115. I measured it. At least the rear wheel with the hub.

I actually measured it twice. Once as metric (11.5 cm) and once as Imperial (4.5 in which converts to 11.43 cm). Measuring twice give me confidence that this was the true height of the wheel and not a mistake.

So you're telling me that it's an inch larger in diameter than the 90mm front wheels right next to it?
You're saying that it's way taller than a 107mm Flywheel and he's top-mounting them on a deck with what ... 1" risers?

Wondering about that myself, but Moja was talking more about the type of urethane. He told me it was high rebound urethane on the production version. There is a guy on the .club site that got a production board. He weighed it and got almost the same weight that I did (close to 11kg). I asked him if he could measure both front and rear wheels to give us another data point.

There is a problem with this picture. We can't see the whole wheel, but we can see half of the wheel. It's has only a 1.75" radius per your picture which equates to 3.5" or 90mm.

Check out the video I recorded at the event in Long Beach. The deck length and width is spot on for what is on the R2 website. The wheel height does not seem to be the case. Contact patch width matched what was shared before in this thread. Unfortunately, I did not measure the front wheels. They looked to be the same size. In the video, you can see a riser when I am measuring the rear wheel, but I don't think it's 1 inch.

From the raw video. Unfortunately, there is this black rubber thing on the end of the measuring tape. There's a chance that the metal thing that hangs over the edge is part of the expected length of the tape.

I measured it when Moja came to SF this past weekend.

The inside is 11mm and the outside is 19mm. That 19mm is only the lip,

The entire wheel is 11mm thick. So thank you @onloop for trying to deceive the world once again. If you just stopped these childish games, maybe I'd even buy a raptor 2 for a back up back up board. Power output is nice and the ride quality felt decent. But we only road on perfect roads, so...

90 - 11 - 11 = 68 mm can, which makes sense now.

Since were talking about rubber. Each motor was at 132 F when measured, with flat ground riding. The urathene was very loose on the wheel. Moja seemed to believe theirs no way it could come off. Idk, but I could fit my finger in between this gap of the can and wheel. the size of the lip is less than my finger, so I believe it could stretch over this lip. Defiantly low duro stuff, which will stretch over time. Don't expect a long life from these wheels.

To be honest, I ride the Raptor 2 for a couple miles in the streets of SF and it wasn't that bad. Who knows how long the thane will last or go against rocks and harsh pavement, but while the ride was noticeably rougher than my 97mm 75a abecs, it was about on par with the ride quality of 78a abecs.

Well thats pretty much the same issue every single pair of hub motors I own has other than the Carvon V3's. Once the gap get the air in between it starts to create vibrations and often annoying squeaking noises as well.

Do the hub's get too hot?
[/quote]

Personally, I though they would get hotter than they were. It still can't compete with a belt driven motor in terms of heat...

Inspiration to do like i did - make your own modified wheels for your hubs :grinning:

And yes - of course they will hotter, and the acc. is slower due to the increased diameter of the wheel (also top speed increased, and brakes are lighter).

And the hub probably will die, but now Im able to race on gravel 👍

We need a dual 6374 belt drive to go head to head against the Raptor 2!
[/quote]

i'm rocking dual 6374, 12s4p, 15mm belts, 15/40 pulleys, with superfly 107mm, but babying it due to burnt out bms.  for this reason haven't experienced it at full 50v charge yet.

when bms is replaced tho, expect a full review.

Urethane is a poor conductor of heat. So if the wheels are bad quality it doesn't help if heat can't be drawn away from the motor.

If someone is getting a raptor 2 in Sweden I could race with my dual 6374 for a comparison video.

I am in the same situation. I don't have route options to avoid various rough surfaces. Try Chain Drive.

Sooo...all of the information he used here he basically stole from arguments he opposed in previous theads. Then, He promotes the use of chaindrives because that's his next big thing.. Proven already that steel stretches more than belts. Requiring replacement or adjustment more often. 

You know what though? I don't give a shit anymore. If people are stupid enough to buy into this bullshit. Let 'em!

I've got a haloboard (dual hub motors) and going over the seams in sidewalks is jolting. The only place I ride now is on the smoother asphalt streets in my neighborhood.

The wheels are 83mm, 78a.

Are there any sleeves for the wheels that would absorb the jolts better? Or maybe a better suspension system? Haloboard support didn't have any suggestions.

You would need better urethane covers on the wheels...but I guess you cant get them anywhere :/  So you can try to make them yourself, or buy some thick vibration dampening risers, maybe add layer of cork on bottom of your deck (like loadeds tesseract)...layer of flax composite could help a bit too, but it is a bit pricy....
Or buy flexy deck :) vanguard for example :)

Thanks, I might put some spongy grippy pad on top and put my feet more on that when riding over concrete sidewalk seams/cracks. The board has raised edges to I can maneuver my feet around to use the edge or use the spongy surface. I don't know yet what the best options are and would prefer a wheel cover. I'm debating 3d printing a wrap for the wheel with some durable filament (TPU?) but I don't know how long that would work if at all.
