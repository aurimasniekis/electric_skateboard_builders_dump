Hey. Im wondering if having the belt tighten strong will damage it overtime or something ? 

Or should i have it a little bit lose. Not sure.

Also now that i tightened the belt is kinda getting warmer not sure if that was happening before or if this is something to be expected. 

Thank you

My rule is as loose as possible without skipping during hard acceleration and braking. Overtightening will lead to the motor working harder than it has to, meaning more heat and stress. Wider belts can afford to be looser than thinner belts.
