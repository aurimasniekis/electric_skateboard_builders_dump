```
I designed a 59th slave pulley for my Hypa Rims.
The test 3D print came out very well.
Next step would be to cnc them.
For now I don´t have Superstar Rims, but I want to make the pulleys fit Superstar and Hypa Rims.
For this I need the distance from the center of the rim to the center of the screw (the marked distance in the picture below)
Would be great, if somebody with Superstar Rims could calculate that distance for me.
In case somebody interested in the pulley files just PM me, I´m ready to sent them over, no problem.
