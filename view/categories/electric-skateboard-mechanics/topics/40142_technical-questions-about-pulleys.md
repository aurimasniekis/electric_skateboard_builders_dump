For a **15T**, **8 mm** bore, **15 mm** wide motor pulley:

**1**. Steel or Aluminum (??) 

**2**. with Overhang, or without it (??)

**3**. with Flanges or without them (??)

**4**. Keyway or not (??)

**5**. Screw(s) inserted in groove or on teeth (??)

**6**. Which of these three screw options is better...  

**a**) 1 x M4 screw
**b**) 2 x M4 screws

What's the question? Which one you should use? 

It all depends on which one you want, or works for you. Steel is stronger than aluminum, but more expensive. It's just a motor pulley.

I will never Go for these aluminium ones with the set screws in the midle again. These threads strips soo fcking easy

Missing an option, keyway
I only use key and loctite, no screws

Green loctite on shaft and key, pulley will never move, will have to be punched out or torched to remove

1. Steel
2. Either or, I use without overhang
3. Atleast 1 flange (2 is better)
4. Keyway
5. In groove is better, in teeth is fine too
6. 2x M4 and some red loctite

oh also a 15mm pulley is also always a good choice (more room for expansion in the future)

What about just bearing retaining loctite (no screws, no keyway)? 48hrs curing time!
I know some people swear by this?

Apparently it's what it is made for.
I am waiting for me to finish my enclosure and I will be able to report back if this works.. (or maybe not if if doesn't..)
I remember someone from the forum who I had absolute confidence at the time telling me this,
Also when I took apart my first garbage lead acid cell board the pulley was stuck on the shaft like this and was only removable with extreme heat.

It works, but have a pulley remover tool on hand when it's time to remove. Another option is to grind a flat spot and use a set screw, or two.

And some serious heat. I have an electric plastic welding gun, (like a hot air gun) so temperature without the flames!
I've removed one without a puller, just enough temperature to break it down.

exactly. my way of mixing some loctite into superglue is not recommended but it is SUPER permanent, heat and a pulley wonâ€™t even get it off. A key and keyway are still 100% necessary if you go this route

The new ones I have at the minute are aliminium and have overhang on one end,it makes it so much easier to remove with a pair of pliers!
The bigger the M screw the better,the small ones get stripped easily and a small allen key will just bend if you've used loctite!

My 2 boards are setup like these. 
Don't move unless a torch is used.
(Edit).
I use strong (red) "loctite" from hobbyking, sk3 motors, and steel pulleys. No holes, no keys, nada. Just the red liquid and 24 hours for full cure.

680 for pulley

LOCTITEÂ® 680 Retaining Compound is ahigh strength, high viscosity room temperature curing adhesive used to join fitted cylindrical parts. It fixtures in 10 minutes and provides a shear strength of 4,000 psi. Capable of filling diametral gaps up to 0.015 in. (0.38 mm). LOCTITE 680 allows relaxed machining tolerances, and replaces clamp rings, set screws, and snap rings. Gives best resistance to dynamic, axial and radial loads. Recommended for retaining shafts, gears, pulleys and similar cylindrical parts. NSF/ANSI 61 Certified. ABS Approved.
```

Read the docs.

680 is for Loose Fitting / Slip Fit, 0.35mm diametrical clearance, High Strength 4000psi, High Viscosity.
648 si for Close Fitting / Press Fit and Loose Fitting / Slip, 0.1mm diametrical clearance, High Strength, 3800psi, Low Viscosity

Based on this data, I would use 680.

I had to remove a pulley on my old 6355 to remove it from the mount to make room for my 6374s and wow I needed an automotive gear puller to remove it, good thing I'm a mechanic I already had this but if not there was really no way to remove it when using locktite

As I said earlier in the thread I have removed one easily by heating with a hot air gun. It had a fine nozzle for directing the air. Absolutely no gear puller or hammers or chisels.
As a side note 680 isn't actually red in colour. It is greeny blue?

Well, it seems the red isn't good for pulleys at all, avoid at all cost. 

Use green 680 or blue for pulleys

I have no idea why people mess around with grinding keyways and using grub screws, its not needed. It only has disadvantages over a retaining compound. The stuff **WILL** hold the pulley with ease and is easy to remove. There is so much misinformation on these forums, by people who dont read instructions and dont do proper research.

**What i do.**
Lightly sand spindle for a few seconds.
Clean the shaft and pulley with a degreaser.
Smear some retainer around the shaft. Slide on the pulley. 
Now leave it alone for 30mins plus, go work on something else dont be tempted to mess, let it set. 

Maximum strength is achieved in 24 hours, half strength in just 30 minutes at 22c. I only gave it 2 hours, but read the instructions for your brand.

Its easy to remove with heat, with a hot airgun pointed at pulley and away from motor for a few minutes at 450c it will slide right off.

I use RS components own brand high strength retaining compound UK

If you have a key/keyway already, might as well use it, otherwise just 680 is good enough

[/quote]

So you suggest to mount the pulley with no keyway, just the RS pro R38 compound and that's it?

I tried to remove a pulley a couple if days ago it has some red loctite, when I tried to remove it I used a heat gun at 300C for two minutes, then a torch for 1 full minute, the thing was hot as hell, the pulley never moved a micron, even though I use 3 flat screwdrivers trying to pulley it out.

I had to remove the axle out of the motor and then hammer the hell out of the axle to remove the pulley, pulley went directly to the trash. It was a nightmare. 

I'm definitely doing something wrong, I bet the red loctite should never be used in this case, I felt it was even harder to remove after being heated by the torch.

Loctite 648 used on 6 (?) boards so far without any problems.
You have to reaaaaally heat it up before something comes loose again.
Great stuff! Other than that, there are a few other Loctite products of the 6xx series, that works the same way.

Yes, for the record its green, its probably identical to 638, the specs are.I was skeptical, but after reading what it is actually designed for i was convinced.

As for removing it, once it gets hot enough the compound will start to melt, you will see a bit of smoke and it will smell, then you know you arent far away from being able to remove it. I use a wide bladed chisel to then lever it off.
