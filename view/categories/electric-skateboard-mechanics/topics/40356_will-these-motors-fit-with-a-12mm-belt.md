Hey all,

Im just about to start a new dual rear build.

Will dual rear with these turning SK3 6355s: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6354-260kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html fit next to each other on a caliber 2 180mm truck with a 12mm wide belt? 

I realise that it would fit with a 9mm belt but would obviously use 12mm if possible.

cheers
Jake

It would be extremely tight. You could get some extra room to work with by putting some extra speed rings in between the trucks and wheels. if I remember correctly the Sk3 6354 motors are more like 6364 motors


Edit: If you can get the shaft length you can just take that away from 83mm as that is the total length of the motor including the shaft.

Yep easy and with 12mm belts. I think some people have been able to squeeze on 15mm ones but I can't gaurantee
