After some reading on here I picked up some Caliber II 50s.  The axels are a little crooked.  Im wondering if this is normal.  I took a video of what it looks like.  Has anyone else experienced this much wobble?

I noticed the same thing on my brand new Paris trucks.

I wouldn't be surprised if they come that way brand new. Anytime you buy cast trucks. they are cheap!
You could get a set of Caliber precision trucks for about $350 Bet those would be straight.

The prescision trucks look nice but I do t think I can stomach $330 for a pair.  I'd rather make my own for that kind of money

Caliber IIs have become the go-to esk8 truck because they are easy to design clamp-on mounts for, but I wonder how surfrodz would compare. They are precision trucks and you can get a set for around $180. They have a lot options for axel length and width, and color options. The only challenge is that there isn't (yet) a reliable supply of motor mounts for them.

Just checked out some of the surfrodz.  Those look awesome.  I might have to go with those instead.  Not having an available mount is not an issue.  I work in a cnc machine shop so I was planning on making my own anyway.  

Thanks for the tip

I designed and built a Surf-Rodz TKP Hex mount.... And have access to a CNC...

Also, Surf-Rodz are only $99 for full color. Or $89 for raw.  And they come with bearings, bushings, and precision spacers.   I really have no idea why Calibers are so popular.  Almost all cast trucks are bent out of the box, btw

So the surfrodz came nice and straight?

Calibers are popular cause they are cheap and with a standard shape, so it's not a problem to design motor mounts.

@jmasta any chance you could design a mount for the RKP Surfrodz?

I have them and the Caliber trucks always have them. Something to expect when casing hot aluminum to steel rods resulting in different rates of cooling. I assume the steel rods are straight when placed in the mold.

Yeah definitely.  I am testing my SZ TKP Hex mount right now.  TKP is ideal because the hangar has a constant cross-section.   But I could make an RKP mount too. I've been riding both versions for years, so I already have multiple sets of each truck
