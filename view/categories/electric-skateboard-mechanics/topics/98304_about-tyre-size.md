Hi all,
I am going to upgrade my eboard and I need an advice about the size of the tyres.
Is it better 8 or 9 inches?
With 9 inches I need  more torque or is it near the same as with 8 inch tyres ?
Thanks in advance.

I canâ€™t really answer your question, but Iâ€™ve seen a lot more 8in options than I have 9in when shopping around for tires ðŸ˜‰

Assuming you are using the same pulley.  The smaller the tire the greater the torque and lower the top speed the higher the efficiency.  Again you can always swap out the pulley to balance the torque x top speed.  If you want to offroad I'd stick to 8.
