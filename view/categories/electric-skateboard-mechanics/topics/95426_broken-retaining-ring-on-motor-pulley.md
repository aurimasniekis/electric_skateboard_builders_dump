has anyone else has this issue with the @torqueboards motor pulleys? the last one I had I ran for a little under a year and had this failure so I thought it might just be a fluke and this one has been literally only a couple of weeks. If I had to guess, a rock got stuck between the belt and retaining ring and caused it to sheer off but I feel like it would need to be exceptionally weak for that to happen. I will most likely just weld on a washer or something and I'll be fabbing up a belt guard. any input on why this happened and how to prevent it is welcome.

They're press fit on flanges. They do come off rather easily
