hi everyone!
I bought the modified enertion trucks, in order to use them with the dedicated wheel pully and motor mount.
I'm gonna use 1 motor on just one side, but the trucks are modified from both sides - how do I fill the gap one the other side ? a spacer ? another bearing ?

Saw some people use a spacer successfully, cheapest option.

Just use another bearing spacer on the other side.

This is the solution used for Enertion boards, so this is technically the actual solution. https://youtu.be/O1kqiC0hzVc?t=9m13s
