I hope that everyone knows what Motors I am talking about. Please only respond if you have actually used them and don't write that they are always bad etc.
Thanks
Edit: My bad I am talking about stuff like this:

Hello, but sorry what is the point of your thread? Mind giving more details ?

There's a shit ton of chinese hub motors out there nowadays and even more if you add the recent DD motors/trucks. There are even OEM motors available from brands, so I'm totally missing the point :thinking:
