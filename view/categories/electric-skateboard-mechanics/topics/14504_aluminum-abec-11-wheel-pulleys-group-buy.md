I am thinking of designing and making my own wheel pulley out of 6061 Aluminum and am wondering how much interest there would be for them, maybe i can make a batch late night next week instead of just one

I will be doing the CAD myself either tonight or tomorrow night. Ordering stock Tuesday/Wednesday. Milling starting Thursday, have them shipped by following Monday if anyone wants one. 

Anyone else interested? Cost will be cost of materials and shipping most likely.

E: Cost will be under $30, stock will be ordered tomorrow. Please see post 27.

I will be doing the CAD tonight. Pulleys are fairly simple. Shouldn't take me longer than 30minutes. 

Here's the main design points:
Abec 83mm flywheel, as that is the wheel I have.
Fit on Caliber 2 44deg trucks WITHOUT MODS as those are the ones I have
I am open to belt width suggestions as long as they don't interfere with the trucks. I was thinking 12mm wide. 

We all have to agree on number of teeth as I plan to buy a rod of aluminum and different number of teeth require different diameters. I was thinking a 36T pulley would fit perfectly on a 2.25" diameter rod. 

The width will depend on belt size but it ought to be around 3". 

Mounting will be done with #10 screws if I can find the tap for it, otherwise I will figure something out. 

I will try to keep it light but structurally sound.

@Lukas, maybe... If I do this right, I think I can have them done for $20-$30ish, if shipping is less than $15 to you, it might still be worth it.

We can chat later when the details are more hashed out. This is mostly to see if people would be interested and how much stock to buy as that would bring my coat down :slight_smile:

Most likely a 2 piece, but if it fits snug enough, the second piece might be unnecessary as long as I have a lock.

Yeah, if you have any CAD files you want to send my way it would be appreciated. I will still be cadding from scratch though on the flywheel. I think it'll be fairly simple and good exercise. CAD will be done tomorrow as we just adopted a puppy :slight_smile:

I would be interested in trying aluminum cnc ABEC pulleys.  @JuniorPotato93 designs have worked well for 3D print, you should take a look on thingverse. HTD5 9mm or 15mm tend to be easier to source belts than 12mm in my experience. 36T would be minimum for me, any happy to go 38T or 40T for torque.

I have some SolidWorks models ready to go for that.  It's a one piece model which I assume makes clamping it down a little trick so I was also going  to a just it for a two piece version where the pulley portion is exchangeable with different sizes.  Plus you can probably hold each piece more comfortably on your CNC.  

Though I have never worked with one personally so I'm not familiar with reasonable limits and processes for setting up and milling with a CNC

I've been working on this for a few weeks now.  I'd love to pool any resources. I have my own machine shop and CNC  where I am planning to build some. 

See my thread  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/solid-aluminum-pulleys/13618

I have totally remeasured some ABECs I got and have 3D mostly there in Fusion360 (killer free CAD/CAM) 

I settled on a 3 part design.  The hub washer,  the cone and the gear.  I am thinking it would be a better strategy to be able to change gears on the cones and  be more economical because it would waste much less gear Blank.  I am avoiding cutting the gears at this point because you need a special milling cutter to cut the splines as I am making wide gears too wide for a skinny endmill to cut the contours of the gear. 

 Sorry if thats hard to follow but thats the logic behind my approach.  If anyone sees an opertunity,  feel free to reach out.

I believe I never did get around to posting the cad models online, you had asked for it right? like as a reference. I'm 5 days away from finishing exams and once I'm free of school I'm gonna spend some tine and finish off the design I started and upload everything. I'd be interested in learning more about the CNC/Milling process as well if you wouldnt mind walking us (me) through how you're doing each part and so on. I realized I have access to the machine shop at the university and I may end up trying to make a set since I'd only have to cover the material costs but I really dont know enough about how to approach this to not hurt myself  or their equipment.

All,
So the puppy was being very needy so I didnt get much time cadding.
I came to the same conclusion as @mainstreet, that the best design to fit different gear sizes is to have a three piece design, Outer Wheel Mount, Inner Wheel Mount and the gear itself. 

The gear stock can be cut to whatever length belt you want and the number of teeth can range between 30T-42T, I can go even smaller if I use smaller screws, I just have to verify the loads and make sure we won't shear them.
There are no mods needed for the trucks as I've made the hole large enough to fit the Caliber 2 Trucks.

I will be uploading pictures later as I had to start work 4 minutes ago.

I will be ordering enough stock to make (12) 36T-15mm sets.
The cost is looking to be like $22 for the set + whatever shipping my way and shipping your way.
If there is enough interest in other sizes I will order gear stock for other sizes.
Stock will be ordered tomorrow so that I can machine stuff over the weekend.

So far I'm only doing 36T but the stock for other sizes is $100, divided by the number of people that want that specific size. 

Please reply with
Commitment, quantity, size, length.

I still need to simplify the fillets to make it faster to machine but it won't change much if at all...
To change the teeth number, remove the inner 6 screws and replace with whatever size under 42T...

Committed, 2, 38T, 15mm (no pulley for me if the numbers aren't there. just the core)

I plan on reducing weight, I have not done the full FEA on the part to see what kind of stresses/failure modes are possible.

I have another idea that might make this even lighter, but I need some time to see if its possible/affordable
```

## \#37 Posted by: PXSS Posted at: 2016-12-15T14:10:22.362Z Reads: 165

```
Update:
I am thinking that the best way to reduce weight is by having the wheel attachments 3D printed.
The PLA filament for my workplace printer runs about $30 a roll.
What I'm thinking is having clearance holes through both inner and outer wheel attachments and tapped threads in the gears themselves. All of the loads then go directly through the bolts so there wouldn't be much stresses on the wheel attachment.

The only downside is that the gear gets slightly more complicated since now it also needs to get tapped. Not an issue for me but it wont be as straight forward as just drill 6 x size holes...
Just came to mind that we could also do countersunk hole on the gear and nuts on the outside of the wheel.
What are your thoughts?

We either need to decide on a single Gear stock or wait on more people to order because as of right now we have:
2 38T
2 40+T
2 36T.
and I myself am good with any between 36T and 40T as my gear ratio is between 2.25-2.5
I am fine with anything.

5 mm (HTD)	Aluminum Alloy	 38T $117.45		
5 mm (HTD)	Aluminum Alloy	 36T	$110.22		
5 mm (HTD)	Aluminum Alloy	 40T	$124.95	

Cost will be divided per pulley, in this case almost an even 4way split.

```
These are just my thoughts on the topic but so far it's looking good. 

From a perspective of effective mass,  the additional weight of the aluminum spokes is nothing compared to that of the pulley with will be further out and have the same angular velocity but faster linear velocity.  The strength benefits of doing the whole piece in aluminum I think outweigh that of reducing the mass marginally especially where it's affects are not critical.  By whole I don't necessarily mean one piece,  the entirely aluminum based. 

You don't necessarily need to match the inside profile of the back of the wheel either.  The spokes do the alignment,  the rest is just there to support the pulley.  You could get away with removing material from the fillets and do a step instead of a slope.  Much easier to machine and quicker. 

That being said if you want to go with 3d printing then I would agree clearance holes and threading right into the pulleys is best. You'll have to  overshoot the tolerance with the 3D printed portion since 3D prints are going to be a little more sloppy than your CNC Iin terms of tolerance

larger motor pulleys are harder to find. and they can have some clearance issues.
 14-16t work well. So I would keep the wheel pulleys sized accordingly.

I agree with all of your points except for the fact that the weight difference is not negligible. Who aluminum setup weighs 1lb, so there is definitely room for improvement. What I did tonight was bring it down to only spokes and a 45deg chamfer to the full size, with only a large washer on the outside. I couldn't check the weight before I came home but I want to say it looked like I removed about 30-40% of mass. 

As far as 3D printed parts go, I know our machine usually undershoots by 3mils which I usually tweak up or down as need be since the material is cheap, we can afford a few iterations. 

Will post more pictures in the AM. For now, here's the puppy :wink:

@korryh, I've only seen the pictures on his website but am not really a fan of the design.  The only thing I like is the removal of unnecessary material from the inside of the gear. Will definitely finish design and start milling cores tonight.

@caustin, @Bender, so far you're the only 2 that want 40+T, 42T is as high as I can go.
The stock costs 125 for 40T and 132.50 for 42T. There is enough stock to make 8 gears at least. Do you want to split stock cost 50/50 and I'll send you all of the gears I make out of the stock.
Maybe someone else wants to jump in on larger gear sizes. @mainstreet?

There is enough interest in 36T so I will get that stock ordered tonight.
@cdn, @korryh and myself.
the length will be what you've asked for above. I will confirm later on too.

@IDVert3X: I can't imagine shipping to be more than $10-15USD

Here is a website that might interest you. They do 3D printed plastic and metal parts. I have no experience with them but I plan to look into their pricing etc. I wonder if you did a group buy of parts if they would ship to all the people that signed up. Or one person could order one and test it out first and then after (if successful) submit group buy. Just a thought.

Here is the final configuration, unless I find something wrong when machining.
The 36T weighs 0.27 lbs
The 44T weighs 0.33 lbs
(6) 6-32 screws hold everything together. the outer wheel piece will be tapped but you can add a lucknut on the outside as a jam nut for extra security.

And as stated before, the cores can take any gear that has the 6-32 holes

Great. Thanks. Forgot the length of stock, makes how many pulleys at 12mm versus 15mm?  Awesome.

200mm, we lose about an 1/8" for every pulley plus I'm making them 2mm wider than the belt just in case of any misalignment with the motor

Thanks for the offer but for €100, i can build 4 sets...In fact, we're making 12 36T wheel pulleys for 270 plus we still have some stock left

This includes the mount, premium belt, pulley, support bearing stainless bolts etc.

@PXSS

Would it be possible to include the screws?
I can pay extra for them.
It's a bit tricky to get non-metric screws where I live... 

@trampa

I got a motor mount from one of the group buys for 20€.
This wheel pulley will be around 20€ piece as well.
Then there is a belt ( 5€ ) and a motor pulley ( 5€ ).
That's a total of 60€.

Your set is 120€. That's 2 times more!

Was hoping we'd each get 4 pulleys out of it.

All of the 36T pulleys are spoken for!
So far it looks like we'll hit the mark on price!

Each core is coming right around $12
Pulleys cost will vary in length, it comes right around $1/mm which translates to $9 for 9mm, $12 for 12mm, and $15 for 15mm.
Guy's with 44T pulleys, your cost will be 69.75ea plus the cores cost.

The rest will be shipping!
USPS Priority mail for US and the equivalent for European guys, so $7ish for US and $15ish for international.

So far I have
@caustin 2 cores, (4) 44T 12mm pulleys
@Bender 2 cores, (4) 44T 12mm pulleys
@cdn 3 cores, (3) 36T 15mm pulleys
@mainstreet 2 cores
@korryh 4 cores, (4) 36T 15mm pulleys
@IDVert3X 2 cores, (2) 36T 9mm pulleys
@Brad 2 cores, (2) 36T 15mm pulleys

I'll see if there's enough stock left...
According to the spreadsheet I should have 6 inches left but it'll come down to what's actually left when I mill

Looking at the 3D I think with my tooling I would find it hard to accomplish this design. I'd live to see pics/video of the milling toolpaths etc if you are interested in sharing. #machinistporn.

@mainstreet, @JuniorPotato93 I'll be milling the first set tonight. See how it goes.
I do have a set of backup files that do not have the 45deg slope just in case it's too much for my bits or if the resolution is crap.
Will definitely get it recorded if I can find the shop cam. (I do not own a go-pro)

Well my boss kicked me out of the office yesterday before the gear stock arrived and said I wasn't allowed back until after New Years. So the project is on pause for now. I will try to sneak in next week and get the stock cut but it depends on when I get back from Florida. 

Update on the cores, the first one didn't work out too well, the slope had some fillets that didn't fit the wheel. I would like to have it be a one bit job as changing the bit mid job will get very time consuming. 

Merry Christmas!!!

Yes!!! I'm working on it as we speak!
Was about to update this thread. All the stock finally came in Monday but I hadn't had the time to work on it. 

Here are some pictures of the gear stock. 

I tried putting it on the lathe and drilling the 1" hole but apparently my large drill bits are dull, I got up to 5/8". I will go buy a new bit set in the AM and try again at lunch. Once I have that hole drilled out, the 6-32 taps should be fairly easy to do on the cnc mill (Stock is currently too tall to fit and I don't want to clamp the teeth!)

Hey all!
All the gears have been cut! I did not have time to take pictures but they looked pretty sweet! I did take some footage with my gopro while it was on the lathe but again I have not reviewed it.

I am going to be out of town the next 2 weeks flight testing in Arizona as one of our pilots got sick last minute and I am the backup. 

So what is left is to mill the new hubs, I've got a new set of ball end mills and I'll try to to get the old sleek desing going again but if It comes out bad again then I'll redesign without the slope and recut.

@PXSS
Hi, is it possible to leave at this stage?
Bought some in the meanwhile ( it was under 18 euros for both motor and wheel ).
If not I can understand it of course.

Or is anyone interested into 2x36T 9mm ones for dual drive?  It would be the best solution so I dont have to sell them later ( wasted shipping costs to me ).

Sorry it's taking so long. I was not expecting to be out of town all of this time.

How is your CAM and tooling situation for the cores comming along? Have you managed to cut anything close to the CAD yet?  I am looking at the design and I am so curious how it will come together. 

I'm super stoked to see the results.

Work has been way crazy over the past few months and this project kinda stalled. I won't hold anyone accountable to what they asked for since it's been such a long time but as soon as I have them ready, you guys will have first dibs at them and if you dont want them anymore, they will go up for sale...
