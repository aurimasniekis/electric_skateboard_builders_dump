I expect Andrew could build what I need right now with enough money.

I don't actually need AI. In fact it sounds awful in a robot helper. A robot that thinks for itself will have me pressure washing the front drive within a month of its inception, watching me out the window and judging me when my pants drop down slightly, showing 1mm of my butt crack, as I get down on my hands and knees to individually pick the weeks out because apparently pesticides are bad for the insects that can live through a nuclear holocaust. Judging all the time, withholding the small pleasures in my life and using them as some sort of currency to ensure my compliance. 

There isnt a single fucking weed on my driveway buddy. Not one.

That's good because true AI is still pure vaporware.

We currently have better automation, not thinking machines, and won't for awhile.
