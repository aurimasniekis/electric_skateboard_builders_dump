I was been happily riding a Globe Maiden deck until I noticed my ride getting a little sloppy in the back.  It turns out the deck started to split in the back likely due to the tremendously bad roads in DC.  If you’re a new builder looking for an urban commuting deck, steer clear of a flush mount.

Nowadays posts that contain neither fire nor broken limbs don't justify "OMFG" anymore.

I don’t think flush mounts are necessarily a problem, but.....

WTF is that deck made out of?

The deck cross section looks like a mdf board :joy:, guess they are skimping on materials.

Ha, yeah... when I bought it, I thought it said 9-ply maple.  I just looked again and it says, 9-ply maple _**resin**_.  :roll_eyes:

So, perhaps the lesson here is to pay attention to what your deck is made out of.

Looks like some thin slices of wood mixed with peanut butter

Yeah, the peanut butter makes for a smooth ride.  Can't use crunchy though.  It's the worst.
