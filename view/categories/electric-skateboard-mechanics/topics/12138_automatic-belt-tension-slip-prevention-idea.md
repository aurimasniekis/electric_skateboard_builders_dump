Here's my idea. As our belts get used or even warm up they stretch and frankly mounts can move. We want the best tension. Not too tight not to loose. To tight and they bind or stress the motor. Too loose and they skip teeth. Also if the motor pulley is smaller it skips teeth because the belt is making less contact with it. Well if we designed a tension pulley with the right or even adjustable spring load all that would be solved. You could even grip the belt more with the motor pulley making a more serpentine effect. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/2/2269485b59fcdaa67f34f0d239346bfaa5678a6b.png" width="690" height="431">

It's called an 'idler' and it's used on a couple builds on here. Ollin's new mount has a spot for one as well.

Actually it's called a tension pulley lol

@Lsalt @Jinra

I haven't seen any with actual springs to tension the board though? Does @chaka use a spring to tension the idler?

I thin if someone can make one that attaches to an enertion mount, I'd buy one I actually kind of need one right now for a small build. Lol

You wouldn't need a spring, you can adjust the tension on the idler by the position.

Yes I know but a spring would allow for skipping that adjustment step and just always have the perfectly tensioned belt
Plus adding another mechanical step would look sweet and over engineered haha

you still have to adjust the tension correctly for the C distance. I think too much tension from the idler and you'll end up having a belt too tight anyway. The only time I see an idler being a benefit is if the belt needs to be moved out of the way of something or if your motor pulley is too small.

I suppose you're right.

I'd still like to see it anyway. Someone do it lol

Just like a tension pulley on a car....that was my thinking. IT could be done to make the perfect tension. I'm back in the game! JINRA was hatin lol jk

Do it man! It's your idea do it before someone else does it and you get mad that they stole it. 

Cuz you know if someone else doesn't it you'll get mad ;) hahah it's happened to me before.

I use an idler on all my builds now. so good. worth it.
i don't see the need for a spring. keep it simple.

Yeah id like to see pictures of the spring. 
I feel that a spring just wouldnt provide enough tension under load.

Wouldn't a spring loaded have the opposite effect you'd want by loosening when under the most stress which is braking. What @lowGuido has looks great.

No, not if the belt is sufficiently wrapped around the motor pulley and the movement of the tensioner could be limited.
```

if you are limiting the movement of the tensioner, why not just just have it fully rigid?
the way I see it, once its set to its optimum position tighten it and keep it there. 

I'm still keen to see pics of this spring system though

I think I've seen spring tension system somewhere.. though I would still love to see how this works / looks on an e-board :)

Great idea. Just like 3 wheel bandsaws though this will definitely suffer from accelerated belt wear due to tighter radius's that it's going around. I'm going to stick with #25 chain for my build.

nice and simple implementation, well done

how tight do you tension your belt with the idler? Looks pretty tight in your picture, is this still necessary?
```

Its not real tight.
If anything its a little less tight than a belt without the idler.

Hey, are you still using idlers and what what kind of screw did you use 5/16 or M8 with standard bearings?
