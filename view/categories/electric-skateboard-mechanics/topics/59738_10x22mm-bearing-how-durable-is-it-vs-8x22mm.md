I would like to hear from those who used 10x22mm bearings a lot and how durable it is vs standard 8x22mm.

I'm aware that it will wear out a bit quicker due to smaller bearing balls. I just hope the reduced durability is only by a small margin.

Yes, I know it is more likely to lock up if grime builds up, but that is not an issue for me as I regularly clean it.

I already have 4 custom made 3/8" bolts hence the question.

It has been my experience that 10mm bearings last longer, and have less slop.

However, when I was looking at bearing specs on VBX, all the 8mm bearings had slightly higher load ratings than 10mm, which I was slightly puzzled by. I was expecting the greater # of balls to mean a greater ability to disperse load.

In the end, I'm not sure there really is any appreciable difference or not.

I would recommend you to use bearings from proven manufacturers like skf or fag rather than those shit ones with fancy packaging
