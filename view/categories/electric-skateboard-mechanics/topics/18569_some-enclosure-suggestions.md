Hey guys, recently I've been looking for an enclosure that fits my needs and I came across a few good sources so I figured I'd post them here.

These 3 sites make a few boxes that would work nicely depending on the size you're looking for. Some of them are shock/waterproof too which is nice.

I have one of the elephant cases and it's pretty nice, came with foam to keep everything snug as well. I've also got one from PFC on the way. 

You can also find a few decent sized cases If you search for pistol cases on Amazon.
