At the start the idea was a chromoly tube chassis e-board with adj RKP truck angle mounts. In speed testing tuning tilt steer ratio is a must along with reducing board twist.![IMG_20170513_073717966|281x499](upload://aVwyt3emVnvYh8Km8GTMLvaFpdb.jpg)![IMG_20170513_073731963|281x499](upload://nHKYcG7HriFcRCF7AXIb4Pq64ls.jpg)![IMG_20170513_082355632|690x388] ![IMG_20170513_082411840_HDR|690x388](upload://mls7e6Izb31jlxy8LwFmt78R1jb.jpg)(upload://kRhuS7YVqq3ZsqMjlmUTlU8qQU.jpg) ![IMG_20170513_082355632|690x388](upload://kRhuS7YVqq3ZsqMjlmUTlU8qQU.jpg)

On the single motor setup, truck walk was prominent under braking and acceleration made life over 30mph interesting. Eliminating truck walk became the next priority.. A widened axle to accommodate dual drive. The first rendering still used a kingpin and traditional bushing ![IMG_20170521_161122676|281x499](upload://cd7ewJDDafVWmNT3q41Po9rZySl.jpg)    ![IMG_20170702_165940912|281x499](upload://4RnwcazVEP6zpOILZ8fLdqGtDxR.jpg) ![IMG_20170702_170005557|690x388](upload://zR2PLl8Rz9cF9YbbD2zkUo0jzsw.jpg)

will they work w hubs? can the axle be torqued without it locking up or effecting the steering?  I still don't understand how these really go.  some of those rods are squishy and some solid it seems.

Next phase was to make an axle that was independent from parts. The idea was to incorporate the center spherical bearing with a mechanical connection to the axle and incorporate bushings that could be preloaded.   Being able to change axle width and re use motor mounts, rod pick-up points bushing clamp and associated hardware was a must have.![IMG_20170809_204935185|690x388](upload://ka1mN3gRwkxalwtmTMWyCDyfEGu.jpg) ![IMG_20180225_084456022_HDR|690x388](upload://770SZ9XNuCyodvYz4I9pR5DLsaZ.jpg)

Hubs are a definite plan for this setup. Counter rotation under acceleration and deceleration is zero. The radius rods and the center spherical bearing eliminate truck wind-up. Hubs are going to work bitchin. Can't wait for hubs..

Testing was going well, making stable speed near 64kph or 40mph "What about wood?"  What a guy I ride with said.  Same setup with some fabricated base plates. The width on the axle was determined by my drive system and the 100mm inrunners. If we used hub motors we could squeeze a 165mm hanger out of it I'm sure. The first wood bolt on set. Ride height, tilt ratio (deg), axle alignment all adjustable. ! That's a 4200w single that made 34.2mph on 8s at SPD1 with the neighbor kid Ian riding it.

hows the steel tubing board feel? i imagine it feels like steel and  i think that could be nice.  i like the look of most of the aluminum decks I've seen but don't trust them to not eventually crack but a steel deck with the steel rebound sounds pretty ideal.    steel tubing is pretty cheap i think but making it must take a lot of work.  looks really nice for the large part.  
i still don't get how it even is turning since it has those fixed beams holding the axle. 

those centrax 83 wheels?  have those if youre interested.

The cool thing about the 3-link system is that the trucks feel the same all the way through the turn. Unlike regular RKP trucks that feel tighter as you lean. Weird feeling but definitely smooth.

Current phase on the raceboard ended with a very wide 11 1/4" (286mm) axel to accommodate the 10400w motor and wheel upgrade for SPD2. The V1 tube chassis was outgrown and I'll proportioned to the wider axles and larger wheels. ![IMG_20171029_124603181|690x388](upload://6kD00WwytrBP2JyzvHM7MK0VS92.jpg)            In all honesty the V1 raceboard deck no longer had the leverage in a hard turn  to match the wheel grip and added axle width.   V2 raceboard settled with a 42" (1067mm) wheelbase and 11" (279mm) wide deck. The size change made for a more proportionate look and function. I was concerned about the wheelbase killing the turn radius but with the arm angles up it made easy work of the hairpin turn at SPD2. ![IMG_20171106_191511524|690x388](upload://dfskt1xk5pY4Bv2BBkrXl0AfXLE.jpg) ![IMG_20171113_081346|690x379](upload://jTfzFpJJtVDNtzAdP6376oaSy07.jpg)

Dry lake bed speed testing with the NKP 3-link. Set-up entailed lowering the rear bars flat reducing rear steer to 2 deg. Also lowering the front bars to 20deg reducing front steer. Bushings again we're not desirable as in SPD1 but we're a harder Duro for the dirt surface. Set-up made a successful 54mph radar pass. Unfortunately  the rear drive wheels broke traction at 57mph and ended our day. ![IMG_20171205_063044|690x469](upload://z8VquuICK5D61znwSUyKac18iIi.jpg)  https://youtu.be/MwTvFOd_V6E

Can not wait to see the feedback from the DH guys on these MoeBro!

I have my fingers crossed that because the bushings are set up directionally along the axis of the axle they will handle the latteral load of sliding in a smooth and predictable fashion. The reported linear lean/turn response I think already points to this being a possibility.

Exciting times Bro, can not wait to see what comes next. Stoked with development so far, This is the best news story getting around :muscle::smiley:

Just so I'm sure I am understanding...

On the front trucks do the swing arms essentially you to have mondo loose trucks without having to worry about wobble?  Does it do anything for the return to center?

I'm always amazed by the stuff you do.  I'd have to wear a diaper to go as fast as you do :slight_smile:

Front and rear truck perform the same steer effect as a TKP or RKP truck. NKP 3-link is a mechanically linked steering system.  No play or slop..  the tilt to steer ratio is adjustable at either end, just like changing the baseplate angle on a conventional precision truck. On the video I backed off the bushing preload to illustrate truck articulation.

I probably think about this design way too much, really quite interesting.

Does it really need the two ‘radius rod’ links, would one suffice? Seems the main spherical bearing would constraint all translational degrees of freedom, and only one radius rod would be required to maintain the rotational arc. Could be missing something here, but that’s how I have it’s working figured in my head right now.

That’s not to say I can’t see the benefit of having two arms from a stiffness/robustness POV.

NKP gravity 3-link. In a satisfactory place with the bushing setup. You can now dial in your bushing feel to a specific durometer, adj the preload to fine tune and it locks out wheel bite. We accomplished this by making a two stage bushing. Stoked!  ![IMG_20180329_052309|424x497](upload://k60cmO0hupgyk2vsNfM4tYx1oXp.jpg)

Is it very noticeable to be pivoting from the axle height verses within the baseplate? OR closer to the deck? I would think the tilting at the axle would create a tipping over sensation due to side to side movement of the deck over the pivot. I'm curious to feel these things..

I think probably its largely just visual. Since this design is all skeletonized you can make out the movement a bit more.

Its going to be rakeless, so the tippyness feeling is probably going to by typical of a rakeless truck.
The height of the deck from the roll axis may be a little bit taller ( but maybe not, can't tell for sure ), but it won't be more than a similarly tall RKP.

I have them set up split so the front turns more than the rear based on the base plate pick up points.  They are in theory rakeless but they are much more lively than any rakeless truck I have ever ridden.

If you have 6 months or more to work on this then yes, knock your socks off.  It is not an easy or intuitive design to work with at least for me.

I'm not expecting to make anything ridable, just something that moves in the same way so that I can talk about it.
Very dumbed down, oversimplified, not even with any bushings or anything.

Looking good MoeBro :dark_sunglasses: 
Are you going to run the (your) narrower "street" wheels or are they just for mock up?

Options open. On the abrasive epoxy surface the Colorado track the harder street wheel would have performed better. We will see what wheel is better for the K-1speed kart track that will host World Cup.

![IMG_2823|375x500](upload://bcgGwpOmHbT6q4oe9tTroZS15g4.jpeg) 

So I've made my model finally.
I had to make some knex spherical bearings to get it to work.

But there's something really cool these trucks do, something I've been trying to get to work by other means for a very long time. 

They don't have a static pivot angle, its progressive. The farther you lean, the more responsive it gets.

I've messed with different configurations and I'm not sure exactly whats contributing, but it seems like there's  flexibility to make it REALLY progressive. It could be possible to have a truck that is effectively 0 degrees when you're going straight but then at a full lean it could have a 60 degree pivot angle. 
Or at least I think, I've been messing with this for hours and its really late so I could be smoking crack.

But the application for this progressive pivot angle is really that you compromise less between turning radius and stability.

I think I know how to easily pick up on what the pivot angle is when the deck is flat/going straight.
![IMG_2826|666x500](upload://rBIjSBazRAc0UWntOicLlcLqxMK.jpeg) 
From a side view, a line from the axle spherical bearing to the baseplate spherical bearings makes up the pivot axis, the axle travel runs perpendicular to that. 
There's no real good side views posted here, but the pivot angle at center on every setup seems much lower.
Of course, since the pivot angle is progressive, what angle you start at can go out the window pretty quickly.

Hopefully I'm not too off base, but the more I look at these things the more potential they seem to have.

There are likely several ways to accomplish that, the flat panel welded to the axle clamp locks out any axle torque

Once you have it down it takes about 5 minutes to swap out and setup bushings. A hanger width change would be the same time 5min. Ride height adj takes another minute. Change steer ratio and set track 2min. You can also adj your motor clearance from the ground or deck 2min. Can be set-up for carving 9' circles or 45mph with a bushing and arm angle adjustment.

With some more dialing and tuning, it will be near perfect for go cart track racing. Quick turns, and I accelerate at a rate of 10 mph per second out of them up to 30 mph with little to no speed wobbles. Very interested in seeing how the upcoming k1 race will go!

Somehow I missed ur tagging me.  But u didn’t use these trucks w the motors or maybe they’re the same.  Was just riding them and can imagine how they’d be ideal for racing a tight course.  They really give such freedom and adjustability.  They scare me over 25 as they’re so free but can imagine when u get used to them or set them up right they are really just better.  They seem more stable on rough roads n cracks too.  
What’s with the version @Alphamail is riding they seem like a rkp or rkp version with the links going inward   How does that do?   I think the only thing holding it down is possibly manufacturing cost n aesthetics.  And then maybe it’d be worth getting someone who could model it in cad and do stress testing and figure if u could replace the baseplate w a cheaper and appealing looking machined aluminum.   Maybe could put the kingpin further away n leave room for the links on the inside if could be set up like that and maybe shorter.  The mechanics of it and the necessary length of the links I don’t know but if u don’t make a shorter slicker version I know people who will!  hopefully we could sell THAT with motors.

I'm absolutely in love with these trucks now! It takes some getting used to at first. But with hummie hubs and awd, you feel super connected to the road. Just lean into the turn and let the your body catchup. It's really a load of fun to ride. It handled some shitty roads in the presidio I wouldn't normally like to ride on pretty well.

What’s with the version @Alphamail is riding
[/quote]

150mm hanger,  short rod non powered version.  The short rod reacts quicker than the long rod like @evoheyax is on.  A ton of good work happened off the short rod 150. 
No real room for motors. Hubbs could happen. Would it be better? I'm sure it would make a cool closed deck board.  Aesthetics? Maaan, I just wanna go fast and make noise.
