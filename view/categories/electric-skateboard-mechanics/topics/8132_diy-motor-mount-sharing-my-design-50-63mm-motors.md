Hello guys, some people reached me in private asking for the drawings of my motor mount, so here it is

Unfortunately i don't have this version on CAD anymore since i made a few alterations

it's made for paris or similar trucks and they HAVE TO BE MACHINED IN A LATHE for this to work, reducing the hanger diameter to 18mm

The center distance is 70mm +- 4mm and works for 50mm and 63mm motor's

In this link you have the mechanical drawings and the .igs files so they can be made on CNC

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B64MF1WJuj0ycy0wcWNRQTl5WDQ?usp=sharing

This configuration is way overbuilt, but that was the idea, and for the next revision it will be easier to adjust the belt tension and have a lower mass

Depending on the thickness on the wires and were they exit the motor you will have to file the clamp so they don't get compressed and result in a short

does this slip over time? and roughly how much does it cost to get cut

Exactly, since the first time i assembled no problems, using medium torque thread lock on the screw and high torque between the mount and the hanger, probably 100 Km or more of rough pavement

If you use a pulley with a hub maybe, most of the pulleys are larger than the belts, in the moment i'm testing a 3d printed motor pulley that is press fit on the shaft, so no problems and still shaft left on the outside

weight of this unit won't matter. Even if it's double the weight of any others. Just go to the bathroom before you ride it if it's too much!

My board is borderline hitting 20 lbs. If I can save 1 lb here and 1 lb there, I'd be happy to get it down to 17lbs.

20lbs is hefty unless you have large capacity batteries and duals? I think my board is about 13-14 pounds (mono spacecell carbon deck)

Paris 195mm, but i think i will go back to 180mm to save a little weight, but first I have to check if I can mil the180 hanger without weakening it too much

So this mount wont fit the 180 trucks without modification?

Even the 195 you have to modify so the diameter of the hanger is 18mm all the way, the dept (how far from the start of the hanger depends on the pulley width and your wheel offset

Hello @Pedrodemio this is a super sturdy mount 
Really nice :-) 

Do you mind sharing the pulley cover file ?

Sure, in a few days since I'm not home, the holes for the cover are not inclu√≠ra-se in the design since I tough of them later

Only if you modified the clamp format

Note: this design is a pain to adjust belt tension, loosening the two bottom screws is not easy, and since i'm damaging a lot of belts due to rocks i've been thinking in re design it to be only two pieces and adjust the tension in a way similar to how chaka is doing in his new mount, using only the idler

I have them finished, but want to manufacture and test before  sharing, I scrapped the idle bearing idea, it only introduces another bending point that lowers the belt live if the diameter is not big enough. The final design only works for 50mm motors and I can mount dual 15mm belts o 195mm Paris truck with 5055 motors

Thanks, this is what it should like with the pulley cover and motor wires guide

I think it‚Äôs 12mm, a 1/2‚Äù piece should work but I need to confirm, I will assemble the new mounts this week and if everything works I will upload the files

Another thing is that in my opinion if you use them without the 3D printed covers on both side they look quite ugly because of the large radius
