Hi all. I wanted to get opinions from you all.

Ya'll pretty much all know I don't mind/enjoy bearing maintenance. But normally your board it's kept out of the wetness.  Well to solve that issue I started my Trampa(or maybe your pneumatic hybrid) so I could skate when it’s wet out, as urethane and wet don't mix with power to the wheels. Or maybe you built it to take a “dirtier” path then normal.

Anyway the point I’m getting to is bearing maintenance. With wheel hubs you have a space on the hub compared to a urethane wheel.

My idea is to make a POM or aluminum circular Flange, that can be attached to the end of the axle and inner wheel, with one of the Teflon slipping gaskets, to keep water and dirt off the bearings.

Cutaway type drawing:

What are your thoughts on this? 

Anyway was just thinking - how can I ride this on wet days,  without having to worry “my bearings are gonna rust because I spent 10 minutes on wet road, and don’t want to spend an hour servicing them every time they get wet”. So…how can I keep them from getting wet, or prevent wetness…

Would any of you use something like this? These sliprings seem to work well on @Nowind Drives for keeping water and dirt out of the gearboxes. And @Kug3lis new drives are sporting them as well.  Could we make our boards even more resilient to what we put them through? By doing something as simple as adding an additional seal to protect the most important piece of the whole assembly?

 I already use Double Buna Bearings. But once the Buna seals get dirty, water just magically works it's way inside. So what if you can prevent both from reaching the bearing? Teflon sliprings keep the surface they skate clean. Clean surfaces are hydrophobic. 

Idk... Anyway. Your thoughts below please ;)

I from time to time think about Waterproofing bearings but always am like NAH how Eh.
glad to see a sketch like this.

There are sealed bearing like in cars but they take thick grease so it won't spin as good on free roll on normal skateboard.

Yes, I've tried them the same results happen. Dirt builds up on the seals, and makes it easy for water to get in. While thick grease helps. I'm still thinking a secondary seal could make a world of difference. Especially since the outer races are also steel and will rust in the hubs?

I personally cleaned my used set of super reds and lubed them with teflon gun oil, rode them for 500ish miles with 0 maintenance before changing them and they still roll nice.

But in the rain/wet roads/mud? And were they done and needed replaced at the end of that 500, or were they still serviceable.

I understand that number in dry conditions just not so much wet?

Just to add to this. I normally don't replace bearings, because I'm a nut about having my bearings clean.

The Bronson g3's on my Evo have almost 5000 miles on them. They were on my Vanguard for about 4000 miles and serviced weekly, and have been on my Evo that has about 1400 miles now. These bearings never get wet, and if they do they get cleaned.

I'm trying to find a way bring this type of life to an AT/Hybrid/Mudder/Rainy day. Without also increasing the time I need to spend servicing....

Ok, so I've had this idea for a while... Its a little off the wall.

Hollow axles hooked up to an air pump which port air into the core of your wheels, and the positive pressure keeps water and dust from entering your bearings.

As far as the slip ring idea, its actually really easy to seal up the wheels on the outside.

So this is a dumb old picture, but I was playing around few years ago with caps that happened to fit on wheels.![IMG_2999|666x500](upload://n2H3qQ1RALBfK50AdUaKxg8yhCb.JPG)
I started with caps, but I ended up just capping wheels off with duct tape before I ended up dropping the idea.

But basically, you don't have to worry about a slip ring at all on the outside, because you can just bridge over the whole nut and bearing completely. 

So your idea would only need to apply to the inside bearing.

I'm also going to rep thick waterproof grease again.
Its really hard for rust to settle in on metal thats got a coating of oil or grease on it. But skate oils just do not hold up and have high wash out when they get wet, which leave with wet bearings that have lost their protective film of oil that prevents rust.

Schaeffers 274 is the bomb.
https://www.amazon.com/Schaeffer-Manufacturing-02742-029S-Synthetic-Grease/dp/B00JF2LBQ6
This stuff is more waterproof than you can believe.

And I'll also repeat myself and say there is no reason not to use thick grease on Eskate. You're no longer relying on only gravity for acceleration, you've got the power of a motor and the tiny bit of rolling drag caused by grease becomes almost entirely irrelevant.

Never rode my DIY in super wet conditions but the occasional puddle yes. They are still serviceable I was just lazy and threw in a new set but I still have them.

A flange would be nice but this would be only possible on the front truck when using spur gears. On the rear truck there is no space left on the axle because of the gear. 

I've heard about people who add thick grease outside on the bearings to pevent entering water or dust, but never tried that.

I like the idea with the grease of @CHAINMAILLEKID, I can imagine that a good grease won't wash out. Such a grease combined with stainless steel bearings should solve the problem.

E.g. MBS sells stainless steel bearings:

https://mbseurope.com/product/mbs-bearings/

I could post many links, just type "stainless steel mountainboard bearings" in google and you'll find some in your area. BTW I've seen stainless steel trampa bearings here but not at trampa's page :rofl:

Aren’t ceramic bearings waterproof? This is a great idea, but I also think that it would be more compact/less expensive to just buy ceramics

True but AFAIK they are not sturdy enough for heavy vibrations and impacts like on MTB, guess they would crack or break. But I never had ceramics due to this reason, for street it could be alright.

Yes, "full ceramic" are.  Those have ceramic balls and ceramic races.  Regular "ceramic" bearings have steel races and ceramic balls and are not waterproof.  There is a also a difference between "waterproof" (designed to work with water ingress) and "water resistant" (designed to prevent water ingress, but may be damaged by it)

I've had a full ceramic bearing explode because of that.  But until it exploded it was fantastic.  This is just one case though

Honestly, I usually change my bearings 3 or 4 times a year, usually every 1000 miles or so. The old bearings find there way into a gun oil bath for a couple of days and then get re-used. That's the sun if my bearing maintenance. 

I think a secondary seal is a good idea, but I would go further and say it's as least as important to keep oil in as water out. Not sure there's a way to do this with the current bearing dimensions.

I do think they don't ever need waterproofing if you put enough grease or oil. Oil or grease naturally protect your bearings from water. I've ridden my trampa in the rain alot and I also often wash them under the shower. So far I have never seen a rust building up.

I've used zealous bearings on my build, ride it heavily in rain, and have never noticed any damage. They seem adequately sealed and packed with oil, to the point of waterproofness. They also seem to be stainless steel and do not rust on the inner and outer race.

Zealous bearings actually do use a grease, and its one that's also formulated for water resistance.

They're going to be among the best OTC bearing for resisting rust.

Step 1: Buy 20 SKF bearings (Not Bones, except if you don’t mind paying triple the price for the same thing).
Step 2: oil them (prevents corrosion)
Step 3: enjoy your ride in the rain with no more friction from any useless shields, and if a bearing ever goes that bad you can notice it, just change it cause you were smart in step 1 and bought already 20 skf bearings instead of the overpriced 16pcs skate sets.

FYI We've got Boa ceramics coming to the market soon. Made with Silicon Nitride balls, ceramic grease inside, stainless outer casing with corrosion treatment and sealed with inbuilt spacer and speed rings.

We've put ours in a corrosion testing chamber against other brands for extended periods and the others all seized up. Happy to send a few sets out to heavy riders who want to test.

Think some here are forgetting, or didn't fully read the first post

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bearing-insertion-blues/45910

Trampa bearings aren't easily serviceable, not sure about other wheel hubs... 

Also the comments about how to maintain bearings.. @Nordle. Come on man.. really? Does my post count scream "noob"? 

And ceramics... While I've had them explode... I'm sure I will never see  ceramics for 28mm bearings. @captainjez.

 
Idk. I'll probably just make some of these with the SLA printer to test.

I only use SKF bearings, 2RS, rubber seal on both sides. I have more than 1000 kilometers on them, have ridden in the rain lots of times, sometimes with more than half a wheel under water

All of that without opening them to clean, and they perform as new. Yes, they have more drag than skate bearings traditionally have, but that’s because they have a grease that actually lubricate, not the thin oil that does next to nothing

If you would do competitive downhill they would be bad, since this little bit of drag could be the difference between wining or loosing, but for us, with lots of watts at the push of a button, it means nothing losing a few to friction and being able to not even cara for the bearings for hundreds of kilometers

[/quote]

Even then I suspect not.
You become bottlenecked by air resistance so quickly. 

I could see just maybe being a tiny bit of a factor in Luge, just because the effects of air drag take longer to catch up with the effect of bearing drag, and pushing off the start is a lot slower in luge.

Yeah, you can calculate the power loss of each bearing, SKF has a tool to determine the loss, I attached the results for a 608 2RS (dual rubber seal), it’s 3W per bearing at 35km/h on 80mm wheels, so 24W for all 8 bearings, for the standard metal shield, 608 2Z it’s 1W per bearings, 8W total

Corrosion X makes like a Air tool lubricant which might work for this application?  http://www.corrosionx.com/corrosionx-air-tool.html

I know the regular stuff is water resistant enough to run RC drones underwater https://youtu.be/s4z8QMgTEA4 and I'm surprised not to see it in use in the esk8 community, especially considering it can save components after they've already taken on water.

I'd be very interested to see how well it'd work as a bearing lubricant.

@Deckoz I fully support this idea. I've thought about this too, but haven't come up with a good solution, so I just try to avoid water, but that seems kind of lame when we've got monster off road boards, especially with limited bearing options. it's a lot easier for me to leave my urethane board at home, knowing that if I go out in the rain, I might die. LOL. but I shouldn't be afraid to ride my mountainboard because i might encounter a puddle. Sure, theoretically I could come home after each wet ride and tear apart my wheels and bearings but realistically I know that's not going to happen very often, given time constraints and life. So if there is a little bolt on bearing shield that costs a few bucks and takes pretty much zero extra effort to install for a little more peace of mind, and not heaving to baby your beast of a board, why wouldn't you want to do it?
