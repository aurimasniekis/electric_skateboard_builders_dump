If your looking for a 60T pulley for a mountian board in the EU @Idea is the man. There are a few vendors who offer the normal 32-40t pulleys for flywheels. The one you have linked is not 60T.

But it`s not a mountian board. It`s a "normal" chineese board with 83mm wheel. And the wheel pulley looks exactly like the one on the link, just with 60 T

But thanks.... i will get in contact with Idea :-)

A 60t htd5 has a larger diameter than a 83mm wheel. How should that work? If you use htd3 you also need a htd3 motor pulley

Your belt says 3M so it is a HTD3 system. These are not standard sizes. You might have more luck upgrading the entire thing to HTD5

What would pitch effect, does the belt have to be specific to it?

Do you mind give me a link to what i need to buy, so i can upgrade my system to HTD5. I know that the pulleys and belt, will need replacement after some time, so i like to be prepared, so i don´t have much downtime :slight_smile:
Thanks

Btw. What´s the benefits in HTD5 over HTD3, besides its obvious easier to find new parts.

of course.. if you look at the picture.. a belt with 5mm pitch distance would not fit a pulley with 3mm pitch distance and vise versa. 
if a belt has 100 teeth @ 3mm pitch it would be 300mm long, @5mm pitch it would be 500mm long.. same goes for the pulley.
