Well I just finished my second esk8 build, I spent all the money I had on it after saving up for a couple of months, built the deck myself, designed and 3D printed a bunch of the parts myself, only to watch it explode in a giant fireball along with my hopes and dreams. Please learn from my mistakes and double check everything, I don't even know what caused this to happen but it could have probably been prevented somehow... Having watched about $1200 of my money literally burn away in front of me, I think I'm pretty turned off from building another esk8 in the near future, but hopefully I can get back into it again when I'm able to find another job and save up for a while. I'm pretty dang sad. Anyway... here's the pictures and stuff:

don't get me wrong, you could still have a problem with a loop key. but atleast if you see smoke you can rip it out and isolate the batterys from the electronics, which 9 times out of 10 may just be what you need to stop it from going further.

I bought the pack but I don't want to point fingers because I bought it without a BMS and wired the BMS myself, so I probably screwed it up somehow. Live and learn I guess.

I was testing the board for one of the first times and when it happened I was going pretty slow on flat ground when I heard a pop and lost throttle control, I then saw the smoke coming out and backed away.

Trying to imagine what could've happened. You'd ridden it before you say.  I'm assuming it was the bms either improperly attached or not.  To have it go up in flames while not charging or even doing extreme discharge. Never see that
Were there a lot of pops?

I had ridden it before but only as test rides around my neighborhood, probably none of the rides were over a mile. This ride I actually took it up and down the street, going a little bit farther than I did before. I heard the first pop and saw the smoke and it took about three minutes before I started hearing more pops and then the burst of flames. At one point it sounded like popcorn/fireworks going off and the flames got pretty huge. Luckily no one was around though, and some neighbors were kind enough to help try extinguish the fire before the fire department arrived.

It went up in flames right in front of an elementary school :open_mouth:

Somthing must have shorted the pack and put one or more cells into thermal runaway. But what? Guess it's hard to know now. 
Makes cell level fuses seem like a real good idea.

Would cell level fuses really work?  I mean if one cell goes into runaway or gets punctured I just imagine the whole pack is going to go up just from the chemical chain reaction even without any electrical shorts helping to continue the fire?  I mean this sounds like it was started from some sort of electrical shorting going on based on the description of the sparking before the smoke but in the case that one cell is already going isn't it a forgone conclusion that the whole thing is going to go up in a blaze?  I have 2 5S 10Ah LiPo packs in a 3d printed enclosure on the bottom of my board (also wrapped them in some foam to give them some cushion from hard impacts) but I imagine if any cell goes the whole thing is toast... true? not true?

Anyhow agree with others here, really sorry for the OPs loss (I'm not quite sure how bad I'd feel if it were my board, but somewhere on the scale of very to extremely) but also hope we can all learn from it what can be learned.

I agree that if one cell goes there is already a lot of heat in the system but cell level fuses "should" prevent the first cell from burning. A correctly sized fuse should burn itself long before thermal run away current levels.

Yeah that makes sense. Wish there was some way to know what went wrong here, heck of a fire :frowning:

Cell level fuses do seem like the kind of thing that should probably exist kinda surprised I haven't ever seen that advertised on a battery.  Have seen some that at least claim to have low power IC built in though I've only seen that on the very small lipos really.  I guess manufacturers don't see the extra cost for the fuses and assembly worth it for the extra safety (would probably have to deal with people trying to replace their own fuses and being upset x brand has fuses that burn out and make the thing unusable whereas y is cheaper and they don't have "that fuse problem" :) )  Or maybe I'm just looking in the wrong place (hobby sites)

Were you able to salvage any of those parts?  The motors should be pretty water proof, did the blaze destroy the wires in the motor? if not those might still be in working condition, curious about the VESCs as well if you have a chance after you have some time to recoup would be great to get some more close up pictures of the aftermath to see if anyone can spot what might have gone wrong in the first place.

Manufacturer spec sheet show they put the cells through an intense shorting test and they always pass and no fire, but that single cell situation isn't realistic and we have many cells not a single.  A single will likely get hot but multiple feed into the heat and that's how one gets hot enough to hit runaway.  So I hear.

I bought a spot welded pack of samsung 25r batteries and wired the BMS myself

I tested each of the 10 cell points to make sure that the voltage increased by the correct amount but I didn't test that after charging / discharging (dumb mistake). I also wrapped the battery pack and BMS in tape to prevent any accidental shorting.

I used XT90 connectors and heat shrinked every single one of them

I used 12 gauge speaker wire I got off amazon

Like this? 

https://www.amazon.com/GLS-Audio-Premium-Gauge-Speaker/dp/B006JSMBZE

Yea I made the mistake of doing the same for my charge port. When my idiot friend inserted the loop key into my charge port shorting out the pack, all points where I used speaker wire burned and the copper melted, effectively acting as a fuse. 

The speaker wire insulation is not at all rated to tolerate heat so that very well may have been the culprit. 

Get good quality 10awg silicone wire, they're cheap and readily available on amazon.

First of all @oct0f1sh sorry this happened to you!

There are some things to learn for the community:

* We are all about safety and telling people to wear helmets, but we should also give more warnings about battery/fire safety. We are teaching people how to build boards on their own, and that is great, but everyone should be very aware that Lipo/Liion batteries can be really dangerous if not looked after properly!! If this happens when the board is in a house or apartment building unattended, things can get way more ugly than this.

* Make sure your enclosure mounting allows you to rip it off with your bare hands in case you suspect something is going wrong. This potentially allows you to disconnect everything, separate a runaway pack and prevent a fire. If its too late then get away from the board, a pack may explode in your face, reconstructive surgery is way more expensive than the parts on your board.

* If you do anything of the wiring yourself and you're not 100% confident about your own abilities then let an electrician or electronics engineer check everything before hooking up the batteries. 

* Always use a fuse or an over-current protecting BMS at the very minimum!

* Dont charge your board unattended. Ideally store your board in a place where it can not start a fire (i.e. concrete garage floor/wall, no flammable items nearby. Make sure there is a smoke detector where you store it.

Theres probably more to be added to this list. Stay safe everyone!

Looking at the photos that thermal runaway is as expected with a failed lithium battery. Best tip I have for everyone here that makes your own lithium-ion battery pack. Please cycle your pack a few time to ensure safety before installation. I doubt manufacturers sell completed packs without safety testing a few times. I made my 10S5P Samsung 25R pack and checked all connections, balance wires, and mains wire a bunch of times. Still, hasn't blown up on me. Accidentally over discharged it to 0.6 V  brought it back to life and held 4.1 V no problem. I'm not pushing my luck here because I know this can go south faster than my ability to rip the pack from my board and toss it to save the speed controller.

First off, this is sad, so sorry for your loss.

My strategy for dealing with batteries is to obsess an unhealthy amount all of the time about my house burning down. Then, I realize I'm taking all of the precautions I can and try not to let it bother my day. Worst comes to worst, I have a window for a reason, lol. I hate to through a 2k+ board out the window, but it'll happen if I see smoke.

Battery fires are no joke. I wish there were more members of the community selling custom battery packs.

Thanks for posting the updated pics, and yeah looks pretty thoroughly toasted... the one motor looks like it might be salvageable and I suppose the trucks and motor mounts maybe but probably not much else.  You might be able to tell which wires there fried due to short vs just being cooked in the fire but hard to gather much info from the pictures just given how charred everything ended up.

One thing that came to mind with all of this is having a small sand bag in my backpack along with regular tools might not be a bad idea.  From what I've seen the best way to mitigate a Lithium battery fire is to just rob it of oxygen and let it burn whatever is already going but stop it from spreading (flight test youtube channel has some good setups for how to create very safe setups with LiPos and chargers and that was their best advice for fire suppression with lithium batteries, typically a regular fire extinguisher won't put it out).  Problem I see with a removable pack is it's difficult to make something that is rigid and not going to fall apart on it's own but also has a good safe quick release that you can grab without thinking too much about it.

After skimming the thread a few things come to mind. The standout is the speaker wire. A fire like yours looks like a straight buss line short. A lot of components that fail will burn in the clear. A buss line short is high amp and violent.  I work as a high voltage lineman. One of the things that keeps us alive is using the proper material for the volt application. The gage for the amp is ok, what about the volt application. The casing between the two wires, how it was constructed and consistency and quality. Just a consideration. Sorry bout your build. Keep diggin.

.

Hey just a heads up.  That "Boom Stopper" from HK is only intended to be used while powering it on the first time to check for wiring faults.  But maybe that is your intention??  It only has a 2A fuse, so the fuse will blow instantly if used while riding

Something like this would be better: (available in 60A, 80A, 100A)

If you really want an example of high paranoia when it comes to causing any kind of a fire, marry the Fire Chief's daughter. That will keep you on your toes for life!

I was having a similar thought, you could wrap them in those fireproof bags you can get for lipo charging. It would add a little thickness to your enclosure. Having the batteries separated from the other electronics is probably a good idea too, even if there is a fire maybe you can save your speed controllers and other items.

I am asking my father in law if there is some domestically available fire retardant spray or chemical that can be used to treat Wood and or metal and plastic as components that I might use to encase the batteries while underway.  With the bags I worry about the accumulation of heat combined with the already excessively high ambient temperature of southern Florida outside during the summer.

My 4x3S lipos permanently live in individual "fireproof" bags, attached to the board

These guys have lots of collective knowledge and tips on LiPo safety:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobFcNzGG9I

I'm working on a 3D model for an enclosure for my LiPo cells with a Male connector sticking out of it so they can be slid into a bigger case with the female connectors in there for it to all hook up so I can quick release them, just started doing some test prints but I need to add some temporary supports in since I have some moving parts being printed together.  Will share the designs here once I get a printed model that works as a POC.  Since I'm pretty broke the OnShape models are all public anyway :slight_smile:

Hey @oct0f1sh,

Sorry to hear about your built, but glad to hear that it doesn't seem like you were hurt from it. I have a theory on what may have happened. 

Since you only rode your board a couple times for test, my guess is thermal build up was minimal and current was, perhaps, relatively low. Since you're using speaker wire which is meant to handle a mere couple of amps for audio signal and power, perhaps the large amount of amps pulled from the battery mixed in with the extended session and increased thermal buildup caused the polymer on the speaker cable to melt or become extremely pliable. At a certain point the polymer may have disintegrated so much that it exposed the metal speaker wire and shorted across the positive and negative leads.

I was originally surprised to hear about this happening on a spot welded 18650 pack, especially with brand name 25R's, but perhaps this theory is the reason your build went up in flames.

Well I guess there's a lesson to be learned that the cheapest part of the build could be what causes it to go up in flames... I appreciate you putting in the thought to this, next time I'll hopefully be able to avoid this happening again by buying higher quality silicon wire.

even the fireproof lipo bags will not fully contain an extreme Lipo fire. They just slow it down slightly

I'm looking forward to the day we have commercially available non-lithium based batteries with similar performance

I've seen some public broadcasting shows where they featured LiPo with some sort of solid electrolyte that could be stabbed or cut into pieces with scissors without catastrophic breakdown, not sure what all the challenges are to make it a viable replacement but sounded impressive on the tin.

That's pretty cool. I also read about this and a number of other "revolutionary technologies" for lithium battery tech, but I never see any of in commercial products. I wonder why that is.

You'd think companies like Tesla would invest heavily into stuff like this to increase the range on their cars or energy in their powerwalls

I'm sure they are working on similar research and development but with stuff that's already in place or going up like the giga-factory I imagine they want to use tried and tested things where they at least understand the tech and parameters rather than using something no one can really explain yet.  I'm sure some form of this stuff will make it into regular battery tech eventually.  The energy density of LiPos has gone up over the last 20-30 years from what I've seen with searching for some numbers 18650s from the 90s vs now.

I raced 1/10 scale electric pan cars on an asphalt oval track.
They didn't go very fast and didn't last for very many laps
We went full throttle around the track and the trick was to not run out of battery before the end of the race
