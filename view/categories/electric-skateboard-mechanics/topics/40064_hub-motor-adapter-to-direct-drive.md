I have been looking at the Carvon V4's a lot lately and it gave me an idea.  The problem with hub motors is what Carvon says, there is the wheel so they take they weight and you get much less PU for your wheel.  So I finally saw a pic of the hangers they come on and it got me thinking.  If one could produce hangars like those, you could take any hub motor, and then you would need to develop an adapter plate to connect to the outside of it, and you could run any hub like a direct drive.  The part the goes to the wheel is already made in many forms, you'd just need to machine one that is connected to a base plate that you can screw into the hub motor like you would the outside of the wheel if it were set up normally.

How difficult do you guys think that would be to produce / CNC?

This would basically just position the hub motor further in, allowing for the adapter to be connected and then the wheel, creating a direct drive, like the V4's.

The axles won't be strong enough.  I believe the Carvon motors use 12mm axles.  You'll have to figure out a way to first increase the axle size inside the hub motor.

There are no hubs that run on a 12mm axle?

That doesn't seem like it would be too difficult to machine a motor an extra 2mm..?

That's just 1mm extra, when bored out that would give you 2mm in diameter.

Just need to CNC a plate like the black part on the motor and you can turn any hub motor to direct drive.  If this was a normal hub motor though there wouldn't be a hole in the center, so you would need to add in the center a short axle for the wheel to secure too, as if the actual axle went straight through the motor.  Would just need to get swappable wheel connector patterns to secure too the base plate and then you could use pretty much any wheel you want.

No I totally intend to buy at least a couple of sets, but I'd also like to learn how to make my own motors and I think the direct drive is the perfect type of motor for Esk8.  Tons of people made their own versions of belt drives and the same with hub drives.  There isn't a patent on how you can power your Esk8, I'm sure if I don't make any motors with a similar concept of the direct drive, there will be plenty of other's out there to do it for me.  Atm though, the best option for me is to support Carvon and buy from them.

All innovations are usually based on prior technology.  I messaged Jerry about his motors a few days ago and he said his V4 SD was actually an airplane motor, it just fit the applications he was looking for, so even those borrowed from some other technology.  Hub drives have clearly been the next major advancement in Esk8 motors, and they have been advancing and now we have one maker who has introduced the direct drive which is the next logical step in advancement.  I'm sure there will be even more advancements after this, but I wouldn't be opposed to seeing some options with regards to the direct drive hub motor. That creates competition and competition drives advancement.  My idea for this hub adapter plate I think is a good start to that process.

Fair enough though I am not sure about your idea of hub adaptor plate. That is Carvon V4 motor with hub adaptor plate for ABEC, hub adaptor plate for pneumatic six shooters, etc. the picture above is a Carvon direct drive motor and a Carvon ABEC and b adaptor plate.

[/quote]

Not trying to poke the bear, but I don't know if this is really an advancement or not...

Direct drives have their own issues, no system is perfect at this point.

Carvon can talk about full urethane ect. ect. but the reality is that we have only 6mm less urethane then a standard abec wheel. It's more a marketing point than anything. So you don't like our 83mm wheel feel? Put on a 90mm wheel with hummie hubs and you'll get more urethane then the abec 83mm wheel. Most hubs however can't do this, because they expand in diameter. With hummies hubs, we've expanded in length instead. This allows us to keep the can small diameter wise for more rubber, while creating one of, if not, the most powerful hub motor ever created.

Good luck even running your carvons with 83m wheels. You will get thrown off from even small rocks getting caught between the can and the street. 90mm is better, but it is it's biggest vulnerability.

In terms of direct drive though, carvon has done somethings right, but they still use off the shelf motors, strip them, and adapt them to a truck. As a result, they can't do custom kvs, and most importantly, they are stuck with thin strand wire. This means for the same motor size, they will get less torque because they will have less copper, since insulation on that thin wire is more than half of the wire. Even comparing a 18 to a 24, the 18 has double the copper of the 24, but is rated to 4 times the amps. We've seen this play out with testing to result in a far more powerful motor that can handle far more current. That'll mean you can pump in more amps without fear of blowing the motor.

Not trying to talk shit, cause like I said, no one has a perfect solution. Good wheels with good cores are still a struggle for pretty much every hub motor. I just think saying hubs where a stepping stone to the direct drives is not true. Especially when you consider carvon was doing direct drives back when hub motors where not really a thing. I wouldn't say either was a stepping stone to the other.

Let me add. Converting some jacob hub motors. Bored the center stator out to 12mm. All I have to do now is machine a 12mm hanger to fit the DD and add a crown. Can be done and rather easily if I do say so myself. Just remember you aren't really going to see any performance increase over the original hub you modified. You'll just get a much more plush ride.


Edit: ...and a sense of pride and accomplishment -E.A.

It's not marketing, I don't want a skateboard with less than 4 longboard wheels.  It's simple.  There are lots of other problems with hub motors that you glossed over, like heat dissipation, inflexibility of change, and VENDORLOCK! You're stuck paying whatever price the vendor charges for the wheel wrappers, which is an automatic NOPE in my book.  And what if the vendor goes out of business?  You have to toss the motor once you wear out the wheel wrapper.  Or, convert it to direct drive like it should've been in the first place :stuck_out_tongue:

I get your vendor lock fear, but what if there where different options of wheels? What if you had the options between a few different wheels (different sizes, different polyurethanes, different duros, ect.)?

Just cause it doesn't exist today doesn't mean it won't in the near future...

Honestly, I don't think most are that picky about what wheel they want to use anyway. 90%+ people just wana ride something that feels nice. And saying hubs can't feel nice isn't true.

I can see the benefits of a direct drive. But to me, the most important aspect of the hub is nothing outside of the wheel is moving. I guess if you ride 107mm, it's not that big of a deal. But I rode @BigBoyToys carvon v3's on 83mm and boy, that was scary. Rode nice, but I was ready any second to get thrown off.

Not trying to doubt you, just curious if those are different blends of polyurethane. My understanding is that is more or less the complaint. Different blends have different properties as I'm sure you know. So what feels good to one might not to another. Take abec for example, they have different blends for different purposes.

Now to some degree, I can notice the difference, but at the end of the day, I'm not going to go to direct drive because of these tiny differences that most people won't notice.

The Market is small now and demand for different types of urethane is not high.

However our molds are made and urethane blends are easy to mix....  We will be ready to service the demand if it arises.

The myth that hub motors means you don't have wheels options is busted.

The myth that hub motors means less urethane is busted

The myth that hub motors are not 'comfortable' to ride is busted

I can say the same. We have some great companies we're working with that supply our thanes, and they have some interesting formulas were working with that we have high hopes for. Even the stuff we have now is far better than most of the wheels out there.

With our latest investment in a high quality 3d printer, we've ready to experiment with new wheels also.

Things are changing. 2018 will be another big year for eskate.

There's only one hub motor issue yet to be solved as far as Im concerned and that's urethane to motor retention and longevity. You and Luke have both made big strides in this area, only time will tell if either of you have really solved it but Im excited to find out. Hopefully my Raptor 2 and set of Hummies arrive soon so I can be advocates for you both.

No need for the passive aggressive talk. I don't consider myself an innovator as much as I don't consider myself a rebrand. The DD conversion is for my own personal tinkering. Might as well add to the conversation with my own studies and insight in the matter.

He's not selling them for profit, and he's learning something.

There is more to ride quality than urathane thickness, forumlation is another big factor imo, and trying to match the ride quality flywheels and superfly's offer wont be an easy task.

Could the extra width increases rolling resistance? Thr most efficient bicycles and cars use very narrow tires (think road bike).

[/quote]

You've mentioned Carvons on 83's a couple times. Did you know that it's a non compatible size per Jerry? I just happen to have all sizes between 83-107mm and decided I'd use them for SPD2 to maximize torque on our tight turned course. It's also the reason I swept the whole course with a push broom before the event lol. I actually would never run such small wheels normally I much prefer a plush ride on 97mm or 107mm wheels. The option to safely use 83mm with your hubs is a big plus for that extra torque 👌.

[quote="evoheyax, post:18, topic:40064"]
they can't do custom kvs,

True, but we have had more than a couple KV options available from Carvon. I bought or currently own Carvon's in 85KV, 110KV, 149KV and 192KV. Pretty decent selection IMO.

[/quote]

You mentioned getting thrown off beacuse of a rock as a big issue for Carvons but I havent heard of a single person complaining of this being more than a theoretical issue. I have many hundreds of miles on Carvon motors and it hasnt happened even once. I have run over rocks though. I actually hit a big one during a top speed test at over 40mph. The rock broke in half and left my V2 motors with only a scratch and I didnt fall. It just felt like ran over a street reflector..

Im not sure what other direct drive issues you were thinking of, but keeping heat out of the wheel, ventilating the motors and loading the wheel bearings instead of the motor bearings are additioal benefits of the Carvon design over standard hub motors.

[quote="evoheyax, post:18, topic:40064"]
saying hubs were a stepping stone to the direct drives is not true.
[/quote]

Agreed.

Atm, the Carvons are the only direct drives(hubs included) that have lasted me more than 30miles with out isssue, and Ive tried many. So in a sense Carvon has set the bar. If nobody ever fixes all the issues plaguing hub motors I think carvon would be considered the forward step, but otherwise they are more a side step headed in the same direction.

If you and Hummie successfully create a hub motor that stays cool, rolls plush and doesnt fall apart you will have only the second (or third if the raptor 2 cleans up its act) available direct drive system that works well(imo). 

Keep up the good work, us hub guys are counting on you 😉.

How exactly are the Raptor 2, and Hummies direct drives?  They both are situated in the wheel like a hub motor aren't they?  My understanding is to be a direct drive, the motor is not in the wheel, aside from where it connects through the core?

Another thing that leads me to think the Carvon's are the best tech at the moment is from what I have seen so far, they are by far the fastest motors you can run.  I can't think of any other hub motors that in just 2WD go 35-40mph, and in 4WD do 45-50mph!

Up until a day ago I thought the Carvon's were built from scratch.  There is a building that I found that shows Jerry building his initial V2's and V2.5's.

https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=68614&sid=3094154600d61fd3da746c8fae7b8eb1

I thought the only things that were taken from the Koowheels was the motors and battery that are on the Exo board.  As for the V4 SD and XL I thought those were his own build and design.  It wasn't until my email correspondence with Jerry a few days ago that I found out anything about these motors being modified airplane motors.  Also in previous posts from a different thread I read that sometimes you could get Jerry to do custom windings for whatever kv you want.  I believe that was stated by Michael in Las Vegas.  So if these motors aren't being wound by him, how can that be explained?

Regarding Hummies hub motors like I said earlier, I have read nothing but great things about them, but don't know anything at all about them!  Do they have comparable speeds and other specs? It sounds like they are built from scratch, is that correct?  I really like what I read earlier in this thread that they are wound by the builders, and with a thicker, better quality wire.  I would like to know if these are built totally from scratch, would it be possible for a custom order to be placed on a set that allows for the axle to run through the center so an adapter plate could be fabricated and attached?

Also in regards to the adapter plate I was originally asking about in the beginning of the thread, I think the best thing to do would be to build a plate that screws onto the outside end cap, and then you would have a whole set of different configurations to choose from so you can run anything from ABEC's, to the Enertion's, Orangatang's, Evolves pneumatics, etc...  It would be a great package to be able to order I think.  I would choose that in a second if it came with the right motor.  I think Carvon's ability to change to a certain amount of different wheels is not a marketing ploy, but a genuinely great idea because like other people said, running the sleeve wheels that are very thin compared to being able to run full sized wheels is a no brainer.  I would just like to see a product that had adapters that fit nearly all types of wheels, and being able to change the adapter as easily as changing the wheel would be such a successful product.  I just hope that more people / companies that make motors start producing hub motors that allow for the axle to run through the whole motor, and equally that it becomes possible to get hangers that, like Carvon's, run the axle further back, allowing for these motors to be fastened further back so the trucks with an attached hub motor to direct drive aren't a ridiculous length, but around 10-13 inches, or something like that.

A direct drive is simply a gear ration of 1:1 therefore hub motors are direct drives.

This is solely based on KV, not because they are mounted on the trucks. If you have Hubs with over 120Kv you will also reach such speeds.

I can't accept this is the only reason that they are the fastest.  There is so many different brands and makers of hub motors, and I find it highly unlikely that not a single one of them doesn't have a kv at or above 120kv.

One thing I'm curious about is if you were to put a planetary drive gear system in the hub motor like the Stary board does.  From what I understand, this reduces speed, but increases torque? Does anyone know if that is the purpose of the planetary drive system?  I have been researching them lately and they look like they wouldn't be too hard to fabricate a system to incorporate into a hub drive, and got could then get a decently higher kv motor with a planetary drive system so you not only have the speed but you also get good torque as well.

I didn't know that a 1:1 gearing was a direct drive.  So I don't know what to call Carvon's system then, but it's the only one currently that has the motor completely outside of the wheel, thus keeping all the weight off of the motor.  That's what I'm referring too.

Manta Drive: 85KV
Hummies: can be custom made as far as I know but mostly around 100KV
DIY: 75KV and 130KV (hill grades will be decreased considerably and it's acceleration/deceleration which is why they advertise them for 6S)
Maytech: 60KV
Other Chinese brand (meepo): 60KV

which other hubs are there?[quote="uigiroux, post:46, topic:40064"]

Yes, it is.

[quote="uigiroux, post:46, topic:40064"]

[/quote]

Not really. Speed and torque are proportional so even if you gain torque with the planetary gearbox, you'll loose top speed even though it's in wheel. Planetary gearbox's are mostly for stealth. They allow you to keep the torque of a belt drive yet have everything in wheel but for that you'd have to have a higher KV (closer to 190KV if using 10s/12s).

Sorry if I came off that way, defiantly not trying to be rude. Just trying to encourage innovation. Just spit balling ideas. The reason I say that is selling 100% re branded is harder than selling 80% re branded with some innovation you've created that the rest of the market doesn't have. After all, we are a DIY community. So we love to see people try ideas, and I honestly thought it could be a good opportunity for you. Trust me, it's not as hard to design stuff as you think. Really, you just need a person who knows a 3d modeling software that you can pass 2d drawings to so they can turn them into 3d files. Then, you send these files around to companies in china, and one or any will be interested. A lot of companies in china want to work with eskate builders right now, so it's not as hard as it was even a year ago. Probably, make a new truck that allows the motors to mount to them, and then an adapter like carvon that bolts to the outside of the motor, and your done. You don't even need to know anything about motors. Just throwing the idea out there. Not trying to belittle you or anything negative.

Did you know that it's a non compatible size per Jerry?
[/quote]

Did you know that last poll I saw on this forum about what wheel size people prefer, over 50% said 83mm... A lot of people want small wheels, which is why I mention the carvons and lack of support.

Honestly, i'm glad carvon worked out for you.

The reason Hummie got into making hubs is because Jacobs were garbage, shorting and falling apart while the wheel slipped.

And I got into it cause my carvons fell apart. Bending axle, wheels slipping, it was a nightmare. When I approached Jerry, I was told I was the first bending truck issue. He asked me not to talk about it. Why? Cause I wasn't the first person to have bending truck issues, He lied to my face. And many others have told me Jerry did the same thing to them. Then, I got no response at times, followed by shipping this week for 6 months straight, every week. And in the end, the best he did was offer $100 off of the carvon v3's. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. 

Why did he need to lie to me intentionally, and cover up the bending truck issues? Will he do the same if problems arise in his new products? My guess is yes, he won't admit fetal flaws, and instead of accepting he fucked up, he pushed the cost of his mistake onto his customers. Most of the industry works like this. It's disgusting to me. If you sell a faulty product that can't be fixed, return your customers damn money and accept that your design failed, not your customer.

If something happens to your hummie motors, we're here, we'll fix it and if we can not, we'll get you hooked up with new stuff at cost (free labor), not just $100 bucks off, cause you know hes at least doubling his costs.

[quote="BigBoyToys, post:42, topic:40064"]
Im not sure what other direct drive issues you were thinking of
[/quote]

The mounting itself is suspect to me. 3 small screws attach the motor to the truck. If those fail, your motors falling off like a raptor 2.

The pully is the same way, a few small screws hold the adapter on. For us, it's a thin plate. That plate doesn't have close to the same forces as the adapter because of the adapters length. More length means more leverage, so the forces on these little screws will be high. If that breaks good bye wheel and hello ground.

With the hub, worst case is you lose a wheel, which happened to me on old hummies because I rode with 2 screws instead of 6, but even then you can ride it out on the can, which I did at 23 mph.

When looking at designs, I want fail safe, and so far, carvons don't seem fail safe, and they structurally failed for me in the past and were covered up. It's shaddy, and I honestly don't trust carvon because of the way Jerry has lied to me. He knew I wasn't the first person have bending truck issues, and instead of recalling them (which would of meant the end of his business), he made me pay for his design flaws. That's not an ethical way of doing business in my books.

Maybe my complaints are more about Carvon and not direct drive. But IMO, they will always have some structural disadvantage, since they need to be pushed so far inwards on th truck. Your also limited in motor length. Which will always mean small magnets. Can't get a super strong magnetic field without big magnets.

Another thing that leads me to think the Carvon's are the best tech at the moment is from what I have seen so far, they are by far the fastest motors you can run.
[/quote]

This is not anything special. You know how you make motors go faster? You wind them to a few less turns and poof, higher top speed. Theres no tech involved, it's really simple.

People for some reason correlate high speed with high tech, but it's not true at all. High speed and high torque together is hard. The carvons that can do 40 mph do so by sacrificing torque. If you want torque, you sacrifice top speed. It's like hub motors gearing.

He picked a higher kv motor, and that's why it's faster. Why don't others do this? Because everyone makes tiny hub motors. Higher kv motors require more amps at startup and thus, more heat. Heat destroys motors. Carvon uses a larger motor than most hub motors, so that is why they can get away with the higher kv.

[quote="uigiroux, post:43, topic:40064"]
Up until a day ago I thought the Carvon's were built from scratch.  There is a building that I found that shows Jerry building his initial V2's and V2.5's.
[/quote]

He's never wound a motor and sold it, ever. Or had a motor wound for him and sold it. He took sk3's and turned them into direct drives. No small feet, but not the ground up. If he's offering kv options, then he found a motor with a few different kvs that he is using. For example, look at the sk3. Same structure, different kvs.

In terms of hummies, you could easily make an adapter mount to turn them into direct drives. You would have a super wide wheel base, but it is doable.

Wow, you know I read in a thread some people had concerns about the axle breaking and after much talking it was stated that this only happened once, so I find this rather troubling...  I really have to wondering how much of a markup is being applied to the V4's and the boards themselves.  I'm all for manufacturers making money, but at a reasonable mark up.  One thing I noticed last night while thinking about the costs of the 2WD vs 4WD Carvon Evo, I was trying to price the boards out, using the individual costs of each item on its own, from the 1-2 V4's at $599 or $699, 2 or 4 VESC's (not sure which one they are using exactly, but I imagine they're anywhere from $100 - $200), and then I got to the battery.  Now I've read in forums, and from speaking to Jerry the other day, that longhairedboy is the one who is building the Evo's, and on Carvon's description of the Evo 4WD, it's got a 12s5p battery pack using Samsung 30Q's.  I have to assume he's using the same battery pack that he sells on his site for $850!

https://longhairedboy.com/collections/frontpage/products/high-powered-electric-skateboard-battery-pack-43v-12s5p-samsung-inr18650-30q

So that's 60 cells at roughly $3.50 a piece, and I think it's actually less than that, but for 60 at & $3.50 that's $210, plus a 60 Amp BMS for probably around $60, maybe slightly more but not much, an anti - spark electric switch, I've seen these from $30-$60, a charge port which can't be more than $10, and a fuel gauge, also can't be more than $10, and then a 4 Amp fast charger with charge cables, probably about $60.  So if you add that all up using the highest values where I have a range in cost that comes to $410, though I'm inclined to think it's closer to $350-$375.  So again I have no problem with people turning a profit for their hard work and quality parts and craftsmanship, but this is a markup of more than double!  That's between $440-$500 in profit, just for a battery pack!  Like I really would love to be able to just buy one of the pre-made Evo's, but at $3000, where potentially $850 is for the battery it comes with, there is no way I am going to make that purchase.  

Again I'm not trying to be a dick, though I probably am sounding like one, but that, and now hearing your story about the axle breaking more than I've been led to believe has me more than ever wanting to try and get this idea of mine going and putting them on 4 of hummie hub motors!

Do you know if hummies hubs are built from scratch or are they a modified motor?

I know how many will take this. They think I'm trying to bash someone else's product so I can push a product I'm working on. But it's really I'm an upset customer of carvon, and I've kept my story to myself at Jerry's request, but I figured, why am I protecting him? I started working with hummie because of my experience with Jerry.

Now, hummie's motors are 100% custom made from the ground up, every part except the stator (which we will have custom made at some point in the future also). Hand wound in San Francisco, with attention to detail. We have the parts machined in china (can't really avoid this with out charging over $1000 for a freakin pair of motors), then wound and fully assembled in house here in SF. We also pour the wheels, but we might move wheel pouring to the same company that pours ABEC and Orangatang wheels. Depends on if we end up with a high enough quality wheel on our own or not. We do have good connections with a company that claims to have almost the same formula as ABEC wheels, so we'll see. Just got it yesterday.

Now, I know what people will say, why talk shit about others products? Two reasons: First of all, I was a carvon customer too, so I feel I have the right to talk about my experience. and the truth is, the wheel is still the final puzzle piece for us. Everything else is rock solid, but the wheels are tough. We are confident we will find a solution, even what we have now is far better than other hub motors. But we have high standards. We want really good wheels, not decent ones. So we don't have all of the answers either. I'm basically saying no one is perfect. Just that I don't understand this business mindset of lets gouge our customers 2-3 times our cost, and when things fail, leave the customer hanging... At that price range, I expected better. And I think customers should be able to make informed decisions about what they purchase, instead of decisions biased on fallacies.

We really haven't done any marketing besides on this forum. I feel like most of the market advertises in such a way that deceives people into getting hyped with marketing gimmicks, to only be let down with the final product. We have sat for 2 years on this motor, testing and learning, instead of selling our previous version which had it's own issues. We don't and won't ship a product we don't deem to be near perfect.

At this time, the most custom thing we can afford to spend time on is with custom wheel sizes and custom kv's. If you want to figure out how take our motor and turn it into a direct drive, we could help with ideas. But physical machining would complicate things, since like I said, we have them machined in china, not a shop around the corner who can do custom machining like this on the fly. Would take months to get made and for such a small batch, over $500 per motor at cost to us.

Really, you would just need a custom truck made and a custom locking nut made to turn them into direct drives. They are hollow 100% of the way through the truck now, so the axle, it made longer, can go all the way through. We do use a locking nut now to keep it in place. And you might need to get some custom nut made (or just locktite them down like we did in the past, now we're using thermally conductive paste thanks to the new design). Then, the pulley adapter would be easy to 3d print even. And there you go, hummie direct drive out of wheel motors, lol.

It's all doable, but we have our hands full with in wheel motors, which we prefer to begin with.

In terms of wattage, I've tested them to 6000 total in 4wd drive. With the wind we use and comparing them to others, I suspect 3000w or more is totally possible. But such high watts will make them get hot. There's no way around it.

I can do what, 1600 watts per motor with little heat build up.

Maybe an idea thrown in the lot, from another discipline. 

The hubs / direct drives (hard to choose a term after reading all this thread) I work on are probably unusable for skateboards.

Now I designed them in order to be able to use any inline skate wheel size starting from 80mm and upwards (84/90/100/110/125/130).

Cut part of the core off standard wheel, mount it and voilà done. No slippage or center problems or heat dissipated in the wheel. 

What is interesting (and my point) is : along the numerous types of wheels  available,  the performance oriented ones are **dual density compounds**. Same logic as formula 1.

You maximise rebound and grip yet you can also achieve a very predictable sliding wheel.  You can fine tune what you need without compromise except cost. 

 How come I've never ever heard of dual density for skateboards wheels? 

Would make sense IMO and probably help against many problems.

So your suggestion is to get a truck made that would allow me to mount the motors further in, and fasten it on without using a locking nut for the wheel, but rather, attack the adapter plate to the outside, and then secure the wheel to the adapter on the outside of the wheel? Like the adapter on the left, slide it through, and then screw it on?

My advice, Try getting your product out, get some Third party reviews and then if all is perfect, then start boasting & talking again.

From experience, I'd say you are at least 6 months (or longer) away from having a reliable commercially available product in stock. 

Also, longer stators are much harder to cool at the core and have a mechanical disadvantage (torque disadvantage) when compared to larger diameter, but shorter stators.

Anyone who develops hub motors should post hill climbing videos as proof of concept. Rolling on flats is easy. 

Why Aren't there any carvon hill climbing video's?

I just figured out the best way to convert any hub to an out of wheel hub!

Before I was talking about securing the wheel by screwing each piece that goes through the slots, but if I just had a center mounted piece to go where the axle would normally go through, I could just screw it onto that, as if the axle actually did go through the motor, and that would make it so one wouldn't have to secure each part that goes through the slots.

So do you have any advice on how one would get in touch with a company in China or somewhere like that to get a potential manufacturing process going if I am able to raise the funds?

Realistically speaking Jason, you are right. We're hoping to launch a kickstarter campaign by early February, after getting reviews and further testing. That'll allows us to bulk order parts like magnets which are very expensive right now in the small orders we do. Taking those profits, we can invest in more parts to get inventory likely by April.

The width of this wouldn't matter anyways, I would be able to just cut the extra length off where it is able to go as far into the hub as possible, measured from where the truck starts into the triangular shape.

No I want to mount them further back and then attach an adapter plate to the end that allows me to use any wheel I want, like Carvons, so it would need a truck made where I could position the motors much further in.

I don't think trying to alter these to work that way will be worth the trouble.  why not look on endless-sphere and there is a thread about using a motor you can get from hobbykiing and it can be altered to fit on an axle.  Styles was the name of the guy who showed everyone then how this motor from hobbyking  that comes with a big outer bearing, as apposed to a typical outrunner with just the smaller bearings, can be mounted on a regular skate hanger.  the thread is probably about 3 or 4 years old now.  this was how carvon started and what they sold and it sounds like you want a carvon pretty much but are willing to put in work.

Yeah that's essentially it.  Also though, I was talking with someone you work with earlier about the quality of Carvon and he wasn't very impressed whereas it seems like your hubs are top of the line and all custom made, so I thought I'd try and convert yours to a direct drive like Carvon's.  Also, if his motors aren't custom made, just slightly repurposed airplane engines, I really have a hard time justifying paying 600-700 just for a set of motors, and the cost for their fully built Evo is crazy.  I have a feeling that a large portion of that cost is the battery being marked up like 200%...

Do you think you could find that link?  I don't know much about that site..

Yeah apperantly the axle has a tendency to break more than is being disclosed is what I've heard essentially.  I am not saying they are bad motors, but I just am curious how much of a mark up is on the motors... I mean, I see motors much larger and good brands that are at most like $200 and that's super rare.  So I would like to know exactly which motor this originally was and how much that one is.  I understand he put time in for certain modifications and there's also the special trucks they come with, but $600-$700 per set!?  I just don't see them costing maybe even half that...

I was just looking at some other motors that could be used possibly, and though this is a rather unusual choice, I would like to know what you guys thought of it as a direct drivev.

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/9235-100kv-turnigy-multistar-brushless-multi-rotor-motor.html?___store=en_us

You'd have to run at least 97 to 107mm PU's, but the power is insane, and its got a kv thats just right...  Also the center would be easy to adapt to fit onto a thicker truck so the concern with an axle snapping wouldn't be a problem.  You obviously could only run these on certain boards with wide wheel clearance, but I'm not really seeing much of a problem here.  These look like absolute monsters that you wouldn't need to even mess with the windings cause the kv is just right, you'd just have to figure out how to get it properly mounted on a truck.

it'll have less rolling resistance when running unpowered since it has so many teeth and magnets which is nice. 

 if you take on this challenge good luck to you.  Ive done similar with a tacon 160 and it was a ton of work for what amounted to something that broke pretty quick but maybe you have a better way to do it.  the biggest problem for me was getting the rotor to be centered on the axle.  mounting the stator on the axle wasn't the nicest but I got that pretty centered, or centered enough at least, but the rotor needed a a cnc'd part that bolted onto the side of the rotor (the  4 holes in the pic ) and it does double duty of having bearings in it to get it centered on the shaft and also prongs to go into a wheel.  the prongs in the wheel part is easy enough done on a cnc machine but I had a lot of trouble getting the rotor to be centered around the stator and axle.  made the holes bigger and I made them so they had some adjustability...and then I adjusted forever and finally decided to duct tape the stator teeth with exactly two wraps of tape, then slide the rotor over on this very tight fit, and then epoxy the screws that connected this rotor to the bearing tube that supports it.   if you do take it on id get a very straight axle. also see if you can possibly get big enough bearings in the tube that you bolt to the rotor ...that was another problem with how I did it

i might be wrong about this but i think more magnets=more pole pairs= higher ERPM? that's the main issue i see with these, but i'd be interested in seeing someone build some bigass hubs with them anyway.

it does have more pole pairs and would be a higher erpm per revolution than a typical 12x14 outrunner but still doubt its up to what a pulley would be doing per wheel rotation.  
 or maybe you could just add more voltage to the hoverboard instead of having to rewind.

How about this motor.  I think this would be even easier to mount than the previous one.

As far as getting it centered over the hub, it would be very simple if I could just get the adapter that I want made built.  I could mount the motor too a wheel and it would be fixed over the truck.  From there, I could get the dimensions of what I would need to get it mounted in that spot.

Well i'm currently looking at custom bldc motor makers i'm going to try and get some quotes, and i'm also looking at very high end RC motors that would blow the sk3 out of the water, and I think I've found some really good options there.  My main thing is I want top quality, and I don't think that those motors at about $90 are that high in quality, which just makes me all the more irritated because I was so heart set on getting a 4WD setup from Carvon cause I thought they were built from scratch and high quality.  I understand that just cause there repurposed airplane motors doesn't mean there bad, but at the cost they are just for one, not even figuring bulk, I just don't see how the motors on their own are selling for $600 and $700....  If I can get some custom ones made that have as much torque and top speed and are top quality, thats definitely the way i'm going to go, and who knows, if there a good enough price, i'll maybe try and sell em.  Well see...

Have you ever had anything machined???

CNC trucks cost between $100-200 each in bulk. The cost of materials alone for CNC trucks is probably $50-75, plus machine time and remember technicians are also not free.

Throw in a pair of $90 motors, the cost of machining truck adapters, wheel adapters and other random parts. The cost is easily $400, them being sold at $600 for duals is not that crazy.

I have no problem using fully thread axles. However, it's an engineering thing you won't ever see a dynamic load use threaded axles for the wheels.  Thre real technical answers are you need to take into account the material's ultimate tensile strength and yield strength under dynamic and static loads. Shear strength is more critical in what you are doing. There isn't a specific value for this, but a simple calculation gives an approximation versus FEA analysis. There's a few post of axles sheering off from using hub motors. I can't remember who posted them.

First off, I never said anything about fully threaded axles so I'm confused where you got that assumption, and secondly, yes they cost that much, but for the whole truck or truck set!  This is just one part of the hanger.  It's not even the whole thing, just the very center.  The rest is the 12mm axle.  That's what I've read it only comes with, if I'm wrong, then ok a full truck is worth $100, but if it's just that part of the hanger, no way.

Still trying to figure out where fully threaded axles ever came up..? I certainly wouldn't think to use them in the first place.

Also, $90 per motor is what we pay.  I'm sure when your ordering in bulk that goes down to like $75 or so.  So 2*$75 (motors)  + ($50-$75, hanger) =, $200-$225 plus a bit for labor, though these are coming from China, so that labor is way less than what we're used to.  I'd be extremely surprised if they were over $300 a set, so yes I do think that $600-$700(the XL is just the 6374 sk3 at 149kv rewound to wye termination dropping it to 85kv but it's only a few extra dollars at cost per unit for us, again, not at bulk, so that price is even more upsetting) has got to be a considerable markup.  Similar to battery packs that cost about $300 in parts, but are sold for 1.5x more at like $750 or more.  I'm all for making a profit when work is done and time is spent and the parts cost money, but let's be reasonable.

Please point to the part of my post where I insulted you... I am not being rude, just honest. You have never machined anything, was I wrong? Do you know how much time is involved in machining something with good precision? A CNC mill for metals costs upwards of $30,000, and it doesn't come with a friendly manual or YouTube tutorial. You either have to spend a few thousand hours learning or hire someone to do it. A technician in California probably costs around $20-30 an hour. It would take at least an hour of machine time per truck, then another hour or 2 for adapters and such. My guess is there is at least $100 worth of labor in each drive. 

It's easy for a DIYer with the right tools available to say a part is only worth as much as the materials cost, but factor in your time and you'll realize things are way way more expensive than they seem.

It's got a prop diameter of 15mm, so I could get a truck with a mostly circular hanger around the axle, and machine it down to 15, then I dunno, thread them both to secure it?  Not sure how I would secure it, but this motor is seriously powerful and I woudln't need to modify the motor at all, would I?

still has the shaft supported only on one side like a typical outrunner.   look how the sk3 linked has the bearings holding both sides of the bell.  otherwise one hit and done.

 the price is pretty insane considering the wire is just good, laminations are lame,  and doesnt even mention the magnets.  it does have a bunch of empty hype though with claims surely unverifiable.    looking cool is the best thing it has going.  even their 3d image of the winding looks very lame with very little copper fill.

Couldn't I just fit a bearing on the other end?  I'm not really understanding what your are talking about.  Can you provide a pic of a link or something that shows this?  Do you know of any other motors that DO have support of the shaft on both sides?

Also, from the picture, you can't really tell if it is supported witha bearing on the other side or not cause the rotor mount is covering more than a 15mm diameter.

im getting a notice on the side that I'm hogging the conversation and should do a private message. 

idont know of another with a bearing support on both sides.  but research more the thread i linked and also search on endless-sphere the forum owner did convert a normal outrunner to have a bearing on the other side.  he pressed it in and also pressed in a support. inspiring stuff.  youre taking on a lot though.  lot of time and money for a gamble especially if machining is new to you  but dont let me discourage you and no better way to learn.

I just had the company that makes the motors for the Segway and Ninebot contact me about building a custom engine for a skateboard... wondering if I should go with them or try and find a company that is maybe used to building smaller sized motors...?  Though they literally make hub motors, though its the wrong type of hub motor, but all the same, they're both for transportation, so it might be the perfect company.  They want to know:

* You could provide your draft drawing or CAD drawing for us,and we will realize your idea.
* We also need some other specifications:
* Motor rim size:
* Diameter of motor:
* Length of motor:
* Voltage:
* Watts:
* kv:
* Speed:
* Torque:
* Slope:
* Load capacity:
* Outline demension:

What would make for the perfect skateboard motor setup on a thicker truck axle ran as a direct drive?  I want the speed to be at least 30mph, not sure what good torque would be... It's Newtons per... something though, lol.  I think a 30% slope would be good.  Load capacity, something like 250 max for 2WD and above that 4WD,  watts I think around 3000ish, for Volts, would that be what a 12s voltage would be?  like 50, 60?  I think if there is going to be 15-20mm diameter in the center for the engine to be able to mount on different trucks  the overall diameter should be an extra 15-20mm to compensate for what is lost... well, most rotors are 8mm, so 15-20 would only be 7-12 extra mm so that I guess is what should be extra... so maybe a 75mm x 80mm?  Or is that too big?  I want this to be crazy powerful but I don't want it to be absurdly overpowered.   I've been considering a planetary drive for higher kv but good torque, I'm skepticle though, cause both the Stary, and that very cool build thread that was on this site that just finished up not long ago were both quite noisy... Maybe something else can be thought up by the developers.  Any thoughts???

What the hell is this? I just resigned back just to respond to this. When did I tell you to not to post anything in the forum? And if I did say you're the first one I heard of bending problems, it's because you were. What are you saying I lied to your face. I met you at SPD2 and you never said anything to me.

You also asked me a lot about how the V2 urethane was attached and how I told you the ABEC11 Flywheels are better than the Clones because they have an inner core that is cooked with the outer urethane. And guess what, now you have the same formula. I was not replying to you because I saw that what I was telling you was filtering down to Hummie's post and you never told me that you guys are working together. I emailed you about it and you were very apologetic and humble.

I have stayed quiet for a long time. But this has gone too far. This is libelous.

First off, this email was over 6 months ago, times were very different. Hummie didn't have any new working design in over 1.5 years, I couldn't see where those were going. I'm not trying to bash his product either, I'm just stating my experience. Carvons in my opinion are 60% marketing, 40% actually good. So many caught up on the hype to the point where people want to copy, with out understanding why hubs will improve in general (not just ours). I have even said good things about the carvon v3's. One story of what happened to me in the past doesn't constitute bashing IMO when I've said many good things about the product.

I'm not going to post private emails to try to settle some sort of public argument. I think it's very inappropriate for private emails to be posted public ever, under any circumstances. I don't care what I say or do, it's rude, especially when it's communication with your customer.

Believe it or not, I have had customers ask me to buy hummie motors, and I've turned them away to carvons, because I knew they would be a better fit for them. I never said the aren't an option, just I question them because of my experience in the past.

Haha, oh well.  So I have a question hopefully someone can answer.  How does the amount of watts a motor has affect the performance of a motor?  For instance, Carvon's has 2500W each, so a pair gives 5kW.  If I built an engine with the same kv as Carvon's, and set them up the same way, but say they were 4000W each,  would my speed be greater, or acceleration better?  Just curious cause a lot of the other engines that have comparable kv don't go near as fast as Carvon's, so I was wondering how they effect things.

## \#160 Posted by: uigiroux Posted at: 2017-12-29T03:17:52.571Z Reads: 163

Further more, if that is the case, could I not have as low of kv and still have a larger amount of torque if my watts are higher, or substitute them in a manner of speaking for some other traditional method of getting the performance typically expected if I had gone the normal way?  I'm assuming they require more power to operate, but if the battery pack is big enough then no worries there and things like steeper hills could be conquered..?  Or am I just totally wrong here, lol... I know there good for something, I just want to know specifics.

Watts don't really mean too much. The kv means speed, amps means torque, watts are a combination of both. It's best to get motors that can run on higher wattage than the esc (ESCs really don't put more than 1500w). Watts is more like the buffer before the motor fries. To sum it up, watts aren't super important, just get motors that have a tad bit more wattage than the esc will be able to put out.

Believe it or not, most people don't get watt ratings like that from testing. So when someone says the motor they are selling you is 2500W, doesn't mean it can do that for very long either if it even can in the first place.

Watt ratings are not the best metric to look at. It really comes down to stator size, copper fill, and the amount of magnets+magnetic strength of said magnet. Bigger mostly means better, but most take shortcuts (like multi strand wire) to save costs in winding. The can size will tell you alot. Longer usually means longer magnets (i.e. stronger magnets) and wide usually means more copper. The only issue, is as a consumer, you don't know what size anything is. So it's mostly guessing and researching from those who have taken their motors apart.

Deuce it out?  I feel like I'm missing something... I'm just asking some questions cause I'm fairly new to this and really want to learn all I can to try and develop a motor and everyone's comments help me learn more and more.  I dream of starting a company, that's honestly a long shot though (big surprise) but I've been talking to companies and different motor builder factories.  Still trying to get an idea of cost cause all the details of what the specs for a perfect motor would be, that can do speeds comparable to Carvon's, with torque greater than the best satellite motor setup, etc...  Any one have a thought on what the ideal motor specs would be for that, including diameter and length along with the kv, amps, watts, etc... and in a Carvon style setup?

And the reason you don't get a straight answer is no one wants to give away their secret recipe.

Honestly, bigger stator, more copper, and big strong magents. Do that and you'll have a good motor.

Most people use the neodymium magnets, I heard that sintered cobalt or something like that was the very best magnet you can use.  Also been looking into special types of coil for winding, and I came across a very cool product for keeping the motor cool called statorade, it's a ferrofluid, sounds like it would be great in our applications..

Lol secret recipe?  Is every one who's on this thread building their own motors?  As for Carvon's, that's a Turnigy SK3 6364/6374 just rewound to a different termination.

Lol well I mainly focusing on a Trampa build ATM, but as it so happens I just had a conversation with a forum member who was also wanting to do this and I think we got a lot discussed for future possible plans.  I'm kinda taking a back seat at the moment, though I wish I hadn't.  Maybe I could have come up with something to compete with Carvon by now, lol.  Probably not, as this is much more difficult than I originally thought, but who knows.  I do plan to work on this as soon as I finish my build this next month.  I think I could build something for much less than what is currently being charged...  Just my opinion though.  I'll let y'all know if there are any updates :smile:
