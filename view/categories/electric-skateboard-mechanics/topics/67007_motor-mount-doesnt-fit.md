Oh man... Didn't check if it'd fit before buying?

It's gonna be too much hassle to jerryrig that together. You're better off buying parts that fit, especially if this is your first build. I'd suggest that you use a different mount.

Also is that a 3mm belt pitch? Oh it is isn't it.. I'm in class right now but I'm sure someone else in the community could elaborate on why that's not a good idea.

looks like itÂ´s a motor mount for 63xx motor size only.
Looked up hobbyking website, but there they donÂ´t give information to which motor size the mount should fit...

Yes, it is my first build and this motor mount was the third one that I bought since I started building my diy board. I checked but couldn't find any information about the sizes on hobbyking.com.

Come on man cut yourself a break and do some research. You could have asked the community and you would have been told it won't fit.

I'm not experienced in OTC motor mounts since I always make my own, but someone more experienced can suggest a good one that'll fit.

How much was the motor on Wish? KV is high for a single drive DIY if that's what you're making.
HobbyKing Keda motor is dirt cheap and fits.

What voltage are you running your setup? Motor KV seems to be bit high and why did you choose HTD-3M belts over 5M belts?

The motor + shipping(Sweden) = 89$. Iâ€™m not sure if it is really 270kv and 1800 W but this is what the specs say. Itâ€™s a dual drive system.

I have four 3s lipos in series so the voltage is about 43 V. The belt came in a kit with the motor polly and wheel polly so that is why.

HK mounts are 63 only and won't work for a dual drive unless you go diagonal.  They are handed mounts.  Please don't use 3m belts either they will slip and slide all over the place and if you use steel pulleys on the motors the belts will wear out very quickly.

Wait 3x4=12s and 270KV? What esc are you using? If you going with the old Vescs make sure you get a fire extinguisher too!

Lesson here is that trying to SAVE money making an esk8 ends up costing you MORE than if you do it right the first time.  Even if they all fit, longevity and reliability will show very quickly with cheap parts

I have had a 50mm motor on this mount, only used 3 screws and washers.
Like your last picture, I actually used the wrong motor mount holes but it worked for me.
![IMG_20180905_002329|365x499](upload://vnQFarVQi9KVuNVNOc3eHxPzJ9X.jpg)
This motor is also not made for the mount but it works.

You can buy a keda 6364 from HK and it will fit or buy a @dickyho mount with idlers. 
Keep in mind, this hobby is expensive. Either you buy cheep parts, they won't fit or they break, and you'll upgrade them later OR you invest the same amount at the beginning and you'll have a good board.
Edit: when people say "it's going to cost more in the long run" it means in 2-3 month :sweat_smile:

So true, going cheap is always gona cost extra in the not so long run 1-3 months for me.

Definitely invest in good mounts, as many problems start here.

I'm so tired on this project. Already costs me more money than a price for a regular electric longboard. I spend money on many different parts(80mm wheels, 18650 and lipo batteries, bms, chinese esc, four vescs, three different motor mounts and so on) and still the board is not done.

Welcome to the diy world!
And sorry if I destroy your dreams, but it is a never ending story. Even if you got your build ready to drive there will be always something to improve or change.
If itâ€™s nothing for you than better sell your things and buy a boosted or raptor. 
Will save you a lot of money, time and nerves

I donâ€™t mind which pre build board ever.
Iâ€˜m not a fan of any of them, but as min there he donâ€™t need to fix anything by his own. If there is guarantee on it he can just sent it if something broken and good...

Honestly mate you should sell your stuff and start over.. Do some research and get parts that actually fit..

Your pulley is 3mm pitch. You want a 5mm. Are you using a vesc perhaps? That will blow up with 12s 270kv.

BehÃ¶ver du hjÃ¤lp sÃ¥ sÃ¤g till.

you can use screws with big head, but you need insert in red one or both (metal or print in a 3d) something for restrict the movement, because if you just use the screws and with the vibration the motor maybe will move.

Man pratar om pitch pÃ¥ dreven (djupet pÃ¥ kuggarna). AlltsÃ¥ 5mm Ã¤r djupet pÃ¥ en tand pÃ¥ din pulley. Nu har du kÃ¶pt en 3mm pulley vilket gÃ¶r att bÃ¤ltet har ej tillrÃ¤kligt med kontakt med drevet. AlltsÃ¥ dÃ¥ du accelererar och bromsar kommer bÃ¤ltet att hoppa Ã¶ver tÃ¤nderna pÃ¥ drevet.
Vad du behÃ¶ver Ã¤r en htd5 pulley och htd5 bÃ¤lte.

Och Vesc'en har en begrÃ¤nsning pÃ¥ 60.000 erpm (elektriska varv)
Med din motor och batteri uppnÃ¥r du ca 84.000 erpm. SÃ¥ direkt du gasar pÃ¥ kommer din vesc att gÃ¥ sÃ¶nder. 

Vad du borde kÃ¶pa Ã¤r en 63xx motor med max 170kv om du vill kÃ¶ra med 12s batteri.

Hoppas du fÃ¶rstÃ¥r min svenska. Jag Ã¤r finlÃ¤ndare och svenska Ã¤r ej mitt modersmÃ¥l.

Edit. Kom pÃ¥ att pitch Ã¤r stigning pÃ¥ svenska..

okej, nu fÃ¶rstÃ¥r jag. Jag har faktiskt en sÃ¥n pulley och bÃ¤lte dock gÃ¥r det inte att montera pullelyn pÃ¥ mina 80mm hjul. Har testat Ã¥ka ett par gÃ¥nger med 3mm bÃ¤lte och pulley och aldrig upplevt nÃ¥got problem under accelerationer eller bromsningar. 
Problemet med 63xx motorer Ã¤r att de drar mycket strÃ¶m vilket kommer batteriet och bms:en inte klara av.

Okej om du ej har problem med 3mm pitch sÃ¥ ingen vits att byta isf :slight_smile:
Men en 2000w  50mm motor drar lika mycket som en 63mm 2000w.. Sen Ã¤r det amp * v som bestÃ¤mmer hur mycket strÃ¶m nÃ¥nting drar. Inte motor betÃ¤ckningen.

SÃ¥ om du har lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga en 50a kontinuerlig bms med 12s (44.4v) drar systemet 2220w vid max fart. Delat pÃ¥ 2 om du hat 2 motorer
