3D printer files stl or pdf would work. or if you have dimensions for what the 3mm pitch pulley is supposed to be that would be appreciated.

I doubt that you will be able to find 3mm pitch... People here rarely use it

I would reccomend you design your own.  you can get .itp or .stl's of the gear ratio you want and then you can add onto that file with what mounting points you would need.   I did that with mine and its been working amazingly.  I suggest printing in PETG as it can handle the heat without warping and yet is very strong.

Where do you buy your belts from for a 5mm pitch? I have been using 3mm because I'm able to just order boosted board belts which are commonly available.
