I've read about Belts being at their Limit so why not gear drive?
Saw the Jed board about half an hour ago and decided... I can do that!

Anyone have any experience with this?

Nope but do it for science!!

Have you heard a Jed Board ?

Tried myself with both printed herringbone gear and normal spur gears:

You keep repeating this. But in all the videos published to this day it‚Äôs still very loud. 

Or is it still pre-production boards with non lubricated gears?

How are you going to make these? No printing please, except SLM:p

I could very well take advantage of an SLM 280 printer at work... well maybe.

How is the surface finish of SLM parts? Never had one in hands:/
Otherwise brass would be nice i think.

Not all that great.. Like a rough sandblast I'd say.

Whelp this is the result. Printing it right now.
Gonna print abs to see the fit and if that works annealed NylonX.

How are you going to deal with friction and heat? I guess you will need to enclose it, and put some lube inside.

Didn't @GrecoMan build something similar? He might be able to give you a couple tips and if it will work well

An advantage belt has is the ability to eat a small stone and flex off the damage, this setup strips gears or fails entirely, or if really strong emergency stops the esk. Needs a cover like any other D/D system for sanity's sake

Take a look at @Nowind direct Drive. Steel motor pulley and POM drivewheel. Tested hard on mountainboards without wear

I'm using a Alloy 910 printed gear for the wheel on my mountainboard and a steel gear on the motor, so far no problem or visible wear. Would strongly recommend something nylon based.

BS vid headlines.... just in my home country alone there are hundreds of little towns with steeper streets than the coveted Baldwin (imagine the rest of the world). Come on YT guys! Enough already with the longest piss competition.

check out 1:5 rc cars dudes... pom and steel been used there for a while by the high speed pass guys.

If you want to do something of value @bimmer develop a bevel gear system so a pair of 6374 motors can fit inside a regular width truck (side by side at 90 degrees to the axle) and they still wouldn't be longer than a pulley motor mount that is often at least 10/11+ cm from the axle so they wouldn't reduce battery space either ;)

The system you have now with the angled gears introduces lateral load to the gears so you need to have support in your gear box to account for that. Racing cars often use spur gears because the strength (power) to weight ratio of transmission is the highest. There are always exceptions but...

@DK-Odense Can you tell us about your results with the herringbone gear and also how they compare to the normal spur. And how durable are the printed parts?

For sure:

The normal spur gear needs to be in Steel at the motorside - No doubt. Quite noisy when driving, but most of you know this.

The herringbone gear is surprisingly quiet compared to the regular spur. I have only ridden a few km with this, but its seems like it is a much stronger transmission (tear) üëç so far this herringbone solution seems like the right choise for "printed" directdrive

Careful about using helical gears, you'll need to overcome some sideways torque due to the slanted teeth.

Not much room for misalignment with helical, they are unforgiving but work well when everything is right. They do produce thrust to the motor and hub bearings. I have been tossed 1 time with my open gear setup when a napkin wound up in it. Currently putting down 5200w per wheel on a mod.8 32p steel on steel setup.  Steel is strong and reliable.
