Which Motors can be considered as high quality and reliable as the SK3 ?

They have 5 Bearings per motor !

Looking because ...SK3 6355's dont have lower that 260KV.

Having 5 bearings should not be a factor in motor choice. What matters more is the durability, longevity, and size of the bearing being use.

One of the most important parts of our E-skates !

Well, that's about the most reliable component of our boards.  Look at DIY, Enertion, MEB...All vendors that make really good motors.

I agree with you @mmaner

Motors aren't exactly a big issue. As long as you don't cheap out

Some motors run well on FOC like the SK3 according to Chaka ,..some not so well?

Yea I'm not doubting that at all. 

But if a motor runs on FOC well or not doesn't exactly depict quality. It's just different

Some motors require some additional adjustments to observer gain to get good foc operation without over current errors. sk3's usually do fine with auto detection without additional "tuning".

I've been holding off on trying out FOC even though I'm highly interested in it. I'm using SK3's 260Kv,but I've been holding off since they arent sensored.  Is the fact that the motor isnt sensored a plus or does it not matter really?

I'm using your VESC's which I know are the most reliable but havent dared mess around with FOC settings yet.

@ Randyc1 If you like the SK3 you will like this one. 5 Japanese precision bearings, internal fan, 100% high temp copper fill, hand wound, hardened axle shaft, dual keyway, internal hall sensors, Ninja N45UH type magnets, dust filter disc, extended front cap for protection and cooling, stainless nuts and bolts, 12 mounting holes for angle adjustment.... Full Spec!

SK3 are around $80.00.

I've had 2 sk3's fail...they are nice but other esk8 motors feel more reliable for this application.
the sk3 has a bunch of bearings sure, have you looked inside? a few are tiny things....

most motors being used now are from a few factories, similar designs. On a well balanced system the motor itself is not going to make a huge difference in real world performance. There are now a nice range of motors by price, just pick the one that works best for your budget and build.

The screws on the front plate came loose then broke off. fixed one the other is still in parts....

since then i switched to one from @JLabs and another old diy 5065 for testing.
most esk8 motors have design like these with bearing outside the faceplate + circlip. very solid. no off axis wobble.
the sk3 has most of that load on the 3 m3's on front, bearing on the inside pushing against them.....

Tacon's have had a good reputation I might try that soon. or one of these
Keep in mind they are cheaper, but most esk8 sellers have to add a markup to make them worth selling so they are likely very similar in quality.

I saw the thread where you talked about your sk3 problem ,..you have to admit it could have been avoided if the screws had been properly tightened ,...another reported tightning these screws and had over 700 miles on his SK3.

Not sure if these BG motors will last that long ??

yes of course, but are you going to take off your motor every week and make sure the screws are tight?
maybe it was it a bad batch, but my point is these have another thing to worry about and need to maintain, with no upside since they are not the cheapest and there are many many more options now.

sk3s have been easy to get, thats why they are used.

and why not? just because its a random site? the design looks good i'll orders some direct from the factory if that makes you feel better? lol :sunglasses:

One thing you have to remember is that the SK3 line of motors probably vastly outnumber any other Motor being used in E-skates.  

Only time will tell if other motors will prove more reliable ?

All these motors that are being used for esk8-ing have were primarily and only primarily made for R/C Aircraft/Helicopter motors. (Tacon/SK3's/few others) Somehow they managed to get used in the esk8 and have been having a "good" reputation so it has come almost mainstream. Now there are motors made SPECIFICALLY for esk8-ing (made with revisions to better handle forces. yada-yada-yada), which come at a high price tag, but pays off as they don't break.

Wmj, i know you did the SK3 group buy with mods like Shaft length, silicon wires .

Do you think the manufacture could Change KV for 6355 Motor ??

Sk3 6355 is 260KV , for people who want a Double Rear , do you think they would consider lowering KV to a more suitible 200-220 KV ??

I dont think SK3's come at that size, its either

-5055(280KV)
-5065(236KV)
-6354(260KV)
-6364(190KV/213/245/)
-6374(149KV/168/192)

You compare apples to oranges. The standard SK3 is pretty low spec. You will never ever get a quality product at the same price of a budget one. You always get what you pay in the end. As I stated, the spec of our motors is top of the range and that is reflected in the price.

Does that also apply to apple .... :-D

Well, this is not always true. You have numerous example of vendors overadvertising their products to make them appear leagues above in terms of quality. The "image" can (and is) also sold with the product. I am not specifically speaking of esk8 vendors, my comment was more general.

5055's are only good for dual setups, and not that great then.  You will see a people using 5055's on a single motor build, but they do a lot of kicking to start and for hills.  Go for a 6355 or better,

Lol, wut??

50mm is what Boosted and Evolve use. Evolve just climbed the steepest gradient in the world with 50 duals. 

I think they fair better than "not that great". But yes, 63s will pull like a freight train with the right battery :slight_smile:

Kind of depends on the build and environment. AT setup, 63s are where it is at. 

Urban boards where weight or clearance is a concern, 50 will be enough and you'll get more range. Gearing and the correct KV can make a big difference. 

SK3 is a good near middle point too at 59mm. Wish I had jumped on the sensored group buy...

I noticed your motors use the same 3 m3 screws on the front design as the SK3 motors. everysingle one of my sk3 motors have failed at that point when taking my MTB off big jumps. Have you done any long term testing with your motors off big jumps? Or do you simply just advice agents going off any real MTB jumps all together?

Hi Homer900, our motors feature 12 M4 holes. If you want to go for crazy jumps, just make use of more bolts to fix it to the mount.
