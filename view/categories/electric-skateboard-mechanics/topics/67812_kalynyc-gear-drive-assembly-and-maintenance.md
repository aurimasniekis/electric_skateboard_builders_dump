Hello 
This will be an overview of my Gear Drive system, also a way for people to get advice and troubleshoot any issue. 

The Gear Drive is ship pre-assemble. 
included are : 

2- inner wheel bearing 9.525mm x 28mm
2- Spacers
2- O-Rings  
2- 3mm x 3mm by 20mm key 
8- M4 x 12mm motor screws 
8- M4 washers
3- Wheel hub plates 
1- Syringe to use as lube applicator 

![image|666x500](upload://zh5uydqJJRyXmKP9DBc8Cx4Ptjf.jpeg)

For lubrication I am using, Finish line premium grease  the 3.5Oz. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Finish-Line-Premium-Grease-Fluoropolymer/dp/B01G5VFCEQ)
Just use 1 Oz of lubricant for each Drive. 

Another alternatine can be the archoil [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Archoil-AR8100-14-Tube-Synthetic/dp/B00607KNN6)


Now to install your motor. 
The first step is to remove the screws holding the cover in place 

![image|666x500](upload://3rg2GYXmafrX7F1udNruDHGoBuJ.jpeg)

No need to remove the bearing or spacers. 

![image|375x500](upload://jd8NXrqN7SlES5F8qhQ4yTAvLAV.jpeg)

Next install the motor. 
The phase wires come out towards the kingpin side of the hanger. 

![image|666x500](upload://BD1Yq1xvNKZdZ0RPeUuXhG0brA.jpeg)

Then install the keyway 

![image|375x500](upload://yum16ZVz4c8f7sijVV19ijv4b0X.jpeg)

And spur gear. 
![image|375x500](upload://dqsntiuInUXy2JsY2TmfiZCPDoJ.jpeg) 

Next is to position the Gears. 
1st make sure the gears are aligned properly with respect to each other. 

![image|690x492](upload://uK9Ge6MN4nwXO5hQpK7ZXkpQoVa.jpeg)

![image|690x492](upload://nozeOCcaGHrIiPC7to1ClxUvSUi.jpeg)

2nd Proper gear Backslash, this will be done with the aid of a strip of paper folded in 2. 

![image|625x500](upload://5Im7NDxcfee51Gn0eGewddPwRKt.jpeg)

Make sure the wheel gear is properly secure see picture, this will prevent deflections by the gear. 

![image|357x500](upload://vtYXO109qLXJCp50NS4zOb8hdPj.jpeg)

Place the paper between the gears and press the motor gear agains the wheel gear. 

![image|357x499](upload://giSwXBcH45Kj2seXeSbawAaMN6a.jpeg)

one of the teeth from the motor gear should be aligned in between 2 teeth of the wheel gear, see pic. 

![image|357x500](upload://yN42EzNg6eKfZhatHyPLfBdxPuG.jpeg)

Next press the motor gear against the wheel gear, do not over do it, just push slightly firm so the gears do not have any play when the paper is in between the teeth. 

![image|690x492](upload://dKh1PJTGOVEEQzEsUgDnZh66L2m.jpeg)

![image|375x500](upload://qHzdvKbXsE3GoyC9n6efz3ceQ2Y.jpeg)
Now just tighten the motor screw on top, remove the wheel gear and tighten the rest of the motor screws. 
![image|357x500](upload://2GMBNP9wmH1sa2qtvWH8kDGcWM.jpeg)

At this point apply blue [Loctite](https://www.amazon.com/Loctite-Heavy-Duty-Threadlocker-Single/dp/B000I1RSNS) to the set screws in the motor gear. 

REPEAT  THIS STEPS FOR THE OTHER MOTOR AND GEAR BEFORE CONTINUING.  

Once both motors are aligned and the backslash is properly place, MAKE SURE TO DO YOUR MOTOR DETECTION. 

Next step is to reassemble the gear and cover. 

The speed washer is the first thing to be installed. 
![image|356x500](upload://aeFcRBdLyk78dfkdnFVpVpCWNIp.jpeg)

if your drive came with a 12mm bearing and have an sleeve, install it now. 
![image|357x500](upload://mhSEDlNxVwcbYc0iOyw76pde1By.jpeg)

install the wheel gear and rest of components in this order. 
Gear‚Äîmedium spacer ‚Äî long spacer ‚Äî O-ring
![image|375x500](upload://AcR5YAAX3WPQB6NNy0X9X0srZ63.jpeg)

Apply BLUE LOCTITE to all threaded holes for the cover. 
![image|374x500](upload://zcVrmMZdwBYDtRnM6HkFWCkhv5E.jpeg)

Optional apply a super thin layer of silicone on the edge to the Gear Cover to form a gasket.
![image|375x500](upload://kAu0IQIdZOHHV2qdzbKDtkV4e9o.jpeg)

Position the cover on the drive and tighten the screws, do not over do it, tighten just firm and let the loctite do its magic. 
![image|690x492](upload://xBbXGj9qagpxYAU0kx3pKEPTBrk.jpeg)

Now the V-Ring, At this point you will need to apply a tiny loop of lubricant  around the Gear Hub. 
![image|375x500](upload://gJd2QyassZ5lav8smh8MUlGnsZW.jpeg)

Install V-Ring 
![image|690x492](upload://uNBwAmsRphAJGWl4VexKVmPRbs.jpeg)

Make sure the V-Ring is flush with the edge of the Gear Hub, do not push it inward. 
![image|690x492](upload://p6s9k20fy2fSd7TKsbGzMFJwjEh.jpeg)

Next Lubrication. 
For this use the finish line premium grease [3.5oz](https://www.amazon.com/Finish-Line-Premium-Grease-Fluoropolymer/dp/B01G5VFCEQ)
Insert 1 Oz in the provided syringe,Red arrow. 
![image|375x500](upload://7V7CqcdMMi4gso0DIpRNoytnt2Z.jpeg)

And apply the grease by removing the screw from the lubrication port on the top, press the syringe firmly agains the hole and squeeze the lubricant into the Gear Drive. ![image|357x500](upload://hEC6kXblv1Mpgq3tIsaNyTkjvfd.jpeg)

Last is to install the wheel Hub plates to the wheels. 
- Remove the air from the wheels. 
- Remove nuts from wheel screws. 
- install the Hub Plate in the place of the screws. 
![image|690x492](upload://q9rJuzrRG8hHTLqNP2mB8SsgBfZ.jpeg)

Repeat this steps for the other wheel and you are good to go.

At the current price is still cost effective. 

Personally have almost 1500 miles on the first test unit, without any maintenance at all, want to give it a proper abuse test and the thing is just a bit louder no issues so far.

Ernesto I love this but I am holding back for two reasons 
#saving up for it
#the noise 
I can only watch videos of your drive and have not heard it in real life as none of us in London uk are riding it yet , I‚Äôm riding the old kaly belt version and it is very quiet (mostly) so maybe I am comparing apples and oranges , the direct drive looks so much much much more sexy than belts especially when the colour red matches the tyres and springs

The unit is way less noisier than the others in the market. 
I compare it to the noise level of a boostedboard.

If you take time and patience and with enough lubrication, this drive practically makes no sound. I‚Äôm not making his up, I tried one of Boston‚Äôs rider board with this  drive and that one was silent, like dead silent. The only thing I can hear was the motor spinning. It was a bit unnerving because my Kaly drive was a bit noisier. Regardless, you just gotta mesh the gears correctly
```

```
the noise from the gear drive is virtually non-existent thanks to the lubrication.

i have heard about 4 different Kaly GD's in person and the ones that ran on FOC almost tricked me into believing it was a hub motor (sound-wise, clearly not visually), like just ridiculously quiet. if there is any sound it's at higher speed, but I believe 99% of the sound is the motor whine, not the drives themselves.

if sound is the worry, i wouldn't worry any more, def. one of the best drives on the market i think.

Great guide and great that there is such a detailed description to your gear drive!
Maybe you want to rename the thread in something like "KalyNYC Gear Drive overview or maintenance"?

With the actual title it could be misleading as it more sounds like a comparison or overview between different gear drives. IMO

Interesting i was under the impression the foc on gear drives wouldn‚Äôt make a difference because of how nature if the train. Did it have alot of effect on the sound eminating from the motors themselves that lent to the near ‚Äúhub-like‚Äù sound?

with which motor shaft diameter your gear drive is working?
only 8mm or do you also have and option for people like me with 10mm motor shaft?

@pat.speed 
the motor detection can be made with only the motor gear attached. 

@Andy87 
Unfortunately for now only 8 mm motors, will change that on the next batch.

Clearly this guy is trying to turn a great product thread into a bashing thread in hopes it could be closed by the moderators or even drift the conversation away from the main purpose.

Glad we have a solid community and fair moderators.

My vote is to not reply him and keep the conversation on topic

@kaly I'm in love with my drives.

I‚Äôve been designing with an approach starting from the bearing and moving out to overhaul the whole platform. 

We need to move to automotive grade now, no more electrifying a device designed for another purpose.

Has anyone received the most recent batch of gear drives from Kaly?  I am needing to order some bearing for the truck that comes with them.  My original truck with my holypro 35 came with 12mm bearings.  Apparently the inner bearing on the kit is a 9.525x28 but does it does have some play in it.  I went ahead and ordered some additional 9.525x28 bearings from Trampa but I'm concerned that they to may have some play in them.  I don't know what is an acceptable amount of play for the bearing.  

I work offshore for a 5 day job and I'm heading out tomorrow around noon central time.  I'd like to make sure I have some bearings on order if the 9.525x28 bearings from trampa are not the correct ones so that they are at the house when I get home in the middle of next week.

Ernesto mentioned to me in a DM to replace the inner bearing as well but I'm not sure which bearing he is describing.  Either way I just want to make sure i have all appropriate bearings ordered if the 9.525x28 bearings from trampa are not the correct ones.  

Thanks in advance for any off your help guys.

I have nothing to add aside from: Great work Ernesto! 

Hands down the nicest geardrive I've gotten to ride, much less own. It's opened up my hill climbing experience like nothing else. Throttle response is so tight! 

To those reading: these things rock and look gorgeous to boot. Highly recommended to anyone looking for one of the most powerful and solidly built drive units on the market.

Ah, but what if you cnc'd a a replacement piece for that plastic piece? I think @MBS is considering doing some in metal in the future (I might be mis-remembering this though).

Or I will just wait until they are all Kaly parts and no Trampa...üòâ

I definitely want to get a Mountain(ish) board going sometime before summer with a gear drive.  But I also don't like the plastic part on MBS and won't use the tramp stuff.

I can't wait until all your stuff is in house or there is a better, more robust MBS option for es8. 

Only problem I will run into, is I like to DIY, and I will have to figure out a way to add my own flavor to some of your stuff without buying a complete.  Because, well,  just more fun that way.

How often do the gear drives need to be maintained? When do they need to be cleaned out/regrease/realigned?

The grease should be check every 3-4 months. 
No need to realign.

Approaching 4000 miles on my first gear drive. The only time I've had to change anything was because it's outlived 3 pairs of motors. Ridiculously solid.

Does this mean just pump more in, or do we disassemble, clean it out, and refill? Sort of like an oil change?

They're a hot flaming load of garbage while simultaneously being a lot of fun. Just say goodbye to your Wh efficiency.
