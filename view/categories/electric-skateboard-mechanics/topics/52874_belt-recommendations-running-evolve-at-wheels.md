I need some help with the last piece to my beautiful puzzle. Im in need of some help with belt length. I will be using the evolve AT wheels with @marcmt88 dual idler pulley mounts. can i use the 360-5m-15  belts or would i need a longer belt to accommodate the dual idler pulleys?

How many teeth on the motor pulley and how many teeth on the wheel pulley?

Also, what kind of trucks do you have?

Use a 340-5M-15 synchronous timing belt

(On one of mine I am using 15T / 40T ratio on the TB218 hanger and a 350-5M-15 fits perfectly)

you will need at least 450mm belts for evolve At wheels. 
try this calculator:
https://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/
and that calculation is without idler pulleys

I'm waiting for 430mm and 450mm belts and I will let you know if they work.

The @marcmt88 mount for TB218 trucks is 100mm center to center (I measured it) and he said he's using 15T and 36T pullies, which would be a 340-5M belt

You bring up a good point though

@rexpepper651 are you sure you're using a 36T wheel pulley?

oh, I thought that he is using 66T pulley with evolve AT kit. isn't 36T to little for AT wheels?

420-5m-15 pretty sure I measured and ordered belts for this combo last week At kit and Marc mounts that's with idlers. I had to companies cancel the orders due to stocking issue so, haven't fit the last piece myself. That pulley from the evolve kit is massive

got belts yesterday. 450mm works with both idler pulleys, but belts are really bent and they will get hot quickly even without load. I can take some photos when I get back home. yeah and belts shreds little pieces on tire side (maybe my belts are bad quality?). that's on 16T motor pulley. on 20T pulley, you can use only one idler pulley, but belt still gets hot without load. 
they sent me wrong pitch on 430mm, so I can not try those.

I did around 20km with this setup and there aren't any problems for now. Only thing is that belts are getting warm and motors are slightly warm after few km. On my 107 flywheels motors stay cold. 
Those belts on photo are 450mm, motor pulley 16T

Yeah sorry, I'm using evolve super carve trucks. But my mounts are normal mounts for caliber or tb218, so there is no difference. 
My pulleys are 66t.

What was the conclusion here @rexpepper651 @trancejunkiexxl @Tinp123 ?

I have the Evolve AT wheel kit as well but didn't buy any trucks or mounts yet. Trying to keep costs down.

I'm using a 410mm Length belts without the idlers. No issues with them being too tight or lose. I used the torqueboards 218mm trucks. 10-11mm were removed from the rear trucks on each to accommodate the at wheel and pulley.
