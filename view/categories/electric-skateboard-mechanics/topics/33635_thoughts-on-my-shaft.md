let me grab a couple links bro, in short: yes you can use other shafts*, you can even make your own out of drill blanks* :slight_smile:
might need some tools though like a drill press or a arbor press*
*I've got more experience pulling apart scorpion motors, ill be back with a link

Have you pulled down the motor first?
My 8mm motor shafts actually taper to 10mm (9.98mm) to press fit in to the bearings...
I see no one has actually clicked on the link so I'm just checking, also the hardened steel used for drill bit blanks will be more durable than stainless ;)
