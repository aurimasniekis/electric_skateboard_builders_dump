I have bought a cheap chinese motor mount from banggood and it wiggles on my truck. No matter how hard I try to turn the screws in the truck: It isn't sturdy enough. Probably the main reason is that the width of the motor mount is to small. I hope the video explains it all.

Current motormount:

My solution is to buy this motormount:
https://www.banggood.com/Electric-Longboard-Skateboard-Motor-Mount-For-5065-5055-6374-6364-Motor-p-1157722.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN
but that is again €15 to be spend..

Do you have any suggestion on what I can do? I am open for your ideas!!

keep the trucks but use allen torx screws with red(permanent) loctite. use something like jb weld as well
Or buy calliber 2 truck and simple mount from  @marcmt88, @Boardnamics, @TarzanHBK.

Yeah it's crap...
I had the same mount and never used the small sharp screws. I just used bolts to fix it and it never came loose.
Only problem the mount snapped after a month...

The other mount you mentioned looks better but never used it.

Hahah yes I know it is terrible. I have installed it backwards because the motor is to wide to fit in the slot so I had to do it (to em)

i did the exact same thing with mine. that means the hole spacing is wrong. get a new motor mount. and make sure it’s for 63xx motors

If you want a good mount which isn't expensive I should really recommend the hobbyking motormount: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html?___store=en_us

oh please for the love of god DO NOT try to put the hk mount on circular trucks. I tried it. I drilled out the holes, tapped them to m8 and torqued them with a god damn 2ft long pipe. I also made a flatspon on the truck and JB welded it. it doesn’t hold at all

I have bought some flat screws and they work already good, I haven't realy tightend them and the mount doesn't wiggle

But the mount is still crap, so I am going to order the one I mentioned. I will maybe cnc my own one if I have some free time :slight_smile:
The mount I will buy looks pretty sturdy in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kIpkjT0hmw

Do we need to tell you what's wrong?  You can have cheap or good, your choice.  Choose wisely
