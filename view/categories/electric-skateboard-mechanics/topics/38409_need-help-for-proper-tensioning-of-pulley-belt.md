Iâ€™ve been looking around the forum but couldnâ€™t find a good answer for this: I canâ€™t quite seem to get the belt tension right, either itâ€™s too loose or too tight.
My wheels are 90mm and my mount is too small to put an islet on without breaking or hitting something. Any suggestions would be appreciated!!

Iâ€™m using torqueboards 36t and 16t pulleys with a 12mm belt.
If someone can give me an idea for an idler that works too I just donâ€™t have a lot of space really to work with.

Just use bearings for an idler if you want one.  You can run the belt right on the back of a bearing

I tried mocking it up but I couldnâ€™t seem to get it to fit without the wheel pulley hitting the bearings.

I have 2 bearings and tried to put a bolt and nut on but the nut hits the motor and if I move the motor back any more the tension becomes really tight and it forces the motor.

Correct me if I've misunderstood, are you taking the belt off, moving the motor a mm or two then putting the belt back on to see what the tension is?

In order to incorporate a pulley into your mount, you will need a much longer belt. I would recommend laying everything out and tracing it onto your motor mount ie. Take the wheel off lay it flat on the center point of the mount, trace the shape with a sharpie. Do the same for the wheel pulley, the motor, and the drive gear. The next step is to find out if there is actually enough clearance for a bearing then you can measure out where to place it.

Another option is to do what @Deckoz did. His is the most clever I've seen

Yes, there is a photo of Deckoz's [in the other thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-obsession-with-idler-pulleys/30191/161) and it's also the best I've seen.  He uses the motor mount bolts as idler pulley axles.  Genius

With that size belt 265 and that mount, there's no way to make an idler work there just hasn't the room.

The best way to properly tight the belts, is trial and error.

Run it as loose as you can, go for a spin, if it skips teeth, adjust more, if it keeps skipping adjust until you have no skipping at full brake.

Well I asked for a photo of the wheel pulley to see if something there was causing it to skip (I can't see through the belt LoL) but I can see in the one photo the belt is too loose.  Move the motor backwards away from the wheel about 2mm and try it again

its possible for 265mm it wont engage fully but will work fine.best thing is that u dont have to care how tight the belt is. as long as it doesn't look like a ball sack <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/3/e3c3e2fcd13281f7bd931c41b7a42eb73b055fbe.jpg" width="690" height="388"> for this im using 2 sizes of bearing.

dude flip your motor pulley around. it will allow it to be much closer to the mount and you wonâ€™t have to bend the belt sideways to make it fit. should make tensioning a lot easier

I feel like from the picture his motor has another half inch it could move out. A slightly longer belt might give him one more tooth on the motor pulley.  However I've never had belts slip and I've had them fairly loose.  My method is to make the belt tight then tighten the motor mount just enough. Then I loosen the two back screws then the fronts. Just a little so as soon as the belt starts to make it a hair loose I tighten it up.  You should be able to push the belt with your finger and have it flex maybe 2-3mm

Are their belts usually so small as the width doesnâ€™t even cover the hole motor pulley. Is that normal?

To determine belt size with idler pulley you need to get measurements of everything. Basically Trace on paper to include idler pulley (s). But including the idler pulley will mean longer belt for you. Yours looks short already.  But you could get a longer belt to start then see if that works. If not then try the idler setup.

In the picture you posted, you belt looks way too loose.
In the video it looks a little tight.
Too tight and it can wear out your motor bearings faster.
Too loose and the belt may jump teeth when you brake too hard.
Try loosening the motor mounting screws and push the motor forward just till the belt feels snug. then snug the screws and check belt play. If you squeeze the upper and lower part of the belt together, each part should move about 1/4" without too much force.
Then test ride and try your brakes. 
Also learn to apply brakes gradually and not suddenly to avoid belt slippage.

In my opinion, the belt is only too loose if it skips teeth when you apply FULL brake going fast on a downhill.  If it doesn't skip, it's not too loose.  You should loosen it until it skips then tighten it a tad.  But that's just what I think
