Tried to unscrew the motors and pulley but I screwed up. 

This one I’m able to remove the pulley, but the last screw won’t move, and I somewhat stripped it. 
![image|375x500](upload://1ftRwWk9jeogLaf6qJpL62LYExo.jpeg) 

This one, I can’t remove this set screw. I heated up like the other one but it doesn’t move. I think I stripped it too. Fuck me. 
![image|375x500](upload://rBtVjCZPy36J8Y7iFWLwIhqBWFS.jpeg)

Any solutions guys? Any suggestions are appreciated.

Edit: also I sprayed lubricant to the screws. Does that make it worse or better?  
Edit 2: thanks a lot for your help guys. But the guy buying mine decided to save me some hassle by getting the whole drive train so I don’t have to remove the motors anymore. So I guess this thread serves as future reference for more shit up fuck with screws.

I'd slot a screwdriver in, glue it in place and then see if it works. If not I'd drill it out.

After that I would throw every single screw that isn't a socket away.

sad topic...but as for @mmaner, the subject title made me lough....nearly spilled my coffee.

two ways that worked for me:

Step one: lubricant to get the screw somewhat unstuck.

Step two: either rubber band or the the tool (see below pictures)....


good luck :-)

I like socket bolts. If they strip you can use a dremel to cut a slot for easy flathead removal.

What type of glue
[/quote]


Never use glue for something like this.  (In fact, just don't use glue anywhere, for anything.)  Use epoxy, like JB Weld 8265-S for example, and make sure you mix it properly.

Then the most important part -- DON'T TOUCH IT for 40 hours before trying to take it out again.  Make sure it's FULLY cured first.

Take the motor mount off the truck, take the bell off the motor, then use your hand to unscrew it. You should be able to move the rest of the motor instead of forcing the screw. Also a bearing puller is a cheap way to take you motor pulley off and replace gearings without damaging them (saves time and money)...good luck!

If you do drill it out, make sure you cover the motors with tape or a bag. I ruined a motor by not doing so once... the motor grabbed all the little metal pieces from drilling out a stripped screw. I didn’t think about this and the next time I rode, my shit got all fucked.

The philips head bolt has plenty of space left to torque on i promise. Im assuming you used red-loctite on these bolts?  If so, heat them up with a heat gun/hair dryer/torch as hot as you can(obviously not red hot if u use the torch). 

Then use one of these cheap impact screwdrivers to get the philips head bolt out: ![tekton-multi-bit-screwdrivers-2905-64_1000|500x500](upload://o75jwJvEqjPmWtYRfJmgTydbqUU.jpeg)

I think with a different Philips head and some type of impact you can get it out. If all else fails cut a flat head slot into the head of the bolt with a cutting wheel.

if you are careful you can drill out the grub screw one size bigger and then re-thread it to the next size up. But IMO pulleys are cheap, depends how much your time is worth to you.

Get a slightly larger torx bit or similar and knock in with a hammer and a bit of loctite and wait a bit (it works also without loctite). Then you ignite your pulley 1-2 minutes on the screw with a lighter. Then try very slowly and with feeling to loosen the screw. Always worked for me.

If not just drill a hole and drill a new thread if there is no second screw. Its not to big of a problem :)

What I have done to solve this problem with a striped set screw is to drill out the set screw with the drill size used prior to threading. Drilling down to the shaft until the pulley comes loose.
I have also used a similar  method to remove a striped Philips screw head. Drilling till the head comes off. Then either remove what's left of the screw with pliers or drilling it and re-threading the hole.
These methods works best if you have a drill press and a vise or at least a vise to hold the pulley steady.

What size is the set screw and Philips screw?

Brians couch still has the plastic on it 4 years after purchase and he has a 250 piece collection of boxed marvel characters that are still in the box from when he was 12.  The grey hulk he did allow himself to play with is still going strong because of jb weld.

Its ingrained.  

Love you Brian

Wow, I was in the EXACT same position as you a week ago. I got 3 screws off with no heat, then stripped the fourth. 

What I did was first get a small pick and clean out the screw head out of any debris from the stripping. Once the screw was clean, I applied almost a minute of low heat from a heat gun. Then I got a flat screwdriver, tapped it into the screw head with medium strength swings of a hammer, and then gave it a hard twist with as much downward force into the screw I could get. 

I made sure to pick a flat head that wasn't too thick and that was large enough to almost not fit in the screw head. If that strips or doesn't work either, I've used that shock driver @LEE mentioned and it worked like a dream in the auto shop.

So you don't recommend loctite either? Also not for the tiny little screws on your motor gear?

I agree with @b264, for less destructive purposes, use jb weld, works wonders. Or just drill it out.
