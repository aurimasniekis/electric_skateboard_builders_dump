After seeing that people made good use of the [Worldwide VESC Directory](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/worldwide-vesc-directory/16764), I figured I'd make a similar post looking at belts & motor pulleys from around the world. (The motor pulleys listed all have 8mm bore)

The lists below are partitioned by width but otherwise are in no particular order.

Found a great place to buy gear belts:


http://www.3vbelt.com/cart/

They have a great search tool.  So if you type in HTD 255-5M  it will tell you how many teeth and give you all the available thicknesses.  The belts are around $2.00 each.  The web site calculates courier shipping at $40 but if you send an email to the rep on the contact page and ask her to reprice it at china post rates, the shipping is $7.00 to the US.

If you can get your exact size on DIY electric There won't be much difference in price.  But if you need a specific length,  this can save alot searching and a lot of money.

I needed 290mm length which was not widely available.

They only have 10mm and 15mm thicknesses.  I wanted 12mm but I purchased two 10mm and two 15mm instead.  I think either thickness would work but I'm going to try 15mm belts and spin them against some emery cloth to take off one or 2 mm.

Here is a more detailed version of the above post with some hints on how to measure and calculate the right size if you need a longer belt.

---------------------------------------

In General, if you find a part price that you like and the shipping cost makes it unaffordable, then contact the company and ask them to reprice using China post instead of the courier price that appears on their web site.  The $30 to $40 shipping cost should drop to under $7.00 

The same can be done for US Suppliers, except you ask them to ship via US postal service instead of courier.

For example, I found a great place to buy gear belts from China for a size that was hard to find else where:


http://www.3vbelt.com/cart/

They have a great search tool.  So if you type in HTD 255-5M or  HTD 290-5M it will tell you how many teeth and give you all the available thicknesses.  

I used the search tool to find the right size to give me seven extra teeth compared to the 255mm belt that came with my motor mount kit.  You can tell how many teeth you need if you line the teeth up with distance you want the motor bolts to move back in the slot.  Then double the number.  I counted 4 teeth...

![image|690x387](upload://uIrSsM1mWYGhVIJL7UDIN4KkPcY.jpg)

My 255 mm belt postioned my motor bolts at the right most position in the slot.  I wanted to move to the left most positon in the slot.  Thats 4 teeth plus a wee bit.  But the 4 teeth needs to be doubled becasue you need 4 teeth on the botom of the loop and 4 teeth on the top. 

So double is eight but I decided on 7 extra teeth to be conservative. I did not want to end up with a belt that was just one tooth too long to be properly tensioned.

So when I search for my original belt and longer belts, I can confirm that I get 7 extra teeth:
![image|382x200](upload://aUonclxFR3IYxUdHSqWhnRbIHO.png)

![image|375x153](upload://52fxMIL9XHI7Vt6NCLxKSxwmTYa.png)

58 teeth - 51 teeth = 7 so I'm happy.

The belts are around $2.00 each.  The web site calculates courier shipping at $40 but if you send an email to the rep on the contact page and ask her to reprice it at china post rates, the shipping is $7.00 to the US.

If you can get your exact size on DIY electric there won't be much difference in price and the package will arrive faster.  But if you need a specific length 3vbelt can save a lot of searching and a lot of money.

I needed 290mm length which was not widely available.

www.3vbelt.com does not have the 12mm belt thickness that was originally with the kit.  The closest sizes are10mm and 15mm.  So I just purchased two 10mm and two 15mm instead.  I think either thickness would work but I'm going to try the 15mm belts first and spin them against some emery cloth to take off one or 2 mm.

I hope these tips work out for others.

Please add sources of wheel pulleys esp. larger sizes like 66T/72T that will work with Tramp and MBS Rockstar hubs....Aluminum would be nice but good fiber filled composite is also acceptable.
