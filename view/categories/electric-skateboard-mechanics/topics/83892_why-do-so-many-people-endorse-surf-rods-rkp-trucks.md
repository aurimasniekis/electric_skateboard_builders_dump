Standardized parts, well understood how to get them to perform the way you want, and generally a geometry that works out for the type of riding you'll do with an Eskate.

I was always told tkp/skp were tucked out of the way and better for coping tricks (grinds). Rkp are more stable at high speeds and responsive at low speeds. Rkp is typically a bit higher and (in the same holes) slightly shorter wheelbase. 
Skp/tkp in the park, rkp out. I could be totally wrong my info is from the people I trusted skating as a kid and not scientific 😂 

Theres a discussion here about it. I enjoyed the read.

Well if it helps at all. In my opinion I think the main difference is one word “slop”. 
Surfrodz or other precision machined trucks = no slop. 
Cast trucks = slop
Cast trucks can have looser tolerances and more imperfections than machined precision trucks. 
Slop can mean wobbles. 
I don’t think freeriders would notice as much difference but downhill and powered it can make a bigger difference.

Tkp are more carvy
Rkp are better at stability at speed.

No one mention channel trucks please

Well apart from me that time.  But no one else mention them.

@Sender had a catastrophic failure with one of those adjustable RKP baseplates on his 'build of the year'. Broke the deck all along the mounting holes. Think smtimes we shouldn't push the boundaries so much with the extreme angles they provide (LaCroix deck front angle may have also contributed to the demise)..

The other thing is it wasn't even the front truck.  It went backwards at full speed due to the user never haven even used a board and didn't receive any instruction.

The trucks were literally completely unaffected.  The front one you mentioned literally touched nothing and the rear assembly is still fine even after the collision.

Destroyed 2 motors, scratched the enclosure, and snapped the deck.  Not too bad considering the forces it went through being slammed like that at full speed.


Sorry if I am being overly defensive.  I am.  I want more people to try setups like this because it is so sweet, just want to set the record straight.



Hell, @mmaner got a Lacroix just to do something similar on TKPs because it rides so well.


(It is a factory second, so we are sexing it up a bit)

High speed stability I assume is the main feature for fast eskates. That and caliber II has a very convenient shape for clamping a motor mount to. Most TKP hangers have a weird shape that would be difficult to clamp on a motor mount.  

TKP can still be good with the right setup. But I think that is only surfrodz at the moment because the hexagonal hanger is easy to mount motors on.

Seems I stepped on some toes. It was not my intention to cause such a conmotion. Yeah, by your image posted in 'no words... just pictures' I tought that was the case, catastrophic failure due to extreme angled set up with those baseplates. Is good you pointed out the LaCroix fine behavioral aspects otherwise. Again, sorry if my coment stirred some confusion and produced such reaction, was not my intention. Pix out.

To answer your question is basically what @excess said.  Surf Rodz are precision trucks where the calibers that people are using are cast.  Caliber does make a set of precision trucks as well.  One of the major points in the Surf Rodz favor is that they can come with a 200mm hanger and 80mm axels this allows you to fit pretty much anything on them that you want.  Surf Rodz are actually some of the cheapest precision trucks around if you want to see expensive trucks look at the aera k5

Just higher quality. Plus they just sexy.
They have seasonal specials, currently its the rkp in 176mm($90 vs the normal $150) You can fit 6364 on these.
They also have a tkp truck.  Its about $120. If you're sticking to high 20s-low 30s they are great.
Especially if you like to carve.

It really is. Nothing wrong with caliber trucks tho.  But you'll feel a difference with surfrodz.  
Highly recommend the tkp if you're not pushing higher speeds.  I have them on two boards.  Rkp on one. 
Its definitely a big price jump from caliber trucks but then again we are riding $1000+ skateboards so :man_shrugging:t2:

No way your board is only $1000

😂😂😂.



But for real though, Surf Rodz trucks are so worth the quality improvement.  On these expensive builds, they deserve high end trucks, and Surf Rodz are an excellent option for a great price compared to other precision trucks on the market.


And there are readily available quality mounts from a number of vendors.

Hell, even some gear drive options are being worked on.



Not that Surfrodz is the only great option and they might not fit your build goals.

However they really do hit a sweet spot between flexibility, affordability, and good aesthetics.


That is why I am a big fan.  


However there are a lot of other systems I am very eager to try that utilize different trucks....

Just all in what you want and need.

It comes down to precision vs cast.  Precision is just better, but it likely isn't worth the increased cost unless you regularly go over 30 MPH.

Another perk of precision trucks is that the truck clamps always perfectly fit the hanger and you don't need to worry about getting the clamp super tight and there is never any movement between the hanger and the motor mount clamp.

And, they are sexy AF... Gotta respect precision machined components.

" Why do so many people endorse surf rods rkp trucks?" 

I was skeptical too, before this I had used the TB218 trucks which are pretty decent, similar to caliber. I had spent time tuning them to a point I was happy. But I would still get a little wiggle from the rear truck when hitting bumps at high speed.

Then I got some surfrodz RKP on summer sale for $120 delivered. Which is just really cheap for a precision truck. Look at the CNC machining and the included hardware and its hard to imagine how they make them so cheaply? 

The improvement in high speed stability was huge over the tb218s, I really didn't think it would be that much better but it is. I found the surfrodz too stable at first so had to tune them to be more nervous and carvy, but they still retain high speed stability in wild mode. 

My surfrodz are now setup for carvey steering and sharp u-turns. 
- Front / Rear. 
- 55 / 50 deg. 
- double cone / double barrel.
- positive rake / positive rake. 

I need to make sharp turns on my commute or I would have a more subdued setup.

I’ve been wanting to swap to feel the difference.
[/quote]

Mine was initially setup negative rake on both front and back. Was super stable. I wanted sharper turns and less wheel bite so I tried positive rake on the front. It gives a slightly higher ride height that helps with wheel bite. The feeling is more that it dives into a turn rather than building resistance as you lean. With front only it was a bit more carvey but felt quite stable still. 

Then I put the rear on positive rake too, now its super carvey, dives into full turn easily, so its a bit nervous. But I never get any wobble in a strait line or over bumps. So still stable in a strait line but nervous in turns.  

Im not really huge fan of the feeling, I would prefer a more relaxed feel but I need maximum steering lock for some tight hairpins on my commute. I think I am going to try steeper steering angles next and go back to rear negative rake.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/track-racing-set-up-and-riding-style/75142/89

The only thing here is that I think it can only be made on one side of the hanger. But that's a good start.

I've been hesitant to respond to this thread, as people get very passionate about trucks for some reason.  

I currently have 4 sets of Surf Rodz,  3 TKP's and 1 RKP.  Surf Rodz TKP's are my favorite trucks ever, they are carvy and stable and the bushing seat gives a lot of freedom to bushing types & bushing setup.

There is a huge performance difference in precision v's cast/forged trucks, the balance is better and they last longer.  It has to be mentioned that there is no other less expensive precision truck than Surf Rodz, but that's not why I like them so much.  If they were 3 times the price, like the Paris & Caliber precision trucks, I would still use them.  

Lots of people are looking for stability at speed and carveability at speed, typically this requires 2 different setups.  With SR TKP's you can hit 30 mph easy and still be stable and carvy at the same time.  Keep in mind that 'at speed' on a push board is massively different that on a powered board.  The weight difference and torque capabilities make esk8's a different animal all together.  

My biggest issue with TKP's is usually the lean return when coming out of a turn, the SR bushing seat solves this.  If I had to find something to complain about it would be that there isn't a large variety in hanger length on SR TKP's.  A 200mm TKP hanger would solve so many problems.

I'm not an expert, I just know what I like.  I've never heard anyone say they didn't like SR's after giving them a go.

Because it’s not really an opinion, even though my explanations were treated as opinion in the other thread regarding channels/trucks in general, as if I don’t understand how they work.

Anything is an opinion until a hypothesis has been formed and quantifiable data has been produced via controlled testing. I don't think we're quite there yet given the age of this sport.

I've learned a lot from your posts on here, I certainly don't just disregard your input, but I also will never blindly follow anyone regardless of their expertise without data to back it up. 

So I saw a lot of discussion of vehicle dynamics applied to skateboards, and some people saying: "that doesn't work" and a some people saying: "well I ride these daily and what's being claimed here doesn't match my own experience". 

In my eyes, that's a lot of opinions and most of the opposing discussion was coming from those who had "ridden their buddies carver for a bit" and suddenly have authority to speak on the topic. I'm not even pointing that at you, but that's how that discussion went down from my pov.

[quote="Deckoz, post:74, topic:83892"]
And based on my previous contributions to this forum, why would I suggest something unquantifiable?
[/quote]

Because for all of the vehicle dynamics terminology you've applied to the discussion, you've spoken almost entirely in theory & hyperbole. 

[quote="Deckoz, post:74, topic:83892"]
Because a leading wheel will always be less stable then a trailing wheel, and amplified when given power.
[/quote]

Sure, but could you quantify this statement in the context of ESK8? Scale & mass matters in vehicle dynamics. I'm not saying this statement is incorrect, but what does that equate to in the real world? Do these problems overcome any amount of rider ability, dampening, tuning at "50+mph"? 60? 

You simply stating they're inherently unstable because of X,Y, Z dynamics doesn't tell us anything about how this translates to the road. 

The original statement that sparked all of this was:

[quote="MoeStooge, post:52, topic:72054, full:true"]
Trampa stuff is niiiice. Too bad it dumps you on your face at 25+. I think they should work on that…
[/quote]

Which is utterly false. So what is true? Clearly we have riders that can take these to 30-40 which is what 95% of people would likely ever want, so what's the magic number that takes into account rider experience, board setup, road conditions? Calling them unstable when they can stably reach speeds the majority of riders are comfortable riding in seems contextually blind just to make a point.

That's my entire point. There really can't be. There's been a lot of speaking in absolutes without consideration for how many complicated variables are at play here.

Edit: i fully realize I'm a knob for managing to make this about channels

I'd like to propose a solution I think actually works when the 90% rider control is lost and that 10% physics take over regarding anti-wobble tech.

I 100% agree that most implementations we've seen have been dumb af. *But*, how do you feel about a steering damper applied to the rear truck? 

To bring back some of the previous discussion about the rear leading, adding a damper to the rear must help to mitigate some of that inherent instability back there. In my experience getting wobbles at 49mph, and in my experience adding a damper to the rear, I have to say I feel like it helped with stability a lot. I felt like I didn't have to be "as good of a rider" watching my every twitch, careful about my form and weighting the front as religiously as prior to adding the damper. I still do all those things but it felt like adding a safety net, my board ended up feeling like it would never just pop into a instability if I messed up like before. It just ended up feeling inherently stable. 

That's kind of of topic here, but you did bring up that you always talk anti-wobble tech down, so I just felt like I aughta bring it up.

I have not tried surfrodz yet but I do understand the price.

Honestly I've been using TB218 trucks at my weight for a long time with 3 different mounts and many different motors never had an issue, I did upgrade them to the almost precision kit from Miurskate and my trucks feel carvy but super stable even at my max personal speed of 47mph

@Deckoz you have been 100% right. These guys keep busting your chops and you have done an awesome job laying it out in simplicity.  Masking a inherent problem so it does what you want doesn't make it right, it just makes it work.  Development and testing is the only way to make a function better. Understanding a problem and understanding why it's a problem has to happen before a fautly design can be improved on.  Setup is a configuration to dial a function to do perform a specific task.  Channel trucks for EsK8 racing need development.  This development will make a better more tunable truck for Joe Rider.  To the Nay Sayers.  Use action, take your best and bring it to the hill.  
@deckoz I think you have beat the poor dead horse to an unrecognizable pulp and its time to bury it.

The nice thing about the rkp and hex tkp, they have shoulder bolts as axles.  So you can change the length. Comes in hand when swapping to pneumatic tires.  Or using pullys with integrated bearings. Also allows you to bolt your mounts at the very end of the hanger for lots of motor space or shorter bolts and move the mounts in for a narrow wb.

What is the difference from the indeez to The tkp they have now?

If it's well the question I ask myself ... 
As I understand the Hex is the original one (with the full Hex profil hanger), after they made the Grind serie for the skater, with a round surface under the truck  grind easier (than the multi flat surface of the Hex) and maybe a bit more stronger too.

So the indeez are the grindsz just the old name?  If you look at the surfrodz website under the truck kits all of them say grindsz
