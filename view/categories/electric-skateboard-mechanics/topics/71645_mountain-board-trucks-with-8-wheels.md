Hi There ,

Reacently i've upgraded my board with Mountain trucks and 8" wheels , for some reason i dont know why it is very difficult to take simple turns ..

I'm pushing to the end of the board limit but the Angle not sharp enough to complete simple turn.. 

Any ideas ?!![15398873411358429612298350998382|250x500](upload://v01reK9JexYtpRFqXzbaKVBzKad.jpeg)![15398874438116173779377219081355|690x345](upload://7YDbRTliYlMo4h04DTZOpEbLtJz.jpeg)

Most MTB trucks are at 30 degrees, longboard trucks are at 50 degrees.  You need to wedge them closer to 50 degrees to get turning radius.

EDIT:  most MTB trucsk are at 20 degrees.  Not enough coffee too :slight_smile:.

you will to wedge them 30 degrees or more.  I think @Kug3lis is the only one making them right now, @okp has some as well if you wanna PM him.

Ok got it so the raiser that i resived in the mounting kit not "high" enough.. So i'll try to add other one to add some degrees..

I'll update here if my simple solution will work .. Thank you![1385060981-908187908|500x500](upload://itVX7OFtKCnMyeZH0CjEo9vOndj.jpeg)  ;)
