Want to upgrade my build to 100mm Kegels.
If I get an Evolve pulley do I have to chop off some truck? Or can I do the old "reverse the wheel nut" trick?
Anybody tried it before? Can it squeeze on?

Yea you need to chop about 10mm off. I'd say get some @JLabs pulleys instead

It has a bearing with 10 mm bore so you would need to change that too. Plenty of other more durable solutions out there. Either BKB, 3dservisas (Kuglis) or e.board_solutions
