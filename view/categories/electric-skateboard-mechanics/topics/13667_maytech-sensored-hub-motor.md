They look like the raptor 2 hubs, they have the mounting for the precision trucks. I thought they were made in the USA? They look like the updated pictures Jason posted.

Dimension are not the same, and without the wright truck you probably won't be able to fix them to a skateboard... there no set screw.

These hub motors are not very good, in my testing jacobs outperform them on nearly every level.

 - the magnets are very thin & they are not custom made so there are lots of gaps & angled magnets.
 - the motor barrel is too thin & prone to warping. flux leakage.
 - the end caps are aluminum & very thin/soft.
 - the urethane doesn't have any teeth that mesh with the barrel. it's an interference fit.


from all my testing of china hub motors i couldn't find one that i was happy with, that is why we designed our new R-SPEC GHOST from the ground up so we can address all the problems.

this is how they hold the urethane onto the motor.

I have two Maytech hub motors along with trucks as sample order coming in directly from Maytech. Should arrive in 1-2 weeks. I can give you my impressions when they arrive, though I don't have as much knowledge of hub motors as @onloop, @Hummie, @jacobbloy.

My end game is to get sensored hubs on a set of avenue trucks, not sure if I can get these on there.  That would be stealthy riding in clouds.  A dream come true.

Yea these Hun motors look like they have a square hole on inside to stop the spinning around. If you look further up I linked the trucks take a look at them would be a bit of work to get them to work but should work.

I saw, looks like a good amount of the hangar is milled down as well .  Might have to wait till Avenue makes longboard trucks .  I have a pair of their 9.5 inch trucks currently and am working on mounting a regular motor on them like @Bender did, but hubs would be even better for those trucks.  Either way I think I'm going to wait and see how @rwxr likes them once he gets them.  What onloop said about these hubs and those pictures he posted is concerning.

Only thing is Jacobs hubs don't have sensors.  I need to have sensors, where I live there is a ton of start and stop and need smooth start from stand still.

Hi, I'm  also very keen on using/trying Avenue trucks for longboards. So far I have heard that the current Avenues are made for skateboarding not longboarding, altho Avenue has been designing longboard ones for some months now. r/longboarding doesn't seem to like them at all.  
I for one like the design, as it resists twisting, but same time has full-axle suspension - for increasing  the time of impact in case of shock to the wheels. To save the hub motors.
Do you think they'd work little better than normal trucks? Thanks!

This is the link
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/electric-dual-hub-motor-disassembly-performance/2038

I have to say they are OK, but not recommending to other member to buy. Mine at least have groves to avoid slippage for the urethane.

Main disadvantages:
- heating up for long maximum speed run (30min of 25km avg run) almost 80 degree celcius
- thin urethane
- hub cap easily get scratched or damaged as it sits in the very outside and closes to the ground
- my version vibrate at certain speed due to mechanical and or faulty construction issue
- require special truck to mount it

For now I recommend @Hummie hub motor or Jacob  hub motor and or wait for enertion ghost.

Jason who owns endless-sphere is doing hub motors on that truck because it's ideal for the stress sensors he uses. No remote. Stress sensors in that baseplate.

Just bought the new 90mm maytech. But effectively they seems to be pretty badly wired. Is there a simple way to arrange wires and magnet and improve the quality? As of today if I am correct there is no Jacob's hub motor anymore on the market... is that correct? Please confirm. thanks

Thanks a lot! Although the wiring is partly really not well done, the magnets don't look as bad as @Boca is suggesting.
You have to keep in mind that they are pretty cheap! 
If you take into account what normal wheels cost, and a comparable motor, they are actually as cheap as it could get... 
I mean if there's space on the market for better motors, where are them?

hey IMO, after some ride, its good for flat cool short cruising ride ...
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/img_20170613_223016_982.jpg
once launched on the flat it sends well against, almost a bit like in geared.
But I leave in pretty good uphill/downhill street and they clearely miss power, they hit so quickly, you now play a lot with the trigher, full trottle many time now so they cut many time ...
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_20170518_172607l.jpg
I was thinking about to drill some holes on the external flabby ...
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_20170827_031543.jpg
the bearings are to change more regularly I guess ...

Don't even expect as fun as a single geared setup with them :blush: just cool short flat cruise is the best for it.

Looks great.  Can you share your vesc settings ?  I wonder what kind of battery you are using, and what your battery max, motor max is as well as if you are riding in FOC or BLDC.  Thanks.

Yes, [all is around here if you want, on e-sk8.fr ](http://www.e-sk8.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1351&start=270)
I set 900w per VESC, motor and battery max 25amps, -20amps motor min, -10 batt min, sensored **bldc** (it was Ackmaniac FW... dont remember with, vesc 4.10HW) I only ride FOC under my V6 ... I received FOCBOX last week, but for an other build.

Here it is 5 x 2s 5Ah 20c Lipo :

Actualy, I get the little Dual ESC 30A (75Amps brust) FOC, switch and receiver integraded (so I buy the mini remote too) Just to geave a try, it looks good under 100€ for a dual for this little hub ... :

Don't take the time actualy, cause I was planing this under a cool flexy sweety long dropthrought deck  according to the smooth ride of the hub :blush:

when you say low power and only good for flat courses...that's cause you motor and battery amp settings are super low.  120 motor amp each vesc and you will feel differently!!  someone will tell you that's too high but for hubs I recommend it as long as your vesc is decent.  especially if your motors are wound with fat wires not dental floss, but even dental floss wire is good just not as safe if you were to stall the motor at low speed and be having huge amperage floating around in the motor for a long time

Thanks ! And true !! Wow 120amps :smile: for sure, should work better, some in france ride it with 60amps motor max and seams to be working good too !
I just don't want to stresse it to much, and like you say and it's my case, I need pretty much amps from start. The 1st 500m starting from home are full uphill (and a lot more around my country) I have to use a lot of my throttle ... and motor cut if I ask to much. And I appreciate to upgrade parameter more and more high little by little :D  Maybe 120 is a bit extrem, plus this motor got a huge Internal Resistance: 0.557‐0.577 and really dental floss wire as you say ...
I will give it a try for sure, plus I received FocBox ;)
But for now the question does not matter, since I also got this DualESC already pre-parameterized ...

We already integrated some NTC into the motor, to test them with higher currents to see the temperature rise with certain currents.
But I have to say that mine are wound differently (they did by asking), for lower kV.
As long as you have enough voltage, there is no problem with top speed. But the lower resistance is quite a win regarding temperature. It's the resistance that causes the inefficiency, and higher voltage is the suitable solution :slight_smile: 
Maybe some day I have the results of these measurements. I'm also playing with the thought of water-cooling them :sweat_smile:

There is an other rider riding them at 12s with vesc (it should be more parametrable than dualesc myatech).
