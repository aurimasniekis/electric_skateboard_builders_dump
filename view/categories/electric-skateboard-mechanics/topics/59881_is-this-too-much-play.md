Please see the short video here - my first build - trying to decide if this is too much play in the pulley...

I think it's ok because my dual belt drive has about the same gap.    Just don't set the belt too tight.

wheel pulley is horribly mis-aligned. Nothing normal about this. you need to redo the wheel pulleys. If that is your post i saw on reddit then im 100% correct. Visually i can see that it is off. Here is the picture you posted ![sample|500x500](upload://96OxB6W4ZBFx4diFifUcWQS4Pc5.jpg)

Edit: remember to tighten in star formation, always

Yeah already fixed that part. Had to grind down the pulleys a bit but now they are nice and snug all around.  Did star formation to tighten.

Nice.  I will sand the edge if my pulley too.  Learn something everyday.
