Hi!

First of all, sorry if this is the wrong sub-forum, wasnt sure where to put this! :smiley:
As the title states, I'm looking to permanently mount my battery box, but am unsure how to.

These are the options i've considered:
Bore holes all the way through the deck, and doing a nut & bolt setup, as i've done with the trucks.
Just use a screw and let it screw into the board.

Im thinking boring the holes might be better, since screwing a screw into the board would expand the wood, and maybe creating a weak point.

So what should i do?

Regards,
Leonardvdj
