Hello guys! 

I am new the the forum and I considering build a electric long board for commuting to school and my work. I am using a Loaded Icarus deck, but what I was wondering was if their is enough clearance for all the components.  This is a drop thru deck, but after looking and measuring the parts relative to my deck I think I can fit all the components. Just need some advice.

I love the Icarus... I want to build one too. If you do a split enclosure and dual hubs, you should still be able to have a decent battery and power without sacrificing the amazing design of the board.

I don't have it in me to cover the board graphics tbh. I'd probably leave it as a push board. It's beautiful.
