I have the HTD265-5M belt from torqueboards and it broke this morning. This is my first failure of a belt from them but was wondering if there was a stronger/better belt source. Where do y'all get your belts.

I get them from here:
https://powge.nl.aliexpress.com/store/all-wholesale-products/702327.html?spm=a2g0z.12010615.0.0.371c6f35plbqSS
They have a wide assortiment and are pretty cheap, only downside is the max 12 day shipping time, but what I have ordered came in around 7 days

265mm belt https://www.ebay.com/itm/D-D-PowerDrive-265-5M-15-Timing-Belt/111965445722?hash=item1a11a91e5a:g:szAAAOSwdx1aFk9s

By far the best price in the US.
