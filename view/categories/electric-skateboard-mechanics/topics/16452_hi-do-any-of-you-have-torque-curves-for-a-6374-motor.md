I would like to use them to calculate my gear stresses.

Does anyone have a torque curve for any motor on their board?

I've thought / looked up for this, too!

The closest I've got is just to use watts for power rating.. 

Some say you can calculate direct torque on wheels by using that measurement..

I also saw that @Pedrodemio had posted some ''torque'' schematics.. he might have some answers to this question.. try to look up a thread about batteries or something similar, where he has posted..

Not yet, i have the theoretical power/torque requirements of a board

Again, theoretically motor torque is T = (I*60)/(2*pi*Kv), but on a real motor they are probably far from this 

The guys from @Mellow have been placing a few boards on a dynamometer, you can find some of the results on Kilian Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/the_endless_engineer/)

As me, @KMeyerson and others have discussed, we have to design an cheap universal and reliable dynamometer that anyone can build and them we can build a motor database and find whats best from real data and not marketing crap

It would be really easy, just use a phone app and enter your weight + weight of the board. In fact, if used correctly, these apps are really precise.
