They work with V3 mounts. I don't think they work with V4. Enertion's do.

2 screws are enough to hold it on there. Just make sure they are tight enough to withstand vibrations while riding

IMO: I personally would not feel comfortable going with only 2 screws.

No way am I using only two screws. I'd rather play it safe and drill a couple holes

I am hoping to have our drive system out withing the next couple of weeks. They have the x pattern slot too so they are compatible with almost any motor.
