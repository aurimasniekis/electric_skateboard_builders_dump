Hi,

I'm currently using single tacon bigfoot 245kv motor with 36/15 gear ratio which lets me drive at a top speed of ~33 km/h.
I'm about to add another tacon motor(Diagonal) and I don't want to change my 6s 30c 8ah Lipo battery. 
What is the best option for gear ratio which will have nice torque and more speed?
I only want to change the motor pulley since I have a bunch of 36t wheel pulleys to match my Kegel 80mm wheels.
Will 18t or 20t motor pulley be good? 

Thanks!

Use this to get your desired speed:

Hi TarzanHBK :slight_smile:
I'm well aware of this calc.
I mean for torque and speed, what is the best combination?
I want it to go to ~40km/h so If I change the motor pulley to 18t or 20t will it be overgearing?

depends on how heavy you are, how hilly your ride is and how you define "a good torque".

If you had good settings with one motor and 33 km/h you wonÂ´t have trouble gearing to 40 km/h with two motors

Yup, had good experience with one motor. 
It had fine torque on 18 degrees hill or so.
I weight 70kg.
