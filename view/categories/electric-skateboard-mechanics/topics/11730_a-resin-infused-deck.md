Just watched this, know there are a few of you trying different things out, so thought worth sharing.

nice video, was a little weird seeing him pressing stuff into form with clamps when you have a vacuum setup active :stuck_out_tongue:

after my vanguard diy replica, Im still wondering why resin infusion over a handlayup. especially his dry spot in the video or the delicate issue of too much/too little pressure and resin channels - these are all problems that dont exist in a manual layup.
