Finally someone has made a press fit mount for us RKP Surfrodz owners. Big shout out to @psychotiller for making these. I know alot of people who wanted a mount for their Surfrodz RKP. Surfrodz trucks are hard to beat for the price especially when they have the 30% off special.

I made a discovery  today while assembling a pair of 176mm RKP's, the profile shape of the 176mm isn't proportional to the 200mm hanger..

This means 2 corners on the 176mm hangers will need to be filed down to allow the motor mount plate to rotate. 

I would recommend ordering 200mm hangers if you are opposed to a little filing.

[/quote]

...Concrete info, 
When you order your trucks, if you don't get them from me, Make sure you order 200mm with 10mm x70mm axles. If you do that, You will end up with the right amount of spacers to make this work.

I include two 10mm x 80mm axles with each mount. You can use the 70's but will most likely want the 80's. 

When you get your mounts, all you need to do is put a few spacers on an axle, Put the axle though my mount, and put then put the axle into the hanger. Align the mount correctly and tighten down the axle which will press the mount onto the hanger. Put alot of force into this operation to make sure the mount is tight against the end of the hanger. This will ensure it is squared up. Then put the motor plate to the inside of the mount, adjust it and and tighten it up.

Here's a pic:![IMG_20180519_193604|666x500](upload://fV7kauSLAryG6wYufspWyi2SiQU.jpg)  and in about an hour I can put a video here which is uploading to youtube.

Thanks man this helps a ton. Especially the "what to order from Surfrodz" part. Lets try to get all the info close together in this thread.

Is the mount angle adjustable?

Reverse mountable?

Space in mm between the motor mount points? (do sk3 6374 or the new sk8 6374 fit? With 12mm or 15mm pulleys?)

I just won a Mantis microscope on ebay, gotta take a breath buh I'm in, perhaps multiple sets.

@PatRocks I blame you for catalyzing this!

![20180514_183029|476x500](upload://hHGAjwquRiWsI9ms1TyAAevoyz1.jpg)  this is the older style, but 6374 sk3s atill have tons of room.  As far as belts go, you can definitely fit 15mm belts, just takes the right axle length and right spacers

And yeah adjustable and reversible

Is the mount angle adjustable?  Yes the mount is fully adjustible

Reverse mountable? Yes, but it works better opposing the kingpin.

6374's will definitely work. Maytech open motors.

SK3's are bigger than 74mm (86 I believe) So no.

Those are the old bolt in RKP mounts though.The press fit uses some of that space and then the mount plates have to mount inside the flange. You lose about 20mm

Yet another pesky question:

[quote="psychotiller, post:40, topic:54299"]
Reverse mountable? Yes, but it works better opposing the kingpin
[/quote]

Will these motor plates fully clear the kingpin? I ask because i have major space limitations on the inboard side , and with my ridiculous batteries, reverse mounting gives me perfect weight distribution. 

At this point, I feel shitty for asking, but could you upload the measurements of the motor plate? Pretty pretty please @psychotiller ? As I've indicated  (exhaustively) my finger is on the purchase-trigger... And it's getting itchy. In fact, if you just clarify about the reverse mount part, I give.
Thanks for all this trouble

## \#47 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2018-05-21T03:02:15.162Z Reads: 244

```
It depends on your motors really..If they are short enough to clear the king pin there isn't an issue. However, You cant raise them as high on that side because the motors will hit the hanger.

the motor plate has a 71mm center to center distance. 

If you absolutely have to reverse mount. Use 50¬∞ baseplates. The shallowness of the 45 is going to give you a headache.

I always wondered this when looking. I assume they are because you can select the color for two base plates and hangers, but they don't let you choose the second base plate angle. WTH.

SR hanger end to end is 200mm, so if you add (2) 80mm axles you will have about 360mm total width.

You don't actually count the whole axle. If you use the 70mm axles that they come with your only adding 20mm to each side via the spacers so, 240mm. If you get @psychotiller's mounts with the 80mm axles you could have, potentially, 260mm total hanger length.

Nope! It won't work spacing wise unless you're some kind of David Blaine.

I have a new design coming soon with a bigger flange/bigger mount plate that will clear the hanger and the outside of my mount. (I consulted Blaine) Guess what? They will also fit 176's.

Hear that @PatRocks?

Thanks @SORRENTINO 

I also jumped in for the 30% off sale and picked up the rkp 200‚Äôs all in raw. They couldn‚Äôt process the international order through the site so I had to email them. Amazing fast service. They through on some extras too. Shipping was expensive though... ordered Friday and here on Monday. Just outside of Toronto Ontario. The pic will tell the story. I‚Äôm extremely happy. 

*edit also paid $36 CAD  in fees and tax as expected.

hey guys, i have a question about installing this.

are the red spacers bearing spacers?  as in, does it go inside the wheel?

![image|690x260](upload://jnIp9rnRZ1ONwkYhkUsMJ7psofq.jpg)

if they're NOT bearing spacers, are we supposed to supply our own?

if they ARE bearing spacers, i'm finding there aren't enough spacers to make up the excess space on the axle:

![ezgif-5-407ffa933c|400x236](upload://YZUS7YTgf5og7PhY5Go1tGI5FQ.gif)

Your trucks should have come with two black 10 mm x 10 mm spacers and to 5 mm by 10 mm red spacers per axle. It does not matter whether you use one black or two red bearing spacers
Edit: my setup from inside to out is as follows 
1 black spacer, 2 red spacers, inner bearing, black spacer, outer bearing. The head of the bolt will sit flush with the inner race of the outer bearing

ok, the mount takes up 5mm off the end of the hangar, so then with the 80mm axle it requires another 5mm spacer to fill up the space.

is that right?

My tkp‚Äôs came with 3x 5mm reds and 2x 10mm black spacers last year with 70mm axles. So I transferred the extra red to the new rkp‚Äôs. 
Do psycho‚Äôs mount really come with 80mm axles? I tried to order them from surfrodz but they don‚Äôt have such a thing. Aftermarket?

For everyone using Surf Rodz... 

Don't use the set screw to secure the axle, the tortion stresses from riding will scar the axle and make it hard to remove the axle.  The forced removal will scar the inside of the hanger. Use loktite, your good to go. 

Afternarket shoulder bolts work great.

Yeah, its fucked.  Not their fault really.  We are running longer axles than they even sell.  Guys, this is all my fault, just be careful.

I did reach out to surfrodz, not asking for a freebie, but hopefully they will give me the 30% off from the flash sale that was literally last week.

It is not the threads that are messed up. They are hardened steel and are completely fine, this is the actual hanger shaft.  If I can get a "replacement discount".... it will only be a $40 fuck up..... I think I just want a new one.


BTW, @akhlut, you have the adjustable TKP baseplate right? I can't remember....

Do you think it could adjust to negate the 30 degree mountain board angle on the lacroix like the adjustable RKP base?

With the TKPs, you gain like an inch of clearance is why I ask.  I could run these with 107 thane, but 6 shooters would be mighty tight...  with the thane I have 85mm unflexed in the middle on the stiffest Lacroix.  I actually think this is going to be fine for a street build.   We shall see.

Guys, Surf Rodz is awesome.

I reached out and they are giving me the 30% off not only on a replacement hanger, but also on a set of 10mm TKPs 177mm and 10mm bearings! 

They really didn't have to do that, but they did.  It's like I got the hanger for free and bought a set of TKPs.

Thanks Mikaela!

10mm in-wheel spacers seem hard to find.

https://www.mcmaster.com/#89955K799

Hollow steel tube ID .394¬∞ aka 10mm. Who can cut square and repeatable?

EDIT adding more stuff to this originally crap post.

- the spacers you can buy from SR look very nice, will do the job.
- Spacers are usually 10mm wide.
- Precision ones are nicer for sure.
- Aluminum is not the best, deforms too easy. Steel is mo betta. This goes for speed rings too.
- Abec11 introduced bearings with integrated spacers and speed rings called Biltin (thanks @ChrisChaput!). Zealous, etc. are lowballing them out of the game. I'm not sure if this is a bad thing overall.
- Seismic Tekton (integrated spacer/speedring) come in 10mm. Expensive.
- I found some 10mm spacers, $5. As usual for exotic serious stuff, sk8kings, and Khiro. Aluminum... http://www.sk8kings.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SKKRO217&Category_Code=BE
- I think I can cut repeatably on my little bandsaw, but not sure about parallel.

For everyone using Surf Rodz‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt use the set screw to secure the axle, the tortion stresses from riding will scar the axle and make it hard to remove the axle. The forced removal will scar the inside of the hanger. Use loktite, your good to go.

It's where the set screw goes in to secure the axle.  It's that little slot twords the outside if the hanger just past the threads.

Dang, Mike, is the same problem we faced with motor pulleys and grub screws... best solution, just Loctite 680. In this case is blue Loctite. Incredible. The best solution in this cases is taking away the culprits and go with just the compound. In the pulley case, those grub screws and keys are irrelevant little gremlins that you need to take out of the equation immediately.

I bought five or six sets of Indeesz when they came out.  Unless they‚Äôve changed things since then, I‚Äôm pretty sure the threaded part inside the hanger is a helicoil, so not too sure a thread chaser will be much help.  Maybe a reamer.

If you look at your bolt only the smaller 8mm end is threaded.  The part that gets dinged up is the 10mm smooth part, the axle.  Surf Rodz bolts have a recessed area that allows the grub screw to mar the surface of the bolt, without causing any problems in taking them out.

Still, I stopped using the grub screws eventually, because there will almost certainly come a time when you forget to remove them when taking the bolt out.  When that happens you will end up with the same situation as above, with either the axle stuck in, or, the hanger messed up, if you manage somehow to get the bolt out.

2 more photos to show clearance. Motor centers are below the axle (when oriented right side up). There's a bit of clearance, so I think it could be brought closer to the deck by a mm or 2.

	pulley	68	71	74	sweetspot

	15/40	269.4	285.1	290.9	-> 285
	16/40	281.4	287.2	293.0	-> 285

If buying a bunch, vbeltoutlet.com with the $30 fast shipping will quickly become economical, at about $2/belt. This will be my first time, so can't vouch for them.

NOTE metro pulleys are too much for 80mm axles

NOTE jlabs most recent pulleys have a face on the inside, need 80mm axles. And they're 12mm. The way these mounts work, the press-on part might work better if it can recess into the wheel pulley cavity. And would allow maybe 70mm axles.


The surfrodz 10mm bearings have a red side and black side. I don't think it's a big deal, but anyone know which side faces out?

@Holyman92 cab you mount them in the wheel with your bare hands or you need to press them with the axle nut and tools? Are they easy to remove just like regular 8mm bearings?

I mean... I put them in by hand... they even fit my 3d printed rims

@Eboosted they aren't bad and they are snug... the main difference in these is the thickness

Legend! didn't know anyone made 10mm bearings with built in spacers. Is there any other brands that make these?

I couldn't find any for 10mm. Seismic is a good old brand like ABEC11. ABEC11 I believe were first to market with BILT-INs.

Haha it's cool but I don't think it'll make much difference for eskate? Maybe if you're looking for additional water resistance.

guys, just get bearing from surfrodz, they're like $10 a set.

$90 for a set of bearing is fucking stupid, and i remember someone's ceramic bearings exploding on their esk8.

@thisguyhere I cruise at 25mph steady and have been for months on the same set of bearings... I also maintain my bearings VERY well... usually every saturday/Sunday  i will break my wheels down and clean my bearings and add a drop of speed cream when they dry. My board tops out at 27mph however I have it limited from the vesc to 25... but the balls are trisilicon nitride, the same as the seismics... 

Also, like I said, I free wheel a lot because I enjoy kicking every now and then. And I like how well my board freewheels even with a belt on w/ ceramics

It's a bit more, since you need in-wheel spacers, and 10mm precision spacers are nowhere to be found. I think surfrodz's 10mm axle spacers will work okay. But this closes the price gap a bit, at least to the non-ceramic Tektons.

Eh I've spent money on stupider stuff :) I really like ceramics on my LDP deck, where every inch counts. But the difference is pretty subtle IMO, and they don't last forever.

Also not all bearings are the same. Definitely the no name generics are not as good. The top shelf ones are good, but not so different from the middle tier. I have no idea where the surfrodz 10mm bearings are in the spectrum. Price would suggest the lowest tier. And IMO on electric setups, difference is minor unless they're so terrible they seize or blow up.

I have been rolling on Surfrodz 10mm bearings for 100's of miles with no issues. Don't let the price fool you. Also, if you bought the Surfrodz 10mm trucks, they come with the 10mm bearing spacers.

On a side note, @thisguyhere your 6374 motor can take a beating man... snapped my deck last week and it slammed the motor on the can, I bailed almost instantly but the can still took the brunt of the snap and it's still alive

Dont, they are junk...  Let me qualify that.  If there is any play in the wheel hub at all, i mean .25mm is too much, they will turn to shit and lock up and throw you like a bull.  I learned the hard way, my elbow is still not healed from that spill.

Not their fault really. We are running longer axles than they even sell. Guys, this is all my fault, just be careful.
[/quote]

I thought about this for a while, since you use after market shoulder screw and the grub screw retainer, the grub screw damaged the shoulder bolt then made a big mess when removing. While the standard bolts have a small relief for the grub screw, so even if it damages the surface it should not result in the damage we see here? I think that is what happened. 

Since I got surf rods I removed the grub screws due to the warnings in this thread (I still use standard 70mm). I have not used lock tite due to lazyness but they hold in good. But I found that the grub screw hole fills with sand and water and rust the fuck out of my axel. So I would recommend putting something in the hole with loctite but not screwing it all thay down.

Thats good advice.  I put a grub screw in with blue loctite but just have it sitting in there, not actually torqued down onto the shoulder bolt.

There's a 10 pack somewhere, but these are the bearings I use. Love them, contact rubber seals, last forever, less than $2 per wheel. Let me find the 10 pack...

Jsb great bearings is the seller I prefer. HCH is the manufacturer. They run silent. Install and forget they exist

EDIT: I can't find the 10 pack ü§¨

I looked at those but couldn't figure out if they have **contact** seals or if they're just "shields"

If you like grease in your bearings, and dirt out of them, you need contact seals

They have good rubber seals on them and are greased well. Ive been riding them hard out here in hawaii for over a month and they feel as good as the zealous bearings i use on 8mm axles (they are my favorite). These fasteddys were recommended by @mmaner

No, I don't think they are needed as the bolt head does not overlap the seal on the bearing. 

But if you need to space your wheel out a 1mm or 2 for alinement then they can be useful.
