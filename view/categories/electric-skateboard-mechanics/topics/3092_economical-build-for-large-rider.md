EDITED

Totally new to e-skateboards im a big guy (250lbs) and im currently putting together my first build I have ordered and decided on these components so far for a dual drive build

1 cheap ebay knockoff wheels also considering 90mm
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Green-Longboard-Flywheels-83mm-x-52mm-Multiple-Color-ABEC-7-Bearing-Spacer-/281745438943?hash=item41995638df:g:h7sAAOSwLVZVnxUJ

2 cheap ebay knockoffs of Caliber trucks (another member posted a link for them and i went ahead and ordered them)

3 Enertion VESC x2 i already preordered  at the sale pricing
http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-motor-controller/

4 200kv olliboard motors x2
http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/om5065-200kv

Looking into the following

1 Batteries im more than likely going to use a 10s system 
2 Gearing- im still not super sure where i will order my parts from but im thinking a 16 to 36 tooth combo
3 Motor Mounts- im deciding between @psychotiller 's mounts or enertions, Need to figure out the price difference with shipping ( recommendations are appreciated)

any tips and recommendations are welcome and appreciated

Welcome to the forum @ecuadorche !

By the time you buy from all those 3 different places you would probably pay more than the enertion single motor mount pro kit. You can upgrade and add more motors and motor mounts as you go on. If you are making a dual motor in the future I would buy two vescs now so you have the same version.

thanks!

i was thinking the same about the vesc get two now and upgrade later im also thinking about giving my wife this board if i decide to go with duals later and just doing a new setup then

the price of my single drive mech kit is around 160-180 with shipping 
enertions offerings are great but a little out of my price range atm i would have preferred to do that instead but cant atm have a small budget and i need to keep it that way

ive looked into that as well my kit is still around 50 dollars cheaper than theirs that is if it all works together, any recommendations for motors and batteries?

```
I recommend 230 KV motors, product/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-230kv/
They are expensive, but they will work great.
Batteries- It depends on experience and preference, either lipos or flatpacks, you will probably want 10s minimum

what about a hobbyking equivalent im concerned with the price i know that what you suggested is more sturdy correct???

i would prefer lipos which models and c rating would i need???

with a larger weight just get a 149kv motor from hobbyking and run 10s on it with a 15/16 to 36t gearing rario

also get those wheels from ebay i have a pair and they work great! Also use a 15mm belt with 5mm pitch

why use a lower kv instead of a higher one as suggested earlier???? ive looked around but couldnt find the reasoning or good explanation
```

## \#11 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-05-10T22:34:13.595Z Reads: 92

```
lower kv provides more torque, higher kv provides more speed. If you want torque, you'll want a lower kv motor.
```

```
The lower the kv the more bottom end power....at the cost of top speed.

The higher the kv the lower the bottom end....hence stressing the motors....

Stay 200kv and lower and you'll be set

EDIT: I think we are slipping guys


Please see this:

Then hit us with questions

70 to 75 efficiency

12 to16 pulley
36 pulley

And just tinker with the numbers etc

Higher kv would be reccomended for a single if u were around 150ibs with a larger weight we need an increase of torque too push the body without straining the motor too much hence the lower kv

Yeah you are right, I did not see his weight, around 200 or less would work

so i used the tool you provided i think a 200 kv motor i what i would want??? maybe  with a 10s system of batteries???

what if i go ahead and do a dual drive system??? could i get away with higher kv engines???

can the vesc support 12s worth of batteries without any damage to it??

If u have the budget go dual but basically u just double the cost of whatever a single build would have been

Yeah man ... Play with the numbers ... Switch up the pulleys ... 

I gave you the pulley range cause that's the most common

You will want to think of lipo voltage and set up

Two 5s = 10s

Or 

Four 3s , Three 4s , or two 6s = 12s

Or

18650 battery pack

Now what ESCs can you use that will run 10s -12s?

Now what motor can handle 10s or 12s?

It's all connected...

So what's your flavor?

I've built a few boards and am a bigger guy too.

I'd suggest a single 63mm to start if on a budget.  around 190-200 ideally or 230-245 optional (limit <10s later).

I regularly ride on my GF's 63mm 200kv setup and it moves me along the flats just fine (i'm 265lbs).  Small hills with a running start work too.  From a dead stop - no way.

My Marbel board is a 50mm motor i believe and it moves me along too.  Not a hill climber for me, but being sensored does help.

I'd recommend the R-spec 190kv if budget allows.  SK3's around 190 are great too.  I really want to try DIYes 230kv sensored soon paired with VESC!  I have 2 Tacon's to test one day soon, and a pair of the 6355 R-Spec (original batch red) for one of my 3 in process builds.

I definitely recommend a good motor mount.  if you have a flat deck (no drop) the enertion ones are really nice and i like the quality and CF for bling/light-weight.  My v1 DIYes also work well but are a bit fiddly to setup the first time.  

Definitely go VESC if you can.  Again if budget is tight - get one good setup (on 15mm if you can) and do diagonal drive later w/ identical motor and an additional VESC later.  Will definitely move you along just fine.

Welcome, HTH and GL!

i forgot to mention pulleys.  No offense to Enertion, but i'm not a fan of the 3d printed wheel pulley.  Especially not for bigger riders like you and I.  Too much torque and faster wear.  I had one printed in the strongest Nylon on Shapeways about a year ago.  I have it on my GF's board and even when tensioned as tight as i'm comfortable - it will still click on hard braking in particular.  That means skipping.

Now maybe he's using a new uber material, and perhaps some more aggressive teeth profile to grab the belt?  The 12mm (vs mine at 9mm) absolutely will help!  BUT at the end of the day it's going to wear faster with us bigger guys.  I would spend a few $ more and get one in aluminum or steel.  I really like the older kits he had with the nice anodized blue aluminum wheel gears - but doesn't look like it's offered any longer.  bummer.  My current favorite is the DIYes one which is aluminum and also hollowed out under the gear/teeth which gives a smidge more clearance around the axle of the truck.  Minor feature and not sure if he still has these...

And again 15mm wide belt and gears for a single setup - more contact area will help when properly tensioned to keep it from skipping when braking hard.  Dual 9mm has been fine for me in the past, but if i can fit 12 or 15mm i might do that just to have more contact area.

GL!

It's not 3D printed...3D printed pulleys break....
It's some fiber glass reenforced stuff... Hard as rock

Thanks @Michaelinvegas!  That is good to know because they aren't cheap.  I'd still prefer aluminum over plastic (even glass reinforced), but that's just me.

I ordered two the other day...should be here by Friday ...that was super fast...(thanks @onloop)

Yeah the pulleys you can't break with normal use...now if you hit the corner of the curb...that would mess up an aluminum pulley too

I just say no to 3D print when it comes to moving parts and the board .... It will just rattle that shit to pieces

so do you think a dual drvie 12mm setup would be fine with a 190 km motor and 10s with vesc
 using enertions pulley belt kit??

[/quote]

You won't be able to fit a dual 12mm pulley setup (at least as a dual rear).

I'm actually gonna do a dual rear with one of the mounts reversed.
