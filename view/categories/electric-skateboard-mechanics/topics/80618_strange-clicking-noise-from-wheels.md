I recently realised my wheel nuts were too tight and not allowing my wheels to spin freely. So I loosened them and now they spin freely. Only issue is that Iâ€™ve now got a noise from the wheels that wasnâ€™t there before. I assumed that Iâ€™d loosened the nuts too much so I tightened them up a bit until just before they started to impinge the bearings and slow the wheel down, but the noise stayed. 

Iâ€™ve made a short video to help diagnosis.

Do you have a spacer in each axle between bearings?

Iâ€™m not sure. Iâ€™ll have a look tomorrow, but Iâ€™m sure I do. The board came almost fully assembled from Trampa and it only really started making this noise after I loosened the nuts.

Is it only one wheel? Drive wheel?
Swap the bearings from the good wheels and check again

I'm not sure. I can't isolate it as it only happens when I'm on the board.

You'll have to start swapping things and pay attention to where the sound goes. First make sure you have spacers inside each wheel and you're using speed washers on both sides of *every* bearing (the spacer acts as a speed washer also)

The nut should be as tight as the possible but still fix the hub or squeeze the bearing.
You can just try to move the hub on the shaft.
As long as you can move it a bit itâ€™s too less.
How about your belt tightness?
It looks very tight kn the video?
Maybe you just need to loosen the belt a bit? ðŸ¤”

Iâ€™ve tightened the nuts until I canâ€™t feel any movement in the hubs. Any tighter and the wheels wonâ€™t spin.

How tight should the belt be? I getting belt slippage when I brake coming down a hill. I thought that it had to be tighter to stop the belt from slipping?

Hard to tell how tightðŸ˜…
As lose as possible but still tight enough to donâ€™t slip.
My belts slip a bit when I do a hard instant break. 
Canâ€™t tell how it would be when downhill breaking, we donâ€™t have so much hills here.

I crank my wheels nuts all the way down. They are tight but I have proper spacers so it does not affect bearings. My wheels roll forever.

I will have to with on my wheels a bit tomorrow. I spent today trying to fix my remote and ended up killing my receiver.

If those are the bearings clicking then I wouldn't ride that board. My guess is you indented the inner / outer race with the ball bearings when tightening them.

I think you might be right. I went for another ride today after swapping the bearings and spacers of the rear right wheel from the outside of the shaft to the inside of the shaft. I took a video and the sound is worse, especially when I'm turning left.

I think it might be to much tension on the belt, can you loose it? A little misalignment could be causing a belt teeth to glitch (the sound), and because belts are too tight, it might happen. I have a 2017 dual  pro belt motor mount from trampa, same sound, then let the idler loose, just enough to let the belt run as free as posible...and fixed it...Hope is the same issue...

I have fund that if the bearing sits loose in the hub a sound like yours can come. It gets worse when cornering (I have only experienced it when cornering or breaking). A slight coat of red loctite on the bearing might fix that. 

If the bearing sits loose or there is a bearing pocket problem it doesn't matter how hard you tighten the nut it will still sit loose.

Don't ever put loctite on bearings.

This tells me there is a spacer/washer problem.

So do this, take it all apart on 1 axle and then put it all back together *except without the wheel*.  Measure the distance between the two wheel bearings on the axle.  This should be the same distance between the bearing seats in the wheel hub.  Report back what these numbers are

I would only lubricants like oil or grease on bearings.  Never threadlocker or loctite.

 I HAVE SAME NOISE !! I have to take wheels apart and back together for noise to go away. No clue why but its almost like the  guides for the wheels make it click somehow. This also only happens when weight is applied. Not a bearing problem as I have new bearings and everything . Can anyone else explain?

I replaced all my bearings bushes, spaces etc and my noise went away. I think I overtightened the wheels when I first got my board.

This happened with my wheels at one point too, but with flywheel clones.  Basically the sound turned out to be the bearing shifting around tiny bits within the bearing seat.  The plastic would creak depending on which side it was on.  Over time they had worn the bearing seats a little bit bigger than they were supposed to be.  When I switched to my new authentic ABEC wheels the noise went away.  

It is also possible on flywheels that it is the sound of the screws that hold the pulley on flexing the spokes, that sound has come from them before as well.  Additionally it could be the bearings like others said but in my experience it was a combination of things.

This makes a lot of sense to me and I bet thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening. Thanks for the info I guess Iâ€™ll have to just get the megastars lol

To be fair if you are upgrading to softer wheels than you already have it makes a world of difference, you might want that anyway haha
