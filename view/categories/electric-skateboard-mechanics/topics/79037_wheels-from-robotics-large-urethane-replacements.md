Anyone ever experiment with wheels from the robotics world? These are 6 inch wheels that appear to have rubber durometers that are close to what one would want from skateboard urethane wheels. The hubs have predrilled mounting points for gears to and are probably bolt on compatible with many robotic HTD sets. They're a bit narrow but the hubs look pretty beefy.

Maybe if you stack a pair for each and split the load (kinda a 8 wheeler in 4 wheels setup) just like cargo vans... But it seems a bit fragile to me? Usually robots (in the Robot war Def) are not as heavy as a human riding on a wood plank, no?

Yes I think that would be the main problem, but the hubs look reasonably beefy. I was looking at the pneumatic wheels on their website as well, but they are only rated to 500 rpm which yields about 11mph, so those are unfortunately a non-starter. 

I don't see anything wrong with doubling them though (aside from maybe needing a longer axle or hanger?)

The main reason I brought them up was both their price (less than 15 each, which is incredibly cheap) and the fact that they already have sprocket mounting holes.

Those remind me the onda wheels.

Those have been very well tested and are very good for esk8

Very interesting. I have never seen those Onda's used before, but if they are suitable, these robotics wheels might be even better as they already have the attachment points for belt sprockets. 

I sent an email to andymark.com to see what type of bearings these wheels accept. The design docs show a through hole diameter of 0.96 inches which is a bit obscure so I'd like to know if I'll need a special bearing before I order a pair for some experiments.

Those andymark wheels are designed to be driven on a carpet surface. The spikes don’t hold up to terrain very well. 
Weight is probably ok, the robots are 120lbs with another 20lbs of batteries and bumpers. Close to 150 total. But they’re also usually used 6 or 8 per robot, rarely 4. 
I wouldn’t recommend them based on the spokes breaking if you hit a pothole or bump hard. But weight wise they’re probably fine. The urethane is also fairly stiff and wouldn’t make for a very good ride.
