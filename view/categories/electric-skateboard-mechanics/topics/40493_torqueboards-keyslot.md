I am using a @torqueboards  motor and mechanical kit, but the key doesn't fit in the slot on either.  Is it ok to just use the bolts on the flat spots?

It's not ideal, but doable. I'd recommend taking a file or sandpaper and shaving down the key until it fits.

Nope those things never fit the first time what you do is you get a file it down the side till it goes in

@The_Bob You want them slightly loose too. If they're too tight and you force it in. Will be much harder to get it off in the future. Should slide in and out easily.

You can use a dremmel and pliers to make the keyway a bit smaller.
