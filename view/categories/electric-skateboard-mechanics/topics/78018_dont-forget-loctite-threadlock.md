I was taking my board apart to put a new sensored motor on my board. Rode it about 4 times before and didnt use loctite. Already had screws loose everywhere. Wheels, gear drives ugh. ![20181214_141130|375x500](upload://cfDJ1vVN9ROjFFxBQOunl7dLxvf.jpeg) how i found the screws on my Jenso Drive. Use loctite on everything... also a helpful tip bc loctite runs and stuff. Bought empty nail polisher bottles to control my liquidsXD ![20181214_140852|374x500](upload://k1rZi6qjtA7URoq8ds8mpm6HdpP.jpeg)

Red can be more trouble than none when it never comes off and strip your stuff. Go blue or green or something.  Teflon tape works well but not too well

seriously you have teflon taped all those tiny screws?  :joy:
another day another adventure.

Now I know why the windings in your motors are so precise.

I did the same thing on my jenso drive and damaged my gears on my first build two years ago. Tough lesson learned. Jenso and everyone on here always preaches this info so it makes you feel even more silly.  :D

I only ride ONE time to test stuff without Loctite, and stuff is **always** loose after that one test ride.

I use this a lot especially on stuff I don't need to remove.  It will release with heat though but it holds really well on bigger screws.  It also works well on pulleys in much the same way as 680.  Has a filling quality.

Its liquid thread tape essentially

Permatex Gel threadlocker is great... doesn't run as much as loc-tite

Oh my goodness, damn you autocorrect.  There are different types of loctite, right? What kind is good for what parts of the board?

Purple for anything really tiny...
Blue for anything that you want to be able to unscrew with hand tools and a bit of force
Red for anything that you want permanent... Requires a lot torque or heat to undue

Green for bearings

When do you need to loctite bearings?

Is that an emtb thing?

Wait a minute, is that for when you replace motor bearings?

A bit different from loctite. Put in on the screw, wait 15 minutes, then fasten. Can do a few cycles of insert/remove. Great for spare screws ready to go.

I like this stuff so far. Good to carry in the toolbag I take when I ride. Kinda don't have to wait for it to cure. Don't have to carry the whole roll -- just wrap some around something small and throw it in the toolbag.

Also hobbyking sells ridiculously cheap generic threadlock (and CA glue and epoxy).
