Hi, I need to get a motor mount but are already over budget by a lot. How can I make a motor mount cheaply!

product/welded-motor-mount-63mm-motor/

Buy this an weld it...

The clamping option is not much more...

Not sure how "Cheap" you mean

You can use a normal drill. just start with a small hole so you can get it lined up correctly, then gradually increase the drill bit size.


Also, 50/63mm for that welded mount refers to the size of the motor.

you really dont need a drill press!
if you have a good bench mounted vice, a hand drill and some little rounded files and fat ones youll be alright 

The only part you will need to drill dose not need to be square just yet

scribe out what shape you want then drill atleast 1mm form the edge so you can fix it up with files later on if you didnt get the drilling square

Or make one from carbon and resin with a mold

Mold 25$
Resin 25$
Carbon 10$

Or do a mold with expanding foam and traditional carbon layup exoskeleton



Or get your trucks with the wheel and wheel pulley on, and your motor with its pulley and the belt, hold it all in position and get someone to put epoxy putty everywhere it needs to go.  No ones tried that yet I don't think. 

Or decide it's too hard to make a mount and make a hubmotor.

if you want a really cheap motor mount you need only Z or L steel bracket(2-3$) and 4 screws with self-locking nuts (~1$)

@mohammedex @onloop @link5505 @Michaelinvegas  
It was my firs "300$" longboard :) Then did not want spand a lot of money, but I had a great desire to make a electric longoard. 
This motor mount hold very nice - ~250km without problems. To prevent slipping I used a little bit of hot glue. But for more stability I recommend to use 2 steel brackets(2mm thick) together.

I'm bot sure about the material it is. I just found it in my garage
It tends to bend a little bit, that's why I added the small threaded shaft you can barely see behind the motor mount

The way I managed to mount it a bit specific because my trucks were not round and I used this "weird" shape in order to "clip" my custom made mount
Actually A threaded shaft with bolts is fixing the mount and the truck reinforcement is preventing it from moving
It's hard to explain... Ask me if it's still unclear for you...

Let me nagg @MrEpiquad its his design :P, we share the same mancave. The mount is extremely simple and even lower cost making it a viable option to produce in larger numbers (lasercutting is cheap, we don't bother about painting it). We did this as an experiment and it works perfect so far. 

We have the benefit that aluminium is soft and it will form around its host (the truck). We abused it quite badly and it still holds up. We used very high pressure (from a hydraulic bearing press) to mount the mount, we are quite sure it will never come loose. The caliber trucks are conical so perfect for press fitting.
```

## \#61 Posted by: MrEpiquad Posted at: 2016-05-24T16:33:30.916Z Reads: 465

```
It's very simple and @JTAG already revealed a part of the trick, the aluminium of the truck is so soft that you can make a press fit of -0.1mm fit with ease. And a important step is to get the contour of the truck right and after some measuring and calculating we came up with this fitment. 
We driven it for several days now and there is literally zero backlash, so it is proven to work with just a press fitting.
But maybe for long term we will use Locktite+activator to make sure it can survive the most intense vibrations.
Another option is to use allen grubs screws to make sure it always presses into the truck with equal force. 

But for now this is just a fast mockup and I have bigger plans to make it more fool proof and easier to adjust.
So all by all much more great motor mounts to come :smiley:

Yes, the truck clamp feels quite solid. It is 12mm thick with 20% infill. The motor mount plate was lasercut with acrylic for testing. Planning to use 4mm carbon-fiber sheet in future (I am not sure how thick is the enertionboards carbon-fiber sheet).

Many builders asking for the stl file. Here it is: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1620720
Have fun :slight_smile:

BTW, due to the elasticity and the surface of the 3d printed material (ABS or PLA), the mount will slip once there is too much vibration. It is better to bite metal with metal.

@GrahamZhu how would I go about to CNC it with a router or mill? Not really a CNC person but if you can PM me some tips and steps I would greatly appreciate it!

Hi @c4Lvin I m not so familiar with CNC also. Just sharing what I know. Normally manufacturer needs STEP file and PDF file (to label some features, as STEP file aren't showing some features such as tapped holes, tolarence, etc). When designing the mechanical parts, you have to consider the machining capability and the machining cost. Here are some examples I can quickly find online: http://www.efunda.com/processes/machining/mill_design.cfm

no problem Graham. I appreciate very much of your assistance already. I'll try and ask some friends to see if they can do any CNC! Would be nice compared to 3D printed materials. Take care my friend!
