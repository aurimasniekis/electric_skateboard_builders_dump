Hey guys, this is my first post, so don't be too harsh on me :)

I am in the process of building my first esk8, and I recently finished my drive train. I just want to know what you guys think of it and if it looks cool.

For my motor, I am using a single SK3 6374 192kv with 15mm HTD5 belt (gearing ratio 15:36). Both pulleys are aluminum. I am also using 100mm MBS All-Terrain wheels. I am also planning on running 10s as 12s is a little scary.

I machined the mount out of 3/8in (~10mm) aluminum sheet, and modified the paris trucks on a lathe. The mount is held in place by a screw, for which I drilled a small hole on the trucks to keep it from rotating, and it feels pretty solid with good clearance. I also didn't make the motor position adjustable because I 3D printed some prototypes until I achieved good tension, so the tension on the belt is perfect. I have a 3D printed guard/fan on the back of the sk3, but I have no pictures of with it mounted.

Looks good although the motor is very close to the ground. Might consider raising it if you can.

Also keep in mind that that belt will loosen over time, so may need to implement a tensioning system eventually.

@Trdolan03 I raised the motor a bit so now I have about 3 cm of ground clearance. Is that enough?

@chrischo1996 I was thinking about adding an idler pulley.
