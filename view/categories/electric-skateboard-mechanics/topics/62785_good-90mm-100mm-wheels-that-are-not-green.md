So i have some pretty horrible roads where i am and the 83mm wheels i have just aren't working out, so i thought i'd look around for some 90mm-100mm wheels but all i can find (aside from no brand crap) are green.. and unfortunately i have a personal hatred for the color green.. (plus is dosnt match my board) so are there any good reputable brands that sell 90mm-100mm wheels in yellow,orange, or red? (or black too i guess) or will i just have to get clones?

I've heard a lot of bad stuff about those wheels. Not sure if its still the case but those wouldn't be my first recommendation.

Nobody linked the obvious ReFly ? Black color & Abec11 genuine. Metroboards also has Abec11 wheels with red colors (one is clear red, other is matte red like posted above).

It seems like I read that the green core can be dyed in a rit dye bath? Can anyone confirm?
