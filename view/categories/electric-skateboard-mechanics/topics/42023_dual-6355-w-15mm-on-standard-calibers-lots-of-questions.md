Alright, I've got my parts together for my big upgrade to dual drive following the failure of my Sk3. Got my totally bitchin motors (thanks LHB), my drivetrains, and my mounts (thanks Santa!). Started putting it together, aaaaand

shit
I have the mounts pushed out so far that they are scraping the wheel pulleys (just for mock-up purposes). even unscrewing the wheel nuts as far as they go while still having purchase on the threads, and pushing out the wheels, it seems i need just a few millimeters more to fit the motor in there. can i make this work without buying anything else?

i just ordered 107 superflys on ebay a few days ago. Should i just bite the bullet and get 12mm pulleys for them? should i stick with the 15mm pulleys and get tb extended trucks (which would actually be cheaper)? should i even change my wheel pulley size (currently 15:36)?

Dual drive 12mm should be just fine for rough riding. It’s a cheap fix, nothing worth redesigning your entire drivetrain over. I’m still rocking the 9mms like @Namasaki, they work just fine for me. Alternatively, you could get the Torqueboards extended trucks but that’s bound to be more expensive.

One-piece motor mounts could be enough for ya. I think there are at least two members making pretty decent ones.
Price wise, it could still be cheaper getting 12mm pulleys/belts. Motor pulley can still be 15mm...

i mean, the pulleys are gonna be about $40 each, plus belts... I'd say its gonna cost about $100 to get 12mm

Just grind them down... no need to buy new ones. That way you just have to buy belts, about 10$.

that's clever. It'll take a while with a dremel and a file but nothing i can't do in a day. On the other hand, since i'm upgrading the wheel size, i might need to get different pulleys regardless. any idea where the best place to get affordable pulleys is? BKB is good but kinda expensive for me at the moment.

I have a coupe extra 40T/ 9mm aluminum pulleys for flywheels you could have cheap if you don't mine trying 9mm belts
They don't have the same sudden stopping power as 15mm but they have worked well for me.

I also have a bunch of printed 36T/9mm pulleys if you want to try it on your smaller wheels.

>sudden stopping power

this was kinda what i was after with upgrading to dual drive. still, 2x9mm IS more engagement than 1x15mm. I'm not sure yet.

another option would be to get a set of Torqueboards 218mm trucks which would give you plenty of room.
I have a set of them on my dual 6374 build and the ride on those wide trucks feels amazing.

that's what i'm leaning towards right now, and leaving the 107s and their pulleys for a different day. i'm gonna try to roll for a $25 discount on the DIYesk8 site to get them for a little cheaper.

You mentioned wanting more stopping power. Wider belts and larger wheel pulleys will help.
When I went from 36T to 40T I had noticeably better hold when braking downhill even with 9mm belts.

Have you tried using an extra speed ring or two to space the wheels out an extra 1-2 mm?

not exactly. As i said in the OP, nothing is super firm in the picture, but the wheels are pushed out as though they had spacers, but there aren't any physically in there at the moment.

As above, it should be possible but an extra speed ring or two is almost mandatory, of course wheel core size comes into play as well as mount width

You can also flip the lock nuts around and only engage a few threads. I've only tested this for a little while so I don't know how long it will hold

Flip your mounts so one is under the board one is out behind the board that is what I am doing.  If you mounts will allow it.  It would be the cheapest way

Here's mine set up with 15mm pulleys, just waiting for the 15mm belts to arrive. In the meantime I'm using 12mm.
I used cut down spacers to get the exact spacing and I use normal wheel nuts and they get nicely onto the nylon,(just).
I don't know if this is a good idea but I found these. Do you think these might be the answer?

those mounts look almost exactly the same as mine... are the enertion trucks wider than calibers? also, your motors look a good bit smaller, and your wheel pulleys are different. Maybe that also has something to do with it.
```

## \#32 Posted by: bigben Posted at: 2017-12-28T18:46:38.989Z Reads: 108

Mine are caliber trucks. The motor cans are 55mm total from the face of the motor to the end of the "nipple". There is 1mm between motors. So the space between mounts is 111mm.
Any other measurements just ask.
If it gets really tight one of the motor mounting bolts heads might need to be flattened so the belt doesn't rub.

hmmm. I'm thinking maybe the distance from the core to the edge of the wheel is less on those, meaning the pulley is a little farther out, and that a 15mm dual drivetrain isn't possible on flywheels the way it is on kegel cores.

Wierd I've personally installed dual 6355 on caliber with 15mm for somebody using the aluminum+cf version of that mount, is the one you have thicker than that one?
```

---
## \#42 Posted by: faithfulpuppy Posted at: 2017-12-29T00:06:16.114Z Reads: 88

```
mine is pure aluminum but to my eyes it seems to be the same thickness as the cf. The part that's specifically conflicting with the wheel pulley is the head of the middle bold on the clamp-to-motorplate connection, so perhaps a larger wheel pulley would just clear it by going around it?

You might also be able to grind down the inside of the lock nuts to get a few extra mm's. Another idea just off the top of my head would be to shave down the inside of the wheels so the pulleys sit further out. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a lathe

im gonna grab some spare nuts i have off my sidewinders and try grinding them down with my dremel. If all it takes is one or two mm then that might just be enough to tip the scales in my favor. I'll also remove the outer speed ring.

The speed ring keeps the bearings from binding up.  Use a thinner speed ring instead.  I have no idea where to get them, but let me know if you find them.
