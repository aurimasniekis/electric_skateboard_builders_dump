Just saw this post in the pictures only thread and was wondering what are these small connectors that connect the motor wires to the enclosure called? Where to find them? I feel like these are and look better than just drilling a hole in the enclosure and inserting the wire through raw.

It would be a panel mount bullet connector that you are looking for. However the pictures appear that the wires are just put through holes  in the enclosure with maybe some heat shrink where the wires go into the enclosure.
