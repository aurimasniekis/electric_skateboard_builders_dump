Hey guys,

So purchased a eBoosted (10s4p vanguard) enclosure and a 12s3p battery pack from Dave (Psychotiller). 

Problem ran into is the enclosure will not fit the deck with the battery. There is about a 1/4 inch of a gap. 

Thinking if the deck is routed out where the battery sits about 1/4 of an inch deep it should be able to close without a gap. 

My concern, would I have any issues with deck after routing it? I know the vanguard is a flexy vertically laminated deck and I don’t want it to break. Maybe apply epoxy after? 

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or think if itll be okay to route out the deck. 

Thanks.

That will fix your problem, it’s pretty cheap and is really useful

Foam it up, no need to route the board, it will fit after enough foam.

Yeah. I feel routing would cause issues with the deck @Jasonkimberson

True. Also be an easier option than routing
