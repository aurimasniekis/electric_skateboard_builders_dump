Post tool recommendations for mechanics.
My contribution is the auto-punch, impact screwdriver, and scotch brand blue masking tape.

I use the tape to layout my drill holes, deck reshaping, and any other need reference point. 

I use the autopunch on all the spots I plan to drill so my pilot holes have a spot for the bit to grip. I also use it because the punch marks  once made don't rub off.

Impact screwdriver, does wonders on striped bolts, and seized fasteners. I've personal removed a  nearly stripped 100 year old flat head screw with one.  Good tool.

This is a rad set of tools. They are called tap and drill guides. You can hand drill some pretty tough angles with this guy. Good for square and round stock, Just clamp it if you can to the work piece and drill or tap your hole. Makes it easier to tape holes because it give the tool head some support.

Don't know what to call this, but I always call it a "third hand", and it's real handy when your soldering. I really don't know how I soldered with out it.

Good one, if your using wire chrimps then you need the right tool to chrimp them one. Otherwise it just looks ugly and the connection can go wonky.

I know Loctite has already been covered, but LOCTITE PROFESSIONAL. The best. IMO The applicator tip and bottle design make it easy to use and it doesn't get crusty like the old tubes used to.

Whether you are trying to repair a broken part or just trying to keep your fingers from falling apart after a gig...
@Lawndart @L3chef Are you guys musicians? That baking soda/Loctite trick is pretty sweet. Makes guitar nut repair pretty easy. Even if you have nearly zero tools. I use it for fretwork too. Just put a drop at the ends of the frets and let it wick under. Clean up with a damp acetone rag and it's set for level and crown. Plenty of times on a gig/sesh this stuff has saved my butt. I dab it on my fingertips in thin coats, let dry, and smooth it out with some 220Grit paper. Works great...

Not a musician, but I messed around in a punk band when I was a teen. My brothers the musician, and music teacher. I just help him some when he's working on his instruments. I'm in Oregon too, outside Portland.

My eboard  is basically ready for assemble , just waiting on the battery pack, and I'll need to do a little cutting and drilling ports on the enclosure. I'm guessing I'll get to do a little riding before winter.

They aren't great, but not much is anymore.  My grandpa used to swear by Craftsman...I break Craftsman sockets on a regular basis.  

I tend to buy inexpensive hand tools and expensive power tools.  Harbor freight hand tools are as good as anything you will find at Lowe's or Home Depot.

I agree with you on the hand tools, junk is junk. I always end up braking my 10mm, 12mm sockets so I end up spending a little more on replacing those. Ive had bad luck with the Allen head sets I've gotten from HF, so I'm defiantly looking at those plus drivers posted earlier.

The HF  power tools will last for a few jobs or two before dying. Then other just keeping going and going mike the cordless drill, and angle grinder I got from them. The grinding and polishing wheel I got there are pretty rock solid.

Definitely not a HF router.  I use a Bosh 2.3 HP plunge/fixed combo router. I bought it 12 years ago for around $300 but it's definitely been a good one.  

My brother in law has bought 4 DeWalt routes for $100 each I've a 5 year period.

Just want to second what was said there don't have a lot of hands on experience with either of them I just have a cheapo Ryobi router mini table thing (it has actually worked well for the light duty stuff I use it for).  I looked into a lot of spindle types though for doing a DIY CNC machine (still a back burnered project) people generally swear by the bosch routers as being a viable option for a decent home CNC.  The stuff I'm trying to do with the CNC is super light duty though (PCB milling and drilling) so I've been using a dremel knock off for the sake of some basic development and testing, basically all comes down to what kind of performance and precision you want out of the tool and how long you expect to use it (apparently Bosch uses good bearings and the shaft is extremely well aligned so there isn't much wobble and can deal with a fair amount of sideways force without going out of alignment).  I've heard of some people using the Dewalts for CNC stuff too but it's more for light duty (soft wood or aluminum at hardest) and not as rigid in the first place.

Id want to use a router for modifying boards. To either make a cavity for electronics or changing board shape. I used a dremel with router attachment and bits wouldn't stay in place. Dont know how much ill use it but would still want a decent one

Tool cost add up quick so havent bought some of the stuff I want like router, vacuum pump , spot welder.

Today's tool originated in 1949, and is named a surform. The surform is a  cross between a wood rasp and a plane. Good for shaping curves so its great for shaping  deck, and has been used in the shaping of surfboards. It works kinda slow but it's easy to control.

Has anyone mentioned cardboard? I use cardboard all the time to make parts and test fitment. No matter what you are building, cardboard will help you to see how things actually fit after you sketch out the layout. If there are any issues or oversights, you will find out when you make your carboard templates. You can glue a printed template to the board and get even more accurate with your dims. Because the cardboard is soft, you can bolt them in and "wiggle" test where the bolt stresses are most prevalent and re-engineer your pieces, if necessary, before you start cutting material. It's really simple, but really effective.

OMG tool thread how did I not notice 

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s2D7jBAXibI/UrtgcFtNB0I/AAAAAAAAMC4/Eb85VctQrR8/s1600/IMG_6482.JPG

I use this for soldering connectors, and for holding the soldering iron to tin wires. Panavise I think makes the original, there's a decent copy at harborfreight

EDIT above is not what I mean. The one I like has suction cup attachment, but is heavy enough by itself.

Soft jawed vices are nice. I've been thinking of making some soft jaw inserts for one if my vices. Good when your doing finishing work, or working with soft stuff.

the soft cover is removable, it's metal underneath, good for holding bullets and such.

This type is really good for thin wire. I use a razor blade for 12awg silicone and up.

I got this in a package deal with a soldering station -- really good! Stout small blade. I use it for pulling pins out of JST housings and things like that

Does anyone actually like skate tools? They seem so useless, only good for emergencies on the road... I think this is the best skate tool. Unfortunately I don't think they have US distribution any more

https://www.routeone.co.uk/skateboards/tools/lucky-supertool.htm

2nd best:

https://www.amazon.com/Alpina-Alpha-Micro-Skate-Tool/dp/B001E0WOPY/

And I actually prefer this to the usual:

This actually isn't trash!

Seems eskate builders are either teenagers or old dudes. If you're like me, the connectors seem soooo small... Reading glasses...

https://www.costco.com/Design-Optics-By-Foster-Grant-Flexible-Plastic-Reading-Glasses-3-pack.product.100329394.html

1.50x gives good working distance. This beats those magnifying glasses, magnifying headsets, loupes, stereo microscopes, USB video microscopes...

This torch is not garbage. It's actually hard to find ones that are not trash.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IPS0LI0/

Went through a BUNCH of crimper reviews and bought a few, this one seems to work best for our JST connectors

https://www.amazon.com/Engineer-PA-09-Micro-Connector-Crimpers/dp/B002AVVO7K/

This tool is great for transferring center of holes to wood or plastic

https://www.amazon.com/Stanley-58-013-Self-Centering-Screw-Punch/dp/B00002X1YB/

Low tech works great for weird shapes or small trims

Anyone have a good recommendation for a soldering iron stand? I got a pretty good digital controlled  RadioShack soldering iron but the stand sucks, and I keep melting holes in it.

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Metcal-WS1-Auto-Sleeper-Work-stand-for-the-MX-500-soldering-system-/322735036750

But probably any cheap stand in that style, with a hole for brass sponge, should be great.

It's kinda like blue loctite, but you can adjust/move and it'll still hold. The brush in the cap is nice.

For the real machinist out there with very deep pockets. I'm lucky to have a manual mill and a lathe in the backyard. Not the ones are shown in the examples below.

One of my favourite tools is a rubber band. When you stuff up the head on the screw or strip the Allen key hole in a grub screw most of the time you can grab a rubber band, stick it on the end of the screw driver and it will grip the thing and get it out.(as long as there is no locktite)

I use these 2 constantly, wood plastic metal.

http://auctionsound.s3.amazonaws.com/clients%2Fezsellusa%2Fphoto_sets%2F66884%2F100_4934.JPG

The 2" belt is the key, almost any used thing will work. Those with deep pockets and 220v will like the 2x72" ones.

I think a HF portaband and a homemade table would work fine.
