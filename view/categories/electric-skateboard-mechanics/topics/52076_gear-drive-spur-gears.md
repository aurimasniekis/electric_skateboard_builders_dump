So basically I need some spur gears for my direct/gear drive, but they seems very hard to source, especially the ones I need. The ones I`m looking for should be 13-15T, Module 2 and about 12mm thick..

I have got some quotes on custom made ones, but these are freakin expensive- like $150 each.
So do anyone know of a place where I can get them?

Direct drive does not use gears -- it's the defining feature of direct drive.  I think you are referring to gear drive...

@Maxid They do, but their selection isnt really the biggest, unfortnantly

I couldn't find a bigger selection anywhere else. It's frustrating but you probably need to make this work with what maedler has.

What selection do you need? You said 13-15t - that's only three possible teeth counts.

There is no such thing.  "Direct drive" means without gears/transmission.  Look it up.  You are talking about gear drive.  Direct drive is like Carvon motors.

Yes, of course I know what I'm talking about, I am the designer. But people around here use direct drive, even if it isn't a "Direct drive". I`m 100% sure about the differences, but not everyone here does.

Did you use the stainless gears for your drive? Seems like thats the one that will fit my needs the best. Even though I don't understand out how you order these :joy:

I did that because **others** don't know the difference, and I would like to have as many as possible understanding what I was asking for.

Continuing to call it the wrong thing won't help the misunderstanding.  It's pretty clear if you use the word "gear" or "cog" what is being referred to

I used the regular steel gears. Maedler is expensive if you go for small quantities :smile:

I also had to switch to incognito mode to even have a shopping cart, so there's that :rofl:

You bring this up every time someone says the words direct drive. I know it's *technically* wrong, but since Jenso coined this term most people, especially E-ATB builders, know what's going on. I think you won't be able to convince everyone everyone to switch an already established phrase. Maybe you could see it as a brand name or something, but debating back and forth about it in some odd threads won't really change much.

Let's not perpetuate the incorrect terms because some company marketed it that way, let's keep calling it what it actually is and let their marketing suffer for it...NO, we do not all know it by the incorrect term and that's a poor excuse anyway you look at it..

Boy how I'd like to flag the shit out of the posts in this thread. Must be close to the shittiest off-topic/relevant ratio ever. 

He asked for gears - let's keep it that way. Open a new thread if you want to debate terms. @moderators might want to branch this into its own thread.

If it has a transmission, it's not direct drive.

That's no excuse. Pampering people who refuse for learn is why the US is full of special snowflakes who don't know what losing means.

How hard is it to understand?!? the words DIRECT drive is literally DIRECTLY DRIVING WHEEL

back on topic. Maybe you can ask @MoeStooge to make you something

Another problem is that Maedler doesn't state the roof fillet and backlash in their gears. How did you deal with this when designing your 3d printed gear?

I kind of didn't think about it and was glad that it worked out with the standard settings of the gear stl generator i used. In hindsight i would do it different but in the end it worked out with my gears.

Currently i'm having problems with the motor mounts, some teeth are skipping when breaking hard and i suspect alignment issues but i'm not really sure what's wrong as it's only on one side.

That could simply be wearing of the teeth and the mesh needs to be adjusted...That's freaky to think about though, you are skipping gears on such a system it says something about the forces involved..

Been involved in oval track racing since 1984, was an auto technician 18yrs. I don't know about the skate terms but direct drive as far as my wheelhouse and all the people in that time has always been anything with a 1:1 ratio.

Why mod2.  Steel square cut gears will take 5200w all day all week at mod.8, it may open some options for you.

I do completely agree with all of you that the term "direct drive" is wrong to use when talking about a gear drive like this, but mainly did it because it would create more interest, as it seems like more people refer to a drive like jenso`s when hearing the words "Direct drive". Which is basically what I am creating.

And it clearly created more interest in the thread aswell..:yum:

No reason really, only that I will be experimenting with printed gears, and mod2 seems like what everybody uses

I know you have experience with this. Basically I want to make my own cheap geared drive. do you think these components can fit regular skate parts?

Since they have 5 mounting screws, they'd work with the kegel core wheels.
I'm wondering if it's worth a shot or should I expect the red thing to not fit a bearing inside it and just ditch the red part?

You don't want regular plastic for this anyway (POM or nylon would be ok). The width of the gears would also determine how much force it can take/how quickly it wears down.

Try searching on Aliexpress for gears. Ones used in powertools. They are spur or helical cut. If you look for marble machine gears you could get ratios that is beetween 1:2 to 1:3  
Circular saw gives bigger ratios. 
Interestingly you get better hits off "powertool gears" than if you look for "helical gears".
