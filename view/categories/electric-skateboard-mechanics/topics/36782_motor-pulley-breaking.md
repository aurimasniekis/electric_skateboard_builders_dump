Hi guys. Did this happen to any of you? It broke on me 3 time the exact same way , even when I used a different kind pulley. Does someone have an idea why it keeps happening?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/6/f602e5abed5c4f7be37ce9cc4d37a40d61721112.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Happened to me once. Probably your motor/pulley alignment is not centered/straight. The belt is pushing on the flange that broke

Most likely your belt isn't aligned with your wheel pulley properly. Seems like your motor mount needs to be closer to the wheels.

The belt does get rubbed on this flange but It keeps happening no matter how I align the belt

If you post photos of your setup it may reveal something.

I was coming into this thread to try to figure out how you were using your pulleys to generate braking force.  Then I realized it was a typo and you meant "motor pulley breaking" LoLz

Well I believe something is misaligned with your drivetrain. If it's not. check that the belt´s tooth´s are okay

It keeps happening no matter how I align the belt, but when I go in reverse, the belt is aligned properly and is not touching this flange.

Switch two of your 3 motor wires and turn the board around for front wheel drive.  Fixed!

there´s a difference with aligning belt and aligning motor shaft/pulley and wheel pulley.
Could you post a pic without the belt. Just the mount motorshaft and wheel

Very hard to see from the pic. but could your motor mount be bent?

Is that plastic?
Buy some quality metal ones

Looks like 9mm wheel and 12-15mm motor pulley?
At least 12mm on wheel with 12mm belt should help or if it's 12 already, 15 to match the motor

A pic like this will also help to tell if the angles are good

It’s 12 on the wheel and 15 on the motor

12mm belt?
If the angle of the motor mount is less than 90° to the wheel pulley it'll cause the belt to skew towards the mount, pushing on the flange
```

I haven’t noticed if it’s not perfectly 90 degrees. If it’s not, how could I correct it?

Measure the angle, align to 90 if it's not...

The aligment should be the problem but not sure since i use chains

Check that your wheel pulley is inserted in to the wheel all the way and straight,it could be deviating the belt to one side.

Do you know where can I buy sprockets that are big enough for a 107mm wheel?

Your mount looks like it's not squared up.  

Like warman said, make sure your wheel pulley is on straight, and then work on getting the clamp straightened up.

As everyone else mentioned, your alignment isn't straight

BUT I always line that pressed on ring with some CA before installing the pulley, haven't had them pop off since(but they popped Initially because alignment

When I first got into the sport I had these same issues. The torque needed to drive the board pulls the mount out of alignment and pops the flange. Our answer was to design a better type of motor mount that is paired with a truck hanger that has been milled to match our mounts. Perfect alingment right out of the box and they don't flex when you get on the throttle!

This is the build thread of our latest version of this type of mount.

I already have all the parts and I’m not planning to buy another mount... thanks for the reply anyway, and if you have some other tips to fix this I would really appreciate it

Use hard metal shims and do the best you can to produce a good fit with what you have and try not to run your belts too tight.
