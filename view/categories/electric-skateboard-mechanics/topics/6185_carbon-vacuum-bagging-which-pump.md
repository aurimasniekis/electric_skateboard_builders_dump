Hey guys,

anyone else out there besides @whitepony how has experience with vacuum bagging. I'm looking for a pump which is not too expensive. I found this one:

http://shop.wiltec.info/product_info.php/info/p3950_Airbrush-Kompressor-AS20W-mit-Vakuumpumpe.html

which is just 80 bucks, might not be good to let it run for 24h though but all other oil free running pumps I found are $$$.

I as well found this guy, who is sealing off his vacuum bag and doesn't have the pump running for 24h (ok, he is doing infusion but that shouldn't make a difference)

Anyone who hasn't the pump running for ages?

I have heard great things about the used ebay thomas vacuum pumps. its basically 2nd hand refurbished hospital gear that has to be replaced due to regulations from what I read a while ago. check ebay for "thomas vacuum pump" :slight_smile:

you can also see how many of them are actually sold on ebay. cant be a bad choice really!

My 4year old pump failed on me so recently got a oilless pump. I am very happy with it. 
It's called, Gast vacuum pump.
