Hey guys, I've got a Jet Spud from @JLabs and I was planning on routing out some of the deck to set in the enclosure as well as potentially get some more room in the enclosure height wise, pretty much like what @whitepony did with his Jet Sput . How many mm do you think I could route out of the deck without compromising it to the point that it might break?

i removed about 3-5mm i think and the spud, because its so short, is a fairly thin deck - its just an elegance thing, doesnt really add functionality in the end - so think about if you really need it. i always had a slightly bad feeling and avoided jumping with weight in the middle of the board.
