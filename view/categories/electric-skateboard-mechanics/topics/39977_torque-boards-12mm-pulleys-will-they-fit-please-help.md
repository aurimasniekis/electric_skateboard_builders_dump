Hello I'm making and dual 6355 e-board. I have very little space between the motor mounts and the wheels. I have 83mm abec 11 wheels. Could anyone tell me how much room I need minimum?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/4/946434bf1f9b559fb2b04e2322ad636d04fab526.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I'm not sure exactly but here is a picture of mine, for reference. It looks like you have plenty of room

You should be fine with 10" caliber trucks.

As long as you have 10" trucks, you should have no problem using 12mm belt pulley.
