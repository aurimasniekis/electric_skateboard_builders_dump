I'm a big fan of Ronins queen pin design for stability and quick handling. Is there anything else out there with equal or better stability and handling characteristics?

No one complains about surf rodz precision and handling. 

Do any you guys ride both and can give a comparison? 

The only issue with Ronin for e-skate is they don't come in wide enough to do dual symmetric setups with large motors.

Only complaint I'm yet to hear about surfrodz is pricing. That being said I just bought RKP trucks and I'm already trying to order a set of TKP trucks for another board.

I'm sure Surf Rodz have extremely precise handling. I just don't see how they can possibly be as stable without the queen pin tech. If I stick with my Cronins I would do a yin yang motor mount setup with dual rear 6374.

Have you guys heard of Kahalani trucks? Reasonably priced 204mm hanger precision trucks, they used to be quite popular. Also a perfect shape for motor mounts.

....but nothing compares to which are perhaps the bests trucks on planet Earth: **G.O.G. Trucks** (Gang of Germany), a German manufacturer maker of precision slalom and downhill skateboard trucks. In particular, models **BB2** (Big Brother Two) and **BB3** (Big Brother Three).

**Hanger Width**: 
200mm / 180mm (thus reference **200/0/3.5** which means 200mm long hanger, 0mm offset, 3.5 rake)

**Axles**: 
8mm or 10mm removable axles (glued in)

**Bushings**: 
most standard barrel shaped bushings fit - Eliminators, Stimulators and Jim-Z shape fit
 
**Hanger type**:
- axle in-line with kingpin for maximum traction and controlled drifting, flippable
- anti torsional light weight construction
- 3.5mm rake

**Flippable hanger**:
Youâ€™ll get 2 trucks in 1!

**Truck height**:
43mm (unflipped)

**Baseplate**:
- Adjustable from 30Â°-60Â°, no steps
- choose from 3 different wheelbases - cause the truck youâ€™ve had before might have a different offset.

**Price**: 
â‚¬ 460,00 Euros

It's not just being precision... & i'm not going to spell it out here... what angle, what rake, what width... front back... & all that goes beyond the Ronin support pin which eliminates lateral play at the king pin
Ronin are developing so fast they don't even make those trucks any more! :boom:

No doubt, I don't think anyone was saying that angle, rake and width don't matter. As you can see, I posted three generations of Ronin Precisions. That said, the Katanas are definitely designed for downhill wheels 70-78mm with extra wide contact patch. For an esk8 setup I think most would prefer the old 184mm hanger Ronin precisions. I definitely agree that they are a step ahead of the competition.

I think the venom/rogue cast trucks should be more popular...

Square profile, 186mm wide, insert bushing is less to maintain than ronin & dampens vibration better but still helps to control lateral movement at the kingpin and gives you a more open bushing seat.

Nice, I had not seen the Rogue's before. I like the design a lot.

The picture I grabbed of the Katanas came directly from Ronins website, so I guess their website needs updating. http://www.ronintrucks.com/shop-2/complete-sets/#!/Ronin-Katanas/p/21764907/category=1667187

Wow spherical bearings?! Thats so 2007.. might as well be bear smokeys or Jimz trucks.

Aeras and ronins are king right now. The scene steered away from wide dead "stable" trucks a long time ago.

At least Aera still makes a 184mm hanger. Those narrow hangers on the Katana are not ideal for esk8.

Dude. Thank you for reminding me the name of this truck!!!! Brings back so many memories... Here's a quote from their website:

> This truck has helped our riders win the world cup title twice. 2007 with Erik Lundberg 

I was racing against Erik Lundberg in the semi-finals, Chris Theiler and myself lost to this Swede who was riding Kahalanis back at Demons of Downhill 2007. We lost it for America!!!!! and they gained the right to quote that win. Those swedes rolled up in their fancy rental, *looong* blonde hair swooshing in the wind... First time I'd seen a bundle of swedes... Beautiful sight to behold.

Anyways, those have always been some sick trucks. Super low riding too. Thanks for helping me remember ðŸ˜Ž


Anyway, to answer OP... How about some magun trucks? I know someone who might have a set still... We tried to replicate something similar with Confederate trucks back in the day. Those would make some good eskate trucks if you can find a set... Probably more rare than maguns, I think maybe 10 were made at most.

I actually dremeled a set of cast ronins (you can still find them lightly used in 180mm) to fit caliber mounts. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BidAbE3gSXc/?hl=en&taken-by=longhairedboy

These work great! Sleeved washers, brand new bushings and support pins/cups. 

Absolutely incredible to be flying around on good trucks, good thane (abec 11) and 12s FOC. 

If you dont have to fit wheel pulley bearings (instead using bolt on pulleys) then your choice of truck is anything really! 

Im SUPER SURPRISED i havent seen anyone use real precision trucks (aera, ronin, any fancy stuff) in their builds yet... we spend ridiculous money on our boards only to use cast trucks that bend like bananas with 100mm wheels...... SRSLY?

Silverfish. So sad it's gone. I'd check up every couple years to read back. All my posts about Confederate trucks.. renderings, etc were on there and I never backed it up. Only pic I could find of them is this... all that remains: ![20180821_161346|151x129](upload://4diLjfxkDulcWup8gMwIZY6UmRn.jpg)

Imo, they were something special. Wide, dual kingpin (if you shaved some bushings), but they had a bushing seats in in line with the axle for extreme grip, positive rake, little space between bushing seats for nimble turning... And a second zero rake bushing seat in the standard RKP spot with extra space between bushings to improve stability by decreasing leverage on the bushings/increasing travel on bushings while turning. 

Looking back after the prototypes, this is opposite of what we intended... I'd have gone positive rake, narrow space for the traditional bushing seats... And more space between bushing seats for the seats in line with the kingpin.

I have an old set of 180mm cronins on my downhill board that are still straight. I'm debating using them for my first build. However, I would rather not dremel them, so I've been eyeing @marcmt88 ronin motor mounts. The downside of these mounts is the clearance with smaller wheels, but I plan on running 97mm so it shouldn't be an issue.

I agree, I think a nice set of precisions with e-toxx cnc mounts would be badass.

"If you dont have to fit wheel pulley bearings (instead using bolt on pulleys) then your choice of truck is anything really!"

I don't really understand this, I'm a bit of a noob. Is there a thread explaining this?

I use longhairedboy enertion style pulleys. They have a bearing in them to help them spin true and offload some torsional forces. They require extra space on the axel so im forced to use trucks that are cast so i can chop some hanger aluminum off to expose more axle (or use TB 218mm trucks).

Precision trucks dont have this option.. i mean unless you get the ronin prolite spaceable axels.

What i meant by having any choice is that you can basically file the truck hanger to fit a motor mount clamp or have marcmt88 make you a motor mount he does like any truck if youre willing to send them to him.

The new cncd gear drive systems just havent been created for anything but trampa based mountainboards.

I feel the real downhill longboarding market in esk8 is limited to cast trucks really. Not enough people are skilled to ride street fast enough to make much of a difference. (30mph+)

The perfect monsterous esk8 street setup is still nonexistent. For now...

I was scrolling through the picture thread and noticed that @Idea has e-toxx gear drive on his rkp trucks. I also saw that @whitepony had some custom e-toxx belt drive motor mounts for his cronins.

![maxresdefault|690x388](upload://zxOcJAktS3MTjNbhRp43or6tg2p.jpg)

So the bearing pulleys are preferred, that's good to know. Unfortunately it means that I'm going to have to cut up my trucks. 
Does @wolffoxx setup use bolt on or bearing pulleys? I can't tell.

How about the Trampa motor mounts? These are bolt on correct?

I loved my Cronins amazing stability at high speeds and crazy turning radio, however they have a couple of characteristics I don't like, the hanger is too short to hold dual 15mm belt/pullies and 6355 motors, you can only use two threads to hold the wheel in place, the second issue is after a short time the queen pin will start to rattle and will need constant maintenance.
