So I have been thinking about whether I get a specialised motor for Eboards, for example the Enetion 190KV electric skateboard motor 3655 or I just buy a stock high powered motor from the hobby store. 

I read that The alternatives from the hobby shop are not designed with quality bearings suitable for carrying human size loads, they will often use leads that are inflexible & have tiny 4mm connectors that just can't handle the high amps that can often be pulled into the motor when climbing steep hills. The Enertion R-SPEC motor has large open ports to maximise air-flow and minimize weight. The R-SPEC motors offer minimal drag when unpowered allowing the smoothest free ride out of any motor on the market.
I was wondering if this is true and if having a specialised motor will be an advantage, personally I would like one of the best hobby motors without spending too much. Any help?

The advantages that the eboard made motors have are: Flexible wires so that they don't break or snap (not that copper wires usually do anyway), maybe better bearings and other internal stuff. Other than that I don't think they are heaps better but if you want those above inclusions then get an eboard motor

the enertion motor compared to hobby motors also has a keyway slot for perfect and simple pulley mounting, a water resistant coating on the stator. I would go with an board motor for durability and simplicity.
