What do you think about this motor mount?

I'm using a 190kv motor and a VESC. Is this ok?

Do not buy that motormount, it will shatter in a few weeks.

this one is allright, I have this one on my truck with a bigger (selfmade) round steel to hold the motor mount in place (a must have modification)

this motor mount is also made for paris trucks and it looks amazing (and is dirt cheap)

some people are also quite content with the hobbyking mount, for non round trucks.
