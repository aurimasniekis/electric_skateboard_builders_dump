Does anyone recognize the brand this of skateboard?

![IMG_20180314_133812|666x500](upload://w2RqNYKjCGhOtr7dUjF9rzHJ1Wt.jpg)

A friend of mine bought it a year ago second hand and never had time to do anything with it, so he gave it to me. He doesn't know if it's custom-made, there's no branding anywhere, and no amount of googling has turned up anything similar. I know both trampa and MBS make handbrakes for boards and such, but nothing like this. All I know for certain is that it's huge!

Damn that looks like a crazy experiment, can't even imagine riding this high above the ground. 

Maybe do a photo of an independent wheel and google image search those? The wheels seem to be easily distinguishable, maybe they lead to something.

That's what I thought, but no luck so far. Those tires definitely look like they were meant for riding on sand but I haven't found anything else like them.
They're about 8" in diameter, and I'm pretty sure they fit 12mm axles, so it seems like they were made for skateboards of some kind.

Man, I didn't even think of that! ðŸ˜†
I don't think I'll actually try to ride it in its current condition though. Worn out bushings, rusty screws, the brake line is frayed, no griptape, and it steers like a drunk elephant.
I'm debating whether to try restoring it, getting a deck with a serious drop, or just using the wheels. I'm leaning towards one of the latter two.
Getting a belt gear for it will be tricky, the hub is smaller than a trampa and it's a little "recessed" inside the tire and held with only four screws.

I had some time to begin disassembly today. Turns out the deck is indeed a snowboard in disguise.
![IMG_20180319_102152|666x500](upload://xe5Q6uLV6SsXU1Uzyok6OSAlzPz.jpg)

It turns out that the screws are all imperial, which made taking it apart a challenge. So much rust!

...and that's one set of wheels!
![IMG_20180319_155710|666x500](upload://eTDkgqp0Fk9aM4I02elSZPn9Oou.jpg)
I've started working on a 72t wheel pulley which will have a built-in "spacer" for the sunken hubs, although if anyone has a Solidworks file of that that they'd be willing to share with me it would save a lot of time.
The long bolts that serve as axles are M12x100 approximately. Does anyone know the axle length of the MBS matrix II trucks?

Thanks man, I'll keep at it! 
Hopefully the cleaning will be the only really hard part, after that I'll see what I can salvage. This was definitely used as a beach board at some point, given the dirt I'm finding inside. I'm already starting to suspect that the internal part of the hub will have to go. There's simply too much rust and corrosion.
Once I have it cleaned I'll see if I can design and 3d print a part to hold the ends of the hubs together.

Okay, a bit of an update:
Two wheels and their hubs are in decent condition and I can probably keep them as is.
The other two hubs might be a lost cause, what with the pitting and rust they have on them, but I'll give it a shot anyway.![IMG_20180321_214644|666x500](upload://tqXFGI72kJ0PmAp30jKXLm1XR8H.jpg)![IMG_20180321_190233|666x500](upload://2D6fmnk2maK2hZMt5EpZbZVQmfr.jpg)
 
As you can see, after I clean then off somewhat and dunk them in vinegar for at least a week they'll need a lot of filling in. Does anyone know an easy way to do this? I've heard of things like Bondo but I'm in New territory here. Any pointers would be great!

Whoa! Your shits tubeless!

You need to really think about your plan and technique then. 

Possibly what up is first getting them cleaner. 

Goggles
Wire wheel on a dremel
Sandpaper



Oh wait.. first up is the good wheels/tires need to be aired up and checked for functionality. 

Then proceed with the clapped out ones.

Can you find replacement tires? 

You're going to need a  proper air compressor to seat the tires. A tire shop will help you out.


The "good" wheels need more scrubbing. Just worry about getting the tire mating surface smooth.

You might need to sand any rough spots off the bead of the tire also so it gets a good seal.

You need A schraeder tool, and some new schrader valves.

You can dump air with a regular fitting for air..

 this one here:
![IMG_5054|375x500](upload://mV1t4TcNyD02SDusCXnahTIupuf.JPG)

Fwiw, this works for car/motorcycle tubeless wheels also, you just need a thicker hose, like 3/8" to flow enough air.

Take the schraeder valve out,  and just push the female air fitting onto the valve stem to fill it up. 

When it's inflated, pull it off and quickly put the valve core in with your tool.
```

I haven't checked the good wheels yet, I'll get to it soon. 
I don't know if the tires where always tubeless, but I've yet to find anything that matches them. I have tried standing on one (deflated) wheel and it held it's shape without collapsing under me, so I'm guessing four of them together should manage okay.
I've already started cleaning with a dremel using a wire brush attachment, followed by a grinding wheel for the tougher bits. one of them is now sitting in vinegar and the second will go in soon.
I do have a schraeder tool and getting new valves shouldn't be a problem.
HOWEVER...
I have not been able to find anything like these tires and hubs anywhere yet, let alone inner-tubes. I'm not even sure some of this wasn't custom-made, but I have no way of knowing. 
This means that even if I do manage to repair all of this, once the tires wear out, that's it. 
No spares, no replacements.
Thus, I'm a little hesitant to invest too much time and resources in this, and keep in mind I'm already considering adapting spring-trucks for longer axles to accommodate the wider hubs. Taking it to a tire shop etc... well, we'll see. I'll give it my best shot, but this could very well become a long term side project at best, or an expensive dud at worst.
Obviously, if anyone ever happens to find tires similar to these, I'd be very grateful to hear about them.

Oh man, I talked to the guy who made those.

I've got a pic.

![IMG_0040|666x500](upload://6J4JL5lazWAVcGw06hL1dWk3Y8i.JPG)

From 2013.

I doubt he made more than a couple. 
I stupidly didn't get the conversation on video, but I seem to recall he just made it for fun.

I wouldn't be surprised if its the same one I saw.


Its a really cool design, but the pivot angle looks super low. I'm guessing the thing hardly turned?

I think he was the salesman for the company who's boxes are in the background. If we can make out the logo and figure out what the company is we might be able to track the guy down.

That's incredible! Good catch there!
Yes, the steering wasn't anything great, partly just because the deck was so long.

I just read the thread and i bet at the first post, that this thing is custom made (still donÂ´t know where you wanna ride that thing - maybe itÂ´s a hybrit-water-board with those big wheels :smiley:).

Try to get a shorter deck and maybe adjust the springs a bit for steering. Should be fun to ride around on these big airbubbles :grin:

I think what it needs is an actual mountainboard deck with wedged tips, because that built in pivot angle is so low.

The springs on that thing don't do any steering, those are only for suspension.
Steering is handled with bushings.

youÂ´re right, just checked the picture again and saw that theyÂ´re on the same baseplate.
I thought they handle steering independently like the BMW board ![maxresdefault|666x500](upload://gRGTiXn2HlWjviyl8TqJt32KvQ4.jpg)

You're partly correct, the springs are only for shock absorbtion, bushings handle the actual steering. Thus, you don't need a special mountainboard deck. Bty, the springs are bigger and stiffer than trampa ones.
It's not a standard size baseplate though, it's too long for standard deck holes. I'll have to check how to adapt it, but it'll still be very high off the ground. That's why I'm looking more at just using the wheels.

Yeah you wouldn't need a special mountain board deck, but I think it would be a big improvement.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but looking at it seems as though it would have a HUGE turning radius. 
A mountain board deck would shrink that radius right down and make it nimble as anything else.

Update and decision time!
So I heard back from the guy and we passed a few emails back and forth. Here's his concluding response:
![Screenshot_20180412-190031|281x500](upload://7aKVzagUihNth2bPDtnKoxFHD7K.jpg)

And there you have it- they used a board no longer produced as a sort of test platform for their rail system. Bty, having checked out their site that rail mounting system looks like an interesting idea, but he hasn't responded as to whether they ever went ahead and made a boot/rail attachment. He also hasn't told me the name of the company that made the board.
I have still not found anything else like it.
Meanwhile, here's the difference between a rusty hub that's just been submerged in vinegar vs. one that's been in it for a week:
![IMG_20180412_185240|375x499](upload://aeyPypD6ksFrqB6Nvj9qhDPxbkH.jpg)![IMG_20180412_185252|375x500](upload://cad9OLyGvEA3mHMmHSTpQLeRa4R.jpg)
I do not intend to try restoring the entire board, both because I know I will never use it as it was, and because I doubt how much it's worth as a "piece of history" considering there's absolutely no record of it. 
The more I think about it the more looks like the case with the mini-disc - an interesting concept, but ultimately just a stopgap technology the lasted a couple of years between discs and mp3 players... and now we don't even really need those.
I do still want to use the wheels though, so ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my fellow eskaters... Are these hubs worth saving? Or should I try milling new ones?

```

---
## \#37 Posted by: High-roller Posted at: 2018-04-14T19:46:46.239Z Reads: 149

```
I might still restore the trucks, just not the board as a whole.
It's too high and too long for me to enjoy riding that way, so I'll probably look for a deck with a serious drop in it. Then I'll have to find a way to mount it with its nonstandard holes, design a special motor mount for it, the list goes on.
In a way that's all relatively easy, since the trucks aren't nearly as rusty as the wheels, which are much harder to replace.
In a way, this is three projects in one:
1. Restore the hubs and tires to usable condition.
    Since I can't find more tires like these anywhere I don't   think it's worth investing in machining new hubs from scratch, so if I can save these with JB weld I will.
2. Extend axles in order to use these hubs on mountainboard trucks. See my related thread for more details.
3. Restore trucks and and adapt to standard deck.
     This is probably going to be a long-running side project. I have a few ideas for how to go about it and thankfully they can take trampa or MBS hubs without any trouble. I will also consider your suggestion to use a proper mountainboard deck. I do like the idea of making a proper off-road board with these...

In short, it all comes down to time and budget constraints. I'm looking to upgrade my existing board too, so there's a limit to how much I can do and how quickly. 
I'm not giving up on this project by any means, it's just going to take time. Once I have a proper plan for how to go about this, I'll start a build log and post as often as I can. I already have an idea for a theme and a name...ðŸ˜‰

I FOUND IT!!!
It's called the Turf DeVille Mountain Board.
Lemme back up. I was looking around for ideas for my next build and I happened to find this defunct but interesting looking site- http://www.reviewmountainboards.com/.
I get curious and start scrolling through the models and suddenly there it is!
http://www.reviewmountainboards.com/mountain-board-reviews/turf-deville-mountain-board-reviews/
A little more digging shows that it wasn't very well liked, but you can still find some parts for it online. I found exactly one (failed) attempt to motorize it:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Electric-TurfBoard/
So to sum up- everyone who was thinking snowboards was right, @Idle was spot on about the tubeless tires, and there seem to be some good reasons why this concept did not last very long.
As for what happens now, I'm thinking of adapting the truck into a swing-arm type truck...

That's what I'm thinking too. I'm probably not going to buy them though. I've already ordered JB weld to fix the ones I have, and it looks like he has just one board's worth of parts. It's simply putting off the day that they wear out and there's no more replacements. Better to work on an improved design that can use these tires as well as modern mountainboard tires.

Hey guys since there's still some ongoing low key interest in this project- thanks very much bty!- I thought I should give an update on what exactly I'm planning to do here.
First of all, I will NOT be doing a full restoration. The original concept, basically a snowboard with wheels, simply doesn't interest me. Call me a traditionalist, I prefer my snowboarding without wheels.
Second, here's their most recent video (says 2010, but looks earlier):
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DS1n6ljJ6z9c&ved=2ahUKEwjku5K3zeXcAhXHIMAKHQJHANsQwqsBMAF6BAgIEAU&usg=AOvVaw3iY8KaO9Mo_ovqaw5_NnSh
Standing on something the height of two stairs with a narrow wheelbase, wobbly bushings, and stiffer than trampa springs is not something advisable in my opinion.
The "historical value" (if any) also isn't enough on its own to convince me. If I'm building something, it's with the intention of using it, this is true of anything I build, not just esk8.
With that in mind, here is what I am planning to do:
Swing-arm truck designs are slowly starting to reappear, and I'm planning on building one using the turfboard tires and BMW streetcarver trucks.

I'm working on overhauling and upgrading my existing board first, so it might be a while before I can really get into this project. I do have a 29" jetspud deck waiting for this, and the plan is to have dual diagonal 63** motors. 
Currently all the eBay links are sold out, but I'll keep my eyes open them. The tires were custom made for the board, so those at least are worth buying. I will be able to switch to regular trampa or MBS wheels and tires when they wear out though.
If I can get around to it in the coming weeks I'll start at least mounting the trucks and wheels to the deck, at which point I'll also start a build log.
Thank you all very much for the links you've sent and the interest you've shown. I will do my best to make it worth your patience (eventually)!
