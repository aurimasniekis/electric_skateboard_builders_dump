First sorry about my English...
I want to make  also a electric skateboard for my 12 year old son.
I have buy already [the skateboard](http://www.outdoorstunter.nl/longboard-drop-through-40-usa-print-102cm.html), the motor [(Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-245kv)](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=39965), the esc ([Hobbywing Ezrun MAX8 150A, with programmer](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/HOBBYWING-EZRUN-MAX8-RC-Model-Brushless-Motor-waterproof-150A-ESC-Speed-Controller-T-plug-program-card/32341947436.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.69.R1IuCl)), the 2 [battery's (in series)](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idproduct=35833), and [the controller.](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard/32573238408.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.89.3uGVAF)
The wheels are to small, and I want to replace the wheel's for [this wheel's](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZ2US5Y/ref=twister_B01AZ2US54?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1).
What I need now is a motor bracket (I making this from aluminium) and **1 pulley for the wheels** and a **pulley for the motor** and a **drive belt**.
What belt and what pulleys a need it for this 97 mm wheel's to have a driving speed from about max 30km/hrs?
And the big question is **_where I can ordered?_**
I life in the **Netherlands**, and I don't want to pay to match for shipping cost and taxes.
I order many items by AliExpress, and pay ( almost) never tax.
Please keep the answers simple, because my bad English reading (and google translations)üòÅ

I'm from The Netherlands aswell.
Dont go with that ESC, its Chinese and the price is pretty high if you compare it to a VESC.
For a good ESC i would take the [ESC 6S](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/single-motor-120a-6s-esc/) , It's easy to adjust and pretty reliable. 

Check [ESK8](http://esk8.de/) for pulleys etc, they're located in Germany and shipping would be less than ‚Ç¨20,- .
Almost any gearing would be fine to reach 30kmph, use this calculator : [Link](http://toddy616.blogspot.nl/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html)

Nobody have experience purchase the pulley for the wheels and a pulley for the motor and a drive belt by AliExpress? 
if i buy by enertionboards, i pay for the pulley for the wheels, a pulley for the motor, and a drive belt, ‚Ç¨20 for the shipping cost, and totally ‚Ç¨57 for the 3 things!
its a lot of money.

[/quote]

Ask the seller before you purchase them....

83mm in my thread is one of the most popular sizes....

And abt your mount .... Getting a pre made mount that fits a specific truck will save you the hassle of trying to figure out measurements ... 

@Torqueboards is DIY Skateboard everything u need
@onloop enertion everything u need
@psychotiller has mounts as well ... No pulleys
@oriol360 is Miami Electric boards ... They have pulleys   
 ....

Check them out

@Michaelinvegas 
Thanks for the links but i life in the Netherlands, and many things on Ebay out the USA are the shipping cost to the Netherlands higher than the item.
I buy already many things, I need only now **1 pulley for the wheels and a pulley for the motor and a drive belt**, **not more** (i can make the motor mount by me self).

I think that i order the [36 teeth pulley from enertionboards.com](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/12mm-wide-pulley-drive-hub-kit/), fits this pulley in the [97mm longboard Flywheels](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZ2US5Y/ref=twister_B01AZ2US54?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)?

scroll back up and check out the "Electric skateboard calculator" link Michaelinvegas posted. Once you input your motor + battery + wheel measurements; you can test different pulley sizes to get the speed you want

I believe so (but I'm sure someone can confirm for sure), bigger wheel size usually means more rubber on the outside. 

Just a picture I found online: [Different wheel sizes](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQQbHiH-FRHPrvN3d64Pm8vMvqqs5ndKNyegHBe0-aeiHVu2Ro3)
