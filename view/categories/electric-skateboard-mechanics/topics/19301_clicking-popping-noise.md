I just got a new belt for my board and towards the back of the wheels where the gear is it is making a odd clicking noise that sounds like a pop. Any ideas what it is.

Need video...

Usually if you hear a clicking ... it's loose motor pulley rocking on the shaft ... blue thread locker and re tighten

  Thank you for the advice man it worked, I sanded down the truck and it rides better than a boosted board ;)
