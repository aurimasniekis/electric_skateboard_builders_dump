It seems we have a great selection of quality China clones for many components of esk8 except for enclosures.

Does anyone know of any Boosted enclosure clones or any China enclosures that are affordable?

Good call dude, it's not like these are super innovative or they are cloning or stealing anything, but we could use cheaper and abundant enclosures on the market. The Torque boards stuff must be made in china, I would track down who makes those, they would be the cheapest option.
