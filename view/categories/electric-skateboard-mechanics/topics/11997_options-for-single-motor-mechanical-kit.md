I'm looking to build my electric skateboard very soon and currently looking for the right parts. I'm planning on getting the DIY Single Motor Mechanical kit [here.](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-single-motor-mechanical-kit/?attribute_motor-mount-size=63mm+Motors&attribute_wheel-color=83mm+Orange&attribute_motor-mount-pulley=16T+HTD5+12mm+Motor+Pulley) Not sure which size motor mount to get for [this 6374](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/?attribute_pa_motor=6374) motor though. Any ideas? Thanks.

Well a 63mm motor needs a 63mm mount ;)

Ok, I assumed it was a 63mm but I didn't know for sure. Also which pulley should I get, the 13t or 16t one?

A 6374 motor means 63mm diameter and 74mm stator lenght. 

Search for Calculator here on the forum to find your desired speed/gearing

I have the same motor and mount. 16T motor and 36T wheel on 83mm wheels. It works really well.

@M1Rob - For most 16T/36T is ideal. Unless your running 10S/12S and want more torque (don't need the top speed) then 13/36 is nice.
