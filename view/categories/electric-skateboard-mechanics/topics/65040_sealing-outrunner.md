Iâ€˜ll get soon some sensored alienpower outrunner. For the rough and wet winter time I thought it would be better to seal them somehow (read here that some people broke there vesc because of shorted sensor wires etc.)
Wanted to ask if somebody as experience in it and can recommend some sealing spray, or other stuff to get the motors more resitant.

PS: if somebody know the right size of pliers to open the can I would be happy to get this information

Acrylic conformal coating
Take motors apart. Put it on everything except the bearings.

Do you know the size of the clips on the stators? Wanna order the right pliers to take them off but guess most of what i found till now have a too big diameter to fit in the holes. Sorry donâ€™t know the right English word for it...ðŸ˜…

I do not, I just asked @b264 the same question a few days ago. Lol 
Only reason I know the answer.

If you fuck it up. I have spare circlips I can give you and put it in the ESC package

I last time tried to open with two small metal sticks...itâ€™s a pain in the assðŸ™ˆ
Unfortunately iâ€˜m now in vacation and canâ€™t check it by my self.

If you can find ceramic bearings that would be best , if not check and clean them regularly

I think so. The motors I have have 8mm shaft but also are 10mm where the circlip begins

I don't even know if you can actually get ceramic bearings for Motors.....

I just know if you could.  They would last longer in wet environments.
If you're going to ride with metal bearings in the rain it'd be wise to check, clean and replace them.

As an alternative I offer some [motor dust cases](https://pwrboards.com/collections/accessories/products/pwr-motor-case) on my website: www.pwrboards.com 

 Just trying to help :)

I read that motors are inherently water resistant?

But keeping from debris and water is also keeping me undecided on sealed or open motors

The windings I think are water resident (as long as you donâ€™t put them under water)
The sensors usually not and I want to go sensored Foc in the winter.

Ah I see so when they mean water resistant they are referring to sensorless motors? Hmm i thought getting soaked or wet would be fine for them regardless of sensorless or not

There are sealed motors which sealed ðŸ˜…
The other motors water resistant. The windings separated from each other, as long as you donâ€™t short them somehow they fine.
The sensor I worry a bit more sensible to water, thatâ€™s why I want to seal them.

[/quote]

yeah haha I'm looking at the Maytech sealed ones, so far they appear to not have any overheating issues as @hyperIon1 has tested in the texas environment but does mention temp to go up a few degrees. Shouldn't be an issue in colder places like where you plan on riding though as for me, its always hot and humid here :sweat_smile:

I tried ceramic bearings and came back to steel.  They wear out, but you can replace them if so.  When the ceramic ones fail, they fail spectacularly.  The steel ones just get harder to turn.

Good to know your experience.
Will stay with steel for the first.
Maybe you know the size of pliers to open the spring on the shaft?

I thought most motors Were dipped into epoxy ?

It is mainly the sensor assembly that needs to be taken care of.  
  
The windings are **usually** dipped but not always, especially on the cheap motors.

Actually, you can! Took me some time to find them for a reasonable price but my APS HEV motor uses the same size as some RC cars for the rear bearing that's in the stator.

[Bearings here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VR53T28/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_kKBDBbN2T75S9)

I only replaced the outer bearing, the stator has two small bearings in a row. I knew ceramic could fail badly so there's a steel one as a backup.

The larger bearing on the front of the motor was not removeable in my experience. It was glued in very well and I wouldn't want to torch it because it may have plastic bearing retention or it may melt the stator wire coating. Because of this I'm just putting a rubber gasket seal integrated on the motor mount which will seal against the shaft.

I ride in heavy rain quite often. I took my motors appart and covered the sensor PCB in 24hr epoxy. Seems to have worked fine so far. It was a bit thick though, a thinner coating would probably be less hassle.

just seal the sensor pcb, brushless motors are waterproof already.
