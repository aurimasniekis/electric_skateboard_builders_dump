Is the a significant difference between a chain drive and a belt drive? Is there any reason to choose one over the other?
Thanks

Chain is lighter, cheaper, easier to change gearing, more resitance against dirt.
It needs to get oiled, check the tension, after a while chain and motorsprocket have to be replaced.
Can be dangerous if the chain breaks and blockade the wheel.

Belt is looking badass, sounds less loud, runs smoother, needs less maintenace and no need for oil... no dirty hands... but wider interference countur, more drag, dont like stuff like grass and mud and debris.
Timingbelts have to replaced, pulleys normally not.

I think you mean chain is heavier. Belts practically weigh nothing!

I'm personally doing a chain drive on my board. I like the idea of no broken belts and always having quick torque with no stretch in the chain. I realize the downsides (noisier, oil requirement, etc.) but none of these really sway me the other way. It comes down to a personal preference with pros and cons on both sides. Most people obviously choose belts. It seems within a year or so hub motors will put this belt drive vs chain drive discussion into the archives.

I have an electric skateboard  with hub motor drive, the skateboard with belt motor can't move when turning off, with hub motor can move when turn off the switch, I think the hub motor is better.:wink:

I thought chains would be better when I first got here but they even use belts on our electric powered pallet jacks

I think chain makes sense for off road so you don't have to worry about rocks in the belt...
I would to have oil on a clean green eboard...and single belt is still the most bang for the buck....

hubs are coming but torque multiplier are always nice!!

No i meant the overall wheight.
If i compare my Chaindrive Kits with the Beltdrive Kits the BD is heavier, caused to more Parts like Roller and Supportbearing Holder.

Where do you get your timing belts/what brand (Germany)?
Conrad SIT timing belts have been terrible. The teeth are not protected/become fluffy. Belt snapped after just 50 KM.

Currently ordered some Powergrip GT3 and HTD5 belts.

I have a chain drive on my main board, I made my son's board with belt drive...

I much prefer chain drive for the following reasons;

Strength
Durability
No slippage
No stretch
Better, more reliable brakes
Impervious to debris

I use a silicon based lubricant for my chain and it's fairly quiet, not as quiet as my son's belt drive though but the difference is hardly noticeable.
I rarely maintain my chain as it doesn't really need it. Once every two months is a must, but I do it once a month because I like to, lol.

sounds a whole lot better. I am currently replacing belts every 1.5 weeks (after roughly 450km).

if your belts are only lasting 1.5 weeks your doing something wrong...

i’ve put over 500 miles on the same belt with no sign of wear

Mountain board, currently with loads of mud. It's winter time here. I essentially only drive offroad.
Two belts ripped (stone caught in between wheel hub and belt) and one was of mediocre quality/teeth had no protection.

Lots of hills, lots of braking, lots of fast accelerations.

Optibelt from Mädler are a good price point

Strongbelt is super Nice

Optibelt HD is super nice but double the price

Doesn't chain reduce your battery run time too?

No, its oppisite. Belts have more drag and therefore uses more power

huh, no kidding. That's great to know. Maybe I will look into chain drive for my next build then

Just logged in to say around 2-3 months ago i switched from belt to chain. Personally im so much happier with chain.

I weigh just under 100kgs so prior to switching over I would be very very careful when going down a steep hill (using brakes) as Ive had a belt snap on me before and the same with going up hills. Now that I'm using chain I can actually use the brakes to bring me to a complete stop without any issues and get me up some nice inclines with no slippage

on the downside it is a hell of a lot louder.

 Also im using a half link chain as there is more spots to lengthen/shorten

100g more or less In my oppinion it doesnt matter much to almost anyone

Except that belts could be a bit safer because of the belt slippage in some scenarios than chains

I'm using chain because my board is half assed and I couldn't get belt pulleys to line up, but the chain and sprockets allows a lot of play and wiggle room

Yeah the noise kills it for me. So far I have logged nearly 1000 miles without breaking a belt on our idler drive with loose belts so for me there isn't to much of a draw to switch to chains. Changing pulleys is actually easier on pulley drive and you do not need to check the tension constantly if you are using the loose idler technique we have implemented in our design. The trick is taking up just enough slack so you don't pop the belt teeth during hard braking, no more no less.

Stoked with chain drive from @okp. My main priority was to eliminate belt slip both heavy acceleration and of course and not least under braking. Yes it's noisy. But the noise seems to drop a lot after they wear in a little (30-50km). The stainless chain and sprocket provided by Unik look fantastic and should actually work harden over time. As for getting your hands dirty....? Just drip or spray the lube on. No need to touch it with your precious manicured soft hands. Icky! 
Anyway they are confidence inspiring. At 110kg and with little mechanical sympathy these are great. Full throttle low speed steep incline hard pack dirt all my weight pulling all the amps and turning it into wheel spin not belt slip... Bliss. 25% decline wheels locked up and tyres skidding yep reaching the limit of traction not limited by the drive train. Finally.
So many thanks to okp working perfectly.

thanks mate ! I'm proud that your are enjoying it ! On my side, I tried the chain drive but it does not fit my riding style (I'm 72kg, and ride in urban/dirt) where I need very limited noise and lightweight so I quickly came back to the belts.

I'm going to produce some even lighter models soon, probably early march and will send you two free of charge for testing and feedback !
