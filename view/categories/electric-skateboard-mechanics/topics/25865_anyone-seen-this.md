Anyone seen this type of mounting for dual drive before? Seems cool if your trucks aren't big enough to fit dual motors.

@PatRocks and @MoeStooge, those are similar but I personally have never seen it with one mount longer then the other on the same side of the truck. I wonder if anything is different with 2 different size belts :thinking:.

If it helps answer your question, I have the 6374 on a 295mm with an idler. The other is a 6355 on a 280mm belt. Worked great, but really limited my ground clearance tho

Electric board on Revenge trucks?

Eeeek!   

Cool lookin setup, but those trucks are going to so sketchy.  Revenge Trucks can be fun on the right setup, but they'd be the last trucks I would choose to ride at high speeds, or with two motors bolted to it.  Not only are they super tall, but they have an incredibly tight turning radius.  They are very squirrelly even at low speeds.  It looks like your motor mount would fit Randals or Paris trucks.  You may consider a different truck later on...

@jmasta dude, you are spot on, . The renegades  were a poor choice by my brother in law.  We single motored it and the truck walk was terrible.

Didn't try dual drive at the same time, but I did try dual mounts so I could swap 97mm urethane wheels and use the other motor to drive them. Kind of an experimental multi-terrain setup.

@Trdolan03 
Inrunners can be fully sealed, so they are much more resistant to weather.

Outrunners have a better power output to size/weight ratio than inrunners. That's why most DIYers use outrunners.

Considering that this guy used gears and inrunners, I'm guessing that these were repurposed RC car parts.

That's a big negatory.  Inrunners have a better copper to Iron ratio per Square mm and therefore run more efficient.  Also would like to add they have a better Watt per Square mm area ratio then the outrunner (more power smaller package).   The low kv outrunner works well with the Esk8 application due to limited gearing options with belt systems and direct drives that limit motor kv..

Just one more point as well, inrunners do not inherently have better cooling. It all depends on construction and design and how quality the motor is.

Outrunners can have forced air cooling (see sk3 6374) while inrunners will be sealed. What esk8er is going to use water cooling?

At a given overall size or weight, outrunners will produce more mechanical power, with or without gearing.

Sorry fella, your information is incorrect.. Watts per size the Inrunner wins..

You can use cooling fins as a substitute for water cooling.  At skateboard speeds and motor location drag would be little.  But I haven't heard of any inrunners overheating on eskate.

Outrunners have more torque, and inrunners tend to run at MUCH higher KV. Esk8 doesn‚Äôt care much about efficiency as it does raw power.

All motors are susceptible to overheating when the power to demand ratio is not properly balanced. If I had a problem with overheating inrunners I would water cool them.  Still might for the pikes peak build..![IMG_20180504_150514|424x500](upload://dzss0ZFVSUuEhNI8L7d33xz4Sa7.jpg)

You better be careful with peristaltic pumps. And replace the head often. Peristaltic pumps are made for small volume. Like dosing coral reef tanks etc, or indoor gardens with nutrients. The tubes wear out. Just pay attention to it...

Our twigs are heavily regulated, in Ireland we don't allow anything over 1m, otherwise it's classified as a branch.

How bout something like this for water cooling (inrunners)...

Damn man, right on!  Setup is from rc boat so in this application the water is force fed through scoop on rear bottom side of boat, wraps around coil and out the side.  

Could definitely just hook water pump to and apply to your inrunners on your board, but like you said, only if you ‚Äúhave‚Äù an overheating issue.
