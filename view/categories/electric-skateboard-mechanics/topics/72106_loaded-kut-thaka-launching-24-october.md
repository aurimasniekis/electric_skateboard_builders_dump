I actually like it better than the Kanthaka; pricey tho.  Good hunting.

Philippines lol yeah shipping stuff here is just as bad as to AU if its from the US just cause its so far away. So I would find it odd if it isn‚Äôt up for grabs in the UK which is closer

I understand and dig the nose-chopping, but chopping the tail is almost a crime against humanity, especially when you are putting heavy batteries on the deck.

Already asked him if He would be interested in making one lol

Edit:
just saw that he commented so I guess safe to say there will be one? :laughing: hoping he was able to order one cause I just checked the site and I can't seem to place an order anymore so it must really be all gone

Doesn't this look a bit like a slightly shorter, much cheaper Loaded Poke with a much shorter wheelbase?

Esk8 wheels will look hilare, look forward to seeing one built!

I saw that @Eboosted made some nice ds enclosures for the Kut Thaka but would love to see pics of a complete electric kut thaka.
I also have a kut thaka, and it's a shame but it is collecting dust since a few months now. Ive put it for trade on the forum but iam still struggling with myself to remove the post. 
Its such a cool little thing...

I did! 
10s4p 20700 sanyo cell
2x flipsky 6.6
Dual 6354 flipsky
Unik mount

It‚Äôs tight, heavy, and i had to put the truck further back. But i love this set up more and more, compare to my hummie and icarus, because it‚Äôs just easier to carry.

Also those caguamas are üëç. I went from 76mm kashasa to orange cag to those, and the ride quality is really improved.

Finally , someone who did it :slight_smile:
Very cool board by the way. I am curious to know if it remains stable at higher speeds. Did you change your bushing setup? Also, what range do you get with the 10s4p?
I was planning to sell my kut thaka deck but now that i saw your build it motivates me to keep it and use my 2 6355's that are collecting dust.

## \#44 Posted by: hiboute Posted at: 2019-04-09T07:00:39.068Z Reads: 71

Well at first i was in 15/40t. So lot of torque and top speed at 34km/h. But i really needed a little more. So now i‚Äôm 15/32t and top speed of 43km/h and it is perfect.

For the range i get 35km (i‚Äôm 110kg).

I had to change the bushings to riptide double barrel on front and cone and barrel at the back. It was more needed at the back because the motor mount was touching the enclosure a lot. Now it is perfect and carve like a dream.

Also at first i used the new e-caliber. But it bended. So now it is the standard caliber 2 truck and i can still use 15mm belts with no changes.

## \#46 Posted by: mikedv Posted at: 2019-04-09T07:04:34.015Z Reads: 69

Good to know, i have some caliber clones laying around and i think the 6355 aps motors might fit.
Does the board remain stable above 40kmh?

## \#47 Posted by: von Posted at: 2019-04-09T07:12:19.846Z Reads: 72

```
I would recommend a split angle setup. I‚Äôve gone up to 45km with a 43 degree rear bp. Also I lengthened the wheel base so that helps too. In regards to both motor bite and general stability at high speeds. 

Also my second post ever. Hi everyone!  Lurkester![image|375x500](upload://4XgSSjtoQ6fYJo0RbXwKm42oAN7.jpeg) ![image|230x500](upload://qeLYdmAP4YxSAscAqLWMakLoolD.jpeg)

Ok , i'll keep my kut thaka and will add a 10s3p and dual 6355 190kv.
Still hesitating about the wheels i'll use . I have some 97mm's laying around but will probably use 90mm popoca's instead.Or i might go for the Cuagamas like you did.

How much further did you mount the rear trucks to fit the mounts? I also drilled new holes for rear. But I only did extended it by half a cm. 

Did you find the the wheels wells lined up better?
```

---
## \#51 Posted by: hiboute Posted at: 2019-04-09T07:51:37.954Z Reads: 63

About 3cm, but no it is not lined up better.
In any case, it will depend on your mount.

Indeed, the mounts are key in this build since it‚Äôs such a a small board. I have the eboosted enclosure as well. Am considering extending the holes even further.
