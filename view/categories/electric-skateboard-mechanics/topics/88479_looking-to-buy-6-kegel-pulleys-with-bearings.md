Been looking for a while for some pulleys with bearings on them for Kegel core wheels but the cheapest I could find was $300, kinda hard to swallow for a few pulleys lol

Anyone have any ideas where I could find more pulleys or should I just buy a 3d printer and start making them my self?

Is torqueboards making pulleys with bearings inside of them for their TB110 wheels? Might be worth waiting for those if you can :thinking:

Just ask @marcmt88
He can change the I.D. of the pulley to 22mm so bearings fit

Yeah but he said it will be a while and I'm not willing to wait.

I may just get a 3d printer and make them my self I found a 36t file on thingyverse I need a 32t now.
