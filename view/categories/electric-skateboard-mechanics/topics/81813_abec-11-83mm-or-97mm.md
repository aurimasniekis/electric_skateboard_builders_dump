Hi, I am using a 6364-190kv with 10s3p battery with flywheels clones, and 16T -36T pulleys.
I would like to upgrade to original abec 11 flywheels, but i don't know what size to buy. I can't decide between 83 mm:

or 97mm:

I like my speed rn but I wouldn't mind increasing it, also the 97 mm refly wheels seem better than the classic abec 11 flywheel. 
Also, does 97 mm make a big difference in comfort ride quality respect to 83 in your experience?
On the other hand, I am concerned for the reduced torque. Will I still be able to go up moderate hills if i make the upgrade?
Also, I know that bigger wheels = more speed, but what wheel size is better for more accelleration?
thanks for the help

Is 90mm a common size? I didn't find this size for abec wheels

The 90 refly uses the newer thane formula as well.

- Used here on the forums. They're normally in great condition but heavily discounted

@paoloalb  Iâ€™ve heard the black reflex urethane isnâ€™t so great. It has a more abrupt point when maximum grip is exceeded with only slightly higher overall grip. The green classic thane is tried and tested and is very enjoyable to ride and slide if thatâ€™s your bag. They break loose very predictably and still have fair grip. Iâ€™m running 76mm classic flywheels on my new board and absolutely love them. Iâ€™ve also used 83mm classic flywheels and they ride much softer than the 76â€™s and are still enjoyable to slide! 

You canâ€™t go wrong with any size in the classic green thane. Itâ€™s good shit. Iâ€™m trying to push esk8 to smaller gear so itâ€™s more comparable to traditional longboarding so I would say 83â€™s or smaller but to each their own! 

I would even go so far as to say that if you dislike 76â€™s or 83â€™s in classic thane Iâ€™ll buy them from you ðŸ˜‚

Good luck!
