Does somebody have a set of Trampa Infinity Trucks lying around and could measure the width and height of the outer truck for me? 

This truck: https://www.brettsport.de/trampa-infinity-truck

My Vertigo (should be the same measurements as Infiniy) 
width: 21.6mm
height: 22mm
flat length: at least 22mm, can be up to 30mm

The measurements can vary due to manufacturing tolerances.

Here some more if needed BTW the axle spacer is 18.2mm
