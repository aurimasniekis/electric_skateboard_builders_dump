So I'm interested in hearing peoples different setups. I believe this downhill deck was initially designed to run a 50/20 spit front and rear. Right now I'm using TB 50 degree trucks with 12 degree boltzen risers. So I'm at a 53/47 split. I did this to make sure that I had a good turning radius but also still decently stable. At ~30mph it is pretty damn stable but I'm wondering if I should mess around with flipping the back riser to give me 53/ 23. Turning radius will suffer greatly I assume but is it still manageable? Or will it drive like a bus at low speed and be really hard to maneuver?

Let's hear your experiences with different setups on this amazing deck!

[/quote]

wouldn't it be 65/35 with 50 degree trucks? I don't have one but...
plus or minus 15 degrees respectively.

whats the point in having that deck if you take out all the wedge/dewedge?

might as well just get a top mount or double drop if that is your thing?

or am I missing something :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

the stock Carvon trucks are 50 i think. I'll have to check on that. The Evos will have 1/2" flat risers.

the carving is incredible and the stability is amazing. Honestly i don't understand the sorcery behind it. i didn't realize you could have so much stability at speed AND such a deep carve on the same board without ankle enhancing drugs.  Loose and snappy.

Somewhere I read it was designed for 35° Randall's.

I've been eying the evo for ages. 

Found it.

I've spoken with Sam at LY and he says the Evo was designed for 50 degree trucks, using any other geometry decreases the stability and carving ability of the board and produces a ride quality that is decreased from what was intended by the wedge/dewedge of the deck geometry..

50 degree makes 65/35
35 makes 50/20
35/50 split makes 50/35

I'd be more likely to run 50 rear and 35 up front to end up with 50f/35r...65 is to tunrny imo

I'm the last one to say "don't do that, its not what the builder intended",   Hell, that's kinda the point, do what you feel brudda :slight_smile:.   I really enjoy the 65/35 geometry, a big ass board with dual 6374's that carves like butter at 20-30mph is a frikkin dream.

I've got my hangers pretty loose but am using really stiff bushings.  Its counter to standard practice but I also have a tall 96a bushing street side in the rear.  Like I said, messed up bussing setup, but it works for me.  

That's one of the cool things about the Evo, the size and the geometry makes is perfect for experimentation.

This.. but 50 trucks or 35 trucks... It's still the same end split of 30 degrees.. I think the three I listed are all using the raking to your advantage just in varying ammounts

50 degree trucks = 65/35
35 degree trucks = 50/20
35 front 50 rear = 50/35. 

I'm not saying this in stone as I'm about go test with a few BP angles. But I think each could be usable without taking away the advantages of having the raking in the first place

That's true, so i suppose maybe its the differential that makes the magic.

Also on the Evos due to the motor placement and hanger features, the rear wheel base is wider than the front, which also definitely influences the carving on these. 

That may have been an accident, but it was a fortunate one. We were experimenting with varied width trucks not too long ago with mixed results, but on these decks it works really well.

HSo here’s my takeaway. The board was designed for 65/35. 

Know one really knows if the board will handle the same as long as the differential is the same i.e. 65/35 vs 50/20 (I’m thinking it won’t though). 

Time for some testing I suppose!

Well surprise surprise 65/35 felt wayyyy better. Need harder bushings tho. I didn’t realize I actually had it setup with stock inner barrel boardsides and 89a rear roadside and 86a front roadside. Way too loose for my weight (200lb)

Does it really make a huge difference having a non symmetrical setup? My board does almost 50 km/hr and I am using standard off-the-shelf 50 degree Caliber II trucks but never felt unstable. Now, for the new build I am going to use much wider trucks at around 45 degree (front and back) which should in principle increase the stability to some bit.

So... I spent the afternoon testing some different baseplate angles. I have on hand, 35, 45 and 50 for SurfRodz 200mm RKP. So it may differ for different width hangars.

Setups tested down hill @ 25-35mph in my development.
65/35 - no, to twitchy imo (50deg)
60/35 - super yes(1st) (45deg/50deg)
60/30 - yes(2nd) (45deg)
50/35 - no feels half dead (35deg/50deg)
50/30 - no not as dead but still not lively (35deg/45deg)
50/20 - yes(3rd) (35deg)

60/30 and 50/20 feel basically identical, 50/20 leans more so it's a bit harder to slide vs 60/30. But if you need more grip vs slip 50/20 is grippier.

60/35 is something special. It's also the only setup with a 25 degree differential. 

15&20 degrees differentials in general just don't feel right. 

Is anybody able to test with 10" hangars?

Wow really? I'm using a 5mm wedge in the front to take away some angle so I effectly have 60/35 set up I didn't think this would would be the best set up but I ended up loving it.

Usually felt that only increasing the front angle to change the characteristics of a board lacking. Much rather I use the split angles that I am used to and change the bushing in front. Both in durometer and mixture.

Stable AS F set up. 43 / 30 Krank /venom bushings 89a/92a
Stable more turny / lively 43/30 SHR venom 89a/92a .

Well a lot can be done with stock calibers. Stance weight distribution, stable core and foot position over the trucks are more important for stability.

Also depends heavily on riding style. Straights with slow turns, pretty much anything is stable. Usually in skating, your equipment is the last thing holding you back. Got multiple young ones and talented riders rocking cal 50/44. Doing from 70km/h to stand up slides and sending it hard. (usually you start with calibers move onto kodiaks or Sabre and end up with precision's as soon as you dip into serious speeds or hit competitions. Optimizing equipment is always good, but educating and training the set up is so much more important. 

How much different is a split angled set up. Well extremely. Besides bushings and wheelbase the angle in which you basically input your weight into your steering plays a big role. Since we usually want to minimize steering from the back a lower base plate angle in the back makes your life easier, more stable.

Thanks! Yeah that's what I heard before using a shallower angle on the back. I just can't imagine riding a board that faces upwards towards the front :slight_smile:
Assuming we have the same baseplate angle (and same bushing setup) on front and back truck, would a negative rake (back) and positive rake (front) have a similar effect? I sort of know that rake and baseplate angle are two different things ... but still need to learn a lot. So, please apologize asking these questions since I don't have ++10 years of downhill experience. 


Cheers

But...why would you have the same bushing on front and back?  One if the main reasons to use divergent bushings is to avoid oscillation, aka the wobblies.

for me atm. same bushings but with double cupped washers to make them more restrictive. All because I take every chance I get to ride switch. Need as much muscle memory and fine control as I can on my back leg (since its half dead almost no sensory since my accident). 

But for freeride I almost always run same bushings front and back. Only if I really want to push it I take my "fast" set up with different bushings and 43/20.

Well simply put, the baseplate of your truck sets your turning radius. So same force aplied to the same bushing on a differently angled baseplate will give you a more or less aggressive turning radius. In summary baseplate angle = controls if you either have more turn or lean. (turn means wheel stronger change of direction, lean means how much you can change the angle of your deck to your trucks. Super important for me personaly. Gives you more weight on the wheels and more security to grip turns. Guess an Image would be nice here. 

https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2175/4361/files/anatomy-of-longboard-trucks-infographic-12-truck-baseplate-degrees.png?v=1501096108

So rake, could not word it better so :"Rake
Rake is one of the hardest truck features to understand. It affects the ratio between turn and lean. It is defined as the amount of axle offset from the center of hanger rotation, measured in millimeters (+ / -).

It is important to note that rake is NOT changing the rotation of the hanger (aka the baseplate degree of the truck). It only changes the location of the wheels relative to the axis of rotation. This controls how much the truck dives into a turn and how much the truck resists lean. The amount of rake can be measured in millimeters from the axis of rotation. Rake that is measured in baseplate degree changes is not accurate. Again, rake does NOT change the hanger axis of rotation."


Some good resources for the basics.

The Evo deck is designed for 50s. I don't know why people keep wedging and changing geometry. If you put 50s on there, my god man. It really is the dreamiest deck on the planet. I say that in spite of pressing my own. 

Any build on the Evos, especially the Carvons... i mean shit just stop building anything else. Everyone just hang up whatever your working on and start building on Evos if you really love yourself and want to fill the world with joy and wonder. 

Full disclosure, i just finished another build and am now drinking. I have the tires on backwards, and i fucking hate myself for that, but whatever. There are running TB's 50s. Because 50 is actually a really good all purpose angle. But 45s on the front is also nice.

Can someone else measure the angles on the 39" Evo deck?

I know they are supposed to be +/- 15 degrees but I measured mine and they are closer to -9 degrees on the rear and +10 degrees on the front.

So without any wedges and the same truck angles the stock difference is 19 degrees instead of 30.

i tested today with 15 and 10 degree risers( idk how different the feel is compared to changing the baseplate) used TB 50 trucks.
front\rear
1. 50\25 - i really really liked this one but the board is not able to stand on the rear 6.5" pnummies like before lol. i will keep using it thou bc it feels very stable and still able to turn. very predictable 

2. 55\35 - feels weird, way better than 65\35 but i felt like i had to put more effort(body weight use and foot placement) turning with this setup at less than 15mph than with 50\25 even though the front angle is higher.   

3. 65\35 - i wouldn't recommend it pass 20-25mph (twitchy). slight unevenness, gravel,cracks on the road can get difficult to control pass that speed.

if anything you would turn more but less stable at higher speed depending on skill level 
for freeride and some downhill i would get a symmetrical board; for speed i love my evo :grin:
