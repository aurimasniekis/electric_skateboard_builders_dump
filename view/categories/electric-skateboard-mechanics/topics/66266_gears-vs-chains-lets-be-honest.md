salutations riders,

i started out with a belt drive like the majority of us. it *was* the standard but it seems that more and more people are moving away from traditional belt drives.

now hubs seemingly are becoming *the* standard and while belt drives are still valid, i noticed gear drives appearing here and there. 

how did we get here? what made people switch from belt to hub?

aesthetics played a big role of course. esk8s looked cleaner...it was quiet too...we all saw beautiful stealth builds :slight_smile:

**BUT**

now we see gear drives appearing. why? is there an unsaid truth about belt drives and hubs? we all know the pros and cons and lets leave it at that...live and let live right?

with the known issues in both belt and hubs many seem to have interest in a drive train that will solve some of the problems we know but why do many people shy away from a chain drive? because its noisy, and messy,heavy...maintenance is a pain?..so they say. but why are so many interested in a gear drive then? 

its still true that belts and hubs are *the* main drives people choose to use with their respective strengths and weakness. so lets focus on gears vs chains.

gears are getting a lot of attention lately but is it getting it for the right reasons?  lets ask questions.

why gears? obviously because theres a huge advantage in being able to choose gear ratio vs hub motors fix kv rating. 

gears vs belts - obviously gears have a more direct power transfer and the reliability and durabilty of such a gear drive is also a factor that plays a big role.

both points can also be found in a chain drive. so why on earth should people be using gears instead ? 

one of the *turn-offs* a chain drive have is noise. yeah what about it? both chain and gears will be noisier than hubs or belts i dare say. but which one is louder? chain or belt? who knows? ive yet to hear the difference...but i  imagine it sounding similar to a 1/5 scale RC car...which is far from quiet. 

maintenance? well both chains and gears need lube. from my experience with dry lube my chains only got messy once...and that was after my first ride when the chains *pressed* out excess lube. a quick wipe and it was  spotless once more. no cleaning since. a gear drive on the other hand will need grease. that will get messy quick. "yeah, put it in a gearbox then"...sheesh...
well...its still messier than chains with dry lube.

...which leads me to weight. sure, it doesnt matter much while your cells are delivering power...but wait till you have to carry that weight lol. i bet a gearbox will weigh similar if not more compared to a "traditional" chaindrive.

"yeah, but i dont carry...i push" how much drag will a gear drive have vs. chain drive? i have less drag on chains than belt...but gears?dunno...do you know? 

flexibility. how fast and how easy can you change gear ratios on chains vs gears? whats easier to repair? how bout the availability of the parts? aaand if you ever want to do this on a gear box its probably safe to say that youll get your fingers greasy...again its gonna be messy. replacing a chain is similar to replacing a belt. easy. if i want to change the motor sprocket i just loosen one grub screw vs opening a greasy gear box.

alignment on a chain drive is also more forgiving compared to a gear drive. gears will require a more precise alignment and the proper distance to the individual gears. only the more experienced DIYers may be able to make such drives sucessfully. 

So where are the advantages of a gear drive that justify choosing it over a basic chain drive ? are we over complicating things here ? what i see happening is that there **is** a desire to solve the problems found in belts and hub motors. **BUT** have'nt we adressed and solved those problems with a chain drive yet? sure its a bit noisy but its a small price to pay given the advantages it brings. what disadvantages are there in a chain drive that a gear drive seeks to solve ? (if any at all).

gears try to solve the same problems that has already been adressed by chain drives but gears also bring along their own issues...noise, weight, drag (depending on design obviously), maintenance,parts availability,flexibilty...just to name a few.

so, what do you say? gear drives are coming...but will they stay? what are your thoughts on this?

Gear Drives appear to be more efficient from what some companies are reporting? How efficient has remained to be seen but efficient none the less. Plus a Gearbox looks cleaner than a chain drive / belt drive with covers Everything points back to looking like a skateboard again

In my opinion gear drives are only worth it once you start using helical or herringbone gears.

Another possible point would be on atb's where the security of a gearbox blocking out any wild track debris getting into the system could offer some extra peace of mind. 

The main disadvantage a gear system has is just the pricing imo, chains are easier to maintain, swap out or fine tune to your precise liking like you already said, but if you have the cash I don't see any real disadvantages either from gear to chain.

I know I repeated a lot of things but well, @slick your wrote a pretty specced out  case here üëç

@Bokard 
right, so MTB's definitely profit from a closed frar box.  but what about durability? how many teeth mesh in a gear drive together vs in a chain drive?  the way I see it is that the loads on a gear drive is concentrated in the teeth that are momentarily meshing together...we're talking about putting all the load on a few teeth.  compare it with a chain drive where the stress is more spread through out the whole drive train...motor sprocket, chain and finally to the wheel sprocket. this will certainly have an impact on the durability of gear drive. so gear drives may consequently be dimensioned bigger to ensure durability and safety = more weight.
wouldnt it be easier to make some sort of chain guard or enclosure?

@Jc06505n 
i can imagine gears being more efficient than belts (less drag - given it's aligned perfectly). a gear box on the other hand will still be another *thing* that needs to be mounted on the hanger. if its only about the appearance of an open drive then its easily solved with an enclosure  to be more easy on the eyes. beauty is in the eye of the beholder though and is not arguable. i personally enjoy the *raw* look of an open drive train and its practical properties. 

i get the part about aesthetics and looking like a skateboard. but i think that aesthetics is not the main reason for a gear drive. honestly, i think one of the biggest reason is...well...science. i understand that very well and its important that ideas materialise.

I have not much experience yet with the gearboxes. I think that if designed right, a gearbox should be just as durable if not more than chains. They have proven to be in every other aplication where high torque is needed. I don't think the gears or sprockets will wear as much, but the chain can be a source of malfunction as I've had a snap on my friends board as on my bikes. It doesn't happen often, but to my experience a proper steal gear  takes a lot more constant abuse than a chain. (thinking about an uphill start for example)

Helical and derivatives will likely not come to esk8 on scale simply because the precision required to run them efficiently will be ruined by the astounding vibrations our drivetrains kick out. Obviously there's super smart people out there that might solve this issue but there in lies the second issue: Cost. Honestly straight gears bashing the crap out of each other to get a job done is actually pretty cheap to achieve, as soon as you start adding the complexity of fancy gears things become expensive and complicated.

They would be quieter I suppose, but warmer?

I definitely agree with you, but If I had the money to spend I'm pretty sure I'd go with A well designed Herringbone gearbox. My next box will have one that I am designing but I'll also be making another motor mount with a chain drive. I should probably mention that It will probably be a power hungry MTB build and not a clean street carver or anything like that. It will be more of an experiment board anyway, since I'm already going to be building a custom (mybe build in?) lipo pack

I think people are choosing hub over belt because they want freewheeling without resistance. Maybe you could make a belt/chain drive freewheel like a bicycle, but then braking wouldn't work! :frowning:
My idea was to use some sort of clutch to engage/disengage the motor from the rest of the drive system, but I couldn't find any in the right size. Hopefully someone more capable will manufacture it! :smile:

sounds like you're on a mission. i recently stepped up and switched to a chain drive  . besides the noise (sounds like a turbine @ higher rpm - i actually enjoy it now) there are no disadvantages compared to my old belt drive. 

@brenternet
looking back at my RC hobby days where I dealt    with the most basic gears  (basic straight gears) i remember those to be rather noisy. i cant imagine gears being quiet unless they're non metal gears. but even then...its still going to be noisy. so i imagine gear drives sounding like 1/5 scale rc cars.

I own Belt Drives and Hub motor (raptor 2). I don't think Hubs are the future imo it's a passing fad it has so many dissadvantages. The best thing about hub is the looks (subjective) and Free roll.  I got my first idler belt set up and then free roll is just as good as a hub motor.

I don't like gear drive for multiple reasons, much heavier, super loud, helical cut gears bring down noise but not completly, it's not easy to change gear ratios and they are usually designed to work with one size wheel unless it's jedboard but i don't consider them relavent cause they use tiny toy motors (4020) and it's not available yet, also gear drives can be quite choppy at low throttle, FOC helps alot but still not as smooth as a belt drive. 

Imo belt has always been king and it never lost that title and I don't see it happening anytime soon.

BTW I think chain drive works well too but I dont have much experience with chain drive set ups. All I know is that motorcycles generally use Chain or belts and few have propeller shafts but what I'm saying is if chain or belt is good enough for a powerful bike then it should be fine on a esk8

I've used chain drive, it's frikkin loud and has a tendency to grab debris. I've heard people say the like it slot, I'm just not one of them. 

The major benefits if gear drive the low WH usage, it's much less than belts, and the torque increase. 

I personally think helical gears are not a good idea as the tortion stress is increased econetially from a standard spur gear.  The best performance would be herringbone gears but the manufacturing cost is about x10 of spur gears.

I'll keep it simple and to the point.

They all work well enclosed from debris. They all have maintenance to a certain extent when enclosed. So what gives?

- chains are loud
- chains might not need as good of alignment as belts and gears, but still have a necessary tension or you get the same delayed throttle as belts just not as much
- belts skip can skip and shred
- belts switch side of tension like chains when going from acceleration to deceleration, making throttle feel delayed, can cause a bucking feeling.
- gears have the smallest back lash when switching tension sides, torque feels direct
- gears have the lowest rolling resistance
- gears - pom with steel gears do not need lube, but can benefit from noise reduction with lube
- gears are higher pitched than belts but about the same decibel, so they seem louder, because we hear higher frequencies better then low

As I said. They all have their benefits and they all work well, when enclosed. But the moment you expose any of them without a case, debris wears on all of them differently, and can cause different levels of failure or street face-ability

So the real question is, why don't more people enclose the drive systems, to remove the debris from the equation and pick the drive system that suites you?

How exactly does debris affect the chain? So many proven platforms use chain, like dirtbikes, mountain bikes, motorcycles...all which are exposed to equal or greater amounts of debris. I'll admit I haven't used chain on my MB, but I'm considering it as a middle ground between belt and gear.

My gear drive was loud as hell. Belt was a super quiet (but skips too much on my 80mm motors). So I'm thinking of going chain, which will be louder than belt, but quieter than gear, but hopefully won't skip as much.

We do.

http://www.trampaboards.com/2019-pro-belt-driven-electric-mountainboard-p-25948.html

Free of noise, clean, 100% sealed off, high torque transfer with big idler pulley, no backlash (very short belt), support bearing for both pulleys, very efficient, small and little complex + the board can reverse against a wall without hitting the drive or motors,  1:5 gearing is possible. 

A reason for gears would be higher gearing ratio, something like 1:6, 1:7. This would make the motor run a bit more efficient at the same torque output. Most of the spur gear drives we see don't improve on gearing, 
we don't see that really. 

Hubs: To many downsides ranging from negative gearing (0,8:1) to ride comfort, skinny wheels, low efficiency, therefore to much excess heat in a PU insulated motor, strain on motor bearings, vibrations inside the motor, Impacts on the motor....  To many technical issues and downsides IMHO. 
The "better free coasting argument": This is only true if the motor lacks torque. If it is designed to output high torque, coasting is not a single bit better compared to a geared drive outputting the same amount of torque.
You can't have the best of both worlds! Either you have low torque and excellent coasting, or high torque and less free coasting. This fact is independent from the system you use. Coasting manly relates to possible torque output of the system. 

Chain: expensive bicycles have belt drives, Harley Davidson and BMW use belts on their motorbikes, heavy machinery uses belts, car engines use belts to drive pumps and the cam shaft. Belts have proven to be very efficient (98%), free of maintenance and run almost noiseless without any need of lubrication. They exist since ages in various industries and that is a perfect proof of concept. I think some people had bad experiences with belts because they used cheap and thin/narrow belts. A belt of high quality, being wide enough to transfer the torque is pretty much bullet proof and will last for ages while cheap belts can be very shocking quality wise!

 my colleagues car use belts that need to be replaced every 5 years or  after x-thousand km. and it can be a pain in the wallet. my car engine use a chain...no worries...no pain in the wallet. 

similar with my board. chain...with all its advantages. i keep my chain short. there is no lag or jerks. i dont see any advantages a gear drive would have over a chain other than the better gearing options as @trampa already mentioned. i just recently installed an odometer to document the lifespan of a chain drive (04b) under norma street use. we'll see what breaks first and when.

i understand that a drive train on a mtb build must be kept clean and safe. now that would be an environment where i see gear drives and it definitely would be an interesting study gears vs chains...same motor, same gear ratio, both enclosed yadayada.

note to myself:
look for a video where franks claim are demonstrated (regarding trampas quiet chain drive)

Yeah the idler pullies make the belt engauge more teeth allowing you to run the belt very loose and the belt will not skip. Loose belt mean better free roll. 

![received_2240070916216390|375x500](upload://tBvFe23BC5sv9eimWSyysortOfS.jpeg)

No belt slipping or skipping under full throttle or full brakes.

I'm confused! Are you saying the belt tensioner makes the belt looser allowing you to freewheel while also making it tighter which makes it skip less?

It's not tensioner it's an idler it keeps the more teeth.engauged doesn't add tension.

It allows you to run the belt really loose with out the belt skipping.

...back to topic...

this is the first video I¬¥ve seen that demonstrates a gear drive by 
Jens Kappel (if you¬¥re a forum member - awesome video demonstrating a gear drive!)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dfILUz61CQ

I expected it to be louder than a belt or hub motor. I don¬¥t mind how it sounds at all ( though I can imagine that other people hoping to a quiet day in the forest may highly disagree...in this case it wont matter how much noise you are generating with your board. at this point, the mere presence of an esk8er will probably be enough to trigger a verbal argument.)

and yeah - I think i need a MTB! christmas is coming...lol

impressive.

**EDIT**
Just found another gear drive...that is surprisingly "silent".

Gear drives are killing it at the race tracks.  Chain/ nope not yet. Hub/ peaked out in second not much left in the tank.  Belt/ numbers are there but needs some help.    Here is the answer...     Strong noisy low ratio square cut gears passing everything. For those of you who don't like the noise. You will only have to listen to them for a moment.  A nice audible to let you know it's time to move over and make room. https://www.youtube.com/user/1958windsor

[/quote]

Bikes don't have the chain centimeters from the ground with urethane directly beside it that can fling and lodge pebbles into the chain. The reason those and gokarts and the like work is the separation of distance, and angle at which a rock/pebble flying out from under the wheel has no chance of lodging in. Skateboard wheel + chain = perfect mixture of height and debris deflection to create a lodge.

Not enough gearing available for a chain drive. Uses up more Sq area. More rotating mass.  I don't see it working well for any performance application.

I truly wonder how someone can describe belt drive as silent and have 98% efficiency with idlers. Resistance is nuts without any idlers (very apparent when free coasting) and even higher with idlers in place...unless tiny belts are used. 20mm is almost essential for certain high powered builds, which makes it even worse.

Gear drive all the way...for e-mtb at least.

>Bikes don‚Äôt have the chain centimeters from the ground with urethane directly beside it that can fling and lodge pebbles into the chain. The reason those and gokarts and the like work is the separation of distance, and angle at which a rock/pebble flying out from under the wheel has no chance of lodging in. Skateboard wheel + chain = perfect mixture of height and debris deflection to create a lodge

Why couldn't a pebble lodge in a belt drive in the same way?

What about dirt and mountain bikes, while having ground clearance, most definitely have large amounts of dirt, mud and other debris flying into the chain and sprockets? Maybe its a question of chain size?

I guess for esk8 maybe with small chain pebbles can be a problem. But would it be the same with a MB and larger chains?

Gear sound is like protection because everybody is aware you are coming from behind, our in-gear are way louder than normal outer gear-drive and I don‚Äôt even need to horn or etc bicyclist go to the side the instant they hear me :smiley: Will be hard with 1:3 to get same effect in the roads‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even imagine riding with belts and not being angry all the time as no one is aware you are coming :confused:

I like the silence. You know that feeling when you're on a non-electric skateboard and you're on bumpy asphalt, but then up ahead there is freshly paved asphalt; you get to that new road and its just super quiet and smooth and it just feels so nice? That's how I feel between gear and belt drive - gear is noisy and vibrates more and belt is just so quiet and smooth, but also weak and slips.

Yes, I tried gears, they're loud and while it's not a lot, I can feel the vibrations compared to belts. I don't see how in the world you could possibly say straight cut gears are the same decibels as belts. Belts hardly make any noise at all - all I hear is the motors, and nobody looked at me as I approach. Gears on the other hand, people were always turning to see what the hell was making that noise. Now maybe the pitch of the belts is so high its outside the range of human hearing and only dogs and cats can hear it :laughing:

Belt drives are quiet, easy maintenance, and completely tunable. In as little as 5 minutes you can have completely different wheels, pulleys, and belt on the same drive system and have a completely different riding experience. 

Chain drives are all of that with the benefit of added noise and lubricant mess. 

Gear drives are not quite as quiet, not as easy but less frequent maintenance, and not as tunable but still tunable, sort of, not really most of the time. Maybe you can change the gears if they gave you some play in the mount to move the motor. Wheels can be easily swapped, wheel/motor gears not so much unless you have the previously mentioned adjustment options. 

Direct drives are very quiet, very low maintenance, not really tunable but you can swap wheels all day, so get a fat motor can and a fat wheel and call it a day.  

Hub drives are very quiet, but have shitty thin thane, zero options for tuning and fuck you for living unless its a Raptor 2 drive train, then maybe we have something.

yes i do benefit from the sound the chain emits. people hear me and actively make some space without any *hate*. sometimes i even say hi and say thanks and often get a smile...just being a good ambassador of esk8ing i guess. you never know...you may be pissing off an off duty cop. my belt drive was the exact opposite.

greasy chains can be avoided with dry lube such as "squirt" chain wax. my chain does not fling gunk nor it does it attract the horrific amount of dirt people think or say. sure, everybody has seen a messy bike chain and i think that is where this idea is coming from but the truth is that with the right lubrication **dirt is not an issue**. read what cyclists have to say about this topic - a vast majority of cyclists use chain. i know this because i actually only wiped the excess lube **once** off my chain after my first ride. i have'nt spent a single second cleaning anything on my drive train. im not saying its spotless but it aint greasy either its dusty of course but so are your belt drives. theres absolutely no reason to think that you'll have to constantly clean your drive train because the reality is that you wont if you use the right lube.

I'm not surprised you would say that, seeing the ''tiny'' belts that you usually utilise for your builds. Have you ever heard a well tuned 20mm belt? In all fairness, I think the silence of a particular drive depends on the type of build and the strength of the particular thing that causes a certain motion to occur.

But don't forget there are problems with belts. I'll be the first to admit it. 

For example, they shrink when you get them wet

And they stretch a lot. Like all the time. 

Also, they're made from endangered wale fat, which is bad for the environment because you have to burn entire families of wales to get an ounce of rubber for the belts. And they use kitten whiskers for reinforcement so they have to farm kittens then yank out their whiskers which isn't very popular politically. Another part of the process in refining the materials involves the acoustic vibrations of crying abandoned children in subway stations making them very expensive socially. We only use the finest materials in our belts and will not compromise.

Against Japan, perhaps. The shrinking and stretching is due to a wrong mixture of ingredients harvested from (endangered) species. Instead of kitten whiskers, tiger fibers are preferred to combat the adverse effects. There is a reason why small cats don't like water.

The whale blubber is not what it used to be. Stress during capture has a big influence on the decomposition process, resulting in poor rubber.

I have both.


**My problem with gears** is that the stones get stuck between the gearbox and the wheel and tear the tire, and sometimes the inner tube.

![IMG_4663_S|375x500](upload://1eNsgp2p0HayaV8u1VfSljSOEUr.jpg)

Maybe the gear box shouldn't be larger than the hub.

Gearboxes are exposed to stones. I tried to repair that but it last one session only!

![Gearboxes_Fight_Stones_S|249x500](upload://oQ760WqPZiGbzO5tYLxFzqZ9uU8.jpg)

With time and vibrations, the motor slides down and the motorspur comes into contact with the wheelspur and crush i!t :

![IMG_3125_S|375x500](upload://7431cl8JDgoiFYormEGJsJOQI1y.jpg)

I definitely fixed that using these :

![IMG_4748_S|666x500](upload://tAMdn6rYVg7vSLp2dlCI34DlSXv.jpg)
 


**My problem with chains** is that the stones get stuck inside wheelsprocket : 

![IMG_4771_S|375x500](upload://bhPLulETDxTvNp61dl0F3P5FWPy.jpg)

Two guys on the french forum killed motor axle this way.

I fixed that adjusting the chain so that it is loose enough to make room for two stones stuck in the wheelsprocket.



In the end, I prefer gears. I have E-TOXX first version of DirectDrive. It's already really good, and the new version with smaller gearboxes will be even better.

Noise is not a problem. I don't feel vibration with gears, but I only use it with a mountainboard.

In my experience gears are more compact. typically have smaller center to center distances than chain.

And since the tooth size is smaller for gears there's less nonlinear energy transfer for smaller gears. A 9 tooth sprocket would start to have issues with vibrations.

When free spinning, a small sprocket will yank back and forth on opposite sides of the chain when maintaining a speed. This is because as the tooth count decreases the "roundness" of the sprocket becomes more and more granular. It's really a regular 9 sides polygon, not sacircle. Something like 7 teeth would be completely unusable, but a gear of similar diameter but greater tooth count would be acceptable.

You also get overlapping diameters with a gear and need clearance between sprockets in chain. That just decreases C2C more.

And a shorter C2C means your motor mounts can be lighter and not as thick, due to a shorter lever arm.


On a separate note, gears and chain try and bend the motor mounts on opposite directions. A chain drive will pull the motors out away from your board under load, while a gear will push the motors together. Just handy to keep in mind if anyone's designing a mount.

@slick : I didn't try "protected" chain drive. I prefer the gearbox because with the chains while I'm riding I keep being concerned by stones getting stuck in the wheel sprocket.

Il like the way the mounts can not touch the ground when falling. More compact.

honestly, I really don¬¥t mind the sound of my chains...it¬¥s reminiscent of a turbine when im accelerating and it¬¥s relatively quiet when i¬¥m coasting. i¬¥m sure gearing ratios also have an impact on the sound beeing emmited from the drive train.

what¬¥s really bothering is the sound resonating from the board and enclosure itself on my build. its low pitched and low enough to get those dogs attention. a few days ago a dog tried to bite my board. stupid mutt got lucky it didnt put its nose into the chain drive.

I think hubs are really reliable, but the real drawback to me is the lack of a full urethane wheel. If you ride rough roads, you want that full 97mm+ 74A wheel absorbing the bumps. Also if you want really high speeds and power hubs won‚Äôt cut it because the motors are smaller. I am talking about 40+ mph and super steep hills though. IMO hubs are the best choice for many riders especially if weight and ease of use is a concern.

Acoustically they are similar.

dude thats some serious chain wave you have there. I dont remember how that phenomenon is called where a slack chain forms a wave at high linear speeds due to momentum.

Where are your idler sprockets

Personally I say gears are superior to all.

ok...so ive been reading on the potential hazards of a loose chain.

 **heads up chain users**
a loose chain can potentialy lead to a blockage and cause your wheel to lock = face to ground.

make sure that your chain does not get too loose. use mounts where the tension is **not** adjusted by sliding the motor back and forth. use the appropriate chain length according to your mount.

Exactly, just like I did ;) :+1: and never get a blockage so far. 
Sometimes trying and practicing is far better than just read what one guy thinks to be exact (... IMO)
The thing is to not get it **too** loose! It works perfectly well from and for many years and will continue for a long long loonnng time!!

i¬¥m in 100% agreement with you. 

my formulation was not precise enough. **a too loose chain is a potential hazard** - just like in any drive train, the correct adjustment of your drive train is important for your setups integrity.

:+1:

yeah...whip ¬¥em with dem chains!

*edit*

btw. stop posting eMTBs vids, youre killing me.:rofl: with each vid i see - i feel the need to get an eMTB for myself

I have been  using a chain for 8years  with out
Problems my friend has replaced his belt 
A few times the only bad with chain you have to 
Clean it often but we clean our hands at least
6 times  a day so that's not a problem

I just added more grease last time I opened just because I didn't used enough previous time :)

and going to open today after yesterday emergency braking from 35mph to 0 with (-100A bat on motor) to see if all gears are OK :D

No reason why a chain can't be enclosed...
Dutch bikes have chain enclosures.

just spray wd40 and it will clean itself if its very dirty, and if not just add regular oil it doesnt need to be shiny :D

Not all chains are created equal, the same that there are differences in gearing implementations. Does the type of chain increases or decreases some comparative advantages? (Maybe there's a dedicated topic for that)
25H/04C vs 06B? Bigger is obviously heavier, and more limiting in terms of gearing ratio (about 3:1 max on 105mm wheels). Is the bigger chain less, or more likely to jam with the average pebble? Does the small chain ever breaks due to excessive load?
