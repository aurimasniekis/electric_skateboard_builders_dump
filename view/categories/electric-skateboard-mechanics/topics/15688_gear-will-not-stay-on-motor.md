Torque boards kegel 16T/36T small gear will not stay no my 192kv sk3 turnigy motor I have tried blue lock tight and then red and neither of them worked after a ride of 15-20 min the gear will come lose which makes the motor not spin the wheel. The hex screws are starting to strip and I do not want to cause any more damage any solutions.

High Tolerences help also ,.. i once bought a Motor gear but it's bore hole measured over  8.1mm
and returned it, some companies have High standard Tolerances and thus a much more precise fit

For recommendation. Use blue Loctite and give it a few hours for the stuff to setup. I'd give it a day for it to cure. Green is not okay to long use. Blue is fine, but red will take the most to remove.

638 isn't "green loctite" it's a pulley retaining compound.

Had the same problem, made a flatspot and grub screw, never had the problem since.
