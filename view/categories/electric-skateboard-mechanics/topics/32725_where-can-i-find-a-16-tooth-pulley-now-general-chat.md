So Im really short on money and time, and can't find a 16t motor pulley. Ebay maybe? I would probably ask this this on general chat, but, RIP. Someone should make a "General Discussion Thread" To replace it in the time since. Anyway, help!

Are you UK based? If so you could get one from Belting online.
