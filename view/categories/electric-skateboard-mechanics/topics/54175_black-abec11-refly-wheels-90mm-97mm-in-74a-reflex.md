I just noticed these but haven't heard about them anywhere.  Has anyone tried these?

I saw one company that had black flywheels that had the super man logo on it so I guess it would be the superflys

Yes, those are [SuperFly](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-superflywheel-pre-order-129-99/51056), but as far as I know, the SuperFly have always been "reflex" formula.  These are the first regular Flywheels I've seen in reflex formula.  Please correct me if I'm wrong

Some ABEC11 107mm wheels are SuperFly.  There are also Electric Flywheels which are not SuperFly

At Abec 11 we've formulated a variety of hard and soft urethane formulas but the two most popular SOFT urethanes are our Classic and Reflex formulas. Both are very high in rebound and therefore are very fast. The Classic formula is typically chosen when you want a smooth and predictable slide like in freeriding, thrashing, and on technical downhill courses. The Reflex formula is used when you want a higher level of traction and/or greater longevity. It has hard carving applications in downhill, slalom, as does very well on electric skateboards.

We've had great success with 74a, 77a, and 80a durometers. For electric skateboards most people want a LOT of really soft smooth urethane and so they get big Flywheels in 74a.

Currently all 107mm Flywheels are "SuperFly's" which means that although they are wider to the outside than our 83mm, 90mm, and 97mm Flywheels, they are the same width on the inside as the others and are therefore 100% compatible with all of the wheel pulleys designed for Flywheels. We are not currently making the original 107mm Electric Flywheels because very few electric skateboard vendors other than Altered made trucks and wheel pulleys that are compatible with the inside edge of the wheel.

Later this year we will be adding 97mm and 90mm SuperFly's (wider to the outside) and an 83mm BigZig HD offering with an integrated pulley on a smaller core which has a TON of urethane for such a (relatively) short wheel.

BigZig 83mm with more urethane due to integrated pulley sounds perfect for small cruisers! Any pics or details about the product ? 15mm wide  pulley I hope, and 38t or 36t would be nice. HTD5 ofc.

A Centrax HD version would be problematic in that the wheels would be so wide on the inside that you'd need an extra wide hanger and/or narrower belts to fit them on a deck and still have room for two motors ...

It may not be caused completely by reports, but more caused by empirical experiences of not being able to buy wheels...

Oh yeah, I've heard the liquid trucks are getting redesigned so whats up with those? Any eta or teasers on what to expect?

And how long you gonna keep us waiting on the 90mm and 97 superflys? 107mm are awesome but a bit unwieldy. :slightly_smiling_face:

Oh, so they're not wider like the super flys? :frowning_face:

Hope they are at least noticeably softer than the classic or I just wasted $90

I have put a lot of time on the 90 and 97 classic thane versions so I really wanted to try these and I was begging Chris to release them for a while, I'm really glad he did and I hope they keep popping up on the market, thanks Chris! 

I finally got a chance to try the 97mm version and they are just what I thought, a fine upgrade to the classics, perfect for electric skateboarding. I still want to try the 90mm they will have more torque and better suit my long range needs. I also have some Boas coming to try out and compare them too.

I got a set of these 90mm Abec 11 Refly wheels. They are awesome. They go faster than the Kegel 80mm but feel much safer at speed. I used to have the 70mm zig zags in Reflex Thane for downhill. Very grippy. These 90mm have great rolling momentum. I found some online for you all.

the 97mm versions are going for 110 on evolves website. So glad I picked up a set when they were 85 at warehouse skateboards.

Still unused because I didn't get the right belt length for a new 38t pulley... all those online belt length calculators are horribly inaccurate :sleeping:

I purchased a set of Black ABEC11 ReFly wheels 90mm “74A reflex” & they are nothing short of amazing!  Plus, they look nice on my board.

Great rebound, good stickiness.  Put about 50 miles on them so far, no chips/dings after minimal bad roads.  I could really tell the comfort difference from other wheels.  However, I've not had less than 78a before, so it is my first uber soft wheel.  As far as a performance wheel, I'm not sure I could weigh in on that yet.  I Haven't done enough testing.  

I just wish they weren't so hard to find & that the abec11 website would work.![20181031_155217|281x500](upload://gQtEc5KlwgRVan0M8SmKVAQZsqX.jpeg)
