Looking for a skid plate to bolt on that will protect my motors. Ideally it would bolt on to the trucks or something like that. Anything out there, or do i need to fabricate it myself?

I can help design a skid plate if needed. I may also be able to fabricate is via Laser Cutting/SLA Printing.  I don't have full access to a metal working shop though.

@KMeyerson I'm modeling my board right now in sketchup to get a rough idea of what i want. If it wouldn't be too expensive i'd certainly take you up on the fabrication offer as i have no way to cut or work with metal myself.

If anyone can give exact measurements of @torqueboards v4 mount that'd be awesome. I have the mount myself but my measurements are far from great. If anyone already has a model of the 50mm motors we use that'd help too!
