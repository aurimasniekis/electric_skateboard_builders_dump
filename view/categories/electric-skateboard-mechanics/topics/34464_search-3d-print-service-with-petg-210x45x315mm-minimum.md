Hello,
I am Pjotr from Belgium. I search a 3d print service for my enclosures. The enclosure must print in black PETG.

I could do it but shipping from the states to belgium would be killer. Do you have 3dHubs where you live?

If you can print the shipping label on your end with that membership you will save a lot of money. When shipping out of the states it goes by size and weight so the size of the box would drastically increase the price. But in Europe/Asia it’s only weight. So if you can print a weight only mailing label I can slap it on a box and send it to Belgium

I go see how its works. I don't have experience with shipping world wide... How much will be the cost for printing?
