[Speed wobble][1] is real, and terrible. I experienced it for the first time a few weeks ago. I was enjoying a ride on [my new build][2], casually coasting around and carving at about 12 MPH. I was in an empty parking lot and thought to myself "let's see how she handles at a higher speed." Three seconds later I'm in a heap on the ground, scuffed, scratched, and thankfully not seriously injured, but I could have been! 

I experienced speed wobble, shown in the image below from [this page][3] <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/a148f31ea12cf761c8d8cdfa6b1d3229f2160e42.jpg" width="362" height="215">


In my case, I had left my trucks on the loose side so that I could turn easily; too loose for the crazy acceleration my build is capable of. The board piked underneath me, [this video demonstrates][4] the phenomena  well.

@onloop s[hared this post a while back about a dampened truck][5], which seems perfect for esk8. We're in a weird category where sometimes we want to ride in highly trafficked areas and need to turn "on a dime," but then other times we need the stability of a rigid truck\bushing config to stay stable at high speeds and faster-than-typical-for-skateboarding acceleration. 

After lots of reading, I'm not convinced that it is purely rider ability that causes it in our application; the acceleration we achieve is faster than what downhill riders experience, so the "warnings" of speed wobble aren't as evident, and come too late in my experience. A system that identifies high acceleration and automatically stiffens the bushings would be an ideal solution.

Until then, how do you all minimize speed wobble? I've got a completely new bushing setup now, but I don't think it totally solved the problem.

With my adjustable g-bomb brackets I can run my back truck at 15 degrees and my front at 60, which helps a great deal for speed wobbles. Ran both at 60 degrees once and went down a hill and even with experience stabilizing the board with my feet I was put into a nasty wobble and had to jump off. Same hill same bushings and my back truck set at 15 degrees, no problems. These days I run a slightly stiffer bushing in the front as well to help when I'm really sailing.

Double barrel bushings help or those bigger ones venom makes (dh eliminators). Cones are speed wobble hell imo. If i want a better turn i still run barrels but add a softer bushing street side of the truck. Works for me on hills but i have no experience on eboard. bushings are cheap. You should try a bunch of different shapes and hardness.

I agree. Cones are slalom heaven and downhill hell. The best way to limit the threat is to run 10 to 15 degrees less angle on your rear truck. (either by means of different base plate or wedge). To eliminate speed wobble you could run a 0 degree truck on the rear. It would lean so the front truck could do it's thing, but the rear truck wouldn't turn. And you will have a high speed board that turns on a dime only when going 60mph.
Remaining calm in the event of a wobble will help tons too! If you can weight one side of the board for a second or two usually you can kill the wobble.

double barrels and a kick tail. Less wobble, more dime-turning. 

Keeping your battery pack closer to the rear of the deck makes this easier, but you'll use more wire running the phase leads from the front past the battery and out to the motors, since you will have to put the ESC up front because its lighter. This isn't something I've done yet, but for my next build I think i'm going to try it. 


I can spin my 18 pound 40" YOFACE around a hard right at a decent speed. Hard lefts too, although my back faces the turn going that direction which makes me feel like i'm falling, but i'm getting much more comfortable with it.

speed wobbles are real. yes no doubt.
but there's a lot to be said for practice and training.

a bit of body weight distribution goes a long way. 
I like to ride my trucks loose. yeah sure tight trucks are more stable but the extra work you put in with loose trucks builds your muscles and balance so that you can have the best of both worlds. tight slow speed turns and controlled carving.
I always ride as loose as I can without wheel bite.
after a week or so you will be hitting those high speeds without wobbles just from your own core strength. knowing where to put your weight and how make micro adjustments to stop the wobbles comes with practice.
but then again...
you could be the guy up front chugging a beer.... or the other guy...

Wow thanks for all of the good advice @Wanderer @kai @psychotiller @longhairedboy @lowGuido !

I've changed my bushing configuration again; double barrel venoms with 90a boardside and 83a roadside. The softer roadside barrel allows decent turning but seems way more stable than the cones. I miss the extra turning radius of the cones, but it seems like a good compromise.

I'm now experimenting with kingpin nut tightness. How tight is "standard" tightness? Until the bushing is slightly engaged\compressed? Even more than that? I'm measuring by how many threads of the kingpin are exposed, but of course that's not a universal way to measure. Thanks to you guys, I'm also looking into wedges to alter the truck angle. Although I'll note that I'm not interested in exceeding 15-18mph, if that. 

Most of my riding is chilled-out carving at 10-12 mph. Is altering truck degree for these speeds overkill? I think that my crash was due to my trucks being all-the-way loose. The default bushings in the Paris trucks were so stiff that I backed the kingpin nut way off; there was no almost bushing compression to keep things stable. The pneumatic wheels I'm running, for all their benefits, definitely aren't as nimble as regular wheels. I can see why Evolve uses Gullwing-clone trucks that have 2 kingpins and 4 bushings each.

In my initial post. I should have noted that I've experienced speed wobble a lot in the past on a regular skateboard (non-electric and 'thane wheels), it just never tossed me off of a board! All of my past skating was at lowish speeds, and when wobble happened it felt like there was plenty of time to correct it. This is where eks8 wobble seems unique; acceleration is rapid and there might not be enough time for an intermediate rider to identify it.

@emotiva you might be interested in this since we're using the same wheels.

Ha! Thats about what i use for my dance set up. Well evolve boards are slow to my understanding( i may be wrong i know they got lots of different boards. I also thought gullwing trucks were made for hard carving and pumping. I wouldnt use gullwing trucks for anything with speed. I prefer carver trucks for carving and pumping personally since they are pretty much self propelled. If you like surfing check out carver surf skate boards. I have a lot of fun with mine for flat ground. They are totally speed wobble hell with the swiveling trucks.
I think changing the angle of the trucks is overkill at those speeds. I can kick a longboard 12mph lol. I engage the bushing but  never tighten it down. If you have to tighten your bushing down so it is squished ...  it is over tightened and you should use a harder bushing. Just my opinion.

Thanks @kai you're right that we can kick to 12 mph ha! I might be underestimating speed; I've been basing it on my ability to hop off the board and run it out if needed (I know my sprinting pace); so not an accurate measurement at all! I completely agree about the kingpin but tightness; I tighten just enough to see that the bushing is engaged.

[/quote]

@longhairedboy really? That's great to know! But wouldn't the number of threads showing vary based on the height of the bushing (which I assume is variable) and the length of the kingpin? (which I also assume is variable) Hope I'm not interpreting this too literally :)

P.S. You can go that fast because at least some part of you build is red, which is 20% faster!

The Kingpin Thread unit is sort of like tons i would imagine. You have long tons, tonnes (metric), and short tons. lol

What good would it be without ridiculous complications?

Also, its true about the red. When my board just had the default bustin graphic, I was only able to achieve a mere 27.8 mph peak. I didn't hit 31.3 until i had added 20% more power by painting the whole thing red. In fact its possible that the all the varied colors of the electronics inside the box are what's really slowing me down at this point, so i should probably just dip the whole thing in red, motors and all.

I do like your 2 thread unit.
i do about the same. and if I want tighter I get a harder bushing.
I hate seeing 5mm of thread sticking out the top of a truck.. its just an astetics thing I know, but I'm a little bit OCD about things like that.

You could always turn the kingpin over so that the nut is inside the baseplate. Then, no matter what, it will always be just the head of the kingpin to tighten.

I remember the gunmetal trucks came like this. They even had a little revolver cylinder stamped on the head. I hope someday Caliber and friends make up and they reincorporate the design into the Caliber trucks.

On Calibers it makes it a little easier to switch out bushings by reversing the bolt. No need to remove the truck.

On my personal boards I use a hard bushing boardside on my rear truck only, the rest I leave soft. When not carving the hard bushing helps lock in the rear truck and you still get good carving when you need it from the soft bushings.

Update: I'm using Venom 81a double-barrel bushing boardside and roadside now, using the **two-thread tightness standard** scientifically substantiated by @longhairedboy and @lowGuido.  

I have the top speed limited to 16 MPH through VESC's "soft RPM limit" feature and I've clocked that speed regularly with a speedometer on a smartphone.   Most of my riding is on sidewalks and dense complicated areas, so average speed is 8-10 MPH, and then I can open up a bit on when there are some long and unobstructed stretches of road.

I switched to softer bushings when the temperatures dropped here about a month ago... in the cold the bushings get stiff. Not sure how these will perform in the summer.

Does anyone use the ["almost precision" packs that have fancy washer kits for bushings?][1] There seems to be a potential value in having all of the bushing in contact with a machined washer, as opposed to just the inner 2/3 using a standard washer. Overkill though?

Hi, when my LecDec longboard arrived it had the rear truck very tight, almost no turn when using my arms to move it. On the other side, the front truck was very loose, no kingpin thread visible.

I used this configuration for some time and tried different settings. Currently the back truck is a little more loose than originaly and the front truck a little more tight than originaly.

I like to carve around and sometimes try the speed of my longboard and I think I found a good compromise between the two for the time being.

What are your truck settings to avoid speed wooble? Symmetrical tightness settings between front and rear or different like used for downhill?

@sismeiro I think you'll get the most benefit from trying different bushings; try different shapes and different durometers until you dial in exactly how you want it to feel. As others mention on this thread; altering the bushings (and in more advanced scenarios the truck angle) are the way to fine-tune. Just tightening (or loosening) the stock bushings won't get you very far.

In general; higher durometers = more stability at the cost of responsive turning.

Speed wobbles are due to a lack of balance by the rider.
For regular style riding, the best thing you can do to avoid speed wobbles is to ride with your knees
bent. I haven't had speed wobbles in 20 years, and my trucks are so loose they are about to fall off, and I go down big fat nasty hills.

Ive been reading through all the 'speed wobble' topics with interest as I came off at 25mph last month and my grade 3 AC Joint separation is only now beginning to mend. 

I have standard Caliber 2 trucks and Ive just bought these bushings. Do you think they'll make a difference? I bought 94a. I think the Calibers come with 89a standard. Also, really interested in what @psychotiller was saying about the angle of the base plate! I skated street for years but never fast. Im sure experience at speeds will develop but I really dont wana come off again like I did last month. Been a real pain in the ass (shoulder) over Xmas.

@cliofreak are you running the same angle baseplate front and rear? Esk8 are directional so it's best to dewedge the rear some for a lower angle. This way the front and rear trucks can't oscillate off of one another.

 Basically what @MoeStooge said... Remove steering from the rear :)

I´m still running standard black Calibers with standard red bushings (barrel and cone), front and back both equally tightened down to about 3 threads of visible kingpin.
Running a Truncated Tesseract, i have a nice turning radius but i start feeling small wobbles at about 40 km/h. The faster you go, the harder you have to suppress the wobbles, but i agree, it´s just a bit training and experience that you know when your board starts wobbeling.
I think i´m going to try barrel/barrel soon..

Looks like you have +6 up front and -6 in the back 

On 50 baseplates this would be 56/44

This is fine but I'd prefer a 50/44 split...so maybe remove the front wedge to bring the turnyness down just a hair

I feel like taming squirrely handling and wobbles is mainly rider skill and eliminating slop in bushings and pivot cups.

Regular longboarders have zero problems going 60mph on loose 50 degree trucks. Like really crappy trucks.

Messing with baseplate angles is totally unnesecary but if you like the way it steers go for it.

Those "almost precision" packs on muirskate are awesome. Quality urethane pivot cups (not the crap rubber that comes stock) and precision sleeved washers make a world of difference.

And steering dampers? Really? Lets not get crazy here, its not like we all go more than 40mph often.

As @zpoole27 said it's mostly rider skill. But wedgibg can help

As well down hill boards are typically split setups(different angles) and are directional like our esk8 ie a split setup like 50/44 will be nice and turn with a stable rear. 

Freeride setups are typically same angle front and back as you end up riding switch alot. 35/35, 42/42, 44/44, 50/50 are Freeride setups.

```
While Gravity and Esk8 both share some of the same fundamentals and setup characteristics, the drive system weight and rotational torque(accel and deceleration) are applied forces that change handling characteristics between the two.  A light weight axel ( less unsprung weight) is easier to recover from speed wobble than weighted axel under rotational torque.  On a rear drive setup my experience has been the more rear steer and axel play is reduced  the more stability is created. Yes rider skill is a big factor.

Just watch a few vids explaining the benefit of the front being higher degree. Makes sense.

You want less rear steering / un equal steering to prevent oscillations building, which is what speed wobbles are. 

Im weird I run 55/55 with wedges. But I have harder rear bushings and tighter rear truck so that reduces rear steer a bit. Also I run barrel / barrel which helps too. It more wants to go strait than turn.

Wow, OP, exactly same thing happened to me just a couple weeks ago. Wounds are almost healed, but still sensitive. I immediately took out cheap bushings and replaced with quality ones that are shortest, took out the shock pad, and dewedged. It's much better now stability wise. Now the turning lies mainly on the front trucks. This is where a double king pin truck is perfect cuz in slow speed it can turn sharp angles but still stable at speed with a super stiff bushings. My current WB is about 22".

Sorry to resurrect an old thread but...
Looking at getting a set of Ollin motor mounts with Ronin trucks. The question is- I was wondering whether to get both trucks as standard (42.5 degree base plate) or getting a set with the rear base plate reduced to a 25 degree angle which should add some stability at speed?

I’m gonna be topping out at about 35/40 so not crazy fast. 
Any thoughts appreciated. Thx

To reduce speed wobble at speed and still be able to make decent turns i wedged the front and dewedged the rear both by about 6 degrees. In the rear I put a riptide 90a aps chubby boardside and a 85a standard paris barrel roadside. My front truck is a caliber II 50 degree and i kept the stock bushings in that one. 

Also, i run a topmount. For even more stability you could go for a dropthrough.

I was having a dandy chat with my homies riding the other day. I'm just going to share a couple of my thoughts here. Because I've had the opportunity to street face more times on electric boards, then I have in the past couple years of DH skating.

When Downhilling - or at zero throttle coasting down hill on esk8
- I can center myself over the deck, driving the trucks straight with authority
- when a wobble is felt, I pick a rail, heelside or toeside and force a turn.

This sounds normal and all right? But we have rear wheel drive. I tested a symmetrical setup the other day, with the phases flipped so that it was FWD. FWD was alot like the above DH and no load coasting explainations...

So what makes rear wheel drive different? It's hard to explain, but the simplest words I can think of are torque vectoring. Basically a mix of truck slop and power from the wheels.

What I've found is, basically with maximum torque (full throttle), accelerating straight, eventually causes these micro shimmys that form a frequency and build into a nice oscillating wobble. As the wobble starts in the back.

What feels different then analog, is in order to accelerate without the shimmy, I basically have to hold a rail(with my weight) and be in a perpetual slight carve/turn. Keeping pressure on a rail, and then switching rail pressure at a carve arc your body is comfortable with keeps the board from starting it's own oscillation under extreme acceleration as if you were going straight.

The odd and interesting part is with FWD you don't get this, because you have more leverage over the front, and the back isn't trying to act on it's own, because it is torque deficient...

Just some food for thought...

all with you bro, the board/deck/trucks are a spring, rwd loads it. it has to unload at some point. fwd more closely mimics falling down a hill by gravity.

Yea it's super weird... But holding a slight carve/turn/lean under acceleration, those shimmys are non existent. It really does feel like a spring if you try to accelerate straight under WOT.  

I'm really temped to build a FWD Falcon, it's really peaked my interest, now that my body is starting to get alot better "feel" of what's happening with the torque being applied on esk8 vs DH... It's one of those things where you have done something so many times your body starts to "feel" the mechanics.. kinda like Randy Mullen explaining doing a trick he's done 4000 times. Your body feels the individual movements behind the trick, vs just one assembled movement(the trick).

I'd like to add a note here as well. I think that _slop_ in your trucks plays a large part in the start of speed wobbles. Any slop that's present in your setup can be the initiating factor that triggers the micro-turn you never intended that can inevitably send you into a wobble. Spherical bearings, or inserts that close the gap between your kingpin and hangar like a spherical bearing would are great for this. Replacing loose pivot cups. A queenpin like on ronin's. Well meshed, good fitting bushings that are snug in your hangars bushing cutouts. These are all good ways to reduce slop.

People mention dampeners: for an experienced rider, your legs should play this role of a dampener. I always say, wet noodle... Al-dente... And you got the right idea. Since wobbles compound from weight on the rear, I always lean forward if I feel any instability... Not turn (just haven't tried it...). Leaning forward acts like de-wedging the rear truck _in a way._ By taking weight off the rear truck and onto the front truck, you end up turning more from the front and less from the back obviously (almost like having a dewedged rear truck). This is why when I am going fast I always tend to weight the front truck significantly more than the rear, and I never get wobbles. This might be partly due to my bushing setup as well. A fun personal note on weighting, everytime I see a newer rider get the wobbles, their first reaction is usually to tense up (tense bad, wet noodle and relax good), lock their knees standing up straight (again bad, you need to absorb and dampen the wobbles with your noodle legs by bending your knees and relaxing, and keep low- getting taller just gives more momentum to your wobbliness), and they lean backwards onto the rear truck out of fear of going faster or something (also very bad, wobbles tend to almost always originate from a bad rear setup or more weight on the rear truck). Inevitably, they always go down when they do these things: stand up tall, tense up, and lean back- this is the opposite of what you want to do.

Practice what @Deckoz suggested, keep a mild turn going, that way it makes sense you have less chance of getting into that oscillation from one side to another. **Relax.** Keep your legs loose and ride it out. Don't fear going faster unless you are barrelling into a car and stay leaning forward for the most part, and don't stand up straight. Your body should stay still over where your board should be and when your board gets out of control, let your legs make up the difference between where the board is and where it should be while your body hovers still, all by keeping your legs in that noodle state. Focus forward, not on the board. As long as you don't push your limits too hard, get used to going a little faster with good protection on (knee pads, slide gloves, retracting remote, helmet) so you can confidently bail on your hands and knees when practicing feeling out the wobbles and becoming comfortable with them. You need to know how to feel them out in a pinch, because they always happen in a pinch so get used to them in a controlled environment when you are conscious of it. 

For bushings, I run a set of low rebound, fat barrels, with a lower rebound ultra fat barrel boardside. This acts also as a dampener from wobbles originating at the rear truck. I run the front relatively loose with high rebound to accentuate the offset in turning and feel, which for me improves manuverability and stability while maintaining that reboundy turning feeling. Setting up your rear truck with a slight 1-2 degree dewedge even can help substantially enough to mean no more wobbles. Even running shorter barrels boardside can act as a mild de-wedge in a pinch, but can throw your trucks natural geometry off introducing slop if you haven't implemented other means (spherical bearings/inserts) to deal with that slop- Wedge risers are best. Side note, don't tighten your bushings down so much that they are puffing out... Get harder bushings at that point. They should be tightened down enough to not deform, but stay solidly in place.

I ride front wheel drive and never had a wobble. It also just feels a lot nicer to me.  Maybe it's not true but could make sense that front wheel drive would have less wobbles. With the more turnable truck being heavier I think it holds it more stable

Yea. But the motors I feel slowly amplify this when in the rear, especially under heavy acceleration.

[quote="Hummie, post:58, topic:389"]

Maybe, but normally the front is reactive to the road and you get micro jiggles, while the rear stays stable. I think it's the mix of the micro jiggles you normally absorb with the front, mixed with the torque vectoring of the rear(wheels trying to stay at the same throttle rpm) that the two jiggling together form a wobble. Where the front wheel drive, the front jiggles with the road like a normal analog board.. but the rear stays dead. 

Just what I think I'm feeling

Agreed. I've never had this be the cause for me, but conceptually I 100% agree and see how this could happen.

I remember last time with this discussion I think someone said you can still get wobbles in the motor driven Wheels. I don't know for sure but it seems strange for a very precisely controlled motor and wheel to be getting influences enough to make a wobble. I think Motors on the loose truck stabilizes them

What do you think about this...

A 6374 in rear with extended shaft and 1 way beatings. Either dual 50mm or hubs (hummie/carvons) in front. This would leave acceleration at both front and rear, brakes at front and majority of torque at the rear. 

Ollin did something like this ice, but dropped it do some reason?  I was intrigued but never really tried it. I might now. Thainwill require 3 bescs but I think it wouldn't increase battery consumption much and should run cooler than a dual rear setup.

I think that under hard acceleration your average noob, I include myself, weights the rear truck accidentally as they are left behind by the board due to inertia.... 

I found if I feather the brakes quickly enough the braking takes my weight off the rear trucks and any wobbles vanish.

On another note it’s all a bit academic as I haven’t had speed wobbles for a couple of months now just because I’m more relaxed on the board... (Watch for my next post of a horrific speed wobble crash to follow shortly!!!)

**Bend your knees,**
**so much that it feels like it's too much.**

that the best way to avoid and cure speed wobbles. 

**Lower your center of gravity.**

A bushing has the "normal" tightness when you can't turn the bushing easily with two fingers. And in my opinion kai is right tighten the kingpin is a transitional solution, fine to try out but if you like to squish your bushing you should buy harder ones.
