Been a while since i got my Surfrodz RKP Trucks and just let them sit in the box, kinda lazy to make the mounting, coz R&D always make me spent more $$$ üòÖ. Then, @lrdesigns comes with his nice press fit mount that compatible with Marc mounting plates, i don't have Marc mount and it just not what i'm looking for, the size & etc, but thank you for the shared files, great design, make me cut some times studying the SR trucks ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôè

Now i'm making my own mounting plates with @lrdesigns press fit mount idea with adjustment in some dimensions to fit my plates and pulley setup.
![image|690x388](upload://1Kk27T3ByEPHMXTxYThcrodE0i4.jpeg) 

The mounting plates design idea is slip-on to the press fit mount.

Machining is on progress at the moment

Really cool looking motor plates! :metal: The idea of fixed or adjustable angle is cool. 

Are the plates backwards compatible with my mounts just with less angle holes?

I only just found this thread as when you @ me its wrong because it's LRdesigns not iRdesigns. Agh wish I could change my user name to LRdesigns instead of lrdesigns so its not ambiguous.

Aaahh it's L thats why i can not tagging you üòÖ.

About the press fit it, i make them smaller about 51.5(diameter), the plate at 55 wide. At first i want to make them fit to your press fit mount but it'll need to be wider for slip-on type and i think 55 is the wider i should go for better clearance. At the moment i'm thinking to make the press fit shorter so it wont covered the hanger thread hole, what u think?

Yes plz!! The only improvement that could be made on @LEFTRIGHTDESIGNS' design is the distance between motor plates internally. With psycholovers design, there's 196mm between inner mount points. That means dual 6880 is like a solid 12Kg away from each other. Metric system skills, heard. Glad to be a part of you, world

@PatRocks It will be no problem using 2x6880 with this mounts n plates at wright angle. My only concern rite now, i can not use the axle lock insert, it covered by the press fit, thats why i'll make another short version of press fit mount to try.

Mine have 168 between motors not sure why you need more than 8mm between two 6880 motors? Unles sensors or LED‚Äôs or furrr. 
 
Or you just like WIDE, then that‚Äôs fine. üòâ

Or you need 90mm long motors?

Hi guys,
since i got a lot of DM about this mount i‚Äôll make this limited batch only for 10sets (5 dual setup), so if you want it, you can DM me to reserve your place. I‚Äôm not doing pre order for now, just reserve your place. Anyway the upcoming mount will be a bit different in motor holes, but still have same feature, will update soon. And ya i‚Äôll make for TKP also, in the next batch maybe. Price will be around 150$-165$ due to limited and the complexity.

This was my setup üòÅ

Sorry for the small batch guys, the slot is full to @Kellag @Winfly (2) @okp @Eboosted. 

Here‚Äôs the latest design that goes to production
![image|690x388](upload://klfIoNeAV8qXAFFq4eVKtcfHq4r.jpeg)  
As you can see i made adjustment on motor mounting position and angle.

Actually, i also made the TKP version for me to test, but I don‚Äôt have the trucks at the moment, so the press fit still untested, but i think it‚Äôll fit just fine.

I think its still holding fine, you can use the adjutable dist, or still using the fix dist with 3 bolt. You can modified by your self like that if you like. 7075 is strong enough.

Looks like you'll get Sofus, yours and possibly kellags sets to your location.  You think it would be worth having mine sent to you and then forwarded to me out here in Maryland?

@XTLA the problem with a press fit tkp adaptor is that the tolerance on the hanger isn't great. Meaning that it will be loose on some trucks. Just a warning

Actually i‚Äôm not sure why they make that much üòÜ, i also ask the same question. They just said it‚Äôs ok and not charging anything that i didn‚Äôt order. I make two sets of tkp to test since i don‚Äôt have the hanger at the moment, you want?

I see, will test the tkp for sure.

Anyway just a thought that the good things about press fitted is they won‚Äôt go anywhere, i‚Äôm not sure how big the tolerance differences that you said coz i don‚Äôt have the hanger at the moment, but from my experience dealing with casting caliber trucks and make mounting for it, put some rubber heat shrink on the hanger that has some gap will make the mounting stay there forever.

Guys @Eboosted @Winfly @okp @Brianr058 if you had your mounting can you confirm the fit, because brian has it loose on his hanger, i‚Äôve test them on and its for 200mm hanger and its fit. 
https://youtu.be/X8Um6AdDxQM
@Brianr058 can you use caliper to check the wide of your press fit and also your hanger. The press fit is on 18.1mm. I‚Äôll make video about the press fit on my hanger.

It's probably the tolerance of the hangers aren't precise with every truck set

I think different batch has different tolerance, guessing from hanger logo at the pic, mine is on the left.
