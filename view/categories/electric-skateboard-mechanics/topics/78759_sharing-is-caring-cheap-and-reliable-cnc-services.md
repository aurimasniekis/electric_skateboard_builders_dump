Hi guys, Looking for a Chinese manufacturer to pull out some parts for a small project. Quite A few ppl have made/created stuff through a Chinese company and I wonder why ppl don’t share their experiences? There are a ton of companies out there but which one can I trust? Are the parts in spec? Do they actually use the material I am asking for (biggest concern)? Lots of unknowns here ...

I've used star prototyping services before and they provided pretty solid service. Not terribly cheap though.

I've heard about Starrapid before. While asking for some quote I came across http://www.nice-rapidtooling.com which provided me an incredible low quote (30% cheaper than 3dHubs). Then I got a quote from an Australian company which was like 3 times as expensive as 3dHubs.

Hey mate, I’m in Aus and I’m hoping to be getting a mini lathe sometime after Christmas (with a good deal). I’m by far no master but have used lathes a bit at school and if it’s just some basic stuff you need done hit me up and I’ll see if I can help you out.

This goes for other peeps in Aus too

Thanks for the offer but I fear that the parts can't be done on a regular mill or lathe. We got a small lathe (Wabeco) too as well a mill/drill press station.
