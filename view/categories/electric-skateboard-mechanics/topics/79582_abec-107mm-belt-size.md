Hey guys I just bought/received some ABEC 107's and I need to know what size belts I'll need? I current use 15mm/265mm and they work fine for 97mm but definitely aren't long enough for the 107's.
I have 16/36 gearing. Torque Board's says they recommend 40T. I want to stick with what I have atm, wouldn't it work fine? I'd get more torque I think with my current setup?

```
The wheel size won't affect the belt length unless it physically hits the motor pulley.

However if you increase the pulley to 40T you might need a 275-15-5M belt instead of 265-5M-15 and it's possible you may need a 280-5M-15 belt

Depends if your motor as adjusted currently is near the max end of its adjustability or if it's closer to the tight end of its adjustablity with the 16/36 and 265mm belt.

```
Belt lengths are determined by pullys not wheels. 
Going from 97 to 107 will increase top speed and decrease acceleration. 
Going from 36t to 40t wheel pullys will increase acceleration and decrease top speed.

Hey so I haven't put on the 107's yet. But looking at the current clearance with my 16/36 setup and the 265mm belt I'm pretty sure it won't fit...

To be fair, some folks use their board for transportation and if it's their ride to work, they can't just take it apart any time they want to ;-)

If something were to break then they'd be in a bind

I would but I can't fit the pulleys on yet because they are the screw on type and I don't have a drill atm. I guess I can do them by hand but it's going to take a while. I'm actually waiting for some MetroBoard Press fit pulleys, should be here in a couple days.
Anyway here's a pic atm.

Using a drill is worse in my opinion because you can't feel the forces as well and you can't tell when things are going awry and it's more difficult to match tightness

Because it looks like you'll have to move your motors further back so wheels clear motor pullys you might need different belts.

A picture from above would help

Don't use a drill. You'll over compress your wheels.

This picture below has a similar setup to what you want.

107mm wheel, 16/36 gearing, 280mm belt and same motor mount.

![image|666x500](upload://oZyTrueT3xWkVx9b82N2YUM5In5.jpeg)

You can see I have enough clearance, but 280mm is about the maximum you can use for this gearing and motor mount.

Beautiful!
Ok so your saying I need to get 280mm? Or that 265mm will work but will be tight?
Also Just curious what Press fit pulley are you using?
I bought MetroBoard ones that I'm waiting on. What do you think about that or should I return for something else?

Get 275-5M-15 because you can see the 280mm has the motor all the way back at the end of its adjustment range

I am using the modular pulleys from BKB. As for the Metroboard pulleys, I haven't really had any experience with it but I know they are high quality. It's possible you will have to file a few millimeters from your hanger.

I have the Metroboard pulleys, any specific questions just ask.  You will need to [do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6V4nBUFeYk) with regular Caliber2 hangers (but not CaliberE or TB218 or Supercarve hangers)

Don't forget the custom spacers you need with the metroboard pullies also...you need more than just the pulley.

Do you think I should keep the MB pulleys or I could return them and wait until the end of this month and get he modular pulleys for BKB?

The metroboard pulleys aren't bad but I prefer other ones that are insert-style and don't use bolts.  They are fine if that's what you have.

Can you recommend some insert-style ones?
As of now I'm using the Torque Board ones with bolts which I hate....

The Metroboard ones are insert, so are the 3D Servisas ones (@Kug3lis) and the bkb ones (@JLabs ) and I think electricboardsolutions (@e.board_solutions)

Not sure if there are more.  Evolve are, but they aren't metal so they don't count.

I prefer the not-Metroboard ones because the Metroboard ones use 2 bearings -- 1 in the wheel and one in the pulley -- where all the other ones use 3+ -- 2 in the wheel and 1 (or more) in the pulley

But the Metroboard ones work **just fine**.

Yes there are spacers you need.  They should come with them.

![20190102_020826|690x388](upload://2qi4Fu3hxe6SuZDGpZUwzoJapw7.jpeg) 

![20190102_020653|690x388](upload://wMBptoTeYW5YQgJws7Stc9L2SBl.jpeg) 

The spacer is an aluminum washer that's 8mm inner diameter, 10.4mm outer diameter, and 27.5mm thick

I suppose if you had enough skate speed washers you could use about 27 of those instead, all next to one another on the axle.

If the only bearings you have are the ones in your bored  I would go ahead and order a set of Reds. it's always good to have backups.

Stack skate speed washers until they are 27.5mm thick, on each side

truck hanger > 
speed washer > 
skate bearing > 
27.5mm of speed washers > 
pulley > 
wheel > 
skate bearing > 
speed washer > 
nyloc skate nut

So you will probably need to order a pack of 100 of them

Make sure they are about 27.5mm when tightened and there aren't burs on the edges where they compress with the nut and are smaller than 27mm, that will tweak your wheel bearings

Also put vegetable oil all over any place the pulley touches the wheel or it will "creak" and the noise is a tad annoying.  You don't need that at all, and you definitely don't need it for test runs.

I actually emailed them asking about a washer and if they could send me two.
Maybe that was the wrong move?

I actually have two washers from torque boards that are fairly long. I'll try those if that doesn't work then I'm just going to return them and order some from Build Kit Boards.

I don't know of anywhere that sells the correct size.  That's why I'm saying to make it.  If the length is not correct, it won't work at all.  It's so you can tighten the outside wheel bearing in place.

It *has to be* 27.5mm long.  Or a combination that is 27.5mm long.

I would seriously order a bag of 100 skate speed rings for cheap and stack those up on the axle.  Just watch for the bur problem I pointed-out.

That's only the wrong move if they don't want you using their parts on a skate that didn't come from them.  Otherwise, they should just sell them to you and make some money.  Last I heard they loosened up on that, but I'm not sure.

Noisy is not a metric by which I judge esk8.  I judge them by reliability.

That being said, I didn't notice them making noise as long as you use vegetable oil everywhere the pulley touches the wheel hub
