Hi,

Anyone aware of wheels that use the same core as abec 83mm clones? I'm attempting to upgrade my wheels without updating my pullies.

Do you have a photo of the core?  Some have wider spokes and some have narrower spokes

all flywheels and clones use the same core.  varied amounts of urethane results in bigger or smaller wheels

Not true. I have two pairs of clone wheels with different cores, they look similar but can vary in width as b264 mentioned.

Correct, some of the clones have differences and I've had to drill or mod a few of them, while the abex11 wheels work the best without any mods..
