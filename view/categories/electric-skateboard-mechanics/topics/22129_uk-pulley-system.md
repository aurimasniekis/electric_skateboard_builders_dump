Hi guys,

I'm wondering if anyone knows of a good pulley system that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to ship over. I'm liking the HTD-5 parts from alienpowersystem.com but they don't have wheel pulleys (I'm looking to get 83mm flywheels). Does anyone have a link that they know will work and is reputable? Ideally looking to get 15/36 12mm set (5mm pitch)

Thanks,

Youssless

I think Evolve might be your best bet...

also check out protoboards: https://www.proto-boards.com

I use their mount, belts and motor pulley and they are good, for the wheel pulley you should check somewhere else or you could get a 3d printed one (3dhubs/shapeways).

Hey @Youssless I have [15/36 pulleys](http://eskating.eu/product-category/pulleys/) 12mm, [83mm flywheels](http://eskating.eu/product-category/wheels/) too.

You never know @ajaynagra might have some left over from his group buy?

Thanks! Grabbed a pulley system from you. Bit pricey but I'm growing impatient and want to start building ASAP.
