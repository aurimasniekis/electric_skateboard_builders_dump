Hi,

is there any possibility to mount MBS All-Terrain Longboard Wheels ([Link](https://www.amazon.com/MBS-All-Terrain-Longboard-Wheels/dp/B074G95LP5)) on MBS ATS 12 Mountainboard Skate Truck ([Link](https://www.mbs.com/parts/12101-mbs-ats12-truck-system-white-1))? 

If yes, which motor mounts would you recommend me for such setup?

I am new in this and would like to start building my first eboard as soon as possible.

Thank you in advance for help.

You cant mount the wheels to the trucks perfectly.  I don't know about the motor mounts tho, might have to diy them.

You would have to use some crazy bearings. Talk to @flywithgriff, he can prolly help you.

The bearings I have are for mounting MTB hubs to regular skate trucks. 

@tux-scooby you simply need a set of 22x12x7 bearings. @Idea makes motor mounts for these trucks.

Thank you all for answers :grin:

Do you have some recommendation for that set of 22x12x7 bearings?

Hopefully @Idea will see this post :) 

My play is to install single 6374 and skate like that and after some time install the second 6374.

A google search will literally produce hundreds of options. You can message @idea.

@Ryan4181
Sorry for the late reply. I was on holiday.
If you are still interested, I can do for you motor mounts for MBS ATS 12
You want a set with belts and pulleys?

Regards:
Tom

I just spent a week working on MBS ATS trucks to make them fit caliber mounts.  Got it all done and looks great.  Unfortunately anything over 10mph is very unstable...wobbles & jumps.  Might be able to decrease the wobble with better bushing but Im thinking its not a good fit for esk8.

Maybe @duffman has some recommendations to make them more stable? He seemed to like the ATS trucks, IIRC.

I actually have a new set with new custom mounts that fit a lot better, I think they will be fine for a cruiser. Just gotta find time to finish them. Also have to finish the wheel pulleys.

How much for the ATS 12 motor mounts?  Where are you located?  What's the lead time.  Very interested.

Sorry to disturb you guys by waking up a dead thread... Newbie here, but I also understand you appreciate people using the search function rather than just creating a new thread.

Long story short, do anyone of you guys where to get those 22x12x7 bearings?

I'm considering an eboard with ATS 12 trucks with pnuematics, but I'd also think it be nice to be able to switch to longboard wheels as well.

Greetings from Gothenburg!

I didn't find 22*12*7 but found 22*12*5 on https://www.vxb.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=Kit20376&CartID=1 those are so expensive though. $12.95 EACH with 8 of them so 100 bucks just for bearings.

Well that sucks.... I guess switching from AT to street isn't as simple as I thought it'd be.

It is not problem to find them but the price they put on those bearings are high. And you do not know how long they are going to last...

True, I think I'll be better off getting  Caliber trucks. I've read some more and if I've gotten everything correctly I should be able to install @psychotiller six shooters. possibly need to grind down the trucks somewhat for the pulley to fit?
