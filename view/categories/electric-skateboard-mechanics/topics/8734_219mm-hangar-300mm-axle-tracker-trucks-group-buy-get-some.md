so i've just taken off the 107 Abec 11's on our Quinny longboard stroller (http://www.quinny.com/longboardstroller/), to take a look at the trucks, and they have a whopping 300mm axle.

what's interesting is that the baseplate says "tracker fastrack", but on their site, it's only the "dart" which has a wider hangar, and that's stated at 219mm, which is exactly what the hangar on the quinny is...

so, could be fastrack baseplate with dart hangar?

anyways - has anyone seen trucks this wide before? are their any other makes that do that width?
(done quick searches this evening - seems like the Paris 195mm are widest and most easily available)...

Carbon gt has 306mm trucks. Very wide and won't tip over, but the trucks aren't available by themselves.

yea - am wondering whether quinny did a deal with Tracker to make them larger trucks, or whether the dart is in fact the truck that is that long...

that and a welded motor mount, and you're good to go...

So who wants to source some extra wide 200-300mm wide caliber style trucks and put together a group buy? I'd get in on that. :wink:

What kind of hanger profile do Evolve and Boosted have? Can those be sourced and adapted to our needs as is? Or maybe someone can find their factory and have them cast the hangers with a caliber shape? Just thinking out loud. 

@oneafrikan Do it! I'll be the first on the list as long as they aren't stupid expensive, and decent quality.

ok. will think on it. not much time atm for more email, but will figure out a system that makes it easy for me to manage.

i picked up what i think is a Moose drop deck a while back on ebay, super cheap in the end so was an easy punt.
has a super nice shape, big Steadfast wheels, and actually fits my stance nicely.  problem is the trucks were shite.  after a bit of use the front axle was bent (i am heavy, but not that heavy!), and the board wasn't riding true when pushed (like my lush symbian with Sabres).  so i threw them out this weekend. now i'm looking for wider trucks so i can experiement with motor mounts on a drop deck.

so i guess the question is: how do you tell quality? how do we know the clone trucks we're getting are good quality?

```
Afaik RKP is when the kingpin & bushing faces outwards from the centre of the board. So my pintail faces inwards - this would be TKP, whilst the other boards face outwards, which would be RKP?

If my understanding is correct then on the Quinny it's RKP as the kingpin & bushing are facing outwards. 

Dunno abt the 219mm darts - wasn't looking at that. 

If so, what would be the issue though - space for mounting motor?

I called company and they made 2000  Fastrack trucks  for the Quinny !  

None in stock!

For a Rear Double the Dart's will do but they are not RKP.like the Quinny.

You sure the Quinny were not longer than 300mm tip to tip??

I think there is a lot of confusion between Hanger length And Axle length !!

Paris 195mm is the Hanger length, Axle length is around 260mm.

Psychotiller im sure your AXLE LENGTH is more than 200mm, for DR ??

Yes, I have a pair ;-) Bought them from @LEVer in a moment of weakness. Pls don't tell my wife, that was an executive budget decision.  

Now, what to do with them.... Been thinking an urban commuter with a dual diagonal setup, for that snowboard feel.  But could also go DR and make the build a bit neater.... either way, should be fun!

Those are the same pair of trucks and they are the same size. Super weird optical illusion. Look at the measurement of the smaller truck.

If you bought these trucks, you would just need the cup portion of my new mount ($60) which will also work on the paris hanger with light filling.

```
just chiming in - unless you want to use crazy tall dual motors or dual 15mm or all terrain wheels, I would always go for a truck thats is narrow as possible because of grip. 

im not a big fan of boosted and evolve track width at all, because you have noticeably less grip with regular longboard wheels on wide trucks (pneumatics are a different story, they will never slip ever really).

can easily explain the behavior - if your truck had a hangar width of 0, youd run a mono wheel and no matter how hard you lean in: youd always have pretty much the same load and the full grip of the 2 wheels. now you bring the wheels apart and the further you do, the lesser the grip on the outer wheel and the more the inner wheel is overloaded when you are leaning into a turn. 
single strong motor builds will know that phenomenon when the motor driven wheel is outwards, it might break loose. so, carving-hungry single motor users like me should actually look for narrower trucks than the typical ones for improved traction! :sunglasses:

Yup, me too.

The Trackers on my Qiunny are RKP.... so started off talking about those.
Just wondering - does it really matter (TKP vs RKP) if you can mount the motor either side?

## \#53 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2016-09-05T14:33:37.775Z Reads: 200

```
It does make a difference being that TKP trucks offer a a more fluid feeling turn-in. more like being on water the front dives into the turn and the rear washes out of the turn.

RKP trucks are proven to be inherently more stable at higher speeds and turn evenly. They feel closer to leaning in on the edge of your snowboard.

I put a surf rodz rkp on the front and tkp on the back. It feels pretty good. no speed wobbles and a good turning radius with a 36'' deck, with my 42'' deck it feels super stable, but the turning radius got a lot bigger.

Thanks for the trucks and mounts, they are awesome.  The extra set of wide trucks are for a 107mm build where I need even more room for the centerset depth. Will need to use your traditional mounts for that as the cupmounts are not deep enough. What would you recommend as easiest mount that will grip these 200mm trucks on the hanger closer to the kingpin?  Trying to minimize filing, if you have a shim that works with this hangar like the caliber II?

107mm ?    I honestly have no idea how to go about that mount...could you use the cup and then space the Mount from the cup? Without filling those support fins off I'm not sure a clank mount would work.

Think about it. Look at the base plate. One of the hangers is laying on the ruler. One of the hangers is in the air above it.  That one is also closer to the lens. I took the picture. Why would I lie about it ? They are the same size. The important one in the pic is the one that looks smaller. 10.75"!

Hey guys did you find 219mm hanger / 300mm axle trucks? I got some new motors and now need 215mm hanger / 300mm axle trucks. For dual 5065 and 15mm belts. but no idea where to find this. My current hangers are about 205mm 

There motors are 70mm long so I need about 145mm between the motor mounts. Did anyone find a evolve clone truck? How wide are the evolve trucks?
