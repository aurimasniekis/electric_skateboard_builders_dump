Wanted to get some 1/4' risers and my hardware bolts arent long enough because i have a 9ply wood board that's really thick. Any one know were I can buy some long bolts?

The best place I've found...and hard to find...Ace Hardware...they have a big nut and bolt selection...better than Home Depot or lowes ... They had really hard to find stuff on hand and great selection of the normal stuff

McMaster.com.  Not skate specific but you can get any bolt in existence.

i agree with @Michaelinvegas

Ace is the Only place for all hardware. if they dont have it, good chance it dont exist lol. (in terms of hardware)
