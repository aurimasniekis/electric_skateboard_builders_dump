i'm going to drop mount these surfrodz rkp trucks on hummie's deck.

deck is pretty thick due to the cutout and the trucks are a tight fit, but it fits and no clearance issues.  cool.

but i don't like the way the baseplate is just sticking out on top of the deck.

question is, would it be safe to rout out the profile of the baseplate maybe 5mm into the deck?  so it sits inside the top of the deck?  would it compromise the strength in that area?

also, anyone in los angeles that can do this for me?  i have a dremel but suspect it'll be mess if i do it by hand.

I like this look.  Don't hide those beautiful base plates!

I think this is a great idea and should be done for science.
I mounted TKPs dropped on mine but never thought about routing it out.
Perhaps it'll be me who will try it for science?

Fill the holes and route it out at an angle for built-in split angles.

I think it will be fine since the deck is 20mm thick. So taking 5 off makes it the thickness of a regular deck. 

The only thing to watch for is chipping around the edges. 

When I got surf rods I got their support plates. It came with these small ones that could be used to support the bottom. Or getting something custom made.

I don't think it's a good idea. Both CF layers r closer to the top. Top layer and 4th.

just add a chain link steering wheel to it and you are good :sunglasses:  Hope you have a skinny enclosure lol
Looks awesome with those pivot cups hanging out the deck!

Been putting my hummie deck with SR trucks together. 
Hangers hit the deck preventing full turn. 
How you doing on this?

gave up on it, just top mounted.

but you're right, hangars hit, but it was something i was going to live with or maybe cut out wells.

but bigger headache was finding motor clearance, and didn't want to mess up structural integrity by routing motor wells either.

it's turned into this board:

Were you trying to mount forward? 
I'm thinking about taking the dremel and making wells for the hanger. 
Im planning on mounting out the back

inside mounting with dropped will be especially difficult, barely any clearance at all.

i rear mounted but even with psycho's quick80 mount, it doesn't clear the end of the deck.

but routing wells should do it.  i just didn't want to weaken the deck.

@thisguyhere u do know that @marcmt88 makes reverse mounts for SR's right? i have them and i havent had issues w/ drop mounting the SR's it hits a little but i run stiff bushings and still turn pretty sharp. 

im currently running my 218's from TB atm tho or i would take pics

I just finished a build for Mars. It is a hummie deck with Rkp's Drop mounted.  You just have to put wells in the deck so the hanger clears. They only need to be about 1/2" wide/1/4" deep.

anything longer than quick80 I think will flex? its not a mount issue, its more of a deck + mount issue.

yep, I'm running psychos tho and don't wanna get more stuff.

and the psycho mount works rear mounted, I just can't raise it higher without wells.

Just turn until you make the dents and then go get a big round file to make a nice uniform wheel well shape where the dents are.

To be honest, those Surfrodz RKPs look nicer than they ride. I returned mine a while back. Their bushing seat and sidewalls are incredibly restrictive to the point that their turn response is dead compared to other available trucks out there (Caliber IIs, R-IIIs, Arsenals, Paris, **Bears** (which are considered restrictive). I suppose it's a bit too late to turn back now, but hopefully you find more use out of them than me.

You are starting to annoy me my friend.  Starting to think that hiatus you had was for the best.  You don't bomb some guys thread with your negative opinions on stuff he has spent a fortune on.  Keep it to yourself dude.  He doesn't care what you think because he loves them and they work for him.

If it works for you, it works for you. In that, I'm happy if it does work out the way you intended. Just putting out my observations. Just avoid using eliminators or any restrictive bushings on them.

Onto the drama thing, I actually love surfrodz and have 3 sets of their TKPs...

I'm guessing tact is not a word you are familiar with.  You're certainly not familiar with the concept.  The op and anyone else who has this issue have paid good money for this stuff which they want to believe is the best gear they can get and while that is not always true it is just bad form to spout your unfounded opinions.  Just because they weren't your cup of tea does not make them bad.  I know you will probably start saying that your opinions are based on bombing some hill in San Diego and the amount of travel required to slide the board while travelling at much faster speeds than esk8 so I know what I'm talking about kind of stuff but will it actually be relevant to esk8?  Judging by the last effort probably not.  I'm actually starting to wonder if you have a build at all.  

Ps this is not the start of a debate I'm just a little tired of your negativity.  Be a help not a hindrance.

If OP can make the trucks work for him, then good for him. You’re free to look at my other builds and state your likes and dislikes. If there’s something I can learn from criticisms of the design, then I’m all for it.

You come across in your comments as a downhiller trying to relate his experience to esk8.  This works in some respects but in others not so much.  The whole wheel debacle is a good example.  Wheels that work for bombing hills do not necessarily work while powered and used for everyday life.  The truck thing is another good example of not basing your research on downhill skating.  Yes you get to go high speed but you don't have to take into consideration the effects of extreme acceleration on the running gear.
For example;
A 35 to 50' reverse king pin truck will stay stable at very high speed, the lower angle the better but will it be stable going from 0-40 in 3 - 4 seconds?  I can categorically say no it won't.  It will squirrel all over the place until it gets fast.  People who use these sr rkp's notice very stable trucks all through the process.  Do you have a set of rkp surf rodz trucks on a build with 6374 motors and a 12s battery?  Because if you don't then do not comment at all because your opinion will not be based on anything but your opinion. I have a 40 plus board with 218's with proper bushings and it is hard work on full acceleration until you hit full speed.  When you go for a hill you start off really nice and easy but with a 12s beast you hit that shit very fast indeed.  Comment when informed or you just come across as a drama queen.  Thats you did the predator stuff? You seem to be a respected member here and personally I think you got a bit fucked over there tbh so this is me being nice.

I appreciate your outlook on the the unique fundamentals of esk8 design, but I have done plenty of builds and went through the motions of finding that all out as well. You can feel free to PM me, as I’m not interested in cluttering this thread with stuff that doesn’t pertain to the Surfrodz in particular.
