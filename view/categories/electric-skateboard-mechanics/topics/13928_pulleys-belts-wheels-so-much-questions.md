Hey,
I am almost ready with the electronics and now I am planning the mechanics for my first build.

I have good components for the motor and ESC (SK3 6374 and VESC) and no more money for the wheels and deck...
So I want to buy a ready to ride longboard from amazon with 65mm wheels (I know it's not really recommended).

But jeah it's cheap :slight_smile: so would it be possible to do this setup on it?

I hope someone can give me a little advise...


Regards!

If you're asking about getting a cheap complete, here:

34 inch, 65mm wheels: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008EZNXHA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

This isn't the one that I use for my setup. It is a nice cheap complete. The trucks are a bit cheap and squeaky, but when making electric, I am going to use hummies trucks. Also, I would pick up some bones reds for like 10 bucks while you're at it, as the bearings are not that good.

Thanks for the link :) but I don't meant that.
I mean, would the belt pulley wheel combination would work?....
And I am from Germany, I found one board that in the link above 

(Apollo Longboard Matei Special Edition Komplettboard mit High Speed ABEC Kugellagern inkl. Skate T-Tool, Drop Through Freeride Skaten Cruiser Boards https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0154S3DN8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_eHGpybTVN8NV0)

Because I did not find any other build with 65mm wheels, so maybe it is not possible? But idk.


Regards!

Your link is not loading for me, but 65mm wheels are not going to work. Your pulley would be almost as big as the wheel.  You are going to have 3mm of clearance or less.

Also the trucks are almost guaranteed to be poor quality and likely won't fit a standard mount.  If you are that strapped for cash, I recommend you build a decent skateboard (non-electric) and save up for the electric parts. You'd be better off spending your money on burritos and pushing it yourself

@Tuomalar 
What I already have:
-VESC
-SK3 6374 149kv
-9s Lipo

For the board I would spend ~120€ +-50€
(Better - :smile:)
