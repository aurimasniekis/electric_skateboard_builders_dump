I have no affiliation to these guys its just that I want there to be more color options on the market for flywheels. The standard green is :confounded: :tired_face: 

Dark grey is also my favorite color so its all win. Even the orange hubs look good wrapped in grey. 

Surely some of you guys want some grey flywheels and we can get this rollin. Seems to be moving pretty slow at the moment.
