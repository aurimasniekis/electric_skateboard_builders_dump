I know this question has been asked a million times, but I only find results for people that have calibers. Are there any mounts for something like Paris trucks or gullwing chargers? I can only find 50mm mounts. Thanks in advance

It says this on my site:
With some light duty work, these mounts will also fit:
Gullwing Sidewinder trucks, Paris Trucks, Buck Trucks, Santa Cruz Road Rider Trucks and probably a few others.

Please note, proper mounting of this part requires a drill. If you don't have one, but have a little shipping money. I will do the work for you! Send your trucks to me.
