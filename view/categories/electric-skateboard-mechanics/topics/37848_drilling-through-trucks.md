I have Paris V2 180mm trucks. I want to drill an m5 sized hole through them.
Will that weaken the strength of the truck significantly?

Probably. All the way through? The axle runs inside the cast. If just a small hole for grub screw, it will be fine.

Will 2 or 3 grub screws be enough to hold my mount in place? Also do I have to thread a hole in the trucks for grub screws
```

Yes a pilot hole for grub screws should work, no threading needed. 
Which mount are you using?

threads in aluminum as soft as truck hangars are, won’t last.  if you try to thread them the threads will disintegrate the first time you try to tighten a bolt down...

I think I’m going to put in 2 grub screws and I will epoxy around the permimiter of the mount.

Also should the pilot hole go all the way down to the axle or before I could see the axle

Just use jb weld, the grub screws won't even matter.

Epoxy doesn't always work. I smothered my mount with high strength epoxy. One ride later my mount was lose. I bought some bolts and did what @dg798 was talking about and it's been rock solid for months

i have 2 holes made for grub screws as well, so it shouldn't be a problem

If you used jb weld, give it 24-48 hours to cure

jb weld is made to bond metal to metal. it is steel reinforced so acts like a weld

Quick question,
Is there a way to install idlers onto my motor mount.
Do I just use 2 bearings and 2 screws and washers, or is it more complicated than that?
```

Nope just put them on so it engages more teeth. It might be hard if you have big wheels and only a small mount. Make sure to put the idle on the slack side though
