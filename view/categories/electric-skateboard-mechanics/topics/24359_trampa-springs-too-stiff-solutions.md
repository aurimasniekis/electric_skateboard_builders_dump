While testing out the feel of my board (unpowered) I quickly discovered that the springs in my vertigo spring trucks have very little give. It takes quite a bit of effort to move them at all, and this is after loosening the tension screws and the kingpins. 
I briefly looked into design a custom set, but, at $280 for four springs, that's well out of my budget right now (I could probably get a full set of MBS trucks for that! Rather not, though).
I've only seen this issue raised once before here: 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/e-toxx-belt-drive-i-trampa-holypro-i-mbs-f5-bindings-heelstraps-t2-9-tires-fivestar-hubs-matrixii-trucks-i-roxxy-escs-i-turnigy-sk3-192kv-motors-graphine-6s-5000mah-65c-wired-in-series-for-12s/9601/8

...and the guy also had MBS trucks which turned way better.
So am I in the minority here that I think trampa trucks are hard to steer on? I'm not expecting to turn it into a street carver (although...), I just want to be able to have a turning radius of less than fifty meters.
Has anyone else had this problem? How did you solve it?

Do you have dampas inserted? I have Red dampas and they were too stiff in the first days. After some days they perform  much better and my radius gets smaller.

I've got yellow ones. I was hoping to use this board mostly for low to medium speeds on everything from pavement to light dirt and gravel tracks, so decent steering is kind of a must have.
So the springs just need to be softened or "broken in"?

The picture I posted on the linked thread was not an accurate representation of the truck's turning radius. They turn much better than what's shown. The problem was caused by me damaging several bushings during assembly.

Again, apologies @trampa for the misrepresentation. To my defense I did first email a picture (showing how tight it was), and I was told that it looked normal, so I figured it was. I was probably a little salty when I posted it too. Had been riding around like that for awhile, and eating a fair amount of shit throughout :sweat_smile: 

But yeah, the dampas will loosen up with a little bit of riding. Bindings are a must as well.

Whew, that's a load off my mind! Thanks @benjammin, I was starting to think I'd need to bulk up just to move the thing, and at 67kg I'd have a lot of catching up to do!
About the bindings- does it matter which? I'm thinking of getting the Freeboard S2s. I like the ease getting in and out of them with no fuss.

There are two positions where you can sit the springs on, the closest to the center one should require a much softer steering effort than the farthest from the center

Yeah, I noticed the second set of tapped holes on top, but since there wasn't a corresponding set on the bottom I was a little scared to try it. Will the springs hold without being anchored from the bottom, just the top?

if you got a board without bindings, you really cant use dampas! on my urban carver I used the outer spring positions without dampas and pre-compressed the springs with the spring seat grub screw type until it was just about right for me (82kg, grub screw nearly flush with top of the board).

if you are a lightweight (67kg is fairly light), use the inner spring positions and play with the pre-compression again.

Because without bindings and with dampas I'm more likely to get thrown?
Yeah, I'm definitely a lightweight- if I'm going to get thrown, it'll be for distance ðŸ˜œ
I'll try moving the springs to the inner position.

You can get much more lean into your turns with bindings than you can without. As whitepony said, if you're gonna ride without bindings, lose the dampas and just ride with springs.

fwiw, looks like there's two types of baseplates (one with a second spring position, and one without): http://www.trampaboards.com/baseplates-c-86.html

As far as bindings go: I've been happy with my f5s with skate shoes. Feel like I'm less likely to fall when strapped in; however, falling strapped in sucks :neutral_face: As heavy as these things are, it's pretty much impossible to do any kinda ninja shit. Best to invest in some good padding.

@okp has a emtb build going with freebord bindings though. Maybe he'll fill us in. Been thinking about trying these for a minute.

On my Vertigo mini carver trucks I do have both holes and inner and an outter, I switched to inner because with the outters I could even turn at low speed

[img]http://i.imgur.com/pGw0sNX.jpg[/img]

You won't see both holes here as the outters are covered by griptape, buy I assure you guys they are there:

You can ad the holes in the Hanger for the inner Spring position. In general, you should use the softest Dampas if you wish to make your board more agile. You can also ride without dampas. That is what I do.

Nice! But how flexible is your deck? Mine isn't really and it sounds like that'sâ€‹ factor that needs to be considered.
What if you switched the front and back configuration?
Edit: how much do you weigh? That probably also effects how easy your steering is (I'm 67kg with clothes on).

Hi there,
nice to drill inner holes on the ATB hanger but this is not possible on a Holypro mtb because of the big hole in the deck.

I was thinking the whole day about a solution and maybe i found it.
Pleeeeaase @trampa wouldn't it be possible to sell a different spring with less tension? Did you ever try that?

For Offroad the normal spring seems fine but for slower riding or with a street setup in urban areas less spring tension would be a dream.

I think you could make many people happy including me!

I crunched someâ€‹numbers on this a while agoâ€‹. A standard trampa spring can support about 57 kg fully compressed - and we've got four of them! That's a lot, so I figured taking it down to about 30 kg per spring would do the trick. 
The problem is that everyone willâ€‹ experience it differently depending on their own weight.
What would be a reasonable tension for carving that most people would be happy with?
Did you perhaps mean a big hole in the truck rather than the deck? I don't know holypro so well, so pics would be helpful.

Trampa offers 5 different dampas to stiffen the springs, would love to see 5 different spring tensions to make it loose :joy:

That would be awesome! Though I imagine that even just two options would be enough, one for off-road and one for street andâ€‹ carving. MBS seems to do well with two types of shock blocks, so if that's good enough for them then surely trampa can match that?
There's more and more people wanting these "hybrids", and if they can't the get parts they need from the companies and don't want to shell out for an Evolve, they'll just make the stuff themselves. ;-)

how can you say that the deck flex does not affect steering when you can clearly see that it does in your video?
when the deck is flexed the angle of the baseplate changes which affects steering geometry.

Yeah, the left one's a problem. Even if you put metal strips over the holes and drilled through that it wouldn't be as strong. in any case I wouldn't recommend it. All  I can suggest is a new deck (sorry, I know that's not very helpful).

You can ride without dampas if you want more steering. Most people wanting to go off road want quite a stiff suspension. The MTB fraction usually races the board down the hill and a loose steering mechanism would make speed wobbles more likely. Softer springs would help a bit, but its better to shift the springs to the inside, like we have done it on the Urban Carve Board.

You will get used to the MTB setup and will start to like the stiffer steering, since it ads comfort at speed. The bindings will help you to lean into turns more extreme.

@High-roller, MBS is also fine with one deck flex, suiting 65-100Kg rider weight (-;

The urban carve takes 83mm, 90mm, 125mm (once available) Urethane wheels, 6 and 7" Pneumatics. You can also mount a MTB hanger and use the 8" wheels, you can mount bindings and basically convert your board to a mini MTB.

So you have tons of choices and possibilities to upgrade the Board.

Well, if you like to use 7" pneumatics, you can use the carve hanger, If you wish to use 8" MTB-Wheels, you can upgrade to MTB hangers, if you wish to use street wheels with MTB hangers, you can use the ultimate hangers.

The street carver is very stable at speed, especially when you have the rear springs in the outer position.
It's really made for carving and taking sharp turns - but it does not get very sketchy at speed. That is the beauty.

I have a street carver with the rear springs on the outter position and you need to give them some pretension with the adjusters in order to avoid wobbles at really high speed and bad roads, for comparison sake a Cronin is more stable with the correct bushings and can take sharper turns than the Trampa, but if you give more riding hours to the Trampa you won't get the wobbles but not because of the Trampa hardware but because of your ability to ride/adapt to the board itself.

Hi Alan, the radius you can turn the board 360Â° is about 2m with the springs in the inner position. With your setup you decrease the radius a lot, but gain stability at top speed. Its really a matter of the setup, as with every other Truck. I personally like the balance between stability at top speed, and carve ability. I'm pretty used to the spring trucks and ride with a top speed of roughly 36Km/h with the springs in the inner position. Most important is the spring pre-tension, especially when having the springs in the inner position.

I must say, the yellow dampas are perfect for me. Springs in outer position, total weight including gear around 120 KG.
I previously had plenty of speed wobbles/could compensate by putting more pressure on my rear leg. All gone now. Finding myself at full throttle on pavement and about 20% faster offroad.

Added benefit, my weight distribution is much better now.

@trampa Super fast delivery. Thanks guys.

I grinded the springs using a table grinder, 3/4 dowel, and 3/4 inch PVC pipe.  I ended up taking about 20% off. I weigh about 150 pounds and that seems to work good for me. It helps to hold the PVC pieces loosely against the springs so that the spring spins pretty rapidly while the grinder shaves off the metal.  My board carves awesome now without needing bindings!

Here's a video showing what I did:
