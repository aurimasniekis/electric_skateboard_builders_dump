A while ago I bought a pack of Bones Super Reds off a guy selling online. Price was almost half of the normal listing price, but since he only had this one bearings pack along with a bunch of totally different stuff I figured he just sold off a spare pack..

When checking the bearings more closely I saw that the typing on the rubber protecting ring was a bit different from genuine Bones, ie the "TM" had the same type size as "REDS" and "BONES". Also the "bones super reds" typing on the very edge of the bearings was a bit misaligned. 

I saw a bunch of these fake bones listed on AliExpress and probably other stores as well. 

Make sure you don't get fooled getting crappy cheap a** bearings (as I did)! 

I got a full refund btw and the guy removed the listing.

eBay is full of fake bones, there's a reason they are cheap, pay the price or buy a reasonable alternative brand from a good supplier preferably with a bricks and mortar outlet methinks

I always buy my Super Reds at the Mall sure its about $5 more expensive but I have confidence that Billabong isnt selling me a fake set and i get them right there and then.
