Evolve is out of stock for there 38T belts, I wouldn't want to pay $25 a belt either. Looking to know if anybody knows the correct size belt and where they are sold for less than $25 a belt haha.

It's 260mm. And specify your location for the belt supplier.

360mm is for the AT wheels, 260mm is for 38T.
