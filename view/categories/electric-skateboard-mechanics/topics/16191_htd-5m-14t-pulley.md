I have some in both steel and aluminum (pictured).

They come with set screws, but I'm currently out of kew-way stock.

$12.00 each, plus $2.60 shipping in the US.

I have the 14T motor pulleys picture, not the Kegel wheel pulleys yet. Still confirming details on the Kegel pulleys...

@SolidSurfer Hey just to confirm this pulley will work with https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

And it will be 14.60 total?
```

## \#20 Posted by: SolidSurfer Posted at: 2017-04-03T15:58:36.081Z Reads: 119

Yes, this pulley is for 8mm shafts. 

Since that particular motor doesn't have a key-way milled in it, you're going to need to file a flat spot in the shaft to receive the set screw(s). You might also consider tapping the pulley for a larger set screw, as the provided set screws are quite small (shown on steel pulley in above photo).

$14.60 with shipping. Please specify if you'd like aluminum or steel.

Thanks!

Just shipped USPS First Class.

Pulley has a key way - you just don't have to use it. : )

Thanks!
