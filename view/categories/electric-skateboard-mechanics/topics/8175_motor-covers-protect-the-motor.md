Has anyone use a motor cover? Most of the eboards here i see a naked motor. No cover. 

Is a motor cover necessary ?
I find this on thhingiverse, anyone try this?

Motor covers insulate heat and impede natural air cooling while skating, so I wouldn't use it personally.

I get what u mean, but if we dont cover it all the way, just the side which is facing the street, it would be half of the motor covered, and i think the air can flow through there, right? Or am i missing something?

if you're covering half, it kind of defeats the point which is to prevent small scratches on the motor. It's largely cosmetic.

Don't forget about debris getting caught between the motor can and the cover. That could be a thing. One piece of road junk could ruin your day.

A small rock got lodged in between my belt and belt cover once and carved a line down my belt almost splitting it into two.. 

Covers are largely unnecessary and can lead to problems.
