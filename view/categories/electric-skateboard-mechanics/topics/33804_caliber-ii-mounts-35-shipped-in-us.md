Yet another Caliber II mount.  I tried to make it as cheap as possible while still retaining a good standard of quality.  No one likes mounts for Paris trucks so I thought I'd take a stab at Caliber mounts.  The mounts are still in developments but I should be able to ship in about a week from today if everything goes right.

Just judging interest, don't feel obliged to order when the time comes if you put yourself down on here

The clamp doesnt look structurally solid. You are clamping aluminium on one side which causes strain on the opposite side, to make things worse on that side is a M4 hole.

I would switch to using a bolt straight through, instead of tapping the other side of the clamp.. Makes it easier to make, and you get the bonus of
1. Less tapping, cheaper more durable
2. The great endurance properties of nylon lock nuts to prevent loosening.

That clamp is not by any means final, just something I whipped up quickly for a picture, look at my other thread if you wanna see what the final one will look like.

@Lionkev55 I do t think Iâ€™m gonna do that because it will destroy my concept of this thing fitting inside your wheel pulley

@Jammeslu fill out the form on the other thread for the Paris Mount ðŸ˜‰

Never knew you wanted it to fit inside the wheel pulley. That is gonna be real tough, especially since there are so many wheel pulleys, all a different size.

It will be mainly for 15mm wheel pulleys, anything smaller will be mounted regularly

Also, can you go take a look at my render on my other topic and give me some feedback?

#Update #1

Progress is suuuuuuuuper slow :confused:

Still working, but very, very slowly.  School has become number one priority... 
Long story short, my engineering grade dropped to a D.  Mom was mad, did a whole bunch of perspective sketches, back up to an A.  I don't want it to happen again :joy:.
