OK.

I'm wandering down the AT rabbit hole, and I need some feedback on wheels.

I kinda want to get the fivestars because they're cheap and can handle a 9" tire.

But I'm also considering the Rockstar Pro's
https://www.mbs.com/parts/13240-mbs-rockstar-pro-hub-silver-1

So, I guess my questions are:

1. Is a 9" tire that much better than an 8" tire?

2. If there's no real difference, are the Rockstar Pro's worth the extra cost?

About me:  Fat, working on it but still a chubs.  Like 300+ lbs with gear.

My lunch:
![20190125_122756|375x500](upload://dQcfa4J35i9buoASb16A7po7uUE.jpeg) 

Shit I need to buy:
Matrix II trucks
COLAB or KALY 2.0 deck
chain drive 1:5 
12s6p30q

Shit I need to make:
trucks mount
motor mount

Shit I already have:
dual 6384 170KV
dual focbox

Wat you think?

I think you should overthink your diet...

... and don‚Äôt get the pro hubs because they have horrible tolerance and not worth the money.
I like the extra clearance on the 9‚Äú wheels.
Running 9/42th chain drive I laid off from time to time with 8‚Äú.

Those are APS motors?
If yes, one more thought:
Order one more motor to have spare and glue in the motor magnets with what ever you can find.

Forget salads... Against the fat there's nothing better than "the LEMON method":
Use a grater like this
![IMG_20190125_1843243645522720929298309|375x500](upload://5W9nDKFQybbSgCnGBVoWnOWdYJa.jpeg) 

Pick a lemon and grate the skin, that's just for practice. Once you are done with the lemon you should have mastered the method.
Attach the grater to your belly and go hard on It!
It hurts a lot but you Will get used to It. Just be a man.
Put a few towels around, for the blood and stuff...i usually do It in the shower. Easier to clean...
After a few sessions you will be skinny. Way faster than the salad.

Nah.... Our weight is irrelevant. The thread is about 9" or 8". I was just kidding. Let's go back to the topic.
I have used 5‚Ä¶6‚Ä¶and 8 hence my joke. I actually also wonder what's the difference wearing 9" shoes....

I've heard a few users having issues with QC on the pros. The bearings won't seat right and wobble. I have the fivestars and am just waiting on my motor mount to get here to try them out.

Dieting is hard.  I was 280lb a few years ago. 
Lost 100lb in a year.  Cut out pretty much all liquid other than water.  Dairy only twice a week.  No more eating the last 3 hours before bed. And always eating a real breakfast.  Was hard as fuck and i don't eat like that now but ive kept it off.
Good for you for making steps. Its not easy.

The mbs pro hubs are/can be a nightmare from my experience at least , and ive heard nothing but praise about the fivestars wish i got them with 9's rather than the pro with 8's :( 

Anyways are they the same bolt pattern?  as i might go 9" if they are.

I repeat! Irrelevant. Every fucking fat bastard is welcome to our community.
I have had a 6 pack all my life and now i am fat as fuck. Months on a bed have a high bill to pay. I feel no less no more than i was or will be.
Back to topic..... 9" wheels

What are your thoughts about going 8 or 9 instead?

Ok.  Fivestar hubs with 9" tires it is!

Where are you getting your 9" tires may I ask? Mbs US doesn't sell them. Also they don't sell any colors of the pro hubs other than black, silver, and gold.

If there would be 9‚Äú in different colors and hubs which fit the most popular bolt pattern, more people would choose them as they give you way much more clearance on e-mtbs

Thanks, took a look from a weight/strength perspective.

For the weight-weenies out there, of course there is nothing lighter than the MBS given it's not metal. You're into a fraction of the price of metal rims, if price is a major deciding factor I'd stop here

Trampa utilises a bolt together solid hub+separate spoke design which amasses to over a half kilo advantage on the 3D Serviasa hub, but potentially is not quite as strong, it's a great addition 

3D Servisas 9" hub from 2 solid piece which wold appear to Armageddon-surviving. Each spoke is the width of the entire hub

MBS x4 = 0.656kg
Trampa x4 = 1.184kg
3D Servisas x4 = 1.96kg

But then you lose the superstar bolt compatibility which means you have to factor in etoxx drives as well, not a terrible problem üòÉ
@moon is going to launch a 4.4 drive as well which may take into account the mBS
