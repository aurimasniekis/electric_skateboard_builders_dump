Soooo hey all. I’ve been looking around for weeks now to try and find an affordable way for me to make an Enclosure at a high standard for not loads of £££. I’ve seen the fibreglass way but I’ve seen the finish isn’t quite perfect. The only way I’ve found is vacuum forming, I’ve seen other people on the forums advertise these but they’ve been quite high prices I think for a bit of plastic. My friend is currently selling a machine and I’m wondering wether people would buy these enclosures? I would make them in all different shapes and sizes and list them on eBay (for buyer protection). They wouldn’t be expensive what so ever, Perhaps around £20/25 (if not cheaper if I can manage to get the machine and sheeting for a reasonable price) and a bit more for custom ones + Shipping (worldwide). If you would be interested just drop a comment :slight_smile:

No I agree that is cheap, but if people wanted a custom shape and not with torque’s logos on then I couldn’t really find anything out there. Also this was mainly aimed at the European builders but obviously for the other worldwide people (shipping would be a lot to America and other places so that’s why it’s mainly Europeans)

I think you should sort this out before you do anything on this forum

I’ve tried multiple times, I’ve contacted the shipping company and everything, I sent it out to him on the date I said but if i were to refund them then I would loose a lot, I didn’t make barely anything on those board so I just wanted to help people out by making and selling.

Edit: i sold like 20 of those decks and everyone that bought them can vouch for me that they received them

Vacuuming machines are super cheap, you can use those for AC units, like 40$ , you will spend more on the vacuuming materials than on the whole pump

same problem here, making a vacuum machine is quite ez but why waste that money on something you will only use 1 or 2 times. The most problematic part is the heater anyway. Buying is most of the time cheaper and faster

Referring to your original comment about "a bit of plastic" and the price being high.....

You're not paying for material, you're paying for design hours and manufacturing time. Material costs are negligible in a niche market like eSK8.

Scale up production for a market that wants the enclosures by the thousand and that's a different matter... !

I haven’t had any bad votes so far...I wonder why. Maybe because I don’t scam anyone and I’m actually genuine but because one person didn’t recieve there order everyone thinks I’m a scammer

After you actually try to make a few molds and enclosures and realize how much work it is I'm pretty sure you will either raise your prices higher than mine or just give up. But have fun.

Best of all: **ELHO BARCELONA**

![IMG_20180501_122615|690x219](upload://u61WPwd245xchmQAotimA22kZgr.jpg)

Either as an enclosure (you can stack 2 together to make it stronger) or as a mold to build your custom enclosure out of fiberglass or CF.
