Hey guys.after I rode my skateboard yesterday on a running track I noticed a weird noise when I spun my motor. Could it be some junk in my motor? If so, how do I get it out? I think it's a piece of metal.

Hi,
I found this tutorial of disassembling and assembling the sk3 6374 so you can use it as a reference. Clean any rocks or debris and you should be good to go.

Thank you! For some reason I couldn't find any disassembly videos.
