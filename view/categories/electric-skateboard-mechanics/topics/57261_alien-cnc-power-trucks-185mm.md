My only concern would be the fact that APS is not a truck company like Liquid, Surfrodz, Ronin, Caliber or any other precision truck company. You'll get a largely untested product that may have a few major flaws when longboarding.

Looks to have a stepped bushing seat but also looks to have a lot of space between the bushings, almost like it has a insert bushing not shown.

I am not sure if the drawing is to scale but it looks like in the picture as though it does not use "tall" bushings.

If you want some kick-ass trucks & motor mounts for eSk8, hit up Chaka at Ollin.
