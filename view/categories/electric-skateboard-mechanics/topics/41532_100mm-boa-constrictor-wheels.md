Testing some new wheel prototypes by [Boa Wheels](http://boawheels.com/) (not online yet).  These are the 100mm Constrictor wheel prototype in 83a.  They have kegel-style hubs which are made from glass nylon.  The final version might be dark purple or some other dark color.  They are expected around first-quarter 2018.  MOQ wholesale might be around 400 wheels / 100 sets, manufactured in California.

First impressions are wow, this is so soft and squishy in my hand.  I can squeeze it more than a SuperFly/74a/reflex.

Riding them, they seem like they are glued to the road.  I actually tried hard to slide them and could not get it to break loose.

They fit exactly some Evolve kegel pulleys I have here, like plug-and-play.

I non-scientifically bounce-tested a very large bearing on them and it bounces off like it does from a 74a(r) SuperFly, and not at all like it does from a 78a flywheel clone.

The cores seem really strong.

Any questions, hit me up

Cheers

so what's the story with these, are you affiliated with boa? 

site's down btw. 

what's with the moq, the sample you have is that a prototype?

what's the price?

how long have you used them? how's the urethane longevity?

I am not affiliated with them, they were created by the Jed Boards team.  I volunteered to test them.  I have run them through 2 full charges so far.  The sample is a prototype.  I didn't ask about price.  Longevity is yet unknown.

Hey Brian, nice wheels. I would like to see then dark purple. The durometer changes from one manufacturer to another, right? is not the same 78a from one to 78a from other. That's why 83a Boas feel similar to 74a ABECs, no?

On the other side, from who are those pink ABECs? Yours? Any chance to buy those from you?

Yeah, the durometer interpretation is totally different from one to the other, and could be almost the same despite the durometer number they apply. That's why I always thought it was weird the Flex Revolution Rough Stuff wheels were 85a (??) Whaaat? So I assume something wrong happened with the classification. They apply the durometer number they consider convenient to them, but in reality is like that from other manufacturers.

No, never. I always wonder about their durometer. I can't not believe Flex Revolution created those wheels with such a hard durometer (85a). So I imagine their durometer classification is different or their uro is different, don't know really.

I'm guessing you could contact Jeremy from Boa Wheels. (same Jeremy from Jed Boards)  Production wheels are not available yet, he is soliciting community feedback right now on the prototypes.  Probably 1st quarter 2018.  I don't know who will sell them at retail but Boa will sell them at wholesale.  I'm not sure if they will sell them at retail as well; I didn't ask.  I only asked about wholesale

The kegel-style core is stronger and objectively "better" for large-sized longboard wheels, aside from the obvious pulley-compatibility issues.

The dh longboarders will tell you the Cannibal core on the Magnums is the best core, in fact proven to be the fastest core on earth so far..I also hear a lot of great things about the Speedvent cores and they come in a nice defcon thane too! Has anyone made wheel pulleys for the Speedvents or the Venom core on the Magnums?

Roll them both off a table slowly onto a hard surface and see how high they bounce -- or get [a little deeper into the woods with scientific measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore_durometer#Method_of_measurement) -- or just take them out and ride them hard and see which you like more

speed vents would work with bolt through style pulleys just fine. They would also work fine with insert pulleys most likely provided someone would design one for them. I would be willing to use them if anyone would like to volunteer a model i can upload and have printed. 

I have 33-38T in flywheel/clone compatible and 32-38T for kegel cores. Speed vents would be a nice addition to the collection.

The wheels aren't for general sale yet, they are being tested by a few folks on a few continents in a few different climates.  So far I am happy with them.  The only downside seems to be pulley compatibility since these are the less-popular kegel-style hub pattern.  But overall I'm okay with that, since these cores seem much stronger than the abec11 style spoke pattern.

I really liked these wheels, can you measure the offset of the truck side? Is it the same of the kegel? in another words, a kegel pulley is directly compatible or the pulley has to be taller so the belt and the wheel have enough clearance

We just need squishy wheels in 97mm upwards at a good price THAT IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE TO BUY.  As soon as someone clocks that they will be the standard esk8 wheel.  ABEC11 flywheels could have been that wheel, but their lack of availability and high price precluded them.  Now its all irrelevant for them.

Hey all. We're starting production tooling with Labeda this month, takes around 60 days to finish the tool and pour the wheels. We'll have these available in our HK/US warehouse and will be doing all our fulfilment and shipping from there. We're working with a few retailers as well to be stocking them.

Retail pricing is $160 USD/set. And we're producing 1000 sets of wheels in our first run so expect plenty of availability.

The core has the same offset profile as the standard kegel and will fit anything that takes a kegel wheel. Some pics below mounted to a boosted V2. Top speed on the BBV2 is now around 47km/hr and doesn't require any modifications and all with stock pulleys.

Some more pics and videos below.

I can understand any questions regarding the price. As mentioned its not the final price yet. We're still working the numbers. They're not cheap wheels to make. They're made in California by Labeda who make the Orangatang Kegels and this is our own formula we've developed, not a stock formula.

Making them $60 is completely unsustainable. If you look at other wheels this size such as the ABEC 107's and the Evolve branded ABEC 107's they're around $150-160.

For $150, you're getting a bigger wheel and paying a premium for the Abec-11 reputation and proven urethane formula. Since these wheels are basically untested for the masses, I think it's going to be a hard sell for many at that price point. I really want you to succeed with these wheels, cause they look great, and get a set myself, but I think they would probably have to be priced at or slightly below the ABEC-11 97's to be competitive.

How about a sweet intro price for us builders to take the plunge and post some reviews, then raise them later after they've proven themselves? 😉

Totally agree. We’re still crunching the numbers as we’re waiting to confirm the final pour costs with Labeda. 

I’d be happy to offer up a special price here to get more riders on them once we’re done. We’ve got a few samples out there now with various riders in different countries stress testing them and nothing but positive vibes.

... you cannot pour urethane in the grand State of California. Every commercial attempt in that direction will eventually lead to a marketing stalemate. Not only the product will be prohibitively expensive but available in short supply. That's why if you want to create a fantastic wheel at an affordable price that will take the hobby like a storm in huge quantities, you need to move your manufacturing facilities to Burkina Fasso, Belice or Timbuktu.

Honestly I'd like to see an MBS shaped wheel that's preshaved in a abec like compound. Rounded lips on esk8 don't make much sense to me.

-offset
-square lip profile like MBS are after they've been shaved
-100mm (not 93 like after shaving)
-kegel core
-75 or 76a classic(to me classic is grippier then 74a reflex)
-65mm contact patch..

Basically a premium formula preshaved MBS wheel... Lol mmkk

What you don't understand is that while that specific wheel may not be available, I'm saying that in general wheels of smaller sizes are generally more available than the larger ones and have been in the market longer.

Plus, this is cutting-edge wheel research.  To everyone talking about "cheap, cheap, cheap" well you can have "good" or "cheap", pick one.  This room is for "good".  We're not striving for cheap in here, that's just adding noise to the conversation.

I did some research and chemistry for pouring polyurethane is expensive plus the process itself is dificult and requires a lot of knowlage. On top of that I can imagine that not every batch is ok so there's probably a waste to.
I'm aloso looking for reasonable priced wheels but these are not them with that price. The core is ready so no molds for that. Maybe they can and should be cheaper?

Because they chunk! Square lips are a no-no around here. Get it man. Trust us. Is a fact. Perhaps in the skateboard world they are fave, perhaps they chunk after a suicidal Pikes Peak downhill and they don't care, but here they chunk big time. Perhaps is due to the motor torque, shitty cities street pavement, unprepared roads, no-balanced esk8boards, whatever the cause they chunk; is a reality. Rounded lips for this community, don't ask no more questions. It is what it is.

I think that wheel was more an example of a more appealing color choice than ideal wheel shape. 

Gotta kind of agree with @pixelsilva though. I was really excited about these wheels in that yummy, gummy **_"Jed Red"_** color, but dark purple doesn't seem as interesting, dynamic or instantly recognizable. If these wheels do end up seriously competing with big Abec-11 flywheels in ride and quality, I think it would be an interesting dichotomy to have instantly recognizable "Jed Red" Kegels or "Abec-11 Green" Flywheels dominating the big thane esk8 scene.

MBS vs rough stuff..

MBS wheels are great when shaved down. They're like reboundy but not, wide and grippy,I dunno how to explain it. They're great. And contrary to what everyone up there has said about square lipped wheels, I've never had my MBS chunk after shaving down to square lips. They're litteraly the grippiest wheels I've tried. Can lean so far with them compared to any size abec or kegel, without slipping out. 

@longhairedboy said it best.

 [quote="longhairedboy, post:27, topic:24317"]
I've ridden on worn down MBS wheels for a time now.. i can see the appeal. They don't ride like abecs or kegels. They're pretty distinct.

The rough stuff on the other hand feel like big wheels(from a kids toy) even after shaving....hard...not comfy...not grippy

I had the chance to see the pre-production Constrictors and also comparing them side by side to the Abec11 107s and I have to say they feel softer. However, sadly they (100mm) are only available in ugly white? Who the hell wants white wheels?

I was about to give it a try (Yellow wheels) despite the $120 price and adopting the new Kegel pulley hub style, but dropped the idea when I thought about painting the hub just because their color stinks and ruins my whole build. Not worth it. I'll stick with an old friend :point_down: probably not as good as the Boa but reliable, not pretentious and almost at half the price. (and off course will test the new @marcmt88 Delrin wheel pulley on them)

We specifically didn’t do black due to the way the pigment chemically changes the urethane. We ended up with a wheel that had more instability and was likely to have issues over time. The colours are chosen for a very specific reason. 

As an example we can’t cut the black wheels in Harfang options due to the chemical issue as the wheels fray.

It's not always that simple. Each pigment can directly affect the performance of the urethane (see my post above). I'd love for us to make wheels in every colour that people want, but that would potentially compromise the ride (not to mention be a logistics and manufacturing nightmare!) and we'd end up with unhappy customers due to wheels being less than stellar in performance.

Color options will forever be a personal preference so I will respectfully disagree with you on your comment of "shooting oneself in the foot".

I was chatting with Jed a few weeks ago on this very topic, the core color of the 90mm Hatchling wheels (I bought some and this conversation happened before Jed revealed the color of the core). I was just mentally comparing yellow with black core vs yellow with dark gray core, and I told him that the dark gray core will look much better than black. That was when he revealed that the core will indeed be dark gray.

I have been as hard on the prototypes as possible.  **There are zero signs of chunking.**  If these were 97mm Flywheels, they'd be chunked by now for sure.  These are very grippy too and just generally a pleasure to ride on.

I'll also mention there is also an interesting phenomenon where after you ride through water, the inside of the contact patch is dry almost instantly giving you grip while the outside dries off.  This happens with SuperFly also, but it's *much* more exaggerated with the Constrictors.  I never really noticed it on Flywheels.

And with that, here are the Boa Constrictor 100mm wheels after a few hundred miles:

@Schulerbible but the photo it looks the same as the Kegel, just a new belt and print risers and a bigger pulley 

I’m still thinking if the added weight is worth, since my build is focused on light weight, there is a really short section on my commute that is really bad, a few meters actually, but it’s a parte that I’m forced to ride in line with cars, and with 80mm I’m force to go slow and it’s creates a risky situation since most drivers don’t know what they should do

Hey guys. Just wanted to update as I recently found out about Boa wheels. I saw there was going to be a group buy and expressed immediate interest. I then found out that there was a guy in my city who actually had a set here that wasnt being tested since his BB was down. I got the ok to get them and give it a shot. I was pumped that I could direct install to my boostedboard. Process is straight forward. Changing from an 80mm to a boa 100mm is amazing as to ride quality. It’s like night and day. I live in NYC and there’s horrible concrete/asphalt everywhere. Part of my work commute includes going across a rumble strip bridge. On the Orangatang wheels my feet vibrated like crazy. I felt every bump. After switching to the boa constrictor 100mm it’s insane. I don’t feel vibration annoyance. I run thru a ton of junk and debris which is definitely not by choice but just crappy roads. The stoping and accelerating is minimally affected. I would not stress about regearing. I feel a lot more confident with these wheels riding over metal construction plates in the city and that I’m not gonna go flying off. I still take my time. I’m about 30 miles now on the wheels and truly in love. Looking forward to this dang weather to stop being so cold and enjoy them during the warm season.

Thanks, that’s very good, any idea how the 90mm would compare to 100? The experience would be something like @Zack described or way less on the 90mm?

With this weight difference there’s no reason to continue on the kegels

About the edge profile, the round profile would be more behaved than a sharp edge like the kegels? The roads I travel have lots of poor made patches that are not in level with the rest of the surface, the Kegel keeps dancing on this edges if need to cross one parallel to them 

If yes then I’m sold on the hatchlings since I’m tired of almost loosing control with cars arround

I'm absolutely loving these wheels. I'm more than likely going to use them in my non-customs now that i've got a about a hundred miles on mine. No chunks. Also, they grip like a motherfucker in fast hard carves but aren't too squishy, i can still feel what i need to in the road.  Some kind of sorcery there i think.

[/quote]

the 97mm ABEC is a 78a which is nice, and it generally feels really good. But to be honest, i like the Boas better because they're the perfect height (107mm is just too yuuuge in my opinion, but 90mm is almost too small, so 97mm is close to ideal) at 100mm and the cp is wider and grippier while still giving that ABEC plush feeling. Its actually slightly more plush than a 97mm ABEC and just as quiet.

My only concern is will it chunk. So far no chunking, just the usual abuse puncturing and slicing as i roll over horrible shit on my way around town.

We had expected the wheels to be done and sent by last week but unfortunately due to some delays on the manufacturing side it’s taken a little longer than ancitipcated.

I think it is just the benefit of not having to bolt the pulleys onto the wheel, which also means it goes true all the time and not need try to get it to line up right. I had UNIK and a Chinese made pulley, getting it straight can be a bitch.

Very easy installation. Only tool is just for the axle nuts.

Bearing in the pulley will also take care of the radial load upon acceleration/deceleration.

With the bearing you can guaranty that the pulley will run true. I also think its a good idea to take some of the twisting load off the wheel and put it through the pulley bearing. Less wear on the wheel bearing seats. 

With this pulley you can run it several ways
- No bearing in the pulley
- 1 608 bearing in pulley
- 2 608's in the pulley 
- Share a 10mm wide bearing between wheel and pulley! 

Its nice to have the options.

I was encouraged to post some pics of the white Boa pre-production wheels. Wheels don't show any chips, person who owns them does a lot of slides. Just don't look that great anymore. Didn't have a proper camera on hand. ![image|666x500](upload://5GKAUGnsCz8ejmzPDegdq0PjZKr.jpg)

Good news (finally) is that Labeda have started on making the actual wheels. They had a number of delays with the moulds because they underestimated the sheer size of the wheel tooling finishing steps required, and it took longer to polish and finish than otherwise would. We started the tooling process in January FYI. We will be shipping to everyone waiting using the fastest method possible.

Wow, those white ones look great! I still think you nailed it on the color scheme with the red ones, which is what I'll be getting at some point. 

And just to reiterate a tip for the future white wheel owners, that I heard from another member, try wiping the sides of the wheels with Pledge to help repel diet and keep them white and flossy for longer. I still have to try this myself, but it makes sense.

We won’t be offering black. If we offered a black wheel we would be comprising the urethane integrity. Black pigment is chemically intrusive and would mean more chance of the wheels potentially chunking.

Go buy some black wheels then. Why are you even in this thread? You've proven that many black wheel options are already out there, so why would a newer company want to put out a new product that looks just like everyone else? For me, the fact that they sound like great quality wheels and the fact that they're red (NOT black) is what sells these. Very few quality red (and white) esk8 wheel options out there that I know of. Plus, you can always dye them black if that's your hang up. Or just buy any number of black wheels already available. :thinking:

Btw, I love black everything as a base option, but without other choices, it can start to look a little bland and generic.

[quote="captainjez, post:278, topic:41532, full:true"]
We won’t be offering black. If we offered a black wheel we would be comprising the urethane integrity. Black pigment is chemically intrusive and would mean more chance of the wheels potentially chunking.

I don't know to explain it clearly, but TB pulleys only use bolts to connect the pulley to the wheel, so when tightening them, you have to be very slow/precise (it will take you many tries to align it).

These pulleys already have the pillars (I don't know how else to call them), so when you inset it into the wheel, it's already aligned, and the bolts are only there to keep it from falling off the wheel.

I see. I was confused because originally I thought these wouldn't need the outer bolts. Which is asthetically preferred for me. So I was confused when @Deckoz mentioned bolting up. 

But it seem there are no bolts now as I originally hoped:  
[quote="JLabs, post:381, topic:26479, full:true"]
I redesigned them a few times… now they won’t need any bolts, will have an integrated bearing, and have interchangeable pulleys (the actual teeth). I’m excited, but this caused some more delay. I’m thinking 4 weeks from today

Black pigment (some of them at least) appear to affect the hemotox formula from BOA

Don't get how people took Black Pigment == Wheels Chunking. 

DIYE Rebrands like Meepo advise against their Red Wheels, probably because the red pigment and their formula don't work well together. It's not something only said by Boa

Although these wheels have a promising future it has only been tested by a few people, albeit experts.

The abec wheels are good wheels but they aren't cheap but when they chunk you will be disappointed.

These wheels right now are slowly shipping out to customers. You could be waiting a while before you get yours. To make it worse they ship from the US. I think sickboards.nl will stock them but who knows how much for?

Shipping is dynamically calculated based on your address. These wheels are made by Labeda in California and the same factory that produces Orangatang and other wheels. 

Our warehouse we are currently shipping from is in California but we will be loading up our other global warehouse locations as time goes on to make it easier and more cost effective to ship where we can. 

Wheels are relatively heavy to ship in large qty and we’re going as fast as we can to ensure reasonably priced shipping for all.

The wheels are arriving in our new warehouse this week and will be promptly shipping out by the 15th. We will be doing something to make it up to everyone who has waited patiently. We've also taken the wheels down for sale until we have them physically in the logistics system to be able to immediately send out.

I think Boawheels are the wrong company to ask why Orangatang doesn't want to release bigger size wheels like 90mm and 100mm wheels... Or even 110mm.

85mm are hardly larger than 80mm, only 2.5mm larger in radius.

Which by the way looking at the Harfang site shows you the fantastic colors available out there (for wheels and hubs altogether) from other manufacturers.

Doing business requires taking some risk. If you believe you can make a good product, and think people will buy it, then take the risk. Make the wheels, market them, if they are good, they will sell. Same with your board, why are you selling something that doesn't exist? 

Your approach is to take money from people before your product is made. Don't count your chickens before they hatch.

The wheels have all been made. Completely understand everyone's frustrations.

We had issues with logistics and required us to move the wheels to an alternative warehouse. Moving 2 tonnes of wheels is not the fastest of things to do. 

Wheels are landing in the new warehouse this week and will then start being immediately shipped out.

Hatchlings are still in the middle of production, AFAIK. If you recalled the previous photos of all the wheels curing, those are only the constrictors. It was mentioned that Labeda will produce the constrictors first, then the Hatchlings.

Don't expect any Hatchlings to ship in this batch. I will be extremely surprised if they do.

5:37 the user reports boa chunking in 3 days. any other users experience this? kinda to @mmaner point about there simply being more 107s in the wild, so although it seems like a lot of 107s chunk, we should be looking at number per total sold.

That sucks I just ordered mine. Apparently from what I've read so far, with no pigment the color of the Boa formulat should be white, and I took the white ones. So hopefully I won't have any issue with this color. I'll let you guys know what I think. I come from the EVOLVE 107 and are chunking in less than 30km... It's insane and a total rip off. I've read that the ABEC 11 107 (green) are chunking as well, so I thought I'd give Boa 100 a try... Hope not to be disapointed. But I agree we need 110mm wheels for E skate :slight_smile:

Really? I have friends there. Say hi to those guys over at Arc Boards for me. 

And no, there's no longer a reason to buy SuperFlies. Lebeda is making all the wheels anyone should care about, and if you call them up with an adequate moq they'll make wheels for you too. 

Boas, Popocas, Ahmyohs, both flavors of Kegels, a new flavor of Kegel i heard about this past weekend that's 85mm, and i think they even did the first batches of the Raptor Ghosts. I don't know if they still make those or if they ended up in hong kong, but i think at first they made them too. 

I've been wanting to get them to make me a wheel for a long time, and ironically, i wanted an 85mm kegel and somebody beat me to it.

@Grosskate & @Bundymus I can't remember which thread but I was recently reading how @Deckoz (I think) recommends regular wheel maintenance to keep urethane from chunking. He's got a ridiculous amount of miles on his abec 11s, if you look at them closely you can see they have lots of blemishes. But he fills all cracks and tears with super glue on pretty much a weekly basis and it's drastically changed their life spand from what I saw.
