Hi all i was thinking about getting some 97mm abec 11 flywheels for my enenrtion raptor so it would be  smoother over some cracks and so on.
I was wandering what yours thoughts would be about this
and it would be nice to hear from some people who have actually some experience with these wheels.
Thanks hh1

I'm using the 90mm 75a flywheels and they are very smooth especially compared to the Chinese knock offs.

I have been running 97's (clones) for a while.

The Good

Rolls over stuff with ease. rough sidewalks are significantly nicer to ride on. 

More ground clearance for going up curb cuts without hitting your truck hanger.

More color choices if your not a fan of green.

The Bad

Heavier and harder to spin up on steep hills

A little tippy when crossing grooves and pavement transitions.

Feels like it wanders a little more than 90mm's


.

........go for the softer durometers like 78a or 75a for ride comfort.

Have you done 80a? How much do you weigh? Idk if this guide from Muir skate was wrong, but they say it should be based off of your weight and preference..not sure what I would prefer IRL but seems a bit confusing:

What do you mean by "it wanders"? Wobbles?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm also curious about how much the speed would increase from doing this on the Raptor. On the GT the speed would go from 36kmh to 42kmh coming from the 83mm wheels. So considering the raptor is supposed to go 45kmh technically it should be able to hit 51kmh+ with 97mm...right?

97mm might cause wheel bite on the Raptor. 
Even 90mm may cause it unless your running really tight bushings. 
I think abec11 flywheels 83mm 75a would improve your ride without the wheel bit issue.

What if you use big risers? Or would that make the ride too high off the ground? May not make a difference I guess

I have read of someone taking one of the risers out of his raptor so I thought
If you can take a 7mm riser out it must be possible to put 14mm  bigger wheels on the raptor
And if I am not wrong I think onloop said too that it is possible  to take one riser out for lighter riders

if you remove the riser or put on larger wheels, you increase the risk of wheel bite which can send you flying off your board. Unless your running a high speed setup with hard bushings adjust tightly. 
But then you won't be able to turn at low speed. 
For safety sake I would keep the risers and stay with 83mm wheels. Just get softer wheels. 
The Chinese wheels are harder than their rating because of the material they're made of. 
Chinese 78a are harder than Abec11 81a
I've used both so I'm speaking from experience. 
I have not tried Abec11's 97mm wheels but I have used their 90mm 81a and 75a. 
I am not having any speed wobbles with the softer wheels. The softer wheels may even help because excessive road vibration can cause wobbles by upsetting your balance. The difference between a rough road and a smooth one is huge! And softer wheels make rough roads feel smoother. There's nothing like a buttery smooth road though, you can go so much faster! 
Things that cause speed wobbles are bushings that are too soft or too loose. A short wheelbase will also be less stable than a long wheelbase. 
My board is a downhill type 39"x 10" with 32" wheelbase. 44deg 10" Caliber II trucks on 1/4" risers, 90a bushings front and 95a bushings rear. The right bushings depend on your weight. I'm 185-190lbs. 
With bushings tight, I can go 25-30 mph without wobbles.

This was very helpful. I guess I will buy some abec 11 83mm in 75a. I weigh 165lbs so I think  softer is better for me since less force is pressing down on the wheel evening out some bumps.  I am still waiting for my battery so I have not driven  the board yet but having it lying around makes you wanting to upgrade the board simply because it is there :smiley:
But I noticed that the raptor wheels are quite hard

I think the Raptor wheels are a harder compound for durability. Let us know how you go with the softer wheels if you upgrade. I know another Raptor owner has gone the greeen Abec ones with softer compound and removed 1 rise


Youll need to get new screw and nut if you remove a riser as the ones with the raptor obviously allow for 2, but when I tried doing it the thread of those bolts wont allow you to put just 1 riser on if that males sense. It wont let you tighten the truck back on properly as the thread on shaft isnt shallow enough as it has a spacer first.

Make sure your bushing is tight or tighter of goIng fast and make sure you habe safety gear on.

Softer wheels definitely feel better under your feet. I guess its become very difficult to ship lithium batteries these days.
We can thank those stupid hover board knockoffs for that.
The Raptors are very fast so you might want to start out with your bushing tight for stability until you get used to it.
Riding a board under power is a lot different feel than free rolling downhill.
Yes, I agree with Dedbny, wear a helmet at least. even a slow speed fall can mess you up if you hit the back of your head.

No I have a Diy that I built. The Raptors look really good though, very polished.
And the price is right, I don't think you could buy the parts and build it yourself for less.

@Dedbny I was planting on wearing safety gear especially after seeing the thread where a lot a more seasoned e-boarders showed of their battle wounds.
Do you use the normal raptor bushings?
 did the person who removed the riser had any issues? I was planning on having tighter bushings as an e-board beginner.
@namasaki I had the same thought  that if I would build a board with these parts myself that I would not be cheaper and I liked the specs and the sleek look of the carbon deck housing al the components

Go softer 75a

The standard bushings on Raptor should be fine for lighter riders, just adjust tightness when riding at speed. If heavier rider I do recall maybe Onloop saying change them to tigher ones. You need the balance. Ie do you ride for speed more or carving. Stiffer bushings will reduce manoeuvrability.

@mr_mahal They might be 80a I was simply wondering if  thediffference between 78a and 80acould be o big.
My 78a wheels feel so smooth on tarmac and on the enertion 80a it was a lot of vibration when I was just puhing it for testing purposes.
@Dedbny I will trz to get 75a even though it seems to be difficult to find a dealer in germany who has these flywheels in stock and even harder to find them in 75a 
but I need to say @tarzan setup with only one riser looks mutch better to me but i am not sure if i will dare from the beginning

For the Raptor I might just replace the stock risers with equivalent sized shock risers. Might numb some of the vibrations. I'd rather not have to buy another set of flywheels.. 

@HH1 I'm also wondering the same if 78 vs 80 difference is negligible. In any case, according to the picture I posted above, if you're using a duro too soft for your weight it means you'll feel rougher terrain more. Would make sense, if the wheel "absorbs" the impact more because it is soft, you will still feel it, unless it's supposed to work like a shock riser does and just absorbs the vibration never transferring it to the board. Idk...I'll have the Evolve 83mm 76a's to put on the raptor and test the feel eventually. So I'll see if I really do feel a difference.

really?  I would have preferred at least 78a.  I think a lower durometer is always better for people who will actually be commuting because most tarmac is not perfect.  The ABEC 11 90 mm and 75a would be perfect for us on the raptor.

Lowering the ride height was my only concern with possible wheel bite. In the end the other option maybe to try softer riser for smoother ride as well or just leave with the 2 standards if you have Raptor. All I know is @tarzan is very happy with his raptor set up. I dont like the green wheel, and refer blue ones like Enertion if I can find them in 83 75a but the abec 11 flywheels are not cheap and hrd to get.

Idk man, I'm freaking out over here because I really hope 80a is good enough, I'd be using it on the GT mainly because I need 97mm but I *strongly* dislike green (or any neon color). For the Raptor, I will try using shock risers before anything else because I really don't want to buy another set. I wouldn't use my Raptor for my long range work commute, but probably my shorter, less bumpy after work ones. I say the longer the ride the more important it is. 

For reference, the BB wheels were 83a, which is pretty damn hard. They felt ok while going over really rough terrain, but that was probably cause of the flex. I imagine with no flex, the 80a would be fine. I'll have to compare them all. The evolve wheels are 76a so if that feels awesome I'll just bite the bullet and get the regular flywheels, but probably dye them black.

That's was what I was going to do. But then a bud suggested I google harder and I found some nice clones that are  already dyed. If I don't have to go through that process and spend money/time on dye I'd be happy. I will consider that route if it turns out I don't like them. Probably would sell them on here as @Dedbny suggested.

The boosted board wheels were actually 75mm 80a, NOT 83a.  I'm 100% sure of that.  http://orangatangwheels.com/in-heat-75mm

the orange ones are 80a, and I have photos of my boosted board wheels where it says 80a.  

The other thing is, the 80a on the orangatang wheels are actually gripper and plusher than other 80a wheels.  Orangatang had a wider contact patch and they specifically made those wheels for grip.  I think there is a video from loaded explaining those wheels on youtube somewhere.  

I think you just have to think of the raptor as the board to go fast on good pavement.  Works well for you since you have another board that can go anywhere and is being used for commuting.

My bad, I read it wrong on another site. Could've sworn it wasn't. The clones should be somewhat alright then, even if they're not as soft. 

What I'm realizing is that even when the pavement is shitty, it is usually only shitty for short patches of road. It's more important for me to have big wheels rather than soft because obstacles (man holes and the like) come up a lot more than rough pavement does. I guess it depends. The Raptor I would never take exploring because I have no idea what I'd be in for. I'd just probably keep it on the road 99% of the time since it's more predictable.

@Mr_Mahal  it is a bit my concern to that it might look strange to have a black board with blue trucks and green wheels it might have a bit of an lego appeal to it with that color mixture. I might spray paint my trucks

@Dedbny I might beginn with trying some softer risers before taking one out it would reduce my risk of instant death after buying this board :grinning:

so I will get some 83mm 75a abecs and some softer risers

thanks to all of you for your help

Depends on your board. If you have cut outs for the wheels like a lot of drop through boards, you don't need to worry much about clearance with spacers (though you may still want spacers for things like your mount or motor clearance).

I love the 97's on both my builds. On my non-dropthrough board, I needed nearly 1" spacers (maybe like 7/8" spacers) to give it enough clearance. Also had to make my trucks moderately tight, which I'm fine with since the board goes over 30mph. They take obstacles very well and you're not likely to come to a complete stop unless you're trying to go up a driveway lip that's over 2". Not much noticeable difference in torque between them and my 83mm wheels. One board is 78a and the other is 75a, though I can't really tell a difference between them either.

All in all, I'd recommend them for any board assuming you're okay with the extra weight and size, and if you have the clearance for it. My main gripes with it are the color and contact patch. I'd rather much have the contact patch of the Evolve GT (or kegel) wheels at 54mm. I'm also a bigger fan of the profile of the GT/kegel wheels.

[/quote]
I have 83mm wheels on my LecDec and one doubt I have is if it would be better with 90mm or even 97mm. I know that increasing the wheel size will have a negative impact in the longboard dynamics, like acceleration and braking. The ESC may not be able to handle the load also.

One plan I have is changing the motor mount to use bigger wheel pulleys with the 90 or 97mm wheels and increase torque but does the new riding experience justifies all the necessary work for this? Also it would be better if I upgraded to a VESC, this would guarantee a better experience for sure.

97's on the right deck is still my favorite setup.

With a GBomb/Subsonic setup using the deep drop brackets - it's about the same height as Boosted, but awesome ride quality w/ the brackets and big soft 97's absorbing bumps/cracks/small-children easily.
[img]https://goo.gl/pypMxk[/img]
Disadvantage of this setup between the heavy wheels and heavy aluminum brackets - weight.  

[img]https://goo.gl/tTh5Wz[/img]
example of ride height - pretty close - while also 97mm vs 75mm wheels, and w/ this setup (8s 8Ah - about 10-12mi vs boosted 4-5mi (my experience on his board)).

[img]https://goo.gl/rhkYQ3[/img]
i never got to finish enclosures and some wire cleanup - someone "borrowed" it out of my car when parked at work...  Great setup and one of my builds will duplicate w/ some improvements.  eventually.

Still love the 97's if you can find them, and don't mind the weight of the bigger wheels!

Hi Nate! I didn't extensively test them but at a glance with my truck setup, there wasn't enough clearance to run the 97s... I'm just overly cautious about wheel bite. You only need to get bucked off once to do everything in your power to never let it happen again lol :joy: 

I did just get another 1/2 inch hard raiser to give me piece of mind when I run the bigger wheels. Thanks for the input. Good to know you're running the big wheels without any issues. 

Cheers!

Hey there, you can't buy a Raptor 1 anymore from Enertion (I don't think). You can preorder the Raptor 2 or get a used Raptor from someone on this forum. I found someone with a new board they wanted to sell and snatched it up. You're in the right place on this forum! I'm sure you can find one here with low miles that's been well cared for.

Hope that helps!

Hey there,  so the raptor comes stock with 2 black risers on each truck. When I went up to 97mm wheels I added an extra 1/2" baby blue raiser to each truck and that gave me more than enough clearance to ride the 97mm flywheels. You probabaly could get away with less than a 1/2" riser but I don't like to take chances with wheel bite. My raptor now kinda feels like a lifted truck, but still feels extremely stable at 25+ mph. For me, the 97mm lifted setup is awesome! the extra clearance under the board is also a plus. Hope the info helps!

Cheers

So for a Raptor setup, the riser total height should be around 7/8" to 1" for 97mm flywheels and no wheel bite?

Also does an Enertion wheel pulley fit the 97mm flywheel?

Yes they will fit. The core of the flywheels don't change.

I got a cheap drop through for my 97mm flywheels - I LOVE the wheels and the change they have made to the ride ... cant even begin to tell how big of a difference they have made... I was looking at some cheap 97mm wheels on ebay for about 1/3 the price and wondering how much of a difference there would be ... but I think i need a better drop deck to get more clearance to avoid wheelbite completely even though it is hard to get it to happen right now.

I have original ABEC 11 90mm 75A and 97mm 75A clones from this group by. And the clones work like a charm. Very soft and so far i can not detect any signs that the get worn out. But i am also not a drifter. So i really can recommend them. But of course the originals also work like a charm.

Next group buy will have better quality wheels, from a 70% infill to a 90% which I reckon will be just as good as ABEC 11s

Just got a set of 97mm Flywheels but when I mount the wheel pulley (Enertion wheel pulley) I don't have enough thread left to screw the wheel nut on (the nut keeping the wheel from siding off the trucks)  

I'm using all Enertion gear trucks, motor and wheel pulleys etc. Do I require wider trucks with more thread or am I missing something obvious? Can upload photo's if it helps.

I have 97mm 78a Abec's which are super smooth compared to e.g. Enertion Power wheels. It's like day and night riding. However, I had to include a speed ring between Abec wheel bearing and Enertion pulley bearing. Otherwise the wheel wouldn't spin anymore ...? Must have been some gap between the tow bearings???

@Pato If your truck is made to accommodate Enertion wheels then you should be able to mount the flywheels as well. Are these clone flywheels?

No proper Abec 11 Flywheels. The mounting of the pulley to the wheel is fine, but I believe the pulley sits out a little more on the 97mm wheel then 83mm and I don't have enough thread for the end nut.

But hopefully I'm just doing something wrong.

What's the length of the axle (from hanger to axle tip)? Mine is about 41.5mm (1.63 inch) and the nut fits well, however, not much overhang. I am using 1.5 speed rings between the pulley bearing and the hanger ... so, maybe you would only need about 40.5-41mm

My wheel-pulley setup looks exactly the same.

Same thing is happening with me. Pretty annoying. I'm using Enertion trucks. I just tightened it all the way down and untightened it a tiny bit and it hasn't come loose yet. 🤞🏻

@Schulerbible Yeah I only have 35-36mm of length. Might have to do something like the following.

Yeah, I guess you have to cut it (7-8mm should do it). Don't cut into the axle!

Why not try these (currently on ebay) before buying any clones:

@Pato and @Schulerbible
Change your pulley setup on your motor.
Flip it around.

Make sure you align them good and tight.

I put a new set of 97mm Flywheels onto the Raptor I just finished repairing. tighten down the bushing a lot, no wheel bite...yet. But I go for wide turns and with the kicktail I would be able to make sharpers ones. I might add another riser.

I only rode it across the street from work to grab a coffee and it was night and day compared to the Enertion clones.

Do you know what Pulley Combo Kit is used here? I really like the all carbon fiber look. I'm upgrading the wheels on my RaptorV1 to the new Evolve GT street wheels (97MM, 76A) and may need some extra clearance as the wheels are slightly wider.
