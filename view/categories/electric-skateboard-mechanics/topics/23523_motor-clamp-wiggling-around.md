I own a LiftBoard dual. One of the motor mounts is wiggling around, and i was wondering how to tighten the clamp. Thanks

allen wrench, there should be three grub screws you can tighten

Where are the grub screws located, can you send a picture?

It should be on the motor mount, the screws go into the trucks. I have an older version (Benchwheel) so maybe they've redesigned some of the hardware since then.

The hardware is the same, just different battery and ESC

```
at least the wheel, depends if your hands/tools are small enough to fit without removing.

If there is only one, you could do a little Diy improvement by drilling and tapping a couple additional holes. Having 3 grub screws would be a definite improvement.

Is it okay to use an allen wrench?

It's ok. 
But you might want to take the screw out first and put some blue thread lock on it so that it doesn't come loose again.

Make sure you use the exact wrench size, less you strip your screws.

i believe @Jinra is referring to not stripping the hex head of the grub screw by using a good wrench that fits properly. 

And, "Don't worry, Be happy"
But check those screws periodically incase they get loose again.

Grub screws are shit. Weld that bastard on.

I went to a local welder, and ask him if he would weld my mounts on.
it took about 5 minutes total.  
He didn't even charge me,  I gave him $20 for his tine.

Grub screws can provide insane amounts of clamping pressure if done right. The diameter, thread engagement, orientation, and driven torque all contribute. If used properly they hold on tight forever.

I am glad they work for you, 
they caused me nothing but grief. 

Welding my motor mounts on to the trucks
has solved all my vibration related issues. 

I don't have to use locktite on everything anymore.

I can feel the ends of my fingers for the first time in years :)

The problem with welding motor mounts on aluminum trucks is that it weakens the truck hanger and could wind up causing it to bend or break unless the hanger is annealed after welding.

I have a single motor Liftboard and the whole motor bracket is loose too. Apparently the set screws backed out at some point and stripped out the holes to where I can't tighten the three set screws. The whole assembly is shot. Besides welding this to the truck itself, can I just put a new truck under there? I was thinking about a Caliber II truck with 44‚Å∞ angle and then putting after market motor bracket and using existing motor and pulleys. Any ideas?

Loctite 638, cure it for 24 hrs (that means leave it alone, do not even touch it)...Also....you can DIY almost everything in this world...

Ok. If Loctite doesn't work, do you think putting a new truck and motor mount would work? It looks to me that by putting a new truck and motor mount, I can just bolt up the existing board and motor to this set up and not have this problem again.
