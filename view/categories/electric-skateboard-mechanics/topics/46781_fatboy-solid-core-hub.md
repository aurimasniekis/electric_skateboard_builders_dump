Another product in design at the moment is solid CNC aluminium machined wheel hub.

It's more the case that plastic ones are really not balanced and gear is bit moving around on it so to make it perfect the full aluminum wheel comes on.

@Cobber I don't know yet nothing but I guess maybe 7075 T6

Are you going to spec. your own bearings for reference or run with the stock Trampa ones?
Do you think they could be part of the problem with the poor stock Trampa fit?

Will the hub be counter weighted for the valve stem?

We have talked about it, as the colors in place where we anodize them is pretty inconsistent so we thought about raw, black, or silver like inner gear drive train motor pulley it would make it scratch proof too and would look sick :)

Well.. CNC services in Germany/UK cost a bit more than CNC services in Lithuania, wouldn't you think? Just from the salary stand point. Though these days even in Lithuania some crazy dudes can ask prices which are above the moon.

Machining simplicity is way less important than machining time. Thats why even a very simple part jumps in price almost double if not more, even if a simplest slot has to be added from the bottom/side (if you have to reposition the work piece during machining).

But then again that can change if the same part is made over and over - if the machinist has a jig.

Anyways...who cares.. what and why am i even writing here. hah.

There will be options also for longboard bearings (22mm x 8mm x 7mm). Also choice for either 6082 T6 or 7075 T6 (lighter, but more expensive).

Plus at the moment we are at work for Trampa SuperStar hub aluminum plates for longboard bearings, so you could fit Trampa wheels on longboards (Then maybe in future there will also be mouting set of our drivetrains for longboard trucks :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)

There is not yet exact price, but should be around 200‚Ç¨/set (4 wheel hubs)

some folk swear by tiny beads in the tube, trampa suply a glueable weight as well and advise placing opposite the valve, which destroys the idea of wheel balancing as art

Colour an bearing size?

On the one hand raw or a clear anodize stays looking good the longest as chips and scratches show up less... I still vote for black though.

I think there are two markets for bearing size. 
1. People replacing their superstars who want a bolt on replacement for a Trampa
2. AT wheels for regular eSk8's

I'm sure you know all this already, people who own a trampa already have deep pockets so I'd do black 12mm wheels first then try the 8mm option when you get some momentum in a second production run.

have you ridden a unbalanced 8 inch wheel dude?

I have and once veloicity begins to increase it is shity, it adds to the tendancy of the trampa decks to buck and it makes me more choppy on the trigger. Even just comming off the gas at high speed makes a trampa buck...

I balance mine with ceramic beads atm.

Ok some news about the hub. 

The prices are going to be:

* 200‚Ç¨ for bare aluminium set of 4 wheels
* 250‚Ç¨ for painted (black, silver, whitish or more specific colour if needed but will need a group buy for it) it will be powder coating using car rim paints.

Also later I will add some pictures of 3 and 6 poles design available.

Regarding plates I mentioned for original Trampa wheels for 8mm bearing is not worth making as the price of wheel hub + two plates will be the same as whole new wheel hub ;)

how does the bearing fit in the bearing seat after coating? trampa states that they re-machine the bearing seat after anodising but that step seems to have been skipped of late, hence the poor fit...

So 28mm bearing version is available to buy currently in raw aluminum as we thought to paint them to your own color like using plasti dip paints it's much easier than providing only several colors and making it more expensive.

We are currently working on 22mm bearing size with ET offset so it would fit normal 8-10mm trucks and would not cause problems.

Kugy, I was thinking about how to install my new FatBoy precision hubs and come to the conclusion if you also offered some precision bearing spacers so I could get rid of the rubber o-rings Trampa use to make up for their sloppy fit that would be :+1:

Here‚Äôs what would be #1 on my wishlist for a design mod -

In researching 9‚Äù tire options there seems to be only Trampas Primo hub or the fivestar hubs from MBS available.

Neither of which has a geared drive option from any vendor afaik.

Not sure what Trampa does to their hub, it does look like they have a second lip
https://www.trampaboards.com/primo-3-spoke-composite-hub--for-9-inch-wheels-p-10079.html
but MBS has a second lip shown in the product page
https://www.mbs.com/parts/13211-mbs-fivestar-hub-1-white

If this could be incorporated it would be a killer stroke, it‚Äôs metal that would be be milled off anyway and it allows 8‚Äù tires too.

Please consider it since I really want the off-road ability of a 9‚Äù tire with a geared drive, I can‚Äôt be the only one

Mine are already suffering, I use them on the beach my fault. But they also get hit by the odd rock, and I'd like to take them up a stoney road to a lake but the feet are already getting killed by just worn off road tarmac. I can put some rubber pads down but I think the solution is 9" for sure and the that will also solve my beach traction issues

The spurs are getting quite some abuse from sand ingress, if there were a way to seal the gap on the drives this would be perfect

Good question!

I'm on 8" Superstars with Black Alpha 8 Inch Tyres - all purpose tires which were the beefiest tire option when buying Superstars
http://www.trampaboards.com/primo-alpha--premium-8-inch-all-purpose-dirt-tyres--p-12115.html

Temporarily I could maybe go to Trampa 8" mudpluggers for more grip
http://www.trampaboards.com/innova-mudplugger--8-inch-soft-packed-dirt-tyre-p-12120.html

But yes, I can only start off in hard packed sand, and that sucks, in saying that there is plenty of hard packed sand and I'm spoiled for long, wide beaches. I get going and try to find the best sand, keeping spped up is imperative to not losing the plane on the sand.

These narrrow, small tires like to dig in and when they do like in this 52km get-off you can see the 'launch pattern' & 'landing zone' here, it included what must have been a spectacular flip

I just got message from @3DServisas that he started making design for 9" tire. Also I know there will be 1:5/4 gear drive with fully enclosed for hardcore off-road/beach stuff. Just what you would like :) 

@Nordle it's inner gear drive. The whole outer case moves so no place to mount v-grove. The only thing I imagine is attach some kind of lip on top of baseplate to hide straight entry inside the gear.

Nope, still single :) In our first drives before inner gear we used bought gears the same as etoxx uses in his design which provided inflexibility with designs, and as at the moment we can cut out our own gears we used different parameters to make them smaller with a better meshing parameters cutting down the overall size by almost 5cm

Also combine this with 9" tire and you have almost 8cm of clearance...

Need to bear in mind drive clearance for these 9" tires. Not sure the sneak peek model takes this into consideration.

I do have some old Scrub hubs which take 9" tires, the actual hubs are a little larger in diameter than the other Scrub hubs that take 8" tires

...something to bear in mind there may need to be a little research

Don't know if this would impact the choice of motor lengthwise

MBS T2 linked above

![image|690x253](upload://mVOTUCBtALrvyvIcBijQ7SOkdwh.jpg)

This type of tire again is commonly used on mobility scooters and hand trucks

Maybe this model helps
https://grabcad.com/library/rim-for-9x3-50-4-tire-1

Would sure be useful to have some 9" tires on hand to ensure they work and stay on the rim

From my ride time on the gummies i'd say they were well above my expectations, wear and tare is very low and never got wheel bites or chips on em. But when riding bigger wheels, pneus just offers the peak comfort, that and the ability to plow thru curbs and potholes is just way to valueble imo. Unless the board is street specific with nice pavement, I'm never going back to thane.

[/quote]

I was at the exact same mindset as you, switching to gummies is going to be nice and I can pick and choose as I like between the two etc. Just the amount of vibration that vanishes from using pneus makes life alot easier and even tho i took great care when building everything into the enclosure, I dont even worry on tearing on the stuff inside from vibrations etc. Which is also a huge plus.

The only downside I have noted with the pneus is that they're slightly larger in diameter and are bouncier. So the energy needed to propell forward is higher. Something I noticed on battery time. I had alot more range on the gummies.

And Kug3lis has the same size hub for all the euro peeps.  This would actually provide a new product instead of just an alternative to an already existing product.

Obviously both would be awesome, but if it is just one at first, go with the one that doesn't already have a counterpart.....

I would preorder 2 or 3 sets right now!

You guys let me know which hubs you're keen on and we can see what we can work out if anyone is interested in urethane for them.

Yeah definitely! don‚Äôt get me wrong on the size, I think they‚Äôre really good just that I figured you can‚Äôt get those quality tires and tubes on bigger hubs like these.

I‚Äôd go and buy a set without a doubt if I already don‚Äôt have the fatboy hubs that came with the drives I picked up.

Are these available somewhere? Can't seem to find them. Would your inner gear drive train work with them (how much clearance is left with a 6inch wheel)?

Hi, sorry but those 2.9" wheel hubs have completely different mounting holes and etc so its only available right now for 1:3 gear drive. If you interested in getting them separately its possible to make with custom holes for what ever you want. If you want we can also make a pulley for it. Just need information what is needed. 

P.S. Inner gear drive needs 8" tires as clearance is pretty low. Its more for 1:3 gear drives :)

Cup of coffee?

The 1/2 ton arbor was ‚Ç¨43 on eBay with free shipping to uk, ‚Ç¨8 shipping reroute by our national post which give a uk post address, so ‚Ç¨50 to my door. Axminster I think, but they are all pretty much they same shipped in from China

Hi @3DServisas Just a FYI.

The wheels are super, I am waiting on some T2 tires for them.

Having an arbor press now and have gotten the bearings into the first wheel, but I hit a snafu, 

If you don't get the bearings installed (already had them) then watch which spacers you use. I tried a spacer out of a Scrub wheel and it comes to 18.36mm, which is too long.

I looked at the Trampa options but closest is 18.2mm.
https://www.trampaboards.com/12mm-spacers--shims-c-1007.html

Wondering how long the spacers are that you use?

@banjaxxed were you able to find a spacer with 17.4mm ?....did not found any on that exact dimension on aluminiumspacers.com

Found this one...i think i will buy it....little smaller though...but i think it's fine...it's minimal: OD 15.88mm, ID 10.2mm, L 17.15mm

Could always buy an 18mm spacer and use a belt sander to massage it down to 17.4mm
