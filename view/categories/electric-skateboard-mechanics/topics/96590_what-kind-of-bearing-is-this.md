Im googling different bearing sizes but cant get this kind to show up! Swear everything I search looks the same and not like this. Any pointers would be appraciated. Ive measured internal and external dimensions but still nothing like this shows up. Thanks team!

Hey I found it!! 61905-2Z Bearing 25x42x9 Shielded Ball Bearing. I think I misunderstood how the bearings were named. I was searching for 25429 bearings, because I thought it was ID, OD, then Width. 

Thank you!!
