I have decided to get an e-toxx drive for my Trampa.
The enclosed belt drive has been stellar so far but I am after the reduced drag of the gear drive as well as more ground clearance and the ability to go for even shorter gearing.

My options are:

Mini Direct Drive

Advantages:
* Improved ground clearance, something which I need due to the rocky terrain I ride on.
* Reduced weight

Disadvantages
* Shorter gear ratio available is 5:1(similar to what I have now) which means that there is no way to switch to 9in wheels in the future.
* Can't use 10mm motor shaft with 8mm pinion gear

Maxi Direct Drive

Advantages:
* Shorter gear ratio available is 6.25:1 .
* Can use 10mm motor shaft with 10mm pinion gear (for 5:1 ratio)
* Can be used with 80mm motors

Disadvantages
* Worse ground clearance  (by how much???)
* Heavier (by how much???)

What would you do?
Do you have any info on ground clearance and weight for the Maxi Direct Drive?

I always thought the mini gd is 1:4 and the regular 1:5 gear ratio :thinking: that´s as min what´s written on the website for the trampa version.

The 1:6.25 I thought is only available for matrix2 trucks.

The mini gear drive is less than 1kg.
I have no idea what is the weight of the regular drive, but I´m sure @rich can help you out with that.

These are the standard gear ratios.

However, Jens can provide the mini with an 8T motor gear thus 8:40 = 1:5 ratio and the maxi with an 8T motor gear thus 8:50=1:6.25 ratio. Both are available for Trampa trucks.

I decided to go with the mini drive.
My board is already too heavy and switching to 9" will make it even heavier, not too mention the additional cost.

The mini drive will give me the clearance that I need for the terrain I ride and may even shed a few grams.

Now who wants a Trampa enclosed belt drive in good condition (with a bashed bash guard?) :grin: Make me an offer, I will make it worthwhile.

I have the mini helical 1:5 on Matrix 2's with 8mm shaft motors. I believe the main difference is that when you get down to the 8t gear, there isn't enough room for a keyway, so it's grub screws only.

When you ride on rocky terrain with really big stones the mini gear drive seems better because of ground clearance. The normal gear drive has about 3.8cm ground clearance with 8" and I guess weights a few hundred gramms more. I would buy some drive guards and you are ready to ride like there is no tomorrow :sunglasses:

Just my praise of the mini drive as a fellow customer.. its pretty great lol. Ive had mine at least a year(i wish it had more ride time on them), and its solid. Ive had mounting screws and other parts( ALL due to my own dumbassery) come lose and it doesnt careXD The mini drive is a good choice especially for a rock board
