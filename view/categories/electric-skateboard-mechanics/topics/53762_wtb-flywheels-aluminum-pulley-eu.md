Is anyone selling wheel pulleys in EU or maybe you have a spare? ðŸ˜Š

Looking for 38t, but 40t would probably be fine, and should be calibers compatible. 15 mm

I had a nylon pulley delaminate on me after one ride, so unless that was just a real bad print I'd rather not go 3d printed again..

Why steel? Aluminium would be just fine!

The thing is I have to order 500pcs at once to get good price, maybe I could do a pre-order for this?
