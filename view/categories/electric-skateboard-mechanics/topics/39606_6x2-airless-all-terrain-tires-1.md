Found the factory for those airless 6x2 all-terrain tires DIYeboards has been hawking for $88.

I don't see them in the right size on this site but if anyone's feeling enterprising it'd be interesting to see how cheap we could get them. Cheap flatless tires that would fit on these hubs, anyone?

They are close, but the tread and hole pattern is pretty dissimilar.  If available in the right size it might work, but it's not the same wheel.

Likely they have the proper size. Just send them a message and ask if they carry that SKU.

I do see differences in tread, but I think the differences in circles are mainly just angle/smaller wheel. Either way I'm still willing to bet they come from the same place.

I've sent off an email, I'll update the thread when/if they get back to me. 

@mmaner, did you ever try those airless tires on 6x2 hubs? I can't remember if I read about that or not. I'd think they'd fit standard 6x2 hubs like psycotiller's sixshooters, but I might be wrong on that point

@psychotiller there's a polyurethane also. They have the moulds so probably can do them with many different materials.
Maybe this can fit your six shooters?

Nice find @aponty, also like the blue ones @LukePL posted, the 8x2 would be nice for me. But I'm afraid this is 2 good 2 be true. I think the rolling resistance will be extremely high, especially with foam inside which makes it soft.

I only have experience with 5" solid rubber wheels with foam. I tested it without motors and the first time I pushed the board I almost fell forward because of the monster rolling resistance. Then I went up a hill and I had to push downward because they act like brakes, I felt like an idiot, so embarrassing :laughing:

Hey all, they got back to me- apparently the tire in the link I attached is actually made out of TPU, not PVC as it says in the title, and they don't have a mold for 6x2, but could put one together easily. So it looks like it's not the same factory after all.

Long story short, if we want to do a groupbuy for 500 (125 sets, that's a fair few) we could get them for $3.10/wheel, or $12.40 a set.

Fitting them to trampa axels will be a matter of the hubs you put them on, basically. I think you could do it by just finding the right bearing, which I'm sure is out there somewhere, but might take some looking.

Personally I'm more interested in finding a way to 3d print some TPU tires for 6x2 hubs, which I think is definitely possible. But if anyone's interested in a group buy I'd lend a hand, though I'm not exactly an expert on these things

Additional info about them is hardness range they can offer is from 65 to 90.
If we could make it happen I'm in for at least 3 sets. How about size? Maybe 5 inch? :D

Nominating @thisguyhere 

I'd pitch in to help with the group buy, but my hands are currently full with handling the Banshee's product launch.

Curious side note, a factory does not simply 'put together a mold'. Molds cost money, so that means they want retooling cash upfront, or they do in fact have access to the mold in some shape or form.

Yeah, seems odd. But maybe that's covered by the 500 minimum order?

also, @LukePL I vote sticking with 6x2 so it fits those 3d printed hubs. They're the cheapest/most accessible way to get an AT setup that I know of

Potentially. Have you asked them about the exact formula they would use? Can we designate our own specific tire formula?

Honestly 1500 USD barely covers the molds.

That's a great idea. Better yet, I might be able to design and print a set of hubs to match my existing bearings. I'm confused though as to what material would be best suited for it, and whether I can print it on my prusa i3.

I'd read through that thread I linked in my first post, apparently @Maxid has had great success in ABS, and I think I saw him recommend PLA as well- basically, they're strong enough in whatever, so long as you have a print bed large enough to make them

so hubs for these wheels are still in question, right?

let's say hubs are found, great.  what about pulleys?  i mean, it'd have to be a matching pair right, hubs and pulleys, so they can be bolted together?

if you guys decide to do a 500 ct group buy, all the parts should be sourced first.

expecting each person to source their own hubs and pulleys or sprockets and all associated parts is going to be giant pain, and will ultimately attract less demand.

if it's a complete plug and play system, i bet you could clear 500, or 125 sets pretty quickly.

What are some good hubs to get?

i really can't answer that, haven't done AT wheels yet.

it appears @mmaner is the only one with any experience with these tires, and he mated them to psychotiller pnumi hubs that he happened to have lying around (correct me if i'm wrong).

we can't get just the hubs from psychotiller because they come as a set with tires.

maybe ask the tire mfg and see if they can source hubs as well.  then see if those hubs can be mated to any pulleys or sprokets.  then if that comes together, be sure to source motor pulley / sproket as well.  then the belt / chain.

I'm running a set of blue 6in airless wheels on the @psychotiller 6 Shooters (v1 / Wobblies) and my kid is running a set of purple 6in airless wheels @psychotiller 6 Shooters (v2 / Retail).  Neither of us has any issue at all.  Mine feel a little looser against the hub than my kids, but they don't roll sideways or skew, so all is good.

The airless wheels are great. Not as comfortable as nummies but pretty close and grippy like glue. I think they wouldn't be as good without the offset 6 shooters

I've got a fever and the only cure is more TPU

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2283936

I'm just trying to find things to make TPU out of I haz too much.

@High-roller the i3 will handle TPU just fine you just need a direct drive extruder or if you have a bowden tube need the bowden tube going through the extruder so the filament has no where to bend/flex before getting to the hot end.  Hot end only needs to be 190-210C

---

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:275593

^^ I use a slightly modified version of this where the tube can go all the way through and just have a notch cut in the side of the tube where the driving gear/pulley can push the filament down the tube.

print the 6x2 hubs and a tire to go around them and let me know how it works! Ugh I'm waiting on my printer in the mail and it's killing me. Can't wait to start trying things out. 

also @PredatorBoards 125 is a lot, but maybe we should put together a google doc to start getting some numbers in place.

@thisguyhere I'm not sure about the hub-pulley situation. It seems like this 6x2 hub is fairly standard; you can print them, have someone else print them, get some from psycotiller, get a set of hubs from diyeboard, etc. I think nailing that down is going to be a pain, have too many options, and likely stall everything. Maybe see if we can get people in for 125 sets and take it from there? It's a big number to reach I know

I just got my printer dialed in and after my skateboard wall mounts finish printing I will be printing the 6" hubs (hopefully this weekend) in PLA, as strong as these wall mounts are I don't see why the wheels wouldn't be strong enough. If these tires will for sure fit these hubs I would be interested in 3 sets.

What ever happened with these airless tires? Does @pschotiller stock an airless option? I have the diyeboard with the green 6" airless but I am worried about them slipping at high speeds and don't want to drill holes in the hubs for plastic zip tie or interfere with the pulleys. Anyone figure out who is making these things with urethane and not foam etc...![IMG_20180111_113625166|690x388](upload://c0gqkGlqHhylUkEzdepsa0s1YcU.jpg)

Sorry for the necro, but I was looking at products from the same seller listed in the main post and found polyurethane tires instead of PVC:
https://triathlon.en.made-in-china.com/product/dXvnQeglZRrO/China-Solid-PU-Trolley-Handtruck-Wheel-2-50-4-3-50-4-4-00-8.html

There are also rubber tires:
https://triathlon.en.made-in-china.com/product/ZvSnmyLACrpF/China-Solid-Rubber-Trolley-Handtruck-Wheel-2-50-4-3-50-4-4-00-8.html


Now, if you would buy these, how would you exactly put a pulley on this thing? Also, that hub that is included looks like it won't fit with many builds when judging looks, so by then we'd need a better core.
