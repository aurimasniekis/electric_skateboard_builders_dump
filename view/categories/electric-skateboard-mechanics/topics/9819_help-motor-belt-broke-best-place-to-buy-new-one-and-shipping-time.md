Hey guys, i just recently broke my 9mm belt. im using the 50mm aliendrive system pulley so the 9mm enertion belt should do, just wondering if i can get it anywhere else and @onloop how fast can you ship the belts to melbourne? thanks

Find a local supplier, Polybelt in NJ gets to NYC within 2 days usually.
