If you put carbon all around the antenna it won't work. If its just the enclosure mounted to the wooden deck its fine. 
If i understand correctly your deck is also carbon and you want a carbon enclosure so no, not good.  There will definitely be interferences with the signal.

If you have a reciever with an external antenna you could make a small hole in the enclosure for the antenna to stick out.

I have a wood deck and carbon enclosure, no problems with remote connection. FYI youâ€™ll probably want more than one layer of carbon. I do one layer of fiberglass and three layers of carbon fiber with another layer of carbon fiber strips to reinforce the area where the mounting screws will go.

What you need to do is make the receiver antenna stick out of the enclosure

My receiver/antenna is inside my carbon enclosure. Two years with no issues at all with my gt2b or nano-x.

Nope. It's a wood deck. But on my Raptor 1 (Carbon fiber deck) I didn't have any issues with either remote.
