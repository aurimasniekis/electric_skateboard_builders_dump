I'm in Indiana! Would you be able to ship me one? I'm checking at Ace today, but if they don't have it I'll likely take you up on the offer.

I tried to get key stock at my local true value hardware but they didn't have metric sizes

You could also just use a square nail or something. I have personally used it in the past. I have never had problems with it.

These are what i use. I have a tiny drawer full of them. Dirt cheap, enertion compatible and compatible with anything using 3mm keyways over 16mm long. Typical length is 18mm, my motors have 18mm keyways and so do the R-SPECs and similar motors.

Grainger, McMaster, Fastenal, I think even amazon carries machine keys.
