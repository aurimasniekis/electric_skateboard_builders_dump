I was looking over my order from battery supply and noticed that I bought the 45A continuous BMS. The 60A was only $3 more but I guess I didn't see it. 

My board has:
6S4P LG HE2 Pack
2 6354 270KV SK3s

Should I continue with this BMS or is the continuous amp rating too low?

I would get the 60amp. 6S draws more amps than a higher voltage.

Well dang. Looks like I'll be waiting another month for it to ship from China.

I see. If you were running 10s+ I'd say you could just stick with your 45A one.
