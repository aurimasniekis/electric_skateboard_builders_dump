After some light use my torqueboards motor became a little more stiff than usual when I just turn it by hand. It also developed a light grinding noise like there is sand it in. I only rode it on paved roads. This happen to anyone else?

Dirt, sand, maybe a broken magnet.  Probably need to pull it apart and see the damage.  Can search on this forum. Someone has pulled apart a motor before.

Sometimes, you can see it against light and turn the motor see if anything is obstructing it. Check the bearings possibly, I like to add more bearing oil and everything spins smoother after cleaning everything.

@fuzzyspikes - You can just check it first.. If you can't see anything or notice it then yeah, you may need too.

You can use a bright light to look inside as best you can.  After that you have to take it apart
