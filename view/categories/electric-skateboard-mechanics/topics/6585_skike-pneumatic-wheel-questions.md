Hi.  

I'm in the process of research for my first esk8 board and I've been reading lots and lots of amazing info on here.  I think I've got most of it in my head/spreadsheet.  One question I do have is on the Skike pneumatic wheels, as I've got a Beercan boards Oat Soda deck already I think for ground clearance reasons that going for pneumatic wheels is going to be the best choice.  Now I've seen others using these wheels and then bring me to my two questions.

Do these fit the caliber trucks without modification?  If they need maching that's not a problem, but I'd like to know before I order them.

Does anyone do a hub drive adapter for these wheels or will I have to get one machined?

These 5in Skike wheels were the ones I was going to go for as they are relatively low cost and available in the EU.  I've seen several Beercan builds with these I believe.

Many thanks

you will need to remove 1cm from one side of the wheel to hold the bearing and be able to still mount them on a standard skateboard truck.
Look at this from endless-sphere to get an idea of what i mean (and have recently done myself):
See the top left wheel!
http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s621/richard_bailey1/20141211_211751_zps12e3d9c4.jpg
The wheel is 34mm from one side to the other with 2x7mm bearings so 20mm in between.
This needs to be made to 10mm.
In the end you need 7mm for the inner bearing, 10mm for the spacer and another 7mm for the 2nd bearing.
With a lathe this is done easily

Thanks that's really helpful.  I'm assuming this needs to be done to all four wheels not just the one with the pulley?

Thanks.  I wonder if Alien Drive Systems still make those pulley's.  They seem to have stopped making anything now with everything being over at Alien Power Systems.

I think they don't. It should be relatively easy however to 3D print one yourself. I am designing one right now but with 50teeth as I have a 20t pulley on my 149kv motor.

I'd worry about 3d printed parts holding up to the stress of things.  I have a printer here so the cost factor would be great but still.

the larger your pulley the better for 3D printing as the stress on a single tooth decreases. I'd risk it especially because metal pulleys also get super heavy at this size.

I have some old sets of these skike wheels if you guys wanted them. I just don't have any pulleys for them. PM me if you need it.

@gordy you can also get a 50T 9mm polycarbonate pulley from SDP/SI for ~$8-9 and just drill 5 holes to match with skike.

Once that's done, make a trip to home depot and get yourself some 2 inch machine screws and nuts that fit through the hole and bolt them together, and boom--you got yourself a DIY drive wheel.

ABS
You want the file? Again 50t might not work for you - you should calculate your desired number of teeth first.
Also you will need a new belt due to the huge diameter.
I used this calculator: http://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/

If you have the file that would be awesome.  I think I may have tracked down a 60t one, but it would be nice to have a fallback.

I could make you a 60t one if you want. All that changes is the outer diameter - so i don't have to change the design much.

You are running too close with the Belt to the tire. You should not forget that the tires become wider when You will inflate them! You will always grind the Belt at the tire and get an inefficient system. You have to replace the Belt every time... 
So keep in mind that you will need some distance between the hub and  the pulley. Maybe you make im the 3d file a Wall on  both sides of the Belt. 17 mm wide for a 15 mm Belt,  Pulley 14 / Belt 12, Pulley 11 / Belt 9 to gain 2 mm spare space for the Belt to work properly ;)
Edit: you can print this one again with 2-4 mm and put both sides Next to each other that you get the described pulley.

Good point - I did not think about that. On the other hand I will be running a 9mm belt (which could already fit - will measure tomorrow after work) and could just put some spacer rings between rim and pulley if necessary.

Looks to me like it will work just fine. The wheel does not actually become wider than the rim when inflated.

Image works here - what part is that from Alien Drive / can you paste the link? 

Actually emailed them a day or two ago about pulleys to go with Skike wheels; they redirected me to Alien Power about it, haven't got around to mailing them yet.. 

To be honest though I'll probably try the 3D printed route first - cheaper and easier, especially if you get it wrong first time.. 

Played around with the 'speed calcs' google doc posted somewhere here - given the 5"=128mm wheel diameter, ended up with: 170kv, 50T/12T, 8S, for a fairly low 17MPH speed, I don't need much and can always change ratios later - haven't looked very much into batteries yet, so that might still change..)

I bought them on these pages after emailing to check stock levels

Hub Adapter
http://aliendrivesystems.com/product/urban-5-hub-adapter/
Showing out of stock now, I believe I bought the last one.  I don't know whether there are any more being made.  If you do get one made let me know as I may want to go dual drive in the future.

Hub Pulley
http://aliendrivesystems.com/product/hub-pulley-wheels/

I went for 9mm 60T

I'm not 100% sure yet.  What I have got so far is the deck
Beercan Boards Oat Soda 36in
https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8651/28432256525_2552cc1de8_k.jpg

Trucks will be Caliber II's in black.
Wheel's and Tires the 5in Skike's
Alien Power Motor and Bracket.  6355 Motor 

I am then going for some kind of VESC and 10's batteries.  To be decided on those though.

Yeah saw that on another thread - very, very nice indeed :slight_smile:

Was also looking at the Alien stuff, as they're UK-based (import taxes are a killer), but have heard on here their ESCs have a bit of a bad rep, so maybe only some motors from them (they look good, and have a machined keyway / I don't really have the tools to do that).

In case it helps, I found this VESC in the UK: on the minus side, bit of an unknown quantity, on the plus side, allegedly has a few upgrades, pre-installed heat sink, comes ready heat-shrinked and so on..

Best-offer of £100 was accepted and it's on the way.

(should probably move some of this discussion over to a new thread, but I guess like you, the wheels are my first port of call..)

Depending on courier and sending country you can sometimes get lucky on import duties.  It's painful when you get the bill though!

Until the other bits arrive I will leave the VESC decision.  Hopefully by then there will be a clearer picture of who to go for!

So my wheels have turned up.  They look great, but will need the machining done before I can fit them.  I got a few spares just in case of problems.

Well, one ruined Skike hub later - no, you can't do this by with a Dremmel :grin: 

(cutting off the rim went fine, but you also need to remove some of the inner plastic spacer, and that's very tricky to do evenly, and without unintentionally widening the hole that the bearing sits in)

Shame Alien Drive aren't doing these any more, guess I'll just have to wait for Psychotiller/DIY-ES wheels to be available..

I grabbed an old school enertion set of AT hubs and gears a while back and ran the skike wheels on them... with a hard gear ratio.....I didn't have enough power with that set up 8s lipo and one motor. 

I've been thinking of rebuilding the Madrid board to be more all terrain when I get some 10s4p packs up and running ( never enough time).

Been thinking two enertion r specs, torque board ESCs and a 10s4p battery ought get me range and power I needs....

Bought out alien drive when they were unloading wheels and tubes so should have enough for a year or so. Careful with these tires you won't get but 150-200km out of a set when carving on pavement.......tons of fun though

Not far off completion.  Just need to find some time to do with wiring and make a cover.  I'm not using the Skike wheels now as they give too much wheel bite with my deck sadly.
