Dealing with vibration and the results of vibration has been an ongoing saga for me. In my area, there are not a lot of freshly paved roads, and since I prefer urethane over pneumatics, i have had to deal with some interesting issues as a result of all the vibration. 

Losing screws is a problem that is easily solved with plenty of thread locker. You just have to remember to always use it no matter what. Just making a minor adjustment? Clean and reapply threadlocker. Major adjustments? complete rebuilds? poking around for no real reason? Always clean the area and reapply threadlocker. I like to use rubbing alcohol to clean my screws before application. 

Hot glue can also keep things from rattling too much and coming loose. I like to a run a bead of hot glue across the seams of my charging port when i have to remove it and put it back. It has large threads and a slim nut that easily works its way loose after a while on the street. A little glue on the threads and a little between the case and the nut ties it down nicely. I also like to use it on the tiny nuts and bolts that hold my volt meter in place, and since i'm running a metal box, i often run a bead along the seams of the end caps to keep things together just in case the thread locker fails and the screws start to back out a little. This keeps the aluminum plates from rattling against the steel threads on the screws which can act like a saw and start cutting through the aluminum. 

Thick industrial adhesive two way tape is also pretty great for fastening things into your box or onto the bottom of your deck directly when just using a lid. It provides decent shock and vibrational absorption while also keeping your component securely in place. I can't say I've ever had my battery pack or ESC come loose and flop around in my box and I only use two way tape to keep them fastened down. 

But what about feet? My feet can can go numb after an hour of riding, so shoes are important. Normally I wear airwalk high tops, but i'm probably going to either get some nice gell insoles or start wearing more cushy shoes like nike airs or something. 

How do you guys deal with vibration issues when building and riding?

The topic of shoes is an interesting one! I might actually create a new topic on this!

I actually found the nike running shoes to be really comfortable for riding.. the "magic" foam they use to make the sole of the shoe is really good at dampening the vibrations.

One thing that I think could be developed to reduce vibrations is some specially designed truck risers.. Maybe they can be molded out of the same magic stuff nike use for the running shoes!

I think if you can effectively minimize the vibration entering into the deck from the trucks it will make a huge difference.

Both are great suggestions by Onloop. I have a few different boards with different wheels. Generally I know where I'll be riding. My pneumatics are great for all surfaces though and I have no complaints on their rolling resistance with my matco tires.

Yeah... you definitely can't beat pneumatics for smoothness & vibration dampening! ... maybe a hover board is better.

I've been tempted to switch over to pneumatics but i'm a little shy of the ride height and handling differences. 

As far as shock absorbing risers, I have a set of somewhat squishy 1/8" risers that i've tried but they don't seem to mitigate too much of the foot numbing action. Here's a link to some options though:
[http://www.thelongboardstore.com/categories/risers/shock-risers.html][1]

Maybe some thicker ones would do the trick? I think the secret to ride comfort may be in the shoes, but the secret to lower maintenance may be in a gooier shock riser. 

Or it could even be in the deck. Most decks are layered veneer, like rock maple. But when pressing decks out of carbon fiber or fiberglass, the option to add in a layer of shock absorbing material might present itself in a number of ways, such as using different varieties of foam core.

For vibration bolts - I don't have that problem too much. Since my main mounts are welded I don't have to worry about that too much.

I'm not sure about my new bolt on. I'll be testing it soon but I don't doubt that screws will most likely become loose.

As far as the vibration on feet. I find putting less pressure when riding on your feet helps also closing your wider stance to a more closer stance helps on the front end of the board.

I also tend to hop off and walk my feet for a few seconds and that usually fixes the numbing issue. I just wait until my feet are able to relax a bit.

I also like to add some real soft 1/8th risers to absorb some of the shock.

I think comfy shoes would be key but I also think majority of happens to be stance and foot pressure/placement when riding.

A lot of numbness complaints are from foot/ankle weakness. Building the feet/ankle stronger allows the rider to relax more and shift pressure around to prevent hotspots. Same in regular skateboarding and most other sports.

Roads and pavements where I live are really not good, the worst in terms of vibrations are brick paved paths and rough asphalts, and bigger and softer wheels (from 83mm 90a with hubs to 83mm 80a and belt drive and especially now w/ 97mm 80a) helped a lo-ooot! Also they help against gaps and small steps because I don't have a kicktail. Ok the board is higher but I don't pass 20mph so often, especially when commuting, I'll be looking at abecs 97mm 75a to see the difference when I get some spare $$ and maybe a faster and lowe board when I become more skilled ^^. Also changing stance, going switch and repositioning the back foot help a lot.

This made me think why changing from topmount to dropthrough increased the vibrations for me. Its the fact that the board is supported by the screws directly instead of the riser pads, like in the topmount. Maybe i can get something between the bottom of the screw and the deck.

This is one thing I noticed switching from a soft flexy loaded vanguard to the stiff LHB scarlet deck.  I like super stiff decks for high speed, but man on bad roads your feet really start to feel it.  I've been using running shoes that help out, and the 83mm 80a flywheel clones help...but still, if anyone has any other ideas let me know.  If anything I'm just more paranoid about screws coming loose.

I had already ordered some khiro spacers and they arrived yesterday! 

The weight of the deck on a dropthrough rests on the bottom of the screws not the truck plates. Sounds counterintuitive but if I want vibration dampening these should go on the bottom sandwiched between the bolts and the deck, not on top between the deck and the truck plate.

I thought so too, but if you think about it, mechanically the load is on the bolts. Therefore the dampening should be between the deck and the bolts.

I played around with using rubber grommets and washers to lessen vibration.

It does work for a while but the rubber starts breaking down and allowing too much movement for good control.

Now I just run 97's and use a 1/4" shock pad.

Going from 90mm to 97mm abec clones really reduced a lot of vibration

Larger and softer wheels certainly help reduce vibration. However, the 97mm flywheels are fairly heavy. My goal is to reduce the weight as much as possible and have a nice controlled and comfortable ride. I'm actually reducing wheel size from 90mm to 83mm!

I have a few of these vibration dampeners from the camera gimbal of my phantom:

I've been trying out a layer of 1/2" foam in place of grip tape, cut from 24" foam flooring squares, and it seems to noticeably lessen vibrations, while also being quite grippy. Main problem so far is that the double sided tape I'm using isn't quite strong enough. It's fine while riding, but comes loose when it's sitting for too long. Might try hot glue next.

I must say, the biggest impact came from my board flex. comparing my tesseract to my vanguard, its like comparing a stiff f1 car to a wobbly old american V8 cruiser. usually i dont like old US movie cars, but riding the vanguard is really super smooth, it just eats up all the cracks and bumps, much more enjoyable to ride than my tesseract on bad pavement and I feel like I also have more grip when carving. :open_mouth:

2nd biggest impact is really the wheel. you really want tons of urethane, which is why I really dont like kegels all that much, its why Im really sceptical about hub motors and its why I really love my 90mm 75A flywheels. :slight_smile:

I always use shockpads, but they make only a very minor difference imo! softer bushings and pivot cups also helps!

against rattling I usually have felt sheets in my enclosures and I also add double adhesive tape between board and enclosure for example.

Hey I Like [This](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vibration-how-do-you-handle-it/31/33) idea!:


I was thinking of using something like this and laying Grip Tape over the top of it so it's a little more discrete. I went into the New Zealand equivalent of Walmart and found these three, a Yoga mat on the left a foam mattress in the middle and a  "comfort mat" on the right (costs 3* as much as the other 2)

left Green mat is 7mm and softest
Middle mattress is slightly thinner and firmer
Right comfort thing is similar thickness and firmest but with a pattern.

Soooo would any of these suit? This is the best I could find out of 2 home depots and this place

@Luke Looks like they will work. If you look back at my previous post (#33, I think), I'm using foam squares that are a little less than 1/2" thick. They Smith out the ride, but don't compromise control in any significant way that I can notice. I'm riding on the bare foam which is actually quite grippy and durable, but the final plan is to put clear grip tape over my inlaid EL wire design in the foam. One thing I haven't figured out yet is the best way to adhere the foam to the board so it follows the concave/contours, without coming loose. I tried double sided carpet tape, but it didn't hold well enough. If you come up with a solution, let me know!

It looks great I've owned a ripple Ridge but not a dinghy. Any thoughts on the cut up foam mattress and griptape combo I am considering? I'll probably need an inch or so of space around the edge of the foot platform for the griptape to stick to the deck.

So i got a foam pad- and tried that idea in my picture in the last post- it felt too unusual on me toes and heels- 
Instead I intend to use liquid nails to stick a foam pad across the entire standing platform

my board has concave that continues right into the micro drop, creating a "cereal bowl" as shown here

my plan is to basically fill in the bowl with foam padding and stick it down with liquid nails. then I want to wrap the entire board in some carbon fibre vinyl (pretty much roll the vinyl around the board) just so that everything is contained well.. finally cover with regular grip tape..is my idea silly?

This was just a quick mock up  to get a feel for it dont worry. it'll look nicer

```
the only problem that I have with foam padding is that you are going to lose response of your board.

I find that in high speed situations where speed wobbles could ensue I make micro adjustments with my ankles... like micro tiny little changes in my stance that maintain my stability.
I fear that adding foam could negate this fine level of control.

I was a little exited to try something new for like.. science and stuff ;)

Sure. I feel that the trucks are not very precise, and the bushings are quite soft and don't give a good return to center (to be fair I wad spoiled on Rojas hybrids) . I'm upgrading the bushings as best I can, but at the moment it feels like most lost stability is coming from those 2 factors with the foam not being so significant (at Low speed at least)

@lowGuido @Luke definitely look into that Landyachtz foam grip tape. I find that its perfect for responsiveness. Every type of foam reacts differently but whatever they use feels like the right combo of material and depth.

Thanks for the link. I've been looking into the self adhering foam for ease of use, but for now, I'm liking my ghetto 1/2" foam flooring. And I'm not sure how thick that self sticking foam is. My guess is that it's pretty thin. 

@lowGuido & @Luke  I haven't had any issues with speed wobbles on my drop deck with the 1/2" foam, and I've had it up to 27+mph/43+kph. I hadn't ridden a drop deck before this, and even with my trucks set pretty tightly, it is still surprisingly maneuverable, but stable as well. I was afraid of the foam being to squishy, but so far, it hasn't affected response enough for me to notice, but it does smooth out the ride noticably. I'm sure a lot has to do with the thickness and density of the foam though.

No, only on top of the deck. I'm pretty sure the foam will compress too much under the trucks due to the small contact area and leverage. I'm just running 1/4" rubber risers between the deck and trucks.

Well, I think it's all a trade off between comfort vs responsiveness. It seems easy enough to try, but I would guess that if you used dense enough foam and/or compressed it so much that it didn't significantly affect performance, it may not be doing much to dampen vibration at that point, but I could be wrong. I might have to try some foam under the trucks for science, just to satisfy my own curiousity.

@Nordle & @flatsp0t  - I loved my e-GBomb.  Not sure if it was the brackets or the 97mm wheels - but that thing rolled NICE (and over anything)!  I typically wear nicer shoes when skateboarding - Nike or similar.

Unfortunately i left the e-GBomb in the car and the window cracked... so someone needed it more than me.  So lame.

Here it is (dual DIYes 5065 200kv's, VESCs, 97 flywheels, tekton ceramics, ADS mounts, Paris 195's w/ 5mm spacers, 8s):

As luck would have it, Subsonic moved from Portland (custom CF subsonic deck on my GBomb) right next to my house (on my way home)...  So i have another custom deck in process and newer GBomb brackets to re-do my e-GBomb (we have the technology... better, stronger, faster!)  OK - maybe not actually faster.  I geared for 25mph and possibly w/ a tailwind hit 30mph.  Stupid fast.  As in i was an idiot to actually go that fast, in my neighborhood, in the dark, at 11:30pm.

I gave it a go:
Functionally, it worked a treat! I dont have batteries or vescs yet.. so I rode on Jacob's hubs and the 90a+ urethane wheels they come with, 180mm trucks, and hard rubber work shoes. I rode 30km/h + on the way to work and it was responsive enough that I felt fully in control the whole time. I rode over potholes, wooden bridges, chip seal road etc and it was all quite comfortable, cant imagine it with good shoes and 75a 90mm wheels haha
aesthetically: I could have done a better job, I blame it on being lazy, impatient and inexperienced

A bit hard to see, but essentially it's a minimalist suspension system - the aluminum plate is cut in such a way that it flexes a bit just behind the front mount bolt line, then the back of the plate rests on 2 strips of rubber back-to-back.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/41a0329fa0dc20ac389159bf51c9c89e740777b1.jpg" width="690" height="388">

The difference in ride is amazing, but there is a slight decrease in crispness on turning.  I think I can compensate by going to slightly softer bushings in the trucks and/or using 1 piece of rubber instead of 2 back to back

The rubber is duro 40A McMaster 1376N18 (Multipurpose Neoprene Rubber Strip, Adhesive-Back, 1" x 36", 3/8" Thick).

The other big advantage to this design is that it reduces rattle of all components on the board - so batteries and electronics, frame and, obviously, me.  The only thing not dampened is the motor.

I did a little research on this and it appears that so long as the deflection isn't more than a few degrees it will go indefinitely or at least a long long time.  I welcome any materials engineers to chime in (this is 6061 I believe).

I considered a more sophisticated system consisting of a pin in the front that would serve as the rotational axis, and that's still not off the table if flex fatigue ever becomes an issue.

Whoa, so happy I'm not the only one who has suffered this!

Came back from a 30min ride in the local park on friday night and my feet and legs hurt like hell.
Bustin EQ deck (9 ply maple), converse all star shoes, riding on tarmac, orange kegels.

my first thought was:
can i ride with non-converse style shoes? what's that gonna do to responsiveness / feel?
would a better shock absorber help (Khiro)?
would bigger wheels help? 90 / 97 / 107mm Abecs?
would a flexier deck help (maybe 8 ply)?
does a lighter setup make that much difference (when i already weigh 110kg)?

end goal - i want to feel like i'm on a snowboard, so anything that will help do that is awesome.

am sure most of these already covered above, but in next build am going to focus on this as think the comfort of the ride is most important for cruising and enjoying it.

any other ideas?

The only issue I'm having is that I have to extend the griptape over the edge of the board, as it would look bad if the griptape ended at the edge, with a layer of foam padding exposed.

I think the type of sneakers makes a difference. I tried on few diff pairs of sneakers and the ones with thicker soles actually help decrease vibration to the point of no fatigue or numbness at the end of the ride. But then again, i have the 97mm Flywheels so that perobably helsp too.

I'm gonna try these foam risers I made this weekend. It's made from those 1/2" foam floor mats. I've compressed them a bit with the truck bolts, but as you can see from the second pic, when the truck is turned, the foam compresses a bit more, and almost acts like a foam shock absorber with the truck baseplate moving up and down slightly on the bolts. Don't how how this will handle, but it should dampen some vibration. We will see....

@miquelcamps The foam risers did seem to smooth out the ride, and reduce vibrations. But since the foam can compress, and the truck mounting bolts aren't cranked all the way down, the truck kind of shifts and wanders when you turn. It's still rideable, but less precise when turning, and probably only good for low/mid speed cruising. 

So, I thought I'd try this experiment instead and see how it rides. Once the rain stops though.... I'm hoping it will retain the vibration damping aspects, but reduce the excess truck movement front to back and side to side.

Also thinking about using this foam to make shoe inserts/footbeds.

I used some rubber stand offs I had from a tv mount in between the truck base plate and the deck, through the risers.  I cut the stand offs 1/8 longer than the risers and ran the mounting hardware through them.  I was amazed at how much my ride smoothed out on rough concrete.  Its a cheap fix, worked pretty well.

I may be extrapolating way out of the universe here, but with Jeeps coil springs offer much better handling and are way more comfortable than leaf springs.  That being said, because of the nature of the design, leaf springs are much more resilient than coil springs.  

As far as spring'd trucks, that grounds been covered pretty well with Seismic G5's and MBS mountain board trucks, but the leaf spring idea seems to gaining traction.  I'm interested anyways.

They're cool, but I have concerns about the level of support that the bottom bushing has as well as the potential for too much truck flex. The bottom bushing looks like it's just floating there. An amish cup washer might fix that issue though. 
I know these are designed primarily for park skating, but how stable are they at higher speeds? It just looks a little bit unstable to me, but I haven't actually tried it, so I could be way off. IMO
They look a bit similar to this old design from the 70s. Except this is more of a torsion beam design.

Whipped up some DIY rubber risers. This material is cut from a big 4x6 ft rubber mat that Tractor Supply sells for $25. Cut to size with a hacksaw and drilled 4 holes. The mats are 1/2" thick, but I guess you could rip in half it that's too thick. I went from 83mm to 97mm wheels and needed some clearance, the ride is definitely much nicer with bigger wheels and risers. Handling seems unaffected at 35mph.

rubber risers, foam seals on the enclosure, neoprene padding on the internals.  its foolproof, cheap and works well.

Any recommendations to the best rubber risers or would any work? might get some Gold ones if there are any for the Anubis. BTW do you know good examples of builds tat follow "foam seals on the enclosure, neoprene padding on the internals". Looking to see what nice, clean examples i can follow and make sure I'm thinking what you're saying

I second this knowledge bomb. I skated in foam bottomed running/tennis shoes for my first 6 months, and it is super comfy... Until you're going 37 mph down a jointed concrete concourse. Flat, hard bottomed skate shoes are a whole new level of control and confidence, and I've found that wearing skate shoes allows me to shift my feet much easier. But the foam padding sounds super comfortable and is veryyyyy tempting.

It's hard to teach proper American English amidst gunfire and social media using an antiquated system designed to manufacture slaves for factories that are now rusting away in wholesome middle America. 

Also, the language we use on this continent is living and breathing, derived from a number of colorful cultures,  and doesn't require anyone's notes to exist within its own self-evident beauty. Every breath is prose. 

damn people be trippin hard an shit up in here talking bout proper english an shit fuck this aint school damn

LHB do you see any _irony_ in that the litigation capital of the world has taken the language of another country (one that belongs to another), marginally changed (bastardized) it and now claims it as their own? :thinking: 

* a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often wryly amusing as a result.

If we also introduce Cricket & Rugby (both soiled to create baseball & your version of football) the plot thickens or a pattern emerges... i'll also just point out your requirement for shoulder pads to tackle some one and a glove to catch a ball :thinking: 

"Vibration" to follow :"how do you handle it?" :joy:

Going off pictures I have...

I foam the enclosure:

![received_10159997012230521|299x500](upload://vkMrqDOMuBX9PFows0AXXROP8z2.jpeg)

I silicone my pack to the foam that is adhered to the enclosure. Then place another piece of foam between the components and deck

![received_10160014875045521|299x500](upload://e9DzvQ3pncyJ0HWrtfG1DYobBZ0.jpeg)

I also like the enclosure with door trim 
![9ab4051e05a6883fb5a7a43baa3ce117bbfadd0b_1_375x500|375x500](upload://mWu4yaWuLlvvE1X7XmCcH2ipERF.jpg)

And use rubber o-rings on my bolts(with loctite) the o-rings help reduce the bolts want to back out and break the loctite bond

Glue the phase wires in, or use grommets
![280525b076f41648d73fb50d61783b8ca0733c11_1_666x500|666x500](upload://y694IUC4VJJf2mzLqawkjvx9W0H.jpg)

Keep phase wires short so they cannot bounce/smack the deck
![received_10160039199930521|299x500](upload://xVx1K2shUSg1U0UHIQWJrCFyCq5.jpeg)

Use urethane shockpads 
![received_10160085291640521|299x500](upload://hPa5ECKLUIbg462O379apAGnbqI.jpeg)

Actually, the invasion was multicultural and riddled with racism and conflict. Mostly among the invaders themselves. 

American football is a farce. Any game play organization who can take four 15 minute quarters and stretch it out to 3 hours while simultaneously reducing game play footage in order to leverage pressure from friends and family to exploit social weaknesses to gain viewership then exploit that viewership of idiots damaging their brains for millions of dollars in order to gain ad revenue is a narcissistic, egomaniacal psychopath. If corporations are people, the NFL needs to be locked up in a treatment facility. We may as well be in Rome watching lions eat some slave warrior. 

Baseball is boring, but at least it still has some semblence of sport to it. ITs not just a direct witdrawal of cash from a meat grinder. 

I hate sports. I've hated sports since i played soccer as a 9 year old and realized that the adults weren't having any fun, and that this was an agenda, not a means of getting kids to work together as a team and have fun and learn something. I played soccer from age 5 to age 9, and when the coach came out and started swearing at the kids about performance, i walked and called my mom. I checked in later at the various school sports and YMCA stuff and joined a few soccer teams later only to find the same stupid shit. I was on swim team until age 8 also. Same story. Americans in general as a whole, not referring to the individual,  are fucking fat, blood thirsty animals. 

Back on topic: These damned Boa Constrictors give zero fucks about vibration. I rode 12 miles to work this morning over cobblestones and train tracks and shitty sidewalks and shitty bike paths littered with glass and gravel and parts from car wrecks. Golden.  Felt hardly any of it, and never lost responsiveness. 

I really like these wheels.

Hi
      I've actually done this myself --i.e. -- cutting foam from an old flip flop and using it as a riser for my skateboard. I've recently cut an approximately one inch thick rubber mat I found at a playground and used it as a riser.
