Unfortunately the lovely trampa HS11 is discontinuing in production. 
And unfortunatelly the Holy Pro comes only with holes in the deck, which isnâ€™t that great if you want to mount your batteries under the deck.
Today I had 5min to design an easy cover for the holes. They 3D printed in 10min and can be glued easily inside of the holes.

If somebody interested PM me your e-mail and I will sent you over the stl file.

Why don't you put the files on thingiverse as well? Would save you some hassle from sending the files to all the people

no, petg. itÂ´s also just 8mm so you can seal it from the down with some silicone.
