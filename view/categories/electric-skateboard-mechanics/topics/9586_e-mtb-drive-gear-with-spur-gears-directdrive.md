Talked about a customer a while ago and have now the stuff here to do a prototyp.

I¬¥m interrested what you guys think about.

Wheelspur is 60T Modul 2 out of black POM
Motorspur is 10/12T milled out of Steel

These are somer serios gears i think, have an look:

compared to HTD5 and ISO-05:

Customized my Mounts with shorter Axle Distance, will mill them later:

Looks interesting. We are testing this since three months now, maybe your customer found it on our page (esk8.de) or our facebook profile. And yes, it works very well. :slight_smile:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/4/547fbcf5390ec71ad3a8f7597eda00094a868a2d.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Hey. 
Nice that you work on something like this.
Its not possible to see much of any Spurgears on this pictures but who knows...
He dont told me about where he got this idea from.
Keep on your good work.

I would buy this in a heart beat, someone do a group buy or put them up for sale. Make sure the gear teeth are strong and have a lot of contact. They will have to absorb the full force of acceleration unlike belt gears where the belt can stretch for sudden impacts, so they can strip over time if they are weak. I would say you need metal gears for sure.

This is a great idea but just something to keep in mind when comparing spur gear direct drive systems vs belt systems.

In a belt driven system, you have multiple teeth, usually a minimum of 6 meshing with the belton the pinion gear and about half the pulley on the wheel engaged as well.  This will distribute the forces across more teeth which in turn means less wear per tooth. 

The belt and the gear both move in the same direction and there is no slippage(unless you're over torquing and the belt skips). This also means less wear and tear. 

Should you fuck up royally, you strip the belt. A $5-$10piece.

With direct drive gears you're engaging 1 tooth at a time.  You will only ever have 1 tooth pushing against 1 tooth. Best case scenario,  you got the spacing perfect and you have 2 teeth during the transition between teeth but that's going to be a lot more strain on the teeth which will cause more wear. Although the tooth profiles are larger so that should mitigate any real issues there but you may require regular greasing and cleaning.

The teeth are supposed to roll over one another though you're broadly going to have some fictional losses there from that not being the case. Are these losses more significant than those on a belt system? Probably not, it might actually be a little better. But it will more likely be significantly louder, which may not be an issue on a all terrain board you want to use out in the woods but rolling down a suburban area or a peaceful park may annoy some pedestrians.

My last concern though is a more practical one which is if for whatever reason you brake really hard or you somehow managed to lock up your wheel at speed then the gears have nowhere to go. All the stresses get transfered to your mount which may warp or break it depending on how sudden it happens.  Don't know if that would be an actual issue to be concerned about since I think you'd have to lock up the motors for something like that to happen which probably wouldn't happen. 

Those are just some thoughts though, I like it. I think you'll get some serious power transfer out of it üòç

Yes Black or white thats the question (-:
I¬¥m quite happy with the Beltdrive, but always interested in testing new stuff and parts.
After Chain and Belt its maybe the last wich is workable, or maybe not (-:

I have used the combination of POM and Metal  drivegears long time in highpower brushless RC models. It was the better combination as steel on steel.

It's actually much less noisy, but it needs to be greased (not very often though). Cleaning might be necessary if you're driving at the beaches, but as long as the enclosure is sealed well this might even not be necessary. It's more or less like car gearboxes, depending on terrain it needs different maintenance to enhance sustainability.

[/quote]

Car gearboxes use helix gears which reduce noise, larger contact area. Spur to spur can be be quite noisy. I noticed now the larger gear looks like its a large nylon print/injection molded piece so this may not end up being an issue here.  And yeah I meant cleaning out fine particulate like sands every now and again.

I don't want to hijack this thread, so I have put a sample of the noise into the video thread. 

The microphone was placed very close to the gearbox, but what you hear are mainly the motors. POM also helps to reduce the noise. It's not a sample of the final iteration though, the video was taken some weeks ago.

Making some prototypes to get some general real world informations about it.
Actually i dont think that it will "beat" a nice Beltdrive but i think its interresting enough to give it a try.
Waiting actually for the 12S Maytech Sensor System wich should arrives this week, maybe will test the Spur Gears with it.... 
Will fit it first to a Trampa Channeltruck, but also Flame Dirtpipe V2 is easy to fit.
Its to early to think about selling this, maybe contact @elkick it sounds like they will release soon !

These look great!! In the past we had the best luck with a metal pinion used with a plastic or nylon spur for high power rc trucks. To give is a weak point and help save expensive electronics I'm guessing. I'm curious to see how these wear. Do you have any concern about stripping them under high power or when braking? Have you considered a slipper clutch if this wears too quickly. Thanks

Excellent job as always!!

Thanks mate, yes i think enclosing the drivetrain will be good.
But also its not an easy job to seal it for 100%, and if you got a change to get debris in, which cant came out anymore it will be worse then without...
Thinking about sealing the motorspur in a way that no stones can came between the both spurs, so without enclosing the hole wheelsprocket.
Greasing will only make sense in 100% closed box, otherwise you will get an nice adhesive for debris...
But from my experience with RC stuff with this kind of spur combination grease is not really needet...

Thanks Kevin. Yes we have had good luck too with this combination. I think that maybe a "true" Nylon Spur will be nicer then the actually POM spur. All the good RC spurs are nylon¬¥s as i remember so far.
Not thinking about a slipper at the moment, it will complicate thinks alot i guess. Thanks again Bro!

Hey :slight_smile: Thanks Bara
Yeah its scary ... sticking the fingers from underside in the pinion will made nice meat for Burgers..

So done the first real life tests today. Completely unsealed in IMO bad conditions... lots of gravel and split shit.... many burnouts and drifts ..... about 2.5 hours runtime on the spurs 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/9/a9ca1b6ceb67511c8d5046059c5193acd866a4e9.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Its a nice and really direct drivetrain, sounds a little rough/loud compared to belt...but power transfer is nice

Check video footage from today, tried to kill the unsealed gears but i dont win this two hour Battle  :smiling_imp:

Hey.
I dont forget about this project :wink:
It get stucked caused due the problems with the Maytech Sensor System:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/maytech-mtes-120a-12s-sensor-system-with-6374-170kv-motors/9973

Working on new parts actually...

Made some new Wheelgears out of reinforced Nylon stuff :

Machined some new "spacers" to be able to mount the wheelgear without the Wheel itself, its nescessary because you have to place the cover/housing between.

So the wheelgear stays in place, makes changing tires more easy...

Can you explain how the wheel gear is screwed on the wheel? From the pictures it seems that you have longer hub screws, which just extend into the gear and somehow are tight enough to hold the hubs together... A detailed picture or some explanation would be great! 

Otherwise - congrats on the nice progress you have made.. I see that you''ve made some covers for the belt and gears.. do you plan to make some motor covers, too some day? Or good air circulation is a must for your motors?

Im asking this, since I've started thinking about safety since it seems it is a no brainer for someone with a brains to unscrew the motor from the plate and just leave the place.. if you ever left board in such a place where something like this can happen.. Been living in sort of 3rd level country, so you got to keep an eye on your stuff if u leave it in the public ;)

Hey.

Will post some updates soon, maybe you can see better the attachment. 
Not really thinking about sealing the motors, they need some Airflow for sure.
Maybe some "Outerwear" Filters or something like this...
But nothing what will protect the Motors for robbery (-:

## \#29 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2016-10-27T21:44:33.471Z Reads: 480

```
yeah, exactly, I was thinking of ''robbery'' scenario..

So a case / enclosure with some vents for airflow would be great to avoid motor dismounting by someone not yourself ;)

Otherwise, the screws really need to be untraditional type..Torx ones would probably work a lot better than the regular X screws which does not require any special screwdriver heads.

Though, really depends on where you leave your board or do you leave it at all :slight_smile:

---
Second idea, there could be some sort of plate / case / enclosure for the motor screws.. This way it would not require to seal / enclose the motor's body, just the place where it is screwed to the plate.

Easy way is using some special profiled screws.
I think its more an uncommon problem, i personally would never leave my board anywhere alone in public.

The piece you asked for is just an adapter which allows to mount the wheel seperate, after mounting the Gearbox housing.

 This actual batch of 4 Drivetrains are Protoypes for my personal testing, as i mentioned earlier the parts gets to big in diameter. That means that there is too less groundless.

Its one of many points i will change in next batch, also this wheeladapter part will be different.
I will reduce the reduction a bit to get size down, dont wanna downgrade to smaller sized spur moduls.

ANYWAY :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

The actual Protos will work for me to get some more experience with this Spurgear stuff.

Also what kind of batteries are you running on that thing? 12s 20ah?

4WD, interesting, would it be possible to make front motor mounts so that the motors are not facing forward? Perhaps just like the rear but pointed up higher? Would this make enough clearance to make it possible? How can anyone resist a 4WD Trampa build (it will weigh a ton but it would be the ultimate offroading eboard)

Interested to see how the spur cut gears hold up after long term abuse. I guess for now, I'll stick to the e-toxx belt drive. 

Also, say the spur gears wear out faster than desired, perhaps a helical gear (as mentioned in previous posts) would last longer?

Last thing, if helical hears causes too much side thrust, perhaps a herringbone gear set up?

Generally i think 2WD is enough, dont make things heavier then needet.
But in this case just wanna have the brutalst setup ever :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Winter is coming, lots of mud in the woods... i¬¥m hoping for lots of traction and torque.
Looking for some outerwear stuff to protect ESC and Motors.

Would be possible to increase the angle a bit yes, but not that much. 
Will always be interference contur.
But next Protos will be alot more compact.

Yeah i liked your idea of helical gears and checked this last time you mentioned it, but i dont find any of these helical ones out of POM on NYLON. Only Steel, and i dont wanna go with a full steal spur gear drive... imo that would be really overkill, perhaps noisy and for sure heavy

You are right:
- Board feels more stable at higher speeds
- higher curve speed (feeled not meassured)
- harder to control drift ... by pulling the trigger in corner the rear dont break out so easy but board gets faster... so it feels like "under control"

will get some more runs tomorrow on gravel also, i love this drifting stuff and hoping for nice new experience with quaddrive.

Braking with this 4WD is like throwing an anchor :sunglasses: have to say that you cant adjust the brake strength with the Roxxy, otherwise i would reduce the amount for the front motors. If you dont be carefully you do stoppies on demand !

Have had a nice 15km tour through the woods this morning, awesome sunny autum weather.

Put a big 10S4P batterie on the board and take it out.

This are about 800 Wh, heavy stuff but for touring no big issue.

So if you say average consum of each pack was 3300mAh in total its 13200mAh on 10S.
This are 488 Wh for a 15km offroad ride with a average speed of 17,7kmh.
So 32 Wh per km for this 4WD Board on 10S for touring.

I'm glad you mentioned your WH consumtion! 

Actually, compared to you my single drive 192kv 6s 4.33 gear ratio 9inch wheel machine ''eats

 quite a lot, so yours is not bad at all in terms of WH consumed (considering the ''godly'' 4wd drive. :D )

Mine eats about 19-20wh per km. I assume the big wheels and the big surface area gives a bit of friction to overcome.. 

though, second option is that the tires at not inflated fully, I ride them at about 2 atm, which is 2/3 from the maximum (3 atm max)

--

Im not sure how much battery is taken into consideration and is it possible to consume more Wh because of battery. Im running at about 10-20 Amps on average, so that is far from my maximum of about 80A (with 40 Amp theoretical buffer).

Anyways, I think you should be building proffesional high end e-skateboards (including trampas, of course)..

Are you also riding a mountainboard? Yeah with ''fenders''  I meant mud / splash guard.. did not know the correct word for it!

As of right now.. I imagine something you can attach to the axles.. then it has to turn out something similar like these race cars have:

Agree. The ''motor wheel/s'' would be the most difficult to make the mud/splash guard for! Though, I think it is doable, you just need some sort of attachment for the motor plate.. it would require a different mounting perhaps, compared to the ''non-motorized'' wheels.

I'm riding a street board, want to build a mountain board eventually but that is a pretty expensive project.  I just saw the motors exposed.at the front, if it were mine, I would be worried about limbs and twigs hitting the motor as well as mud and debris getting in the motor.

Some of the older Jeep CJ's had a bug screen that covered the front grill, to keep stiff iut if the radiator.  You might frame up an aluminum grid with rails on the outsid and attach it so that it covered the front electronics.

That way you could block most of the large debris and sticks and twigs and such.

This is probably a no brainer for you, but I was thinking about this last night.

You could use 5/8 or 3/4 [aluminum conduit](http://www.graybar.com/store/en/gb/rigid-aluminum-conduit-88272926?cm_mmc=pla:google-_-googleshopping-_-gb5027-_-88272926&utm_source=google&utm_term=&utm_campaign=Graybar%3EPLA%3ECategory&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=SlJOGjbu|pcrid|49843352090|pkw||pmt|&gclid=CjwKEAjw-uDABRDPz4-0tp6T6lMSJADNoyPbisN954JcVkHrNnONwiaaDW4ctya-L3rt2xLn3_ZAPxoCS0Tw_wcB), maybe 2 pieces to create a flat front that with a slight curve to the inside on each end.  behind that you could brad or pop rivet a [perforated aluminum sheet](http://www.onlinemetals.com/merchant.cfm?pid=13498&step=4&id=1003&gclid=CjwKEAjw-uDABRDPz4-0tp6T6lMSJADNoyPbibKyEmeANsNMN20stnw7nIqyy8Ilz1ZLzDSBvTQ8JhoCetrw_wcB).

Hey.

Yes i thought about.
Maybe something like Scramboards or Trampaboards uses to mount their Parts on Trucks.

Actually it would complicate things a bit with the bearing inside of the Spur, so actually i will use it with the machined Trucks.

Thinking of just selling it with a machined Truck includet, Vertigo Truck without Baseplate is about 50‚Ç¨.

Playing around with different angles of the mount to the ground.

On the right its the angle of the Tip about 30degrees, on the left its raised above 15degrees more.

I like the lifted one more because the motors move away from ground and are better protected behind the axle. Will have to remove one of the Motorprotection braces to get enough clearence to the Truck when it tilts. But this one is not needet IMO.

Its amazing how compact this drivetrain is :

Done some testruns yesterday, will try to upload some video footage later.
12S on 200KV motors geared 5:1 will give you a Vmax of 65kmh.

man, thats really super compact :open_mouth: would be awewsome to have it so far in that you cannot even hit the mount or motors when you run the board straight into a wall! maybe with a smaller drive gear? could use a lot lower KV motors or adjust battery voltage instead to get the desired top speed / torque!

if you like it and it holds up, I might build up another trampa in spring - this capsuled spur gear stuff just looks perfect for the dirt cause! and generally tbh!

do you think the cage is actually doing something to protect the motors? it looks fragile somehow - if one of the pipes gets hit, i Imagine it just bends and the carbon breaks. think I would like the mount system more without the cage, cause it would be even more compacts. or did you plan to connect the 2 truck mounts in the final version at these points?

It would be possible to go with a smaller drivegear, they is some place left between the Truck and the Motor :wink:
The market for low KV Motors isnt that big, only APS have some with 130KV from what i know, lower i never seen pls correct me if i wrong.
Now with 1:5 you can easy use 168KV or 149KV Turnigy stuff even on 12S... depending on desired Vmax.

This Motor protection parts are optional.
Its actually an first idea to give some little protection.
Yeah i think if instead of this thin CF Part there is something more massive it maybe takes a hit.
The connection points in the Motormount will not make it so much bigger but you have an option to mount something. Maybe a shield to hold debris away or something like the Tubes, btw massive 7075 10mm round material.

Its not easy for me to give up the Braces as i normaly uses them on my other builds!
But if i machine the trucks to get the needet alignment for the Spurs and will try to connect both sides it will fails in most cases. The reason is that both sides of the Trampa Truck will not perfectly align to each other.

Its to early to say if this will be the ultimate transmission. 
I need some more kilometers on it. 
Maybe also some interested people who will test it too :wink:

As i mentioned above  its not possible IMO to get the best alignment of each truck side and connecting them with horizontal braces :confused:

This is the prefered mounting position, motors move away from the ground and also gets more behind the trucks.

Changed Motors for next tests to the SK3-6374-149KV , still good for over 50kmH Vmax, but not that aggressive as the 200kv dymonds.

Thanks Lox,

peel of what comes of then use "BrakeCleaner" and a towel. 
The trick is not to use to long the same place on the towel, change it often and aply breakcleaner.
One Motor one Minute this way :wink:

@whitepony
I thought alot about your last comments.
I still think that a further reducing of the reduction is maybe problematic with the available Motors.
Dont forget that on 12S even the 149kv Turnigys will give you over 50kmh Vmax.

BUT:
Actually it would be even with the 1:5 Gearing possible to be inside of the wheels.
The axledistance is 60mm and Motor radius is about 32, so by 200mm Wheels you are INSIDE.
I really thought about if the small round braces could be as good as the known horizontal braces. And in fact they cant be, if we maybe completely go without them the mount will get more compact. There would be no need anymore to be bigger then the motors. As you said (-;

Maybe another way for additional motorprotection could be to adapt something from the underside of Truck where the Springplate is attached ... something like a brushguard as mentioned by @mmaner 

I would like to ask @trampa : 
Is it possible that the trucks are not machined out of one zero point? 
So if you wanna have the best alignment to the Steelaxle you have to seperate both sides?!
Thanks for your help Frank.

Hi Jens, the hangers are forged and polished, then heat treated, then painted, then CNCed. Problem: How on earth do you clamp that raw hanger in a super precise way, when it is still raw, without any holes etc. Its not that easy. I think you should accept the fact that 100% precision is hard to guarantee on a forged, heat treated and polished hanger. We will try to get a better alignment in future, maybe designing a new Hanger. BTW.: If you interconnect your rods, use six of them, as seen on our drives, its a very sturdy casing you get

Motor KV: We have the 118 and 136KV motors. We measured@1Nm so the values are a bit more realistic for board speed and efficiency assumptions.
No load KV is roughly 125 and 145KV. 
These would be perfect for your drive.
40km/h is in my eyes fast enough. Torque is what you want, going off road.

You should really test your drive, set up as a single drive. Singles are under more strain!
Hope the gears last... What about noise?

Cheers, Frank

Thanks for fast reply.
Yeah i will accept (-; 
just want to be sure about before i break my neck by trying to align both sides together.

Your Hexa Design of Motorcase is nice, but i got not enough space between truck and motor for it.

I thought about your Motors, anyday i have to test them for sure.
Actually for the Spur setup the motorshaft is to long, its about 38mm i cant get it in the housing.
And to cut it would be very nasty, always wishes the last years for longer Motorshaft (-; but in this case not needet.

Never thought about a Single Drive Test with the Spurs... yes you are right stress will be bigger for sure.
Time will tell how good they last... noise is not that bad, belt is nicer for sure. But also the drag is higher by the Belt, the Spur is really good by free coasting.

Thanks again.

Hi Jenso,

its easy to make a replacement shaft. We use double keyway (Pulley and Motor Can).
I would not cut our hardened shaft, agreed... 
Usually the Belt is 98% efficient and schould not create drag if the belt tension is adjusted adequately.
Using Spurs, I can see the advantage in having smaller Drive Train and improoved gearing.
No system is without advantages and disadvantages. You gain this, you loose that.
In the end its a matter of durability and personal prference.
Very good skills BTW, keep up the hard work! If you like, feel free to ring my Mobile.

## \#91 Posted by: Nowind Posted at: 2016-11-30T21:12:26.354Z Reads: 361

Hey.

Chain ISO-05 (similar/stronger then #25)
+ light and cheap, easy to change gearing, resitant against any kind of dirt
- not strong enough for high powersetups IMO, if it breaks it blocks the wheel... could be dangerous

Belt HTD5-25mm wide, Roller/Support Bearing
+ smooth and silent, extrem strong
- higher drag then chain/spur IMO , if not sealed you get problems with mud/grass

Direct Drive MOD2
+ super direct feeling, free coasting, ultra compact
- need machining on axle, you get some noise by rough terain and if wheels slip
  (IMO its the backlash of the spurs what will create some knocking sound)
 No longtime expierence of how long the spur will last !

Both would be possible!
If its only supposed to hold dirt away it could be a thin shield or printed cover.
If it should be also a protective part for the drivetrain it has to be more massive, for that a reduced gear ratio is needet otherwise the inteference contur gets to big.

In general its running really good, free coasting is very good.
On nice roads its not loud but as i mentioned above on rough terrain you got some knocking of the gears.
Its hear and noticable, this is the backlash of the spurs i guess.

Worked on the next mounts : 
Removed all connection points of the last version for the round braces, also reduced unneedet material around the motors, you are now completely INSIDE of the tires !

Not sure if this will really needet, but it cant be a disadvantage :wink:

But i have to say its of course more work, the both Parts need to machined together, and they are fixed also with two "matching pins" know what i mean ? Its pinned :confused: not sure if its the right term ...
But this way the both parts are not able to move anymore in no way (-;

The white grease was something i just have in stock but i regocnice that caused due the high RPM not much grease stucks to the gears. Now got some stuff which is supposed to this use case.

this is really the most interesting product on these forums in a long time for me. that ultra compact setup will make motors pretty much invisible when looked at by, coughcough, lets say a police car from the road. it appears to have very little to no wear, basically no maintenance in comparison to belt & chain and it isnt such a mess like a chain. could only ride in superold pants cause the chain kept throwing grease & stuff at me. ;p

really love it jens, so much that i really consider building up a trampa for next season again. :relaxed:

will spend the winter thinking a little about better (stealthier) solutions for battery & esc.


been skating the last few days with my vanguard - at this time of the year i really wish i had pneumatics. :p  doh, leaves! doh, gravel, ah a wet leaf patch, oh the sun hasnt been here yet -> frozen patch, then 20m perfect tar aaand it all starts again. :sweat_smile:

Set up a Truck with the new Mounts, the wider clamping area let me have a very good feeling even without any topmount braces. Now they are 18mm wide, lot more resitance against any forces from sideways i think

I will test a little different setup, going with the "new" APS Hev Motors 6374-240kv, never used that high KV motors in my builds but i need some RPM because i will go with the MAX6 and 8S.

Always top notch work Jenns, how can anyone not love this stuff.  Alien has some pretty monster size outrunners, I find myself dreaming that somehow these motors will fit.

6390 170kv 10mm shaft

8085 250kv 12mm shaft

Where is the LOVE button at?  I only see a like button.  For this particular set up, the absence of cross braces makes it look sleeker and more compact.  Looking forward to seeing how the gears hold up after months and months of use.  Based off of all the fine work and attention to details, I'm guessing it will hold up really well.  If so, I might just have to get my hands on one of these kits in the future.

Some RC guys do so with big scale aplications. But normally they are 4WD and they place two motors on the center diff. In this case to drive one wheel with two motors i would prefer 4 Motors for 4 Wheels :wink:

The Trampa Truck is machined on two sides in a squareangle, the removed material is not much.
Only 0.5mm from the 22mm per side, imo better then turning down to a round shape(here you will loose alot of material). 
The mount itself got a 18mm wide area where it is in contact with the truck on 2 sides. 
Two M8 ball pressure screws sit on the opposite side of the milled area and presses the mount on the squareangle. 
It looks very solid and holds up fine so far, this kind of clamping is proved on many many chain/beltdrive kits(without machined truck) in 10mm wide. 
Its needet to tighten the Screws again after the first rides because the metal head will move in a bit, but ones it set its hell of stable imo.
Hope this answer your question, if not please feel free to ask anytime.

I never was dissapointed by the SK3 Motors, really like them.
Main reason to choose the Aliens was the fact of high KV.
Also the more closed design suits good to the full sealed direct drive.
10mm Motorshaft and Silicon wires was another point.
Generall design in black with silver Alien Logo looking badass.

To compare the riding expierence is not easy caused to alot higher RPM, 
what i regocnize again on this Alien motors is that they are louder as the SK3.
On 8S its not that loud as by another Setup i tried in the beginning of this year on 12S.

Alien APS got many nice ones.

Going with SLS Lipos 4x4S 5000mAh 40C as an 8S2P pack

Tracked and filmed one ride...
Distance 10km
Average Speed 27kmh
Topspeed 51kmh
consumed energy 8000mAh, what is 240Wh, so we go with 24Wh / km
Batteries and ESC stays cool, Motors are warm but far away from hot.

```
POM is a durable plastik. I think is similar to teflon, but not sure. (no lubrication needed with metal gears)
Polyoxymethylene (POM), also known as acetal,[1] polyacetal and polyformaldehyde, is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability. As with many other synthetic polymers, it is produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold variously by such names as Delrin, Celcon, Ramtal, Duracon, Kepital and Hostaform.

POM is characterized by its high strength, hardness and rigidity to ‚àí40 ¬∞C. POM is intrinsically opaque white, due to its high crystalline composition, but it is available in all colors. POM has a density of 1.410‚Äì1.420 g/cm3.[2]

Typical applications for injection-molded POM include high-performance engineering components such as small gear wheels, eyeglass frames, ball bearings, ski bindings, fasteners, guns, knife handles, and lock systems. The material is widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industry.

We've tested POM for our gearing system, but the forces being applied means they're not up to the task in the long run.

Hey.
After the struggle with my wifes health the last 4 weeks i dont ride or work on my Boards.
But the last week i had of and was out to ride and test everyday....

This Direct Drive Stuff is amazing, i¬¥m totally impressed more and more. 
So compact, very low drag, strong as hell, no problems with dirt, easy to change tires if you have a flat etc...

This is the 8S Setup with the latest Version of the Directdrive :

Its an nice medium strong Setup, love to ride in the skatepark with it. 
Maybe better to use only 200kv instead of 240kv for more torque.

This is my favorite Setup which is scary powerfull, 200KV on 12S, 1:5geared with modded Roxxy ESC¬¥s
Mounted is one of the prototypes of the Directdrive :

Thats the strongest setup i have ever ridden, its a waaay to fast but brings tons of fun.
Once you ride you never go back :sunglasses:

I think this full cnc machined parts are maybe to expensive for most people, thinking about a Economic version with some laser cutted sheet metal too.

Yes i will give it a try for sure. It will bring the costs down for some parts. 
Other Parts will stay the same which are not cheap itself... like the Gears.

Dual Chaindrive (missing some screws and motorsprocket) around 1100Gramms RTR

To be honest i barely see no sign of wear :+1:
Using some "High Power Grease" its spray and gets into nice wax and sticks like hell.

As i mentioned i have worked on bringing costs down to bring this amazing Drivetrain to more People !

No compromises inside : 
Same POM and Steel Gears, same POM Gearbox.
Instead of 10mm 7075 Aluminium now 3mm Stainless Steel
Instead of 3mm CF now 1mm Stainless Steel
10mm wide clamping Area out of 7075
Reduced amount of Treads, using more nuts... save money too !

Have a look :

Hi Jens! Very nice as usual!

So this is the economic version? What is the cons compared to the premium version. The economic version is heavier maybe?

The price is totally fair IMO. I just wondered, why is it a little more expensive for non EU than EU? Because of VAT maybe?

Thanks David.

So yeah its the Economic (-; But there will only be this version from now on ! 
Why? Because they are no really downsides!
No need to spend more time on the CNC .. no need to spend more money for this time on CNC.

Know what i mean? 
Why make parts more expensive then nessassary?
Its no compromise in function! 
Only in design IMO for fans of milled Aluminium maybe a downside (-; 
These guys can get the Aluminium Version of course on request.

Its also possible to use CF on request, but best bang for the buck will this stainless parts...
also the non thermal feature of CF is a downside for Motormounts IMO.

Yes the reason is VAT. Thats why its more expensive for EU customers.

Its slightly heavier, but only about 90gramms...

I totally agree with you. I think my next mountainboard will use these and VESC6 (maybe).

I think you're right to use the VERTIGO hanger and not the ULTIMATE hanger for this. The 9.525 mm bearings don't fit perfectly the 9.525 mm axles of the ULTIMATE. There's some kind of little gap, that doesn't exist with 12 mm bearings/axles. Weird‚Ä¶

Thank you Gernot.

I dont think that it is strong enough to go with 3mm 7075... 
Dont forget that you will have sometimes ground contacts and that inside gears are working which needs proper mesh... imo 3mm Aluminium is to flexy.

Also tested Overdrive on the backtruck with 20% more RPM... but dont get much better.... i think you just need alot more speed for 4WD drifting, because higher grip at all !?!

The upgrade in power to 6S is huge but for hard testing this small gearbox i need more :smiling_imp:

So installed my Roxxys and go with 10S and 12S 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/8/b8c400d8a01c04529037fa747860174609e5a06a.JPG" width="666" height="500">
The Roxxys with capbank and UK Box is 200gramms more then MAX6, is ok because power increase massive... to be honest i think 10S on the 149kv SK3 with the 1:4 reduction is really enough.
Its no Truck for 50mph speedfreaks, its an freestyle truck imo with great turning and low wheight.

This is the amount of recharged lipos from only Saturday :

Check the last line in display : 95Ah on 25V... this are 2375Wh i pumped into this Mini Direct Drive yesterday with 10 and 12S lipo packs :sunglasses:

This way my tires look after this nice day (i swear they where nearly new in the morning) and i swaped them by half day from rear to front :

They die like a boss, with a slightly "bang" ... NICE

BTW
Two big SK3 are a super tight fit, have to shorten the shafts and do a little grinding on the truck :

Better to go with normal sized 6374, like alien, dymond,enertion... the sk3 are more 85mm :wink:

On this picture you also see the adjuster screws which sits from below... good for adjusting with mounted ESC¬¥s

In generell this is really a nice ultra agil Setup:
Light, fast and tons of stearing... have some video footage ready soon i hope

Hey David.
The regular sized Direct Drive from mine have a reduction from 1:5 and sits on a machined Trampa Vertigo Hanger and uses a support bearing inside the Spurgear. This one is well tested and works like a champ.
It is best choice for riders who want to have a pure MTB. Selling this here : 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motormounts-for-trampa-mtb-e-toxx-dual-direct-drive/18992

The Mini Direct Drive i designed after a talk with @whitepony about the possibility to use it on the Mini Vertigo Trampa Truck which is used in the Street and Urban Carver. 
It has a reduction of 1:4, NO support bearing inside the spur, lighter/thinner POM case ... it sits on a machined Mini Vertigo Truck, also can mounted on a machined regular Vertigo Truck.
Its small enough that you can use it with the upcoming 125mm Urethan Wheels on Superstarhubs from Trampa, or with 7Inch Pneumatics and of course 8inch Pneumatics.

So i would say this is the right drivetrain for people who want a convertible Mount for Street and MTB use.
Maybe also for switching between Urban and MTB.
Got this MiniDrive also in a Quaddriveboard actually.
More ground clearence, less wheight.

Made a Beltdrive last year for the MBS Matrix2.
Was impressed by its "turning ability" and lightwheight.
Also it needs no machining on the truck itself for the Direct Drive.
Made this basicly also for testing the Spurs without support bearing on high power setups. 

This one is also made with a motormount out of aluminium, together with the thinner gearbox and the smaller gear it gets alot lighter also. And of course cheaper, no truck machining!

Feel free to ask anytime

Why actually?, i asked myself why you started with that fancy machining on the Trucks cause the Belt and chain Drive mounts also worked without machining. is it really worth, or even impossible to get exact spur-alignment without machining them?

The Trampa trucks turn way better than what's shown in the picture. I didn't realize when I took it, but several bushings were damaged and needed to be replaced. 

And the other pic is with yellow shockblocks. These are way too loose for anything over 15mph or so IMO (better off w/orange).

I guess i anyway would have to ride them by myself to feel the difference.
But would you say that the Matrix 2 really have feelable better Turnability compared to Vertigos ??

I've only been able to ride the Matrix build once so far, so nowind could probably give a more accurate comparison. With orange shockblocks on a loose setting, I didn't really notice a big difference in turning radius compared to yellow dampas, but I drilled 1/4" holes down through the center of each dampa, so they're a little looser than what they would be otherwise.

Both trucks ride and turn really well. I like that the Matrix2 offer a greater range in turning capability. You can get super loose with yellow shocks, or switch to orange and crank 'em down if you're going for speed. I like the look of the Trampa trucks though with hole cut through the top for the holypro deck and all. Very cool design.
```

## \#201 Posted by: Nowind Posted at: 2017-04-05T05:59:45.327Z Reads: 344

As @benjammin mentioned the posted pictures from his tread are not a fair compare.
The Yellow MBS shockblocks are super soft, you could compare them with a Trampa Truck without Dampas, as used in Street Carver config. For an offroad board its to soft IMO. If you go with the harder Orange Shocks from MBS it gets better, without adding preload through the adjusters they still super soft, using the adjusters will make them harder and good for 40-50kmh IMO. Comparable with Trampa on yellow Dampas, little preloadet.

@notger
the reason for machining the Trampatrucks  is that this are forged hangers, good for strenght but they come out little different. Spurs will last longer with nice geometrics. 
The MBS Matrix2 is extrudet profile, better for geometric maybe for wheight too, but strength not.

Long Story short : 
DirectDrive on machined Trampa Vertigo with support bearing is best IMO.

Cheers
Jenso

First up I think this is awesome and love your style Jens. I want to pull the trigger myself, but if there is anything that makes me think? it is using a 10 tooth spur gear (I can see it is to make the gear box a size with your target gearing). As the gear gets smaller with less teeth the angle (pitch) between the teeth increases and the gear becomes less efficient. 13 teeth at a minimum 14 or better 15 teeth for optimal drive train efficiency on a bike... I can't help but think the drive train would be more robust with a 4:1 ratio and a higher KV motor? only time will tell and you have infinite more experience than me so no doubt I'm just another asshole sharing a erroneous opinion... Ha! 
Keep blowing shit up, ill be watching with glee

I think you mean lower KV ... otherwise it makes no sense for me

Maybe for the gearbox better what you suggested i agree... but for motor performance a more reduced gearbox will be better

So you have to decide whats more important.... 

I think its similar with Belt or Chaindrive, a smaller motorgear will wear out faster....

But as seems that the wear of the gears is not critical.... so i still think that the gearratio is right

The only issue for me is finding all of the parts and you have done a good job describing my only concern is I can't find your website anymore which I believe is where are you has these 80 mm motor mounts for these double bad boy Leopards... As well as wanting to buy everything today or as many parts as I can for this build.. please direct me to the link to your website and to these 80 mm motor mounts which are very similar to the trampa chain drive ones.... Although, actually with the red trucks and that super heavy duty belt which even has the red to match the trucks and motors please help me list getting to a site to purchase those mounts... Thank you my friend!!!!
