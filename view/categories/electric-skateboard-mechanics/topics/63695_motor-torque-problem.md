Could be a battery problem or a receiver problem. 
Need more info on your build and setup. Under the hood pictures will help. 
I had something similar and it was due to the location of my receiver being too close to the motor phase wires or battery wires. That can cause interference.

Hi,  

Resolved! Manty thanks @sayekim! 
I moved receiver outside of the enclosure and the strange torque stopped.
