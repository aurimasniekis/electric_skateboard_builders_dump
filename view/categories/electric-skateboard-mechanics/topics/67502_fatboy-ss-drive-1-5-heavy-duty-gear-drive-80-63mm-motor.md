Did you mean motor gear here by chance?

Will owners of current drives have a choice to upgrade to gain these benefits? :smile:

I don't know yet, but something similar to other drives but a bit more expensive as it has more parts :)

Well, motor gears are already aluminum. But not I am talking about wheel gears

Color its first batch as I want red and other beta testers like red too :)

hub adapters? You meant wheel hub mounting plates? If so not a single part should be compatible with etoxx as this is more massive and uses bigger bolts ;) If you need extra plates for more wheels it can be arranged ;)

@Kug2lis 

The 80100 motors what KV rating did you get them in? 
What size motor shaft did you order?
For the 63100S or 6384S options from APS what is the shaft length needed. The standard 6384 shaft length didn't fill the motor pulley all the way.  I think these questions will help those looking to get this awesome setup. 

My board with 170KV is way to fast and lost all the hill climb ability with the 4:1 drives.  But the sound is awesome and straight line power and speed is awesome, just 30+ miles per hour on the 200mm wheels is beyond my comfort zone.
```

## \#31 Posted by: nevstar Posted at: 2018-12-16T18:42:00.385Z Reads: 233

```
I dropped back to the Trampa 136KV Motors 6364S and this is the right mix of power and top speed. The 170KV from Alien are just too fast and the AMPS for take off overpowered what my batteries could push out.

I recommend the Trampa 136kv if you are using the 200mm wheels. You'll also have to modify the length of the Trampa motor shaft by cutting off around 5mm.

how bad are the hills around your area? I have several boards ranging from 5055, 6355, 6374 and 8085 with 135kv to 250kv. The perfect motors for me has always been 6374 192kv because it provides more torque than I need which translate to fun but also allow me to go up to 40mph. If we're just talking about a normal daily drive board then 6355 170kv is perfect. Obviously, I also have to account for weight, with my backpack I'm around 190lb. 

8085 and 80100 on 192kv with 1:5, on the other hand, is just pure carnage. Leaving aside the top speed, the torque is so powerful that the wheelies are only "manageable" at 70% power output, and that's with increasing the wheel size to 229mm. But this is my favorite set up right now because it is just incredibly fun popping wheelies.

My advice is this, if you're using your board for commuting, go for 6355 or 6374 1:4 but if you're a torque junky like me, definitely go for 80mm motors. I promise you that you'll never want to go back down to 63mm motors ever again. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 

Either way, ride on my friends!

185kV

don't order from APS any custom shaft it will be a disaster... Ordered to make it 10mm and specific length received angle grinder cut length without anything covered or modified like requested.

You don't need to fill whole length just enough so that keyway and grub screws could reach it :)

No, drive train only works with 5 star trampa/fatboy wheel hubs. We didn't liked MBS wheel hubs as they are plastic and has bad integrity (deforms on the load)

All wheels with a plastic hub will deform under load  it's not specific to MBS wheels, Trampa wheels do it as well. 

That's actually one of the things that keep a lot of hardcore street thrashers from using MTB products. The only option that performs well is a an aluminum wheel, but an 8in aluminum wheel with tire and tube weight almost twice as much as a 6 in aluminum wheel and 4 to 6 times as much as a pla6tic wheel.

What is the difference between those two drives?

Only things I can see is support for 80mm motor + an extra screw on top of the red one. Also the support for MBS trucks with the black one. Is that it? And is one more suitable for jumping than the other?
