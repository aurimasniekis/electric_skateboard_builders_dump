I am searching for a source to buy Pulleys Belts e.g. In Germany. 
I hope someone can help me :slight_smile:

That's what I need...:

Also, do you think it's a good setup?
With VESC SK3 6374 149kv?


Regards!

Located in Germany too.
I buy most stuff from mädler.de. But only Rawmaterial, you have to do some machining.

Have an look by Trampa, they have really nice wheel/mutorpulleys for 15mm Belts. Fits to their Carver Wheels 83mm....

i'm not sure where they are exactly, but when I ordered from bnb(in the us) belts were from "optibelt omega" made in germany. the quality is very good.

Optibelt Omega is nice, if they dont hold up you can choose Omega HP, they are about double that strong. But also double the price (-;
