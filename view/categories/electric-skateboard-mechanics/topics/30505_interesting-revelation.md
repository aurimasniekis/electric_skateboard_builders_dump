I'm using a Two Bare Feet deck here in the UK and in my haste of building, fitted some wider trucks. I'm having trouble with the wider trucks so out of curiosity while my 218 TB Trucks arrive I fitted the originals...hobby king and I'm assuming any caliber style mounts fit the standard trucks! 
Turns out TBF use a caliber clone. 

Could be a cheap way into Esk8 if you only need the drive train and mount to fit it all.

Ninja Edit ( TWO Bare Feet :smile:)

on a similar note I've always wondered about using the Churchill / Funbox trucks:

they seem to have a similar square profile. I might have a pair still lying around, so I'll check later :)

Google will know more, especially now I've spelled the name right.
