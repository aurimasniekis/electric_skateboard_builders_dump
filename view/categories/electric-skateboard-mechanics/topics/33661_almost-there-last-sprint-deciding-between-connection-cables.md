So im almoste there to my first electric longboard. There is only one more thing to buy. Connections cables. I read in differend threads about XT90, XT60, antispark and more. For example that using two XT90 connectors in your longboard build could end in blown up batteries. I ain't gonna mess with those cables! So i rather ask this wonderful community for help. That said, here are my 'important' specs:

**_Batteries 2x_**:

**_Hxt to hx_** (Didnt found hx90. And i didnt found a Hxt to hx male and femal eigher, that would have made the next cable not required):

**_Hx Cable_**:

**_Antispark Loop Key_**

(Is that even antispark / do i have to make one myself?)

Is there any hope or would my system just implode in an instant :grin: ?

I have my system connected with a loop key without problem so far but with the bms help. 

A good thing would be to have a bms with a switch. This would save you lots of problems. I just turn the switch off then connect the loop key then i turn the switch on and there you go never had a problem with that so far.

14awg is a bit light for me personally. As a series connector it is exposed to total current, check to see it can handle your anticipated loads and in use i'd watch it doesn't heat up too much.

Unless you have plugged the batteries together to make a circuit? XT90 connectors are rated at 90Amps and are good connectors when used within there design specification. So I am unsure what you are eluding to here bro? 

Do you have a soldering iron?

find a local store that sells wires and only buy the connectors. use a solder iron and make your own cables with whatever connectors you need.

I think it would get you cheaper . 6euro for a loop key.? that is just an xt90 with the heads connected .

You can usually find wires at rc cars shops. as cobber said is a bit too tiny the awg14 im running awg 10 for batteries and awg12 for motors . (some would say is overkill with awg 10 and awg12 would work just fine)

That loop key does not look like an anti-spark XT90 connector...

ill definitely try that, but what is the difference between awg14 and awg10?

do you know if there is a good tutorial video for doing this specific for longboard cables?

All good bro, just _measure twice, cut once_ as they say.
Do you research, double check everything.

the amount of current it can handle. Awg 10 will be thicker so larger area more amps.

that wiki site is a little bit confusing. if i'm right awg14 might be a bit too thin because it doesn't handles amp that good? so how much does 14/12 and 10 awg handle?

and what side do i need? battery or esc :disappointed_relieved:

on wiki you have a table with all awgs and the amps and dimensions etc. idk about these connectors you got there xt60 xt90 are better in my opinion. 

Ro you have access to an solder iron ? or could you get one or something . then you wont depend on the few wires and connectors from hobbyking. where you from?

well i need those hxt4mm for my batteries. but ill buy xt90 too for my vesc and loop key.
ill buy myself a solder iron, only 15â‚¬ (germany). but these last connectors i posted seem fine to me. they are made to be used by a solder iron.

then if you need it for the batteries get the batteries end :-)) 

If you want to be sure look at batteries connector and see where is the black wire connected. the look for a wire with the oposite connector on the black wire . this is the only difference om the battery and esc connectors

You don't need a series adapter with HXT 4mm connectors.  Carefully slice the thin plastic between the positive and negative plugs.  Then A+ can be plugged directly into B-  (Just don't plug A+ into A-!!)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/2/c2ea1b25386e6a15ebf3c35c13a6e9517a16cb99.JPG" width="666" height="500">

NO you connected + to + and the circuit will connect - to - and you will have a bang..

If you want to connect the batteries in series you need to connect the red(+) form the first battery to the black(-) of the 2nd batery and you will have 1 + from the 2nd battery and 1 - from the first battery.

Then connect the loop key on the red wire

DUDE NO you did the same thing . Now you connected - to - and + will close the loop with + and will KABOOM


Connect + from first battery to - of the 2nd battery then you will have the - from the first and the + from the 2nd and this is your battery in series. Follow Sorrentino's diagram

:joy: good thing is started this topic. ye i see, just thought i could do a serieal connector with hxt, saw it on a video and thought that would be safer, ill skip that part then. but is the bottom part right? hxt to XT-male and XT-femal? can i do this?

Yes the logic looks better but the colors i dont like ...  

Now the battery part is alright connected in series. then -> under he  'HXT' text you have the red wire from the battery why do you connect it to a black wire just to go back to red inside the vesc. Same with the black wire from the battery that is going to a red wire then back to black wire. 

Be really careful with this before you connect your battery to the vesc. When you get your parts id suggest you to ask first if the way you want to connect them is ok so you dont fry anything. 

Also please read posts on this forum. You will find all you need to konw you will see how other built their board and what were the problems. Take a week and read just read. Search about batteries how to connect them how to recharge them etc.
