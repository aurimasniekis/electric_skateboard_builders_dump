You can replace just the magnet. Be sure to use loctite that can withstand high temps tho

Which motor is it and how long you have it?
If it’s not too old you might get a replacement.
Just speak with the be vendor.

The cut looks clean so you could have good changes to glue it back with green loctite or epoxy.
Better to replace the full magnet, but to glue back the broken part should work too

don't the magnets in the motor stagger in polarity? + - + - + -? if so make sure you glue in on correctly

Cracked or broken magnets can lose their properties so best to replace the whole thing.

Let me just say @torqueboards customer service is the shit. They were so willing to fix my 6355 when it turned out it was just my stupid mistake and the motor worked fine ( tested it today and all good). Now they are replacing magnets for a motor that i purchased second hand. I’ll definitely be getting more from you guys soon!!! This 6374 i got needs a partner!
