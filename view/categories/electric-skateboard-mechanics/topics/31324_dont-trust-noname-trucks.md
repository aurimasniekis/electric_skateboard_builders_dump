Hi guysðŸ˜‰
Today I had fail with my noname trucks. Way to work all was fine, some runs with 38km/h and mostly 25-30km/h. Then back home I just started to ride about 16km/h and hear that something drops on road, then I felt that my board feels a bit superloose on trucks, and I'm still riding. Than, yeah I saw what happened, kingpin of front truck was snapped. No fall or something, but there was traffic. I'm glad that nothing serious happened. Just day before I was racing in local park with 40km/h, downhills und uphills. 
Here is some pics:

Damn man!  Glad you are OK and it failed pretty safely for you.  It seems like everything held up correctly, so just replace the kingpin?  

I wonder if the other truck's kingpin shows any abnormal wear or shows warning of pre-failure?

This is actually very common.  To prevent snapping a kingpin, you should always use **Grade 8 kingpins**. They will have the following marking on the head:

Take a look at your trucks and replace the kingpins if the don't have these 6 hexagonal dashes.  Your local hardware store should have them.   Grade 5 bolts have three stripes.  If your kingpins have no marking, they are the lowest quality and are prone to breaking

Snapping a kingpin is not fun, but I have never had a Grade 8 bolt fail on me

I got you until you can find some more expensive ones you like. These are Grade 5 but i'm getting Grade 8s pretty soon. I want to have both since there is a price difference and the Grade 5s were available immediately.

I picked up replacement kingpins from my local hardware supplier 3" for 80p ($1.02) each! Grade 8.

Don't go to a skate shop, go to a hardware warehouse.
