I've got a MBS Comp 95 that has Matrix II trucks.  I ran up on a 2012 Arbor Vugenhausen the other day that I had to have.  Now I'm thinking about putting the Matrix II hardware on it, just for the hell of it.  My issue is the geometry.  

As I understand it the Matrix II trucks are 0 degrees.  I can put some 10 degree wedges on them, have them on hand, but will that give me any turn radius?  I really can't justify the @okp [risers](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/unikboards-group-buy-trampa-mounts-angled-risers-mbs-matrix-pro-mounts/19849).  As bad ass as they are, they are also really expensive.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to make the Matrix II trucks usable on a standard deck?

Get several different degree risers and stack them. They're made that way, but it can get a little weird when you have to get extra long bolts and they have to normally be installed at a slight angle in order to fit.

Print them/have them printed out of nylon or higher shore value TPU (offered by extrudr).

I don't like the idea of using 3d printed risers, too much of a chance of separation.  I might give it a try but it 's worrisome.  Thanks for the suggestion though.

I wonder if x2 15 degree risers stacked would give me a decent turning radius?

I don't know to be honest...but slalom skaters like using those risers and stack them, and they say it works. But I really don't see why it shouldn't though.

Almost impossible to separate tpu when printed at a high temperature (250). I have tried.

I ordered the Khiro 15 degree risers, if that doesn't work I'll look at printing some.  I modeled some awhile back, guess I need to pull them back out :slight_smile:.

I think it may worth doing a simple version in ABS UV. I had put a lot of details on them and designed them with no compromise from a full AL7075 rock,  looking at some of my wife jewels but I'm sure we can simplify them and get a cheaper version.

i'd just diy
make some.
either out of hardwood or alloy
I would also make them longer than they need be so you can use two sets of hardware and counter sink the bolt head holes on a angle so both sets have a straight pull.

I thought about making some out of scrap decks and using a jig to sand them to shape, but Id rather have something made for the purpose.  Im working on some models now.

No doubt, I just hate to spend the money when I haven't even ridden the trucks yet :slight_smile:

Hey man...check out this guy's thread

Towards the end he makes them out of hand cut aluminum

I know you already have the vugenhaisen, but  The word on the street is you like to collect skateboards.

I have a Bustin YoFace double kick, that, or a similar deck would get you ~10° to start with if you screwed them to the kick tails..
Then  add 15° of wedging and  you are in the ballpark.

If you check the next poster @paragon he has a CNC file... He may be willing to share...doesn't hurt to ask

you can use them with any zero angle trucks though. I used them with Trampa's. Although i totally get it if you don't want to use Trampa trucks lol

Im probably just gonna fab something up with aluminum stock to see if I like the trucks.  If so Il  see about investing in some @okp risers.

Im not saying I would walk first, but I will have some good kicks just in case :slight_smile:

Trampa claims the plastic baseplate holding the bearing will become oval relatively quickly. Would be interesting to see how they hold up.

I still havan't had any issues with matrix II baseplates (may be a different story if were hitting jumps all the time). Only like $13 to replace though if need be.

I can tell you that the channel trucks coupled with the older 20° mountain boards make it turn like a crippled semi truck. I'd say you need at least a 30° angle to make them work right. I have these risers/wedges on my list as something to figure out, although @paragon's CNC'd bits look pretty nice. My partially thought out plan was to go to Tap Plastics or something and get a chunk of scrap HDPE, and carve out a pair of 35° wedges. These baseplates are oddly shaped and I wanted to have something that fit the wide shape better than the narrow skate wedges.
