Hey Guys!
I've seen a lot of people running a lot of different gearings- some for speed some for torque. 
I recently moved up wheels to 107s and my start off the line is not as satisfying with a 180lb rider on 16/36. I use a throttle curve as well so lower end is definitely lacking a little bit. I want to keep the curve though as I like to limit initial amps to tb vescs. 
My question: What's your experience of 16/40 and 16/44 on 107s or even any wheel and gearing for torque. :slight_smile:

For reference: Battery - 10s4p, Dual 6374. Batt max: 30A, Motor max: 70A

Move that Batt Max to 40 each!  I don't have much to compare it to, but my torque is great with 15/40 on dual 6374 12s5p 60/-50.    50/-12

About to go to 70/-60   50/-12.

Unfortunately I've got some TB VESCS not FOCBOXES :frowning: . I think the tb limit is 40a so I limit mine to 30a to stay safe :confused: So I have to compensate with increased gearing.

15/36 On 110mm.. I'm pretty happy and fat
I guess I like the slow startup, as it keeps me from going too crazy

Running dual rear 6374, 15/40, 107mm, 70A motor max, 40A batt max, 10A batt min on each vesc. This is sometimes a little bit too much acceleration. my front trucks lifting when Ipull max acceleration, even though I am leaning forward.

EDIT: 3D printed pulleys in PETG aswell

The golden spot for normal and fun riding is dual 6374, 16/40, 107mm, 60A motor max, 30A batt max, 10A batt min and some good breaking for your motor.

```
You should adjust the gearing to keep the top speed as close to the speed you want to ride, the torque/acceleration you adjust on the current values

The same thing to @trancejunkiexxl, if you have top speed to spare and increase the wheel pulley and decreased the currents limits, you would keep the same acceleration with a lower current running trough your system == more efficiency == more range

Insane! and that's a lower reduction than 16/44. I never go full throttle off the bat but geez. :slight_smile: Thank you for the info! what battery type do you have?

Yeah I currently top out around 41mph when my battery is full. but I think that must have been slight downhill. On land I was sure was very flat I hit around 39mph. With the esk8 calc it says I should be around 27mph but from experience it'll be closer to 29/30 which is perfectly fine for me as I cruise at 15-25 most of the time. I think motor max 70 and batt max 30 is still pretty conservative. What are your thoughts?

Edit: this is with 85% motor efficiency, is this accurate?

```
If the top speed is good for you then there is no point changing the gearing, what VESC are you using? 85% is a good estimate, but what matters is real life speed, I like to gear to have the top speed even at almost empty battery, for exemple, my board could go 45 Km/h, but I limit it to 33 Km/h and this way I have the same top speed across all charge levels, but loose some torque

oh what I mean is that with 16/44 the top speed would then be around 29/30 which I am fine with. 41 was a little bit too much for my taste and useless on most occasions lol :smiley: . I think i'll go for the 16/44. Looking forward to jaw dropping torque :smiley:

I would imagine that 16/40 would fir your needs perfectly, its what im running now on my build and although the second motor isnt attached yet, I feel like its a pretty well rounded gearing

Yeah, it will be better, then you can fine tune in the current settings, you probably can increase to 80A or more if your VESC can handle, but I have no experience with larger motors, there is a point that the only thing you are doing in making more heat

Dual Sk3 6374 10s batt max 40

Running 14 / 32 on the 107s with 15mm belts

Its got more than enough pickup for me right now, probably won't gear this build any faster in the future since I haven't been hanging as much around the top end

Do you know a good place foe 16t 15mm motor pullies?

I am changing up all sorts of stuff right now.  Might run 12s5p 16/40 on the La croix deck.... on urethane 107s...  

Swap the Bludgeon over to 6 shooters with Surf Rodz TKPs.

What is the reason for not going lower than 16t with dual 6374? I've only just finished my build and it currently has a 15/40 setup on those motors. Done nearly 40 miles testing this weekend, and I do have a pair of 16t gears in my parts box I could fit. 

What improvements (apart from a couple of extra mph - which frankly I don't need to be fair) can I expect if I fit them?

Cheers

If your happy with 15T it's fine .

16T will get you a little more speed, and perhaps a little less chance of belt slipping .

I'm not unhappy with the current set-up, anything but, however I've nothing to compare with eSK8 wise so still got plenty of experimenting to do.

I found 25mph a bit scary if truth be told, so right now I'm not really looking for extra speed, but the belt slip point might be something I could consider.

To be honest I enjoy carving at 15mph over straight line blasting 😂

Hey! sole reason is to reduce slippage!

I usually carve around 15-25 mph depending on space available. I rarely go above 28, sometimes i'll hit 35+ for the thrill. I am now gearing down so i'll have a 32 ish max, which is more than enough. I too enjoy 15mph carving and observing scenery to whooshing past everything. I only go fast when I wanna prove how powerful my board is. Mostly to those pre-built boosted shills at school :smiley:

## \#42 Posted by: Sender Posted at: 2018-08-15T12:06:20.881Z Reads: 83

So I have 15/40 on 107s. 

200kv 6369s

10s6p

Each Focbox:

65 motor max
-50 motor min

50 battery max
-12 batt min.

It hits right about 28 maybe 29 mph. It has a ton of acceleration but, kinda feela like when you hit the top speed, there should be more.


I need some more speed. Torque is great, but I want to hit at least low 30s. 

I am going to slide the batt max to 60amp per focbox, they are on a 1/4" heat sink.


So, you guys think 15/36 Or 18/40? 

  I say these two combos because I have both of these options on the way

@Deckoz what do you suggest?  This is on my Lacroix.

Not Deckoz but I’m gonna chime in anyway cause I’m nosey. Won’t be long; 
18/40 would definitely give you more top end speed, seeing as it’s a reduction of about 2.22
15/36 is about 2.4 which is more torquey.
15/36 and 16/40 are more comparable for similar torque. 
But for sure 18/40 more speed :)

One of the benefits of using large wheel pulleys is because you can always increase the motor pulley teeth -- but if it's 15 you can't really decrease it

I'd try 17/40 which should give less rolling resistance and be less likely to skip

## \#54 Posted by: Sender Posted at: 2018-08-16T17:36:25.379Z Reads: 70

Thats what I am really leaning towards and upping my amp limits a bit to help out with the torque decrease due to the new ratio.

I have a big 1/4" hunk of aluminum thermal taped to the enclosure and the FOCBOXs so hopefully that will help the system handle the settings.........?

Going fast is fun AF.  But I like to stay in the sweet zone where I'm going fast enough to have fun and to get places quickly: fast enough to get hurt badly if I fall -- but not so fast that falling means I'm gonna die LoLz

For me, right around 28mph is about my speed I am comfortable never exceeding.  There are *certain places* where I could safely go faster but overall I think that's perfect for me

I just changed out from 15/40 to 18/40 on 107s.  It is on my Lacroix with a 10s6p on thane.  So dope.  No wheel slip at all and hardly any loss of usable torque after I upped motor amps to 85/-65 and batt amps 50/-20.

And it now hits 35 mph easy. Probably a bit more, but I wasn't fully padded out.  

So if you have a big battery, you can run less resuction without losing that fun torque.  So nice.
