I am planning on building my first electric skateboard and it is going to be fast, at least I think so. It will have two 6374 190 kv motors and a 12s battery with a dual 6.6 Vesc. 

I have bean searching forever to find the answer to this question, what wheel size is best? I have been looking at 110mm wheels and 97mm. But I don't know what the best is.

Yes. Please just ask in one thread or at least clog up the [noob thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/noob-question-thread-ask-your-questions-here/9559/) instead!

Notice a pattern? 

Its simple. 
Bigger wheels help higher top speed and cushion the ride more. 

You can get your acceleration back by using larger 40-44t wheel pulleys. 

But smaller wheels fit more decks without wheel bite issues.

Don't start thread for random questions. 
If you honestly come up with a question that has never been asked and never been covered then by all means start a thread about it.  

And all these " what is best"

There's not necessarily one "best" way to make a esk8. There are multiple different Wheels in different sizes that are all great Wheels and each one is best for a different type of build/ rider.

Also since itâ€™s your first board unless you have skate experience you may want to start a little slower because it can be a lot of power to rein in
