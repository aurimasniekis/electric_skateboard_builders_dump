I think he meant cake pans to use as a mold to make enclosures.

Cake trays usually don't have the right dimensions. Look for plant trays - there are some out there with proper dimensions. Thickness should be fine for vesc and 18650 pack

Just buy a sheet of .025" aluminum and bend it on the edge of a table or 2x4.

these are for my new swappable packs with CopperFinish (not copper). 
perfect size! 3d printed end caps! :nerd: 

or i'll make some custom for you. I want an excuse to build a cheap metal break/bender for cleaner lines! ;)

Although this thread is old, @saul are you still willing to make 3d end caps? I m a new DIY esk8 builder just learning the ropes. Any new info regarding your design? (ie any issues or still solid).

How to attach to board? I figure if you screw into wood then are constantly opening/closing enclosure the holes (which you have to do to charge batteries) are going wear out soon. Advice appreciated. Thx.

You don't need to open up to charge, use a bms and a charge port. There's loads of info on the forum regarding that.

Generally people either bolt through the deck and countersink on top or use inserts and drill to right under the grip to bolt in to.

Do some reading, all the info you are after will be here in abundance
