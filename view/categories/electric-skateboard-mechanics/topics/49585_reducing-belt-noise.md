It has come to my attention that a lot of the noise caused by belt drive systems are well... from the belts, even in BLDC. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how belt noise can be reduced? Maybe idlers? Tight/loose belts?

Loose wide belts that are aligned straight.

Check your belts for shrapnel...I get metal debris ebmbedded inside all the time...

running loose helps (speaking from experience), but as mentioned earlier can only be done (safely) if your belts are properly aligned.

Would also not recommend doing that with a motor pulley that has less than 15T. Idler pulley recommended to engage more teeth.
