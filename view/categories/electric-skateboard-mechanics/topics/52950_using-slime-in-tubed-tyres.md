Anyone have any experience/ feedback on the use of slime tube sealant in typical skate small diameter tubed tyres?

I have used multi-seal with great success. I had an audible hissing and the tire would go flat in 15 minutes. No such problems anymore. MULTI SEAL Tire Sealant with KEVLAR â€” Sportsman Formula, 32 fl. oz https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071QWCW42/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_jyL2AbGZA9DWA

yeah some like it, how often do you get flats?
just sucks if you get a blow out as you get covered in slime! If this happens take a picture :rofl:
I don't use it as I use wheel balance beads in my tires (to keep them balanced at speed).

One of my china boards has 6" pneumatics, which I flatten 3 of my first 2 hours.

A squirt of that exact bottle and a spin and they haven't gotten a flat since. Riding in the same areas its been about 60 miles without a flat. I use the same bottle to fix my daughters and the neighborhood kids tires. 

There may be a better/more professional version out there but so far I have had nothing but luck with slime in the last 10 years
