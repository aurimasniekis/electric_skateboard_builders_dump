I feel like my wheels are wobbling:

It's fine. My wheels wobble due to small issues in fit from the bearing or on the axle.

Does it affect the timing belt because it‚Äôs been making some noise.

Will it do any long lasting damage to anything?

kinda looks like your wheel pulley is not centered. Since chuttney1 said it could be the bearing, you should switch out the bearing see if you got the same issue.

I tried switching out the bearing already but it still wobbles.

Actually, I forgot to mention it does affect the timing belt lifespan after gee responded. I was referencing a regular wheel with no pulley, but oops. At least I think the run-out on your pulley is better than mine.

Does it look too wobbly and bad. Should I take it off?
That would be a pain because I already used locktite.

It's really fine. Gimme a few minutes to show really bad run-out. I drilled the holes on my own pully and the holes weren't concentrically spaced after checking on the mill.

Is the tooth wear and belt rubbing on wheel recent?

Yeh a few weeks ago I noticed it and adjusted it.

You should be able to get less wobble out of it

It's not really that bad, but I would say you could make it better by finding the high spot in your pulley and then turning the closest bolt half a turn, until it's better.

Here's that example of very bad pulley alignment. I'm lucky my belt hasn't failed, but the belt has been stretched to the point the rubber is cracking. Ignore the metal shim coming off the side of the pulley. I made a precision truck, and I still need to fix the fit of the wheel on the axle

Alright I will try to adjust it tonight, see what happens.

I've had this exact same issue as you. It doesn't affect riding at all, and I didn't notice any additional wear because of it. But exactly what psychotiller said, I made a small adjustment on the bolts to straighten it out and that fixed it. Good luck!

You could try to mount the pulley to a different wheel. See if it's the wheel wobbling or the pulley.

I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the wheel because all of them wobble.
