Over the many years ive been building boards i have owned almost every mount on the market and have destroyed most of them. It became obvious that there is a pattern how they fail and some clear design errors that should be avoided. I wont repeat the details but you should read that old post. 

Basically metal being too thin in areas that have unnecessary holes for crossbars and belt tensioners or to save weight. These things must be carefully designed leaving enough metal to be structurally stable.

Its come time for me to buy some mounts again. After my research i have concluded that 90% of mounts on the market or being made in this forum by users are faulty and will snap eventually. 

I have brought up this topic here a few times abouts motor design and mount design but it was a while ago and the new 
DIYers seem to not read posts that old. 

This is a link to thew old discussion. 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/beware-of-motors-with-this-common-design/9075/24?u=mikeomania12

here is my update of weaknesses in the new designs ive found. All the following mounts have design flaw that should be corrected.

I couldn't agree more with all of this. Mounts need beef. And they need more simplicity, not more gadgetry. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BZZcSOqFsO8/?taken-by=longhairedboy

These are @okp 's design. After breaking as many mounts as you have, including enertion, alien, polarboards, and torqueboards, I have finally found the perfect mount in Paris. 

This is a fixed angle, single piece mount for caliber/clones with minimum fasteners, minimum pieces, and maximum "stay the fuck put". I'm putting my name on them and ten of them will be here in a couple of weeks. I've already got one customer returning his board for replacement mounts due to the over complexity of most diy mounts. 

So if you make your own, and i hope a lot of you will because its very rewarding, remember these simple things:

1) more beef
2) less complexity
3) fewer parts
4) tighter fits and bigger bolts or grubs.

Sigh, if you're snapping mounts literally in half routinely then you're doing something wrong. While I do agree that durability should be #1 in motor mount design, so are a lot of other factors.

All these mounts are a compromise. They all have pros and cons including mine which is pictured. If you make a simple mount then people will complain of lack of features like idlers and adjust ability. It is not a one size fits all, and that shows with all the pockets.


9/10 motor mount reliability issues are from loosening and not snapping.

On a side note, how is it possible to snap a mount and not break the motor?

Aluminum, even 7075, are not very forgiving when it comes to crashes. When it yields it remains that shape pretty much forever, there is no revising it. With carbon, there is little motor cooling capability and a chance of delamination. It is quite brittle.

I am glad you brought it up though, as I am in in the works of exactly what you're talking about. Simple, cheap, bulky. It won't have any fancy features but...yeah

I made a simple two-piece mount but got rid of the ability to have an insert for adjustable angle of the mount. Sucks, but it fixes belt alignment issue for longevity.

The four extra holes in the clamp are for an additional clamp piece to add rigidity, but now that I have them on the board, I think I'll just omit them, they don't seem needed. They're 0.375" thick 6061.

Nobody will buy this. Unless this is meant to be modded first this is pretty much useless. Where do you mount the motor? How does it get attached to the truck? Plus it's not even wide enough for the motor to sit on

It would only be peer reviewed if you also tested all of the listed mounts and everyone of them would have failed at the proposed positions. I doubt that. Some of those mounts seem actually quite sturdy and he does not even take material thickness or material grade into account.
Also the load is omitted completely apparently - one of the mounts in the initial post has a slot for a tensioner - the thin wall next to it will see like no load at all - why should it be thicker? If anything the problem with that mount might be the material loss due to the tensioner slot.
But I am no material scientist so would like some actual scientific explanation for it.

Note the quotes i used. they were meant to signify a lesser meaning. I was trying to point out that it was no longer just horse shit somebody was starting to post but instead backed by other people having the same experience. That experience is as follows: 

 I have broken every single model of mount i've ever used. Most of them have mostly survived my customers so far but none of them have survived me indefinitely; I was seriously looking into a welding kit to start doing slabs and rings. Except the one i've posted here. I've had these mounts on for about 5 months now and they haven't budged. No misalignment, no creep whatsoever. Even when i banged out a bearing and the wheel rolled out and the whole board dropped to one side and slid it out on the mount, the damned thing stayed aligned. Even without the cross bar that is supposed to help it stay aligned. IT it STILL aligned and i still haven't done shit to it for adjustment.  And this is on a hangar that has divots from enertion clamps AND DIY grubs. Not ideal conditions at all. 

We accept test subjects. A few people have sent us mounts and we've destroyed them and told them how and sent them pics. We mentally record our findings. We use those findings to posit theories. We test those theories on new test subjects and mentally record our findings. Rinse, repeat, resolve. Sounds like science to me. 

So fine. I have independently reviewed his findings and i agree with them. I just won't call myself his peer or formalize the entire process. 

If you want to argue the semantics of executing the scientific method then none of are scientists. I keep terrible notes if any at all and often just move on to the next thing without saying anything to anyone because i know this or that is shit and that other thing is good because this broke and that didn't. I don't have time for that shit really.  Just call me Dr Venkman. I don't need precision measurements to look at a mount and tell you its shit. Neither does the op. Other people walking in off the street want to know what works. They don't need precision measurements either to know shit mounts are shit, we just tell them what to look for and then tell the designers of the mounts what to not do.

Thank you for bringing up your concern.  One little suggestion, if you are going to make any claim about a bad design of anyone mount please give it the courtesy of buying one of their mount.  Install it, test it, ride it and not abuse it, and if it breaks post it on this forum so we can all put our head together and see how to improve it.  FYI:  if you are interested in giving my mount a try,  it is $50 including US shipping.  It includes 3/8" thick clamp, 3/16" thick motor arm, dual idlers(4 bearings), and stainless hardware.  To see more pictures of my mount please click on following link:

Thank you for sharing pictures of the broken mounts.  Side note: on one of the picture I was surprised to see the motor is still in good shape and hadn't broke off from the mount.  Motor is usually held by 4 x M4 screws (4mm or 5/32" diameter), I was expected these screws to break-off before damages are done to the thick aluminum plate.

No matter what I did, rotating slots always failed me.  I eventually removed the rotating feature all together (motor plate rotating about hangar clamp)

My clamp has tapped blind holes. Red loctite failed within 2 blocks, even after cleaning the bolts and letting the loctite cure for 48 hours. Maybe if you had thru holes with locknuts on the other side it would be a different story

If you're designing a motor mount, I would first 3D print a motor plate with rotating slots. Then find out what angle you need and remove the slots from the design before machining your metal mount

TL;DR -  Rotating slots. Just say no.

[/quote]

Did you apply the loctite to the bolt or the hole? When red loctite fails, in my experience, it was applied wrong. Properly applied loctite should not come off without heating parts with a blowtorch. This has always been my experience with it so I wonder if you somehow applied it wrong. 

For blind threaded holes, the loctite should be applied to the hole and not the screw. If the loctite is applied to the screw, it will get pushed out of the hole and threads as you put the screw in. You're supposed to appl the loctite to the hole and tap it a little so that it flows down the threads before putting in the screw.

On my mount with set screws I haven't gotten the rotational part to get loose. It has come loose once but that was cause I ran zero loctite. Now that I put blue it doesn't seem to budge. Either way I revamped mine with a 2 piece clamp system with nylon locknuts. I have also gone with a through-hole design that uses m4 12.9 bolts, so no stripping there. Hopefully it holds up!

For those not familiar with the wonder of Loctite 290, it allows you to apply loctite after you align and tighten without having to disassemble to add loctite. If you have a threaded thru-hole or nut and bolt, you can apply the 290 on the back side and it'll seep into the thread, I find running the motor to vibrate the board helps get it in nice and deep quickly, you can literally see a drop seep into the threads. It has a very small particle size and very viscous.

You should try mine sometime, I doubt you would break it!  I focused specifically on making a mount that would not flex or lose adjustment. We also use the extra thickness and create more surface area and mass for heat sinking and cooling fins. A wide mounting clamp and precise mating surface is very important. The idea of going back to clamping mounts on uneven fresh castings...

I am going to go out on a limb here and say that anything short of this in a belt drive is basically a toy. Thin motor mounts will flex and break due to metal fatigue. You can feel the difference in how the board lays down the power with a stiff motor mount. We also use really small drive pulleys in eskate so an idler is mandatory if you want enough teeth in mesh. May seem like a gadget but they run loose and the belts wont skip. @200lbs this is important!

Since I use an extra bearing pressed into the mount you could probably mount a stator to it and gain some room between mounts by ditching the motor base. Be nice on a custom dual rear, a good way to lose excessive truck width and get some responsiveness back!

technically no, the space the device occupies stretches, taking the device with it. From the device's perspective, nothing has stretched. But from the perspective of someone not affected by the undulating elasticity of space within gravity fields, the whole canvas gets pulled around, not just the subject. 

therefore timing belts don't stretch. lol

@chaka send me a set. If i can't break them, i'll endorse them! I need to get my lathe working anyway. And i have a set of cast  ronins i don't have any mounts for.

Hey guys been super busy last week. Sorry I haven't been able to answer. 


http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/revisit-bad-motor-mount-designs/37075/6?u=mikeomania12

Yes science, Im an engineer. Real life experiment with many diff mount designs and realize a pattern then repeat and reproduced by peers. 

Actually look at this thread from many years ago. 
http://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=72994#p1103124

Jason himself posted it and calculated through experimentation that any place on the mount with less than 6mm thick of aluminum will not survive. 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/revisit-bad-motor-mount-designs/37075/7?u=mikeomania12
Your mount looks ok. Mainly because your mounts thickness looks much more than 6mm thick(most mounts thickness). so that could help add strength for those extra holes. But i would remove them to be more confident. Side  note i dont like the one sided clamp system. Make it double sided or no clap at all. Just set scres with a tight fit can work very well also.

I cant say for certain since i didnt use them but @chaka mounts look sick. (@chaka Please send me them for testing/destruction) Even though they have many holes this is counteracted by much increased mount thickness. Or if you must have thinner mount to save space on your motor shaft then go with steel. like this one.

Also an example is the @Kaly mounts are designed very well.

I dont buy products that i dont think are designed well. Yes please send them to me for free and i will test them gladly. 

I did not make this thread to say that i have broken yours.  This thread is about education on bad design and how to improve it. So just from your pictures i see many places with material too thin. I just used your mount's picture for an example. 

Also i have broken my motors plate with screws also when that design was weaker than the mount was. again see this post from a while back.

@Mikeomania12. After reading this thread i need to redo my mount.  Specifically increase the bolt radius for the trucks mount for a 40T pulley and reduce the idler slot size to thicken the mount at the edge.  

Thoughts?

The problem with most motor mounts is not the motor plate, but the hangar clamp.  Cast trucks have a lot of variability and require surfacing for a precise fit. Couple that with the fact that the axle on all cast trucks is very rarely straight, the axle diameter has too much slop, and the hangar facing is generally poor. Now you have a problem. A good mount needs to be both secure and perfectly square 

CNC trucks and a two-piece steel clamp made my custom motor mount damn near bulletproof.  I don't even need locktite on the clamp screws

100%

The surf rodz are awesome on this point.  18.95mm face-to-face on all sides for the full length of the trucks.  Makes my life so much easier - calibers drove me insane.

Please don't be mad at me but this is not science. You just circle spots that you feel are too thin without any considerations for load, thickness, or material. Did you actually break all the mounts you posted in exactly those spots or did you do simulations?

Just take @MysticalDork mount where you circled two holes whose sole purpose is to attach a cover I assume. Those will see no forces at all - why would they need to be beefier?

Did you analyse clamping forces as well? Length of threads or bolt thickness should also have a big impact on how tight you can fit the clamp to the truck. Set screws might work but what's the minimum size so that you don't strip the head at the required force?

Nah, those holes (and the one in the middle with the same size) are purely fixturing holes; For holding the aluminum stock in the CNC machine for profile milling. It was easier to just do that than to come up with some more elegant workholding solution.

You bring up a great point, axle alignment. More importantly, wheel pulley alignment. Most pulley drives rely on either a bolt on adapter or an offset bearing race for alignment. In my opinion it is sloppy design but it works.

In our mount, the bearing for the wheel pulley is located along the center line of the belts path so all drive forces from the belt are directly transmitted into motion at the wheel. In contrast a pulley with offset bearings you introduce a bit of yaw when hammering the throttle and some power is lost. Sure I might be splitting hairs but, like a said before, you can feel the difference.

yup. its almost like an extremely subtle rubber banding at launch with the slightly offset bearing in the pulley. On mine the bearing sits just to the side of the belt line, not directly in it. Using a standard insert pulley i would need to remove way too much aluminum to be comfortable from my standard cast calibers to put that bearing in the belt line, but on precision trucks with larger diameter axles it wouldn't be a problem.  

your mounts are sick.

The bearing I use is over 18mm ID. You just cut the corners off most trucks.  Used a slightly smaller diameter on my V1 design.

I find this very interesting because it seems to me that many of the mount designs could easily be better, but also I don't have experience with any of them so I don't know if a real problem actually exists. It would be interesting to see what simple design changes could be made to make mounts stronger and also lighter.

Unfortunately this thread is full of opinions and lacking in any real science or engineering proof.

If you want to prove that mounts are weak or flawed then drawing vague circles on other people's pictures is not the way to do that. It would take very little time to remake some of these mounts in a cad program and run some stress simulations on them. This would both help you verify if your assumptions are correct and also help you illustrate this point to others.  

Likewise if you sell mounts that you think are strong enough you probably already have them in cad. Show us some stress tests and let's get a better idea of what design features make mounts strong and maybe also which places we could save material and weight.

Lacking science and proof? Seems like people these days value computer simulations that are just estimations of the real world over actual real world results. 
I don't know what could be more scientific then repeatedly testing and breaking many diff designs of most of the commercial mounts on the market in the same pattern. Due to the same design flaws. 
You seem to be forgetting that I didn't just circle things I thought were bad about other people's mounts. I also broke many different mounts in those exact areas during use and so did many other veteran builders here that agree. 
Also don't forget that I did not say those mounts are guaranteed to fail or that I have broken those new mounts that are being built by people currently. I simply explained my past experiences and experiments and gave constructive advice on how to improve their designs for more structural strength. That's all. They may very well be good mounts. But with my improvements they will be indestructible. If anyone is in doubt of my real world facts they can go do estimated cad simulation to ease thier mind in thier own. I'm not obligated to do that.

I made the post about the problem and gave the solution in my post. What's not constructive about my clear pictures and advice on how to prevent those problems by designing ur holes in the right places that maintain structural stability. And not to make too many holes either. It's that simple. If u take anything out of this thread it should be that.

I wouldn't recommend anything on the market since every mount I've owned broke. I made one myself that still hasn't broken. Copy of enertion mount but made fully in steel. Not for sale. I never tried ollin mount but from pics it looks very well designed. My advice is for the ppl designing thier own mounts. They need to improve thier designs.

yes the metal on the sides is thin but making it from steel fixes that issue. 

@Evan_Byrne yes ur mounts added thickness should help alot. and u dont have too many holes. just note maybe the bottom part/clamp with all the holes isnt as strong as it could be. the screw heads are countersunk and that also reduces the material and strength at that point. but those screws heads look only 2mm thick. so u still have a good 6mm left there.

If you are designing your own mount, why tension the belt by creating two separate parts? The X shaped mounting pattern for motors is only required if you plan on mass producing the mount and making it compatible for several motor types. Most designs here are a compromise to allow mass production and customisation.

I'd machine it all out to a single piece and just tension it using the motor mount holes. Also no need for an adjustable angle that I see elsewhere.
