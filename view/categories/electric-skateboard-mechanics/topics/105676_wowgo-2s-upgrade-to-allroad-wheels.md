Hey guys, 

Have been wondering if I can upgrade the Wowgo 2S with the Skullboard Airless motors/wheels (check pics below). 

Any thoughts on that? Will the motors/esc work? Can I do it as a straight swap (motors and wheels only) or would I have to buy the complete kit? (last picture) 

Thanks

Sorry to say, but I can guarantee it won't work from experience. Post again on esk8 news forum and I'll explain why there.
