you should try the shape whitepony did on his newest build (basically a vanguard but cut the weird looking noses off).

Looks so nice!

How do you press your decks? Vacuum bag, bolt press or hydraulic?

Very interesting, the curve in the middle of the board looks a bit harsh, any way of mellowing that out a bit to mimic the vanguard slightly more?  Also how flexible is it, would it need a split enclosure?

MEvening Charlie, I was wondering if you are still making these and if you have any longboard or penny board shapes lying around? If not would you be keen to create some blank ones for me? Hope all is well. 
Kind regards,
Jake
