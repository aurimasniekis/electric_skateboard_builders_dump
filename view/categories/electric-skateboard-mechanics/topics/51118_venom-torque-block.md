I saw someone on facebook selling these, there aimed at DH riders But this looks perfect for esk8 because of all the kickback you get when you hit the gas (not that I would know),
 what do you think about it cool interesting Or just snake oil.

It's why I love the back drop on my Evo...

If you have room on top, why not..

I wouldn't use it on a DH deck, as my stance is completely different, I never used to drop on my Evo when I rode it analog. But man its great for esk8

Seems like snake oil to me with regard to the original product use case not like the board is dragging you down a hill more the other way around in the regular case.  For esk8 seems interesting but not sure about the comfort also personally use a kicktail (though not super often) think it might be annoying stepping down off of that.

Either that or two way foot stops like I had on the Vanguard... Front and rear, wedge your feet outward against them..

Outward Sounds very strange.
and I mean people wear shoes with heels so maybe its not that bad.
I mean does It look like his back foot is more uncomfortable?

Is that originally for freeride?
Making easer slides etc.

that looks like it can also help with the Kickback and the brake.

I don't know dude because there is a limit to how much amps you can push through The vesc wires etc.
Maybe 0-7 mph close but passed that the voltage will take over.

10s10p

20a cont * 10 = 200a.

FOCbox and the like can only handle 50 battery amps...so would be good for a 4wd setup..

But 10s10p would be
 Ah & Wh
3Ah * 10 = 30Ah * 36v = 1080Wh

And
Maximum theoretical draw
42v *200a = 8400W

6'2"

I've managed to pull 5300w on the motors.  Scary acceleration without stops.   It's basically the limit of my 12s6p.   I've pulled up to 116a on the battery but that's just during hard acceleration going uphill.  It would just taper off as speed nears the top for gearing.

I can't imagine some of the quad build setups.
