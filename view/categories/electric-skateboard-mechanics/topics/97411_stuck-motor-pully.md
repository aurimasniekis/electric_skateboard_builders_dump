Hi I have a regular motor pully that is secured to my motor shaft using the two thread screws that are screwed thru the pully. I took them out to adjust the motor distance, and the pully will not slide off the shaft. I tried heating the pully and pulling it off w leverage, but it is not budging. Anyone know what the deal is w this? I am lost

probably a bit of lock-tight or super glue. use a bit of acetone, making sure none drips into the motor housing. I reccomend a q-tip to apply it -- after about 5 minutes of letting the acetone do it's work, a ***tap*** with a hammer should knock it loose easily
