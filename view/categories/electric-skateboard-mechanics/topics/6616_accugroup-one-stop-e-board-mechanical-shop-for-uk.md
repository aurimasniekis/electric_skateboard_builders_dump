Found an awesome site that sells mechanical parts. They seem to have pretty much everything we use, belts, pulleys, screws, everything. Just explore, it's an awesome site

one way bearings --> no brake anymore. This only works because of the belt drive on the front wheel which can then brake the board.

Lol me too. I would think that the motor just has a very long shaft through it but at the end of the vid he spins each wheel individually. Hurts my head XD!

I have severe OCD and i wouldn't be able to ride it knowing underneath i have a motor on the rear driving 2 wheels and 1 in front only on one wheel to use it as a brake, who needs brakes

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe @LEVer's Evo board has dual hub motors in the front, so the braking would be even.

Stop hijacking the thread. If you wanna discuss dual drive make another thread.

You are totally right. My apologies for being part of the hijack. 

Nice collection of belts AccuGroup has! I'm thinking of buying a whole set of different sizes to fit any potential new build I might make in the future :)
