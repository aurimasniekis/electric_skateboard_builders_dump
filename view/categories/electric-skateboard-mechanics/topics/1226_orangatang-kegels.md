If you're thinking of the Enertion pulley, then no, they won't fit.
They're made for ABEC Flywheel type wheels.

 has pulleys that fit the kegels.
And http://aliendrivesystems.com/ has a version as well.

Yes, i'd say they are.
Don't have any firsthand experience with them, but i havn't seen many if any negative comments.

bruno from alienpowersystems is selling them now: http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/orangatang-kegel-and-similar-hub-adaptor/

you combine the hub then with a pulley of your choice - 32 or 36T, 9 or 15mm. sadly lots of stuff out of stock right now. http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/htd-5-hub-drive-pulley/

You could try this one, but it's 3d printed and don't come with screws.
