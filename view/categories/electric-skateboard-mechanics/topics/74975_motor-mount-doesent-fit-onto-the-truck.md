Heyho ppl, i have a problem, my motormount cracked and fall apart so i got a new one. Problem is that it does not really fit. Now the big question is if i should make the truck fit by cutting/sawing it smaller.![IMG_20181117_104752|666x500](upload://3vxF1cBoU1yMd5SEXZqOexML7Ki.jpeg) ![IMG_20181117_104646|666x500](upload://trNSS7FnHNLikbzzR0gFYJp2HBc.jpeg)

You sure you mount correct motor mount for the right truck. That motor mount looks like a caliber motor mount. This mount clearly won't fit for trampa / mbs trucks.

thing is that i got it from the same person from wich i got the truck, he said that it will fit, maybe he got wrong order to wrong person.

Its not even for Caliber trucks. Caliber mounts are d shaped, not squared. 

I second, where'd you get that mount?

put a quarter in the way and screw your screw into it and lessen the tension and put it where u wanna put it and then let it go and never move it again.

Puh took some time to do it, but it turned out pretty good, just have to put the belts back on.
The thing with the coin helped out a lil, it wont move anymore, but the most i had to sand down.
Btw how tight do u put your belts on ?
