No, but @marcmt88 and @okp both make perfect-fit mounts for those trucks.  I do like the @dickyho metal pullies best though I haven't tried @Kug3lis metal pullies yet

Has anyone made carbon fiber versions of these? Would they do the job?

Evolve trucks are tapered so should think not.  At the price point though they are tempting.  You could try some gullwing dkp trucks as they have a paris profile.  They'll probably work.  Try it for science
