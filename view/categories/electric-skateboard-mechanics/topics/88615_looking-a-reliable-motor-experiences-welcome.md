So, none of the motors in the market have lasted me a long time without manitenance. Some got the magnets loose, retainer rings falling off, axle vs can striping, worn bearings in a short time, hall sensors gone bad.

I wonder if there is a consensus on a specific motor brand that could withstand the abuse of an electric skateboard.

The only brand I haven't test is Tacon and Turnigy

I can tell you the Turnigy SK8 is hot trash. They're weak, oversized, and held on by 3 stainless bolts that can easily shear. I've been using torque boards 6355's for a while now and I love their power and haven't had to do any maintenance on them since I got them. However I've also heard some less than favorable reviews of their motors, and I think it's just a lottery of whether you get a nice set or not.

Im guessing you are not talking about hub motors but hummie hubs feel indestructible and ride amazing. Have not had a problem yet other then them being heavy but I dont really mind.

From what @DerelictRobot was saying after looking inside some newer maytechs (ones i just got from @hyperIon1) , they seem to be coming pre battle hardened now. 
I'd love to see the difference between older stock maytechs and newer production ones.

From my last experience (still ongoing), I like the closed maytech one.

I buy the customized (not only the logo ;P ) Overion 130kV, before summer 2017 (for my e-MTB, and I ride them hard, everywhere every time raining/snowing, mud-land etc. from less than -0°C to +40°C at 70A Batt and Motor max).

And I still run them today on my last little AT board with GD. Still so powerful! For standing startup they're awesome, I never touch them or make any maintenance (the only issue was with the sensor extension where one pin was left :slight_smile: ).

For now, if I have to buy a new motor, it will be the new v2 or still a Maytech I guess.

Or the new 6880. Like (except the customizing) they're the same inside as the enclosed 6374 but with the outer big bearing that seals the can. But they're longer and heavier just for the bearing ... 

One motor who handle really great, run quieter, and torquy to is the Dyamond 200kV 6374.

I’ve had good fortune with turnigy motors (sk8) on my Kaly gear drive. No complaints at all.


Dark matter motors were rebranded FreeRCHobby motors. They are known to cut corners. There are builders on here that use them for their customers, but they have to take the time to ensure that everything is secured as they should be. Which obviously sucks

Maytech has shown interest in what We as the DIY ESK8 community want in a motor, now I know everyone has personal opinions and preferences. One has to keep in mind that it must be versatile across several industries and applications. I see a demand for a Battle hardened motor specifically for Hard riders street or all terrain. Size, the 63mm (68mm) motors are the most popular, winding size has landed around 190kv-200kv from only what's being made, some have played with the KV for custom runs or their rebrands. We have been talking with them on what can be improved and they have been watching what we do (battle hardening of motors) and what we put them through. 
over the years we have used may brushless motors from the time it killed nitro motors back in the day, you old fucks will know what im saying...... GD carburetors :hot_face:

yes, it shows my age......

@Eboosted our latest motors we’ve added additional retainer clips and longer retainer rings. We’ve also epoxied all motor cans so magnets can’t move or shift. They aren’t in stock yet though. Maybe 1-1.5 weeks.

It should increase durability and reliability a lot.

Exactly what I was meaning with the customized thing. :blush: I go for the Overion because he makes made year ago the kind of improvement we start to see now.  
From outside two motors can look the same, and almost at the same price, but inside, it's another story!

Last year Maytech come to Paris too, since we see some improvement asking, but they still don't want to make some other things asking ... really weird, as it reduces their sell but ... but maybe they want to could be able to count on after-sales service ^^

I'll thrown out my experience my tacon 160 lasted a year of hard riding and had no problems until one day the esc started getting over current faults and I had a burnt out winding. Got an sk8 and promptly broke it. Got a new sk8 for free through the hobbyking warranty. I now have problems with the esc overheating that I never did with the tacon so I think it's the sk8 but it's been nothing but problems for me. I've also got 2 torqueboards 6355 motors that I've been running for over a year each (their both on different single drive boards) they don't need get daily riding but so far those have lasted the best for me.

I have found racestar 5065 to be really tough considering I have run them under water and regularly in heavy rain commuting for a year and half. Bearings still not rough yet which I don't get how that is possible? They are also like the cheapest motor on the market.  

I did put epoxy on the sensor board and a little on the windings before use though. 

5065 is a bit small by today's standards, unless your a lightweight or a short deck could be good. 

Still going! Hoping they can last one more wet season before I upgrade to 63xx size, but not sure which motor yet.

Surprised to hear you say that be honest.  I had one bad one where the rear bearing disintegrated and destroyed the sensor pcb but hk replaced it and upgraded the bearings in the newer versions. @Eboosted  No problems with the 4 I run now.  Good very powerful sensored motors.  Are a bit large but still fit on a 218 hanger.  Nothing beats the sk3 for reliability atm in my opinion.  You just have to like sensorless.  Things are pretty much bullet proof.

I had this problem with a couple of my Maytech motors. The good thing is that it is not that hard to fix.

I drilled out the screws, opened a new hole and tapped it and then used locktite 648 on the axle as an additional safety measure. I don't think it is coming loose ever again :wink:

no more adapters is nice @hyperIon1, but if the sensor wire is the same length than the phase wires it´s still not that good.
the sensor wires need to be longer as min 100-150mm or you need to cut down the phase wires from your esc. ;)

Alright @egaleeyeandy,  Im not sure but it seams to be a discrepancy on just about all the descriptors for size. If you put a meter on the real thing.......
Its a good question I will bring up to the rep. But really 6mm isn't a big deal unless it is to some. I think what it can deliver in power and performance will overshadow 6mm short.

for me that wouldn´t matter as my trucks wide enough, but others might have an issue with 85mm length, so 74mm would be definitly better ;)

Edit: @hyperIon1 when it´s a thing than please also add the hole pattern to the description. 80mm motors are sometimes different (as min it is that case with the leopard and APS motors).
Good to know which motor mounts or aadapter people would need to fit those motors.

Well, I appreciate your input @moon and would like to add that most motors are produced in part or whole in the same factory or cluster of factories over there. I Understand most have had different experiences with motors produced over the years. Keeping in mind that during that time of (repurposing) components for esk8 purposes didn't always work.  At the moment they are what we have to work with, (work with) and thats what we are trying to do. Guide in a way

@dareno @neiru37

Glad yours are working out for you, but by design the motors are flawed. Relying on 3 soft, thin screws to hold the motor together is itself a design flaw. That combined with the fact that most other motors in its size class are more powerful is why I think about them the way I do. Full braking force and hard acceleration don't hold a candle to my TB 6355's. Dual 6354 SK8's don't even fit regular caliber II's

no worries i was just interested in the feedback.  Such a forthright condemnation must have had a back story.  Motors are such a debatable topic because so many fail.  I think @hyperIon1 hit the nail on the head with the fact that we are effectively re purposing motors from other disciplines and as such the factories are fighting to cope with the wear and tear we subject these things to.  I actually ran a thread like this last year before my evo build and it was just the same.  So many opinions and very few success stories.   Eventually went for sk3's because of general consensus and couldn't be happier with them be honest.  The over riding opinion was sk3 for unsensored and maytech for sensored.  Still seems to hold true and my own experience with numerous other manufacturers only backs this up.  I have dark matter esque motors in a draw, I have tb motors in a draw. I have racerstar motors in a draw. All with loose magnet issues.  This debate will go on.

Yes a reliable motor please #metoo

I also have/had troubles with almost all motors so far (APS, SK8, Maytech). From the quality and feeling  I would rate the closed Maytech highest but they were not really reliable at least for me.

But to compare the quality, here how the magnets are glued on APS motors (including orange fluid from motor bearings), didn't find a better picture

![131639|690x388](upload://duIztBUKtSbeBz7GpAwuFb0DQaZ.jpeg) 

Here the "battle-hardened" Maytech can.

![20180820_102935|690x388](upload://vwUCy0EnVIPkgTVPLC8oMXTihfd.jpeg) 

After a hard battle :laughing: (no motor would survive that hard battle)

![233218|690x388](upload://6WBncCDBMpK0jALUgH6TrrhH5sX.jpeg) 

I would like to see Maytech improving the wire management which is IMO a big problem. There is only 1 loose shrink tube for all wires, that's it. If you remove it then it looks like this. There is zero protection against cable movement which leads to internal shorts.

![003922|690x388](upload://73fh0dpSSKmfMbZRPnWo1KDfTp5.jpg) 

APS motors have awful stiff plastic wires and are not the best quality but the cable managment is first class! Wire mesh and maybe shrink tube on the phase wires, there is no movement at all. It would be perfect with silicone wires.

Mine don’t have that at all. I was always wondering if you put that mesh by your own 😅
I epoxy the place where my phase wires come out of the motor to don’t give them any changes to move and rub off the isolation.
You can also ask @Superflim about his APS motor he bought used. The phase wires broke in exactly this place.

Necroing this thread.

Can you send pics of where you epoxied your wires? Like, I understand where on the motor... I guess I'm just asking for your technique, also which epoxy you used.

For anybody else reading this:
Is there anything specific I should know that I won't be easily able to find via google for battle hardening some Sealed Maytech 6374 170KV's?

Battle hardening 6374's is seriously extremely fucking hard if you don't have an abundance of disposable syringes for the epoxy.

Like, I'm in too deep to stop now, but it's seriously a task.

Aren't you scared that debris or small rocks fly inside it and destroy the magnets etc? Especially if you ride on through loose rocks or soft ground in the woods for example.

The bearing is making clicking noise, no fix for this yet, making some weird noise when free rolling, but it's still kicking. I already got couple backups in case it fails.

My Trampa 6364 154Kv are solid. My experience with Maytech 6374 base 130Kv motor was bad, one of the bells have a bad aligned magnet, within the first 20 km everything became a mess. So I guess it is about luck sometimes. I am going to try Turnigy SK8 motors, need to be price wise this time, so I will buy 3 of them (just in case). Thats my experience so far...

I've been using Flipsky 6354 190KV motors and have had problems with them. These were meant to be the better batch post October 2018. I bought two.

After about 200 miles one of the motors started loosing power and making a massive screeching noise making it unusable. The lead up to this was a slight knocking noise when going over bumpy ground.

I contacted Flipsky who sent me another free of charge. I got the new one installed  and again noticed a slight knocking noise over bumps. So I took it off to check. The can was a little loose and noticed that the grub screws holding the shaft were loose. Both screws were loose no lock thread of any kind. Very disappointed. I have now tightened them.

Overall I would say Flipsky have good customer service and price BUT the quality control is no good. 2 out of the 3 motors I have had had problems. Other people have had magnet issues. My magnets have not come off. 

To conclude, 1 motor is still going about 300 miles. 2nd motor lasted 200 miles and 3rd motor had a problem after a few miles. I've fixed this problem but I don't believe it will last long.

Personally I will not go for Flipsky motors in the future.

I can just recommend to start battle harden your motors and strengthen the weak parts you experienced on the already broken ones. I think after 13 motors you have now enough experience to tell best what to fix/change to make your motors stronger.

I have @torqueboards 6380s from just before the new battle ready batch, and they were significantly improved from my initial first batch pair. 2500+ miles on them and they're rock solid, so I can imagine the newer ones are going to hold up even better. Well done on that Dexter.

This Flipsky motors that fails after the 1st ride (FS 6380 150kV), it's the 1st time I see motor without retaining ring ... my 1st APS buy in 2013 already got it. And I can see glue/epoxy on them, and not in this last/new Flipsky ... hope there is some under the magnet :crossed_fingers:

@Eboosted 
up to 35 mph (normally 25-30 cruising) with some of the worst urban roads in America!

San Fran as one of the worst is believable.

My motor was not a Maytech. Used a screwdriver to remove the broken magnet and cleaned thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol. Made sure polarity was correct on the replacement magnet. Put some loctite 638 where magnet was going and put magnet in place. Let it cure for a couple of days.
