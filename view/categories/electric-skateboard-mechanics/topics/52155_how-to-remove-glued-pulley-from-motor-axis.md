I want to change from belts to chain - one problem, pulley is glued on motor axis using strong adhesive from esk8.de: 
http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/Ritzel-Klebstoff-648-hochfest-zur-Ritzelbefestigung/p/56452017/category=15842017

Any idea how to remove it in more intelligent way than smashing the pulley with a hammer until adhesive releases it?

I would heat it up a bit and use this tool (pls tell me it english name)![KU221_S_1_web|400x400](upload://89tyXKm1PAFXbhmmCF3D9Pl4bMs.jpg)

Just don't heat it up to much do the magnets gets loose. Maybe use a cold towel wrapped around the motor when heating the shaft/pulley

Iâ€™ve removed my motor pulley a couple of times after fixing it with red loctite (the crazy strong one) and Iâ€™ve found a blowtorch is the only way to get it off.  You can pretty much prise it off with a spanner after that.
