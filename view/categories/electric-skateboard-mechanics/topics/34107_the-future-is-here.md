What in the actual fuck?  I like it but don't know if it will work in an esk8  (those moving plates look fragile)

It won't work too good for esk8 I think, it's made for robotic transmission.

Potentially has torque issues for skating too and I'd imagine it's quite expensive!

Apparently, the Voltige board will use a continuously variable transmission (CVT) unit in their drivetrain which I find pretty cool!
