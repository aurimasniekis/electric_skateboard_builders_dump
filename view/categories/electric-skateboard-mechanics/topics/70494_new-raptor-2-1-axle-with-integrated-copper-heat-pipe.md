Well said... 🤣 

Even if they use a 10mm axle, with so much material removed and an open side I’d bet the integrity would be reduced substantially.... maybe even worse than an 8mm axle.

From the 1000 Raptor 2 made we have had less than 10 reports of snapped axles, most recently these are related to problems with assembly (watch our next china video that's being released soon as it goes into full detail). 

The first axles where 8mm, current version is 10mm, Our new upgraded axles are 15mm diameter. So we expect to see failure rates below 1%

Wow 15mm, that’s a first I think for esk8, I still wouldn’t trust them though.

My raptor 2’s hanger already gets really hot after a ride which means heat is being sucked out of the motor, I doubt this new one will have significant increase in heat sucking performance, maybe a little. But I’m no heat sucking expert, hope u guys have stats to share

Not sure its a good idea tbh.  Its not so much that they will snap its that people will think they will and no amount of reassurance will change that concept.  Need to be fully confident in the mechanics when travelling at 50k's plus.

Agreed. The moment you lose trust in a part of your board, it's exceedingly difficult to regain that trust. Especially if that moment led to injury of some sort. It took me a long time to trust my mini remote, as I had several crashes when using the nunchuck due to cutouts.

Now, if the new axle was a **solid** 15mm heat treated axle, then I don't think there would be any doubt in the strength.

That doesn’t work if the axle breaks and the rider flies into traffic and gets hospitalized. I had my raptor 2 motors lock up twice and I flew into 2 cars. No serious injuries just some road rash. 

But credit where credit’s due the warranty is good, I got 200 aud credits for my troubles and I’ve put that into a 2nd year of warranty.

Good warranty that be honest better than most and I myself have been well looked after by you guys but the point is trying to sell a hollow core axle will be a difficult job even for you my friend.  Hopefully its all good and does the job of heat dissipation prevalent with high powered hubs but until its been tested and tested and tested people will be dubious with good reason.  10 out of a 1000 is too many if it involves a street face incident.

Thanks for your feedback,

We actually have a warning inside the Raptor box saying that you could be seriously injured or killed riding the board. People still ride it though. 

We take safety very seriously and take all precautions to make sure the product is solid.

Tbh I feel like that warning is most often read as 
“Warning the high likelihood of USER error may cause serious injury or whatever.” Not “warning our axles May snap on you for no reason and send you flying to your death.” 
I know it’s likely that these axles will be fine and everyone gives you a hard time, but idk how comfortable I’d be buying a board from a company who responds to safety concerns by saying well we said on the box it’s dangerous. Just my 2¢

Axle in the video is not at all what will be in the final “integrated axle” 

The axle doesnt have a notch in the side and it will be 15mm square. With a (circular) heat pipe less then half the width. The vast majority of axles strength comes from the extremities of the axle. There is not a significant difference (for our purpose) in strength between a solid 15mm and a slightly hallow 15mm axle. 

I predict 0% failure rate. The reason we made this change is to eliminate the axle breakage completely as well as to better the heat transfer from the motor core to the hanger.

What about motor over heating, loose hardware, cogging when warmed up, motors locking up at 30mph, ect...? I'm on my second raptor 2 and still waiting for parts. I ordered in 2016 and still have a broken board since I received it. What's a warranty when you don't have the parts to honor it??? 

I have all the video, telemetry, ect... Since I've run these motors/board if you want me to post it here. It sucks that you still promote when you don't even honor the warranty dude. Or am I wrong? Still waiting and it's been years.

have no doubt about the thicker axle will prevent it from snapping but I'm not sure if adding heat pipe to move heat to the truck would help that much. there's only so much heat you can remove through the truck's fins so I believe the best hope is to make the motor to be more efficient.

that saying, everything said here is speculation so you guys have to prove what you can achieve.

Hi Sean, We addressed many of these minor issues now, thanks for the the feedback.

Actually, I think we solved the stuttering/cogging motor problem, it was related to motor detection & firmware issues, Did you follow the steps we published: https://enertionboards.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000406455-How-to-configure-R2-with-motor-stuttering-problems 

Regarding warranty parts inventory, we allocate a set amount of parts to cover warranty when we do ordering, in the past we didn't leave enough stock for warranty related issues, we have now increased the reserves to prevent delays in the future.

In relation to the problem with firmware, Due to this bug we ended up replacing lots of motors that likely didn't actually have hardware faults, this put huge strain on our inventory reserves.

With the new FOXBOX unity & Combined with New improved motor supplier we are confident that this type of bug won't happen again.

Thanks again for the feedback, we arent perfect yet but always trying to improve.

Here is the evolution of the Raptor 2 Drive axle, 8mm, 10mm, 12mm & Now 15mm 

I think it's important to note, most of the reported axle snapping (approx 1%) occured in the 8mm axles & normally it was due to the improper torque & installation of the axle & the position of the motor not being flush with the hanger.

Awesome stuff, but whenever I see "patented" I start wondering how locked down this market is going to become.

What exact is patented? 

I'll drop this here as a comparison, a post from 2017. The heat pipe idea appears to be new on the market. Using the hangar as a heat sink is not. Edit: same old discussion with the same people. I know a forum member recently milled a design that looks very similar, forgot his name.

That nobody has ever thought of using the hanger to remove heat is ridiculous, to say it nicely.  There is loads of prior art anyway.  The patent nonsense is just fearmongering.  Real innovation happens with new product announcements like this -- not litigation threats.

Literally anyone who has ever had something get too hot had the idea: "Hey, I should remove some heat from it"

A heatpipe uses hollow piping to hold a material often in a vacuum environment that will vaporize when it gets hot and transfer heat as it then rises in the hollow tubing.  There is nowhere for the heat to rise to with this.  The transfer of heat here would more so be as done by a heatsink. In fact if it were hollow and filled with such a material ..it would work better if it were solid since it’s trying to get heat sideways not up.

This logic is a bit  flawed. 
It does use the heat of vaporization as a good way to hold a large amount of heat but does not need to be oriented vertically to work.The tube is only partially filled with a liquid that has a low boiling temperature. The vapor will condense on whatever part of the tube is coolest and the fluid will evaporate on whatever part of the tube is warmest. Convective processes work much faster to transfer heat than conduction, even in the best conductive material cases. For example, your laptop uses heat pipes which have no inclination angle. The heat pipes used do contain such vapor.

Ok so possible to go sideways with convection to some degree.    

Am i wrong in thinking getting much heat out that 1mm spot of copper to the aluminum hanger is unlikely and at best, assuming the design in the video, heat could be further transferred along the axle steel by the copper.  Will the axle really have that window cut in it?  Weird. Seems like less strength and more air filling voids so less heat transfer

No, my understanding is that they won't have that cutout. I think the cutout was needed in the thinner 12mm axle since a thin-wall bore that deep would have been challenging. Not sure, not the one doing the back-and-forth with the factory. 

Steel is about 10-20 W/m K, aluminum is 150-200 W*m/K and copper is 300-350 W/m K. Properly implemented heat pipes can have conduction in the 10k-100k W/m K range.

The contact area between the copper bit and the hanger is maybe a square mm.  If the copper were to transfer the heat further along the axle that seems doable as the heatpipe can somewhat transfer heat laterally but the joint between the copper n aluminum heatsink, judging from the video above, is 1mm diameter

Cool design added strength is a plus. Imo as far as heat transfer the old design worked cause my hanger would get so hot I couldn't touch it with out burning my self. Bigger issue with heat is that the hanger doesn't have enough mass to effectively dissipate the heat from these large motors. In all honestly I never had heat soak issues on mine even in the Miami heat.

Did you guys @onloop  test it? Looking at it it seems like not worth the effort. This heat pipe will help for couple of first minutes and when hanger will get really hot it won't matter. @Battosaii is right. Your hanger don't have the surface to dissipate the heat. I'm sure that those motors are not generating less heat than desktop CPU and look at those cooling systems. Adding this to axle will make it weaker, more expensive and will not work as you hope for it to work (in that form you showed but maybe there's more advanced plan?)

You know what?  I take it all back. My issue was confidence in the thing but that axle is a big bitch and hopefully it does the job.  I for one would love to see the board perform to its potential because its an achievement, it really is. I rode one last year and it shocked me tbh.  To get that much torque and speed from hub motors is fantastic on 10s.  Just what i'm after for an everyday ride. Fingers crossed it all works out mate.  I'll obviously want free shipping on mine though :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

All that matters is how hot the hangar actually is. Heat dissipation is directly proportional to temperature difference. The closer to the internal temperature of the motors that the hangars get, the more heat will be wicked away by wind flowing over the hangar. I can guarantee you right now the hangars are staying much cooler than the windings in the motors just due to thermal resistance etc.

Did you guys do any simulations? It’s not hard to setup a thermal simulation and the results can help a lot to visualize what’s happening

A little off topic here, but after watching this video, https://youtu.be/DlbGoBY4J58

Freaking kudos to @barajabali , @onloop, @adrianenertion. I’ve never seen many companies that have this amount of dedication and grit to get something done.   I may be a hard customer, but you guys have my full support. 

Of course if there’s a problem I’m still gonna hound support about it though... sorry about that :laughing:

> That nobody has ever thought of using the hanger to remove heat is ridiculous, to say it nicely.

...like for example this super cool idea by @Minim to replace the dreadful R2 hanger with a super cool new hanger design to disipate heat.... :point_down:
