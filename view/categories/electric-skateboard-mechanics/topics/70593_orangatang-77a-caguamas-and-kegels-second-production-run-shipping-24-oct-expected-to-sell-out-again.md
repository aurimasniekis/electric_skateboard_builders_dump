Check with your favorite retailer if they're taking pre-orders.

Pricing on the Boosted-compatible, limited edition Caguama is already well-inflated ahead of the holiday season:

Happy building!

WTF why would they overprice them so much? O.O

These wheels are cool, most probably will end being serialized properly at a normal price.

To be clear; we think certain profiteers will purchase pre-orders and then sell those on eBay, in advance of receiving them later this month.

These blue wheels are very magic and precious to Boosted owners.

It takes two 5-gallon buckets of Smurfs to press down into one 85mm wheel.

(yes buy Popocas).

I bought 80a's for $77 months ago.

I'm not sure the 3 durometer is worth $130 haha.

They are amazing, the ride is really quiet, the grip is higher than the orange caguamas and the most imoprtant part is the comfort on bad roads, I feel them softer than Abecs I don't knowe why, maybe it's the board I'm riding. I had no dents or chunks on the Caguamas so far which is a good indicative that they might last more than Abecs.

The only drawback might be the color which is a matter of personal prefference, I'd love orange Caguamas with the same durometer as the blue ones.
