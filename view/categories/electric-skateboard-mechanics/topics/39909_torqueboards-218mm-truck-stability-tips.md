Hey guys, since getting the 218 to fit dual 6374 I've been trying to get the trucks ridable at speed and finally got there, so figured I'd share what I did and maybe others have tips too. 
Frankly speaking all the rubber bits that it comes with are garbage, the bushings, pivot cups.(I wish just the hangar was sold). 
First thing I tried was replacing bushings with stock caliber, that helped but still very unstable at 25-30, next I replaced base plate and pivot cup with stock caliber, that helped further but still wobbly. The magic bullet was all new bushings and pivot cup. Bones cone 96A, Nipples 96A, RipTide 96A. Wobble doesn't exist even if I try and turning wasn't affected at all for me.
 I'm only 165lbs so I was a bit concerned going high duro for everything, but it's the most stable the board has felt since getting the trucks. I feel comfortable now adding the 2nd 6374 and going over 30 üòÅ

Looks good!

Really wish they would just sell the hangar too.

Pivot cups are seriously underrated upgrades.. they make a HUGE difference. Especially if yours are stock and have lots of mileage.

Nipples felt pretty bad to me and are not recommended for calibers in the description. How much lean do you have and how is the carving... @thisguyhere

I'm only using them board side if that makes a diff, sharp turns at 20ish not a problem for me. 

I should also mention I'm using regular length caliber trucks in front

@Titoxd10001 did you try with the torqueboards baseplate or did you swap to caliber baseplate?

put on the blood orange insert barrel 92a + cupped washers last nite. 

night and day difference. 

these trucks finally feel tuned. but still worse ride quality than ronin and surfrodz. 

put the nipples on the normal caliber, for the mono drive and feels ok, kind of falls over tho

Was thisguyheres board. It was standard 218 baseplates. I'm waiting for a set of these for a friend tho and ima tune them. 

Might try waxing the pivots and maybe those blood orange insert bushings. Thinking double barrel in the rear and barrel/cone in the front. Harder duro in the rear.

Nipples felt okay to start but then lock up when you start to lean

AT 210lbs I throw all stock bushing away and swap in hard nipples. 

So I would get the caliber pivot cups if I use the stock TB baseplate right? What‚Äôs the difference between standard and precision?

[/quote]

Cast is not true. Precision is milled and has perfect symmetry. Stronger...  Typically a precision truck has no slop. Ie
- bushing seat is perfectly sized for the bushing lip
- pivot nose is a perfect circle
- kingpin opening is symmetrical for even turning.
All these together can make a truck sloppy or really true...

They make your lean more predictable. The glide inside the stock ones can be kinda jerky at times.
Also they have a dampening effect compared to the stock plastic ones.

I think Mike is asking what is the difference between a standard and precision cups, not the trucks. That is kind of obvious. 

And for the record you always go for the hard nipples!

Not sure where you saw this advertisement but the top one is for the Caliber "Standard" TKP truck and the one below is for Caliber I RKP trucks (I am guessing here).  The TB 218 takes the Caliber II pivots and Caliber precision trucks take a different pivot.  Please send me the link so we can correct them

## \#35 Posted by: thisguyhere Posted at: 2018-05-21T17:11:39.915Z Reads: 286

```
the terminology is board side, road side.

ah... i put the cone bushing road side, barrel bushing board side.  the top end of the cone bushing should always face roadside. this is on my smaller, more nimble mono drive board.

the faster dual drive one i use barrel bushing on both sides, but the soft duro roadside.

hope that made sense.

but like squish said, read the bushing thread, the man that actually makes them has some great info:

I tried these little rings or "keys" as they are called. Made a massive difference to the precision of the handeling. Allowing me to run looser trucks and be more stable at high speed. Win win. Makes sense as there is so much play around the king pin, if you pick your board up by one side of the front truck you can see how much play there is that does not translate to steering, this gets rid of almost all that slop.

![image|690x368](upload://yY9hoRqHu6A8C66cdtlJcjN1AAO.jpg)

And the regular stuff in order of importance. 
- quality bushings
- non symmetrical angles
- don't use soft risers

I did in the bushing setup thread, i got barrels rear and front with cupped washers and they feel so much better than stock bushings.
but the little shaking like movements im talking about idk how to stop them, harder or tight bushings reduce them at expense or not being able to turn at low speeds lol. but do not eliminate them.

Try running the Sharp edge of the bushing towards the hanger both front and rear.  This can eliminate a minute amount of bushing side shift before the bushing engages.

Can you tell me exactly what is in the trucks and if you have them wedged or dewedged from what the Evo makes the trucks?  There should be a fairly big difference in durometer or shape to compensate for the Evo split

1\2 inch risers plus 2 tiny risers more (forgot i had those there bc i was running 83mm wheels= no clearance) and 4 87a barrels from venom. but like i mentioned b4 i was thinking bout getting the magnums and barrels plus the 96a pivot from riptide( pivot is making ugly noises)

i think i could remove the risers entirely now that i have these big tires.

You definitely need to create more of a differential of resistance to compensate for the large split the Evo creates, if you choose to change bushings, keep the same duro as the Venom and use a KranK 87a Canon / Magnum setup, run the Magnums in back and the Canons up front.

hello there, i have done what you suggested and man! what a change lol.
so much better i can still turn while being stable at 30 to 35 mph, roads are very uneven so i kinda need tight rear truck (gave 1 and a half turn after i started to feel resistance on the kp nut for the magnums and 1 turn to the canons). 
120-130 lbs i guess the 87a are considered hard bushings for my weight but i like the feel.

also, would you suggest using the beveled end of the magnums and canons to face the hanger? i currently have the magnums beveled side towards the hanger and the canons with the flat\sharp end towards the hanger. dont really know how that would affect the feel.

BIG THANKS @Alphamail

The Magnum really only fits with the beveled edge towards the bushing seat in the hanger, as for the Canon, either will work, there will be a slight difference in feel depending on the orientation of the bushings in the seat.

96A pivot cup riptide and 3dprinted stability key.

Board is super stable but its quite hard to do nice carving haha.
I guess i went a bit to stiff cuz i was worried about those deadly speed wobbels...

Im 78kg and board is 10kg.

Any suggestions to improve turning but keep stability @Alphamail ? My max speed is around 28mph.
