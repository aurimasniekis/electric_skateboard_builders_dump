my bolts have receded into my board this made a little channel and now only an 1/8" of material is left on the bottom..

I am devastated after noticing this, does this mean it is too late to use washers on top... I'm going to the skate shop tomorrow, I haven't rode the board more than 4 times.. who knows what to do here.. is it the end? the board is composite.. thanks peeps

looking at washers right now for top and bottom going to hit the local skate shop.. my concern is I'm using 1" of risers to get clearance with 83mm wheels...

would this approach be safe?

I found this

I would fill those with expoxy then drill out and use washers like you say

Take the bolts out, clean the surfaces (i'd use rubbing alcohol), then tape over the underside of the holes, mix up epoxy, with the surface to be filled level, pour in the epoxy, wait for it to cure, re-drill...

What brand of board is it? Maybe ask Frank @trampa what he would recommend?

thanks man, can u recommend what to drill with, like just a matching diameter bit right?
i will be able to dissasemble the trucks or is like a one time application kinda deal for each time i take it apart

It should just be a one off fix, although i'd add the washers you were thinking of to spread out the load so it doesn't happen again. Do you think the cause is too much tension when tightening or the lateral loads when your skating. If it is the latter you would have noticed the bolts feeling more loose after use?

when tightening i believe but after i rode i would tighten again and so on and so forth so here we are lol
i got alot of riser action for clearance.. 

does expoxy last long?
what kind of tape should i put on the underside hrmmm..

If you are not confident to do the work, maybe you should do some more research first?
Your deck is likely made from layers of fibers and epoxy resins. So filling a hole with more epoxy is just like patching a hole in a brick wall with mortar...
The tape isn't important, it just acts as a physical barrier. I'd use masking tape. Once the epoxy cures it will be solid, bonded to your deck and you would have to brake it to remove it.

It is hard for me to tell, but you might have the wrong sort of hardware attached to your board?

thats what im feeling.. i needed a specific length, but probably made the wrong choice. i hope mixing a small batch of resin will be easy, what brand is legit. also masking tape is easy to remove so thats good news...

If your going to fill with epoxy get the jb weld with steel reinforcing, takes forever to set but the best for this senarario, make Shute the hole is made before it is fully set, about 4 hours after allied drill hole, washers would also be good to get, what is the sandwich material in between the carbon?

If you're shy to use epoxy and drill I wouldn't bother with fixing the deck, just switch to trusshead bolts.

I used it with my carbon deck but for glueing a price of plexiglass in it., the bolts would be a good idea too but would need longer for 1in risers he says he uses

The washers they use on snowboard bindings would be perfect for this.

I've done this too by overtightening on a wood deck.  I'd fill with any epoxy (jb weld, or other twin syringe types at hardware store) -  just make sure it's intended for fiberglass or carbon fiber.

If you use packing tape (after cleaning as suggested) - epoxy shouldn't stick to the clear packing tape like it will with masking and others.  

here's some on Amazon that says fiberglass and should work:
https://www.amazon.com/Loctite-Epoxy-0-85-Fluid-Syringe-1395391/dp/B000PSAKAW

After you drill (just use a bit that's the same size - unsure which off the top of my head) - i'd add washers and the truss head bolts @treenutter suggested.  That should make it last a long time and be even stronger.  Definitely less likely to pull through like this.

GL!

the tape yielded to the epoxy so there is glue that lumped underneath the tape and spread, i imagine i can scape this with an exacto blade..

only one of the holes came out clean ::sigh::: @sl33py does this backside look ok dude.. =| 
 i am also concerned with air pockets but i did what i could to get as much as possible in the cavities also that curing time is no $%^$% joke.. had to use 2 syringes

the choice is conical, or flat...the flat ones i have slightly oversized washers for them...

this is a tough choice.. arent i just relying on friction if i am not countersunk.. the washers for those conical ones are too big and not practical. people at the hardware store swear up and down that conical will just keep sinking into material and this will just happen again... =|

Those will work.  The truss head / flat ones w washers.  Don't use the countersunk ones or they will slowly pull through like the previous ones (conical).

I wouldn't worry about a bubble or two - this will have a distributed load and is simply "squeezing" the whole composite board now instead of pulling through.

fantastic! so i guess the hardest part now will be drilling the pilot hole back in.. any tips for success? XD should i start then put the bolt in, or do i need to drill all the way through

I'd drill all the way through - you don't want to pressure/split the epoxy you poured.  Or the CF around it... that would suck.

Do you have a drill press - best way for perfect straight.  If not, i'd bolt the truck on the top and use the truck base as a guide.  Go slow and you should be fine.

Start off by marking where you want your drill centre to be, I would not use a centre punch. Then use a 2mm bit starting off then the right size after. It may be easier to use the trucks as an alignment template

i cant use this one right? i imagine its too large, its the diameter of the screw however

Who manufactured the deck?  They definitely cut some corners. You are supposed to cut out a rectangle in the foamcore and reinforce it with a wooden insert at the bolt holes. Then layup the composite around the core. 

 In fact drilling through the composite breaks the fiber and compromises strength. Now all the strength in that area is only from the matrix, not the constituent.  Ideally the fabric should be stretched around the threaded insert during layup, so as not to break of the fibers. However this technique is generally ignored with skateboards...

You should never use countersunk bolts on foamcore composites.  Use a buttonhead with a washer, and don't over-tighten it

1" riser is going to demand higher clamping force to provide stability. IF you keep having problems with bolt slippage you might want to consider Nord-lock wedge locking washers in addition to the standard nyloc nuts....Geometry not friction..Good stuff...

Thanks for the vid! 
I tested a bunch of different locking washers, basically all of them (conical, curved, wave, split, toothed, jagged, ...), nothing really worked that well.
Got bunch of Nord-Lock ones earlier today, we'll see. Not cheap however :money_mouth:

I think this would work, not that cheap for a set of bolts but on the plus side you dont need a screw driver to install. $20
