I'm confused with the 'new' Evolve's GTX super carve 12 inches truck. Seemed they advertised them as better carving and wider than earlier iterations. Are they really new and wider? Or they are just the same trucks we've seen in earlier models?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/0/8049d93ece6dddaa7cbfd7a0f5c8254b7a5e64e9.jpg" width="690" height="459">

From the image, they look the exact same as their old trucks. The logo is the same too.

Seem like is the same truck across all the Evolve product line. Still, when you see them out there they look different size on different boards. A sight trick?

They are the same on all GT models, and wider than Evolves last generation Street trucks, ie their Gen 2.

Is all confusing when they start to talk about Evolve 'Generations' if you are not familiar with all their boards. You need to know all their product line since the beginning.

Gen 2 came before the GTs. They are the bamboo street and the Carbon street models. They also come with AT option but they used completely different (much wider) trucks.
