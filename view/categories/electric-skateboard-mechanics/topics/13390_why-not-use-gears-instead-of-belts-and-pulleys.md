So for the most part, I have only seen belts and inwheel motors. Why doesn't anyone use gears instead? Wouldn't this decrease slippage that a belt normally experiences?

There are a bunch of people that use chain drive setups, but a properly setup belt drive system won't slip anyway. Idlers and/or bigger pulleys help with this.

I don't use chain mainly due to the availability of pulleys and the low cost of belts. I prefer it anyway since they're a quieter solution.

"That a belt normally experiences" true, slippage can occur, but it normally doesn't just slip/skip unless there is something wrong. The same thing can happen with a direct gear set up if something is wrong, it can skip as well.

There are a few boards in prototype with direct gear set ups:

I plan to use chain. I'm machining my own sprockets for fun and to save a few bucks. Chains are super inexpensive (I got 3 feet for $10 shipped) so don't let cost sway you one way or the other. Belts are definitely going to be the quieter and sleeker option. Direct drive is super cool but I hope you know you would likely never see a 1 to 1 setup like you picture posted above on an electric longboard.

Any type of transmission system you choose will have design constraints & they always introduce losses from friction & require maintenance.

We have spent the last 12 months+ researching this topic and there is only one viable answer. Direct Drive.

It's all about what you are willing to give up. While direct drive has no losses in the mechanical system. You are increasing losses in the electrical system.

A gear, or any type of reduction system will produce less heat than the equivalent direct drive system. This also means more current and battery wasted. 

So sure if your goal is to produce a mechanical system with the least amount of friction, direct drive will be your bet. But that doesn't mean it is the most efficient, powerful, easily serviceable. Etc. 

Direct drive could win for top speed, if in numbers. But anything shy of an AWD and I doubt a hub or direct drive could keep up with a reduction drive.

Anyway you are gonna have lots of different thoughts on this here... But the answer really comes down to "what do you want from your board?"

The watt hour per mile values are insane. Almost 30% less than belt drive. It's louder, but that doesn't bother me. 

I would encourage you to use keys, the increase in torque, at least on my build, is more than grub screws and loktite can handle. I'm getting new motor spur gears and and gonna cut key slots in them.

Yea in any gearbox you want to put a key on your motor, and dont use circular shafts but instead opt for hex shafts. That doesn't matter for belt drive systems though because the first thing to fail there will always be the belt

Direct drives are not gear drives. I know a few are named like that. But direct drive is 1:1 no reduction with the motor directly driving the wheel(is Carvons, flies direct drive, torqueboards soon to be DD)

You are right, my bad lmao all these terms are getting hard to remember. Frankly I think that Direct Drive systems are unnecessary and force you to get a bigger and more inconvenient motor, I'm personally going to try a gear down so that I won't have to worry about skipping belts and destroying the belts teeth, and the noisy and tedious to tension chains. I dont see any benefit to not gearing down a motor, no matter how you are delivering power to the wheels.

That's not true. Unloaded it can be true. But add load and your watthour/mile will be drastically different with different reductions.

```
if a controller has no erpm limit, then for a given stator & copper volume, the higher kv motor can produce more mechanical power for the same losses, making it more efficient.

by adjusting the gear reduction ratio, you can select the ground speed at which the motor produces peak mechanical power, and generally increasing the gear reduction ratio improves efficiency.

the high rpms at which a high kv motor outputs its peak power might not be suitable for a direct drive / hub motor without some gear reduction.

By efficiency I mean the literal efficiency of the system, you are not loosing any additional energy to friction (excluding extreme cases where you change the weight of a gear dramatically in which case it will become less efficient). The point is if the rotating mass in a 1:1 ratio system is 1lb and the same is true for a 2:1 system there will be no efficiency difference. In terms of watthour/mile then you can only really come up with an estimate you are happy with unless you want to put a transmission on your esk8, a higher reduction has a much higher efficiency than a lower reduction at low rpms, however the lower reduction will be more efficient at higher rpms

^take a look at the green line, top left chart (electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency %), the only thing changing between steps is the gear ratio.

notice the lower the gear reduction, the lower the conversion efficiency for a given speed.

Shartsis, let's say we have identical size stator, and copper volume motor and same kv, let's say 100kv. One in a direct drive and another in a reduction setup.  The DD will have a better electrical to mechanical energy conversion than a reduction setup because there is no transmission and losses due to that transmission.

Well thats only if the wheel is mounted directly onto the motor, if you have a 1:1 ratio using gears you will be loosing the same amount of energy as  you would with a reduction. Also the losses are negligible because the point is to increase the torque of the motor.

All this calculated nonsense does nothing for the real world. Not every road is flat. Your not always going to be going the same speed for x distance. Not every street is long enough to get up to or continue that efficiency speed.

You can calculate all day long. But if you have two boards exactly the same, with different reductions. The higher reduction is going to have better efficiency all around. Because it's more then just X speed. It's the stop and go. 

So theorize all you want. Tell me when you have some milage under your belt and have tested real world range with the same board  and different reductions on the same setup.

@Deckoz Yes, in the real world you will additionally have to contend with iron losses, esc losses, battery losses, drivetrain losses, rolling resistance, grades, all of which will reduce top speed, thrust & efficiency compared to what the chart shows because it doesn’t factor these losses - that said it does give comparisons which are ballpark-accurate and mostly in agreement with other motor simulators and esk8 calculators because the losses which it does factor (wind drag and copper loss) are generally the largest in magnitude.

Just for the record. My comment was towards @EverBlade21 

@professor_shartsis I think for once you and I are arguing the same point with different words. As esk8 isn't a static simulation.

We can calculate this all day long. But in the end, the only numbers I'm going to believe are your watthour/mile. Go test different reductions for yourself on the same board @EverBlade21. Get 4 or 5 charges in so you can get an average wh/mi on that reduction. Then repeat with a different reduction. Your numbers are going to be vastly different. No matter how you calculate it on paper.

What/Which/Whose wh/mi statistic do you believe?
You can drive easy or hardcore. The wh/mi will differ a lot.

You cannot really compare the same Setup only one Motor has a 1:1 and the other a 2:1 reduction. They are set up for a completly different Speed!
the 1:1 Motor Needs, lets say, 30A at 30mph but the 2:1 Motor never gets to this Speed. How can we compare it? ....

we should rather compare 200kv Motor 2:1 vs 100kv Motor 1:1 (or Wheel Diameter...)

Pretty simply. You aren't always going 30mph. Riding is alot of stop and go. The question is which one has an more efficient pattern of getting up to speed with less current from a stand still repeatedly? 

Calculating for static speed doesn't mean anything.

If you took other threads that take averages based on paper calculations my Evo would only get about 30 miles of range. Yet I get 40-44miles. Because calculating for static speed doesn't give you real world stop and go. The most amount of energy is wasted when accelerating your mass. 

So instead of looking at a static speed calculation. Take all the static speeds out. Make a graph with ten to twenty repetition of 0-15mph or whatever end speed you want. And add up the energy used from those numerous stopped to speed ramps. Then do the same with a different reduction. That will give you a closer to real world example then calculating a static speed usage.

While I agree.. in order to compare something you need the same rider so accelerations style and weight stays constant. I'll do a couple logs once I get my mini drive from kugils. As I'll have 2.4:1 and 2.8:1 Spurs. My Evo is currently on 2.4:1 belt driven and I average 9-11wh/mi. I'm of no doubt I could likely hit 50+ miles on 2.8:1 because of the decreased load/increased leverage.

I don't even know why this an argument. Anyone with 1/2 a brain would know Deckoz is absolutely right. Cars get better gas mileage on the freeway than in the city because on the freeway, you're going static speed, whereas in the city, its stop and go. And its the stop and go that eats up fuel/current. 

Imagine now if you could only choose a single gear ratio and you choose gearing for freeway speeds at 65+ mph, but you only drove in the city. An ICE simply would barely move the car whereas an electric motor would pull ridiculous amounts of current at every stop and go. An electric motor is different than an ICE, but the principles of physics are the same - whether you're burning gas or pulling amps, you eat up more during acceleration than you do maintaining speed.

My guys I already said this, the whole point of what I said was that when you are gearing an electric motor you are just gearing for the speed you will be traveling most often.
@Deckoz Dont misunderstand what I am saying, EFFICIENCY OF A GEAR SYSTEM will not change from a reduction. That is what I was saying. I do not know how many times I can explain this. The efficiency of a drive train or gearbox is defined as how much energy you are loosing to friction as heat. That means that an engine making 100 hp directly (Crank HP) but makes only 90bhp (Brake Horsepower or the hp at the wheels). That system has a EFFICIENCY OF 90%. Don't argue about something that no one is trying to disprove.

[quote="EverBlade21, post:21, topic:13390"]

[/quote]
This is such a naive comment because that just explains why your point is invalid. A car on a freeway, static speed, static gearing, It DOES NOT have to change gears while going a constant speed. However it DOES NOT matter because it is within its efficiency range for that gear. In a city stop and go traffic causes the car to change speeds a lot and hence shift gears to maintain RPM. An esk8 CANNOT shift gears, so that means it has one efficiency range at a certain rpm. An esk8 has only one possible gear ratio, so it is only efficient in at one range of rpms. 

[quote="EverBlade21, post:21, topic:13390"]
a higher reduction has a much higher efficiency than a lower reduction at low rpms, however the lower reduction will be more efficient at higher rpms
[/quote]

Like I already said, choose your gearing based on your average speed, that is what will give you most efficiency.

Again, if you took one look at the graphs you will see exactly what I' saying. By changing the gearing you are STILL making the same Mechanical Watts (Which means the efficiency IS NOT CHANGING) and at the SAME motor rpm, ALL that changes is what speed that peak wattage is at, that peak wattahe is where you are most efficient

Don’t argue about something that no one is trying to disprove.

The point I was making was
No gears, no pulleys. Aka direct drive
![DJz2NmTWAAYdq5h (1)|666x500](upload://q4ag8kJiFwDimgB0vMrk6EGQMPA.jpg)

Vs any type of gearing system.

The first one just has magnet and bearing friction....

While geared or pulley have more parts in the drive train...so more places for losses..

Well thats only if the wheel is mounted directly onto the motor,

As i said in reply to 

[quote="Naysh, post:26, topic:13390, full:true"]
Shartsis, let’s say we have identical size stator, and copper volume motor and same kv, let’s say 100kv. One in a direct drive and another in a reduction setup.  The DD will have a better electrical to mechanical energy conversion than a reduction setup because there is no transmission and losses due to that transmission.

That’s what these are… Gearbox drives…

And that last quote is just to show how you pulled an Italy in the middle of this topic

No you just missed this

[quote="Deckoz, post:11, topic:13390"]
Direct drives are not gear drives. I know a few are named like that. But direct drive is 1:1 no reduction with the motor directly driving the wheel(is Carvons, flies direct drive, torqueboards soon to be DD)

So where is the Italy?

This is such a naive comment because that just explains why your point is invalid. A car on a freeway, static speed, static gearing, It DOES NOT have to change gears while going a constant speed. However it DOES NOT matter because it is within its efficiency range for that gear. In a city stop and go traffic causes the car to change speeds a lot and hence shift gears to maintain RPM. An esk8 CANNOT shift gears, so that means it has one efficiency range at a certain rpm. An esk8 has only one possible gear ratio, so it is only efficient in at one range of rpms.

Sigh. Let me simplify and remove gears and friction out of the equation so you can understand. Lets say you have a rocket in space with mass, M. You want to accelerate it with a rate, A. How much force do you need to apply to accelerate mass M at rate A? If you can answer that, then answer the following:

You take that same rocket in space of mass M. How much force do you need to apply to maintain it at a constant velocity, V?

Gears are merely rotational mechanical advantage to multiply (or divide) the torque (aka force distance) of a motor, but make no mistake force is required to accelerate, not to maintain velocity (in the simplified scenario). Of course on ground, there is an opposing force in the form of rolling and air resistance, but at freeway speeds they're still not as great as the force required to accelerate the mass of a car. And at eskate speeds, rolling and air resistance are even lower.

Again, if you took one look at the graphs you will see exactly what I’ saying. By changing the gearing you are STILL making the same Mechanical Watts (Which means the **efficiency IS NOT CHANGING**) and at the SAME motor rpm, ALL that changes is what speed that peak wattage is at, that peak wattahe is where you are most efficient

@EverBlade21 I’ve set up a comparison to see how many motor amps are required to maintain 20mph with 2:1 gear reduction vs 1:1 gear reduction...

(50v battery, (2) 100kv motors, 0.1ohm, 100mm tire)

https://image.ibb.co/dkqVJ8/F6016_EEB_C23_E_421_C_85_C8_087_D7_E28_E6_F2.gif

^according to the wind drag calculations ~224w mechanical is required to maintain 20mph....

2:1 (reduction) requires 4.52a total battery amps (226.18w electrical) & 3.28a motor amps per motor to maintain 224w mechanical @ 20mph generating 1.07w ohmic heating per motor

1:1 (hub) requires 4.65a total battery amps (232.63w electrical) & 6.56a motor amps per motor to maintain 224w mechanical @ 20mph generating 4.3w ohmic heating per motor

the 226.18w electrical at 20mph constant with 2:1 works out to ~11.309 watt hours per mile.

by contrast 232.63w electrical at 20mph constant with 1:1 works out to lower efficiency— about ~11.631 watt hours per mile.

it would appear that at the same constant 20mph speed, the 1:1 requires more watt hours per mile (is less efficient) than 2:1.
