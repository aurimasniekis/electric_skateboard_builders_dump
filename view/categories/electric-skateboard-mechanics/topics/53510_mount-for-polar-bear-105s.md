Is there an available motor mount for polar bear 105s (landyachtz dinghy) and gears for the 63mm wheels?

You dont want to use 63mm wheels :) buy kegels or flywheels :) 

I havent seen mount for these round trucks anywhere :/ To make it work you would have to moify your hangers....also the length of your hanger is really short...It is doable, but it will take a lot of work :/

I was using those bigfoot wheels think they are 70mm. If u can center the pulley right they felt good in my neighborhood. Not good for the rocky bike lanes here though
