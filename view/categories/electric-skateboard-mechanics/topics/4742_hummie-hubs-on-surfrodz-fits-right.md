I got some wicked cheap surfrodz on eBay and they happen to match Hummie's hubs. I've read the bits about which locking material to use to secure them.  Any known issues with this set up?

Is that the Bustin Spliff?  I am doing the same setup with Hummie's wheels!

The Bustin deck is stiff, but not lifeless like carbon decks and and down hill boards. Pretty light too.
