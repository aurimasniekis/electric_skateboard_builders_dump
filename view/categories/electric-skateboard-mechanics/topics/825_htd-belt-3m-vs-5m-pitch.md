I'm designing a new motor mount for my board, looking to add another motor for better traction going up hills, I wanted to use 15mm belts but theres not enough room so i think I'm going to have to use 9mm.

I know 5m HTD belts are the norm but boosted use 3m 15mm belts and would using 3m pitch belts offer any improvement or not?

Cheers!

I like 5mm personally. I think the groove is much deeper and helps with transmitting torque.
