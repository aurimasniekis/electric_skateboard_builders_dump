As an upgrade I decided to change my board to chain drive (personal reasons, don't get along with belts). Had a cheap eBay chain kit and only now realised that it doesn't really work with 97mm flywheels - width of big sprocket is too small and it kind of 'sinks' in the wheel not leaving space to put chain on + holes didn't have thread for bolts and it being made of standard indestroyable Chinese steel i broke 2 thread maker thingies.

Is there some kit or at least big sprocket I can buy that works with 97mm wheels (original flywheels) without heavy modifications on it?

I will try to remember, but so far can't really find anything, probably will try to find somebody with CNC machine to make a custom one.

this does not work with 97mm wheels as the pulley... is wider than the wheel eheh :slight_smile:

I don't know if there is an interest to make sprockets for street wheels; let me know I look at make small batch !

Would be interested as well, since making custom one through a company would be pain and more expensive

I sent you some info in private message about some minor details. Although I'm not sure what you mean by ISO4b and 6B, all i can find on google are electric relays with these keywords.

Put some bolts through with 'sleeves' over the bolts between the sprocket and the inside of the hub at the length that you want it to stick out from the hub... Like spacers...

I did this too but I used some 45mm od washers, then drilled the same hole pattern.

I wanted to do this with my Chinese pulley, but holes weren't threaded and m4 while I only had m5 screws which are long enough, tried make threads, broke the thread making drill and it got stuck inside.

This made me consider to look for pulley prepared to be used with 97mm wheels

Yes it’s out by a few mm, I drilled the holes out a 7mm and then the m4 bolts went right through correctly
