I owe this community everything! I'll always give back when I can.

I am now offering the carbon fiber & aluminum Enertion Motor Mount Drawings & 3D files for free download. Enjoy.

Maybe now you can afford to put your money towards some quality electronics :)

So your really moving away from belt and pulleys to hubs... Glad to see. I know you'll love getting rid of the alignment issues, belts breaking, ect that can happen with a satellite config. Hubs are the future, and I'm gald to see your moving toward them!

I've never had an issue with my Enertion mount and drive train kit. It is amazing. The only thing that hasn't broke actually.

Could you tell us what the bolts are? I know you use elevator nuts for securing the motor plate to the clamp and socket caps but I am not on length etc.

I made an OnShape file for people without desktop CAD. OnShape is free online CAD. You can export and modify the design on OnShape if you want. The hardware specs are in the document description.

Alright guys. This whole thing is new to me still. I've been reading a ton and am trying to learn. So say if I wanted to make this motor mount, how would I go about it. I downloads the files, then what? Can I bring them in somewhere to have them make it? What kind of shop? What kind of material do I have them make it in if I want it exactly as enertion makes it? I figured I would ask you guys the steps I need to take because you guys know. You know how I know that you guys know? Because every time I've asked a question in this forum I get an answer. I love this shit. Thanks!

i bet a machine shop  will charge way more than the cost of buying them already made from enertion.  unless you have a friend with the tools or know how to do it yourself at techshop it doesn't seem worth it.

Gotta get it priced out...better if you get your friends to get in on it.

And yes they need the files

Thanks for the info @onloop. I'm just going to buy some from you then. Just waiting to see if my spare raptor battery, charger, ect... is coming anytime soon before I order anything else from you guys. For some reason your shipping guys have a $500 order of mine from a month ago screwed up and keep giving me a tracking number for my raptor complete that's already been delivered. There's something about having that much money floating around that is kinda discerning to me. i have another $700 order in the shopping cart ready to go once I get my previous order figured out.

No worries @onloop. I know things happen sometimes. I'm a loyal customer and will continue to be. Just want to make sure I get all my purchases prior to spending and more $$$. I need more range because once I start boarding I don't want to stop. My fiance thinks I'm crazy and going through a mid life crisis (at age 34)! I'm addicted to e-boarding now and I've only had my first (Raptor) for 3 weeks!!! I could've bought an old Honda or something. lol. I think this is better. I'm going to be one of the first 10 to buy the Raptor 2 also. You'll see my name on the preorder list. :slight_smile:

@TheImmortalJew, could you answer a few questions?
1) you fixated those 'c' and 'k' clamps after having them made? Or have you done them like this directly in the CNC?
2) Whats the space between clamp-c and clamp-k?
3) This piece are for trucks Caliber II Fifty 10 in/50 degree 184mm?

## \#34 Posted by: TheImmortalJew Posted at: 2016-11-25T17:52:07.741Z Reads: 463

```
It was cut out on a waterjet and the machinist just let it as one piece so it would be easier to drill and tap the clamp holes straight. I cut the two pieces apart with a hacksaw once the holes were drilled. There was maybe an 1/8" gap when it was one piece. 

I test fitted it on 10"/44 degree Caliber I trucks (rock solid btw), but as far as I know it should work on all Caliber I and II trucks.

although realistically the width on both pieces would need to be doubled for strength. Nylon's tough but maybe not that tough

Do you mind me asking how old you are? You have to export it as a cad file and then open it in whatever cad software you want. Or you just learn how to use onshape.
I'll stop feeding you information that is readily available - spend some time on the forum and read!
