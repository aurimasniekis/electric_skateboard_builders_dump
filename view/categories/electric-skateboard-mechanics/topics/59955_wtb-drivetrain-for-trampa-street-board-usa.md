Hello all, 
I am looking to purchase a 2wd drive-train for my trampa street board with 90mm stickies. I am prepared to spend about $250. PM me if you have a kit.
Thanks,
Thomas

@GrecoMan Maybe there was some confusion. I have my motors already. I need motor mounts, gears and belts.

For the record, these are not for a street carver so I am still looking.

I have opted to go with a trampa drive train as they seem to make great quality products and they are comparatively priced with the other options on the market.
