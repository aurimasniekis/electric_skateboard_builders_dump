After seeing such interest in idlers for motor mounts, I decided to set out on my own to produce a mount that would make idlers more mainstream. What I provide is a little different from what I have seen. The idler is a tensioner as well. Moving the idler in the slot is what changes the center distance required for the belt.

With this design, you get the benefit of non slippage w/ an idler, with the compatibility to fit ANY motor size. This will fit any bolt pattern as big as 6364 sk3's, to small 42mm size motors without an issue.

This mount is made to be run with Caliber II style trucks, preferably 10" ones. The clamping pressure is supplied by 2 perpendicular M6 set screws. It is also angle adjustable to provide the needed clearance for your setup. The idler is made with 2 608rs bearings clamped with an M8 bolt. 

Dimensions: The clamp piece is 50mm diameter, 3/8" thick. The arm is 1/4" thick, 64mm wide, and 148mm long.

The mount's are machined out of heat treated 6061 T6511 aluminum. This makes them considerably lighter than steel and acts as a much needed heat sink to keep your motor running cooler.

You're probably wondering what belt to use with this mount. When I start production shortly, a 12mm HTD5M belt WILL BE INCLUDED.  I calculated the clearance, and the following gear ratios are supported for a 325mm belt:
107mm wheel: 40/16, 40/15, 40/14
97mm wheel:  All these^, 36/18, 36/17, 36/16
90mm and below: Everything listed above, 36/15, 36/14

There are more ratios possible with a longer or shorter belt. I am thinking of selling 320mm and 330mm belts to accommodate a lot of ratios.

In the picture, some of the hardware isn't stainless steel. If I get enough interest, I will go out and buy in bulk quantity all the necessary hardware in stainless.

I am located in San Diego, California. I would be willing to ship internationally. My price would be $40 per set with some discounts for those who buy more two or more.

Anyways, yeah that's the plan. Leave some feedback like constructive criticism and let me know if any of you are interested! I will answer all question about the mount. Thanks[poll type=regular max=1 public=true]

Why wouldnt it work with a longer belt if you used a bigger gear ratio?

(I just dont understand, not trying to sound rude)

Now that I think about it, a longer belt would work. I calculated everything based on what I deemed most popular, 36t spur and 14-16t pinion. It is hard to make a mount that can fit really small, and really big ratios. What do you classify as a big ratio? 36/18-20?

Haha i think @longhairedboy uses 25t - 15t so thats kind of the opposite. Id say 32-44t wheel pulleys are common along with 14-16t motor pulleys.

Yeah, they are little tough to work with.  I used a pair of Paris 195's with the @psychotiller RIPBA motor mounts and they are lush. I think Paris trucks ride better and hold up better than Caliber trucks, just my opinion. 

Maybe look at Aliens Paris rings for there motor mounts.

With a 320mm belt, yes it will. I am thinking about selling 2 different belt lengths to fit people's options. I am trying to target the main ratios people use the most though. 320mm and 330mm covers most.

I can't get it loose. You have to really torque them down and use a quality 3mm hex. I orientated them 90 degrees of each other on flat spots of the truck.

A 30mm idler pulley is optional but a bit large. You can find 27mm OD bearings with a 8mm ID. Not a bad option for some with the room.

Any chance of including 15mm T5 belts also? :p would we need two bearings, I think they are 7mm wide each? What do you think ?

The 2 608's will be included, as well as some standard speed spacers to get a good adjustment. 2. You're right they are 7mm wide, 2 should be enough. Maybe a speed washer in the middle of each. T5 belt...maybe. Don't know many people that use those, but we may be able to work something out :slight_smile:

What geometry specifically is needed for reverse? I don't really have a board like that to test but, can't you just rotate the arm piece of the mount tso that it's pointed backwards? The only difference I see is that the idler would change locations. The angle of the arm can be adjusted the same magnitude regardless of what direction it is facing.
```

## \#30 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2017-08-21T04:48:15.687Z Reads: 218

```
For me, when I mounted my TB mount in reverse, i had to cut the slots for the screws where the mount attaches to the clamp. There were 6 slots before and I joined each pair for 3 extra wide slots. This was the only way i could get the right angle for reverse mounting.

If you can get a good angle on reverse (on both left and right side of trucks) you should be good.
```

## \#31 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2017-08-21T04:59:32.600Z Reads: 242

```
Just by playing around with the angle, I can achieve the same angle regardless of which way it is orientated. Here is a bad picture of what I am talking about.

The clamp piece is orientated like you would expect, the right angle is facing up like normal. But the slots I made for the arm are centered for that, symmetrical on each side. There is no difference in the angle you can achieve. Hope that cleared it up :)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/f/8f846070c66213513a5d749dd706d4ca7812d88b.png" width="690" height="300">

Looking forward to these coming together but two things to consider. 

One, it looks like center distance is fixed so getting the right sized belt would be 100% critical. Having some variable distance would be a nice luxury since most of us source our belts one at a time. 

Another, and you may disagree, but I feel the hangar clamp would eventually come loose with just the set screws. I know you said it doesnt so i may be wrong.

I prefer two piece clamps with larger bolts that go all the way through. 

Like this one

You can actually have a fixed C distance since the idler will compensate for slack. Longer belts will have a deeper setting idler, while shorter belts will have a higher setting idler.

Jinra is right, the idler is the center distancing mechanism. I have it all calculated I will upload more info on the real market post I will make soon when I am all ready. There is a good amount of ratios that work but the extremes don't. Can't please everyone :( 

Good point on the clamps, everyone's got a favorite. I placed the set screws strategically. 90 degrees and perpendicular. Straight 180 isn't nearly as good because they're tightened against each other.

I will, I have been working a lot on this. I have 5 sets done so far, finally perfected my manufacturing. All the hardware for the idler clamp is here, packaging material, aluminum barstock, timing belts, everything.

I just want to get a solid foot on this before I accept orders. I know the nature of this market and I don't want to get left behind. Having people wait weeks for a mount just seems unacceptable to me. 

At the rate I am making, I should have enough ready to where I feel ready in a little less than a week.

Grainy picture time! Such bad quality but you get the idea.

```
If you're talking about how the slot for the idler goes through the edge of the plate and doesn't stop, that's for a reason. 
If it were closed off, it would limit some ranges of possible belt tensions. Also, it makes the assembly easier because you can just install everything, then slip on the idler starting from zero tension.
It has a minimal strength decrease. The idler acts like a bridge for both sides when clamped on. No worries of it coming loose either. Your wheels would come flying off before it budged.

Yeah but that's cool bro, it's your design. I look at it like the idler is easy to dis-assemble, the motor pulley/ gear on the other hand not so... plus the weakness is not in the plane of torsional stress. Maybe it doesn't matter, maybe there is lots of extra material and it could be lighter or have more surface area to help cool the motor?
Maybe in version 2?
