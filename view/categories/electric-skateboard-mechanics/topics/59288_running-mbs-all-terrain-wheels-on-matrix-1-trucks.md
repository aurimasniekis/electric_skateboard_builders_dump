Hi everyone, 

I looked on the forum for quite a while and didn't seem to find anyone running mbs all terrain wheels (100mm urethane) on matrix trucks.

Has anyone tried to run these wheels on the standard 12mm axles?

If not what solutions is there for me? 
Here's a couple ideas I had:
- Turning down the stock axles on a lathe to get 9.525mm axles
- Buying replacement 9.525mm axles (didn't find anywhere to buy some)
- Turning my own axles in Cromoly 
- Sell/trade my matrix trucks and get trampa street carver trucks (my least favorite because budget is tight

Looking foward to see what you guys come up with!!

Best regards.
