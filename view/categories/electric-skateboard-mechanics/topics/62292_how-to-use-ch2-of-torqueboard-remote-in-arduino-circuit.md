Hi,

I am trying to "read" the ch2 channel of my Torqueboard nano remote with an arduino but I don't know how to activate it and what it it supposed to return.

I manage to read ch1 with pulseIn function and I have values from 1100 to 1800 (or 2000 when speeding switch is up). I tried to do the same with ch2 but it keeps returning 0.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance.

P.

Thanks for your reply, I actually don't know, is it just the push button on the nano remote?
There is a push button, and I tried to hold it but nothing happened.
