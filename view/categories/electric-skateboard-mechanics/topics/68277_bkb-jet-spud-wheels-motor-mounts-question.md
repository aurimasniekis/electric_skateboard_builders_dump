# BKB Jet Spud Wheels &amp; Motor Mounts Question

```
How do you attach the motor mounts & wheels to the trucks on the BKB Spud? I have tried to set mine up but so far nothing is able to mount properly - the wheel gears push so far onto the trucks that I am unable to evenly mount the motors. I also have no idea what to do with the bearings in the BKB kit; I have Zealous on my 107s. 

It seems that, in order to get the wheels properly seated, I have to push the wheel gear as far back as possible. However, this causes the wheel gear to get caught on the motor mount screws (see pic below). 

![20180916_192101|281x500](upload://2u26RdBl1mixapkhcuXejaGof9a.jpg)


And it also prevents the other motor mount from being seated at an even distance from the 1st motor.

![20180916_192115|281x500](upload://iAysUerjpUn2rslu5jf6cuLOWVd.jpg)

At this point I am pretty confused on this. Does anyone have any idea what I might be messing up?

I think the beating goes against the hanger with the pulley against the beating, but I'm not sure. I have a set and have them I stalled on 107s but haven't mounted then on trucks yet. They are frikkin beautiful though. 

I think if you use the beating you will have enough offset that the wheel pulley should match with the motor pulley perfectly.

Strange, I guess it being 107 causes this, you can try using spacers I suppose though i don't know how much that will help. 

I did notice using the big bearings on mine caused an offset like @mmaner said though thinking about it now i'm a dumbass becuase i dont think I put a spacer in between

@mmaner @Jc06505n

I do have the BKB bearings on the inner-wheel as an attempt to create an offset - however, the 1st motor-mount is still mounted too far along the trucks right hangar, preventing the left motor from having enough space to properly mount the wheel gear, which causes the issue in the first picture. 

The zealous bearings were a part of the order too, though I had some already - I am not sure what the big bearing is for. Perhaps to act as a sort of spacer between the right-axle and the zealous?

@Jc06505n Within the 107s, I have a zealous on the outside and the bkb bearing on the inside. You think the 107s should have 2 zelous within and the bkb bearing should act as a spacer on the axle?

My only issue there I think would be that the axle nut would no longer have any space to lock the wheel in place.

No you have it right... the best you can do I guess is to slap some more speed rings on the axel and hope for the best , probably someone has more insight

I think I might have finally gotten it after some more tinkering @Jc06505n ; I placed the bkb bearing onto the axle to act as a spacer like you suggested @Jc06505n. Then I placed 1 zealous on the inside portion of the 107 wheel. This allowed the axle nut to thread & lock the wheel in placed:

![20180916_211949|690x388](upload://lzPeojyy2sBuxB4jDnj1Vk8Ofkt.jpg)

This the the unmoved motor mount after placing the bkb bearing as spacer on the axle:

![20180916_212005|281x500](upload://VpL0F2ZAffxkuprxIQtRxbdSbZ.jpg) 

There is now plenty of space for me to place the motors at equidistant points.

@Skunk 

Currently, yes - if I add the outer bearing, I will only be able to thread into half of the axle nut. Not enough space to fully place the nut on...

@Colson003

  Not sure what else I can do though...there simply isn't enough space on the axle for everything to fit properly...the wheel currently does fit quite well. Nothing seems loose, since the built-in spacer on the zealous is tightened against the nut.

Yeah you need to flip the nut backwards and then put it on. As long as the teflon n the nut contacts the thread it will lock. I would recommend use red loctite on it as well.

@J0ker3366 @Colson003 So,from inside to outside: use only 1 of the 2 speed rings that came on each axle , the above bearing from bkb's kit as the wide bearing, the wheel, a zealous bearing, and then the flipped locknut? With blue or red loctite, depending on how much thread I get.

I run no spacers on all my boards. I know people who run spacers in theirs. I always got rattle from spacer cause I run a 1/8 back turn on the nut which frees up the bearings a little more than having the nut tight. Spins for days lol.

My only concern is that the motors mounts will still be forced to be set too far along the hangar; since the 1st mount is set so far in, the 2nd mount has less space to work with, as the motors are pretty much touching. You can tell in the second pic from my first post.

The trucks are Caliber II 50Â° RKP Trucks. The motors are specifically 6354 190kv motors:

![20180916_223400|281x500](upload://XIuhAUTOWS4tDjvLfGqvO6TgSz.jpg)


From one side to the other, the can is ~4.5mm:

![20180916_224003|281x500](upload://1JZ8vtStyQLeYrd6GBltPsWGPcG.jpg)


From top to bottom, it also seems to be ~5mm:

![20180916_223436|281x500](upload://7XlVMsrqQJqS0o3LJXW0N5uNhdO.jpg)


@Jc06505n The motors are actually 6354s - I think they should fit on the calibers? With the wide bearing from BKB acting as a spacer (see 3rd pic overall in thread), there may be enough space (5th overall pic). That setup would make it: Speed ring, wide bearing/spacer, zelous bearing, wheel, zealous bearing, speed ring, flipped locknut. This would make fully threading the locknut a concern; half of it sticks out off of the threaded axle.

Kinda. The full kit had the zealous on the order & these ones (third pic) came with the motor mounts. Without them acting as a sort a spacer, I run into the space issue with the motors, as seen in the second pic. I still do not have the outer zealous mounted cause I am about to knock out, so technically I only have 2 atm.

This is a little confusing, since the Wheels did not come with a set of 4 bearings as shown in the manual linked. The Kit only came with 2, while the 107s were to come with zealous (I had my own instead). 

Additionally, unless I am mistaken, even with the bearings sent with the motor mount kit, the motors are still way too close - as seen in pic 2.

I believe each rear drive wheel uses 1 wide bearing and 1 normal bearing. The hub and the wheel will each take half of the 1 wide bearing. The normal bearing is just used as normal bearing - right by the flipped locked nut.

So: Pulley - Pulley hub - wide bearing - wheel - normal bearing - flipped nut

@J0ker3366 The gear/wheel adapter is as seated as it is going to get in the wheels core tbh....though now that you mention it, I am able to wiggle the wheel hub/pulley combo back and forth and even pull it free with my hands. I may need a mallet to ensure its fully seated. But I think the mounting teeth for the hub is as seated as the adapter will physically allow it. Which is odd, if it is supposed to be seated more deeply then its design is doing a poor job. Right now, I cannot push it further without trying with a mallet.

@threebysix I just did the setup as you described. Unfortunately, the issue comes back to the one in the first post - the motors are too close together and are touching, and the wheel gear is in contact with the screw for the motor mount (as shown in the first 2 pics).

@Jc06505n That is odd, my motor shafts extend way past the motor gear. Yours appear to be flush with the mount and with the motor gear....also, the abecs are center set as well.

@Jc06505n I really expected to get what I paid for; I do not really want to pay for more trucks, or to cut into the shaft, or do anything extra other than assembly after delivery...maybe I am being cheap or petty but I did not get what I paid for so far...and I do not want to go to any additional lengths to correct the issue, other than a return/refund. Hopefully I can find a fix with what I have; I sent an email to BKB and I pinged them here as well.

If the trucks really are an issue, then its ridiculous to have paid $500+ for the kit and to have received the incorrect trucks. Additionally, it is clear enough to me now that my motors are entirely different than what you have gotten...if that is due to QC or something, that is enough for me to want to wash my hands of the whole thing.

Last option: Found this in another thread. If anything, doing it this way should tell you What s off or different between each side. Mainly the part about using the pulley by its self to place the mount in position.

Caliber trucks are a bit trickier since they have tapered surfaces. I usually use the wheel pulley to align everything up. Take away the inner speedring, mount the wheel, and then you have something to push against to align it. Fit all screws loosely. Screw in the clamp screw until you get some resistance. Screw the first set screw (1) down until the mount has a loose fit against the truck, not to much as it then will cause misalignment. Then tighten the second set screw (2), and then the clamp. Then go over all of them and tighten down hard.

Thanks for finding this out man - JLabs said hes on crunch time but he'll try to get back to me later today. Hopefully he can help sort things out.

I am not sure what screw the instructions are referring to - I assume they mean the grub screw that attaches the wheel pulley to the motor shaft on two sides? Or is it referring to the gear that attaches to the wheel hub?

The black screws to attaches the wheel pulley to the modular thingy

Sorry for my misunderstanding lol, but are you referring to the 2 black screws that attach the 15T gear motor pulley grub screws to the motor shaft? Or the 5 screws that clamp the 44T gear to the wheel hub in the 107s?

Also @J0ker3366 I think this may be offset by the fact that my motor shafts appear to be longer than normal. I would not be able to align it properly. Ill try to give it a shot.

That, those are the screws the instructions would be referring to

My concern there is that the wheel pulleys will align things improperly - as shown in the first picture. I had actually used the wheel pulley initially to align everything else up, which resulted in the second picture as well - the placement of the 1st motor mount using the wheel pulleys to align things causes uneven motor mount placement for the 2nd motor mount. 

The wheel pulley pushes too far onto the axle & into the hangar; this causes the screw on the motor mounts to get in the way. 

To compensate, I have to move the motor mounts back - but this caueses the motor mount on the other side to have less space overall to work with, which causes the first issue again.

you should remove everything, make sure you are using the large bearing supplied with the pulley and then reinstall the pulley and use it to place the motor mount.  

I understand your getting frustrated, remember this is a DIY pulley kit.  You should expect to have some issues figuring installation out especially since these are brand spanking new.  I'll be you even money, you name the price, that once you figure out what your missing in the install process, it all fits together perfectly.

the only way I see to fix this issue and not have alignment issues is to get regular caliber 2 trucks, As I see it, its the trucks causing the issues here

@Kit  get some really good measurements of the truck hanger from end to end.  Let us know.

TBH my big frustration is the idea that the motor shaft is too large, at least compared to the one in @Jc06505n's picture compared to my own. While it is frustrating that everything isn't perfect lol I am hoping that @JLabs can clarify on things - I mean, he probably assembled one himself for sure.

And yes, my trucks do seem to be too short.  Maybe that is why the motor shafts seem longer than normal? I dont think that would be the case though - they still appear to be shorter than @Jc06505n's when on the motor mount. That particular placement isn't really affected by the trucks.

 I will get some measurements - good thing I fell sick this weekend & decided to take today off haha.

TBH I Don't even know if my motor Shaft is BKB or Kaly shafts, these were @Jinra's once and he decided to put them in BKB's cans I think since the can was shorter

The motor shaft length is variable when considering pulley placement.  It may be that when you have it all assembled its perfect if the motor pulley gets moved out to mate to the wheel pulley.  

It also may be that you have to trim the shaft.  I've had too lots of times, it's really easy.  Put the motor in a ziplock back, poke a hole for the shaft to exit the bag, mark where you need to cut with blue painters tape and use a dremel cut off wheel to cut it.  It literally takes 3 minutes.

If you can get the measurements I'll try and walk you through it.  I wish I had all the hardware in front of me to I could just make a video, but alas I must work :slight_smile:.

@mmaner They are 10" trucks. I have a dremel and can certainly make the cut, but I hate the idea of making permanent changes to something as costly as a motor. I will see what @JLabs says in a follow up email he will hopefully send today. 

Even if I am able to get the trucks and wheel hub/pulley setup properly, the motor shaft issue appears to be mutually exclusive. So it may be necessary to cut it...but as I told @Jc06505n I really find it to be disappointing to have to potentially do that.

I saw bkb tutorial that you have to flip the axle nut, so the nylon side goes 1st to lockâ€™em, maybe thatâ€™s because the limited space left. Have you check?

I've been trying but no luck so far lol, it really is as tricky as the guide says. I was able to address the wheel hub issue. I noticed that I can wiggle the flywheel core loose/off; I decided to use clamps like the guide suggested and was able to get a tighter fit onto the wheels. Atm I think the motor placement issue is fixed; I just need to shave off the metal shaft on each motor by 5mm, in order to make clearance for the 107mm wheels.
