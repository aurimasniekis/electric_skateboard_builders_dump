Hi 

Does anyone know the length of axle a MBS Rockstar pro wheel needs to be properly seated? I'm thinking of running these on TB218 trucks.

Thanks

How you plan to mount the rockstar pro hubs?
You have 8mm bearings for them or you will use spacer?

Would you mind to share the link where you found them?
Maybe they have some bearings with 10mm there too?
That’s what i‘m searching but can’t find.
