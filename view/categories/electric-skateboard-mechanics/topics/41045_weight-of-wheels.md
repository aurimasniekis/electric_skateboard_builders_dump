If you want to jump 180's then Kegel's or Akasha's, but for normal riding Popoca's!

I love the Popoca's but you can save like 300grams with 76mm wheels so for jumping that could be better.

Well Kegels are 'offset', Popoca's are 'centerset' and these are 'inset'. So they feel like Kegels when you turn them around!

I'm pretty sure that was 2.1kg, not lbs. Trampa has the gummies on superstar hubs listed on their site at 467g, which works out to just over 1 lb. per wheel.
