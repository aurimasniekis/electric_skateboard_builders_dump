 This is a review and tutorial of [Avenue suspension trucks](http://avenuetrucks.com/)
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/9/79f85c5a60ff05fad5c05a4823f107f5ae499076.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/b/6b931ab0c8826de3d3261a41a2d20a0f3aada295.jpeg" width="666" height="500">
These are street style trucks not RKP longboard trucks. I got the widest trucks they offered for 9.5" boards, these are actually 9.25" axel tip to tip. My hope is that they will make longboard trucks in the near future, and also have the option for stiffer suspension too, but more on that later.

Luckily the hanger shape is similar enough to caliber trucks that with some minor modification a caliber truck mount will fit. I tapped the mount onto the truck to leave a mark where the handpger was too big then carefully filed the hanger down on 3 sides till the mount fit well.

I took this out for a first ride on my test board (thanks for the great idea @lowGuido) this was actually an incredibly smooth ride watch carefully how stable the board is and how much the trucks absorb, I was pretty surprised how well they worked. These are even smoother than my pneumatic setup because those wheels aren't perfectly balanced. The last few seconds of the video is on a gravel driveway. The one big issue for me is that if I tried I could get the trucks to bottom out or hit the baseplate, but I'm a pretty big guy 6'3" 220lb, the good news is that it didn't do it under normal riding conditions, I had to kinda pump my weight up and down to get it to bottom out. I think these would be fine for anyone under 200lbs.

TL;DR
PROS: 
Smoothest ride I've felt 
Suspension works very well 
Pretty easy to modify to take Caliber style mount
Relatively inexpensive

CONS:
Not longboard style trucks
Hanger must be modified for esk8 mount
Hanger too short for dual rear mount
Dual diagonal might be possible with longer mount plate
Not quite stiff enough for us big guys over 200lbs

I skate park and pool on Avenue trucks regularly.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants a smoother ride.  They let me ride harder wheels without as much punishment on the knees.  My 2 cents.

How do they handle turns? I would like to see how they react when you turn and hit some kind of bump.. are they stable enough or would you get some kind of wobble because of the suspesion it has..

Great.  I just got my Avenue trucks a couple of weeks ago.  I was planning on doing the same thing but with @psychotiller R.I.P.B.A. Axle Set Motor Mount.  I did some quick fittings and noticed it would take some filing to get it to work.  It's great that the enertion mount works as well.  Do you notice any wheel or motor bite at all ?  Curious on how the compression will affect that and how high our spacers need to be to accommodate this.

I tried bangfish springer truck but I was not able to mount the enertion-mount with enought space left for the pulley.
And it's difficult to modify the hanger without weaken them.
And replacing the hanger with caliber, tracker dart etc. is not possible, complete different system.

Someone know if it is possible to extend the hanger?

180mm still too small, never rode them because can't fit the motor-mount without damaging the hanger, they are relly expensive too, don't buy them.

I may use them as a front truck only.

After a few days of testing and stuff I've made 2 videos showing my experiments with the Bangfish and the Avenue trucks

Bangfish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1xzudFo6Ho

Avenue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INu-_bdLkdM

Summary:
I haven't tested them very much outside because of winter and cold but what I can tell: 
The Avenue hanger is unfortunate for electric skateboards.
But the Bangfish hanger is really terrible and a bit overcomplicated in general.
I recomment using the Avenue truck, find a hanger that fits (or modify it), put your motors-mounts on and go

The Evolve Gen2 front truck total is 250mm (same as Enertion truck), the hanger itself is 185mm.
(I'm going to install dual 15mm Belt-System with 2 small R-Specs on this, this will be very very close but I'll try)

There is 98% no difference between Evolve and Avenue pivot-cup-fitting, easy swap

Yes street, but we've to find out if AT-trucks,  the GT trucks or the Gullwing sidewinder fit too, that would be great but I don't have them to test.

You can buy Evolve hangers only, what's the cost of them?

@CamBo
get a batch of baseplates and sell them to Evolve Riders

yea you can get the evolve gen2 hangers on their site ($ 35 each - ouch), below is a link.  Let me know if these look like your hangers, i believe they are the ones you are using.  I contemplated buying a set of gullwing sidewinders as they would have cost me less then just the hangers from evolve but the gullwing hanger looked pretty rounded and would've required more work to get a mount on there.  I also wasn't sure if they would fit the pivot cup on the Avenue trucks.  Would be great to find out if these trucks fit though as it would make it a cheaper upgrade.  On a side note, what is it like to ride on these ?  I imagine it is smooth as hell.

Are there other hangers that are worth testing out?  I'm not sure how other trucks compare, but I'd be willing to order some Avenue trucks to experiment with Paris and let folks know.  

Do people think it's worth a shot or is someone already aware that there's not a shot in hell?

paris trucks will not work.  You need a hanger that goes into the pivot cup on an angle.  Take a look at the hangers on the evolve, gullwing, and avenue trucks to see what i mean.  It's a miracle that the evolve hanger works.

paris, caliber, ...no
watch my video #57, even some angled trucks like Tracker Dart 219 do not fit, but maybe you can file down some aluminium to make them fit in the pivot cup. Evolve is best choice so far.

Ride is good, but don't expect too much, get some soft wheels too and be carefull, nobody have ever testet them in high speed, they are made for skate-parks not eboards ;)

I've also put a thread on the Evolve-Forum: https://evolveforums.com/threads/suspension-trucks-for-evolve-skateboards.452/

Ah, yes.  That makes a lot more sense now.  I definitely see what you guys mean by the angled trucks.  I may endeavor with the Evolve/Avenue for my front, but I unfortunately have my motors epoxied onto my rear Paris trucks. :) Thanks for the explanation.

I contacted Avenue, this is the answer:

"We are working on our longboard RKP trucks and should have them 
available in March/April this upcoming year. They will have much larger 
axles and will be built for better stabilization at higher speeds. Our 
hangers are custom designed so I am not sure that any other trucks 
hangers would work with our baseplates"

@psychotiller has a 273mm rkp truck with 2 motor mounts set up that might replace the hanger on these new avenue longboard trucks..  Hard to say without having measurements.  I know i use the regular skateboard avenue trucks with an evolve hanger that mated well with it.  I still had to dremel out a flat spots for  the motor mount though.  Hoping Pyschotillers hanger mates well with these avenue longboard trucks.

Most people (who aren't using drop through boards) use risers right?

Am I missing something here? Why not make a steel (springy) base plate, the width of a standard truck mounting plate, bent round like this in a kind of U shape that you can bolt ANY standard truck to, then bolt that to the board?

The depth of the U shaped spring could replace the risers...

What if, by using this same principle, you could create a springy (not too springy) plate that fit to ALL standard skateboards and to ALL standard trucks, thereby enabling you to use ANY trucks and have some kind of ride dampener....? Like this I just knocked up...

Gosh! Can you imagine how awful the rebound on those would be with no dampener on those 'travel' bolts...

Intriguing though. There's room for innovation but I think we're getting too complicated. A simple plate of annealed steel should do the trick ;)

Do you think a design like this would need some kind of damper? If it's sprung than it can possibly twist under load maybe and start to wobble. This is a cool idea though.

I thought that too, maybe it'll need some kind of damping...

Hopefully, if I anneal it properly it won't contort with sideways pressure and only compress with upward pressure... We'll see!

I use avenue for my esk8 but, i found it bounce me off at high speed cornering, Im switching rear to caliber. unless suspension has damper on, reduce travel time, it's not good for high speed cornering, it will bounce you off the board.

Im keeping the front tho,

revieced my Avenue Longboard Trucks today

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb7PdIbAUmc/?taken-by=esk8_dresden

I tried to switch the hanger but normal hangers like the Enertion-Hanger don't fit the Avenue Baseplate.

And the Avenue hanger is a about 1cm smaler than the Evolve-Gen2-Hanger I'm currently using and have unfortunate geometry for motor-mounts, so my Dual-15mm-6355-setup will not fit on them which is bad.

Would like to find a wider hanger that fits, currently I can use them as front-truck only :frowning:

I'm using a prototype 165mm, milled 7000 series hanger on a new baseplate with a queen pin. They have been tested to 50 plus mph and raced on Maryhill already. Electric specific is in the works, I modded these with Paul at Avenue.

A word of warning about the magnesium version, I would not use those to mount a motor, the metal will be too soft for that, even the 6000 aluminum rkp prototypes I had barely stood up to the abuse, I cannot imagine the mag version fairing very well. I actually spoke with Avenue about this fact as I had the same idea before discovering the precision version they have been working on. Yesterday I tried to talk him into doing a group buy or something here in this very forum for the proper hangers but the cost is still too high. How much would you guys be willing to pay to get your hands on a pair of precision RKP suspension trucks from Avenue? I'm talking new precision base-plate and hanger specifically for electric skating.

 If there's enough interest I think I can talk them into making a batch for you guys, but like I said, these are precision truck prices here and then electric specific custom batch, and trust me, the cost of production displays this fact well. These work so well though it's a no brainier for me. I actually cannot talk about certain features making them competitive again the top of the line downhill rkp precision's, trust me they have been tested to 50+ mph already by pro downhill riders and perform as well as you can imagine they do. So precision rkp downhill + suspension + electric specific hanger = X you would pay for it?...and right now I wouldn't even bother presenting you with the cost of production, lol..so let's show him some interest and a number of interested buyers and see if we can't get the cost down, it's silly that all eskates don't have suspension after you try these, it's amazing...they have actually saved me from getting bucked off the board now, hit uneven pavement and get thrown all over and these take it like a champ...there's a reason I have an aversion to pneumatic tires..lol, I've never had a need for them and suspension allows me to retain the "skateboard" in my e-skateboard and crush miles..I put nearly 2000 miles on my 1st prototype and working on a thousand miles right now on the second...I sat with him and reviewed a cad drawing and took everything I've been learning from you guys and told him what you want..now we just have to raise our hands, make a stink and get him to make the dang things..please for me, go over to Avenue trucks and shoot them a note about how you want these suspension trucks, or what you want out of the design..Let's bug him till the noise is annoying enough to just do it, lol, he's almost there..I've been bringing all the mounts and existing products up there and showing him what you all use, he's got the measurements, and I even showed him this forum yesterday, so it's on like donkey kong yo, help me rabble rouse if you want these and let's do a show of force, lol

The broken bolts are actually a manufacturing problem, early tkp welds had a few bad apples, the hanger on the tkp is casted alloy and strong enough for eskating, no problem there. I'm referring to the magnesium rkp option available, that alloy will be too soft to support a motor mount and the forces. It's a awesome longboarding truck, and made to be very lightweight, the mag hanger offsets the extra weight in the baseplate, totally different purpose than what we are doing. They would be great for any rkp longboard setups, but not powered. The reason the electric version should be precision is the strength of the alloy used and the precision of the mounting measurements, as a side effect you just happen to get a top of the line precision DH truck on top of it. Surfrodz and Liquid (Carvon) seem to be our top options for trucks at the moment, all are precision machined.

Nope, I am running a precision rkp prototype dh truck we adapted, it's made from 7000 aluminum, it's not released, I think there's just a handful being tested by riders (like me) at the moment. They are 160mm wide, 1.9mm of rake and here's my buddy Jake taking them to 50 mph before I put motors on them.. they are legit..

Just use his contact form, he actually uses it: http://avenuetrucks.com/contact/

No the stock hanger does NOT fit the avenue base. My hanger was custom cnc machined to fit it all together - it is worlds of difference to me! The ride is much smoother, quieter, much more comfortable and less vibration across the board! Rough roads do not transmit vibration through like before. I love it !

Caliber hangers and their corresponding base plates are great because they are specifically made for each other. 
Sticking the hanger in a lathe to shorten it til it fits??? 
I think that level of custom job is probably not going to produce a precision hanger as good as the original. 

My skullboard motors are exactly as they were when I first got them.
There hasn't been anything that really can be "done" ..
I think the motors are probably fine - its the rubber tires that are totally unbalanced on the "rims" of all 4 four wheels that is causing a ton of vibration. This isn't something i can fix, it's just a defective product. Skullboard has not responded to my request for an exchange of the 4 wheels, as they do not believe it is defective.. 
I asked them to post a video of what a "healthy" amount of wheel noise sounds like - they have not done that either. And i can't find anyone with video footage of riding skullboard wheels on smooth asphalt to compare the noise.

thats in general the problem with chinese brands, they see QC in a different light as we do. but then again for that price, how much QC can you expect, a shame rly that it is a gamble to buy such a product. Guess since there hasnt been an update on the ABEC/Kegel Core issue that they probably just gonna sell their kits and close up shop once the inventory is gone.
Back to my pneumatic build i guess, at least those are balanced or can be with some weights.
