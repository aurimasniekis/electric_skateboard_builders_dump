I was wounder what different gear ratios people are running on all terrain setups.  I am running dual 6374 190kv 10S4P with 13x72 200mm pneumatics and get lots of torque no slippage however top end is 20mph was looking to switch to 16x72 to get more high end or maybe coming down from 72T to 66T. Please let me know what you have found works best....

What's your current ratio? With the most common ratios, you should be reaching 28 or higher, say 1:4.8 (15-72). If you have 15mm belts without idler, go with as large a motor pulley as possible..

13-72 and running 15mm belts...no slippage at all thinking 16-72 as an option.
