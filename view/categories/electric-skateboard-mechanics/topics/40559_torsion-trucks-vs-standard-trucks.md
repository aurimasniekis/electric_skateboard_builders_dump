After years of riding on torsion trucks I resently aquired a boosted board with standard trucks and I‚Äôm surprised that modern e-boards are using standard trucks instead of torsion trucks. Exkate/Altered founder Louis Finkle was the first to patent and produce a wireless electric skateboard.  He also patented a torsion truck specificaly for electric skateboards.  His boards were ground breaking and sucessful.  Unfortunately he sold out a long time ago and the company seemed more passionate about making money then quality boards. His boards are now known to be sold at walmart.  
  Back to point...  Torsion Trucks are completely different then standard trucks so it takes practice to get used to.  Once you do learn to ride them I can‚Äôt imagine wanting to go back to conventional trucks on a powerboard.  Carving and turning on Torsion trucks is on a very different level.  After digging around I found a new Torsion Truck. ‚ÄúRevenge Torsion Trucks‚Äù I may try them on my next build.
What are your thoughts and experiances with Torsion Trucks?

Well  personally I'm a fan. I have a set of old ass seismic trucks that I would love to use on an eskate. I haven't found a mount to fit though and my mechanical skills are sorely lacking lol

I dig the shit outta those Revenge trucks. I‚Äôve tried a couple of different mounts. Both of the ones from Torque boards and an enertion type with no success . It‚Äôd be killer if one was out there though

How about filing the mount instead of taking more meat off the hanger.. ?   A dremel may come in handy..

 I‚Äôm not talking about SPRING trucks.  I‚Äôm specificaly talking about torsion trucks originaly designed for electric skateboards.  
Eglide
Altered
Rokitscience UK
These companies all used Torsion Trucks on their electric skateboards for a reason.  Now no one does.  I have no idea why that is...?

Not many people know about torsion trucks.  Thats one of the reasons I‚Äôm bringing it up.  They have been left behind with the first generation of electric skateboards.  Maybe its for a good reason but I liked them and want to see if other people feel the same way.  Maybe there being left behind for a silly reason like the learning curve, patent issues, or production but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll even find anyone who has used them extensively at this point.

No offense. Seriously I mean no offense, But "nuclear pickle" trucks ,which I'm pretty sure Finkle borrowed his design from, suck when compared to pretty much all RKP trucks and most TKP trucks. 

They are different yes. But that doesn't make them better. Certainly not perform better. I don't think they were left behind. They just didn't perform as well. Altered would most likely still be around had they looked for or designed better components.

^^ I'm gonna stick with that..

However if they were talking about the Revenge trucks.(torsion kingpin)..they're great for pumping setups... 

I dont like the torsiin hangar trucks that this thread is talking about

Yes this is exactly the discussion I‚Äôm looking for.   I think we can agree that different riders are looking for different characteristics from their boards.  I‚Äôm looking for a loose carving feel and very tight turning radious.  If torsion trucks are simply crap what other options are there?

A Surfrodz TKP will out turn that truck and be more stable every where else when you want to go faster.

 My brother in law brought me a pair of these revenge  trucks for a build I did for him. On a single motor the torque steer was terrible under accel and brake, even at low speeds. Bad idea for going faster than you can kick,
just my opinion.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/2/62a8341ddefafa089a9ad986c78de3c3a7863ae5.jpg" width="690" height="388"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/9/d9d8eadad2dad8ec527ddeb5dcfea5880761c250.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I‚Äôve had skater kids jump on my board with torsion trucks and jump right off ‚Äúdude I can‚Äôt ride that‚Äù 
Its a completely different animal.  
Personally I prefer them on an eskate over anything I‚Äôve tried thus far.

Revenge Altered and other Torsion trucks all work on same principle of a single pivot point at the king pin.  Not sure what hanger torsion is..

I‚Äôm learning more about torsion trucks and eskate history in general.   Exkate patented them and started producing them in 1997 and continued up untill 2013. I‚Äôve heard that Loaded was origonaly promoting Exkate/Altered 201 torsion trucks to be used on the Vanguard.  Suposidly they had a writeup about it on their website but I haven‚Äôt been able to find it.  
Nuclear pickles only came out in 2006 and were only produced for about two years.  From what I can tell they only came with the board and were more of a toy then a serious truck.  
E-glide also produced high quality torsion trucks although I don‚Äôt know how they got around exkates patents.  They were never able to get around the remote patents..  E-glide seems to still be running but only selling torsion trucks and parts for their aluminum G1 mountain board that in my opinion was obsolete before it came out.

Torsion trucks don't solve any problems that normal tkp and rkp trucks have, in fact I can think of a list of problems they introduce or need to be worked around. the patent on them and inclusion on a successful electric skateboard can be explained by it's market and the resulting buyer of those boards, notice they were not skaters, but commuters, and the novelty of the truck was already played out in the skateboarding industry and failed long ago, so it did not turn people onto the new boards, what they did was introduce people like you to them, make promises and then sell you on a concept that was "different" not better, but it was just new and different and separated it from skateboards. What was the result? commuters and 1st timers buying them up and thinking they were great when they never rode or tuned a tkp or rkp truck in their lives and have nothing to compare it too..I think of the torsion truck designs as novel marketing, and it was good marketing, but it was nothing more..and I have tried just about every truck available, and have these very trucks you are speaking about, including the original eskate torsion truck that breaks three different ways due to quality issues and the Original S10 250mm Carving Trucks, to be honest, they are all crap compared to a quality rkp or tkp truck, period, and you should ride them all tune them all and see for yourself...there's good reason the torsion truck marketing hype has been corrected, it needs to go away and die now..I cannot even get into the technical reasons why but I could talk all day about the merits of a rkp or tkp truck over any torsion design available or already failed in the market. Rohas is the only one worth talking about I think, it is legit and holds it's own against trucks like the Delirium, Randal 125mm 35", Tracker RTS and some other rear traction trucks for ldp or pumping..but that's about it. Giant longboard design like Ham, might use them due to the added height, like on Revenge trucks, but even then it's a novelty, for cruising the boardwalk on a fun toy, not a performance machine...if you want a performance truck, get a performance truck, they have been perfecting the designs for years now and have come a long way...Liquids Fyres, Don't Trip's, K5's, Arsenal, they make sick stuff, none of it packaged in a torsional design for many reasons...their introduction and popularity in electrics is a sign the electric industry needs more skateboarding injected into it and less over engineering of the already existing skateboard industry and their tools..

Its hard for me to take anyone seriously when they speak in absolutes, especially when we are talking about something that is obviously subjective.

They are absolutely the only truck design I've ever used that's broken, internally and catastrophically, the forces applied to the "keys" is unnecessary. I skate on trucks from 105mm to 215mm, high and low, traditional kingpin and reverse kingpin and spring loaded and bushing and even tried the torsion. I ride Ace and Avenue in the park, Bolzen for cruising (ample rake), Arsenals for downhill, indy 109mm for freestyle and Bennet Vector/Tracker RTS combo for LDP, there is a truck for everything...and torsion trucks don't really fit any needs in any form of skating and they break. Name one benefit they offer, no seriously sell me on them, healthy debate is good, why would anyone choose a torsion truck over proven existing designs? 

I even have a set of these trucks in my garage right now, the trucks from a Raptor electric brushed skateboard, the bushings are almost a plastic, the keys in the bushings break after a few rides and I have seen a guys break the truck while simply tightening it, oh not to mention the lack of bushings to tune it for your weight and safety. 

You could argue the torsion truck never slips side to side or lacks the "play" a bushing truck has but precision trucks with queen pins and spherical bearings also solve that issue perfectly well and are included in high end trucks like Ronin, Liquid and Don't Trip, not to mention a regular truck puts the forces on both the kingpin and the pivot, while a torsion truck put all the for on the one main pivot. I also like the decades of bushing development on regular trucks while bushings are sort of an after thought and typically poorly implemented on torsion resulting on a fail of having any rebound and proper return to center..I honestly could go on all day about it, lol, and that's the problem with them, when people begin to look into it and think about it, they make zero sense..

I have 3 sets of exkate 101‚Äôs and one set of E-glide trucks.  I‚Äôve put atleast 1000 miles between them I weigh 160 I have jumped off curbs and never broke one.  The bushings do not last indefinitely and because of the keys when they are done they are really done.  I agree that early exkate trucks were not ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù but thats not what I‚Äôm debating. 
 My exkates have a 6 foot or less turning radius but unlike standard trucks its not a mushy start and then harsh to crush the bushing feel. The torsion trucks are more consistant through the process of the turn and back.  I feel it makes the board more controlable  and has a much more natural carving feel.  By design they are weaker then standard trucks but they were never intended to be used for tricks.

My revenge trucks came in the mail today.  It may be a month before I have all my parts for that build.  
 Currently I‚Äôm riding a boosted v1 and a meepo with an exkate 101 on the front.  It rides so much better then the boosted.  I‚Äôm hoping the revenge trucks have the same radius and feel..
