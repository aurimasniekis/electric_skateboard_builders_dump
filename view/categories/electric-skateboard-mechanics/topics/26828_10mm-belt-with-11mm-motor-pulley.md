Hi,

I want to order 5M 11mm 16T motor pulley. 
Will it run ok with 10mm belt and 10mm wheel pulley?

Thanks

Yes :joy: 

Wheel pulley will be *slightly* bigger but 1mm is hardly gonna change anything

Haha thanks :slight_smile:
I knew it will fit. My concern is that it will slip.

They always add a little extra, usually 1mm to the width of the pulley simply to ensure a good fit without any side rubbing which would reduce efficiency.
