Purpose, Function and Setup.

Would like the intent of this thread to delve into these 3 categories.

Do a search on the forum and you will find consistent testimony of inherent instability associated with Channels. They are very popular and growing in numbers however you will also find very few able to make stable speed with the CT.  
Revered as an "Off Road" truck, hope is someday this design will be ironed out and we will see Channels competitive in track and hill racing. üèÅüèÅ

Dude that thing looks righteously fun.

What're the specs on it? What kind of battery are you throwing on there?

Please report back on your findings. I've never seen that short of a wheelbase on that setup. <3 those @Kaly  geardrives.

Go fast, yes. Racing, no. 

The width is too wide for close quarters racing and the board length required for the angled nose and tail make the boards too long for good drafting.

A long and wide setup might do OK now while we are in the first year of electric skateboard racing but they will quickly fall out of favor once the pack closes in.

@Nowind is a great place to start. The key to making electronics live is the ability to hang a large Watt drive system. A drive system that stays cool lives. When you have a system that has twice the watts you need heat is non issue.  The drive systems available for channels are fantastic, there is no doubt power is a non issue.
@nowind if I remember had worked on stability control with an addition of a moto steering damper.  ![IMG_20190210_082259|690x450](upload://xqrfYZcu5arVhaGgjlt8s22jdob.jpeg)

Function. At a glance, The hanger axle centerline is Outside the kingpin rotation point.  This to me seems ok for making ground clearance but counter productive for stability.  By moving the hanger centerline closer to the clevis king pin or even Inside, it closes the distance between the two fulcrums , putting more leverage control to the baseplate kingpin where it belongs. ![IMG_20190210_083153|690x489](upload://1Hwkh7VKciRvUirZahIKhYGDf1l.jpeg)

Hanger weight is definitely counter productive. I would like to see a driveshaft driven hanger (someday) vs a hanger with weight .  A motor that struggles and makes heat is inefficient. I agree there is a point at where a bigger motor isn't better. When looking for performance there are always balances and compromises to be made.

@Deckoz thank you for taking the time to expand on this topic, both here and in the prior thread. Exactly the kind of information and discussion I was looking for. 

Can we clarify what "high speed" we're talking about where instability becomes a factor? We have a lot of different skill level riders. To me personally, I've not had stability issues up to 40mph, but my board can't even do that without a good hill to assist. 

I realize rider weight/board/skill will always play a factor, but I'm wondering if we're discussing speeds that don't apply to most? IE: channel trucks show these issues most prominently at 45mph+, etc

MBS Matrix Trucks are nowhere near as stable as my Trampas though. :confused: that's actually the exact reason why I never bothered with just buying a LaCroix when I was starting off.

This would cause the board to handle extremely poorly. Nothing wrong with some inherent instability in a high performance build. You still want your board to juke when you need it. Some positive rake is desirable.

@MoeStooge I'd be happy to. Currently I'm running  80a dampeners on front and rear. I've previously run 85/90 in the rear but my 80s have been solidly broken in and I've been enjoying it. The LaCroix Prototipo deck is 30/30 on the end angle, but I dewedge my rear to 20 degrees (have also played with 40/30 and it's fun as hell but rowdy, not sure on higher speed as that was in an offroad configuration). Right now my board has winter tires on, 8" knobbys, I've been running 7" Inlines otherwise. I change up my configuration every few weeks to test new things. 

Trampa Ultimate Trucks = CNC Light Hanger &amp; Baseplate with 9.525mm Titanium Axles &amp; Titanium Kingpin.

Another thought regarding this subject.  How do channels cope with extreme acceleration?
When I built my latest set up I had to deal with wobbles at full throttle from the line.  Acceleration was the killer.  Any kind of foot movement could induce some sphincter constricting events.  The only channels I have ridden have been on a fairly low torque set up with gummies so it was fine up to full speed and then became unstable **_for me_**
Note the highlight.
Interested to know if the channels suffer the same walking that rkp with bad bushings can.  I'm only asking this stuff because of a genuine effort to learn because I really want a set up that will allow extreme acceleration, top out at 35/40 and yet still have some good carving abilities.  If such a thing is possible.  I have my evo set on hardish bushings with very loose 50' trucks and while its super stable at 40+ it is not the most manoeuvrable machine at low speeds without a slide and In the immortal words of Danny Glover
 I'm getting too old for this shit

[/quote]

I wish I could speak with more hard data to back this, but so far it's not been a concern of mine in the least, and my board is built more for "Hold onto your dicks" level of torque than it is for speed. 

@SeanHacker & @Skunk can probably attest to this. The 0-30 is generally dictated by the gravity of ones nads on high power gear drives w/ pneumatics. 

Now this comes at a price, because I also burn through battery at the rate of 30-45Wh/mile when I'm dicking off and trying to burn out.

It seems pretty solid at Full Throttle. 
The biggest hindrances for me was the terrain we were ridding on because it was a narrow path with pedestrians and cyclists.
And the fact that I could tell I need to throw my weight much harder in order to get the responsiveness I wanted. 
But then again the board wasn't set up for me.
In addition to the light amount of ice on the ground and the fact that I'm in a cast and probably shouldn't be f****** around too much on high powered board I've never ridden before.

Here is a good explanation of "rake". As the axel center moves away from the hanger pivot centerline toward the street the truck becomes more unstable, much like the current design in channels.  If the axel is moved to the board side of the pivot point it becomes more stable. This should make it easier to understand. I think this needs to be made and tested.

Yep. Confirmed. I'm not used to the type of board or trucks, but it felt great. Just a different ride than I'm used to so i had to concentrate at first. Full throttle and getting to speed felt comfortable and i wouldn't mind hitting 30-35mph on it no problem.

Channel trucks are by FAR the easiest to make and prototype in a small shop.

They're among the easiest trucks to get really high precision with, and good turning.

But the drawbacks are that getting a good resistance system is much more difficult and traditional bushings just don't work, so you always end up with proprietary solutions or springs.

Also you have all metal on metal contact, so there's nowhere for shock absorption and you'll have a lot more vibration. I think this is also why some channel trucks have had issues developing cracks once you motorize them.

Slight con is also that its harder to make a channel truck that has zero axle offset. The axle and the "kingpin" bolt would have to intersect, so a zero rake truck would have to have split axles. Which really isn't a big deal, just less simple.

There really shouldn't be any stability problems with channel trucks IF you can get a reliable bushing/resistance system. I think steering dampeners are total overkill and just compensating for resistance that doesn't work.

Well said. I do like their simplicity. The rigid  clevis setup would require some beefing.  With some work in the bushing Dept I think it's worth a persuit. The clevis angle could be easily adjustable as well

That is more or less the same set up my brother has in the uk.  Hes a massive trampa fanboy and if he could be bothered with on line shit he would be all over this.  Hes more of a pain in the arse than I am though so probably for the best.  I had his set up for a week last year and I found it hard to ride tbh.  My fault though because I have always had normal trucks on my stuff and have ridden boards for 30 odd years.  He never touched a skateboard before esk8.  Horses for courses.

I'm sure an oversized bearing 30x8x10 could take the abuse. Lengthening the clevis pin to increase the yaw fulcrum points as well. Making it precision would be the outcome. A tortional PU bushing could be an answer to replace springs and would lower the overall profile.

Assuming you're using the trampa deck, with or without bindings? The issue I have with channel trucks is that if I'm to use channel trucks on regular deck, I'd need a 35 degree adaptive risers. But that lifts the board from the ground by a lot and would be extremely unstable anywhere above 35mph. 

On a Trampa deck though, I think its perfect with bindings. If you take out the dampas, the board turns on a dime though its still not as turnable as an RKP or TKP. So for acceleration, channel trucks is good but it will never be maneuverable as RKP or TKP.

Personally, I like the channel trucks and have taken mine up tp o 43mph.

Thats just the direction mountainboards have taken their trucks.

Longboard channel trucks do tend to have their angles built into the baseplate just like any other longboard truck.

Its just something mountainboards picked up because it works well with the larger pneumatic tires, and allows you to get a dropped deck in a more compact way. As long as you're sticking with drop decks its not a bad way to go, but you're stuck with pretty significant drop to make it work.

With boarding more and more going with topmount decks with large drops being more and more niche, I would say probably wouldn't be a bad thing for channel trucks to start to ditch having the pivot angle built into the deck, and build it into the baseplates instead, even with larger wheels.

Definitely, I can see the benefit. It'll be even better if it can stay low to the ground for lower center of gravity. Just having the option of changing the strength of the springs and dampas, channel trucks has the potential of being great for track racing.

I really like trampa's trucks.  I also don't plan to go anywhere past 40 or race with it, but I have gotten it up to 38 mph without wobbles on a Kaly.  @Nanorider was next to me and was going even faster also on a Kaly probably ~40 granted I did tighten up the rear end before I go but fast-ish speed is possible while still having stability.  I also need 4 lanes to turn when I have the back tightened up :D

Found screenshot of the run.

So here's a truck I've been working on lately, which are channel trucks.![](https://i.imgur.com/Huv8VIZ.jpg)

These aren't Eskate worthy at all, obviously, since they're being 3D printed still and have that super narrow hanger.

But these are 35/30 baseplates.

And then way back I helped make Other Planet Trucks.
https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0917/0578/files/products-truck_large.jpg?v=1469688653

They're channel trucks as well, but the baseplate is only 17 deg.

I've personally taken a pair of these up to 40, and on Luge they've broken 100 and placed at maryhill in 09 or something.

Making something dedicated for Eskate should be super doable, because channel trucks are SOOO easy to make. In my mind the only real hurdle is figuring out how to make a good system for resistance.

Do you have video of your ill fated attempt to go 25+mph on channel trucks?

I am actually curious though- have you spent much time on one of these types of boards? I mean no disrespect, it's just that you've thrown out some pretty hard opinions a few times on this topic, yet have been the most vocal to demand that others bear the burden of proof. 

I am stoked if you're interested in experimenting with this style of board. Ultimately, *I have a lot of fun on mine* which is the main reason I ride. I look forward to seeing what your experience brings.

Never owned a set. But have ridden a few different trampa bulds and a the Laquoix.  Helped a guy out speed testing trampa channels. Here are some statement links from my buddy from when he testing. 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-speed-40-50-mph-build-i-need-advice-help-please/36381/122?u=moestooge

My experience so far with Trampa builds is similar. They arent stable above 25mph. My buddy has a 16ply 4wd and hits 30mph+ regularly but definitely looks wiggly at those speeds.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/e-toxx-directdrive-vs-trampa-vesc6-vs-leopard-8072-170kv-vs-nowind/30822/58?u=moestooge
Yeah my current trampa gets squirmy about 30mph. Should be a fun project to try some different things on to improve highspeed stability (wedges under baseplate to change truck angle, rigid enclousure to stiffen deck, custom spring inserts/dampas).

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hilly-range-estimate/33966/11?u=moestooge  

Lots of wobbling on my Trampa at 50kph. The right dampas and spring tension settings will help but they seem inherently less stable than regular longboards

Im near 50mph(80kph) on my wood deck with zero wobbles so I definitely feel like its a function of the deck and trucks as opposed to riding technique. Im 6‚Äô2" so I already have my feet as far aprt and forward as possible and I dont have straps on the trampa Im referring too. The decks are super flexible and high off the ground. All really flexible decks seem to wobble prone above 50kph from experience.

Im gonna try this weekend on pneumatics actually. Just a 1st attempt on a board thats totally not suited for going over 40mph but has the gearing and power to break 60mph easily. Im hoping to at least break my own top speed of 49mph but even that seems sketchy on this board. Should be good fun either way.

Yea, be careful out there. That board was scary to me. Watching you hit the pavement at 15 mph was not pretty, I don‚Äôt want to see it at 60‚Ä¶

If any board could do it though, it would be that. Did you ever get the settings dialed in?

My 25hp trampa couldmt break 40mph without the wobbles despite taking most of the rear truck angle out and tightening the springs all the way down into the stiffest white dampas.

Ive seen the elastomers but I think my set up will need more than that to be stable at high speed. With the springs cranked down on the white dampas the board was super stiff, but the vertical and torisonal flex of the trampa deck still made it very unstable above 35mph. The sketchiest part is letting off the throttle. The slight shift forward onto the front causes a bounce that easily turns into a wobble. A rigid deck is must if I wanna try for top speed on this drive train set up again.

Aren't flame's dirtpipe similar?

But Darrel is a pretty big guy though. My deck is 16 ply and I'm 170lb, at high speed I've had no problem doing jumps at 35+mph. There's even a video of it by Tishawn from the DC trip. But when I was carrying an extra 35-40 lb, AKA my spud build with trampa trucks, the deck was wobbly at ~25mph. 

And I think it takes a while to get used to Trampa build especially with high speed & high torque. Just needs a lot of practice.

It's almost like it's an entirely different style of board.

@MoeStooge I appreciate that you took the time to compile others accounts. Shall I scroll up and quote the 5-6 people in this discussion that have said 30-40 has been fine?

It's also worth noting that most of my ESK8 riding miles have been on a LaCroix deck, not a Trampa. They're 30/30 and have a lower center of gravity.

Ya totally agree on the "entirely different style of board." part :slight_smile: 
I hated the trampa platform when I first got it.
It took a while but now its my go to for daily commutes since It rides out all the imperfections and crap on the city roads.
I can't comment on the platform being good for racing since I don't do that but I feel very comfortable with it in the 35mph range on good roads.

Correct me if I am wrong but the trampa decks have no concave so they are going to have a lot of torsional flex.

I have a few pintail decks that I ride when I just want to kick push around town and due to the shape they do not have any concave at the tail. As soon as I start hitting the mid 20's going downhill the rear end will start oscillating unless I put all my weight forward.  If I don't use my "expirence" and keep my rear foot weighted it will toss me.

In short, get low and lean forward. If you still get wobbles get lower! - D, Engel

This is one of the reasons why I think having FWD eskates is a good thing.
It trains people to keep their weight forward over the drive wheels instead of over the rear wheels.

Sloppily putting your weight on the rear is just asking for speed wobbles at near any speed, and if people are used to standing more in the rear to get more traction so the wheels don't spin out they're just setting themselves up to not be able to ride fast.

Fwd is something that needs to be discuss more. Not sure if this this the right thread but when you brake, a lot of the braking force is needed to stop the momentum. This is why in motorcycling they always recommend 70/30, with majority of the brake force on the front to stop the vehicle rather than vice versa. 

Of course this is true of pneumatic tires rather than urethane but I think @MoeStooge speed board is also fwd.

I've ridden Indys for 30+ years, 139,149,159 depending on the era/board and ride trampas for a short time. No dampas up front, yellow in back and springs on inside position.  I go under 25 but as long as maintaining a carve one way or the other(never just cruising fast flat) it feels super stable. Surfy/snowboardy. Would go faster but for physical issues right now, can not fall. Just a different take on it and obviously at much slower speed than being discussed.
