Hey guys,

Largely our community uses stock trucks and then modify to accommodate power. Lets think from the ground up. What do WE need. 

My Background: I have a machine shop and plan to machine these trucks and do the CAD/CAM in our fab shop.

My main motivation is to solve and make more elegant, the motor mounting, drive wheel side accommodations (if necessary) and what ever. 

**What features do you wish you had on your trucks. Here are some ideas and questions I have.**

 - All aluminum machined parts
 - Hardened/Tempered Steel axle inserts
 - [Spherical Bearing](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=sherical+bearing&*) Pivot
 - Integrated motor mount for Single/Dual/Inside/Outside
 - Clean Design
 - Designed in Fusion360 - Open Source

**Feedback from you guys please:**

- on the above items (of course)
- Preferred Geometry - widths, heights, baseplate angles
- hub motor integration?
```

* Maybe some kind of heat sink functionality on the motormount/truck combination. Thick aluminum motor mounts already do a good job at this, but could be exploited more by adding surface area with fins, which would look killer too.

* Wider trucks that accommodate 2x xx64 or even 2x xx74.

* Getting high speed stability without huge turning radius

* Integrated suspension

Good luck!

I believe the best hanger shape for a truck would be a square, basically the caliber hanger without the curved part. I'd love to help a bit with the design if needed, I'm a basic user of OnShape and F360. But I guess there are more advanced people here so only if you need someone.

So the features:

Vibration dampening somehow (maybe a special riser?)

Integrated suspension as said above

A mount that comes with the truck (maybe same principle as the Enertion mount?)

EXTENDED HANGER 200mm+

Changeable axles so that you can use different lengths - the Trampa hubs for example are 34mm instead of the 24mm a normal wheel has.

Definitely a wider hanger, that allows dual xx74 motors, especially for esk8s which could be used off road or for semi-off road purposes.

Caliber profile - only because mounts are widely available. However as long as the design of the mount for the trucks was good enough, I have no preference to profile of the hanger.  The motor mount should also be able to secured at multiple angles around the truck to suit user preferences. 

Suspension would be nice (as per Seismic G5), but not deal breaker, especially if you're using pneumatic tyres.

Adjustable baseplate angle - because why not!

Just thinking out loud here:

* Changeable axles might be possible, by using a channel milled along the centre of the hanger, which is secured by a pair of locking nuts, like nylock nuts, which are partially recessed into each end of the hanger.

* Also, the extendable axle inserts could be reinforced by the longer axle, securing it in the same way as described above.

* If you wanted to get all experimental, a flat surface around the kingpin to mount wider and or thicker urethane bushings (not saying I have tried this, or if you could even source these bushings).   It might be interesting to consider, at least from a design perspective if bigger urethane bushings might be helpful in addressing speed wobble.

Not sure if these ideas meet the requirement of whats in a precision truck, but I think they would be cool.

Integrated motor mount for Single/Dual/Inside/Outside
[/quote]

That would mondo mega badass awesome.  Most of my maintenance time is spend getting the motor mount clamp straight.  It just tends to move a little bit every 50-100 km.  A decent set of trucks with a solid/welded clamp so you jus screw the motor mount plate down at whatever rise you want would be great!.

mainstreet, RKP is not the way to go they are unstable just like regular TKP.

We need something different than skate world, it doesn't work.

Where are you located ? I can show you some innovative longboard gear that could change eskate

Just an insight, I have made the word's first entirely 3d printed skateboard trucks, and ride it everyday for the past 6 months without issues, I will give the design out someday

Riding eboards with such powerful motors and batteries i feel the calibers are from the past. We need something really up to the task, i think more and more about the ronis. i would love to have a truck which can hold the turbulences of high speed and agility at lower speeds. Namely ronis btw, with the shape of the hanger like calibers to be compatible with all the mounts already in the market.

I Hopefully will have my truck hanger done by next month. Caliber profile (205mm width), allows dual 6364 motors to be used with 60mm axle bolt and dual 6374 motors with 70mm axle bolt and spacers. I made them fit on caliber base plates and they use axle bolts like on Surf rod trucks. Once I finally get them done, and know they work, I will be sure to share my model with anyone who is interested.

I drew these up a couple weeks ago, no machine shop yet. they won't be cheap.

250mm hanger. hex for mounting. rounded end for pulley bearings. ronin style dual pivot because why not!

OK guys, great feedback.

Here are some of the goals/issues:

**Decided**

- The design will be able to be machined on a 3 axis milling machine with minimum setups and simple work holding and fixturing. This will keep costs reasonable. For instance this would make square profiles simpler vs round or hex like @saul added (real perdy though Saul). I want to make it relatively easy for a basic CNC shop to execute. Maybe even on a CNC router. 

- Patent infringement is a risk. For instance, Ronin's pivot pin was patented quite recently. 

- Longer hangers to accommodate larger motors. In fact it would be super easy to change the hanger width in CAD or even offset a side for a wheel gear with in integrated bearing. 

**Exploring - thoughts guys?**

- I like the idea of a spring return with no bushings; like the Seismic G5. My understanding is that their patent expired in 2013. The intent will be to improve this approach and not rip off the design :slight_smile: We will try to use commonly available [die springs](https://www.mcmaster.com/#die-springs/=172h0ll). 

- I am exploring using a solid axle or axle inserts

- 3 part baseplate? Like this? [from here].(http://www.chrismagoon.com/adjustable-longboard-trucks.html)
This design and ones like it (its not the only one) allow for pretty simple milling yet a nice feature with the adjustable angle.

I only have a few requirements.

1. 215mm wide hanger or more. 
2. Not too expensive
3. Stable at 45kph/28mph but still able to make sharp turns. 

I really like the idea of adjustable angle if does not add a huge amount of cost. But if its a fixed angle I would want 50 deg.  

If I didnt have a budget I would say integrated motor mount and heat sink fins but that seems like it could add a lot of machining time. 

@saul's design is super cool
```

## \#19 Posted by: saul Posted at: 2017-04-06T20:00:49.111Z Reads: 380

```
Thanks. I know the patent could be an issue, I was planning to contact Ronin about this since they're local.

And I was thinking to keep cost down it could just be a custom hanger compatible with the cast Ronin baseplates. This means you could upgrade to the CNC baseplates for adjustable angles.

The regular base plates and pivot ball is about $30 each. Vs the CNC hangers like $300+

As for the hangar shape, square would probably be the easiest, but hex is just a large chamfer on that. And gives more surface area for the clamps.

Been geeking out on CNC trucks for almost a decade now... Here are my thoughts

* **RKP** design with a standard geometry.  You can really cut costs for the end-user if your CNC hangar fits on a cast baseplate. Randal has 50, 42, and 35 deg plates for cheap.   Sell it as full CNC hangar/BP or CNC hangar only.  

* **Motor mount**.  If you're making a truck specifically for e-skate, an integrated motor mount would be ideal.  Gets rid of the clamp entirely. If you made a hangar that supported two motors, you could create a strong yet lightweight design by creating a torsional box

* **Directional** setup.  Use a higher angled baseplate front (45-50°), and lower in the back (20-35°). Then the rear tracks the front, resulting in a more stable setup.  Adjustable baseplates would take care of this.  Maybe just focus on a rear low-angle  truck at first

* **Inline axles** increase grip  (axle is inline with kingpin, not offset like a Randal or Caliber)

* **Screw-in axles** get you a range of widths with a single hangar. Many CNC trucks on the market use this same approach to great success

* Avoid spherical bearings. They get twitchy at speed.  A ball pivot with high quality urethane pivot cups feels much better in my opinion. At the hangar/kingping interface, I prefer a urethane plug (like Rogues) to a spherical bearing.

* Springs are gimmicky. Seismics were always a pain to setup and never felt right to me.  Urethane bushings are much more readily available for any duro you'd want

* Adjustable pivots.  If you make the length of the pivot adjusable, you can make the hangar fit on (almost) any baseplate {see Zealous trucks for inspiration, but probably not necessary}

@saul

Hey man, yeah you don't need to worry about patent infringement unless you sell something  based on a patented design. That being said, I'm no lawyer. The other thing is you can sell what ever you want. It is the patent holders choice/obligation to prove you violated their patent. i.e. they may give no F&%ks. :slight_smile:

I like your idea of having the ability to use cast base plates.

It's cheaper to purchase complete cast trucks unfortunately. The baseplates don't come with, suport pins, support pin cups, washers, bushings, axle nuts, and probably pivot tubes.

That being said @mainstreet I think there are files of Ronin trucks online (don't know how accurate), but I'd be happy to pay and do any testing of Ronin's if you decide to do hub motors. I realise if you do Ronin's it will be niche category since the cost will be high, basically just for people that really really like Ronin's

squishy pulled this back from the dead...

Any one doing this needs to look at what works and what is the best!
two different things IMO

None of this is practical but look at the shape of the Aera k5's. The hanger is only 164mm wide... 

https://d1mhp7frcfvst4.cloudfront.net/assets/aeratrucks/productimage/size/302x302/method/padding/v/b6f8/THAK5B.jpg

this is a improvement over the k3's

https://d1mhp7frcfvst4.cloudfront.net/assets/aeratrucks/productimage/size/302x302/method/padding/v/1798/THAK3C.jpg

and k4's

https://d1mhp7frcfvst4.cloudfront.net/assets/aeratrucks/productimage/size/302x302/method/padding/v/6a8e/THAK4X.jpg

the hanger has moved towards a triangle shape and it works better than the k4 surfrod type support with extra material  on the top of the hanger.

Similarly the base plates have got as wide as they can so they are stronger with less deflection. All of this adds to more precision and a tighter feel.

the k5 base plates

https://d1mhp7frcfvst4.cloudfront.net/assets/aeratrucks/productimage/size/302x302/method/padding/v/aa92/TEAK546R.jpg

and the k3/4 plates notice they are narrower

https://d1mhp7frcfvst4.cloudfront.net/assets/aeratrucks/productimage/size/302x302/method/padding/v/59be/TEAK346X.jpg

Personally I think the average rider puts his eSk8 trucks under more load than gravity trucks because of the change in forces the driven wheels can apply are additive to the load applied to ridding them. Although if this is as much as a DH beast skidding down a mountain that is another question.

This is simple.  I want a 12mm axle hole that goes straight through the whole truck, end-to-end


So I can put any size 8mm to 12mm in there and any length I want

So if, for example, I wanted to cut the trucks off 2cm from the kingpins and slide motors OVER the axles I could even do that. 

Or I could put a longer axle in there if I want to use Electric Flywheels instead of SuperFly wheels.

Or I could put an 8mm or 10mm or 12mm axle in it.  Or an axle evolve-style that was 8mm but stepped up to 10mm where the pulley goes

Or you fabricate different axle stubs. This one allows street and AT wheel setup (basically a copy of the Evolve axle). Unfortunately, the typical cheapskater doesn't want to spend lots on trucks.

I do like the idea of an open source eskate truck however I feel like most of the ideas here are based on standard skate truck design . . . if we could do anything is this the best place to start? 

There is a large number of creative people here, if we actually thought a little more outside the box maybe we could create something brand new specifically for eskate.

Some ideas, unrelated to each other and maybe ridiculous:
- Tampa style channel truck that could fit a standard board?
- base plate with integrated motor wire channels to keep things tidier
- Threaded holes in hangar faces so that mounts can be bolted on directly?
- longer hanger than needed, cut to length yourself then screw in axles?
- base plate that has space to mount VESC inside, enclosing when bolted to board. base plate could also act as heat sync.
- built in steering dampener?

I was thinking about some trampa style trucks that had space for motors integrated inside. This means you could get the motor close enough to get direct drive even on 90mm wheels. Threw together a quick mock-up of what this could look like :slight_smile: Also i am aware that there is currently no space for the springs inside the hanger but maybe they could be external at the back or underneath.

I like where this is headed 👍. 

At some point I'd like to see a switch to driving an axel that drives the wheel, instead of driving the wheel direct. You'd get better support for the gears, as you could have a bearing each side; this should cut down on vibration (no more cantilevered beams) and therefore noise. Opens up other options; solid rear axel (aka welded diff), differential system, or even just the status quo of two motors. With better gear support and precision you could even start looking at bevel gear setups.

Have you tried uploading the hanger to something like [Xometry](http://www.xometry.com), or [3dhubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/cnc-machining). You'll need to signup, but they provide automated online quotes which would give a ballpark figure on how much it would cost to machine. I've run some much simpler motor mount designs through and the quotes were reasonable (even for a single piece). Machine time is the big cost, and I'm guessing it'd take quite some time to mill down this design... it'd still be interesting to know the $$$.

Of course for all I know you may have a Tormach in your garage :money_mouth_face:.

Don't know how I missed this thread.

So having tried 20 trucks or more and comming back to the same this is what I need in a truck:


- 176mm -184mm width
- 48-45 degree baseplate (adjustable in the back from 45-20)
- Suitable for double tall barrel bushings
- Insert bushing would be awesome
- As much surface for the pivot as possible (as tight of a fit as possible), this will also take strain from the bushings and put more weight on the pivot. Allowing more freedom in bushings set ups.
- a dished bushinng seat is bliss. (if the bushing is tightened it compressses in the dish, preloading the bushings by default) 


(example of a dished seat, hard to explain)

184mm hanger width with an additional 8mm in axle length on either side with removable axles. That would allow me to run 15mm belts in a dual 6355 config on a normal sized truck. Also wire management in the base plate. 

I don't think wider trucks are the answer here unless you just need to cram dual 6374s on there. The downhill community is using increasingly narrower trucks for good reasons.

queen pin, dished bushing seats. 

I'd love to produce some of these locally if this works out.

Indeed narrow trucks are in the coming.
They turn quicker, give you more direct weight on the wheel and the are NOT less stable as popular belief may let you think.

I am comfortable on 174mm. Have to admit though, people running 160mm on races isn't for me. They are so damn snappy :)

For a single motor of diagonal-dual motor setup the narrow trucks will work just fine, or better really, but for dual motor it seems 220mm is needed to get those big motors mounted together...The hanger width options for a company wishing to make an eskate specific truck needs to make them in 165mm, 180mm and a 220mm...it's quite a lot of differences in size options for the same truck but it would be ideal..

I currently run a 169mm precision rkp truck on my single motor long range board, I find the truck width to be just about perfect for the 90mm and 97mm Abec11's and even better for the 107's..

I'm going to try the 218mm Torque trucks and a dual setup to see how these super wide Torque boards trucks perform using the same wheels. It's strange how the far the wheels stick out, I am not use to this at all. I typically ride top-mount so I am really curious how the setup will ride. thinking of putting it on a Prism Theory v2 deck with the appropriate risers..

you could continue the arc towards the first shoulder next to the pivot if you wanted, it kind of looks like it heading there anyway or you can keep the shoulders as your steeze...

As for the bushing seat, I'd shout out to @Alphamail and ask him for his thoughts?

if you look at the following images you will see there is some relief around the bushing seat for deformation of the bushing and so bushing washers and cups don't hit the hanger.

  ![image|596x246](upload://oMRDMamykqTJREUIHhZ2Q72rXZH.jpg)

the problem is solved in both in two different ways, one just removes the material (k5) and the katanas remove material at a angle to the sides of the bushing seat where lateral load is applied to the bushing as the hanger pivots towards the kingpin.

How thick is the hanger now LittleBro, and how deep are the bushing seats road and boardside?
Do you have any rake?

What exactly will fail, the screw-in pivot or the hanger around the pivot? I am not entirely sure whether an aluminium pivot extended from the hanger is that much better than a stainless steel (e.g. 17/4 PH) pviot with an M10-M12 thread? If you look at the graph, the shear capacity of an (e.g.) M10 bolt is within tens of kN.

Steel / SS / TI threaded into 6 or 7 series AL, constantly taking 2X the abuse the axles take eventually takes it's toll on the Pivot.  One of our team riders, would continually egg out the pivot / hanger interface of Fyre trucks making it loose in short order.  He was not an abusive skater either.  If you go that route, design will be extremely important to it's success.and durability.  I would make it unremovable.

Thanks for clarifying the issue! The pivot implementation on the Fyre trucks doesn't look that great and I can somewhat understand why the pivot will egg out over time. A longer stub (maybe twice as long), M10 thread and then glued in like an actual axle stub should make a difference.

Let me please recommend you 2 small things:
- As you can see on the picture (marked red) make sure you put a filet to those corners, inner corners are never a good thing on a material, because they can't transfer surface vibrations, and weaken the material.
- second recommendation is, you should make some small filets all around the hanger, it would make it look more clean and well thought trough

@GrecoMan

I might be barking up the wrong tree here, but have you considered putting a horizontal bend in your hanger plate design, so that you would have a twin angle truck? Say a 5 degree bend on the hanger, mounted on a 50 degree baseplate, would result in 45 and 55 option truck. With this bend, if you flip the hangar you could have a lower (or higher) angle truck depending on which way the hanger was oriented.  Maybe I am getting my nomenclature mixed up, but this idea might have some merit.  This is what I mean.

A cheap way to get variable angle trucks!

The “bend” would go along here:

![image|332x175](upload://dn0SzsHCvdkruzHqhDYKMNaPzA4.jpg)

Here are some sketches, I might be way off base here, but throwing I'm this into the mix of ideas anyway.

Ordinary RKP truck with a flat hanger (e.g. 50 degrees):

![image|364x308](upload://cmEKqMb6a58UNvmW3mCPBmGFQ9z.png)

Five degree bent hanger (resulting in a higher angle, e.g. 55 degrees):

![image|362x316](upload://55GHdoC7GH9PfMRtpeVqfL6S3mf.png)



Five degree bent hanger flipped 180 degrees (resulting in a lower angle e.g. 45 degrees)

That looks nice but may be also quite expensive. Take your STEP file and upload it to 3dhubs just to have a feeling how much it will be. I would consider to glue / press or weld it onto the hanger. Basically, something like that:

It is a common misconception that what you describe changes the angle of the truck...It does not.  It gives the truck "rake" and the effect of positive rake is a a more lively truck where negative rake is very calm.  Trucks with 0 rake will feel like caliber trucks.

Even if Avenue sold the suspension baseplate separately it's geometry fits nothing on the market and would be pointless. The hanger needs to be shorter to account for the added height of the suspension and the whole package works well together. If you made your own hangers, sure, but that's sort of hard to do. I am instead urging them to take all your ideas and put them into a 220mm hanger for dual motor setups. Designing things is easy, bringing these to production isn't (you prolly know this). I am forced to be patent beyond my abilities, but I'm learning slowly..lol..

Good thing everyone uses solidworks. I saw this file when I was looking through google, but I wasn't sure how precisely it was modeled. Did the guy actually measure the pivot joint with a caliper? I guess I'll have to do some modeling myself regardless, but it's nice to know what method he is using to make these models.

No idea man, sorry. But if you're willing to make a super accurate model of a caliber truck, that's a valuable contribution to the community. If not, then I'll do it :stuck_out_tongue:

As far as accuracy, you can't get too accurate with cast trucks. I've had calibers with truck holes as far as 2mm off. Calipers will help but you can't take all the dimensions to the exact hundredths decimal because of tolerance with cast trucks. 

Solidworks is still the industry standard but I feel like Fusion 360 is going to take that mantle soon. It's getting more and more popular everyday.

Well the cheat here would be to ask @Alphamail for the CAD to the pivot joint of the Caliber. The rest of the lengths can be measured closely enough.

I'm more a machinist than a CAD user at the moment, so it would be nice for someone else to step up to the plate for modeling. I occasionally have access to a Haas vertical CNC mill, so I'd like to try my hand at attempting to machine a handful of trucks for myself. Even better, if someone else has a model for different precision trucks, I'll happily see if I can make something happen...

So let me just put down what I'm looking for in the trucks I want to machine.

Target weight of 1.8lbs per truck (including baseplate)

Compatible with Paris Baseplate

Caliber Bushing Seat

8mm Split axle design

3* rake

This setup is basically a higher riding, lighter, larger wheelbase offset rendition of Atlas Ultralight trucks.

Over the past year, I've been through many iterations of my own design and I'm still not quite there. I have to say it's not that easy to understand how the truck behaves if you change properties like axle offset w.r.t. KP, rake, bushing seat shape, axle type, bushing pre-load, and pivot shape. Also, I am not so sure about the actual forces applied to the hanger as well the baseplate. For instance, what's the maximum load a truck has to withstand at a certain hanger size?

Unfortunately, I don't own a CNC nor do I have access to one where I can machine my own hangers, hence the design has to be spot on.

What material are you guys using?

[/quote]

In my simulations in Fusion 360 of static stress being mostly applied to the bushing seat at a 50-degree angle for simplicity. For 6061-T6 I needed at least 2000 Newtons where the steel axles start to have an issue in the safety factor value of 0.3. This is a hanger width of 12 inches without threaded axles. The weakest point will be the axles and the pivoting nose unless you hollow out the hanger to lighten it.

My current precision milled trucks are 2024-T3 aluminum. You can use 6061-T6 to defray cost while ensuring good strength.

Thanks, I'll go with 6061-T6 for the hanger and baseplate. Yeah, it seems like that the transition to pivot and axle stubs are the weakest points. Could you elaborate how you constrained your hanger in F360? A screenshot would be helpful!

For a second, I had to check my message inbox and saw you message me a while back about this. Hard to remember as time goes on. For constraints, I just clicked the faces of the axle and pivot nose as highlighted in blue. I went with fixed constraint. Please ignore the hexagon head of my axle, I used a grade 8 bolt to circumvent the weak point with using a threaded axle.

I'm definitely going to machine some trucks with an easily interfaceable hanger for motor mounts. I think this community can use more large rake, low angle trucks. Low angle high rake trucks are going to be amazing for staying stable but turning hard when need be.

For example, consider the Ronins (7mm rake, 45* baseplate) which remain extremely stable for downhill, but turn super sharp thanks to their divey nature.

I have a set of billet Ronin Katanas, purchase choice on rake for them was 0/2.5/5mm. My Aera K4 have 6mm (up from K3 3mm) although K5 was reduced to 5mm?. 

7mm is a lot... maybe ok on a really low angle rear truck?

Bit much for me. Maybe cast plates are different?

It is all personal preferance though. I have split the rake on my Katanas so my 25 degree rear has 5mm and doesn't feel like a bag of cement and my front 45 degree has 2.5mm. I feel it adds to split nature f/r stability but also puts a slight weight bias on the front truck helping stability in a straight line to a point but also in un-weighting the rear leaned over.

The more I think about it, if I was going to DIY a billet hangar I'd duplicate what Rogue have done with the insert bushing. Essentially it is a third bushing between the two tall barrels that takes the place of a spherical bushing. Design is dead easy as it is just a round hole in the hangar to suit the insert bushing that then sits flush with the bushing seat.

I know @michichopf is a big fan of the Rogues, I have not tried them but I like the simple solution to the complex problem of latteral hangar movement.

On a Ronin it is positive, A Aera can be flipped if you want, but the de rigueur of current DH set up is to reduce the truck angle especially in the rear to get stability and then run positive rake to get some turn/lean.

A product generation or so ago Kevin Reimer (former world DH champ) liked running a 50 degree front and a 48 degree rear baseplate that was a taller than std so he could flip his rear hangar to make the rear more stable. Lots of ways of getting the feel you are most comfortable with.

Generally now most think 48-42 degree trucks in front/rear for symetrical & 35-15 degrees in the rear (well that is what is available) for asymetrical set ups... 5mm of positive rake is common.

there is your design template kids, easier than a ronin to design, just make it a bit wider. Keep the hole in the hangar that is for the insert bushing and keep the large pivot as well that is also shouldering some of the lateral load.

Regarding Rogue inserts, you should size it the same as the precisions Rogues, not the cast so you can use the spherical if you want or RipTide Kore's for less vibration.  Here are the spherical dimensions you need to match, open the hanger hole a couple of thousandth to make it a slip fit, not a press fit!:  https://www.summitracing.com/parts/fkb-com6/overview/

Hmmm, so if I had to guess, these bushing inserts rogue is referring to is basically eliminating the shaft play between the hanger and the kingpin right? Basically gives you a more defined center point like a Ronin and eliminates the steppiness in your heel to toe/toe to heel side transitions huh? If so that's pretty ingenious.

well katanas and rogues isn't really a comparison.
Rogues are what like 80$ and katanas 450.- ?

The insert bushing isn't noticeable in reactionary ways. But negates slope and makes the bushing reaction more linear instead of snappy.

People keep bringing up Ronins. A problem with the Ronin design is for one, the custom parts, and two, its a much harsher ride than standard kingpins.

If anyone goes that route with a custom truck, I suggest looking at the Valkyrie Voxter trucks.
![voxxies2|690x468](upload://AaNAA4Ta6RaAh1fnnvT1Okx2Fb0.jpg)

Very similar concept as the Ronins, but replacing the expensive support pin with your bottom bushing.
No extra parts, a much more cushioned ride with almost all of the same functionality.

The hangar pivots from the pivot in the pivot cup. Because the two bushings are two different distances from the fixed pivot point as the hangar moves on that axis (of the pivot cup and kingpins) the travel (the compression of the two bushings) along the two kingpins will be different.

This will change the way the pre-load from the king pin nut works on the two bushings and how your weight works on them.

Ah, yes.

So normal RKP top bushing position experiences a lot more load because that distance from the bushing to the axle acts like a lever arm.

With the voxter arrangement the same bushing would feel harder, and would have less pre-load on it.
Its probably a pretty noticeable difference.

Here's some ideas based on a problem I've just run into

Adjustable baseplate in order to run on a tipped board - LaCroix, cool decks like this are going to be a thing in 2018 I think & like this but with an even more generous negative angle
https://www.sickboards.nl/en/precision-trucks/889-surf-rodz-adjustable-base.html

Machined hanger ring which can mimic the profile of other common hanger types.

Call the trucks 'Mimic' precision open-source trucks

I think you are lost dude, trying to push square pegs in round holes...

MTB's are for 0 degree trucks, hence the angled tips...

just because you can does not mean you should. Arch and his bro have built a purpose built deck, purpose built, use it as intended dude, it will be great!

You may be right but I'm going to try before I cry. It's largly irrelevant to what's going on here but the ability to be able to select a mount option is not, so...

**Edit:** Not point presenting a problem without a possible solution.

**Solution:** would be to use a solidaxle, prefereably Titantium, and to have interchangable profiles as desired. There are CAD models for most popular trucks, so should not present a challenge.

a) The profiles should lock into the main part of the hanger using a common arrangement of solid steel or titanium locking pins which stop roatation. 

b) Alternatively on the end of the profile and hanger have a star spline pattern (like a 12 point socket), alowing them to be rotated to desired angle, male on profile, female on hanger .....bonus & innovation

Not exactly related...
But I've always thought it would be really good to have 0 deg style trucks made with a 4 deg baseplate.

That way you could have +4 deg on the front, and then you mount the rear baseplate backwards, and you get -4 deg on the rear.

That'd be a nice turny yet stable setup.

Or you could do +4, +4 for super maneuverability.

Or -4, -4 for super stability.

I don't think you can turn at all with 0 +/- 4 degrees.  I may be wrong but in my experience you need a minimum of 30 degrees to turn at all and 30 doesn't turn well.

You're right, but I was meaning for mountainboard style decks where the angle is normally built into the board, and the trucks are typically 0 degrees.

The idea would be you have a little bit of flexibility instead of just being stuck with whatever the deck was pressed at or having to use risers.

Yeah @mmaner is right, you wouldn't change the angle of the wheels the deck would just rock to one side with out moving the wheels at 0 degree... :thinking:

I have 25 degree Ronin base plates I run in the rear of my gravity decks. 
Currently running:
Front: 95 cupped/95 cupped (tall barrels); 5mm rake; 45 degree; 165mm wide
Rear: 95 cupped/97 cupped (tall barrels); 2.5mm rake; **25 degree**; 155mm wide

They turn well enough for me to ride around town, do bank runs, 90 degree turns on to the foot path...

Ronins are more turny than a lot of other trucks because the unrestrictive bushing seats ( or lack of a bushing seats ), and the tall bushings.

They can lean really far without needing to be as loose.

You can pull off pretty low angles in the rear on any setup, but ronins can be particularly turny even into the low angles, especially compared with sloppy kingpin trucks running short bushings.
