Now that you're directly accessible here, @ChrisChaput where are all the flywheels?

I'm specifically looking for 90mm 75a or magical mystery reflex formula. None to be found. No 78a.

90mm, 97mm, 75a, 78a, reflex. I think Evolve and metroboards have some 97mm 75a at somewhat inflated prices, but generally so scarce.

We're junkies, please feed us.

I thought he was just drunk on the phone the other night and talking nonsense. I never imagined it was true. We really are that low on rainbow unicorn titties.

I will respond to this when I pick up more wheels this week and figure out where they're all going. Basically as soon as I get any in they're out the door (we're oversold) and I have to start waiting for the next run ... I'll need a shit-ton more of working capital until I can actually keep some on the shelves ...

If you need more capital why don't you take some paid in advance pre orders to help. I'm more than certain you would get a lot of orders from the people on this forum if you would sell directly to us. We are always doing group buys so paying in advanced is kind of normal. Of course if this fits your bussines model.

Totally! Specially if you made them with black cores and black thanes. Esk8 builders exclusive. :heart_eyes:

Hm so how much is a shit-ton? group buy range? :) Can we jump the line?

And while I'm asking and you're answering, :), what's the turnaround time on a run? IOW, how long between batches when the sell out everywhere?

Must be tough, expand the business and the risk, or force the clones to proliferate.

Group buy would be great. Captive audience with a ready made client list. 
I'll start the list. 
1 set of 107 superflys. UK/Eu (still just)

Yeah the translucent red is a sexy color. Such a shame they stopped that colorway.

working capital like the kind you would get if you allowed backorders of flywheels? Which would essentially be preorders... i love all the names you can give the scenario where you take somebody's money and don't give them anything until much later. PReorders, presales, kickstarter, backorders, build-to-order... I mean there's really no difference between a preorder and what i'm doing except every build is unique. 

shit do some pre-orders. 

rob some fucking kids of their lunch money. Lets rob some old ladies and sell their lincolns. knock over some liquor stores whatever it takes bro.
