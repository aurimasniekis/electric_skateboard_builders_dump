Currently "designing" some Boosted enclosures, the ones I found so far didn't fit my needs.

Could anyone that had a Bosted give me some measurements? 


All i need is the points i drew here:

![image|653x500](upload://zZkSzZIkmWaztuKh8pFHma2aOTF.jpg)

The vertical length and horizontal length like shown.
