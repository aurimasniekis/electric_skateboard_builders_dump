I think this has been covered before, but for everyone who is riding with out a helmet, what are your preferences? Is it helmet, jacket, gloves pads? Any good links for helmets?

This is going to sound silly. But i've been thinking about getting a motor bike armor jacket. Seem excessive, but using it in a crowded city with cars without protection scares me. I'm definitely getting a full face helmet though. :sweat_smile:

I'd imagine it'll be personal preference.

Take the risk? Go fully armored? Or maybe something in between.
I've been riding without any protective gear, besides the clothes on me. I was lucky enough to not hit my head the two times I fell, just got scraped up.

Need to get myself some protection.

I have one of these for a helmet:
http://triple8.com/product/dual-certified-brainsaver/

I feel that as long as you're not going 20+ all the time you can get away with just a helmet, pushing that speed or faster is time to start investing in a full face helmet and at the very least always wearing jeans and a light jacket, of course getting motorcycle gear is always a positive option.

For anyone out there that doesn't wear a helmet with an e-board. Stop being an idiot and start now. I didn't have a helmet a few months ago and over accelerated and fell off my board, straight into a light pole and nearly broke my face. It wasn't fun, I lucked out and didn't break anything but I still had a concussion and still had a CT scan to be safe. I wasn't even going that fast either.

Thanks for the link to the helmet @emepror. I'll be bookmarking it.
I have to wait for my next couple of paychecks before I can get to buying that.

I like the way it looks.

I think once I have the money as well I'll be buying that to replace my current helmet, ill be doing a lot more street riding soon and a better helmet is always a good option

Depends on your board.  My general rule is 20 mph and under with a very predictable/smooth throttle curve I usually wear a skate helmet or bike helmet, gloves of some sort, knee pads, and elbow pads.  

For something like a raptor that goes 28 mph I'd up the helmet to my predator DH6.  

For downhill longboarding (with a motor) or E boards that can go faster, I'd wear full leathers with protection in elbows, knees, and the predator dh6.  Full fingered gloves are a must as well.  Motorcycle armor is fine, but a lot of motorcycle racing suits are designed to be in that motorcycle tuck position which may not be comfortable on an E-board.  If you get good fitting motorcycle gloves though, you can use them with an e-board and a remote.

I have this helmet. http://triple8.com/product/dual-certified-brainsaver/ Runs small and I didn't like it at first, but the padding compresses after a couple rides and now I really like it.

The Pass is awesome, not made for 75 degree plus weather but if you're flying the entire time with shorts/tank tops on, it might be bearable. When I get the raptor best believe I'll have it on the entire time.

I also wear a Triple 8 Brainsaver. I have a big head, and the XL didn't fit, but found they also make an XXL. For some reason they don't advertise it. 

I also wear Triple 8 wrist guards and elbow pads when I ride. When it's cold out, I have the the Triple 8 gloves with built in guards. I picked up the fingerless version and just wear thin gloves underneath when it's really cold.

I wrecked a motorcycle in an icon leather, and not saying it was the jacket and pants that saved me when I hit the retaining wall and fell about 30 feet down into the canyon, but I climbed back out to pick up the pieces of my bike with only a bruise on my shoulder.

I have a TSG Pass helmet. Brand new but when I ride fast and there's wind, the wind sneaks under the face shield and makes a loud whistling sound. 
Have you ever experienced that? Do I need to tighten the shield?

Mine is brand new as well and I'm not that experienced with it.
But to now I haven't had any noise issues when riding. On a break as the wind came rough from my back direction, I had a whistle noise in some specific angles.
But nothing while going over 10 kph.

Hey, would anybody happen to know of a good protective skate jacket? I got a motorcycle jacket, it works but is way to short in length. It is meant to be comfortable when sitting on the bike, but just looks weird for skating.

I picked up one of these armor jackets from eBay, and I wear it under a thin neoprene type jacket and it's not really noticeable. Just looks like I've been working out a little more than usual (which is none.) Lol. I wore it around my wife and kids with my jacket zipped up when I first got it and they never realized I had it on. I haven't fallen to test it yet, but you can't beat it for the price. Just make sure to get 2-3 sizes larger than what you normally wear.

I have been thinking and researching protection. Been looking at roller hockey gear it's designed specifically for crashing into the concrete and the pads are perforated so they don't get to hot to wear.
I fell hard a few times when I was younger. My hip and elbows took most of the damage.
I don't even try use my hands to break my falls anymore.

[/quote]

20 is not a magic number. You sure as hell can get seriously hurt going slower than that. If you're riding in traffic you're also at the mercy of other people with massive amount of power(big cars and high speeds). And considering that a lot of people are texting while driving and sipping some starbucks I'd rather be safe than sorry.

I work 9 miles away from home and only drive on surface streets to and from work. Every single day I would stare at the bike lane that I could ride all the way to/from work along my route, occasionally start to swerve a little towards it. It's not texting and coffee that might kill them, it's envy. I can't ride to work because of a child I need to take to school. Enjoy your young esk8 lives kids

I can't be the only one who does this, I'm always checking that route for cracks and imperfections so when I ride it would be safer.

Amazon usually has some good deals on decent helmets
https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=downhill+longboard+helmet&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Adownhill+longboard+helmet 

Muirskate usually has some good stuff in their clearance section:

https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/clearance/all?keywords=helmet&sortby=newest&per_page=20#

(That is where I got my Predator DH6.)

I also just got some of these pads
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GG7AYLG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 

And these gloves, 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NIR0Y80/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 
which I am going to turn into slide gloves, whenever I can find some Corian samples.

I have been thinking about getting some type of motorcycle hoodie or jacket, but I haven't seen any I liked enough to spend that kinda money in it yet.

I want to get some of these:

Because when I fall hard it always impacts my hips, but I am not sure how I will wear them under my pants, because I don't typically wear baggy clothing. Not a comfort based decision so much as me not wanting to have to buy pants just ao I can wear these funny underwear.

I think so. I think they're sized for Chinese people or just wrong. I normally wear a medium and got an XL, and I wouldn't want it any smaller or tighter. I guess that's what you get when something is "MAIN IN CHNA" :confused: Wow.

Try wearing a kilt when you ride if you want extra attention ;)

That also gives you the benefit of not having pantlegs to worry about getting torn if you fall.

Oh, and it's seriously comfy on a warm day, trust me ;)

Well Fuck, didn't realise it was 2 years old lol. 

Anyone else tried these motorbike armoured jackets? I can't decide between this and a kevlar hoodie with back, shoulders and spine pads. This seems a lot more protective, but the hoodie seems much more casual. What do you guys think? Kinda on a budget too but protection is still the main priority

Should provide enough protection for our purposes.

However I find it a little too conspicuous for me.

I wear a Dainese motorcycle summer jacket (Dainese Air Flux D1) however it is over your budget.

My guess is if you don't mind the looks, it will serve you well.
