Trying to gauge interest in a mount for Cast Ronin trucks.  They will be made out of 6061 and most likely anodized black.  Mock ups are almost finished and I should be getting the prototype this week.  The mount will work both front or rear and although I don't have a 15mm or a 9mm belt, I do believe it will fit, but I will confirm.  I have tested it with a 12mm TB 16/36 setup and it is perfect.

If you are interested, let me know how many you are interested in.  I'm working on pricing now, it should run normal mount pricing give or take.

What's the advantage of 7075 over 6061 in tis application? From what i've read its stronger, but corrodes more easily and is more expensive.

## \#15 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-09-21T14:01:49.375Z Reads: 211

I've read some people using 6061 have had their motor mounts bend, especially at thinner widths. I'd feel more comfortable using 7075 as it nearly doubles in tensile strength.
```

## \#16 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-09-21T14:34:09.782Z Reads: 215

I've seen a lot of that too with aluminum motor mounting plates, so using 7075 on the plates definitely makes more sense if the tensile strength really is approaching that of steel as I seem to be reading. 

on half inch thick hanger clamps though, 6061 is plenty. So maybe a hybrid approach could be taken if its a two piece clamp system to keep cost down a little. 

I'm new to all this aluminology so to speak lol

I personally don't mind spending a little more for strong mounts, but i can see the appeal in waiting a durable, yet cheap mounting solution. This is probably why torqueboards mounts are so pricey as they are 7075.

```
The 7075 is a better option, the alloy is slightly different than 6061.  The 6061 will hold up to a vertical stress of the motor bouncing up and down with ordinary riding, but where the 7075 shines is the lateral stresses.  Even tightening a belt will stress the mount laterally pulling it towards the wheel side, add that to the possibility of hit, the mount can bend at the clamping edge.  You can see where it was built up to help minimize the lateral stresses.

Running a 280mm belt you are getting 1.5" ground clearance either side (front or back mount) which is about even with the hanger.  Mount will be $50 + Shipping which is $7 flat rate.  All hardware included.

Mount will be 7075 Aluminum, Anodized flat black, no clear coat.  This mount will work with the standard 32mm bolt pattern standard to a 63mm motor.  If you have a specific bolt pattern request, let me know.

I am working on the axle price now.

Looks good.  What are the set screws on the motor side for?  Belt tension?

Now that we have a final CTC distance, we can extend the beveling from the clamp to the motor, something more like your drawing.  The motor bolts slots will be broken into four segments like you have for strength reasons.  Two long tracks makes machining extremely easy, but you loose strength.

The screws are to protect the aluminum from the ground and to be able to stand it up from the motor side. The CTC I think is needed is from 74-80mm. what CTC distance you thinking? Don't forget to test while leaning on the board because if motor touches the truck while riding you might not have a good day.

If it is machined, can we also have counter sunk holes for attaching motors like DIY/TB's V4 mounts have. That way you can get the drive pulley really close to the mount itself

You should make the clamp that fits onto the truck a two bolt system like enertions mount. With a single bolt system you have to tighten the clamp extremely hard and 7075 doesn't do that to well. I've had major issues with tb mounts slipping because of this. A two piece system can be tightened way more without any added stresses to the metal.

The people dealing with ronins likely care more about performance. In my opinion a mount that slips and is cheap isn't worth a dime.

Let me put it this way. I have 2 torqueboard v4 mounts, both of which I cannot use. They simply vibrate out of place after a few rides. I've put rubber tubing between the trucks and the clamp, I've jb welded the side, I've replaced the bolts to be able to tighten them more, nothing works. Do not use this clamp design, for people that live in an area with shitty roads they will move around and be junk. Just cut an extra hole and save everyone a world of pain.

I wonder if the stock axel is longer than when reviewed in '13

you just hammer it out to one side! if you arent careful and tighten down the wrong one wheelside without the other sides wheel attached, you actually might just pull out the steel axle!

i dont know why you would need a longer axle except for these evolve/enertion kind of pulleys. my stock axle is great and the narrower the axle, the better your grip!

can you hammer the axel out of a caliber too? I know that inside the aluminum the axel is textured, but after chopping so many i've found that they're not glued or anything.

With the spline there will be no rotation, unless of course you bash it and break the mechanical joint.  Lateral will not be an issue at all.  The surface area has increased exponentially, that coupled with the clamp you couldn't move it with a 12lb sledge.

@Eboostin Trying to make progress, but me and my guy are like ships passing in the night.  I did get a print for the 280mm belt and it fits perfect.  You get about 1.25" clearance mounted to the front and 1.5" to the rear.  Please pay no attention to the loose belt, when its adjusted properly it pulls the mount out of square.

On a separate note, the spline idea most likely isnt going to work out.  The clamping of the bushing and mount together will throw off the alignment of the spline.  Its still most likely going to have to be two grub screws on the clamp pushing in opposite directions on the bushing.

Im waiting on a call from him to get the actual aluminum prototype to test out.

Thank you!  I'm getting excited, i just placed an order for a Loaded Poke.

I spoke to the machinist, he is leaving for a week long vacation Saturday but is squeezing in a 6061 prototype for me.  The final product will be out of 7075 and will take almost 6 hours on the CNC, the material is very hard, the bulk of the time will be hogging out and contouring the bushing, but we have an idea for that.  For testing purpose, 6061 will be just fine.

It's getting close!

Added from the other thread:

I'm in for a pair myself - so 2x mounts & 2x axles. If there are more EU people then happy to organise group postage from the UK. Also like the black anodised idea - bling not my thing :wink:

Hey, on second look, I'm thinking that the mount shouldn't be taken in leading away from the truck. Visually it looks nice but I'd prefer to have the strength

Also, do you or anyone else have a desire for a motor pulley cover? Probably easiest and lightest to do out of black plastic.

With the 7075 its overkill already, there really isn't a need.  Look at a pyschotiller or TB mount, they hold up fine, but with that two piece design (which was my first idea), according to the stress tests the point of failure is where the arm meets the clamp.  We took care of that with the long beveling of the arm to the clamp.  There are also two grub screws that will additionally pull the clamping surface tighter to the bushing.

Im trying not to think about it, I cant wait to have the prototype in my hand.  Im like a kid the night before Christmas.  Loaded Poke and new VESC coming tomorrow, just finished my 12s 100a BMS and flat 12s Lipo pack, and fingers crossed the mount will be ready.

could you show us a few closeups on the cronin truck adapter? Im still curious how running 9, 12 and 15mm with one adapter works. is the adapter wider than the motor mount so that the motor mount can be shifted up to 6mm to work with all the different belt widths (basically like my tube solution, thats also 2cm wide).

also, whats the inner diameter of the motor mount clamp now?

Sure, I will put them up tonight.  The clamp rides back and forth on the bushing with enough clearance for the larger pulley.  So yes, the bushing is wider than the clamp and like your tube solution.

I'll check the bushing tonight for you.  It was originally 30mm but I believe it changed slightly.

@whitepony  Here you go, hope the pics help.  The piece of paper is 15mm wide.  There is still a little meat left on the inside of the bushing.  I dont have 15mm parts or I would gladly try them out.

Tried a Ronin on the front and wow it finally tames the sometimes sketchy tracking at speed while crossing a road seam of my Paris V2's.

Much nicer turning and smaller radius while still being stable at speed. Feels a lot safer because it just tracks solid.

Excited to see how the rear Ronin will improve it more.

If you have torqueboards old motor mount or APS motor mount you can make an adapter using whitepony's method. It gives you the best alignment and it's strong.
