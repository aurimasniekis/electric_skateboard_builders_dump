bigger does not necessarily mean better in this case. you will be much happier if you spend a little more to get the right pulley instead of having to buy a couple cheaper ones to find one that will work.

if you already bought a pulley why do you need another one?

how are you planning on attaching that to the wheel? if you dont have access to a drill press or are not very good with just a normal drill its going to be a pain in the ass. also it has an 8mm bore, you're going to need to drill that out a good amout with a massive drill bit. 

Honestly i would say buy a 12mm drive pulley kit from enertion. its a little bit more but it will actually work.

This should work in the motor? http://www.ebay.com/itm/HTD-5M-15T-21W-5-6-6-35-8-10mm-Bore-Pitch-5mm-Timing-Belt-Drive-Pulley-15-Tooth-/252402870141?var=&hash=item3ac462277d:m:mAYkYFrbSLRTga8QCouo7zQ

15 teeth and 10mm

no. that is 25mm wide, that is freaking massive. 

plus that is a 10mm bore, you said in another comment you got [this motor?](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-5065-fr-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-270kv-2000w/) That has a 8mm shaft so that pulley wont work for that reason also.

on top of that 15t motor 30t drive wheel is not a great setup and i would be amazed if the motor would be powerful enough for that.

Please, do some more research before you buy things. and when it comes to the drive system. unless you want to make it yourself and are confident in you DIY abilities. just pay a little more and buy a premade system from diyelectricskateboards.com or enertion.

if its single motor i would suggest the 12mm drive kit.

**NOTE: you have to have wheels that have the plastic on the inside that look like this:**

if your wheels dont have that then you need to get different wheels. you can get abec clones on ebay pretty cheap:
