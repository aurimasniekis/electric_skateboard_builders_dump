I'm looking for those old enertion motor mount plans. Seems like they moved away from being a parts provider :( but if any one has those files lying around that'd be great. Watched a video where they referenced that their open source plans were good for building your own mounts only to be disappointed..

Not sure if that drive link is working so here's another just in case that I uploaded to my android file host account.
