Hey guys,
I'm selling some parts of my board cause after buying I changed my mind and want to build a hub-board, everything is in best condition.
So I'm selling:
Benchwheel Remote controller + double engine receiver (never used before)
Enertion- 2x wheels incl. 2xpullys + 4x belts.
Just make me an offer :)

the wheel pulleys are only sold together with the wheels, if you want you can have the other two wheels as well :)
