I am looking into outsourcing high quality 4 ply carbon fiber enclosures in a universal layout (12s 21700 with discharge BMS and any dual VESC) to a company that makes the front ends of BMW cars and deep sea wind turbine blades...I think I can sell them for $80 with shipping in the US as long as I can get around 50 of them.

They will be baked pressed and together using industrial machines rather than vacuum bagging and setting at room temperature as for a super strong bond that should take all the abuse imaginable.  They will have a matte finish by default so they can be skinned/painted/polished to look however you want.  I will trim all the edges and pre-drill mounting holes in a jig so they will all align perfectly.

Prior to designing the enclosure molds and contracting the manufacturers, I need to know if there is enough demand.  Would you buy one?  Do not answer again if you answered on the other forum.
