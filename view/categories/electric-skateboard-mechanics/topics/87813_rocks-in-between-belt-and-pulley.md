Might be a dumb question, but need to know before going out and buying parts. Has anyone ever had a rock Come in between their belt and pulley?

Its not a big issue, it causes more wear on the belts and can dent plastic pulleys but I wouldn't worry unless you plan to drive through fine gravel all the time

Very rarely do I encounter that problem and usually you can tell. You just need to get the debris out and change a belt worst case scenario. I always bring spare belts with me on rides.

Happens to me every now and then. Small rocks can get wedged inside the belt! On in the teeth of a pulley. Does not break anything but for sure shortens the belts life. 

Might make a weird noise but will not lock a wheel, least has not for me. Just stop and pick it out.

My latest build picks up rocks like they're supposed to be in there. Some days none. Some days every mile or so. It's been a fight. But a worthy fight. Haven't gotten a rock stuck in two days now! <knocks on wood>
