I know that there has been a debate between steel and ceramic bearings for a while, but I have wondered how it effects the esk8 world as well. I am currently considering buying some ceramic bearings for my DIY board, especially after taking a look at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2KCs_lBKWU
I was wondering though, do you guys have any thoughts? Is the extra money for ceramic worth it?

I have been a big fan of bones reds for a long time now, they are great bearings, they don't last forever, but are fully serviceable and cheap to replace..

however recently a mate of mine got some amphetamine ceramics on his board and I have got to say that I am impressed.
they roll very smooth and fast and have had no maintenance at all. 
if you are doing kick flips and large drops that will destroy bearings then I would probably go reds, but if you are not dropping 20 sets then ceramics will probably suit you better and roll smoother longer.

What i think ,... I think it's a total scam what Skate Shops charge for bearings !!

Save your money, don't even buy Bearing at a Skate shop , buy them directly online. 

I had bought Abec11 built-in bearings for around $40.00  now 2-3 don"t run well after just a few months ??

Just bought these (6 ball) bearings for 30 cents each , yes 30 cents each , got 24 for 7 dollars!! .  i'm pretty sure they are just as good of not better with there 6 bigger balls rather than 7 smaller ones .

I do agree that skate board rated bearings are full of shit and marketing. But i do have a soft side for those that have an intergrated bushing, just seems so convenient.

I noticed the difference between regular ABEC 5-7-9-11 and Ceramic bearings.

On my non-electric one, I have this ones https://www.amazon.com/Sector-Black-Ball-Ceramic-Bearings/dp/B003EKNMTE and they spin forever . You just have to be careful with huge drops because they are really fragile

Ceramics are the best, hands down. They don't rust like steel balled bearings. I have had the same pair bone Swiss Ceramics on my regular board, and they have lasted 4 years of high impacts, and high speeds. I used to get a month tops out of reds. Swiss ceramic are the best. They'll cost you a fortune, but you don't need to clean them and they last a very long time, even with daily abuse. They still spin as fast as the day I bought them.

Zealous bearings are great because of their built in spacer, and their nanoceramic lubricant which helps protect against corrosion.
If not getting Zealous I get my bearings from VXB.com
the price you pay there goes towards the product, not marketing hype. I've bought in bulk there and they're great.

I'd suggest Oust bearings. There isn't a lot of hype surrounding them, but they are the only 608 style bearing that is purpose built for the rigors of skating. I use the MOC9 AIRR, but the other ones in the lineup are probably just fine. MOC stands for "Machined Optimum Clearance". Just a little oil every so often and they keep rolling strong...Check em' out.

I usually go about once a week and check out my bearings and bushings. Sometimes, two weeks. Depends on how much ride time you put in. The buna seals keep the lube in really well, so it's usually not an issue.

Ive got about 500 miles on my Bones Super Reds bearings since I last cleaned them and no signs of oxidation and they still roll for ever. Stock oil that came with the bearings caused them to get gunked up really quick, I cleaned them with alcohol and lubed them with Remmington teflon gun oil and they spin super fast the lube sticks to the metal and doesn't wash out with water easily. 

I've tested the oil on a 9mm pistol that fired 13 rounds underwater, when the gun was taken apart I found oil still on the slide rails the barrel and the trigger group. I was very impressed and find it works amazing for bearings.

This Glidex II stuff is the fastest/best lube I have ever used.

>**Glide more with Glidex**
S7-405 Glidex and S7-426 GlidexII is a new synthetic lubricant used by the U.S. military and Canadian Air Force in their high speed turbines. These oils are designed for high temperature, and ultra high RPM, yet maintain a very high film strength. 
Glidex -S7-405 is very light in viscosity, and works wonders on ball bearings, S7-426 GlidexII is the same compound as Glidex except it has additives to increase it's viscosity and work it's magic on oilite bushings, specially Slick 7 bushings which are so temperamental on what lubricant you use.. no question now --- GLIDEX II

That said I have some bones speed cream I use on my bones ceramics, but it is slower and breaks down faster being organic. But my bearing seem to last forever, yet to throw a set of swiss ceramics out :exploding_head:

I know evoheyax has a set that is like 10 years old too...

Ok here's the deal with bearings and Eskate.

Bearings in general... Don't matter that much through all disciplines of skating.
I mean, they matter. But they're all 95% the same. And the cheap Chinese vbx bearings you can buy by the hundreds aren't really going to be distinguishable from bones swiss without taking them off and reading the shields.

Most of the differences are invented to create marketing hype.

One such difference is free spin. Free spin may matter in a teeny tiny minority of incidences but one instance where it 100% does not matter is when you have a motor attached to your board doing the work for you.

Lots of skate specific bearings come with oil and thats to give them lower rolling resistance, because we've been become accustomed to think that is what feels better.

Eskate you don't want that. 
It is SO easy to heap on tons of miles on an eskate that a normal skater will never see. So basically the only purchase consideration for eskate builders, apart from cost, should be durability and longevity.

As far a ceramic is concerned, that difference is a matter of performance.
Performance that is completely non-applicable when you've got a motor.
And as far as I'm aware there is no lifetime or durability benefits to ceramic.


What you're probably going to want to focus on instead is the bearing Lube.
Lube is what keeps the bearing working, free of rust, free of wear, and its the thing that will keep your bearing rolling for many miles.

Oil gives lower rolling resistance, at the cost of not being as good at protecting the bearings, being more susceptible to washout, and needing to be replaced semi-frequently.

What you want is aluminum complex greases, mostly for their incredibly high water resistance.
Water damages the bearings directly by rust, but it can also wash out your lube causing them to go bad through wear.

We are not accustomed to think it is better, it is. With less rolling resistance you go further with any given energy input.

It sounds like you are lazy. If you are happy to sacrifice performance for reduced maintenance then just use sealed bearings?

Yes there is, they don't rust & require less lube. So practically their serviceable life is much longer. For another opinion @evoheyax how old is your set of ceramic bearings bro?

These are the ones I use on my non-epowered icarus. 

Switched to ceramic a while back after I got tired of cleaning my bearings after every wet ride. 
Even though these are still ceramic/steel hybrid, I can still confirm that they have survived more puddles than any other bones set. Only bought one set of these ceramics back in November and they're still fresh.

I've got cheap bearings that are 10 years old.
And I ride them in the rain.

In a general sense, yeah, you'r right. 
But its not like expensive bearings never rust, and cheap bearings always rust.

If treated right, neither should rust. 

If mistreated they'll both rust.

[quote="Cobber, post:19, topic:6301"]

[/quote]

But the difference in force is insanely small, like micrograms.
It can be noticeable at slow speed, slow incline where there is virtually zero air resistance.

So some instances in park skating where you might be doing a lot of flatland coasting, probably LDP, flatland dancing perhaps.

But here? No.

Don't believe me? Swap out your fast bearing for slow ones, see if it affect your range.

Technically true, but is it an appreciable difference?
Is it large enough to measure?

I don't mean to say they don't.
But so few people are buying ceramics, there's a lot less data, a lot less consensus,
Ceramic bearings have been used in cycling a lot more, and I didn't find anybody touting longevity.
I hear more about the lighter weight. 
You're doing some pretty performance optimization if you're looking at the balls in you're bearing and going "Huh, thats adding to my weight. I should do something about that"

This is all true, bearing don't really matter for eskate ... except they do.  But they matter in ways you don't think at first.  You need ceramic bearings because brine doesn't rust them out.  Other than that, rolling resistance and all that marketing jazz, doesn't really matter.  When it snows and they throw salt all over the road, then you better be running full ceramic.  Other than that, bearings don't matter at all.

Like if you grab your wheel and can wiggle it a little bit even when the wheel it tight down.

All bearings have some tolerance, so it takes a little bit of experience to know how much to expect from good bearings.
Also, you have to realize that for different applications some slop is fine. But going really really fast isn't one of them. That is not when you want any possibility for things to go wrong.

But...
I noticed he rides Aera k4's, If anyone wants to buy a set I have some black on black 176mm 50/50. Super light weight, great for spinny loop-de-loop thingies!

hi guys, I've been reading the different opinions on the ceramic bearings. I've been running a pair of Swiss ceramics on my Loaded Dervish for about 6 summers now, most recently with the O'tang Kegels and it's such an awesome board to commute on. I'm from Montreal, so the streets are less than ideal and it rains 3 times a day in the summer. I've been cleaning them once or twice per season, they have a bit of play now and they became a bit louder but they still roll for a really long time! 

My question is, are there ceramic bearings for 12mm axels? I'm waiting on the LaCroix board and I wasn't able to find any info on 12 - 28 mm ceramic bearings. I've found some industrial ones full ceramic but not for skating purposes. Is anybody here running ceramic bearings on bigger wheels/axles ?

So if I understand, the inner diameter of the bearings for the MBS matrix II trucks would be 12mm and the outer diameter would be 28mm for the Rockstar II hubs. I wasn't able to find any info about the depth, is it 8mm? So therefore would the bearing be a 12x28x8? I wasn't able to find any sealed ceramics for that size. Sorry i'm still very new to this.

Hence why its so surprising to hear of people actually running full ceramic.

What you can do to get at least hybrid ceramic is measure the ball size in your MBS bearings, and if you're lucky you'll be able to purchase ceramic balls that size on Ebay or somewhere.

This is something people figured out for 8mm bearings, so it should be possible for larger bearings as well.

Who makes ceramic with integrated spacer at a reasonable price? I can't live without that "extended inner race". 

Currently using these "race reds" integrated with spacer. Packed with a heavy automotive grease. Year and half use with lots of heavy rain use and still smooth.

Zealous Ceramics have built-in spacers, set it and forget it maintenance and cost half the price of their competitors - what’s not to love? :slight_smile: http://www.zealouslongboards.com/shop/zealous-ceramic-bearings/ 

For steel, i think it’s hard to beat a Loaded Jehu V2 (also has built-in spacers) in their Kegel; feels perfect every time.  Zealous Green, again. 

For old-school boardwalk duty, hands-down, SAN-O by Hamboards.  Clicky, smell like grease, so perfect.

 Good hunting!

Zealous makes them for under 30.  I bought bones for my first board and havent used them since for the money the quality is not what it used to be.  Also most bearings that have an abec rating on it is just a plain lie generally they will be abec 1 if you are lucky abec 3.  Chinese bearing makers will put anything on them you want.

Most DH riders I know ride on whatever bearings are cheapest for them. They could care less as long as the bearings are new/clean.A new set of bearings it the only way to guarantee the bearing won't seize on you and lock up your wheels.

I always used all first line from SKF, rubber sealed 2RS, I’m on my second board with the same set of bearings, never cleaned, never opened and roll like new

For me it makes no sense to use skate “brand” bearings instead of a company that been developing and improving for decades and is used in all fields of industry, be it NSK, SKF, FAG, Nachi

Obviously they don’t roll like skate bearing, that because the grease is actually dimensioned for the load they are rated, instead of using a oil to make them spin faster, but probably wearing much more

We all have our reasons for bearings. This is gonna be a never ending debate.

I've had
- steel bearings, cages blow out
- ceramic bearings balls explode
- rusted races on both cermic and steel

Other
- I don't run integrated spacers. I dislike them
- I only run bearings with double bunas
- I'll skate in a drizzle but not a rain
- I don't like lithium or any greases. I like my bearings fast as f***
- I clean my bearings literally every 150 miles.

So for me, this means. I have the option of 
- ceramics without integrated spacers, but I like my bearings fast. Any bit of rust on the races with oil based lube and I've had balls explode
- steel, see below

Really I only know of two bearing brands that meet my criteria.
- double bunas seals
- non ceramic, so balls don't explode
- I run oil based lube because I like fast
- no integrated spacers
- good tolerances

This pretty much narrows it to OUST MOC 5,7, or 9, or Bronson G2 or G3.

OUST bearings have super tight tolerances, and each revisions higher (7 over 5, or 9 over 7) the polish of the races is finer. While this is nice and all for a DH and some super speed, the tolerances are too tight and as soon as you do any sliding, good luck not blowing your ball cages with such tight tolerances.

Bronson's, little looser tolerances, steel, double bunas, no integrated spacers,fast as fuck, even thier slogan is "fast as fuck". 

If you know of another double buna, non integrated spacer, steel, with good tolerances. I'm all ears, show me the way. But this whole debate is really going to be rider dependent.

I've actually purchased x2 sets of ceramic bearings in the last year or so, both turned to crap in a matter of days.  I don't know why.  I had a set of amphetamines that multiple balls cracked in, and a set of bones ceramic that weirdly a couple of the balls powdered.  

I've stuck with mid-grade bearings since then as I personally have better luck, lifetime wise, with them.

DH about 40mph, hit a large rock, few hundred feet later my rear right wheel started wobbling,  did a shutdown to try to keep the wheel on. When I inspected it, the bearing cages we're still intact, lost the outer seal, and a couple balls that looked like disintegrated sand. 

I won't run them again. I'd rather clean steel every day then come close to a bail like that. I can't account for every rock on the road. But I do expect my bearings to not shit on me because of a hard impact.

Same reason I won't run OUST anymore.. bearing cages fell apart while sliding because the tolerances are too tight. Like I said not trying to fuel the debate. But everyone is gonna have different experiences with bearings.

For another opinion @evoheyax how old is your set of ceramic bearings bro?
[/quote]

Well I can't say much since I have been out of street skating since I torn my ankle up last year in the enertion raptor 2 tour. But before hand, over 2 years of hard, high impact (I skated a lot of 10 stair sized rails, hubas, ect.) with bones swiss ceramics. I used to get a few weeks at best from the cheap bearings. Being in San Francisco, it means a lot of hill bombing. The cheap bearings just don't hold up at high speed, ate shit many times cause a bearing broke while bombing hills. There's a reason why the pros don't ride cheap bearings.

Cheap bearings are not the same as swiss ceramics. They have required zero maintenance, while the cheap bearings need it within a week of hard skating.

Now granted, theres no high impact on electric skateboards, but rolling resistance is important for range and last thing you want at 30 mph is to have a bearing break. Swiss ceramics won't break for a very long time. The other stuff, it just doesn't hold up.

Interestingy enough I was texting back and forth with the pro downhiller friend of mine about this very subject. Our discussion was about a world record attempt board and what bearing to run on it. He stated that 10mm bearings were ancient technology and phased out in longboarding long time ago. I also inquired about as to what precision bearing he prefered to run, his answer was short. "Anything will work."   The truth is is precision bearings this day and age are top-of-the-line As Good As It Gets. Branded bearings are just exactly what they are branded to get your extra dollars. It gives you a placebo effect and makes you think you're getting something special.

10mm were phased out because they were less convenient/less available, not because they were outdated in some way. People didn't want to have to deal with multiple sizes of bearings.

They've got more balls, and of a smaller size.
IME that makes feel a little more tolerant, and last a little bit longer.

But they're such a pain to get, and the selection is so limited.

I have 4 boards I ride regularly, 3 have swiss ceramics that I ride in the rain, they get the most miles and my trampa running some japanese steel bearings. Roughly each season I strip and clean them all. Strip and clean my trucks, ronins, pivots... I get about 3 weeks a board of daily use before a strip and clean. 

steel bearing in winter don't work for daily abuse.

strip and clean means a triple wash in solvent through my heated ultrasonic bath, dry & re-lube.

edit: for dry running just replacing steel bearings works, but if you ride everyday in winter/water... you can't change bearings every day so the ceramics for me have started to work. Plus now I live on a island by the sea so corrosion is increased...

The last set of Ceramics i had (Zealous Ceramics) ended up grenading on me after riding them through rain a handful of times. That was while I was attempting a standard downhill bomb in my (then)  regular commute. The ceramic balls won't rust (though they do disintegrate like sand), but the steel track and races in a ceramic bearing do. Lesson learned? I don't trust wet/dirty bearings. Regardless. I already have too much shit to worry about failing and causing a wheel lockup. I don't need to also worry about my bearings every time I decide to push my board hard..

I've been using Bones Reds Racers but i'm up or anything better and less expensive. Or at least on par but less expensive. 

I've just always used Bones bearings. I hear Zealous are great too. 

Rain and brine is shit for more than just wheel bearings. It will fuck up ALL your bearings eventually. Motor bearings, pulley bearings, and not to mention rust your hardware. I get boards back for maintenance sometimes that are covered in corrosion from salt and other bullshit. Fucked up looking truck bolts, kingpin nuts if crusties, bushings with asphalt grime in them.. gross. 

It makes me angry. Clean your fucking boards before you send them in. Shit, you should be cleaning them every night when you get off the street. Just wipe the shit down a little. 

I'll bet you motherfuckers brush your teeth before you go to the dentist. Why wouldn't you wipe your board down before i have to sample your localness all over my bench? Yuk.

I used to exclusively use Muir bearings simply because I wanted to support the shop as much as I can. Bearing performance is all pretty much the same, so my decision making at the time was that I wanted to support whichever brand I felt deserved my business the most. For other components like wheels and trucks, that obviously isn't the case since the performance range is so wide. However for bearings, it really doesn't matter at all...

I'd be really curious to find out if they're breaking from the harsh forces of riding, or if it might be from something else, like say debris tat gets caught between the ball and the raceway causing the balls to get crushed.

The latter would still be a failure on a steel bearing, just not as catastrophic.
