I am cuurently building on a second hand mountainboard i bought and the tyres are somewhat wore off. So i am thingking on replacing them
 But i have found Out they have horrible traction, especially the ones with motors. I mainly do offroading and the tyres are better at digging than pushing. I found this tyres

 wich look like they have nice offroad traction so i was wondering ir anyone has tried them or can recomendad something else with nice traction
Thank you very much

I've got similar tread tires - primo strikers.. they also have ''flat'' middle section and some ''grooves/ teeth'' at the sides.. they work okay on hard packed roads.. but they struggled on the snow (single drive)..

I assume for pure off-road, perhaps, ''knobby'' tires would be the ones to go after.. though let's wait for someone else to step in.. just thought to help out with pushing your thread in the front :D

Check uk mountainboard sites. Trampa and atbshop should be your options
