Actually I was willing to create my first own scate board for uneven surface and I am confused about the diameter should I keep for the wheel.I have doubts about the motor also which should I choose an hub motor or an belt drive motor .as I have heard of heat issues from the hub motor .And from where should I buy them for good price.
