Hi Guys-

Just looking for some jedis to run their eyes over this before i begin vesc tool setup...

Im a complete noob

First build so be kind

Trampa board
3D printed VESC enclosure

2 x Turnigy Graphene Panther 5000mAh 6S 75C Battery Pack (in Series)
2 x Turnigy Esk8 190kv motors

15t Motor Pulley
15mm HTD belts
Antispark (@eLDoska) and switch + Loop key (overkill i know)
Flipsky vx1 remote

A couple of major major questions i want to know is-

What to i put in for the vesc tool for battery details
Am i correct that this is 12s2p?...or is it 12s1p?..... 10mAH

Also- Im going to be running BDLC.... what figures do i put in for 
Motor Max? 
Motor Min (regen)?

Upon charging my batteries.....what is the ideal amperage i want to set the charger too?
