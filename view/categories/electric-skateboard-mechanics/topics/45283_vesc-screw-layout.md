Hello guys!

Can anyone help me out with the VESC screw layout? I'm using the maytech version, but I don't have the means to measure it right now. I need the pcb dimensions too if possible.
Thanks for the help!

I think it’s just the standard vesc 4.12 hw. Look on GitHub or Ben’s website for the open source vesc pcb layout

I meant that the reason is not for the lack of tools, but because I do not have access to my VESC at this time, but I need the dimension because I'm designing the electrics box.

I couldn't find anything with actual screw layout or board sizes. All I can find are plain 3d rendering, and circuit drawings :/

That was a bit rude.  I honestly think he understood you didn't have the tools to measure and was trying to help

No prob. Maybe I exaggerated my understanding of what you wrote. 
However I have been looking around and haven't been able to find a diagram with the measurements.  But if you are designing maybe you can look for a 3d model of a case for your vesc and measure in the 3d model
