Hi Guys!

I've started a thread for this since i've now found any that is relative to the other abec 11 107mm wheels.
I'm looking for pulleys to 3D print and those I find is for the other 107mm wheels.

Dose someone have any suggestions? Im looking for 36T 15mm or 12mm

The same pulleys that fit 90mm & 97mm fit 107mm, its the core that matters and its the same.

Those are the Electric Flywheels, not the SuperFly wheels

Not be confused with Flywheels or Refly wheels
