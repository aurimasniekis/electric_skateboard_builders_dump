Hi everyone! 
I am trying to decide what I want for my next build and a friend gave me this for free:

http://www.powerkiteshop.com/boards/scrubvapour.htm

Do you know any decent priced motor mount I can use with it? I do not want to do any custom work or CNC but rather just buy the motor mount  and focus on the electrical part of the the build, and I am not sure if I can that with this board.

I am thinking dual modual of course. I want to use it as hybrid Street / grass to ride inside parks etc...
