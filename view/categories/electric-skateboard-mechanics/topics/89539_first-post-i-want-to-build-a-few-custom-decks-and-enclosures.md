Hello, 
Vince here. PushmorelongboardsLLC. I have a few posts on IG if you want to look at what I do. oregoncncservices on IG too. 

Thank you for reading my post.

I want to make a short run of custom eskate decks with matching enclosures that would be attractive to the do it yourselfer. Any ideas? I now this wide a open subject. I'm wonder what price point would be acceptable and what is actually needed in the way of decks. If anything. I have designed and created hundreds of longboard and skateboard molds. I've pressed lots of decks.  Handy with composites, vacuum infusion/bagging, vacuum forming etc. I asking for input on what's needed in the world of eSk8.

I would like to make a mild drop deck, maple/fg composite. Routed compartment with matching enclosure. What would you like to see?

I have enough maple laying around for 20 to 30 decks, lots of tri, bi uni, & e glass and a desire to make & learn something new. 

I added a pic of a couple downhill decks I made a while back and a mold or 2.

What I really want is something like a switch 40 but with larger radius at the neck and less lateral recurve so you get a cleaner profile and more mounting space

You are going to be getting a whole long list of peoples ‚Äúwants‚Äù when it comes to decks!

The big thing that people have really flocked to is the first thing you talked about. Mild drops, battery cut out and matching enclosure.

Shape and size is all over the place here. Some people want an aggressive shaped mid 30s kick when others want a super long and low 44in!

I would love to talk to ou about your CNC services though! Aspiring deck builder here and my biggest hold up right now is getting my step file converted to CAM to go get it cut out. Looks like our mold blocks are similar so the process should be close.

I see you're in hillsboro. I'm in Portland! One thing that would be pretty cool is if you could make a nice kicktail board and integrated wood enclosure like the Hoyt St boyz do.

I'm not sure yet on the price, I want to do affordable and a good value at your end. It has to balanced with worth while to do at my end. I'm not looking to get rich or even turn a huge profit. I do lots of commercial cnc routing for locals. I produce everything from concrete forms to musical instrument parts. I use the skate stuff as filler work. I really enjoy doing it. It's a bit more creative and I like all the steps involved. I grew up in the foothills of Pasadena, CA during the 70's. So just about anything skate and or BMX related is my "fun zone". 
But back to the point - when a design is closer at hand I may ask you what you think a good would be a good deal.

How much mounting space do you want? How much recess in the deck and about what depth cover? How do you feel about flex?

Hoyt is on a different path. That is some of the coolest stuff ever though. He is super high end and I don't want to copy any of their work. I have worked in other industries and produced some very cool products. My best ever was copied. They just made a few minor changes and there wasn't much I could do. I won't do that to someone. I do like Hoyt's approach, super sexy.  I'm looking for something more basic with an appeal to a wider range of people dollar wise.
Thanks for your input-

I wanna build some cool stuff that people want, at an affordable price.

Sooooo, Cad/Cam issues. Prolly a bit off topic for this forum. If you guys want to hear about it let me know and I'll post here. Otherwise Itsmedant email me and I can help point you in the correct direction. Not a problem- Oh you should visit cnczone.com I was helped there too when a cnc newb. So much good info and people too--- very helpful

Thanks for the reply,
What type of cave do you like? Is there an agreed upon cave for esk8? Or is it as personalized as standard longboards? I'll ask you this too, since a 30" wb is substantial.  Flex? Some? None? A Ton?

I never said copy. If anything, take an existing product/idea and with input from the community make it your own. Soooo.... I kinda see where this might going. You want to do what everyone else it doing and yet not? We have custom made decks and enclosures already. Although there is a lack of wood enclosures with the exception of one production board. The Hoyt St. It would be awesome to see some more. ;)

Thanks for the reply-
Single or dual kicks? Do you have an angle preference? How do you feel about flex? Sorry for all the questions. For a guy who has been involved in skate stuff forever I feel like a newb. But then that's why I'm doing this. Something new and something to learn.

Exactly- there seems to be only what everyone else is doing. I grant you that. Your point is well taken. I simply hope to arrange that(what everyone else is doing) into an affordable, attractive package that I can have some fun with. I hope there is room for a niche builder in the already saturated deck/enclosure are. Thanks for your input.

More mild-drop (possibly drop through) decks that could work with pneumatic wheels is something I think a lot of people are wanting. Most decks don't have the clearance for it. At the moment Hummie's deck seems to be one of the only options. (Basically what @Balta_6 is searching for https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/looking-for-the-good-at-deck-twin-tip-drop-through-i-guess/87173?u=rusins )

The wheel base is for added stability at high speed . their is  no standard for cave just enough to lock your feet in. No flex preferably as many plys as possible.  Routed out with an enclosure . Its cool your doing this for the love of skating.  ü§ô

Love of skating and the love of making stuff :slight_smile:

I'm thinking cast aluminum enclosure for making the deck more rigid.   I have made tons of sand casting molds and the like for brass, aluminum etc. Maybe something similar to the butt gear covers on a jacked 4x4. A nice finned, low profile enclosure that has an O ring channel to keep the weather out- Maybe cast it from 356 and heat treat to T6. Super tough, super rigid. But will scare if ground on. 

Thoughts? Probably been done.....

I'll def email ya! Working a long shift today so it may be later tonight.


As far as the decks go, having a battery cut out but maintaining a stiffer ride is important to me. I want long range and a good amount of power out of my boards (at least 12s4p) so its a big stack of batteries hanging out down there.

If you are able to make a matching enclosure and a cut out, you're golden.

I've been dying to see some different wedging/dewedging with more exotic concaves vertically.

I was helped by forum (cnczone) folks to a great extent with my cnc routing venture. Happy to pay it back-
Hit me up!

How do you feel about the cast aluminum enclosure idea? I can make a pretty casting that will add rigidity to the deck. The door is open for shape and size. I'm thinking cooling fins would look awesome. A logo can be cast in and it can allow for a deeper pocket in the deck since the enclosure is providing strength. Lower over all profile??? Just thinking out load-

I think the biggest thing there is going to be weight. 

I think you can get some really cool shapes dialed in by casting, but keeping it light and strong at the same time is key.

Low profile as well, are you going for a street deck or an AT?

Mild drop like red ember boards with longer ends to accomadate 6inch tires and allow forward motor mounting. Thick abs enclosure and at least  27inches of rideable deck for us long legged folks. I will be following this for sure üòÅ

Most  popular AT wheel atm are the Bergmeisters because of their low cost ‚Äì that's 150mm wheel diameter. Next after that are sixshooters, which are 160mm I believe. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Since these are AT wheels people usually ride them with trucks that are wider than standard Calibers. Kahua trucks have a 210mm hanger, 340mm axles, Surfrodz RKP have various sizes, but 200mm hanger with 340mm total axle length seem to be the most popular. Of course, it would be super awesome if you could get these wheels to also work on smaller trucks like Surfrodz TKP 170mm (~310mm axle width), or e-calibers (184mm hanger, 274mm axle). (But the last one is pretty extreme, I don't know how many people would want a deck so narrow to accommodate that.)

As others have mentioned, people like stiff decks because it makes building easier, and is better for stability at high speeds. Glad to see you taking input from everyone :)

How hard is a compound stiffness board for you?  Thick and ridged in the middle for battery pockets and enclosures but thinner at the bend and trucks for shock absorption

Interesting concept- I'll really have to give that some thought. I just pressed a 10 ply deck with composite. It will be stiff, but will ride that way. My first thought is if you pressed a 10 or 12 ply deck then machined down the ends to be thin you might make a weak point. Basically the flex is concentrated in one area. I do like the concept- are there any in production now??

I've never seen one but if you have more composite in the machined section it would still be strong, or taper the wood sections at the end before pressing

This one will be super stiff, I do like he idea of a tapered thickness with more composite in the center section.

Here is a quick run through on where I'm at- I do have a half dozen infrared lamps on order from mainland China. I have my pumps, vacuum chamber etc. for finishing my vacuum forming machine. I want to make matching abs enclosures. 

This deck is pretty simple. The next will be more on point as I learn. 
37.5" x 10.5"
.625 cave at 11", mild progressive with super wide flat floor.
mild rear w....mild
Cereal Bowl drop
10 Plies
Tri-ax under e glass

Will machine battery pocket (any suggestions on dimensions?), truck mount pockets and of course profile. I have a few profile designs but that's sorta not so important right now.

I started with these poplar blocks I made from rough 8/4. Then one side (back) on each is planed. Then each face is machined in a 3 step process. Rough, Semi rough, final slice.

If you do a pocket for the batteries then try getting it to hold a 10s4p of 21700 with a BMS and Unity or something?  That seems to be where people are leaning

I thinks that's around 170mm x 500mm

Alternative is match it to a Haya or Hummie, double cut-outs are well liked for the space and strength

Could you add like a w concave?

Thanks for the reply, actually there is a mild w tucked up against the rear drop. Makes for little pockets on both sides of the w. Is this what you were thinking or did you have a different concept? I'm really looking for your input here.
