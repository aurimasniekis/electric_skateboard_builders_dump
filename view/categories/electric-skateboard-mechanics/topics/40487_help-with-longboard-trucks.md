Hey guys I need a pretty long axle(12mm diameter axle) for my electric skateboard build and am finding that the only ones that i can find online are these: (http://www.trampaboards.com/trampa-skate-truck--with-12mm-hollow-axle--powdercoated-red-or-blue-with-black-trims-p-11145.html). The problem is that I want my electric skateboard to be based on a longboard, not a mountainboard. Can I just replace the baseplate with these:(http://socalskateshop.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=33491)? Thanks

By the way, I'm trying to replicate @fliess 's direct drive. (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fliess-3-einmal-directdrive-immer-directdrive/32279/107)

The axle in the Super Carve trucks is only 10mm though, not 12!!

The hanger....is 10" inches ....with the axles is 12" inches flat. 306 mm in all (or 30 centimeters and 6 millimeters wide) measured by this chest ....yeah boy, think this is wide enough.

mm, not inches. the actual diameter of the axle.  OP wants 12mm for strength not 12" for space
