Which part is coming loose for you? What hex tools are you using?

Loktite needs 24 hours to cure it it's almost worthless.  

Try using a C Clamp to hold the motor clamp in place.

  Mark the set screw position  and then drill an 1/8 deep with the proper size bit, put the hanger clamp back in place and secure with clamp, appl loktite to the set screws and install, tighten down the bolt and nut in the collar using a torque bar on your wrench...then leave it for a day. 

If you don't correctly it will never move.

It is the part that contacts the trucks, the set screws are not coming loose, they are pretty tight, it’s just that the set screws aren’t gripping the trucks. I tried putting thin sheet metal strips under the set screws to let it grip better but no luck, still moves.

If you torque them down enough, you shouldn't have to use even locktite.

I use no locktite, no heatshrink.

I dog them out trying to loosen them. Just make sure you pin them to one corner.

I do not have the same mount, but I was thinking It might be that you tighten opposite set screws equally, then they are making sort of a pivot point. Try tightening only two screws that are 90deg to each other, and let the mount land on the truck hanger surface where the two other set screws are placed. Dont know if this will work, but it might be worth a shot

I had this issue with another mount a long time ago, I ended up using a short set grub screw, then a hex bolt on top of it so it kinda acts like a jam nut

Today i after a 8km ride i noticed that my mount was loose, the screw had not moved but the truck material had worn down. 
Ended up tightening the bolts even more and for now its all good.
But if it comes loose again i will use JB-weld....

I guess it all comes down to the hardness of the truck material, if it gives in easily, the mount will always become loose after a while. What trucks do you guys have this problem on?

Surprised everyone seems to be having the issue.

I think it's an installation issue but it probably shouldn't be that difficult :/

I saw this coming as soon as they changed their mounts from the clamping style with an opening to the closed off ones only held by set screws and no clamping force. 

We went through this when @Boardnamics released his mounts and nobodys clamp worked, and i remember seeing the torqueboards had a similar style which is why I thought it would work, turns out it doesn't.

I doubt any of these will be able to stay on consistently no matter what you do.

Not everyone is having this issue. Very slim issue in regards to how many people use our mounts.

The current mount clamps a lot better than the previous IMO.

It does this on all 4 sides. I think the screws dig in loosen the mount. I do like the mounts, and they are simple, just doesn't last for me.

It could be related to the loose tolerances on Caliber 2 trucks.  I did a little bit of a study on the Caliber 2 hangers a while back and found a max of 1.8mm difference between exact location on multiple hangers.

I've said it and other have said it

You didn't torque it tight enough.

- use loctite
- use a socket driver/ratchet with atleast a 6 inch handle. Don't use Allen keys or screw handle bits, it simply will not be tight enough

I'm going to be home in a minute. And I'm going to make a video to install these properly... So yea..

I've assembled way too many of these. For this to be an issue.

Anyways, I'll make it easier.

Hey,   I also had similar issues with putting Torqueboards mounts.   It was a lot of pain.  But actually it is possible to put them on tightly on the  trucks, if you use a lot of force to torque them down. 

This is what I did.

1.   Get a BIG and strong wrench.     A little hex tool is not enough.   

2.   The screws that came with my mounts were made from stainless steel, and it is very easy to strip them.    After I stripped a couple of them and had a lot of problems with removing them, I decided that these screws are not good.   So I replaced all screws and bolts with "Class 12.9 steel" screws from boltdepot.com

3.   You need to torque the main big bolt that holds the mount really hard with a big wrench, so that the mount grips the truck tightly and does not move.

4.    If you do step 3 correctly, I think that set screws are not really needed.   (But you can still put them on.)

@fuzzyspikez @ROFEN13 @Bjork3n @intensivegecko @ZackoryCramer @ATLesk8

Could you guys let me know if you guys installed it as specified above. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/torqueboards-motor-mount-comes-loose/50972/43?u=torqueboards @Deckoz post.

If your still having the issue after above. Let me know. I'll still work on making it easier but I do feel this is the best option.

You can use a T Tool. I do, but it's definitely a high quality T Tool that doesn't deform when torquing it down.

I did torque mine down with a handle like you are using in the video.
But its very easy to strip these screws if you force it too much and if that would happen it would really ruin my day. 
I use the proper tools and no cheap hex.

Sure i can try torque it more but if my bolt strips or snaps would i be covered ?

@Bjork3n You shouldn't have to strip your bolts. Not sure how you can strip an M8 Set Screw but sure.. I'll send you a new one if you strip it. It's not a button cap bolt.

I've put upwards of 50lbs on these set screws. You're talking about m8 inside of 7075 or 6083 ...you'll likely not have the strength to strip them unless you are talking about the head and you aren't using a hardened bit

If this would strip i would be stuck with a bolt that i cant remove.

Likely to strip your bit before the head, and if your rounding the head your using an imperial but instead of metric.

It is H4.0 head

Just make sure you pull the mount back like I explained in the video, as strikes if it is riding on screws will make it walk. It needs a flush contact

You may need to repair the hanger surface at this point.  You can fill the set screw holes in the hanger with JB Weld, let it cure, then sand.  You may even wet sand to get a cleaner surface.  All that being said it may be cheaper to get a new hanger, I have some laying around I'd let go cheap or if you are out of the US it shouldn't be hard to find a used one.

I am using the old C type TB clamps on my Liquid Precision trucks and the new D type TB clamps on my TB 218mm trucks.
Both have been as solid as a rock.

The clamping technique that @mmaner mentioned helps a lot with the C type because it allows you to get the clamp a lot tighter without stripping the bolt head or threads. You can also use a vise if you have one and that works even better.

For the newer D type ring,
What @torqueboards  mentioned “tighten them into a corner “ is key.
Here are the steps I used and my mounts have never come loose.
1: remove the bottom and forward set screws.
2: Then fully tighten the top and rear set screws and crank them down as tight as you can with an Allen socket on a ratchet. NOT an Allen wrench. Allen wrenches are too weak.
3: after the top and bottom screws are as tight as possible, and the ring is tight against the bottom and forward sides of the hanger, then install the bottom and forward screws and crank them down.

These are the Allen sockets I use:

Tested today and the screw is strong for sure. 
I managed to broke the allen bit in the screw.. 
Going to the shop to get a superstrong allen bit now. 

Next project is getting this bit out off the screw. 
This is my mistake nothing to do with the mount, bancho tools never failed me before but now it did. 

Any suggestions is highly appreciated on how to get it out.

Bought this, hopefully it's strong enough

Update
So now ive tighten all the bolts in the correct order according to dekoz video.
TIghten them to the point where i can feel that if i was about to do more it would either round the insert or snap the hex. 

Will let you know if it holds up.

@torqueboards, i have the same problem... i even used my cordless baby impact on it w/ blue loctite and it STILL comes loose (allbeit takes a week or so as opposed to every ride) and its not just the ring that makes contact on the trucks, its the motor part too, i have broken 2 allen keys in 1 motor and cant even toghten those anymore.. i am waiting for them to wiggle loose so i dont have to drill out metal so close to my motor and on top of tht, this failure caused one of my motors can to be destroyed. when i reached out to y'all on the site i was told to buy a new motor, even after offering to buy a new can... i have since bought anything from y;all but your product works and i still refer people to you regularly

Y’all wanna know how to do it the real way?

Go to Bunnings and buy some hex head bolts, now you can torque the living shit out of em. I did this and snapped the M6 bolt (the threaded bit) before I stripped the head. 


Also @Namasaki is right drilling little holes a few mm into the truck works a treat that way the truck can’t slide even if the set screws do come a little loose

Impact guns don't produce that much torque lol. Impact guns are like slide hammers for bolts. They beat the bolt loose. You don't ever see a mechanic (one that is good) use an impact to tighten things, they use torque wrench set or ratchets.

Speed and uneven payment play a role for me. I bring my backpack with small tools and hardware on my esk8 journeys. I’ve had nuts fall off axels, lose motor mounts, deck hardware go missing, broken magnets in motors, and belts that disappear. It feels good to have tools and hardware on hand to fix, tighten, or call a friend/uber.

I like to do a multi-inspection before I roll out to make sure mounts, motor mounts, and wheels are good. Uneven payment sucks, avoid as much as possible or go slow. 

This thread has helped me, because my form on installing mounts was amateur style.

A 3/8 rachet with a 4mm hex socket. I believe these are what @Deckoz used.  Lowes, Home Depot, Sears, Harbor Freight all should carry these. I would recommend just buying them as a set of you can, since you will probably use them in the future.

Set screws work but too many people have issues for whatever reason. I have gotten them to work fine but just the fact so many other people have issues makes it an issue for me now too. It is why I went with a 2 piece clamp system. It is more bulky and takes a little time to adjust, but it is **way** more effective at clamping overall. Good luck stripping an M6 cap head 12.9 bolt

For those of you that can't get the loctite to work even after waiting 24hrs, it is probably due to the paint on the mount.  I put loctite on mine a couple times with no luck.  Then I found somewhere that loctite primer would fix this issue.  I bought some Loctite 19269 7649 Primer N Activator off Amazon and used it with blue loctite on my mounts.  I haven't had any bolts come loose since.  The activator dry's in about 30 seconds.  Once that is dry, you can apply loctite.  It will dry much quicker than the normal 24hrs, but I still waited to be sure.  Make sure to also follow the instructions above for properly installing the mount.

Update-

I used @Deckoz method for my Reverse TB mounts I received and My mounts are much better. I don't have to check them like I did before because I didn't mount them with enough torque and blue Loctite. After riding for weeks and super fast on shitty SF Bay Area streets, one of my mounts did loosen. Not a big deal, just redid what I was told. 

On a side note, I really like reverse mounts. I can clear reflectors, which was a big problem because I would break magnets in my motors. I'm happy with the TB reverse mounts!

If you going to use a torque wrench, use a small one, it's easy to strip threads and mangle the heads of the screws.

A quality tool will fit nicer in the hex in my experience. If you can see some unused thread where the grub goes deeper then this is an opportunity to get longer grubs in there which giving more staying power.

Clean threads with a tap and clean with brake cleaner or whatever solvent you have, dry properly, loctite with right amount of time to cure

I honestly found that so far, fingers crossed, using blue loctite and then proceeding to torque the shit out of them was the key. I’ve intentionally ridden in some pretty messed up places and it’s holding fine. Gone on a 10+ mile ride and have done about 30 miles in the last week or so with them holding up fine. Blue loctite or a dab of red at the tip and blue at the rest will do the mounts major good.

The flaw in all motor mount designs is that they all clamp from the trucks and cantilever out.  The weight of the heavy motor on the outer end produces torsional forces on the motor that become greater as you come closer to the truck.  This could be alleviated with another mount securing it at the motor end and a cross bar (if its dual).

I am afraid I have painted her in a bad light she wasn't trying to hurt the board, 
she was trying to hit me with it. 
She felt badly for breaking the deck, and not even hitting me with it, 
she bought me the aluminum board.
 it is a lot lighter, easier for her to throw. :)

What would be a stronger material to avoid striping screws?  Stainless Steel, or regular Steel? I know Aluminum is weaker than Steel, but If I want to really torque down a screw, what material would be the strongest?

If you want to really get it solid, use a hex bolt instead of a grub screw. My board got ran over by a car and destroyed everything, including the motor. But that mount was still solid 😂

M6-1.0x12mm (can't remember how long it is, but it's somewhere in there)

Only used one, in one of the holes that the head wouldn't interfere with the mounting plate. Torqued it down with a ratchet, and used blue loctited. Used blue loctite on the rest of the grub screws, and otherwise installed like @Deckoz in his videos. Worked perfectly.

I want to reiterate, I had tons of issues until I properly mounted my mounts. It's been a really long time, many rides on tons of horrible pavement, the weight of 6374 motors jostling at them and the bolts are still as tight as the day I torqued them down and there is absolutely zero play. I haven't even applied loctite in months, and when I did it was loctite blue that had been screwed in and out and wiped off while troubleshooting.

I'd love new mounts, but if I could show you how, I'm sure everyone in this thread could get by with proper mounting of your existing mounts.

Pretty much. This is how I mount mine, with the thick heatshrink (glue kind) wedged between the mounts and hangar as pictured:

![20180603_195820x|281x500](upload://veqUcpcXh2pYa1GuON6Un4if5xP.jpg)![20180603_195631x|690x388](upload://t73cT0FGIyZeD5U48iYW9NLFuqt.jpg)

Since doing this, my mounts have been **SOLID**... Whereas before I'd have to constantly re-tighten the set screws as they would *always* come loose, it was annoying, but my mounts set up exactly like this have taken way too much abuse for a long time and even with old old applications of loctite blue, the set screws even are as tight as the day I torqued them down with a small Allen key ( L ).

Dont drill it out. Use heat to soften the locktite, then remove them. Drilling them out is a little extreme, and if that is your first option with removing the set screws.... you will probably have issues with the new mounts too.

I finally got around to installing these as a replacement for the v4 c-clamps that I had been using for ever... following instructions from @Deckoz and @skatardude10 , Ive achieved the best motor alignment yet! Using two 48 in. straight edges for angular skew measurement, I'm off by 1/4" at 48", which is pretty freaking square!! 
A few things I've done differently: for the grub screws, I'm using m8x20mm high carbon steel (instead of stainless) and I'm using a large crescent wrench to counter the torque while tightening them down. The longer grubs should drastically increase the clamping force and prevent stripping the threads inside the clamp rings. Regardless of others having trouble with these clamps, I think they're a great design!!

If you just got it today and allready had to work on it 3 times it's evident you didn't use loktite it at least not correctly. 

Let me school you for a minute...

Put the mount on the truck in then position it will ultimately be installed. Mark the grub screw holes with a sharpie, then take the mount off.  Drill a 4mm hole 5mm deep on that mark. Replace the mount, put blue loktite in the grub screws, install the grub screws with a socket hex adaptor.  Walk away for 24 hours. That's how ling it takes loktite to cure.

Mine used to come loose all the time until I figured out I was doing it wrong. I was tightening all 4 screws when really you should tighten only 2 all the way until the mount is pushed into a corner of the trucks. I tighten the 2 that are easiest to access when the board is upside down. I think the design is ok but there needs to be more detailed instructions. And you need to torque them down frekakng hard, so hard you think your Allen wrenches might snap.

But I'm thinking it's much smarter to swap out for hardened carbon steel hex head bolts. Maybe extra long ones for socket clearance.

well I ran into this problem using a hex bit and torque wrench. Any suggestions on what bolts to get that would be stronger?

It wasn't hard at all. I think it was actually weakened because it was pulled off three time after blue loctite cured. This motor was giving me issues. This actually broke off when I was trying to remove it

That's possible, bolts stretch over time with use especially with high torque application.

I usually hit my pulley for a few seconds with a Mapp/Pro gas torch and my locktight 680 just melts away letting the bolt easily come undone.

Hex head if you want max torque. But there may be clearance issues with the head, so you might need longer bolts. 10.9 grade is roughly equivalent to grade 8 (very hard). 12.9 is harder, but not as available hex head

socket head allen if clearance is an issue, 12.9:

And to pollute the post with irrelevance, I like albanycountyfasteners.com for stainless steel stuff. s/s is not nearly as hard as carbon steel, and has problems with "galling".

torque wrench
[/quote]

Mike I know torque wrenches usually have long handles and lots of leverage, but the micrometer types will actually go out of calibration if you reef on them. Chance to buy more tools yay! :) harborfreight has reasonably priced decent quality breaker bars (even ratcheting ones) and large ratchets. Telescoping handles ones too. Look for the Taiwan stuff, usually much higher quality than China. I especially like this double jointed thing:

https://www.harborfreight.com/38-in-drive-indexable-head-ratchet-62316.html

It's surprisingly beefy, and you can use the double jointed thing to do like a continuous drive for spinning things on quickly.

I received the new clamp this week and was pretty excited to try it out.  The 2 piece design is superior to the old single piece.  It's **much** easier to secure and naturally wants to stay plumb/square on the axle.

I'm using the TB 180mm V2 trucks.  Once I tighten down the clamp I can only get 3 bolts on the clamp.  The 4th bolt interferes with the motor mount.  Any one else run into this problem?

Here are some pictures:

Because the clamp is in two pieces and the 180/218 trucks have a different height size a bit.

Use the heatsink as a spacer so the holes align properly.

Even then, the old mounts still work... they are just a heck of a lot more painful to setup so that they work great... but it's possible. I've been riding my old style mounts, haven't adjusted a thing in months / 500+ miles of riding, no sign of coming loose soon, and nothing special like JB weld, just a dab of standard loctite blue, a shim of thick heatshrink and torquing down the set screws with a standard hex key in the proper order: furthest opposite to motor side first, next furthest opposite to motor side next, loosen furthest a tad and torque second to furthest side harder, then tighten the first furthest side hard again, then tighten the other two closest to motor side last, no need to go crazy torque on these last two. The whole point is to have the metal faces of the hangar and mount clamp touching and hard interfaced on the two faces closest to the motor.

The new clamp style mounts simplify all this... Just clamp it all down and you are good to go.

I have the new style, with four set screws.  I ordered them really recently, as of now they only sell motor mounts which are one piece with four set screws.  Sounds like they solved the problem, but then reverted back to a dysfunctional design, lol.  I read about the problems with them, but was too impatient and just bought them any way.   I was thinking that maybe I could just tighten 2 of the 4 set screws so that 2 sides of the clamp directly touch the truck.  I'll test it and see how it works that way, with some red Loctite too.

I really appreciate @torqueboards sending me new motor moubt, but not even the clamps, with blue Loctite stay on. And I torqued the hell out of the screws, so much so one  of the screw heads began to  slightly deform. I guess my roads are just that rough, the innoying part is my feet don't get numb and they're not even that bad to ride on, so it supriseing and equally infuriating the mounts keep breaking loose.  Anyone got other recommendations?  I am ready to just weld the bastards on.  Or buy a pre built, so at least I have someone to gripe at when the motors come off every day.

If you are torquing the screw so hard that the hex head is deforming on the screws, it means that you are using the incorrect sized hex head or your hex bit is too soft/cheap. 

This means you aren't applying enough torque to the screw and instead you are just deforming it. 

The correct tool and correct hex is also important

@torqueboards, unfortunately, it benan to make a clicking sound, shortly after I noticed that it was dented.  It also has a very noticeable amount of resistance, when I turn it.   I would imagine that the motor magnet broke.  By dent, I don't mean a scratch, I mean a litterall full on dent.  I was thinking that perhaps I could pull the housing off and try to take the dent out and then see where I stand.  I'm not sure how much damage (to the windings) was caused by the magnet rubbing on them, but I know there was a substantial amount of force, just by the fact that it burned around two times the normal battery.  My battery died after like 13 - 16 miles today, I didn't ride it home is was performing so poorly.  Does removing the dent and reassembling it seem like a possibility?  I would just ride it till it was done, but it burns so much power I could not make my commute, and I don't want to destroy the battery with full discharges over a toasted motor.  I attached to an overly lenthy video of the sound and the dent.  You can probably watch the first 5 seconds and get the picture.

Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it.
