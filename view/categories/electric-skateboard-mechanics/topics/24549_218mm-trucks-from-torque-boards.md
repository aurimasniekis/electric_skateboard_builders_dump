Anyone have any experience or knowledge about Torque Boards 218mm trucks? Thinking of getting a pair to use with a single 6374 out runner motor which, due to their size, would give me the option to add another one of those motors in the future for a dual setup. What is the difference in the ride with wider trucks like these?

I think most people that have ordered are expecting them in the next few days so there isn't any reviews as of yet. 
Also you need a larger clamp for the motor mount which TB won't have in stock for another week unless you make your own.
