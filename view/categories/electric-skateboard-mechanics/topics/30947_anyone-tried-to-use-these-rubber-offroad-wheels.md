I just bought these wheels on ebay to try out. It has a core that looks like might be useable.

Its something I have wanted to do for some time now, but those wheels are hard to get in oz. I ended up going with a different set.

Are they a _Tang_ core clone?
Are they sealed, solid or?

Bit big for you maybe, but smaller than existing (except your project wheels).

These wheels seem perfect for Carvon v4 torque drive.
They are on amazon too:

They work quite well with your average flywheel gears after a bit of dremeling, although I can tell you from experience that MBS urethane wheels are the better purchase. I should probably update that build thread...

Cool build bro, there is something to be said to saving things...

On the flip side these current wheels look to have a upgraded cores, what do you think @anorak234?

I've tried the new wheels, a kid in my neighbourhood has them. The cores are just a different shape, no difference in feel while riding. It certainly looks easier to bolt this one, on my wheels I had to drill through it as accurately as I could

From my experience and personal use, I think MBS wheels are easier to work with (normal flywheel core) and because they are urethane rather than rubber I think the 16mm difference balances out. Traction on the MBS wheels is also much better, and because of the modified shape they are a more versatile combination. However as always it depends on the needs of the rider. Here's the quickest comparison that I can think of:

Smooth Roads: MBS > R.O.
Rough Roads: MBS > R.O.
Grass: MBS > R.O.
Dirt: MBS > R.O.
Trails: R.O. > MBS
Woods: R.O. > MBS

Basically the R.O. wheels are only for more extreme circumstances, all of which I would then default to pneumatic wheels for a more shock-absorbant combination. But if you are on a budget and really love trail and woods then these are the wheels to go for.

If you have a look at my profile pic you'll notice my tubby self riding these very same wheels. I bought em back in 1998 from CVS mail order. Honeywheels XT wheels. They came with "skyhooks" which have broken more ankles than Jim Croce has hearts ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

$10 bucks a wheel on race day they be disposable... and this will sound crazy... but years ago when I raced slot cars it was all about power and grip. We used to rub our soft rubber with synthetic lube to get even more grip. It was crazy... race org tried to ban it, but who knows what people did to their rubber the night before...

Hate to be the bearer of bad news, without air in the mix rubber wheels are shit. Dead, slow, heavy and the opposite of sticky. 

Ask me how I know.

Kind of already regretting my purchase. I should have asked if you had tried these specific wheels. It was an impulse buy.


Maybe I will get a cheap deck and try them out pushing. I'll just sell them if not.

My original idea was to put them on a lathe like I have seen a few people do on those other off-road wheels

I still think there should be some kind of light softer wheel that is ~100 mm or so. Maybe some kind of [airless tire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airless_tire)

Something like this

Im wondering whenever the cost is always that much higher for these airless tires that they are not as popular yet. 

Anyways the ones u posted do look quite good

for sure @Okami, it is just a concept, but intriguing, I would have thought inserts closer to the hub would be more effective at progressively limiting rebound for example... inserts in the outer layer would just stop rebound... but cool direction :sunglasses:

@Cobber  So what perfect tires have u found? 

U seem to be using bigger pneumatic tires than some street / urban setups might be using.

But what do u think would be your choice of 5-6 inch pneumatic tires / wheels?

I know @psychotiller has some really good wheels from what  @MoeStooge have been saying.

But other.than that do.u know.any.other.besides.his?

I know enertion also had some but not.anymore, the last o.had seen.someone.using them was @monkey32 but as far.as.i.know.he.sold.his to someone else.

I don't think perfect tires for eSk8 have been made yet bro.
Yeah psycho's [sixshooters](https://psychotiller.com/product/6-billet-wheel-hubs) look to be the business, slightly square, billet hubs... they look nice for that size. I have not seen anything else but plastic toy wheels.
I'd love to see psycho's wheels with a deep angular block tread pattern, something like the old avon distanza's had...

https://www.kawasakiforums.com/forum/attachments/klx-250s-71/7212d1439502235-avon-distanzia-tires-image.jpg

here is another interesting option. In the gif at the bottom of this crappy indiegogo campaigns website

https://jcrboard.com/

those rubber wheels look pretty neat. "damping rubber wheels"

At that thickness it doesn't seem like that is going to dampen much but something along these lines could work. heck maybe I could carefully drill some small holes in my wheels.

Rubber over PU. Didn't persue it very far. Grip level went up. May play with the idea again in the future with softer duro. Also slowed the wheel down from Urethane. Definitely a cheaper alternative for someone who wants more grip from a smaller wheel.
