Tl;DR: read last paragraph.

Hi everyone! 6 months back when I was buying parts for my electric skateboard, I read this excellent post about using different angles in the front and back of your board to reduce speed wobbles: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/split-truck-angles-wtf-are-they-and-why-should-i-care-and-other-stuff-about-trucks/57929

I ended up buying 44 degree and 40 degree trucks, and then using sector-9 angled risers to increase the difference in angle even more (I think it's around 54 in the front and 30 in the back). Before my electronics had arrived, I was stuck with pushing my board, I noticed that although this did make my board super stable at high speeds, it also made it hard to keep balance while pushing. This is because the front of the board turns much more, so standing on just 1 foot straight in the middle can easily cause the board to go in a unwanted direction.

When I finally did get my board motorized, I noticed another downside: because the back of the board resists turning, it will tilt instead, causing one of the wheels to lift from the ground quite often. This is a bit awkward when making turns, because that motor+wheel will audibly speed up. (Perhaps the traction control setting in Vesc tool fixes this, haven't managed to play around with it yet.)

Anyway, I'm planning my next build (with pneumatic wheels), and ideally would like to use a drop-through deck, meaning that angled risers aren't really an option (unless I saw the holes in the board wider). I've seen a lot of builds on here that use pneumatic wheels, and they don't appear to use angled risers.

Are wide trucks and/or large, air-filled wheels enough to reduce speed-wobbles? I'd like to hear what others think, and if you happen to own a pneumatic wheel beast, I'd love it if you shared things like wheelbase length, truck width, etc. and at what speed you feel comfortable riding it. I'm aiming for a little above 50kmh (31mph) personally. Thanks!

Yes, larger wheels will make the ride much smoother and wider trucks make it easier to go at speed for myself. I havent measured the highest speeds i've got too, but its got to be over 35MPH on 6" Pnumatics and 218mm TB Trucks. Landy evo with a wide wheelbase helps too.

Hold on now – The Lanyachtz Evo has different angles at the front and back. Unless you've tried the same setup on a flat board, you can't be sure that the angles weren't the main thing helping you be stable at that speed.

My shitty evolve also was much more stable with 107s than 85mm

I can’t compair with full urethane but on trampa trucks (mini and regular) i‘m super stable till 50km/h doesn’t matter if 6.5“ or 8“ or 9“.
There are different dampas for the springs and even with the yellow (which are the softest) it’s an easy to stay stable.
Personally over 50km/h it’s getting more difficult to don’t get speed wobbles, but that also depends on the stiffness if your deck and how much confident you in your stand.
If you make a bit pipi in your pans when reaching top speed than it’s sure more likely than when you trust in yourself and stay strong on the board.

Urethane has less wobble than pnuematic tires.

Urethane is more stable, they dont have any rebound, well comparitively speaking, and they are also higher off the ground, reducing control leverage..

The issues you have experienced can also be attributable to bushing tune, wheel lift is a bushing issue. Check out the bushing thread..

I think some people are also just better at controlling wobbles than others. My self I know that I have only gotten wobbles once or twice and that’s riding china trucks with stock bushing at 50km/h+ 

I don’t ride DH and haven’t ridden a long board since I started esk8 a year ago. However I did spend a lot of time on penny boards.

I don’t disagree that bushings and angles help a lot but it is also partially up to the rider to maintain there balance and not try to fight against the wobbles. When I experience speed wobbles I don’t try and counter them I just lock my ankles a little tighter and keep a straight line as best as possible.

I’ve heard that carving can help to mitigate wobbles if you have them although I don’t usually feel too comfortable carving at those speeds

Wider trucks don't make for more stable boards and the same goes for wheels. It is the rake, bushings and precision of the trucks that affect your boards potential to speed wobble. The other way to prevent wobble is to turn two different angled base plates on the trucks, this will greatly lower the effect as both the trucks turn they will naturally fight against each other rather than the wobble synchronising and increasing its effect. That's why(and many other reasons) decks like the Evo have the two different angles at each end.

Don't ever do this. Keep your knees bent and ankles relatively loose and start a turn or carve and continue to keep the board turning until you slow the board enough to stop the wobbles.

t also made it hard to keep balance while pushing. This is because the front of the board turns much more, so standing on just 1 foot straight in the middle can easily cause the board to go in a unwanted direction.

I think this sounds more like inexperience? Maybe just get higher rebound bushings until you work up more strength in your ankles for control?
Also angled risers are available for drop through too ;)

Wobbles have never been a real issue with me I just lean over the front truck and put 90% of my weight on that front truck and the last 10% on my rear leg. If feels un natural but it generally prevents wobble. I've had a person 100lbs less than me tell me my trucks are too loose and they get wobbles at 20mph and I ride my board up to 40mph+ and feels as smooth as glass to me.

The only time leaning over the front trucks has failed me was when I was fully committed to a tuck under full throttle on my 4wd and one of the front belts got caught in an idler from being too loose.  I woke up in an ambulance.

I agree with everything you've said. Wet noodle for wobbles! 

But first to answer OP, for some reason I feel much more stable going fast on 6x2 Pneumatics. It doesn't make sense to me, but they just inspire confidence being so damn smooth and grippy at any speed. But I don't think large pneumatic wheels elminate speed wobble. I have the feeling they might reduce it, but there are bigger factors at play, mainly being truck geometry and the rider. Just the other day I watched a guy on pneumies wobble out at 38 or so... I don't think his pneumies helped much then.

In response to @Friskies, but not directed @ you or anything, after many years of DH myself, I'd like to point something else out for discussion.... It's generally held that precision reduces wobbles, and that's been my belief till now, but after some thought my belief is that this is largely not accurate, since  wobbles can stem from multiple things- rider experience, riders reaction, precision, angles, etc. The main difference there, one is setup and the other is rider. Lots of changes to your board help precision: bushings, inserts, spherical, precision cups, tight tollerances on pivot cups and bushing seats, straight axles. Otherwise it comes down to the rider. I know from experience riding sphericals vs others riding Aeras, some riders just can't ride sphericals and be stable, yet I could get the same ultra precise setup up to 55+mph as stable as can be. 

The TLDR I guess, precision doesn't exactly mean more stable. Some small amount of play can go one of two ways... Rake and all other factors the same, for someone used to a precise setup, a standard less precise off the shelf setup can come out as slop and unpredictability leading to potential wobbles. Conversely, for someone used to a standard non-spherical or everyday downhill trucks, a small amount of slop can almost act as dampening for wobbles... That micro-twitch in the ankles may be partially absorbed by the slop as opposed to them riding an ultra precise setup where a micro-twitch could lead to wobbles from a micro turn starting the oscillations if they aren't used to it.

I'm all for precision, but I know from experience that too much precision depending on the rider can be both a really bad or really good thing for overall stability. Regardless, I go for the most precision personally, and add a damper to the rear truck... Best of both worlds imo, in a way.

Good point about my bushing setup being incorrect. I'm using the default ones that came with my Caliber 2s, and just tightened them down to insane levels. (According to the bushing thread, that's really bad) Oh, how I wish Riptide bushings were cheaper...

All that truck angle knowledge is assuming the bushings are tuned correctly..make a post asking exactly which bushings you should get, it's based in many things like your weight and truck angles..

Bushings can definitely make a more stable for a ride but also and split angle trucks can help with wobble.
