There is more and more confusion and many new wheels hitting the market, so I made a list of all the different 90mm+ Flywheel-style-wheels to provide a better overview

@ChrisChaput (and all the others on this forum)
Would be nice if you can take a look if this is all correct and maybe help filling some of the gaps ;)

Great list! It’ll definetely help people finding the right wheel. Only thing i’m missing is the prices or price-range.
