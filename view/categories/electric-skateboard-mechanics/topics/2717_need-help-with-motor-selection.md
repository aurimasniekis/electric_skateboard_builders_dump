Hey guys I'm looking for a motor that can output lots of speed like 23 mph+. Ive heard the lower Kv the better but i'm still new to this and i wasn't really sure what Kv meant. Hoping that you guys can help me find an affordable (under 100$) motor that can really give a kick. Thanks for all your help.

Turnigy SK3 below 260kv below would do or even over perform. They are all below 100 usd. KV means rpm per volt. Doesn't necessarily means shit as our body load would messed up the actual rpm math. Take KV as a number or power rating. Get 260kv below and you're good.

Look for that  motor in the U.S or whereever you are located. its on back order in that link for europe but its s nice motor. very durable, good low KV rating, if you run it at 8 or 10s itll get you well over your 23 mph asking. 

I run it on single drive 10s, 16:36 ratio, TB 12s esc and it hits 30 mph.    220 Lbs load.

Thanks for your help. I was looking at this one http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18184__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6374_149kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor.html lower Kv and it seems that it would go pretty fast since your 213 Kv motor goes 30.

it's not about the kv really - it's about the gearing.

Single vs dual also will factor in for starting power and hills.  Top speed once rolling will be more about gearing than kv.  I would not go below 200kv on your motor as like barajaball mentioned - you'll really need 10-12s to utilize it well.

200-245 is my recommended.  If not fast enough - switch your motor gear up a tooth (which will affect start speed/torque and hills).  A couple kicks ot start will almost always help.

Yes but less torque. Stay close to 200 plus or minus 

The rest can be done with gearing. Pick a motor and I'll help you pick gearing

if you've got a long enough extension cord Lowes has a leaf blower that will probably take you up over 25 if you can hang on to it long enough.

well either motor will be fine.  you can run 6s or 10s on either one.  Obviously 10s will get you going a lot faster but if you want to hit 23 mph 6s on the 213kv on a 16:36 ratio will do you just fine.  Youre light so you dont need much reduction.

If you want to go with Lipo's theyre alot cheaper,  for 6s go with http://www.ebay.com/itm/FLOUREON-6S1P-22-2V-10000mAh-25C-Lipo-RC-Battery-Deans-Plug-RC-Helicopter-/162006486054?hash=item25b856cc26:g:~X4AAOSwP~tW5mRY   (cheaper)

or a Zippy battery. would be fine too. 

honestly you can use whatever battery you want.  stay between a minimum of 10C (discharge rate) and like 35 C. 

you want at least 6s. and maybe 8-10 Amp hours. 

this will help you make your lipos slim and opens the opportunity to different size lipo packs ( i did this with multistar Lipos)

Ok perfect thanks i think the 6s will do although i do want the 10s due to the speed they are just to expensive and have too little mAh for their price. What does the ratio you mentioned mean exactly? Gearing?

Well the higher voltage you go. The more expensive things get. 

If you're using the 120 amp FVT car esc then 6s is your max. If this is your first build I'd stick to 6s and you can judge for yourself where you want to go from there in the future. 

The gearing ratio is a 36 T (tooth) whee pulley and a 16t (tooth) motor drive pulley. 

Just buy this kit 
It's got everything you need in terms of that product/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-with-drive-wheel-kit/

You'll need some caliber trucks and some abec clone 83mm wheels.

okay if and when you order from @torqueboards make sure you buy the paris truck adapter and not the caliber one.  and an ESC is an Electronic Speed Control.   A V-ESC is Vedders- Electronic Speed Control.  it is a custom E-board ESC as oppsed to other ESC's which are designed mostly for cars.  

do a simple search in the search bar for VESC youll find a lot of info

yea Enertion is a great place to buy from too.  since youre doing a single motor setup. 12mm is going to be better than 9mm for power transfer.  That exact link you sent me is perfect for what you need. but you still need a motor mount, and im pretty sure Enertion doesnt sell a mount for paris trucks. so that youll need to buy from diyelectricskateboard. you can buy the mount alone without the pulleys.   I also have a spare Paris bolt on mount in black that i can sell you.

As i add more kv to this calculator i get a higher speed so im thinking of moving up Kv because more speed and its cheaper but somehow i think this isnt a great option. And obviously when i move to 10s the speed increases greatly. But i am reconsidering motor Kv.

I don't sell batteries or anything for that matter just extra things I have and don't use. 

If you want me to tell u what to do, just get a 213kv motor it's like 70 bucks. And go with a 16:36 ratio you'll go plenty fast on 6s. 

10s is good too but more expensive you'd need a capable esc and battery

## \#44 Posted by: barajabali Posted at: 2016-05-02T04:09:18.531Z Reads: 82

Because they run 10s and have a specific gearing ratio. It's very easy to reach 30. But I think you need to try 20mph first because 20 feel very fast on a longboard. 25 is pretty much the fastest you'll go unless you're trying to break your top speed. 90 percent of the time you'll be under 25mph I think it's safe to say..

More kv=faster spinning motor, less torque. 
Less kv=slower motor but more torque

I'm a fan of iChargers, but if on a budget the Imax B6AC v2 is my choice.  There are quite a few clones out there, but seriously even a clone is probably better than the KX6 linked...

If you are trying to do it on the cheap - also consider the non AC version (you will need a power supply):
http://www.amazon.com/Battery-Balance-Charger-Li-ion-Batteries/dp/B005EF15Q4

If you are handy you can even wire up an inexpensive laptop power supply or desktop power supply to give it the 11-18v it wants.

The AC versions are simpler, but also slower charging.  Not a huge deal if you can be patient and even swap batteries to ride when the others are charging.  Slower <1c is actually really helpful for battery life as a side benefit.  If i have the time i usually do .5c or so.

Hey, 

I want to built a single motor 6s or 8s setup with enertion vesc. I heard that a motor with around 240kv is the best setup for this (don't have enough money for 10s or more). 

My problem is that I cannot find any available motor that is in  Stock at the moment. (alienpower, hobbyking) Could you please tell me where to find one? 

PS.  Why do most people use 2x 3s or 2x 4s instead of just a 6s or even one big 8s battery. There is 8s available for 80€ at hobby king. So price is not the reason right? 

Thanks for your help!

You may have to wait for SK3 motors to be back in stock. We use 2x 3s in series for more clearance between the battery and the ground.

Do you have any experience how long that usually takes?  Are there other good options except SK3 63mm, alienpower and enertion?  
So if I do not care about the clearance a 12000mah 8s will be fine?

You need clearance so your batteries don't scrape on the ground. You could have a look on ebay/aliexpress for motors. Otherwise, you may have to wait.
