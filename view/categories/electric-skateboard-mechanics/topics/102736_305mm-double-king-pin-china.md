Are these wider than normal Evolves kit? Do they sell rear trucks with adapters for motors?

Thank you for sharing!

They look to be evolve front truck clones. I haven't found any with motor mounts yet.

I use this mount for my trucks and it will also work with the new ones

Just before I put the screws in I use some strong metal glue inside the holes which spread between the axle and the inner ring and stays all firmly tight together

Ah, yeah, upon closer inspection, these hangers are not like evolves. More like the standard chinese paris clone profile, although these must taper a bit more to fit those mounts.

Be careful on those guys. I don't like to look at my 205mm chinese hangers too funny, but that doesn't stop me from riding them.

I'm planning to buy this. Is there support for dual 6374 setup with 97mm wheels ?

Have you thought about battery enclosure ? I can't find anything suit my build on taobao 😂

I use this as my battery enclosure and some carbon fiber Film to make it look nice !
For the motor mount I modified the version you see in the first post so I can install it in reverse without the motors touching the board.

If you cant find use taobao dhgate is a english alternative. Shipping from taobao can be expensive to western countries. These will fit dickyho paris mounts.... https://m.dhgate.com/product/1year-warranty-9-25inch-double-floor-longboard/480080614.html

I design and use this simple motor holders and so far no problems. Steel is very strong and 4mm until now havent failled on me. And the good feature is that you can slide your motor left and right and adjust it with a wider range of belt sizes. You also have the 4mm hole for the support bar or how you call it. You can also just laser/water cut it, i guess it would be cheaper to build.

I can send you my IPT files. Just message me your e-mail.

Thanks for sharing this link. Have you tried the dickyho mounts with the trucks? If not, have you read/heard good things about them with the trucks? I'm interested in getting the trucks, but only if Dicky's mounts work well with them. Also, do you know how one knows where on the truck to place the mounts? Its kind of a silly question, but i was wondering how you know if the trucks aren't too far to the right or left

I have never used those mounts.
You don't need to know where exactly, normally you can adjust them until you have a good match with the wheel and the belt
