Ah duuuuuude so glad to see you putting your rest time to good use! This is an amazing innovation - I‚Äôm sure @rich will take one off your hands after his previous misfortune!! ü§™

Hey, I don‚Äôt suppose you have anything in the works for the underside of the drives do you to protect the gearboxes from damage against curbs etc or in my case the ability to be able to hit rails, ledges etc without damage? This could even be added into this design. 

Just an idea to break up the boredom üòÇ

I hope you‚Äôre healing well by the way brother ü§ûüèº

Yeah @Duffman made some 3Dprinted "driveguards", they will help to protect against scratches, not sure if they will take an full impact by jumping on a rail... need to be tested !

No beer, sounds like time for Whisky :D 

But I'm with you DeckyBro, straight away I was thinking headlight mount up front... Did you see the mount Scepy was using?

I'm up for a set of truck bushings w/spacers? bash guards too...

Regardless of what it's being called, do you actually think that people are getting mislead as to what exact sort of system this is before they buy it due to the term "direct drive" being used? Particularly at the price point these sell at. 

I understand that direct drive generally seems to be referred to as hub motor systems on these forums but you could also conceive direct drive as being a term to describe the fact that the gears make direct contact as opposed to requiring a separate component such as a belt of chain to drive to "drive" the system.

I could do that :rofl:

Almost on every ride I hit a gear box with a curb or similar with full energy and weight (like after jumping, I like to ollie sidewalks but don't succeed everytime), the gear box has no problem with this heavy impacts which is really amazing but this protector could save some material...

These look great - I'd also be happy to put these through their paces ;-)

I guess the problem still might be the drives could buckle under too much impact - it really needs something to take the impact instead of the drives.  No idea how that could work though without comprimising ground clearance.  This will certainly help with general riding though.

[/quote]

I doubt the drives could buckle from my experience (of course it's possible like a lottery prize). I think a further advantage of the driveguards is that the main impact is always on the aluminium part of the gear box and never on the POM part.

I could imagine that with a separated protection the ground clearance would be too less.

You could wax the driveguards for rails DanSlides :wink:

Do you think the torque applied to the bushing via how tight the kingpin is tightened on the hanger has anything to do with it?

& sceppy's light mount bolted up on top of the trucks/deck like so:

Do you think the torque applied to the bushing via how tight the kingpin is tightened on the hanger has anything to do with it?
[/quote]

In my case I didn't tighten it at all, just until the nut touched the baseplate. I think the problem is that the brass bushings are too sturdy that's why they crack faster. When I look at used plastic bushngs I can recognize there is less material compared to a new one due to friction and movement. Also plastic can flex a little bit before it breaks, brass can't. My rear bushings broke on my second ride and the front ones after 5-10 rides. Without jumping they would last longer but I think plastic lasts longer.

But if you want to try it, I have 4-6 pieces (2mm base) left and could send them to you :grin:

Where are curbs in the mountains? :joy:

But joking aside, I never pass curbs at an angle at all, had to learn that with my first build the hard way (motor broke). With MTB it's easy, just lift the front up the curb and put more weight on your front foot and lift the back foot, easy.

Thanks I'll keep that in mind :) 
The main issue is that I generally don't ride with bindings when I'm riding in the city as I'm often riding in heavier traffic and wan't to make sure I can easily quickly bail if need be. Been thinking about getting some freebord bindings or something similar for city riding just so that my feet aren't locked in quite so much...

I personaly think that 1mm remaining brass material is not enough..... 
IMO with a pairing of 8/12mm it could work
But makes no sense to rework Baseplate .... not for sale
Checked IGUS, they got some HD bushings, maybe worth to test

Ok good to know. So you think the Leftech bindings are better? Any idea if Leiftech sell them separately? Yea @okp has some pretty awesome stuff on his Instagram with them

No.... freebord bindings are better for sure! 
Everything which was copied from Leiftec is not as good as the original FREEBORD stuff :joy::roll_eyes:
Add some foam like in my Urban Assault thread will make them even better IMO

[http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-streetcarver-e-toxx-minidirectdrive-mtb-trucks-gummies-6374-12s-steering-damper/36217/85](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-streetcarver-e-toxx-minidirectdrive-mtb-trucks-gummies-6374-12s-steering-damper/36217/85)

BUT for me as someone who felt comfortable with bindings+heelstraps the lack of "locked in" feeling with hook / open bindings feels just unsecure and not good.
On the Lifetec it feels just right.... on a eATB for me not

As i stated below this is personal preference and for other riders it feels maybe in the opposite direction !!!

Yeah @okp got awesome products driven by his passion.... just the way to go for great products.... follow your passion.... and time no matters anymore... i would push and support his stuff ANYTIME... CAUSE THE SHIT IS DOPE

Ride safe
Hang loose

I guess I need a second Bull Bar in the future. 

It's also very easy to mount and I feel safer now in case I ever crash backwards in concrete again :wink:

Orange Sample in the last picture.

Taking preorders with colour wishes, coloured price 75‚Ç¨ for NON EU, shipping like last time

BTW
i get some questions about using this with the inner spring position !
I think it will work this way : 
Mount your springs in inner position like usal, and mount the bumper in outer position with just some lock nuts, easy i guess, so it fits for all kinds of application
Mini Direct Drive, Direct Drive, Inner Outer Spring Position
only 80mm Motors was not testet at this point

those are adorable :D I love them

I too am working on a "bull bar" but more in the traditional sense where it wraps around the front of the board and houses a couple fog lights/lightbar

I was wondering if you could/would mind telling me some of the dimensions? Like the distance between the holes and the overall length.. ide like to try and make my own bull bars for my board while im at work but im a sailor and cant and wont be able to get the measurments myself for a couple months. Side note, i bought ur mini direct drive and really love em.

Thx a ton man, i really hope my dimensions will work out. Wanted to show off from ur idea/inspiration what i came up with. I wanted a handle to carry my board, but saw that it might hit the motors from the pics you posted, so i hope this will "curve" enough around them and double as motor protection. Not nearly as clean as your stuff and i still need mounting holes..(PS do you happen to know the bolt size that attaches to the hanger??) but i hope it worksXD  thx again and sorry for clogging up ur thread lol![20180923_125056|375x500](upload://sHR48fwXdpzf1YUsb6T6AaslELb.jpeg) ![20180923_125106|375x500](upload://yrFRuxcXC60m3CphiHfVuayXVuo.jpeg)

What are the front headlights you have installed in this picture? Also, how did you install them? What kind of light mounts work with these bull bars? I‚Äôd like to purchase the exact same one for my kaly.
