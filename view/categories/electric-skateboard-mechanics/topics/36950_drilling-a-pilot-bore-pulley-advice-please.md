Hi

Bought a new motor pulley which is a Dunlop steel pilot bore pulley.... any advice on drilling it out to 8mm appreciated... I’m not sure I can fit it to the lathe without damaging it. 

Cheers.

Use a dell press and triple check that it is centered first before drilling it out. It’s not to bad if you have a smaller hole all ready in the pulley
