Try figure out if all my components will fit together, looking to get caliber 2 trucks with turnigy SK3 6354 but wondering if the 6364 would fit but can't find the width of the centre part of the truck (bit you mount the motor to). the motor mount I'm using is carbon so only a few mm. If anyone has measurements for caliber 2 truck would be much appreciated?

Caliber 50 standard trucks will only fit ONE 6364.

even 6374 or 63110 :blush:
In any case more than 2 6355 will not fit, plus they're some who don't fit the lastest 6355 by Maytech ...
Dual 6354 we know it's possible.
