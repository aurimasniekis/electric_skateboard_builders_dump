The company appears to be defunct.  Their website is a ghost town.

I'm curious about how it steers.  I saw a video of an earlier version that bent I'm the middle to curve like a train.  On this one I think the track rollers articulate to deform the belt into a cone shape.  It is controlled by leaning but it doesn't seem to physically lean over very much.

In general it seems overly complicated but it made me wonder...

Hmm?  See what I'm thinking?

Awesome concept. I really want (to build) one :slight_smile:

The company seems to be suffering from...not actually delivering anything? Vaporware? Everytime they update, they said  "shipping in (9-12 months from current date)" Starting at least in May 2010 (from their Facebook posts) Their last 3 Facebook posts were:

- Dec 2016: "works great on very soft sand ... more in January ..."

- April 2016 "It's been a while, but we haven't been standing still. Key message: shipping into Christmas 2016 looks doable. We have a few things to sort, but everything is lining up."

- June 2015: "Thanks for your patience ... here's a bit of an update. Firstly, yes, we are still alive. Tough year in 2014 but we got through and have signed a joint venture agreement with a very large Chinese manufacturer. They are a scale manufacturer shipping over a million products a year already.... The current schedule sees us shipping for Christmas next year. Actually, it'll be in stores October 2016 if we don't get any slippage. A completely revised electrical system, now 80v rather than 48v, and an almost complete mechanical re-design mean there's a lot to do. We aim to be back into testing on the revised platform by late this year."

Thanks for the info.  I live in Alaska and it's super super snowy here right now so this concept caught my attention.

Hey brother dude!  I'm down in Sitka.

I will look into what you mentioned.  It is pertinent to my interests.

Here's a pic of some chains I put on my motorcycle recently:

I found this pic that a user named Riako posted!

Did you make this board, @Riako?  Where does one get treads like that?

It looks kinda like regular tyres strapped to three small rollers.

Check out @Duffman's monster build. He's got photos and YouTube videos floating around this forum, but no build thread yet.

Or, if you can read German, I think?

Thank you,  Duffman.  I've been reading your thread that Mobutusan linked to.  You are obviously very good at making these things.  I don't read German but I will check out the forum and look at some pictures!
  I'm totally ignorant and just trying to learn.  I'll post a new thread in the appropriate section introducing myself soon.

Looks like snowblower track might be the ticket:
