I'm looking for some suspension/spring trucks for my mountain board. The only ones that I can find are from trampa boards and are ~130$ per. Is there anything a little cheaper and well known/reliable?

If you haven’t found them yet they’re talking about these ones.

Better yet, as a late Easter egg search around this forum a little bit and you’ll find a 15% discount code you can use on them.

If you make a search for ESK8BUILD15, then you should find the code. But it is well hidden, good luck finding it

Ha.  Stop teasing.  @TheRafter, in all seriousness you have two options from us.  The difference is the top truck material:

MBS Matrix II - with injection molded top truck (79.95) 

MBS **METAL** Matrix II - with aluminum top truck (99.95) - This is the one your community prefers because the top trucks are BOMB PROOF.
