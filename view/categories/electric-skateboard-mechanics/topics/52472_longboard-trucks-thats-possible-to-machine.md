I need a set of trucks that I can machine so the rear one can hold hub motors. I was looking at the Bear grizzly 852s but since I'm not to familiar with this is it common to have the axle as one unit going through the whole thing or is it more common to screw it in from both sides? The hub motor is wider than a regular wheel so I need more axle stick out.. Any other trucks that has what I'm looking for is interesting but I found a set of the grizzlys locally so if they can do the job that would be perfect :) 

Second alternative is to get a set of trucks and machine the complete lower part and get some 12.9 thread rods/bolts but if I could find a suitable finished truck that could be machined off it would be a lot less work.

Just get a set of [Surf Rodz TKP's](https://www.surf-rodz.com/content/tkp-hex-full-color-kit-10mm) and buy whatever axle length you need.  You can get the axles at [Fastenal](https://www.fastenal.com/products/details/11115166?term=12.9+shoulder+bolt&r=~%7Csattr01:%5EMetric$%7C~%20~%7Csattr05:%5E%22M8%20-%201.25%22$%7C~%20~%7Csattr06:%5E80mm$%7C~%20~%7Csattr06:%5E90mm$%7C~%20~%7Csattr06:%5E100mm$%7C~) in just about any length.

Nope, I mean TKP, they are great.  I have 2 sets, regularly do 30mph plus.

I have a buddy who hit 35mph on those trucks and dislocated both shoulders and bashed his head almost dying from the wobbles which bucked him off...riding tkp on an electric is a poor idea...

I know a dozen people that busted and street faced riding RKP's...some are better than others.  The SR TKP's are better than most, and if you take the time to tune the bussings to your riding style, stance, weight and conditions almost any quality truck can be used on an electric skateboard.

@Deckoz get in here and educate these folks...

Surf Rodz makes an 8mm version as well, and fastenal and pretty much any other large hardware supplier can get 8mm shoulder bolts.

it looks like those should bolts are 8mm threads on 10mm so does that mean 6mm on 8mm? If so I'm not sure I would feel comfortable riding those.. Wouldn't a 8mm all the way be stronger?

These...
https://www.surf-rodz.com/products/truck-parts/10-x-8mm-conversion-kit
...are 10mm shoulder bolts milled to 8mm on the outside.  They are stronger than any axle on a cast truck.  Email them, the will tell you the tolerances.

Are you sure it's not just threaded 10mm that have a 8mm shoulder bolt with 6mm axle? I also need more axle lenght than that. Prolly 60-70mm or so.. I'll send them a mail and ask.

I did make a rough sketch of the truck now and it looks quick to machine. I'm tempted to buy a set of the used Grizzlys, use the front and machine the lower part of the rear truck myself if a M8 bolt can stand up with 180mm axle width and a 100kg rider. The surf rodz will be around $180 including shipping and VAT but the grizzlys I can grab for $40 all included and machining is only time consuming.

To machine them what exactly do you mean? If you mean cut away a bit of the hanger just whip out the grinder and cut around the hanger then through the chunk you just separated. Next get a screwdriver or similar tool and put it in the gap and turn it slightly to allow the bit of aluminium to slide off the axle. Well that’s what I did at least.

Someone at Enertion made a video a while ago for how to do it so you could fit their wheel pulleys

I would throw them in the cnc mill and have it eat away some alu :D But if the axles don't go all the way through I can't do it.. I will mill away around 15-20mm on each side of the hanger so if the stock ones are seated just inside it will get really weak. If it goes all they way through it should be fine I think.

that toolpath is gonna leave a staircase finish
youre gonna need 3 operations atleast
gonna need a large chamfer endmill

ask me how I know :upside_down_face:

True, it was just the roughing :) I'll go over with a proper chamfer or a ball mill for finishing passes. The machine holds up to 3kg tools :D I think I need 5 operations to complete it, the side in the picture, bottom, top that goes into the truck and both sides to do rigid tap the M8 threads. Did you make your own? :D Would be awesome to get some good pointers so I don't go into any stupid traps if I decide to do it.

i should be making a set sometime this week, for production. the hardest part (for me atleast) is workholding. the machine I have access to definitely isnt the problem, but holding the odd shape, while milling all sides, and facing is quite a challenge
cycle time for me is 20 minutes :relaxed:

Indeed! Thats why im going with a bit square design so its easier to arrange workholding and probe the part for a cnc novice. Since it’s for production you prolly don’t want to share to much but if you ever post up some project pictures or info please let me know :)

That’s what I thought when I saw your model also. Have a look at titans of cnc (if you can survive that guy) and the video where they machine a titanium fotpeg. Some nice workholding tricks there. 

I would prolly just make this one for myself so I don’t mind fiddling some with workholding or doing it in a couple more operations than needed. 

Why did you go with 10mm axles? Is 8mm prone to breaking on 170-180mm and wider?
```

## \#27 Posted by: GrecoMan Posted at: 2018-04-16T23:38:34.524Z Reads: 118

I decided on 10mm cause 50mm of axle is exposed on mine compared to the normal 35mm on 180mm trucks. they were also designedd to be completely indestructible :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

for workholding ive decided on 3 m6 bolts holding onto a fixture plate. that will let me get it done in 5 operations. if youve got a better idea, im all ears

Got this close before I realized that I should wait to make this before I decide 100% on the front truck :D 100% sure that I have to make the lower part. It’s prolly not going to be better than something you buy but it’s something about DIY also..

Its only obvious to you.  You popped in to tell me I was wrong with no evidence to back up your theory, as you obviously didn't believe me I was pointing you to someone whom you might believe.  The fact is TKP's are great if you build them and ride them correctly.  You really should take offense so easily.

edit: found a lot of info on the page below but still I have to ask, what's the normal dimension of the pivot hole on a standard truck with a straight round pin going out from the hanger?

Yeah, this I guess is what he wants to know? I assume the bore sizes for the pivot cup differ slightly from truck manufacturer to the other. I the he’ll be happy with the bore diameter for the Caliber I truck?

## \#42 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2018-04-29T23:01:12.439Z Reads: 65

I would suggest designing a truck that uses an existing design for pivot cups to make it easier to find replacements unless there is an engineering feature that requires a different design.  When I contrast the design of the Paris II compared to the Paris Savant, the Savant with it's thicker walls seems to be a superior design and it is something we already make and readily available!

Bucked? I dont think rkp buck at all they swing or sway, so they would wobble someone off, but not buck like a tkp...they will oscillate like any truck but they do so at higher speeds and also from side to side...bucking refers to the motion of tkp trucks moving up and down literally tossing the riders feet off the deck...that's all bad dude...rkp will never do that, no matter how much its wobbling...
