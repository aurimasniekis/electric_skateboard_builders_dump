I just upgraded my motors from 1650w to 3350w but I recently broke my 6374 esk8 motor shaft, (donâ€™t ask me how, Iâ€™ve never seen or heard of a shaft breaking) the motor is under warranty but the company is only willing to send me a new shaft. I disassembled an old motor of mine and the shaft was super hard to get out, breaking a magnet in the process. The set screws were completly taken out. Does anyone know an easy way to change out the motor shaft?

what? How did you damage a magnet by taking out the shaft? 
There is a possibility that there is adhesive on the shaft holding it in the rotor.

The magnet came unglued when I was trying to tap out the shaft. When the shaft stopped moving when I was hitting it, I took a pair of vice grips and twisted it out and that took a lot of muscle. These motors are brand new and expensive so I really don't want to mess anything up.

What motor are we talking about?

I just removed two shafts yesterday.
Depending on your motor there are one or more set screws you need first to losen.
If thatâ€™s done, than just place the bell with the open part on two pieces of wood.
The shaft shouldnâ€™t touch the ground. 10-20mm space you need there.
Than just take a metal bolt and hammer the shaft out from the top. It should take not more than 4-5 hits. If you realize the shaft still not moving, double check that the set screw is out far enough.
If thatâ€™s the case the shaft is probably fixed with loctite or similar.
You can add some heat from the top with a heat gun and after the shaft should move easily.

Exactly what I did with my sk3 shaft. Make sure not to strip the grub screws, as they probably have Loctite so should be heated a bit first

Awesome, thanks guys. I should be getting my new shaft in a few days. I think that's probably the problem I ran into with my old motor when I tried to remove the shaft, is I didn't apply heat and it had loctite on it. Should I use a heat gun? Or can I use a mini torch?

I used a heat gun.
Just make sure the magnets donâ€™t get too hot.
Good way to hold them cool ist to wind a wet towel around your can.

make sure to epoxy the magnets back in the proper place.  I think home depot has some attachments to focus the heat into a small area.

Awesome, that's what I'll do. 
OK another questionðŸ˜‚ everything already has heat shrink on it, how can I remove that without having to cut it off? Sorry, pretty new at this ðŸ˜‹

The motor is already wired up to vesc with heat shrink and fiber sleeve

But thatâ€™s just 4 wires ðŸ˜…
Ok doesnâ€™t matter. If you donâ€™t want to take off the heat shrink it shouldnâ€™t be a big problem.
You anyhow will take off the bell.
The wires are on the stator with the windings and this you donâ€™t need to move.
You know how to take of the bell?

Ps: with this picture you now made me interested in knowing how you managed to break the shaft ðŸ˜…

And that i really dont know. I put the pulley on, tightened down the tire, put the belt on and made sure the belt was tight and the tire turned fairly easy then i spun it up with the motor and half the shaft and the gear goes flying across the room, goes through the drywall. I had to use a stud finder to track it down and cut it out. Im just glad it went away from meðŸ˜‹

Sounds scary ðŸ˜…ðŸ™ˆ good that nothing more happened!
Never over tighten belts.
You want them as loose as they can be, but still
tight enough to donâ€™t slip.
If you push the belt with the finger there should always be a bit play left.
