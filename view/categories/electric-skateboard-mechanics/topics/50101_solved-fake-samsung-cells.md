I paid $197.25 for 50 “Samsung INR18650-25R 2500“

What was pictured on Vruzend was this:

Did I get fake cells? Still too new to know.

Thanks

Peal the sticker off and see what's under there. Sometimes re-sellers put their own stickers on them to advertise the specs. Also. @barajabali can probably help you out here. I know for a fact that he knows those cells very well. ;)

Just going off price, those are likely real. 

You could do a capacity test with a hobby charger. Or weigh them on a scale. Simple ways to check

Yup they’re real. Once I pulled back the sticker the Samsung labeling was there.
