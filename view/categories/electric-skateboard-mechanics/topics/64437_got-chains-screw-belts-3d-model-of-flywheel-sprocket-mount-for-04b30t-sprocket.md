Salutations riders!

I´ve been riding on belt drive since day one aaaaand....f*#k it - time for some metal. I had belts that were good, some were bad and some failed after a short period. My last belt drive was decent but I was curious enough to try out a chain drive.

WHAM! I finally got it working yesterday 2am in the middle of the night. Took it out to commute and my board feels a hell of a lot more responsive. Brakes - oh my oh my oh my. I was already impressed with how the VESC manages braking but braking at higher speeds caused my belts to slip (even though I had good tension on the belt). Re-occuring slips wore down my motor pulley which resulted in even more slips and the drive deteriorated slowly but surely. Hell, the 3D printed wheel pulley looks pristine compared to the motor pulley. 

My chain drive is still not perfect yet - I need to modify my motor mount to properly adjust the chain tension. As for now, the chain is a bit loose but it´s good enough. It´s more audible than a belt drive but I´m sure the noise can be reduced to a minimum with proper chain tension. 

Sure, I could use wider belts and all (and I already had a pretty reliable belt drive on my first board) but I´m almost certain that a chain drive will ultimately be the mor reliable and cheaper option in the long run. Time will tell. I don´t care too much about noise and maintenance as much as  I care about safety and reliabilty so at the moment it´s very clear to me - **I need some metal to hit the pedal** 

Now oblivious cyclists will think it´s just another cyclist behind them when they hear the chains only to find out they´re getting owned by a lazy esk8er. Oh the fun I´ll have lol....

@Zentaria

Sure, here you go. It´s nothing too fancy. I´m really digging it! Even though the chain is pretty loose
I rode hard accelerating and braking - just the way I like it. I´m going to re-work that aluminum mount
and try to reduce noise when I get some time on my hands.

Then you will one day try direct drive and say fuck chains :) at least according to @fliess 

Were you using an idler pulley with your belt drive? Its kind of a necessity. I also like chains, but they need so much more maintenance and they are rather dirty pieces of equipment. Cheap tho. Its a real back and forth between chains and belts imo. Then someone comes with a gearbox and everyone gets screwed :)

my belt drive has an idler so belt tension was not the problem in my case. 

The motor pulley wore down and let the belt slip despite having an idler. Belt stretch contributed to the problem. I hope you can see the wear on the drive pulley.

![IMG_20180811_131539|666x500](upload://jGp6IOPUlaSSh33RrYfkxYK9pZd.jpg)

The 3d printed wheel pulley looks great in comparison.
![IMG_20180811_131923|666x500](upload://kUJAMjOBKNwg6DzHP1eFrfZeaIT.jpg)

Here's a belt that failed despite having steel reinforcement wires that couldn't deal with the load.![IMG_20180811_131635|666x500](upload://9ivA6syjkYVUeBEJAYj5fxGjt3O.jpg)

Here's my last belt that lasted quite a while but if you look closely you'll see a steel wire loop poking out of the belt. Probably contributing to the wear on the aluminium drive pulley.

*edit*
Look at the teeth - see the wear ? Notice the steel wire reflecting light between the teeth?

![IMG_20180811_131830|666x500](upload://ynDh4Gxd59TnklvM3qTIgC6SulE.jpg)

And the overall condition of the belt was getting worse with every ride.
![IMG_20180811_131725|666x500](upload://4n1CORLLBSLABBCBIp3n62wYYyr.jpg)

Sure, I could get better belts, print new pulleys etc...but honestly, I don't want to waste any more resources on belt drives.
It's just not reliable enough for my taste.

I really don't want to ever have to repair or replace anything on my drive train when I'm out riding. I'm hoping that a chain drive will solve that for me.

Looking at your pictures it seems you were using a trapezoidal tooth profile and your motor pulley has very few teeth, from what I can tell...12?

Trapezoidal profiles are supposedly having a higher load capacity than the more popular HTD profile, but they do tend to skip teeth way more. And the higher load carrying capacity is offset by your motor pulley being too small, the fatigue loading was quite severe on your belts. To be honest all belts would suffer with a 12 tooth pulley. Chain on the other hand will only have a severe linear speed variation with a small sprocket (vibrations), not as bad since it wont be a catastrophic failure (it will just tend to get streched faster than intended), but still, wear is increased significantly.

yeah, good observation...motor pulley has 12 teeth. 

I was trying to keep my build as small as I could and I decided to use a sk3 5065 236kv. To ensure good torque I went with a 12:36 (1:3) ratio (and help the motor cope with the load)

I do have a 168kv 6347 SK3 sitting in the drawer but I dont feel like using it atm. maybe on my next build...

thanks for elaborating. I'll keep this in mind for my next build.

Salutations riders!

I looked at how cyclists prepare their chains to keep them efficient and clean. It seems that dipping the chain 
in melted paraffin wax is one of the preferred methods by cyclists. It´s supposed to keep dirt and gunk away (dry lube). The method seems to be worth a try but perhaps for another time. I chose to go with the easier option and bought some "Squirt" chain lube.

Here´s a video on the "Squirt" chain lube. What do you guys think? Could a chain drive be more efficient than a belt drive? I already hear a difference with the lube applied to my chain - it´s more quiet.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SVHgy0oLFg

First things first - a clean chain. Before applying "Squirt" the chain must be free of dirt, gunk and factory grease.I let the chain soak overnight to get rid of any factory grease and dirt. I found a small plastic bottle which was perfect for the job. The alcohol dissolved a lot of factory grease and there was a fair bit of very fine dust that washed out of the rollers (brand new chain - just ca. 6km ride on it prior to cleaning) 


that´s what I washed out of a brand new chain !:scream:
![IMG_9111|690x460](upload://5SQT5voEfELh06Xt7BZSJWpTDDr.jpg)

aaaahhh - nice and shiney. that´s more like it.

and the complete drive ready to get lubed :grinning:
![IMG_9215|690x387](upload://3SOUFMTfUKKUbwqeUXRjTTYQUNW.jpg)

Can´t wait to test the new motor mount (now I can adjust the chain tension) with the "Squirt" lube.
The drive train should be noticeably quieter now that the chain has proper tension so it won´t be slapping around. I was getting roughly 12-13km on my belt drive so I´m excited to see if a chain drive really is more efficient. There are a bunch of cyclists swearing by this product and they feel the difference (since they actually do the work) - so my hopes are high...

let you guys know what I find out.

I got my stuff from **[Conrad ](https://www.conrad.at/de/rollenketten-zubehoer-o1210057.html)** but I made the mistake of buying the wheel sprocket with an 8mm bore (you don´t have any other option from Conrad). I thought it would be easy to drill a bigger hole to fit a caliber hanger but it was impossible for me to do it at home with my tools.

I suggest you get the wheel sprocket from [**Gears and Sprockets**](https://www.gearsandsprockets.co.uk/simplex-sprockets/) and choose a custom bore size of 25mm. They´ll ship you a sprocket that will already have 25mm hole that will fit a caliber hanger.If you want to save shipping then you could just buy everything from Gears and Sprockets. Just make sure you choose the right bore size for your motor sprocket (I´m using a SK3 5065 - so I have a 6mm axle).

they also have all kinds of **[chain](https://www.gearsandsprockets.co.uk/bs-simplex-roller-chain/)** sizes. Make sure you get the chain links that go with your choice. Unfortunately, I only discovered Gears and Sprockets **after** I already bought a 04B chain and sprockets. I´m pretty sure it will be fine but I´d go for at least a 05B in hindsight specially if you´re heavier or you ride hard and you man handle your board.

I dropped a few drops of "Squirt" on an old aluminium motor mount to see and feel the solidified state of the lube. It definately feels like wax but just a bit more creamy - I was able to smudge it around a bit and it did´nt feel sticky at all. So I don´t see a reason why I should prepare my chain in hot paraffin wax at the moment **(BIG YAY!**) I do believe that my chain will stay fairly clean with this lube now that I got to see and feel it :grinning:  

I´m also thinking about cleaning my bearings and replacing the bearing grease with "Squirt". If this stuff is really good then it could save me a few watts that I else lose to friction/heat and maybe potentially increase my range. I´m also hoping that my bearings and wheels stay cleaner since the lube I used tended to leak out and attract a lot of dirt. The watts I´ll gain will probably not be that dramatic but hey, a few watts here...a few watts there...who knows right?  

Here are a few pics of solidified "Squirt" under room temperature. I just used a toothpick to ilustrate the consistency of the lube. Here ya go...

@Jmding
I dug around to find a source in the US (well, at least they have their HQ in Charlotte, NC - USA) here´s what I found. They have a 05B sprocket with 30 teeth  which is just flat (without hub) and it comes with a 10mm pre-drilled hole **[check it out here](https://www.ptintl.com/products/power-transmission-components/sprockets/05b/05b-125a)** (hole/shaft diameter varies with the amount of teeth your sprocket has)

Get some metric **[step up drill bits](https://www.amazon.com/Migiwata-Titanium-Reusable-Cutting-Aluminum/dp/B071PBNHMX/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1534342313&sr=8-2&keywords=metric+step+up+drill+bit)** like this if you have access to a drill press and drill a bigger hole to suit your needs. A 20mm bore is _juuust_ enough for a Caliber II and Paris hanger but I´d at least drill a 22mm hole. I could´nt get through 15mm of steel on my first sprocket which had an 8mm bore. It was just too much for my drill bits and they got dull pretty fast (that´s when I decided to purchase a pre-drilled sprocket and save me time and troubles). You may have a good chance to get through a few milimeters of steel before your bits get dull. Don´t forget to lubricate your bit and choose the right RPM for steel on your drill.

hope this helps

Any thoughts on iso 04b vs ansi #25? I imagine for you 04b is much more available, but it looks to me like the #25 might be a tiny bit beefier and maybe a little more reliable?

A 04B chain has a tensile strength of around 300kg. I'm pretty sure that a 04B chain will suffice. I think that we never really generate so much force on a street board. The moments where high tension is generated is when accelerating or braking. Cruising will have lower tensile loads.

I assume that the tension while accelerating is at it's peak is when the board is at a complete standstill. As soon as the board starts moving the tension on the chain decreases. I think that other components such as motor, (v)esc or even batteries will fail due to increased amp demand before you actually reach 300kg tensile load on the chain (btw. 300kg is not even the max. load  the chain can take so you'll have to generate more than that to break the chain.)

It's probable that the same applies when we hit the brakes. As speed decreases so does the tensile load. So in a scenario where you're going very high speeds and you hit full brakes you'll likely get thrown off your board before your chain fails.

So, that's why I think that the issue with chains is not the tensile strength (well, starting from a useable tensile strength of course. In this case 300kg) but rather it's mechanical durability.

The question is not "is it going to fail?" but "when is it going to fail?" 

So, now that begs the question "which material/steel is the best for this application?". I can't say any facts about the different materials that are being used maybe someone else can elaborate on this matter.

I just read that a #25 chain has a tensile strength at around 480kg. That is a whole lot more, more than a 3rd that of a 04B chain. So you'll be without a doubt be on the safer side when it comes to tensile strength. But I'm convinced that the material used, steel vs stainless steel...hardened steel etc. will be the determining factor how long your chain will hold. Is a softer steel better for the longevity or will a harder=more brittle chain be the better choice? I think a "softer" steel will withstand the vibrations better than a "harder" steel that occur in this application. I imagine a brittle chain could "snap" due to loads that weaken the material whereas a softer steel may start to stretch as it weakens thus making a failure not so dramatic in comparison. Take a look at a katana sword for example. The cutting edge is a brittle but of a more harder steel. Since it's prone to break the rest of the sword is made with a softer steel to prevent the sword from shattering. Makes sense to me to apply the same logic to the chains we want to use.

Sorry for the long post but I was thinking a lot about this matter. I'm grateful for any information, experiences or thoughts about chains in our application and I'm sure so are other .

Yeah, hardened teeth vs not hardened for example. Tbh, I think the most likely mode of failure will be corrosion and thinning metal due to wear. That is to say, chain drive should effectively be infinite life.

I'm a little worried that our drive sprockets will be too small, 9 ish tooth sprockets with only 3-4 teeth engaged. Not sure if that would be problematic or not, but suspect not really

I went completely away from metal drive sprockets - they just require too much lube diligence to be practical.  I went over to POM (Delrin specifically) and have never looked back.

To this day I'm amazed that no matter how much power I push through what is essentially a plastic sprocket I've never broken one and see no indication of wear.

The lube, in this case, is for the chain joints, not the chain-cog interaction, and therefore is much less critical.

I agree, material wear is the "enemy" here. I also agree that the drive sprocket will suffer the most from wear but I don't think it's prone to total failure. I'm sure the wear will be audible when it occurs as tolerances increase and cause the chain to "slap" around. Second to wear down will be the chain and last the wheel sprocket.

I think the only way to know for sure is to check, let's say every 500km, and see how much wear has occured on the whole drive. I'm not too worried about corrosion especially in summer but corrosion protection will be an issue when it gets wet. Maybe a chain drive cover will be needed in wet conditions as an additional protective measure. 

I'll give that a thought when I have the need for it (I don't enjoy riding in wet conditions anyway).

Delrin drive sprocket? Never heard or seen one before. It's interesting that it's holding up. 

@DougM 
Where did you get it from? How long has it been working? How do you ride? agressive? moderate? Ya got hills in your area?

*edit
Jmding beat me to the question on where you got your sprocket from.*

Just asking cause I'm curious how a plastic drive sprocket can take that load...I'm impressed. I can imagine that also brings the dreaded noise down a bit? I don't mind the noise but it did get the attention of a few dogs. That was not such a biggie with my belt drive.

@Jmding
 I could print a wheel sprocket given time - for science of course. I'm just in doubt that PLA or ABS is up to the task. I think PLA is too brittle. Carbon PETG might work but my printer will require upgrades for that material.

Looks like sdp-si stocks delrin and fiberglass/nylon composite sprockets for $5. Killer! 

Why not straight petg? I think if we kind of "hack" the slicer so the Extrusion orientation is radial (rather than going concentric after clearing the teeth), it could be really strong

It looks to me like it can handle linear and concentric, but not radial.  Shouldn't be too hard to hack, you could cut a n-tooth sprocket into n pie-slices and position then together with 0.01mm air-gap between them, or something like that.

Not hacking the gcode, but finding a "hacky" workaround that forces the slicer to slice the shape with a more optimal extrusion orientation.  I'll draw a picture later on by what I mean.

btw, i dont think carbon petg would help much:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z3Nq4hwKgs

adhesion is worse than standard filaments, and I think that is going to be the bigger problem with printed components.  Its so "easy" to print one in regular PETG to start, we should try that out and see if it fails.

 Torque load will be perpendicular to extrusion orientation so you dont have to rely on extrusion-to-extrusion bond strength.

You're gonna have a ton of abrasion issues with that kind of tooth profile.

Normal metal sprockets have angled edges of the teeth to help with slight misalignment. With flat sides, any kind of imperfection will lead to the edge of the chain digging into the side of the sprocket and wearing off material.

Also, that does not look like the proper #25 chain tooth profile. You'll have more wear issues with the chain rolling off of the sprocket from the pins catching on the backside of the tooth on the loose side of the chain that isn't under load.

Even aluminum sprockets will wear down fast, so you're going to need very good alignment.

My standard is 11 tooth.  I can post all the files (somewhere) if you want to take a look.  

in answer to your other questions:
How long has it been working? - I've got 3 boards, one is dual 6355's and the single is a 6380 but was a 6375 most of its life.  I'd say that on those boards the sprockets have been running for 2 summers.  
How do you ride? agressive? moderate? - Moderate to easy.  I used to be more moderate but after my last crash I've backed off a bit.
Ya got hills in your area? - I've done short hill climbs - steep ones with the dual motor but I've not done sustained hills often.  I did a 26 mile run on the 6375 board, so I'm confident they'll go the distance.

I don't think you're going to have any luck 3D printing sprockets - The #25 chain only allows for 0.120" teeth and I just don't think anything additive is going to be strong enough at the teeth nor at the set screws.

Thanks for the info. I did´nt have any problems with drilling holes on my second sprocket from "gears and sprockets". And the 25mm pre-drilled hole through the hub saved me a lot of time and trouble. Everything went fine...

My first wheel sprocket from "Conrad" was a b*#ch though. I wasted all my step up drill bits on that sprocket now I´m hoping that at least I can use it on plastics and wood...maybe even on some softer aluminium. I also killed a 3.5mm drill bit while drilling through that son of a b*#ch sprocket :face_with_symbols_over_mouth::sob::roll_eyes:

thanks for sharing ! 

Seems quite a bit of work...good results! I read through your thread - very impressive! Now that I have slept over the idea of printing plastic sprockets, I realised that I would be investing time again in something that is unnecessary. I have´nt got a chance to try out the new drive train. My board ist sitting there with full cells waiting to get man handled...but I have my duties first...pleasure and fun later! 

So I´ll enjoy the rest of this summer with my new chain drive and possibly postpone making plastic sprockets for colder winter days.

So...**this drive can take abuse!** really heavy accelerations and braking and what can I say...I´m soooo glad I decided to switch to a chain drive.

Heres what I can definately say.

**pros**
* absolutely no slipping
* reliable power transfer from motor to chain to wheels and to the ground.
* way less friction than a belt drive - easier to push when necessary (empty cells)
* high pitch noise audible to pedestrians - they know your coming and get out of the way
* uphill climbs are not limited by your belt anymore  

**cons**

* dirt collected on the chains after first ride with "Squirt" applied (no biggie - gotta observe how bad it gets)
* noise - cops *will* notice you so be prepared for that. yes it´s loud.


The noise isn´t that bad. I noticed that pedestrians were not as annoyed compared with a belt drive. I don´t know why...maybe the high pitch reminds them of a high power vehicle and they automatically "respect" that and move to the side. That being said, I give them back the courtesy and pass them in a civilized manner meaning I slow down to a safe speed especially when I see kids. It makes accelerating even more impressive when you give them a good look at your board!  :sunglasses::laughing:

I've been using the 25H 14:27 Banggood chain and sprockets for over a year. Started out with belt but tired very fast of all the slipping. Bought a 10 tooth sprocket and, ofc, the acceleration improved and everything, but the noise increased dramatically. Ultimately, I went back to the 14 tooth to get rid of the noise. Now I have vesc heat troubles instead ;P Looking for buying 12 tooth now :) 

I also 3D printed the wheel sprocket in Nylon, 33 teeth. Nylon has lower surface friction than petg and is very durable. Ofc, the chain is not supposed to slide on the sprocket but still rubs against the sides occasionally. Used concentric setting with like 6 wall-layers. 0.1 layer height. Used a belt grinder afterwards to fix soft edges on the teeth. After 60+ km there is no sign of wear.

Had a bad accident this spring as I was accelerating up a hill and the motor sprocket suddenly came loose. Hard fall in 29,6 km/h so make sure that everything is tight and secure! Loctite is a must.

My wheel sprocket has a **30mm hub**. This is  important because if you want to use this with flywheels then **it´s very important that you work very precisely** 

First of all, make sure that your sprocket hub (if it has one) is 30mm in diameter. **Life is easier if your sprocket does not have a hub** (in which case you need a spacer according to your chains dimensions so you chain is not rubbing against the wheel).

![IMG_9566|690x460](upload://fk8A6qO9pUxt23jpqeOSSjNhwNf.jpg)

The M4 holes (I used a 4.5mm drill bit) are touching the sprocket hub so there is not much space for mistakes. On top of that, you need to make sure that the holes are precisely 60° appart. BTW. this is the sprocket with an 8mm pre-bore that ruined my step-up drill bit. You can see my pathetic attempt documented in the pictures. The actual sprocket I´m using has a 25mm pre drilled hole in the hub - [see in this picture](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7d70f8648a63cf9fb49af681980411d74f650e57.jpg) I posted above.
![IMG_9568|690x460](upload://fpMDAOmjNS0X4p0Gc6eMjQNJLOG.jpg) 

Then you´ll need an adapter for the flywheel like this one.

When all is done correctly you should have a perfectly aligned wheel sprocket that is already correctly spaced
to accommodate the chain.

In the process of ordering parts, will update as I get farther along.

As a quick note, when searching for sprockets, ANSI naming convention for a #25, hubless, 30 tooth sprocket is 25A30.  A #35, 15 tooth sprocket with a hub would be 35B15

Boring out a sprocket is going to be quite difficult without just a hand drill, but I think I can 3d print a jig that will make it possible by drilling 16x 1/4" holes.  That's going to be fun...

Going to go with 9:27, a little worried about noise and ground clearance, but we will have to see.  Could go with a lower Kv motor which would help with both of those issues, but would reduce max torque by about 12%.  Nah...

You could reconnect the spools in the motor to a star configuration instead of the original delta configuration. This will lower the kv-rating with a 1.73 factor. I did that to my SK3 motor, reducing the kv from 245 to 142. Took a few hours but its an easy mod.

If you take two otherwise identical motors just with different Kvs (achieved by turn count, not winding configuration), and you gear them to the same top speed, they will produce the same torque.  The lower Kv motor will just waste more electrical energy as heat since it will have more turns and thinner wire.

Interesting idea with that re-wind.  What are the disadvantages of going star?

yes. lower kv = more torque. in a city-commute scenario I definitely prefer a board with torque and a short wheelbase to carve my way through and with just enough speed to leave cyclists behind. i rarely hit top speeds...its mostly stop and go. a quick start when the lights turn green is just soooo satisfying. thats why i went with a chain drive because the last thing i wanna do is repair my board while im on my way to work.

To my knowledge there is no difference when it comes to performance between a delta configured motor and a star configured motor with the same kv-rating and the same weight of copper in the windings. It is just two ways to do the same thing ^^

For me the reconfiguration meant that I could increase the torque with a 1.73 factor without having to change the gear ratio.

NVM, no free lunch.  Star windings effectively have more turns as the current runs through two of the three phases at once, rather than just one of the phases as in delta.  Hence with the same diameter wire and same number of turns, star will have higher wire resistance and lower current capability, but lower kv as well.  I'm not certain, but I think its something like 1/2 the current capacity, and 59% the Kv.  So net probably not a good trade off

yes, sprockets without hubs. strangely, they dont seem to have 04b 30 teeth without hubs. if you need a 30 teeth sprocket without a hub then it seems you need to go for 05b. you also have more options teeth-count wise with the 05b which means more flexibilty in gear ratio choice and a stronger chain on top of that. 

just make sure that if youre using motors with a 6mm shaft that your motor sprockets bore actually fits. i just checked and found out that the min. standard bore is 8mm for a 05b 10 teeth...so youre outta luck here if you are using motors with a 6mm shaft.

i noticed my chain was not aligned properly so I re-aligned it. that should improve noise levels, efficiency and longevity.

*edit*
btw. the chain is pretty clean after a few rides. i had to wipe off excess  "Squirt" from the chain after the first ride but appart from that my drive is clean. What bugs me though is that my motor sprocket gets loose now and then. just a minor issue tho...chain seem to vibrate more and loosen up the grub screw.

Many large synchronous motors are started using a star configuration. Once the motor has sufficient RPM the windings is changed to delta. In this way, the motor will consume less current during start-up (due to the increase of resistance between the motor phases) and exhibit larger start-up torque. The windings is changed to delta to reach the motor speed it is designed for.

It is true that a star configured motor will get hotter than a delta configured motor with the same current. However, to output the same torque, only 1/sqrt(3) = 57.8 % of the current is needed in the star configuration compared to the delta configuration. So you can effectively lower the motor current setting in bldc-tool. :slight_smile:

I just created a 'Sprocket Generator' using OpenSCAD. You can find it on Thingiverse.
[Sprocket Generator V2 - OpenSCAD](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3059422)

This can easily be used to design a sprocket for your application and be downloaded directly as a .stl file used in slicing software for 3D-printing.

@haand22
thanks for the sprocket generator! thats useful for prototyping and trying out gear ratios!

rewiring the motor from delta to star is an interesting idea. im still trying to wrap my head around it. a "star" motor requires less current for the same amount of torque compared to a "delta" motor. this is true at lower rpm? meaning it will have more "starting" torque correct? at higher rpm the "star" motor gets hotter (?) = less efficient (the reason for switching to "delta" once higher rpm is reached).

i can see the advantage at lower rpm but how will it effect efficiency at higher rpm in our application? i recall reading motors reaching peak efficiency at around 8000 rpm. most of all how will the VESC be effected with a "star" motor. is there a risk it will blow the VESC?
```

First of all, the big trade-off between star and delta is torque vs. motor speed. The star configured motor will only spin 1/sqrt(3) as fast as the delta motor due to the lower kv rating. Instead it will have sqrt(3) times the torque throughout the operating range for the same current. So you might decrease your top speed ^^

Star or delta doesn't really matter when it comes to efficiency in terms of motor speed. The motor will have roughly the same peak efficiency at the same electrical rpm (no the same as rpm or mechanical rpm). 

Vedder writes:
> Now we know that copper losses are proportional to the square of the torque produced by the motor, and at low RPM and high load they are dominant. As RPM increases, other losses start to add up exponentially. In my experience, these losses start to get significant around 60k electrical RPM, which for a 14-pole motor is about 8570 mechanical rpm (most 50mm+ outrunners have 14 poles, some unusual ones have 18). Because of the square relation, it is desirable to run at as high speed and low torque as possible as long as we stay below 8.6k RPM

So just make sure that your max e-rpm setting in bldc is below like 68 krpm ^^

Speaking of efficiency: Power losses is highly associated with current. Ohm's law says P_{loss} = U * I = R * I^2. Heat losses increases squared with current so reducing the current (lower kv) will increase the efficiency as less heat in generated.

The vesc can't possible sense if the motor is star or delta. You will have to perform a new motor detection ofc to find the new winding resistance, induction etc. for the new configuration. I have been running star since May and it works like a charm!

I had hard accelerations as always (just the way I love riding) so I was´nt riding and trying to save energy. and now my calves still hurt a bit from yesterday :rofl: what can i say, i´m getting old and i´m obviously not used to riding 13km :sweat_smile:
