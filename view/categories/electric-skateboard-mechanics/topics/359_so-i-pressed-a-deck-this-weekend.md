For those of you who didn't already see it on my instagram: I was finally able to press a deck this weekend. After months of struggle and agony and sacrifice and sorrow and a bloody pinched pinky finger, I finally have a 7 ply Rock Hard Maple (Acer saccharum) prototype of my new deck design. Below is a picture of the rough cut (prior to sanding or drilling or finishing of any kind at all. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/53287b053f529851de4db84b6ffa7a68888537c7.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

40" total with a currently unknown and potentially adjustable wheelbase in excess of 26", so this thing will support Space Cells as well as larger 12S cell stacks/groups

Its a little different than what you're probably used to, but that's the thing about decks: they're all completely different and filled with lovely unique flavor. You might notice the presence of a subtle w-cave dome between where the front and back trucks will be. It feels amazing on my bare feet and i think it will also help combat the foot tingles a little when standing for long rides in shoes by giving you some options to shift your feet around on different pressure points. It should also stiffen the deck substantially within the box zone. 

Here's the wooden hydraulic press I made out of fence timbers and a pair of 2-ton jacks with the mold I had CNCed sitting in the bottom of it. those blocks under the jacks aren't used, they're just sitting there.

I just ordered some clear grip tape and hopefully this week i can stain it, polish it up and start figuring out the process for making esk8 electronics boxes for it. Since the deck isn't flat on the bottom because of the dome, I'm going to attempt to set up a vacuum table mold using an uncut deck as the table so that the hot ABS will follow the curves when it flumps down. I'm not going to be able to use a conventional oven for this because i think the abs frame is going to be way too wide, so wish me luck building a DIY hot box to droop plastic.

looking sweet! 

so with that just being a prototype, will your final iteration have the corners sanded down a little; that way they are more of a gentle curve instead of a point?

 Obviously with making the deck yourself you could vary the style from deck to deck, but I was just wondering.

Whenever you decide to start selling them, I think I might need one!

What you're seeing there is just the fresh cut with my jig saw. I was too excited to wait to take the picture. lol

Yesterday evening  i sanded the edges down to the line with a handheld belt sander and took the points off the corners with an orbital sander.  It still has the hard angles but the corners are softer and so are the edges. I thought about fully rounding the edges like everyone else does, but i think I like the idea of a boxy edge as long as its smooth and slightly rounded. I need some better sanding gear tough, and more practice to achieve better consistency.  

There is definitely going to be subtle variances between decks because these things are made completely by hand. I don't have a robot cutting these out. Also, I'm pretty sure I can create a number of cutout shapes that will work with this mold. I have several in mind already, and one of them vaguely resemble's @onloop 's recent design that included a more angular hourglass shape. Sometimes I think he accesses my brain while i'm sleeping and goes to work on stuff he finds in there. It would be convenient for him because of the time difference. I'm usually asleep while he's in his mad science skate lab doing who-knows what with all manner of fringe science equipment.

That looks pretty sweet, dude.  What made you choose the press method versus the vacuum method?  I've been wanting to make my own deck for a while now, and I've been leaning towards a vacuum setup because it seems a lot simpler, and I don't have the space for a deck press.  I've been wondering if I'd be able to do it with a large flat vacuum storage bag since they're cheap.  Has anyone tried that here?  I've seen kits online as well, but obviously they're more expensive.

@claudiofiore88 I decided not to go with the bag method early on because i knew i wanted more than just a typical concave. Bags are really really good at the standard concave, especially on trick decks and longer variations of those like bustin's YOFACE, and of course any cutout shape you can think of that uses that standard concave, and of course the even more basic concave used in pintails and other more traditional longboards. I read in a number of places that I would have a lot more difficulty with more exotic profiles (think w-cave and bacon) like I wanted to use. 

I wanted something different. My initial design had harder angles on the wings than this, and the tail was more abrupt. It was also more of a tub and didn't have that soft w-dome that makes my feet sing broadway tunes. While what I ended up with *may* have worked with a bag, i'm fairly certain my initial design would have failed in a bag, so i abandoned that method and started on my first hand made mold which failed terribly and sent me into a fugue state for weeks on end in which i lamented my failures as a maker. Then the guy from Marwood Veneer called me out of the blue wanting pictures of my new decks. I confessed my inadequacies, and he hooked me up with a CNC guy.  

Once I had a guy who CNCs wooden deck molds, I ended up with larger radiuses on the wings and the tail after consulting through several cad drawing iterations with him. It still has the same flavor, but with his guidance I was able to create something that plays much nicer with this tough ass maple veneer. 

Another reason I went with a mold is because I can stack them in the press. My current press can't do this, but i plan on building another, bigger, stronger Monster Clamp that will take as many as three of these molds in a stack and of course use much larger jacks. I probably won't do that though until i sell a few of these and hone my process as a whole. It could happen sooner if this Monster Clamp flies apart though. It likes to creak a lot. 

Also, believe it or not: space constraints. While Monster Clamp seems like an unwieldy beast of pressure treated wood and steel bolts, It's only a foot deep. It lives along the wall of my garage and can happily keep a deck (or eventually two or three) pressing for hours on end with both cars parked next to it. I don't have anywhere to set up a table for multiple bags for long periods of time. I basically have to fight a wife and baby for working space, so I've claimed the garage that we both park in.

That was a lengthy reply. lol What do mean by W concave or bacon profile.  Is that anything like a regular trick deck profile?  Is Marwood veneer a local supplier?  Seems like a nice guy to just call you out of the blue about your project like that and to recommend a cnc guy.  Almost every tutorial for how to build a longboard deck I've seen always use or recommend baltic birch vs maple.  I know almost all trick decks are made of maple, so I'm not sure why baltic birch would be a better choice. For press versus vacuum, is there any difference in the end product like strength or their ability to withstand delaminating better? Also do you alternate the grain direction each ply?

Mate! Love it... 

I am a big fan of the angular shapes. Somehow it manages to give it a modern-retro feel. 

Yes I do enter your mind and steal ideas when you are sleeping... dont worry i tread gently.... you don't even know what you have in store for yourself yet... bwahahahaha

Unlike a regular concave like on a trick deck, a w concave on a longboard has a hump down the center from front to back. It was invented mainly for sliding if i recall correctly, but it can also give you some extra leverage when turning at speed.  Its usually subtle and often narrow. Mine is more of a bubble hump than narrow hump providing more flat surface on top of the hump to help mitigate the issues you experience when pushing. Here's a few on muirskate to look at:
 https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/all/w-concave

bacon has a weird flexy ripple to the edge and across its surface. Its kind of interesting. Its like an earworm for me, but skateboard. I'm always thinking about it:
 https://www.muirskate.com/products?keywords=bacon

Maybe baltic is a little more flexible and does better in a bag? I'm not 100% on the differences or impact on board quality. I chose rock maple because its the industry standard and is as tough as it gets. I know different woods have different ride flavors and flexiness to them, so maybe there is just a widely shared personal preference for baltic. 

Marwood Veneer is not local to me. Nobody around here would give me a good price on veneer, so i had to go online. They have incredible customer service and are always looking for pictures of things people make with their products. Great prices too. You can check them out here:
http://www.marwoodveneer.com/skateboards-longboards/

I'm not sure about the advantages of one process over the other where lamination/delamination are concerned. From my understanding both work really well, but i know in large presses you can definitely get much higher that 14.7 psi which is all you're ever going to get with a TAP bag. I don't know what that means in a practical application though. Also I've seen people do just fine with just a bunch of regular carpenter type clamps. My very first attempt was with 5 homemade clamps on my previous mold and lamination was good except for a few areas where the mold wasn't up to snuff. 

You definitely want to criss cross the grains. The materials kit you can get from marwood comes with three kinds of ply. Face ply, Core ply, and Cross ply. Face is sanded and is for the outside. It's the part you see. Core has the same grain direction as Face, but its not sanded and is a little tougher. Cross is the same as Core except that the grain goes from side to side rather than top to bottom. When stacking the layers, you stack Face, Core, Cross, Core, Cross, Core, Face. This gives it that strength and tail pop you see on commercial decks.

Thanks! Now i just have to iron out the box problem. Last night I ordered a bunch of m3 socket cap screws and some m3 t nuts to mount them. I saw a guy on youtube make his own "oven" from wood and reflective heat insulation. It was shaped like a square funnel and had the heat source in the bottom where it was narrow, and the top was the width of the frame he needed. I think i'm going to go in that direction because i found a great heat source while I was out buying milk. 

I can get two heating elements with 110v power supply, timer, switch, and temp levels for $60 at walmart. How cool is that? For some reason they call them Toaster Ovens instead of Electric Skateboard DIY Box Forming Cooker Element Kits, but whatever.

ordered some more parts for this bad boy: 

 - dual enertion 190kv motors, mounts, pulleys
 - torqueboards 12S ESCs in a dual config
 - gt2b remote from hobby king
 - bad wolf gt2b mod v2 from shapeways in polished red plastic
 - caliber II 184mm blackout 50deg trucks 
 - venom double barrels, 90a, red
 - 83mm 80a red flywheel clones
 - bones reds bearings w/ spacers
 - bag of 1 1/4" truck bolts w/ nuts
 - 10mm m3 socket caps for the box
 - m3 t-nuts for the box

(edit) also.. for aesthetics ...

 - clear grip tape
 - LHB logo decal in black standard vinyl die cut for under the clear grip (will be placed on solid white stencil painted background so you can clearly see it through the clear grip). 
 - 3" vinyl logo stickers to toss in the box when I ship it to whoever buys this steez machine and also to put all over my wife's car and everything else

my logo for reference:

The final look of this thing .. as @onloop implied.. will be very 80's retro future. In fact i'm sort of going for the old Powell flavor from when I was a kid. My very first board was a Vision Punkskulls which bears a shocking yet non-coincidental resemblance to my cutout shape, but i always loved the Powel aesthetic. 

still poking around looking for a good price on some gasket material in the 10" x 26" size range to use with the box i haven't made yet.  If anyone has any ideas about a good place to hunt for sheets or rolls of either black or red rubber in that size range, let me know.

Thanks guys! I've been getting some pretty positive feedback on the logo in general, so I feel pretty good about it. I just got confirmation that my die cuts and stickers will be shipped in a couple weeks, so i'm hoping to have my very first complete up for sale on my new site by the end of November, along with a couple of deck and box options including just the unmodified decks for use with push boards or for people who want to hack it their own way (can't imagine anyone around here would want to hack anything!) I'm probably going to give my oldest sons a couple of non-electro decks for Christmas with some caliber IIs and a set of These whites on them. My oldest has been drooling over my deck design since i showed him the drawings earlier this year.

@kai Thanks bro! 

interesting tidbit: The character in that logo is featured in a comic i drew (11 episodes) back in 2011. It got buried in my current blog site but will be pretty easy to get to on my new site. He works at a catfood factory in the comic and is sort of an engineer. At some point he will have new adventures in a skate lab i'm sure.

If anyone wants his contact info, PM me. I asked him if i could give it out and he said he was cool with me spreading the word. "I got kids to feed" i think is what he said. Don't we all.

Just wanted to update this thread with the progress I made this past weekend. I was able to add in the motor plugs for the rear wheels and the electronics/box area. Here's the pictorial:

First I took some measurements and drew out the channels with a pencil after drilling the holes all the way through for the plugs. On my 6S build, i did this from the bottom side. This time I'm doing it from the top so that this beautiful wood can be preserved on the bottom while any ugliness left over from the process will be covered in paint and grip tape.  

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/cf0748a0a2270a6ff2fcb5ec89210f4e7e0cdcfe.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Then I got my dremel and went to work on the channels. After that was done, I epoxied the connectors into place. Last time i soldered all the connectors to their wires before placing them into the deck. That was a huge pain in the ass. This way was a lot easier. Also, one side effect of soldering the plugs after epoxying them is that it gives you a second chance to finely tune the plugs' alignment. I was able to make the height of the plugs more even when they were hot from the solder because the melted the epoxy into a gooey state that allowed me to slide them up and down slightly before they hardened into place again. This was awesome because i couldn't get them as even as i wanted simply by holding them for five minutes until the epoxy gelled up.  Next time i'll have to make a jig for the plugs to align them even more perfectly. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4cb143c63b06d42a1e9a11787a884b24b6514c8f.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Here's the bottom side with the plugs in place. My plan is to fabricate some right angle connectors for those posts that will be inside the enclosure. That will allow me to keep the box as low as the space cell and VESC without worrying about stressing connectors. Last time i had leads wires with plugs on the ends just coming directly out of the wood, which resulted in some ugliness as well as some inflexibility of placement for the ESC. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c7c77048cd234aaad0f0a5f4a8abff3f5c9bc2e0.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

After the channel was good and the plugs were fastened in, i soldered in the wires (while making some minor adjustments to the plug heights) and filled the whole thing slightly over the edge with polyester resin. One day soon i'm going to get some West Systems stuff, but for now i'm trying to use up my Bondo.  

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/cec2de5a3704b07488e417160aa98d252ea34ca7.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Once the resin hardened into plastic i sanded it down smooth with the deck and re-applied some wood stain around the edges that got hit with the sander. After that I masked off the edges so i'd have a nice border once painted.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d5d85e1c8f0b1435f482a6a2b83fd3e3fc34e150.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

here's another shot of the underside of the deck after the resin hardened but before i taped the deck.

then i painted the top. That white triangle is where my logo will go, then some polyurethane over the whole board and some clear grip tape on top.

it would be a waste to use west systems epoxy for something like that anyways bro. i use it cause i need the 207 hardener that dries super clear for nice finish. but i guess you cant really use to fast of a hardener cause it will generate more heat and might affect the glue. looking sweet bro

i'll just leave this here.....

https://www.instagram.com/p/-q5c8IhBoZ/?taken-by=longhairedboy

full disclosure:
i totally and irreparably messed up the deck that this thread started out with by placing the box-side motor plugs way too close to where the motors would be. As gorgeous as it is, i can't use it for an electric build lol.

so while i was lamenting that before pressing another one to start over, i decided to make a last minute shape change due to my feet telling me that the wings weren't wide enough to rise above that sexy hump in the middle. So i made it look like a freakin' stealth bomber. problem solved. 

All that being said, this is the new Scarlet.

thanks! i finally have consistency in shape i'm getting from the mold, so i'm hoping to be able to use a blank to create a form for the boxes very soon. 

it also helped that i added some tiny, slightly dulled nails to the center points at both ends of one half of the mold. No more guessing about where the center is. Now all i have to do is draw a line between the two divots at each end of the blank and i have an instant center line centered to the mold shape and not the veneer.  

if anyone is thinking of having a wooden press mold made, i would strongly advise doing that. It takes ALL of the guesswork out of where the center is, so from popping it out of the press to lining up and taping your cutout template takes seconds instead of many minutes.

also, this one is @cmatson 's. For real this time. lol

Nice to someone pressing decks! Invest in a good glue spreader when you get a chance it will save a ton of time. Spend around $300, the cheap ones perform poorly in comparison.

how do these spreaders work? got a good youtube link handy? i'm always looking for ways to streamline this.  

for reference, at the moment i'm using a $13 paint roller and teflon pan. cleanup is 5 minutes and i can ziplock the roller for reuse up to a few days later to save glue. charging a roller takes almost as much glue as one side of veneer. a gallon of tightbond III is $27, so i try to be scroogey with it. 

is a good spreader more efficient with the glue? how's the cleanup? i can only press one at a time right now with a press time of about 6 hours before pulling out the blank and letting it cure over night before cutting, so glueing time isn't really a bottleneck for me at the moment. I can stack veneer and have it in the press inside of 15 minutes.

@longhairedboy you look so happy in the video! it's awesome! I really hope you can do this full time one day.... Making electric skateboards is a form of medication..... it's exhilarating...exciting... fulfilling.. I bet you don't smile like a small baby in a candy store when you at your day job! 

**new t-shirt slogan**
*works sux build board's be happy*

Now let me talk about the deck.... those line on the road side are so sweet... its a very unique and aggressive shape, modern & retro styling combined into one which is truly amazing in terms of design.

I can't wait to see some trucks on it, also how stiff is this bad boy?... feed me more of this wizardry 


I've said it before & ill say it again, self build eboards are the future of skateboarding...

@onloop me too! i'm *cough* happy at my *cough* day job of course but yes i would love to do this full time. nothing would make me happier!

its pretty stiff despite being only 7 ply because of that sweeet w-dome profile. I have to bounce up and down pretty hard to get it to flex, and i'm pretty sure the flex points are not in the center of the deck but near the trucks. The center is where the dome is. It starts behind the front trucks and ends just in front of the rear trucks where it flattens out into the upward tail slope.  

She's 40" long with a wheelbase just over 26.5". Wired, filled, and stained she's right at 5 pounds 11 ounces (i just put her on a postage scale). i'm not sure where that puts it in relation to other boards. I haven't stripped my Gravity down to weigh the deck but it seems within the same ballpark. 

I haven't done any testing for wheel bite though.I figure the half inch risers i typically use on electrics will keep that down to a non-issue, but i am investigating some methods for creating wheel wells.

the peaks of the w-dome on the belly side are almost exactly the width of a space cell, and when it lays across the gap there's enough room for some 12 gauge battery wires to travel down between the deck and the board so there are options for orienting the pack. you could also of course unpack some lipo prismatics or 18650s and run them down that wide gutter and keep your box even slimmer. 

i have plans for boxes but i may list the decks for sale on their own before i figure all of that out. i definitely need to get my shop online. maybe tomorrow. It will be my birthday after all.

You look like you got a lot of space there.. I'm running out :frowning:

This deck looks amazing! The inlaid wiring is so cool. Also the shape of this deck reminds me a little bit of the PIt Bull Hoverboard in Back to the Future II, for some reason!

This one is about to get packed up and sent out. As soon as i find a box for it.
https://www.instagram.com/p/-uMP-lhBnU/?taken-by=longhairedboy

@cmatson I went ahead and took the time to countersink the truck bolts so you won't have to tighten the bolts until they do it themselves. Should i throw in some clear grip for you too along with the box mounting kit? You mentioned you wanted to grip the top in black but i have like 50 sheets of clear if you want a sheet. 

this is sort of turning into a DIY deck kit.

Titebond III ultimate wood glue. Its about $27/gallon. It seems like i'm getting about 5 or 6 decks out of a gallon on average depending on how my roller is behaving. 

I really like working with it. It has a long enough working time to not only roll glue onto 12 sides of the 7 layers of veneer, but also leaves you plenty of time to still slide the layers around to get them as centered with each other as possible before laying them onto the mold. It takes 24 hours to cure, but i only have to keep it in the press for about 4 or 5 hours (i do six hours for good measure) before taking it out to set overnight to cure completely before cutting. 

You can buy it at just about any hardware or home improvement store. I get mine at Lowes.

I just want to say that this deck has officially taken the spot for my #1 skate deck ever: and believe me, I've ridden a lot of different boards.

Haha I'm not just saying this to please @longhairedboy- he's really gotten the shape and feel right with this one :smile: (especially when riding barefoot!!).

I will be doing a complete build thread of with this deck, and my arbor deck (which is almost done..) very soon! I also think I'm going to make another youtube video, this time with some better editing skills as I know a lot of people go right to youtube without even the slightest thought of posting on a forum...

lol no shit. I've got some stories about what my hair has gotten into. Seat belt retractors, power drill air vents, polyesther resin... 

i even got it tangled up in a drive belt once when it flopped over and fell onto a running drive assembly. 

I've been wearing it in a bun more recently, often with a knit cap over it.

yeah ! i got the picture . 

back in my school days , there was this girl with hair length right down to her  waist ! she can literally hide both of her entire arms under her hair .  

same story , got caught on a drill press machine . the huge wall fan that was cooling our class room blew her hair . (air con wasnt enough even if it felt cool , we need ventilation) 
our class room teacher had always reminded everyone to practice safety cautious .

next time , she tied  her hair neatly.
after 3yrs of technical education .everyone got their certificate . we asked her to let loose that hair and it has grown more . down to the knee length .

that was about 20yrs ago .

:smiley:
