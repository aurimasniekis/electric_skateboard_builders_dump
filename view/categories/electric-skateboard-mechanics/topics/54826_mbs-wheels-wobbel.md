Hi guys i have a pare of mbs 100mm wheels but they wobbel a bit i think its because of the molde line photo![1525798394249951822922|375x500](upload://beeT6LLeNBhyWPgqZMBLeKWirAl.jpg) littel line in the top, is this a problem or can i just leave it?

It doesn't look like a crack in the core to me, but you may want to double-check. 

Of the set of 4 MBS100 wheels that I have, only one of them spins true enough for me to mount my wheel pulley. I think it may just be the quality control (or lack of).

This seems to be getting more and more common in newer batches of these wheels... somebody might want to talk to MBS
