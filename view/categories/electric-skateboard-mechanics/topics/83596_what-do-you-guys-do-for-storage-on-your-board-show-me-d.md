I want to see how - ON YOUR BOARD - you have built some sort of enclosure or a box for something other than the regular battery and vesc stuff. I want ideas so I can make a little storage bit for some tools and other things

U can try using a waterproof container with extra space. Im going to start an escooter for my wife with an Apache 2800 from harber freight which can hold 80 cells and still has some space for small tools I dont have pics yet but I can get some when I get home

Sorry, it just had to be done! 

It would actually be pretty neat to have a small space for some hex keys and a wrench

I added some neodymium magnets to the outside of my enclosure a lil while ago to hold a few Allen keys, worked fine

Vacuum bag the joints and put them in inside pocket
Or take internals out of old android and throw them in there
