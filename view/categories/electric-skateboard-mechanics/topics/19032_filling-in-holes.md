I have not tried filling in gaps but maybe something like Wood filler, No more gaps, Liquid nails.

```
-put tape over one side of the hole. 
-flip the deck, 
-fill the hole 4/5 way up with baking soda. 
-slowly add in drops of superglue. It will dry rock solid. 
-repeat until the hole is filled

```
If your trying to reuse a stripped hole mix sawdust and wood glue into a paste. Pack the hole let dry. Then predrill the new hole. Works on old doors.
