I stripped half of the top deck screw holes on my carbon fiber board. To fix it I used Form-A-Thread by Loctite. I bought it on amazon for ~$35. Here is the link:

I felt like this was the best option because I didn't want to tap the holes as they were already small at 2.5mm and I would risk cracking the board. The results of the repair are outstanding. It holds as if it were metal to metal. Took me about 15 minutes to apply everything and 30 minutes later all the deck screws are holding.

The instructions are in the box, but essentially it comes down to 4 steps:

1. LIBERALLY Apply the release agent to the bolt (small blue bottle that prevents from hardening to the sealant)
2. Mix some liquid from the two tubes in equal amounts (a little goes a long way)
3. Put the mixture onto the bolt and insert into stripped thread
4. Wait 5 minutes to unscrew and another 30 minutes before appling pressure

Hope this helps anyone with the same issue
