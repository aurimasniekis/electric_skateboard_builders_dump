I'm think of adding grab handle to my deck. I love Raptor 2 built in handles, they look so cool.

I found on AliExpress this motorbike grab handle

Here is my deck.

i hold mine over the shoulder by the front wheel, or by the back truck if it has a tail. 

I'm interested in using handles though.

also called Mall Grab which skaters always make fun of (like I did as a kid) which I don't understand now since it'srather comfortable and doesn't rip my shirt when walking. Not great for long travel with esk8 due to weight and length if you are not tall.

Having seen the Raptor 2 videos I think they should've put the handles further back because it doesn't seem to be perfectly balance even when they hold the rear part...maybe I'm wrong. The Raptor 1's handle was perfectly place and the board balances perfectly when picked up.

@MontPierre those handles look promising. Keep us updated if you put them on

The motors are too heavy compared to the rest of the components, the handles would have to be moved back towards the tail significantly. The Raptor 2 weighs almost as much as one of my boards does.

Well I'm still looking into the other options, even drifted into idea of making/getting cnc milling machine haha so I can make my own handles ;)

Cheapest would be to re purpose existing item, like above motorbike grab handles, unfortunately I don't think they will do, they might stick out too much from the board, I would for sure make a cut into the board ( like R2 has).

Lucky ! My board is not very wide and enclosure also restricts how much in I can cut. At the moment R2 like handles are they only option for me.

the R2 one would mean you have to cut away the deck. Why not do what R1 did had just have a grab handle under the deck? Home depot sells plenty of cabinet pull handles that would do the trick if the real purpose is to pick up a board.

Not sure on the width of the base of this one, but if bolted to your deck, could make a good handle...

the Raptor 1 handles were not comfortable because their edges were sharp. I added a piece of plastic to it and it's great...plus I always wear gloves.

As long as you get a handle with rounded edges it should be fine

I carry mine by the front truck over my shoulder.Speaking of mall grab, I was in the mall and some kids said some dumb stuff(lol im like 30 and been skating /surfing most of my life). I simply looked at them and said, come here and hold this 20 pound board like a normal board and tell me its comfy/easy...they quickly changed their tune to holy crap that thing has motors. who cares if ya mall grab, its a heavy ass longboard dudes

This pack is $60, you could stop by your local indoor rock climbing venue and pick up a single one probably.



The ones at middle bottom should be enough to get your thumb around and really should be all you need.

I think I have decided - simple , "cheap" and effective

http://www.trampaboards.com/grab-handle-black-patch-with-blue-logo-p-655.html

I'll mount it on under side like Raptor 1 had. 
It might not have R2 looks but it will save me cutting off bits of my deck.

Bumping this topic.
I'm interested to see other handle setups.

I had to carry my board for 10-15 minutes and it's just horrible. I'm too small to grab it by the truck. I tried to strap it to my backpack that has straps for standard skateboards, but my longboard is too big and too heavy for it.

Standard webbing. Cut holes, fit to bolts, add washers then nuts. I also use velcro on top of the board to keep it out of the way.

I used a pair of existing holes in the hangar to thread the wire and lock it with electrician's connectors.

Very comfy vertically on your back.
