thought this could help someone.

we've all had stuck pulleys on the motor shaft that was a pain in the ass to pull off, right?

there's already a ton of threads about pulling the pulley off the shaft.  i've tried some of those gear pullers but they all kind of sucked.

but just found one that works perfect.

the "arm" is finely adjustable:

the "gear holder" doesn't just hold on the flange but the pulley itself:

and the "push shaft" is less than 8mm so it fits into the shaft hole:
