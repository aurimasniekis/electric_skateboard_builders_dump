So I have one of those cheap eBay escs that comes with a generic remote controller that is charged via micro usb. I thought it would be rather annoying to end up somewhere with enough juice left in the esk8 to be able to ride but a dead remote and no way to charge it. Here is my solution: USB wrist strap / lanyard. No idea what to actually call it.

Recommended length for USB cable as a wrist strap is 30cm minimum.
