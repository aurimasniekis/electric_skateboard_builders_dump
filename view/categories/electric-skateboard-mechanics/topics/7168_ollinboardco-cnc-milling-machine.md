Time to make more space in the shop! Prototyping fees have been through the roof on our drive train development so we made the plunge and purchased our own cnc mill. Decided to purchase a manual milling machine and perform a CNC conversion, going to bring our little factory to another level!

Awesome news! You guys are doing multistage presses, right? stacking up the hollow core layers separate from the face layers? Is that the stuff you're bringing in house or are you talkign about motor mounts and and that kind of stuff?

i've had my eye on the laser conversion kit for my xcarve. I'm also looking into altering the axis lengths to facilitate cutting out complete decks from raw presses so i don't have to do it by hand anymore and can get more consistent and reliable results.

We built a cnc router table earlier this year for our woodwork. Much nicer than cutting cores by hand with a jigsaw and spindle sander!  This new unit will be for milling aluminum and steel, heat sink v6 enclosures and drive systems. We also have a new metal working lathe on the way for prepping truck hangers for our precision mounts, track says it will be delivered today. Need to put a hustle on the shop expansion project to make room for these new tools!

tell me about it. My garage to too damned small. I need to build a carport in front of it for my wife to park under so i can have the whole thing to myself. My xcarve and paint station are on the back porch at the moment. It would be nice to have my hot tub area back.

@Chaka If you are looking for max performance, near silent operating noise and  improved reliability over steppers, I would consider upgrading from stepper motors and going with a brushelss servo solution from Teknic. Made in the  USA too!! They have Nema 23 and Nema 34 sizes as well. THey are MUCH more powerful than a stepper for their size. 3 Year Warranty...: Legit game changer. IMO :thumbsup:

I'm also building a machine and these are the absolute best most reliable that money can buy. They aren't that crazy expensive as the older generations of servos were. You can run them off of a regular stepper driver too. 
The CNC Smoothstepper is a great solution and made in the USA. It's actually free shipping if you go Ebay...

It is. I use nema 23 motors on my CNC machine and they're super powerful.

do you have something to catch dust @chaka? Unless you just don't care, I've found CNC milling creates an insane amount of dust (weather wood or metal). I built a giant box to enclose mine in with 4 cameras, LED lights, and a soon to be dust collection system. Really helps keep things under control.

Congrats on the purchase! Can't wait to see the great work you do with it.

Here's a demo of a Grizzly G0704 mill converted to CNC using the Clearpath servos from Teknic. Nema 23. The silent operation is amazing. DEAD QUIET! :grin:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZJVXTaDeoU
The encoders are built in and are self calibrating to the resonance of the axis via software. They are a direct replacement for Nema 23 and 34 standard. They never lose a step like steppers and have much more torque, so they stay cooler when running tougher materials or longer programs. Steppers can get pretty hot!! Because they run smoother and quieter, the whole machine vibrates less. These little things add up and can move your machine out of calibration over time. They also ensure repeatability and accuracy. Because of the quality built in encoders, the resolution and precision are enhanced as well. In some cases, you can even increase your feeds and speeds without sacrificing quality or stalling the machine. 
I'm not trying to sell anybody on these, I'm just excited that they are available! 
@chaka That's totally cool. Steppers are the still the NEMA standard. I've heard good things about Linux CNC. Especially for a free software package. You know everybody is just dying to see what you produce on your machines. Congrats on the build! :smile::thumbsup: Could you post a pic of your machine. I love machines. I'm sure I'm not the only one that would like to see it!

That is awesome! You must be really excited to be getting your machine going! Have fun with it, brutha!! 
I haven't had a CNC for about a year and a half because I tore down my Openbuilds machine and started designing my own from scratch. Just getting all of the right parts is a pain, but it has been a labor of love...Nothing good in this world comes without hard work and dedication to learning. You can work hard all day long, but you gotta work smart as well. 
I'm a big OBC fan, so I am really stoked to see you succeeding and growing your company organically.

The machine is an lms 3990, perfect size for us right now. Decided to go with gecko drives, the G540, and KL23H2100-35-4B stepper motors. Found a really good mobo, intel d525mw mini-itx, no moving parts and it has decent performance using linuxcnc.

The mill has been running about 16 to 18 hours a day for the past two weeks now. Running like champ! 

Added a compressed air attatchment to help clear chips and it also helps keep things cool. Have also added some heatsinks and fans to the motor.  

Everthing considered, this has been a great investment. Already planning on building a second machine and doubling our output!

Our system is based on matched set of trucks that are turned on a lathe. We are now using cast liquid attack rkp's. So far they have been some of the best cast trucks we have used. 

We have basically taken all the slop out of the drive train by mounting the pulley to the hangar and driving the wheel with a spline.  No more pulley alignment issues.

Once we have all our production milling fixtures finished I will start a thread with more details and photos.

Well I live in a room of a house (so I have 1 room to keep all of my stuff) and I have a CNC milling machine. Not close to as good at chakas, but I made my board with it and have cut steel tools with it.

Now I barely can fit the CNC in my room. And there's no way I could ft a lathe or saws too. But it's up to how badly you want it. I wanted a CNC machine bad enough to live with it in my only room, lol.

Note on the g540 drives, they can use some heatsinks.  Used a buck converter and powered a small 12v pc fan to keep it cool. Once things settle down I will mill a custom heatsink but these work fine for now. Barely warm to the touch, even at high feed rates. I fastened them with some silicon heatsink plaster.

Here's a quick tip, I did start this thread as a resource after all.

When locking parts or fixtures into your vise, snug it slightly and give it a few quick taps with a deadblow or rubber mallet. You will hear a barely audible ping once it is seated. This keeps things accurate. Once seated lock it down.

Switched out our air supply with a high output air pump. Having our air compressor switch on a hundred times a day was getting old fast. This is an 80L/min pump. A 70L/min pump probably would have been fine. 

Clearing chips is a big deal when using larger endmills at moderate feedrates and compressed air alone has been doing a great job so far.  Might add some type of coolant/lubricant drip to the line as we increase the efficiency of our g-code but this is working well for us so far! Nice and quiet.

Nice one chaka! I like using compressed air too for aluminium. Some people use mist, but i find it actually makes the chips stick to the workpiece and gums up my cutters! Probably increasing the air pressure and flow would help, but even without forced air, a 2 flute helical cutter does wonders with chip clearing.
