Cant help you out with your stuck " Motor " but can help you out with this below :slight_smile: 

Motor = runs on electricity
Engine = runs on combustion

Pulleys usually have a set screw.  If there is no set screw, you may have to heat up the pulley with a heat gun and tap the shaft that the pulley sits on with a hammer.  Just make sure the motor mount fastening screws to the motor are removed before using the hammer.

Pulley Puller + Heat (to soften the threadlocker)

Don't use a battery puller, the flanges on the pulley are aluminum and will bend before the pulley moves. You have to use heat then a large flat head screwdriver and pry the pulley off with brute force. Make sure the two set screws on the pulley are taken off first.

hmm, i actually order one like this recently from ebay.
Might have to wait this one out before i try and rip this expensive shitwheel apart.

Memmo to anyone who are gonna buy a benchwheel.
Dont.
Mine is only 1 month old and is ready for the trash more or less.

Jinra i really have tried a lot with the flat head screwdrivers, how much heat do i need for this to work out ?

It's mostly the torque, just a bit of heat to soften the thread locker from the set screws. I used a lighter and held it to the pulley for a minute. It'll come off just use a bit of force. I've taken the entire drive train apart.

Just took the board out with only 1 motor, the other still connected.
For some reason it begins to spin when the board is shaken and get max power .. seems like a short ..
So now i know for sure i just need to get the motor off and replace it.

I wouldn't be surprised if that pulley is glued on.  Without the presence of a set screw or any type of retaining clip somethings holding it on.  If its glue, try heat and pull.

there where a clip at the end, a pretty shitty one though ..
Broke when i tried to remove it.

Gonna wait for the puller, then try with heat, puller and flat screwdriver ..
Cant wait to tell how this shit was garbaged together.

When you figure it out and fix it, would you mind post how you did it and what parts you used on this thread?

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/chinese-board-repair-and-upgrade-help-so-you-bought-a-chinese-board-huh-wanna-talk-about-it/10607

I'm trying to put together a thread of just repairs and upgrades on chinese boards. There seem to be lot of people buying  these and needing to upgrade or repair them. I want this thread to be like a transition into building your own board from scratch. Learn as you go situation. Lol

t there are a lot of people buying chinese boards and wanting to upgrade them. I thought we couuld use a thread where poeple shared what parts they used and how they upgraded it. Maybe some of the pro DIY guys can give advice on what parts to buy and where to buy them. Please share any repairs or upgrades you've made to a chinese board. And i know people on here hate the chinese clones, but let's try to make this thread about building and r

Mine looks like yours, it took me about 2 hours of pulling with my friend's help and several tools. I did use a gas fueled lighter to help though. Just keep at it and be careful not to break the mounts.

Regarding to the puller.
As other mentioned, i just ended up breaking the pulley on the board, so i will try to find some other way to get it off and replace it.

Still keeping updated.

Told you not to use a puller :P A big flat head screwdriver did the trick for me for both pulleys. Not sure heat is required at all. Just torque it enough and it'll come off.
