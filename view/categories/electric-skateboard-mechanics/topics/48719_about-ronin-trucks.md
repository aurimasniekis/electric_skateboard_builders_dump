Guys I need your help! 
I bought Ronins cast version. Today was the first day that I ride using them and I have mixed feelings.
They are smooooooth and feels very good but a bit unstable. I have stock bushings those red ones that are I believe 90A. My weight is 76kg.
The big factor might be that I'm not a skateboarder just a simple beginner but it's hard for me to imagine to go on them even 20km/h. There are some people here that use them so please help me and tell what to do.
I'm also in process of designing CNC milled hanger for them so hope this thread could be filled with all the info about these great trucks :)![IMG_20180310_151407|666x500](upload://umDrBb9cgrH2Go2tVVuO7yV7Mxs.jpg)

Have you tried them on a commercial board?
The kegels and tarmac are not the problem

are these angled risers between truck and board? the angle looks "very turny", combined with that short wheelbase it might be a little extreme. ronins are usually way more precise and stable than other trucks around zero lean and quite turny when you lean in a lot!

@banjaxxed no I don't have one do you think it might be deck related thing?

@whitepony look at the picture. My deck is not finished yet so I tried to mount them as straight as I can. Do you also suspect that it might be because of deck? I saw that you are using white bushings. Are those hardest Ronins with lower rebound? Theoretically for my weight those red one should be ok?

I use some 6 deg angled risers from Bolzen witch happen to be shock absorbing too. Compensate the shape of your integrated deck with the risers. 

Remember that on a directional setup you want a smaller angle on the rear: 

For ex. 50 deg front + 43 deg rear

How long is your wheel base?

Get a set of iced tea bushings to start and put them board side and see how they feel then... (they are the next duro up)

Or go post in @Alphamail riptide bushing thread and ask for his help with his bushings.

```
for that short wheelbase I would probably de-wedge the trucks a little (make them less turny):

https://78.media.tumblr.com/02b23d417259ab1adb587b37a77c1c90/tumblr_inline_nhn9q9bJ1N1sfybmt.jpg

Im using riptide 93A krank tall barrel board and 87A crank roadside - its harder than original to cater for the higher average speed when cruising with an electric motor.

I remember I didnt like the ronins on my jet spud build, cause it was too turny due to the wheelbase. went with 44¬∞ calibers instead there. on my vanguard the ronins are just miles above anything I ever tried, but thats a massive wheelbase of 90cm!!

Yeah tuning bushings is a process...

Taking some angle out of the rear truck will help, but at 42.5 degrees I would leave the front alone.

Running the rear bushings firmer will help too, although I always change things progressively. Even just a iced tea board side in the rear might will help?

There rarely is an actual need to start wedging or changing bushings on the cast ronins or even calibers.

Ive taken the cast ronins up to 90kmph with the stock bushings, they are insanely stable trucks due to the queenpin.

Try tightening them up a bit. It may be the wheelbase of your deck thats making them feel unstable. Maybe use cupped washers too.

```
you still need to dial in the amount of turn for your lean - i ran ronins on the 29‚Äú jet spud and they turned so hard that you could use only a fraction of your full lean at low speeds. in that case de-wedging is the right thing to do since bushings only restrict your lean and dont really solve the problem of your wheelbase! i think thats what @LukePL actually means when he says ‚Äûunstable‚Äú, because ronins really cant be unstable, but the board can feel twitchy and overly agile/nervous if it reacts strongly to every tiny bit of lean! youd have the problem with any truck I think!

ronins come with cupped washers already and careful with overtighten bushings - nothing can be solved with that! :slight_smile:

Thanks so much for all your advice! Things that I'll try first is to de-wedge rear truck like @whitepony said. You are totally right that I meant nervous behavior. @banjaxxed it's true also. I can't skateboard yet and the deck.... I think that it's shape make it transfer every little move to trucks. The curve of the sides is too much. A lot of tuning ahead of me but that the fun right :)

Depends on how wide you wanna go but I would try to accommodate 5-6 mm positive rake which apparently makes the truck a bit more lively. The CNC Ronins have about 5 mm rake!

Luke have a plan and understand the changes you are making before you try them.

More rake will make what you have now more twitchy/lively.

![DSC_6156|690x459](upload://ucc3ih33pxhfZvUJavxuR95g2Dh.JPG)

This is my winter ride, it has a 25 degree rear plate, cupped washers top and bottom, Horchatta bushing board side and a iced tea road side. Currently a 154mm hangar with 2.5mm of rake but I might go back to 164mm.

My front truck is different in almost every way. 
more rake
more base plate angle...

This gives me turn but also keeps the rear stable. 

Have a plan before you start of what you want.

```
The issue here is that you can't make the ideal setup for low $. Hanger front and rear need to be almost identical for cost reasons (milling is going to be expensive). Rake or no rake, a long hanger on the order of 10 inch won't feel as agile as a 160 mm hanger, so wat to dooo? I agree with having a split setup, something like 50 degrees front, 45 or lower in the back. Stiffer bushings on the rear than on the front. And that alone is better than say 75% of the Alibaba trucks including Torqueboards 218 mm!

@Schulerbible as you can read I don't want those trucks to be more lively at least not with this deck and my skill level ;)

@Cobber a good plan is the way to go but it's hard to plan something when you don't have the knowledge and that is why i'm asking you guys. Your setup is highly tuned in every detail and you probably have tried a bunch of them before that. As I understand a graphic representation what you have is 3rd from the top in the Angled risers/weges graphic that @whitepony posted?
 So now I would need a simple advice what to do and try next.

Maybe @Alphamail can add some advice here also?

With cast Ronin trucks, dewedging the rear can go s long ways in making them bore stable.  Leave the front as it is and dewedge the rear 2.5 to 5 degrees.  I find the stock bushings very bouncy so I normally run KranK TallBarrels in 90a for my 90 KG / 198 LBS.  If I dewedge the rear I run cupped washers in back, top and flats in the fron

Possibly, not knocking your design and kudos for actually doing it but it is a large unknown, stock Ronins with stock bushing are not known for mishandling at 20mph or being wobbly at all, I'd factor that along with the other things coming up, a spare commerical skateboard deck is easy/cheap to find out.

IThat‚Äôs exactly what I was talkin about. The offset between the pivot a is and hanger axle is called rake! You were talkin about making the hanger wider. This also changes its characteristics! But you are right, with no experience in other trucks and setups (which tbh most eboarders don‚Äôt care about) it is pretty damn hard to know what XYZ setup will feel like.

Ground to bottom is 100mm and ground to griptape is 125mm.
So I think that it can be 15mm less in both cases. Will that make a difference?

That's not that tall for a top mount... That's actually about average.

Decreasing your grip tape level is just going to decrease the distance of leverage (top of deck to pivot point)

Less leverage = less twitchy, but harder to lean into turns due to the decrease in leverage.

I would stick to the suggestion of others
- dewedge rear
- bushing changes
- cup changes.

You should be able to tune that board fairly easily.

If you really are set on dropping it... I would mill baseplate cutouts to sink the trucks farther into your AIO deck..but that may result in wheelbite and the need to increase the size of your wheelwells

Thanks for advices! That was the plan to mill spots for base plates. Don't have wheelwells and wheel bite is brutal but they are also in a line to be made. I want to make it as low as possible because you can always go up easy if there is a need.![copy-of-img_2023|500x500](upload://eRV8ZhBRHKLo5AQY6xCBDqzN3S9.jpg)

What width hanger is that Luke? The new narrower 160mm hangers might have a more open bushing dish from the photo's. 
But you have what you have. Either firm up the bushing or try flipping the cup washer so it acts as a regular flat washer. It might give you less compression on the bushing and make it worse by allowing more lean or it might give you that bit of clearance you need.
Is it happening front and back or just front? A lot of people like to flip the roadside front washer anyhow so it is worth a try to see if you like it.

Upsss sorry I forgot to replay..... The hangers are 180mm and it happens front and rear. I have made some observations and I think that it might be what @Deckoz mentioned before which is the leverage because of top mount and much thicker deck than normal. Because of that I think I need to go with harder bushings than I would go on normal longboard deck. I have KranK Tall Barrels 90A board side but maybe I should move them road side and add some 93A board side (or 96A?) ?

I've found on Ronin's specifically at least for me running the harder bushing roadside feels much better. I run the older beverage series I think they changed formula, new bushings to bouncy. Fruit punch up front, rear dewedge -7¬∞ with horchata 98a roadside and ice tea 95a board side. Buzzed Amish precision washers, cupped roadside, flat boardside. Very turny setup with lots of lean but still stable 50km+.

You guys see the new billet katanas?
Gone even narrower again! (I got a production batch 1 set, basically a production version of Max Caps pro model).
The widest set is now 154mm, narrowest 124mm! with three adjustable axles and a 5mm spacer.
I'll throw up a pic later... (of my set)

web site has the older model that was 144mm min. so 10mm has come off the hanger on each end (20mm all up).

I would have been interested in the cast katanas if they were same width or wider than last generation. It's kind of funny Ronin are getting narrower while e-skate trucks are getting wider 218-240mm. 

Do you have picture of your billet Ronin setup?

No I don't think so.

I'm a fan of ronin trucks, and while it'd be great to have a hanger & motor mounts...
and I realize eSk8 has zero focus from ronin as they are all about racing...

They have created and refined their own tech, they even have a patent pending.

So i'm not sure how I feel about this? :thinking:

With a deeper shoulder on the axle stubs you could mount a motor to the existing design with out a IP conflict?

The way I see it, it's not really a clone but a mod. Like custom aftermarket handles for a knife, or a bolt on muffler.

This would open up ronins to motorization, as not many of us have machining capabilities to mod cronins accurately enough for a satisfying mount.

Also you'd still need to get the baseplate, pivot pin, etc. from ronin. And who knows, if there is enough of a market maybe ronin will address eskate market directly.

Sure if you buy a set of billet trucks & replace the hanger... now I have not a had a hard look at the patent. But I imagine the spirit of it to cover any skateboard truck system that uses a damped support pin.

It is a conundrum, personally i'd call or email Tony to start with. Ronin are not interested in wide trucks, but they are in racing. You never know if you pitch it to them as a eSk8 racing product with strict production parameters and maybe a royalty or something they might go for it... I can't speak for them. There obviously needs to be something in it for them...

Fyre trucks are very different from Ronin trucks in that they remove all the load bearing responsibility from the bushing.  This opens up a lot of possibilities to run much softer bushings than you normally would or could. You can actually ride them without bushings or just use a roadside bushing.  Not recommended but it can be done.  They can also automatically adjust to various height bushings within a reasonable range.  We make both the front and rear pivots for them which makes them even better and a lot quieter.  Really an amazing truck for the price although availability can be an issue if you want something other than common base plate angles or hanger widths.

They look amazing and as far as I remember there are no builds with them. 
I'm thinking about my own trucks for some time and I always thought that channel trucks are better because hanger can only move in two directions during turning. Than I thought that would be nice to make a channel truck and use standard bushings and I found MBS Vector to be very like construction that I had in mind.

![user28_pic1335_|667x500](upload://xTOBaHXcvhytByWJoex4RFGV7Au.jpg)

 I tried to design something like that and after several attempts I ended with something that is like a clone of Liquid Fyre :tired_face:
Now I'm not sure is it worth to go that route and design them, do the whole cam work, fixtures and cnc?
Of course it would be a truck for esk8 (wide and with some integrated motor mounts)
Please share you thoughts.....

Thank you @Alphamail for your answer as always super helpful!

@LukePL when you say they can move in only two directions are you referring to being locked in, both front and back, disallowing any sway from the kingpin?  In essence, the truck acts like a clevis joint?

Hopefully the link above shows up like it should.

Works fine. Any chance you got a build log we can stare at?

@Namasaki has a build using liquid fire trucks too. I'm pretty sure there more. Some people just don't post build threads (@Sender, don't make me tell your mom).

Last I checked he has Liquid Precisions, but they're basically the same thing. Great trucks and @Namasaki is the one who helped me get mine. I like them more than my pair of old school cast Ronins. I hope ABEC opens up orders for them again...

I remember when some people talked about using these trucks, they drew criticism for spending that much on a pair of trucks, so I think you're right...most likely there are more builds with them but no one wants to post them.

I don't know if I will ever do one...I started several drafts and after looking at the build, it looks like a real bad job :smile:.

I think it looks interesting though I can‚Äôt see myself riding something that size given how accustomed I‚Äôve become with longer decks.

Still would be nice to see these kinds of trucks!

I am using Liquid Precision Trucks but not the Fire version. 
Mine are the same except for the extra support plate/pin.

They use a ball pivot which makes them feel looser than trucks with a barrel pivot.

Although, I would imagine that the Fire Truck version is more stable than what I have.

Thanks guys for all your input. @scrapheap it's not a build thread so I didn't remember that. Besides like I wrote before I came up wit similar idea not knowing that there's already such a thing on the market. Cool board :slight_smile: So your experience is good with those trucks? In what way they are better than trucks without this supporting part?

I've only had experience with Ronins, Liquids, and Ventures, so I can't give a fair comparison. I can only give my personal opinion and experiences on why I like the Fyres more than Cast Ronins.

Both trucks are quite stable, but the Fyres feel more lively to me. Cast Ronins felt sort of robotic to me and I didn't have much fun carving with them as I did the Fyres. And Ronins weren't really designed for decks with really short wheelbases...so that also had an effect, since I had planned this build as a mini build. That and the added hangar length of the Fyres help add a little more stability on a short deck vs the Ronins.

Both are really good trucks though, but adjusting bushings, washers, and baseplate angles have an impact on the stability and feel of the ride too! (big thanks to @alphamail for helping me out with split-angle washer adjustments!).

Only frustrating part is that no one makes truck mounts for the Liquids (because they aren't common), so you have to buy whatever is on the market and modify them to work, if you don't resort to making one yourself. I had to use a buttload of sugru + silicone to get Etoxx's Ronin mounts to work, and @Namasaki filed Torqueboards' mounts a little bit to work for him.

The TB mounts fit really well on the Liquid trucks with a little filing.
Basically just had to file the corner square in the rings.
