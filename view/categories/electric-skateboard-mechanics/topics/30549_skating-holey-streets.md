How do you guys ride in holey/cracky streets? does the speed of the e-skate make it so you don't really catch in the holes? or do you guys simply use bigger wheels.

Anyway I'm in the process of making my own e-skate but where I live the streets are the worse and now I'm a bit worried that I'd either need to ride at 10km/h max or risk getting thrown over my board.

thx for any tips

Big wheels. I'd say use either 97 or 107 mm flywheels, or if the roads are really bad, go with pneumatic wheels

100mm MBS has been great for me doing daily commute around NYC, pot holes, road construction, grates no problem.

I don't know how much time you have on a skateboard. But with time you learn to de-weight the board, and pop a little over the cracks, and it helps a lot. But Ya as pennyboard said, go big,or go pneumatic if your road are that bad. .

I'm thinking 93mm wheels should do.

Not much but I roller skate a lot. I guess it's pretty much the same thing, as long as my weight isn't on my front wheel when I hit the crack I should be good. Also I'm trying to avoid using pneumatic wheels as much as I can.

Your weight has to be on your front foot. Otherwise you'll get speedwobbles. You shouldn't change the way you ride a longboard, electric or not.

Maybe throw in a picture of how bad the streets look, from experience sidewalks like this :> are a pain to use because of water drain just in the middle of sidewalk.. you can also see how nice stone paved road.is on the side lol (left corner)

Even with pneumatics at speed.going.over this.thing is a pain

With my 90mm wheels, that pavement would be painful anyway. When the bricks are all placed after each other, you feel every ribbon. Pavements with their bricks not placed straight are much better, as every brick flows into another one.

Tehatheist I meant shift the weight back for a fraction of a second, only the time you hit the crack so your wheels dont dig in.

This is not necessarily true, but I really I don't want to get into a discussion on speed wobbles, and technique. Once you're comfortable on a board you will be able to shift your weight around quite a bit without any problem.  But once you get up there in speed(depends on the rider) its better to stay centered, and only make small adjustments.

I had mbs, they were a huge upgrade from 83mm clones. Then I switched to 107mm supaflys, and they're way better than mbs. 

So...Get the supaflys if u can.

the blind guy or the yellow things on the sidewalks? lol

those things suck everytime i see one i usually slow to about 10mph or less, its like hitting the brakes when you go over those.

because i tend to avoid running over people especially blind people i cant avoid those yellow dots.

I think we can agree that going over blind strips and blind people are both varying degrees of bad

That feeling I had upgrading from clones to mbs, that feeling of "wow this is amazing," that feeling multiplied by three when going from mbs to supaflys. I can't recommend enough.

I absolutely love those when you have the momentum, green light and no traffic or pedestrians...

Those looks so innocent yet can mess you really bad if you're not prepared...
I ride on 83 Kegels atm and they do just fine. But in terms of comfort what is the best next step: 97, 107 or all terrain? With 107's you kind of lose a lot on acceleration, right?

Wouldn't run FWD or AWD help out on this? FWD would make for a good fight against that with PU wheels if you can shift a bit.

Has anybody tried lining their decks with the same material spenco insoles are made of. Theoretically you could just chop up some insoles and line your deck

> "de-weight" 

That is a great way to describe it, I haven't heard that before. 




Down here the sidewalk gaps are massive, and they rattle everything loose.

I cant take credit for de-weight its just something I picked up. It really is the best description for what your doing. A lot of tricks use this technique, and some people don't even know they are doing it. Its just natural. 

We have those sidewalk around here, and they suck. I end up riding in the street when I have a choice.

Don't know what roads you ride on but It's rare to fund those kind if speed bumps around my city. But with practice you can ride over all kinds of speed bumps. But ya  I've seen some hardcore speed bumps that can't be ridden. Like  those thick plastic ones you see in parking garages. 

I wouldn't try turning hard or anything when riding over this kind of stuff. Its kinda like Mariocart and oil slicks, your be ok as long as you don't turn, and you let off the gas.

I run 107 and rolling over these rumble pads pretty easily, definitely nowhere near as jarring as 97mm or 100mm mbs wheels. 

In terms of the torque loss due to increased size, swapped out pulleys to 15/40 teeth. For me its just the perfect setup (until I find some other excuse to mess with it).

I own 3 MBS, it is an okay choice but still not as pleasant as 107 that ive tried, you defly want to go for 97 abec 11 or  107mm if you have mucho $$$

Yeah, recently switched to 97's and that's whole another level of comfort, just wow. I did have some wheelbite with 97's and carved the deck on the front trucks so everything's fine now.  
Once you get rolling all you need is control the power now and then - in between I just let momentum of the wheels do it's thing. These have some serious momentum, with Kegels I was on the gas majority of time, with Abecs I just control the momentum...it's so good and I just let them do their thing...need some more power, OK, boom, I let go and it just keeps on rolling. 
I love it.
