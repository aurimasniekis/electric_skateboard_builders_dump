I know they have a open source file on their site, but does anyone have a CAD file or something like that of their current motor mount that they are selling?

This one:

Thanks.

There is one of the carbon fiber part on grabcad. You shouldn't really be using these without @onloop s permission though. His open source one should work fine.

I actually already bought the mount, I just need to fit something onto it and need to get measurements and stuff right, easier to just have the part already made in CAD. Would you happen to have a link?
