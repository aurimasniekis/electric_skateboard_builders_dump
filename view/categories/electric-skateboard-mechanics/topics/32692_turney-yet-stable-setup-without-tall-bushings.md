ok people, esepecialy actual downhill skaters. is there any way to make your heavyass eboard feel more lively and still stable? withought getting different trucks? all the boards I've ridden feel really stiff. and not just because the trucks are too tight or they r setup with the wrong bushings

it depends, some people like stiffer bushings, and some the other way. I find precision washers (Array makes a good set) remove a lot of slop / play in the trucks, which allows me to run my trucks looser (or softer bushings) without _as much_ wobble.

What's your current setup?

I have a dh/freeride deck and for trucks I'm running an old pair of Randal r1's. Bushings are riptide 88 and 90a. And wheels r kegels. Only reason I'm using the Randals is just cuz they were extra and I didn't feel like buying a new pair of trucks

u can get a shorter truck with stiff bushing and play with angle riser. it works for me. it doesnt go very loose but enough to do 90 degree turning

I use blood orange all around, wedges board side, riot plug, barrels road side, with atopic precision cups. Been stable up to 40mph. Still very surfy. Obvious change the duro for your weight(I'm 127lbs)

Rear, 86a wedge fat end toward board, 86a barrel, and atopic precision cup

The riot plug is on both trucks and sits in the bushing seat to reduce truck slop - dont mind the wax residue

yeah I've thought about that but they are harder to built a board from and u need to stuff all the batteries and electronics at the very end. unless u have some sort of flexible battery/enclosure. the duro is not that soft, i mean I'm not doing any serious downhill runs. what do u run on your downhill board?

Im using 83 B 93 R corn at front,  90 with inner core B 83 R with wedge.  but Im changing the back truck to both cored 90. its hard to balance on uneven surface. also thinking changing pivot cup to soft one so i can get smoother turning.
btw try using cored bushing. return to center is very good

why do u have the softer one boardside on the front? it would be more stabloe to have the 93 boardside. or is the softer turn fine for the speeds u go at? where do u buy cored bushings? I can barely find any info online even about their trucks

Softer bushing in the front gives you the turny. Please note I said I'm 127lbs. You need to look at bushing duro charts for weight reference.

I certainly dont understand why one punch is running softer board side though, as softer board side makes the board mushy, with a harder duro roadside making it less turny...probably feels numb under the feet.  But its all preference I guess.

Harder board side will give you stability, softer roadside will allow carving to be more lively. 

I'm a surfer at heart...so deep leans and carves with predictable linear turn feel is what I shoot for.

??? do u understand the physics of downhill/fast skating man? u want ur weight as far forward as possible to avoid wobbles. putting weight on a kicktail will make u less stable. it can be totaly fun at low speeds but as u get faster u really want to avoid putting ur back foot and the kicktail.

Have you tried riptide krank double barrel bushings?
They are riptide's highest rebound bushings. 
A friend who is a downhiller recommended them to me. I'm running them now on my caliber 2 clone trucks and on my Liquid precision trucks. 
Also, I have found that wider trucks feel more stable with soft bushings for a carving setup. 
My precision trucks are 200mm
My Caliber 2 clones are 218mm 
The 218's feel amazingly stable. 
The clone hangers are mounted on genuine Caliber2 base plates with riptide wfb pivot cups.

I was running other riptide barrels before switching to the Kranks. The kranks seemed much better to me. 
I love to emulate surfing on my Esk8 
The krank barrels allow me to go rail to rail hard and maintain good control.
I run the same setup front and back. 
I don't just turn with the front wheels. 
I like to turn with both front and back during low to medium speed carving. 10-15 mph

I have tried a lot of bushings and a range of duros. 
Now I feel that it's better to have soft bushings tight than to have hard bushings loose.
And I know some people like to mix duros and I have run harder bushings in the back but I don't mix duros on the same truck because when the hanger pivots, the bushings have to work together in unison but if they are not matched, there not gonna compress evenly. How can the hanger pivot smoothly and precisely when the top is compressing differently than the bottom?

Huh well I'm pretty sure the standard is to go hard and run them looser. Cuz if u just crank down soft bushings it will limit ur turning radius as well as damaging the bushings

But if you run hard bushings loose, there will be slop around the neutral position which will make your board unstable when your not turning
Using bushings that are soft enough to run tight and still turn because they are easier to compress will be more stable in my opinion. This is the conclusion that I have come to after a lot of experimenting

Because the top and bottom bushings are not loaded evenly.  The bottom (board-side) bushing is loaded more heavily and bears most of the riders weight. I almost always run one step harder on the bottom

Surprised no one has mentioned split angles

De-wedge your rear truck or run a lower angle baseplate in the rear.  Compensate with harder bushings to match.  We always run splits on downhill speed setups. Sometimes as much as 20-40° difference from the front to back.  Wedging this much is not practical, which is why a lower angle BP is preferred.   Since you are on Randals, search around for a 35° plate.  50/35 is a good start

Also, take your stock bushings and throw them away. They're all crap.  High rebound bushings make a world of difference.  Reflex (Abec11) are my favorite but tough to find now.  Venom and Riptipe make awesome bushings in multiple formulas in a range of duros. Unfortunately some dude on a forum won't be able to dial in your setup for you, so buy a bunch and experiment.  For a 50/35 split, I would probably run something like 85/87 upfront 92/95 in the rear

Personally I always run a split, unless I intend to be riding switch (e.g.,  freeride or tech slide setup). Often that means I am running 4 different durometer bushings...

What he said.
Most of my set ups (freeride/downhill) 
I run 45/30 (degrees).Then mostly super hard bushings boardside and then play around with the rest. 
Sadly every truck has a different turning and especially diving mecanic. And everytime I step on my Eboards I miss my ronin pro light / sabre trucks.

I mentioned split setup with the dewedge in my pictures above^^

Also you shouldn't be tuning your setup with kingpin tightness, you should be tuning your setup with bushing duros.

Basically if you noticed where my kingpin nuts are - bushings should be just tight enough that you can just barely spin them around the kingpin. If you can spin them easily, or can't spin them they're to tight or to loose. Bushings perform the best when they aren't precompressed by the kingpin tightness. Basically you want to define your turning/stability by bushing hardness, and washers used - not how tight or how loose the kingpin is.

Having a tight or loose kingpin makes it so the bushing changes the exponential of how the bushing performs over the throw of the lean. Where bushings that are just seated, that are the correct hardness for weight, that you can just barely spin. will have the same performance across the entire lean of the truck, making the feeling linear, and more predictable. Having a predictable setup under your feet over the course of the lean allows your mind to precisely account for the beginning of a wobble, your ankles learn exactly how much to compensate, where with the wrong bushings, the board isn't necessarily "at your will" so to say.

Bushings have more impact on how a board performs(feeling wise) then any other modifications - wheels, truck angle, kingpin tightness, and pivot cups. (however all of them important).

So as jmasta said, harder duro board side for stability, (Blood orange Wedges in my case, as more thane gives better rebound) and softer/smaller bushings road side allow you to tune your tune along with the shape of the washer. If your trying to reduce truck slop, get some riot plugs. 

Either way notable things 
-Kingpin should be just tight enough to slightly be able to spin the bushings in their seat with a good grip
-Bushings should be the same or harder duro boardside then roadside
-Running the same duro all around, with a 1 duro drop roadside front works well for most people
-Running harder bushings in the rear works well for alot of people.
-dewedging the rear for a 44/50 setup helps alot, and is good for about 35-40mph...faster and youll want to dewedge/use lower baseplate angles
-you want to be able to hit the rails consecutively in deep leans and not loose control
-you want controllable rebound/return to center, ie the truck holds the angle you want and returns to center when you want, you don't want to fight your bushings because they're the wrong duro. fighting your bushings is asking for wobs
-use the right bushings for the job, forget cones all together.  Wedges, eliminators, and barrels, should be the only types on your list for any type of speed. 
-use the right roadside washer, a flat washer with a barrel will be looser then a cup or precision cup, technically you can run a harder duro barrel with a flat washer, and still acheive the same feel as a softer duro with a restrictive precision cup.

Tons of good info in there!! Solid tips all around 



One more thing specific to electric skateboarding... If you run a rear single-drive like I do, heavily dewedging the rear helps reduce or eliminate torque steer!

This and running the motor toeside. If its on heelside it will have more authority :slight_smile: but its also dependent on speed

If your a cruiser and your foot is mostly across the board for 15mph toeside will be better. If you go fast alot and go into tucks with rear foot mostly pointed forward up on your toe, heelside will give less.

Ok, that makes sense.
I had not considered that aspect. I'm running 87s top and bottom. I'll get some 84s for the street side and try it.
I don't want to go harder on the board side because I love the cushy ride that I get with soft bushings and I practically never go over 20mph anymore.

Maybe I'm over thinking this but if the board side bushing is pre-loaded by rider weight, then isn't it as if it where a harder duro already because of the pre-compression? The more you compress the bushing the harder it gets.
So what if you ran the softer bushing board side and the harder bushing street side?
Would not the pre-compression of the softer bushing balance it out with the harder bushing?

I'm not trying to argue the point, I'm just throwing ideas out there and I'm willing to try just about anything to improve handling and stability.

Try it out both ways. You might like it!   I think I am actually using a slightly softer bottom bushing on my e-skate up front. No reason other than it felt better to me on this setup

There's no "right" answer, but I would keep the top and bottom bushings within one step of each other

A guy once told me that most wobble and instability comes from the back. My setup was also a little instable and dull in turns so i did the following:

Swapped paris front truck for caliber (rakeless and more restrictive bushing seat)

Wedged front for lively turns, dewedged rear for stability. The wedging made the most difference so i absolutely recommend this.

90A riptide chubby in rear boardside, stock paris barrel roadside, Which is 85a or such..? Kept my caliber II stock bushings.
I went with a chubby to give the center position more stability and less slop.
