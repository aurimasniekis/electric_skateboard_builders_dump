Hey,

I was wondering, suppose you have different duro for your front and back wheels, where would you put the softer wheels (front ? back ? depend on the motor positions ?....), and for what reasons ?

What would be the advantages and drawbacks of the different configurations (comfort, stability, efficiency,... if any) ?

i used to have purple kegels in front, organe kegels in back on a v2 boosted and it didn't feel right. totally rideable and could work if thats all you had but certainly feels wierd having two duros imo
