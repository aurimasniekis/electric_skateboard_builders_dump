I'm at the point where i can jump off stairs ~5ft and i ride down steps/jump/offroad all the time. For the first time i've broken my trucks, i don't want to stop doing these things, but i'm not sure how to fix this, any ideas? Has this happened to anyone else? I broke both trucks, in front and back, and both sides of each of those, the rear one actually had a chunk fly off while i was riding, and the other 3 anchor points are cracked right on the very top part of the curve that hugs the bolt.
