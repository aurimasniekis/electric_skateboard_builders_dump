Hey guys some news regarding Urethane Gear Drive. There were some design changes and some new stuff happening with this drive.

A design was changed to a sealed aluminium housing with a choice to submerge gears in oil for silent operation. (Oil fill port, V-Ring included). Now fits 6374 motors on all angles thanks to included CNC machine 230mm Caliber II style hanger made out of 7075 Aluminium with Titanium axles. (Maybe would fit 6380 at some angles).

FatBoy 230 Hanger will be available to buy separately for those who want to use 6384 with wider belts (should work with all Calibre || style mounts)

![34%20PM|472x419](upload://wVL9pFJXSuCgWKBpCsVUcI7vOlT.png)

Prices would be:

* FatBoy Mini Drive Train + FatBoy 230 Hanger would be 400€ (excl. VAT) + Shipping
* FatBoy 230 Hanger 100€ (excl. VAT) + Shipping

Prices can be decreased if we could make a group buy...

Now several questions:

# Would you be interested in buying one?

[poll type=regular public=true name="a"]
* Yes
* No
[/poll]

# If there would be a group buy would you participate in buying it?

[poll type=regular public=true name="b"]
* Yes
* No
[/poll]

Depending on answers we will decide to make this or not, because on the standard TB218 hanger without sacrificing gear quality and running into clearance issues is not really possible to run bigger motors than 6355. It does not apply to all decks but most popular decks and angles will run into issues. We don't want to release "working" product to the market.

Would it be possible to make the hangers like a few mm wider so the new 6380’s could fit at any angle…?

At horizontal position to the axle then motors doesn't touch the baseplate you can fit what you want in the center, lift up by 15º and then you turn it will hit baseplate.

So for the dual 6380's the hanger would need to be 242mm... Damn that's pretty wide, lol.

I recall discussing making a extended length hanger and you were saying that with the extra length you would be worried about the hanger potentially being able to bend or warp.  Have you gone with steel like I suggested for the hangers or did you do something else to prevent this from potentially happening..?

We are going with 230mm which is 12mm longer 6mm on the sides not noticeable difference plus CNC machined 7075 which is much stronger than casted and also titanium axles with normal thread at then end ;)

## \#10 Posted by: uigiroux Posted at: 2018-07-09T22:27:59.625Z Reads: 403

Do you have just an estimate of what that might cost?  $150, $200?  Just an estimate, no one is gonna come to you and say 'well I saw you said it be this price'. Lol :wink:

About how much further would the motors need to be away from the trucks (length of the gear drives) so that regardless of what size 63mm motor, they could all be used without any clearance issues?  I read one of the beta testers posts earlier he said he managed to avoid the clearance issue by milling his own base plate and using low profile bolts, and a few other things...  Just curious how much it would take in terms of extra length to where all these clearance issues could be resolved.

Can't tell you nothing, because I don't really know, and I think single unit will not be available, would require more than one unit to make it.

Regarding size, take now current size for e.g. 84-74 = 10mm and multiple by 2 that's how much longer hanger needs to be ;)

No I didn't mean clearance from the hanger, but if the gear drive put the motor a little further apart, how much further would they need to be so motor clearance wouldn't be an issue, using regular TB 218 trucks / hanger?

Which machining service do you use? 100 Euro/hanger sounds relatively cheap. Why are you using titanium over e.g. 17-4 ph stainless steel for the axle stubs and what's the hanger profile dimensions? 

Cheers

Submerging in oil sounds very cool, I hope it works out!

Will there be option to use TB 218 or standard Caliber II? Some people don't need that much power (dual 6374) and can definitely get away with dual 6364 or even single drive.
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: Kug3lis Posted at: 2018-07-10T12:48:08.139Z Reads: 365

```
We machine stuff on our own, apart titanium axles. We are using titanium to make the axles stronger as they are long and on wider stance can bend. I have seen many TB218 with bend axles... Hanger profile is similar to Caliber but without full bevel, but it should fit all mounts as all key surfaces match up ;)

@rpasichnyk I think yes, but don't know yet about buying single drive...

@accrobrandon yes if without hanger it's dual setup, but as I said some decks will have problem with 6374 but everything less than 60mm length should be OK, also you can run one in the front one in the back.

@Wraith it would support up to 6374. For this kit it is only for the flywheels 107mm. We have other kit which runs 125mm gummies to 8" tires from trampa on tb218 hanger

Have some good news :) Few prototype hangers are coming tomorrow, also prototype titanium axles coming this week, so will be assembling first hanger for testing.

Afterwards development with this gear drive will continue, also we are building dyno stand to test out gear drives and provide videos how does it work and sound for people who are interested :)

So stay tuned!

It would elevate the cost even more to make also baseplate... 10mm axle is not necessary as this 8mm titanium axle which is much stronger than steel.

Finally our Dyno stand for our esk8 gear drives is finished. We will be able to test gear drives more accurately at variable speeds and loads and fine adjust noise to lowest levels.

This is how our first prototype looks under heavy load pressing on them. (Sound is distorted as the test was done in small room and recorded with iPhone)

Will this drive be sticking with Flywheels over Kegals? At this point if the game I’m seeing Kegal Wheels a bit more reliable than Flywheels.... 


Though , there’s no 110 Kegals in existence and I’m thinking that 110 is chosen because it’s the minimum wheel for ground clearance?

One noticeable thing is that with this gear profile and combination gear noise by itself disappears compared to previous gear drives, just hard working motor and wheel noises..

Here is previous version from prototypes we sent out:

First, you are doing amazing work @Kug3lis , my plan in the future was to make my own drivetrain, but seeing the progress you’ve made on noise I may get one

Second, are you using grease or oil? In my head the grease would affect way less the sound than oil

And third, what about you getting some hard data on the noise so we can really see the differences? Using the same setup in the room and the same microphone we could compare everything easily

I personally use REW a lot for loudspeakers measurements, but the real time analyzer would fit perfectly for this

Even a simple dB reading for the same speed or set of speeds would be way more valuable than just the videos

Some update regarding prices and some surprise news :D

So we will be going to make a group buy sometime in September for this gear drive minimum quantity required is 20 kits.

* Group buy prices would be **300€** gear drive + **100€** for the hanger (**230mm** or **240mm** version)
* Hanger by itself will be also available (**230mm** or **240mm**) **100€**

_There is a possibility to get several kits right now but the price for the kit would be **450€**_

After 50 message request from many people like @Eboosted @Colson003 @Deckoz and others, we finally tried to adapt our gear drive to SurfRodz hangers but the problem is not enough aluminium to mount it on. So after spending several days tinkering and etc and some messages from people talking about different baseplate compatible hanger we got idea to "clone" SurfRodz hanger geometry and make it wider same as FB230 (FB240) which would be compatible with selected SurfRodz baseplate, just one requirement we would need at least 20 people ordering this hanger, it would be compatible with our all TB218 style drives and all other motor mounts for caliber style hanger and etc :)

We are using titanium to make the axles stronger as they are long and on wider stance can bend.

[quote="Kug3lis, post:40, topic:61387"]
8mm titanium axle which is much stronger than steel.

Hey wait a minute. Given same dimensions, steel is stronger than titanium. Titanium is lighter, and has some other nice properties, but is a lot more expensive as well.

Are you perhaps saying that, in the form you want, commonly available alloys of titanium are stronger than commonly available alloys of steel?

I have seen many TB218 with bend axles…

This just means TB218's choice of steel type was not optimal?

Okay, skimmed through this terrible thread ;) I don't think I can get away from this one.

The caliber style hangers, are they caliber dimensions or TB218 dimensions?

And I'm sorry to be ignorant, but what's the point of the SR hangers, with the caliber style ones available? Are SR baseplates so much superior to caliber? Tighter tolerances? Or is it because of available baseplate angles?

I have some gbomb brackets, that's another way you can get adjustable. But, I don't think I've ever changed the angle lol. So I think the extra expense, complication, bulk may not be worth it. Better in the long run to just buy a few baseplates.

OH NOES gbomb website is gone? :( :frowning:

And they've been up to a lot more craziness. torsion tail?

Fair enough, but the adjustable Base plated enable you to do some awesome things, hard to get or not.  But they other thing is, they just FEEL nicer, higher quality IMHO, and if I am spending this kind of coin, I want some nice base plates with it.....

So if my understanding is correct all you need is a SR baseplate for whatever @kug3lis's plans for the hangar and axles are gonna be and you should be good to go?

Well a set of adjustable base plates is $150, for regular base plates they are $45 each IIRC.  I do wish the base plates by themselves were a little cheaper.  But, I am not sweating a few bucks on a $1500-$2000 build.

## \#115 Posted by: Wraith Posted at: 2018-08-18T01:53:43.786Z Reads: 193

yeah that would be the ultimate solution in any case so better to go all in on a pair of $300 base plates than buying riser pads or different angled base plates?

I try not to cringe thinking about dropping $300 on a single truck part but those adjustable angles though...

Geared Ronin's would be a dream. I assume @Kug3lis wouldn't go that route due to more complex design and maybe patent issues
 
 Surfrodz are pretty good because they are machined so good tolerances. I think rkp would be the obvious choice for more stability vs tkp. 10mm should be used for more peace of mind for us heavier guys

No no no, we are making FB230 FB240 as replacement for TB218 but longer, and this gear drive is only for urethane at the moment ABEC 107mm.

We are also considering if there will be people interested in getting FB230 / FB240 style hanger but compatible with SR baseplate that means that top part will be compatible with SR and bottom like our normal hanger.

Maybe, even with 230 there is a lot of space... @Deckoz on TB218 hanger uses several washers to push away the drives several millimeters and it fits 6374. 

240 is longer by 10mm so it means it has 5mm on sides more so u will run 1mm Into baseplate I think there will be not much problem regarding that but I am not sure...

Gear drive on a Ronin baseplate would be amazing! Although I assume it would increase the cost of the hangers since they would need a queen pin hole. 

For reference Ronin precision baseplates are $75 each and there are a bunch of angle options available, even though they aren't listed on the website.

As soon as you can make these as quiet as the E-Toxx helical gears, I'm in :slight_smile:

Ronin hanger would require at least 20 people to collect to make it happen.

Regarding helical gears like I said 100x times apart lower noise there are not any more pros but only many cons that it's not worth it spend time and money on them. Many people have talked about minuses of helical gears and we are definitely not going to make them. Simple spur gears are bullet proof without any much issues, easy to setup, and doesn't cost arm and leg to make them.

Regarding noise, as many people tried to explain that gears are really hard to compare noise on camera as they have noise in different octave so audio recorders can't pick it up correctly. Best is to observe in person. As many of you already saw @Deckoz riding his _Master Evo_ its not much different from belt setup. That gear drive was first prototype, the latest one which everyone will get in group buy and in other versions like 1:3 for TB218 with newest gear profile is completely different. It removes gear clapping noise, reduces overall noise and just leaves unified gear sound I can't even describe it but it's much more silent compared to previous one. You can watch comparison video between first prototype and end version several post up in this topic.

I read your answer to why not do helical gears on the previous thread. I'm perfectly fine with all the downsides of helical gears. The most important thing is to get the tolerances perfect so that they are quiet and last as long as possible.

The E-toxx video of their helical gears is almost dead silent, about the same as direct drive and hub motors. Microphones pick up all frequencies heard by the human ear. Of course there will be a difference in resonance recording inside vs. outside but there is definitely a huge difference in sound between @Deckoz video and the E-toxx video I posted.

The whole drive is different from yours 1:3 ;) Its lot smaller for increased ground clearance.

On paper it should be more sturdier, less friction, better noise absorption properties. 

BTW I found old video of the first 1:3 for trampa we made so gears without cover were making less noise than tires :D

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh7Hm1LgK98

So that's the first design without any modifications to gear profile which noise is has a lot of reduced noise :)

Like what I said to you on a different messaging platform, no matter how high the clearance is people will find ways to scratch the gearbox. The point of having a skid plate is that when it accumulates enough beating from the ground, you can replace just that skid plate and not the entire gearbox shell itself.

Think about it this way, boosted sells skid plates that go around and protect the motor mounts. It's less expensive to replace the skid plate than to replace the whole truck + motor mount.

You can sell it as an accessory, and if done right wouldn't require modifications to existing drives. 

Here's a rough sketch of the idea

As far as I know when I asked about this as well, the newer wheel gear is what will be used on all gear drives. But @kug3lis also says that between the 1:3 and the urethane drive, theyre quite different and parts aren’t compatible so I think thats the only thing that they will likely share in terms of gear upgrade

Changing the position of the screw is good.
Maintenance and assembly will be easier.

A new cover design which helps for lubrication with better access for maintenance. 

We testing our new custom grease formula which dampens the sound by a lot compared to the previous grease we used. @ducktaperules have received a sample.
