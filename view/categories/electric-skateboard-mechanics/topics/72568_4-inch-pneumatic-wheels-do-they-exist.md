As the title says, does anyone know 4 inch pneumatic wheels or maybe just the outer wheel and tube without the rim? I have seen some but they have mega aggressive pattern for offroading, but i am looking for a streetpattern.

so frustrating, i want to build a commuter board that can be ridden in bad weather and dirty roads, with alot of comfort. PU is good, but i live in germany and we actually have seasons, not like California.
