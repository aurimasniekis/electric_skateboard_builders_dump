I have just received my Trampa 12mm skate trucks with Hypa wheels. Really nice!
Now the thing is I have a flat deck, and I have seen these trucks mounted on decks with a 15 degrees angle. So I was wondering if it would be a problem to put them straight on my deck (baseplate parallel to the bottom of the deck). Or should I put a pad in-between to have this famous angle.
The deck is about 100cm long and is meant for cruising/general commuting
Thanks

if you don't wedge them, i don't think they will turn well for you.  @Unik has this setup on a small flat board, but i believe he has them wedged.  Perhaps he can comment if he tried it without.  Again, i bet it's not nimble enough w/o wedges.

You could buy a normal skateboard style deck and mount the trucks on the kicktails. That would angle the trucks a bit. You could also just cut out some wood at an angle and use them as angled spacers.

Yes, if I have to that's probably what I'll do but I won't change the deck

Well, I think you have to make a compromise somewhere. The way I see it you either have to get a normal skateboard deck and mount the trucks on the angled kicktails OR get some big ass angled spacers (or make them of wood yourself) OR just buy a mountain board deck.

I think I'll just go for the angled risers. I had a look and actually they do not increase the height of the deck, which was my initial worry, it just rotates the truck slightly on its axle. And see how it looks if I go for channel trucks.

Yes, it's electric, with one motor to start (6374). I have bought the MBS ATS12 trucks instead, which are slightly bigger, and I will put 15 degrees risers (wood ones to see how it goes. Now I need to find the time for all that, plus the battery and figure out how to configure the VESC...

Hi jga! I'm in exactly the same boat as you- I'm planning a drop-deck with trampa trucks and tires, so I need 35 degree wedges. Slowly but surely, we can see it becoming a standardized part...
I'm waiting to see what @Unik comes up with for his group-buy, but failing that, gonna try it myself with aluminum, similar to @paragon and @dinodave.
A friend of mine also has access to a 3d printer that can do PC-ABS (poly-carbonate), so I figured, "why not?" and I'm now working on a CAD file for that. I'll compare all three, and report my findings.

For me the main problem is how to fix both the wedge and the truck. If you use only one bolt for the two, then your bolt head will be squint on the deck. That's the advantage of the @unik design: the wedge if fixed to the deck, and then the truck is screwed separately on the wedge (at least that's what I understood...). That means you need a hollow part in your wedge.

Anybody tried khiro wedges for this? It's what I'm planning to use.

[http://www.khiroskateboardproducts.com/RiserWedgeRailRiserPage.htm](http://www.khiroskateboardproducts.com/RiserWedgeRailRiserPage.htm)

If they work well for this, it might be a good alternative or something temporary until @unik finishes production on his final product.

You're correct about the basic design, it's generally a sort of "I" profile. Hollowing it out will reduce weight, but also risks weakening the whole part, so plan carefully. That's probably okay for metals, but I'm going to do my abs version completely solid.

I know, but that's in the US! I tried to order them from a shop, only 5 USD a set, but then 15,6 USD for shipping!
An on Amazon UK they only sell the full set of risers at 50 GBP! 
I give up. I think I will try the DIY solution for now.

Just thought I'd share my progress on the printed wedges while we wait for @unik to release his to the masses.
Being my first attempt ever at this, they're definitely in need of refinmant​, but hopefully they'll work. I made them somewhat thicker than I would have using metal, since I have no idea how the plastic will behave over time.
I ended up using ASA-X , a variant of abs that's used for engineering mechanical parts. I'll​ be happy to post the print profile if anyone's interested.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/19d96b1f274abe377a5f1b4390a7ee168c53d3a8.jpg" width="666" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/8/087a9fd1eac53ce129a1c168ae2cf500badd1423.jpg" width="666" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/2/b220701107a6695e69093866ea9af4d148abe962.jpg" width="666" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/d/6da243bb878217df5eca3ab50d50b1a79d397bfd.jpg" width="666" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/8/b8583a923d73ccf32348d31921f0809f03c7b6fd.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/8/f8d79e4054877933c0b8d02a67cc71764c32403d.jpg" width="666" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/8/d82fa66646f5f027076da3f85f73d4f52f22b1bc.jpg" width="666" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/7/57dc6732d40ebec7752b439f0a6aa97038a0b557.jpg" width="666" height="499">

I went a bit more integrated approach for mine 3D-printed angle pieces. I integrated the nuts directly into the piece itself, which saves up vertical space and you get the deck closer to the trucks.

Very nice! I'll definitely try your technique next time! I don't suppose you'd be willing to share the build file? 
I cant tell though, is your deck a drop-through? What material did you use? how thick is it? 
I don't have a printer of my own yet and mine cost $82 for the pair. I wanted to to make sure I would have something sturdy before I tried to do anything too fancy.

I'm building a new iteration of my board and I'm moving to the Trampa trucks, so I modeled and printed the angle pieces with pretty thin solid walls and infill, just to test the geometry. So I get the trucks mounted to the new deck and decided to test how everything would hold together, so I went to our lawn and just started jumping on the deck with full weight with the intention of inducing a failure. On the hard jumps I could hear the deck start to crack and decided to go ahead and see where it fails (picture below of results). The Angle pieces held up fine, but the deck cracked. I'd rather induce a failure in a safe environment, rather then faceplant on the road at speed when the deck gives out. I'm making changes and improvement to the new coming deck based on the results. The deck is shortened from 85 cm to 74 cm, width is increased from 24 cm to 26 cm and the trucks are moved further inwards to reduce their bending leverage to the deck.

The filament was PLA and with thin solid walls and infill, the total length of filament (1,75 mm dia) per piece was around 24 meters (for reference, a 1 kilo spool of 1,75 mm dia filament, holds about 330 meters). I'd estimate the price per prototype angle piece to be about 1 €, but I get free filament from a local 3d-printer building company. I will probably double the thickness of solid walls and infill once I have confirmed the fit on the new deck, just to make them more sturdy. Below images from blender, which I use to model.

EDIT: and the angle pieces are 35 degrees.
EDIT2: The current angle piece design has non-standard mounting holes to the deck, so it wouldn't fit directly to any normal decks. normal mounting holes for a truck are 1,625" x 2,5", but the deck facing holes are on the new piece 1,625" x 1,97" (50 mm)

EDIT3: I also prototyped a wheel gear for the Trampa SuperStar hub

I used Solidworks for mine.You could probably fix your mounting hole issue by extending the upper plate out a little, just enough to give you the space for the second set of deck-mounting holes in the front.
I did the same thing with stress-testing my board, just standing and bouncing on it- so far so good! (I'm rank newbie at this bty, can't even really ride it yet)
Ive always been a bit wary of PLA due to it's brittleness. Granted, it held up better than you deck here, I just prefer to have a bit of elasticity. That way I'll have at least a little warning if it starts to break.

The mounting hole situation is deliberate. It's to save a little bit of space on the new deck length wise and helps to offset the mounting holes from the deck and trucks so they don't "collide".

Below the CAD picture for the new deck. It fits a 10S5P 18650 pack.

And here's the problem illustrated that comes with the standard bolt holes.
Standard 1,625" x 2,5" holes on deck. The needed hollows collide within the piece, which causes the lower truck nuts to be unmountable inside the angle piece

With the non-standard deck holes the needed hollows inside the piece don't collide.

@SimosMCmuffin, I hope you don't mind, I had a go at your design using standard deck-hole placement. What do you think?
I'm debating also boring a cylindrical hole lengthwise through the center to save weight while retaining the structural strength.

It's fine, actually I'm glad that you did it yourself and you actually showed motivation to learn how to model using your preferred software.

I recommend doing a test piece first just to see if the size of the nut hole is correct and not either too loose or too tight.

The plywood itself is 15 mm thick with 11 plies. I have already re-designed the deck to be more sturdy and also shortened it and brought the trucks more inward to reduce the bending leverage the have on the deck.

They've held really well so far! 
Keep in mind that I'm an absolute beginner in terms of riding, so I haven't exactly TRIED to break them. I've done some pushing tests, jumped on the board a bit, haven't had any problems yet. @unik, what do yours weigh? Mine turned out quite bulky:

I wasn't sure what would happen, so I made them a bit thicker than was probably necessary. Now that I know they work I'm actually redesigning them based on the pic I posted a little while back, as well as @SimosMCmuffin idea:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/5/654aca5e3fda51659dedc04054200dc94a170545.jpeg" width="281" height="500">
It's more compact and it'll lower the clearance another centimeter or so. I still need to make sure the hexagonal holes for the nuts are the right size, then I'll have my 3D printer-owning friend print a pair.  
Speaking of, @DeathCookies you convinced me- I ordered a prusa i3 mk2 last week! Once I have it set up, I might just do a whole run of these for anyone interested. Only six more weeks till it ships...

Well, back to the drawing board. 
This one lasted through about ten minutes of not-too-vigorous flexing back and forth. It's white counterpart is still intact, but that's not saying much.

No, this was done with ASA-X, that's what puzzles me. That stuff is supposed to be at least as strong as ABS. 
I had thought that printing sideways would be weaker, but maybe I was wrong. It does make sense that it snapped at the thinnest point though.
I'll be happy to share the file! I'll upload it through google drive tomorrow.

I would not mess around making adapters and build your own decks. Just get a 15° Trampa deck and you are sorted.

@flywithgriff MBS trucks are garbage. I had the Matrix 2 trucks and sent them back right away. @trampa's stuff is top notch.

frank, in my case, I'm looking to replicate @okp's build on a 29" long deck.

Personally I don't like the skate trucks for e-boards. We use spring trucks. I also dont like to mount the trucks underneath the deck because you stand above the pivot point of the truck.

The low-profile riser, as requested! Special thanks to @SimosMCmuffin for the original idea! 
This is a sort of "base" version, and I'm working on improving it. Maybe I'll offer it for sale, maybe not, dunno...

It is, I printed it with ASA-X, which is a very strong type of abs plastic, but you might get good results with regular abs too. I've heard others prefer pc-abs or nylon, I was just advised to use ASA-X.

i do not really want to use risers at all, because the deck is already crooked enough (?), that is the question about it.

I could buy a pair of trampa infinity trucks for 50 bucks, seems a nice price to me.

also, is it possible to get a caliber II motormount on the trampa trucks?

@Acido but i can turn the board even when the trucks are straight mounted and not angled?

I second what jga said, there's a reason trampa decks have those upward flares where you mount the trucks. The only option for a flat deck is to use angled risers. If the height is a problem for you, you can try using a drop-down deck.
Edit: just googled landyachtz evo. Why that deck specifically? Those truck angles look tough to work with.

i wanted a drop deck for my next build. 

but all dropped decks are to low. Also the form of the deck is great for mounting motors on the bottom.

and i like the design.

@JonathanLau1983 this is way too much work, i could easily buy other trucks before i'd do this. i just have the option to get some cheap trampa trucks

When you say too low, do you mean too much height difference between the deck area and the truck mounting area? There are all different measurements for that. Mine has quite a bit, at 2cm height difference, others have less.
For the most part you can use whatever you want, just remember to design your risers accordingly.
I didn't see any way to mount my motors under the deck so mine are in the back like most mountainboards.

the deck is not already “crooked enough”.

you need atleast a 30 degree angle on both trucks to be able to turn at all. trampa trucks mounted on a flat board are 0 degrees.
