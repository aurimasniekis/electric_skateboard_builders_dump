```
An updated version of our original idler drive. This model is compatible with almost all 63mm motors. We are milling the production fixture plates for these today and will be offering them after we finish producing what we need to update our FreeRide decks. I'll do my best to keep this thread updated with design details for other builders looking to adapt our designs.

A few key features of this mount are the integrated cooling fins, they help reduce weight and heat produced by the motors. We have also carried over our signature adjustable idler from our V1 motor mounts. 

All of this will be paired with our machine matched hanger/drivepulley design on Ronin Cast trucks. More details on that to come, if you follow our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXVafTCg4U1/?taken-by=ollinboardco) you already know what it looks like. 

Enjoy the rendering. Time to make the chips fly!

Built a dual-operation fixture, seems like the best option for a limited work area. These little brass cam-lock clamps are so nice! Wish I started using them sooner, great for 2 sided milling.

Made a small change to the design yesterday. Brought the raised section around the motor all the way up to the model top. Much better lines when all assembled and it should guard the motor vents a little more.  Used a boring function and a 1/4inch ball end mill to create the long chamfered inner slope.

is there any way to make a batch compatible with caliber trucks? I feel like its a huge missed opportunity to move some serious volume with these since the majority of people have calibers/caliber clones? I wanna support ollin board company as much as possible but sadly instead buying 2 of these for dual diaganol I have to go with a competitor because of compatibility. I dont want to have to buy 2 new trucks and 2 new motor mounts, especially as a city rider. :( makes me sad that I wont have these to brag about alongside my ollin vesc!

For a precise fit cast trucks needs to get machined (brand aside).

Not from chaka but I think it applies here:

Our current design requires some customization on the trucks for a precision fit, and calibers are not thick enough for the new design either. I will show how this all comes together soon. Everything is integral to the pulley running on a custom shaft/hanger. We will be offering the drive without wheels or motors to bring the cost down in a dual or single package.

i'm about a hair away from taking a belt sander to my cast ronins to see if i can get caliber style mounts to slip onto them. I've had a set of CRs sitting on my shelf for almost a year. The profile on them is terrible for mounts, every time i try to draw something up i get pissed. 

@chaka how are you shaping your CR hangers? i just imagine you have some crazy jig set up that does it very neatly.

but you can get a single caliber clone for $20. Ive run into exactly 0 issues with my caliber clones and its never crossed my mind that Ive needed to upgrade. I also feel that in the diy community that Im assuming this product is targeting, the "no two trucks are the same" issue is easily worked around. I filed down a small piece of a credit card to fill the gap between my motor mount and truck axle and now it fits like a glove. Its such a small margin that I still think it makes more sense to target the most widespread truck. Especially considering that most of the outrunner prebuilt market is using calibers, its all the more reason to target calibers, even if Ronins are "better anyways". Getting people to seperate from their money is hard enough, getting them to do it twice for one product is even more of a challenge.

Can pick up cast Ronin's for under $40 each. Maybe people are confusing them with the expensive precision Ronin's?

So for $20 more per truck can enjoy the far better tracking and turning. 

I personally like avoiding the emergency room and these Ronin's track so much better over pavement irregularities I can't imagine going back to Caliber or Paris.

im just commenting out of love for your company and the incredible products you make, but I really feel like you guys are going to miss out on sales not only by not being designed for the most popular diy/prebuilt truck but now also requiring customization on what is already a more expensive truck that, while most agree it is an upgrade from calibers and caliber clones, its not like caliber clones are unridable or fragile. You miss out on Boosted boarders that want better mounts, you miss out on the guys who just want a mount upgrade but dont want to bother with replacing trucks, and you also miss out on the people who dont mind upgrading their trucks as well but, like me dont want to make any cosmetic modifications because of either convenience or lack of access to the required tools. Im really hoping Im not coming off as offensive btw i just want to see you guys dominate the market ;)

edit: ill never forget a quote from our meetup in London from the guy with a raptor R2. He didnt care what was cheaper or better, he just wanted something that worked when he got it.

@Ulfberht using 6061 with a lot of success. 

@guyguy @jmasta @CSN @FredSaberhagen Thanks for the kind words! 

@longhairedboy I use a lathe and shape several different dimensions into the truck hanger. One dimension for the drive pulley and two more for the mount. I use a micrometer and bring it in within .001"     It is insane what a difference having machine matched motor mounts and truck hangers makes.

No worries @itsmikeholland, I know you want whats best for us! ;) 

I'm sure it is pretty clear that I care a lot about things "just working". The whole reason I started working on a drive system was necessity. I needed something that worked and didn't need to be adjusted constantly. This is hard to do when matching machined parts to a cast hanger. The tolerances are just too loose.

you probably never tried ronins, right? precision, agility, stability, damping - all in a completely different world compared to caliber style, especially for single sided motor systems. its a miracle to me that not everybody is already running ronins by now :slight_smile:

@chaka beautiful mount, loved your old one already amd its great to see you switch to ronins. ;)

i milled down a ronin hangar myself and for full circle contact mount<->hangar the diameter of the cast hangar becomes really small and I was afraid of the edge hangar<->milled part of hangar notch effect, which is even more pronounced with the large diameter difference. not really an engineer, but i know some basics of my physic studies. did you do anything to ease out the effect like with rounded edges or stuff like the wiki picture of the notch effect:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/thumb/a/a3/Entlastungskerbe.svg/220px-Entlastungskerbe.svg.png

this is the main reason i like the way @nowind ronin mount is attached - its minimal invasive to the hangar.

Im down to try Ronins machined trucks and wouldnt mind the upgrade! Im nearly positive I would love them, I see it like driving a Camry vs a high end BMW or Mercedes. even though they beat the camry in literally every way, Camrys still do the job at the same fraction of the price as Ronins vs Calibers. Looking at Ronins site it looks like the cheapest ones are $90/pair, but theyre cast. Isnt cast trucks an issue? The only others that arent cast are the Katanas that are $450! :open_mouth:

```
The argument here is that Ollins trucks are machined and as a result come out extremely precise. Cast trucks like the caliber clones and even cast Ronins apparently have too much deviation to mass produce a machined mount for since not every cast truck will be exactly the same. For example, I have a machined motor mount from torque boards and a cast caliber clone also from TB and in order to get a snug fit on the truck I had to file down a piece of a credit card to fill in the space between the mount and the truck axle. 

At least thats my understanding. Being machined and marketed for machined Ronin trucks means that basically nobody will have an issue with compatibility as long as they read the description.

The Ronin's work better because they have two pins which prevent the truck from wallowing around.

and no motor mount fits perfectly on them because they are cast. My argument for just saying screw it and machining the ollin trucks for calibers anyways is that, at least to me as a consumer, the majority of the DIY builders are finding a way to make it work with caliber clones. Ollin mounts are quite obviously the most superior mount, and I would totally sand down another corner of a credit card to make them fit on my cheap trucks.

Im not arguing that Ronins arent better, its just that Ive literally never NEEDED to upgrade my caliber clone because, while there are better alternatives, it was $20 and I have literally had 0 problems with my clones, which is why I havent upgraded. You can have a BMW rep set up outside a Toyota dealership and he'll probably convince 100% of the people that BMWs are better in every way, but most people will still just buy a Toyota.

I also want to clarify that I dont think Ollin is making a mistake, only greiving that mounts arent something I can just painlessly upsell people on because they require other specific components to be of use. Any time somebody had questions about a speed controller I could sing till the cows came home about how excellent Ollin product and costumer service is and can easily justify the premium for a chaka vesc because its as easy as swapping out just one item the the shopping cart

I step it down with rounded corners, The area under the mount actual has very little material removed, not full circle. just the corners have been rounded.  Ronins also have very high quality steel axles. Makes a very big difference in strength.

anything special about the trucks except for the precision look? 

most "precision trucks" stand no chance against the steering precision of cast ronins, because they are just pretty much slightly lighter normal trucks with good looks.

@whitepony the main difference you will find in machined trucks with threaded axles is they will be "true". Virtually all cast trucks are not exactly straight, brand new cast trucks are almost always bent or out of alignment. A tighter tolerance on axle thickness also plays a big role in reducing slop in your bearings.

Here is a good write up on the "precision" of cast trucks. https://nelsonlongboards.com/blogs/blog/15642889-how-precise-are-your-cast-trucks-the-longboard-truck-showdown-part-1

1. I like to have a balanced board, I ride fast and corning on a dual rear is fine until you hit a rough patch in the road and the tail end teleports away from you. Balancing the weight makes the board more predictable.

2. Torque steer... never had any issues. Regardless, the queen pin isolates any unwanted movement on the Ronin trucks.

3. 6085 is the actual size of those cans, I list motors at their actual size for builders to judge if they will fit within their design constraints.

Almost time to start taking orders on our V2 idler drive! The mounts will be available with ronin trucks, drive pulleys and belts. Available with kegel/popoca or flywheel adapters, the flywheel adapters will be a little more expensive due to the extra material and machining they require.

Dual diagonal starts at $439.95 and comes with ronin trucks, kegel/popoca wheel adapters, belts and pulleys. Motors and wheels not included at this price. Single drives also available!

The stock ronin truck is set at 42.5 degrees. If you want to go fast I recommend upgrading the rear base-plate with a precision 25 degree base-plate for an addition $75.

I guess I should do a little break down on the components and pricing since you are talking about selling your guns. 

Ronin trucks + milling services - $120   -    We charge $15 per truck for machining services.

2 x kegel/popoca adapters $51.90

2 x 36t wheel pulleys - $69.90

2 x 16t motor pulleys - $24.90

2 x idler pulley - $39.90

2 x oversized bearings for drive pulley - $15.90

2 x timing belts - $12.95

2 x motor mount with 608 shaft stabilizer bearing - $104.50

A little over $50 per motor mount!

I think this is the crux of it. 

It doesn't look like a gun at all to me either but I've even had people react to my remote even when it was hanging from my wrist by the strap - what kind of gun would you even hang by a wrist strap! So yeah, it definitely seems dumb to me whenever someone asks if the remote is a gun, to me it doesn't look like anything close. Then the conversation usually goes with me saying, "no it's a remote" while I open palm it out for them to see followed by them replying "well it still looks like a gun." In Chicago there's a cocktail of ignorance and violence that has lead to hypersensitivity and fear. There had been a ban on guns in the city up until the Heller Supreme Court case, so, most people in the downtown and northern areas (the more affluent areas) have never even seen a gun before but they've sure read about gun violence or seen it on the news. After that case went through there was a lot of hysterics regarding the legalization of concealed carries within the city limits, which you can now have but pretty much every building downtown bans entry if you're carrying. Then there's the police force, which I have an incredible amount of respect for, where they have to make split second reads on how you hold your hand and arm -- it's no wonder that they've misidentified wallets, cellphones, et cetera as weapons. After I was asked the 3rd time I knew it wasn't a fluke anymore, it's just the region I'm in so I guess when in Rome... you gotta paint your remotes bright colors.

Those are the older style flywheels (god I want a set of the pink ones) so you would have to remove about 12mm from the inside of the wheel.

The superflys already have the inner lip taken down so they should fit right on

If you want these sooner we can do a little group buy of 10 sets to get the ball rolling a little faster. I think we can manage a 10% discount if anyone is interest in reserving a set. We can personalize the trucks a bit more too if anyone wants other color combinations, different bushings/baseplates or gear ratios.

@Michael319 14t is an option. I'll get a listing going this evening and work out the production schedule so everyone has a solid time frame on expected delivery. 

The stock "fruit punch" bushings should be fine for you. If you end up needing something softer we can switch it out but I think you will like the stock bushings if you like it on the softer side.

I like the stock bushings but I change out the boardside/rear bushing for an "ice tea" 95a bushing.

The stack height is important so be sure to check bushing height if you use another brand.

You can make cast ronins into what we call, "almost precision ronins" (did this for years before I could afford my first set of ronin lights. 

1.) Get a top hat washer, which goes into your bushing annd around your kingpinnn = a lot less slop.
2.) A good pivot cup

That expression was used so much, that you find almost precision "kits" for almost anny trucks. E.G

Remember what I ask you about fabricating a dedicated MBS 100 mm wheel pulley with sprockets? Well, surprisingly there is non available on the market yet. Non!! All you can find out there are 3D prints out of ABS (or perhaps Nylon) with their own set of bolts, nuts an retainers like a Lego... they are always universal wheel pulleys 'that should' fit MBS 100s hub openings  'because they are supposedly similar' as Flywheel Clones. If they are manufactured for Clones, may fit MBS. But if they are manufacture exclusively for ABEC Flywheels, will not fit MBS hub openings (because they are slightly smaller). On top of all, most come for 9 mm and 12 mm wide belts. Few or none for 15 mm (which are esk8ers preferred choice) all come with bolts and retainers, none with sprockets ready to insert and go. Zero aluminum wheel pulleys with sprockets. However they may come, there are STILL NO dedicated 36T, 40T, or 44T wheel pulley manufactured exclusively on aluminum with sprockets for the MBS 100 mm hub openings. There you have a niche. :point_left::thinking:

Our new abec design only features 3 "prongs/pins" you still need to use fastener in the three voids if you are using another drive system/motor mount. Right now MBS is at the bottom of the list of things to do here in the shop. Kegel/Popoca hubs are on deck now, Abec flywheels are next. I am a little apprehensive about the MBS cores/hubs. I think they are ABS and not reinforced nylon/glass ? I'm worried of the breakage, if someone can confirm the core material is reinforced nylon/glass I will make some adapters.

@chaka ...
What's the status on the Abec 11 adaptors/pulleys?

Interested in a dual setup as soon as the pulleys are done.

Oh and dumb question...this is a 15mm belt setup correct?

I believe 12mm. Could be wrong though.

They are on the work list but I am going to be completely honest. These new wheels with the kegel core are way better than abec flywheels in terms of ride quality so the incentive to make and supply abec adapters is fleeting. I spent the weekend switching between the two wheels, 75a abecs and the 78a labeda thane and the difference is huge. I really like Chris too so saying this isn't easy.

It is a 12mm belt drive, together with the idler it is more than enough width. In fact we could step it down to 9mm and probably still run without issues but the 12mm adds that extra headroom so to speak. If I were hypermiling or competing in an endurance race I would probably switch down to 9mm for more efficiency so going up to 15mm when it isn't necessary would be bad for performance due to the losses the extra width would create.

A single set carries a $23 to $32 shipping charge for international orders

I can fit 3 sets in a medium flat rate box and I think they ship almost anywhere for roughly $66 usd.

If you order 16 sets we can ship in bulk for roughly $150 to $200 in international shipping charges.

[new cast ronins will be released mid feb...](http://www.ronintrucks.com/shop-2/complete-sets/) their billet trucks have shrunk in width with three size options available, being adjustable with a 5mm spacer on each axle: 144-154mm, 154-164mm & 164-174mm. The way the truck designs are going the hangers are getting more triangular which makes less room for motor mounts... but who knows Chaka could have done a deal with Ronin? so wait and see...

...the new Ronin trucks. The 'Katana'. According to them, they poured everything they know into these new model. 174 mm seems the m√°ximum lenght but you can still order longer axles for free ride and sludge applications (that's us, is just that they don't know It).

Ronin may have that in the description, but they decided to stick to selling the 164mm as the max width for their precision billet trucks, which you have shown. I don't think they're going to budge too much since most downhill boarders aren't going to use 180mm or longer width for their needs...

When they first released their new Katana models, they DID have 174mm up there as an option, but removed it a week later.

And I think...some esk8-ers won't care about the 160mm width and will use them anyway...

Wanted to share a few pictures and impressions from my build.  I‚Äôll do a more complete build thread outside of this thread once I get a new deck.  The deck you‚Äôll see pictures of below snapped in the back!  

Overall, this is a fantastic drive system.  My previous build was with hub motors, and this is a more efficient system with barely any loss in roll resistance compared to my hub motors due likely to the idler.  The torque transfer is direct without any torque steering.  I‚Äôm using some sk3 192kv motors from @barajabali, and they work beautifully with this drive ‚Äî very smooth acceleration and braking.  I don‚Äôt have the sensors installed yet.

Ronin trucks are a dream compared to the Paris trucks I was using before.  I don‚Äôt have a lot experience with different trucks and bushings, but the setup I have now feels more confident when carving than my Paris with hub motors.  They also feel like they help stabilize the board when I  commute over horrible DC city streets. 

Whole build quality of Chaka‚Äôs work is top notch. It‚Äôs easy to swap out wheels, adjust idler, and adjust angle of the mount.  I expect this drive system will be a part of my future builds.

Here‚Äôs a brief build summary:
- Dual Ollin idler drive 
- Ollin 4.12 VESCs
- 10s3p 30Q from @barajabali
- Dual sk3 192kv, running uncensored  
- 90mm Popoca wheels
- Globe Maiden deck, 33 inch wheelbase.  This snapped so looking for other deck recommendations that will work well with a dual diagonal 

Pictures!

having ridden those trucks and still using them for DH/racing I can tell you that the applications those trucks are designed for has almost nothing to do with esk8ting.

Its not about comfort, carving. Its only ment for performance and grip. Also you would have to be the biggest shreddder this planet has ever seen on an esk8 to warrant such a purchase imao.

Trucks that are ridden with a ridiculous weight shift, almost always super low rider profile, weight extension direction over the trucks. Versus our upright position, more front-back weight distribution than sideways etc. 
You get a better feeling and more out of trucks that are a 5th of the costs of a set of katanas.

I think it took 6-8 weeks, but I placed an early order before Chaka had everything sorted out.  I also had him switch which side the mounts went on since I‚Äôm goofy footed, and wanted the front drive wheel under my heel.

You can write him via his website, and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be happy to tell you whether he has anything in stock.  If you want custom, like me, it might take longer.
