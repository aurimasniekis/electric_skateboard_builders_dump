Hi everyone. 

I am looking for a STL file that can be used to print a 66T pulley for my 6x2 steel hubs.

The hubs can be seen here

I have no idea If the hubs are good or not, havent tried them myself, so cant speak for their quality.

@nikoli280 you could also get vex robotics versa pulley and just use a tiny 3D printed adapter.  You can find all your options here.
