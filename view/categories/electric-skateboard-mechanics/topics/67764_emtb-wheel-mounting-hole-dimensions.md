Hey guys, 
I'm looking around to make some adapters for trampa and mbs hubs, but I am not finding the most accurate dimensions on the hole spacing. 

So far I've got:
Trampa superstar - 5 hole, center to center (hub to hole) 36mm
Trampa Hypa - 6 hole, center to center, 40.5mm

Do those measurements seem right?

Also still looking for measurements for
Trampa Primo
Mbs

Cheers
