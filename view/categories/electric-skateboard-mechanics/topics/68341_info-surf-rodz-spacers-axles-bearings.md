As a lot of you know, one of my drug dealers...I mean skate hardware vendor... @psychotiller, has bamboozled me into a rather massive Surf Rodz addiction.  I'm a huge fan.  PT's mounts are incredible and never fail.  That coupled with precision quality trucks...it's not hard to see why I like them so much. 

I've spent some time figuring out spacers & bearings for Surf Rodz trucks (both RKP & TKP since both use multiple lengths of 10mm axles).  This doesn't take into account that you get spacers with the axles when you purchase them from SR directly, @psychotiller also includes spacers with his SR truck kits as well.  I just found myself in a circumstance where I needed axles and spacers and bearings as I had he trucks but none of the aforementioned parts.  This post contains the results of that research.

Let start with requirements.  With an 80mm axle you will need 30mm of total spacer for the correct fit for each axle.  You will also need a 10mm spacer between the bearings in each wheel.  After searching, this is what I have found to be available and quickly sourced as of 09/17/18.

[**Surf Rodz 10mm x 10mm spacer Kit**](https://www.surf-rodz.com/products/truck-parts/10mm-x-10mm-spacer-kit)
$16.00 pack of 4, $4.00 each

[**Khiro 10mm x 10mm Longboard Skateboard Bearing Spacer**](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/products/2309/khiro-10mm-x-10mm-longboard-skateboard-bearing-spacer)
$5.95 pack of x4, $1.48 each

[**aluminumspacers.com 10.2mm ID x 16mm OD x 10mm Long Aluminum Spacer**](http://www.aluminumspacers.com/mas16-10-10)
$1.27 each
and
[**aluminumspacers.com 10.2mm ID x 16mm OD x 30mm Long Aluminum Spacer**](http://www.aluminumspacers.com/mas16-10-30)
$1.37 each

The Surf Rodz spacers are solid and beefy, good spacers to use but very expensive per piece.  The Khiro spacers are usable but the OD is less than that of the SR spacers and generally don't look as good or feel as solid.  The aluminumspacers.com spacers are as solid as the SR spacers and much cheaper.

Here's a cost breakdown for a complete build using a single set of Surf Rodz trucks (x2), assuming 80mm axles (subtract a single 10mm spacer per axle if using 70mm axles).

The cheapest method is to use x4 30mm & x4 10mm aluminumspacers.com spacers

|QTY|PRODUCT|COST EACH|COST SUBTOTAL|COST TOTAL|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|4|10.2mm ID x 16mm OD x 10mm Long Aluminum Spacer|$1.27|$5.08||
|4|10.2mm ID x 16mm OD x 30mm Long Aluminum Spacer|$1.37|$5.48|$10.56|

The next cheapest is using Khiro 10x10 spacers.
|QTY|PRODUCT|COST EACH|COST SUBTOTAL|COST TOTAL|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|16|Khiro 10mm x 10mm Longboard Skateboard Bearing Spacer|$1.48|$23.68|$23.68|

The Most expensive is using SR 10x10mm spacers (as in ridiculously expensive).

|QTY|PRODUCT|COST EACH|COST SUBTOTAL|COST TOTAL|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|16|Surf Rodz 10mm x 10mm spacer Kit|$4.00|$64.00|$64.00|

Now onto bearings.  I am not a fan of the bearings that Surf Rodz sells.  The 1st set I got from them are still going strong.  The 2nd and third sets had defects.  One set was slightly larger than 22mm OD so press fitting was difficult and resulted in a lot of rolling resistance.  A couple out of the other set did not roll well from the start.  So I went on a search for 10 x 22 x 6mm bearings, this is what I found.

[**Surf Rodz 10MM Bearings (AA3-130-A1**)](https://www.surf-rodz.com/products/truck-parts/10mm-bearings)
$10.00 for a set of x8 bearings + shipping

[**FastEddy 10x22x6 Rubber Sealed Bearing 6900-2RS**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/10x22x6-Rubber-Sealed-Bearing-6900-2RS-10-Units/142101569350?hash=item2115e9df46)
$9.99 for a set of x10 bearings + $2.99 shipping

[**10 Pcs 6900Z 10 x 22 x 6mm Single Row Sealed Deep Groove Ball Bearings J5M7**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/10-Pcs-6900Z-10-x-22-x-6mm-Single-Row-Sealed-Deep-Groove-Ball-Bearings-J5M7/122935555250?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649)
$3.27 for a set of x10 bearings + Free shipping

Here's the cost breakdown.

|QTY|PRODUCT|COST EACH|COST SUBTOTAL|
|---|---|---|---|
|8|Surf Rodz 10MM Bearings (AA3-130-A1)|$1.25|$10.00|
|8|FastEddy 10x22x6 Rubber Sealed Bearing 6900-2RS|$0.99|$7.92|
|8|Chinese MGF 6900Z 10 x 22 x 6mm Single Row Sealed Bearings|$0.33|$2.64|

Regarding quality, I've already covered the SR bearings.  The FastEddy bearings were the best quality and I've been using for a couple of weeks now with no issues.  The Chinese MFG bearings are surprisingly good.  I don't mind a sealed bearing, a lot of people do because the resistance is slightly higher.  I did a WH test between the 2 sets and there was no discernable difference, the calculated value showed .014 WH per mile usage more on the Chinese MFG bearings, but that is well within the margin of error as no ride is ever completely the same.

This isn't all of the 22x10x6mm bearings that are available, but they are the ones I could get my hands on quickly and weren't aircraft grade at $60 each :).

In closing, I hope this little bit of research will help you decide to buy Surf Rodz trucks as they are arguably the best precision quality truck for esk8 on the market, specifically within the price point.



**EDIT 1**
The reason Muirskate has the Khiro 10mm spacers is because I asked them to get them.  This was before I bought spacers from aluminumspacers.com.  So when they got them in stock, I went ahead and bought them.  They are great for wheel spacers though as the OD isn't really important for that installation.

**EDIT 2**
Another user was looking for axle info, so I'm gonna post it here as well just in case someone ends up here looking.

RE bearings, I may have just gotten a bad batch.  I actually ordered 3 set at the time and gave 1 set to @sender.  I don't think he's had any issues.  But both of the other sets on that order were essentially useless to me.  

SR doesn't make those bearings and Im sure a .2mm outer race issue was not visible to the naked eye.  I could probably have called/emailed and got them replaced but I chose to look at other bearings just an exercise in research.

Very informative! Although, I'm not sure @psychotiller want's his trade secrets out there. Oops! Did I just tattle? :grin:  . 

Those Fast Eddy's bearing are made  for high RPM R/C cars so you figure they should work well. If you can find them, Sovereign Speed 10mm bearing are the shit, also. I've got a hole slew of 10mm spacers from Aluminum Spacers to fine tune with. I've also used these as kind of speed rings and fine tuning: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WW71JUE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

It came just the right time considering my surfrodz and sixshooters order
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/help-me-upgrade-my-boards-drivetrain/67992/45
Ordered a set of Chinese bearings. For 2.8 Euro for the set I can throw them away instead of messing with cleaning them.

I didn't include bushing info because bushings are pretty subjective.  I will spend weeks dialing in bushings.  My kid gets so pissed when I'm on a new board.  Ill stop to change out a washer or bushing and he looks around and is like "What the hell, where did he go?"  And I'm sitting on a curb half a mile away using a hex wrench I had in my pocket :slight_smile:.

I keep a few 10mm speed rings around, just for tuning, but they aren't necessary with SR's.

Another protip...don't throw away old bearings.  Pull the inner race out and clean it up, they make great 6mm spacers.

I think the major thing there is you need 90mm axles.  Otherwise you will likely have to do some machine work.

Just use Zealous bearings (built in spacers & washers/speedrings) and be done with it. If it's good for taking your longboard downhill at 70 mph+, then it's good enough for my electric skateboards. I'm also sure there are 10mm alternatives for our requirements.

Thank you for this info @mmaner . Just ordered my mounts from PT and spacers from the recommended site. 

Going to switch both boards over to TKP's for that carvy goodness. It'll also finally allow me to forward mount my motors on the Evo Falcon with Alan's enclosure, rkp's just don't give you enough space.

In a strange turn of events the easiest way for me to get some TKP's in the UK is to drive and buy them from a skate store an hour away that doesn't have a website. Crazy business. If I order them in from PT or surfrodz the import and customs fees will be the same price as the trucks :smiley:

Quick addition. For people in EU/UK I found the washers:

The spacers however I could not find with the right ID, I ended up buying them from the US as not to waste too much time digging around but I'm sure they can be found over here easy enough with some searching.

What are the dimensions of the surfrodz bearings? I figured 10mm id bearings would be 10x22x7 instead of the standard 8mm id bearings being 8x22x7. 

You state the other 10mm bearings being 10x22x6 (6902 series). Would that not give you 2mm space missing in the wheel?

I guess it doesn’t matter as long as they aren’t wider. 
Searching for 10x22x7 only gets me the 62900 series and there isn’t much choice for those.

Surf Rodz has multiple kingpin options, I'm not sure of dimensions on any of them but I'll check the spares I have when I get home.

EDIT: I looked up what is available on the SR site.  It looks like 2.25in, 2.50in and 2.75in long but no clue on the other dimensions.

Its crazy that you can use a 100mm shoulder bolt. What motors could you fit with that :heart_eyes:

Also. That new caliber truck for esk8 seems inferior to these surfrodz. You can get them for basically the same price and can fit 6374 motors

You can fit longer shoulder bolt but much after the 74mm cans you run out of truck to fit them on. Mounts don’t hang on too well to the spacers!

Yeah this is what I designed for that gear drive we were talking about last week. The Clamp sits on the edge of the hanger. And the plate is hanging over the axle and is screwed into the clamp. And the plate is recessed like 4mm to create 8mm space for a dual drive system - this way sk3 fit

Then I forgot about them and then someone here at the forum said they were having a sale last June and I contacted them again. They finally got back to me and I had them after another week. 

Other then this service is great as long as they respond.

It's good to hear they do actually ship across the water but I think it was a happy situation in the end. Shipping inside the US is free and getting to us via private shipping works out much less. So I suppose if you have a contact on the other side it's better to have them buy the trucks for you?

@moon

reconsider that hanger mount.  you don't need six contact surfaces - only three.  Two for alignment and one to apply pressure to.

Consider this:

https://a360.co/2OMnxXH

![TKP%20MOUNT%20092018%20v3|625x500](upload://bWCyJF6NAWisyN3PUbuqVdYLJjX.png) 

The oversized hole allows for quick on/off with zero issues due to hanger variation, and the single setscrew means you don't have to mess with it too much to get good alignment.

You can kindof see how it works here:

![20181007_184545|375x500](upload://ndULB2iUKHNSchi0GZ8CHHkgtk6.jpeg) 

I'll have the drives back at the end of the week (hopefully) and can take pics then.

Wow thanks :smiley:

I dont know much about these trucks, after I insulted them and called them golden gullwings from a glance :joy::joy:

Is the setscrew trustworthy? I don't have these trucks and I used the dimensions @bigben kindly gave  me

the TKP hanger is 3/4" hex stock, so appx 19.05mm across.  I don't think they machine it down in any way to get it to an exact size.  

The setscrew has been good for me so far.  locktite the bolt into the mount and tighten it down.  Then turn down the retaining nut so that the screw cannot back out.  Done.

I did have an issue on the strip ride where i thought the motor mounts were coming loose.  turned out it was the hanger bolts loosening up from the bushing seat.  SCARY AF!  Disassembled and re-tightened them and off we went - 5 minute repair job.

Yes.  No corner overcuts,  You just need to ensure that the endmill you're using won't produce fillets that interfere with the mating surfaces.

that inner hexagon is the hanger.  the irregular hexagon provides the clearances you need.  right now it's setup for a 1/4" endmill - anything larger will need to alter the irregular hexagon to provide the required clearance.

Think its fine. Made the mounting points closer together so I could make the overall footprint of the clamp smaller.

It's quite funny actually. Every Sunday my son (who is nearly 4) and I sit down together and I do a childrens toys search on aliexpress and filter under 50p and free delivery. I tell him he has £2 to spend and he can get whatever he wants.

Its both amazing because he picks the most random crap... honestly, secondly because he can buy like 7 items which are decent and they are delivered to the UK for £2 all in.

..... why do I pay £80 delivery and duties to get some TB mounts to my door?

Thanks for the footwork as always @mmaner

I'm going to get onboard the SR bandwagon I think, just jumped in on @lrdesigns mounts, of course I have nothing else. SR seems to ignore EU folk & I missed the BF 30% deal anyway, so it look like I will have to hit up sickboards  and build on the cheap from the ground up.

Here is my contribution from sickboards
https://www.sickboards.nl/en/spacers/560-spacers-10mm-for-10mm-axle.html#/291-quantity-set_of_4

from reading above I think 4 spacers for each corner is required

Just tested delivered bolt, the 10mm shoulder nicely goes into the hanger and makes a nice popping sound on the way out meaning the tolernance is nice and snug without being tight 

The pitch, whatever is correct

[/quote]

The amount of spacers depends on the length of the axle.  I think you will need x3 10mm spacers per axle, plus a spacer between the wheel bearings.  I may not understand what your using though.

Good luck on the SR build, you will likely be ruined for life now :slight_smile:

OK.  Confession time.  I bought the last pair of saffron colored adjustable RKP baseplates off sickboards the other day.  Pulled my TKP's of the front of my bludgeon and slapped the new ones on.  Set the angle for about 37.5 and took it for a ride.

I am uncertain.  The ride feel is completely different, almost alien as I havent ridden RKP is a long time now.  I'm gonna give it another go.  Might be back to TKP's...

I find that the inner ring has veil (don't know if thats the right word) and sits loose so I can wiggle the wheel a little. Especially after they have been ridden for a little time. 
Have you fund the same thing @mmaner?

I just want to put this tip here so this headache does not happen to anyone else. 

Put some anti seize or long life grease on the kingpin just where it goes inside the base plate.

I had my front truck king pin totally seized in the base plate after about two months of use. I was freaking out that my truck was toast. At first I thought the nut was cross threaded or the kingpin was rusted. But the kingpin is stainless steel.

I had to put a 2 foot breaker bar on the end of the allen key and it made a god awful screeching noise as I turned it. Took me like 20 mins to get it out.

After it was out I confirmed it was not cross threaded, cleaned king pin and it looked fine, I think it was just road grime that got in there. From wet weather riding. The fitment between the king pin and base plate has zero tolerance. Which is good for precision but increases risk of seizing.

As well as grease, I also give my kingpins a quick half turn back and forth once a week.

Huh? They don't come with? The SR kingpins are rather precise in terms of uniform diameter. Tried to install a set of precision machined washers a few days ago,  had to drill them out to fit!! Couldn't even press them on without doing so. 

In case anyone doesn't know how jealous they should be, here's a shot of my SR drivetrain, which doesn't exist in other iterations:

SR do a really bad job of getting back to you on international orders ie they don’t. Plan is to wait on getting axle bolts from AliExpress

The most important measurement which SR leave out for obvious reasons is the thickness of the smooth (shouldered) part of the bolt 3/8" maybes? 3/8 = ~9.5mm so not really.

My calipers say it is 9.28mm width, needs to be exact to avoid any slop of course. My bet is the smooth part of a SR kingpin is 9.2mm

All regular aftermarket kingpins have a shoulder of 10mm with a M8 threaded part just like the axle bolts linked off this thread.

So far unless someone really inventive can come up with something, then it seems SR kingpins are the only fitting part, I guess with a lathe you could cut regular kingpins down but I no have

What you do us hollow out a potato, but your kingpin inside with some lemon and a couple of drops of hydrochloric acid. Put a clover leaf cap over the hole, shake and leave for 3 days in the perpetual twilight of your home nation.

After that it won't fit but you'd have tried

Not yet, please beat me to finding it by all means! Not adverse to a little grinding of the bolt head or length cutting, expecting to use a washer

A 5/16” or 9.5mm bolt with probably a m8 nut, total length excluding the head looks to be about 70mm which corresponds to their 2 1/2” option

Hey guys - just did a stupid thing. When trying to fit the @lrdesigns adaptor, i endup striping the axel screw + hanger screw. Totally my fault, i should have used another way to corretly fit the adaptor.

Now - to fix this i will buy new shoulders. Thanks @brenternet for sending the aliexpress link.

The only missing issue is the hanger inner screw - It seems that the screw isn't done directly on the aluminium hanger....i think there's an inner screw cap (something like the below). **Anyone had to change this already?**....or i will be the first to try :disappointed_relieved:

Is there any specific precaution we should be taking to prevent the stripping from happening?  Or is this only related to not removing the grub screw on the hanger?

I just decided to completely eliminate the grub screw and fill it with hot glue to keep water / debris from getting inside the hanger.  Blue loctite is the only thing holding my axles in place.

It seems that this problem confirms my original suspicion that the helicoil threads are not meant for press-fitting anything to the hanger. They work for the psychotiller mounts, but may not be sufficient for the even more burly @lrdesigns mounts. Might need a ram for safe installation of anything else 🤔

It depends. If you use the surf rodz provided axles, using the grub screws should be okay as theres an indent in the shoulder bolt. Using grub screws with regular shoulder bolts will marr the bolt and potentially ruin the hangar though. Also, using loctite is always a good idea.

yeap @PatRocks - The adaptor after is pressed all the way sits pretty tight. It doesn't really need the pressure of the axle to stay there....so i don't see any issue after is completelly installed. The real issue, you also mentioned, is on installation guide. The axle CAN'T be used to press-fit it. It's not strong enough to hold it.

[quote="jasonbhuynh, post:193, topic:68341, full:true"]
It depends. If you use the surf rodz provided axles, using the grub screws should be okay as theres an indent in the shoulder bolt. Using grub screws with regular shoulder bolts will marr the bolt and potentially ruin the hangar though. Also, using loctite is always a good idea.

I know it has been recommended not to use the grub screw after several people got the axle stuck and ruined the hanger. 

It should be fine to use the grub screw with standard axles that have a cutout for the grub screw on the axle. Over tightening the axle may also cause the thread inside the hanger to be damaged.

But I have always had this paranoia about the front wheel falling off and me smashing my face on street. Even with lock tight. I felt 99.5% sure it was safe but the little bit of doubt bothered me when going fast. So now I have gone back to grub screws on the front wheels. The back wheels I am not so worried about, the belt will sort of hold the wheel on. Even if the wheel comes of there is a good change you can grind to halt without crashing. 

The other issue I am concerned about is rust on the axle causing it to become stuck. I have a very intense wet season here and end up commuting in the rain, my axles are already a bit rusted. I put some grease on the axle but that does not totally solve the issue and makes loctite not work so good. 

If anyone has seen stainless or titanium M10 shoulder bolts, please let me know. Thanks.

Let me put that fear to rest.

I don't use lockite, I actually use anti-seize and still the shoulder bolts have never loosened up.

Anti Seize might be a good idea for the rust situation. Thanks.

No not really. I managed to get ahold of her on the phone a few weeks ago. Sent them the truck with the stuck wheel. She confirmed it was really stuck and said that they’d try to get the wheel off, but will send me a replacement truck in the meantime. But I haven’t heard back from her since. Phone goes to a busy signal when you call

I randomly ran into this while doing some googling. Surf Rodz have patent on their "hybrid" RKP truck design. But I am not really sure what the unique innovation is? I think it's something to do with the bushing seat shape?

I figured out its their hybridsz trucks that have a bushing seat that is different top to bottom so you can flip the hanger for more or less turnies. 

_"With a combination of Surf-Rodz patent-pending duel seat design, we offer two seats in one hanger, allowing the skater to dial in a range of bushing set ups geared toward his or her skill level."_

Id say getting your money's worth.   why replace until its broken,  and now time for him to upgrade.  lol

I'm not technical as IT guy, so just ordered using the links. Paying 35 euro additionally for 25dollar worth of spacers is maybe a bit too much for most :smile: , so if we could have EU sources it would benefit us.
35euro tax for spacers, 35 most likely for the bearings, 50 for the axles, ... all of that just because I cant get hold of SR directly eh :smiley:

You can get them from the UK sellers too or dutch shops but they are far more expensive then I was willing to pay. 
For dutch look for passchroef of pasbout m10x90mm of op z’n belgs pasvijs. 


Spacers I have from surfrodz from my PT order that came with the trucks.

I also ordered these washers.

Surf Rods suck. The shoulder bolt is horrible. What’s the point of having a grub screw if it destroys your axle and makes it impossible to remove? I’m waiting for a wheel to fly off as I’m too scared to tighten the axle properly

I don’t think they turn all that well either if you are from a skateboard background.😭

I've been running multiple sets for over a year. 
I've never had one come lose and ive never damaged one due to the grubs 

A) don't use grub screws 
Or 
B) remove grub before removing axle

If you use the shoulder bolt with the divot in it, then the grub screw doesn't destroy the axle and make it hard to remove.

Also, loctite works for keeping the shoulder bolt on if you don't have the divot. Yes, even blue loctite. Just make sure it cures.
