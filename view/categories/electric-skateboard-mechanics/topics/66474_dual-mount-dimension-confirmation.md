I have been creating a 3D file in Fusion 360 of a dual mount for SK3s with supports.

I have never done any 3D modeling in the past so it is probably a bit rough compared to some of the other designs out there. I am basicaly here to get advice on the design so that hopefully I can get it made for my new deck coming in.

There is no hardware between the base plate and hanger because I have a Randall 35 degree base plate so I set the hanger to 35 degrees to reflect that.
