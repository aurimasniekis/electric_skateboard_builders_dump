In the process of replacing the 6805 bearing in my Carvons and it's not coming out. I've tried brute force, heat, and leverage and nothing so I guess I need the right tool for the job. Something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071R2NX7L/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2UFNNBBXBWQFC&psc=1)? Looks good to me except the end of the screw looks too small to fit in the lip of the bearing. How do you get your stuck bearings out?

I bet it’s only held w glue n if u remove the seals n bake it on a gas burner for awhile it will destroy the glue. I don’t think the heat would damage the aluminum.   Maybe it would. Or maybe u could 
Do a heat treatment again if u wanted.

If you have a dremel, use the cutting disc to make a slice in one side, works like a charm, just be careful and use protection as the parts tend to fly out

I was just going to recommend this. Sometimes the bearings are cooled hundreds of degrees below zero and then press fit. Its the cheap way to make them completely permanant

blowtorch to kill possible bearing glue (bearing glue goes bad at around >350-475°C , the aluminim is fine till arround 600°C) and than I have a can with "cold spray" or "spray coolant" for the bearing (make sure to cool the aluminium as less as you can). The aluminium is still hot, the bearing shrinks and usually falls out (leavering the bearing/part on some metal beforehand)
