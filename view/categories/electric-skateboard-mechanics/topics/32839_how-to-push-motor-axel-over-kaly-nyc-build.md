Yep, by the looks of it, it should just come apart as soon as you unscrew it

looks like you're missing a circlip and perhaps grub screws for the motor shaft

FIXED IT GUYS!! 

Was the little grub screw, got it all sorted just pulled the pulley closer to the motor all all good!!

Got the AT Wheels on there now super sick! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/c/eca7933cda1f113520f7b908bcdcb90201b01cd0.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Uhhh, you might have fixed it, but your can is not suppose to move like that.. You'll have issues down the line unless you actually address the problem.
