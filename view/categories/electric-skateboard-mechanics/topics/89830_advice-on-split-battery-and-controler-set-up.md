I bought a very flexy deck - i think only 8 ply...   I wanted to do a split set up  for the battery and controller,  but I am leary to dremmel out a channel in the board because I dont want to compromise the integrity of the wood and have the board split at 20 mph...   What are my options...   Are there some threads you can guide me too???
