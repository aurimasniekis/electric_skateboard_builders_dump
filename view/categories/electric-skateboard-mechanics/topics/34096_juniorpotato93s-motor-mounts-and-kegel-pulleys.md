Hi guys, does anyone have any spares of @JuniorPotato93's motor mounts and Kegel pulleys? I tried messaging him, but no answer so far. They look like this: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/9/c93295c366dbe6bdfd97af73868a32a55152c143.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I have a mount here in the UK.
I know @JLabs was involved in a group buy that sold them too?

Its his 3D model that was used for CNCing them out of aluminium. They are held together by a cap on the other side of the wheel by using screws.
