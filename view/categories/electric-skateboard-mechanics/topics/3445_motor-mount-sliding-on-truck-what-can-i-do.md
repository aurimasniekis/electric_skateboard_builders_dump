Hi all,

I am using Caliber 2 trucks on my board and have a problem:
my motor mount (that I made myself out of a 1cm Aluminium plate) keeps "moving" closer to the wheel after every ride. I guess it is due to vibration and have already tried to put some shrink wrap over the truck to allow for a better grip of the mount but had no luck.
Should I just add more layers of shrink wrap or do you have another idea? Grub screw maybe?
My caliber trucks are also slightly conical towards the wheel (as in: they get thinner) which does not exactly help :slight_smile:

Your safest option would be a grub screw. It would be my favorite choice. But be careful with a grub screw because it could fall easily off. It did happen to me on a grub screw on my motor due vibrations. I just put some glue in it and it did not fall apart on its own yet. Another option would be nail polish. Sounds weird but it is like glue. Just not that strong... but it is enough.

Maybe categorize the thread?

Just weld it up, or you could put some epoxy there to stop it moving. 

The grub screw will not stop it from sliding much. Unless you put a small hole in your truck and put the screw into that.

Well let's try a grub screw then. Any recommendations for size? M4,5,6?

i would go with an M4 or M5

Or maybe two? But one should be enough

Use threadlocker to keep the screws from vibrating loose. (They will do it)

Use the blue (medium strength) if you plan on wanting to remove or adjust them at a later date.
Red (high strength) is pretty much permanent, so be sure you place it right before using that.

Can you post a picture of you mount?  
Also make sure your trucks are straight,  maybe some filing or careful use of a grinder  / dremel helps.

If the hole is deep enough, I put two grubsvrews on top of eachother.

Try putting a C-clamp on it to squeeze it down and then tighten the bolts as tight as possible. Be careful not to bend the bracket.

Use adhesive shrink wrap and heat it on the truck so it won't slide

Cool mount,  you get maximum amount of points for DIY spirit.  
There could be two potential issues: the mount is not strong enough,  bends and gets pulled towards the wheel 
or your clamping area is not precise enough to have enough clamping force.  Maybe a mix.  Difficult to tell from here.  
The grub screw will help if your mount is strong enough.

I can almost guarantee that the clamping area is not precise enough :slight_smile:
Doing it by hand with just a file I was not able to align the edges perfectly - so I really hope the grub screw works.

Yeah it looks like you need more of a gap so you can crank down on the bolts....

But think...you did it by hand...and you almost have it...just needs to be refined .... The solution is near

Metal shim is all I can add unless you can refine the shape more perfect to the truck

Yes, I would file down one side of clamping area like Michael said to create a larger gap to squeeze axle to begin with !,.. then align everything perfectly TIGHT, ....then let some Epoxy Seep into around clamping area on both side , protect rest of axle from epoxy with some tape, let cure overnight.

Read about this technique on another forum, said it worked everytime ?

@maxid, great job doing this just with a file! 

Before going down the poisonous epoxy path I would suggest that your try to get a more precise fit of your mount. 

some tips: 
1) make sure the angles are absolutely true 90 degrees 
2) for a better fit, color the clamping area with a black permanent pen, 
then clamp on the mount using minimal force
wiggle the mount a little bit
Then remove the mount. 
now you need to file down the area where the black has come off
repeat until you're happy

And like others have said, the gap needs to be big enough to apply a great deal of clamping force. 

good luck and tell us how it went

Well I obviously also had a drill and thread cutter ;)

I just bought a M4 grub screw with 1cm length that I will try to use.
Honestly I do not want to spend any more time filing this thing - it seems like everytime I try again I get one place right but make another one worse.
But I will increase the gap for better clamping.

Thanks everyone for the help - will let you know how it turns out.

if you take it off anyway, give it a try using the black pen. This should show you where you need to take away some more stuff. 

Btw, I considered doing it the same way - and then decided to buy a mount ... :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy:

Small heads up:
I filed away some of the material to get a better clamping force and it seems to work better now. There might even be no need for the grub screw. I marked the position with a pen and will check periodically - if it moves again I will add the screw otherwise leave it like it is now.

On a side note: i had my first crash yesterday. A car overtook at maybe 20-25mph and immediately afterwards tried to park. I could not break fast enough, jumped off the board, slid on gravel and hit the car door. Knees, hands, ellbows and hip have bruises but nothing serious. Badwolf enclosure still works even with just the on-switch gotten loose.

I am from Germany btw - if anyone has an idea of how to behave in a situation like this please let me know. So far the police was not involved.

Hi! I have zero experience, but what about making second motor mount (just partial if you don't plan to upgrade on two motor setup) and mounting it on the other side of the truck. Then, connecting them together with a plate. Second mount can't move towards the center of the truck (since the truck is conical), so it'll keep entire construction from moving. At the same time, the plate can serve to protect your motor from below.

Sorry man thank GOD its nothing serious. In this sport it will be the first of many sadly. 
I deal with this exact situation everyday with cabs in NYC. They try to cut me off but they don't realize I'm going 35mph. Once they barely make it they have to short stop asap to pick up passengers. One guy even decided to "cut me off" (if you can even call it that) BEFORE he passed me, therefore physically pushing me into the sidewalk with his speeding taxi. Short story I nearly killed that driver and the passenger got another cab.  

I don't advocate violence in any situation ever except this. I consider this, highly illegal maneuver just to pick up passengers, to be attempted murder with a deadly weapon. I will do what ever is necessary for self defense or punishment (especially when cops don't care since it happens all the time). 

Admittedly I have gone crazy a few times and broken the cabs window with my metal flashlight. Also once pulled the driver out of his car and threw his keys across the avenue of speeding cars. 
I think the best solution is to teach the drivers one by one with violent or monetary repercussions so to traumatize them. I assure you those drivers will never do that again. 

Probably the easiest thing if you don't crash, that doesn't require much time,strength or stopping even, is to knock off their mirror as you pass by. Then get out of there quick lol. This one works really nicely lately :wink:
