Hey Everyone, 

I am taking a look at this 3D model on thingiverse and I am trying to figure out how the bearing is supposed to stay in this model? or really how this thing is supposed to stay on the wheel. 

Is it a bad design? Will it work??

The bearings goes in where you see a little round indent on the gear teeth side. Requires a flanged bearing. I believe it is a [F608-ZZ Bearing](https://www.amazon.com/4-PIECES-F608-ZZ-8x22x7mm-Shielded-Jeremywell/dp/B01DWVIBJU/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_328_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=ZDHHSW51NFTGHTR4X3KT)

It should stay on the wheel but you need to print it with a nylon filament to get anywhere near reliable enough to use. 

@longhairedboy Had some designed that you can order

That is correct. You can get 11 of them for $10 usually. They last a good long while but they're inexpensive, so replacement isn't an issue when its time.

Did the 3D printed kegel wheel pulley require the retainer or bolts to hold in place or does it just snap in like the standard Raptor v1 wheel pulley does?
