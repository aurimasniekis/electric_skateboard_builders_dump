Hey guys :smiley:

Curious, I'm looking around, but I'm curious, where do you guys get your motor pulleys from?  

When i look at the specs for the 6354 260Kv turnigy, it seems to require a 8mm shaft. Is there a goto website for pulleys :smiley:

Thank yaaaaa

These are good for specific pulleys, UK based but will ship all over.
