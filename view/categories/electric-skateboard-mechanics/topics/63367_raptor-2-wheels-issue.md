Hello guys, I wonder if anyone has gotten the warranty replacements outter wheels for the Raptor 2 hubs yet?

I see people getting replacement parts but not sure if they are under warranty or you have to buy yourself?

These are my outter rear wheels currently, I'm starting to worry to ride my Raptor 2.

This is under warranty. Send support this picture and you should be good to go.

Might take a few months though before they have the new formula in stock. You could ask them to send a pair of the old formula in the meantime. Free of charge ofcourse.

Good luck

We've had a ton of outwheel, motor, hardware, charge port, BMS, and battery issues. Those are definitely covered. They'll send you a new pair. ;)

Check this one month old R2 out.

I have all 3 wheel sizes I already destroyed 2 sets of 90s and my 97s and crossovers are on the way they are all cracked but they are all covered I'm just waiting for the new formula to get them replaced.

Where did you get the replacement wheels from? An Enertion USA agent or directly from Australia?

@SeanHacker I had that same issue with my Raptor 2. I pinpointed the issue and determined it happens when the remote gets disconnected from the receiver because of low remote battery, if the reconnection happened during a braking or acceleration the ppm setting would recalibrate thinking the current position was center pulse length.

So the only advise would be to charge your remote pretty often to minimize the chances to have low remote battery during commute.

Thanks. I thought that too at first. Its not my board. Its a friends. He sent me a video of him just touching the receiver and connection issues happening even with the remote fully charged. I think the ppm wire is faulty. He's got a newer R2 with the most common QC issues being reported so far. Recently the hardware on his rear trucks broke going 20mph+. Its been one thing after the other for him. I feel bad. Waiting for these things to start happening to my few week old replacement R2. :frowning:

It took months. I've had the board coming up on a year. It's only worked for a couple months out of that year.

Thanks Bara! In the meanwhile, don't you have any old formula just to keep riding my Raptor?

I've just been contacted by Enertion Support they confirmed they just got the wheels in with new formula, this is awesome, they are shipping right away.

Now I have this other issue, has anyone experienced this?, anything I could tight to avoid it?

I had an R2 hub issue too at around 30mph last night. Wheel totally locked up. Almost took me out of the game.

Have you opened the motor up to see if the bearing moved out of place by chance?

Pretty much. I just want them to prove me wrong and send me parts that work for a while so I can actually enjoy this board. It's getting old. Not to mention its coming up on 2 years since I purchased the board and out of the two R2's I've owned, I've only clicked a couple hundred miles between the two of them. 

My DIY has been running everyday for 2 years. It's my transportation and have clocked 5-6k one it. Still running strong.

CarvOn was somewhat like that too until I sent them in for repair. I love how hub motor's selling point is no maintenance, less failures and it seem like we are constantly dealing with issues that are much harder to fix than our belt boards

Hey Alan, 

We just recently sent out an update via email that they are back in stock. Your order has likely already been fufilled, I will however follow up on it to make sure.

Do the wheels have now a better urethane formula or do they still crack?

The new urethane formula is much better then previous.  They're not perfect but progress takes time! 

New urethane does not crack

I got 8 of the front 97mm wheels and 4 of the cores were so off centre in the urethane that they wobbled so much that they were unrideable. There was up to 5mm deviation as they rotated! I am still waiting to hear back from enertion @CarlCollins @EnertionSupport ???? The urethane on 4 wheels that I was able to mount seems to be good so far but I have to put a few more kms on them to find out for sure. I hope the 90's and 100's that I haven't received yet don't have the same problem.
