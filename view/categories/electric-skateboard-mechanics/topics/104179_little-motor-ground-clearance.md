Hello all.
I am building my first esk8 and i have a problem. Because i have a hobbyking motor mount i cannot adjust the angle and the ground clearance. Right now it is aproximatly 3.5 cm between motor and ground and 3 cm between motor and board. Is that ok? If not, do you have any suggestions on how could i fix this without buying or making a new mount. Maybe i could somehow modify the curent mount??.
Thank you.

Using the hobbyking trucks I assume? I'd say you're good to go. I've seen those used a fair amount. Yeah motors get scraped up every now and then, but that just happens.
