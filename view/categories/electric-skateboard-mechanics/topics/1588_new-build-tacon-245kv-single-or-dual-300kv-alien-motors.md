So my friend lives in a decntly hilly/flat are and is needing some help on choosing a motor. I thought that with the dual 300kv at a 15/32 gearing ratio, 6s 5000mah lipo, and 83mm wheels would be enough without pushing the motors too much. But would it be better to run Everything the exact same except a tacon 245kv motor with a 20/32 gearing? Honestly he's trying to run the board for at least 6 months to a year without having to change out the motor that his only concern.

So you want to build a more reliable drive train?

Honestly the kv doesn't really matter. Your goal should be to make the motors job as easy as possible. Reduce the chance of it over heating. Whilst making a system that reaches your desired top speed.

So;
1. Increase reduction as much as possible.
2. Increase voltage if possible.
