Hi, 

I'm opening this thread to document the development process of our new deck. 


Whats different compared tho the longer HAYA V0 deck: 

- Pockets are shorter and wider, measuring 490*+91,5mm (Allowing up to 5p glued 18650 modules sideways). 
- Small pocket behind the main battery components to fit a BLE-Module, receiver or ever a micro BMS. (Will post pics explaining it) 
- Flat tail, still constrained by the universal mould we are using. 
- 825* mm long (32,5"). Light and portable. Max WB 23,5”
- Directional V shape. 244mm on its widest side, as wide as we can go with our veneers. 

*dimensions may vary a little bit. 



It also will have a centre beam to distribute the pressure put over the lid and feature 4 motor hole channels. 
Price-wise it should cost around the same as the other deck, maybe some bucks less because of the bit shorter veneers, otherwise its as labour intensive as the other. 

**It's still in a very early development phase.** We just cut and shaped the deck today
Any progress or production related news will be posted here. 


PICS:
Quick n dirty to see and feel the deck proportions.  
(will update them as soon as we mill the pockets, and then as soon as we have CNC'd ones)
(The V0 deck has also the new V0.1 nose, that's why some inserts are visible, that should not be like that)

I think @LukePL ‘s deck already has some very similar shape, we might change the nose shape, but the general aesthetic might stay similar to the original. We also are constrained by the manufacturing style and CNC machine (they wont let us do crazy angles or transitions)

You mean a pintail shape? 38+“ would be the max length with the longer veneers

edit: 
There are decks like the earthwing miniglider with a similar shape at 33". Im not sure if the flat kick would work out on a longer eskate, specially considering the weight. The raptor can pivot, but it has a very pronounced kick.

No same shape as the first deck you guys made. Just longer.  I know that's what @Wraith and a few others had mentioned way back when you first posted your deck.
I do like the kicktail tho.  Glad to see you guys back at it so soon.

I bought some cheap generic longboard form a local kid just for the trucks and wheels (All my gear is in Munich, not spain). 

Initial impressions are good: 
- the short wheelbase feels comfortable and stable (tested downhill, not electrified) 
- I  tend to angle my feet while riding, that allows me to use the full length of the wheelbase. 
- Transitioning the front foot also felt good as it is still quite wide at the very front (unlike a vanguard-like nose shape for example). 
- Maybe the pronounced (and dicussed) nose shape is ok, let me explain:
most builders will tend to use narrower trucks on a short board, and as it can be appreciated in the pictures (full lean on the shitty trucks), the shape will help a lot with wheelbite when using e-skate 90+mm size wheels. 
- using the tail is a bit different, On a normal tail you kick and turn "at the same time", and with this one  there is a little lag inbetween. You first push and then turn. It turns well on the spot. And is fun to play with manuals ;D

They are pressed and CNCd by a local company in northern spain (pamplona). The deck is finshed with a laser cut Aluminium lid.

The deck will still be made with 1mm beech plys and the lid out of 1,2mm alu. Sourcing other materials would be much more expensive for us I think. 

The company that presses the decks works only with beech wood. They literally process them from raw logs to plys and then decks or other stuff in the same facility.
Laser cutting prices are also hard to beat, super affordable.

Not sure if anyone has mentioned this or maybe even done this on your deck or another one but why not have someone (maybe @mmaner) do some designs to be 3d printed to add the kicktail angle and/or concave you'd like....? You put it under the grip so it stays in place and it won't ever move and will feel normal. I do it with foam or cardboard for foot placements on a lot of my builds but I just can't ride a board (especially a powerful esk8) that's flat on top personally. Would have bought your first desk if I could. 

Something like this idea but wedges or different smaller angels to resemble drops, concave, tail shape, etc.... (am I late to the party thinking of this already)

early CAD proto.:
![HAYA_short_cad|690x338](upload://92O0aQ52xRFXCXC0rPNiixo4nOi.png) 


We also visted the company that makes them for us and had a long chat with them (Its always fun to explain how everything works, what this forum is etc :) ) 
They said that they dont see any issue making the shorter design. Its gonna take some time though, they have a quite big workload right now. Production "could" happen at the end of feb./early march (they are super quick usually). 

Next step is getting CNCd prototypes and then brutally testing them.

I dont think so, we would have to rework the design to 2 sepparate enclosures to a Vanguard like deck. We have some mockups, but it would be a board design for the furue (when im Finished with Uni work around the end of the year...). 
Adding glass fiber to mantain some rocker adds a bit of complexity too.

Just similar, and not for sale.

Hi, I finally spent some time home to work on the HB83 shortboard prototype together with my father.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

_**General Info:**_ 
-------------
I tested wheelbite with 45deg baseplates / no riser / 76mm Hawgs zombies (what I had in hand) 170mm sabre trucks -> 180mm-isch with the extreme offset of the wheels, and I encountered no wheelbite. 50deg BP help, wider helps, risers help. Next week when I'm home I will put 90mm-popocas on them, prob with a 1/8-1/4" riser. 

We will deliver them with 2-3 coats of 2-Component polyurethane matte varnish. It that state it can be used perfectly fine, just remember to dry the board when it rains. Otherwise its perfectly prepared for other  types of varnishes, epoxy, CF-Skinning, or painting if you want extra protection or a different look. Its a DIY forum so we want to offer an open platform. 

**We will ship them IKEA-like: non assembled but with video/text instructions and all the parts needed**, even 2-component epoxy for the installation of the threaded inserts. The inserts are super easy to install, and the foam too (similar to applying griptape). It just takes too much time if my father has to do 70 of them all at once. At the end its cheaper for the end user, and easier for us. 

We also will not drill over the 2 wood plies we glue on top of the deck tail and nose (like on the first image), this way the user just needs to drill the 2 holes he needs keeping everything clean. 

Included are: Deck, Laser-cut lid, foam, inserts, M4 Black SS Torx lid-bolts, Epoxy. 

We are **aiming at a final price of 150 Euros** (Still have to figure out how to manage EU-Prices with TAX, non EU are not taxed). 

1st run will be limited for testing purposes and because our manufacturer has a too tight schedule right now. 20-isch Beta-Decks is the target (If there is enough interest). **If everything goes to plan we should start with production around the last week of March,** with **deliveries starting around early April.** 

If you got any other questions I will be happy to answer them. 

Best, Mathias 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_**PICS:**_

Here are some pictures of how the finished deck will look like, there are some minimal changes in the internal geometry (I will post the exact dimensions later). 

The one with the Painted Tail is my personal test-deck.

with a 1.5mm aluminum lid on top it should be strong enough. The final prototype will have one ply more (24). 

I yet have to test the stiffness under real eskating conditions, but I highly doubt that I will encounter any structural problems.

I plan on glass fritting this board with a design underneath. Not entirely sure on how to do the design on the aluminum plate. Unless I pay somebody to laser it on. Any ideas?

Do I really want anime tiddies permanently lasered to a $1300+ piece of equipment is the question.

Also, probably a dumb question - but does the aluminum lid have a concave in it? If not I could mill my own in the future, but I presume it does.

I fail to see how this is a problem.

Completely unrelated question, can you etch into unanodized aluminum with a laser cutter? I have access to laser cutters, but the materials sheet only mentions etching anodized aluminum.

The problem is that I want might to change to a different pair of tiddies down the line

I really do need to figure something out while keeping price down though. A wrap might be a good idea but I'd have to carefully cut out the screw holes. Can aluminum easily be spray painted and hold it? All of my painting knowledge is with polymers.

Looks like Rust-Oleum may have a good primer

The concave is added after laser cutting, I could just send it to you without bending. 

Bending it afterwards can be done quite easily, not as precise as with a dedicated bending machine, but good enough.

I also could send you as many lids as you want, the added cost per lid would not be that much.

Extra lids may be a good idea, especially with how cheap the raw aluminum sheeting is. I plan on getting in on the first run of these, and I think you mentioned you plan on going more than one run if the demand is there - so for the time being I should be fine, and if it turns out I need more later it looks like I shouldn't have a problem.

I'll probably experiment with paint first. Another dumb question - you're adding layers of urethane to the board - does that include the lid as well?

I feel like it's probably not necessary as most people will want to do something that involves application to the bare aluminum, but for the few who might offering it probably wouldn't hurt. I'm excited for this board though.

 Are you expecting any issues that couldn't be solved with risers on wide trucks (surfrodz RKP200 or TKP 176's) and 110mm wheels regarding wheel bite? From the looks of it I think it should be fine, but since I don't have hands on experience assuming might be bad

You can put CF or aluminized FG on the lid and add glass frit to that.

You could also do the top in a fabric design and add frit.  On the bottom, the sky is the limit.

(C&P of the HB92 thread as the timeline will be very simmilar): 

So, all the decks are already pressed. CNCing (maybe) starts next week, pob. at least one sample to check the milling tolerances an adapt those to the alu lid. 

That being said, I dont want to be over confident, prob shippign will not start before the end-ish of April. There are a lot of small production steps to undergo before we have a finished product. I hope you understand that. 

If you got any other questions feel free to ask.

(C&P of the HB92 thread as they are being produced/finished simultaneously)

**Production update:** 
(we are running a bit behind schedule because of the shitty weather this week + making 60 instead of 30 also takes more time) 
- All decks received 2 varnish coats and a consecutive sanding of the interior
- We corrected the lid hole position to match the contour of the CNC'd holes and now we are waiting for them to be produced. Expected in 1-2 weeks according to our personal experience with them. Till then all the rest of the production steps should be finished.
- We epoxied the threaded inserts of almost all the decks (until we run out of inserts) 
- Sanding of the backside has started today, after that the decks will receive 3-4 varnish coats, the last one being a harder anti scratch bi-component acrylic polyurethane one. 
- I visited the metal polishing/finishing shop of the father on one of my friends and we were decided to machine-sand all the lids to obtain a more professional looking finish
- After the lids are sanded we plan on applying a matte/satin protective automotive clear coat 
- We ordered stainless steel bolts (same type as the black ones) for those who want a all-metal raw finish of the lid. 

**Changes:** 

- In order to ease production, making the machine sanding of the lid possible and reducing the final price the **alu lid will cover the entire top surface**. We believe this will also help to water-proof even better since the lid covers the entirety of the top surface. **(will post pics soon)** 
- The trucks will be mounted beneath the lid. Accessing the internal components will remain easy. 
- We planed to sell the deck like a DIY kit but we decided against it. Some of the production steps such as epoxying the inserts and applying the gasket to the lid (no chance of error) can be a bit too tricky for the final builder. This means that we will rise the price of the deck form 150€ to 160€ (190€ for European customers because of 19% german TAX). We hope this is understandable considering the extra work.  
- All decks will have a silk screen printed logo (same as the last time) in dark-Gray (probably with a metallic accent mixed into the paint). If you don't want a logo please inform me as soon as possible. 

If you got any extra questions I will be happy to offer further assistance

Best, Mathias

I know I said it in the Google form, but just to be safe I'll do it here too - I definitely want two lids. I presume at 1.5mm sheeting they won't be super expensive on the manufacturing end - maybe it would be safe to make 10-15 more lids than total boards?

The tail has 6 bolts to mount the lid, since we could only design a deck with a flat kicktail it would be nice to add a 3d printed one to have some angled kick to pop the board easier. Just bolting in on top of the lid itself, no glue or extra inserts required.

I still think something like this would be awesome just adapted to what's needed on the Haya for the tail / concave or whatever really. This company I believe is since out of business now cause I can't find their product anywhere online, but to add some inserts like they have under the grip and/or to the existing bolt pattern of the lid would be siiiiick!

Okay this is obviously related to the HB92, but you brought up the idea here so... 

Here's what i'm thinking will be nice to add a bit more depth ontop of the concave/edge detection for feeling out foot placement:

No for sure, thanks for tagging/replying to me cause I am interested and plan on getting a HAYA deck for my next build a few months down the road. Super sick though, I'm liking where you're heads at so far. Be able to lock your feet in in the front and back, I would definitely want something like this (or exactly this) on this board no doubt. Does the deck have some concave at all the long way or is it completely flat? I can't remember and am too lazy to look rn....

**Quick mockup (not final version)**, feel free to suggest any geometry changes. 

I will print one today. The issue is that my proto-deck does not have the 3 rear lid-holes so it would be nice if any of you HB83 owners would test if the holes line up :wink:

Just as a heads up to all with the Shortboard.

I've modified @Winfly's compression cell files for 1S3P 21700 (great for single drive, small vescs and external BMS, or some channel modification) and 6S2P (Great for Unity and full size charge/discharge BMS + BKB receiver)

Hi all - I have found a way to fit 12s4p 21700 with a UNITY and BMS in the Shortboard. The key thing is that it's flight ready, being a 12s4p compression style packs that can easily be taken apart and then reassembled. Unfortunately, I don't think there will be an easy way to make p groups modular due to how unbelievably tight it's going to get. The UNITY also heatsinks into the lid beautifully.

It is going to take a few weeks to get the BMS it looks like, so unless you're looking to do exactly this (if so, pm me) you'll have to wait a bit for the beautiful build pics.  This is going to be CRAZY

sorry to see this, what modifications did you do?

did the modifications make the deck more prone to flex? maybe that caused the crack, the way de deck is glued (cross pattern lamination) does not like to flex and if a certain level is exceeded it can create a crack that leads to delamination.

Just that area, I weigh 115lb. At first I thought there might be some inner tension with the deck pressing some components down against the bottom, but it's clear. All forces are being applied to the inner brace and outer perimeter

Crack started in the dead center too, which I find odd

I just love the deck. Perfect size for my stance. Beautiful woodwork. Fits plenty of cells. I’m very happy with my purchase. 

A little paranoid about the reported cracks from other users. I haven’t drilled through at all. In fact the charge port is going to be in the riser. When I screwed the outer screws of the metal lid on the middle seemed to float above the center beams. I ended up just getting support to fill that 3/8 in gap and longer screws so the pressure is even on all the outer and inner support beams. Any small imperfections of surface cracks were filled with wood filler just to be safe. 

Great job man. And thank you, I really like the wheelbase, integrated enclosure and opening at the top of the deck to access battery’s.

There’s only one which cracked which was shown to be due to removing part of the structural backbone of the deck?

which in turn allowed it to flex more than it should, which in turn caused separation 

Don’t see how that can be called anything more than user error & in fact Mathias was extremely generous to offer a replacement.

Commercially HAYA have been shooting themselves in the head by their 100% stance of standing over their products, much ✊🏻

I don't recall ever saying that my deck cracking was in any way Mathias's fault. If I did, please point me to it, as I definitely never meant to. 

In my original design, the Unity acted as a solid bridging piece. Shit happened because of various parts being delayed week after week, and a few cuts were made that had the Unity no longer giving any structural support. 

I also greatly overestimated how much flex would be needed to propagate a crack. 

My deck is now nicely skinned in CF though. Hopefully will be done doing finishing touches within a few days.

Also, @jimmymagix, maybe it's because I've only said it over PM's - but I'll say it here now - I have great respect for Mathias and his designs. I think they're fucking awesome, and I think it sucks ass that he had to take a massive personal finance hit because of the issues that were completely out of his control with the hb92 v2 decks, because I want to see these things being semi-mass produced. Hard to tell if that's even feasible for him without taking another financial risk at this point, and I think that really sucks.

If you want to pick on somebody, don't do it to somebody who took a risk in trying to do something that was never meant to be done. Pick on the people who blow up multiple vescs or some shit, or those who improperly build battery packs and have fires despite the endless amount of information we have available to us in how to do exactly not that.

Like this, but of course down in the wood. The space between is for the unity. I'm not set on the position, so if you have a better idea I'm all ears. Also if you have an idea how to make the hole I'd want to know too, as I don't see it to be attached that easily.

If you're saying that's where you want your ports, just makes your holes, buy some Butyl tape, wrap it around the threads, shove it in and cut off the excess that squishes out. Works better than you ever might think it would. 

As for the holes - make sure you drill in towards the channel once you get to your bigger bits or you risk cracking surrounding wood when the large bit comes thru.

I always preferred wiring the charging/power-button through the motor wire holes, my charging port is wired on the rear part and the power button up front. You can use the space left on the recessed truck mount or wire them into the baseplate (I secured mine with a simple zipp tie and then sealed the chamber with silicone). There is this 3d printable riser from stefan as an alternative option too: 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3289585

Or like winfly did: 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3414307


I you want to drill a hole on the sides I would not go so far back with the charging port as you intended, maybe move it 2-3cm forward. Maybe also consider drilling one hole on each side instead of 2 in one side. 

I personally think that structurally the best option would be not to drill any hole.

@bevilacqua bad news. I believe I have the first report  of a non-modified Haya shortboard delaminating:

![photo_2019-08-28_12-27-27|375x500](upload://raHqEGwBIwSZayr2ecogevhfjDI.jpeg) 

My friend has been using it for around a week, not electrified yet because I'm waiting for battery cells to arrive. He's an inexperienced rider, so there's no way he's been torturing the board. Said he noticed the crack at work this morning, only unusual thing done was going over tram tracks and a bit of cobblestone, which shouldn't be too bad given he's using 97mm wheels. He only weighs 56kg even!!!

Is this something that can be fixed? If so, how should I approach it? He said he'll take a look at the inside later this evening when he gets home.

Carbon fiber got done curing yesterday. All that's left is drilling truck holes and some final sanding. Will try to get that done ASAP and abuse the fuck out of the board to see how it holds up. 

Actually forgot to re-glue the crack until last second as we had epoxy stuff going on... so we made the crack very slightly larger and overstuffed the fuck out of it with superglue and clamped it incredibly hard + kickered it. Seemed to bond great.

CFing it is pretty easy. Only hard parts are really the front curves, but those can be done using a lot of tape to pull things taught as it starts to get tacky.

Yeah, the truck recess is also a tricky part, I cut the fabric afterwards with a exactoknife or cutter (after the expoxy has cured but not reached its full hardness)

We actually didn't have an issue with the truck recesses.. Just clamped down two baseplates in the area. There is a very, very slight crookedness in one end, but that's just because we didn't clamp it perfectly. Affects nothing and it'll never be seen. Might've been drunk and also might've sliced nearly half of my thumb off as we were doing that part. Aside from the curved portions of the perimeter, the only actual issue was a few finger prints making epoxy not settle right in a few places :( 

Nowhere that the structural integrity will be affected, but always de-grease I guess.

Hot glue is disgusting and doesn't work the same at all. The butyl tape does not harden and comes off of the wood with nothing left behind.

Do you have access to Amazon?

No, amazon basically doesn't work in The Netherlands. Is there a good alternative?

I did drill the holes, and I think it looks pretty slick

That looks amazing

Really hoping mine holds up. No drilled holes. I did notice a tiny split about as long and wide as my fingernail along the side before I ever even stood on the deck. I just filled it with plastic wood to be safe. Whatever the case be, I’m really impressed on how @bevilacqua is handling this. He’s obviously not a “big” business like Enertion, but he sure as hell runs his better.

Does a search for "Butyl tape Netherlands" turn up nothing? 

I'd try going to a local hardware store and asking for something tacky that doesn't cure. If not... Neutral cure silicone your heart out or something. I just REALLY fucking like Butyl tape now. Has a ton of sweet uses.

I'll drive by some stores, but I'm not hopeful. I did find [kit from butyl](https://www.gamma.nl/assortiment/bison-butyleenkit-wit-300-ml/p/B483181), I think this should be good?

Might be fine. Tape is just nice because it's easy to lay out/wrap around things.

@bevilacqua 

Making a thin epoxy and slathering it along the inner side walls of the channels probably couldn't hurt, right? I'm trying to think of what would best wick into the wood - I think the general consensus is that normal wood glues are a bit too thick to do that very much.

No problem at all, I did it on the hb92 I skinned, seals the wood and probably adds some strength to the insides too.

This sounds great! Hopefully I won't need it (it still looks great atm), but this is a great peace of mind if it does. Compliments to how you've handled it so far, people can learn from you!

We tested 2 sample decks that were made last week, these were glued properly.

**Resuls:**  **Very solid, no sounds or cracking even with hard jumps** over it (85kg rider). It assures our assumption that some of the decks were affected by the glue. 

To further ensure the structural stability on the V2.1 replacement decks the thickness of the sides will be increased by some mm, thus reducing the channel dimensions by just a tiny bit ( Will be still able to hold 4 21700 cells in parallel )
