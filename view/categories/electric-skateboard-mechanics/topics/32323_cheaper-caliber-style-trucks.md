Don't have a lot of money, need to get larger wheels, larger wheels probably won't fit horizontally on trucks, need new (wider) trucks. Current trucks are about 18.5cm wide (~7.2in). Motor mount is for Caliber-style trucks. Recommendations?

not so cheap, but it's a wider truck compatible with caliber motor mounts

Thanks, but nevermind. After some more searching and struggling through Amazon, I discovered some items will actually ship to Aus and found a set of Caliber trucks on special. Only $70 AUD including shipping, already bought. Now I just need the money to buy some flywheels.... :P
