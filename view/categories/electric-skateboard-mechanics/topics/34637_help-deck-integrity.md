To all the Engineers out there, will the deck integrity be compromised if I drill too many holes to mount the enclosure? I am thinking about going with a larger enclosure but if I don’t need the large battery I might swap out for a smaller enclosure.  To do that I need to re-drill different holes.  

The deck is not very thick (around .3 inches) and is made of vertically laminated bamboo. It is also quite small with a 20 inch wheelbase 

I don’t really like thick decks unless I am going for speed, so that is out too.

If it drilling extra holes (maybe 10 in total if I swap the enclosures) affects the integrity of the board too much, Is there a way to reinforce it?

Maybe I am thinking too much and the casing helps to reinforce it a little...

If the holes are closely spaced in a line then yeah it is going to affect its bending resistance along that axis and weaken it but I doubt the holes you need are going to be particularly detrimental to strength as you say the casing will go some way to adding reinforcement.

I'll try to avoid that, thanks for the advice :slight_smile:

I had a 44in pintail that I put too many holes in, one of the 1st builds I ever did.  Ended up cracking down the side.

Any pictures? How many holes did you drill?

I didn't have the heart to take pics of it. I had 8 holes on each side for barrel nuts, 3/8s I think. I started using inserts after that, now I use 1/2 or 5/8s wide thread sheet metal screws.
