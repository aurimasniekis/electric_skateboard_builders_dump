After a lot of research I couldn't really find any usable info on how to mount a stock gear to the Orangatang kegel wheels.
So there for I want to share my way of mounting them to the wheels, I am sure there are easier ways to do it but I am alway a big fan of durability. 

Check it out :slight_smile:

I started with making a adapter tool for the wheels that would make sure to get them balanced when machining them.

Then I made a straight chamber that would align my Gear/pulley perfectly.

After that I started with the Pulley itself.

Then I made the hub that will come with a press fit of -0.04mm into the gear.

I used M6 bolts in combination with a aluminium ring that I had laser cutted at a local company for around 2 euro each.

I recently made a custom pulley for these wheels to! i used a cnc to cut the main body of the pulley and wire cut the teeth profile. Here's what mine turned out like. nice work by the way!  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4c60e6b5d12d29594dcaf25f59a2e82df83da519.png" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/bcb127cec046ced450bb26858935fc38f7003d75.png" width="658" height="436">

Wire cutting EDM?
I love this technology but try to avoid it.
When doing pulleys you can use a 4,2 mm drill to make the lower part of the teeth.
If you have a cnc you can finish the part in one set up.
The fit of pulley/belt drilled with 4,2 mm

What's wrong with wire cutting? apart from being a very slow process and a kind of a pain to set up the profile is a perfect fit.

No nothing wrong!
It just takes longer and the result is perfect.
For me it's just easier to stay on one machine and finish the pulley there.
