I'm trying to set up my board and noticed that I never received the screws connecting my motor to the truck mount. Does @onloop or anyonelse know the size? It doesn't seem to be a #6 nor a #8.

I don't own one of these mounts so i can't check. But i can take a guess and say that you  are looking at imperial screw sizes when it should be metric? Just a thought, i may be completely wrong though haha

M4 x 10 button head.
See if you can get them in the quality 10.9 and use Loctite!
