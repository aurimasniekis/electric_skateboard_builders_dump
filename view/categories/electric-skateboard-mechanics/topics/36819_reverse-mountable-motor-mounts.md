There seems to be a few motor mounts on the market but are any of them reverse mountable so the motors hang out the back of the board.

hey, if loctite doesn't keep em on then go get it welded. I've read surprisingly good reviews, no need to spend an arm an a leg if it gets the job done

I won't argue that.  I just don't 'think' they will handle the long-term stresses of hard riding. The appear very brittle to me.

Just to demonstrate dual 6374s can be mounted on TB218mm, the actual setup would have a longer arms to clear the deck for turning.
