Hi Everyone,

I'm currently riding a dual 6374 eboard and the Torque Board motor points are always coming a bit lose. I ride over some pretty mean terrain on my daily commute (across train tracks, on a freeway overpass that has giant 1-2 inch gaps between pavement plates, up sidewalk ramps with those little yellow bumpy patches).

With that in mind I really just want to upgrade my motor mounts to whatever the community recommends. Something I can put on and forget about.

Does anyone have a recommendation?

Here is the latest victim of my motor mount coming lose... the pulley started to carve into my wheel.

Thanks in advance!

If you can't get the mounts installed solid then you could have them welded. Failing that get some standard caliber 2 2 pieces mounts, shave 2mm off the bottom of the TB 218s, about 20mm and install. The 2 piece mounts will never come loose.
