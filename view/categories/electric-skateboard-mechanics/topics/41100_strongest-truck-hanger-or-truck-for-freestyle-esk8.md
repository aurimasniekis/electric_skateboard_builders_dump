I have been riding theeve titanium trucks for the past few years and never going back.

They are the best trucks in my opinion, light as a feather and far stronger than indys, which a lot of people swear by.

Grind nice, I've been down some big sets with them, and even had them ran over by cars on 3 seperate occasions. Worst was the truck bent to a 45 degree angle... I just bent it back and kept filming, haha.

I can recommend bear kodiaks!
May they aren't as light as titanium trucks, but they are rock solid.
Since they are forged aluminium they are way stronger then cast trucks!

I worked with titanium for years in the aero space industry. 
It is truly an amazing alloy. Light like aluminum but strong like spring steel.

In the past, after a year or so of abuse, every steel truck I've ever own cracks and breaks while riding. That's how I know I need a new truck.

 Now with the titanium trucks, I get 2 or more years, and the only reason I replace them is because I've grind one side down way too much (like fs a lot more for 50-50, 5-0, smith, lipslides, even boardslides, but I like bs noseslide, crooks, and nose grinds better for some reason, lol)

Too bad Theeve doesn't make longboard trucks. They would be #1 if they did.
Imagine, precision titanium trucks.
