I'm planning a small stealth build and came across these maytech hub motors, which are attractively priced. they range from 250 to 800 watts per motor. Anyone got experience with them? Are they any good?

Hei, I'm too eyeing on them, have you managed to find out whether they're worth a try?

Check out my Maytech review, overall there not to bad but don't go above 8 or 10S.
