I thought it would be really interesting to put on esk8. obviously you can't put on back, but only in front to have more carvy ride. do you think it's possible? I also found out these have massive wheel size 108mm
cost is quite high tho

Never tried a truck like that but I am interested in their wheels. I wonder if they are rubber or urethane, the description does not say.

The wheels are actually made of urethane.
