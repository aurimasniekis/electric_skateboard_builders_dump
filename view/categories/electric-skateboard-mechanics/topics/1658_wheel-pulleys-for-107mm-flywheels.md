I have a guy asking me about where he can get wheel pulleys for 107mm flywheels. I checked the usual suspects and came up empty. I'm sure he would even be willing to get something second hand. Anyone know where some are?

How many teeth was he looking for? Thingiverse has a bunch for the flywheels. I've printed up to 44t.

44t is probably a good option for him at that size.  I'll check thingiverse.

thanks for all the help guys. I think between all of these he's got some options. I'll let him know. 

I'm going to have to get my own parts made. I'm kind of tired of things showing up and disappearing all the time.

There's also one made buy imaterialize made of polypropylene, which is supposed to be stronger than pla or abs.  I think it's 44 tooth too and fits in the wheel and doesn't need any mounting bolts.  I've got two of them I'venever used and will sell them for 10$ each

Have been reading the forum for awhile to get educated enough to start figuring out what build I want to do.  My skills are limited when it comes to the electrical, but I see you maybe do some commission work?  How would we go about that?

I also see you looked into 107mm flywheel wheel pulleys, and I am considering 107mm Abec flywheel dual diagonal  (or dual rear if you advise) if belt driven.  Otherwise if go hub motor route, still need help commission but understand I need to go 4wd for 107mm hubs.  I weigh 200 lbs but like tourque, and live in NUC so one of reasons larger wheel is unpredictable street terrain.  I am also older so looking for smooth large wheel low duro.

Do you have advice on the right build design for 107mm, whether belt or hub? I have not gotten brave enough to start my own build thread yet, just reached out to two hub vendors on site (Carvon awhile back, and JacobBloy just now, maybe try hummie as well?).

Any thoughts or help in commision work would be much appreciated!  Trying to get a DIY while I wait for evolve GT carbon <g>.

Thanks!

there's an "e-skate" company down the road from me called e-glide that had a pulley for the 107mm abecs, you could totally try contacting them and seeing if they can provide. Totally cool team, they let me walk all around their shop and showed me everything they were working on.

I watched their video on Altered site and it's definitely 15mm.  You can see HTD5 and i think 265 iirc.

The challenge w/ the Electric Flywheel 107mm's is the depth compared to the regular flywheels.  I have a set and haven't measured them yet, but the only ones i've seen built for the e-fly's are Altered's.  I would like to see how i can use spacers or some sort of 3d printed spacer to use the regular flywheel gear.

I need to bust out the calipers and get some measurements comparing the two.  @longhairedboy - let us know what you find as this is what i'm hoping to use on my replacement e-GBomb!  Thanks man!

**27mm!**  

Would love to see a spacer could print to use these easily.  Or more dedicated gears setup for them - like Altered, but maybe without needing to remove hanger material.

Edit - pictures showing correctly?  Google photos vs Picasa... pita.

So after riding this longboard stroller thing this morning with my little man, I'm gonna do a build with these for sure.

Much much more comfy than my 80mm Kegels. 

So, 
a) where the hell do you buy them?
b) if anyone wants to do a group buy for the correct pulley, then I'm in for at least 4 pulleys?

Hey! I'm making the flywheel pulleys now. can you tell me what this dimension is, the edge where the conical portion meets the back of the wheel? I only need it for the 83mm and or also the 97 just to see if it's compatible because I dont actually own flywheels and modeling this blind is a little trickier than anticipated.

I'm only making the 15mm version right now.  I dont own any flywheel's or clones so I'm fulfilling the request to make them but am using the mating portion of this [STL](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:545345) and changing the pulley to 34-44. My issue is the 42T pulley is larger than the 40T and I dont know if the pulley sits recessed in the wheel or proud so the teeth could be hitting the back of the wheel, not allowing for it to sit properly against the wheel and hub, but I dont know.  

With 15mm depth and the dimension of that ring I would know though which is why i want to know what it is.

Built a board using these wheels some time ago. This board is built for cruising. Ultra smooth and rolls over anything. I don't think Abec makes these wheels with the black cores any more. I think the black cores represent a 75a durometer.  The wheels are mounted on Paris 195 trucks. The pulleys (9mm) and mounts are from TorqueBoard with the exception of the motor pulley a 19t. Motors are HK Sk3 245kv. Two things need to be done in order to use these wheels. The trucks need to be turned down to mount the motor mount in far enough and a wheel spacer needs to made up. 
Already planning another build with these wheels. Already have the wheels and a 40T wheel pulley <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/dee7aa4f8d722f7bdca1548bf2b48613cde476d1.jpg" width="640" height="428">made.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5f316b1707d42ba63bb164c7cd0f93ce727a66d5.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/ca7ee27862cb07d6f8d15e8f1d6f152f0325e3d7.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7e05250ffb55b2a3a41735c5f4cebf7a91ef888b.jpg" width="640" height="428">

@cdn what wheel pulleys did you use, just the standard Torqueboard set he still sells in his website for old build? And the new build where did you source the 40T wheel pulley?  Lastly, given you have to mount the motors so far in, what is the largest motor mm that still fits in a dual rear mount configuration?  Or is only dual diagonal possible?  Thanks!!

I used Torqueboards standard 36t wheel pulley. For my new set-up, the 40t wheel pulley I sourced from ebay. The pulley comes with a center bore that has to be enlarged. The mounting holes have to be drilled and tapped on the pulley. I had gotten 2 pulleys done at a machine shop for  $75. 
Doesn't look like you can do a dual rear configuration. Just not enough room.

@cdn - glad you chimed in.  I remembered you had these setup w/ custom spacers, but couldn't remember your username here.

Do you mind measuring the spacer you had made?  This was what i was thinking i'd see if i can get 3d printed in ABS or something strong/light vs metal like yours.  Shouldn't need to take a ton of load, just space the gear out to clear the deeper wheel.

What length and type bolts are you using - extra long m4's?

@Chaka - would love to see an aluminum option for these beasts!  maybe 42/44t?  I have a set of the new 40t DIYes ordered and intend to try them for these, or my 97's if i can't figure out how to fit to the e-fly 107's.

The spacer I had made up measure 12mm thick. With this thickness, there's only about 1mm between the belt and wheel when mounted. I think a 13mm or 14mm thick spacer would be idea. For my next build, I think I'm going to make my own spacer. I've made my own spacer out of 1/8 aluminum when having to mount abec 97's using Torqueboard wheel pulley. I'll just have to make say 4 of these to get a 13mm spacer needed.
I took a measurement on how far the V3 TB mounts sit on the truck. It measures 61mm (Sorry about the bad pix).<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8fffa914860cb1ae35f0fe1ce6aef883027b37dd.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/dbb1b42ce74cfdd9406c53b46f4adad82acd301a.jpg" width="640" height="428">

Thanks @cdn!  What's the outside diameter of the spacer you had made?  I'm a bit surprised it doesn't have any taper or shape to fit into the wheel...  Must just be a straight spacer.  Simpler actually than i thought.

What length and type bolts?

Thanks man!

I knew I forgot something. The bolts are M6 X 65mm. The diameter of the spacer is identical to TB's wheel retainer. All my measurements were taken from the retainer except the thickness. When the bolts are tightened down, the end of the bolt is flush with the wheel pulley surface. If a 13 or 14 mm spacer is made, the bolt length may need to be increased to 70mm.

Perhaps blasphemy lol, but I am looking at this separate esk8 thread on 3D printing 44T ABEC wheel pulleys for larger efly wheels. Would a 3D printed spacer of 12-14mm work in that case for 107mm wheels?  Or in this case with TB 36T wheel pulley, as I do not have access to machined parts here so easily. Any thought much appreciated as I really need to figure out this 107mm build. Thanks!!

No it want, the wheels are larger and theres more distance to their core

HEY! can you see how they fit. My understanding is the core in the 107 is offset something like 12 mm towards the center of the wheel so it more than likely wont fit well if at all. That being said, if someone can get me pics of the wheel, and the relative dimensions to adjust the model, I can go ahead and whip those up in the next few days.

Thanks @JuniorPotato93   Hoping someone on this thread more capable than I can provide the precise measurements you need to create a 107mm wheel pulley that works. I can take pictures but don't even have a pair of calipers lol!!

Hey @JuniorPotato93 - sure i can try to help with that.  I have no issue taking the pictures and posting them.

What i don't see how to measure is the inside taper of the wheel.  The depth to the front of the bearings seating edge is 27mm deep - but the narrower top opening vs 76/83/97mm flywheels means an inside profile that is "steeper" if that's a good description.

The depth is 27mm - the top inside lip of the wheel i believe is 61mm ( i did a quick measurement - i'll confirm) - how that tapers inside seems tough to determine just from these measurements.  I could do individual measurements in 1mm increments from the lip of the wheel to the inside bearing lip...  that should give you a plot of the profile, but would be about 20-30 measurements i'd guess.  Alternatively i could try some sort of putty - put inside and remove, then picture the profile?

What are the groups thoughts on this?  best/easiest way to get this?  

At the end of the day i'd like to see if we can we get a 3d printable stl "spacer" to use w/ DIYes gear(or similar flat bottom gears from elsewhere)?  Maybe in addition to full printed 9/12/15mm gears around 40-44t?

I have a pair of gearing / wheel pulleys that now work with the 107mm electric flywheels!

Unsupervised w/ the GF out of town...  some spare time and the entire table to explode onto...  (and a few yummy Stone IPA's)

I think i've figured out two setups that will work with the e-flywheel!

1. @Torqueboards / DIYes 12mm 40t flywheel gears 
2. @Titoxd10001 40t 15mm flywheel gears

DIYes used M6-1.00 x 50mm bolts
@Titoxd10001 used M5-0.80 x 50mm

I was able to loosely screw them into the gear through the wheel, then measure depth/spacing from the face of the large washer i didn't use - i measured about 20mm difference.

Ordered the M6-1.00 x 70mm stainless from Amazon ([here are 10 for $8 prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y5HBMYY)).

DIYes 12mm 40t setup - Re-using the regular washer - the M6 x 70 fits *perfectly* flush and secure!  
[img]https://goo.gl/GP7zE7[/img]
[img]https://goo.gl/vyoTNW[/img]

Haven't received the M5 bolts yet to try with Tito's 15mm wide 40t gears yet, but expect them to work about perfect as well!

I'll x-post in the new 218mm clone truck from DIYes, but just test fitted dual 6374 motors w/ 12mm DIYes gears on 218 DIYes caliber II clones:
[img]https://goo.gl/iZ0Ovf[/img]
(note i swapped legit Caliber II baseplates onto longer 218mm hangers)

Suh-weet!  Now i need a second pair of the e-fly's!  

HTH - GL!

[/quote]

None really, except smaller size.  I had a set of trucks on a GBomb bracket (deep drop 35mm iirc) and had to grind to fit.

Thinking/planning to run these on another similar setup i wanted the smaller footprint instead of grinding on the front of the cup again.

yes sir

you would have to print the spacer in order to adapt them to electric flywheels.

I believe you don't need a spacer with the new flywheel since the core as been offset to fit on electric skateboard more easily

It is about the center set ones.  :slight_smile:

New offset ones are narrower, and offset to give a flush fit and easier.  But if you want monster fat wheels...  These center set (old style) are BEASTS!
