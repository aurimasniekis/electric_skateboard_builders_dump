Looks nice, at least finallly a close up pic of your steering system, nice work @MoeStooge

All I can imagine now is to add some sort of suspension / spring there to achieve something similar to what bajaboard has :D

I wanted to say this in the other thread already.. but Im glad im seeing someone going in this direction, as I have thought for a while that a new way of steering would be welcome and might benefit certain eboard users, so very glad to finally seeing some results and approaches to make this possible.

Looks like the front end of a buggy or dragster. Best looking unconventional trucks I've seen in a long time. Could be used in a crazy high-speed drag build.

If both ends on the axle adjusters are fixed, how does the axle rotate letting you turn? This is how alignments are done on cars. 
I like the idea and follow through, if those were shock like in cars, that would be great.

It's like a trailing link, right? I think it's sexy as hell. 

Is it something you machined as a one off?

1oldbaldguy  I have ridden this truck set up it is awesome. Moe building set for my new board we are working to build fastest boards with great run time Moe is a madman we want to get a race, 20 to 30 riders on a track like willow springs  somewhere around ten laps now that would be cool to participate in.
