Currently using nano x, and have extra 2.4ghz mini, just so seeing if I can use both? Figured when people test your board and having second paired would prevent them from stealing your board.

I dont think the mini an the nano are compatible and I don't think you could override one with the other anyway.

Best thing is to not let strangers test ride your board or let them ride it slow while you walk behind them holding the remote and controlling their ride.

I get people on the boardwalk asking to ride my board, I just say NO.
