Hello,

I am trying to design a motor mount similar to @kug3lis 's one for trampa trucks. I am looking for dimensions of the ends of the hanger and the location of the holes of the mounting plate.

It would be nice of you to give me this infrmation as I do not have the trucks.

Thanks in advance

I got 2 mounts for sale or trade if you with to use them and not make them yourself.
