Hey all,

I am looking to build an AT board using a Rayne deck, TB 218 mm trucks and 6x2 pneumatic. I am looking at doing a top-mount "case" battery (like an apache case). Just wondering from anyone who has ridden this type of board, how is the ride? Is there a noticeable difference between having the battery top-mounted vs under the board? Should I do a smaller battery?

Thanks
```
