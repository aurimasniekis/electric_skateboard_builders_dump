I was putting together my first DIY esk8 with the Torqueboard mounts and I'm finding the ground clearance a little low... does this look low to anyone else? Or am I being paranoid?

I can't raise it any higher.. the next possible position would be way too high.

Advice please!!!!!! Thank you!

Thatâ€™s too low... unless you get rid of the riser in which case itâ€™s reasonable. Alternatively, add another riser. Or just rotate the motor so that the wires arenâ€™t a problem and then youâ€™re good to go (most likely)

I had the same problem with other mounts. Designed my own mounts that will arrive soon from china :smiley:

I ordered a small batch and if they hold up well I will sell the ones I do not use myself.

On the topic of bringing up other mounts.....

Mine will not have that ground clearance issue either. Just thought I would casually throw this in the mix :slight_smile: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/boardnamics-idler-motor-mounts-for-sale/46255

You could try relocating the rear truck further back on the deck so that the motors are not under the deck.

@Erod - We have a reverse mount if you want to mount in reverse. Out of stock now but should have some in on Monday/Tuesday. Reverse mount will also clear the baseplate.

Move the trucks back and not do reverse mount?... hmm... might be crazy enough to work.

Thanks, I've already spend way more $$ on parts than I was expecting.. Would rather buy a used deck that fits better.

Do you have an SLDPRT or F3D file of those kegels by any chance?

Actually, I meant to move the truck back and keep it reverse mounted.

Yeah that's what I thought you meant at first.. but the motor wouldn't fit that high anyways, the trucks are in the way..

BUT I still moved the trucks back 3/4 inch to the rear and I think that's going to work non-reverse.. Just need a slightly higher riser.. so thanks for the idea!

I have the same issue, but the angle of attack I used is somewhere in between the first and second picture. I found the perfect height, i just had to move the motor head around and find the sweet spot. It took me around 3 hours to get it all perfect.

We have a reverse mount that clears the kingpin which is the better option.

We'll have more exact build photos soon that way everyone get's a better idea of what your able to do.

Question, are those the regular mounts or are the specifically the reverse mounts ?collections/electric-skateboard-motor-mounts/products/63mm-reverse-motor-mount-set 

I got the dual motor kit, and I had a dropdeck as my first board, so I tried to switch it to reverse mount but I ran into the same issue. I was thinking maybe their reverse motor mount would do the trick.

@tomymuci Yeah, you'd want the reverse mount if your running a dropthrough. To keep the normal mounts "as short as possible" we have a reverse mount for specifically mounting in reverse.
