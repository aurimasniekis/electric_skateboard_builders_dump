the asphalt in my area makes foot breaking hard, lots of grain and loose gravel usually ends in charlie brown moments  -.-

Lucky me I can footbrake at 40km/h no issues and it should be my board's top speed One less thing for me to buy, But I've always imagined that in an emergency I would hit the brakes and footbrake same time!

Usually that kind of asphalt makes foot-breaking easier.

when did I say that?! I have 2 longboards one cruiser and one DH freeride and I've been a longboarder boy for over a year! And Now I put on 90mm wheels and took of the 80a 70mm Slide wheels so it would be scary to do the same stunt without an option for an emergency Slide, If you like this post I will try send you pics that show that I got the Gear to do it!

lol.

if that happens again, I recommend turning as wide as possible (to slow down) then turning into somebodyâ€™s driveway and making a final dismount.
iâ€™ve had to do it a few times

Few tips about foot braking.

At speed don't straighten your foot like you were if pushing. Keep it angled
![IMG_20180312_142024|374x499](upload://fXuFSjVJ8g2ccOCvrGKbenEjOEd.jpg)

Heel down first
![IMG_20180312_142047|666x500](upload://wOlNlqxkecEF7vFdyckzlNwqym5.jpg)

Foot brake toes pointed towards the board
![IMG_20180312_142214|374x499](upload://aB67ePVi40vffycShqeaszHKuR4.jpg)

If you step to fast with your toes pointed inward your leg will stop and stabilize against the board

If you have your toes straight or outward your leg will follow and you will do a split.

1. riding on sidewalks pisses people off. avoid it if possible

2. turn into the road (if no cars are coming) and proceed with my earlier instructions

Heel down first is an important step, Once I tried toes in first It felt like a strong smack  to the place where you can see bone lines going into the toes.

No problem dude.  It's almost easy once you do it a few times... But prepare the glue and fresh braking soles. :)

Nah no shoegoo for soles....  Superglue all the way...

Shoe goo is for street skaters to fill holes in the cloth from kickfliping....and the sole back to the cloth. But for sole to sole... superglue is all I use.. mainly for the reason you stated...I don't want my brakes to fly off ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
