Caliber 2: It has a square shape and it allows for more "leverage" for the motor mount.

SurfRodz RKP, Caliber Precisions.

But the holy grail would be Ronin Precisions, as there's a more defined actuation due to the Queenpin.

Are these really affordable or necessary for 30mph...not at all. But they feel amazing.

As far as I know, this are the only motor mounts that fit the Gullwing Sidewinder II trucks and are specifically designed for them. They are made by a company called T Board Factory (I think they are from Korea). Here is the link for the web page where you can get them. The mount piece assembly is called "Electric Board Powertrain Bracket for Sidewinder Truck" (you need to use Google Translator to surf thru this site)....

If you scroll down the page you will see other images from different angles. Don't worry about how you see  the clamp openings that grab the hanger, apparently they look like they are round but they are not. But believe me, this mounts are made specifically to fit the Sidewinder uneven hanger cross-section. Fits no other truck in the world.

...and they are awesome!!
