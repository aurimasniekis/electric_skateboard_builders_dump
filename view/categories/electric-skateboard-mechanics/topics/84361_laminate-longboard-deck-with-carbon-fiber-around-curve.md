Hi,
i´m trying to laminate an old longboard deck with carbon fiber and epoxy.
It goes well, but i have problems with the curves.

Does anybody knows whats the best doing to get a clean transition within the curves?

Thanks!

Here is a hummie deck I put a layer of CF on the bottom for.


Do you have a plan or have you worked with these materials before?

This is basically the process I use.  Pay very close attention to order of operations and timing of steps.

In your example you didnt wrap it around the edges. 
I wanted to wrap it to cover the used edges.

What i mean:

Notice its just the first "try-out" layer. It looks shit, i know :smiley: 

Thanks!

Are relief cuts in carbon fiber a thing? Looks like there area just needs a large amount of them.

You are not going to get as good as a result wrapping corners.

You can, but the CF must distort to accomodate that drastic direction change...

Watch that video, it will help you a lot.   Your order of operations is what is hurting you.

You will definitely have a lot easier time not wrapping the edges.  Just paint them black and they will disappear.  Trust me.

Geberal rule for CF is that you cannot work well with sharp corners unless you segment your fabric accordingy. Its not like skinning a car ;)

How much strength does one layer add? Would top and bottom one make a flexible board rigid?

It absolutely will.  It also of course depends om what weight CF you use.

A layer on bottom will have more effect than a layer on top

Cant wait to get mine back (laminate on bottom, 200gram CF), hope somewhere next week or so (but have time.)

Very helpful video! Thanks!

I've also seen you wrap some decks with other cool fabrics such as this one at the end https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words/2992/9085?u=legend27.

What material did you use and where did you get it? Did you use the same method as in the video?

Sorry for overtaking this thread, but....

I use essentially that method and you can use many different types of fabric and do that process more or less.

Thanks! Is there any specific website where you buy the fabric with premade designs?

Be careful, and pay attention to scale.  Some of those are larger or smaller than you think.

@Sender wouldn’t a CF layer on top cause some interference with a remote?

That shit is blown out of proportion.

Maybe on a pure CF deck with a solid CF enclosure you could get some weirdness.


I haven't experienced any issues with single skinning layers.

Good to know I just wasn’t sure as I have heard it but never dealt with cf on a board.
