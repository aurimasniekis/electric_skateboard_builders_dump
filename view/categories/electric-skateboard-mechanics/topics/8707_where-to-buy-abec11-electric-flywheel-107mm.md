I checked everywhere and cant find anybody that has them in stock. Does anyone know where i can buy them in USA?

@caustin where did you get yours from? can I buy them if your not using them?

They come in and out of stock, so I had set alerts.  Also got a used set on ebay awhile back, but using them currently.  Did you check with Abec directly, their direct sales arm seems to have the 74a version in stock (which I prefer), but probably have to call them quick to verify

And those are brand new offset SuperFly ones as well. Should fit existing pulleys with ease. Price on the other hand... :)
