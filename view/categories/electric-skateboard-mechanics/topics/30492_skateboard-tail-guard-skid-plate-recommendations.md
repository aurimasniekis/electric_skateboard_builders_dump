I'm not associated with this company. I just like their selection of tail guards, and they make them in all kinds of sizes, and they are thick. 

They seem to specialize in some real nerdy skate styles, like slalom, LTD, skog, LDP , freestyle, and 360 competition. Their deck section is interesting as well.
