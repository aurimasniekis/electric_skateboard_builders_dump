With the jet spud 29" being incredibly hard to get, what are some similar decks (about the same length and wheelbase)? bonus points for cheapo ebay decks for all us brokebois out here

I ordered 2 from this site.   Nice and stiff.  Perfect for boards.  Came out to about $40USD each shipped

Check out freebord.com

Edit 08/2918:. Please DON'T check out freebird, they have said they don't like us and don't want to sell to us.

I haven't actually skated it yet, but it seems pretty stiff.

Did you get the Maple or bamboo?  It looks these are pre-drilled for the freeboard trucks?

I got the maple, they are pre-drilled.  I'm re-gripping mine, with the enclosure you won't see the holes.

Even more difficult... Alternative to jet Spud in Europe??

Short board, long wheelbase, concave...

i think i'm gonna use my bluesky finch for now, until someone figures out where the hell the jet potato 29" can be procured.  Let's keep this thread going for everyone else though
