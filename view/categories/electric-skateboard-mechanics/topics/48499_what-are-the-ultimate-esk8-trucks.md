Trucks are important. They're the main core how we ride and just the littlest tweak can make a lame ride feel amazing!  

We usually have to work with the trucks we're given and work around any imperfections or details a truck may have that make using them difficult, whether it be them being too thick, short, weak,etc. 

But the question stands, what are the ultimate trucks for ESK8? 

How long should the hanger be? 
How long axles? 
How thick should the axles be? 
What pivot cup should be used? 
What bushings should be used? 
What type of bushing seat? 
What is the best degree for the base-plate ?
What ride height should the truck aspire to achieve? 
Forged? Precision? Cast? 

What is the perfect combination needed to make the best trucks possible? 

I would love your input especially @Alphamail, if you don't mind.

I personally think Paris and Caliber are the Ultimate Esk8 trucks, so many mounts for them almost no clearance issues everything just simply works with them.

We have been asked so many times to make trucks that we have lost count and we continue to resist.  I think it would exhibit extreme hubris of us to think we could ever achieve the goal of the designing and making the ultimate truck for any discipline.  Over the years we have had the pleasure to work with many truck companies to fine tune their designs to achieve the goals they have strived for and we will continue to do so.  We truly enjoy the diversity of what is being offered and we invite new designs to be developed as we feel there is a long way to go!  I think the short answer for me is the ultimate truck is very personal and we built RipTide to help you turn whatever truck you have into your personal Ultimate ESK8 Truck.

There is no ultimate ESK8 trucks. It's whatever keeps you on your board going downhill fast without speed wobbles.

Yeah that would be the duck's nut's, the kittie's tittie's the...

just need a screw on axle that is wide enough for the motor mount, pulley/drive gears and wheel clearance... I imagine there wouldn't be many buyers but, cause of price. I just bought my second set though, I'd be in for a third!

 ![image|630x500](upload://1kJnnbfS7jC2lGWRqL0Si0D9HaF.jpg)

the Ronin screw in axle...
Hangar is only like ~140mm wide so it would work!

EDIT: Nevermind, found them: https://www.surf-rodz.com/products/category/hardware

anyone know what the washer is called and where to find it? I tried to use bearing spacers and it was just a tad too long for my needs, ended up using like four speed rings.

as for the off-topic ice cream. I'm gonna have to be that weirdo that hates vanilla and butter pecan and side with coffee or coconut pineapple

I've got some 10mm axle spacers, 8mm wide I think. I'm.pretty sure @psychotiller has a bunch too.  If you can define the size you need I'm.sure someone will have them.
