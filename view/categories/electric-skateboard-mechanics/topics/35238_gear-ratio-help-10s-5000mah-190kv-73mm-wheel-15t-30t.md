Hi guys

With this setup: 10s 5000mAh battery / 190kv motor / 73mm wheel / VESC , will a gearing of 15T to 30T be ok?

Since 73mm is smaller than usual you'll need to make sure that the wheel pullies diameter is small enough. But other than that the ratio should be fine.

The question is, will your belt clear rocks and stuff that your wheels roll by.
Also need to consider ground and deck clearance.
If your running a 63mm motor with 73mm wheels, that doesn't leave much ground clearance for the motor.
Your batteries and electronics will also be too close to the ground.

I run 75mm wheels with a 32t pulley - no damage from rocks hitting the pulley at all. I also have a 63mm motor and there is ample clearance for it and batteries etc.
That gear ratio will give you a top speed of roughly 40kph or 26mph.
