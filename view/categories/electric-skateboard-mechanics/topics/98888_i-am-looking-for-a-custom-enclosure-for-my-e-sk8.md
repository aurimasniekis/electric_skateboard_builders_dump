I have a board with a 12s4p Psychotiller pack. I also have a Psychotiller enclosure that was supposed to fit it. It doesn't. There is not nearly enough room to fit 2 focbox, my loop key and the battery pack.

Does anyone know how I can get a custom enclosure or at least one that will be able to fit everything?

@Skunk @Miniproto

Thanks for the responses! the pack is actually a 12s5p in flat configuration. i can get exact dimensions later tonight if you need.

the deck is a landyachtz billy bones  osteon (https://www.amazon.com/Landyachtz-Osteon-Longboard-Skateboard-Complete/dp/B06XW35YRX)

again i can get you guys exact dimensions later if you're able to do enclosures??

I can 3d draw and print in pieces, if you wish we can make a Glassfiber Mold or reinforce the printed with glass or Carbon.
Just an idea..
