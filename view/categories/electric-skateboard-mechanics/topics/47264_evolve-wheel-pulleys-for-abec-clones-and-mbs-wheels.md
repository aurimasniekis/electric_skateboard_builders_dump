Can anybody print me evolve wheel pulleys that would fit on abec 97 clones and then pulleys that would fit on MBS wheels. 

I can shave down my stock 32t evolve ones but wouldn’t that ruin them for the abec 11’s? Before I deremel anything I was seeing if anyone could print me a nylon set. I live in orlando FL

What is the difference between the clones and the genuine Abec 11's? It seems like the Evolve GT wheels are clones...
