Specifically what Ollin uses. I would assume that they're a normal COTS product and not a custom job. Is there a specific name they fall under?

Yep...those are totally custom. We machine the outer shell from aluminum tubing and the bolt is also modified on our lathe. They are time consuming to make so we haven't offered them as a stand alone product. Once we have a lathe with more automation we will be happy to offer them as an individual item.

Damn! That's a shame, they seem really nice. I've been peeking around the internet looking everywhere for some standard cam follower bearings or track rollers that small that aren't 50+ usd. Thanks for the quick reply <3
