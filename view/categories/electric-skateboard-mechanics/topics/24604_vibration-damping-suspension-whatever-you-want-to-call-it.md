Alright, so first things first, I'm a first time builder. 

I'm building a board for commuting. Mainly to school, but not exclusively.
For this reason, the board has to be small, to fit in my locker. Not necessarily a penny, but definitely not a longboard.

None of the above would be a problem, if everything worked as I expected it to.
On the first test ride, I came to a conclusion: 
The board is a lot of fun to ride, but only until the first crack in the pavement, or a ledge.
(My city is full of pretty big cracks. One or two wouldn't be a problem. Having one or two / 10 METRES is more than just annoying)

I thought having 97mm wheels would be enough, but as they aren't the softest, it is unrideable.
Not necessarily the board, but the sound that it makes when it hits something, worries me so much. I can't think of anything else, than the fact that all this stress gets to the motor :sweat:.

I have caliber trucks, and a stiff deck, so basically the wheels are my only chance to kill vibrations.

My qustion is the following:
WHAT SHOULD I DOOO?????? (That is cheap and not too bulky :neutral_face:)
------------

Here are the options I have found:

1, TRAMPA from the man: @okp 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/6/763a91741a161d4bce04f62d987329402786da62.jpg" width="575" height="500">

Pros:
 - Beautiful
 - Probably goes over everything

Cons:
 - EXPENSIVE af
 - Pneumatics have to be replaced often, if ridden on concrete -> even more expensive.
------

2, This...
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/e/ee07a4d63c99029880d9c2818189c70abfbd80b4.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Pros:
 - Relatively inexpensive (50 euros/pair)
 - Looks promising

Cons:
 - Never seen it tested, maybe it isn't functional in real life...
 - Not that slick
 - Raises board
 - New holes have to be drilled.
------

3, Avenue suspension trucks
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/a/3ad3d263c2a654e5655102f9d97b5f1fee09e7f0.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Pros:
 - Kind of works
 - Cheaper than trampa
 - Looks better than option "2"

Cons:
 - Pain in the ass to get it working
 - Uncertain of what happenes at high speed
 - Still pretty expensive (You have to buy: the trucks, risers, maybe even combine the baseplate with other trucks like evolve)
 - Not sure if it makes that big of a differance
------

4, MBS 100mm all terrain wheels
(You don't need a picture)
This might be combined with options above

Pros:
 - Looks good
 - Compatible with enertion pulley, which I already have
 - Everyone likes them

Cons:
 - Texture wears off 
 - (espensive)
-----

5, Flexible deck

Pros:
 - might help if combined with an option above

Cons:
 - Don't know if there is a flexible small deck out there
 - Batteries don't like to flex (Or if they do, it's firework time) 
-------

6, Freeboard bindings
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/6/4674d8515b14b343b0b2c4558a5bd6d809278870.jpg" width="519" height="500">

Pros:
 - Maybe I could jump over some cracks????
 - Looks cool
 - Not that expensive

Cons:
 - Maybe I could NOT jump over cracks...
 - Maybe I would land on my face...
 - Makes the board bigger
------

7, Let the sound be
Leave it as it is

Pros:
 - Cheap :slight_smile:
 - No modification needed

Cons:
 - Poor little motor
 - The evil sound will stay
-----



These are the options I found.
I would be more than happy to hear of other possible solutions, but even if you can't think of any, please tell me your opinion.

Is there anyone, with the same problem?

Please don't suggest good shoes, or similar, I am worried about the board, not myself :grin:.

Here are pavements, and ledges:
(Sorry for quality, this is taken from google maps. I didn't feel like going outside.)

Cracks in pavements like these: (Of course there are better and worse roads, but I expect my board to fly over these)

Woah, I thought the roads in my area were bad!
Let's start with the underlying question here: what is your budget, and how soon do you want to make the changes? (I.e., are you willing to wait- and suffer a little longer- and save more towards a better but more expensive solution?)

I am annoyed that whenever I hit something, the motor gets the shock. I don't really worry about the batteries, and the esc. 
A bump is only a problem for me, if it throws me off the board...

MBS 100mm all terrain wheels are worse than 97mm ABECs in 75a, you can remove them from your list

I do use the Avenue-Setup, they do make a difference but not that much, not sure if they are worth the "pain in the ass", I like them but other people don't

Because the motor mount is attached directly to the hanger, the only way to reduce its vibrations is to get smoother riding wheels. Thicker, more rubbery or spring loaded riser pads will help soften the ride for the rest of the electronics though.

Yeah, I know that, but I think that if I hit a bump, the motor will have "space" to move, (like the springs) and it might help a bit.
(I may be completely wrong, so correct me please.)

You mean that you don't want that you motors take a hit from ground? And eletronics can handle vibrations wery well. For example just protect them with some foam.

The motor doesn't hit the ground.
The impact comes from the wheels going into a crack, or hitting a bump.

Do you think the motor is fine, and I shouldn't worry about it?

Okay​, I _think_ I understand how those are supposed to work.
Maybe you could make wheels out of really dense foam rubber? Or moderately soft silicone rubber?
Both of those would soften your ride very well, but also slow you down a lot.

I don't think I have the ability to make wheels, but it is strange, that there are no alternatives out there. 
Also, speed is not a problem, I gladly sacrifice some of it for smoothness.

I like the high density foam idea. The RC car manufacturers use this concept. It has a tendency to create friction and break down under heat. I think your best option right now is to find a really low# durometer tire to suck up the vibrations.

@jbalint1122 a pic of your current build would help us to understand your setup. What about @psychotiller's new sixshooter wheels? They are 6" pneumatics that fit on regular skate trucks. Or modified Skikes? 

I have bad roads where I live as well, so I use pneumatics and they are great.

Like others have suggested - your motor should be fine.  They are pretty robust and unless you are physically impacting/hitting it on stuff - it should last a good long time.

Vibration and comfort riding is a pretty big deal in my experience.  I like to avoid big risers for wheel clearance (instead run boards w/ cutouts for wheels usually), but i almost always run some thin shock pads - soft rubber to help absorb some impact/vibes.  

Biggest difference i've found is good soft duro wheels, and the larger the better for cracks and rough roads.  My favorites are the[ legit 97mm flywheels in 75a duro](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/wheels/2166/97mm-abec-11-flywheels-wheels).  B U T T E R ! ! !  (super soft/smooth).  Hard to find lately and stupid expensive...  I also have some clones that work OK, but there is a noticeable difference.

A flexy deck also helps a ton.  I have a vanguard w/ 80mm kegels (also a nice soft duro and riding wheel) and it absorbs the bumps really well - but the flex is a PITA for battery placement and keeping stuff firmly mounted underneath.

HTH - GL!
