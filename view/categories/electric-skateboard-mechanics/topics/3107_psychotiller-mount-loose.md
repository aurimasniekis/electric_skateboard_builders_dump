I've tried new set screws, every orientation possible, and locktite, but for some reason my Psychotiller mount will not stay in position. It consistently loosens and then ends up causing the pulley to shred the inside of the wheel. At this point I might as well just drill straight into the trucks and screw the mount all the way into it. Does anyone have any experience with this issue or know a fix?

Have you used red loctite?

263? Because that stuff is not supposed to come loose at all

263 and 242 are what I've tried. Its weird because it doesn't even seem like the set screws back off at all. I go to retighten them and theres no room to tighten them further. The mount just slides down the truck towards the wheel.

Caliber 2's. In the gold color if that changes anything.

I believe there was an issue with manufacturing.  contact @psychotiller

Yeah it's a shim or use shrink tubing to fill the gap but def check with @psychotiller ....there are some mentions of this in other threads...not his fault...caliber buffs by hand so tolerance is diffrent from truck to truck...some dude wanted to make your truck extra smooth lol

So just some shrink tube inside the clamp portion? Should I put it under the set screws too or let those still go straight to the truck?

Anyplace the mount touches the truck ... Let's see if that works üëçüèª

I have Caliber II cast trucks with TB's mount and I took a piece of ¬Ω" shrink tube ¬Ω" long and cut it so it makes an L.
then wrapped it around the truck hanger under the mount so its touching 2 inside surfaces of the mount and that makes them tighten down so solid that they feel like there welded on. I believe  Tiller's mounts are very similar so it should work the same. But you mentioned set screws so I don't know. TB's is a one piece clamp with one bolt to tighten it.

Doh! It's the shimmy shimmy shake then...unless you add more shrink tubing

Contact psychotiller and he will probably send you a shim. I had the same issue. Like Michaelinvegas stated, it has to do with truck diameter variations. My solution was to weld it.

I first tried shrink tube on just one surface and that didn't do it. When I put it on 2 surfaces it made a world of difference.

Damn! Why do you think it broke again? Any chance your wheel pulley is off center?  Is the mount welded to the flex clamp?

I gauged my wheel pulley at under 2 thousandths. About as good as it gets I think. I'm guessing heating the mount for welding caused it to become brittle. Add some motor torque and it snapped. Yes it's welded to the flex clamp. I was tired of things coming loose. Put about 100 miles on it welded up and didn't give me any issue's until this.

@delta_19 That's just a bit messy on the weld. 
@psychotiller shure. I will give it another shot. Just went and picked up another truck. Was debating where to go from here.

I'm working on a titanium solution for the plate. I think it will give flex a better fight than aluminum. Probably about a month out.

This is reality though:

I just pushed the order and the machining is underway.

Recently ordered Psycho60 O.G. mount. My question is: If I have an issue with the mount coming loose, would heat shrink or rolled shim material be my best solution to snug the mount to the truck? I have access to any thickness of SS shim ranging from 0.1mm to 1.0mm.

Then try to glue it together with some epoxy!

If you just ordered, it came with a metal shim of a specific thickness. Rolled shim material would be a good choice though.

I got the mount from longhairboy and didn't receive a shim or I overlooked it in excitement and threw it away. Figured brass shim stock would be best case scenario. Thanks man.

@psychotiller, how do those cups stay in place? Are they press-fit to the axles or just relying on the bolted compression force of the axle nut through the bearings and spacer?

[/quote]

Yes "relying on the bolted compression force of the axle nut through the bearings and spacer" and four 5mm set screws at opposing locations. I'm going to test a couple using moldable epoxy too.

Also has an integrated speed ring.
