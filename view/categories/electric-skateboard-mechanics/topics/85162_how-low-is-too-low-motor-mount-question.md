Just got my Evo Falcon and was planning on using Boardnamics 63mm mounts on e-calibers forward mounted with half inch risers. I legit have maybe about 3/4" from the mount touching the ground. Just curious if anyone is rocking mounts this low or if it's a bad idea. I don't wanna run reverse mount as my wires are pretty short and extending the sensor wire's are a pain in the ass, also forward looks better imo.

This is about as high as I can run them or  they'll touch the deck when I lean.

Why can't you tilt the mount up further? Those mounts are adjustable

They touch the deck, the highest I can get them without touching is about 3/4" from the ground.

```
Use a grinder and match the motor profile with 5mm margin and you should be fine

It'll let you rotate up too

Think that'd mess with the overall structural integrity of the mounts at all? I was thinking about filing down the the point of the mount as that's whats touching the deck.

```
It should be fine if the motor is less than 5kw because the torque won't be enough to bend it
