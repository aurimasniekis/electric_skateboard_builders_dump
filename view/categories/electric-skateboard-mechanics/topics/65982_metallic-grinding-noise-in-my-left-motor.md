I tapped it in place with the back end of a screw driver it's actually very snug I don't know how it came off in the first place I wanted to test fit before epoxy and now I can't get it off. Hmm the dilemma.

It wil heat up and will come loose again (When motor heats up metal expands and it comes loose).. Get loctite 648. Dont use epoxy, it breaks at high temperatures :)

Locktite 480 is better @Battosaii . It's a rubberized cyanoacrylate contact adhesive. Cures fast , crazy strong flows well. Done

No problemo! Make sure you clean everything first, all the dirt between magnets too, may as well glue them while you're at it! After you apply the glue, use a drill to spin the can, the centripetal force will get it into the nooks and crannies (spin it in a trash can or etc to catch the spray, that shit will NOT come off )

480 is only up to 100ºC motors get near that temperature pretty often, 648 is 180ºC
