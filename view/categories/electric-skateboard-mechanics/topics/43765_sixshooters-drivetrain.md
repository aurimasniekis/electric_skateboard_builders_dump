Been searching all around but I cannot for the life of me find any info on a drivetrain for the Sixshooters, calculated that I'll need 16T for the motor and 72T for the drive wheels (Going for dual).

The 16 tooth is no problem, but I can't find any gearing near 72T that is compatible with Sixshooters.

I'm Probably just missing something but any help would be appreciated.

Why in the world would you need 72t on a sixshooter wheel?  Also, I include 60t or 42t pulleys on request with my wheels.  Say's pretty much anything that can or should be said about my wheels on my site. ....Words- you gotta read 'em

I will say reading is one thing... comprehending on the other hand... whole other ball game... Unfortunately, I often fail at both.
