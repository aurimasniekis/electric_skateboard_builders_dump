Just put a set of caguamas on my board with a pair of brand new caliber trucks and I'm getting a slight vibration which looks like it's coming from the shape of the wheel. It seems extremely unlikely that the wheel would be that ovaled from the factory. Bearings and spacers are brand new as well Any ideas on what could be causing this? Also if it's important this isn't my first build.

Try some older bearings and spacers. Are all the wheels wobbly? Have you installed your pulleys yet?

Yeah everything is put together and went on a short shakedown run. The others are barely wobbly, like nothing I would be seriously concerned with.

It’s ok, third run, it’s amazing what an R-spec graphic can fix
