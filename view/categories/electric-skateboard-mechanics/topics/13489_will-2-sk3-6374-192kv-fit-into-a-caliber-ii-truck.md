What motor mounts would be needed for this build?

Would yousuggest the Caliber II 44 or the 50 on 10" hanger?

50's will be easier to work with and give you more clearance.

If I'll go with the Vanguard deck will I still require the Caliber 50? The Vanguard is an exposed wheel setup so no much clearance needed at least for the wheels, were you referencing to any other clearance?

Motor mount clearance as well.

So that is probably why my 44 calibers seem to have less clearance for the motor from the deck...

If you didn't buy them already I would just go with the 50's there are more mounts available for them. I also have 6374 sensored stealth motors for sale, they will be in stock within the week, and can save some cash. PM me if you want a promo code: https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/

2 sk3 6474s will not fit on the hanger. see my build thread:

I am still waiting on the VESC-X and Nano controller so my board is still just a pusher. With no spacer, I can mount the motor to the truck but and the motor just touches the deck. Jlabs 6374 is a little bigger than the carbon fiber motor mount plate and contacts the deck. I realize now that some of the clearance is removed when you lean the hanger down less. Also  my motor mount plate is angled more into my deck when it is affixed to the truck which also removes clearance since the enertion mount is not adjustable.I opted for the 44's because I want a more a stable truck at speed. I simply bought some spacers and that should take care of that issue while keeping the lower baseplate angle. You could get a 44 degree baseplate angle with a caliber 50 and some dewedging spacers instead. with someone else's motor mount ...DIYskateboards.com.. maybe this would not be an issue since DIY's are adjustable that way. My setup will work though with simply spacers which I need anyways to run giant wheels.

Great explanation, if you would have to choose again, would you go with the 50 instead of 44 with spacers?

I'd also like to know, can you mount two motor mounts for a dual setup on each side of the Caliber 2 44 track?

I see the SK3 6374 from HK are 2750W and the ones you will have are 3150W, is there much difference between both?

FWIW my Carbonated build runs like 60 degree trucks since they're on risers and I travel at 33+ mph with no worries in stability.

I personally want a slightly milder baseplate angle so I would probably go with the 44's again just so my spacers don't have to be angled. But, once I start riding the board, angle will probably be adjusted by spacers anyways just for fun and tuning the board to my liking which means there is no real advantage to the 44's in that regard. The advantages are slim between the two with the 50's working better without a spacer as far as I can tell. One  review on the caliber trucks say the 50's are capable of 25-30 ,and faster than that they would go 44. That is just one reviewers opinion though that I read. http://www.longboard-life.com/2013/07/a-higher-caliber-caliber-truck-guide.html I have not tried a set of 44's next to 50's. 50's are taller though and angle the motor mount more away from the deck. Pushing around on my deck with the 44's I feel like they trucks are pretty turny already and 50's should be even more twitchy. I think I could probably put in some harder bushings though or just tighten em up but I don't think the 44's need to be more turny so I would never add wedge to get 50. If anything I'd take more wedge out.

Did you noticed that you can't fit two 6374s on rear truck. You have to go dual diagonal. How much you weight? I think you underestimate the power of these motors.

Thanks Tuomalar, I'm still on the learning process, I'm not sure how to calculate the correct power of the motors that I'll need for my build, my weight is 70KG (154 pounds), do you think 2 6355 190kv would be a good choice?

Are there any tracks available with enough room to fit both motors at the rear truck?

I weight 95kg and I used APS 5065 260kv 6s system.
It was amazing how well it performed. 30kmh in few second and took easily 10-15 degree hills. 

I think you'll be fine with one 6374. You save a lot of money, board is lighter, better range and less parts to fail.

I really want to go dual at the rear tracks in order to to keep my hill climbing ability and split the stress on both motors, another very important benefit is the added braking power, for me safety is the number 1 priority

And as you can see there isn't any pre build belt dual drives with 6374 motors on a market.

Why not getting two 6355 190KV's? This is insane power and with your weight (same weight here) you actually don't need more, there is plenty of torque (promise). Go for the 50 deg Caliber trucks. I am using 1/2 inch risers + caliber II 50 deg to get enough clearance in order to run motor cables underneath, i.e. same principle as used in the Enertion Raptor build.

Yeah, it seems the mechanical kit only allows to mount two 6355 on the rear tracks, even though there is an option to choose 6374 from the drop down list when placing the order, I'll ask them tomorrow and will report back. 

I can't go with the calliber II tracks as they won't allow a dual motor mount as the DIYER one because of narrower track length

I weigh in at 210-215lbs. Using dual 6355 motors is perfect. Brakes are great, torque is great and nothing gets hot. There has been no hill I can't conquer.
Here is a picture of the dual 6355 motors on a caliber 2 50° truck using 12mm belts. 2 x 6374 is a no go.

I also have a second build at the moment using a single 6355 170kv motor on 12s.  It has also been unstoppable. I just miss the better brakes with dual.

You would be rocking on a 6374 with your weight and a 12mm or even better a 15mm belt.

@i2oadsweepei2 that setup is what I was looking for, your build is awesome thanks for the feedback and picture. After your experience I'll definitely go with the dual 6355 on the rear truck.

Did you use the mechanical kit from DIY Electric Skaboard?

Are your Caliber trucks fouty-four or fifty, 10" hanger I guess?

Is it possible to change the angle on trucks by changing a bushing, or you would need to get completely new trucks?
Since I have the 44 degrees caliber version. Would 2 6374s actually fit on those calibers? I might be in the same pickle.

I also got the 44 caliber II version and until I receive my motor mounts and start the build I don't see the need to mount raisers, at least yet.

You can add wedge to make the baseplate angle larger. ie 44 +6 degree wedge=50

I always use angle risers because it gives a bit extra clearance and difficult to find rubber(not plastic) flat risers.

One question boggles me quite a bit these days:
Why I haven't seen a dual 6374 build on Caliber II trucks in diagonal rear truck configuration; one under and one out back on the rear truck? I've seen diagonal dual configs but those were mounted on both trucks - one in front and one in the back.

I've printed my mounts and tested them either way with 265mm belts and it fit and rode well in both positions of the rear truck. 
I might go down that route for a killer dual 149kV 10S4P tarmac surfer beast alien thing :)

There's something about the diagonal setup that makes me feel uneasy, not a good setup for someone with OCD like me who needs everything perfectly balanced and aligned.

The good thing would be that you won't have to look at it while riding :slight_smile:
Maybe a nice motor cover/shield could make it a bit easier on the eyes. But imagine the acceleration on the 184 calibers...damn.
