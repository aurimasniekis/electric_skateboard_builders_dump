What do you guys think? Which has superior holding power,
What lasts longer? How about price ? 
Those of you who clamp, do they come loose or move and vibrate with/without thread lock.

I personally use welded trucks and it works fine but I have to get them welded and they're expensive and time consuming.

I looked for an existing thread but I didn't see any I hope this isn't repetitive

Obviously, because welded mounts are permanent theyre going to be considered more solid...but, I know first hand that mine don't move once they are set unless you need to move them for a different wheel size or model. Also, if you want to change your belt width its a benefit to have a clamp mount. Nice to have options.

I have welded all my mounts.
while I like the idea of clamping you kinda limit your truck selection to caliber or other squareish trucks.

I have TQB's clamp. I also have really fucked up paris trucks and they can still clamp on the completely round part. However, the alignment is shit if its on an uneven part of the truck and I need to grind the trucks so torque boards clamp can fit. I personally like my clap mount and recommend it for versatility and permanent clamping ability with lock tight.
PS you can use clamps for non square trucks.

On caliber trucks, or any truck **without** a tapering hanger, bolt on motor mounts are just fine: They won't slide down since the whole truck it the same width, and they will always be straight for the same reason.

Once you start mounting clamp on mounts to tapering trucks (i.e. paris, etc.) I think it becomes more problematic. 

I currently have two enertion mounts on caliber trucks, and love them. one is the older v1 (all aluminum), and the other is the new CF one. 

I also now have a welded mount on bear trucks (an example of one with a tapering hanger) so I will be trying those out as well. 

For now though, I have to admit that I have been using clamp style motor mounts for all my boards until just a week ago when I got the welded motor mount.

I've always wondered how you guys get the welded mounts to align perfectly with the axle ?
Do you use a jig ? Post pics if you have 'em !

to be honest, i dont have a clue what im doing when i line it up and it always comes out perfect.. i guess i just have a good eye! these are some super old mounts a made and mounted on my boards. in this pic they were pretty rough still

If durability and stability are not an issue...Then totally bolt mounts!! With a double motor setup, you can do up a bunch of different configurations to see what works best. You can try single motor/ rear, Single motor/front, Dual diagonal, dual rear, and even Dual front wheel drive! Don't know if half of those would amount to squat, but YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT!! Sweet....

@Patate Use a smaller flame mate..

@wmj259 I have never snapped a truck with a weld on mount. however I have snapped a few braze ons. I re brazed a few but I have moved to MIG welder now. I  never broken a MIG join

I'm working on my first build, I'd prefer to not have to buy new trucks, and do it as cheap as possible. I was looking at some of the ebay motor mounts but the problem is my trucks are about 21mm then taper to smaller as they go towards the middle, which is unlike most i've seen. Any hints/tips/suggestions?

You got 2 options.

Machine down that taper.
Or
Buy different  trucks.

We use a helicoil insert in our motor mounts to ensure the bolts stay torqued no matter what. No need for loctite or other threadlocker.

How much would machining down the trucks affect the strength of them? A snapped truck doesn't sound like much fun

The strength of the truck comes from the axle not that aluminium hanger. So you should be fine to machine them down as thin as the thinnest part... i mean its already that thin anyway so you cant make it any weaker.

[/quote]

Just to be clear, the hanger is what's referred to as a 'reinforcing substrate' in the fastener/machining area.  It spreads force/stresses across a larger part of the axle than would happen without it.  I don't know the exact percentage as hangers don't have incredibly tight tolerances, but I would guess it's about a 20% increase in overall strength.  Depending on how much of the hanger you remove you will decrease that value.
```

But you cant possibly decrease the strength more than the thinnest part.

You can decrease the stress by adding a fillet from the edge of the hangar down to the axle, with still a flat edge to hold the bearing. Otherwise either by making the axle thicker
Or making the hanger longer. 
Or better materials.

Correct, but you can loose a portion of the increase the hanger offers.  

I'm not sure it matters, just wanted to chime in and see what others had to say. I've always managed to find a way to NOT cut into the hanger because I didn't want to risk a snapped axle.

hello, this subject souds good.
I'm interesting by welding trucks cause i snap mine few time ago.
my board is mounted with some Gullwing Siderwinder trucks (double kingpin) same as the evolves trucks.
They are soooo good, very stable at high speed (30 mph) and can make very smal turns at low speed.
the only problem is that they have no profile (i mean no round square or U section)
so mu first plan was to buy a round profile motor mount (very cheap but hard strong steel)
I use a leathe to create a round section on witch I hot set a steel tube to reinforce the trucks and create a strong support to fix my motor mount.
The system was very good during 2years, i mean no 1mm of loosening in 2years.
But as I say the truck snap a few time ago so I have a new plan;
I'll re make a round profile on the trucks with the leathe and create an aluminum "ring" on the leathe that will fit around my truck.
I'll weld this ring on the trucks and this ring will hold my motor mount plate with 3 screws.

What do you think of my plan?
what type of welding is the best for this project?
does any type of aluminum can be weld on the truck aluminum?
Do you have any question?

[diy-electrique-skateboard-piece-moteur-support-kit|400x400](upload://9sIcp9vrJSILvrvzsIKFB1OS3Y7.jpeg) 

this is my motor mount , i pay the entire set only 40€ (43$)
you can see the ring that i will recreate in aluminum and the plate that she hold with the 3 srews.
so if I want I can disassemble the plate and I only have a small ring welded to my trucks so I can use them on a normal board just by unscrew those 3 screws.
This is a good point!
