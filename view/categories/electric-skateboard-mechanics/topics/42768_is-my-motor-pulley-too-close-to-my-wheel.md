Hello, this is my first drive train that I am building and I think my motor pulley is too close to my 97mm fly wheel clone. A picture is attachted that shows how close it is.

If it's not touching at any point, it's fine
Just make sure everything is very secure and doesn't budge, cause if the motor shifts it could lock up the wheel, but that's true even if it's far away  to start with

What a relief, though I was going to have to source new belts and a longer motor mount. Thanks!
