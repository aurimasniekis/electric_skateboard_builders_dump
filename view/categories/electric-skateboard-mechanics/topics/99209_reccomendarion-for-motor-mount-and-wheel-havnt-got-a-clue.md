Do more research. 
It's regularly advised to stay under 200kv at 12s

You can change gearing to achieve higher speeds.

Can't recommendations mounts if we don't know what trucks you have. 

I generally recommend staying away from ebay. Use esk8 vendors that will be there for you when/if things go wrong.

Hard question without knowing budget and style of boards you like. 

But it sounds like you're on a budget and obviously your first build. 

E-caliber trucks,  5065 racestars,  flipsky dual vesc, enertion clone mounts.

Idk who to buy batterys from in the eu.

But honestly i recommend finding a deck you like with an enclosure that fits first. 

I've seen a lot of first builds come to a stop over finding an enclosure that matches the deck the builder picked.

The race star looks a little small ?

Its the same price as the first motor you posted.  So im not sure how this is "stretching your budget "

[quote="Jonisonvespa, post:9, topic:99209"]

It's what Evolve uses. It also has fairly positive feedback from multiple members. 

+ these 6368 motors are longer, so now you're gonna need tb 218 trucks. 

+ i personally wouldn't buy motors off Amazon.  Nor do i know anyone who has.
Amazon is for hardware and whatnot. 
Not motors/ pulleys/ esc / batteries

I'm pretty sure you'll need Ecaliber trucks for those motors. 
I could be wrong but i don't think you can fit bigger then xx55 motors on standard caliber trucks unless you sacrifice belt width.

Depends. 
Motors and batteries from psychotiller and hyperion. 
Pulleys from build kit boards.
Sometimes stuff from torqueboards too. 
Vesc from whom ever has the best price atm.
All vendors i trust.
If you need more budget friendly stuff dickyho sells some good stuff on Ebay. 

I try to buy from other members whenever possible too.

You can message him directly on here to order stuff as well.
I don't like giving Ebay money so that's what i normally do.
