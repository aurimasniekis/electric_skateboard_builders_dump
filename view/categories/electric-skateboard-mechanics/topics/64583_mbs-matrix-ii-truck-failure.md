The Top Truck broke! While riding gently at slow speed. They are almost brand new. I received them two or three months ago. No abuse. I dont not trust them anymore.

Please E-TOXX or 3DSERVISAS, make alu Tops for this truck!

@Kug3lis No problem because the baseplate is quite shit euh I mean cheap it costs only 13 dollars. Would you like to have it shipped to 3DSERVISAS?

Or would you need not only the baseplate but the whole truck?

Is your hanger on backwards? I think the Matrix lettering should be facing out. I don't know if this makes a difference, but I'm curious if you did that on purpose, or if they came that way.

A new fullmetal top truck for the matrix II i think would be better with a bearing/kingpin system like the matrix 1 has, this should stop people going through tramps hat bushings so fast, if i was gifted like you lathe kings :slight_smile: i would double the bearings to four bearings on one kingpin with spacer rings/washers for the two inner position top truck bearings, more or less a beefed hybrid of the good bits of both trucks.... :thinking:

@Mobutusan : yes the hanger is backward because of the way the mount is screwed on it. It's the way the OVERION motor mount is done.

Anyway, there are at least two bubbles in the nylon, that should be plain. Those are measured 14 et 4 millimeters.

@Nemesis : because of the extreme mobility of the hanger, I damaged the deck a little in several sites.

@Maxid : maybe I was the unlucky guy because it's the first time someone here shows a broken Matrix 2 truck.

But as I said there is not only one but two bubbles in the plastic. Maybe more. It costs 13 dollars so it's quite cheap but at 30 mph (and maybe even less) its failure may have harmful consequences.

Actually that's not so cheap considering that TRAMPA INFINITY full alu baseplate is only 26 dollars.

Because of that 13 dollars plastic part, I could have damaged the motors and maybe the FOCBOXes. Not a good deal.

Not a good sign regarding the strength of MBS F5 ladder straps, that are full nylon too.

Not sure what you mean - if it would be made out of alu a QA issue like this would have had the same outcome of broken motors or whatever. The thing is you probably "just" got unlucky and the issue is not a real issue. Get a new baseplate for 13$ and be happy that in total you only paid what would be one Trampa baseplate. I am pretty sure you won't have any problems again.

I also got an isolated defect on one of my MBS Matrix 2, the axle was locked down and impossible to remove even with a hammer. So far, I'm riding my MBS Matrix 2 as hard as I can, on urban situations, stairs and they are still in good conditions. This one is probably a QA issue that can happen in the production line. 

As a side note but a bit related to this, I'm working on a personal project that I should be able to show you guys really soon, just need to wrap the last things, finish the prototypes, capture feedback and make it reality. By looking at the latest challenges few of us had with some brands to which we have given visibility, it's time to offer alternatives and for some, take the power back. Of course, this will be more costly but I'm a strong believer that was my mate @kaly is actually doing is the right thing and I can't wait to see what he's gonna pull out and rock one of his upcoming deck in Paris.

@Maxid : that's certainly what I'll have to do (motor mount machined for Matrix2…) and I'll be happier than what you say because I'll more likely have the new baseplate for free as a replacement (bought two months ago) and it's impossible that I'm the first guy that breaks a Matrix2 baseplate for the second time. :rofl:

The plastic baseplate concept never really worked vey well. Those baseplates are on the market since 2004 or 2005 and the problems are well known. Elongation of material, invisible cracks,  glass fibres giving up, air bubbles in the thicker sections....
The Baseplate is a part that is expensive to make, so plastic injection mounding is a way to reduce cost in production. The downside is the weakness of the plastic. Some pro riders are swapping this part on a daily basis when riding hard in downhill competitions. 

Since this part is safety critical, I don't think that
plastic is a good choice. You can't really inspect the part for cracks and air bubbles. It will simply fail at a certain time of use. I prefer parts that start to bend or develop play before they fall apart. This way you get the chance to replace a worn part before it finally disintegrates. 

How long the baseplate lasts is a matter of the bushing hardness and ride style. Harder bushings kill the baseplate faster.

I've searched the internet for a variety of different descriptions other than what they call it (top truck) and there are hardly any reports of these failing (I found one thread).

In fact, it would appear that most people posting about cracked matrix top trucks actually prefer it over the Vertigo trucks. Matrix breaks (13 USD part), Vertigo bends. But that goes in line with your philosophy.

Interesting. How many miles/km did you putt on this drive system before this happened? When you flipped the hanger did you tighten the kingpin down very much? Compared to my trucks, it looks like there are 1-2 more threads showing on your kingpin, so I'm wondering if you may have slightly overtightened the kingpin on reassembly and put extra strain on the kingpin holes in the baseplate. While it does appear that there may have been a small manufacturing defect in the baseplate, I'm just wondering if there are any other factors involved, or if you just got a lemon. Like others have said, I've read about maybe one other account of a baseplate breaking on the Matrix 2's, and after inspecting my trucks, I noticed a nice deep gouge in the baseplate from something I must have hit pretty hard. But no other damage besides that. I'd get another cartilage and try it again. Might have just been bad luck.

I agree does look like a tight kingpin nut...

Anywho on your piccy kinda looks like a cavity has been revealed in the middle of that gouge :mag: 
 ![mbsbubble|303x304](upload://y7JZiRCkny021PSB3s0GJMBfCbZ.PNG)

I suspect its common for that part to be not full fill and that could explain the cold weather cracking that has been mentioned.

@Mobutusan : the trucks had less that two months riding, and I rode it less than 200 km. I'm 100% sure I took care not to tighten the kingpin too much, because I knew it is bad and I'm used to unmount TRAMPA trucks (and tightening kingpin too much kills bushings).

You may be right about the possible impact. When the baseplate broke, I was riding very slowly on a real off-road path with quite big stones. It was the first time with this build. I see a possible impact on the baseplate. I rode many time and faster there with TRAMPA trucks and never had any problem.

Sorry, actually it is **not** an impact, it's just the plastic that was teared when it broke…

No impact : 
![IMG_4935|375x500](upload://1sddNiH6QyZHPdFiAo0zwhMxm6Z.JPG)

You can see how the opposite side of the baseplate is distorted.

Wow, that is some seriously bent plastic on your other kingpin hole. But it didn't break which is really interesting. I think you must have just gotten a dud that wasn't properly molded on the other side. If you've got time and tools, it would be interesting to saw through the other kingpin hole and see if the plastic has the same void as the side that broke. If it's solid material all the way through, that would probably confirm you got a defective baseplate.

Hey guyz,

Yes please, orthoptics !!

As I report in e-toxx shop topic when we talk about it, the main problem (I got) is this fkn nuts ... simply by setting a truck on a deck you could lost your mind :exploding_head: 

But seeing this  :hushed: and know that I prefer to ride offroad, I will not let the future tell me if yes or not my trucks got a production issue when I will jump like Superman to crash nicely on the floor if this could happen and that now we know it... 
 
Like said above, yes they are already 1000 and 1000 Matrix trucks riding in real MTB condition my mountainboarder and it doesn't seem to happen. But this was with the old production ...
On this new one (red damper, +20mm hanger length) I always got rip issues (I don't set 1000 but) plus this problem of air bubble that could happen any time, anywhere in the piece. I guess I'm porbably not a Fight Club player :sweat_smile:...
Like you maybe see in [NWJPDWUM](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/6442), we tried to sort out a full alloy version !.. More to comes soon :v:

@Mobutusan : I wait a little to make sure the store doesn't ask me to send them back the baseplate, but then I will cut it looking after other air bubbles in plastic, and I'll post photos here! 

It does not erase the fact there is no other case reported.

@Trampa : just to know, can you tell me it is possible to have air bubble when making parts il Alu?

@Riako : I just put the photos here, cause the link does not point to them :

Maybe that part of truck section could use a hugging metal band/shroud this i guess would have to bolt on through the deck next to them back nuts on the top truck, it would make it safer in case of a fail, though not sure what metal would be best as its quite a tricky bell shape to fabricate.

Quick snipping piccy... of what im trying to convey.

Hi @DavidC and all...

I'm a little late to this conversation (and this forum in general), so please excuse the delayed response.  I hope to make up for it in the form of knowledge I can share moving forward.

Really sorry to hear about your Matrix II top truck (baseplate) breaking.  The bubble makes it 100% clear that this is due a manufacturing defect and thus covered by warranty.  Hopefully you've already received your replacements.  If not let me know.  

I know the real issue isn't whether or not something is covered by warranty.  It's about confidence.  

The story of our nylon composite top trucks (and all our nylon parts) is a long one...  In short, early production runs of our original Matrix top truck and first generation RockStar hubs (early 2000's) had numerous problems (as mentioned above) and really gave nylon parts a bad name, deservedly.  We were learning about manufacturing in Asia at that time fell victim to untrustworthy suppliers changing materials on us, something that has been a struggle for many years, but that we now have control of 100%.  

In addition to controlling our material and process, over the years we've refined our formula and process to the point where I'm really happy with our nylon parts.  I'm not sure I've ever seen a RockStar II hub break (same nylon formula material as Matrix II), and the warranty rate on the Matrix IIs is actually incredibly low.  BUT, unfortunately it's still possible for things to go wrong in the mfg process as evidenced by the bubble seen in your truck.  

When nylon is at its best I truly believe it's the best material choice for a top truck.  The strength to weight ratio or our nylon formula is amazing and nylon's ability to absorb shock prevents a lot of bent trucks (top and bottom).  It's the risk of it NOT being at its best that complicates things, and thanks to the encouragement from all you in the electric community has ultimately convinced me to offer an alternative version of the Matrix II with an aluminum top truck (baseplate).   Ultimately it should be about choices.  

I hate riding heavy boards so for more than twenty years I've always pushed to make boards lighter.  But for your community it's clear that durability trumps weight, so we'll just give you what you want!

I'll save the details of what and when for our official release.  I just thought you guys deserved to know first given your interest in and support of our products.

By the way, thank you esk8 community!  I'm so excited about what you've been doing with our products.  The quality and spirit of your builds is amazing.  I haven't been engaging online but I've definitely been watching and appreciating.  Now that I've finally taken the plunge I'm looking forward to interacting with you all - learning for sure, and hopefully sharing some knowledge as well.  Just not next week because we'll be backpacking.  I love my job but everyone loves a break - yew!

Joel

JOEL!! Wassup! Great to have you here and to see how supportive you are of or esk8 community. And especially how transparent you are about your products. I figured MBS was on board with Esk8 in general after the LaCroix release, but hadn't seen any official MBS representation in the forums, so welcome! I love my Matrix 2 trucks and Comp 95 board as well as my Core 95 with the old Vector trucks (although it's in pieces for a build right now, hehe). Can't wait to see what insight and innovations you bring to the Esk8 scene. 
Cheers.

@MBS

Hey Joel, wanna say hello from E-Toxx.
Nice to see you here on Esk8B as active member.

We have build some Drivetrains for the Matrix2 Truck, Chaindrive and Beltdrive and Gearbox.
Latest product was a helical geared Mini Gearbox with integrated Encoder mounting solution.

well exactly this occurs in the mould when injection molded. seems that Matrix factory doesnt use a degassing outlet. mostly happens when two flowing fronts of molten polymer hit together like around this hole for the truck. everyone who uses Matrix trucks should be aware that the maybe all of their baseplates have those bubbles in them at exact this position.

EDIT: Added @MBS for posssible mould optimization.

The problem isn't that it was made out of nylon. The problem is in the design of channel trucks. The horizontal king pin is either ovalizing the holes in a metal baseplate or breaking the holes in plastic. Both are bad. It's a huge weak link in the channel truck design.

I can see your point @psychotiller but have enough of these base plates been made out of aluminum to determine if it’s a complete crap design. If ovaling of the hole is the worse aluminum will have to offer. I’ll take that over a broken nylon one.

No, just 18 years of some very brutal Slalom abuse with a smaller diameter pivot pin than MBS or Trampa.  Speaking of which, not sure why the offroad guys went with such a small diameter pin as they did, they could easily run .5" diameter to better spread the load of the abuse.

+1

MBS baseplates are not designed to withstand sustained road vibration with the added load of the electric drivetrain.  

Here among us we have 5? with deformed base plates and 2? broke.

Not faulting MBS; just stating fact that we are past spec for vibration on these baseplates.  

I gave up on MBS, I have a family and I need to know I’m doing right by them on my safety.  

This ain’t the BMX track, we lose people here every year.

My Lacroix is being built now with Surf Rodz and precision Six Shooter wheels specifically because of these defomed nylon baseplates.  

110% support buying @Nowind baseplates immediately.  

Good luck with the drop in January.

Oh no! I'm not disputing that. I was saying people choose channels and pneumatics to mitigate rougher terrain more so than smooth pavement. Those PVD's would most likely rattle apart on trails. The irony here is, the most common choices for trail riding can't handle the abuse either.

@MBS is there a reason we should wait on ordering stuff?  Some "on the horizon" teasers and possible timelines would get a lot of folks psyched (I am one of them)!

haha, mine doesn't get in (or very very hard on just 2 and alf rims). They took me from above, spoke to me like a kid who knows nothing for a simple question (the story of bearing ...).
I immediately gave up seeing the lack of understanding and the disdain/scorn from MBS team.
I have to get a manual press of 1000kg or more ... I try my best, but impossible (cold bearing, hot rims or vice versa ... hold and mallet etc.).

I will wait for an E-Toxx trucks and rims I guess :smile:

I think they are my favorite rims!

But I already ride Fivestar from years on 9" Primo and like you say and even more : light, looking fine, durable, cheaper and for 6.5, 7, 8 and 9" ! But I would like to change for the new Darth Vapor coming.. you know what I mean ;P

Yes, I got the fkn e-toxx MBS GD silent kit for my next eMTB. So I change for Rockstar2 to fit it during the time to make it compatible with the Fivestar ^^ (or the 9" superstar like by 3dservisas, but those are super heavy...).
So I can tell you now, but the difference is on the rims and how they old in place the tires against them... (hope to be clear enough). I notice nothing in the ride.

I really prefer 9" for offroad emtboarding.
And the Bergmeister for all terrain in the city :)

well @MBS it seems your injection molding process has a huge problem with weak weld lines. weld lines should not occur at positions with high mechanical strain. also is your mould ventilated?

i suggest to raise the mould temperature at cost of slower cooldown temp.

Ha.  Getting the other products in the launch finalized.  Still hoping for a launch by the end of today, or at least a live product page for you guys to order off.  Worst case, tomorrow.  Sorry for the hiccup.  The trucks are in stock and ready to ship.
