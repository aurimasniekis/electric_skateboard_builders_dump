So i got some 218mm trucks and 83mm wheels from Diyelectricskateboard and im having a little trouble with how the spacers are supposed to go. from what i understand the spacers go in between the bearings in the wheels, but when i put them on the trucks the axle sticks out way past the threads which makes in impossible to secure them, but when i put the spacer on the axle itself instead of in the wheels it seems perfect.. (but thats not how spacers go, right?) so what do i do??


spacer in wheel:

spacer on axle:

Do i just need more spacers?

yes,with a combination of the 4mm spacers and speed rings you should be able to get a good fit.. you should have some spacers on the axle before the wheel and spacers between the bearings, and speedrings inbetween...for example

itd go speed ring>spacer>speed ring>wheel with spacer between bearings>speed ring>nut...if you find you still have too much leftover axle add a speed ring or 2

Ahh ok, the order of how it all goes on was confusing the hell out of me.. im new to all this and i've been doing a ton of research, but researching how the wheels are assembled completely slipped my mind..

thanks man XD


.....Lol i thought they only sent me 4 spacers which is why i was having this problem, but i found the other 4 just now..  im retarded :sweat_smile:
