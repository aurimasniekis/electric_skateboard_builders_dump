I recently bought a Turnigy 6374-192kv that will attach to the enertion single motor mount PRO kit. In the future I wanted to go dual rear drive but my motor is to big in length so I am going to go in a diagonal configuration. Is this as good for hills as a dual rear drive or not? Should I get a smaller length motor?

IMO I prefer Dual Diagonal for a dual motor setup especially climbing hills and a city with potholes and cracks.

The reason why is simple. There is pull from both the front and rear of your board.

Occasionally, you may come across an uneven pavement. If you have traction on the front but none on the back. The front wheels will still pull you out of the rut and vice versa.

If your dual rear wheel setup get's stuck on the back. Your board will stop and you'll have to kick out to get out of it.

Although, this will only happen if you are trying to ride on uneven areas. This was actually a curb which I got stuck on.

Your board would be better with (2) 6374 192kv motors on a dual diagonal setup vs (2) 5055 motors on a dual rear.

However, your board will be heavier and will you use all the extra power? Most likely, not.

Both setups are great it's just preference. I prefer dual diagonal however when climbing hills.

I've never ridden DD (dual diagonal) only DR (dual rear)

But i would imagine when braking hard with DD the board would want to turn one way? Is it true?

I suppose it depends on how tight your trucks are.

It seems to depend on truck tightness and if it one belt is tighter than the other (which causes one belt to stop sooner and the other to lag). Not that much of a difference though IMO.

On a side note, I do like to turn the board diagonal a bit when braking. It seems to help braking to a complete stop (since I ride brakes a little less, helps braking at higher top speeds) and the sideways brake stance helps to prevent forward momentum and/or makes leaning back easier.

Benefits of the dual rear is you need less of a wheelbase. You don't have wire extensions for the second motor on the battery end. With dual rear you get more immediate torque. Dual rear you could pop the front easier. **The main downside for dual rear is the uneven traction scenario and the 50-55mm max motor size.**

Other then that dual rear would be the obvious winner.

I have made/ridden single, DD, and DR boards.
I have even ridden a DR uneven motor config (yeah that's right. weird hey)

the DD is easily the best config. it allows for 2 large motors to be fitted. acceleration is fantastic, smoothest of all.
Doesn't pull in any one way or the other, and brakes are crazy good. pulls up so fast. 
Hard carving grip is where DD really excels, there's no sliding out. (unexpectedly.. unless you want to ;) ) It is almost like AWD, but not quite..

Speaking of toque steering, when I was running one rear motor briefly it was a 5065 245kv and i didn't really notice a pull one way or the other. I usually keep my trucks tight and use venom's 83a double barrels, so that might have had a lot to do with it. When using the big 63's though, is it really that noticeable? and when in a dual diagonal config, wouldn't it still cancel itself out? I've pretty much committed myself to dual rear configs for builds until i can experiment on dual diagonals more thoroughly.

Usually if there is uneven pull on a dual diagonal it's usually due to uneven belt tension or actual setup of the drive train. I've usually always fixed that issue.

Uneven pull in one direction can be a small thing such as over tightness of the truck and/or uneven bushing.

I haven't had much fun with dual rear as much since I like dual diagonal that much more but soon. I will.

I don't think 63mm's would affect it in anyway. My first board was a Dual Diagonal 6374 SK3 but the board was just too heavy so I switched to 50mm's. Still awesome though.

your actually not correct @onloop. most common cars under certain circumstances only drive one wheel. they have a differential that sends the drive to the wheel with the least load. the difference is that they can send the drive to the other wheel in varied percentages depending or corners and loads. etc. (it alot more complicated than that but that's a simplified version)
only cars with LSD (limited slip differentials) drive 2 or more wheels. that's another story.

(edited to avoid misleading confusion)

Sorry you are wrong... a diff is not designed to drive just one OR the other wheel, it is capable of driving just one wheel - but it is not its purpose and it will rarely happen.... unless you prevent one wheel from rotating.

If it only drove one wheel you wouldn't need a diff at all! You would simple have a single drive vehicle. The diff was invented so that two wheel drive is possible.

It's designed to split the torque equally between the two wheels unless one wheel loses traction! Then the diff transmits more torque to the wheel with traction. However If both wheels have the same traction / load, which is 95% of a journey in your car, both wheels are being driven equally.....


An LSD also drives both wheels. Its just got some additional mechanisms (there are several types/methods) to alter how the torque is transferred in the diff. But in normal operation it splits the torque between both wheels.

I told you its a lot more complicated. I was trying to dumb it down. fact is if you drop the clutch you gonna do a single legger if you don't have an LSD.

Wether you dumbed it down or not your argument is flawed...cars are not one wheel drive (or diagonal drive), they simply have an ability, due to the diff, to transfer torque variably between the drive wheels... 

I think the real truth here is that a differential has the ability to drive one or both wheels.... but normally it drives both as load is equal across both.

Most common vehicles have 50% or more of the available wheels as drive wheels. And mostly it is either at the front or the back or both. Rarely if ever would it be diagonal.

I will probably never use single drive or diagonal drive on my eboards....
Because; 
- I actually don't like the additional weight at the front as I ride boards with kicks and I use the kick to pop-up over obstacles.

- I also don't like wires running everywhere. 

- and I also think that it would contribute to torque steering & braking (which I think is probably easy to counter by tilting the deck against it)

But when both wheels have an equal load on them, such as the road, they both are driven.

Cars are not one wheel drive!...

If they where one wheel drive why is there a diff at all? The motor could direct drive the wheel!

If you want to learn about the diff & how it works this is the best video ever made about it.... It's from 1940!

Not sure why everyone always assumes that the theory of an inside an outside difference in wheel speed even exists with skateboarding...Your board (on any traditional skate truck turns from the center at the kingpin. You can turn your truck as sharp or as little as you like, but both of your wheels will turn at the same exact speed. The reason a car needs a differential is because of the fact that the wheels don't turn at a single point in the center of the axle. They turn individually on spindles, creating 2 individual turn radius'.  

Also, because of this ^ it doesn't matter how you mount your motor or motors. There isn't going to be a pull to one side or the other. It's not possible.

Man.. sorry but I have to disagree with you. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

As long as the wheels are separated by an axle, and are rolling on two adjacent lines one wheel MUST spin faster than the other wheel at some point when making a turn.

However I think it is worth noting that on a skateboard this might not be noticeable or measurable, due to two things.
1. Most skateboard truck hangers are not very wide, so the wheels are fairly close together anyway... making the distance travelled by both wheels during a turn fairly similar.
2. When riding a skateboard rarely do we corner sharp enough to notice, most turning angles are very obtuse. Maybe if you where rolling around in a circle with a one meter radius you might notice some skidding.

**In terms of the Diagonal Drive Discussion, this is what I believe happens.**

I totally agree on the different wheel speed when turning. the inner wheel will always be slower than the outer wheel.

however I do not agree on your bottom diagram. in real world situations it simply doesn't happen. 

maybe if you try riding a DD you will change your mind.

Yeah I know... I can't really talk cause I have never ridden that way... But i have ridden single drive and it happens, DD is basically two single drives.

I think it would be more noticeable during braking, but like I said easy to counter by tilting the other way.

But YES this is just my theory... have not done real world test....


Someone with a DD should setup a test, load up the deck with a "dead" weight drive it off down the street at full speed then slam on the brakes and see if it tracks to one side. Of course as a rider you will counter it with tilting, but a dead weight cannot.

I can prove it. Keep in mind I'm talking and thinking about a skate truck. You are talking about a vehicle. Because the skate truck turns only from the center it acts like one wheel. Picture a truck that  holds one 10" wide wheel at either end of the board. When you lean both wheels turn in toward the side you're leaving to right? The board will turn in a circle. Now ask yourself this. Does the outside of that one wheel turn faster than the inside of it? It can't. It's impossible.

Its not impossible it actually happens.
the truck twist does change things a bit so yeah you cant compare a car to a skateboard... let's stop doing that.
but the inside wheel does always turn less that the outside.

I agree with @lowGuido in real world situations to a certain extent. 

Just so you know: I have never ridden Dual diag, or dual rear... only single drive on a couple different builds. 

I rode my first build for almost 6 months with the back left wheel always being the powered one. Back then, I'd swear that it wouldn't turn when you accelerate or brake, and that one wheel drive was fine. Then, when I got the new enertion motor mount, and put it on the back right(of a different board., I was genuinely shocked at how different it felt: not saying back right is the best, and back left sucks... I just got used to the feel of back right and switching threw me off. Of course I immediately switched it to the left after than... You just get used to it quickly, and automatically correct without thinking. Try switching your dual diag setup to the other side, and see how it feels- it'll be way different. 

also, as far as one wheel spinning faster than the other, @onloop and @lowGuido are correct. Tomorrow I will put a black dot on my skateboard wheels (an old pair I have on one of my normal boards), loosen the trucks, and show it turning slowly. starting with the dots in sync, and then, showing them going out of sync as it travels through a turn. 

Also, Onloop's diagram actually represents skate trucks- not cars

On paper, in diagrams related to automotive tech you are absolutely right. As soon as you introduce a kingpin none of it matters. Just because onloop drew skate trucks on the diagrams doesnt make it a skate diagram...

This concept applies no matter if we talk about cars or skateboards or anything else with wheels that need to turn in an arc.

It also does not matter how the steering system works, wether it pivots on a king ping or each wheels is turned on its own axis or tilts to turn... it really doesn't matter.

The fact of the matter is the ID of a turning arc/circle has a smaller circumference to the OD.

So even if you just had a one wheel vehicle. For example a monocycle & it had one really wide skateboard wheel of 30cm width. If you make that wheel turn any arc from just a few degrees through to 360 degrees the outside edge of the wheel has further distance to travel then the inside edge...

If you created a machine that spun this wheel in a  continuous circle (like a big clock with a wheel assembled onto the tip of the second hand) it would begin to wear out unevenly as one part of the wheel is being forced to travel across an area quicker OR slower then what it is actually rotating. 

The thinner the wheel the less it will wear out.

The only way to stop a wide wheel wearing out (if it was attached to the second hand of a clock) is to make the wheel a cone shape, with the outside edge having the greater circumference than the inner edge. This way the outside edge can travel a greater distance in the same time as the smaller inside edge without skidding.

In car racing on oval or circle tracks they call it "tyre stagger" for more info this article explains it. http://iracing.wikidot.com/components:tire-stagger

i have a small contribution. Math. I suck at it, but this is pretty basic.  The diameter of the outer wheel's circle is greater than the diameter of the inner wheel's circle making the total distance travelled greater, yet both wheels must spin for the same amount of time during a turn. So if you spin both wheels for a given amount of time, yet give one wheel a larger distance to travel, guess what has to happen? The one with the longer distance has to spin faster or it skids and drags on the pavement. 

But the difference is utterly minuscule and with separate drive motors on essentially separate ESCs (even dual ESCs are just two singles getting the same signal from the receiver)  then the outer motor will be allowed to spin faster as a result of them not being tied together yet still receiving roughly the same amount of juice. It won't spin faster because of awesome programming, it will just be allowed to because more pavement is running underneath it as a result of math and since its got the same juice as the inside motor, it can do less work to go that extra distance. 

but again, we're talking 8 to 10 foot turning radiuses here with a difference in circular diameter no more than 360 mm given a 180mm truck.  The difference in spin is negligible. 

If you want to get into some serious shit, try and have your ESC detect tilt and give the outer motor say 5% or 10% more juice. Might be possible with a VESC, i don't know.

I have some useful info. I am a qualified snowboard instructor and I have studied the theory of carving and in a toe side carve it is best to have your centre of gravity over your front toe, in a heel side carve you should shift your centre to your rear heel, this gives you a tighter and more controlled turn. 
 With that in mind the DD setup would benefit, as a goofy rider, I would put the front drive wheel under my front toe and the rear drive wheel under my rear heel. Therefore when I am turning, my centre of gravity is above the drive wheel. This would give better traction in turns and help you manage your tourque better. 
 On the other hand it's more wiring, plus I'm going to have less space under my deck for components.
Thoughts?

Hey @Moja. now that there is the first REALLY interesting thing posted in this thread!

as a natural rider I have my DD motors front right and rear left. (front toe, rear heel)
I am also an avid snowboarder. this would totally explain the superior carving action that I feel riding the DD setup.

now the real test would be if I was to ride a DD front left and rear right would it then feel weird?

I reckon it would feel real weird, you would probably experience wheel spin during carves as there will be very little weight over the drive wheel. I'm glad you hear that the theory works in practice on e-boards, how does it compare to a dual rear wheel drive setup? I'm going to be building my setup in a few weeks and I'm yet to decide which way to go.

To add my two cents to the argument I have to say I prefer Dual Rear. Now I understand all the mechanics and to be truthful there are both advantages and disadvantages to DD and DR. For me though I prefer the feel of DR and I think this is what it comes down to. Just as some run their trucks loose and some tight, some bomb hills while others carve the flats the setup of the board and how you like to feel the board will depend which you prefer.

My DR preference was because firstly I noticed the pull of diagonal being annoying ... not so much in drive but in braking and in my riding hard braking is a common need...and it bothered my most that it varied heelside to toeside then further would annoy because I tend to switch foot and I could never get it in my head that the torquing tendency under breaks would also be flipped because I was. Sure, this is a stupid set of circumstances but it just affected how much I enjoyed my rides. I liked riding a DD electric ... I loved riding a DR.

Why I like DR. I am a kid of the 80s with single kick boards and have an inherent reflex to lift the nose from time to time - DD made that harder especially on a pintail (and it's why I have a pintail not a snub). When I hit a bad spot on the road the DR misbehaved exactly how my brain expected whereas DD would surprise me sometimes with how the board wanted to snake it's way out. I didn't want wiring running up my board because I know I will scrape up the top or bottom at some point and I din't want to be making plasma and possibly frying an ESC if I did.

So I say DD and DR are both good but different strokes for different folks and I sit firmly in the DR camp.

@moja that makes perfect sense and i will definitively be considering this point when asking people about their riding style in order to come up with the best configuration for them. 

I'm also in the DR camp but i suspect my affinity for symmetry has more to do with it than actual experience since I have not actually ridden a DD setup before.

I have only ridden Singe drive and DR. I look forward to @roller loaning his DD out for a demo. Rental car antics may begin now! LOL

Here is what I have learned and tinkered with over my many years of racing and 4wheeling:
As far as the debate of different distances traveled by the inner and outer wheels and axels one only needs to drive a drag car with a spooled rear & race slicks to completely understand the forces at hand; those cars have locked differentials and any attempt of turning is countered with "I don't think so" from the car. So the discussions about different circles traveling different distances and the larger outer wheel having to be larger to travel the same number of revolutions to travel around a outer end of the circle are all accurate. Read em an weep if not back to math class for you non believers. No snake oil here just proven math theory.

Basically and "open differential" will transfer 50% of the available traction to each wheel. NOTICE I did not say power. IF traction is less on one wheel than the other anybody that has watched "My Cousin Vinny" knows a car such in the mud with open diff only turns one wheel, the one with the least traction. (path of least resistance)

Limited slip has a clutch pack to try to even out the power going to each wheel but depending on how tightly packed the clutches or how worn they are you will get some power to both wheels but not all and not necessarily all evenly.

Several versions of Locking differentials will transfer power to the wheel with the most traction and allow the faster spinning wheel (typically the outer wheel, if both have equal traction) to accelerate by disengaging the geared locker to allow it to advance which is the clicking sound often heard. if the powered wheel (typically inside wheel) slips both sides will lock to allow 100% of power to be applied to both wheels.

Lots of info available on google researching off roading setups or locking differentials.

SO all skateboard Single, DD, DR and 4 wheel drives I have seen to date are all essentially open differential drivetrain design transferring as much traction as the tires/wheels can to the ground. I have not seen one that has linked the drive wheels together yet. I cannot imagine it would be a smooth carving type design without the ability of the wheels to travel as different rates so they can maintain constant smooth continuous contact with the ground at all times.

Yet, if the dragster had locked spindles, and turned from a center point on its axle  (kingpin) it would be different. I keep trying to explain to people that you need to think of the wheels on one skate truck axle as on wheel. Because it turns from one point. Not two like a car with two spindles.
Do this if you can't grasp it. Take a skate truck with wheels on it and, with your hands, put it on the floor and roll it around. Now turn it. And roll in a circle and then try and tell me the wheels spin different speeds. One skate truck with two wheels= one wheel

When I turn the truck with wheels, one wheel runs forward and the other one turns backward, like you realised.

Obviously this wouldn't work if they were connected by an axle and no diff.

Now look at below diagram. Its a skateboard taking a turn.
Are the inner wheels on a smaller radius than the outer wheels ? Yes.
Can the inner wheels be spinning at the same rate as the outer wheels ? No.
Why ? Because within the same timeframe, the outer wheels need to cover a greater circumference than the inner wheels

Test done. Inner wheel definitely spins slower. So traction control on vesc fixes this then? Or does it do the opposite and tries to keep them spinning at the same speed?

According to Vedder's blog, traction control reduces the torque on the motor that spins faster than the slowest motor, proportional to their speed difference.
So the VESC on the outer wheel will give that wheel less torque than the one on the inner wheel.
But because the speed difference when turning is extremely small, the drop in torque will also be very small.
Now imagine your left wheel hitting an ice patch and slipping. Now the speed difference will be significant and so will the torque drop, thus counteracting that slipping.

Actually that is pretty much how the new Jeep with traction control works. It uses open differentials but takes signals from the the tone ring in the ABS system as a speed sensor and once it senses a difference between the left and right side it uses the brakes to slow down the faster wheel (usually the one with less traction) bring the pulses to within an acceptable tolerance essentially keeping the wheels spinning at close to the same speed. Electronic traction control/locking differential.

The motor's rotation on a dual drive works like a sensor because the rotating speed can be measured. Instead of the brakes being applied on a car the amount of current supplied to the motor is reduced creating the same traction control effect.
I believe this is correct according to what I have been reading.

I always find a nice open parking lot whenever I got a new car and also tested how it would stop slide and emergency stop. Tough explaining that to cops because we were usually having too much fun. Luckily I was always let go with a warning. Once I set up cones and took the wife to do "training" they actually commended me for learning how to do car control BUT told me to wrap it up. 
Wonder if I could put spikes in my board wheels and do winter cruizing?
Now a tracked E-board for winter would be a neat idea.

Actually I'm not a complete novice when it comes to this...

_"why doesn't that guy just tune the brakes down instead of buying more ESCs?"_

It's impossible to. As my videos show the ESCs in these boards are locked down by the manufacturers. They take an off the shelf RC car ESC, alter the acceleration curve to give it a very slow startup to avoid it shutting down/restarting, and then they lock it down so prevent anyone from altering this.

_"He has no real idea what he's doing ... He's just finding matching parts"_

Again, as my videos clearly explain, the ethos behind the modifications I show is indeed to find 'matching parts' because I target my videos towards people who:

1. Can't afford the expensive, higher end models, and,
2. Don't have much practical experience, therefore the modifications are kept as simple as possible, and to use stock parts as much as possible.
3. To show that these boards are 'almost there' and don't need a ton of mods, or esoteric parts, to make them a viable means of transport.

In short, I'm actually helping people get into the electric skate/longboard scene.

It's a shame some people think this should be belittled rather than recognised.

It's also a shame that this, my first post, has to be so negative.

@DocCircuit of the shelf RC car ESCs are programmable. in the same way that the acceleration curve has been modified so too can the breaking curve. I wasn't trying to be negative. simply pointing out a way to make your life easier.
to say its impossible is a bit defeatist. nothing is impossible.
all ESCs are controlled by a micro controller and by design micros are programmable
at worst you might have to reflash. (google ESC reflash) or as is the case with most just a simple programing card will do the job.

I repeat: this has been locked down.

_"simply pointing out a way to make your life easier."_

Additionally, the advice you've supplied does not 'make my life easier'.

_"to say its impossible is a bit defeatist. nothing is impossible."_

See answer above.

Also worth noting, in one sentence you say you are trying to make my life easier, in the next you are saying nothing is impossible and my approach is defeatist. I'm confused, should I try the path of least resistance or should I try the impossible? It can't be both.

_"or as is the case with most just a simple programing card will do the job."_

Not with this ESC. The manufacturers do indeed have bespoke software and specific settings to alter the ESC to cater for the demands of e-skateboards, but they are loath to send it to users (I've been in contact with them). So it's a bit pointless for me to tell people to ask the manufacturers for software and settings they are reluctant to supply.

And, as I also say in the videos, this particular ESC is a poor choice for e-boarding, it's so much better to replace the thing in it's entirety.

_"Then why take them down the paths of non-useable ESCs and just show them ones that will work?"_

It should be noted the only ones that don't work are:

1. The ESC that's included with the Chinese clone board. As I'm sure you'll appreciate that it's in EVERYONE'S interest to know if and why this isn't the best ESC.

2. Hobbyking marine ESC. Which is used by other e-boarders so again it's useful for people to know if and why this isn't the best ESC.

So that's two. Two ESCs, both used by other e-boarders, both not great, so why not share my experiences?

_"Dont get me wrong but they way you explain things just makes it seem you are just searching around unsure of what ESCs will work"_

Correct, that's the whole point. I'm trying different ESCs to find out the ones most suited for the task. I'm not sure why that's inappropriate. It seems to me I'm doing a service for other people by trying other ESCs and sharing my experiences, particularly with people new to the hobby, than all these new people waste their time. Indeed the amount of thanks I get is a reflection of this.

The best ones currently in the UK are the VESC and Alien's ESC.

There is no fault with my process. Trying different ESCs and sharing my experiences with them, and targeting this towards people new to the hobby should be lauded, not met with a couple of people trying to find fault where there is none.

Great differential video.

The outside  wheel has to turn faster than the inside wheel.  Here is a simple way to think about this debate is to take a ball (or weight) on a string and swing it around in a circle above your head. 
When the string is long and you are making big circles it has to go around much faster to complete a circle in the same time that it would if the circles were smaller and the string was shorter.

As for you Aussies, when your national hero, Dundee, would make a call. Same principal.  Think about it when you are calling your friends next time.

Feels the same, I have both types of boards. I actually prefer dual diag more due to the more even weight distribution of the board. Easier to carry around and makes it seem lighter than it actually is.

Theoretically, it should feel no different given you never lose traction, which doesn't happen for me.

One additional benefit is that you can more motor traction from braking AND accelerating. With dual rear, you lose a bit of traction braking since your weight shifts forward. Not that it's a problem for most people. The only time I can see it potentially being a problem is if you're very light or a child and you brake hard.

having said this... same side is one setup that not even I have tried.

@lowGuido I prefer having my motor toeside rear, I typically weight the ball of my foot so I lose traction if the motor is heelside. I still don't understand the logic of going heelside, it is a well known fact that we weight the balls of our feet when engaging in almost any aggressive sport. If you are weighting your heels then you have almost no balance.

I don't want to start a conversation about cars too so I'll keep it short but rwd tends to oversteer when accelerating when turning, fwd instead understeers. That's why it's more secure. There's less possibility of losing control while turning and accidentaly do a 180 or a 360 and thus is the good standard for most of the drivers that don't care about physics and weight transfer and traction but just want to drive ^^

sorry :) 

maybe we should open a topic on "other" category like "differences between fwd / rwd / diagonal drive on car vs skates"  ^^

After riding dual diagonal for a while i think i prefer heel rear. The reason for this is, while i do brace on my toe side while riding uphill, my weight is shifted backwards providing traction for my rear wheel. My toe-side bracing helps give traction to my front wheel, making up for the lower weight.

The real question is, do you ever lose traction in either scenario? The only time I ever lose traction is if I am at very low speed attempting to turn around and I end up lifting a wheel.

the roads around me can be a bit bumpy so sometimes my wheel slips. But i normally lose traction in the same scenario as you, I'm really excited about getting extra wide long axle calibers.

They're not out yet. Will be 200mm with extra long axles. You'll probably see it when it releases :) I was told in a couple months.

I've seen 5065's fit on a 180mm truck with space to spare. I think it should fit on 200mm, but not sure about 15mm belts. I'd be using 12mm's

Question for you because I see you everywhere on this forum and you know your shit. So I'm thinking of getting an ollinboards dual motor kit. It's a diagonal drive so does that mean I'll have to get two vesc' sand a battery with xt connections on both sides? I'm looking at the space cell pro 4 10s4p and it looks like it only has them on one side.

you'll need a parallel xt cable which you can make yourself or buy on ebay or some other hobby site. I use 2 XT-60 female paralled to 1 XT-60 male. Battery -> XT-60 -> dual Vescs.

You may also want to get extension phase wires for your front motor.

Just wanted to share my experience with dual diagnal as I found this thread while investigating the issue. I built an overpowered mini cruiser with dual diagnal carvon motors. The board definitely has issues pulliing to one side while accelerating and braking. Quick transitions from acceleration to braking puts you in to a speed wobble. Tightening the trucks helped some but it's still the most frightening and unpredictable board I've made this far. I'm going to move the set up to a longer board to see if it helps and report back. 

Thanks

Did you ever try this on a longer board?  I'm in the middle of building a board.  I originally bought a drop down deck thinking it would be great for stability, without thinking about the motor being in the way of the drop down part of the board.  Then I found some people reverse mounting, after I bought a different deck.. The motors I got wont fit side by side unless I get the torque boards 218mm trucks, and even then I'm not sure they will fit.  So I was playing around with the idea of using the non drop down deck, and mounting one motor towards the center, and another reverse mount, both on the rear wheels, then I thought about running them double diagonal.  I searched to see if anyone had done it and found this thread.  There has been a lot of discussion back and forth, and I'm thinking of just going with the double diagonal.  But then you are the only one who actually said it didn't perform good who had actually tried one.  Was wondering if board length made a big difference.

after you said that, I did a search because I was also curious whether it was skateboard related or something else.  Found a reddit post saying that he went for a eskate ride without a helmet and had multiple skull fractures.  Apparently one of the people commenting on the reddit post was going to his funeral.  It appears he normally wore a helmet and just decided not to that day..  I guess I'm going to be getting a helmet.  Hadn't really given it much consideration since I wasn't planning on going to fast, but I'm gonna get one now.  I wear one snowboarding, and thats snow...so over cement is a good idea..

amazing what some googling will get you.  lol  I'll have to look up that helmet, I've got a large head, only found one brand of snowboard helmet and one brand of hockey helmet that actually fit.  I'll check out berm though.  Haven't heard of them.  I have a old helmet I used back when I tried to grind and jump with rollerblades..lol

Really? I'm the complete opposite. Heel side turns my back foot (balls or heel) aren't even flat on the board and has very little weight on it. Most of my weight is on my front heel. Toe side turns my back foot heel is up and most of my weight is on the balls of my back foot. On a thinner setup my front heel and rear toes are hanging off the edge of the board.
