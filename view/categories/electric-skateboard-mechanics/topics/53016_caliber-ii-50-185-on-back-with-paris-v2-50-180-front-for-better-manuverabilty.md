Hi,

I am going to use Caliber II in the back of my board by thought about putting Paris V2 in the front since Caliber II seams to be quite rigid. I will use 90mm wheels and most likely Loaded Fattail deck.

What do you think guys? Does it make sense?

Lol, Calibers are **more responsive and turn instantly** versus Paris. Rake amount does not affect the turn radius. The only thing that affects turn radius is the baseplate degree. The higher the degree, the sharper the trucks can turn. I repeat **RAKE DOES NOT AFFECT TURN RADIUS.** If you want "better maneuverability", then get 165mm trucks.

Hanger length does not affect turn radius either.

It does change the amount of force needed for the same turn if I remember correctly

Yep. Precisely. If you want a more maneuverable truck that responding to you weight more easily, then get narrower hangers.
