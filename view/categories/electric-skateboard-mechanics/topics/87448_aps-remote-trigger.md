Hi,
I want to make trigger on my APS remote heavier (it's way too delicate), any ideas on how to do it?

Should be pretty easy to replace the spring inside with something stronger.

Maybe sugru if you mean the actual trigger itself, or you could try repeatedly dipping in epoxy

Yeah as @TowerCrisis said, changing the spring should do it
And if you're even lazier than that, maybe extend it a little before putting it in again, it should do the trick if you don't need a lot more
