Is there any saving this motor or should i just buy a new one? I had this coming I suppose; not enough motor clearance. ![P_20190109_200158|281x500](upload://6o9WcZOSRV6YN7Z00ENo6GGqRNc.jpeg)

You can get a new magnet and try epoxy it in, after that "battle harden" the whole thing.

But quite honestly, you're better off just buying a new motor, unless you want the challenge.

How long do you have the motor?
If it‚Äôs not too old motor that could be a warranty case and you could get a new bell. Or you can as @torqueboards if they can sell you a replacement bell. That‚Äôs definitely cheaper than to buy a new motor.
Like @brenternet said you could also break out the broken magnet and replace it with a new one and glue it in with green loctite. If you find a source for motor magnets than please let me know too üòÖ I had a lot of broken magnets in the last time üò¨üôà

6374 motor? Mine broke aswell and there is plenty of people having issues with the tb 6374. 
Don't know if they had a bad batch or something. 
Tons of videos on YouTube with this loose/broken magnets issue on these motors. ![20181227_114013|374x500](upload://3n5ZmJOvqQah80v1OnUuVxnoTjw.jpeg)

@Bjork3n its the 6374 :sweat_smile:  
@Andy87 I've had it for just shy of a month. To be fair its more my fault for not having enough clearance. I must have bashed it on my last ride.
@torqueboards do you sell spare bells? :thinking:

Not surprised üòÇ. Mine had not been bashed and it had only been used for 3 charge cycles. It's a common fault on these it seems.
Contact them and see if they can send you some spare magnets or the complete bell. 
I decided to ditch my tb motors on my build and use something more reliable.

I have spare magnets if you pay for shipping.  Also, I have a few cans (no shaft) available, $50 a piece.

I repaired a Turnigy SK3 6374 about 8 months ago with JB Weld and my son is still using it, he jumps off curbs and still going strong. I ended up buying a new one just incase it didnt work, so i just made mine into a dual with the new one i bought.

Did you just glue in the broken bit in place? Or a new magnet?

Edit: i might give this a shot before i go ordering a new one :slight_smile:

Edit2: i ordered some of that JB weld and glued the broken piece in place. I was itching to ride so I took it out after 7-8ish hours. Performs just as I'm used to.Thanks for that tip

I though @torqueboards was using some mechanical fastener in some motors. Anyone have a pic?  Can‚Äôt imagine it being done without having to  have wasted magnets and space. And even the little magnet holders almost all of us  use now cost a lot.  I imagine especially w curved magnets.  Would be more precise n smaller gap possible I‚Äôm also assuming. 

But how to get a broken magnet out without breaking the others.  Maybe some suuuper glue connecting it to something.

We have some spare magnets. Email us.

@SkyTheEpic - We have spare belts.

Are u doing mechanical magnet holding without glue on some of ur motors these days?

Mind if I ask if you are still using the motor with the broken Magent?
How is it holding?

Id also like to know if using jb weld is preferred over green loctite

@SkyTheEpic :cry:

@Hummie Yeah, pretty much they've all been without glue. However, next batch I am planning on adding epoxy around the motor can to fill in magnet gaps and seal in the magnets. I think overall it will be better and more durable. It's not too common someone actually replaces a magnet. We'll have a few motor cans with magnets if anyone wanted a spare motor can to swap out.

Hit me up as soon as those are available üôè
@torqueboards add epoxy between the magnets is worth gold. I did that by hand on all my motors which had issues.
Will be all motor sizes come with this in future?

@Andy87 - Yup, we've added additional front magnet support + epoxy on the inner motor can. We'll also have spare motor cans available also for replacements.

@torqueboards just to clearify in case somebody understood it like that, the motors I had troubles with haven‚Äôt been from you üòÖ
Alway good to see vendors recognizing problems/listen to feedback and also work on it to improve reliability and quality of there products üëçüëå
