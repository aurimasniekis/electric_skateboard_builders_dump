Hey. I make custom boards and have my own brand of trucks too. I wanted to know if the mounting bracket could be milled to fit my trucks (is this something you can do for me?). Or would they fit? What would you need to see to be able to tell me please?
Cheers

Send me some good pics of the hanger and I'll let you know! What are the dimensions of your truck?

They're almost the same. Minor mods for the bushing seating and better hanger reinforcement, but yes, very similar.

Good on yeah. Loved my old revenge trucks, fun with broken tabs/stops until the kingpin snapped on me. Would recommend you upgrade to a higher grade for this piece of the truck.
Good luck with the bracket.

Nuclear pickle trucks. The first things I notice are they are perfectly round and the three supports taper down nearly to the ends of the hanger. I haven't tried to mount my motor mount to round hangers because shapes are better to eliminate spinning/torquing. Not saying I couldn't do it, just not sure it would work well. A welded mount would be a better option.

Yeah Revenge are pretty awesome. Ill definitely take the kingpin into account thanks. I haven't had anything go wrong so far on me (Im 120KGs so can push them pretty hard). Let me know if you ever need a set. Id love to get a mounting bracket to fit them so I can make the ultimate causing/carving machine! Cheers.

Ok cool thanks. Id like to avoid welded at all costs. Perhaps the tapered supports could be used to prevent torquing?

The originators of that specific design were called nuclear pickle.
