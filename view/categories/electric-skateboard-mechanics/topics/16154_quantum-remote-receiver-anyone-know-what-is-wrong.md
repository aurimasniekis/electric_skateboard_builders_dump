I am having a problem with my transmiter and reciver I will plug it into a vesc and the throttle will not work the i pushed the ch3 button and the motor spun at full speed then when i stopped holding it down it came to a complete stop very fast, after about 10second it would turn off and would not do anything. I have a Quantum 2.4Ghz 3ch Pistol Grip Tx and Rx.

That is a quantum right? Those are not good for eboards, they are very unreliable. That could probably be your issue.

Ok that explains it I tried a transmitter and receiver from a hobby car and it worked fine the only problem was that it is big and heavy. What is the best remote in your opinion

Get a GT2B. It is by far one of the best options! Additionaly there are several mods to make it smaller like
- BadWolf V2
- baby buffalo
- mastercho
....

just search on the forum ;)
