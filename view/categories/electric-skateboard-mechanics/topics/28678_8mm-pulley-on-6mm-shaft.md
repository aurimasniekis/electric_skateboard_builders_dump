Does anyone know how I could mount a 8mm bored pulley on my 6mm NTM Prop-Drive V2?

You may be able to use a spacer in between. However its probably easier to just buy a new pulley off Ebay or something

i bought a bore reducer for a few bucks. going to give that a try and if not the next step will have to be finding a new pulley.
