Seeing as though your pulley has two set screws, you could grind two little flat spots on the shaft then tighten down the set screws with some loctite. 

That's how im doing mine.

I tightened them down without grinding and it seemed pretty solid. If I am to grind some spots, how should it look?

What do you mean how should it look? 

It will be two small flat spots where the set screws go

you will need to file some flats.
it will slip if you don't..
you only need a small hand file, it will take 3 mins.

Make sure to cover the motor holes with tapes or bags before using hand file / dremel to create the flat spot.
