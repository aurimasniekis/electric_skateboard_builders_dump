as the title says, my motor mount is hitting the ground on small potholes or even hitting the deck when i try to turn.

if you put motor under neath the deck, you need a truck riser else you get motor bite. your motor mount is exceptionally large, so you might want to have it mounted outward the deck. as for motor mount have low clearance, you want to get larger wheels.

I run my motors the same way and I run 6880 motors so they are rediculusly huge and hit the deck on both sides when turning so I used my Dremel tool and routed out a pocket where the motor was hitting the deck. You could also file down your mount a bit and round off that corner that's hitting without making much difference in strength looking at your mounts.

More risers or reverse mount. (Possibility both)
Bigger wheels can help a bit too.

Also, you should put washers on the wheel pulleys.
