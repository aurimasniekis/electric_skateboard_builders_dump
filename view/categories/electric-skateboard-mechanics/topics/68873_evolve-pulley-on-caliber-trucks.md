I was thinking of buying the evolve 32 tooth pulleys to go on my next build, but will the fit on caliber trucks?

it has a build-in bearing.. so you need wider axcles or other pulley..
you could diy your truck.. or buy it.. 
depends what you want with your costs.. normal caliber and diy is cheaper option ofcours

You need to cut off some of the hangers to extend the axle or buy the Caliber II-E Versions.

what do you mean wider axel...I'm using the standard torqueboards trucks, can I just use a grinder to grind down the hanger and can I pull out the bearing?

thanks man! I've been looking for a wheel pulley that doesn't cover the green core of the kegals or break the bank, and I think I've found it

Evolve pulleys are abec cores no? Metroboard pulleys also only cost 30 USD which is pretty cheap for what you get. But are you looking for kegal wheels or abec's?

Yeah they have multiple types of pulleys, they have the abec ones for their wheels, but they also have kegal push in ones

Edit: they are $30 US each

Honestly for the 20 bucks I'd just buy a jlabs pulley from bkb.

Definitely pricier but it's modular and would hopefully last longer lol plus support those local forum members!

~~No way, those are bolt-on pullies.  Don't ever use bolt-on when you can use insert pullies~~

edit oops, they're insert

Yeah those are definitely not bolt on. But they do use bolts that hold the inner hub connector to the pulley part.

Did you even look at the product page lol?

In case ya need more proof lol.

ok somewhat back on topic, I really want to use these evolve pulleys, could I drill out the inside of the pulley, to make it fit? And why the extra bearing?
```

```
No, you need to replace the 10mm bearing with a normal 8mm skate bearing and with TB trucks you need to cut a bit of the hanger off to allow for the extra width

Aren't they made of delrin or something?  Personally i don't like the plastic pulleys.  But then I'm old school and like big chunky lumps of metal but hell you pay for them though which is why all my wheel pulleys are bolt through.Theres just something so satisfying about spending an hour a wheel to balance them......:expressionless:

ok thanks man...I think I'll go with the bkb pulleys, or the torqueboards pulleys, now in retrospect it's kind of dumb to spend extra money and time just to be able to see the green cores on the kegals :joy:

Nah you're on the right track, don't go bolt through when these push ins are available now, its not just aesthetics which are affected, balancing out the bolts can be either really simple or a real pain in the ass depending on how lucky you are. Unbalanced bolts will lead to wobble which will ruin your belts at best. 

@JLabs version will work on your truck with the nut flipped.

As a torqueboards pulley user I'd easily go for the bkb version. Had a hell of a time installing them straight. Are you using just regular torqueboard caliber clones or the 218mm version?

Just the regular...I’ve used the TB trucks for over a year now, what are the original caliber trucks?

Well currently theres the caliber 2's made by the company and then a bunch of different "clone" trucks out there including the TBtrucks. But TB also makes an extended version which has an extended axle 218mm is what they call it. Either way this fits on all of them the caveat being if you don't have an extended axle you will probably need to flip the wheel nut or the thread wont engage on the nylon part of the locknut.

Not a huge deal but if you want the core of the wheel to be seen that means the pulley needs to be secured somewhere else using a bearing typically. This is why pretty much every eskate set of trucks uses an extended axle of some sort.

The Jlabs pulley seems to be the best of both worlds by using an extended bearing between the wheel and pulley to save precious axle space. Only downside i could think of is its another part to replace that is different from the rest, and it is harder to install than just a full bearing pulley. 

But in exchange offers interchangeable gearing and hub adapters if you ever need.
