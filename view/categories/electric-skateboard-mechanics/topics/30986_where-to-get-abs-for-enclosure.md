I buy 4' x 8' sheets in bulk from Paragon Plastics. They are local to me

Dammit those are super far from me. Do you know any other stores that might have material? I checked home depot, office max, OSH, Fry's, Ace Hardware but none of them seem to have ABS plastic sheets.

None of those places carry it...Try looking for a Tap Plastics near you. Or do a google search for ABS sheet

Walmart.com has ABS sheets. Gotta get them online cause they're not in store.
