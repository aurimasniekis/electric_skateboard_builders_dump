Hello! New member but I've been lurking for several months now. I'm sharing my design of a dual VESC enclosure with room for wiring/BLE/receiver, etc that I ended up not using. I printed it a few times but it ended up not fitting my deck very well. It'll work great for flat or mostly flat decks. Feel free to print, use, share, whatever.
