Following up on the mechanical side of the eMTB from my other post 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/26650-a123-battery-pack-with-parallel-series-switch-selector/2893

Taking advantage of The MBS Matrix II Pro truck which is lighter than the previous matrix truck and have a prismatic hanger.

the old ones were a nightmare to attach a motor mount to them, luckily this New Trucks are more friendly.
i designed a motor mount and have it machine in aluminium, i borrowed some ideas from the mount of @torqueboards and they are dimensioned to work with a 65T wheel pulley and a 15T motor pulley and a 85 T belt. this allow for the minimum distance from the pneumatic tire.

Some Photos

this is the closest the motor shaft can safely be to the wheels and be able to install the motor pulley.

with the mount it's a easier process to build a eMTB and give a much cleaner look to the board.

Under side and motor wires:

Now Just have to design a belt cover for preventing rocks to get in between the belt and pulley.

Great build. Really like the motor mount. Looks like it's modular with that ring... switch the ring out for different trucks.

Yes the mount is modular. Just need a different shape in the ring. 

So far I just have the MBS matrix truck.

Great build!!!!!!
I have a similar mountain board from MBS, I was thinking about giving some e-life to it,
but I couldn't  find any motor mount that could fit the purpose. 
Did u already take it the hills? how is it so far?

Board is really good, give around 18 miles range in a moderate speed, off road it's a beast.  If you have a MBS go for it ...

Hey Kaly. Great post by the way.   Working on mine now.   Would you be willing to share the drawing you made for your motor mount?  You can email me at the follow address (joshuapaulhaberer@gmail.com)   My buddy has a machine shop and wanted to make one..    Secondly what site did you use for the distance calculation?

the best option is to get the mounts from @idea great design and quality.
you will not get them at a better price even if you do it yourself ;-)

The latest version of the motor mounts for MBS Matrix II is probably not that bad :D

Hi, there are 5 of us here in Western Australia building up some boards.
We may end up choosing different motor mounts from each other, but this could be an order of upto 5 sets.
Do you still have motor mounts for MBS Matrix ii Pro? 63mm motor.
