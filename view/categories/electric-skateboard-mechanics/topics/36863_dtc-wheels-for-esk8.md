Hi, I am wondering, why noone is using DTC wheels for their ESK8?!
Especially the aluminium core looks great! Wouldn't it be possible to drill some wholes and connect a pulley to the core?

I would say they are small, largest being 75mm, is the primary reason.  Most of us typically don't go under 80mm because of clearance issues.  Ive personally never gone below 83mm.  I didn't see any really good pics so cant be sure but it doesn't look like there's enough room on the core the drill.

Next time you might want to link the topic of the thread so people know what your asking about.

They are 80mm Version as well. It is called DTC Concept. You can have different kinds of uretan.
So same as the popular Kegel.
