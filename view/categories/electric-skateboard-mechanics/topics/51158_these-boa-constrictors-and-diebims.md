so Jed Boards sent me these giant red wheels a while back and i never got to try them because i didn't have time to press myself a witchblade. They're too damned huge for my Scarlet, and I'm too busy to make myself anything. Well, Ru finally called it a life and I had to retire the deck and box, so i cut myself a witchblade as an emergency measure. Now i have the fat red wheels on there and the DieBieMS in there as well. 


Everything else is the same, i still have the 12S6P 25R pack, twin VESC-Xs, and the sensored 6355s. 

anywho, i have to say that so far they're fucking amazeballs.

I feel very very good on them at high speeds and in corners. They're just fat and soft and grippy.  On really rough pavement they can butter a little but its pretty predictable. They also damp a ton of vibration as you would expect from such a  hunk of thane. 

They're 100mm and i'm running them on a 16/32 pulley set up on my own sensored motors. Its really fast and the startup is smooth. Launch at that height and ratio isn't face peeling of course but it still takes off quickly and gives no fucks about hills. 

Also the DieBieMS is equally amazeballs and i'm enjoying that too. I feel like it improved my brakes somehow. Charging and balancing is definitely 100% better and the LED blinky feedback for various occasions is nice. Also i love the fact that i can use a momentary button with it, i'm about to start looking for a momentary angel eye.

So now i want to work that screen into the deck somehow.  

That's all, just wanted to share my thoughts on these items.

I messaged @longhairedboy in hopes he would add some 15 and 20mm pulley options to his shapeways shop.
 
https://www.shapeways.com/shops/long-haired-boy-fine-electric-skateboards

If not I'll probably make a model to print on shapeways myself.. but @torqueboards sells 12mm metal pulleys too if LHB nylons aren't your style

Apparently they have 15mm if you ask in the order notes.  Why they don't advertise this is beyond me.

@b264 @Deckoz We haven't added it yet to the website. I'll try to get them up soon. 12mm and 15mm for both ABEC/KEGEL are available.

12mm are too small for Popocas since the core is more in the middle. You can use our 15mm Kegels and it will be fine with Popocas.

If the BOAs are standard kegels they'll fit fine. If not, stick to the 15mm and you should be okay.

I have 9mm and 12mm KEGAL core pulleys in my shapeways shop. They fit Popocas, Kegals, Boas, and most likely even some of the Ahmyos which have a smaller kegal core. Those may be the way i finally get a These White style wheel on an electric without drilling, but that's another post. 

https://longhairedboy.com/pulleys

 I don't have 15mm or 20mm wheel pulleys because at the moment my drive system is still using 9mm belts, which is what i've been using this whole time. I would prefer to stay on 9mm belts than go with wider trucks, so i'm in the process of working with another vendor to get a 12mm drive system together that will work on standard 184mm calibers with those 6355 sensored motors. No details on that are available yet. 

12mm is likely the widest i will ever get. I have no desire to ever move past 184mm trucks, in fact if i could get dual rear on 160s i would do it, but i don't have mounts capable of folding space.

Most longboard wheel cores that most folks use for electric skateboards are all one of 2 core types -- either ABEC11 ("flywheel") cores or ones that are very similar, or Orangatang ("kegel") cores or ones that are very similar.  These two different options do not interchange pulleys because flywheel-style has an even number of spoke-like appendages and kegel-style has an odd number of spoke-like appendages

how old is your son? Put him into a montessori and that "tuition" will set you back financially.

When my daughter finally goes to public school I will be swimming in money (unless I lose my job)

While I agree with your reasons... It's only more money in your pocket as a non-stocked product until purchase as a model file for shapeways to print. 

Upto you bro...I know it would be a larger ask for people stocking metal pulleys, but for shapeways it just rests as a model file on shapeways until someone purchases, and you get a portion of the cut(I have a shapeways store too).

seriously the first thing i do when i quit my day job is devote 3 hours a day to Fusion 360 to learn how to get the parts i need myself. I just don't have the time because i'm swamped in business. 

its  a great problem to have but its still a problem lol
