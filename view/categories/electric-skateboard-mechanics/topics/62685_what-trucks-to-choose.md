1) What's the smallest sized truck (hanger<->hanger / axle<->axle) that has available motor mounts in the eskate market? I'm currently using a 9in caliber ii truck. Is there something smaller?

2) What's the best set of truck to use for drop through decks/builds?

1. What do you plan to do with your 9" Calibers? Cause I need a pair and motor mount to boot with it :beers:

2. Are you planning a Pantheon Ember build? Short TKP + Drop deck drop through?
