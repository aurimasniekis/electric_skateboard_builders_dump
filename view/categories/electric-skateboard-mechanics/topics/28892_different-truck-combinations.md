I was screwing around and put my original S10 trucks in front, carvon 2.5 in rear, so nice! The board is stable, but at slow speeds it carves around like a carve board, it gives my 52'' deck a nice tight turning radius. In the past, I had a rkp up front and tkp in rear, that seemed pretty sweet also. Anyone have any other oddball truck combinations that work?
