Thanks for the tag. Actually its a 40t 15mm, but I use them all the time on my 90mm wheels for extra torque. Also have the motor pulley that goes with it. Should be available in EU in two weeks

I'll probably make a new thread for EU customers, but I'll post on this thread when they arrive and link to the new thread. Should be 2 weeks depending on how long it takes to get through customs and @rwxr will be shipping

Would be best if you waited for EU thread. Want to make sure they get there safely. I sent over a bunch so there shouldn't be a shortage, at least for couple of weeks
