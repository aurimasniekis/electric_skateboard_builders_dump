Hey guys,
I have an order from Eskating.eu i am waiting on. It's been about 3 weeks and i have about another 3 to go as he is on break.
Wanting to get everything else in my build ready for when the order finally arrives.
I've  searched this forum and everywhere else i can think of but to no avail.
Anyone have the 530mm enclosure that can give me all the measurements? (really after the dimensions of the internal bottom face if nothing else) Need to make sure all my electronics will fit in this enclosure.

Thanks in advance!
