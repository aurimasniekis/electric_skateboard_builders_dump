Hey all. So it is my first build and I am building a single motor, outrunner setup. I am debating whether I should go with a more standard-ish 180mm truck or a wider 218mm. My setup will be: 10s3p batt, Vesc-X, 6374 190kv DIY motor, 16-36 gearing, 90mm wheels. Assuming I would be happy with the single motor setup, I could go with the more standard 180mm trucks. But, if I feel down the road I need more power, I could just add a second 6374 motor to the larger truck setup. That seems like the obvious and more future proof choice, but I am concerned about the difference in the ride between the two trucks. Total newbie to the riding world, so I default to your experience and expertise! By the way, both trucks are from . Links to both below. Thanks!

Don't just stick your toes in the pool. Dive in head first!
Get the 218mm trucks and build a dual 6374 6000watt monster!
And don't settle for a 10s3p, better get a 10s5p or 6p
And some 40T wheel pulleys on those 90mm wheels so you can lay down some serious rubber!
Hey, it's only money....

hahaha I like the way you think!! But, the rest of my foot will have to wait. Trying to save where I can lol.  Limited to 10s3p due to physical dimensions of the board. (It's gonna fold :hushed:)

I'm just having little fun with you.
I understand that you need to keep it reasonable.
If you do a 10s3p, don't use Samsung 25R's, use 30Qs they might be a bit more expensive but it will be well worth it.
Super wide trucks should give you better stability but will likely reduce your turning radius so keep that in mind.
Did you say your gonna make a folding board? If so, you might be better off just using a couple Lipos because even a 10s3p with 18650's  will be rather large unless you stack them tall and mount the battery on top or loose your ground clearance underneath.

What is the actual difference between the 25r's and the 30Q's? How much more are they? What is the downside of using the 25r's (since I prob will end up with them due to cost anyway)?

Lipo's are out of the question. I've used them for years on other RC things and know the pain in the ass they are when it comes to charging. Worth it to me to just be able to throw a standard wall charger in a back pack and go. 

My physical limits are 10" x 8" x 1.5". I found a 10s3p pack, from a builder on here, that measures 10" x 5" x 1", so it would be a pretty perfect fit.

218mm, it gives you more motor options, even if you don't go massive strait away. Even dual 5065 motors with 15mm belts wont fit on a standard truck. You want 15mm belts as they are much more reliable than narrower ones.

[/quote]

The 9mm belts on my dual drive are very reliable. Never broke a belt yet. 
15mm is a little extreme. I've seen it bend a motor plate when too tight. 
I think 12mm is s good medium and heavy enough.

go wider trucks, like @Namasaki mentioned it'll allow for upgrades in the future.

@torqueboards 218mm trucks are not much more expensive than conventional trucks anyway.  i suspect he's got limited supply so get em while they're available.

suppose only issue at the moment is the limited amount of mounts that are available for the new trucks, apparently their [dimensions are slightly larger than conventional caliber ii trucks](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wanted-longer-caliber-trucks/11906/210?u=thisguyhere).

Yea. I am leaning towards the 218mm trucks for the simple fact that they give me more options in the future. Just worried about the difference in ride, and the width making it less portable (which may defeat the purpose of a folding portable board), but, I still think it's worth it.

true, turning radius may be affected, but probably adjustable via bushings or how much you tighten them.

not sure what foldable deck you're using but i can't imagine it'll be good for high speed stability.  my stiff ass landyatchs deck does ok but only because trucks are tightened all to hell, which makes the turning radius as wide as a car.

Have almost identical setup with a single 6374 and 180mm trucks. Unless you really plan on adding a second 6374 no need to go bigger then 180mm. 

Single 6374 is pretty fast. Dual 6374 on just a normal deck you better be careful haha.

I agree with @Wolfcola - why go wider than you need?  If you want dual motors later you can do dual diagonal too.

Looking at the folding board - i don't think you'll be able to fold w/ motor attached...  

cool idea - look forward to seeing your build!

I'm not actually sure what I need. Never ridden one, so I won't really know what kind of performance I am going to get until it's done. From what I am reading, the single 6374 190kv motor SHOULD be enough. But, I would hate to build it, not be happy with it, and then have to buy two whole new, smaller motors, pulleys, gears etc...for a dual setup. Is diagonal mounting really ideal?

I probably won't be able to fold it all the way like it does without the motor(s) on it, but it will still be way more portable than if it didn't fold at all.

well, i run a single 6374 192kv...only reaason id be interested in going dual doesnt even have to do with not feeling like i have enough power, this thing has tons. I'm just worried about a worst case scenario and my motor fails downhill mid ride, i only have 1 motor to rely on. if i was running 2 motors and i snapped one belt, i would likely still be able to gently ride home and repair the damage without crashing at the bottom of the hill..
i know its extreme but its reason enough for me to want to invest in dual drive.

i had to just replace my 6374  earlier today because there was a bad rattle inside of it and i tried to open it up ended up stripping 2 of the can side screws and i stupidly tried to drill it out but drilled crooked and destroyed one thread all together and one of them is partially drilled and cant be opened. lesson learned.

Damn! That's unfortunate man. Thats a great point you make about losing your only motor and no longer having a break. Didn't think of that. How is your braking with the single 6374 by the way? Enough Stopping power? Enough power for reasonable hill climbs?

plenty of stopping power, and i have my vesc programmed in a really nice spot to where i can slam max brake on my board and not fly off, but it still comes to a nice stop. and im running 8s on my motor and get around 33km/hr uphill (dont know the % gradient but pretty decent hills), 36ish on flats, and 39 downhill...so not much power loss up hills at all.

Gotcha.  performance and "will it work for me" i think goes back to the main questions we ask when trying to help someone build their first board:

1. how heavy are you?
2. Hills? (where do you live, what kind of commute/ride do you expect).  hills are rated 10-20-30% - find your biggest hill locally and measure to let us know what's your biggest hill you want to ride up.
3. Range?  (use 10Wh = 1km very roughly.  let's you plan battery size for range you want).  Just realize a monster battery you haul around when you normally only ride 2-3 miles...  Heavy and expensive unless you just don't want to re-charge.
4. Budget?

I'm a big guy - 6'8"/2m and heavier than i've ever been 265/120kg.  I ride single motor setups regularly without issue.  My Marbel has a 50mm motor, GF's board i just upgraded to 6374 and love the additional power.  Totally doable unless you want to ride up big hills, and/or want to race off the line.  Dual motors give you no faster speed - but faster getting to the top speed, and riding up bigger hills.

Gearing is key.  I love big wheels (97's my favorite), and gear down as low as i can (love DIYes and @Titoxd10001's 40t wheel gears), with 14/15t motor gears on 8/10s usually.  Waiting for VESC 6 to try 12s (60k ERPM limit fixed). 

On her setup (just moved to Kegels w/ 36t 12mm) w/ 8s 8Ah lipo i can get a solid 10mi w/ moderate hills.  Might stretch to 12mi if i ride more conservatively (why?!).  I've not tried bigger hills, but eventually will.

I understand the dual vs single for redundancy - but just think it's a huge expense for that failure-proofing.  And most still run over canbus which can equal full failure of the master ESC fails anyway...  so not redundant and false confidence.  Instead don't' bomb hills where you need brakes - or brake early so you never go faster than you can bail from. 

old pilots and bold pilots...  ride within your means and be conservative to start is key IMO.  Wear protective gear appropriate for the speeds you intend to ride. /soapbox

GL and HTH!

Thanks for this man!

1) I'm 5'9" and about 155lbs
2)I live in NY. Mostly flat with a hill here and there. I would say 10 degree occasional grades with one or 2 20deg here and there. (rare)
3) The Batt pack I am looking at is a 10s3p Lio-Ion 37V 7.5AH. Pulley/Belt setup - 16T 36T with 12MM belt. - 90mm Wheels
4) Not looking to go cheap and then have to replace everything anyway, but of course trying to budget. Dual setup is pushing it over the edge for me.

I love power, but, Incredible acceleration is not a must. Reasonable is perfectly fine. As long as there is enough torque using the single 6374 for decent accel and hills, I'm happy.

Also a good point about redundancy not existing if one Vesc kills the other. But, if one belt goes, I guess there would still be some redundancy. Think I would be fine just being careful going down hills, like you said. 

So I guess 180mm trucks are looking like the way to go? They a better ride then the 218mm ya think?

I weigh 220lbs. 6'1. 10sp3 battery, 83mm but had 97 before and wasn't too much different. I like 83 way better. Range: 20-25km (never maxed out range). Speed ~35km/h which is pretty fast. If you do crazy downhill shit then maybe not fast for you. 15t 36t 265mm setup. I went up a pretty decent size hill the other day no problem. I have it built on a wolfshark. 

I thought the same getting dual 6374s but I actually couldn't imagine going that fast. If you really want duals I would go for 2 50mm size motors.

Great, now we have some details to help steer you.

At 155 and 10-20% i am positive a single will work for you.  I'm going to suggest a few tweaks to help w/ hills and keep it from being rocket speeds:

your setup (assuming 190kv motor):
90mm - 190kv - 10s - 16/36 = 31mph rocket

I would keep the bigger wheels (nice for rough roads), but gear down more:
90mm - 190kv - 10s - 14/40 = 25ish.  15/40 = 26ish.

You could go lower kv like 168/149kv 22/20mph respectively w/ 14/40 gearing.  add 2mph if you go 15/40.  and another 2mph if you go 36t vs 40.

I've yet to break a belt.  they are cheap - when well aligned and periodic inspection you replace when worn - you shouldn't have one break on you.  Riding in gravel - don't.  ;)  

I think the 180 or 218's both will work.  I'd stick with Caliber II's vs any clone, and most importantly dial in good bushings for your weight.  Makes a HUGE difference on ride quality (carving in particular) vs the cheapest bushings they send w/ stock trucks.  but i'm also not normal size/weight...  so my experience is especially poor w/ bushings intended for someone half my weight...

GL!

EDIT - besides cost savings - a single motor is a lot lighter!  My GF's 6355 setup was 14lbs.  Haven't re-weighed since went to 6374 and 12mm 36t aluminum kegel setup.  Previously 9mm belt w/ 3d printed wheel gear - fine for her 8mph top speed (not joking), but skipped like crazy braking when i rode.  I can still skip the belt hard braking w/ 12mm aluminum gear...  So a single i still recommend 15mm if you are going fast and need to stop!

Wow. Huge help. Thanks for breaking that all down for me. I think I am more confident that the single 6374 will give me the power/speed I would like and won't need to add an additional one in the future. So, I think maybe I will go with the 180mm trucks. Keep it more compact, and portable. Prob be easier to fit in a pack pack too. 

15mm pullys/belt huh? Ok, I'll look into that as well.

@Namasaki - me too!  Just some of the 190kv 6374 from Torque instead of APS.

@VerticalMedia - a good gearing calculator is a huge help when planning.  I usually target 25mph top speed as it's faster than i should go really, but love the 18-22 speed range for fun fast carving!  

On the gears - ping @Titoxd10001, and since you are using lbs/ft i'm guessing you are in the US?  $20 +s/h for a set w/ 15/40 iirc.  Great 15mm gears and especially at that price.  Hardest part will depend on figuring your belt length - depending on motor mount and your center to center axle distances (truck axle to motor axle).  

 [belt length calculator](http://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/).  Here's an example w/ a guesstimate CtC length (otherwise correct - metric - HTD5 - Wheel Gear teeth, motor gear teeth):

90mm wheels, and

According to @torqueboards, you should be able to fit 2 6374 motors side by side on the 218mm trucks. I am assuming 12mm on belt size, but I'm not sure. Could be 9mm. 15mm would be pretty sweet
