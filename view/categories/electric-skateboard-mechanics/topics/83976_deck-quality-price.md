I'm on my second longboard and I'm starting the electric conversion, but the nose is starting to delaminate next to the truck...how do you make sure a deck is quality?  (I've bought 2 completes for $70 from Target and $50 from Amazon and this happened to both). What is a reasonable price for a nice drop deck that will handle rain and abuse?

Also any recommendations for something under $100, something switchblade shaped?  Or is it reasonable to make one from scratch?

This has worked well for me. Barely any flex and very solid. It's pocket friendly too. If you search for "skateshred drop down" on this forum you'll find quite a few people using it.

Get a Landyachtz Evo or Switch 40. They are comfortable and tight. They are both reasonably priced at around 130. That's a minimum of what you can expect to pay for any decent deck.

Under $100 I would say skateshred or a deck on sale from Muirskate.

If you want real quality decks go for american wood. Pressed here in the USA. 

I have a deck like the Evo itâ€™s a drop down but custom artwork would put it around the $170 mark.

How well would the shreadskate hold up to being almost completely cored out?  The original plan for the Minority deck was to carve out a 25'x8' area (17' for batteries 12s4s 18650 and 8' for ESC/buck converter/Arduino/BMS/plugs) and maybe some steel rebar to stabilize it

Depending on the size of the veneer and the number of plays you should be able to route out some I wouldnâ€™t go super deep just so the board doesnâ€™t become flexy. You could also strengthen it by doing a carbon fiber or fiberglass layers

How much strength would a CF enclosure add if I use a lot of bolts?  Or do I need to wrap the deck for strength?

Would sheet steel be any good?  I've got enough for a whole deck and its not heavy

Assuming I don't short the electronics

Too many bolts actually weakens your deck. There is no such thing as an enclosure that will stiffen the deck, only a really strong enclosure that resists impact. If your relying on an enclosure to keep your deck rigid then you are gonna have a bad day. 

A layer of CF on the bottom of the deck, after the deck is routed, will vastly increase the strength of the deck, but you need a good deck to begin with. 9 layers at least and preferable hard rock maple or similar strength material.

If 3/4 of the deck gets routed out until the majority of the deck is half the original thickness would CF still make a difference?  The perimeter would be maybe 1.5" on each side after

Also a good idea. If you want something flexy get a Bustin, they are plentiful on the west coast. If you want rigid get an Arbor or Landy. If you want a deck specifically for esk8 get a Red Ember, buy be prepared to pay for the quality be patient. Also, hummindexk are pre-routed and have layers of CF and are very well priced.

That's an impossible question to answer. It requires that someone has done it using that specific deck. My guess is no as most decks are less than an inch thick, if you take 3/4 out you no longer have a deck but a very thin box. 

@irdesignes is right, get a hummie deck. Pair it with a @psychotiller arc v2 enclosure.

I don't have the pic anymore but someone here has a full aluminum deck with weight holes

I was thinking routing a slot for a thin bar of hard steel down each side and some aluminum plate from the trucks to the steel...it'll add some weight but it should be offset by the crater for the electronics...I think

Slight issue is it might just split the board into strips under stress

Check out GMR longboards. It is pretty damn cool and gets my wheels turning. Mentally that is. Pun unintended.

Yeah, it is an aluminum spine built into the board. Functions like a chassis, makes you wonder how you ever lived without it after riding one for awhile. The pro tucker is still considered a longboard but it is tailored for DH racing. There are some older models that are longer but you would have to find one second hand.

Second it, or rather 3rd or 4th it(as I see few others have suggested the same). If you plan to get a cheaper deck and hollow it out and then reinforce it, then be ready for more surprises. And it might end up costing more..

As Chaka said moonshine tucker pro will be the closest to what he has.. there is a cheaper model at 190 bucks..if you want cheap we'll get use to junk and be ready to replacing that board very often and watch how much you save .. your best bet is what @b264 suggest .. that is probably the cheapest nice looking deck never mind it's tallored to eskate..![Screenshot_20190212-003300|256x500](upload://flYzUrJrpgYqvD5izgjurwvH5qb.jpeg)

You could make your own deck from ply wood and route out the middle and then add fibreglass. It works Iâ€™ve done it, I havenâ€™t had a chance to test it yet though. 

Idk how long it will last but it was cheap enough that if it doesnâ€™t work it doesnâ€™t really matter

Itâ€™s a Paris baseplate and Chinese hanger I hacked up and drilled to fit a 12mm axle.

The reason for the bad hanger is I didnâ€™t wanna ruin a good Paris hanger. If all goes well with the rest of the dd Iâ€™ll get a cnc hanger/truck made up

And if all that goes well Iâ€™m thinking about selling some diy dd kits for builders to keep costs low. It should be good for those of us that like to make our own stuff rather than buying ðŸ™‚

I wouldnâ€™t suggest it. The way I see it, you will be strapping a lot of money worth of electronics on to a cheap piece of plywood and launching yourself at high speeds on very unforgiving roads. Plywood isnâ€™t made the same way true skate decks are. There is a lot of filler and subpar quality wood in plywood. A lot of times all the grain is going the same way.

With an actual deck, itâ€™s solud wood pressed to more solid wood. They alternate grain direction as well to help the board flex under stress with out breaking. 

Hit up @Hummie, buy one of his decks, donâ€™t waste anymore of your time!

Agreed. Spend the money and you wonâ€™t regret it.

After buying a blank deck for my first regular electric longboard, I broke it in a week just pushing over some railroad tracks. Imagine if I would have used a deck of that quality with 5000W of power on the rear trucks...

 I am sure most of the time blank decks are just fine, but it is not worth the quality control risk. Just go with Landyachtz. I donâ€™t think I have ever heard of a single quality control issue with any of their decks. Better safe than sorry.![image|375x500](upload://kK5cNTO2mEQ95FR1Ji9LTM4EWvz.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://bWRTeYjzpQ3A4KdWKztHz42v5xw.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://42HHEnYuLgapJprrgpOwIeS5dur.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://5IvLHXQ3mg2F7Eil3XdNJRHjaGF.jpeg)

Yeah fiberglass once hardened is very rigid.  I would use tri axel or bi axel to most it more rigid.  You will have to sand the deck so the the epoxy will adhere to the deck better.
