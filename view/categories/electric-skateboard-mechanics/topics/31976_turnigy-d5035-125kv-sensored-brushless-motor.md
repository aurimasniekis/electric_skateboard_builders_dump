I got one of these two weeks ago, the top end is a little lower than I'm used to, 
but the torque is freaking amazing.
I live in North Georgia, and it's not San Francisco hills,
but we have some good sized hills and this thing powers right up every one of them. 
I weigh 190lbs, and it never struggles. 

I really like it.

I have one. I have a couple of motors. 
This is my first sensored motor though.

I find most motors to be very punchy, like a dirt bike. 
This one has a smooth power band. 
The acceleration is very consistent even on a steep incline.  

It is a bit slow on the top end, absolutely. 

The orange color is very ugly, 
however, the motor appears very well made.   
It feels solid. 

It's new and It's only $90,  I wanted to try it.

There would be "fan" shaped ribs on the end of the can. Though every motor cools itself to some degree through rotation.

Hey that first uni-drive looks spectacular.
Honestly, dual drive is just a battery killer. Id stick to one big motor as long as acceleration isnt an issue. When you want to race cars at stop signs, you need DD.

for whatever reason they used stator size instead of can size, like the tacon bigfoot 160.
from the site, so this is really a 6355/6364 size motor in sk3 sizing.

Yeah the motor runs very smooth and a lot of torque!
First I had a 15T motorpulley -> 30kmh
Now I have a 20T motorpulley and I can go around 40kmh (fast enough for me)

Put about 15 miles on the motor so far. Very torquey, and much easier install process since there is already a detente drilled into the shaft (although I took the motor pulley off just now and that detente is starting to deform...)

Top speed is definitely nothing to write home about, but I ordered some 97mm flywheels that should let me get a few extra miles per hour out of the set up. 

One concern: I don't think the motor was doing this originally, but it looks like I can now pull the orange 'can' part of the motor out of the metallic silver front housing disc by about 2 mm. It kind of pops in and out with a bit of force. It will randomly do this to itself when on the motor mount. Does anyone else's exhibit this? This movement is in the same axis as the motor shaft.

I got the same with my motor!
In the package of the motor, there's like a copper cylinder piece which you can put on the motorshaft, I used that and now the motor can won't move.
![IMG_20180122_101443|320x230](upload://wrwI2QdjnqDVhVDrfR3aNEvMlom.jpg)
If I'm home I will try to make pictures of it.
You need to push on the backside of the motor so it slides into the motorhousing. Then put on the copper ring and your motorpulley. Now also push your pulley against thr copper ring so it won't be able to slide

It can run fine but if there's horizontal movement of the shaft it'll stress the bearings more and that can't be good

Question for people with this motor: it appears my vesc is no longer picking up the hall sensors from this motor. I was riding along normally and then, when trying to accelerate from a dead stop, the motor just would not respond to any throttle commands. at first i thought that maybe i had fried my vesc, but when I got home and started to run some diagnostics, it turns out that i was about to get it to run in sensorless mode (it was originally in hybrid). motor tuning in BLDC came up with a hall sensor detection failed result, but everything else looks normal.


there are no noticeable cuts in the sensor wire. anyone ever run into anything like this? any ideas as to what might have happened? i tried opening the motor up but wasn't able to.
```

Hall sensors may be dead. If you want to know try to power your Hall sensor wires with 3.3V on VCC and GND and measure the voltage on the 3 sense wires while spinning the can manually, if the voltage goes up and down on each one they're fine, if one of them is stuck in high or low that one is toast.

Planning on doing this tonight. Although I thought they run at 5v? I guess it shouldn't matter anyhow as long as I don't blow them with an excessive voltage...


Anyway, I am really hoping it is just the wire leads going into the motor. I have no idea why a hall sensor itself would fail. They are essentially solid state components, right? What could cause one to fail? It was 65F outside that day and I wasn't even doing any extreme riding or hill climbing, so I don't think heat would have been an issue... Really frustrating that they just died like that out of no where.

Anyway, I'll post back with the results of powered test later tonight.

You really should open the motor and check the continuity of the hall sensor wires. My bet is on the wire failure and not the sensors. Are they even silicone?
```

---
## \#42 Posted by: craj1031tx Posted at: 2018-01-29T22:05:23.501Z Reads: 143

No, they are not silicone wrapped. It's a relatively stiff plastic insulator. I can't be sure but I'm hoping what happened is the wire bundle got trapped between my motor mount and my housing during turns, and that crushing action eventually caused a disconnect inside of the cable harness somewhere. There is no serious damage to the outside harness bundle, but the individual wires in the bundle have some cheap stuff plastic insulation on them so I'm really hoping that it was that as it is relatively easy fix compared to opening the motor up.


There is threadlock on one of the screws in the motor, and it appears to be permanent thread lock. I really don't want to have to hit the thing with a blow torch for fear of completely destroying it. right now it at least works in sensorless mode.

Yuck, cheap plastic insulation :) I would replace the complete harness once you manage to get in.
You don't have to nuke it. Go easy, have someone heat it up for you slowly while you're trying to unscrew. It should loosen up.

Yep probably 5V but i'm not sure either and 3.3V is safe and they should work anyways.

A short or heat can kill these sensors.

I may be completely off here but I would do a search to see if your VESC can support sensored motors in FOC mode. I vaguely remember something about that not being a possibility.

But to answer your question, when the motor was new I was able to get it to work in sensored mode with a single 4.12 VESC (the hobbyking vesc) and man was it sweet. About 15 miles the sensor system crapped out. Not sure where the fault was: if it was the motor or the VESC. never bothered to fix it and I just ride it unsensored now. Still works well since it's so torque-y. I really do like this motor.

Hi , in your experience with the 5035 125kv... why did you switch to 192kv?

were you able to figure out that 125 rpm are really there at max speed?
I finished my first built , 8" wheels, 72 teeth - 14 teeth motor, unity, 2x 5S series 5A 40c zippy .
with my calculation i should get 33bla bla km/h  ( ok theory ) but was on full throttle and 28 kmh was max with 12 km distance on paved , on gravel it goes down to 10 km .
I ordered bigger motor sprockets now.  The power and smoothies is Fu ... awesome , but end speed I want more . 
can you reccoment the 192 kv ?
thanks

```

I know a lot more about skateboarding than I do about electric motors,
 honestly, it just felt a little slow to me. 

My reasoning for the 192kv was that it could generate 4000 watts of power, 
 that was the most I had seen on a motor, and being not so electrically inclined, 
I thought it would be easier to configure just one motor and speed controller.
I switched to the graupner 80 amp esc because the motor could pull 80 amps
 and the Vesc  at the time only output 50. 
I weigh 190lbs. and the 192kv SK3  with the graupner 80amp esc 
and  a 10s3p battery gives me all the power I need.

thanks, man . I just starting with esk building, started in october  to built .
the esk calculator is very helpful

I will switch to 16 teeth from 14. And riding this summer. New motors are not in my butchett right now .
Im 140 lbs , so im think Im good for now.
Are you feeling the 195kv have less torque than the 125kv?  probably with the higher Amps they have even more torque .
Whats your range?  so 3 packs of 10S ? and single drive train ? belt ?
the FOCBOX was not appealing to you ?
