Hey, so I'm planning on building my first eMtb soon, and I saw that I can get a barely used scrub Predator for very cheap locally. Now I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the trucks, I've read some conflicting information about the sizing (some saying it's 22x22 some 22x23).

I'm still thinking about designing a motor mount/direct drive with helical gears for this build, although I might also go for one of the ones being provided on here. 

(for the rest of the build I'm not sure about the vesc's and motor yet. But I was thinking about going for a 10s and some sk3's)

P.s. This is my first post so if I'm missing information or did something wrong feel free to point it out! ![Screenshot_20180807-221839|236x500](upload://1Rz0wIyZYklLp5jz8OUUFBeQWvH.jpg)![Screenshot_20180807-221825|236x500](upload://wIUc7gbOKu4guyM7jkCjTnB8Wkn.jpg)

the currently offered gear drives are not compatible with those trucks.
