Here's the one I just got, so I can test different setups and see what's really happening. I haven't gotten it mounted yet, but when I do, I'm going to try fabbing up a gopro (yi) mount in front of it so I can take some real time video logs of the meter.

The LCD is actually much brighter in real life.

Can anybody tell me what I'm missing here? I picked up two of these mini 3-wire voltage meters and hooked it up with the black wire connected between the battery and esc negative leads, and the red and yellow wires connected between the loop key and the esc on the positive side. The gauge works fine and reads fine when just connected to the battery or when connected to the loop key without the esc positive wire connected. As soon as I plug in the esc positive wire to the loop key, the screen goes almost blank, with kind of a faint flickering "0" appearing. Anybody else experience this?
