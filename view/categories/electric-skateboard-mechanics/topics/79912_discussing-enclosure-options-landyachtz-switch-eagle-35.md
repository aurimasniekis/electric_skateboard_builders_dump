As I'm beginning to gather my parts slowly, I'm reaching the point where I need to start thinking about dimensions for my enclosure and weigh my options against battery size and vesc choices. 

After doing some research, I can't find a single build with this deck. I had planned on printing something custom and reinforcing it possibly. 

Does anyone happen to know of any enclosures that are compatible?

I'd be interested to know if there are other decks that use the same mould. Some of my LY enclosures have fitted other decks well. Here's the LY Switchblade 36.

Hmm. I'll take a few pictures when I get home to compare. Looks similar for sure. I'd love to not have to make my own enclosure for this endeavor üòÇ I've printed enough

I have the mould so I can make them to order. 
Pop me a pm if you can with the measurements of the deck. From the top of the front "arch" to the rear one etc.Then I can compare in the morning.

Would you switchblade enclosure worth for my switchblade 40‚Äù? Have you been able to test fit that combo?

Pretty sure it wouldn't fit. I actually have this model. http://skateboards.rollercountry.com/skates/landyachtz-2012-switchblade-40-complete-longboard-skateboard/
So I could check.

If it fits the 40? I'd say 99 percent that it wouldn't in it's current form as the deck contour would be way off. If there was a little interest I could make one with some time.
