So I've been willing to build a battery enclosure for my board and would prefer carbon fiber over fiberglass if possible. Most people seem to use a vacum bag, but Id like to know if it's possible to go the wet-lay route? I think the guy in this video does it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF1weFm6wS4
Any ideas? Thanks for you help

i'll be doing the same today too.  it's easy.  fiberglass or carbon works the same.  I glued my cells to the board with pu rubber and will simply add carbon on top and done. just wet it out (get the carbon wet with resin) so it's fully  wet.  that's all there is to it.  too much resin is a mess and won't help strength.  Id use epoxy or pu resin.

for very smooth forms it works, for any edges it does not. there will be tons of air among the layups and the forms definition will suck. :neutral_face:

So you would do it with a vacum?

yes, always! at least when you are doing more than one layer. for one layer, glue one side, epoxy other would probably work halfway well. multiple layers with edges will drive you insane without a vacuum!

you can make a nice part without a vacuum.   you likely won't need to do layers if you use some thick carbon.  one ply biaxial heavy stuff.  I'll do it today and show you a pic

no mould.  i just stick lipo to deck and then epoxy and carbon on top.  or fiberglass would be good enough

Here's some carbon boards I made and if anyone is interested I'll sell u one.  But here's the cells after being stuck to the bottom of the board.  Need better wires and hardware store sucks.  And about to add a pic of the carbon I'll use. Actually can't find some good biaxial that's not scrap. This fabric on top I'll use but it's not as strong or easy to work w as the biaxial on the side u see

[quote="Hummie, post:2, topic:18595"]
Id use epoxy or pu resin.
[/quote]
I would just like to add something here. 
I have used both polyester and epoxy resin repairing fiberglass surfboards. 
What I have found is that POLY RESIN offers some flexibility in the mixing process but can be difficult to work with because it tends to gel quickly, so you have to work quickly. it also is somewhat brittle once cured and is more prone to cracking. 
EPOXY RESIN requires exact mixing ratio, 2:1 if my memory serves me. 2 parts resin to 1 part hardener. If you miss the ratio, it will not cure. If you mix in extra hardener, it will not cure. 
The advantages of Epoxy resin is that it gels slowly allowing much more working time. Also, it is much more flexible than poly resin when cured making it much more durable and less prone to cracking. 
I hope this info is helpful.

I meant polyurethane resin not polyester which it sounds like ur talking about. Pu I found works too but actually I haven't tested the strength much or read about it but with the pu theres a lot of versatility in cure time and hardness.  The best thing about the pu and the epoxy compared to the polyester resin is the smell!!  I hate that stuff.  It's cheap but I just found hawk epoxy, some new biz, and super cheap with good reviews. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/2/d2ee64232d4bc9dc2f9d65b137c0ae389298f543.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/5/85d544fc3db527b0b78cd2135e2d1faf40f622ce.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/2/62884c11e87202c61fe95ebbc2db6d9f17206ed9.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/6/e6e327478960e7a5a88f0e7a6ca35ceaeb586d9a.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

This is tap plastics 1:1 epoxy because it's easy. A rip off. It's still curing and I'm pressing  it into shape a bit.  Boneheadedly thought my mold release spray was tack adhesive spray so definately not going to be the best but it'll work.  Found my heavy bi-axial stuff. 
I've covered packs in carbon before and then velcroed them to the deck but the Velcro released and they dragged. That's their death. These will hold.  Used 80duro pu rubber

Your right, sorry, guess my memory is not so good after all. It's been a while since I've done any repairs myself.
I just take my boards to the local ding shop anymore.
I just don't get dings very often. But just a few weeks ago I was surfing PB point in San Diego sitting way outside but got caught inside on a big overhead set that broke my lease and took my board all the way to the rocky shore. Took me a while to swim in with waves crashing on me. Some guys pulled my board in off the rocks before it got destroyed but it still needed a lot of work.

that sounds very scary.  I got ahold of a super duper wet suit and was out there, floating, not moving at all, totally warm, and riding the waves sounds fantastic, but when I can't touch the bottom, and there aren't at least 20 other people nearby for a possible shark to chose from, I won't go.   I want the most over populated medium waves.

that's a huge enclosure.  how bout make it longer instead of so big.



what I made isn't beautiful mostly because the irregular shaping that the carbon follows as it was just laid on the batteries but it works for protecting and is surely as simple as it gets for making an enclosure.  this here is just glued down batteries and carbon and epoxy laid on top and done.

You need a vacuum!!

Without that, process will make you mad as hell, because corners will not stick. I recommend my style- I call it "GHETTO VACUUMING"! So items you need is:

1) Vacuum bag for cloth storage- they cost about 3-5$ it is strong bag with zip and hole for sucking out air (it has membrane inside, so air coming only out) . just choose right size of the bag.

2) Vacuum cleaner.

So that's it, I invented this for myself, didn't find this style anywhere :) And it works! First time when I heard word vacuum for carbon part making, the first thing that came in my mind was vacuum bags for cloth storage. My girlfriend is using them to save space in closet for winter clothes.

I made my enclosure and board as well with this style.

So process is:apply resin on your mold than apply cloth then again resin and so on. When you finish- just put your detail with mold in vacuum bag, press air out, close zip, connect to vacuum cleaner and suck out rest air, close hole with lid and wait 24h, and you done!! :wink:

One thing- outside of part what touches bag will have pressed out resin bumps in bag form, but you can sand it or probably you can use peel ply between part and bag. I heard that there is some kind of peel ply that sucks all not needed resin in, after you just peel that ply off and you end up with surface clean without deformation, but it will look like sanded, so not glossy. But I didn't try that because didn't know that peel ply exists!

This GHETTO VACUUMING works and it presses a hell out of that part in mold- So you end up with precise and stronger part due to compressing and less resin in your product!

One tip: Use resin as little as possible, just to soak the cloth!!! More resin you use- Uglier and Weaker part will be. When you mixing resin use same weight as cloth you are going to use.

So about 5$ you can get GHETTO VACUUMING system at home, isn't it great! And you can use that bag over and over again!!!!! :wink:

So photos, because maybe you won't believe me :) :<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/b/4b6f68f35409e895a5963be29ff68e52589800dc.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/f/bfc91920b017fadbb61fb5b6d1f5801da920f1d4.JPG" wid<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/1/d14c710e66cd3f80bdfdbc38f58b9ddecfdaa882.JPG" width="332" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/0/d0b96f0988a921e5a8fe0b4652c3dac7244dad43.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/c/0c2bd53ea66664d88cf62603a747194ae0ebaeff.JPG" width="332" height="500">th="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/9/398be78ffc623c51c689e681b15e0a94038dc143.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/5/5568adbe1606a63c38eb696eeb590be48898a63e.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/c/1cd7de7d624d99bf8bd40e2a5ccd0aae49766a82.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/4/24f644b4cacb2d1f15646cfd99f06203b80bf21a.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/3/c32962c7f5df9e6920cec44207daa77f8178f3fb.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/634c0800c136b985a2132778f09fd1268f16539e.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b9d41705fc680b49d76c6e839e60cdc4bb835329.JPG" width="332" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/5/c537c13fd302c8a20653a6bfc22ecb0908b61d3a.JPG" width="690" height="458"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/b/ab0ee8d772e5da1c756c52649752c0b49e9406a6.JPG" width="332" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/9/9944577670f43b0f519bda62b8816e76e7ee4d17.JPG" width="332" height="500">

why is it that the resin does not stick to the bag and "destoys" it this way? I would have thought that the hardened resin will cause the bag to be unusable afterwards.

@ninja This looks really good! Making me re-evaluate 3d printing an enclosure.

I have some questions :

* Does the bag stay 'stuck' to the resin, and is embedded on the outside of the tray ?
* Do you use anything to make sure it peels off the mold ?
* What kind of epoxy resin did you use ?

Bag stays and presses your cloth to mold all the time till it cures, but later you super easy peel bag off, it will not bond to resin:)

I use only mold wax on the mold, so only to get carbon part off mold, bag will never ever stick to rsin.

I use epoxy resin, i have 3 type at my local store 1)cheaper and 2)two times expensive one and 3)super clear finish,self leveling + UV resistant, so i used expensive one, because it more durable,clearer... better quality. After i took a carbon part out of mold- I sanded it and then applied that finish, self leveling  resin, sanded again applied again- so need to repeat that till everything is smooth in level. That other resin is not UV resistant so anyway i needed to protect my part from UV yellowing. Last step is buffering to get it super glossy and clear.

I have been "ghetto vacuuming" for years now. except I call it "vacuum bagging".
the plastic wont stick to carbon fibre it just peels off, although I never use the same bag twice. they develop leaks..

also I use a jar in between my bag and pump. so that you don't suck resin up and ruin your vacuum.

I used one bag for 6 times now, it looks like new, it is very thick! :wink: 

But of course it can be leaks as well, but even then just close holes with some tape and you are done :) 

Visually I watch if resin is coming close to sucking hole, for me it never gets close to it! It's very easy to see where resin is moving! I use vacuum cleaner only for 10 sec I guess, I take it off and rest job is doing by itself. Since there is vacuum, resin still slowly moves away by bag grooves, sometimes I help with my fingers to pull out more resin. As I press with fingers towards grooves I can see a lot of resin  mowing away from my carbon part.

I just want to say from all the great and cool things I've learned in this forum so far this Ghetto Vacuuming just blows my mind. I am new here and I'm just learning how to build my own board and here I was thinking I would need crazy expensive material to do some of those amazing looking carbon laminates. If you could make a proper guide with video or images and where to get these materials I would be in your debt. I know the epoxy material I can get local and should be easy to find. My question is which type of carbon cloth do I need and where to get such a thing.

If you made a tutorial for this I'm sure many members would hugely benefit from it :)

Use this for laminating http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/#!/resin-gel-silicone-adhesive/epoxy-resin/EL2-epoxy-laminating-resin.html , that you showed is for infusion.

And use this for coating http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/#!/resin-gel-silicone-adhesive/epoxy-resin/GlassCast-Clear-Epoxy-Surface-Coating-Resin.html

You don't need to buy hardener, because it is already added in tke kit :wink:
Buy these! You really don't need just 1kg of one kind of resin. One for laminating, other for coating. Both kits are 500g each. 1kg in total. For enclosure for laminating I've used about 120g resin+ coating( it depends how many layers it will be till its smooth. normally it should be 2 layers so 40-50g of coating resin would be for my enclosure, if I added 2 layers)

So with that 500g I can make 4 my enclosures with 4layers CF each. Use same weight resin as weight of your cloth.

Just make sure you choose slow hardener, because there is option of fast one. Fast will be to fast to work with, and I heard that slow harnerer also makes better results !!!!

Alright. Could I use the same laminating resin to make a carbon-only longboard? Then I'd buy a larger size. Thanks for your help.

You can make anything you like with it!

except if you want to cast something with it and then you'll need a resin that can be used thick

Anyone know where we can get the material in the US?

I've had great luck w/ good prices and quality material from eBay (surprisingly).  The seller i found that's been at a good price with reasonable shipping was [Elite Motoring](http://stores.ebay.com/elitemotoring/).  I have got their fabrics (CF/GF/etc., breather fabric, and membranes - vacuum film, release membrane, perforated, etc.), but haven't bought their "kit" since i have most of those already.

I like west systems (spendy), and have some total boat i'm going to try soon (much cheaper).

HTH - GL!

did you use any wax on the wood when laminating this?

Yes, 

I used mold wax :wink:

you can use any buffing or polishing wax.  Maybe paint it with pva release film too, but probably not necessary.

Tried my hand at ghetto bagging - the cheapo vacuum bags for clothing did not work too well. So I used a roarockit bag. 
It isn't big enough to fit my vanguard in as well so for my first attempt I laid the carbon out over my mold on a MDF sheet.
I used 1 sheet fibreglass and 2 sheets plain weave 200gsm carbon fibre
the epoxy I used is 105 206 west systems (slow hardener).
I used a meile vacuum cleaner to suck out the air and plugged the valve with some tacky tap.
There still seemed to be a very slight leak so I had to keep revisiting this, using the vacuum and plugging the valve again.
For science I clamped a piece of angle on one side.

I bought everything from ebay. The peel ply layer - exciting to remove to see the carbon underneath.....

not perfect but not discouraging. I don;t think I used enough epoxy.

Can see where the peel ply has removed epoxy  - the small dots - and large areas which look dry to me.
Also the plain weave did not conform to the mold all that well..... :frowning:

The angle straight edge was on the right hand side and definitely helped.

The mold will fit 2 banks of cells - just - I may make the next mold bigger.

Not perfect by any means but functional. I won't use this one - big learning curve - I thought I had plenty of epoxy on the sheets but thats not the case - the breather ply hardly had any in it at all. Was too worried about the wifes expensive vacuum cleaner!
Am waiting for some twill and will give it another try. Definitely need to vacuum with the mold on the board as the clearances are much too great from being set on a flat surface.

jebe, just stumbled across this thread. Your enclosure is looking good already. 

If you are worried about the vacuum cleaner, use a cheap wine bottle vacuum pump. Think the pressure you are able to achieve is even higher and it fits your valve perfectly fine. 
Apply the vacuum, then check again 15 min later, and again, ...
