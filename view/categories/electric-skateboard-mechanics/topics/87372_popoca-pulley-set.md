So I have a set of Popocas and a TB pulley kit.  The wheel pulleys seems to fit a bit too far into the wheel well. I think this is because they are center set versus offset but I'm not 100% on that. 

Can I get away with some washers on the pulley bolts or does that dig into the wheel too much? Anyone have a good set of pulleys that work with the Popocas?

It will work just fine like that but you wonâ€™t get as much belt onto the pulley. Your could do the other suggestions or get a belt one size smaller and it should work well
