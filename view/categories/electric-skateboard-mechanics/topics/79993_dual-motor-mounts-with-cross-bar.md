Looked at them and dismissed them because the cross bar is on the out side of the motor.  Adds protection but uses up more room if mounting them forwards so less room for battry and vesc etc. In my case

The LHB one is the UNIK mount but with the LHB logo instead - made by UNIK. Thatâ€™s a heavyweight endorsement right there.

I have the UNIK mount and itâ€™s solid af.

The whoosh! one looks cool too, and is reversible - which is maybe the one thing I would improve about the UNIK mount.

I'm out of stock, but they're basically @okp's Core mounts with some minor adjustments. I need to have some more made soon, just a matter of getting the cash together.

The UNIK ones are fantastic.  I don't think the standard crossbar fits if you run 15mm pulleys though

Iâ€™m waiting on some crossbars that will allow you to use 12mm belts on chopped calibers

yeah 15mm wont fit according to lhb, I asked awhile ago :slight_smile:

E: 12mm should fit with the current crossbars

Hi there !

I'm looking for mount  for a dual build as well. Need to check if I will be able to use the crossbar of marcmt88's dual mounts with 15mm pulleys.

Personally using the fixed mounts from Torqueboards, I love them, my only complaint with fixed mounts is that I had to put a riser to avoid deck bite against the mount.

I have the 123mm crossbar on e-calibers, 15mm belts, evolve wheel pulley, dual 6355 motors. I chopped the hanger though.

![image|375x500](upload://6jNSTZT19rgAFcvijdJV78PGiRL.jpeg) 

Iâ€™m gonna go out on a limb here and say I could have used the 113mm crossbar on standard calibers with my setup. Itâ€™s actually my plan if these trucks ever bend. 

There would be a couple mm between the motors, and I still have an extra couple mm of spare hanger on either side with the e-caliber trucks. So Iâ€™m thinking with 15mm hanger chopped off each side of the standard calibers you could fit dual 6354s (these are Flipsky), 15mm belts and boltless bearing style wheel pulleys.

Those motors aren't sensored. That setup will not work with my sensored motors, but without the space in the can required for sensors it works fine. 

I'm using the Caliber Es now with sensored motors on 12mm belts, need to order more mounts and crossbars for that specifically. At the moment i'm using them without crossbars, because once they're alined and on there the crossbars don't actually do anything but give me a place to put my name. During installation, however, they keep things perfectly aligned.

Youâ€™re 50% correct there. One motor is sensored, the other has faulty sensors ðŸ˜‚ flipsky is sending a replacement though.

They squeezed it all into that tiny 1mm protrusion at the end of the can... which is probably why they are 6354s as opposed to 6355s.
