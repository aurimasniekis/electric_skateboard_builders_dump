With the kind of power we have on DIY boards these days i believe that there should be a setup that works for large riders. I have been longboarding for many years but my push board has a lot of flex, i dont feel it would be safe to add all the required electronics. Im around 145kgs (320lbs) and I have most the parts sorted but im struggling to find a good strong deck. I have searched but its so hard to find consistent information about deck strength and layup from most manufactures.

What im looking for: 
 - I would like to use wide TB trucks so i can support dual 6374 (for the torque).
 - I would like the option to use larger wheels (thus larger pulleys/ratio) without getting wheel bite.
 - I am trying to find the stiffest deck possible.
 - I am trying to achieve a layout similar to the Evolve GT.

Im hoping someone might be able to offer deck recommendations.
**So what you big guys cruising on?**

320lbs?!?! I would definitely go carbon fiber for ZERO flex (https://www.hi5ber.com/), I am bias towards CF purely on aesthetics though, long rides are tough on your legs on full CF. I'm not sure what kind of flex your weight would have on something with a W concave. Maybe have a deck of your liking and add one layer of CF on the bottom to reduce flex.

I was going to suggest that too.  A fiberglass or carbon layer on the bottom will greatly reduce downward flex.  The only flex at that point would be from compression of wood and not tension of wood

Interesting. Those look like nice boards however they are a little on the pricey side. Also im in EU so you add +30$ for heavy duty, +45$ for international shipping, +VAT and import tax. :money_with_wings:

DIY Carbon Fiber. I have yet to do this myself, but this is the guide I plan to use.

I have a "heavy duty" hi5ber limelite and it is pretty solid, maybe over kill. I am no where near as heavy as you, you have a hundred pounds on me. I also have a 17 ply trampa holypro 35... 

The limelite is **_SOLID_**, I run it with some medium density 1/8 venom risers to soften it a touch and a combination of hardcore barrels and venom eliminators

with that said the trampa deck is seemingly **_un-breakable_**, I have never heard of anyone ever breaking one.

@frank has anyone ever broken one of your composite decks?

past that I'd look for downhill decks, I have a Arbor higherground (that has W) for a up-coming build that feels pretty good underfoot but I haven't ridden it yet.

Some of the bamboo composite boards like Rayne offer could be worth a look to, my Reaper feels like it is built solid.

the Deemonseed is just like my Reaper, just longer :smiling_imp:

a landy EVO would prob. work to, they weigh a ton and are built like tanks. Shit to push but...

17 ply? how thick is that? Im guessing that would require mountain board trucks? im not planning on going over any jumps or anything so maybe that could be a good option.

@Cobber with your Reaper do you know how many ply it is? does it flex at all?

the reaper, nemesis and demonseed all have bamboo sandwiched around a fiberglass core, Rayne rate them as stiff, but they rate there DH top mounts as even stiffer, "Speed Stiff" they call it.
They do have a reputation for not de-laminating though but that talks more of durability than strength.

Basically the faster a board is designed to go the stiffer it will be, always a exception but...

I'm on the bigger side now,started body building a few years back,currently bulking now so putting on a bit more weight for the winter! 
I run my dual setup on a landyachtz 9two5, so far so good,not alot of flex "which I like" and was around Â£100 I think for just the deck.

I'm 6'6" 300lbs I use a Raptor 1 deck that's carbon fiber, I have no doubt the Raptor 2 will hold me fine once it gets here and I made a diy single 6355 board that gets me over 20mph with a cheap Amazon deck I had I home called rimable and it has only a slight flex with my weight.

Any downhill board will be super stiff, I tried a Loaded tesseract at billabong and I loved it super stiff no flex i almost bought it but I'm trying not to spend all my money on skateboard stuff

Edit: I did try a friend's GTX and I honestly did not feel comfortable on it, it's way to flexy I never ended up putting my full weight on it because I honestly thought it would break. But most other boards are surprisingly sturdy.

[/quote]

it is the most layers of composite Trampa offer, I'd also look at the trucks with solid axels. You can set them up with thane or pneumatic tires, with or without bindings

all comes down to your Steez :sunglasses:

After some research it looks like there may be a few options:
 - Landyachyz Evo is11 ply (not sure about the shape tho).
 - Landyachyz Switch / Switchblade at 9 Ply maple with 2 layers of fibreglass.
 - Bustin Ibach may be avalable in 9 or 10 ply.

I also read that boards like the Switch and Ibach have concave that makes them stiffer for fewer laminations.

yeah and like Mikey was eluding to, **_W_** will help stiffen things up as well :wink:
and bamboo is often kind of stiffer (less likely to fail), but with less pop than maple but it depends some manufacturing specs.

Budget? Try custom longboard shops like:

https://www.subsonicskateboards.com/

I have a few decks from them. I got a Talon 37 with dual carbon fiber top and bottom with a nice orange tint. Weight is not an issue, but was expensive.

Here's where I purchased my 9two5 from for Â£100,the price might have gone up a bit,very quick delivery though in the uk/eu,and im tellin you man the 9two5 is a no flex zone!!
They also have the switch/switchblade.

Send @treenutter a PM.  I would guess he could make a deck with an extra ply or 2.  He's the guy that owns, operates and creates (with limited god like powers) Red Ember Boards.  I just say limited to keep his head from getting to big ðŸ˜€

Does 100kg+ qualify as a large guy?

I'm working on my build right now and with my weight of 105 kg I was also wondering what decks could work with me.

While everyone above seems to talk a lot about some expensive looking stuff I wanted to recommend some fair priced stuff.

Many of the recommendations were maple decks, and I just got mine today, they work brilliant with near no flex!

Obviously I'm not 145kg but I do recommend at least trying maple decks out from local board stores. My near board store actually allows people to test their decks and thats what I did (carefully though, making sure it won't break or anything) and turned out that maple decks seemed to be perfect for me.

[This is what I have if you were wondering.](http://www.skateshred.com/index.php/canadian-maple-wood-drop-through-blank-deck.html?SID=f6551cga19auvglkutq4q3o0p6)

I had noticed skateshred.com and skateblanks.com, they are very good at stating both weight limits and layup. They also offer a good variety of finishes.

According to their site many of their decks are rated to 320 or 350lbs. I am just unsure how much to trust these ratings from a brandless boardhouse.

Have a loock at Jet boards. They have multiple options in varius sizes. I would recomend the "jet vulcann kick 37'7" in the size wou would want. Used it as a freeride ride, was super solid. Concave is responsive yet comfortable enough for an esk8. Built my carvon board with it and honestly so far my favourite deck for esk8's out of the 20+ I own.

PLUS it is light on your wallet.

9 ply rock maple man. Nothing like it. Its been working in skate decks for heavy dudes since there have been skate decks and heavy dudes. I don't have any specific reccomendations but that's the general construction you'll probably want. The ones suggested above seem like good candidates.

On a semi related note i had my first e-skate experience today :grin:

Upon hearing that i was building a board one of my friends decided to finally give in and ordered a boosted board (something he wanted to do for a while). This arrived today so we decided to see how well it would handle a 150kg user. It was the Dual+ version and i thought id share my first impressions with you and any other big guys that may be reading this in the future.

1. The deck has FLEX. It was bouncier than my friend was expecting and i feared even getting on it (but he insisted). I ended up standing very close to the trucks (legs spread) but once i was on it was fine. This meant i didn't have as much turning authority as im used to but that is ok for a test ride.

2. It was very easy to get used to. Im used to boarding but i thought using the remote would have more of a learning curve, it was actually very simple.

3. Boosted say the dual+ is 2000W. Turns out that is a lot :smile:. I was only testing in a car park but i was actually surprised by how much torque it had. I was using the higher power modes and I did manage to get to full acceleration and full breaking a few times but i was probably going harder than i would expect to in daily use. had no issues with the belts slowing me down when i wanted them to. The thing that I was not expecting was how smooth and consistent the acceleration was. It seems to just keep accelerating when i kept my thumb forward. I definitely backed out before i felt like i had reached the end of what it had to give.

Unfortunately i did not get a chance to see how well it deals with me and hills. I think we might go and try this out in the future as i feel like i accelerated faster than i would going down a hill with gravity. This make me think it would get me back up the same hill. Not sure if the breaking is as powerful as the acceleration so would i get sufficient breaking to come back down the hill? i think were going to try and find out at a later date, i may try and video this if possible.

My take away from this:
- If you live in a flat area 2000W dual drive is probably enough for a beginner user of any weight.
- Boosted board deck is not suitable for large riders. You would need to either swap deck or reinforce some how. Dont know how the rest of the hardware would hold up to extended use but it looked good quality.
- I was concerned about using a normal belt gear ratio and had been looking at how i could achieve a higher ratio . . . with a 6374 i don't think this will be necessary. With a dual 6374 you would definitely not need anything higher than a standard ratio.
- IM HOOKED, GOTTA GET MY BOARD FINISHED

UPDATE:

I ended up buying a Trampa Ultimate Street Carver (thanks @Cobber). I went for the 16 ply deck with titanium axles and king pins. I also ended up also buying the 13/37 pulley set, belt and motor mount from trampa. It arrived yesterday. All fits together great and looks awsome.

Its Fucking Solid. Turns super easy and has a little flex but feels indestructible. I dont think i could ever break it and i feel like i could really throw it about without worrying about damaging it. I will try and get a video at some point showing the flex with all my weight for those who are curious.

I have temporary mounted the FOXBOX and some lipo's on top for testing.

Only running at 8s but its working great so far. Cant wait to get some bigger battery's and give it a real test :slight_smile:

Just need to work out some kind of enclosure for it all now.

I'm about 250 with back pack and gear. I went with the Evolve CGT because that was the only deck i felt safe on with the wide leg stance and the stiff deck. the electronics are.......well I plan to swap out all the electronics but I'm keeping the deck so now I'm looking at ways to fit a 12s7p battery on my deck with 6374s for the torque as well.
