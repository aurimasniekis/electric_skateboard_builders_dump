eBay is lacking mountainboard trucks in EU. I thin that EU is the defining factor

Oh sorry, I forgot.
Are you looking for longboard trucks for off road wheels? Is that understood correctly?

That is simply not true. It costs 133 euro from china. with everything as the same. Even with a doubling of the price (which could be shipping and customs and so on) its still over 30% cheaper

Well, I am trying to offer a cheaper and simpler alternative to get more people into the hobby... The hole pattern for the screws is the same as standard old school longboard trucks; 2.5" x 1.625". 
The hanger size is 42 cm, and the axles are 6cm (the kit includes 4 pneumatic wheels incl 2 pulleys). 

Unfortunatly it is not my design, but imported from China. 
I have made them make some changes to the design though. Ex the strenghtening motor mount cross bars. Without them, the motor mounts would bend and the motor pulleys would drag against the wheels and make the belts slip - that was not optimal :D 

I would recommend upgrading the motor wires to bigger gauge wires though, since they are pretty thin. You don't have to though... 
Besides that, I think the kit works great.

I don't unfortunatly. I may do that in the future though :slight_smile:
I dont't find them to be bad at all, but I am only about 75 kilos. You can tighten the springs to be harder though...
