Hi guys,

For my next build I am planning to do my own CNC machined trucks. My current build uses Caliber II trucks which I don't like so much. The narrow hanger and hence distance between wheels make me feel unsafe at higher speed. Over the past days I did a basic model of a CNC machined truck with hanger width of 230-250 mm. The thing is I am not an expert skater and I don't have proper knowledge what arrangement feels right. Going with the Caliber II truck design and extend bits here and there would be the safest option, however, I would like to have a little more compact truck since I would like to use a drop through deck + 7" wheels. 

I am particularly not sure about: 
- pivot size and shape
- pivot cup (off-the-shelf thing, maybe from Caliber II)
- axle (e.g. [Aera Titanium Axle](http://www.skateone.com/aera-trucks-titanium-axle-4mm))
- material (e.g. AL 7075?)
- kingpin location w.r.t. truck axle (inline or offset???)
- stability increase/decrease with longer/shorter distance between pivot and kingpin???

These axle stubs have a relatively short thread which worries me a bit!?

Lot's of things to decide and I am not an expert. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/5/45f10d0f68720e69af331b68bfd33aa20094c815.png" width="690" height="388">

Not a skater neither an Expert in this matter, but how do you Plan putting inside the aluminum the Rod that keeps your wheels? I mean, the Trucks in a regular Longobard are a composite , not just One big chunk, right?

Threads on either side of the truck. (Most) cast trucks do have an axle throughout the hanger but CNC trucks often use these axle stubs which will be screwed in.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/0/901700fd832dec0bd63afa59f2c89e107347d52c.png" width="690" height="388">

Nice post on the Aera axles. I didn't know they make these. You can do FEA on your trucks to know if what you make will work. The hangers made of 7075 aluminum is a good choice. Just for comparison, I have milled out a 10" width hanger, not including the axles, out of 2024-T3 aluminum. Works to my specification.

Thanks for your reply. I will run an FE analysis but this won't tell me whether the truck feels right or not. Let's see. Do you have a pic of you DIY truck?

I posted this a while back. I do get a wider turning radius because of my mistake, but this works well for stability. I used a grade 8 bolt as the axle.

How are you doing your motor mounts, because if your trucks are wider it would be really cool to put 2 sk3 6374 motors and get a lot of tork and speed, could I buy some trucks from you?

I haven't made a new mount for the milled truck yet. I only have it for the stock Caliber hangers. I have zero plans to sell any only because I prefer CNC and it's not a cheap process.

Modified the trucks a little but still have to do a proper FE analysis (currently static only). Made the hanger 240 mm wide which fits easily two 6384 motors. Motor mounts are just generic.

The mistake was the "10-inch truck" marketing term associated with selling longboard trucks. The thought kind of stuck with me that I made the hangers exactly 10 inches wide. The hanger was supposed to be 8 inches wide. Glad I made them wider.

Made some progress in the project development. 
Hanger and base material will be Al 6061-T6 and 17-4 PH (AISI 630) for the axle stubs.

Printed the hanger to have a feel how big it will be. Cross-section might be a little too large. Base plate will be custom made too. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/a/cacbfb20c55812284d5f1ff13a15965df98d6552.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Looks nice large. Light aluminum anyway.  Stronger .  why doesn't anyone add the mount to the truck? One piece machined or even cast?  Simplify and strengthen things. Less parts. Could look nice. Cast would be cheaper I guess and likely more diy-able.  Maybe ur into doing it but making the baseplate seems overkill.

Casting hanger w mount sounds fun.  Maybe. Lost wax casting. Or some kind of permenant mold and u could pop them out cast the axle in.  Seems a LOT easier.  Unless u have a mill or bucks.

I didn't include the mount, simply because it will require more raw material and it will take longer to machine the hanger. The truck parts will float under a different project name and I wanna keep it as stealth \ simple as possible. Cast would be cheaper but I have no idea where to start. Never cast anything and I wouldn't trust a DIY cast truck a single meter. It is already complicated enough to get the custom-made stepped axle stubs right.  

Putting all this research and effort into this project and not doing a matching baseplate would be just insane.

Still working on the layout of the truck as there were some issues with the previous design, mainly because the turn radius was restricted by the deck I am going to use for my next build. 

Here is a quick summary what I've ordered so far:

- Aera steel kingpin with tall KP nut
  https://www.sickboards.nl/en/nuts-and-bolts/12229-aera-steel-kingpin.html

- Loaded Orangatan nipples (purple)
  https://www.basementskate.com.au/loaded-nipples-medium-bushings/

I am not going to fabricate my own axle stubs, simply because the process would take ages. Instead, I will most likely purchase RONIN stubs with the extended thread.

Other than that I've already received the first parts from the shop:

I'm not sure what you mean by common thread? If you meant by how much this size and thread type is used depends on the application. If it's by location..., I'm from the US so we all use imperial threads unless your car is Japanese and you always lose the 10mm wrench or socket. Make sure to verify the thread pitch! There are also online charts for imperial and metric sizes which was how I figure out from the photo.

Sorry, I meant whether this is a common thread in the US. I do metric things and these fractional numbers confuse me a lot :wink: I measured the pitch with a caliper and it seems like to be a 3/8-16 thread. I know that there are online charts and I know how to measure things (not a noob)

Still in progress, however, mostly happy with it now. Changed a lot of things over the past months including baseplate angles, bushings, also tweaked the pivot, and of course the entire hanger. I am using the following components to set up the trucks

- Aera steel kingpin with tall nut
- Ronin precision axle stubs
- RipTide 96a Aera K3/K4 pivot tubes
- RipTide Krank Barrel 90a (back truck)
- RipTide Krank Barrel 87a (front truck)
- Insert bushing on both trucks
- Split angle 45deg (back), 52 deg (front) 
- Precision flat washers street and board side
- dished bushing seat
- axle width (tip to tip) 315 mm (close to Torqueboards 218 mm)
- Ride height: 63-65 mm
- Rake: 0 mm (maybe added in a later version)

Well done. Still gonna send me the CAD of the final design? Desperately in need of machining something. Is this still rakeless?


Also, there's a simple way to minimize the thickness of the adjustable baseplate.

![image|500x500](upload://grDHELGyaIHcy8kH2GKLUATVNg.jpeg)![IMG_4628|375x500](upload://hvw7DCHC9B9ds650EvDdbzK2jQb.JPG)![IMG_4629|375x500](upload://agTN6CXSC1G3JXDpnDBqxFKKVK4.JPG)

For the surfrodz indeesz adjustable baseplate, the kingpin threads directly into baseplate. There'a no need to use a locknut. This means the baseplate can be as thin as possible whilst giving a higher level of adjustability.


Oh, and next time get your kingpins from boltdepot.com
I got 8x grade-8 bolts for $10 including shipping.

These look pretty cool, interested to hear how they ride.

Have been looking a bit at truck design, the pivot pin on yours looks to be removable and barrel shaped where most others I have seen are domed on the end or some are even using more of a ball pivot. Not sure how that will change contact in the pivot cup.

Are the kingpin nuts just not done up in that pic or are they a bit short ?

Side note, what part of Aus are you in ?

Yes pivots are screwed and glued in. The idea was to remove that extra machining step, also, I wasn't 100% sure about the exact width which I adjusted on those screw in pivots to meet my requirements on the lathe. Barrel pivots are quite often used on CNC trucks, e.g. Aera uses them too. 

Kingpin nuts are just hand tight.

Well how do super expensive trucks handle ?

Do you have your mounts and everything done also ?

I'm guessing all the options were not available when you started the project but apart from the adjustable baseplate, what advantages do you think these yield vs say the TB218 or Haggy Kahua ?

Exactly, I started the project a while ago and nothing comparable was available. Compared to the TB218, they are wider and I have enough space to fit two 6384 with sturdy motor mounts, 15 mm belts and still have about 5 mm between the cans. Apart from that, they have a square profile, a dished bushing seat and as you said, an adjustable baseplate. Got my wheels yesterday, so no chance yet to try them out. Justifying the price, I do have only one board which I use for many years before I do any upgrades, so I was comfortable with the price.

Mounts and clamps are all custom made too.

Thanks! As a single run they were expensive, maybe price comes down if ordered in multiples. Additionally, to the machined parts there were a few other bits I got from a local machine shop *cough* for free, but then bushings, stubs, screws and pivots add up another fraction of the total cost. As said b4, the stubs are from RONIN. I am not sure how likely they will sell more sets? If I ever go back to the design this will be the fist thing that needs a change ....

Just came across your thread after finding these files on GrabCad. A couple engineers and myself were looking for a project to build here at work, and your design is awesome! I run our machine shop so I already started machining the pieces. I was curious about the axles. I can't seem to find them anywhere. Is there any reason why the other threaded stub axles wouldn't work? Aside from modifying the hanger slightly? I know the shouldered axles will be stronger, but I just can't seem to find them.

Also, I am more than happy to help you out when you need some other stuff machined in the future. Let's talk!

You can buy some axles off the shelf from other precision truck manufacturers,so I guess he skipped a step there and bought some axles from Ronin. You could get some from Aera, Valkyrie , Skoa, Buzzed

Yeah, I got the axle stubs from Ronin, after I figured that getting 17-4 PH material in Aus is challenging, cost intense + I had no clue where to go to heat treat the machined stubs. Bit of a pain since the Ronin stubs are imperial. If I would have had a simpler option + knowledge how to do the heat treatment, I would have gone the DIY route, … all metric of course. I even had technical drawings and tolerancing ready at that time.**
