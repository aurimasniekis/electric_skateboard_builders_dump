Hi,

I am looking any information about mountainboard trucks springs. I wrote some mountainboard sellers at ebay, www.atbshop.co.uk sellers too but they can`t answer me, what dimensions of springs are.
Could anyone help me who has mountainboard and could measure spring winding diameter, lenght and width? Also, what stiffness of springs should be in Niutons?
I am trying to make mountainboard trucks and I would like to make an order to my local spring manufacturer to make me springs.
