So, my 3d printer is haunted, broken and generally pissing me off.  Is there anyone out there that could print me x2 60 or 72 tooth pulleys for 15mm belts, preferably in ABS or Nylon?  I'm happy to pay for them.  Thanks for reading.

I canâ€™t print nylon or I would help you out. However, I am also interested in one.

@JLabs Here's the link.  Let me know the charge before you print them, not sure I can spend a ton on them.  Thanks

The Z axis, on the opposite side of the stepper motor, is moving up 1/4 inch whenever I home the printer.  The only way I can.print is to start the print then pause and manually turn the rod down until it's level then resume. It's got to be a hardware issue as it's exactly the same issue every time. I've defaulted and leveled at least 10 times.

Edit: not sure I have nylon but my other prints at 100% are rock solid, I canâ€™t break them if I tried

I'll take it ðŸ˜Š.  I usually ABS at 100% infill and I've never had a problem, so Im sure yours will be fine. I need x2 pulleys.  Wasn't sure if that was clear. Thanks

Iâ€™ll see if I can get them done Monday! You want to wait on your mounts to ship with (itâ€™ll probably be another week or two ðŸ˜¢) or I can probably ship them Monday if not Tuesday

I'd rather have these as soon as possible.  The mounts are for another project so can wait on them, I'd like to get this MBS done pretty quick.

ok i have been trying to find exact information on your printer but there is not much out there,

can you go in your setting on the machine and set or change the z Offset? if not they next easiest fix would be to update your start gcode to have the z axis start the 1/4 in, gap lower you have now.

Ok, I finally got it.to.print a small job successfully.  It's so out of level though, check the pic below...
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/f/ef557872705287b6bc135141ab655d62ab620307.jpg" width="375" height="500">

I moved the stop sensor for the Z axis (left side inside the upright, so you can see it) all the way down to give me some room to work with.  

I leveled it like I normally do, by using a price if heavy weight paper under the nozzle at each corner then moving the bed up or down until I feel friction.   The right side of the bed is all the way up, but the nozzle just barely touched the paper.  

I can find any offset settings.  The closest I can find is Configuration > Federate, it looks like this.

Any ideas?

hey it looks like you posted the same pic twice where you trying to send another pic? 

It looks like you may not be able to set the z offset on the printer, there are somethings i can think of doing. 

the first is raising the z endstop so it will end closer to the bed, if its at the top you can can figure out how to raise it more with a mod if you send pics i may be able to help

is you bed leveling a preset code that moves it to a few point that you check? or does it just bring the extruder to the bed and you push the head around to check points?

and is the bed leveling on the machine its self or a file you run from usb ?
