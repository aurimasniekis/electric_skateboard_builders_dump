Hello all,
i am going to order a sample of the 6374 330kv motor from may tech. i contacted them about odering with a keyway. they said that the minimum order quantity for motors with a keyway is 10. i don't want to order 10 motors so i was wondering does anyone know how to make a proper keyway. i will have accesses to a mill soon with the robotics season starting so i will most likely wait till then to make the cut. i will need the dimensions a keyway for a  10mm shaft. any advice will be appreciated. an alternative is ordering 10 units with the keyway already made. i have the money needed to buy them but would need you guys to tell me if you would be interested in purchasing one.

Thanks for your time, Hans

that's a really big, really fast motor.

I don't want to discourage you from learning how to modify your own motors shafts... but it's really not a good idea to do it on fully assembled motors.

if you want a 6374 motor you might consider buying this - available in qty of one! with keyway.

That is some super high KV!  A keyway is easy to do with a rotary tool and a cut-off disc. You want to be sure you seal the motor up before you do something like this.

if you have a mill. do it like this:

i don't even have keyways on the propdrive 270s on my 6S build. I just dremeled a flat spot for the grub screw to grab onto and that's it. never once had a slip. 

but keyways are better.

I've done the same thing with my solar build- used one of torqueboard's motor pulleys too, so it has two set screws.

Rookie-ish question: how hard is it to grind a flat spot on the shafts of these things for the screw? 

Anything else that would need to be done to them? I'm good with my current r-spec but I have so many spare parts now that I'm thinking of getting one of these guys for a potential second ride...

Easy.. It just needs a flat spot so the M4 bolts don't backout on rotation. Doesn't necessarily need to be 100% straight. At least my first motors aren't and they lasted well over thousands of miles and still solid.

Do you have to remove the shaft to do it? (to keep the metal shavings out of it?) or can it be taped? 

If removed, is that hard to do or hard to replace it back into the motor?

It is fairly easy to cut a keyway with a rotary tool and an abrasive wheel too.

You don't have to remove it you can just tape it off. You just need a flat spot where the bolt/set screw is. If you run it without a keyway use M4 bolts and not the set screws. I think it has better grip and less likely to back out.

A plastic bag, some tape, a steel flat hand file (or a grinder) and about 5 minutes of determination.

@siggs3000 I used a Dremel tool to create a keyway and a flat spot. I don't suggest trying to cut a keyway by hand. Just do a flat spot and an m4 bolt. I found my bench vice very useful to secure the motor. A gallon-size ziplock bag and some painter's tape protected the insides from metal shavings.

Oh, and eye protection is a must!

Who does it by hand? I tried it by hand.  No way was I going to finish it by hand. Maybe I had the wrong tool but even with a dremel, and tacon 160, it was like ten minutes probably a lot more.  It's a huge occurance for me. Preparing cleaning. Getting it done by someone on a mill or something better is nice.  It seems the weakest link in the drivetrain (other than the set screw, which mine is loctited and stripped). I really like the tacon160 but it's big drawback to rspec is not being Keywayd.
I've taken these completely apart regrettably as well as some turnigy 190kv motor. These have pressed bearing and very tight shaft the other not.
These are the greatest motors. Homage.

But I read maybe they are loud. The magnet fill was i forget but low at 71%. Maybe. Inefficient maybe? But it doesn't matter and they're beautiful and I've bought 6 I think.  One reason I bought six because it's so hard to find motor parts in this country.  No stators. Easier to cut them out of tacon. Rediculous.

It's not how you stir the pudding...It's definitely the tool. 
I just filed one the other day in 5. I could file all the way through it in 10.
Just buy good tools.

I'm laughing at myself though thinking about when I tried. Even with a dremel it looks bad and I question if it'll hold. Amazing how tiny keyways, especially the tiny one on the motor shaft, must take all the torque

i was able to grind notches in my NTM 270s with my dremel and a grinding wheel in about 10 minutes. 

also i would reccommend using a cutting wheel to grind in a ring-clip groove on the end of the shaft if there isn't one already. Losing a pulley in the street sucks. 

and @torqueboards is right about using bolts instead of set screws on your personal builds. Set screws may look cleaner and more "professional" or "factory" but i'll be damned if i'm going to ever be forced to extract another set screw from a pulley because the thread locker was doing its job too well and the screw head stripped. At least with bolts you can switch to pliers or channel locks if the head strips.

Good point @longhairedboy I used a set screw and I'm pretty sure I'll never be able to remove my motor pulley without some serious Dremel Tool destruction of one or more components. Thread locker really works! and when the screws are small and fragile, the thread locker wins!

Although I've had some successes using a heat gun to gently persuade the thread locker to release its grip.

a heat gun you say..... i have just the pulley to try that on. lol

previously i've had to drill them out. Try doing that without ruining the threads in the pulley.

not to mention the allen wrenches. If you're not using the absolute best ones, they start to strip too after a couple of these situations.

I use a torx driver and blow torch to remove loctited setscrews.. easy really.

the trick is to not strip the head off it first. once its stripped then its really difficult.

I just received my two Tacon Big Foot 160's in the mail. Super excited to use these monsters.  I want to make a keyway for both, but I'm scared I'm gonna screw it up. I don't have the know how to replace the shaft if I do screw it up. Are there any tutorials with video or pictures. I do own a dremel. I've had it since Christmas, but have yet to use it.

replacing the shaft is real easy. just take off the circlips, undo the grub screw in the back of the can and tap it out with a drift or dowl.
you may need to heat it just a little with a torch if its tight.

Hmm, that doesn't sound too difficult. I may just try it as a learning experience. Plus I bet it'll be easier to make the keyway with the shaft out.

they actually use a drill press in this video.. i just use a hammer and gently tap it out.

I received a few keyways from @torqueboards.  12mm and 8 mm keyways if I remember correctly.  Would making a 12mm keyway be fine or would combining the two to equate to 20mm which would cover the entire length of the pulley be necessary?

You don't need 20mm. It's better but not needed. One will do.

The tacon bearings and shaft are pressed in, which is nice. You don't need to take out the bearings to get the shaft out of course but the shaft is pressed in tightly. If I were u I'd leave it in and keyway it connected. Putting it back together without a press could screw it up

I got my hand stuck in the tacon once. Ouch.

@torqueboards I'm deciding if I should get the keyways done at a machine shop or do them myself with my dremel. Does the position of the keyway make a difference? Center of the shaft? Near the end? Near the beginning?

I'd estimate your paying at least.. $30-40 bucks. I'd suggest buying a new motor with a keyway and just use that one as spare and run it with just 2 flat spots.

I recently had the same problem and I just drilled a small cone at the right place that fits the cone tip of a grub screw perfectly! pretty easy to do with any drill press and extremely solid connection between pulley and shaft!
