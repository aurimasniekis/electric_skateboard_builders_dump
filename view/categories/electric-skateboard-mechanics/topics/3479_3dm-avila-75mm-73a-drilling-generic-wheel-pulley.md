hey there, today I tested these highly praised supersoft slalom/downhill wheels on my tesseract build and I LOVE them - they feel softer than my 90mm abec 75A AND more grippy than my 80A kegels ... and all that with a 75mm diameter, i.e. I get a lot closer to the ground AND I can remove all the silly risers again!!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4bbe76eb511b70b1d728932c5d9c660e357e5d4c.jpg" width="690" height="408">

now I wonder, if anyone has a good source of generic wheel pulleys, maybe even specialised pulleys for similar wheels. I was thinking about buying http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/eSkateboard-Pulley-für-Blank-Wheels-32T-oder-36T-für-15mm-Zahnriemen/p/64388596/category=15255001 but Im not sure if they extend out enough, because the distance bearing <-> outer wheel lip is pretty large (Ill measure tomorrow).

besides the pulley, I sort of expect that Ill need to drill holes. I have access to a drill press, but how do you perfectly center the pulley? what kind of drill is best to get through solid skateboard wheels? wood, metal, stone? would be nice to read the details before I screw up a great set of wheels! ;)

I'm in the same situation as you. Planning on drilling through solid wheels with a drill press but in the dark as to what kind of bit... Please keep me posted as to how your method worked!

theres a drill bit for almost every type of material known , metal , wood and plastic are easy . but for rubber and eurethane needs a hollowed cylindrical drill bit  . thin hollow tube with a sharp edge e.g. a hollow punch . i've seen it before . just not as commonly used .
just googled this and found eng.tips .   engineering tips ?

here , it is advised to put rubber into a fridge so as to partially freeze the rubber before drilling
...... well read the advise in it . i am no engineer nor am i good at english .

http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=181363


while here in this short video it is advised to use a dish washer liquid instead of usual cooling oil used in drilling metal . very useful info .


https://youtu.be/S9Webmd9Jvw



i watched a video before about a diy'er drilling 4 holes into a 90mm solid wheels with just a clamper to hold the wheel with the normal drill bit on a drill press . maybe his drill bit is new and very sharp , i guess . and it worked . made himself an electric longboard . just couldnt find the video . too bad i didnt marked it as "watch later" .

I drilled through my generic wheels. I just made a jig that lines up with the bearings and used my drill press with a normal drill

nice! I planned to use an existing pulley as jig since I probably wouldnt be able to space it precise and even. :confused:

 what do you mean with a "normal drill"? it looks like a metal drill bit, but not sure.

thought about maybe drilling a little bit into the wheel, just enough to sink the aliendrivesystem kegel pulley "horns" into the urethane:

... and then glue it with something really strong! anyone got experience with glueing?

Two part epoxy is usually pretty permanent. Just make sure you let it cure properly and don't put stress on it before its cured.

tried it now, 2component epoxy for polyurethane/aluminum. had the wheel in the freezer, but didnt make a real difference - while drilling it heated up right away. used some soap water too, it just evaporated quickly - bottom line: regular drilling like @Chris_KP :stuck_out_tongue:

the holes didnt look very beautiful, at least I didnt hurt the small inner core:

but the ADS kegel pulley fit in well:

finally the epoxy and its curing under some mild pressure now:

I dont have high hopes for this kind of pulley, but lets see what happens :slight_smile:

If the epoxy doesn't hold just bolt it to the wheel.

ye, the glue held up 500m, then I carried my board back home. :stuck_out_tongue:

I then drilled 3mm holes for the original ADS screws and made some sort of socket for wider washers with my colleagues router, so the screws had support by the inner small core and the steel part of the bearing:

[quick video of centered pulley and screws with wide washers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9liDg_dr0dc) 

overall my test drive was weird though, the drive wheel felt wobbly despite perfectly centered. my guess is, that 73A is really a little too soft for the constant torque of a 63mm motor - my holes also might have structurally impaired the wheel. additionally, my motor and carbon enclosure picked up a lot more stones and other debris, cause the board was a lot closer to the ground (i also removed my risers since I didnt have to be afraid of wheelbite anymore).

back to bread and butter 90mm abecs again for now :confused:

alienpowersystems were selling retainer rings - basically I used the current kegel hub of ADS. its worked well and rides like a dream - only problem is: the urethane is so soft and so thick, that the core with the bearings can bent within the urethane shell, so when I brake or accelerate hard, the whole wheel is pulled in that direction, cants a litte relative to the core/truck axle and the belt is going sideways for 3-4mm, ultimately touching the motor mount. nothing serious, but still a little annoying. i wanted to switch to 32T anyway, that will reduce the torque a little - just waiting for ads 15mm gear to arrive. anyway, enjoy the pictures ... this will is the grippiest and smoothes wheel Ive ever ridden! :blush:

since the pulley kept bending within the wheel too much, I never really used the avilas much at all. this weekend Ive been out a lot on my LDP board (no motor!), which I upgraded with a new bossa platform and 3dm avila 73A and I immediately fell in love again with these wheels. there is really NOTHING in the world that rides as smooth as these wheels! :heart_eyes:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/4/641679dd7fec0ebceafa222570076fbb2a31914c.jpg" width="690" height="488">

so I kept thinking about these super soft wheels and then I thought Id give it one last try and basically use epoxy resin and pot the pulley with the wheel. the idea behind it is: if I give the pulley a really strong bond to the whole surface of the wheel, it will probably take the torque much better and distribute it over a much larger surface without bending as much as before.

to get a strong bond, I took the wheel and roughed up the pulley side with really rough grit. also roughed up the APS pulley, tried to center it as good as possible. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/e/6ed3dde1338025bf5a98f4795a7f01437dfc38c9.jpg" width="566" height="500">

did the same with the retainer ring and the urethane between bearing and retainer, where the 5 screws start to pierce the urethane.

now the new idea is this pipe that you saw in both pictures: it has exactly 22mm diameter like a bearing. I covered most of it in clear tape and just left the small bearing width part free that goes into the wheel bearing seat!

once seated, it seals off the inner wheel core and I can pot pulley and tomorrow the retainer ring with epoxy resin and still get bearings into the wheels!

you can see the result of the pulley side already - its still fresh and I was generous with epoxy - really aiming for a strong bond of roughed pulley with roughed urethane on the inside and outside of the pulley. the 5 kegel pulley "Horns" are fully encased in epoxy now.

tomorrow Ill do the same thing on the retainer side, which will hopefully stabilize the whole thing enough to make this wheel really useable. big question mark for tomorrow is: will I get out the clear taped pipe? :sweat_smile:

it seems to work - done with one side and was able to pull out the pipe with a lot of force (clear tape was stripped right off). the tunnel is large enough to effortlessly insert a bearing, so im quite happy. the epoxy urethane aluminium mix really resisted the force without a sweat - a little surprised how good urethane bonds with epoxy.

the epoxy noticeably stiffed up that part of the wheel though, not sure if I basically just supported the wheel a little too much now so that the pulley is stable, but the plush is gone. if thats the case Ill remove some of the epoxy - its a material that has very low resistance to abrasion while urethane is the polar opposite in that regard.


filled up nearly the full wheel cone with epoxy - it feels a lot stiffer to the touch at that side of the wheel now:

the bearing epoxy tunnel from the pipe - looks a bit messy because of the clear tape leftovers which I havent removed yet. just checked if the bearing was able to go through and then went on working on the other side!

other side, same thing, however I didnt fill up the cone of the wheel much - most of the epoxy is now in the inner cone below the retainer to support retainer and screws better. I might remove the surface epoxy with some grinding, same with the other side. epoxy just gives up fast vs. sand paper while urethane is hardly affected at all.

curing in the oven as we speak to reduce the cure time a little :slight_smile:

i fiddled a little with granddads lathe (which I have no clue about, but I knew I cant do much harm on epoxy).

front side - removed all excess epoxy ontop/sides of the retainer:

removed a lot of epoxy from the pulley side too - I want plush at all costs!

added the pulley - ordered a 32T from APS already, since 36T will be too large for these small wheels. but for testing it should be fine!

Hi I was planning on buying these wheels but havent decided well enough and need a good explanation. My question is, which of these wheel is better on really rough rough slightly paved roads? I heard on the silverfish forums that the 73a avilas do great (costs 95.73$ to ship to my country) but I was also wondering since the height and urethane of the Kegels (costs 80$ shipped to my country) at 80mm is huge doesnt that also negate the bumpiness and rattles of the harsh road conditions? And also are the kegels faster as well? Looking forward for your input on this and thanks a lot for the reply. Cheers
