I'm looking at Trampa Superstar gearing options and came across a video on Youtube of BoardBumpers marrying up their AT gear (58T I think it is) with a Trampa Superstar hub on an Evolve GT of some kind.

So it would appear as though the cut outs marry up between the Superstar and Evolve AT gears, but I'm sure to make it work on Vertigo trucks the middle will need drilling/cutting out. 
The gear would also need holes drilled to permanently attach it to the hub since it was originally designed to receive a bearing to press fit up to the Evolve hubs

Anyone tried this?
Had a bit of a search but didn't find anything.
