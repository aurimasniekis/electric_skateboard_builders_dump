I'm building a mountain board with 2 SK3 motors. Since they are open motors and require airflow for cooling, I need to protect them from the elements while still getting good cooling.
I think i have a good idea about how to do it. But i would really like to see what you guys and gals are doing to protect them

Sorry im not able to link it, but I remember a vendor around here selling some sort of mesh screen that fits 63xx motors.... that one goes inside the can. 

This one:  https://pwrboards.com/collections/black-friday-deals/products/pwr-motor-case
 belongs on the outside

I think sharing your idea of how to protect them would be smart. People can then comment on wether its a good idea or not. :wink: 

Anyway, protection againts water isnt necessary, only the bearings can take damage (and sensors if you have them, sk3 doesnt). These can be replaced by ceramic ones, but I have never had problems with rusting motor bearings. 

Protecting against stones is usually done by inserting some sort of mesh where the motor is exposed.

If you want to protect against very fine debris youâ€™ll need to seal the motor completely. This will trap alot of heat inside the motor and is usually not recommended, as these motors get super hot (at least if you draw alot of power) even with airflow. They will get even hotter if sealed 100%.

Trampa offer the mesh with the frame for their motors they use

Something like [this](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motor-protection-enclosure-shield/10162) should be expanded upon. Its a shame the size of our trucks often means paper thin levels of seperations between motors.... no room for them to fit :(

Sure. I'll whip up a rough 3D drawing. My hand drawings are not very usefull :smile:

I was researching the same not too long ago, here is the post: 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sk3-motor-waterproofing/42540/34

The one @Sn4pz mentioned looks really nice too and seems to offer more protection as well. but sk3 motors are longer than 74mm, I don't know if it actually gonna fit.

Here is a rough sketch of what i have in mind.
1 motor per end driving 2 wheels and then covering with this.
The sketch obviously needs the fine mesh for the 2 vents and the mount holding the motor needs large ventilation holes.

Perhaps also add an 80mm fan blade for better airflow than the motor can provide

Are you going to replace the standard sk3 shaft, with a longer 8mm rod?
```

## \#12 Posted by: CCU Posted at: 2019-02-20T22:08:30.357Z Reads: 103

```
No. I'll just be using a rigid coupling for the 8mm shaft. No need to tear the motor apart. It will of course be keyed, so it won't slip.

How are you going to connect the coupler to the motor?

On one end I'm going to use the original shaft and on the other end I'm going to use the accessory that comes with the motor that adds a 10mm shaft on the backside

You could use a medium mesh strainer, cut it and shape it properly, just cover the motor to protect the magnets to get metal debris during the process. For a mountainboard you will need torque, I hope your motors a very low Kv rated (75 or less), and a ver high battery C discharge rate (60 or more). Motors need to be ventilated , I would not cover them, and I do not think you need to protect them from water (only the sensor and the wires maybe). Just my opinion...

everything else is under control.
I would just like to see how people have protected their motors, to see if anyone have a better or cooler looking solution.

75kv motors? With standard gearing that translates to ~18km/h...

Mines has a 3D cover with a spiral looking fan. So while the motors are spinning, the spiral fan shape helps with air flow.
Been riding through dirt and little rains with no problems. Literally just got home and rode through puddles ttoday

CCU "Here is a rough sketch of what i have in mind.

He needs a lot of torque to move this idea...better 18 km/h than not moving at all...I might be wrong...but big mountainboard wheels under this set up, I would go very low Kv...Chain, Gear drive, Belt....different story...

Our brushless outrunner can run in wet conditions as the phase wires are isolated by there own already.
Problems you usually get from the sensors inside.
Just open the can and cover the hall sensors and pcb with some of your girlfriends nail polish ðŸ˜…
Or epoxy and you good to go.

If you worry about stones etc getting on your motor, I think @MannyM0E solution is pretty good looking and effective

One thought on that idea.
You are aware that when you turn around corners on wheel will turn faster than the other?
If they connected on one axle iâ€˜m not sure if it wouldnâ€™t cause any problems in this situation.

@Santino Gearing for 18km/h is no point. You will most likely like to go faster sooner or later. You can gear it to 35km/h and still have it popping unintentional wheelies.  

@CCU One thing to remember when only using one motor/esc is that you have less power than on a dual setup, and your esc will need to deliver alot more current. The double if you want similar performance as a dual setup. Therefore you must make sure that you choose a controller that can deliver this. For example standard focbox without cooling is too little. Vesc6 might handle it, but you make sure that you find a way to cool your esc effectively, othervise it will get super hot.

If you geared it to 18km /h I'm pretty sure it would just be completely useless at anything BUT ripping your lawn up ðŸ¤·

Yes. I'm aware that the outside wheel would normaly want to turn faster. But since it will be drivin off-road, I don't foresee it as a problem.
Think about 4WD cars. When going off-road they lock there differentials.

I have 2 SK3 192kv 4000w motors. I don't think lack of power will be a problem. They will be run with 2 VESC 6 with ample cooling

So it will be 4wd? Power shouldnt be a issue then.

Yes. as mentioned earlier their will be 1 motor both front and back driving all 4 wheels.
The linking of 2 wheels is to try and get a little better power transfer without buying 2 additional motors and ESC's.
Though later it could easily be converted to having 4 motors, if I get hit really hard in the head.

I see, just didnt know you where doing 4wd. If you check out my build thread (still work in progress), you can see how I did it.
