Hi, I stumbled upon these gears:

https://www.ebay.com/itm/1-Module-Motor-Metal-Spur-Gear-50-20T-Width-10-Set-Kit-Ratio-5-2-Wheelbase-35mm/262682640209?hash=item3d291aff51:m:mn-FUMHpAVN6NDV3TbS-pVA

Wanted to ask, has anyone ever tried them? Looks like decent solution to make a gear drive.. Cover would be perfect, to minimize sound, perhaps and keep it lubed up..

@darkkevind since I think u messed with drive train, u know anyone who have used them before?

Drive ratio seems to be possible in 2:1, 2.5:1, 3:1 and 4:1 increments.. just needs to check for correct bore size, so it is not too small.

Sorry, I've not tried something like this I'm afraid.

Looked like a lot of extra material and machining. Probably be the last set of gears you would ever have to buy. A flywheel effect for sure.
