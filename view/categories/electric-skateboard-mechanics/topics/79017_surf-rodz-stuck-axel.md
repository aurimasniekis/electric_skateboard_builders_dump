Hey has this ever happened to anyone? I feel like I over tightened the axel and now it won’t come out. I had to use a socket wrench with a hex to loosen it up. It turns freely, even by hand, but it won’t back out no matter how much I turn it, I’m guessing that the threading got messed up? Any suggestions on what I can do to remove it without destroying anything?

It is likely fucked.

I did it to mine once and had to replace it.  Often times it is due to the grub screw maring the surface of the axle and locking it in.

Put it in the freezer for half an hour then put the hanger in a vice to remove the shoulder bolt.

I fucked a hanger up too. Took a few dozen attempts but got a free replacement after sending surfrodz emails.

then as you unscrew the bolt apply upward pressure on the bolt head with a lever of some sort.

This is essentially what happens.  

The grub screw mars the surface of the axle, the axle shoulder (non threaded section) gets stuck int he hanger, as you turn and turn the axle shreds the internal threads of the hanger.  You end up with a hanger that won't thread anymore.  

Pro Tip:  Don't use axle grub screws in Surf Rodz trucks, loctite only FTW.

I spoke to her about a week ago about the shorter king pin for the adjustable base plate. I wonder if they’re in this week. I’m trying to go down to Florida for a couple of days to get out of this weather up north

But also pretty hard to fuck up.  Most of the tine it is not the threads fucked up butbthe acle and/or the shaft

Helicoil in the adjustable base plate or in the hanger? I know there is one in the base plate but not aware of one inside the hanger

In my case, I was putting on a clamp and tightened down and the screw was just a hair yoo long.  When I tightened the axle, it hit this screw and slightly deforming it so it could come out and chewed up the hanger shaft.  Such a bitch to remove, but definitely my own fault.![15458368535873817596071379037576|281x500](upload://27fuP1VakNGnuPJNQOQimC2Weqc.jpeg) ![15458369325348263766887751723446|281x500](upload://a7y20CFPrC0xkJELcSvd536U5Xj.jpeg)

I also had the same thing or something similar happen where when I put my shoulder bolt/axle into the hanger I felt a little something almost catch and  try to in this thread it which I think it might have slightly. when I backed it out (luckily I was able to) there is a little piece inside hanging in the hanger that looked like a small piece of the helicoil or the grub screw ( remove before I started any of this) messed something up and it tried to miss thread my axle. I was able to get it out and still use it but wasnt super stoked that my axle is scarred up on the inside some now and a couple times I’ve taken out the axle to change things around I find parts of  Metal shavings will pour out. I wasn’t sure if it was worth hitting up SR on it or not but I had that happen on one side of each of my trucks I got from Black Friday… Should I contact them you guys think?

I would get some scotch Brite pad to clean up the bad spot the use loctite to keep it from moving.

Maybe someone should offer surfrod axles that are threaded at both ends instead of having to potentially mess up the hanger everytime you want to take the wheel off.

have u tried heating it up?  heat up the hangar so it expands away from the axle / shoulder bolt.  maybe event drip some lubricant in there.

i've been sanding down the shoulder bolt, something i learned from psycho, if there's any resistance inside the hangar.

haven't had any issues with stuck axles so far.

Yeah, I tried doing that but stopped because I didn’t want to melt the wheel, I’ll try again after I get something to eat
