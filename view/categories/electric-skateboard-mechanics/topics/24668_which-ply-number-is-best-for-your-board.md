Hey guys,

What do you think is the best Maple ply number for a deck? Looking for some flex with good rigity. I weigh around 160 lbs. Would a 7 ply board be the fit?

I weight the same and 8 ply is pretty stiff, 7 ply should be good for some flex.

Also big factor with flex depends highly on the material of the deck. Generally, maple is pretty stiff, bamboo is pretty flexy. Carbon fiber is stiff. Fiber glass can be both (depends on how you set it up and with what core you use.)
