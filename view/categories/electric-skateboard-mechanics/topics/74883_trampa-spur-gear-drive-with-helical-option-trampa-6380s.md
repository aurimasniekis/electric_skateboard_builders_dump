Beautiful work, @trampa; impeccably styled to fit the Trampa design language. We’ll be adding these for certain.

Just some weeks ago I said it is just a matter of time till trampa will come up with a gear drive too :see_no_evil:
Very sad @trampa that you chose this way instead of cooperate with some of our gear drive guys here :pensive:

I actually thought about that when I saw their picture, you did have it figured out already. 

I am slowly gathering info on the different offerings in MTB and MBS is nice but I don’t really like their decks

OK, I'll defend Trampa..a little bit.
Out of the 4 names you mentioned, there is only one original. At least when looking at gear drives.

Edit: Duffman and Jens work together.. So 3.

I'll quote myself from the past. .

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/e-toxx-webshop-online/45039/231?u=telnoi

I would have stocked the trampa shop with third-party hardware just to sell completes instead of trying to innovate at a similar or slower pace with a chance of pissing off the customer base

Let's talk about the design for a minute though.
A few suggestions maybe. 

Carbon side plate connected to the brushless motor will negatively impact the temperature of the motor, since carbon is not a great conductor. My e-toxx drive dumps a massive amount of heat from my motors, especially during summer. It's probably the reason my SK3 is still alive after 3000 km. 

Not sure about the alu fin. Seems like a good item to get yourself stuck with/low to the ground, will collide with stones and curbs constantly.

I am excited about the 6380 option.

Price for a dual helical drive is 495pound. Dollar to pound rate just got better for you guys. 

With regards to heat: More gearing less heat. There is big chunk of alloy next to the motor. This piece has quite a bit of surface area.   
We consider making an alloy shield but overheating motors have not been an issue in the past since there is a square relation between torque produced by the motor and losses that go into heat. This drive features 1:6 gearing! Your motors will run at low torque and high rpm. 

Copy debate: There are numerous gear drives out there. It's a technology that has been used for more than 3000years now. Google **Greek computer**. Even on this forum you will find countless examples of gear drives. Planetary, internal, external, open, closed, straight, helical, for MTB trucks, skate trucks, 90deg drives, with more gearing or less gearing, with two or 4 gears, single motor driving two wheels etc. 
If you would start a list, its going to be a longer one. Who built the first belt drive for skateboards btw? Are we all copycats when we design new belt drives? 
Things are moving forward and no one can expect that companies stand still to honour the guy who was the first to apply an existing technology to an existing piece of equipment. 
What we want is that companies ad their flavor to a known technology and improve things and re-interpret the known design to make it better. 
If this wouldn't be the case we would stand still and see no improvements in technology. 

A copy is an exact or nearly exact replication of something existing, looking identical to the user. The Trampa SGD has it's own design, it's been designed from ground up to go hand in hand with our equipment. It features a lot of new stuff that other designs don't have implemented yet. It's an enclosed gear drive, yes. That's about it. My son's toy RC car also features one of them. It even has a differential like many other RC and real world cars. 

CNC wheels: Have been around in Mountainboarding from the very start. 
Enthusiasts have made them in low quantities. 
Also in off road nordic skating and other applications you see CNC hubs. Racing cars have them, first superstar prototypes were CNCed btw. We still have a MTB with alloy Manhick hubs on. I think they were made back in 2003. 

There are some new designs on the way to us. They are not even close to any existing design. 
Surprise for Christmas....

I think it is great to see more drives from different vendors entering the market. 
I hope to see these drives in the wild next to others for comparison. 

Keep it coming. 

Now if some company would only start producing competition for the best vedder based esc’s out there and not then being called out for copying their design. That would be great.

True, gear transmission has been here in the forum already.

Look at this thread from elkick.
As he presents a finished gearbox Sep. 2016
Three days later, Etoxx posted its first gears
without housing.

Well I think many manufacturer has nothing against you making gear drives and etc things (more competition is better for community) but the way you are doing it is bad. 

Whenever is making custom boards or other products you close them down from obtaining base parts required for them and then you start making the same stuff they are making so in this way its not really cool... Please don't start talking about your stock or etc shit we all know whats happening. If that was the issue you could had provided a way to get those parts in bulk or etc (you not making them in china so its not hard to order a batch or etc of parts people need)

I got to agree with @Kug3lis  on this, I’ve have nothing against @trampa as a company, only have a big debt of  gratitude for allowing me to use their platform. 

On a personal level is satisfying to see YOU @trampa (Frank ) out in the open as the hypocrite you are :-) ,not because of the new product since that is ok and is **WELCOME** in the community, but because of all the lengthy headache you gave the community in the las 2 years with the copyright issue and BS about similar design to your products, but here you are eating your own words :poop:  :wink: 

@trampa 
Let me be the first to welcome you to the **DIY and builders community** in true essence and as one of US  where we all bring, share, bounce design and ideas from one another in order to advance  this wonderful movement forward. 

GLAD to see you inner PIRATE come out.

My advice is: Get inventive and design something that people can associate with your brand/identity.
If you copy a product you are not seen as the originator and that impression will stick to “your product” like chewing gum in hairs. It doesn’t work in your favor to sell a straight copy of someone elses achievements.

Ahh, yes. I see the alloy mounting plate now. Bit difficult to see from the render if the motor is directly mounted to carbon or not. Taken a look at the individual parts that can be ordered to get a better understanding of how its put together. A few advantages can be seen there over current gear drives, such as the bearing support for the motor axis. 

You're gearing for lower top speeds (max ~35 km/h) at 154 KV. Keeps the temp down, yes.
Personal preference is a gearing for 50 km/h at 149 KV.

The discussion is not really about who is first, but more related to a general attitude that has been observed. I will leave it at that as I am not personally involved in this and as others have stated, competition drives innovation, regardless of personal issues between vendors. 

Still...I can't help but draw parallels. The Jedi will find a way.

Your support is awesome. Your boards rock. There is no denying that you produce great quality hardware.

This sounds like vendors discussion, but what about clients around the world? I spent days within this site to understand that Trampa was my best choice, best solution for my needs...For sure I was dreaming with Jenso gears, or a complete Kaly, and and many other things...But there was Trampa, always struggling since the very first years, remember when I first write an email to them so long ago (several years), they said that I have to wait for months...By then I was much younger....Today, I could not being prouder from a company that struggle the way they did, and being an owner of their products, they shipped everything incredibly fast, and help make my youth dream come true...Is it DIY? yes they are, since to adjust, remove, re program, re assamble, re everything, you need to do it your self and learn...So all of you, Jenso, Kaly, Fatboy teach me something, and I appreciate that...I do not think people will stop buying from any of you, just target the right clients....thats all...I am one dreamer among millions....so target you market... All of you are well know from far away countries... Trampa is becoming the most advance and complete company of the segment, and they well deserve to be in that place...Just a client point of view...

A test would be most welcome. There aren't many people who can afford all drives, let alone who would be trusted with an unbiased view, good social media presence and the capacity to appreciate the differences.

Machining/CNC quality.
Design specific advantages (bearing locations, accuracy, maintenance). 
Ground clearance (big one for me). 
Accessoires (drive protection). 
Motor options and associated statistics.
Motor temperature. 
DB. 
Wheel/truck options (6-8 inch). 
MBS/Trampa/other. 
Price (that includes deck options). 
Convenience (installation)/machining required?

My main concern with any of these gear drives it that POM is a plastic very hard but a plastic none the less.  In my field of work I am constantly working on machines that steel or aluminum on plastic or plastic on plastic and have seen the plastic teeth wear down or strip all the time.  These direct gear drives systems will eventually do that especially as the motor heats up that plastic over and over again it will get brittle over time.

I will have to diagree. From personal experience, my 4wd etoxx gear drive with pom gears are holding up very well. I have put over a thousand miles on them and I have just completed my first grease change. The gears are remarkably clean with no signs of wear at all. I do not have close up images, but you can still see the machining marks upon close inspection. I used white lithium grease which was nearly perfectly white after clean up. I felt like I was throwing away perfectly good grease. There was a very slight grey tinge to it But barely noticeable. These were taken after most of the grease was removed. ![image|375x500](upload://w1lsvOgECay55Jm3uLOKGgPYepL.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://lV2e1HRpFdfoQT17SytKgzpTTtF.jpeg)

But why not POM on POM or steel on steel I see metal on plastic gears that have worn down at least once a week.  Now some of  these machines are ran 24/7 and some have harsh lab environments they are in but people live in different environments.  I live 3 blocks from the beach and you can see some of the paint on cars that has been effected by the ocean air.

Kugs beat me to it. There is much less stress on the large gear so POM is durable enough. Also we need to considering manufacturing capabilities. POM can be machined much easier and cheaper then steel can be.  Maybe after thousands and thousands of more miles my PoM will fail. At that point I’ll just buy a new drive gear :) no worse then regular maintenance on a car. I think I’ll easier get 10k miles before that happens.

Spring System:
Retainer Spring Retainer

Elastomer System:
Retainer Spring Retainer

Elastomer Springs are industry standard parts, just like bearings or screws or steel springs or anything else you can buy at industry suppliers. They were invented a long long time ago and are used in all sort of applications. 
There is not much design involved. It's a cylindrical element with radius x and height y.

Duffman was the first to apply this existing part to spring trucks using the existing retainer-spring-retainer method. He uses the springs for quite a while now and they seam to work for him and others. 

Same like belt drives, someone was the first to apply them to skateboards and now many people and companies use them. Existing technology applied to existing equipment again.
There is hardly any design work involved. 

This is not the end of the journey. Different elastomer springs want to be developed, different materials tested, etc. Things will move on.

Yet for a decade you didn’t think of applying this “existing technology” to your product until shortly after @Nowind and @Duffman brought it out.

You got the idea from them, and you wonder why people are now looking for other solutions where they were previously happy to use yours @trampa.

I’m just a lowly user of your tech, calling it as I see it. Happy with what I’ve bought, but not happy with how things are going ethics wise.

What happened to the rule with vendor bashing? @anorak234 @mmaner

The way I see it people are coming in to flame trampa for coming out with a product that exists elsewhere, derailing the thread that should be discussing their gear drives. 

You don't see the same in torqueboards direct drive thread for "copying" carvon. Its just trampa hate at this point. Whatever trampa decided in not selling to kaly/jens, thats between customer and vendor and should be resolved privately, no? Am I wrong?

You are never just a lowly user, my friend, and as others have stated before me: when businesses compete, consumers benefit. 

I’m sure the makers you’ve mentioned here would be very happy to see your loyalty in your continued patronage. 

Keep buying their stuff, become an ambassador for them, help them drive their sales on YouTube with your reviews and edutainment content.  

Maybe you know someone at a retailer that can place advance orders with them, so they can build up a list of stockiest for their gear drive inventory, so they can hire employees and produce marketing content and take the actual, real business risks that Frank and Ted have with their own money. 

That’s business, and to succeed at business they’ll need your full support. 

Posting here accomplished nothing. Yet again, I am confident they appreciate your goodwill. I’m sure they’d appreciate orders more though :slight_smile:

Back to mechanics, thank you.

I haven't read the thread, I do t typically read trampa threads, and you are the only person to date to make the claim that it's vendor bashing. Can't make an adjustment without knowing. 

I'm out if town and will be for a few days, so I'll have to let one of the other mods handle it. 

Personally, it's irritating to be accused of failing in my responsibility when I didn't know the issue existed. Maybe ease up on the accusations and not get your feelings hurt so easily. This is litterally a community of thousands if skaters, who are typically know for being the most sensitive folks.

FWIW I don’t see the @trampa SGD as a copy of existing gear drives, only so many ways to skin a cat. There are sufficient differences that make it unique enough IMHO.

They definitely didn’t go for the smallest size though, and I especially like the CNCed aluminum cover. Just a little confused with the high reduction gear ratio.

You are the man. Thank you. 

Yes, I do have the same question!  Eager to put these drives to a test, here. 

Hopeful we can entice @sofu to objectively test them for us, or at least be part of a three-person editorial on which drive is “best” for the reviewer and why we chose that unit. Sophia is the real deal and her reviews are second-to-none.

Actually more gearing is always better and makes the electrical system more efficient. 
You can't have enough of it until your motor is getting inefficient due to very high ERPM.
The belt drive is a very good, clean reliable and silent system but it is limited a bit in gearing further dow. Making a spur gear drive with a similar gearing ratio to a belt system doesn't make so much sense unless you want the gears for the sake of having gears. This is not enough for me to justify a second system in the fleet of boards we offer. 
1:6 is quite nice, produces tons of torque at the wheel while the motor is not sweating at all.
This justifies the increased noise level you get when using gear.

I have asked this question in another thread but I am also putting it here to get more opinions.
As some of you know, I just received a Trampa MTB

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-mountain-board-buy-or-build/72702/39?u=taz

It has come with the enclosed belt drive.

http://www.trampaboards.com/2019-mountainboard-twin-pro-belt-drive-motor-mount-with-motor-p-25928.html

Since I have not used the board yet (battery still in the making) I am thinking about trying to exchange it with the gear drive.

I will definitely loose a lot of top speed (5.9:1 vs 4.4:1 gearing) but this may not be such a big deal on a mountainboard.

I have tried to comprise a pros-cons list to help me make up my mind.

Belt drive:
Pros: Quieter
Smoother power transfer
Belts can be procured everywhere
Easier to change gearing
Practically zero maintenance

Cons: Drag
Belts may skip or strip (highly unlikely on a 15mm system with idler pulley)
Bigger size

Gear drive:
Pros: Smaller size
Less drag
Does not skip (if it does strip a gear though it is more of a problem)
Less weight (?)
Better mounting system to the truck (can be retro fitted to the belt system also)

Cons:
Too short ratio
Cannot easily change ratio (at the time of this post there is no alternative)
Noisy
If a gear strips it has to come from Trampa.
Lubrication needed.

I have no experience with either on durability but I am familiar with belts on esk8s but not gears.

What would you choose and why?
```

Just fixed some points from my perspective :) 

Belt drive:

Pros:
**INCORRECT** Smoother power transfer **(Belts have lag compared to instant torque transfer on gears, also with brakes. Brakes are like day and night difference on gears)**
**INCORRECT** Practically zero maintenance **(many people change at least one belt a month, with gears you can ride few K miles without any maintenance)**

Gear drive:
**INCORRECT** Less weight (?) **(can weight more for sure than belts)**


Cons:
Cannot easily change ratio **(don't know about trampa but for e.g. ours change motor gear)**
Lubrication needed. **(not always plastic/metal can run dry without issues too, but its a bit louder)**
```

_This is why I used the term smooth so no disagreement here._
**INCORRECT** Practically zero maintenance **(many people change at least one belt a month, with gears you can ride few K miles without any maintenance)**
_So far I have 500km on my psychotiller mounts with 12mm belts and the belts look fine. In any case I was referring to the lack of lubrication. I would still expect gears to last longer than belts though so we agree here too._ 

Gear drive:
**INCORRECT** Less weight (?) **(can weight more for sure than belts)**
_This is why I used the question mark. From the parts list though the Trampa gear system **looks** lighter to the Trampa belt system_

Cons:
Cannot easily change ratio **(don’t know about trampa but for e.g. ours change motor gear)**
_As I wrote, right now Trampa does not offer alternative gear ratios and my questions are limited to their system._
Lubrication needed. **(not always plastic/metal can run dry without issues too, but its a bit louder)**
_Not convinced in an enclosed system. I have lots of really powerful RCs that run dry metal to plastic but none are enclosed. I live in Greece and it can get quite hot during the summer. I am afraid melted gears would be the result of running a gear system dry. Still I could be wrong about that._

Regarding lubrication I was running ingear (old gear drive design in middle of summer here in London ~36ºC were so not much issues :thinking:  Bad meshing and etc things can cause issues but if everything is correctly configured it would run perfectly :)

EDIT: Dont forget that gear teeth size is different compared RC and esk8 :)

In my opinion the worse part of belt drive that’s is debris getting into it is solved by having the belt enclosed

But I would try to exchange it for lower maintenance and lower energy consumption

Gear drive is the future of esk8. That’s why Trampa made them finally... Drawback is not having ability to change gear ratios. You mentioned a lot of the pros- no belt slippage, enclosed systems, & lube is your friend.

Why not have both? I’ll continue to use best parts for belt drive.

Have two boards with two different drive trains?

I like push in wheel pulleys like FATBOY, evolve, metroboard. Wider is better for me in belts. 15mm minimum. 

I would say belt drive train is a little easier than gear drive train to install. You have to align gear drive.

There are no drawbacks compared to belt drive imo. I started out with belt drive, but was changing belts every 200 km or so. Gear drive is more efficient, better free coasting, less maintenance. If you don't get helical, it will have a higher whine noise. 

If you don't like the gear drive ratio, there are three other gear drives available with different ratios from 1:4 till 1:6. My personal favorite is 1:5 at 149 kv at 12s. Plenty of torque and top speed (around 45 km/h).

There is nothing worse than a slow board imo, awfully frustrating. I really enjoy blasting up hills on and off-road at high speeds. Might not do it in the beginning, but trust me. You'll want to go faster at some point in time and it's good if the board allows it, instead of being stuck at lower speeds due to gear drive ratio and potentially motor options.

Lack of support for gear, bearing overheating, friction, wear. Plastic can't hold in there aluminium too soft. We have tried already this design, and sticked to 2 gear.

We didn't posted much as it was experiment but it failed miserable... We tried first pom gear it melted after running for 10 min at mid rpm, aluminium started to deform as two sides there pushing it and also wear. also bearings heat up as there are no cooling for them. It is possible to fix all these issues but who wants to pay shit loads of money for this kinda drive :)
