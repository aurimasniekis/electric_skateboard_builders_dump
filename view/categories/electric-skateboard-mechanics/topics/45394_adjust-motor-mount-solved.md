Does anyone know how to adjust this motor mount so the belt is tighter? The belt fit nicely before I took it apart. Now it's too loose. ![20180202_174537|666x500](upload://zzTG88kNbHxdUHxOpe1iV6zTnwN.jpg)

I believe that there are slots in the black part. So you loosen the 3 screws and pull on the motor
I think Jason made a video about it when the mount was new, it is somewhere on his YT channel
