I have a drop-through deck, but don't have enough clearance for my motor and battery when I use the drop-through feature. I've seen double trucks on trucks before but never gave them any thought. Anyone know if anyone sells Double trucks for Caliber II's? Also, I found these by searching up **"longboard double truck."** Any idea what these type of trucks are called?

 **Examples:**

I've been waiting a long time to buy double reverse kingpin trucks, at least but preferably more than 305mm axle length

in the meantime, we have Evolve Supercarve trucks for when you just have to have the carviest board

It's more likely the bottom hanger would have a pivot CUP on it and the first kingpin would also be the second pivot.

edit: no, that won't work.  this must be why they don't exist

in the meantime, as long as you stay under 27mph I'll take Supercarve over CaliberII any day of the week

I’ve never been a fan of the sidewinders. There is a product that gives you that feel and makes rkp feel like sidewinders. Look up the surf adapter. The guy sent me one to try out and it is pretty awesome.

Ha ha.  Okay, so maybe Surf Adaptor under 10mph, Supercarve 10mph to 27mph and CaliberII over 27mph

I would get supercrarve trucks but I don't feel like paying ~180 + 30 for the mount

Sufficient is to say that the most famous and trusted Esk8 brand on the planet uses double bushing trucks throughout their product line.

Evolves are great, unless you plan on going faster than 20mph...gullwing trucks are nice as a toy

Could also be sufficient to say there's 1 good reason 100's of other builder's and brands don't use double kingpin trucks...
