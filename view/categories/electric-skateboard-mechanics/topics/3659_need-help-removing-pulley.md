So I'm trying to recycle my 180mm trucks for my upcoming build because they fit 2x 5065 motors, but I'm having a hard time removing the current motors on there. So far I've removed 2 allen screws from the pulley, but the pulley does not seem to come off. I've also removed 2 allen screws from the motor base and a circlip, though still nothing budging. Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks! So there's no special trick, you just have to pull really hard on the pulley :(

It could very well also have a bot of Locktite or similar smeared on the shaft for additional hold.
Simply heating the pulley with a lighter or similar may well help.

If it's because of loctite it should slide off ... If it's wedged not so much but will help ... A little screw driver under the pulley for leverage .... But the battery terminal remover will def take it off....I took one off with the grub nit still in all the way

Put a big flat screwdriver and wedge it inbetween and leverage it out against the motor mount. Use some foam/rubber on the motor mount if you don't want to damage it.

@Jinra,  try heating the pulley without heating the motor shaft too much so that the pulley can expand.

@barajabali @Michaelinvegas So I tried the terminal puller. It seems the wall of the pulley that the terminal puller grabs onto is riveted on the pulley and is very weak. All this did is bend the pulley wall

However!  @WeeChumlee and Michael's advice of heating up the pulley helped, and @torqueboards advice of wedging a flathead in there worked like a charm! Now to return this battery terminal puller..

using aluminum pulleys? these are steel, but i can see how auminum ones would bend or even tear f they were on there too tight.

they're fairly light, so I'm assuming they're aluminum.

I ended up destroying my aluminum pulley I got from @torqueboards a while back.  That sucker would not budge a mm.

You got an aluminum one? I got 16T from him and it seems to be steel. Definitely has to weight for it.

It was the blue aluminum 12 or 15mm wide pulleys.  The first things to fall off trying to take it off were the flanges.

Bearing or pulley puller or an arbor press. And your supposed to pull from the outer lips not the inner lips lol otherwise ^ that happens.

```
most of the time you can't get below the outer lip because the motor mount is in the way. Usually they don't come unpressed like this, but now that it has happened...

@Hatman30 if you have a dremel you can notch the teeth of the pulley to give the puller something to grab onto. The pulley will be useless afterwards, but its already half way there.

Unbolt the motor mount and put it on an arbor and press from the shaft. Or unbolt the shaft set screw pull or press the shaft out. Then press the pulley off. Reinsert the shaft. Locktight set screw. Boom pulley is removed..

Dont let a piece of metal beat you ;)

goring a piece of metal into submission with a dremel is definitely not letting it beat you.
