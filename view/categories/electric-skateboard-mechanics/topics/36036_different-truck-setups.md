Was wondering if anyone runs with different trucks front and back.

To my knowledge most of the mounts right now are made for calibers and without major modification its hard to fit them onto other trucks with round hangers. 

I have 2 boards, one with caliber 2s and the other with caliber clones. 

Looking to swap out both the front trucks for paris 180mms so that I can make full use of my nipple bushings and get a more lively ride out of both my boards.

 Currently the calibers work fine but its just too boring of a ride even when carving.
