Hi Guys,

I have the next batch of 15mm Pulley Kits coming soon.  Previously I was including one 255 and one 265 belt.  What length would you like to see included in the kits?

 - 255
 - 260

It depends alot on the gearing. I run 15/40 and I need 280 on tourqueboards v4 mounts.

I run 20/40 on 260.  but the biggest thing that impacts belt length is an ajustable motor mount,  it gives you some play room.

I'm running 255 and find that a bare minimum for my current 16/36 83mm setup. So I would suggest 265 and 280 (for longer motor mounts or perhaps setups including idler).

You should get 12mm wide kit as well though :)

Thanks for the feedback so far guys.  So looks like I should get rid of the 255. 265 appears to be a keep. Now it just whether the next size should be 275 or 280.

DIY has 12mm so that's why I've stayed away from that space. Also 15mm is just SOOO much better :)
