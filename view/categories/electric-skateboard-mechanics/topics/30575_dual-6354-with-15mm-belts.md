So I'm just wondering but does anyone have any experience with running dual 6354 motors and 15mm belts on a 180mm trucks? If so how much space will I have between my motors?

I know 12mm works and depending on the motor you will have a couple of mm between them. Sk3 motors are bigger in length due to the curved housing at the end while tourqueboards motors are almost flat on the end.

i´m not aware of any combination that would allow two 15mm.
Even 12mm is not possible with all combination, but should work on most.
I´m running 2x 12mm with clone Enertion mounts and dual 6355 Maytech on a caliber truck with 83mm flywheel clones.
There is barely 1mm of space between both motors ;)

You could go with tourqueboards 213mm trucks, I am running dual 6374 with it

The latest version of TB mounts have all the bolts recessed and flush to allow tighter clearance between the motor plate and pulley

I would do that but shipping to Aus is kinda expensive. I think I'll just use a 10 or 12mm belt

@pat.speed 15mm should fit on our 180mm Trucks. They will definitely fit on our 218mm Trucks. We also have 15mm pulleys now as well (not listed on the site yet).

@Joshuaward101 You can buy from the site and mention you want a 15mm pulley in the order notes and we'll send you 15mm. Any issues and we'll let you know otherwise.
