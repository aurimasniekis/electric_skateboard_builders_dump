I started designing my own 4 piece hub that can be 3D printed and got the 6x2 tire from china.
Oneworked pretty well and I am currently printing the other three.

Printed in ABS I was not able to destroy the hub. I threw it on the ground at 3bars and it is still just like fresh from the printer. No deformation whatsoever.

Will do once all the wheels have been ridden.
It will fit standard truck axles - outer bearing to outer bearing distance is 24mm

I don't even know what you are trying to tell me here :neutral_face:
This has nothing to do with @trampa.

I am just trying to come up with a way to use standard caliber trucks with pneumatics. After using the skikes but wanting something wider I turned to the 6x2inch wheels and since @psychotiller is located in the US I tried my own design.

My cousin owns a tyre-shop and I wanted to see if he could get any with good prices.

These are the tires I bought:
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/6X2-6-Inch-Scooter-Tire-Inner-Tube-Set-Electric-Scooter-Wheel-Chair-Truck/32797860065.html

~15USD each including shipping to Germany. At the time when I bought them they were on sale and I payed 31EUR for three of them. Shipping was also really fast with just 2weeks - I ordered a single wheel in January from a different seller that took 9 weeks to arrive.

why do I need a big brand tire?

Kenda does not have 6x2inch tires but only 6x1-1/4 - that is the same as the 6inch skikes that can be bought in Europe.

Talked to my cousin.

At the moment he can only get this kind of tyre in 6x2 for about 10eur including tube.

that is not a 6inch tire though is it? 4.00-6 is like a standard tire for wheelbarrows and can be bought for 9€ on ebay http://www.ebay.de/itm/Schubkarrenrad-Schubkarre-Rad-Raeder-Ersatzrad-Luftrad-Felge-rot-4-00-6-2PR-/151186743528

guys please stop posting random 6inch wheels. I am not interested in them.
6x1-1/4 can be bought everywhere and is nothing special. They are standard nordic skate wheels that will need machining in order to fit a skate axle.
I want 6x2 and only @psychotiller is able to get you some working hubs for them.

I said he could get them in 6x2. The picture was only to show the tread pattern of said tire.
The only reason I was getting involved here was because your 3d-printed hub looked interesting and if you are planning on sharing the files for it I wanted to try them out. But I wouldn't wanna wait for china/USA delivery times so I looked to my closest supplier of tires to see what he had on hands in that size.

Since he's franchise I'm guessing he doesn't really know what supplier/manufacturer it is. He just order through their main branch and they handle all suppliers.
I don't want to bug him to much since it's tire changing season in sweden and they have bookings every 10 minutes.

@Maxid this is awesome, to print your own hub and then just buy the tyres and tubes would be legendary.
I didn't think i'd see this anytime soon, If this works I'm donating.

If your happy with the design I'd love to test them, just need the files, then get my m8 to print them.

Are you going with printed wheel pulleys as well? I'm eager to try printing some pulleys in PETG or Nylon just to test the strength.

Btw, isn't slotted screws the worst thing in the world to work with? Can't count all the times I've jammed a screwdriver/powerbit into my fingers trying to tighten those bastards.
I will assume that you didn't have any others at hand at the moment :wink:

I already used a pulley made out of ABS for my skikes - going to do the same thing when I know that these hubs hold up.

Yeah they are. But I have nuts on the other side that I can fasten while I just need to hold the slotted screw. They are M5 50mm and you are right I did not have any other ones at hand. I also liked however that their head is slimmer than a hex one.

They seem to hold - inflated to 3.5 bars the hub seems to be solid. I jumped up and down on the board and everything stayed where it is supposed to stay :slight_smile:

If you want to test them I can upload them tomorrow to grabcad or thingiverse. Keep in mind that I have not ridden them motorized or in rough terrain though. No idea how long ABS hubs can last and what beating they can take.

Looks sick though - much tougher than the skinny skike wheels

Awesome, and impressive that you can inflate to 50PSI.
I've just ordered the tyres, same ones as you ordered, reckon I can replace my front 2 wheels when they come and try slamming them into some speed-bumps and off curbs

Have you considered making hubs for smaller wheel widths as well? I'm assuming the reduced rubber in contact with the ground will mean reduced friction, and therefore increase efficiency. That or go-faster stripes on the side :slight_smile:

Perhaps this tyre? (think it's slimmer)

I had to faff around with trucks I don't really like to get mine working without wheelbite, got a few ideas for the future though.

I gt my motor mounts yesterday, trying to mill the Paris 195's to fit is bit of a pain. The flat spots on the hanger make it impossible to use a 3 jaw chuck, I need a small 4 jaw but don't have one.  I dropped off a hanger and mount to a machinist friend today, waiting to see what he comes up with.

I really don't think bite is going to be an issue.  I'm using 1/2in shock pads on a deck with pretty massive cutouts.  I should have most of the components in by this weekend, I'll dry fit everything and see how it looks then and update you guys.

I can probably sell them for $130 shipped for a set including tires/tubes and $20 per pulley.

I used that thingverse pulley creator, and got as far as creating the pulley in OpenSCAD, then I'd export it into fusion, but it always imports as something that I can't alter (I wanted to punch some holes for bolts to go through, and maybe add/reduce the thickness in some places)

That inventor thing seems to cost money, think i'll invest some more time in Fusion as it's pretty good, and also free :slight_smile: (also I've found CAD ain't that easy to learn, so I'm not enthusiastic about learning another program)

you need to convert the stl file made by OpenSCAD before you can use it in any CAD software.

Very tempted to try nematic tyres finding my current setup very bumpy where I live and a few curbs to high for me to go up so going to these would be a good option. Let me know how they go would be good to use the same bolt holes to attach a pulley to as well or combine the inner tyre brace and the pulley into one pice.

@maxid: how long and hard have you ridden your ABS-hubs? I did a test print in my scrap PLA just to check that the conversion to STL in fusion360 didn't mess anything up. 

Just wanted to know its worth printing four hubs in ABS.

Not at all until now :( - so many things to do and after reading about a recent incident in which the police caught an esk8er not far away from where I live, I am reluctant to use my boards right now.
I hope @riva_00 can give you more details once he tested them on his board.

to make them from metal you are probably better of going the traditional subtractive manufacturing.
However even trampa uses plastic for their hubs so metal is not really needed - all comes down to the plastic you use

@Maxid: So far the test print in scrap PLA looks good :slight_smile:

Just one question, is there a specific reason as to why the outer rings are separate parts and not integrated directly with the rim sides?

Material amount would be the same but you'd need additional support structures for the overhang. Also you can switch them out if necessary (one might break - it is where all the pressure is from inflating - you could even upgrade them to metal if you want) or add the pulley (I also uploaded my 35t one).

I see. I figured it had something to do with the rings taking most of the pressure and easy swapping of them. Printing only a new ring surely beats  5h+ for a whole new rim side. Pulley is printing as we speak :slight_smile:

More questions, sorry for being a PITA.
Isn't the inner hollowness of the pulley way bigger than it needs to be? The diameter is around 42mm when the hanger diameter is around 22mm.

Wouldn't more material add to strength of the pulley?
```

I have the pulley very close to my mount. With the screws holding the motor plate sticking out a little, they would be touching the pulley. This way they can basically sit inside the pulley. If your mount allows a thicker wall you could easily add more material on the inside.

you should try and use the mounts you will ultimately use. A different mount will not help you much as center-center distance will be different, position on the hanger will be different and so on. It is important to not get too close to the tire with your motor pulley - that is also the reson why the pulley is so wide.

~3 bar. I'm 75 kg. I used wood screws and cut of the pointy end so the bigger(deeper) threads are in contact with more surface.
Hubs are 2 pieces and the inner is holding boath bearings.
I think your model might be to compact. Making an "exploding/shattering effect" 
If you look at this picture you can see 5 cutouts that prevent the exploding wheel thing. It makes it flex just abit not to build up to much pressure on a certain point.

I am not a material scientist but I think plastics are not metals that sometimes get stronger when you take away material - your "cutout" should not have any effect (in my opinion) as it does not even need to flex with the screws in place taking all the load.
But i am open to be educated in this.

My single skike hub was one piece without screws and thus the plastic had to hold all the load - at 6 bars simply too much.

I think you can use it with a 15mm belt - but depending on the tire it might not.
You have to measure it for the parts you use.

I tried to use a Santa Cruz Armageddon deck - but wheelbite is an issue. I now ordered Torqueboards new wider trucks (thanks @rwxr) and cut some wood off the deck. Let's see :D

@torqueboards 218mm trucks worked wonders for the wheelbite issues I had with standard caliber trucks.

@Maxid, @L3chef - I love what you guys have done here. I recently decided to upgrade to pneumatic wheels but got pretty bummed out when I found out that pretty much the only options were super expensive or super terrible, then I found this!

I've got a 3d printer so this is a no brainer for me, but I'd like to remix your design a little if your cool with it to add a bit of an offset as I think it will work better with my system (I'll post files if anybody is interested). I'll also be printing it in PETG so we will see how that goes. 

2 quick questions for you - 

1) It seems like going with a 2" wide wheel was pretty important for you. Why? Have you noticed a difference?

2) Any updates from you or @L3chef on how these are working out? anything you wish you could change? Any potential issues you see?

Thanks again for your great work!

I was looking for 6" tires and found the 2" wide ones and it just looked so much beefier than the thin skike wheels. In the end I am glad becaise they also feel great and seem to be much more durable than the skikes.

Sure go ahead and redesign them. Would love to have more options and an improved design. If you do you might also want to adjust the through holes so that it fits the spoke design (so do 5 instead of 6 through holes). I don't think that one screw will make a difference. The reason why there are 6 is because I started with a 6 spoke design and later changed it but had the rings already printed so did not change it.

Awesome, thanks for the good info. Glad to hear that they are still holding up so well for you guys, @L2chef -500km is super impressive! I realized that another advantage of the wider tires it that it lets you keep them at a lower psi and achieve the same stiffness as the contact patch of the wheel is larger, which ultimately puts less stress on the hubs. I just ordered a set of those tires.

Noted on the bolt pattern change. I'll give it a try. 

Two more questions for you guys - 

1) Have you had any problems with vibrations at high speeds or imbalance in the wheels?

2) What pressure are you actually running your wheels at? @maxid I know that you said you tested them up to 3.5 bars, but is that what you are actually running at? it seems really high for this width of tire.

They are awesome - by gluing the bearings with epoxy I was able to eliminate the slight wobble they had previously (probably due to the tolerances not being quite right when printing. Otherwise they handled the abuse very well. I was drifting last week on sandy ground which means a lot of lateral forces  and they worked perfectly fine. 
Also pneumatics on an esk8 are the only way for me from now on - can't imagine why I should go back to urethane plus the 6 inch wheels seem like the perfect size. Only the pulley needs more teeth for better torque.

If they fit the ali express tires that @Maxid is using then the airless should work as well.  If there is a slight difference in the OD of the hub you can always glue some 1/16 ABS in there and then reseat the tires.

Its really hard to say.  The nummies are a more comfortable ride than the airless, but he airless grip better.  The airless are pretty much useless in the grass, the nummies run great as long as it isn't wet.

Essentially, the airless wheels as are almost as grippy as ABEC 11 flywheels while still having a lot of give.  he nummies will eat up more vibration and have more give but aren't the best for carving.

Isn't it that pneumatics have quite good grip in the wet while urethane wheels will start to slip very early. And my pneumatics also have endless grip at carving. Guess the question is at how much pressure you run them. Or do in missunderstand the word "nummies"?

Your right. The 6in thane wheels don't do well in rain on grass, that's what I meant. I don't ride in the rain much, to worried about shorts. 

I find that soft thane grips better on heavy carves on asphalt/concrete. I usually run my pnumatics, or nummies, pretty hard so that probably accounts for me getting better grip on thane.

Wouldn't that impact the print quality....I feel like that is asking for trouble. If I have my printer dialed in for a particular filament, changing the properties of said filament might cause problems....slight increase to print size will offset the post print annealing and make the print as a whole stronger I think....maybe I'm just talking out my butt but this is what my thinking is.

Problem is slippage - pneumatics are super tight due to the air pressure in the tube and don't slip. The airless tires might slip because the fit needs to be perfect to result in large enough friction. I'd love for someone to try it though

sorry I should have been more clear, I'm sure it's the way the bearings are sitting in the hubs, I can get them not too bad by putting the hub on the truck and tapping gently with a hammer.

Woah! I didn't realize that there had been a bunch of action on this thread since I last looked at it. I had asked @Maxid if I could remix his hubs to add an offset (like six shooters) I finished up a few weeks ago and have taken a few rides around the block (so far so good) but the weather is stopping me from riding more. I figured I would post my remix in case anyone was interested (I am assuming that @Maxid is cool with this, otherwise let me know and I will pull them). These have a 10mm offset, so it is like having trucks that are 20mm longer, the extra room is really nice. I also designed them in 3 parts rather than 4. 

One other change I made was to add a small shim on the retainers. I found that most of my runout was not in the hub, but in the wheels sitting slightly crooked on the hub, these shims make it so that you can still get the tire on the hub, but then center the wheel properly. Once you inflate the wheel it pushes up onto these retainers and rides pretty true. 

Also, I printed these in PETG on my printer, as I now print everything in PETG (never going back to ABS!). Seems like they are holding up great so far, I have dropped them and inflated them to 50 psi no problem. We'll see how they hold up with time.

@ Maxid - Yep went to 5 screws at your suggestion (I also did change the screws to 10-32 as they were cheaper for me, if anyone needs to know). Yeah it is basically a rev on yours. I remodeled the hubs but I basically copied your dimensions/design wherever I could then tweaked a few things. 

@riva_00 - yeah, i guess we kind of hit the extremes with these pulleys. 72t is basically as big as I could squeeze in there. I run single motor 12s, so i want to squeeze as much torque out of it as I can seeing that I still have a lot of unused top end speed. The pulley/belt are HTD5 15mm, thanks for the reminder. I updated the description on grabcad as well. This is also the first board I have done with an Idler and I a have to say I am loving it. I cant get it to slip! I was using an 18t 15mm pulley before no idler and I still got slippage even with the belt super tight.

Awesome, 15mm belts are the way forward for AT stuff, I'm sending this to be printed and report back once i have it tested. Might be a while though as i get prints for free but they take ages....
How hard would it be to make pulley variations? I've tried to make them myself but can only use fusion 360 at the mo and I can't do them (I blame the software :slight_smile: ). Need to upskill but got so much other stuff on and learning CAD ain't that simple.

With these printed I'll have Maxid's, Ptowncruiser's and psychotiller's original billet hubs.

Nice! yeah I have been riding 15mm for 4 years and have no desire to use anything else. nice! let me know how it turns out. I could make a variation, and I should probably just set up the model to me more parametric, that way you only need to make changes to a few parameters to change number of teeth and belt width. Sorry to kill your scapegoat but Fusion 360 can definitely do pulleys no problem :), that's what I modeled these in. What size of pulley are you looking for?

One note on printing pulleys, the teeth won't always mesh using the nominal dimensions. It depends on the slicer, printer, and material. When I have printed pulleys in the past in abs on an airwolf or flashforge dreamer using cura slicer I had to tweak the tooth spacing a little (I don't really know what the main contributor is, but I suspect it is the material). Now I am printing on a prusa i3 mk2 in PETG using slic3r and the nominal dimensions work great. 

Also, the f360 file is on the grabcad page so anybody can tweak the design if they want.

Just me that can't do pulleys in fusion360 then........yet.
I'm not sure what size pulley I want to end up with, my only tested setup was running 15/60 on 10s, this gave me great torque and I found myself initially limiting the amps a little to get smoother acceleration, that can be better solved by Ackmaniac's app though I reckon.
My main issue was running the sidewinder 2 trucks, they're all about carving, but they're also great for pushing out the wheels and avoiding bite on the deck. In the future I'll dremel the deck and use either Ronins or TorqueBoards 218mm trucks, not sure yet.

72 teeth should give me about 22mph max on 10s, which is actually about right really, but I think 15/66 might be the sweet spot (or maybe 16/68?) once i get better at riding.

I've sent those files to be printed, might take a couple of weeks....however he has a 3d printer worth thousands and hires a CAD guy, it should print to the exact dimensions, we'll see.

The hub doesn't fit into the retainer or pulley.

@ptowncruiser Found the issue, looks like the plastic curled in a bit due to the chamfer on the end of the shim, I had to take some material away (trying to bash them together with force works fine :slight_smile: ).
If anyone else prints these, i'd suggest leaving the ends slightly thicker.

@riva_00 sorry for the interference, glad you got it worked out. Yeah, it should be a nice slip fit. Your instincts were good, if they don't fit first step is to debur the connection, then you can try sanding a bit if that doesn't work. Those rings can also just be broken/cut off if anybody doesn't want them. 

I've also now updated the model to be parametric. In order to modify the model download the .f3d file and open in fusion360. You can use the Num_Teeth parameter to change the number of teeth. I designed it to work with pulleys between 52 and 72 teeth, less than that will not work, more than that probably will, but no guarantees. if you use less than ~60t a chamfer will fail, no biggie, you don't need it at that size of pulley anyway and fusion doesn't support conditional parametrics so it was easiest to just let it fail. 

I've also added a Printing_Comp parameter that you can use to tune the fit of the belt. You can increase this or decrease this in .1 increments to fine tune belt fit (+ will increase the tooth spacing). I've only tested this with a 72t pulley, and I needed a (+) .1 Pulley_Comp value to get a good fit (on a Prusa mk2s with petg). To test tooth fit the best thing to do it start the print and kill it after 2-3 mm of the pulley section has been printed, then you can check it with your belt, adjust the parameter, and repeat until it fits how you like it. 

You can also change the pulley width using the Belt_Width parameter. Put in your nominal belt size (3 mm of pulley width is automatically added to this.) 

@riva_00 I've also uploaded a 15/66t pulley to the grabcad page just for you :slight_smile:

Please remember these models are provided as is for people to mess around with. I do not in any way guarantee that they are going to work without some fiddling around with them. Remember I have only printed these at a 72t size, but other pulley sizes should be really close to what you need as I have modeled a bunch of htd pulleys in the past and I used the same method here. In other words you can't sue me if these don't work, sorry! I also would't really recommend printing them from an online service as they are probably going to be expensive as all getout and tweaking them to get them just right will be very painful/expensive.

I'm really interested in trying this, but I'm worried the retainer rings would delaminate in use.
Perhaps molding and casting the prints would make more durable hubs? Maybe using a rigid polyurethane plastic, it's super durable.

So after testing the hubs I decided they were to heavy, so I cut alot of material off of them.
If you print these with CF-ABS at 75% infill at 260C and 110 BED you cannot break them.
I've pumped them to 90Psi and rode them in the AZ dessert all day.
Also printing at 0.15 vs 0.1 layer hight makes them significantly stronger.
i removed 1 screw to make them match up better aswell.
If anyone wants the files msg me.

@intensivegecko there should not be any bulging. I don't have any on mine. What pressure are you inflated to? I think mine are inflated to 35 psi. You need a ring on each side (except for the wheel with the pulley, the pulley has a retaining ring integrated into it). It can be a bit of a pain to get the tire to seat up on top of the lip, but this is what helps reduce runout. I found that If i inflated my tires to about 15 psi and worked them back and forth a bit it helped seat them, then I inflated them the rest of the way. I still had one I couldn't seat, but it actually fixed itself the first time I rode it. 

I am not 100% sure what you are talking about with the bulging. Can you give us a picture?

I'm using ABS on front wheels, with Maxids design, and PETG for the back ones with ptowncruisers design.
Both are fine. There's no point printing in exotic carbon filament when considering the materials suitability, however i'd say it can look better.

Had my first flat tyre yesterday whilst off-roading down some dirt and gravel tracks, managed to limp back home with no damage to the hub or pulley. Think I need to print some hot-swappable spare wheels....

Do a test print with a few basic shapes like cubes, cylinders, see if they are geometrically correct. If you are using a delta and its set up wrong your circles become ellipsoids, squares become rhombuses etc.


By the way, anyone tried printing a hub in PLA? If so, what infil did you try? Or fully solid?

I have bo ABS, and wondering if its worth to try and waste a bunch of PLA. Id print a single hub for an 8in tire for starters.

man I just got a wheel with tyre and kinda emulated the hub that was on already, couldnt use that without very much effort, so i designed and printed a replacement hub.

My outer rings are 115mm and the hub itself if (im pretty sure) 100mm, BUT it was like 2mm too big diameter wise, so fitting the tyre was a bitch.


edit: yes mine is also 200x50, but I do not know if there is a "rigid standard" for the dimensions of these things... mine was made in taiwan if that helps :smiley:  really just measure the tyre you have, the inner diameter and then you just look for approx how much the thick (flat-ish) rim extends away from the inner edge, you know the one.

Hey @Maxid would it be hard to make a pulley that sides over the one you have that's on the rim?

I want to test out and see if this petg can handle being belt-less...  

so my biggest thing on gear drives is the fact that there's no weak point and when a gear breaks it's hard to just buy one off the shelf... with a printed gear I can make as many as I want and still have a purposely created failure point like a belt drive

IStick a heating foil underneath the bed and use a power supply. You wanna have around 40-50 degrees Celsius to prevent warping. We also use painters tape (green in the picture) to cover the bed. Every time we print something we rub a glue stick across the bed (not sure if that's clear).

Also housing the printer in a box helps a lot!

Given 10 minutes in fusion360 I've created this rough sketch. Welds are highlighted in red.
![image|690x446](upload://c9UrrPN2hZtDwpbReF1Gl9wX5ju.png)
![image|496x500](upload://sI9ILdBMHqS72Eeg0Fo3J2TqPtV.jpg)

Clearly the spoke design is trash, but beyond that I'm thinking ease of manufacturing. So the side plates would be cut by waterjet or plasma cutter. The center bearing carrier (22mm ID) would be a section of pipe welded in place (weld being placed on the inside of the unit for the "outside" of the hub.

Then the larger pipe would be placed on the hub and welded on. Finally the other "side" of the hub would be slotted on top. The center 12mm ID pipe would have to be a few MM extra long so you can weld the outside now. And the larger pipe would be welded on the same way as the other.

With a bit of practice and a jig to keep things aligned properly. This design should be fairly cheap to reproduce.
For a belt pulley I'd still stick with the 3d printed approach so you can swap around number of teeth to experiment a bit. I see psychotiller uses the versa pulleys, so perhaps the mounting system could be compatible with that as well.

The 10mm offset bearing part. That I didn't think of. I have an idea that might work, but it raises complexity higher than I would like for easy to cut plans.

I'll experiment more and maybe make a new thread. I don't want to hijack the thread dedicated to plastic hubs with my heretical metal ideas.

AliExpress tubes and hubs shipped a while ago, got PETG filament in yesterday and the prints have begun. I love this color, it's like the old neon Lego color. 

5 walls, 65% infill, 2mm tops and bottoms, these things are rock solid and about as hefty as I'd ever want them to be... Estimated to be just under my 1kg roll for all four hubs. Too much? I don't think so! 

I drew everything up in CAD based on where my mounts are, pulley, motor shaft length and everything to ensure a good fit. I had to extend out the pulley teeth to 23mm to get a good fit and enough space between the end of my motor shaft and the offset hub core/tire. Because of this, I added a spot for a third bearing that will lock in tight with the other two and just fit on the TB218 hangars.

Yea, so 75% infill and 2mm walls might have been a bit overkill. Dropping that down to 50% infill for the next print.

Hatchbox ABS 215c print, 80c bed, 2mm walls, .15mm layer height. Seems quite strong and fits the belt perfectly.

That’s a solid ABS print… I’ve only used inland ABS and find warping to always be my issue. I’ve tried the fake build Tak, and glass, glue stick, abs slurry… For smaller prints, glass + gluestick + 105 - 110C bed works great, but I always worry printing larger parts (smaller work great), because I’ll come back after 8 hours and find prints warped so much more than they were (0) at 2-3 hours in.

I’ve stopped using ABS basically. My enclosure works great to keep ambient high enough that the printer itself is extremely uncomfortable to touch for longer than a second, hot air all around. I’ve moved to using nylon for high strength prints exclusively… Along with this new 3D Solutech PETG that has been amazing, with zero warping.

I commend you for being able to push CF ABS on such a large print successfully! What brand CF ABS is that?

This is normal abs. Cf abs scratches up your nozzle and makes it larger after a few prints and essentially hates your machine.

I'd honestly try making your prints cooler. Sounds like your bed is too hot. You need the edge where it's slightly melty, but sticky melty, not dripping melty.

I do this with no cover over my machine. I closed the ac vent to be safe though.

I'd love to try more exotic material like petg and nylon, but I already bought this and my printer maxes out at 100c on the plate. Abs is already pushing it quite a bit.

Before I try and change Maxid's design to enable easy tire change, I though it would be nice to have the exact reproduction in solidworks. So I took measurements from the STL file and got this. @Maxid, would you mind if I shared this? I think people can use this as a starting point. Any modification I make to this design, I'll share it as well.  I am using a parametric pulley that I designed a long time ago(it can be found in a post here)

By easy tire change I meant, not having to remove the whole pulley assembly if I had to change the tire. One has to disassemble the hub with pulley for tire change in your case right? Or maybe I am confused

You need to know motor and wheel pulley teeth and distance between motor and truck axle to calculate the belt length. If you are going to use an idler it’s going to be a bit more complicated.

Guys when I was getting the 6x2 tires, I also noticed a complete set(tire, tube and hub) for $20. It needs a 8mm shaft with free length of at least 35mm. That makes it perfect for TB218. Mounting a pulley would be super easy using the 3 protruding bolts. I put it on a 8mm shaft and can confirm that there was no noticeable wobble. I ordered it on the 3rd and received it on 18th.

Why haven't been people using this combination?

I bought these because I was too lazy to print the hub... 

They fit TB 218mm trucks but the bearings are pressed in and I have no idea if they can be easily replaced.

I am also designing a geared drive for it. 

Here's the adapter that is meant to interface with the hub.

You would need a bearing puller, Easy peasy. I have changed motor bearing that way.

I went a non standard approach, took some measurements and came up with this. Will print it in a day or two.

I think the rim will burst once you inflate the tire. The reason for my screws being so far away from the circle center is that they are supposed to eat the forces on the rim wall. In your design there is nothing helping the plastic to stay in place and the material is not up to hold several bars of pressure

Can't see why it won't work... But your pulley has not many teeth? I was aiming for something like 60T but the size of that would make it larger than the rim resulting in potential hitting the tyre when it flexes.

You can modify the design to have whatever width and how many ever teeth. I selected 50 because 42 would have caused the countersink for M6 bolt head to be very close to the teeth. You can easily go to 60 teeth, just change it in the solidworks equation.

I used ptowncruiser's version. I had the same problem. Then I realized you have to put the hub in from the opposite side than you initially think you do. Went in without a hitch.

So if the stem is pointing out the front, rotate (not bend) it 90+ degrees so that its pointing out the back, then insert the stem into the hub and push the hub through. As the hub goes through the tire it will rotate the stem into it's proper position.
