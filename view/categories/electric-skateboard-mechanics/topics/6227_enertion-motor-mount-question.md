Hey guys just curious. I just got my motor mount from Enertion and I notice that where the truck goes it has like an angle ( square fit?). My truck is rounded, how do I make it work with rounded trucks? Thanks

Enertion's motor mounts (assuming you're referring to [these mounts](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/carbon-fiber-motor-mount-enertion/)) are made for Calibers (or Caliber clones, which Enertion's trucks are). I think the only way to make it work for a round truck is to create some sort of adapter, which will probably only somewhat work, or just weld it.

Yes that is the mount. Hmmm anyone know some caliber clones? Looking for options atm.
