In the first picture in red:  "Warning: A value for teeth in mesh below 6 may not be suitable for most applications." 
I plan to run single drive. Is it ok, can I do something about it?

Well, its a bit extreme the fact that you have 4 teeth meshed on the motor pulley. If you're VERY light it might work, or you could extend the CTC distance until you get 6 teeth meshing.

I have seen a motor mount with a belt tensioner made out of bearing, could it help?
I worry that if I would use a long motor mount I wouldn't have room for battery enclosure.
