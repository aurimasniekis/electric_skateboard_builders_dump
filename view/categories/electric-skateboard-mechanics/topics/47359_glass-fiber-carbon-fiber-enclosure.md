Cover your deck and mold, put it on your board and make the enclosure, that way it Will fit you exact board perfectly

If it flexes 5 cm you may find you'll have more problems than the fibreglass standing up to the abuse..
The enclosure may ground?
The battery may flex?
Best bet is sectional or separate short enclosures I would have thought?
