Is it possible to build a ''swing arm'' type mechanism, so that wheels get turned when the board tilts.. or perhaps, that there is a ''steering handle'' mounted on the board?

Something like some diy go-cars have, looks like could be easly made!

I think this all sounds crazy.. but Im just thinkng on how to come up with a mechanism which would make the wheels steer more! It is not possible to achieve very curvy / angled turns with regular skate trucks!

I believe that spring trucks might elevetate / improve the situation.. but im still not convinced enough, that they work that much better for sharp steering to one of the sides... This would hold especially true for mountainboard with pneumatic tires.. 

Ideally, Imagine something like this ''stroller'' type eboard.. with some sort of ''the wheel'' which helps to move / navigate the wheels on the road!

(Picture / board author unknown :) just picked it up on the net ;) )

With this.. I think steering wobble would also go away.. (at least for the front).. and it would be possible to control the board in more ''precise'' way..

I also do understand that a lot can be changed with different bushing types or hardnesses but somehow the whole regular truck construction, to me, seems like has not taken into consideration the ability to make sharp turns..

 It is either too wobbly or too hard to steer.. (turn) with the regular trucks.

And with spring trucks.. Ive heard it is somewhat hard to ''calibrate'' them in a way, that at low speed it is easy to turn them.. while at high speed it is less easy to turn.. But they do seem to do the job good at tight/ turny steering!

I've also seen ''Other planet's'' trucks.. they also look quite promising and interesting.. here''s the video:

-- What I found interesting is that they mentioned 32 degree angle.. of turning.. I wonder how much angle does skate trucks / sping trucks can get..

Sounds like you are looking for Gullwing Sidwewinder trucks. You can trun very sharp corners with them. 

Evolve Skateboards use a similar setup. I used to own a Bamboo Gen2 and loved carving with it.

But they are made for cruising at relatively low speeds around 20 mph. They get quite unstable when you go faster.

I've heard about them.. but im not sure how easy it is to obtain them.. They also look kind of complicated a bit.. but thanks for pointing out about their turny-ness :slight_smile:

Though, you mention the problem which im facing - you can get good steering at low speeds and then you get a bit dangerous riding / instability at higher speeds..

somehow. in my mind it seems like to achieve high stability and at the same time turnyness at high speed.. there needs to be a way / mechanism which can be controlled precisely.. as needed.. Urethane is too much influenced by the environment / movements of the board.. and just simply surface the board is riding on..

You need to wedge out your trucks. That way you can have them tight but still turn sharp.

Its a personal preference really. You are going to have to wedge them and try it and see. Then if its not enough add more wedge. You can buy them or you can make them from wood. But you will need longer hardware.

I've got emtb personally.. so there's actually a slight wedge already.. and also a bit of an angle for the board in general (similar like, if you mounted trucks at the ends of regular skateboard)..

Though, it still seems not enough.. I've got standard black bushings/urethane.. and if I loosen the kingpin nut or rise the deck higher the board becomes too unstable :confused:

I might try one day with wood.. though Im not sure how close to that I am now lol.. something made out of metal seems better.. and if that swingarm idea would be feasible.. I might as well contact a local welder, who would do something like that for me.. without much cost.. It just needs to be working.. and for the idea itself I might consider doing it..

Making the wedge out of alumnium could also be an option (others have done it before anyways).. So I will definately keep this idea in my mind.

One idea on how the ''swing arm'' could be made:

At the end of the shaft/axle there should be a ''moving'' adapter..after that.. there would be a rod connecting both of these plates.. and then a ''knob'' or stick in the middle.. for adjusting the direction

Dude had a kickstarter for his swing arm trucks.  But you had to buy his complete board, he isn't selling the trucks separate.  And it looks like he's had trouble delivering to his kickstarter backers.

Yep, I found the same board / guy a while ago.. did not know about his kickstarter ''backstage'' but non the less - that is some awesome steering system.. even the wheels looks really badass.. 

Too bad it probably costs quite a lot and there would also be trouble with mounting the motor.. of course, unless someone would come up with a way on how to mount a hub motor onto these points where wheels attach to the arm mechanism.

To update the topic:

I tried to ''switch out'' the front  wedge, I basically just turned it around (in opposite direction) and now instead of making the trucks more ''straight/parallel to the road'' they are now more ''angled'' and turn a lot better!

I can make ''snappy'' turns now.. without any problems + I still got my stability since I did not switch out the rear end risers to the otherside..

--

I must confess that I had been riding with ''too stable'' wedge angle / position all the time!

I could post some pictures of the wedge angle I've got, if there is anyone who would be interested in seeing that!

[Edit]

Look what I found!

Someone has already done it before me, haha!

I bet his board turns way more ''interesting'' than our old / regular skate/spring trucks.. Just not sure whenever this steering is firm enough.. loose steering wouldnt be great either :)

I think that the standard truck design has stood the test of time because it works just fine without any fancy linkages or complications.  You may need to tinker with the odd wedge here and there for specific setups, but if it aint broke don't fix it.

It looks like ''outback'' / ''frankenboards'' also has such steering system.

I imagine they are quite turny.. and in general, these 3 wheeled designs can achieve what is not possible easly for 4 wheel ones..

----

@lowGuido I agree with you that current trucks have been around a long time and they have already been refined pretty much not to search for something new and untested.. but on the other hand, I think to achieve something new or what is not possible with them currently, someone indeed needs to come up (like it has already happened) with different steering systems.. 

They work quite okay as it is.. and there are now more than one version of them - Other planet trucks, Roja's, Gullwinger trucks.. perhaps some more, I believe other planet does not use urethane but thought to mention it anyways.

So I assume there is a bit of choice anyways with what is currently available.

I can show you one more 3 wheeled board and it looks extreme what he can achieve with it.. especially because he has made something like over 50 prototypes and his wheels tilt at an angle, too.. but that's for another time, since we focus more on 4 wheeled board anyways :)

@Flexboardz Bigger picture would be nice. I see that u have tried to 'motorize' the board in the picture.. Any plans to do this for real in real life? 

I think this might be a bit oh hurdle unless hubmotors are used for such 'independant wheel' designs. On the other hand - if u were able to come up with such steering system im sure u will be able to come up with how to attach a motor and  belt there, if hub motors are not used.. (or at least make direct drive with smaller wheel pulley and motor pulley)

This could be a big hit, if made and promoted correctly and wouldnt cost the same as Baja, since price factor is always important..

Your solution looks like would totally minimize the annoying shaking and bumping the whole board up when going over an obstacle with just one wheel or so.

Thanks Okami, I will try to find and post larger pictures of the Flex G2.

For the time being, we are concentrated on launching our electric scooters using the same wheel design (http://flexscoot.com/en/). If we are still alive after that, we will also produce boards for the mountainboard/powerkite market and the Eboards.
Hubmotors are definitely an option but they are not yet available in the right dimension (as far as I know)...we are also looking for a closed sprocket reduction/transmission 

Ideally, I would prefer to sell naked boards so customers can choose their own electric components (as they often know better than me about it)  and keep the price low

You are right about the hubmotors.. as of right now it seems it is hard to find one for 7-9inch tires. Unless it is custom made, of course.

Good to hear about your plans to launch them later on, after u have finished your scooters.

I assume someone will need to stay in touch / in-tune with you guys, to find out all the new info you put out.

Thanks for being on this forum @Flexboardz , non the less :)

Thanks for your welcome message...
I used to "read only"  this forum to follow up the progresses about electric components (also hoping that , one day, someone will wonder about the board design :) ) as I was mainly concentrated on the scooters so I had no relevant news about boards....

 Now, I will introduce myself to the forum members and I might open a post about boards design and stability if it interest the members

Btw, here are pictures of a E-Flexboardz made by a german rider few years ago (2011). It has a chain transmission but he made a real nice job to integrate it

@Flexboardz The ''mechanical'' design is really sleek for that ''model''..

I do remember now that someone from Korea had made some sort of board with fancy steering using hoverboard motors.. it was pretty much ''self made'' from scratch and also had these ''regulation bars'' sticking out from each wheel, if I remember correctly..
 
Though, the user had poor english and these were other members who ''over-published'' the images of his board etc..

---
I wont be able to tell you how much interest there is exactly.. but I do know that with current truck design going over obstacles is not fun.. 

Try to accelerate hard, then let go of the throttle - speed wobble.. Go over obstacles at higher speed/acceleration - wobble.. 

Plus, the turning radius also suffer usually..

So yeah.. not sure if this will reach the masses.. but it should definately ''find home'' to these users, who have had problems with regular skate/spring trucks before and who want something better / different..

---

Sidenote: If the ''legs'' of the wheels could be made foldable, I think this could earn even more attention from these who seek solutions for carrying a board in a car.. i witness it was quite hard sometimes to fit my 1.05m(3.45ft) long board into some car trunks.. without taking off the wheels.. 

At 0.90m (2.95ft) it is still a bit hard but not as bad, as it was for that 1.05m(3.45ft) of total lenght board(motor mount included)

No, it's all mechanical...
it's an independant tilting wheels design so it swallow better the obstacles than a rigid axle ... it only provide a bit of suspension effect (+-1cm stroke) 
The main interest is that it can be maniable at low speed and stable at high speed (no speedwobble). It also provide a better grip.
So basically, it's a much safer board design

When I look at the beginning of the post, I see that it is about a stroller/scooter vehicle that can be ridden like a board, maniable enough for urban use and stable at speed.

In this case, I recommend a delta 3 wheels vehicle (with a aft truck)...it has the manoeuvrability of the handlebar steering at low speed and the carving of the aft truck at speed... I know that the look is a bit...like a scooter but the riding is very different (and very similar to a board).

I don't want to be too promotional but building a scoot like mine (see below) is quite easy... just a bit of laser cutting, folding and welding + a truck and a fork... and the ride is really fun!

The one u showed here looks like a really good solution. I had been thinking about acquiring a 3 wheeled for a while now.. so I assume I should kinda start thinking about saving money for this one lol unless I come up with my own solution to this and find how to make it.

Would u be willing to share the price tag for this one?

If possible a 'bare version' without motor or electronics would also be 'favourable'.

@Flexboardz whats the max speed of that thing in picture is anyways? Do u offer different voltages or the one (36v?) Is good enough already?

## \#30 Posted by: Flexboardz Posted at: 2017-02-17T14:57:40.582Z Reads: 322

I propose different  voltage/ power/wheel size... for the time being a 48V/800w/12" and a 36V/500w/10" (and I plan to make a 24v/250w/9" soon to be legal).

The price of the 36V model is 1349 euros ....

Speed is according to power, 30/35 km for the 36V and 35/40 for the 48V... it's only depends upon the motor/battery power installed. The good thing is that it is safe and stable at these speed or even much faster 

Btw, where are located the majority of forum members (Europe or USA)?

To Okami : don't worry, location of members was simply informational, not commercial.

In the Diy spirit, a frame similar to the flexscoot is quite easy/cheap to make (I can  share drawing for the laser cutting) then you just need to find a mtb truck.

I can see that you entered into an inventory of the different design of trucks, kingpin, cam like OP, channel truck, ackerman style (like roamboard), with suspension (like bajaboard), tiltable wheels like pramash, independant like flexboardz...

Drawing for cad would be great! That would help tremendously!

Yep, there seem to be a variety of truck designs.. as of now tiltable and indendent wheels (like yours @Flexboardz  seems to be the best systems.. 

Havent really check ackerman (roamboard), perhaps I listed them here on thread but just dont know it they are called that way)..

Suspension like baja has is a nice feature but it adds a lot of cost to the build I think.

This is the Cycleboard, they had a kickstarter last summer. Uses a rear hub motor and a lean to steer system. Looks like tie rod assist as well. I wanted to get one to attach my golf bag to, but may go the diy route.

Problem of the tadpole design is the lack of steering angle, limiting the maniability (compared to a delta design that can steer at 90 degres and turn on location).

Delta design is also more stable as weight of rider rest mainly on the aft wheels.

Thanks Okami.
There are 2 types of tricycles, Delta (one front wheel  + 2 rear wheels ) and Tadpole (2 front wheels +1 rear). 
To choose between both designs for stability, the center of gravity has to be closer from the 2 wheels... In the case of a stand up scooter, rider's weight is located mainly on the rear wheels so Delta is better. In addition, delta steering is much simpler compared to Tadpole steering. 
Tadpole (like Piaggio mp3 scooters)  main interest is to prevent fall due to front wheel sliding

Oh I see know :) So yeh, delta design should be ''choosen'' more because of this reason (steering + simplicity)

Have you seen the 2 wheeler design? I think that is also not an bad idea..

They use longer axles by the way so that a Trampa Hub would fit

Yes, I know this design (I've commented this post). Inline wheels boards with caster steering like Vertigo and/or Dirtsurfer (and few others before) are stable at high speed but generally lack of manoeuvrability (large turning radius) and stability at low speed 

 I forgot to mention that Delta rear wheels width can be a problem for kick scooter (pushing foot might hit rear wheel) ...

@Flexboardz Mh.. so from what you are saying it looks like 3 wheeler with delta configuration is the most suitable after all.. (for good maneuvrability and stability).. getting foot in the back wheels should not be a problem when going just with electrical power..

Yes, it did look like it can struggle at slow speed and might not be as stable also.. similar like you cannot go with bicycle really slow

@Maxid Im actuallying imagining that you coukd ''swap out the sides'' and use the 2 wheels for the tail.. though the steering would be weird and probably not safe.. ;D non the less, great find.. hadnt really seen much of these..

Pinterest, besides the (wacky boards or google) also seem to be a good resource for these ''not so common designs''

What I said about tricycle stability is only true at low speed...; At higher speed, non leaning tricycle are very dangerous like the Honda Trike in the 80's

I don't think that would make sense. Havin one non steering fron wheel and steer with two rear wheels will be super difficult to handle. Rear wheel steering is never a good idea - well maybe if you have to maneuver a trailer or something at walking speeds but any faster and you will most definitely crash.

I actually have one of those at home - would just need a second one to actually try this as a skateboard. Unfortunately they still sell on ebay for like 50-100€ - which is too much for a potentially stupid experiment :D
Would love to know how that would feel with Trampa pneumatics

Yeh I assume the wheel cannot really keep up with the speed or such and starts to do ''tail maneuvers'' .. at least that is what comes to mind..

Well, I think for ''general design'' a 40kph capable board should be enough :slight_smile:

That is close to scooter / moped anyways..(related to speed)

And yes.. Tilting should also be included.. so I think it is a shame your kind of boards / design has not gained much more popularity.. (not that you are responsible for that but that people dont really appreciate the benefits.. / or perhaps there's something else in the way, who knows :) / )

@Maxid Yes, the tail / backend steering is no good :) 

IF you got one of these could you do a test and show us how much steering / wheel turning can you do with that ''board'' ?

Reading through this thread, I love the swing arm idea but can't help but think that there has to be a cheaper way to improve steering.
As I understand it, improved (tighter) steering generally comes at the expense of stability, at least at higher speeds. This is part of the cause of speed wobbles. 
For example, I have trampa spring trucks and I could remove the springs from them completely, thus relying solely on tightening the kingpins, and have a drastically tighter turning radius. However, in doing that I had better have excellent balance and coordination in order to keep going in a straight line. Bty, has anyone ever actually tried this? 
It seems to me that a possible solution would be to somehow increase the travel of the trucks (how much they can be angled left and right) and carefully adjust the resistance to such turns. This would ensure that you can make a tighter turn without too much having to fight the elasticity of the bushings or springs trying to return the trucks to center position.
Using the trampa trucks example, say I use weaker springs than the standard trampa ones, and at the same time I tighten the kingpins to the point where I actually have to push firmly against the deck with either my heels or toes to return to center. The tightness between the truck and hanger combined with the relative weakness of the springs should allow me to turn tighter, and return to center, albeit with a bit more physical effort.
Does any of this make sense?
I'm aware that this may sound a bit like that infamous "anti-wobble tech" from a couple of months ago. This is not my intention. The way I see it you can't really have tighter steering without accepting some wobble as well, that's just how the mechanics and physics of the system work.
This is just a way to try to reduce it a little, the trade-off being that the act of steering takes a bit more effort.
I have some vague ideas of how to do this for regular trucks as well, I'll try to sketch them out and post them here.
In short, I think there are ways to efficiently improve steering without completely reinventing the system.

Take the time to look closely at the system that you don't want to reinvent, the skate truck... 
You will see that this design is 150 years old, inspired by horse cart and instable above few dozens of km/h... (and skate forums are full of (unsuccesful) antiwobble skate trucks threads since 20 years)

Ultimately you're right, and I guess it's kind of a case how you can't have everything in one design. Either you get tight steering and more wobble (right?) or better stability and less steering. Can't have it all...
I've actually rethought my approach to swing arm trucks and I'm looking into having a set cnc'd from a design I've been working on (see my thread about it).

With swing arms design (like flexboardz/flexscoot), you can have both maniability and stability as the steering is very progressive around 0 degrés (where wobble happens) and increases when tilting angle increases (tilting angle range is also more important, +- 40 degres than skateboard 's , only +- 15 degres).
So the wobble is supposed to happen at much higher speed than on a regular skateboard (but I've never been fast enough to experience it)

Thanks your kind words.(you can see the various development stages of  the swing arm design and production [Youtube Flexboardz page](https://www.youtube.com/user/Flexboardz/videos))

More that the cost, it was the non availability of factories in Europe that was the problem (first generation of flexboardz takes a lot of production stages which made it complicated/long).

Furthermore, the mountainboarding market crashed in the 2010' so it made it more complicated to find supports to launch a new generation of Flexboardz (designed to be produced locally)...

Basically, making a production of boards needs few tens thousands of Euros or USD for tooling, stocks,... that I don't have.

That's why I've made the Flexscoot range, trying to target it toward people with limited walking abilities (hoping to collect enough pre orders to finance it).

However, now that the E-boards market seems to be picking up, I am considering the problem more closely as the Flex design is really better than the old skate truck when it comes to riding abilities, stability (no wobble), maniability but also improved grip for better control and safety.

The basic idea looks good. If you use regular springs make sure they're bi-directional and can extend/compress enough along with the swing arm. How much width are you putting between the arms?
I've been looking at pictures of the flexboardz system for weeks and I'm still not sure that works with their bushings. Everything looks bolted in place without a way to extend.

Detachable arms- probably, but you might have to take apart part of the suspension system with it. The "axles" for the arms in mine are probably going to be long shoulder screws, so I can simply unscrew them to remove the arms.
Don't forget, you're probably also going to mount the motor on the arms, right?
Adding suspension - do you mean you want a higher ride or a _softer_ ride?
I think I see what you mean with two springs per arm.
Threaded rods could work, but just like with trampa trucks your travel (and steering) will decrease the more you tighten it.
I'm going to try to design mine to simply swap out different tensioned springs.

I get that, I just mean that a lot of thought has to go into choosing the springs themselves. You'll need to get ones that don't need too many turns to increase tension, but are still long enough to have a decent amount of travel.
Depending on how well this works I might start selling in small numbers. 
I don't have money for more than the one prototype set, so it depends on that. If it works and enough people are interested I have a few more features I can add in.
Does anyone know how many of the vendors here in general are doing this as a side business?

Few reminder about the interest of suspension : 1)improving wheel/ground contact to maintain control on the ride 2)protect frame from pick load 3) comfort of the user (vibrations)

The main interest of independant tiltting wheels is definitely to improve the grip (independant wheels) and the stability (no speed wobble if tiltable)...
Suspension of the deck is only a detail as the stroke is limited to 1 to 2cm before bottoming (basically a flexible deck and low pressure tires can do the same).

Last point,make sure that your suspension will not compress on one side when you tilt the deck otherwise,it will limit the steering.

Last last point, the loads are very high with such design and you will need large heavy spring to handle it

At the moment I am working on idea of independent suspension board (kinda similar to baja board). The main problem everyone tries to solve is good turning at low speed and stable (no steer wobbles on high speed) The idea is that for e.g. Baja board uses swing arms and springs/dampas to stabilize steering the problem is the same either carvable at low speed and wobbly at high or no steering at low speed but stable at high speed.

This is possible to solve this problem, but the solving involves active components because passively I don't really imagine how that can be achieved. My idea is to use electric steering dampener from bikes to control the board tilting instead of springs, so that way I can let steer the deck really high level on low speed and resist big changed on higher speeds... But I am just beginner in these kind of suspension designs so I am still learning and reading about it.

To Kug3lis : Baja is designed as a 4WD car (double wishbone suspension, transmission) and ends up with all the defaults of a (RC) 4WD car : heavy,complicated and expensive (almost the price of a real car)....

For me, a board is not a car, it's a simple flexible object that bent to turn like a snowboard (see picture of one of the first proto below)...
That's how I developped the Flexboardz venture with longitudinal swing arms.

The advantage of the longitudinal swing arm/tilting wheels is that there are 2 steering effects like on a bike (wheel rotation + tilting angle that increase the steering). 

So it can turn very tightly (both steering effects add up) and still be stable at speed (wobble happens around 0 degre tilt angle where only 1 steering effect happens)!

What you see is the tension bolt (rod with bushing) who connects board frame and lower part of swing arm.
The swing arm rotates on a crosspiece that steers when the arms moves up and down.

Basically, the parts that you see on the pics ( tension bolt and connection to swing arm), do not move when the arm moves up and down...so it's the upper part of the arm who has to move back and forth and causes steering...

The thing is that with bindings I have no problem to turn as I can lean way more and not fall of like snowboard. But without bindings and with dampas for e.g. On trampa I loose turning or without dampas I lose stability... 

My idea is to make a stable vehicle which I could use on streets without bindings and still control perfectly at low speed... I am riding everyday 12miles to work so... :D

Okay, I think I get it now... when you're finishing a turn the motion of the hanger piece helps "pull" the more extended swing arm back to a neutral position and "extend" the opposite one. The rods are there just to help stabilize it all.
Did I get it right?

Yes, crosspiece = baseplate + "hanger equivalent" and bolt connecting both if +- perpendicular to the ground....there is a rubber part between baseplate and hanger that transmit the load from hanger to baseplate (and absorb vibrations/make suspension).... it also provide "return to zero" effect to bring the board back to position

You can experiment the double steering effect with a bicycle : steer the handlebar at a fixed angle and walk with the bike in vertical position to make a complete circle... then do the same with the bicycle leaned (same steering of handlebar) and you will see that the radius is smaller...

Motorcycles turn correctly at low speed...it's a bit more complicated as boards do not have handlebar but you can see on the video below the turning radius .Note that this generation of board had a long wheel base   which is not good for maniability. Présent generation is shorter and can turn more tightly if needed

Not really. The cantilevered position of the swing arms creates a lot of bending stress on the baseplate/deck...BMW Streetcarver had such design : baseplates were massive and heavy  to handle loads and it still needed special deck  to resit to the bending stress.

The interest of the Flexboardz is to balance/cancel the heavy loads coming from the swing arms on both side...so it can still be light and flexible 

The truck+deck design has been imposed by skateboard history but it really limits a lot potential board performances.

I always wondered why they where built like that. I have some pantera trucks like that, basically streetcarver copies, I was hoping to try putting them on a regular deck.

Maybe true, but at the same time the system allows for a lot of mixing and matching of components.

Agree for the convenience of  mixing of truck/deck but not at the cost of performances.

The pleasure of deck/truck/bushing/wheel design is also very familiar and affective to me but when it's really old fashioned, we have to face reality ...

A new board design can really bring much better performances, specially for Eboards!

Okay, but performance is kind of subjective depending on the person. 
For the sake of argument, my personal ideal is an agile lightweight frame that is relatively compact and and can take corners very tightly at low to medium speed. Thus I'll want a reasonably short board, say 36-38 inches, and air filled tires. Basically, good for off-road, not bad for on road.
On the other hand, someone who is all about speed and downhill racing (for example) will likely want a longer deck for stability at higher speeds and smaller wheels.
There's also the fact that if you're selling a complete board price goes up, size and shipping go up too, unless maybe you sell it as a kit.
Question: does this mean that you're developing a custom deck to go with the trucks?
I've seen that you used to have a few different size versions of this, will that be the case now? Because one size will likely not fit all...

There are few technical performances of a board design that can be measured and compared (assuming same length/size of wheels)...

As you said, maniability (minimum turning radius) is very important for urban use. It can be easily measured and compared.
Stability at speed, speed wobble, easiness of control, ... is a bit more technical but is now quite documented.
Grip, adherence, (ability to turn without sliding) is also quite documented by automobile industry ...Rigid steering axle like skateboards are not know for high performance

At the end, you can summarize the performance of a design under an "operating range" (what it can do) see below![optech1|666x500](upload://5KOg4HuFfmtI0ud16soYhczPFSV.png)

So I'm starting to get quotes for CNCing a pair of baseplates and four swing arms, and the lowest so far is $1324 (yes, dollars)!
I will see about just doing the baseplates and using the arms from the monster board I took apart, but it's still prohibitively expensive.
Since I would like to make one of these regardless @Flexboardz what would it cost for you to do a small run of these? What would the minimum amount be?

Agree with the high range of price for a cnc board...(swing arms make it more costly than a skate truck)

In order to make boards at a reasonable/competitive price, it needs to make molds for aluminium casting and work with foundry who request minimum quantity...

Same for wheels and accessories who request minimum quantity to have wholesales price.

In the 2000's when I made Flexboardz, minimum quantity requested by factories was around 500 boards (300 if you really made them cry)...and the factories were only available in Asia (I am in France) which added long delays( 6 months) and sometimes quality problems. 

Now, things have improved a bit (there are smaller factories available in Europe) and minimum quantity have lowered so I think that the minimum quantity to produce an original design of board is around 100 units...

I hope that I answered your question...but it really depends upon your design

Another way is to use/modify existing cheap parts... I tried to use bicycle crank at the beginning  (see below :) )

Last, I never experienced it myself, but "theoretically", home made aluminium sand casting can be a really cheap way to make your parts

That looks pretty good! How well did it work?
I've never done sandcasting or any foundry work, I'd probably want to start with something simpler than this though.
I understand the problem of minimum quantity, I've been getting told the same thing- the fewer the parts, the more expensive each one is, especially for Cnc. I'm looking into adapting my design for a three axis mill, rather than five.
This is why I asked earlier why you don't make it as a kit? That way you only need to supply the specialized parts, and let buyers choose their own wheels, tires (deck?) etc.

It worked very well commercially but was a nightmare regarding production (I was constantly out of stock, waiting for next production).

This is probably not the answer most people are hoping for, but the truth of the matter is that mountainboards are ass for turning due to their inherent design flaws.

Problem 1.Their use of super wide trucks means you're unable to put your weight over the wheels when you lean the board into a turn. This forces you to throw your weight around in order to get them to turn. 

This is why narrower trucks are taking over the DH scene. Narrower trucks means wheels further under your feet. Wheels further under your feet = more weight over the wheel. More weight over the wheel = more turning responsiveness.

Problem 2. These Mountainboard decks are "dropped"... meaning you have minimal leverage over the pivot point of your trucks.

That's why top-mount is preferred over drop-through/drop decks for carvy longboard setups. That increased height over the pivot point of the trucks allows for more leverage which in turn allows for more responsive easier turning

We need a new deck that doesn't have a drop. We also need a deck that can accommodate narrower trucks equipped with AT tires.

This looks like really nice build / design.

 Do the center point, where "arms" are connected, also 'swivel' / move around or not?

I assume it would be nice to mess around with parts and try to create something similar. Would take some time of course but if the end design works that would be really nice.

Also - about the wheels - are these pneumatics taken from rollerblades or u got them elsewhere?

I think what would work best would be to make a couple comparison videos between swing arm "trucks" and regular skate or spring trucks.

What would be interesting to see would be the turning radius for these setups also. Though agility and stability would probably be biggest factors as turning radius can vary a lot based on setup, wheels etc.

Havent really checked your youtube channel, maybe uve got something like that already.. though I think there needs to be some 'promo' materials to better convince and more importantly introduce people to this steering mechanism and whole concept.

Of course there have been a few examples out in the world already but maybe, somehow this could gain enough momentum to be run as a test with enough willing "participants" closely enough to get and try or this steering design themselves.

For now only disadvantage I see is extra lenght for board and probably extra weight due to more material used

You can still see the videos on the Youtube channel (it's from the 2000's so quality is not perfect).

On the 2nd generation, I moved the crosspiece under the deck so the wheelbase is not longer than regular mtb anymore (even a bit shorter as wheels don't move like on mtb with risk of touching feet).

Extra weight of additional parts (arms) is compensated by ligther deck due to structural effect....2nd generation is 5.5 kg, in line with competition.

Very nice concept and these look to be well executed, wish you luck with getting these out to production. 

It looks to me from the posted pics that both the steering arms are the same length, meaning that both wheels steer at the same angle, have you thought about compensating for the Ackerman angle by using different length steering arms? That would solve an inherint problem with all currently available truck design.

Looks cool. 👍 Interested in seeing how a drive system will hook up to it, how the moving parts hold up over time and stability over 70kph. 

Ackerman should be built In to the steering arm angle from the spindle to the drag link.   Different length drag link to kingpin width. Looks symmetrical (zero Ackermann) 

Also the spindle does not rotate on center. Interested in how this changes performance. 

Zero caster is an unstable trait with a spindle/kingpin steering system (keeping wheel surfaces parallel to the road surface) .  Curious about the castor angle and how the camber change effects corner grip in a turn without flat contact patches 
,  wheel surface to ground.

[/quote]

By having the spindle rotation center fixed to the hanger rather than centerline of the spindle, when lateral forces are applied to the spindle it will create an Input force on the draglink parallel with input force from the steerng pitman arm.  Meaning as you Increase lateral force the return to center feel will decrease.
Just curious how this will change feedback and stability.  Would definitely decrease Input force from the rider in a hard turn. If setup is right it could act like power steering. Counter intuitive to what would be a stability trait.

Mate, Moe is like a grand master of longboard truck design, not just a techie :) 

Anyway, good luck surviving when master Pramash with Lean Boards sees your design and decides to try and sue you. He was quite hostile on this forum as far as I remember.

I would say forum is a lot less hostile than many others and gets to keep being friendly enough even for many 'noob' questions

No, I havent :D i think this place is really great in general. Naturally, there will always be someone on the sour side, but overall its awesome possum in here

I don't think the leanboard guy is coming back to try and sue anyone, last time he tried to comment in a thread asserting that there were similarities between his product and another members... It didn't work out too well for him 😂

Cool @Russell, as soon as I saw your design I thought of this as a perfect Ackerman solution, you are correct that it has a small effect on a short axle skateboard, but it is present and would be good to eliminate, your design could easily do this as you already know.
As per Moestooges comments, I'm also a bit lost, _way_ above my pay grade, but I think he is saying that the lateral forces induced by cornering will also create a positive steering input. This may not be a bad thing in practice and could help iron out the deck angle vs turning radius curve allowing one to use harder bushings for more stability at center. At the end of day only testing would suffice to show this.
I think this is a good design, there is also a possibility to mount a linear steering damper diagonally across the steering arms, apart from one major flaw, make it so we can mount motors!! :grin:
Out of interest, as you have patented these, why can you not produce them? Production costs?

Cost, really can't help here, that is really going to a factor of your manufacturing costs plus whatever business running costs you are going to incur with whatever profit on top the market will endure. But as with everything, the cheaper you sell them the more you'll sell. Are these cast or CNCd, that would also be a big factor, like how much are a set of surfrods?
I'd say a good bet would also to be to get a few out in the wild first for some independent reviews, not paid shills, you could then guage possible demand based on the feedback and price accordingly.
Another thing I've seen here on this site is limited run group buys where people can pre-order from a limited run, when the limited run numbers are committed to then production starts. Although with no obvious motor mount solution currently with these trucks, maybe there are other sites were this could work?

maybe make a separate Major Arc trucks thread? these trucks are really interesting

Hey Buddy,
How about this: 

Put an encoder on each motor wheel.

Have at least 2 but better yet 4 motor wheels.

This means 2 or 4 seperate controller units.

So basically, when you want to turn, you either turn the motor wheels slower or faster on 1 side of the board relative to the wheels on the other side.

Kind of like a tank turns, but without the treads.

I'm sure it would work. You'd want to try a few different algorithms. For example a protocol for steering while accelerating and another slightly different for storing during deceleration. Possibly dependent on speed at the time the when the steering maneuver is requested by the user. 

In case you arent familiar with encoders, they have like 3600 evenly spaced marks around a disk. (Could be any number, but 3600 means 10 Mark's per degree.)

So when you want to go straight, the controllers try to keep all of the wheels counting the same number of pulses fr ok m the encoder which means there go in ng the same speed.

When you want to turn, it uses a loop control system to speed up or slow down the number of encoder counts of the wheel or wheels on one side of the board. 
Or possibly speeds up on one side and slows down on the other side. 


It would be like a proportional change. This wo UK ld accomplish steering without the need for any new hardware. Would take a little new programming to or maybe an arduino microcontroller or something and the 2 or 4 encoders. 

You could probably use lower cost encoders with only like 360 or maybe less Mark's per revolution.

Furthermore, in the vesc tool, there is an option to use encoders. I wouldnt be surprised if you could implement the whole thing with the encoders and the vesc tool and a joystick for the steering.

Say trigger finger for throttle and a th un mb jo thg stick for steering.

The fact that nobody had put hub motors on yet makes me sad.

Motor mount/gearbox could be integrated as well

Just saw this:

There's an in-depth video from Fabi:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScQgH-ZNiwE&feature=push-fr&attr_tag=ph0dCnhknIcyE34E%3A6

Would be curious to know whenever real damper/spring can be put there, I somehow dislike flexy decks as the first deck I had bounced on every little bump the road had and messed with stability and steering for me.
