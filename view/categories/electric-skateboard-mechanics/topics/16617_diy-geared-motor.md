HEy guys,
Is there anyone who made DIY geared hub motors? Something like STARY motors...I am just planning to make one (or two :P ) so I am wondering if there is anyone, I could learn from.

P.S. Sorry for my English :D

I could be wrong but i think Stary is the only company to even make a geared hub motor.  I dont think anyone else has made one yet.

@barajabali is right. However there are now systems not using belts but direct drives. look at @captainjez oder @esk8's topics on this

Yeah, their way is quite interesting, but still I want to get the motor inside the wheel to make it completely stealth.

CARVON is the really the only viable and available set up at the moment...though they are technically not hub wheels
Personal opinion
