Hey guys does someone know a cheap solution to mount my focboxes on a Trampa Deck?
I want to put them like common on the back where the motors are.

My thoughts were making a plate out of metal and mount it where the screws for the trucks are on the top, maybe there is sth I can buy, too. I only can find 3d printed enclosures but I dont think they are stable enough just lookin good.
Jeah thanks for any help!

What @Skunk linked just to be recommended.
Something better you canâ€™t get I think, but
I love my 3D printed one...cheap and in PETG they work pretty good.
