Hi I have a aps 6374 motor with a groove down the shaft.
I want to mount my pulley in the shaft, I have read that the pulley that fits on the shaft has a keyway?

How do I mount the pulley to the shaft with the small piece of metal(I think that might be called a keyway?)

Thanks üëç

If your Pulley have a Keyway too then you just add the Key and you are done.
Secure it with Loctide.
Maybe a grubscrew too.

Put the key on the slot in the motor shaft and then slide the pulley onto it?
