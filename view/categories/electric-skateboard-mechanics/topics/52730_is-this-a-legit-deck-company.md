I am leaning towards this deck however i have never heard of this company called moose.
https://jet.com/product/Longboard-Deck-Freestyle-95-x-42-Canadian-Maple-Natural/81f1ad5024ca4d6eb21497d50ffa4340

Hopefully someone can tell me if this is legit or not.

A company that makes blank decks is subjective...while moose is not a skate company with graphics and riders, their decks are above average quality..

jet.com is not a legit skate company because they sell snacks, cleaning supplies, luggage, and vacuums.  Moose is.
