I am wondering which tools you use or how you shorten the chain for your chain driven boards. I cannot find any specific tool for iso6b chains. And I am not sure  the tool for bicycles (forgot the tool name) will work (forgot the tool name) with an iso6b chain...

you need to use a Dremel, super easy and quick.

Isn't there some type of 'derive chaine' for iso6b? I don't need to cut the chain only need to make the right size to fit the wheel and chain sprockets.

Will try to find the link again.
It works for me with iso 06b chains.
If you just need to shorten it I would use a dremel too. Probably faster.

You have chain links to connect the chain after you made them the right size?

Yes, I do. At least I think so. Need to double check. But maybe @okp can confirm as I bought the chains from him.

yeah always. Now I pack most of the stuff myself and triple check the quality and assembly. I usually also put more stuff than required to enhance the experience.

Yeah , i am fully confident when ordering from Unikboards .Always helpful , kind and only selling quality parts. I started esk8 because i saw vids of @okp and @Nowind about a year ago. In the meantime i've build at least 3 boards . I am finishing my Trampa (hopefully this week) and just ordered a Kut thaka to electrify this summer :slight_smile:

Any idea if i could fit a 10s3p on this deck? I think the wheelbase is about 44cm which looks rather small to fit a 10s3p , a dual motor config and 2 vescs...

Yes i used the one I linked.
Itâ€™s a bit triggy because I think itâ€™s not made for this size of chains but it worked for me in the end. It was first time i used this tool and chains in general, so if you already experienced with removing the splint it could be an easy thing for you to use it. 
I was afraid pressing the chain together instead of pressing out the splint. But there is no need to worry with it ðŸ˜…

@Riako I know you have a few chain drive builts. How did you manage to adapt your chain size without a chain link removal tool?

I was going to check with my local motorbike shop because if they could do it because if i need to order the link removal tool i will have to wait another week or 2-3....

I tried first the tool i said didnâ€™t work out.
With it i just pressed the chain together.
Then I ordered the one which works.
Inbetween i wanted to get one chain repaired and for this I asked at the local bicycle shop.
They managed to help me for a small payment.
Shouldnâ€™t be a big issue for shops like this shorten the chain.

I use a grinder ^^ and then a screwdriver to make leverage.

We did a mini-take off tuto with Yann : 
https://www.overion.fr/2018/06/12/raccourcir-une-chaine-avec-les-moyens-du-bord/

Same system with a little "grinder" this time (AARG Google translate use Grinder for disqeuse and touret Ã  meuler ... sorry).
