Hey guys, 

Im looking to add a BMS into my build so i dont have to keep taking my batteries out to charge them. 

Can anyone recommend a BMS for my dual Graphene Panther 5000mAh 4S setup?

Thanks

You use only 4s? Or wired up more packs to 8s or 12s?

id say get two 5s to get 10s. what kind of esc you're using? if you use vesv then you should just wire so that the bms only balance charge.

I think these ones are great bms but I'm not too sure. Thingy is you have a power adapter that have the correct voltage for 8s*4.2v (voltage per cell) = 33.6 V. Most electric skateboard use 42v which are for 10s. I don't know if 42v power adapter able to charge your 8s.
