Forget batteries for a second. Taking in mind the common limits of FOCBOXES ERPM, what is the ultimate component part combination for a Belt Drive?

What do you mean by 

[quote="Jc06505n, post:1, topic:47916"]
the ultimate component part combination
[/quote]

If you mean motor kV and gear ratio, I think it's 170~190kv 12s 16/36 gear. Seems to be standard :lying_face:

I mean part wise , what motor mounts seem to be better than others for the job? What trucks ? What motors and what brand ? 

I see a lot of variation between people building and mounting Belt Drives , yet no debate about the best part combination. 

Would what you send be also optimal for 10s?

caliber is not very good, especially for electric longboard. ronins are miles better even without a motor, but with torque on wheels they are just another league because you wont introduce steering impulses when you accelerate/brake due to their support pin.

Subjectivity is needed ! Riot! Throw each other to the slaughter ! The most powerful think about this builders that Iâ€™ve seen is when someone throw you all in a thread and you fight over whatâ€™s better. A few revelations comes out and a better understanding is spread as a result. 

Basically , when you guys go to war against each other , everyone profits with some knowledge.

talking about ronin cast, its hardly another price grp - pair of calibers 60â‚¬, pair of ronins 90â‚¬. that difference doent matter a single bit in a 1000â‚¬+ build and it will massively influence your ride and handling quality!

Depends on the person, you would also add more to mounts as well.

A pair of Calibers can be found for 48 Euro here, a pair of Ronin would be 104 Euro.

Ive made / currently making a 1300ish Euro board atm, and i wouldnt be able to afford paying 40 more for trucks and then having to struggle with finding mounts over seas.

I have a dual rear belt with 190kv 6355s at 10s and it has more than enough power down low and mid range for me at 16:36 gearing on 90mm popocas. I've always wanted a Metroboard dual diagonal build so now I'm compromising anf building my own dual diagonal with a bunch of parts laying around but it'll be dual diagonal 140kv 5065s at 10s 16:36 on 97mm clones. It should be a competent hill climber for sure.

the evolve truck (basically gullwing sidewinders) are literally the worst trucks i know. such a wobbly imprecise mess! they might feel surfy on a foot powered board (even though they make a board too high for reasonable pushing), but they are really not meant to go fast. :see_no_evil:

While I can appreciate the gist of this statement, I use my boards for commuting (they are tools, not toys) and I really don't want to go over about 28mph anyway, and try to gear them so that's a top speed and put any extra power into torque/hill-climb.  Coincidentally, this is the approximate top speed of those trucks before they start to get unstable if you exceed that.  It's a perfect union of carviness and stability.  If you want to go over 30mph, they aren't for you....

30mph sounds borderline with these trucks unless you did the same stuff like i did: deadening the dual kingpin with stiffer bushings. i rode my evolve 2 years and i never looked back - 3years later i stepped on a gt and just couldnt understand anymore how one can deliberately choose these trucks :joy:

I will put a vote in for @marcmt88 mounts, on @torqueboards  TB218's (good for large dual setups) The Ronin's with Ollin mounts is pretty sexy but I don't like the dual diagonal setups.

Riot plugs with caliber trucks are pretty ðŸ”¥ 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/4l4l7q/gear_rogue_trucksriot_plugs/

Basically helps to eliminate the gap/slop between the kingpin and the hanger. When put on Calibers, the centerpoint becomes very defined like a Ronin truck.

Also y'all are spoiled with this truck stability thing. I take TKP trucks past 20mph pretty regularly without issue. Any RKP trucks out there (Calibers, Paris, cRonins, cRogues, Randals, Bears, Atlas, etc.) will do fine on an esk8 as long as you build up your ankle muscles. Get high rebound bushings like Riptide APS in order to eliminate speed wobbles...


**Edit:** Forgot to add. Calibers ship stock with 'insert barrel' bushings which pretty much do exactly what was mentioned above for the Riot Plugs at perhaps a slight cost of more restriction. From the getgo they're more rigid and precise than other trucks on the market for that very reason.

stock calibers are fine to any speed, but they dont carve beautifully. ronins are much more precise at small lean, but feel still alot less linear and boring when carved hard. this discussion has nothing to do with being spoilt, Ive ran nearly every truck on the market including 250â‚¬ precision trucks on the quest to find the best setup for speed and carving and ronins were by far the most fun trucks in basicslly all regards and cast ronins are truly unrivaled in the value for money point.

about plugs: Ive got a few dont trip trucks with spherical kingpin bearing, now thats true precision around the turning point, really sensitive and great feel, using them on my pump setup .. but value for money ratio is clearly in favour of cronins.

I'm not referring to you, as much as I'm referring everyone else. Trucks are a preference. Bushings control the ride. If you have Paris trucks, then there's a bushing setup that makes them perform well at speed. Same deal for every other truck out there. I'm not of the belief that one should drop their current trucks and go for Ronins as an end all be all. I much prefer they invest in extra sets of bushings and dial in their setup. If they want 'better' trucks, then they always have the option down the road.

If you really like Don't Trips and their insert bushing setups, then why not give cast Rogues a shot? They should be very similar to Ronins but slightly more linear due to this lower rake (2mm cast Rogues vs 7mm cast Ronins vs 5mm precision Ronins).

Cast Rogues are arguably the best price/performance trucks that make use of insert bushings (same thing as the Don't Trips and Buzzed trucks). Just like Ronins, they don't have/need a bushing seat because of their extremely defined centerpoint, so they posses absurd amounts of lean.

i found my trucks after more than 5years of playing around with every variable there is! think the concept of the supportpin is simple, genious, and absolutely ideal for powered wheels! :slight_smile:

dialing in bushings is mandatory for all trucks, im not running stock bushings in my ronins either. 93A riptide boardside and 87A riptide crank roadside works on nearly all trucks for my preferred speed and carving style somehow.

the ldp dont trips dont have inserts, but a real spherical bearing, which is quite a precision/slop step up to abything i ran until then.

I will, it will be a segmented enclosure like on my last trampa - but Ill do it in a more proper way this time - learning 3D modelling, carving a mold with my cnc router that i still have to finish building, then using that polished mold for a real precision and high gloss carbon enclosure with resin infusion that basically covers the whole vanguard without having an impact on its flex. its still a long way, but this build will be a step up from anything ive done until then. :sunglasses:

rough sketch: 7 segments, 2x3 on each trucks side for 2x7P battery elements, middle is a more flat segment for 2x vesc6.

High voltage seems the way to go. 
A bit off topic but the new Porsche Mission-E is built on a 800V Platform, highest yet for an EV...

How does it handle the high ERPMs? Not regarding DRV errors or faults but rather the Efficieny at high speeds compared to 12s or even 10s 
It might be difficult to tell i guess..

The build before this he was running 12s4p and averaging 16-18 miles on the 30q pack.

This is a 13s4p. Averaging 25-30miles on a 30q pack with only 4 more cells. And motor amps are significantly lower across the board.  Both builds we're electronically identical. 

The old build had 16/40T on 12s... So 2.5 reduction compared to the15/36t 2.4 reduction on the Evo bot same wheels (107s)

So I would say that the voltage has a greater part of that then the 15wH of cells added.. as the reduction on this build should use more power... But the voltage increase has affected the range drastically (an entire boosted board ride worth extra).

When I'm referring to insert bushings, I am **not** referring to Riot Plugs. The cast Rogues use the exact same insert bushings as the Don't Trips. In fact you can use Riptide's Kore insert bushings, which is compatible with both trucks.

In that case, Rogue bring a lot to the table for $60 by sporting the same level of 'precision' as Don't Trips, given all the 'precision' is reliant on the insert bushing rather than the casting quality.

insert bushings are not spherical bearings and rogue trucks seem to use inserts while dont trip use bearings?

i know all these things and tried most of it in my older ldp days (tracker bennet trucks, i actually made inserts myself vefore riptide and riot picked up on it - it was quite common in the ldp community) before i went more on more on motors, dont trip use spherical bearings and, if you want to introduce more slop, you can downgrade the bearings to bushings (which nobody does).

this is a spherical bearing:

Ahh, so that solves the confusion. So then my question becomes, why not adapt spherical bearings to the Rogues? People have adapted spherical bearings to Bennetts in the past.

my 12s4p has also been giving me great milage, Wednesday night we rode around the city for 27 miles before getting back to the car and i still had 12% battery. Last night we rode 15 miles but my buddies GTX died on him so we towed him back and i still had 55% but thats cruising on a group ride if i ride really hard all the time 18-20mile range. this is dual 6374 with 12mm belts 16/36t gearing 107 wheels

@Deckoz board is much more powerful than mine i cant image how fast it is and he must ride like a mad man haha

Not a fan of tails or kicktails or anything like it, never using it either.

Have you ever actually used a board with a kicktail?

Like really used it -- more than "rode it once, wasn't experienced enough to know how use it yet"

The unik board I have now also have what could be used as a small kicktail, I really don't use that sort of stuff.

I cruise on mine and where i cruise i can turn without using a kt no problem

A "small kicktail" or "can be used as a kicktail" is the same thing as "no kicktail"

That's like saying a kite can be used as an aircraft and then knocking all airplanes because yours was a piece of shit, when in reality, yours wasn't a real airplane and isn't comparable.

So, you've never used one.  Please don't knock 'em if you haven't used them!  :slight_smile:

Like i said before i have, ive had many push boards before i had eboards.

I used to have some cheap double kick board from a local skateshop many years ago and a deck that looks a little like the riptide deck with a massive kicktail.

I never used it.

So I'm trying to figure out the kv of my motors(besides what the website says.  Mainly because the gearing and speed others have posted seems to be higher than what I'm getting with the same setup, if not with a little more buffer because of the 12s6p batteries...  So I've seen a top speed of 60km/hr or 37mph at 95% duty cycle and this was on super smooth flat ground.  Basically seems like it just stops right there.  Seems like others are getting close to 40 or higher.  Anyways. Dual 6374 12s6p 30q. 15/36 on fresh 107mm. The pictures show loaded top (37)speed erpm as well as unloaded erpm full throttle.  So.  Anyone want to help figure out what actual kv is based on the readings?  Unloaded 57289@50.1v. Loaded 50163@46.1![IMG_4470|281x500](upload://6HGuog9opZVzff4IFLi5uuK4Pnm.jpg)![IMG_4473|281x500](upload://4tBZFXvJQ9QvATUhFfDeBTrimxj.jpg)

Based off of that setup I would estimate a kV of around 165-170. I just put in all the non variables in to esk8 calc and then adjusted the kV until it reached ~57k erpm and it was saying 36.9mph and 165kV

Which is what I came up with. But my motors are supposed to be 190kv. I think they were incorrectly rated.

Are you using the right equation?

***Kv = RPM / ( Voltage â€“ ( Current * Rm ) )***
Rm being the motor resistance through one phase

---
The best way to measure kv imo, is to grab a drill and connect it to your motor shaft. Then attach an oscilloscope to two of your phase leads, measure the peak voltage and period of the sine wave then use this equation:

***RPM = ((1/period)*60)/(pole pairs)
Kv = RPM/(peak Voltage * 0.95)***

The 0.95 is a fudge factor used by industry...

---
If you don't have an oscilloscope, you can use a multimeter in ac mode and a tach to measure rpm. The equation you want to use then is:

***Kv = RPM/(Voltage * 1.414 * 0.95)***

The voltage you measure has to be multiplied by 1.414 (square root of 2) because the voltmeter measures rms voltage and not peak to peak. The 0.95 is again, a fudge factor used by industry.

You forgot that your duty cycle is not 100% 
So it's really closer to
Unloaded 57289@47.595V
Loaded 50163@43.795V

But this doesn't take into account losses due to motor resistance as stated in my previous post which I think is the bigger issue

You guys have much bigger balls than I for wanting to 40mph on these boards. 25mph on my board feels like warp speed to me...and I used to race motorcycles.
