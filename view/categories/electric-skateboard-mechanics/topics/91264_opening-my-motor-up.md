I have a pair of these motors and I want to lengthen the phase wires. I really don't want to screw this up some I'm asking: I guess I just undo the grub screws through the three (?) holes through the can (where indicated by the blue box)?

![image|571x445](upload://48wXDHTPL1qBO8LBzUBqhU0HwyN.jpeg) 

Also there is a bit of "slop" on one of the motors (indicated by the red arrows). Not sure why, but maybe something has come loose in the can? I should check for a missing circlip. Really hoping I don't have to find another one :worried:

Thanks!

Regarding slop, there's usually a setscrew or two on the backside of the can, holding the shaft in place. Those can become loose, and cause play.

As for removing the motor can, it should be as easy as removing the four setscrews around the can, and then it's just a matter of a good hard pull to overcome the magnets and the can comes right off. My preferred method is to mount the motor to a piece of material (like a motor mount) clamped in a vise, so I have both hands free to yank on the can.

I'd recommend replacing the setscrews that come with it with some stronger grade 12.9 ones, and installing them with a dab of blue threadlocker. That will prevent them from stripping if you ever need to get into it again, and keep them from working loose on their own over time. Cheap mods, but very helpful.

Hope there is a setscrew holding the shaft in place cause it's noisy AF at the moment.

If the shaft set screw were loose I’d think the shaft would spin in the motor not being connected.  
If u post a video we could hear the noise. How are the fittings of the shaft and all the bearings?  Maybe looseness there or the bearings are bad could make noise.

I've had a shaft setscrew (riding on flats machined on the shaft) that was loose enough to slide end to end, but not spin more than a few degrees.

I should mention that the can moves back and forward too. I haven't opened the can yet, but suspect a setscrew may not fix it. Happy to be wrong! :)

If the can moves with the shaft, then it's probably a circlip. If the shaft moves relative to the can, then it's a setscrew.

Luckily, circlips can be had cheaply in variety packs from Amazon. You can also buy some shim washers to take up all the slack, I got them from [McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/91437a433).

Be really, really careful putting the can back on.  Screw the stator to a motor mount and hold the motor mount with your hand, not the stator.  It will slam back together VERY hard.

This! Be careful of your delicate fingies, and the delicate magnets. They pinch HARD!

I haven't ever been able to get it to NOT slam.  Do you have any tips?

Clamp that shit down to a 700lb welding table and brace for impact.

I use a skate tool or something sticking through the rotor and then try to ease the stator in.  It slams but not as badly.     I’ve gotten my body stuck in the gap before...stuck where I needed someone else to get me out.  Ouuuwww

with that motor, you see that little brass collar? that needs to sit between your motor pulley and your can. the collar is your circlip. like so

I wedge in bicycle tire lever tools at the can gap and try to slowly pull them out while I try to ease the shaft back, gripping it by padded vice grips. 

“Try” being the operative word. Still better than “sending the bolt home”.
