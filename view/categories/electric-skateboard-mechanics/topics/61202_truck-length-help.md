So I am going to purchase these 83mm hub motors off of amazon and I was wondering the truck size to use for the front. The link to it is below and they also describe some of the dimensions but it might as well be French because I donâ€™t get it. Thank you for your help!

I am 90% sure they would be 180mm trucks
