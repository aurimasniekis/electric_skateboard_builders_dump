Does anyone know what deck he is using, or a similar deck. The deck seems very stiff and solid, but I can be wrong.

Or should I get some other deck?
I will be running 2 sk3 190 6374 motors with probably two graphene professional 6s 15c 12000mah.

Find one you like, or search for enclosures and plan your build around that
