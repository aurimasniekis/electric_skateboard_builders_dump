Hey y'all,

I'm planning on building a better boosted this summer, had my fun with the DIYeBoards 10s5p kit last summer and although I've made some upgrades to it I _**hunger for more**_.

I'm going to base my build off of [Deckoz's](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-vanguard-42-weekend-build/41284/4) build from 2 summers ago as well as Skatemetric's Foosted board.

As my build currently stands its going to use:

Loaded Vanguard Flex 1
Flipsky Dual FSESC4.20 100A
DIY 10s4p battery basically the same as Deckoz's as I know that will fit in the enclosure
Same enclosures as Deckoz's
Flipsky 2.4G Nano Remote
Either the Flipsky 6354 190KV 2450W motors or the 6355 190KV motors from Torqueboards
Generic mounts and pullys (not too worried about this part but I am planning on using [these mounts])(https://www.ebay.com/itm/CNC-motor-mount-for-50-63-motors-for-DIY-eskate-electric-skateboard/302775190943?hash=item467ecec59f:m:ms88LUPN6Vhpnpo8YRvLyng&var=601716797809) 

Where my build differs from Deckoz's build is that I want to use Caliper II trucks like on the Foosted, but my issue is that they're only 184mm wide and I was hoping to use trucks closer to 200mm for stability, what trucks do you all use that are closer to 200mm in size that can mount a... mount?

I've been looking around and it appears that almost all mounts are built for Caliper trucks as they have the cornered design that allows the clamp to grip. Are there other trucks that I'm missing out on?

Thanks for any help you can provide, really excited to finally build a full board from scratch!

What everyone else said surf rodz.  They are precision trucks so they are the best 200mm trucks.  If you dont want to spend that much.  There are the torqueboard trucks and the ecalibers although these have the same 184mm hanger but have extended axels.

Surfodz with press fit mounts. Press fit mounts are maintenance free so you never need to worry about them moving or coming loose.  Before I used TB218's which were good but the sufrodz are massive step up in terms of  stability, and good value for what you get.

Yah I know they're pricey and not Caliber, but Surf Rodz are well worth the money, especially with good bushings and cups.

That post had some good info, according to it, looks like the 4.20 versions cant keep up with 10s battery configs which is good to know. And since im not looking to buy a FOCBOX Unity for $500 CAD ill stick with the 4.12 single since that only adds about $30 to the overall cost compared to the 4.20 dual. But at this price point they now match with the Torqueboards ESC, should I hop over to torqueboards since i'll also be buying my motors from there? It also seems like torqueboard parts are more reliable.

@Skunk @yelnats8j @briman05 @moon @Itsmedant @lrdesigns @Saturn_Corp

The surfrodz look :ok_hand::ok_hand::call_me_hand::call_me_hand: beautiful and I love em but there's an issue. I'm up in the great white north and they basically don't exist here. And I think that because of this, and although the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive for the surfrodz, I'll have to stick with the Caliber since I can actually find them in Canada and the mounting for them is more common. I still have some skate shops I can check out but I doubt they'll have them.

I'm in Toronto and shipping can be pretty bad. On top of the $160 US price tag and tax and possible duty, I'm looking at possibly between $200 to $300 CAD :sob: depending if I get nailed at customs, in contrast I can get the Caliber II's for $90 CAD tax included. From a local skate shop.

From what I have heard, TB 4.12 doesn't support FOC that well. And ppl have used the FS 4.12 on FOC on reasonable settings. Probably like 30A motor max on those. IDK

Hey @trampa, what's the axle width on these badboys? Do you get 50mm axle on each side of the hanger (41.75 cm)?

Ah. Your site is a bit misleading then. It says ***Hanger measures 12.5 Inch wide.***
Thanks for the clarification.
