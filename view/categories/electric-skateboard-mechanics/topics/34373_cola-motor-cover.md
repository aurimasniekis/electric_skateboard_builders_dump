I used the cola can to protect motor bottom.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/2/729f4d6b0d705ba249ea480730b10a33453af222.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/e/7e28e5d898a4b08ae84a1ee2794eb7393cf2f45f.jpg" width="666" height="499">

I have to say, I haven‚Äôt seen that before! I love seeing stuff like this, something different üëç

On a side note, you motor mount in on backwards, is flip it around.

Yes the mount is on backwards but the bolts are oriented correctly :D with the nut facing towards the kingpin 

Other than that, pretty cool. Does it wobble?

I did it on purpose. Because my pulley set screw position.
You can check the pulley size.
Normal motor mount cannot fit this pulley

This is genius. You think there would be enough air flow?
