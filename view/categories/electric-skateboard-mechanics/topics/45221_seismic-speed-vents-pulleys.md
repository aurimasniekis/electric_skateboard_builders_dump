Well, i just figured out something awesome.

[PulseBoards](https://www.pulseboards.com/) used seismic speed vents on their custom belt drive. [Look at those cores...](https://imgur.com/a/6rYKD)

[Here is a video of the board with the speed vents...](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ47TxFBHLl/?taken-by=pulseboards)



Thats the first time ive heard a company invent their own unique pulley system for a specific set of wheels.... AWESOME, imagine the possibilities...


i hope i get to test these out :D

hubs for now. belts in the future. Everythings quickswappable with a 9-pin connector. You will be able to switch between belt and hub VESC motor configs using their app

You can use either 73mm, 77mm, 78mm, 85mm

If you have to ask this...you must not have ever longboarded at high speeds. For esk8 it means nothing mostly because we're all slow. But the vents in the hub keep the thane cool when sliding so you don't delaminate from the hub. Solid core wheels delam pretty easily at high speeds.

Although ill give you the benefit of the doubt as your responding to @ZackoryCramer ..the man who sits on the backside of his board instead of the front..

No idea. When pulse releases their custom belt drive, they will be released with these custom pulleys and 85mm 75a seismic wheels. I dont think i can get a schematic, as i heard something about ‚Äúpatents‚Äù. I might be wrong, tho

thinks they are out there but no one actually has a link or even a picture so..vaporware?

@squishy654 Here is an old picture, the parent company of alien power systems called alien drive systems used to make them a long time ago, back when flier esc-s where the jam. I have some red chinese clone wheels, 87mm that i bought from ebay and they seem to have speedvent cores, i could make some measurements if someone is willing to design a pulley. Although they could be different from the genuine ones.

But are they still speed vents if the speed vents are blocked by the pulley?

What :joy: those are speedvent pulleys. Have you seen a speedvent wheel in person? They dont fit into the small core holes but they lock on the outer plastic ring that is a part of the core, and are clamped with bolts going through the small holes. Maybe you meant to say it is a aluminium adapter for the screw on pulley part :thinking:

I can get them sent to the CNC shop but they might take a while and will also need an extended axle like e calibers or something

I've not seen many new builds recently without long axles, seems to be the norm now. Especially with all these push fits floating around.

6 months ago we couldn't get a push fit pulley for shit, I'm drowning in them now :man_shrugging:

E-Calibers aren‚Äôt a problem. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth your time for one off CNC job. 

I‚Äôd be interested though.

Its not an issue for me, Im using these wheels myself, it would be nice to have an alu pulley for it. I can make 3 sets without much stress.

PM me and we can discuss details.
