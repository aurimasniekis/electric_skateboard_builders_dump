This is my first build and I want to go with a single motor setup on caliber II trucks.  From what I have read I think 6374 190kv would be sufficient. I think I would like a sealed can if that will make a difference so it lasts longer.  Can anyone make a recommendation for a reasonably priced sealed motor?  It seems most of the dealers on this forum are out.  What are the thoughts about this one.

If you want a sealed 6374 PM @JLabs, he's got some great motors.

I am planning a lower profille drop through build using 80mm wheels. Would it be smarter of me to use a 5065 motor instead. Would that peovidw me more clearance?  Is the difference significant?
