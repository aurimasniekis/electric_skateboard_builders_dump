Prolly a bad shaft shim.  I had one do that as well, but @torqueboards took care of it ASAP.  Give him a PM and he will sort you out.

@mmaner - Thanks again :slight_smile:

@Parafodas - Send us an email dexter@. We'll replace it for you. We made a modification that utterly failed. We got you covered though.
