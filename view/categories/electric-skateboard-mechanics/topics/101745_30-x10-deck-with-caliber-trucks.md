Hi folks!

I am about to order parts to do my first DIY esk8 and I have doubts about the deck.

I am planning a single belt motor (6380) with Trampa VESC 6, Caliber II trucks, motor mount from Tampa and would like the 120 mm foamies from slick revolution.

Now I have to decide the deck. I would like something sort like as my ride is going to be to work (less than 2 miles), supermarket and meeting friends in town.

Ideally I'd like something like:
[Santa Cruz 30"](https://www.skatehut.co.uk/skateboards/skateboard-decks/santa-cruz-flymensional-preissue-skateboard-deck-10.htm)

But I guess what I need is something like:
[35" longboard](https://www.skatehut.co.uk/longboards/longboard-decks/restless-longboard-deck-splinter-series-bust-35.htm)

What about these ones from slick revolution? 20 quid only..

Thanks!
Nestor

First, figure out an enclosure then build around. 

taken from - @b264

once that's done create a few viable options, then contemplate.

@b264 probably has a perfect enclosure for that setup. (30 inch Santa Cruz)

Thank you both!

I was not concern about the enclosure but about the trunks/wheels size. 

The trampa vesc doesn’t need enclosure I think and I was planning to use something basic for the 2x 6S batteries. 

Anyway I would be interested in seeing @b264 enclosures.

Thanks!

Thank you @SoccerMom_HobbyVan
Yes, that’s exactly what I was planning to do. 
I will contact him in the other forum. 
Thanks!
