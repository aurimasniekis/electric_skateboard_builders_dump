Hello everyone, i lived in Indonesia..
I want to make my one e-board, but it's quite hard for me to get the right spec motor in my country..
I have a bench grinder, that I'm not use to work anymore, is there anyone that have any experience using bench grinder motor as the main power for their e-board?..
Thank you..

I would assume a bench grinder is AC?  That might be difficult, cool if you can make it work.

I turned a angle grinder with a re-purposed carbon fiber wrapped aluminium rotor into a high speed centrifuge once... but as a eSk8 motor? I have been reading a bit over [here](http://www.diyelectriccar.com/forums/showthread.php/overclocking-lower-voltage-motor-6383.html) lately about re-winding motors and using them out side of spec... anything is possible but I'm not sure I see it :neutral_face: at least for low cost I think there will be cheaper options. If you are still looking (old thread) I'd hit XTLA up.
