Hello guys I am new here building my 1st DIY board I want to keep my costs low and would like to use the kit below. Has anyone used a caliber II motor mount kit on this? 

Any help is much appreciated :slight_smile:

You can get a caliber trucks kit for almost the same price with the owlsome bearings.  I got one with blue caliber II's, and 83mm purple flywheels.  It works great!  However, like some of the reviews have stated, the wheels smell like salad.

He is right, just get separate caliber trucks...totally not because I am NOT try to advertise the mounts that I sell...uhhh yeah.

I ordered those same 83mm wheels and yeah they smell absolutely awful. I was surprised how easily I noticed. Also not as soft as I would have liked either.

Thanks guys I ended up purchasing a set of calibers to replace the stock slant trucks. Any recommendation on wheels ?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/b/dba18acb0727d400359e6029ca992acbc524fb83.jpg" width="375" height="500">

@EastLosMike The position of the back truck is switched, turn it around :astonished: The kingpin nut goes outwards from the center of the deck on both pairs, should ride a lot nicer :laughing:

As far as motor KV will I be better off with a 200kv or 140kv:
