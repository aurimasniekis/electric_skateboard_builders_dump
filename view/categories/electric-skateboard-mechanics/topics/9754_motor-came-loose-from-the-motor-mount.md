be careful, I had that happen, and it stripped the SK3 holes. I would recommend putting more loctite, don't use red, cause you will never get that off. Just apply a crap ton to the motor.

I used this: http://www.duratrax.com/accessories/pit/dtxr2010.html 
Maybe if I will use original loctite it will be better
which one of the blue series should I use ?

Did you wait for the loctite to cure? You should wait 24 hours before using it.
