I need a place to put my battery and ESC, I just can not find a nice box that will fit me, also still not sure if I will go with lipo or liion, I didnt find much builds with boxes, all have fancy enclosures
Im not going with enclosure since I think the deck just flexes too much under me and I do not want to risk my battery going up in flames 
Do  you have any recommendations?
Also should I put the ESCs in a different box near the motors because VESS long wires and shit is not the best if Im right?

Im using a b&w 500 outdoor box for the batterie and Im very much pleased with it.
If I was to use vescs I would go with a 206 ultrabox uk.

imo its pleasing to the eye

You can get an ultrabox for about €15 black with a clear lid, very water impermeable

I use an Underwater Kinetics 408 Ultrabox on mine. Plenty of room for cells and electronics, though I guess that really depends on what your final battery configuration will be.

Cool! I use LiPo's so I'm not sure on Li-ion. You'd have to math it out.

yes 54 cells in 6s 9p
you could fit way more than that without the spacers
```

60cells without spacers and a bms? Like the big bestech one 3cm thick 20x15cm?
```

should work just fine 
but just to be on the safe side draw it on paper and then see if it fits
I have never seen a bms in person...

You might struggle with 60 cells and a bestech in the untra box. I’m not saying for sure but it will be very tight. This is the fit in my box and it’s with a much smaller bms

Be aware that mounting such a nice xt90 on top for easy loop key acces is gonna be tricky when a crash happens. If you board rolls over and slides over the ground the loop key thingy will fly of in a second.

Can it fit on top?

Ah yes. I had thought about the different options. I’m in bindings and heel straps so being able to cut the board if there were any problems was a must.

It 100% won’t fit in the sides with 60 cells. It may go on top but i think it will be quite tight.

I have just realized that I can get a 12s 32AH lipo battery for some 240$...
4x 6s multistar 16Ah that is like 1400wh

People dog on the multistar lipos for not being accurate with their discharge rates or capacity, try to get graphene on sale instead

Im aware of that
2c is already 40amps which is like 1/5th of their advertising rate
Also graphene turnigys are better than this but far away from real graphene

Also i need a huge battery like 20ah or close

I have boxes for 3x lipo batterys (5000mah/3S), about 15x23x5.5 cm. Enough room for ESC too. If someone need...
