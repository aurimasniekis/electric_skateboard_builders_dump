topic kind of is self explanatory? why is using threaded inserts the communities top idea of  mounting enclosures rather then just mounting with regualr skate hardware and a washer kind of like how trucks are mounted to deck? the second option just seems way easier but i assume everyone's got a solid reason of using the threaded inserts.

I use skate hardware, as you described, and also some skate hardware made for tail guards or rails as well, including sex bolts which are the inserts you speak of, so if you look into it enough, inserts have been used in skate hardware before electrics came around, it's not a new idea..

I use regulars skate hardware to hold my enclosur the nylon lock nuts never come loose and all I need to remove my enclosure is a regular skate tool.

I use wide thread pan head wood screws, usually 3/4 but sometimes 1/2, depends on the deck.

I don't use skate hardware that goes through because I don't want to see screws on top... And I don't want to have to reapply griptape everytime I need to remove the enclosure to hide the screws...

So I use inserts...and yep.. that's pretty much it lol

Would be a lot of screws...coming through without necessarily a flush spot for the heads..![IMG_20180324_161048-01|394x500](upload://a8ZDNJZDogVJR0MeAqntxDm0Wwr.jpeg)

but i change trucks constantly on my regular skates and that doesnt ruin the grip. i understand not wanting to see the screws but that doesnt really bother me.

I added a note to the end.. but the curve of some decks makes finding a flush spot top and bottom harder.. so not all screw heads where my feet would go would be flat..

Agree completely if you can make it look nice or don't care then just go with bolts all the way through (personally did this for my battery holder, the VESC/receiver holder I used brass inserts so as to not have more holes going all the way through).  For my battery ones they are hidden under my grip tape and I cut away the tape there before to do work on it so it's not really too bad if I need to do that again and replace that one patch of grip tape to keep it looking decent.  Long story short 'do it for looks, do it for life' -Moen

I used threaded inserts in the past, but they're always a pain to work with, the hex slot gets deformed and there's a limit to how much the bolt can be screwed, so its hard to use compressible media like foam to seal the enclosure. That's why i use regular skate hardware now.

Nope. I never have. Just drill, use a counter sink for the head of the insert. Screw in and go. None of the boards I've built or had my hands in a part of building have had the wood inserts back out I always use 10mm depth inserts.

I can make one.  But basically

1. Use masking tape on your enclosure to create straight lines and mark the spots that you want to drill.
2. Drill pilot holes in the enclosure only
3. Lay the enclosure on to the deck, put the drill bit through the pilot hole and spin the drill for half a second to mark the deck with a drill dimple

4. Remove the enclosure, expand the pilot holes to the bolt holes size. Set the enclosure aside
5. Use a collar on your drill bit, with the size drill bit required for the inserts. Place the drill on the pilot dimples you marked, and drill 10mm in to the drill collar
6. Use a counter sink drill bit if your inserts have heads, spin for half a second to counter.
7. Slowly with the proper sized Allen or t handle screw the inserts in until flush
8. Finish filling up the enclosure. Put the bolts though and screw them into the inserts..


DO NOT drill the enclosure and board at the same time, and start with small pilot holes, or your stuff will come out crooked

Edit: if your enclosure has multiple holes like mine. Complete steps 1-2, and then perform steps 3-8 for four of the the front and back holes, to actually mount the enclosure with a couple bolts, then with 4 bolts in, use the pilot holes at step 3 to do the dimples for the rest of the bolts so the dimples are in alignment and the enclosure isn't moving while dimpling, once all the dimples in place then remove and complete the drilling and inserts..

One more note. If you are doing this to a carbon fiber or a full composite deck, you are better off drilling, and using machine threaded inserts. Drill & tap your holes, then put the inserts in, and glue them(super glue or a call/epoxy), as machine threads back out quite easily.

I never have to retighten the inserts. The m4 bolts I loctite during final assembly. 

I use 10mm long inserts. On the boards that are only 10mm thick(vanguard/flex boards and the like) I put the butt of the insert on a die grinder and take them down to 7-8mm, so no I never drill all the way through a deck..

Inserts are fine, but I think t-nuts can be a little bit easier.

Normally inserts are what I use when the material is too thick for a t-nut.

T-nuts have spurs though, to keep them in the wood and keep them from spinning.

And presumingly you'd also grip over them, so even if you didn't have a bolt holding them in they still shouldn't go anywhere.

I'm not drilling holes in the top of my board, so that means an install from the bottom. As these are hammered in. The streets will hammer them out. So no, threaded or bust.

Literally the wood inserts I use are set and forget. I screw them in with no glue and never worry about them again

Nah just over size your holes a bit.

I've done it on everything from vertically laminated bamboo, to composite sandwich boards, to Maple ply, olive wood, and never had any split. The main thing is drilling a hole big enough for the cylinder part of the insert, so only the threads cut and the cylinder isn't pressing the wood outward.

I used these on my board.  However I'm not going to endorse using them because I feel like the wood screw type would make for a easier install.  I basically used @deckoz method because my board doesn't use grip tape and I wasn't willing to drill through the deck completely.  

This type works 100% however the fine threads are hard to start the self tap because they are very fine.  Another issue with the fine threads is choosing the appropriate drill bit.  One size to big and the insert would probably drop right in requiring epoxy.  Drill too small and you can't start the tap.  I'd recommend practice on a dense piece of wood first.  

No glue or epoxy required if done right.  

Also, what's the eBay link to those washer things @Deckoz I need me some.  Just not pink...

I have inserts, or actually immovable hammer-nuts inside of the board, between the veneer layers. That way all you see is holes on bottom and nothing on top.
Downside is that you must have exact lenght bolts, or else you could tighten too much and the top layer goes broken.

No Loctite here. 

The threaded inserts are glued into the deck and were a really tight fit, but I'd still be worried the insert would unthread (from the deck) if I used Loctite on the enclosure screws.

I've not lost a screw, nor have any come loose. My enclosure's a little different though (made from a rubber like polyurethane), it kind of acts as a built in nylock nut.

@psychotiller uses plastic washers. But I wouldn’t used red loctite on the mounting screws use blue. There are inserts that have wood screw outer threads. They are from ez-lok but Inwould still the holes one size bigger so you don’t crack the top veneer. There are other companies that do these inserts with knife edge inserts.

I apply epoxy to the outside of my inserts, then screw them in the deck and let it cure over night.
Next day apply a bit of middle strong loctite to your enclosure screws and mount your enclosure.

Epoxied inserts wont come loose, enclosure wont come loose from vibrations and you´re still able to remove the screws with medium force :slight_smile:

My thoughts are, I think you can definitely get away without thread lock while you're still messing around and getting into the enclosures often.

Its really more a matter of convenience.
If its more inconvenient to have to worry about periodically replacing or re-tightening bolts, use thread lock.

If its more inconvenient to have to deal with fussing to get your bolts out all the time, don't use thread lock.

Ideally you get to the state where its all just working and you're rarely having to mess with it, or open anything up.

If loctite, for removable applications I like this stuff

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001VXRM5Q/ref=twister_B008D6GHY6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

You apply to screw, wait 15 minutes, then you can do a dozen or two mating cycles before it wears out.

The 30ml in the glass jar with the brush in the lid is the boss.

@Deckoz you mentioned using a die grinder to shorten the inserts down to 8mm on a vanguard. I just purchased a vanguard and the inserts/screws you recommended tonight. I don’t own a die grinder nor know how it works. 

Is the process easy to grind down 4 inserts? I’m guessing I’ll need to do the same with the screws right? I’m freaking out bc I attempted to place inserts on my first board and let’s just say it didn’t go smooth. 

You also mention a collar. Is that similar to the drill stop? I was planning on measuring 8mm on the drill bit and marking it with tape. Thoughts?

You should be able to look at how large the insert is and then add that to the size of the rubber gasket and get screws that are slightly larger then that size and you will be fine.

If it’s a weatherstripping gasket the package should tell you how much it compresses too you could also use plastic washers to adjust for the height. Usually it’s between 1/2”-3/4”

Just a random tip for those dealing with screw height.

Order the screw length you need, as well as a hand full of over long screws. Screw the over long screws into a handful of holes to compress the gasket, and the remainder of holes put your correct screw size in. Once all screws are in, remove the overlong screws for shorter screws. ;)

2) The aluminum anodized seating washers look so clean and provide good support to enclosure.
3) Just cool and nice inexpensive upgrade if your desire is a clean stealth look.

Yes. I honestly don’t understand what he is saying and what it helps. 
It doesn’t make sense to me. 
I feel like I’m missing some vital information why you need longer screws for some holes to compress the gasket and some you use the exact length screws and then unscrew the too..... aargh what?

@Deckoz Can you dumb it down for me I guess?

How does this help with screw height I don’t get it? If this helps with screw height how do I order the screw length that I need before the... aargh?!

## \#98 Posted by: Moros Posted at: 2018-09-27T22:10:05.983Z Reads: 261

What he is saying is if you have a gasket under your enclosure it increases the length of the bolt you will need to insert before it can grip on your threaded inserts in the deck.

![](https://4.imimg.com/data4/TD/PM/MY-2836580/rubber-door-gasket-500x500.jpg)

So insert a couple of longer than needed screws around the enclosure and tighten it down to compress the gasket so it now sits tight.
Now the extra space is compressed out of the gasket you can screw the actual size you need in the remaining holes, remove the original longer screws and replace them with the right size too.

If I use longer screws nothing will be compressed since I’m using longer screws. 
It doesn’t start to compress untill it tightens against the enclosure.

I guess the aahh moment will come when I see it?

Wait a minute, he is talking about when you don’t use inserts? Is that it because then it makes sense when the nut tightens it and not the bolt or screw.

That is not the problem, let me illustrate what issue is.


Lets assume () is the gasket and |||| is the board, []---- is the bolt.

Case 1: bolt reaches the threads, but bottoms out.
[]------
  (     )||||
Case 2: bolt never reaches the threads, very hard to put on.
[]---
  (     )||||
Case 3: through bolt, i can engage the threads no problem.
{}---------[]
  (     )||||

See why this is an issue that can't be solved by adding washers? The problem is being able to get the threads started without needing to use a clamp, or not having enough pressure on the gasket.

Of crouse if you have a gasket that bareley compresses then its not an issue. I use foam mats which compress at least 5:1, and that's why using a through bolt works for me.

as @sender said. coarse are good for almost any type of wood, you just have to size and counter sink properly so they don't tear up the surface. They also dont backout on their own.

Finer can be used in wood but must be glued in. Finer is also used on composite boards, like fiberglass and carbon fiber and veneer layers making up entire decks, as the coarse inserts can delaminate these board types.

also a reminder which I think was somewhere in this or another thread. when installing coarse install them with a screw and nut jammed and use the head of the screw to put the insert into the wood. the hexes on the inserts typically strip so easier to just nutjam
