Video will probably explain this better: https://youtu.be/wKdhPxzp8NM

How can I fix this? The motor gear is glued to the motor. I don't want to keep destroying belts like this. Any ideas?

The motor pulley is on backwards, either flip it around or move the mount closer to the kingpin.

You could also use some grub/setscrews which doesn't have a giant head.

You could do what's already been suggested or file the protruding heads down.. flat...

Or flip your motor pulley around and move the mount closer to the wheel :)

Wait! Can't you just move the mount further away from the wheel? Undo the clamping screws on the truck and move it a couple of mm

I would flip the pulley around as suggested by @Jinra and ditch the bolts for grub screws as suggested by @karma
Although, I would get carbon steel grub screws because the socket on stainless grub screws are easy to strip with Allen wrench. Carbon screw don't strip as easily.
Keeping the pulley as close to the motor as possible reduces side load on the motor bearings
