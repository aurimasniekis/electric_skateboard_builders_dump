Tire above has been pressurized to 60psi. 

Now I wait for 2 weeks to receive the other 3 wheels so that I can test it on a board. 
I don't have long axle trucks to properly test the wobble, but I did spin it on a normal truck and didn't notice any wobbling. Can't say anything about balance. How do you guys test for that?

Any comments?

EDIT1:
Modified the part to save plastic

you can eliminate wobble by using some tire pearls - I did that to mine and had no issues with wobble afterwards even on 3D printed hubs.

My experience has been mostly positive with these hubs and tires. I took a slightly different approach to the wheel pulley. I utilized the 3 hub bolts to attach a 3D printed adapter that fits the profile of VEX Robotics versa pulleys. The pulley presses onto the spokes of the adapter and then (3) 8-32 bolts hold the pulley in place. 

I'm running enertion motor mounts with 15T motor pulley and 345-5M-15 belts. The wheels run quite true, I've had them up to 35 mph no problem on 12s5p/FOCBOX. 

And yes you need TB 218 trucks.

That is really good to hear. I am looking forward to riding mine. I really like your idea too. My current design is very strong but likely over-engineered(And hence higher cost to 3D print). I want this to be a super inexpensive setup for people to get into pneumatics.

I might try out your setup too on a second board that I'll helping my friend build. This way I can compare them both. 

BTW, around how many miles have you gotten on those wheels(+pulley)?

I'm currently testing something similar (inexpensive tire option with 3D printed hubs). Below I've posted my current 3D model as well as the tires I'm planning to use. Parts have been 3D printed, I have the tire from amazon, and the bolts to screw them together come in Thursday.

Main reason I'm testing these tires is they're super inexpensive (they were on sale for $5 each at the time I purchased them). They are from amazon which means they are super accessible and quick to receive, and they're semi pneumatic (no airing them up) which is technically less maintenance at the expense of customization. 

I'll post the 3D models over here as well at the end of the week assuming they work well after I've tested them.

Design looks nice, but I don't think these tires are mean for anything serious. From amazon: "These tires are ideal for hand trucks, lawnmowers, utility carts, and other lawn and garden equipment". So basically not meant for speed. But be safe when testing them.

The 6x2 tires are however proven to be reliable around here. You could get them from

Sure but who cares about axial load when you have a factory made grub screw hole in the motor shaft? As I said this is for 5065 motors that also have the added benefit of having a cut shaft (=perfect for experimenting with 3D printed gears) plus grub screw. You can even buy them with a thread on the motor shaft - axial loads should thus not be an issue.

A bit confused. Where is the grub screw located? The axial load will get transferred to the bearing which are built to work mostly with radial load. I think that's what he's talking about. Am I missing something?

You can probably go with double helical gear which 3D printing won't care about. As for the drive double helical gear, one can even get it printed in metal(SS) if machined part is expensive.

We should ask @Nowind if he upgrades his motors or how he deals with the axial load in his helical gear drive. From what I see I think he does not upgrade anything and the normal bearings are ok with being used like that.

For me all this Motors used in esk8 applications comes from RC Modell Flight.... they have had do deal with axial load since day one IMO

There are small changes which helps the motors with the Helicals, but nothing special.

Helicals need perfect alignment.  Axiel load = wasted power and should have a thrust bearing.  Precision square cut in oil are stronger, more efficient, more forgiving, and quiet enough. Good luck with Helicals.

with double helical you lose the advantage of always having two teeth in contact simultaneously because at a reasonable gear angle you don't reach the required teeth length as the total gear length is limited.

Figured I would give a small update on the one's I'm working on since I have a similar goal to you (cheap effective pneumatics). I 3D printed all the hubs, and the back right wheel has a slight wobble due to me tightening the plastic a little too much (easy fix by printing another wheel). I'm waiting for my belt to come in to do a real road test with them, however for pushing around they seem to do the job just fine. 

Tires I used (They were on sale for $5.31 each last time I checked with that prime shipping):

Nice. Do you have more pics of how your rim is assembled, your pulley etc. You are welcome to post all the updates here. 

Some people generally have a vendetta against cheap stuff but it might just be a little misplaced if the product is actually of good quality. SpaceX has reduced cost of launches by 5-6 times and now it's gearing to dominate the market. It's not like the clients are saying that oh it's cheap it's bad.

I'll post the STL files and solidworks models once I've tested the design and made sure it's 100% safe (should be finished up by the end of this week). Until then, I'll post a picture of the solidworks assembly, and a close up of the wheels. It uses 6x M6 55mm bolts for the wheel+pulley, and 40mm bolts for just the wheel. These wheels fit on standard caliber 2 trucks.

https://i.gyazo.com/4dfac57355259f1a06b5043b71f75821.png

These pictures I'm posting only have the 3 bolts in the wheel (I was just sizing at the time). The ones I actually have on my board right now use all 6 bolts. Bearings were pressed into place using the butt of a metal utility flashlight. One crucial thing about this design is that you don't overtighten the bolts as it will crush the plastic and cause the wheel to wobble due to unbalance. If 100% effort was brute strength tightening, you only use about 5-10% effort to tighten the nut/bolt against the plastic.

May I suggest putting big washers for each bolt and nut,  or just use flanged bolts and nuts. that will give you good compression force without destroying the plastic. 

The way I dealt with it is: I set the electric drill to a certain torque and tried it on a piece to make sure it doesn't damage the plastic. Once that torque setting it known, you can reliably use that every single time.

BTW, what is the approximate cost of 3D printing in cu inch for you?

Washers would be a great idea, I just didn't order any with the bolts as I eventually got a feel for how tight to screw the bolts. 

My roommate has a fairly nice 3D printer, so he'll pump out prints so long as I have filament. I used PETG filament and it's $25/kg for a quality roll. Comes out to ~787cc of volume, but that's usually higher since I used a 50% infill. 

4 full wheels and a pulley probably take a little under a kilogram of plastic, however I'm unsure since I went through 2 rolls printing prototypes and the final wheels for this project of mine :sweat_smile:

you want to shrink it even further? I find the clearance quite good for 6inch wheels.
Limiting factor is actually the motor being too close to the hanger. It is so close now that they are almost touching each other - even with a 5065 motor.

Hey mate are the dimensions of the hubs and pulley set correct as per the real life product, I've notices the slot for the bearings measures 24mm not 22mm like skate bearings.

Do the designs need to be scaled?

Other then that the system looks good, I may have to try and see if they will fit with dual SK3s.

Depending on what you're 3D printing and the material used and how accurate your printer is, you have to make the hole slightly larger than 22mm as you don't get that perfect precision you can get with a CNC machining out aluminum. I'm not sure if 24mm is too much in this case, however for my design I ended up making it a 23mm hole for the bearing so that you could press fit them in and they would be tight. The first one I made where the dimension was 22mm I ended up crushing the plastic trying to press fit the bearing in.

However these are not my files, so I'm unsure of why he went with 24mm.

They are indeed 24mm in the design(which I created by measuring the parts with a calliper). I don't have the wheels with me right now so can't really say if they use a different bearing or not, but rest of the parts are dimensioned right and I have tested that they fit perfectly.

The whole reason of using these aliexpress 6x2 wheels is:
1. because they are aluminum
2. 6x2 is probably sweet spot in terms of size 
3. 6x2 has proven to be reliable. 

But these might just be good. Mounting a pulley would be pretty similar to the design I have. 

Maybe people more experienced with pneumatics can talk about why this would or wouldn't work.

Those come out to roughly the same price with shipping as the other ones (at least to the US that is).

They look like they could totally work. @mishrasubhransu Did you say you have to modify the bearing hole on the 6x2's you listed above? I remember reading about it on the other topic but I never really understood or got a clear answer on it.

No I didn't have to modify anything, just added 2 3Dprinted parts(the adapter and the pulley) and three 45mm M6 screw. It came with its own bearing. I am just saying that they might be using bearing with 24mm OD. But I am not sure, left the wheel at home.

Alright after doing a little riding, I'm running into a significant issue with the pneumatics I'm testing, battery life. On the original hard wheels I have, I could go ~18 miles on full battery. With the pneumatics I'm testing right now, this range has decreased to about 3.5 miles. There are three main issues I think this stems from.
1. I'm using pneumatics. I already know there's increased rolling friction and was expecting to lose about half my battery life, but not 80% of it.
2. The pneumatics have a really aggressive tread and they're very flat at the contact point (all 1.5 inches of the tire is on the ground). 
3. Poor design in my hubs. It could very well be that my wheel hub designs are having an unforseen impact on this that I haven't figured out. 

For my commute, I need my board to safely go 6 miles (which is why I was hoping it would stay in the 8 or 9 mile range). I'm trying to figure out if I should drop the money on a bigger battery, scrap the pnuematics I was working on and go with one of the other designs above for scooter tires, or some other unseen option I haven't thought of yet.

Thoughts?

-Also, it may be worth noting that if I spin the wheels with my hand, they roll forever (good bearings working like they should). However, when I push myself on the board and roll to a stop, I stop after only about 5 feet of free rolling since there's so much friction.

you can eliminate wobble by using some tire pearls - I did that to mine and had no issues with wobble afterwards even on 3D printed hubs.

I just had one sample point and it didn't wobble for me. The rest 3 are arriving today for me, I think, along with tb218 and reverse mount.

So I have these as well and the free rolling is terrible. So I opened up the hub, hammered out the existing bearings which I think were not good to begin with (some Rusty and grind when turned). Then I used a carbide grinding bit to thin the inner bearing seat so that the new bearings I bought would be pressfit instead of hammer fit.

This made the wheel turn much much much better...

Also, all but 1 were off balanced, I used 5g weights to balance them as best as I could to prevent wobbles when rotating. Usually this is placed on the opposite end of the tube inlet.

Sometimes they put a heavy grease which makes the bearing turn less freely. Doesn't affect the performance a whole lot, but increase the products life. @Hummie mentioned something like that. But if parts are rusted, that's bad. 

I would just using tiny pearls like @maxid suggested.

Let's see how these turn out. 3-4 people on these forums regularly use these hubs and are happy, so I am hopeful.

Made a balancer out of some little brushless motors with no magnets... 

The wheels are very well balanced. No lathe work required...

The tyres are a different story though! Got them all balanced with stick on weights eventually.

@Okami
 I used the mini brushless motors as low friction bearings so that the heavy part of the wheel drops to the bottom under its own weight. Skate bearings are not good enough.... I then used these automotive adhesive wheel balancing weights from Amazon (stick on!) opposite the heavy point until the wheel does not have a bias one way or the other. Then I tested by spinning them quickly to check that my balancing was correct.

the downside to buying stuff like that, as i hope you're aware, is that parts are next to impossible to find, QC is non-existant, and it could last a week or last a few years... i dont mind spending the money on a product if i know it is going to last.

as for the NESE modules i hear they are good, but for my personal taste they're too bulky... im building a 12s4p into a Hummie deck single layer w/ b,s and only need a 1.3cm-1.5cm deep enclosure

Since people don't want to 3D print the pulley or don't have access to a 3D printer. I made an adapter to use with vex robotics versa pulley. It's a much smaller part to print and won't take a lot of money. I have ordered a couple of vex robotics 60T pulley to show you guys how it fits. I can send them to whoever's interested. Pay me shipping + what I paid for.

Not really an update but just wanted to show the assembled 3d printed pulley and the wheels. While option2(versa pulley setup) might be more reliable because the pulley is not 3D printed but option1(3d printed pulley and adapter) is very convenient in terms of assembly and disassembly which is what I am using here.  I also have a set of versa setup that I'll try on this board sometime later.

I want to get those vex robotics pulleys but I bought too much stuff for now so I cannot order them as they only have Fedex shipping to me and it costs like 115us$ for shipping. If my secret Santa doesn’t send me those I am going to have to order from vex anyways. And I would need to make the adapters too.

You can have the pulleys 3d printed too. That should cost like $10 in material if you have a friend with a 3D printer. 

My belt is 375 because I am using the TB reverse motor mount(center distance 105mm). 52T wheel pulley and 16T motor pulley. 

I haven't ridden it at all. I have everything except ESC. Waiting for some crazy offers during the holidays.

I have a bunch of vex robotics 3d printed adapter(no more pulleys) which I can send you if you just send me the cost of shipping $4(assuming US), you'll need to buy the 60T or 42T Vex robotics pulleys and fastener yourself.

So I had 5 extra sets of these adapters for vex robotics pulleys. Two already went to @MannyM0E and @danggilmore and tomorrow I'll be sending two more out, one to @Tamatoa and other to @nicOD. It would be nice to see them tested by multiple people.

I have 1 more set left. Anybody interested? I would prefer to send all out tomorrow to make it easier for me. You just have to pay me shipping which comes to around $4 in the US.

If any of you guys are in Europe, select the UK site (top right of your screen) in the vexrobotics site.
I did an estimate for Greece and I get 21.30 GBP  shipping, still expensive for a couple of pulleys but nowhere near the prices quoted.

+1 The wheels linked above take 628Z (8mm x 24mm x 8mm) bearings instead of regular 608 (8mm x 22mm x 7mm) longboard bearings. So the axle diameter is the same, but other dimensions are different.

Hey @mishrasubhransu I'm using the 50T non-spoke 3D printed pulley, and the bolts I got thread through the plastic and therefore won't let me fully tighten the rim, any chance I could get a modified file with a slightly bigger hole to avoid threading?

## \#239 Posted by: mishrasubhransu Posted at: 2018-11-25T01:44:13.210Z Reads: 253

3D printing can reduce the hole diameter a bit, so I would suggest to put the screw in through the hole while keeping the power tool rotating anticlockwise. That basically makes the diameter just perfect.

Else if you have a a 6mm drill bit, that will work too. 

Do I make sense?

BTW, got any pics of the setup?

1 pair x @accrobrandon
1 pair x @Bataleon
1 pair x @deucesdown
2 pair x @Gjf1 
2 pair x @Lambjr088 

When tightening the bolts I usually use a setting of 5(out of 10) on my small black and decker power tool. This has worked well for me without cracking the plastic. 

1 last pair remains, if you let me know before 3pm tomorrow, I can send it in the same trip to USPS.

I have included 6 m6 bolts in each package. Sorry, I didn't have enough for people ordering 2 sets. It's for fixing the adapter to the wheel. You still have to get 8-32x1 1/4 screws and nuts to mount the versa pulleys to the adapter like in the figure below.

I got the tb218 trucks and the wheels, still waiting for the pulleys and adapter that @mishrasubhransu generously offered to sell me. Shipping to where I live sucks so the wait was to be expected. 
Meanwhile, I was wondering if short mounts like the enertion design or the dickyho are good to use with wheels this size. I used the calculator online and it says that the teeth engagement is too low, would longer mount solve that? Which ones do you guys use? I need to order the belts and it will likely take some time to get here which sucks.

When buying these wheels from China, I received them relatively quickly. Like 2 weeks I think. After I received, I started receiving phone calls from someone claiming to be from UPS with the correct tracking number saying they needed a power of attorney form in order for my package to be released through customs. I didn't respond but got about 5 voicemails so I called her back and they said they need the form. I gave them an email and they emailed me their form from a ups.com email. I'm now at about 30-50 phone calls/voicemails of them hella harassing me and I'm afraid to fill out a form when I already have the wheels.  Anyone else experience something like this? And maybe if you haven't gotten your wheels, they're stuck in customs

I took the lip off my versa pulleys just using wire cutters. Just go around the edge, does cramp up the hands a bit but does the job well.
I went as far as using a think round file in the teeth grooves to take the lip out completely.

So mounted my adapters and pulleys on the hubs. Fits perfectly and easy to do thanks again for making them @mishrasubhransu. I find it is easy to get the spacer to fall and lay flat inside the hub while reassembling it had to take both wheels apart at least once 😅. Best way I found is to mount it on the trucks. 

Went for a quick ride on those wheels unpowered, they had wheel bites, need to change the deck. Also, the rolling resistance is not a myth 😆

I think it's because they are using a high temp/thicker grease that stays inside for much longer. It should free up when it gets hotter though. @Hummie probably has more to say about that.

The one in between the bearings inside the hubs. I took I apart to fit the new bolts. I tried to reassemble the hubs on the bench and I did not notice that the spacer wasn’t standing verticaly anymore so I had to take it apart again to make it stand so I can get the axle through. It happens to me on regular wheels sometimes too. 😂 I am just too hasty.

Probably not. Had this design rotting in a folder for a while, so just gave it a print. Basically this attaches to a **disc brake plate**.  The placement of holes on the disc meant I had to have the same holes on the wheel and that was less than idea because they are **closer to center**. So I made these **locking features** to hold the rim in place. They will probably fail and then I'll think of a proper design for disc brakes.  Haha.

If anyone has access to cnc or wants to have it made in aluminum, I can give you the files for free.  BTW, these are meant to go on the front wheels. 

If you are thinking of CNCing then there is also a cheaper way than making the entire wheel. It will basically be an adapter that attaches to the aliexpress wheels. I'll post it here in a few days.

 I made an assembly vid... which ill edit this week.... used a slightly smaller bearing for idlers...and a 410mm belt... i got 415mm just in case but to much slack although could be remedied by going back to standard size bearings... but space gets tight around the bend from wheel pulley to bearing....

Printing PETG at 255'C is quite sturdy by itself and PETG is cheap, but fiddly to print. I don't know how strong nylon is yet, but PETG at 255'C is way stronger than ABS I used for pulleys before. Hell, I even used a 15T motor pulley printed from PETG for 300KM until it just melted. My motor was a 5045, way too small(I am 100 kilos) and usually reached 90'C+. :slight_smile:

Thanks @accrobrandon.

Yep, here you go  @Trdolan03, these are @ptowncruiser's hubs that I've modified for a slightly better fit, more strength in the rim portions, and added additional third bearing for the pulley portion of the hubs. I don't think these with the third bearing will fit on standard calibers, but if you have TB218s or caliber-Es they should work fine with the third bearing. They might even fit without the third bearing, I'd measure it up in CAD first and use some calipers on your trucks to check though. If not, I'd recommend following the link to @ptowncruiser's original cad for these hubs in the thingiverse link thing description below. If you want you can even use his pulley and main hub with my outer thickened rim portion for more strength, they should be 100% compatible with each other.

On average I get 55wh/mi on my 6x2s filled to 45psi compared to 33wh/mi on 74A urethane. I guess that equals out to about 60% of the expected range on urethane with the same battery.

If it still has the tube that feeds the plastic (bowden system) I wouldn't go to such adventures as printing in PETG..

![46|690x388](upload://rIDi5VBbYfLzIcOTek22SsVsi3n.jpeg) 

Stringing is a mess to remove and also you can't really print at 250-255'C to not melt the teflon tube inside your heater.

Of course still having a bowden+full metal (saves your teflon tube from heat) I managed to print some nice gears:

Just to put some food for thought out there.. Has anyone thought of what happens if you get a flat on the rears? It'll be a bitch because it needs full disassembly just to get at it... 

I just thought that maybe if spacing/integrity permits... To drill a hole in the pulley where the bolts go into the hub adaptor... So u have some direct access to it and than the pulley and adaptor remove as one unit...

I mean.. You should be able to take half of the rim off as is.. It's the nylocks outside the rim. You remove the hanger bolt, remove the 3 nylock nuts and take one part of the hub off. Pulley, second part of the hub, etc. stays on. Change it and ride on after doing everything in reverse.

These gray ones were printed with PETG at 250'C on my pre-conversion anycubic mega i3 ultrabase which had a ton of stringing on bowden. I have extremely better looking ones printed on my Prusa Mk2.5.

I have converted my anycubic to prusa Mk2S(e3d v6 full metal) extruder because I had all the parts leftover from upgrading the before mentioned prusa Mk2.5. All I had to do was to modify the carriage model and print a BLTouch version of the hotend mount. It prints better than my prusa now because of custom firmware and TMC2208 drivers. I don't need more than 4 pulleys atm, so I haven't tried it. But smaller models look just amazing. :smiley:

And yes it can print nylon and polycarbonate if I desire.

I know this sounds like overkill, but I carry a spare wheel with the vex attached for blow outs... I can’t be arsed with a long time at the roadside so I’ll swap out the wheel with whichever has a puncture and fix it at home. I can use the pulley wheel on any corner to limp home (I know there’s an even chance of having the tyre backwards, but it’s going to get me home).

I mean, you could. But I wouldn't trust my life on PETG being printed at 240'C. If it's winter and room is colder, layer adhesion will be below tolerable, hell, even layer splitting can appear.

I am talking about real PETG, not PET. That stuff(PETG) is recommended to print at 250'C+. I got best results at 255'C, but it also depends on your hotend, thermistor, nozzle, speed, either you use a silicone sock for the heater block, active cooling is through the roof, etc.

Source: been printing prototypes for companies for well over a few years now.

Example prints done using converted anycubic with PETG at 255'C:

Feel free to ask in PM if you want. There are direct extruder/full metal conversions for the ender. I have a colleague who bought it. Seems to have a bit of specific issues to the roller design, like flat rollers and vibrations, but he is getting there.

I would go for the full metal hotend or even titan aero extruder system if you have the bucks and are not afraid to get your hands/mind dirty with custom firmware. Also grabbing a BLTouch would help immensely(who doesn't love automatic bed leveling?). Also means more firmware. All parts can be purchased as either clones(the titan aero, 3DTouch) or legit(ender3 full metal hotend) from AliExpress or related stores.

I will ask my colleague which full metal hotend he got later.

I'd still rather go for a direct approach as full metal has another issue, it might clog like hell during retractions. With bowden you have your tube inserted almost to the opening of the nozzle, this allows you to do ridiculous retractions like 5-10mm without problems. This also means if you go above the melting/charring point of the tube, you will get some nasty particles around..

With full metal it(the bowden tube) ends at the "throat"(the heatbreak) that connects the hot part with your nozzle to the heatsink, keeping the incoming plastic sturdy enough, to be melted later. This introduces a small gap between the tube and the metal, which might end up with swelling of the filament and eventual jam when doing retractions >2mm.

Clarification: direct uses full metal, but not that much retraction, like up to 1mm

I mean this could be useful information for everyone, but I don't know. If it doesn't hurt anyones eyes, I will continue to help/explain here. :slight_smile:

I did not say you couldn't. I am also saying it's superior to ABS. Have you tested the layer adhesion with a tension, torsion, impact testing equipment? You'd be surprised what kind of performance PETG gains at those temperatures.

Hell, I've been riding PRINTED wheels for 300+ kilometers. 20% infill, PETG.

I am just talking from experience. 255'C prints is minimum strength I can accept by now.

Oh yeah, the motor mount is printed too.. From PETG. :smiley:

And this is how it looked like after I replaced the mount and the motor(5045 with 100 kilos is a no-no). Wheels still printed and heavily used:

No, you shouldn't. Imagine the friction and centripetal forces you will get. It will MELT your rims faster than you can jump off your board at the "oh FUCK!" moment.

Glass transition(softening) temperature of PLA is ~60'C, PETG ~90'C depending on purity and additions, ABS ~105'C, etc.

My wheels used PETG for the rims and TPU(Thermo Plastic Urethane) for the tires.

I am glad it is, pulleys get surface load though, so there's not much trouble the teeth will wear out fast or break.

I am just stating the best strength you can get if you really want the most of your filament. 242'C in a cold environment would make my skin go full on goosebumps if I had to use it in a loaded/critical situation, it just doesn't adhere much..

For comparison, I could break the 6mm cylinder printed at 240'C with my hands before.

Later at 248'C I had to use pliers, then at 255'C equipment with a vice grip, because I couldn't make it bend much even using two pairs of pliers and my table as support edge.

It's all up to the needs of an individual.

Still, I find it kind of time wasting right now, because PETG WILL be strong. Stronger than ABS even. If it works, it works. I just had to push the maximum out of my setup because of real life and loaded prototypes I had to make.

If those temps work for your needs and loads, I see no problem. My experience might cloud the opinion on  these "low" temp numbers, but that's just how my experience is.

Seems to be the after-mexican-food shit, because you are burning up, man.

I legitimately questioned at all points because I am interested, it's my source of income. I NEED to make the prints top-strength and I constantly learn new things.

No need to be so hard-headed and break stuff with a vice grip, just print a simple 6mm cylinder to keep the pollution low and that's it, see how it holds up. If you get sufficient strength in that cross cut, it's fine by me, fine by you, fine by everyone. No need to get political about this.

Not everybody lives in the exact same ambient temperatures, not everyone has exactly the same calibrated printers, not everyone has the exact same filament. Maybe they have AC running in the same room, maybe they're in Siberia and printing at -10'C for the hell I know why, maybe they live in the desert and they can print at 220'C.

Everything in 3D printing and tuning is up to individual machines, filaments, etc.

Yes, making 10€ filament print top-notch parts takes a *bit* of experience, don't you think? Before I was using 40€ rolls from either ColorFabb or Prusa, but further testing proved that even 10€ filament can do exactly the same. Been using the same filament for over two years now.

I just told my story, wondered how you get the strengths you imply and now you flame on like the turd you just made?

I don't see the point tbh.

Grind the gears all you want.

Thank you for your nice experience! I wont take all Information as is but i find them very helpfull!!

Normaly i used Standard prusa settings and printed my stuff in petg at 230. :open_mouth: so the first thing i will do is to test a bit with the temperatures. It makes totally sense that we will get more strength by increasing the print temperature (and layer height, Nigger nozzle).

So the Information are not the only truth around here but they are helpfull to the community imho

If you have a genuine prusa with a brass nozzle, [calibrated extruder](https://mattshub.com/2017/04/19/extruder-calibration/) (using PLA, lower push force, better flow), I would recommend starting at:

First Layer Bed: 90'C
First Layer Temp: 250'C
Further Bed: 90'C
Further Layers: 255'C - play around with this, depends on ambient temps and if you have [silicone sock](https://e3d-online.com/v6-socks-pro-pack-of-3), if you don't, keep at the higher side.

Fan at automatic 30-50% if MK2S/MK2.5(12V fan), constant 50% if MK3(5V fan).

If you have a [steel nozzle](https://e3d-online.com/hardened-steel-nozzles-v6) and have no [silicone sock](https://e3d-online.com/v6-socks-pro-pack-of-3), you might need to increase the temperature from 250'C up to 5 degrees, so you could even reach 260'C. With sock keep it at 255'C as it will not radiate much heat.

Your retractions might need to go to 1mm. Leave Lift-Z as is.

I have tried printing upwards to 275'C but it gave me diminishing returns around 265'C using a steel nozzle with a sock. Small details became overcooked.

Did anyone try to remove the bearings and replace them? Would a standard "pulling hammer" method for pulling them out and simple torquing to put them back in work?

That's the only "shoddy" part about these wheels I found out by now. One wheel has a locked bearing, another one has one that rotates with an obstructive feeling in the same position of rotation..

How free the bearings became after lathing? If they are loose it beats the purpose of press-in ball bearings.. Bearings should have their shroud pressed in for the best performance. If they rotate it might just eat at the bearing slot during heavier loads, even add axial forces too..

Point taken. Mine are still a tight fit... a tap out rather than press out. The ones I removed needed a proper puller and a ridiculous amount of force.

I can confirm that the resistance is due to the thick grease they use. They give you more resistance but require less attention. If you want less resistance then put some wd40 in there and let is dissolve the thick grease.

I made a spool mount for 3D printer using 608 bearings and they didn't let the spool holder rotate freely. So I soaked them in wd40 for 30mins and bam they became totally free.

WD40 is mostly kerosene and light oil. Has a teeerible reputation as a lubricant on things like bearings :) Usually you'd need to flush it out with alcohol then apply the lube of your choice.

What I'm trying to say is if you WD40, make sure you add some lube, maybe more than once.

of course. I only used it on the 3d printer spool is because it's not going to see much speed or load. 

For the skateboard I let it be because, I don't think in larger scheme of things, there are not a significant source of loss. Hummie also uses a very thick grease in his hub motors for increasing longevity of the bearings. 

If someone changes the bearing, it would be nice for them to report back if they have significantly increased range.

I swapped out the bearings after hammering the original ones out (already slightly rusty), grinding down the beating seat a little and popping in new bearings.

![IMG20180906170702|281x500](upload://lBtsDuuB2TXmh4wRf8Or0Np8lIw.jpeg) 
I used a nut and bolt to hammer it out from the inside of the hub. A few good wacks was all it took.

I should have used a lathe but didn't have one on hand.

Wheels turned with a lot less resistance but I doubt I got much more range with it as the Tyre still have a high rolling resistance.

Also, popping in a new bearing without grinding down the seat was near impossible. I managed to hammer one in but it basically seized and wouldn't turn.

That's what I thought. Most of the losses would come from the hysteresis of the tire, reduced pressure and large contact patch area. Of course, if the bearing is rusted you replace it but otherwise, no point.

That maybe by design, given that the other side of the centers would be pressed when you mount them on the axle and tighten them? That way it remains centers during operation. Otherwise, they would get pushed inward into the wheel. Make sense?

The issue is, both bearings are pressed inside the rim unevenly. Especially apparent when you tighten the wheel together and on the axle. The spacer shouldn't be so long, that one bearing is offset by 1mm, not making full contact with the wheel. You can try and take one rim apart and look how they are seated at the moment.

Okay, press is done and was way easier than I thought. It presses way better than I thought and eliminates the gap no problem.

**Long instruction post ahead!**

This is all you need to use the "tools":
![52|690x388](upload://5oPzSMSinpslXgW65HVc1sK6cK8.jpeg) 

* Ratcheting socket wrench, M8 bolt head size (13mm socket)
* Adjustable wrench or another ratcheting socket or even a simple wrench for holding the other side (M8/13mm)
* M8 x 40mm++ bolt, 8.8 strength is enough
* M8 Nut, 8.8 strength is enough
* 23mm M8 washer (Got this from SK3 accessories) - This one is used for pressing the bearing back in.
* 25mm M8 washer (Got this from SK3 accessories) - This one is used for pressing the bearing back in, centering and support
* 28mm M8 washer (Got this from SK3 accessories) - This one is used for pulling, you can use any other of the two mentioned above, as this is unconfirmed necessary
* 3D printed puller (the big cylinder jig)
* 3D printed press (25mm "bearing")

**The 3D prints are mandatory to be printed out of PLA!!!**
PLA has the biggest strength for these kind of loads.

**Settings(reference):**

**First layer:** 70'C bed, 215'C hotend
**2nd layer and above:** 65'C bed, 210'C hotend
**Cooling fan:** 50% with auto cooling if supported
**Perimeters:** 4
**Infill:** 100% rectilinear, don't skimp, compression forces when pulling are no joke

_(Small washer model is thicker.)_

**The pulling:**

1. Put the tool above the bearing
2. Push the bolt through from the bottom of the bearing
![59|690x388](upload://9p7VmMIFqrkyWmF6rzG8rrYtNSk.jpeg) 
3. Place a washer corresponding to the model you downloaded
4. Put the nut on
![52|690x388](upload://2E8hJIM00FDhWc92zcbpWgxGTh8.jpeg)
5. Hold the bolt from the top and start ratcheting from below
6. You might hear a loud pop when doing it, it's not the plastic, I was spooked too, it's the bearing unseizing(steel inside aluminum)
7. Unscrew when done and go back to step one
![36|690x388](upload://4acUWaaEJOPf8CmkMbANbdzY7Io.jpeg)

**The pressing:**

1. Put 23mm washer on the bolt
2. Put the bearing on the bolt
![12|690x388](upload://uwX0nsBcrHQEiqZiQlXLvBEgKSd.jpeg) 
3. Put the assembly at the bearing seat, make sure to pre-center it a little, but 23mm washer should take care of it while tightening
4. Put the pressing printed part on the bolt, fit it inside the slot
![44|690x388](upload://3W5gbxY47LsxpDRWbDT4aHeqO2g.jpeg) 
5. Put 25mm washer on the pressing printed part
6. Put on the nut and tighten the same way like with pulling
![02|690x388](upload://qnFyWUqmqr3hR0xX4SQmX86AdSF.jpeg) 
7. Once you cannot really tighten anymore (don't over do it, you will see the bearing seated anyways), loosen the bolt and go back to step 1
![07|690x388](upload://xS8H4QvE00pgzXhCvYiRzHfKnhh.jpeg) 

The tool also "compacts" itself quite nicely and can be kept in your pocket if you so desire:

Hopefully this helps somebody. :slight_smile:

Fun extra: Pull and push bearings several times so that the seat becomes a little bit "acquainted" with the bearing. Makes further maintenance a breeze with pretty much no force(still impossible to push in by hand, but much easier on the torque needed). Make sure to clean the seat after every pressing/pulling to get rid off the small shavings of aluminum.

Also make sure you sand/grind/file the spacers.

Original ones are 18.11mm and this makes rim sides float above each other, so tightening pushes the bearing centers out, tightening to the axles will make the situation even worse.

This is how it is before taking a bit off:
![41|690x388](upload://oIyC7sdfGFbTfNeo1aMbtiMpoZF.jpeg) 
![51|690x388](upload://oYz6DMrrOfDt6zyasfN1uKFkWD4.jpeg) 

The gap is what makes improperly installed spacer lock the bearings A LOT. Especially with load the bearings already get from the pressing into the seat.

You want to reduce the length to ~17.90mm. This will make sure the spacer still contacts the bearings, yet it doesn't apply too much load when the rim is assembled and axle is tightened.

![17|690x388](upload://6vVBrT6baS0Y2gX5PnrUuRyKLeN.jpeg) ![40|690x388](upload://limasfkjhVwvaXWpR7Ms6hiScnw.jpeg) 

No more gap and the bearings spin after assembly. Spacer works and you can spin one bearing to make other spin. :slight_smile:

EDIT: this is individual to each person. If you try to push the bearings completely to the seat, then the spacers will become 17mm even. Make sure you check your situation and take off some aluminum gradually.

To finish off "Murlocs Mod" list:

Quick removal of the tyre, only works with 3D printed pulley for now.

![32|690x388](upload://8dEYwLpaGSoEjBecLiMQz3OGg7I.jpeg)

Get 3 M6x50mm screws and 3 M6 NyLock nuts.

Screw the pulley with spacer in the wheel side with the threads. Hand tighten(approx 15Nm) them so they sit flush.

![06|690x388](upload://uroeKlrK9tnfWg5F62JQefs98KQ.jpeg)

Put on the other side of the rim after the tire, put on the nuts, tighten them with a 10mm socket wrench to be flush.

That's all! In a case of a flat, you will only need to unscrew the bolt that holds the wheel in place, those 3 nuts and off goes the tyre! No need to remove the belt/pulley. :slight_smile:

![46|690x388](upload://5dcFZzrJ8srwD0EYUmFU4bImw9k.jpeg) 

That's all from me. Have fun with the wheels! :smiley:

Well trusting is a different issue from getting a part rated for the job from a reputed manufacturer. 

The original pulleys that have been bad might could have been from a water damaged stock, who knows.

It's not really the point of security. Bearings have different loads and tolerances. Not saying I won't try to get bearings on the cheaper side, but I think seating into aluminum will require bearings which have better load bearing and tolerances.

Even normal PU wheel bearings differ a lot. I had simple 608 bearings (8€ for 8) that gave up on me kind of fast, they started wobbling and locking up. Then I got 608 Zealous bearings (20€  for 8) with integrated spacers and never saw any more issues. :slight_smile:

I've read to use somewhere around 16 wh/km on the calculator for use with mountain board tires, but doing so should put you at 20 ish miles.  If you made it to 8mi with 20%,so lets say 10 miles that would mean 32wh/km. Would you say that 32wh/km is more realistic and thats what I should use to calculate the range with these tires?

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14AF8h_PFzBTdH6JRkKynJ70I3WzezC0N

There appears to be like a 3mm gap where the pulley adapter does not fit flush to the wheel.  I bought these 6x2 pneumatic wheels from the original link at top.  I am assuming that they have changed their milling process.  [This thread is getting so long...]

 Has anyone else had this issue.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this???

I didn't have a gap when I assembled it, but that gap will not cause any issue. All the load is taken by the bolts and the force is exerted by the belt in the radial direction.

@mishrasubhransu , Thanks for the quick reply.  I absolutely love these parts...  Great Job!
I looked further - It appears that these wheels are not machined the same as the ones that would fit the pulley adapter. (Although they look same, and are the 6x2's)
1. The pulley adapter lip is a greater diameter than the inner diameter of the wheel hub.
2. The bolt pattern for the hub is a few mm narrower than the adapter.
I measured my bolt pattern to be 40mm.  I measured the Pulley Adapter to be 41.57mm.

I am going to try and take your hub, and gear - fill in the bolt holes, then recreate my own bolt pattern.  Then I will have to bring in the lip about 3mm so that the wheel adapter flange is flush with the wheel.

Let me know if you have any further thoughts.  Thanks so much.

@Benjamin899 , Great thought!  I was thinking the same thing...  So I imported the  SLDPRT files into Fusion 360 so I could measure them in the file, and sure enough - Its a 41.57mm bolt pattern (unless you have in your files a 40mm bolt pattern)...  Not sure if I am making sense.  I can send pics.  Thanks so much for your help.  

By the way.  I printed them in PETG at 80% - They turned out fantastic, and feel super tough...  Just gotta get em to fit...  haha.  I have Nylon, and PC shipping to me at the moment.  I am hoping to try both filaments to do a comparison.

@Benjamin899, Wellp.  I got the bolt holes removed, and added the new ones at 40mm.
I am printing a test right now to see if it matches up.  I am having a little trouble moving the **lip**.  Fusion 360 is having trouble with all the rounded corners and fillets.  (by the way, I like rounding and fillets - improves strength).

Any chance you have a model saved without the fillets, and rounding.  That would be easier to modify.  If not - thats totally Ok.  Don't go to any extra trouble.

I was wondering about mounting on TB trucks. Using only speed rings means small offset and the nut is wayyy too far from the rim. Using the included spacer instead of the internal speedring makes the thread too short. Using a bearing->speedring->rim combo makes the thread still too short. Wot in tarnation?

Any suggestions?

Should I just slap a ridiculous amount of speedrings?

I presume it's because of dual 6374 motors. Requires quite a wheel offset to make motors fit on the trucks. Atm the distances are gut wrenching. Wheel to mount distance is 1mm. Between motors it's also 1-2mm.

Good to know, can't wait till you have Wh readings. I am stressing I might not get the range I anticipate (at least 30km).. I am putting a 12S6P Samsung 30Q battery into this tank, but still.. :smiley:

It will be around 20 to 30Wh/km - so with a 12S6P of 30Q you can estimate a conservative 26km
```

## \#521 Posted by: mishrasubhransu Posted at: 2019-01-23T08:10:36.538Z Reads: 160

```
For the approximate values, here's the analysis. 
I have 10S4P made of Samsung 25R battery, so 10Ah. I charge my battery to 4.1 volts. After riding 4.4 miles(~7km) my voltage reading is at 3.8 volts. i.e approximately 112Wh(based on discharge capacity plots). So that gives 16Wh/km

EDIT: but apparently that's too optimistic based on what @Maxid said. I weight  165lb(~75kg) so that along with decent roads might have tipped the scale. But likely, it's the approximate analysis.

Here is the range update. I ran it until it came down to 3.4 volts(actually diebiems soft limit is 3.3 but due to sag it started cutting at 3.4).  And rode a total of 11 miles(17.7km). **4.1V to 3.4V is 2.1AH** so that gives a total of 10S X 4P X 3.7V X 2.1AH = **310WH**. So it comes down to 310WH/17.7km = **17.5 WH/km.**  With the board I weigh 85kg(187lbs) and ride at <20mph

FYI @murloc992

Office to work is 2.2 miles and I rode it exactly 5 times.

So it's not bad at all! Considering you used 310Wh, and a 12S6P of 30Q is approx 800-900Wh. May be less or more depending on how hard I squeeze them.

Very boring rider actually, I stick to 15mph mostly and don't do any hard accelerations(I want my belt to last). I don't want one more dislocated pinky :D (Although that was on a thane board 100mm MBS when i got stopped suddenly by those 1" thick street plates, the ones they put on roads when they dig up the roads)

Roads are pretty good for 85% of the stretch. Also I have the pressure at 75PSI. Final thing I can think of is that I applied this oil([met-ol)](https://www.inlinewarehouse.com/OUST_MET-OL_Metalic_Bearing_Oil_1_2_Oz/descpage-OTOIL.html) to all the bearings as per someone's suggestion here, maybe @mmaner, a while ago.

With Turnigy SK3 6374 and 15mm belt pulley on TorqueBoards 218mm trucks you will have barely 1-2mm left pulley-to-mount and 1mm left for the nylock nut to screw on.. I did some small mods, like thinning the spacer by 1mm and using a 12mm belt pulley (14mm) to get more tolerable nylock engagement on the axle and better spacing between pulley and the mount.

You should move your motor mount closer to the wheel. Oh I see, you can't. since you used a short mount, you have to flip the motor pulley and that means the motor mount as to be away from the wheel.

The motor pulley can't be flipped as the mount is so thick that it takes a lot of the length of the shaft away. Do you see anything majorly wrong with the way it is now. Btw is the pulley intentionally designed to be put on the other way?

It's a 16T motor pulley and 50T wheel pulley with axle distance of almost 100mm. You can calculate the #of teeth that are meshing from that, but it looks like 6 to my eye.  Pulley width is 15mm. I run it pretty loose and haven't gotten slippage yet.

I can persuade my TIM value to be whatever I want with the help of idlers. Using Dickyho mounts, love them to hell and back.

Can use either 400mm or 425mm belts. 425mm means maximum idler engagement and perhaps 70-80% of tooth engagement on the motor/wheel pulleys. :laughing:

[/quote]

I assume by pulleys you mean idlers.

I doubt it really will impact much(reducing range, etc) as these add minimal pressure and allow me to run loose belts.. They are equipped with bearings anyways, add just tension and minimal angle to the belt travel path.

I've found this too:

[quote="Stef, post:85, topic:30191, full:true"]
If designed properly, idler wheels can:

* Prolong belt life
* Increase torque transfer ability without skipping
* Reduce required frequency of belt tensioning
* Increase motor bearing life
* Reduce drag in belt system, increasing the efficiency and thus range of the board.

So there are lots of benefits! Of course you have to design it properly for it to work well, as with any other component on your board.

Edit: I should explain why I think idlers can improve belt life:

You can run them with way less tension, in my case without tension works perfectly. This reduces strain and thus improves belt life. Not skipping teeth also greatly prolongs life of the actual teeth on the belt (and motor pulley too if its aluminum or plastic)

I confirm that the uphill consumption is 15wh/km. That’s puts the average of uphill and downhill at around 13wh/km. I am impressed. This is on stock bearings.

13Wh per km is super good efficiency for pneumatics. What PSI do you run them at?

Also, has anybody else had quality control issues with the 6x2 inner tubes? Two have already failed on me where the valve stem meets to tire :boom:

I managed to fix one using an adhesive called [Pratley's Wondafix](http://www.pratleyadhesives.com/diy-adhesives/pratley-wondafix).

I partly removed the valve stem and injected some between the side of the stem and the tube which had come loose. I then put a small cable tie around it tightly and left overnight. It's been holding up well so far (30 PSI so nothing crazy).

Probably not worth the effort but finding a replacement inner tube locally was impossible.

I am surprised you didn't get 2 spare tires with inner tube. Inner tube should outlast the tires, so even if you get one defective you are still all set. 

I had one defective stem out of 8 full tires and 8 tire-tube set. I messaged the shop with photos in Ali Express and they sent me 2 two replacement tubes for free.

This is gonna be kinda dumb and I don't want to shit up the thread with it - but what are some pros/cons of these over TB110's? I've been meaning to grab some pictures, but the town I'll be riding in has some pretty bad segments of brick road. 

I also presume putting 6" pneumatics on a 25" board would be dumb. Is that right, or no? Either way, I'm planning on a single drive 25" and a dual drive longboard. Was planning on tb110 for the longboard, but maybe these are a better idea?

Might be too big and have a ton of wheelbite with "narrow" trucks. All depends on the board shape ofc. If you can, share the shape, these wheels can be just too big to even turn anymore. At least for my deck I will have to cut off some corners from it, and it's a 41" cruiser.. Unless you use Trampa/Trampa style trucks that are super wide. :slight_smile:

I started with 83mm wheels and then 100mm mbs wheels and then these. Although I have 2 working boards, one with 6" tires and the other with 100mm, I don't feel like touching the 100mm one any more. This one rides smoother and is safer(rolls over everything)

It seems like battery drain/weight(?) would be the biggest setback. More as a dedicated cruising/AT/race board and not so much for a small yet congested college town?  

If I wasn't such a weak bitch it probably wouldn't be a problem, but I'm going to be recovering from rib-removal surgery pretty soon and carrying shit won't be fun for a while

No further progress, except for 3D printed spacers for the bearings. I mean, they work, but I don't yet know about their longevity so I don't really wanna share atm. They allow me to space out the bearings in any spacing I want. Also I think it works because my bearings have a HUGE lip to place spacers. :slight_smile:

Also I was looking for some puncture proofing, but two places I bought the strips from, insta-refunded me, so that idea is scrapped for now..

I am also trying to track down a source of Schwalbe Impac 6" tubes.

That's what I am saying, give it a shot and if you don't like it then change. I am on stock and I am getting 13wh/km. No point in wasting money and time if you don't really need it. 

Free rolling bearings are necessary when you are pushing not when you have it motorized. Thick grease bearings are not free rolling but are long lasting.

I changed the bearings in 2 wheels because they were clicking and nasty, the other 3 wheels I’ve got are good with stock for now. I’ll change them as and when they need it. 

On a side note The failure of the valve stems that a few people are seeing could be caused by the hole in the wheel being oversized. I’ve noticed that there is visible rubber coming out through the hole around the stem on 2 of my wheels... it may be a symptom of running high pressures? I’m going to look at turning some thin nylon collars to go around the stems to protect them and take up the excess space. 

I’ve adopted the mod to allow puncture repairs without removing the pulley... works well so far.

I can’t find it now!! It basically boils down to using longer wheel bolts to bolt the pulley on to the wheel half which has the tapped holes and then using locking nuts to hold the other rim half on to this assembly..

I’ll take a picture tomorrow if that doesn’t make sense.

It looks like Banggod has them for around 17USD. And offering free Priority Direct shipping (10-15 days shipping/delivery). So no risk being held at customs. And with the CouponCode **BgAuMotor** you get even 10% off. So in total 5 Tires were arount 74 USD. About 14.80 USD per tire/rim.

https://www.banggood.com/6X2-Inflation-Inner-Tube-Tire-Wheel-Use-6inch-Tire-Alloy-Hub-160mm-Pneumatic-Tyre-Scooter-p-1384542.html

only difference I see is the Writing on the tire. At Aliexpress the pictures show "**KF-714-02**" and the ones at Banggood show "**KF-714-05**" . Don't know what this last number means. Besides that they look identical..

I always had my suspicion but today I confirmed it . 40PSI vs 70 psi is 23wh/km vs 14wh/km for the same trip(&back) of 3.5km. Craaaazy!

Give it a shot. The tubes are super small and hence a tiny bit of leakage affects it. When removing the fill valve make sure you don't let out lot of air. Even measuring it brings it down every single time I measure it. I have a lab supply that I can regulate to any PSI below 250, so I just set it to 70 and filled my tire. No measurements.

Still very comfortable, even going over the gaps(the one with steel bars) in bridges. I used to dread them when using 100mm MBS wheels. With 83mm clone wheels those feel like they might break the trucks any moment. Haha.

I just rode them through a snowfall, probably 1/4-1/2" snow. The tires handles so well. Only issue, actually a major one, is that my belt broke. I guess, because of the exact same reason that @b264 had, snow accumulating on the wheel pulley and getting bigger and bigger until the belt can't take it anymore.  

Made it to 2.7km instead of my usual 3.4km. Vesc reported a consumption of 26Wh/km.

I even took a video but battery died(unexpectedly, cold I assume) and phone didn't even save the video :sob:

Snow breaks belts like nothing else in the world.

I'm not even worried about it being slippery.  Slippery I can deal with.

It's those belts you keep snapping... I think snow might be a good reason to graduate to gear drive

If it doesn't break a belt it will pull your motor or idler pulleys loose

But since you still have to screw it on the schrader valve, air comes out when you are taking it off. 

What I use is this. Once you are done filling air, you just don't hold them together anymore. It just comes off with a small puff of air.

I'm having some issues with the pulley alignment. It's ok from side to side but no matter how i install it i get some movement up and down (hopping). This makes the belts go from loose to tight when i rotate the wheel. Any tips?

Could it be a "one tooth off" scenario?

Or you can actually measure the pulley to be offset on different rim sides?

I mean, the chinese holes are not perfect, but it could be just your belt initially not meshing and skipping one tooth when turning by hand and then catching up, creating the feel of "too much tension, then too low tension". I had this exact tension variation because of teeth not meshing correctly. I tensioned motors on the mounts ever so slightly and it was gone, because meshing is now fine. :slight_smile:

Ah I get it. Interesting. So the pulley is a bit eccentric or the axis os the pulley is not aligned with axis of the wheel. The latter likely. What pulley are you using? 3D printed or versa.

If you can spin the wheel without the belt on, you can probably notice if the pulley is wobbly or not. Or if there's a small piece of rock stuck to the pulley. That could also make it tight and loose as it rotates.

When the snow is picked up by the wheels, some of it comes out the side of the wheel guards and onto the belt directly. 

What I can do is make that gap(between wheel and guards) on the inner side really small so that snow can't fall through.

Or do it like you said, but the problem is that will be supported from just one side. So will probably vibrate and also give way to the tightly packed snow.

Ive tried swapping between rims and it gets somewhat better.
But there is still vertical movement, on the pulley.
It could also just be that the spacer (between the pulley and rims) could be warped a tiny bit since it is abs printed.
Its not much vertical movement but enough to make belt tension hard to get right.
I dont have acess to a printer so its hard for me to make a new one.
Its just easier for me to get some evolve wheels with pulleys to get it right.

In theory 9.5" sounds fine, but you'd better find out if people succeeded with these trucks.

As for pulleys, grab a 15:60 setup. It will have way more torque than 15:40 considering your kV of 230. Use a calculator to analyze the torque like:

https://calc.3dservisas.eu

I use two 168kV motors and torque should be [above 40Nm](https://calc.3dservisas.eu/?TY_BCsIwEET_JWeRbZOU6jVKT0pAsHebQwRrCz2K_-7OpIq3N8Ps7O7L3EI2e_O4T0-zUXFWYbeN8hIuylVNjIrFDAiICMUBqvKFkamLz85KcUaHBfzNzRGuI3EIxCrridxG_BUNOaxNQz4qtUK8YtyBx7A2jTy7aYFxAjsiVnopUdgIpH5hGG7qTt9nUtfjArpYthPz_gA=). :smiley:

How did it crack? While tightening? What material?

basically the screw should go in into those holes easily, if not, just take a drill and make the hole slightly bigger. ABS is not very good in tension. If the hole is narrow, then the bolt will try to push it out. and break it.

For the vex pulley setup, I found that i had used 10mm counterbore hole for the head of the M6 bolt, but that's the exact diameter for the head too. 3D printing might have reduced that dia even further so that when the bolt head is in there it would basically crack the plastic. I have adjusted for that and also added some extra plastic on either side of the holes. 

For the 3D printed pulleys and adapter, I increased the hole dias a bit like 6.2mm instead of 6mm for the bolts to go through better. 

All files have been updated in thingiverse.

**Does anyone have any other suggestions**?

@DerelictRobot, I guess the other topic was deleted and we were discussing the efficiency of these tires here are some metr plots
I am averaging about 18wh/km. I don't know if this is enough for you or you feel it should be around 10wh/km

I bought these tires/tubes to replace the airless rubber tires that came with my diyeboard setup. This will be my first pneumatic adventure!

@mishrasubhransu has been giving me some tips, and I've already filed down (and taped for safety) the valve hole, so there shouldn't be any sharp edges.

I'll probably still have to wait another month or so for all the snow to clear, but that gives me time to get everything all ready to go.

You think that's going to cause problems? For sure the 3 hole hubs are build better but people(maxid) have been running these tires with 3D printed hubs, aluminum should hold no? Plus I have seen them on 8"tires and many off terrains setups. 

If it starts to wobble or something like that, then they shouldn't be used anymore.

I am mostly concerned about two sided hole and the fact that if you forget to beautify them, they will shred tubes like no tomorrow. I will stay with the three spoke design.

I am also aware of the 3D printed hubs. They don't have such backhanded holes.

I bought them from diyeboard. I know they haven't had the best reputation, but I haven't had any issues with them the couple of times that I bought things (might not buy from them again though).

They came as a set with wheels, trucks, mounts and motors for $288. Bought them last summer.

I don't see why they wouldn't fit on the OG ones. They seem interchangeable. Since the hubs with my kit already had spaces for the valve, I assume they used the standardized hub size.

I'm 6'7" and probably about 215lbs or so, so the airless tires just had too much rolling resistance for someone of my size. I'd offer to ship them to you, but I have a feeling the shipping cost wouldn't be worth it.

Have you tried talking to dickyho? He has airless tires now too. I think his ebay listing is just for the set, but if you message him, I'm sure he can sell you just the tires.

I'm 6'7" and 215lbs, so the holes in the airless tires made them too squishy for me. It just wasn't making the ESC or battery happy.

When I first got into esk8, I thought smaller wheels = more compact, but now that I've been doing it for a couple years, I realized that bigger wheels = comfier ride (especially with the shitty roads in my city). The airless tires felt AMAZING. I flew over everything.

I didn't know much about pneumatics before, and I had seen pictures of people getting flat tires, etc., and I guess that's why I never really looked into them. But I thought about it more and figured that it can't be too common of an issue, so that's why I wanted to give them a try.

Sadly no, the wheel is too small and pressure too high to heal the damage. The only possible way is to use anti puncture strips. Can't for the love of dog get my hands on ANY of it..

Tubeless adventures are on hold atm, because I can't find necessary size valve stems with an angle and THICC part for sealing against rims.

CNC is not the problem to be honest, the valve seat that is THICC is the problem, it limits minimum height. Like this is what I am talking about:

![image|500x500](upload://oDBUqt3h41NaeAkiIT6mmSKPL8n.jpeg) 

This is a TR412 valve stem for tubeless purposes.

Yet..

It's too high:

![image|292x327](upload://naqwQQnxCA9XJzmsgvtTN2TMLW3.png) 

The only other variant would be to find some kind of similar motorcycle valve stem and try to fit it.

I Printed them in PETG with 80% infill (Full HoneyComb). And the Adapter and the Pulley fit perfectly as I can judge. Need to order some longer screws.

It's meant to be printed with 100% infill with atleast 4 walls or so. I should actually put that on thingiverse. Along with the correct screw size needed. Any other suggestions for me?


Belt length is determined using the pulley diameter and motor-axle to wheel-axle distance. You can find calculators online. On TB reverse mount, the axle to axle distance is 100mm with lots of wiggle room. 

Please don't change the bearings, unless it has some serious issues.

Yeah, I didn't pay attention about the wallcount, but its really strong. Printing at 30mm/s so the layers can be fused a little bit better together.. 

Yeah, maybe the printing config suggestions should be on thingiverse aswell. Yeah, also the information about the correct screw length would be nice. Need to measure it.

But other than that you did a great job creating these 3D models.Even the Belts which I hav laying here are fitting perfectly into the teeth/gaps of the pulley.

Which Program did you use to create the pulley and the adapter, if I may ask.?

Thanks in advance. Can not wait to get a deck for my pneu build. Too much to chose from.

Again, great work you have shared here with us. Thank you!

You can definitely take a hacksaw the cut the hangar a little bit. Just measure the wheels from outside of one bearing to outside of the other and decide how much of the hangar you might want to remove. 

Which adapter did you print, do you have a pic? I updated the design to improve strength and bolt head clearance.

@willumpie82  To me the wobble is totally coming from the motion of the trucks. Probably because you are hitting the natural frequency of your trucks at certain speed. It's absolutely not an issue.

Cut of some hangar is sure one of the solution. I already think about that option.  But I have another one. Cut of some axle and cut new thread. Axle is 8mm so i can cut m8 thread on it. If I leave 10mm of axle and make new spacer with outh diameter of 10mm and m8 hole I can screw wheel with m8 bolt on axle...I have to take some time to figure it out. One is for shure I dont want to pay extra 100€ for trucks. 
I printed this adapter.

2 motor sprockets, 2 chains, chain links, 2 wheel sprockets. You still need a chain tool, which might run you up to 15€, but if you can get a used one it might even be free. That's pretty much all you need. I will design an adapter plate in coming days to make sprockets mountable.

Also only downside is the need to get flat plate sprockets and machine (drill press) them (center hole and attachment holes).

```

---
## \#826 Posted by: murloc992 Posted at: 2019-04-05T09:51:45.216Z Reads: 132

General thickness. Seems to be 1 inch tubes, the originals are 2 inch. I have the exact same ones locally for similar price, but I remember they looked too flimsy to even look usable. The idea is, they will stretch same "wall thickness" way more than the initial 2 inch tube making the inflated tube walls thinner and more prone to becoming flat from anything sharp or instant impact.

Also unsure about the valve stem being better. Less rubber is holding it, not sure about max pressure.
```

Yeah Not so sure about the general thickness. They looked the same to me. And I like that stem more because my original lost air because the hole in the hub nicked the rubber on the stem. Can't happen with this one. And I like the thread at the base. Makes it possible to fix it into place and not have it loose.

Alright. Small feedback. They are thinner. But they fit well enough. The only reason I tried these out is because of the long wait from China.
Here some pics. I hope I can ride them next week or so when I hacked some mounts together.

this! I been rocking this new re-boot for a few days... a billion times better than my first skateshred deck like mhboards has...but when u dont know better u dont know better... its so buttery smooth and carvy yet rigid....almost feel like im pumping it at high speed vs "high speed carving"

Hey,, thank you very much for your help and link to this deck. Sad the shipping is 35USD to Europe.
If the shipping wouldn't be so high I would have bought it! :)

I need to look for a good/cheap drop down deck here in europe/germany.
So I know now that it's going to be a drop down deck. 


Man, I can not thank you enough for your kind help! :slight_smile:

Hey im using these wheels for a hummie build. Im using the SR RKP 10mm. I took the bearings out & tried replacing eith 10mm bore bearings but the diamater of the bearing doesnt fit. Which bearing fit in the hun for 10mm ??
Someone here posted these but its gonna come out like over $50 for 8 bearings 😟 any other options or link

Will run the 3D printed ones first to see how they perform.

 @murloc992
Thanks for your help.. I had calculated them and got a belt length of about 375mm without idlers. So your suggested 400mm with idlers is what I will go with. I think one idler on the slack side would be enough. Thanks for your help...

I started off with the 3d printed PETG pulleys worked fine but I noticed a big reduction in vibrations when I switched to aluminium, Also you can't tighten the bolts to far on the plastic pulley, it will strart cracking, you'll have to add locknuts on the screw ends.

If they are printed properly, they will not crack at all. I tightened mine at 20Nm and nothing happened. Mainly has to do with dimensional accuracy, because the holes could be printed unersized and then they might crack on greater loads.

A little late in the game. Took somewhat a different approach. Identical deck used as mishrasubhransu. Opted to not cut the deck for wheel bite. Instead, moved hanger forward toward nose of deck and redrilled mounting holes. No wheel bite. Used TB reverse motor mounts with 6355's mounted inward. No issues with motors hitting deck. Used the versa pulleys with spacers to get proper clearances. The next project is to make a custom fiberglass enclosure for it. ![GEDC0265%20(640x428)|640x428](upload://qE3g6iYh4zbBvYNluehj11ZpyS7.jpeg) ![GEDC0264%20(640x428)|640x428](upload://gZOt6naofFUTgPyyJ27CfzYjCFC.jpeg)

Hey @willumpie82 ,
I realize this is a little old, and you probably have it solved, but...  For others solving this same issue.  

 - In the video - It appears that the outer bearing is not seated.  It should be flush with the rim. 

Make sure that the bolt pattern for your rim is the same as the pulley.  I have the same rims bought from the same vendor linked on this page - But... My bolt pattern for my wheels is 40mm.  The pulley adapter from this thread printed as is - is 41.57mm.  Not the same..  If you force the bolts through, then the pulley may be off one side or the other.  
- When the wheel is spinning (in the video) the motor is wobbling back and forth.  This can be caused by the pulley not being aligned with the axle, the pulley out of round, pulley or wheel loose, incorrect seating of bearings, motor mount misalignment (not likely as the belt seems to maintain its position), and I am sure I am missing a couple.  
Hope this helps.  

When tightening the adapter, and the pulley to the wheel - It is best to have an actual **8mm rod to slide through the wheel while tightening it up**.  This helps keep everything perfectly straight.  If you willy-nilly just tighten it all up on a table or in your hand, then you may have a 1-3 mm offset within the wheel.  These are not precision wheels - They are cheap 2 piece wheels that need to be aligned properly.  If you do not have an 8mm rod - at least tighten the pulley and adapter while it is on an axle to assist in alignment.  
Just my two cents to help :slight_smile:

The new dickyho 60t pulleys are great. I did have to redrill them to get the holes right for the tires I had purchased (separately) that were slightly off. 
I went from a 15T motor pulley to an 18t motor pulley and the range was greatly approved. 
I will do a proper range test and report back on the spreadsheet. ![IMG_20190421_211626|666x500](upload://bSe7jpV1BpNbFYOR7MkRol82uqF.jpeg) ![IMG_20190421_211641|374x500](upload://7CwwXJvvXyTdHsFBpTIeGRFVd0r.jpeg)

[/quote]

Hey @MTboard, Great Job! Looks amazing.  Did you try the plastic, or printed pulleys?  OR, Do you notice a "deceleration" when you let off the throttle?   I am still trying to figure out why these tires have such poor range compared to my 110 Superfly's...

The big difference is obviously "pneumatic tires".  But... There is also the larger plastic pulleys, dual pulleys (in my case), and a larger 15mm belt.   

I was thinking of milling out an aluminum pulley... I am also thinking of going single motor.

Can't wait to see what your range comes out too...

I never tried the plastic, or printed on these 6x2 wheels. I was going to order some plastic pulleys the same day I saw Dickyho's post selling aluminum for basically the same price. They arrived in 9 days, super fast from china.

I don't have much of an issue with deceleration when letting off the throttle.  I've found that you can minimize the deceleration with two major factors:
1. Keep your air pressure to the max (70psi on these wheels) 
2. Really fine tune the belt tightness. An Idler helps with this of course. Belts being too tight really slow you down quickly. Plus it makes everything work harder than needed. Btw I am using a 15mm belt also.

You have the capability to mill aluminum? If you do make them, what pulley ratio would you go with?

Excuse the dumb question, but which way are the threads supposed to point? Surely there is some logic behind orienting the wheel threads regarding the spin direction? :thinking:

![image|420x500](upload://uCN05rWrn8w1pKP8Ruwgfmn6uEu.jpeg)

I've seen people use these both ways. Does this go in the same category as "**which way should the toilet paper roll be oriented**" ?

Around 100km in and I've noticed a slight chip in my 3D printed PETG pulley. Thin outer lip against the tyre. Not in a critical spot, but enough for me to start thinking about replacing them with Aluminium pulleys.

![image|375x500](upload://nAw6QaqG1AIgWUK4uLpMdwnd8pW.jpeg)

EDIT: Upon further inspection, some of the spokes have started snapping as well. Time to print new ones (maybe ABS this time) while I wait for aluminium ones. Also updated my results in the range sheet @captclearleft posted above.

Thanks @niuva - The more people that update their data the better we all will know what works best...  (bad English, but the point is there... )
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLauFkuETBBs0kpOKL1sq-mk-qy21Do_cL4xsoutPQg/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLauFkuETBBs0kpOKL1sq-mk-qy21Do_cL4xsoutPQg/edit#gid=0)  
I was wondering when these printed gears would give.  I redesigned all of them as my bolt patern was different (same wheels off aliexpress - not sure what happened there).  And I removed some of the spokes, and filled it in some - Also made it so that I could put the bolt in the other way and add a nut...  Let me know if anyone wants those files.  @niuva - I would stick with the PETG (Or Nylon or Polycarb).  My experience with ABS is - Its not that strong, and strangly brittle...  Maybe it would mage a good gear... But my thought is - PETG is a prety strong and flexible medium....  Just my 2 cents....


Thanks @MTboard - That all makes sense.  I will try inflating to 70psi, and I will loosen up the belt a bit.  I am currently using 16x42 for the gears.  I was using 16x60.  16x60 seemed to be unnecessary and unused torque... So I went to the 42 gears to see if I could get some range.  I might have gotten 1/2 to a mile extra range, but thats it.  
When I mill out the pulley, I will go with what I am getting the best results with at the time.  
I have new batteries coming Monday (They will put me at 12s2p - 16ah)...  
I will run the 42s first to see what my range is (hoping for 25miles).  Then I will probably switch to the 50 tooth gears...

I keep getting tiny pebbles stuck in between my gears and pulley. The 60T pulley is so massive that external gunk just finds its way there easily and none of my old pulley guards really fit my TB V4 mounts anymore. Might end up designing something for 3D printing.
Also noticed that the spokes on the pulleys really like to catch debris between them and the edge of the motor mount and that results in them snapping. Probably the best way for me to explain this is this image. :smiley:

@niuva, Ya I had/have that problem (debris)  with my 110 Superfly board.  It has tighter clearances as the motor is mounted under the board, and it has aluminum gears.  Pebbles still get in there...  AND - I dont ride on dirt...
As for my 6x2 board - I opted to "not" use the idler as I felt that kept everything too close to the mounts. I wasnt sure if the idler would help...  I'm starting to think it might help with "loosening up the belts".  My belts are not real tight, but maybe with the idler I could run the belts a little looser and the board would coast a little better...

@Bataleon,

Thats good to hear.  I didn't see a difference between the 60t and the 42t.  They both get the same range [(range sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLauFkuETBBs0kpOKL1sq-mk-qy21Do_cL4xsoutPQg/edit#gid=0).    

I thought for sure when I took off the 60s, and put on the 42's that I was going to see an increase in range...  Nope.   If anything - Like you said - The motors just get hotter.  lol...  I rode yesterday (20mi)  I carry an extra battery(ies).   It was almost exactly 10 mi when the my first battery went out...  
I now have new batteries getting ready to install.  My battery box prints are finishing up this morning.  When It's done - I will go from a 5ah 12s1p to a 16ah 12s2p...  At my calculation I was getting 2mi/1ah (at that weight).  If that holds true (disregarding increase weight). I should get 32mi...  I will update the range sheet when I ride this Saturday.

Thanks heaps. Yep the 45mm worked... 

Do you need spacers / washer etc when you put the wheel on TB 218? It’s like a few mm to close and the pulley seems to just slight rub against the motor mount bracket screws

I personally used two 0.5mm speed rings and one 628 bearing. Wheel->speed ring->bearing->speed ring.

If it's too much spacing you can also use one 608 bearing instead of 628.

Yes, a normal longboard/skateboard thin 8mm inner diameter (10mm outer) wheel washer. Most of the time they come in 1mm thickness, but there's also thinner ones at 0.5mm. :slight_smile:

I tried out 16x50 gears today.  We did a [20 mile round trip to down town Denver Co](https://www.meetup.com/ESK8-Denver/events/261007512/).
16x50s is the best so far for me.  Great response with a better or same range as the 16x42s.  I have also tried 16x60s.  
For some reason, the 16x50s seem to roll better too.  NOTE: I run my belts a little loose.  No Idler.  A very slight press on the belt deflects a little more than a 1/4-3/8" (7-8mm).  
I am using 4 x 6cell 8ah Lipos (12s2p).  After 20 miles my battery shows 47.9% remaining.  That's pretty good.  This was all real nice flat paved trail.  

Has anyone else had such good luck with 16x50 gears?

I have been using 16X50 right from the start :sunglasses:

The wheel gear is 3D printed in ABS(one solid and the other spoke version) and I have completed 800km on it already and still working great. I'll do a 1000km update showing details of wear and tear.

Hey @jezza ,
 You can check out the range sheet to compare your current setup (and your weight), to see what you might expect: [Range Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLauFkuETBBs0kpOKL1sq-mk-qy21Do_cL4xsoutPQg/edit#gid=0)

I have tried just about all the different wheels that have been on this forum ([excluding the new TB 110's](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-tb110-really-big-wheels/75938))

The science is simple: Bigger wheels = better/easier on your legs an ankles.  
As far as range.  You are going to have better range with your 100MBS's - by at least 50%.  As in, plan on loosing at least half your range by going with pneumatic tires.  I have gotten really good range out of my pneumatics by adding a ton of battery.  There is no way around that.  But the ride and cost is worth it.  [Check out this by Evolve.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGG-vy5OriI)

Another downside with pneumatics is weight.  As you start to build one of these monsters, you quickly add a ton of weight (and resistance) to the board.  

If you want a cheaper try at a balanced approach - maybe get some used 110mm SuperFlys, or check out those TB110s - Those look pretty good.  Like I said.  The larger tires are really nice to ride as in "comfort" - Just plan on emptying your wallet on batteries.

@jezza my experience so far is that, once you start using your board like a means of transportation your wheels are very important.  Thats why i am switching to pneumatics. For weekend ride's with friends on cool tracks PU all the way. But othewise it just gets so annoying having to stop take the board up in your hands or beeing unable to ride over a completly destroyed road ect ect. You get the picture.

I just make test run with  new board. It runs very well with almost no vibration from road. I can go over grass. Exactly what I want.

But...it is always but. Now I have 6x2 pneumatics, before I  use orangatang 80mm whells with 48 tooth pulley.  Now I have 60 tooth.
After test ride I noticed that there is very slow acceleration than before. Is this normal or I missed something. 
My setup:
150mm whels, 230kv motor size 63-72, vesc hv4.12, 12s1p lipo, 60 tooth whell pulley, 14 tooth motor pulley, htd 5m 14mm belt, foc mode.

Acceleration of 80mm wheel/acceleration of 150mm wheel: (48\*150)/(60\*80)=1.5.So that's what you are noticing. 

You would also be noticing a 1.5(or around this value) times increase in top speed when using Pneumatics. 

Also Pneumatics have more rolling resistance, so you could be feeling a bit of that.

ah, i see you are using a big 40C (40C x 5Ah = 200A discharge max :sunglasses:) lipo, didn't read that correctly ;-)

You have fairly large motors 72mm, I think you can increase the current a bit more. your motor max can be higher than batt max. According to the datasheet you can load them upto **75A** con't and 86A peak at 20~50v

But other than that, I think your 230kv motors (I asume you have a dual drive) are more optimized for speed, not for torque. a lower KV motor gives normaly more torque and (i think 170~190KV is the sweetspot)

have a look at

Keep battery max as it is (50A) and rise Motor max for eg 70A for start and check it, if there is any difference. But as already other told, one motor is not enough for AT wheels especially this one (is recommended for heli) you need lower kv for bigger torque (140-190kv). For this motor you need definitely another gear ratio 14/60 is not good for this motor, try 12/60. There will be less speed but a little more torque ... I use 2x motor 6374 190kv with the same gearing...

like @bigmisan said, you should upgrade to dual motor (140~190kv) for this setup, AT and this gearing give so much friction that even maxing out your motor and gearing will not be enough. i guess also if you have to brake hard (if you get it setup right) you'll easilly get out of balance since one wheel is skidding.

With my setup I can lock-up both rear wheels when breaking. just brace for emergency braking and you come to a standstill in no time.

I run the following setup:
* 2x 6563 170KV
* 15/60 gearing
* 40A motor current max
* 35A current max (per esc)
* 10s3p samsung 30Q (max 3x15A discharge) 18650, DieBieMS setup to 120A cutt-off
* I'm planning upgrading to 10s4p since i get a little sag when accelerating hard (drawing 80A on 45A max battery will cause sag)

Awesome thread, tons of info! I'm planning my next board to run on pneumatic! 
Just a few quick questions:

There was a banggood link listed for the tire and hubs. Was it ever established if those are the same as aliexpress? I ask because banggood is somewhat cheaper than aliexpress?

It seems like one of the major limiting factor to efficiency is tire contact area. There are 6X1.5 tires out there. Wouldn't that make a better candidate for higher efficiency?

mechanicly the rim widty would not be a problem but take into account the hole pitch of the rim (3x42mm) if you want to use the 3D printed or alu 60t pulley from @dickyho 

Although riding on loose surface (sand/beach) is not working for me with the 6x2 tires, the narrow tires would sink in even faster. narrow tires give lower traction for e.g. braking, I already have to hang hard on the rear to not lock the wheels up on full brake (~ -45Amps)

Rims are different spoke wise and width wise. Spokes can be easily remedied with a custom pulley. I'm just wondering if the smaller contact patch would help or not with efficiency at the cost of something else.

Has anybody tried pumping tires with those c02 cartridges? I think it'd be something simple to carry around and to have when you're in a pinch.

I know haggys are just slightly under 6inch wheels. Do we know if their tubes and tires will fit the hubs from aliexpress? Or are haggy hubs also physically smaller too?

Haggy hubs and tyres are interchangeable with the OG 6x2 Ali setup.
