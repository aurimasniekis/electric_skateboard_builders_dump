Yeah, it's junk. Non standard chain and the size that come with it would have your motor mount a foot long.  So you end having to buy tools.  Nothing will get you past throwing greese all over everything. 

What caused you to tear a belt?  It's typically too much tension or misalignment.

Its not tecniccly ripped but The bumps that go into gears, Are stripped. I think ITS because i have way to little tension on The belt

I beg to differ with regards to the grease all over everything... My chain drive is waxed rather than greased or oiled and it's been fantastic so far after 1 year....

This kit is OK, but you'll need to split the chain and shorten it, so you'll need an 04B chain splitter which is not your normal bicycle chain splitter... much smaller.

When I made mine this kit wasn't available so I had to fabricate my own. If it was however I'd have definitely bought this....

isn't a chain drive really noisy and rough compared to belt drive?

Ok, no offense but it sounds pretty noisy to me.

I imagine that's just rolling noise to be honest... there's next to no noise from the drive train... Lemme see if I can find a more clearer example in another video...

Actually, after watching a couple of other videos I reckon it's more motor noise as this SK3 is pretty noisy...

That sounded like how i'd imagine a chain drive to sound, which is noisy...
