Wouldn't you just need to heat up the pulley only in order to dilatate the aluminum but North the street axle?

Bore in pulley is a bit larger than axle so it doesn't matter, because it is tight fit. I just heat it to soften glue (loctite).
But anyways i usually heat pulley instead of axle. This time i tried to watch tv at same time so..:D
