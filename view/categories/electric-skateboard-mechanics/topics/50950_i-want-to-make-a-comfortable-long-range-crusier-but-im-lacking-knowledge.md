Hi! I want to scrap the dumpster fire that was my last build and really smash it home with this build. 

So far I've got: 
⭐Sector 9 Kiss of Death as my deck - nice and hard, fits me perfectly :slight_smile:
⭐10s5p battery from diyeboard - a cheap battery I know but I cant help but make every battery I touch die so I figured that a cheap battery will hold me over until I can learn not to cause them to break
⭐Trucks : im debating on using these trucks ( the 10 inch version though :) )(https://calibertruckco.com/product/ii-fifty/), 
⭐ all terrain wheels like the ones found on diyeboard (http://www.diyeboard.com/6-15050mm-70a-airless-allterrain-wheels-with-hubs-pulleys-p-587.html?zenid=mmck96hie4aasof60f6k3jkht4 ) 
⭐Motors: 6355 190kv motor from torqueboards ( just reusing an old motor until I can get some new cans :slight_smile:
⭐Vesc: torqueboards vesc, its treated me well, no reason to throw them out yet :stuck_out_tongue:

I was hoping I can get some expertise on the products ive chosen, as in if the trucks will support the size of my tires, and if the motor can pump wheels that big, last time I used it was on 90mm clones

Once I get home and start working ill be waiting until my paycheck to start this beast!

Being AT build cheaping out is going to cost you a lot more than you think. First that battery 10s5p diyeboard, dont  think that battery can dischard more than 50amps its cheap battery cells put together only a 365wh battery at 5p. Second AT boards tend to stress your vesc a lot more , depending on what u mean by'AT" as in trampa type of think like offroad then your going to need a vesc 6 or just every now and then ride on grass or small dirt then focbox but guarantee your going to blow that vesc from dielectric.

You will need very wide trucks to prevent wheel bite.
Wheel deck bite and wheel foot bite is an issue!
Dual drive is a good idea, but not 100% necessary.
The HW 4.12 can handle it if you use relative low KV motors (120-140kv) and a twin setup, splitting strain to two ESCs. Gear down to 22mph, 35km/h. I would use 12S batteries to lower the amp flow as much as possible.

im sorry i meant the 107mm wheels, to me that seems large enough to call all terrain :o

do you think that the 10 inch caliber trucks i linked earlier would work?

what type of board would be good for the 107 superflys? Currently I have a Kiss of death shaped like this: ![image|500x500](upload://aCaDYRj6WmL4t19M0QenZQWIJ8M.jpg)

This deck is super solid, it got ran over by a car once and it's still alive, been riding this thing for a year and tortured it, concaves are great, graphic is awesome, theres a bunch of holes everywhere and it's still alive.

Sometimes I think my deck is going to snap bc of the way I treat it but it just survives everything

With 10in caliber 2s and deck with those cutouts you won't have any wheel bite. I have an Arbor drop cruiser (drop-thriugh with cutouts) and 7in AT wheels and 1/4in risers, it's not possible to get wheel bite, there's a small possibility of my foot hitting the wheel but I have to be leaning at 39 degrees for it to be an issue.

Focbox will do fine, even under hardcore off-road conditions. It just needs proper cooling/preferably a dual case with fins.

Dump this battery and get a 10s4p 30Q at least. Otherwise this will be your weakest spot and will fail you pretty fast due to the low discharge cells they use. You won´t have a "beast" you´ll have a slow pony..

once again the issue of money comes up... lol

Honestly I want range over speed and this pack seems like it wouldnt be too bad. I want the range for my schools longboarding group and the NYC group rides, my pack last time was struggling :stuck_out_tongue:

if you have any suggestions.... be my guest ;P

do you think my vescs will work with 107mm superflys? I wouldnt even mind underpowering the motor to get it to work, I want distance and a comfy ride, not something that can rip up asphalt haha

I think caliber trucks are cheaper from amazon.com

Trust me, this pack will struggeling again after a few weeks. It´s underbuild and too heavy. You´re going to buy twice. Better safe up a bit more and get a real pack ;)

That pack is like $200 shipped. For that you can get 8 3s 5000mah lipos. So that’s be 12s 10,000mah capable of 200amp continuous discharge. Good for about 24 to 30 miles depending on how you ride. 

I know a lot of people here aren’t a fan of lipos but I’ve used them on 2 of my Boards and 1 I built for a friend and they perform perfectly for over a year now. As long as you take care of them, they’ll take care of you.

can you link me to come of the more robust and heavy duty packs that allow me to achieve at least 20 miles with decent discharge?

I would be using a torqueboards vesc and 107mm superflys and torqueboards 190kv 6355 motors


What gearing do you think I should use? I have the pulleys and what not from my 95mm setup before.... are those reusable?

also charging... can you link me to the charger you use? I see you alot on here and I havnt heard too many complaints!


edit: sorry for so many questions but Im dying to know so I can sort all the pieces in my head

If you use 8 of these in a 12s2p layout, you'll have as much discharge as you'll ever need (200 amp continuous) and at least 20 miles of range (probably closer to 30 miles depending on riding style) https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-20c.html

For pulleys, you can probably use the same ones you used on 95mm. Almost as pulley ratio is acceptable, but remember that a ratio closer to 1:1 will result in higher top speed and less torque and a ratio farther than 1:1 will result in more torque and range. Use an esk8 calculator to figure out which pulley set-up works best for you.

I use this charger, but keep in mind it is intended to charge the entire battery at once (i.e. still in its 12s2p configuration since it should only be used to charge 12s batteries) https://www.ebay.com/itm/50-4V-2A-Power-Adapter-For-Self-Balanced-Vehicle12S-Li-ion-Battery-Charger-Plug/291922334252?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649

thanks! If I wanted to choose batteries that resulted in less amps, but the same amount of mah would that be ok for a 190 kv motor? im just looking for range (15 miles of actual riding, not the guesstimated mileage ) and 15-20 mph, nothing more.

also how do you connect these batteries? I would be worried with the amount of connections for the battery as a whole, that something I did would fail and make it all go boom :cry: 

once again, thank you for your help :)

Yeah you could get some lower discharge, higher capacity batteries, but in most cases those will be lower quality. Your best going with zippy or turnigy brand batteries. I use 4 of those batteries I linked in a 12s1p confit and get 12-14 miles of real riding. So 12s2p (using 8 of those batteries) would for sure get you more than 20 miles range. 

You’d need to connect 4 of those batteries in series to make 12s, then the other 4 in series in the same way to make 2 12s packs. Then connect those 2 packs in parallel to make 12s2p. I can make you a diagram if you want. And you’d want to solder in a power switch, a battery percent display as well. Do you have access to a soldering iron?

I feel you, I’m in the same boat. It’s a balancing act of not going so cheap that I end up with junk but at the same time not spending more than about $1k on any given build.

I agree, lipos are f*ing amazing. High discharge compact form factor and cheap as hell. @Sn4pz if you haven’t bought that 10s5p battery I suggest to buy lipos instead.

I am going to be making a dual hub board, initially I was going to use a bunch of 2s lipos but everyone recommends Li ion. I am use to Lipo but i am just worried about their life cycle dont lipos have a much shorter life cycle than Li ion? I just discovered diyeboard and was going to buy from there. Should I go the lipo route? I am sorry for thread jacking!  Lipos are about the same cost as a battery from diyeboard and it is much more convenient. @pat.speed @pennyboard

I personally haven’t used anything but lipos and I think they are great, they deliver high amps with minimal sag and have a super easy to work with form factor. 

Most say that lipos will have around 300 life cycles at normal use. Although if treated well they will have much more. If you want longer living cells only discharge to around 3.4-3.7v per cell, store them at ~3.85v and don’t charge them anymore than 4.2. Some might say only charging to 4.15 or less will increase life cycles but I’ve heard that’s not true for lipos, only Li-ion.


Edit: Let’s use my battery as an example I can ride for around 20km on a charge and let’s say I get 350 charge cycles (I discharge down to about 3.2-3.4v so a bit less than others the only discharge to 3.7v). That would mean that I can get something like 7000km out of my battery before I need to replace it, now that’s pretty damn good so I wouldn’t be worrying about it too much unless you are going to be doing 20-30km every day, 5 days a week.
