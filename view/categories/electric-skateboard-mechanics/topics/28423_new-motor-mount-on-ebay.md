I was browsing ebay and I found this motor mount. 
https://www.ebay.com/itm/152628880966 
What do you guys think of this? Is the seller on the forum?

It's compatible with 63mm motors and caliber trucks

Man, that sucks. Did you release your mount design under Creative Commons etc. or was it a straight copy?
