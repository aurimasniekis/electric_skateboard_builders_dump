Hello everyone :slight_smile:
I have a question about weather or not my enclosure will be big enough. I will be using the new Enertion VESC-X and their wireless remote reciever. I will also have 2 5000 mAh LiPo batteries

 - 2x LiPo: 51 x 143 x 22 mm
 - 1x VESC: 64 x 64 23 mm
 - 1 Reciever: 25 x 20 x 22 mm
 - Loop Key, Charger plug, Voltmeter, Sticking out a side.

Will this be big enough?
