Hello community, 

This is a topic I've been working on for some time now and I bring it up again because I think it might be useful to those interested. Additionally, I would like to give credit to the work of others whose ideas and products gave my configuration shape. 

I built a board in May, and quickly realized that the most enjoyable part of eSkating is blasting up hills! Opinion aside, I built a board for exactly that purpose. 

The problem with belt tension and the skipping teeth pissed me off, but also terrified me when braking downhill. The motor noise under heavy tension, and the strain on the hardware was unacceptable to me, so I set out to eliminate it.

I read a few posts about the benefit of idler pulleys, but couldn't find any (inexpensive) caliber2 motor mounts that had 'em. So I started modifying the parts I already had and came to a solution. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/f/bfab296c4a517b85e8bcab8fc6533d416b2dc553.jpg" width="666" height="500">

That is a torqueboards mount with a shoulder -bolt (8mm x 20), standard skateboard bearings, a bunch of speed-washers, and a flange nut. I barely have the clearance between the wheel and motor, so I wanted to try a new configuration. 

I purchased the incredibly well made reverse-mount from torqueboards, to free up some ground clearance, and for the space it afforded for the idler. After some rudimentary measurements, i drilled a hole and bolted it up. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/0/50019147bbb1af209eb059001c16ccf462460e8d.jpg" width="374" height="500">

The pulley requires a longer belt, and I found that the ideal fit is in the 340-355 mm range. The configuration below is with a 340-5m-15 from D&D Powerdrive (Amazon) and fits well, but is at the lower limit of the CTC range of the motor plate in a 15/40 tooth ratio. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/b/9b1727e2b157a4506b6ce44354d2c24947eeccec.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/f/0f36cff3c4b4f851cc72efb1ced34c5e672194c3.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/a/5a650cb320d36f8573aea3b6c92ea9f14c5854a6.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I will be running a 15/36 tooth ratio on the other wheel (for higher top speed), and will add to this post when I get it put together later today. 

As I mentioned earlier, the purpose of this post is to help others in eliminating the belt tension/skipping-teeth trade-off. I also would like to see more options out there for sale that come with an idler!! 

As far as "credit wherecredit is due" my inspiration for the mod is an article by @JuniorPotato93 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/does-the-location-of-an-idler-pulley-bearing-affect-the-usable-life-of-a-belt/13036

And thanks to @torqueboards for the hardware that accommodates the modification. Dexter's reverse mount is the first I've seen that has the CTC headroom for my needs, and I couldn't be happier with it! 

Again, this is a simple addition to a brilliant product that is intended to improve braking capabilities and acceleration, and extend the belt/hardware life in high performance builds. Gotta go set up the other motor, and more results will follow. 

Thanks for reading, I hope this was beneficial so far.

Nice work! Just FYI, it's better to put the idler on the slack side of the drive train. What did you use to drill a hole into the mount?

@pat.speed no its fine. 
@Jinra you are right, he does have it on the slack side though.  
@PatRocks I have been saying this for a LONG time now! Idler pulleys are the best! I will never build another board without them. If anyone has an obsession with idlers it's me LOL.

I just drill a 7.5mm hole and thread an 8mm bolt through.
you can even drill an 8mm hole and use a nut on the other side to hold it.

Idler are working great for me. Way more brakes. The bend doesn't even have to be that much. Only issue i had is the idler bearings lost all the oil quickly. Im trying white lithium grease now. Heard smaller 8x16x5 might be better for high speed that idler spins at.

I've order some 6mm bore bearings to do just this. I tried using standerd 22mm bearings with its 8mm bore is just too big for v4 diy mount. 

One of the bearings I ordered are 14mm, and the other ones are 17mm. So I hope to have plenty of room. 

I'm planing on having maybe two idle pulleys per mount. One for forward movement, and one for braking. I didn't see a lot of talk about duel idle pulleys, but it will mesh more teeth, and it should allow me  to run a loosed belt so that should be good.

Eventually, I'll replace the 6355 with a second 6374. For now, the two are just fantastic together. I'm running both speed controllers as masters, so the gears don't matter. I also would like to play with different kv motors, for the "turbo" effect on top speed

So you're using bolts as a shaft, the bearings are rotating on the threads? Or do you file the thread down?

Do you put speed rings in between the bearings as well or only on outer sides?

Lastly, if using 6mm bearings, what do you use instead of a speed rings?

There's enough tension on the bearing for it to spin without causing the bit on the bolt to spin along the bolt (less friction on the actual ball bearings than on the bolt).

You can also use an 8mm hex bolt in a slotted hole for adjustment, needs a washer to provide a shoulder for a solid fit. That is basically what we use on our idler mount with some added lathe work to eliminate a speed ring and make the assembly a little more narrow in our more recent iterations.  Belt looks really tight, it needn't be. The extra tooth engagement allows us to run loose belts without stripping belts. Running loose belts with an idler provides a little more efficiency and longer belt life.  
  
A smaller bearing should give you the slack you need since your idler is stationary. Nice to see idler's become more mainstream. Wont be long before every mount on the market has one!

@guyguy took some good shots of our motor mounts disassembled and posted them somewhere. Our motor mount is a bit different now and made specifically for Ronin Cast trucks, might be able to modify some Rogue trucks and use it on those also. The mechanics of the system are basically the same.  I am also working towards a similar setup for trampa trucks.

I've been looking at your mounts for a while, They're freakin' sick!!! I really like the full-floating hub-type wheel pulley, seems like a  design from the automotive industry. Rotational bearings are not best suited for thrust-bearing applications, and it appears that your design serves to eliminate the extra stress, no?

You could trying a 5mm hole with a bolt with a 6mm smooth shoulder, and a bearings that are 17mm or about the size of a dime. This could give you the room you need. A standard skate bearing are about 22mm with a 8mm bore. So about the size of a nickle. Ive been using coins to play around with my clearance, and see what fits. I'm planing on  two pulleys, and it looks like 285 belt will work just fine.

This is a reverse mount, and as such, the pulley IS on the slack side. @Lawndart i have used the 626z bearings, and to be honest, the 608's (skate bearings) afforded a better bend around the motor pulley with less intrusion in the driveline

Nice to see this topic about idler wheels, I also use them and my drive train performs very well. I can go up insanely steep hills without slip using a 12T (too small) motor pulley and minimal belt tension. As soon as I change to a 15T motor pulley I think it would do even better and need less frequent belt adjustment.

I used two idler wheels, which looks great, but honestly I dont think it is much better (if at all) than a single idler.

I face the same problem that on a normal size motor mount, the wheel is in the way such that you cant place the idler bearings, especially when you use 97mm wheels like me there is zero space. So what I did is I took two normal shoulder bolts, put them in the lathe, and cut off the head until it is only 0.5mm. I then used a saw to make a slot in the other (threaded) side for using a flat head screw driver. This way the idler bearings can sit between the wheels and the motor mounts as you can see in the picture.

Ok, you guys have talked me into using idler pulleys. I will have to use a bolt with a very small head as there really isn't much room with the pneumatics. I would prefer to use a smaller bearing since I don't have much room. I don't have a way to machine a slot in the motor mount plate so I will have to run a fixed bolt and move the motor for belt tension. Any suggestions before I scour my local Lowe's and Home Depot for hardware tomorrow?

I like what you did with the shoulder bolts. I'm thing of doing the same, bet I could do something close but with a angle grinder, some files, and a drill press. Won't be as pretty but I should be able to had finish it decently. 

Great ideas all around, really helping be brain storm my own idle pulley.

Low and home depots just make me mad. They never seem to have the right bolt, screw, or tool, and the staff is kinda dumb when it comes to a lot stuff. 

Ace is the place if you have then in your town. Look for one of the larger stores if you can. They have a nice deep fastener inventory. 

I'm planning on looking this weekend and will report back.

Perhaps the most viable option for an idler is to press-fit a few bearings onto a shaft that is threaded on one side... or maybe glue? I played with these ideas for a while before I found the shoulder-bolt that fit into the short mount

Keep in mind that the smaller the idler wheel, the more stress it puts on the belt, this reduces its strength and it wont last as long. For this exact same reason its not advised to use 12T motor pulleys or smaller, 14T or higher gives you better belt life and less tendency to skip as well. For idler wheels use skate bearings(22mm i think) at the very least, but a bit lager would be even better, you can also order real idler pulleys on ebay with various dimensions.

Agreed. Additionally, smaller bearings must rotate at significantly higher rpm. The larger bearings afford a better wrap around the motor pulley with less intrusion for space

I dig that it's nice to not have to hand torque the motor to set tension, but this seems like it just adds an additional point of failure and wears it belts faster.  

The only upside I can see it more contact for the belt in the pulleys but if the belt is tensioned correctly slippage shouldn't be an issue. Am I wrong?

Partial credit. The main problem with belt tension is motor wear. Belts are cheap, and very strong. Motors do not have the bearings for both rotational and torsional thrust. Ive already wiped a set of motor bearings with tight belts. Ever have any problems with wheel pulley alignment? A loose belt will absorb some of that vibration as well

Lol, street face is right!! Yea, elasticity is one of the primary benefits of a belt drive versus chain. That and maintenance.

 So, to summarize this entire thread: the trade-off between tension and tooth skipping, can come at the cost of either broken belts or wiped motor bearings, or both.
```

## \#85 Posted by: Stef Posted at: 2017-08-13T02:21:36.085Z Reads: 416

```
If designed properly, idler wheels can:
* Prolong belt life
* Increase torque transfer ability without skipping
* Reduce required frequency of belt tensioning
* Increase motor bearing life
* Reduce drag in belt system, increasing the efficiency and thus range of the board. 

So there are lots of benefits! Of course you have to design it properly for it to work well, as with any other component on your board.

Edit: I should explain why I think idlers can improve belt life:

You can run them with way less tension, in my case without tension works perfectly. This reduces strain and thus improves belt life. Not skipping teeth also greatly prolongs life of the actual teeth on the belt (and motor pulley too if its aluminum or plastic)
```

In my case the idler reduced drastically the belt life, so i'm against them, my theory it that it increases the fatigue of the fiber strands inside the belt by bending them more than necessary

yes, i used idler for a very long time before coming to this conclusion, 19mm if i'm not mistaken

when i jumped to a quality made steel pulley all my skipping problems were gone, running 12/36

---
## \#89 Posted by: Stef Posted at: 2017-08-13T02:35:32.375Z Reads: 421

```
So 19mm is a rather small diameter, skate bearings like most of use as idlers are 22mm and that is already a bit small for 5M belts. This may have cause a lot of extra strain in the belt (bending + tension).

Either way, if you get no teeth skipping without an idler and without a lot of tension on your belt then you dont really need one. 

Also, the best way to avoid teeth skipping is wider belts, so if you can fit it onto your truck (i couldnt), get 15mm, you wont regret it.

I agree, according to gates design manual the minimum for the 5M profile should be 30mm, but that's too bulky to our usage, i think the main problem most people encounter is low quality pulleys, the aluminium ones with a few hundred kilometers  on them already start to wear down, leading to skipping that accelerates this process

I'm already running 15mm, the accelerated wear i experienced is due to several factors, first a 12T pulley bends the belt too much, with a single drive the strain gets even bigger, join that with road debris and ocasional ridding on wet roads and as result the belt is severely punished

For my next built i gone bigger with 15/34, reducing bending fatigue, and dual drive with smaller motors, when it start to rain again i plan to test a spray that help to increase friction and also protects from water, that will take a while since it has been more than 3 months without a single drop of water from the sky

I have to agree with @Stef my belt tension seems to be perfect,iv towed my mate up a very steep hill on his trike loaded up with fire wood for a beach bbq.
Over 35 stone/490lb but I don't get much if any slippage,the only reason I can see for iddlers is if you can't find the sweet spot and wear down your pulleys constantly then it's a good fix! but for me it's if it ain't broke dont fix it!

Ok so I made my idlers and have them installed. Now for the belt length. I am attaching a picture of a belt that I cut so itvwiukd he flat gorbgaugung where to put my pulleys. When I wrap the belt around the pulleys as it will run I can line it up on the large pulley and count now many additional teeth I will need. The belt had 72 teeth and I need a remaining 16 teeth that it doesn't cover. Would I be correct in assuming I need a 440 belt? My motors are close to the end of the mounts so I will slide them in about 1/8" so I was thinking I could get by with a pair of 420 belts?

They created a bit more resistance. Since removing them I haven't had any issues with belt skipping so I have kept them off.

Makes sense. I'd assume you were not having a whole lot of problem with slippage due to your huge motor pulley, 22t iirc. I wonder if it would have been the same non issue had you chosen to run a less insane ratio with a motor pulley of 13-16t. :)

There is a hill on my route to work that is steep enough that some cars have problems with while raining and I can ride up it about 22mph at about 3/4 throttle, of course while it is dry. Down hill herebis scare if you build to much speed!

I'm telling you, the extra 1 or 2 teeth... They're the key to taking control of the drivetrain. I am limited by my contact-patch alone. Again, however, I urge our readers to understand that the primary benefit of the belt manipulation is to afford relief to the stress on the motor bearings. Secondary benefits may include: longer belt life, better DOWNHILL BRAKING, unrivaled hill-crushing ability, and the satisfaction of knowing you improved something that is already awesome for an extended price of about  $5+belts.

I can get the tires to spin on acceleration when not on concrete or pavement and at full brake the wheels will slide on pavement. I see no improvement gain as for tooth engagement. I do however completely agree that running looser belts by aid of an idler is much much better on the motor bearings. Especially with the added strain of pneumatics.

Damn! I just noticed the size of the wheel pulley in relation to the idler pulley. I can see that that location may do more harm than good. It would have to be much closer to the motor pulley to have any beneficial effects. The main purpose of the tensioner is to affect the smaller pulley. It seems that in your setup, the motor plate isnt wide enough for a proper pulley location 

Sorry I didn't realize that sooner, my B

In a perfect (frictionless) world, that would suffice. However, the ideal solution is a bigger pulley to minimize the bending that the belt is subjected to. The pulleys used in @chaka and @Nowind 's setups are the most ideal, for an example. You want to engage the extra teeth on the motor pulley with the least amount of intrusion into the motor mount, so as to avoid limiting the ctc range

I wouldn't recommend trying to use a smaller diameter idler.  A 608 bearing is already undersized.  The smaller the idler, the more stress on the belt

For 5mm HTD, a minimum diameter of 31.8mm is recommend for the idler.  For comparison, a 608 bearing is only 22mm  OD

@jmasta This is why you keep the idler to the slack side. If you run it on the drive side it will cause premature wear and increase drag within the drive.  During braking the slack side becomes tight but the intermittent usage does not seem to effect belt life. 

@scepterr you need to enclose your bearings with a low profile bolt to get the clearance.

What does "fix the pulley" mean? There is only so much you can do with the pulleys - the only thing left is belt tension then. How loose should it be to not be left with the same slippage as without an idler?

Shorter center to center distance(idler bearing, motor pulley), less leverage on the bearings, engages significantly more teeth.

I find I need to keep my belt pretty tight with two idlers to help eliminate belt skip on hard braking. I can still get it to skip if I gun it hard, brace myself, and then slam on the bakes.  I will be upgrading to a 15mm belt in the next week, and maybe that will let me loosing it all up a little bit. But coasting is already better and there seems to be a lot less drag in the drive train.

I don't think it is possible to run a hdt5m belt in a "skip-proof" way without completely over stressing the system. I usually get a skip or two when i _really_ jam the brake. When applied smoothly, the benefit of the pulley is that I can decelerate hard without the skip, but it will still happen under the wrong conditions
```

There really isn't a way to get no skips unless as patrocks said, you apply a significant amount of tension. What helps skipping significantly is using higher tooth pulleys. Due to our lack of clearance, we all often use smaller pulleys than what is recommended. The more teeth on the pulleys, the higher the torque transfer. I remember seeing a graph about it and there is nothing but positives as you add more teeth. Also helps belt life because it doesn't have to bend so sharply. 

As for the bearing heat, if it gets HOT something is wrong. My idler gets warm for sure but that is obvious. Anything that moves with power going through it is going to get some form of heat. Pretty sure my motor wastes 5x the energy my belt system does though.

I wasn't saying the bearing got hot, the belt does, which also heats bearings, but it's the tension on the belt causing heat. Without an idler I can run my belt looser without a single skip slamming the breaks at 25mph+, the wheels would skid, I could drift slide around corners

...mine work fantastically well. No heat in my belts, no heat in the bearings, no comparison to the way my board performed without them. I started this thread BECAUSE of the success I have had with the idlers. I researched, measured, modded, and tested it. HARD. 

The reason my configuration works is because of the length of the motor plate, and the proximity of the idler pulley to the motor pulley. 

@Deckoz The more I've thought about it, the more I appreciate the cleverness of your config. It's a brilliant way to get the angle of the belt as close as possible to the motor pulley. 

@scepterr Dude, it really sucks to hear that you are having so much trouble with your configuration. I understand how frustrating it can be to screw around with that shit all day. 

@Boardnamics your mount would work better if the idler slot was closed (for structure) or fixed position, with adjustable motor position, and a longer (CTC) plate. 

@Orin635 The location of the pulley needs to be slack-side, as close to the motor as possible to allow wheel clearance, engage as many M-Pulley teeth as possible, without over-bending (stressing) the belt. Sounds complicated, but if you think about it, and read:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/does-the-location-of-an-idler-pulley-bearing-affect-the-usable-life-of-a-belt/13036
...you'll understand the idea.

Also, wtf? just because this idea doesn't work in certain configurations, doesn't mean it doesn't work at all! I layed out my wheels, gears, pulleys and motor-can, and marked it all before I came up with the Idler mount location. Then I measured again, and drilled. Easy-money

I am super-confused.  Everyone keeps saying "slack side" but they are all referring to the side under the most tension when braking -- because during hard braking is when belts skip.  So the "slack side" when accelerating is actually the side that takes the most force [during a hard brake].

TL;DR:  the slack-side switches sides constantly

Iv'e seen the slack thing mentioned a lot. And I believe people are talking about best practices for idlers and belts not best practice for esk8 performance.

 The slack side is normally(around here) the "drive" side instead of the "braking" side because that's the way the belt is running for the majority of your ride. You are moving forward way more than you are braking. 

Most of these belts are ran one direction their entire lifespan(outside of esk8)

Do you think you it can be made to work on a shoulder bolt? If so can you sell the bearings and the part that goes around it? Really tight on space and something like this might work. For 15mm

@Titoxd10001 I tried tapping the hole, but I don't have a drill press so it turned out to be crooked. Additionally, it seems the plate is under enough stress just holding the motor without also holding an idler pulley in place. The problem with my idea is that the flange nut interferes with motor position adjustment. But I find it to be necessary for structural integrity of the idler shaft as well as for the true 90 deg. angle of the shoulder bolt.

Edit: I should really get a drill press

I have both m8 low profile screws and m6 shoulder screw. The heads are basically identical. If you're using 8mm inner diameter bearings it should work I think. Do have dimensions like width and diameter of the sleeve. That's the part I want to try

@PatRocks yeah I'm not getting enough clearance with the nut in the back. Im using a m6 shoulder bolt on my mono drive where i don't have clearance issues and it is working fine, seems sturdy and we'll aligned because there is less play between bearing and screw. I did use a drill press lol

That original picture was a 320mm belt which was to short and left my motors to low. So I moved to a 360mm belt to raise the mounts and extend the motor to the end of the slide.

If you run a 36t instead of 40t just take 20mm off (4t * 5mm) so a 340mm belt for fully extended on the reverse mount

Ive just copied what cars manufacturers seem to do, pulley on the slack side. Id not worry too much about it. Just use at least one pulley, and bare in mind the more the belt is deflected and warped the lower its life expectancy. So go for as large of a pulley as you can and use as little deflection as needed.

```
When the motor drives the wheel (accelerating): the little motor-pulley generates the belt tension, pulling the wheel into rotation. In this situation, there is very little chance of the belt skipping.

When the wheel drives the motor(braking): the wheel pulley acts against the resistive Force of the motor by pulling the belt around the little motor pulley at a highly increased likelihood to allow the belt to skip. 

Ergo, whether the majority of usage of a belt driven mechanical system is used for acceleration or deceleration does not matter. A belt is more likely to skip around the smaller pulley when it is the larger pulley generating the force.

So even if you spend 90% of your time riding downhill, using the motor as a braking Force, the most ideal location of a single idler pulley is going to be on the braking side of the belt drive. 

It's why @Nowind and @lowGuido @JuniorPotato93 and myself do it this way!!

I get some pms from time to time about links for parts. Figured it's easiest to leave it here, not sure if I have already

M4-0.7*24mm or whatever size bolt that you can Dremel off the end so that it doesn't sink to deep and short the phase wires. Socket head is necessary so you don't need a speed ring as the head is the size of the inner race of the bearings
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DIVTWYW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_7ZLqAb1SDVD0X

M4*8mm 6.5mmOD steel threaded spacer. This is necessary for the other side to sandwich 3 bearings, this is also the size of the inner race of the bearings so that speed rings aren't needed
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PKLKUX6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_2YLqAb08V3XP0

4*13*5mm bearings - high speed bearings with a double buna seal to keep dirt out. Don't use metal shielded.
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071L5FKBL/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_AQLqAbHJZYY0M

Make sure to wash the bearings when you get them, and replace the grease with a high speed oil like Bronson or OUST. Grease will create heat and these bearings will be spinning in the range of 1-18krpm depending on speed. These bearings are half the size of the 16T motor pulleys, so it's effectively 2:1. 190kv motor on 12s is about 9krpm at the top which is almost 18krpm on the bearing. Service your wheel and idlers every 150-250miles(15-25 charges depending on your range).  Cover your idlers to prevent large debris from binding between idlers and motor pulleys.

@E1Allen  Oh yeah definately. I wasn't using this exact setup before, I added the idler pulley when I switched to pneumatics, but when I switched my belt wrap on the motor pulley would have gotten worse (had I not added the idler), so I can only imagine that the skipping would have gotten worse.

Awesome contribution @PatRocks & @JuniorPotato93!  I've been trying to resolve some skipping that I've been experiencing at the lower end of rpms/acceleration curve.  I'm now having to be very cautious when accelerating as I've skipped and been thrown off my board.  I also have the same experience as you when braking.  Even after taking everything apart and make sure the pulley was centered and the tension was as hard as possible, I still had the same challenges.  This is a wicked solution.  Appreciate the time and testing that you've done!   Now, to give it a try!

To me, the main point for a longer longevity (and others equipment like motor shaft bearings) is the belt tension.
The belt can run with less tension thanks to the great coupling with the motor pulley.
I really felt the difference switching from a 6355 no idler to a 6374 with idler.

Before, I couldn't trigger an emergency braking without having the belt slipping.
Now, even with a stronger motor, I can do so, with a belt less stressed. ;)

The downside however is a worst coasting.

I didn't read every post in this thread, so forgive me if I am missing something, but other than giving the belt more contact with the drive pulleys, wouldn't idler pulleys just waste energy.  In automotive applications I believe the main reason for using them is when there is a slight angle the belt has to get around, as seen in the one posted here.  What is the advantage of an idler pulley for esk8?  Also, curious, has anyone made a setup using a spring tension for their belt?

I noticed that you said you were running the torqueboards reverse motor mounts.  Are you running a different clamp on the trucks, or are the reverse mounts set up for proper adjustment range in reverse. I know its kinda a nuisance question and off topic, but I wanted to make sure before I purchased the new mounts.  Thanks in advance!

The @torqueboards  reverse mounts are long enough to totally clear the base plate, and still have room for full adjustability. I'm using the closed D-ring clamps that so many people have trouble with (lol). I love them, never got loose even once. Great product

I'm running a 15t motor pulley, and without the idlers I either have to overtighten the belts, or they skip like machine gun fire. Idlers allow me to run loose belts without the risk of skipping

@PatRocks, that makes sense.  Thanks for the reply, I will definitely give the longer reverse motor mounts a try.

EDIT : Realized I still have one question though, what is the advantage or running belts supper loose.  Wouldn't it contribute to power lag?

It will wipe the motor bearings and can cause the shaft to walk out. Additionally, it can cause misalignment of the wheel and motor mount. Plus, if you have zero slack in the belt, guess what will happen if a stick or rock gets in there...

@C23 @PatRocks I actually have a few dual bearing tensioner version for Reverse. You can PM if you want it.

@chaka and others In your experience do idler pulleys increase efficiency?  I would think they would do just the opposite, but I have seen people say otherwise? Curious what you thought.

The benefit of a well-placed Idler simply increases the number of belt-teeth in-mesh with the motor pulley by changing the angle of the belt relative to the motor pulley. In the wrong place (too close to the wheel pulley), an idler will stress the belt system, causing unnecessary strain and decreasing efficiency. The increase of teeth in mesh, for a properly placed idler, allows greater loading capability at reduced belt tension. Trust me, the benefit of a looser belt to overall efficiency is greater than the increased resistance of the additional bearing & belt flex!!
This info is above (somewhere)!!
