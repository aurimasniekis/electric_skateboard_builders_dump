I made my own motor mounts from 6mm aluminium plate. The mounts get quite hot which is good because it means they are sucking a lot of heat out of my motors. I am considering remaking the mounts from 10mm or thicker aluminium and machining heatsink fins ~3mm deep into the back of it (opposite motor side). Is this something anyone else has tried?

Patent pending. Jason will attack you with his tiny weener

When did he apply for that patent?(btw, is [this](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-2-custom-hanger-for-better-cooling/61104?u=mishrasubhransu) going to be considered a prior art?)

Secondly, I think his patent is for trucks, not motor mount.

better watch out. Like what @brenternet said, he'll 1v1 you because you used the word heat sink. rumour has it he's suing Intel 😉

The @OllinBoardCompany mounts has some fins integrate, how much they help I don’t know

I’m also thinking off attaching some off the shelf heat sinks to my mount to help with cooling

Also test if thermal paste between motor and mount make any difference

I put thermal paste on mine because there is no downside. I will update with my fins and see if I can measure a difference.

A motor mount is not a hanger.
Totally different things. He can’t claim anything as long as he doesn’t have trademarked the name cooling fins 😂

The question is how hot does your motor get and if that’s really necessary...but definitely nice idea 👍

In addition to this, I might also drill a bunch of small diameter holes ~1mm to further increase the surface area. Most of this is going to be happening outboard of the motor, so not on any load bearing part of the mount.

On a hot day here ~40C maybe 45C close to the pavement it is easy to hit thermal throttling on the motors. It all depends how hard you want to push the motors. For me, riding is all about acceleration so I like to run high motor current, the better I can get the cooling, the higher motor currents I can run without damaging the magnets.

We can always ask @Minim, he can tell us if he was forced to use a magnifying glass!

No magnifying glass needed. Kinda common sense that if a hanger get hot then making fins to increase surface area is a way to remove heat through air cooling. I think it's been done a few years now lol
