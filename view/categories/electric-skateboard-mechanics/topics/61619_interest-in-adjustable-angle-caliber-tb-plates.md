Gauging interest and looking for feedback... Not so sure how well the lower angles would hold up in the long run, but maybe with some stronger alloy aluminum and the 5 layer sandwich design they might fare okay. If I have enough interest I might consider having some of these baseplates made at some point. 

I wanted a design that keeps the axle the same height regardless of angle so I wouldn't have to use any risers or additional wedges... maybe just a simple 1/8" shock pad at most. They are slightly taller than standard calibers by maybe 7mm or so. Angle options are 45 at center and go +/- in 6 degree increments each way.

The pivot cup support looks too weak as rendered

It looks great, but that can't be cheap. I'll keep on using wedge and risers.

Cars aren't cheap either but lots of folks buy those.  I use these things as my primary transportation and I will spend whatever it takes to get the best stuff.

A @torqueboards [218 hanger](collections/longboard-trucks/products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks) or @Kug3lis [230 hanger](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/longer-hangers-230mm-240mm-250mm/59475) would be ideal

I would go for just the base plate just to keep production costs down. As you said there's hangers out there that meet our needs.
I like the potential of being able to adjust my angles on the Fly. Maybe the first half of the day I'm just cruising but then decide to be a little bit more aggressive later on.

Thats too bad. Only found thia thread now and find it very interesting. Only SZ has this kind of offering around the forum. Would be nice to have for caliber style Base plated as well

Man did you ended up testing and produce them? If not and you do not mind I would Ike to have a look at the CAD. The design looks Esther expensive to make it but maybe I can simplify it. I have too many project on going and no time to start from zero, but I would like an adjustable base plate for Paris and caliber hanger.

Thanks :wink: I will keep you posted. I hope it feasible to bring it to life. Do you think it will fit Paris truck too? The two style are rather similar
