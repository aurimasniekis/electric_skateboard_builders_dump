Hi, 
Does anyone know the exact dimensions of the mounting holes on the trampa trucks? 
There are templates for old-school and new-school decks on the internet available, but the trampa trucks seem different than usual trucks. 
I didn't plan to create a new thread because of this question, but I couldn't find an answer anywhere on the forum or on the trampa site. 

Thanks in advance,
Detinu

Thanks, it looks like I was just searching in the wrong place :sweat_smile:
I think it would be simpler if they had put it to the trucks themselve :man_shrugging:
