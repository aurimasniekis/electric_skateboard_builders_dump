I will be using a 200mm wheel and a 170kv 6374 motor and I want a balance between speed and torque.

**How does the ratio in a chain drive work? Is it the same as a belt drive?** 


Where/what stores are chain drives/parts available? Links please.

Thanks!

The ratio is the same but the teeth count is less.
Like 9/40 or 10/40 or 10/42
Depends for sure on your requirements

Unikboards' would've been perfect! I just need the wheel and motor sprocket + chain. But it's out of stock... Anywhere else I can find a set like it?

You can get your motor sprockets and chains from here pretty cheap
https://www.gearsandsprockets.co.uk/simplex-sprockets/

I would go with iso 06b

I would sent a pm to @Nowind about wheels sprockets. He might have some in stock depending on your hubs.

You can also get wheel sprockets from the side you I linked but you would need to drill the hole pattern etc by your own.

One more option I totally forgot about could be

It's actually for an experiment/project I'm doing to "electrify" a kick scooter.

If you anyhow make it as school project I think you can find all you need on the gears and sprockets website and just modify it to your needs.

yeah ! I just got one sprocket left in stock that I can send you for free but usually people go dual. I'll get new ones by end of Feb but I can't recommend enough to contact @Nowind !

Is there a cheap place in the US? Lots of the EU sites are cheaper but shipping kills it

At $15 for a single motor sprocket?  I don't have $80 to blow on that

I mean they are top quality and you get what you pay for but still
