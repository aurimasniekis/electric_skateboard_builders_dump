Whatâ€™s the difference between the two applications ? Any advantage of using one over the other?

Similarities pointed out so far: 

* Both are accessible via Bluetooth Modules 

* Both have Telemetry viewing capabilities. 

Differences:
* Ackmaniac is Android only

* Metr/Perimetr is iOS and Android

Edit: Also turning this into a Wiki for public contribution. Better to have everything on the top post than scattered throughout the thread.

METR plugs into your vesc and gives you telemetry on the go (on your phone)

@Ackmaniac is just vesc firmware and tools (modified) and lets you do a whole lot of cool things. 
No telemetry on your phone out of the box.
Check out his thread for more info.

with metr you need to buy their bluetooth module, i think there's a mac address lock on it.

ackmaniac's you can source your own hm10 bluetooth module.

maybe metr has some better visual like the graph built into the app, but ackmaniac's outputs raw data to csv which you can then export to a visualizer after your ride.
