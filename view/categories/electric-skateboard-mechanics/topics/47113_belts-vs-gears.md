I wanted to ask why gears are not common at all in the esk8 community? The main drawbacks would be noise and lubrication, but other than that, why are belts used more than gears? Mechanically, wouldn't braking be much more effective? You wouldn't need to worry about skipping teeth on the pulleys either. You can also make the gearbox far more compact than a belt and pulley. Also don't need to worry about belt tension. Using Alloy 910 nylon filament, you could also probably print the gears even. 

So why aren't gears more prevalent?

Not to be mean, but this topic has been beaten to death such that is falls into the category of easy to maintain or using grease for lubrication. There are other factors in the decision but to the sellers it comes down to the total cost of the system. The three links I post have some overlap with each other in terms of drivetrain application. It's true a standard gearbox can be made more compact, but thinking about longevity is you need to encase spur gears to reduce metal-to-metal wear. Belts are just cheaper to replace than metal gears unless made in large scale the cost is the same.

Not mean at all, I just didn't do the research. I might try screwing around with my 3D printer for awhile to make a geared board just for fun, but I will stick with belt for sure. Thanks!

You should still try spur gears even if I posted stuff that's been beaten to death. I think there is only one user who used nylon gears. Now that you mention you would be using a 3D printer you have to use nylon for the gears or some other high strength plastic printing above 220 C.on the extruder.

I think I will, it would be an interesting project. Nylon is self lubricating, so that would help with that. Are you talking about this thread?

Not sure. I just know some users use plastic gears and it works. Long-term, that still has yet to be seen how many miles it can go.

My gears are made of Taulman Alloy 910 and they hold up very well. If you get a metal gear for the motor and print the big gear you should be fine. You could also print the motor gear but attaching it to the shaft is a bit of a pita in my opinion, but trying it would be great for sure.

i’ve been working on this for about 4 months now. it’s insanely complicated sealing the gears in on a street system.  MTB drives are much easier because of how much extra “wiggle room” they have (wider trucks, huge wheels, etc)

Chiming my .2c  nylon and plastic gears have to be overbuilt to hold power. Hardened steel on steel allows a smaller profile per Watt. The static rolling resistance of a small profile gear on gear is negligible (very efficient).  Setup allows motor to be moved closer to the axle (less fulcrum on mount). Allows multiple gear ratios and is the only setup that allows high kv 4 pole motors. High kv inrunners have an overall lower profile to Watt ratio and are more efficient than their outrunner counter parts. As to the wear and tear I would debate a properly set up and maintained hardened steel gear on gear setup, even in open air gear form, will live as long as a properly setup belt..  my .2c ![IMG_20170603_140319149_HDR|281x499](upload://aUCFLbk6VnabvXrFKC3ItY1AlBR.jpg)

I'm already working on printing Bridge Nylon pulleys for the motors as a temporary solution, and either super glue or jb welding it on the motor shafts as per the advice of another user. I will get back to you on that for sure, since I asked about it on your mountain board thread!

It's Polyacetal and you can get it as filament for 3D printer. It's the strongest there is but not possible to use on every printer.

I agree on that, although I have a pretty huge amount of wiggle room with 90mm wheels and 218mm TB trucks. Is that inventor? Any way you could release those files so I could edit it for my own needs?

that spur definetly wont fit on 90mm wheels. it is designed for 97mm or 107mm wheels. i will not be releasing those files unfortunately, it’s a product I plan on putting into production

it’s relatively simple to make if you know all the weird quirks and details of inventor

Very interesting, I like the look of that for sure! What is the ratio on that?  That is all pretty good info. I will be using dual sk3 5055 280kv motors, so it shouldn't need to handle as much torque as a single 63mm motor. Which is why I think it could be plausible on my setup. I agree steel would be better, but nylon seems like it could be a cool proof of concept!

Ah, fair enough. Good luck on that! I have already made a pretty basic spur gear setup, just haven't adapted it to my setup yet.

The pinion is hardened steel and will eat drill bits. On my 8mm motor shaft I machined it to 5mm and it works well.. on a 9t 72t setup keeping the can diameter size on the motor to 40mm is the trick. Been running 1250kv 4200w goolrc 5mm shaft. Will make 35mph on 8s with great torque at all speeds. At $40.00 it gets the job done..g

How does POM compare to nylon or polycarb? Both are incredibly strong and great for gears, not to mention much more tested and widely used

Ok my mistake here.... POM is available https://hobbyking.com/en_us/pom-3d-printer-filament-white.html?___store=en_us
but I was thinking about polycarbonate and it's in the video.

I think unless you got a real pro 3d printer POM isn't worth the effort. On other sites i've read recommendations of a 100++°C Bed and ridiculous warping properties even with enclosure, glue and all the stuff. Maybe try Polymaker PC Max if you don't want to go for anything Nylon based.

I've had pretty great success with nylon, I was just interested in PC because of the stiffness and impact resistance. Honestly nylon seems to be a better choice for gears in most instances because I can't shatter, and it's self lubricating. Maybe a PC-Nylon alloy of some sort, although I think that's what alloy 910 is

What’s bugs me most about the gears drive we see here is that apparently no one did the math to calculate the gear pitch and width, I bet we can make much more compact (narrower) drive train with all metal gears and maybe metal/polymer . I don’t know if there is bibliography for nylon gears readily available 

But for steel is basically following a cake recipe for a first prototype, if one day I manage to buy a mountain board I will do that and see what comes out

I highly recommend you try to make a case that fully seals the gears before doing anything. i’ve got a mount and 2 spurs in my hands, but that’s the easiest part 😉
