Hey guys quick question. I am about to buy the raptor 1's deck...I already have a space cell 3 but its the one that came with the enclosure. Is it a possibility that i can just take it off the enclosure and put it on the raptors deck?

Yes you can take the battery out of the enclosure. You may have to desolder the charge port and switch tho.

That's totally up to your personal preference. I personally like www.funboxskate.com 

You just want to make sure the deck does not have much flex to it.
