Cool stuff!
One comment on the XT-90S, you're supposed to have the female on the battery and the male as the loop.

I must be confused, I thought I did :slight_smile: .  I am using the piece with the built in resistor as the loop key, the other is in the panel mount.

The piece with the resistor is meant to go in the board. The reason is that it's fairly easy to short the two male bullet connectors vs the female side. Same reason as that side should go on your batteries.

I like the phase wire guide. 

You talk about taping over it, but what is wrong with turning the phase wire guide upside down and that way the phase wires will be in between the board and the bottom of the guide, no need for taping.

How thick is the phase wire guide? gotta be slightly below 1 cm.

I'm aware that would mean you will need to unscrew just to take the wires out, but that should not happen too often.

That's just to keep the phase wires in place while you mount he guide.  The final result should look like this...

I've heard that, but I've always done it like this and never had any issue at all.  I'll try it the other way on my next build, see if I like it.  Doesn't the XT90 female piece get broken pretty easy outside of the board?

This is a pulley Im working for MBS 7in Knobby Wheels, they are $20 each so would be a great way for people to try pnumatics.

I'll post the model when I've tested.  Im starting with a 36 tooth gear, but I'll be testing with a 60 tooth as well.

The same way the flywheel pulleys mount.  There's the inside object which holds the hear and the outside which is the retainer.  You will use m5 bolts to secure it all together. 

The questions is the  placement of the air stem. To have room to squeeze it in I essentially had to make the retainer hollow under it and  rely on a spacer to carry the load. I don't remember the exact spacer measurement but I'm using some I have easy access too so it'll be simple to test. 

I'm hoping the 36t gear provides more bottom end torque than the 60t so I can reliable test torsion strength but I may have to go straight to a 60t to get any speed. Not sure yet how to calculate the speed vs. strength of a 3d printed object. 

But once I get the model finalized I'm gonna look for a method having them milled out of aluminum.  I'm also looking for a way to mount motors on the MBS ABS trucks, not the ABS 12.  The ABS are pretty inexpensive and look solid, although I haven't ridden them yet.

I've made a simple 18650 four cell holder for battery packs. It's ideal for making/connecting 4p packs together thus should help keeping things together along the rides. I've printed it in flexible filament so that it fits the cells snugly and without damaging them.

If there's interest in 3p version, I can make and upload it too.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2526936

Now available in 1P,2P, 3P, 4P, 5P and 10P.
I've made my two 5S4P packs with them, spot welded it together, added some super tape across the cells and pushed it into a plastic battery shrink. Feels sturdy and solid.

Been riding these mounts for some time and they're reliable enough for me to publish them.
Big thanks to @solidgeek which was my inspiration in 3D printed mounts. I've really liked the idea of "double" mount but the new design was needed for 265mm belts (his was for 295mm).  

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2578901

Lot's of time and "gold" went into different design iterations, printing materials, testing and fixing. When printed with appropriate material these can take some real world abuse for sure. 

I'll share my enclosure designs in the near future too; those will cover a complete 18650 10S4P modular enclosure with electronics compartment which can easily take two focboxes. 
I may be one of the few who rides dual drive board with so  many 3D printed parts - motor mounts, risers, battery cell holders, battery enclosure (enhanced with glass fiber) and VESC enclosure. :smile:

Here are some 12v head and tail lights I created to fit caliber trucks (they may fit others).The headlights are designed to hold two 20mm oval lenses over the LEDs to create a nice spread on the ground that keeps the light out of the eyes of passersby. Both mounts house custom PCBs that are linked on each page.

If you have any of the TorqueBoards (DIYElectricSkateboard) enclosures, there are pre-made holes that you might not want/need. I've designed these parts that you can print and use to cover the holes. Just use some acetone or epoxy and clamp them on good until dry. And you'll have bit more water-resistant board :)

I'm hoping to find someone who could sell me one of @mmaner 's designs (the Switch plate, in black, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2323619/apps/print/#apps ) I'm in Oregon, USA.

I'll print it for you, I can do it this weekend.  No charge, just pay shipping which will be about $3.  PM me your address and I'll get you my paypal info.

I have a couple of new ones going up today...

Think I missed this thread before but adding my 3d printable skate parts here too.  The thingiverse files are exports of the parts from onshape.  All the models on onshape should be editable by anyone (I don't pay for the private service so everything is free to the public).  The onshape models are always more up to date since I only occasionally export STLs to update thingiverse.  Recently I modified the battery box to give it some more strength on the parts where batteries move in and out of it (added chamfer, before that change first one broke after about 6 months of use).

So i just found out my local library has a 3d printer that's free to use. (Just material cost)
 I was hoping to make a top mount volt display/ power button/ charging port for my board.
 Was hoping someone could tell me if their equipment is suitable for my needs.

Print Surface: Heated borosilicate glass bed covered with PEI print surface. Separate bed preparation is recommended when printing with flexible filaments, which can be found on the Flexystruder and FlexyDually Tool Head pages respectively.

Print Area: 290mm x 275mm x 250mm (11.4in x 10.8in x 9.8in)

Print Volume: 199375 cm3 (1206 in3) of usable space

Top Print Speed: 200mm/sec (7.9in/sec)

Layer Thickness with 0.35mm nozzle: 0.075mm to 0.35mm (0.003in - 0.0138in)

Layer Thickness with 0.5mm nozzle: 0.075mm to 0.5mm (0.003in - 0.0196in)

Capable Materials: ABS, PLA, HIPS, PVA, wood filled filaments, Polyester (Tritan), PETT, bronze and copper filled filaments, Polycarbonate, Nylon, PETG, conductive PLA and ABS, UV luminescent filaments, PCTPE, PC-ABS, Alloy 910, and more every day.

Discouraged Materials: 3D printing with carbon fiber filaments is not recommended at this time because carbon fiber filaments can degrade both the nozzle and hot end of the LulzBot TAZ 5 Tool Head.

Usable Filament Sizes: standard 3mm (0.1in)

Multi-Software Compatible: Freedom to use any number of 3D printing software programs, Cura LulzBot Edition ships standard! Other compatible Free Software options include OctoPrint, BotQueue, Slic3r, Printrun, MatterControl, and many more.
 If not would anyone be able to make me one at a fair price? Thanks in advance

I wonder what the limit is on print time since things for esk8 tend to be somewhat big and therefore have long print times.  If you're just doing custom hole covers it will be relatively fast, but would check if they have time limits and if they have someone around who monitors the prints or if you'll need to stick around while the job is running.  Lulzbot are nice printers and good company constantly develops hardware in the open.

Gotcha that's a decent amount of time but even small stuff takes an hour or two, for an enclosure can be 10hrs+ but the slicer software you run the model through before printing can give you a rough idea of time and you can adjust infill amount to reduce time (sacrificing some strength and accuracy in the part)

Thats an awesome idea! You'd be hard pressed to find a printer out of the box that will be able to print that big. Most people get around this by printing in a few segments and then gluing the parts together.


If you plan on actually mounting anything to the enclosure, you probably would want to reinforce the enclosure anyways. If you are printing with PLA, you would have to use a very high infil percentage to get close to the strength you would want. Also PLA will start getting flexible and warp at higher temps. You would need to print in ABS or PETG for this to work.

First thoughts: print it in segments, put it together, then use it as a mold and do some fiberglass or CF over/under the mold as the actual "structure" to build with.

I agree about the hands, those look like they will just snap off over your first bump!!

I've designed a hub adaptor to utilise the Versapulleys with Trampa Superstar hubs. It uses captive M4 nuts so you can bolt it straight onto the hub and the pulley from the outside.
It needs a slight tweak for spacing on the Superstar side, but the pulley side fits perfectly.

It has to do with the precision of your printer. 1st it seems like you are over-extruding plastic, which fuck with all of your dimensions. So fix this first by trail and error on a test cube for example. If you still have precision promblems after fine tuning your printer and tightening belts, nuts and bolts, try printing with a smaller nozzle, like 0.2mm, instead of the 0.4mm standard.

Have you printed a Benchy yet? Its  a little boat that is a stress/calibration print that will help you narrow down the issues and things you need to fix with your printer, I'd recommend starting there.

Check this page out: https://3dprinterwiki.info/wiki/wanhao-duplicator-i3/

I basically kept printing the benchy and referring to that page for modifications until my benchy came out perfect.

Mods I did to the I3:
Z braces
Upgraded Carriage
Glass bed
Better extruder fan unit
Flexion extruder (so I can print TPU)
Z alignment/blueprinting
Bed thumbscrews

There are alot more that I've done but those really got my printer dialed in!

I went to walmart, bought an 8x10 picture frame, removed the glass and used that. It was $1.35 I think! Make sure to keep it clean and throw a quick layer of Aquanet hairspray on it.

I secured it to the bed with binder clips for a bit but then found these thermal pads on amazon and I find that the heat is dispersed alot more efficiently now. (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074K4CKG1/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I made sort of a checkerboard pattern with them and it works perfectly.

Also built an enclosure around it for printing ABS and PETG (they like to feel the heat around them!) and it ended up stabilizing my PLA prints a bit more. I used end tables from Walmart and the Ikea LACK table kit on thingiverse. Closed all the sides with plexiglass and velcro so I can access any side when needed.![IMG_4857|375x500](upload://ahmbm5NyNKIQrYHMWOoj0XGTjwB.jpg)

I feel like I had a really good idea for a 3D printed part. I'm hoping someone can execute it.
So if you own the tsg pass you know there's washers that hold your visor on.
What if we reprinted this part with a way to snap a generic size powerfull flashlight to the side?

If you put the probes in the circle you should be safely over the 8mm heads on 30Q. The underside has a 10mm notch to try to hold the strip in place. Added little cutouts help position the nickel.

If the ellipse is consistent across prints and not totally random, that just means you need to calibrate your X/Y/Z axes. You need to calibrate your printers axes anyways if you want any kind of dimensional accuracy from your prints to begin with. Start with a calibration cube- Google how to calculate the new values, you probably want to get a good set of calipers if you don't have them already.

Hey there!
While riding and repairing my fuckups in my first build I realized how much I hate  bullet connectors. Fiddeling around to get them apart while they come loose on their own from vibration, keeping them in order when connecting motor and controller drove me close to several edges.

Depending on your battery length and cell layout.... The 3 pieced one measures 40cm overall, against 60cm for the 5 piece one.

Today I have made provision for a Volt LCD (a standard one readily available online), Momentary ON/OFF switch (standard diameter) and Charging Point (using one I had in my toolbox so assume it's a standard size!).

Location recess for 2x FOCBOX, and finally Phase Wire Routing Holes.

I've also previously designed a Cable Riser, which you can view on my thingyverse profile, and I will do an END version that joins into this for a sleak OEM look.

Anyone here printing, or have experience with printing with 0.8mm or (gasp!) 1.2mm nozzles?

I'm going to print my battery enclosure again and printed my last one with a 0.4mm nozzle. I remember someone saying that you should print the enclosure vertically since the "grain" is important and it would have more strength.

I have only just got my Volcano hot-end going and both of the larger nozzles produce hella-strong parts... I'm tempted to print my enclosure "face down". 

Face-down would be a benefit cause I understand support material is hard to remove with the larger nozzles and I have some over-hanging parts.

(OMG love the 1.2mm nozzle; it's comically large though)

Haven't used bigger nozzles myself yet using the new printer to upgrade my old one for larger print volume so I'm planning to try some bigger nozzles there too.  Regarding overhangs if you can adjust the model to have a draft/chamfer that goes up at 45degree angle or higher then the printer should be able to make that angle happen without adding support underneath but sometimes you're better off slicing the model in half and printing the two pieces then binding together (with abs using abs slurry/glue works super well, basically a chemical bond plastic to plastic to plastic).

The biggest nozzle I've tried on my Volcano was 1.0 mm. With a good filament the prints come out ridiculously strong, even one layer width is tough as f**k. I haven't tried supports with this 1.0 mm but I did try using a brim and it was a major pain to remove :smiley:

I found that with the enclosure I was printing there was only about 5 mins difference in printing time between the 0.8mm and 1.2mm (~3 hours). Figured it was because the printing speeds were faster on the 0.8mm (35mm/s compared to 25mm/s). 0.8mm would be a nicer/smoother surface.

I just have a cheap cartesian printer (Tevo Tarantula) but now heavily modified. 

I had issues with cooling too, even with small parts and a 0.8 nozzle. I have dual blowers which are good for big parts. Lots of pics of my 0.8mm nozzle parts here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/soldered-bullet-connectors-on-to-vesc-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/78795/8

I think if you print about 25mm/s with 1.2mm nozzles then you might be ok. 35mm/s with 0.8mm nozzle is good resolution/quality.

The 25mm/s was recommended with the Volcano. I haven't played as much with the 1.2 as I have with the 0.8mm (35mm/s). I did go up to about 60mm/s with the 0.8mm, but the quality dropped a bit. 

Also I was having issues with printing small parts with the 0.8mm and thought it was the speed. It wasn't :).

So much learning to do. 0.8mm is good enough for me/the enclosures.

Has anyone here tried annealing their prints? From tests I've seen, it can increase strength significantly. The downside is that parts tend to shrink (X/Y) and grow in the Z dimension.

I think it also tends to make PLA prints slightly more temperature resistant. This sounds like something that would pair well with CF PLA.

I might just do that actually. I just realized I don't want to make my enclosure any bigger than 40 mm thick (35 mm would be ideal) so if it's a lot bigger than the meter itself it wouldn't fit anyway any making it any smaller would defeat the purpose of having it. 

Really appreciate the offer though.

This is my Pocket Voltmeter with Pass-Through port.  

![voltmeter-pic|690x292](upload://onXJIRoNKEY77fwNO7vs0kblDje.jpeg) 

Here's the models...
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3418423

I have an Esk8 that I didn't want to permanently mount a voltmeter in because space was tight and I didn't want to cut on the CF enclosure more than necessary. So I came up with a Pocket Voltmeter with Pass-Through charging port.

This allows you to plug into the charge port on your Esk8 (or whatever) and see the voltage plus you can then plug your charger into the pass-through port to monitor charging.

This is what you need as far as parts...

**5.5 x2.1mm DC Power Socket**
https://www.ebay.com/itm/111889160001?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT

**5.5*2.1mm Male DC Pigtail**

**Voltmeter**
https://www.ebay.com/itm/LCD-12V-24V-36V-48V-Lead-Acid-Battery-Status-Voltage-Voltmeter-Monitor-Meter-Car/263889296209?hash=item3d71071b51:m:mBNt8R85So2EgKuA6m_LQ4Q:rk:1:pf:0

You solder the leads to the voltmeter to 2 wires, 1 side goes to the socket (pass-through cahrger port) and the other side goes to the pigtail (connects to the charge port of your Esk8). I forgot to takes pics of the internal wiring, but I'll do that on the next one I build and post those pics.

The model is slotted for M2 screws, but being such small holes and with the shrinkage inherent with 3D printed models, I had to drill them out. I ended up using epoxy to fix the socket and pigtail in place, plus some on the inside walls to keep the 2 pieces locked together. I used hot-glue to secure the voltmeter in the top of the case.

I may redesign this in the future to use m3 screws a cap for the voltmeter. This would make easy to disassemble, but will also make it significantly larger. Let me know if your interested I'll get it done.

Yes, that's the main thing I use it for.  I have a build that it was going to be difficult to get a volt meter installed, so I came up with this.

I forgot to take any, but its really simple.  Connect the POS of the charge port to the POS of the Pigtail, with the Voltmeter POS in the middle, same with the negative.

Here are my enclosure and motor mount designs that I recently uploaded to thingiverse.  https://www.thingiverse.com/GarrettL/designs

ESC enclosure holds two 4.12 vesc's and the battery compartment holds two 4s packs plus bms and vesc switch.  My new motor mount design is holding up nicely so far even with the optional idler bearing installed.

Hmmm you got me thinking about printing my own motor mount now.

Wonder how it would go with being printed in PETG and with a 0.8 nozzle. The 0.8mm nozzle wouldn't allow the fine angle of adjustability though, I would have to have some sort of grub-screw type arrangement.

You might be able to get away with PETG with that tip.  As a quick test, print the bushing and see how that turns out.  Print at 100% and probably skip the idler bearing with a PETG motor mount.

Nope pretty easy to model though unfortunately I don't have any on hand to test size with if you can send measurements with digital calipers of actual cells can throw together a quick model to hold them together.

I made one here https://cad.onshape.com/documents/42f0c0e8ee72493a76cdc678/w/b4c5fbf0dd3aae90fffea063/e/e1b02095eeefd48c1c437f63 but not sure if there's other parts needed to hold things in place or nice to haves, if so let me know I can add them in (also make a drawing so you can 2D print that to test size) I just use 21mm diameter as is and added a 1mm fillet and 1mm space between each cell.

STL here if that looks like it will work going to add 3mm holes for all 4 corners then could use long 3mm screws to keep a few aligned/stacked, but open to other suggestions https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XF87lPK6Bs577lXAbhnl9-4pqegfa13-/view?usp=sharing . Just been on a bit of a modeling bend lately :)

How far apart they are is a consideration as well, typically we are short on space to tend to have each cell in a parallel pack touch the neighbor, a lot of the jigs(18650) I have seen are a 2-piece for that reason & compress the cells along the line.

I designed/modified your motor mount bushing to for a Surf Rodz TKP HEX hanger, a bit on the tight side but that might be caused by imperfections or slight shrinkage. 

A bit sanding (heating the hanger to 150°C and smoothing the prints inside might also be an option) or maybe a slight horizontal scale adjustment by 0,5-1% might do the trick![3DP%20bushing%20on%20TKP%20HEX|375x500](upload://tIEBdozzwH2u4YseEEwb7e9DLOo.jpeg) ![3DP%20TKP%20HEX%20mount%20bushing%20|375x500](upload://4VS1jcP0fE2MjlyK7fNm8x3sY5.jpeg) ![Bottom%203DP%20mount%20bushing%20TKP%20HEX|375x500](upload://eaaSy9QI7J3I6IhS0htehy0pV7F.jpeg) .

The little setscrew that the Surf Rodz use doesn't work with this mount because it's so wide but it's better to use locktide on the axel anyway, so no big deal.

@GarrettL excuse me but I found some problems on the 63xx 3dprintable mount.

 
I finally managed it to find the time to print one side of the mount, in PC-ABS (very solid, couldn't flex it at all by hand, I printed it in 0.4 mm layers 60% infill but 6 mm walls so nearly solid). 

But I quickly found out .
![63xx%20motor%20exept%20SK3%20doesnt%20fit|375x500](upload://3Nvlje2puO1rUApvyyC9ogZe4t7.jpeg) 
. that the SK3 you use has a non standard can diameter and so does your model.

At first I was really confused and thought crazy how tight you designed this and how much my print shrinks but I checked the .STL by importing it into fusion->converting into brep and measuring the model.

![STL%20mount%20measure|690x387](upload://7U9yi6mZkfT0pfcegmf671bsgQg.png) only 60 mm, than I checked hobbykings dimensions for the SK3s and .. yep only 59 mm so these may work but most 63xx motors won't! Like mine which is basicly an APS motor (same factory). Same story for any 63xx maytech motor and it's rebrands. Both need more or less 63 mm clearance as the **63**xx implies.
![APS%20-%20maytech%2063xx|690x221](upload://5VbYvnhFHVxO9BjsZZxIG1wOiZ9.png) 


A quick and dirty "fix" like this would work![quick%20and%20dirty%2063xx%20fix|690x391](upload://4jj84DA0AqlvOSvGshIbPRQwdw2.png) 
but I would appreciate an updated version which accommodates for 63 mm motor cans (you know with the same wall thickness of 3.5 mm as before). I also wondered why the elongated screw holes when you can't slide the motor in the mount to adjust the belt tention :thinking:
```

That's interesting.  I designed the mount for the SK3 motor and when used in conjunction, it has enough movement in the screw slots to adjust belt tension.  I don't have a maytech motor handy, but I can rev the design using the specs you attached.  Might take me a few days to get it posted. 
Thanks for the input!

On the negative side, it doesnt matter. On the positive side, as long as you install correctly: braid, shield, 18650 paper ring and the tighten it down. There's should be no loose copper wire sticking out. Alternatively you can solder the ends shut, so no fray.

I'm working on something similar for flipsky 6.6dual. If I had a unity or a close enough 3d model of one I could model something pretty quickly.

Getting your fingers around the key will be tricky. I designed/printed a "case" for my key that has a loop that came out at a 45 degree angle specifically for that reason (i.e. you can slide the key in flush).

Like the idea of having it in the riser, though.

Not really. I'll be gluing the heatsink to the vesc shell with 5200 marine grade sealent (its waterproof and cures as a super tough rubber in a way). The bottom cover that attaches to the truck part will be made from tpu to suck up the vibrations as well while the top cover will be made from petg.

This is an earlier model, but as you can see it's a two piece construction.

I tried printing your enclosure but ended in failure.  The issue is the way they connect to each other. The print requires support material you have to remove around the tabs that connect. The sections didn't fit together well because of the support material left it rough. Either way I couldn't come up with a way to water proof it very well. I ended up getting a psychotiller enclosure and am mostly happy with it besides the way it attaches to the board. I like your design a lot I'm bummed I couldn't get it to work.

I have had no issues like that which you describe, but perhaps my support settings were different. Check out @M.Hboards recent build. He used the files with good results. My own test prints locked together nicely. It definitely isn't waterproof (it's a five piece part after all). But thanks for considering it all the same.

Hmm... I had been planning on mounting my VESC under the board next to the BMS, which had the side effect of making it impossible to mount the motors under the board as I wouldn't have room (I'm using a very short board). 

Didn't consider mounting the vesc on top. it does look pretty cool. Something to add to my considerations.

Anyone wanna design something stupid simple for me?  Sure others would use it too.

Looking for an extra thick tail bone/tail guard. 

Kinda like 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ISIYYHA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_sYh4CbVJ1B168

But maybe twice as thick? 

With how much higher our boards ride than traditional boards i feel the need for a thicker guard or a riser so it hits the ground a bit sooner.

@b264 do you use tail guards?  They seem like something you'd use.

If you mean the flat curve, the tailbones are flat and pull up to the deck with bolts.  That wouldn't work for such a thick one though.  :expressionless:

If you don't want to wait, and you have a TAP plastics near you, I've had good luck picking up scrap pieces of HDPE for cheap in 1/2" - 1" thickness. I have a chunk of 3/4" HDPE that's been sitting around for about 3 years that was going to be a tail guard for my old 80's Santa Cruz deck, (like your Skateshred deck), but I never finished it.

I want the rib bones mainly for picking up the board by the rail and having something for your fingers grip on to. Another idea that I haven't finished, but I have the tubing, is using some of this acrylic Square clear tubing for the rib bones and running some LED light strips inside. 
![Screenshot_20190518-153836_Firefox|677x500](upload://fQOh1XLPTZpDQ4l55mkEEY0Hf2d.jpeg) 

And I found it. My cutting tools suck, so maybe that's why I never finished it. A 1 sqft piece of scrap HDPE was about 10 bucks, and probably enough for 4 tail guards, so it could be done dirt cheap with the right tools, but 3d printing these seems way easier and more fun to customize though.

If there's enough interest for it, I may start a request thread for the service, as I have been doing a fair bit of 3D modelling and printing for a few of my friends lately, and it would be nice to get some eSkate items in my repertoire. 

I'm based in the UK, so probably not much use to those based in the US, but I could help out any other UK and EU based skaters with things. 

As I say, depends on how much interest there is in it.

I think of this thread as a place for posting final designs and not requests. Requests means there will be a lot of back and forth and people loose the ability of scrolling through 3D printables for esk8 uinterrupted and choosing what they like.

Makes sense! I won't bother uploading my battery/enclosure up on that thread, as what I'm using right now is very much a version 1.0. Have figured out a much better mounting rail design for the NESE modules now, but it also requires re-printing all 5 NESE's so I am planning to put that off until AFTER I actually get my board assembled and testing/working lol. Once I know all the components actually work properly, I can then tinker away. 

I'll keep an eye out on that thread too then :)

I like the idea of having it in the riser.  I would definitely take @mmaner advice and have it come out the back or front depending on if your motors are going to be by it.  And Do like @skelstar idea with the 45 degree ring for easy removal.  Depending on the deck if you are using a drop through I have seen a mount that uses the drop through hole as a way to kind of hide the loop key.

Heres a 36t wheel pulley i remixed for the TB110mm wheel.

Theres a 12mm belt and 15mm belt option. Havnt officially ridden with this revision yet because my motor let out a puff of smoke before the group ride, but should work perfect. Use a flanged bearing in the center, F608 bearings for 8mm axels and F6900 bearings for 10mm axels.

Just a little side note here. I've been making a lot of parts with PLA+ lately and they all hold up great. It prints at a slightly higher temp than regular pla and it acts more like PETG - able to bend a bit more and more dense feeling

Stainless steel is fine but hardened(black) steel nozzle wins unless you want to talk crazy with the ruby tipped nozzles

I was thinking of an idea for easily building enclosures, originally for a hummie deck but could work with other decks too.

The idea would be to make 2 types of 3d models which would serve as the perimeter and add "height" (e.g.: 20mm high) to the enclosure. They would be printed out of TPU and would fit like a puzzle. There would 2 main types a `corner` and a `straight` piece.

There can also be a variations, like a `straight` piece with a whole for a XT90, 2.1x5.5mm, power button, etc.

You would use the pieces to make the entire edge of the enclosure and then buy an acrylic sheet cut to match the TPU perimeter and drill the acrylic through the TPU and into the deck in a way that would secure everything together.

Intrigued. Being a software developer I look at everything and think about how to make it modular (also 3d-printing takes a lot of time).

My 3d-printed enclosure has walls 3.6mm thick. If I designed it so it would "slot" in to other pieces, making it like your design would mean that it would have to be significantly thicker.

Interesting though.
