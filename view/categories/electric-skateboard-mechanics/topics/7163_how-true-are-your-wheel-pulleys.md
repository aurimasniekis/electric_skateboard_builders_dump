Just wondering how true do they really have to be to the wheel? I can see it off center before I hook the belt in. It doesn't wobble side to side since it's flush but it is definitely off center that every little distance affects the belt tension since it gets closers and farther per rotation. Anyone have a way to get it near perfect? I'm using an old enertion 36T aluminum pulley. Thanks in advance guys!

Not sure about your questions BUT I know this topic was discussed heavily before and the answer you need might just be a search away :)
