What‚Äôs up guys, I‚Äôve been searching and can‚Äôt seem to find a solid answer, so maybe you can help. 

When looking at my motors max wattage, say 3000 watts is what one motor can produce. By adding my second motor (as in dual setup), does this increase my max out put to 6000 watts or is it still just 3000 because the voltage isn‚Äôt increased?

Basically when telling someone about the potential power my board has, I would like to be able to say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs capable of xxxx number of watts.‚Äù 

@Hummie, @MoeStooge, @Sender, @pixelsilva, @hyperIon1, @Andy87, @mmaner maybe you guys can easily answer this?

Nearly 100% sure watts double

You would have 6000 with 2 motors

Also try not to start new threads use search bar (I have also started way to many . Not worth it)

Thanks for answering bro, I‚Äôm under the same impression but wanted the solid answer.

I did use the search bar, here and all over google. Lol that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking.

The volts stay the same but the amps stay constant per motor and add up.  2 motors mean same volts and double amps, therefore double power

I‚Äôve been around here a while my friend, if you‚Äôre eluding to some of these guys arrogance, I get it. But I‚Äôm thick skinned, I can handle some keyboard heroism. That being said my dude, never stop someone from seeking knowledge, as the only stupid question is the one that goes unasked. ‚úåüèª

It's not that you can't post, it's that simple questions like this raise the thread count and make it hard to find good relevant or interesting information.  There is a noobs question thread under the general discussion category for questions like this

I support learning as much as the next guy but it sucks when you check the forum and it nothing but 5 post threads about simple shit

I'm glad you want to learn!  Keep asking questions (just not in new threads)

Noob question?? We aren‚Äôt all mechanical engineers. I did search this question in a variety of different ways both here and on google and couldn‚Äôt find a clear answer. In fact I‚Äôm not a noob, I‚Äôve been building boards for 3 years now. I see this as a completely valid question, something I‚Äôve always wondered and as I have no official education, I do my best to learn what I can.

You guys are being a bit over the top.... I personally think this is a good question and deserves a thread on its own.

But my response to this question is that the power output of your board is equal to the settings you input to your esc, if the power is not limited to the battery.

My 2 cents: We can all easily get lost in the amount of information on this forum let alone the internet. I don't believe in knob questions and we all have our opinions on certain things. One thing to keep in mind, 'a rating' is not what the motor will or should deliver at any prolonged amount of time. Usually, the rating reveals the point of failure for some things. Now a MAX in or out is just that the maximum that can go in or out at any prolonged period of time and there is usually a limit on that as well 1 min, 2 or more. 

Other factors are your controllers? what do they handle? and of course your battery? Everything works together if your battery can't push the power to max out two 3000w motors, or your ESCs are only rated 30a and bottleneck the system. 

Limits, maximums, and minimums are just that. There are no rules saying you have to fallow them and honestly we push the limits of this stuff as is. 

Always ask first, read up and watch videos, do your homework and push the limits........

@hyperIon1 and @ARetardedPillow thank you guys for the awesome answers. Hypothetically though if my battery could push my motors to their max wattage, and each motor is 3000 watts, would that indeed be 6000 total watts?

Partially yes, if your esc can push that many watts. But you can also push it more than 3000watts if your esc and battery can handle it.

How could you possibly ask me a question without searching it up you imbecile... I am going to report you to every member of the community and all the mods and admins and our lord and savior Jason to get you muted for a year. Do not ever ask a question ever on this forum again or else I will personally come after you and haunt you with "drv no work please fix" threads with people asking to see settings and then the issue is the guy can't solder. 

tdlr: tdlr means Too Long Didn't Read and use search

It is annoying though when there's 5 threads on the same subject and all of them are half full of s*** posts and only two of them have the information I'm looking for......
Duplicate threads are a burden.
But at the same time , some of the information in some of these threads is way out of date. Or completely subjective and opinion-based

As for the title then yes if you put 2 3000 watt motors on your board you will indeed have the potential of 6000 watts.  (The other boys have covered the rest pretty extensively)
As for if you get that,  well thats when it gets subjective because no 2 manufacturers test their kit the same and some inflate the power output ratings outrageously.
What I've found is if you have 2 motors with different ratings from the same manufacturer the only thing that is certain is that the higher rated one will indeed be of a higher rating but across manufacturers then all bets are off.  Sorry for the de rail.  Old mate there has been a plague of threads, this one is actually factual and informative.
