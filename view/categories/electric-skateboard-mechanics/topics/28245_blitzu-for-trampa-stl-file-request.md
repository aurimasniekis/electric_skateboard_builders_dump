Hello guys, I'm looking for the STL file for Trampa Street Carver Deck for my Blitzu rear light, I know this base is pretty popular so I decided to ask here if anyone could share it.

I found this STL file on thingiverse but it has the gopro mount which would make it look bulkier and the loght would be pointing 45 degrees to the top, so I'm not sure if it'll look good.

Hey man! Thanks a lot.

I'm wondering what would be needed to position the light in this orientation, pointing backwards parallel from the ground and not pointing 45 degrees to the top.

can you measure the angle of the tail?  With that I can correct for it.  Also, if you can get me the measurements to the center of the screw holes from the end of the tail and both sides, plus the diameter of the screw holes, I can make it so you dont have to drill new holes.

```
The angle of the tail against the floor is roughly 30 degrees

The lenght between the center of the screws to the tail end is 16mm, 17mm should have 1mm of clearance

The screws are M5 so the diameter of the screw holes could be 6mm in order to fit better

Just sent you a 3D of the deck. It has the M6 holes in for mounting the truck. As I can see, you use the M5 holes. So you need to consider that. Angle is 30Â°. If you stand on the board it gets a bit more.

Hi @mmaner, first I want to thank you to help us with yours .stl files.

This is exactly what I was looking for.

Can you send me this .stl file ?  

Is it possible to rotate the entry for the Blitzu light, in this model once we put the light is not possible to remove it to charge.

I haven't done it yet, was covered up at work.  Ill do my best to get it done tomorrow.  I could design the mount to use a pivot joint, but it wouldn't be as strong.   I would suggest just doing it on a 30deg tilt.
```

There would be no need to make a pivot mechanism, at 30 degrees it would work perfect.

I thought this image was from the .stf file already done! I mean that I am going to use in my regular board, i don't need this modifications for Trampa's board.

Thanks @mmaner

That Stl file would make the light slide from the bottom to the top, I'm not sure if that would be a good idea, the light could slide out with vibrations

Yes Mike, but I wonder why is the blitzu holder sliding from the bottom instead that from the top? Wouldn't it slide down and fall due vibrations?

On the original design the deck holds it in place, with this design (the 30deg drop) I will need to figure something else out.  Probably a plug or something.

@h0ttz Is this what you are looking for?  I would suggest using the V3 mount, its a lot stronger and there's a velcro slot to strap your remote to it if you wanna.  Yell if you need anything else.

@Eboosted Assuming the truck mount slots are 41mm from center to center this is what I cam up with.  I think it will need some reinforcement on the back of the blitzu slot, like the V3 mount above maybe.  If you have any ideas on something other than the velcro slot, let me know.  If this is what you want I'll upload the STL.

Here ya go, I made a couple of changes (added .5 filet on outside edges, decrease filets on inside edges from 3mm to 2mm and added reinforcement).

You will need 2mmx8mm pan head sheet metal screws, or something similar to fasten the plug on the bottom of the mount.

Hi, you have to consider two more facts: 

- it should also fit the Holy Pro deck.
http://www.trampaboards.com/35-holypro-mountainboard-drilled-sanded-gripped-with-bolt-kit--1417ply--p-11144.html
And the carver deck:
http://www.trampaboards.com/street-carver-blank-decks-c-311.html

The truck can be mounted using either:
- 4 x M5 non Holy Pro, narrow, skate tuck pattern
- 2xM6  + 2xM5 for Holy Pro

We have a drill patern online. Just browse to the trucks, desktop website.

Alan's board uses the 4x M5 holes, but the 3D I sent him show the M6 holes. If it fits both hole options and bit more deck length is assumed, it will also fit the Holy Pro.

5 minutes later before going outside:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/XUl2BzV.jpg[/img]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/lLzNBG1.jpg[/img]

I wanna cry.

We need to make a new base with conical seats in order to be fitted in the conical holes of the trampa deck, I mean these holes:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/IuCipK1.jpg[/img]

When you adjust the bolts the base deforms and will eventuattly break.

On the other hand, the distance between holes was larger than the trampa deck, so instead of being 41mm it was 42.5mm that might have contributed to the cracking.

[img]http://i.imgur.com/QL4DI2d.jpg[/img]

One more thing, the Blitzu lamp should be slided from the top not from the bottom, it will fall as soon as the road transfer the vibrations to the base

I can adjust the mounting holes, I'll do it tomorrow and send you the revision.  

In the files there is a plug for the bottom, you use 2 sheet metal screws to install the plug which holds the blitzu in place.

yup, changing orientation should help. using less infill (20-30%) should make the part more flexible as well

@mmaner I really didn't want to bother you more brother, but I tried to mod it myself without success.

I'd like to do these modifications:

1. Turn the squared holder 180 degrees in order to fit the light from the top rather than from the bottom
[img]http://i.imgur.com/RIOs1zA.jpg[/img]

2. Lower the holder to be placed below the level of the deck, this way it would be less prone to casual kicks and would look better
