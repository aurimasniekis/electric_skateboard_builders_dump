like so often, okp was pioneering with motor mount adapters for the complicated cast ronin trucks, whose truck profile changes in a nontrivial way along the way from axle the kingpin!

for the interested readers, check this: http://www.e-sk8.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=385&hilit=ronin

okp was nice enough to send me a few of his adapters, but they were made for 9mm belts - for 15mm belts you need the adapters even further in towards the kingpin, which is a completely different ronin truck geometry already and which is also problematic, since the max diameter for the adapter is 30mm with the alien power system mount and basically the truck at its widest part is 30mm very quickly.

I liked the way okp did it, but it felt a little messy to me, or well, I felt like I could make this a little simpler.

I ordered 30mm aluminum and stainless steel pipes with a very thin wall (1mm for aluminium, 1.5mm for stainless steel) and cut them in very short pieces - long enough to allow quite free positioning of the motor mount, but short enough that it wont interfere with the wheels. then sanded the cuts and in the case of the aluminium, I actually polished the pipes for looks - left 2 are stainless steel, right 2 are polished aluminum:

I brought the pipe all the way to the kingpin and decided to go for the aluminium, since the thinner wall allowed the pipe to go juust that little bit further that I needed for the 15mm belt:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_2.jpg

I added the same pipe on the other side for symmetry and taped both of them firmly to an aluminium angle leftover from my very first enclosures. that way the adapters will be perfectly straight!

another pic to show the 2 pipes to make it clearer, why both of them simply have to be perfectly aligned and straight
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_4.jpg

used plastilin to seal the kingpin side (its much easier to add resin from the wheel side, because the opening is much larger):
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_5.jpg

I then used the slow curing epoxy resin I still had from my laminating adventures and added quite a bit aluminium powder to increase the heat conductance of the resin. id like to use the truck for heat dissipation as well, since the APS mount is 100% aluminium unlike the enertion CFK->aluminium mount:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_6.jpg

and finally poured it into the pipe:

Im not sure if this will be awesome or not, but if it works out, its a fairly simple way to make custom truck mounts for just about ANY truck - should also work for torqueboard mounts, but they have another diameter ... so essentially all you have to do is order smaller diameter pipes.

anyway, Ill keep you updated - tomorrow Ill know more and I hope my APS mount will arrive soon - bruno sadly isnt the fastest - my stuff is waiting since monday for UPS pickup. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Looks like a great idea, I keep fingers crossed that it works out! 

Really don't have a clue about this resin stuff, but how well does this bond with the truck? did you cut the pipe open? like one little cut so that when you put the mount pressure is also put onto the resin block inside the tube to be pressed onto the truck?

hehe, maybe next time! aluminum powder isnt uncommon for resin applications by the way - the heat conductance thing is just some icing on the cake -> http://shop1.r-g.de/en/art/210160

_It [aluminium powder] enhances the impact and compressive strength of moulding compounds, and its low resin content helps to reduce shrinkage._

think it will be a very very strong bond. thats why I wont cut it open - basically the pipe with the resin will become part of the truck. its the only downside compared to OKPs version I guess ... it will forever be an APS mount cronin ... but thats ok with me!

[/quote]

slow curing epoxy resin for lamination of cfk/gfk - dont think its anything special and there are better resins for this kind of casting/potting.

woke up early and had to take a peek even though the resin isnt fully cured yet - but its already hard to the touch - probably cured at elevated temperatures from the exothermic heat of the large resin volume confined in that space - so it might actually be cured when I think about it. :stuck_out_tongue: 

results look very promising! this is the side where I poured in the resin - it shrank a little as expected, but still looks nice with the aluminium inside. few stains of resin on the pipe which Ill sand and polish off I guess:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_9.jpg

same side, but the "thick" resin part towards the board: 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_10.jpg

kingpin side - you can see why you need the thinnest possible pipewalls for this: the pipe touches 3 of the 4 truck edges and really cant get in any further - so I would say for 15mm belt on cronins, there is only one possible motor mount right now: APS due to 30mm inner truck mount adapter diameter.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_11.jpg

and the 3 touching points from another perspective:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_12.jpg

now I need the motor mount to check how straight this will turn out and if it was actually stuck in far enough so that 15mm belts work! if it doesnt, there is no way around filing down the truck a little.

think I was a little lucky: its a perfect fit for 15mm belt and also really well aligned (tested with torqueboard v2 which got  28.xmm diameter)!

APS order arrived - was a pretty disappointing experience, really sloppy wrapping, obviously used motor mount, scraping sounds on both motors, missing screws, screws that were meant for the 9mm set and do not fit the 15mm one, sharp edged wheel pulley teeth that will slice up my belt ... but no problem because the belt isnt fitting my ordered 15/36 anyway - looks like its made for 15/32. Im not super happy and wrote bruno a mail about it - lets see how he responds. think he is getting too many orders. I might have looked beyond a few things, but considering his 15mm motor mount set is by MILES the most expensive one, I simply expect more. torqueboard and enertion mounts always arrived in absolutely flawless quality.

/rant off

anyway, I used the mount, despite scratches, motor-, pulley-, screw- and road marks because I didnt feel like waiting another 4 weeks for bruno to post another mail.
 
conclusion: it worked great. after swallowing my disappointment of the APS order, I was fairly happy, because the mount fits 100%, extends the motor far enough to the center of the board so that it does not touch the weird croning pin holder part of the base plate - but at the same time its far enough away from the carbon enclosure.

http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_17.jpg

here you can see that the motor is out far enough to get past the croning base plate pin holder. I even had 5mm room on the mount, so I couldve gone further.

you guys really got to try ronins if you havent yet :heart_eyes:

paris, caliber, bear, indies - I tried them all on different boards and they are all very similar - you pimp them with some urethane pivots, add some riptide/otang goodies, maybe a precision cupped washer and theyll feel alright, but these cronins are just OMG. 

I got really expensive dont trip poppies with pivot and kingpin spherical bearings on my pump board - they are super precise and sensitive, but nearly a little too sensitive and the damping isnt so nice due to the spherical bearings instead of urethane pivots.

the cronins are just right in between and it feels like the perfect mix. that cronin spike that holds the truck is rubber dampened and makes for a superplush ride, while, at the same time, it really adds incredibly precision and sensitivity to the truck ... but in a super smooth way, not that crisp spherical bearing precision truck sensitivity. and with the tall barrels, the lean feels super juicy ... my vanguard really got pushed to the next level with that mod.

Maybe a possibility to add motors on SKOA Stream7 trucks. I like them even more than my ronins for higher speeds, but they are really tricky to mount something.

dont really know any other precision trucks except for the DT poppies - those skoa look very light but fairly standard otherwise ... what makes them special? just measure the trucks - if the thickness in the mount area is not larger than 28mm, then this is a way to go for sure!

imo that ronin support pin is a genius concept that really set them apart in feel from any other truck --- and for a price thats pretty much in the same league as caliber & co. its just incredible :smiley_cat:

Do you think the epoxy will hold up? Do you think something like jb weld is okay or should I look at something stronger?

Ronin trucks are great it's hard to explain like you can run the softest bushing and it's still very stable at high speeds and at the same time very turny at slow speeds and after testing calibers and Ronins back to back the Ronins are noticeably more shock absorbent they're great

Very nice work!  I am strongly considering this for my next build.  I will  most likely mill out an Enertion mount though.  Would there be enough room for a dual 15mm setup?  Looks very tight.

@Chris1 you wouldn't be able to fit dual 15mm setup on a single truck as the hanger is only 177mm even 9mm belts is a very tight fit. Only diagonal would work

@Titoxd10001Thankyou, thats what I thought.  I have an industrial epoxy that I plan on using.  Its a stronger version of JB Weld, I once fixed a blown out plug on a Ford motor with it.  Held for over 100,000 miles.  I will get you the name tomorrow.

Okay thanks @Chris1 let me know about that epoxy

I didn't want to say anything before I tried but I'm going to add a longer axle on my Ronin's the old ones hammer right out I don't see why a longer axles and some spacers wouldn't allow dual 15mm that's what I had planned

enertion mount doesnt work, or maybe it does, but only with very slim motors like a dual 50mm. you need a motormount that offers a long truck to motor axle distance. otherwise the rotor collides with the supportpin-baseplate part of the truck.

see here how close it is and i just ordered a 300mm belt:

today I managed to bring the motor a little bit closer to the truck, so that I can actually use a **280mm belt** and the 2 outer mount attachment screws instead of the 2 neighboring ones! the belt size will probably give you an idea if your mount works for ronins or if it doesnt (running 15/36T). I dont think you can really go any closer unless you mount the motor towards the rear or you bring it even further towards the road!


2 outer screws on the motor mount plate instead of directly neighboring ones like before. I got about 2-3mm between motor and support pin base plate:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_21.jpg

here you can see that I could probably go closer if I just brought the motor closer to the road. right now, with full lean angle without flexing board, the motor has about 5mm before touching the board ...
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/ronin_mount_adapter_22.jpg

... which you can see in this picture. also, the motor only has only about 1mm from the support pin at full lean. :sweat_smile:

Could you file down that corner of the truck a little bit, and polish the flat bare metal spot that it leaves? If it doesn't compromise the integrity of the truck of course. I'm curious to try those Ronins after seeing your close ups of the design.

I didn't see the part about enertion motor mount. It won't work with these trucks because you need a lot of distance from the pulleys like white pony said. I have a 285 belt for 15/36 that I plan to use to mount the motors toward the rear. And the mounts should be round to allow for adjustment Imo 

@Chris1 thanks for the heads up

got about 150km on the cronins now ... its very close to a miracle how they can be so incredibly sensitive, precise and smooth at low lean and so incredibly turny at high lean. at the same time they have really great damping and the amount of possible lean is crazy! these trucks transformed my low speed vanguard completely - I can now easily surf sidewalks and enter 90° sidewalk turns while I still highspeed carve smoother than ever! 

but it actually took a few kilometers for me to get adjusted to the ronins, cause initially my vanguard rear kept breaking loose on nearly every turn - I felt like a hero AND also scared at the same time, because I really wasnt convinced that I could just catch my rear that smoothly every time forever. :stuck_out_tongue:

on the calibers, I usually gave the last bit of each carving arc one extra push, so that I could hear the rubber rub hard on the pavement and nearly break loose. that worked on the calibers, because their lean was at the end, there wasnt any more "turn" coming from the truck when I pushed, just the added outwards pressure from pushing into the flexy board ... which then added a little more turn.

on the cronins, that little extra push produces more pressure AND even more lean + turn on the trucks, so that the rear wheels REALLY come loose. after my first shock I enjoyed playing with that behavior though and it was amazing how easy one got into a quick controlled slide with 42" and the largest wheelbase in the universe. wish the wheels wouldnt make this loud annoying fart sounds when they slide though :joy:

a very pleasant suprise was the grip while carving: on my calibers, whenever I switched between left and right carving arcs and decompressed the board in that moment, the motor wheel broke loose and the motor quickly spun up (which annoyed me because of the sound). on the cronins, somehow that doesnt happen. it could be the weaker smaller motor, but I felt like I used about the same torque in these moments - like slightly uphill to keep my speed. once I noticed that I tried to provoke the behavior, but I definitely had more grip on the motor wheel when it was unloaded. 

aside from cronins: the truck adapter performed flawless, not sure that the heat transfer is working superwell, but that didnt feel like an issue anyway. big suprise here with the difference of enertion mount vs. full aluminum APS mount: the motor runs NOTICEABLY cooler, because the whole mount heats up ... and thats comparing a 168KV 6374 to a 190KV 6355, i.e. smaller higher kv motor motor -> more current for the same torque and its pretty much fully closed too = many reasons why it should run hotter to begin with!

anyway, Im really happy - and that new 160Watt charger is REALLY fast, going back out very soon again :grinning:

@whitepony Wow I'm just now trying my ronins on my eboard and they are amazing paired with 90mm abecs everything is smooth as can be. Definitely feel more comfortable taking corners at speed compared to calibers. I catch myself going further and further from my home because my ankles aren't sore from the ride. The only downside is that it makes higher speed feel slow lol. I'm just at about 45 km/h top speed on 9s with lipo and plan to go 11s with 18650s. I'm using a different method for mounting my motor mount that isn't ideal, still waiting on the pipe to epoxy on the Ronins.

nice! :grin: how did you mount it? the torqueboard 28mm wouldnt have been enough for my 15mm belt - my mount is flush now with the end of the 30mm pipe with 1mm wall thickness that I stuck in as far as possible!so probably you might need to file the truck a little bit (unless you had aps moints?).

Dude! I hacked one of my Ronins to pieces I removed material to get to about 17mm then got a 5mm thick spacer cut it in half and used that as my adapter. It's quite embarrassing because it's not angled perfectly (off about 3 degrees maybe). I'm just calling that hanger a "for science" haha. I have torque mounts and as you can read I'm not afraid to hack away. Actually I made a longer axle and I'm able to fit two enertion 12mm pulleys as I'm going for dual 6355 with 15mm belts. Essentially I made a 197mm ronin hanger

Yes, the 15mm belts only have 1mm of over hang so the pulleys are actually around 14mm wide. Where I really need the width is on the motor pulley because there is less teeth in mesh. I only have one motor connected but there is plenty of room because I have 195mm trucks essentially.

i doubt youll get much benefit from it! on the weekend, I actually slammed my motor right into the ground, because I underestimated a pedestrian sidewalk height - made a horrible sound, the APS motor took it like a man with a thick scratch and the mount & truck adapter was completely unaffected! I have no doubts that this connection is made to last!

I got around to epoxying the pipe and i have no doubt it will hold. Nowhere as pretty as whiteponys but it'll do (covered my hack job i had done to fit mount previously). It was slightly small so i shimmed it with a coke can lol. With 90mm wheels my mount doesn't see the pavement as often anyway compared to kegels. I replaced the stock axle with custom stainless steel axle so I can fit dual 15mm belts still to come. I managed to bend the stock axle and my new axle has held up to more abuse. I have the enertion wheel pulley currently but might switch to diy/torque pulley and use spacers instead. Thanks for sharing this method @whitepony

I can definitely use without shimming I just feel it is a better fit like this. It's a 28mm aluminum  pipe I got from eBay 1mm thickness I did remove material from two sides from hanger to fit further down.

nice looking mount! whats the inner diameter? would be nice to make it identical to torque's and/or alienpower system if you also plan to make adapters for ronins (they both should also even out their inner diameters so that all adapters are compatible!).

if your machinist works something out for ronins, I think you'd have QUITE a big market for adapters!

@Eboostin once I get the adaptor ironed out I will start a thread with more details.

@Titoxd10001 right now I have it set for a 265 belt with about 4mm of adjustment on the motor.  The motor is a little tight to the truck but works.  I may bump it up to a 280 belt for a little more room.  If I remember correctly CTC was 65mm.

@whitepony that is an awesome idea. Let me get the bushing straight then I can design it as an adaptor for the other mounts.  Working off your 30mm bushing, most of the mounts have a 24mm to 28mm clamp or opening for the hanger.  It may still work though.

I haven't tried mounting the motor inwards because my board has a drop but for the motor facing the back I'm using 285 belt (15/36) and I would go bigger if it would fit. Maybe 290 is max that would fit on my current mount. At these lengths i think steel mount would be better. Are you planning aluminum or steel?

Quick update.  The Ronins are obviously cast and the process is very fine but they are not of "machine tolerance".  Each casting is cleaned up by hand leaving slight differences in each hanger.  The end user might need to make fine adjustments to the bushing which will clamp to the hanger for an air tight fit.  We compared notes this morning and he is printing the prototype this evening.  We will go from there and decide if we need to leave any extra material for fitting with a file.  The fitting will not be a big deal if we even need it at all.

Also, how are you routing the motor wires. I only make the motors face in such a way that the wires come out away from the trucks/wheels. Yours is coming toward the wheels.

The aluminum I bought isn't that strong. When I relied on the the third screw (between the two big screws) so my mount wouldn't move it cut through the tube. Now I mostly rely on just the clamp from the two bigger screws and tighten those suckers down and lots of loctite. It shouldn't be a problem now but steel would give me peace of mind. The aluminum I got is probably not the best but there wasn't that many tubes in 28mm I can find since the US insists on using imperial

I used g-flex with lots of 404 filler (doesn't flex like the name implies.) I think it's 6060 aluminium.

I tested this setup today to my brothers house which is about 12miles round trip and it is crazy with two motors and hit 34mph in the bike lane. Mounts don't really hit anything over driveways or large cracks but one mount moved slightly without third screw so I'll tighten it down and if makes a hole i probably fill it with something. It's good to see that you @Chris1 and I think OKP now are working on ronin truck motor mounts. They're a safety feature to me because they're so stable but you can still turn on a dime to avoid ppl that open their car doors all the way that I've had to avoid a couple of times now.

motor ground clearance is very low though - fits your board drop version, but for most boards you'd want more motor clearance, else you cant ride up to any sidewalk anymore!

ist basically what I wrote earlier: if you reduce ground clearance, you can fit any mount length ... but imo 280mm is the minimum distance for a halfway reasonable ground clearance for 63mm Motors.

that sounds perfect, Id be really interested in some mounts myself - could maybe ship them with a customs declaration of 22eur so I wont have to pay anything ontop! :slight_smile:

id be very interested in black anodizing too since I always need stealth items and silver aluminium is too much bling, catches the eye right away! :stuck_out_tongue:

So CTC goes from 67mm to 79mm correct?

For a 208mm belt with a 16/36 tooth gearing CTC would be 73mm.  I left 6mm on each side so yes, 67mm-79mm but you have to take into account the thickness of the mounting screws.

I'm in for a pair myself. If there are more EU people then happy to organise group postage from the UK. Also like the black anodised idea - bling not my thing ;-)

started setting up a 2nd cronin adapter for my DIY bamboo gfk board. last time worked out very well, however I felt like I had a very small misalignment between motor and wheel, maybe 0.5° off or so. getting ultra precision alignment isnt too easy - the "fix both pipes to the aluminium angle" precision is pretty ok, but, while it might have been aligned prefectly to a parallel axis to the truck hangar, it was not perfectly aligned with the actual steel axle of the wheel.

but I had an idea to fix it and it worked out very well!!! :smiley: 

since I use slow curing epoxy (24h cure time at 20°C), I set the aluminium profile casting setup up last night and this morning, about 6-7hours later, I checked the viscosity of the epoxy. I was very happy that I could still leave fingernail marks, but it was cured enough that it properly fixated the pipe to the hangar already.

I removed all the aluminium angle alignment stuff, actually mounted the motor mount a bit too close to the wheel so that, with my best aligned wheel-pulley-combo tightened down, I would put pressure on the motor mount and probably push it towards the kingpin by about 0.5-1.0mm. I fixated the motor mount properly, and started to tighten the wheel carefully. when the pressure between wheel pulley and motor mount built up, I could see the motor mount aligning perfectly with the wheel pulley thanks to still fairly soft epoxy.

its curing now for the last bit and tonight it will the best aligned motor mount wheel pulley combo Ive ever used! :slight_smile:

great post mate ! happy to see that the adapters made it ! I'm actually working on a custom mount for Ronin; only issue is that it's easy to mold with epoxy but to get the part in 3D is really a shame. I may look to get a 3D scan of the Ronin Cast hanger. take care!

Can you please provide more info on the extended axles? Were you able to find them pre-threaded? I've been looking at stainless steel rod but looks like the threads will have to be machined. The hand tool thread cutters won't work from what I've read.

Sure. I bought 5/16 hardened stainless steel rod from McMaster (they have 8mm but it wasn't hardened.) Also purchased a die from them which was real expensive. The difficult part is securing the rod, I put it in my vice and also used vice grips. The die does cut but takes a lot of force by hand.

anyone have the 3D of the hanger of the Ronin Cast? I started to do some prototyping by adding slices but now I'm more down to get a 3D scan of this hanger :)

Thanks! I need two axles because I'm doing front and rear. 

Found the die you mentioned, $60, yikes. 

One more thing, which side has the knurling?

I don't remember what side but there is small gaps around one side so just hit it from other side. Pricey tool but some machine shops charge $70 an hour. I haven't made an axle in awhile but if it's not to difficult I can probably sell some at a reasonable price.

The axles are stainless steel custom made. Holding up good so far. They're secured using epoxy. I've mentioned them in other post in this thread

This time I removed axle by adding washers and old bearings on knurl side and tightening the axle nut down forcing it out slowly.

Our drive requires that the trucks be turned down on the lathe.

I suppose you could contact him and possibly send in your hangar for modification.

That's what I did

You could copy WhitePony's DIY mount mod with Alien mount

The spline drive is so much more attractive because you can quick rotate your wheels for even wear.

Sadly no they weren't.  The machinist I was working with up and disappeared and I wasn't able to get files from him.  I had one print made that was sent to @longhairedboy for him to continue.

The problem is the hangers are cast and each one is slightly different. He scanned four different hangers and took an average of each and produced a mount from that.

 After he disappeared I just decided to turn mine down on a lathe and run dual hubs.

Sry for digging this one out. I have a aps-style mount on hand which I want to fit onto my cronins. Does anyone have a spare piece of their steel tube which I can use? I don't want to pay premium for shipping ordering a big ass tube... Of course I'll come up with the shipping costs :)

EDIT: Maybe a spoon of resin thrown in there too :sweat_smile: will tip you haha...
