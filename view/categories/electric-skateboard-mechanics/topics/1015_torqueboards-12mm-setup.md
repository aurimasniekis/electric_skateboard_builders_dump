Hi guys,

ATM I actually only have 9mm. The 15mm options are sold out but should have a 12mm option soon.

12mm belt would be more durable, but doesn't a wider belt cause more drag when coasting?

Yeah, they do cause more drag but it results in much better acceleration, riding and stopping power.

I plan on having 15mm soon as IMO that 3mm is a "nice" to have.
