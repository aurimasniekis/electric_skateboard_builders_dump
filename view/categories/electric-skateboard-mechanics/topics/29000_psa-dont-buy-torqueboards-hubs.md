From my initial ride, I had issues with the new TorqueBoards hubs, and should have learned my lesson, but didn't, and now got tossed off my board doing 30mph, when the bolts holding the hub together backed out, ripping my phase wires apart, and tossing me. 

After 5 minutes of riding them the first time, these bolts backed out, and one fell off completely. Not to mention, the set screws holding the collar on slipped, ripping the phase wires. I contacted diy, and eventually got a response. They told me to add loctite. Drill a pilot hole for the set screws, and loctite those. Not sure why they sell a product without that done if it falls apart after 5 minutes without. Now their "customer service" dropped off the map when I asked for replacement bolts and solution for the loose urethane.

I stupidly decided to go for another ride after performing their "fix". I rode another 4 miles (that's a record for these), and while going roughly 30mph one of those same bolts backed out and chaos ensued. 

Now I'm stuck with a $400 piece of trash and some nasty road rash. So yea, don't be an idiot like me and buy this garbage.

I feel for you but I've gotta say if the bolt backed out a second time then you didn't apply the fix correctly.  You should be using blue locktite, 4 drops per bolt and let it cure for 24 hours before stressing it. 

Dexter (@torqueboards) has never been anything but fair to me.

Why didn't the bolts go in from the other side? Then if one fell out it wouldn't chop your phase wires and seize your wheel. Things fail, but when they fail in this manner people get sued.

Exactly what I been telling hummie. And it's true. Everyone should strive to make as fail safe as possible products. Luckily, his motors are pretty fail safe, so no real issues for me. My only experience with torqueboards was with the power switch, which I had 3 of and all failed within a day. So I learned my leason. Which is why I try to design and build as many pieces of my board as possible.

I found the opposite.

Good hubs should have zero maintenance. With belts, I found my self consitantly trying to adjust belt tension, motor mount position, ect. to get it right. With good hubs, there's no way to mount it incorrectly.

I found far less maintenance from hubs.

But the key is, you need good hubs. I have yet to see a good hub motor that doesn't have any flaws... Hopefully, the day that this happens is right around the corner.

Once you set your mount and pulleys right, there's not much maintenance to be done. I've never had to adjust, re tighten, or replace any of my drive train, especially since i moved to 12mm belts, haven't broken a single one

I'm sure thats the case.

I think we both have experiences (Namasaki and I) with bad systems. Mine was the enertion system, that used a single 9mm belt.

If I turned a corner too have, the wheel bent a bit, and the pulley would move with the wheel and now, you have a misaligned gear. It was a complete mess that I never got to work correctly. Too much frustration. Then I found the carvons and hummies motors, and never have drive train issues like this again.

I aligned it correctly edventually, but the core on those wheels could flex. The result is the belt tension changes the ever so slightest on corners and hard carving, and the belt can now slip. If I put it tight enough that it'll not slip on corners, it would break from being too tight the rest of the time I'm not cornering or carving hard. There was not winning. At least now wit hummies motors, I know the design is structurally sound and theres a 0 percent chance something will come out of alignment in the drive train due to cornering or carving.

I still don't buy into the hype of hubs. Many many problems can arise with different variables. Good old belt drive is still my personal choice. The worse case is the pulley loosens or belt snaps. No hype, just ride worry-free.

With hummies motors, I've had rubber fall off, rubber and the plate fall off, motors short, outer bearings break twice. IDK what else I could do at 25 mph+, but every time, I could ride out safely. They are mechanically very sound. The inner bearing has now been beefed up so this can't happen. The plate was not cut to speck, which left rubbers which expand with heat to jump over the flange ring that holds it on. Riding on the plate at 25 mph, I was able to safely slow down and stop. Another time, I had lost screws that hold the plate on while changing hub wheels before. I was down to 2 out of 6, they wiggled free and good by wheel (I acutally looked for like 30 minutes, and I couldn't find it, lol). On a 7% grade down hill at around 25-26 mph and I was able to ride on the grooved can for around 100 ft till I stopped safely. Solution: weak locktite on screws, and make sure you use all of your screws. The fact the wheels expand like this is a problem, which is why a core is going to help fix the wheel problem. Red Locktite is very strong on long contact patchs like the v1 hummie motors. We found with a press, and 2 people, and a 6 ft tractor wrench, it was very hard to remove. The new one has an even longer contact patch with the hanger. Hanger broke in the v2? Now we have a custom hanger with a 12mm axle.

 All of our problems with hubs, have solutions. It has taken multiple versions now to get to this point. But mechanically speaking, these motors in particular design wise, are very fail safe IMO, which is important for hub motor designers to think about. I'm worried about motors that don't have an axle rod and instead, mount to the center hanger piece. If that fails, you with eat shit hard... Axle rods are there for a reason...

[/quote]

Sure a belt drive is more work setting up and might require more routine maintenance but the gear reduction allows them to clime steeper hills and run cooler and get better mileage.
When the wheel bearings wear out, they're quickly and easily replaced. And the motors are much easier to maintain.

Though a direct drive is easier to set up and doesn't require much routine maintenance, they draw more current, run hotter, struggle to climb steep hills with heavy riders and when the bearings wear out, it's a hassle to replace them.

incorrect. Hubs are just weak links from the get go. Direct drive would still use a pinion gear and a spur/counter gear for the wheel.

Why do you think that? They are way simpler. Theres less parts to break. There's a lot of shitty hubs on the market, so yes, at this time, hubs are not a great solution, but that will change soon.

> Simpler

I can somewhat agree with that, though with the way it's mounted, the additional parts, additional screws and bolts, you can argue that hubs are complicated in their own way.

> Less parts to break

The only part to really break with a hub vs belt drive is the actual belt. It's essentially the same motor just placed outside. Your pulleys and mount don't really break unless some kind of catastrophic event occurs in which a hub motor would also probably suffer damage.

> hubs are not a great solution

For now they're not, and I've yet to see the evidence to prove they are (I take Jason's "proof" with the worlds most gigantic grain of salt). To me it's like having a car stuck in 4th gear. Sure it goes fast, but it's just not efficient. You can argue that a pulley/belt drive train is like a car stuck at 2nd gear, but I think it's more efficient than one being stuck at 4th given esk8's "stop-and-go" nature.

Really, if we want efficient boards, we need a gear box... Hubs or belt drive, there's one gear... Multiple gears will always be more efficient than one.

I think you can get decent efficiency from a hub. You do need to optimize the motor for each rider and their environment. There's no one sit fits all solution for motor kv, like their is with belt drive setups.

I did end up riding all the way home the last ride day, and I calculated it was a bit over 9 miles on an 8ah 12s with very inefficient hubs. I think most of my inefficiency with hubs has reallyu been a wind resistance problem. I rode no faster than 20 mph, mostly under 10 that day. If I go 20-30 mph, I would get 5 miles of range. This is also with hills, so I bet without hills, I think I could do 15 miles if I ride under 20 mph.

I simply believe that having a gigantic motor directly bolted onto the most stressful part of the board's axle just isn't realistically durable. Unless you have some silly thick tires to absorb all that harsh riding. I'm sure if you ride on smooth roads, they would last longer. I do like the idea of them being very clean minimalist look and ultra quiet while riding, but I'd rather have pedestrians hearing my board sound like a rocket approach them. That's just me!

I have these hubs, i had the same bolt come loose in my 1st test drive above 30mph. Pulled them all out, applied loctite and haven't had an issue with  it since. 

Expecting that stator to not spin on the hanger and tear your phase wires without drillng holes was a mistake on yout part imo.

Dexter has also been very fair to me as well. Im sure he will work with you. 

I hope u get it figured out too, those hubs on 12S FOC are a  blast!

This logic is pretty ridiculous imo. It's like the parent letting a child touch a hot stove so they "learn their lesson". I guess with e-sk8 you're supposed to buy products with the assumption that they are inherently flawed, and will require you to immediately take them apart to identify the problem and fix it before ever using it, right? I bought a complete product - motors, trucks, wheels, etc. I got everything with absolutely no instructions stating I needed to take out bolts and add loctite, file a flat spot on the hanger, drill a hole, etc. While this may seem like common sense to you, it looks like a half-assed, poorly thought out, rushed to market with zero testing product to me. Seriously, why would these bolts not have loctite applied at the factory before I got them?

I work in product development, and deal with legal and regulatory requirements to launch new products. I can say with absolute certainty that if my company launched something like this we'd get sued in a heartbeat, and a bunch of people would be fired. It is clear no testing was done, and if it was, they didn't implement any of the fixes or inform customers so they could proactively fix it before they get injured. Instead he waited for me to have a failure and reach out prior to telling me how to "fix" it. Do you see the problem here yet? It's blatant negligence by the company, and a law suit laid out on a silver platter for anyone who wants to invest $380 for a guaranteed return of tens or hundreds of thousands in court settlements, based on how severely injured you get when these hubs fail. Shouldn't take more than 1 mile of riding, so ideal for those on a tight schedule with limited time. Great investment opportunity for all those interested. Maybe I should write an ebook.....

Again, lesson learned I suppose. I will wait to see how carvons turn out, and in the meantime, stick to my belt drive setup.

But on a more serious note just yesterday I was thrown off my board. I believe it was the erpm limit I had set. 245kv on 10s maybe wasn't the best decision on my part but how was I suppose to know my focbox would be so good :rage: I am most definitely getting hubs though.

I'm sorry, but suggesting that people could go out and buy the hubs with the intent to sue with "guaranteed return of tens or hundreds of thousands in court settlements", is messed up. It quite possibly puts YOU in a legally actionable position as well. This is a totally crappy attitude. 
I don't think it's "blatant negligence". Parts fail in the real world. To even remotely have a case, you would have to prove that you didn't make a mistake on the install. Can you prove that you didn't tamper with the bolt upon initial install? Maybe you did everything PERFECT, but if you can't PROVE it...You are just blowing smoke, bro!
 
Don't get me wrong...I sympathize with you having to go through this, but be careful what you say and how you say it. It can come back and bite you later....IMO

I'm not going to get into an argument here, but when you email a company saying the bolts backed out, and they say other customers have had the same problem (ie, they're aware of the issue but didn't inform others or fix it) that is negligence. Plain and simple

Anyway, someone feel free to close this thread. Just want to keep it searchable in hopes of others not buying these.

If the screws threaded in from the other side this wouldn't even have happened...Yes hardware falls out. but when it backs out into the path of the phase wires and truck it's an obvious design issue. And it's dangerous. Look at it! How would you even know if this was happening while you're riding? I wouldn't sell these. @torqueboards you're asking for trouble with these.

@psychotiller If these hubs were dangerous. I wouldn't be selling them. That would be just f'ed up. Anyone who wants to get someone hurt for a quick buck should re-think their business model. That's not something I'd ever want to be apart of.

What difference does it make if the bolts back out from the front or the rear. Either way your screwed. They shouldn't get to this point to begin with.

I've been riding these hub motors at 25-28mph with no issues. I have other customers who ride these hub motors as well.

Why would you be riding at 30mph if you have already had issues in the first place? Wouldn't you otherwise be testing it at 10-15mph first off. Make sure everything is solid and then test it at a faster speed.

Of course, you need to install these correctly and you should be riding and testing the hubs before you go balls to wall with them. If these were sent completely installed then yes, I agree they shouldn't be having these issues. But it's DIY, there should be proper due diligence. You should check your setup and make sure it's safe to ride.

There are many things in life which you purchase that don't include instructions. If you aren't sure or don't know how to assemble something without instructions why would you purchase in the first place? Of course, this excludes the people who do study and learn.

Its a physical problem that the bolts can and do exit towards the phase wires. If they fell out the front they would just fall out out without seizing the wheel or breaking your phase wires. Seriously. You can't see the difference in effect? I'm not bashing what you sell. I'm telling you it's a dangerous design.

I don't mean to beat this like a dead horse. But everyone should be careful. The last thing we need in this sport is people getting hurt. It's not my intention to send or sell products that people can get hurt by but there also needs to be some thoughtfulness in what we do. If more people did have these issues, I'd take them off the shelf in a heartbeat but that's not the case.

@willpark16 - Post a warning? This item must be installed correctly otherwise you'll get hurt?

This should be something everyone thinks about. If you don't, I would.. A pair of scissors don't include "Warning: Do not cut your fingers off". Longboard trucks don't say "Warning: Do not forget to tighten your axle nut".

@psychotiller - Either option would stop or slow you down in movement. Whether or not your hub wheel falls off or your phase wires get snipped. These can be issues without the proper pre-cautions. Your not going to install your longboard wheels without an axle nut.

Sure, you can say it's a bad design but so is everything else without proper installation. Besides, your only other option is to use a cir-clip/c-clip which would also make it harder to install/repair/modify otherwise. However, this is a considered option for a future hub motor simply because of the design aspect but not because bolts back out.

Of course, you need to install these correctly and you should be riding and testing the hubs before you go balls to wall with them. If these were sent completely installed then yes, I agree they shouldn't be having these issues. But it's DIY, there should be proper due diligence. You should check your setup and make sure it's safe to ride.

I agree!! 
It's like when you buy car parts. They come in a box with limited or zero instructions. You have to know what you are doing to properly install the part. You would be a fool to just bolt it on, without going over and checking all of the bolts and the whole assembly, for that matter. And rechecking after assembly. Then testing it with light load(If it failed in 5min, they probably were already loose and it would have been noticable). 
It sounds like the motor was just bolted on fast and ridden hard to failure. It failed in 5 min...Sure sounds like it was loose before it was ever ridden..Which would be on the installer. 
Who goes balls to the wall on an untested machine? Not a good lifestyle practice.

I'm not sure if you're missing my point on purpose or not. Seeing that long bolt coming out of the wrong side of that wheel gives me the heebee jeebees.

But there's a huge different between things failing and things failing with bad results. Everyone knows longboarding is dangerous. A big part of the fun is mitigating that danger and pressing on. I would'nt ride a bike with a loose front wheel either. 

Do what you want I guess...

Why would you be riding at 30mph if you have already had issues in the first place? Wouldn't you otherwise be testing it at 10-15mph first off. Make sure everything is solid and then test it at a faster speed.

I did. Where did I say that I didn't do this. I was stopping every half mile or so and everything seemed ok. Then all the sudden I went flying. It seems some are ignoring the whole "I rode 4 miles..." part. You're acting like I added loctite, said "screw it. no time to wait for it to cure, and tightening these bolts hurts my hand", threw my board down and just slammed it to full throttle.

The part that catastrophically failed was the hub itself, which as you know, does come fully assembled. The stator slipping previously is completely irrelevant to the bolt backing out and you can point your finger and call me a moron all you want about that (for the record, you told me that just tightening down the set screws hard enough should be sufficient). The hub itself failed. Nothing at all to do with installation. As has been pointed out, it's a poor design, and you should have fixed it and emailed existing customers to let them know there is an issue. You're focusing on one aspect (not drilling a pilot hole for the stator to mount to) which isn't even what caused the problem. Your scissors and trucks analogies are just ridiculous too. Come on man.

I'm done with this though. I got the point. Your product is flawless, and I'm an idiot who should carry a driver with me on every ride, stopping to tighten the bolts every mile or so. I mean, it's DIY. Noted.

Sounds like everyone is getting pissed about this.  As far as the facts go...it seems a better design to have the bolts o. The outside of the so that if it backs out then it his the ground and not electronics or the other wheel.  It also seems that if the bolts had been fastened with locktight and allowed to cure this never could have happened.  [

This sounds like exactly what you did.  Without more info I can't accept that the bolts backed out with correctly applied and installed locktite.

I have had this same issue multiple times on both a pre-assembled freeflow and a set of dual hubs that I fixed with loctite temporarily, but honestly I still don't fully trust them and I plan to drill small holes for the set screw to grab. The biggest issue I have with the design is the tiny screws holding the hub ring on breaking off. I think replacing all of the hardware with better stuff and using loctite would definitely help.

I feel the pain, it sucks, lets call it design still in it's infancy (beta)? and one has to question why the loctite failed to cure?
In the motorcycle world before you can compete or do a high level track day with a fast group you need install a catch can/bottle for radiator fluids and wire all your engine bolts so they can't back out and cause injury to someone else or you (you drill a hole in the bolt head and tie it off with piano wire).
Sad but true this shit happens...

I don't want to judge these motors, cause I've never tried them. But from a design point, seems safer to have it fail with the screws on the outside instead of inside. Yes, your some what screwed either way, but I've had the screws that hold hummies wheel on the motor fall out and I was able to ride it out on the metal can without a spill (it was my fault, not a design flaw in this case). If they came out like this, that would not be the same case.

These screws should have more threading too. There's too much stress on them for such little threading. Triple the threading length, and lock tight will never be needed, they will stay on by themselves.

I have 4 of these hubs, there are lots of improvments from the last version which I appreciate. Biggest problem with the last version was the ring that retained the urathane coming loose. Dexter completely solved that issue with this new design. The new urathane locking ring also came with larger bolts and loctite already added! The bolts on the back dont have loctite though, big whoop. Add some loctite and forget about it. He also improved the torque with a longer stator and also added sensors which is a huge improvement. 

These are still the best value hubs on the market imo and Ive tried pretty much all of them.

If anyone is still convinced they want these after reading this thread I'm willing to trade the motors and front wheels only (no trucks) for some trucks, dual motor mounts (for 63xx motors), and pulley set for flywheels (16/36 ideally). Figure this is the only way I'll recoup some of the costs. You'll probably need new urethane since the bolt ripped a chunk out when I had the accident.

I take no responsibility for you also getting wrecked by using these.

Oh, and they're the 130kv version

Why is the shank length 4x the threaded length?
Sure if it's a 100% threaded bolt it's gona take a lot longer to tighten but would you rather more time spent assembling or munching on concrete!!

You're only seeing a small portion of the threads in my pic (maybe why everyone assumes I didn't apply loctite correctly?). It's actually like 50/50 threaded vs not.

It is, even hummies little motors with all of my abuse and miles on miles of aggressive hill riding, never got above 270 F

All though now, I'm rewinding these guys with 392 F windings, as I do get them to 250 F by the end of my commute to my university. They were likely cheap shitty quality wire before. Another benifit to the new design, since they will be assembled here in SF.

I currently use the Loctite Semi-Permanent blue for my screws on my board.  Only put in 10> miles so far but it came a little bit loose after the first 5.  I tightened it up and it hasn't shown a problem since.

Would you recommend the red 272 instead?

I just hold my heat gun to my mounts or screws that I need to break free. And the amount of time it takes, I'm positive its not getting to 300°

And no to your question. But a bolt falling out of my mounts isn't going to seize anything.

I think what Im really getting at here is that there will always be drawbacks to the various designs out there. With hubs, we currently have slipping urathane, loosening bolts, rough ride from thin or hard urathane,  motor cans exposed to debris,  overheating, etc. I had the same issue where the metal rods in Jacob hubs with the  ralphy 100mm mod moved inwards and tore my phase wires clean off which fried a VESC X. I informed him and he immediately offered a refund. I didnt accept the refund because I personally feel that I should take on a certain amount of personal responsibility for buying and using newly designed and experimental parts in an inherently dangerous sport. This is my personal stance and I  can respect others opinion on this as well. I just want to make sure that the hub motor innovators in this industry like Dexter, Jason, Jerry and Hummie can keep bringing new and improved versions of their product without fear of retribution. I have yet to see a new version of hubs that wasnt substantially better than the last. I have also not seen a new version that solves all the typical issues but they sure are getting close. Just my two cents. Cheers

Nice, the only issue I can think of with washers is you might need slightly longer bolts to get the same thread depth. Theres always the saftey wire method as well. I actually used it in the urathane retaining ring of Dexters 1st version of hubs 👌.
