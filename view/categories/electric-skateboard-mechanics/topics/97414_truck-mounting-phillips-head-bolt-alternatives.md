Does anyone use anything other than the typical Phillips bolts to mount their trucks (which aren't prone to stripping)? 

I just ordered a bunch of socket head screws as an alternative. I would have preferred star bit screws, but I couldn't find any over 1''. I'm curious if others use different substitutes?

I use these (metric M5) screws on my trucks. Works fine. On the other side M5 locknuts.

m5 hex all the way. A tad thicker than the usual 10/32.

Also, you might have more luck by holding the screw from moving and spinning the nut, instead of the other way round.
