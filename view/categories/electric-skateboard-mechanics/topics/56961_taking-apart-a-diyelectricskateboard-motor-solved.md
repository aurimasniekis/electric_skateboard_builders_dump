I have a Diyelectricskateboard Motor 6374 190Kv and I wanted to paint it and I was not sure how to take it apart. Does anyone know how?

let me tell you right now its very very hard to pull apart the the motor as the magnets are extaordinarily strong. i have already tried it.

Just remove the c clip n slide off the rotor. Not too hard

While you have it disassembled put some epoxy on the outer rings that holds the magnets, this is the only weak part of the motor, 1000 miles with constant vibrations looses it

Also watch your fingers when putting the stator back in

Keep the motor bolted to the mount for a better grip.

@moon

Rubber mallet and moving this around through the shaft hole to the other side

Then a bearing press holder with the rubber mallet. To put em back in after using a vacuum bag to vacuum pack the bearings

Stupid question but I made a homemade bearing press and destroyed the bearings (also a 190kv 6374) would you share some instructions or a video of you putting the 3 6800z bearings back in ? I got them out the same way you did but getting the new ones back in is a bitch as they are so tight

throw your new bearings in the freezer to get them to contract ever so slightly and it will make a difference putting them in.  Leave them in the freezer for like an hour or two.

Bit late now but I managed to find shim washers on AliExpress, depending on your shaft you need 8/10/12 ID. They come in various thicknesses. I measured both a 0.2mm washer and a 0.3mm washer on an APS 6384
A 6374 freerchobby had a single 0.5mm shim on it
