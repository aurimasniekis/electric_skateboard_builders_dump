If you had to build over again would you do it again? My specific build will be for a street board and I'm going back and forth between keeping it 2wd vs 4wd. With 4wd I'll be approaching 40 pounds... 

I'd love to hear from personal experiences !!!!!

@psychotiller and @longhairedboy have  

I just tested @psychotiller 4x4 belt board. Lots of power and free rolls pretty well even on pneumatics.  I give it a üëç

No experience on a street setup though? I feel like it would be stupid quick outta the hole.

Well his 6-shooters count as a street set up imo but no I haven't ridden any urathane  4wd belt drives. No doubt all 4wd's are quick out of the hole.

Dang... just realized I don't think the front end of the evo will fit a belt motor :p 

This might have just made my choice much more simple lol

Yeah, I agree with @BigBoyToys that the sixshooters behave more like street wheels, but we do ride them quite a bit on dirt, gravel, and grass. I can't wait to open this awd up on a trail. Oh! and it weighs under 30lbs.

They seem like a solid compromise between the two. Not as big and bulky as typical pnematics and less side wall flex,  but still have grip, dampening and  most of thr off roadability I love about  pneumi's.
