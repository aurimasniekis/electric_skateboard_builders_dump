300 pieces minimum order, likely no customer service at all or recourse for manufacturing defects.  Just get wheels from @psychotiller or @Kug3lis or @trampa :smiley:   It's worth it... plus they are metal...

I actually wouldn’t mind trying those for 40$ a set, I am going to keep that link for when I finally am able to build a MTB.

Are the trampa superstar made fully in aluminum? Those Chinese ones are described as aluminum spikes and plastic rims.

Brent was in the internet, great find :grin:

I'm 99.99% sure these are the superstar hubs, even on the pic on the tire there is written "Trampa Threads". If this price is with tube and tire then I'm depressed now.

Within the last 2 years I bought 16 Superstar wheels (each 58.37$) which is in total 933.92$ incl. tax. So I have 16 wheels, for 3 times the amount I could have bought 300 wheels, sounds like a joke.

I had a chat with Frank and got some more info about this Alibaba wheels. Because he can't post in the "Esk8 Parts Market" category I share his words here for clarification:

__________________

A: It is a Fake wheel, this is not our supplier. The Superstar is not made in China.
B. All pictures are taken from our website, infringing our copyright. They show our original Superstar wheels.
The company used Photoshop to remove our logos (not on all of them BTW)
C: In consequence you don’t see what you will get. The company can’t sell what they show.
D: We registered designs for the Superstar and Hpya Hub.

The Superstar is designed to the limits of the material used. We used modern stress analysis software to determine the shape and to trim off every gram we possibly could. The Material we use is a high tech plastic from a well known European manufacturer. The design is not tolerant to lesser material properties or air bubbles that occur when you inject on cheap moulds. The spokes we use are made from aircraft alloy and heat treated after processing the final shape.

MTB Hubs see a lot of strain and the past has shown us that many designs had issues with cracks and hubs broke apart in consequence. Most faulty designs have disappeared from the market for a good reason.
Our competition had to go through numerous iterations in their design process and now sell hubs that use a lot thicker cross sections and are heavier than our hubs.
The Superstar and Hypa Hub have never had any issues. They were rock solid from the very first day.
This is a result from the design process we used and the superior material properties of the plastic we chose for the design of the two products.
A copy product might replicate the shape we designed, but the copy cat doesn’t have the database behind the product. Stress analysis, moulding flow simulations, mould construction, material properties etc.
In consequence the copy product bears the risk of getting fatigue cracks after a period X.
Personally I would not feel very well putting fake alloy rims onto my car.
Same thing is true for my 5+KW E-MTB. These parts are safety critical parts! If a wheel disintegrates at speed the consequences could be catastrophic. I hope that no one will get hurt using such fake parts. The quality is unknown. There have been issues with broken, safety relevant plastic parts recently. Don’t put yourself at risk for a minor saving. If someone fakes products the business ethos is proven to be doubtful already!

Frank

minor saving? savings (moneywise) are pretty significant I'd say. 

Unless someone buys a few wheels, no one will ever know if these were as dangerous as Frank implies. Imagine if they're even more dangerous! The world needs to know, so that we can warn others not to repeat our stupid and dangerous mistakes!

FOR SCIENCE!

This just hurt my eyes. WTF is aircraft alloy? It's 6061 T6 extruded profile cut to slices. Nothing special about that. Also most of those high tech plastics are simply PA6GF30 which again is nothing special. Look at @okp products. Everything made from 7075 alu and this is top of the line stuff. I'm so tired of reading this marketing bullshit everywhere.

I don’t understand why everything needs to be  spaceship grade, with micrometer tolerances. Sure those Chinese wheels, if they are indeed copies, would not last long if abused but isn’t that the case for any brand name gears too? Shit breaks. By abuse, I don’t mean riding on rough roads, dirt trails or shit like that, like actually beating the crap out of it. 
If I keep banging any aerospace grade motor mounts or rims or whatever on curbs, won’t they also bend, chip or break? 
All I am saying is if we don’t try them, we will never know How shitty those rims are and saying it is Chinese so It’s shit doesn’t really convinced me anymore. And I am really interested to know if we need such high grade gear for esk8.

Magnesium was used in the space shuttle etc lol Some aircraft use steel in fracture critical areas coz they don't want it break. Depends on tempering.

Tells me more about their business ethos....
They tell you anything you want to hear. 
It is typical that fake part manufacturers claim to be the original supplier. 
The original moulds have the Trampa Logo engraved. You can't inject non Trampa branded parts on them. The moulds we use are pretty sophisticated pieces of art, designed to withstand a couple of 100K perfect shots. 

Superstars are not made in China, never have been made in China and never will be made in China. In total there are 7 different companies involved to make a complete Superstar Wheel to the spec we offer. There is no single supplier. The individual parts come together at our warehouse and are finally put together to your design requirements in Nottingham.

I know them all personally. I know the mashines involved and all details of the production process A-Z. We visit our suppliers during production cycles and adjust tolerances, debate improvements, packaging and shipping etc. 
We run our own production agency and inspect every single step of the production process and supply chain. Semi finished goods need to be transported from factory A to B etc. We handle that in-house. There is no China involved nor any subcontractors. The only way to make quality parts is using quality suppliers and long term business relationships. Most of our suppliers are making our parts for more than 10 years. And most of them make parts for other quality brands we all know. Non of our suppliers sell any goods directly and for sure not on Alibaba.

Is this the actual part? I have super stars, sixshooters, and evolve hubs. The super stars are for a trampa build I’ll never finish, the Evolve’s are on permanent loan to a broke buddy. 

The 6shooters see aggressive riding in mid 30s daily, still solid. I know for a fact the Evolve’s hubs were starting to deform under same stress, but still ok. The trampas are good, but I hate the pulley set up. 

I can’t imagine the plastic spokes are ok, are they? I’m open to science.

Can confirm they look good so far. I purchased a set of bearing adaptors from boardbumpers. The theory being that will be a good go/no go gauge to test hub space and dimensions etc. 
Well there you have it. They fit perfectly. Next test will be fitting a pulley designed to fit Tampa wheel bolts. I will update.
Also link supplied. 
Tell them that you want a set of 4 only and they will guide you through the rest. Pick some colours etc.
They also asked what bearing size etc I required. But it was all getting too hard. So I told them to send out the standard item. They could make it a direct fit for evolve wheels or whatever. But board bumpers already have a cheap adaptor.

I don't trust these wheels at all and I just don't think you should be selling them in the first place. People might not like @trampa or wherever but this is their design, youre likely risking people's life and the profits of the company that developed this design all in one foul swoop.

That's a dick move. I don't support people like that and I urge others to do the same

I have tried remain as neutral as possible. I haven't used them yet. I have said that they are not a Trampa wheel. Trampa has said that they thoroughly test their products before shipping. Their reputation is on the line. I would happily buy  a set of Trampa wheels, absolutely the way to go to ensure that the product is safe. Just a bit too expensive for me ATM.
This thread was started by someone asking if anyone had seen these or used them. I bought them to find out for myself and I assumed that the purpose of a forum was have free open discussion.
I have put forward what I am doing and what I found so far for the benefit of the group. Being as straight forward and open as possible.

The tyres from trampa are higer quality. The rim from trampa and the chinees clones looks almost the same. Only is the trampa rim real white and the Chinees a bit more yellow. The spokes are the same. Only the Chinese lose less their color when screwing.

Any MTB wheel would survive that test. The problem is dynamic loads, side thrust and material properties over time. Some plastics degrade faster than others. 

White hubs:
If you ad to much colour into the raw plastic, it impacts the material properties.  The white titanium dioxide pigments have sharp edges and over time they will cut the GF reinforcement. Especially for the white hubs we have tried several ways to eliminate the issue of strength loss and could finally resolve it without loosing the shiny white appearance. These details make the difference.

Totally agree. This is just a shits a gigs thing. I tried side loading by shoving the car around (more than in the video). It wasn't very effective. I tried drop testing on an angle for side impact load but couldn't get the weight to impact on it consistently. I won't be building a test rig. I am just going to ride it. It's just on an evolve for cruising. I usually loose interest in things before they get old. Pretty cool information all the same. I like learning new things like that. Very much appreciated.

I was also wondering where to get bearings? I am tempted to try those generic Chinese on aliexpress but I am also a little worried they will disintegrate and send me flying.

62.. not a typo.. id rather gear down on the motor since a 60T currently works with my janux idler mount was trying to stay in that general size so i would have to find other mounts..... they said their bearings for the hubs had an 8mm bore... vs the standard 10-12mm  so we will see if its a plug n play fit onto my TB trucks...otherwise i was gonna have to do the 638s IIRC and a diy board bumper option of some sort....

Metroboard

[https://metro-board.com/e-skate-shop/wheel-timing-pulley-metroboardx/](https://metro-board.com/e-skate-shop/wheel-timing-pulley-metroboardx/)

And you may all already know but they also sell those wheels, bit more expensive.

@Tamatoa 

heres my long review but not boring if i say so myself... one pulley has a little wobble so Ill take feedback on that....probably still useable.... naturally with an 8" tire wheel bite is going to be an issue... more so on the rear of my deck so if anyone has any input on me re-drilling and shifting the trucks back about 1/2" (maybe less) im open.This is in the video.... otherwise the tires seem good... the hub and spoke TBD once i get the other details ironed out.

i could be wrong but in the video it looks like that your front bushings are much tighter than the rear. But it should be the other way round. 
Stability at speed comes from a tight rear.

And you can try if the pulleys can be moved a tiny little bit if you loosen the screws. This way you can try to find the sweet spot where they don't wobble. But only if the position can be adjusted by a little.

@Ackmaniac thx for the suggestion... There was just a hair of wiggle room to try and get the pulley to balance a bit better.. Improvement, yes...perfect, no... But not any worse now than.anything ive had in the past... Was able to re drill and slide the rear truck back a 1/2" and now.good clearance and no wheel bute on my first low speed test ride.... Will ride tomorrow a little longer and further if my ankle is feeling good... However the ride felt even softer than my 6" and a little higher off the ground... Naturally lol

so the ride is pretty cush... going from the 6" aliexpress to these is like cloud riding.... especially over degraded asphalt...you know, the kind where its normal road...not terrible but getting to that point where youre thinking the city really needs to re pave this shit so i can ride my eskate fast and with ease...slowing down is for losers ...lol...

20/60 on my 6" was still pretty punchy with good top end...

these are 18/62 and was hoping the 4 tooth overall change would offset the added 2" of tire but its def lacking a hair of torque off the line and in uphill climbing... this is the first time Ive "actually" felt something where i was like hmmm..
 
maybe for fun ill throw a 16t on the motor to see what the change is..will have to consult the calc first tho too,
