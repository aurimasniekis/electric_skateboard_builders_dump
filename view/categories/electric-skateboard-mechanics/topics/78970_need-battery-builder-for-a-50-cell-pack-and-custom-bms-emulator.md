Hello Fellow Esk8 community! I am a lifelong skateboarder who was first introduced into the space by boosted with their first gen boards. Since then I have been buying and selling different boards at a loss only to experience different rides. Recently i purchased a scooter and would like to ask this friendly community if someone is willing to take on a 48-50cell Panasonic pack with a  custom bms? Details of the entire project are in the two links below. Looking for a respected builder. Thanks!
