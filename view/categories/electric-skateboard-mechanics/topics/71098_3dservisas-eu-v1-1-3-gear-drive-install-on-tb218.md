As most know, 3Dservisas.eu makes amazing esk8 parts and builds. I decided to take a chance on the gear drive for tb218 trucks. When it came in, you could tell right away it‚Äôs high quality.

![image|375x500](upload://hEYJVtk5apO8JmYC6Tta8IBF5Bf.jpeg) 

I went online to see the manual [Here](https://www.3dservisas.eu/1-3-218-manual.pdf)

It was helpful but it didn‚Äôt have all the information required to install.


I had issues with placing bearings into the 3Dservisas Hubs. I was told to use a press, which don‚Äôt have atm. I was able to force them in.

![image|375x500](upload://mpsQgTfivBeqDJKZVe1qBcN5VYV.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://zTJ0EnWs8BqqUzZkbDDy8MBoHhM.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://hyDeq0vjMSBfUIQtWIIp65FCKwp.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://4F53Dq3Cmd1qUPJ1hxciGtuHg48.jpeg)

3Dservices now offers bearing pushed in hubs. It‚Äôs a good option for nubs like me

I was going to install the gear drive but I ran into an issue. The axel on the motor is way too long. I didn‚Äôt have time for the group ride so I decided to use belt drive with 3Dservisas Hubs with Trampa 44T and Gunmies. It was fun but lacked torque.

![image|375x500](upload://BSSv4ZXCfaziYJIFLqxRY8LgcB.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jX1Ov00klIc2AbmCMeVFl0XlAa2.jpeg)

A few weeks later, I started to cut the axel with diamond blade then used angle grinder to grind down the axel. I did not do the best job but it worked.

![image|375x500](upload://euhnj5s0lY8pySJKmd2hbTn6wQL.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jqOTwC1AOBZQmAYVngb6HhjxzKp.jpeg) 

One of the mounting brackets didn‚Äôt fit the tb218, so I had to angle grind some hangar material off for it to fit.

I was stuck on these thin metal pieces, didn‚Äôt know where to install. It was not on manual. I did get written instructions, which helped a little. These metal pieces are suppose to help protect your motor from the grease you put into the GG.

Does anyone have a recommendation on grease? 

![image|375x500](upload://pZyJnZxJUh1ZbRc58nqyxCbynJy.jpeg) 

After taking apart the drive gear several times, I was able to fit these pieces in.

Hi, sorry was out of the house. Those metal pieces should go:

With 4 holes with cut side goes between motor and baseplate

5 holes round goes between wheel mounting and wheel gear to prevent V-ring from slipping off.

Will report back to you on this.

Last week used them with belt drive, torque was a bit weak for SF hills. Also my bushing and truck setup could not handle high speed (wobbles). 

The first run was in SF and those roads suck.

Which picture? It could be one where the motor axel makes the wheel protrude out.

That could explain why wobbles at high speed other than bushing/truck setup. I used bearings and spacers in the back to make a good fit with the trampa pulley. The spacing could be off with the front. I also ride hard and heavy, these were my first tb218 trucks and rode a lot of miles on them.

It also can be default position of hanger because of bushings my caliber ones were one side higher until I adjusted kingpin nut

I completed the 3Dservisas gear drivetrain tonight. It took me awhile to make sure the gears ran freely (correct amount of blacklash, ü§û). Then the M 2.5 by 10 screws kicked my ass. They are tiny. There are 12 of them. You must do them before mounting trucks. Small hands and good tools help. I got stuck on step 4 üòÇ

![image|514x500](upload://rT9DvFn249zQszsiEq6dWnfcPa0.jpeg)

I used white lithium grease. It was not paste, as recommend by Deckoz. I‚Äôll probably grab some down the road.

I‚Äôm happy i found thid thread. No idea how i missed it lol. 

Also got the gear drivr but have yet to install it as I‚Äôm waiting for the trucks to be complete. They sound sooo good this just hyped me up again! Thanks for the sharing and update.

How did you estimate the amount of motor shaft to cut off? Just wanna see if you had a different approach ti what @Kug3lis recommended me :smile:

Just that is exclusive with the complete kit, for 218mm TB truck.
3DS propose almost same set I think : 
https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2408/6975/products/IMG_0668_600x.jpg?v=1539118685
But it is not the exact same the exclusive one for TB 218 and your geared drive : 
https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2408/6975/products/IMG_0478_600x.jpg?v=1536245361
But maybe I'm wrong.

I really need those kinds of good stuff !
The hub adapter I have to mount the Superstar hub on the Supercarve truck is really ... weird (to not say bad)... Bud before any upgrade for those hubs, I'm just waiting to see what Haggyboard will propose (if I could go with 150/125mm wheel for my urban build).
Anyway, can not wait to see the GB for the 9" hubs :blush:

Did you know witch bearing are used with the option? I heard they are hard to set without a press?

Look at that gap between the hub adaptor and the bearing on my poor setup...

What size are those motors? I was thinking of doing something similar to this using parts I had lying around. A potential problem I have are the motors I'm planning to use: sk3 6374 which aren't "true" 6374 because of the nipple.

TB 6374 motors. Think sk3 are slightly bigger. From the picture there looks like space.

If two sk3 are 174 then I believe you could just put one speed ring on each axle before installing the drives.

I do not think that will work as 3DS gear drive is a hub sleeve.

[quote="Maxid, post:5, topic:64564"]
With a wide axle a la TB218 I‚Äôd go for a sleeve motor mount design just like what Trampa is using or what kuglis is doing in his gear drive. It‚Äôs bullet proof and easy to maintain.

> Just check this out - it might give you an idea of what I mean: Or this I designed something similar for my inner gear drive for 6inch pneumatics. Basically the ‚Äúclamp‚Äù part is a sleeve with a hole for the axle. The wheel will push it against the hanger and the rectangular shape of the hanger keeps it from moving around.

Exactly, if you put on a speed ring or two first it will force the drive out slightly giving you more space between the two drives.

I found better grease for the gear drive. I cleaned the old spray grease and applied liberally. The sound it makes is similar to a belt drive train, not too loud.
