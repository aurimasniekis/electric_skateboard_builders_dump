In my plan to build my first electric skateboard as part of university project, I designed a motor mount based on the one from torqueboards. It's not exactly the same measurements in terms of shape but it is very similar. The clamp is exactly the same thickness and the same hole pattern, and the plate is the same thickness and similar cut outs for tensioning. 

The problem arrives when I 3d printed a mock up to be able to try the fit on my clone caliber truck. If I mount it correctly, the mounting bracket touches the wheel pulley (15mm width, as I plan to go monodrive) and if I mount it the other way, pulleys don't align becuase of the bracket thickness.

Any ideas why this is happening or what could I do?

This is a picture of the "wrong" mounting position:

If needed, tomorrow I will upload a version mounted the "correct" way, but the problem is the mount and pulley  are touching and the wheel pulley cannot rotate freely.

I'm having a hard time picturing out the mounting bracket is touching the wheel pulley when you mount it correctly. With the clamp being on the opposite side on your picture, it seems like it'd fit perfectly. Also might want to consider flipping the motor pulley as well to reduce lateral pressure on the motor shaft.

Put the clamp on the other side.  Make the hole in the motor mount large enough to accommodate the hub on the motor pulley. That's how I designed mine anyway

the pulley is just a mock up while I wait for the aluminium one to arrive on the mail. But thanks for the advice. I'll post a picture of the "good" way in some minutes for you to see.

I have my mount flipped around. It didnt fit at first, then i shaved away part of the truck so it would fit

Are you using 9" or 10" calibers? My own design did the same thing until I realized it was because I was not using full length calibers. The 9" ones are wayyy too short for 90% of motor mount styles.

I will do that when I have the correct pulley,  but not with this mockup,but yeah, nice idea, thanks.

That part where hanger starts to curve gave me some hard times but it was super easy fix. Like @TheSteelBaron said just file that part of hanger or like i did. I filed my clamp part and haven't had any issues in months atm.

according to @atenner, who sold them to me, they are 10 inch, but haven't measured them.

So I guess I'll have to do that, yeah. I really wanted to do it without filing anything but... :stuck_out_tongue:

Yea, you'd either have to file the curved part of the hangar or go with a thinner wheel pulley. In my experience 12mm has been perfectly fine.

I don't think those 3mm will make a huge different without the filling, but I'll consider it, yeah hehe.

ANd doesn't the truck get weaker by filling?

I use the same 10" calibers with TB's v4 mount on 12mm pulleys and it works perfectly :)

Didn't have to file the hangar.

I believe they are 10 inch, I remembering measuring to confirm, I think ? ü§î Had to files that same but down to fit Shogu12's mount with 15mm's. Only a couple of mm üëçüèª

Is that a 3d printed pulley? or aluminium? The design I chose was https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1719939

Any tips on making the mount better? I see you have a grub screw in the bracket onto the truck

It's the nylon/fiberglass pulley from enertion, I think it might be more space economical than the pulley you're using as well given that it doesn't have a retaining lip on the inside. From my expereience have a 2 piece clamp using double bolts is a lot more stable than a single bolt design like TB's. If you could incorporate that into your drawing, I would.

yeah, that was my thinking, that lip combined with the 3 extra mm might do the trick. I measured it and it's 1.5mm. I will look into all that tomorrow, as it is getting late here in Spain. Thanks for the input. One last question, with one bolt like the one I have and a grub screw onto the truck do you think it is sufficient? Or maybe a cold weld compound on top to fix it more?

So with my single bolt and double grub screws (perpendicular to each other on the truck). It still wobbles around. I had to put a piece of heat shrink in between to stabilize it which is why I like a two piece clamp more.

ok, I'll try to modify it. And with double clamp method are grub screws needed?

my two piece enertion clamp has 2 grub screws, but I wouldn't really say they're needed. A lot of people used them without using the grub screws at all. Just loctite and some torque should be sufficient.

I'll update tomorrow after I redesign and reprint everything hehe. Thanks a lot. Next step after this is all solved is electronics :P I will need another post for that haha.
