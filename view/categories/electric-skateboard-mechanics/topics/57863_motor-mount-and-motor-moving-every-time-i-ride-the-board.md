Hey Guys, 
This is my first build, and I bought some motors and motor mounts off of , but for some reason the screws keep moving every time I ride the board. I am using Thread locker, but it is still moving. 
Your support is appreciated

Other remedies I’ve heard of but never used myself;
• using a backer srew/grub
• drilling a pilot point into the trucks

^ this. Do not use it at all for 24 hours so it can properly cure. Also you might need a bit more elbow grease when torquing it down.

I'm considering having a friend weld the DIY mount it in place.  Anyone try that yet?  Any recommendation on what type of welding application would work best for this mount?

If it's a steel collar and aluminum hanger it's gonna be expensive and not very good.

You be better off just using jb weld.

Actually I shouldn't have said that. You'd be better off using blue loktite and letting it cure for 24 hours. Failing that, JB Weld has been known to work but it looks aweful.

I tried my best at making a simple pictograph instruction thing. I had this same issue until I did this method... pretty much @Deckoz's method. Since I did this a few weeks ago, I haven't had my motor mounts come loose one bit... but I have tightened the screws once in a few weeks, and they only turned maybe an eighth of a turn if that. The main idea is that you want everything already pushed up in the direction of the purple/blue arrows in the pictogram. A little bit of heat shrink as a shim helps a lot too on the plane of the hangar opposite to the rounded side.
