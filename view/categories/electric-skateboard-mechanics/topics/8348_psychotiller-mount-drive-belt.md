Hey, guys, I bought a Phsychotiller Mount and installed it. Then I came to realize that my drive belt doesn't work anymore. Can someone suggest a drive belt that would work for me? Thanks

This is on my site for a reason...Lately though I'm seeing that nobody uses it. WHY?

Believe you'd need a 265

That's the same one I use. You really can't mess that up once you put in your settings.

I would just suggest that you learn how to wrench,  and not expect everything to be done for you all the time.. oh! And at least learn how to friggen read too!

The info was there, you just couldn't figure it out.

There's your problem,,,Too dumb to be able to order the right size belt, which I never said worked with 13/36.

If you had a valid reason for a refund and didn't choose to take this path that would be an option.  Wanting all mounts to fit one belt though? 

I'm out!

Intelligence test? You already failed a long time ago

Lol..looking at other threads it seems you have issues with other parts and spacing too. 

What makes you think 255 is the smallest common belt size?

Tell you what,  send me all of your parts and I'll put it together for you properly.  You will only need to pay for shipping. And any costs related to buying correct parts/fixing your mistakes.

Here's a single 6374 on 180 rkp trucks using a 16/36 pulley combo. 255 belt fits perfectly! And everything is tight.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6f52b49cdc9ada0510e79d717c518db0670fcecd.jpg" width="689" height="390">
