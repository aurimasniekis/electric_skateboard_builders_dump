I was just searching online for some various Esk8 things I saw in the pics only thread and I came across this website for a company I've never heard of till now (Skate Kastle) which has some really cool things.  This company seems to have developed a couple very good designs for locking up your board, protecting your battery and electronics, and some very nice bash guards as well.  It looks like they mostly have focused on these being aftermarket parts for Boosted Boards, Evolve, and Torque Boards, but they are also making DIY versions of these as well.

https://skatekastle.com/shop?olsPage=products

Most of these items are just good designs of already available products (like bash guards), but their Esk8 U-Shackle looks like a completely new design and way to lock up your board.  Definitely going to be getting one of these!

Just in case, it should be known that I'm not affiliated in any way with Skate Kastle nor do I have any financial interests or anything similar with them.

They can still get all your electronics and motors though. Depending on how long you’re away I mean.

Yeah I mean there's probably no way to fully ensure they can't get your board, but it would take a while to do it and would likely damage it.  Also if there is some sort of traffic nearby that would likely discourage someone from trying to take it.

I would likely be hesitant about leaving my board out somewhere locked up, but I think this is a really good design all the same.

Deck is cheap, board is long and provides amazing leverage.

It would take someone less than 3 seconds to lift that board up and snap the front truck off. They could then just walk off into the sunset with your money.

I feel like the only real way to secure a board is inside an over sized pelican case that is U locked to a pole. In which case you'd need to carry an over sized pelican case in your pocket.

Oh cool, so have you seen these in person? I'm curious if the U-Shackle lock will work with other trucks then the Boosted Boards..  Seems like it should, but would like to make sure.  Do you know how the battery blocker works?

The battery blocker is for the boosted batteries, it replaces the battery plate for the boosted, and doesn't let you unscrew it unless you unlock it. I msged the owner and told him to come on, hopefully he can answer some questions.

its a whole industry now :( the police basically wont do anything even for motorbike thefts, had another friend call the police when a gang were angle grinding through 4 chains on his motorbike and told him straight they dont bother coming out even when he explained they would be at least 30 mins more to cut through all the locks and they had plenty of time to arrive and make an arrest.

still its better than the current "fashionable" way of stealing mopeds and motorbikes by throwing acid in someone's face. some areas in london you cant get a takeaway delivered  after 9pm because the drivers refuse to work due to the acid attacks. a 2 bed flat in those areas will still cost you the best part of a million us dollars through

Holy shit man that's crazy, I haven't heard about the acid attacks, that's awful...  I'd flip out if my local police didn't even pretend to give a damn.  I'm used to cops not showing up when I needed them to and of course showing up when I don't need them.  I just called the cops the other day and they didn't show up.  Super annoying...

In this state [you don't even need a license to carry](https://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills141/billpdf/commit/SB0656C.pdf). (2016 Missouri Senate Bill 656)

Don't break the law and you won't have to worry about what other people are carrying.

I’m speaking in the context of eboards being lifted by thieves. It’d be one hell of a day where it’s morally justiable to shoot a person over a skateboard. Then again, there have been cases of people shot and stabbed over a 6 pack of beer.

2000 acid attacks in 3 years, london had more murders than New York (for a few months anyway), over 40,000 knife offences in the UK this year alone! but honest citizens are not allowed to arm themselves in any way shape or form, of course!

I honestly dont know if being able to carry a firearm would make it worse or better. But i do know the bad guys can get guns very easily. The most popular hobby with the youth is stabbing each other, not sure if they would start shooting each other if they had easier access to firearms.

i mean i got jumped by a few guys because they thought i was gay... managed to stab 2 guys and get away but i got my jaw broken in the process from a baseball bat (im straight BTW, not that it matters) and yea... people dont need a reason for extreme violence and e-boards for a lot of people replace their vehicles (like myself) it wouldnt be that hard to swing a court case to show that when u get into the cost and "engineering" that goes into them

@uigiroux we've had this convo before haha when we conversed about my delta/wye switch in pms xD

Sorry to hear that you had to go through that. And yeah it may be legally justifiable to shoot someone over your electric skateboard, but in my mind, it’s an uneccesary death over something inanimate. If it is a life and death situation where the thief means great bodily harm to you, then fire away.

thank god you are not in the UK, you would be serving time now for carrying a knife and then a whole lot more for using it, while the police didn't bother to go after the guys who jumped you.

a farmer got serious time for shooting a burglar who had broken into his house after he had been robbed like 10 times previously and the police did nothing. probably the same guys doing the robbing too. he only wounded the burglar very slightly.

Being a thief is a choice, and you should not be defending them.  I'd be just fine if my state implemented the death penalty for stealing.  We'd have less thieves.  Being a thief is a choice you make, and you are free to decide to not steal.

yea, thats silly, and they would not find him even if they tried, it happened at an event that had THOUSANDS of people at it and spans the length on a peninsula... here in texas tho it was self-defense, and until they have a 2nd party present then charges cannot be pressed on either side, if they wanted to get me for "murder" then they would need a body which still has not presented itself... oh, and the person that helped me get to the cops was a local nurse that happened to see the whole event (idr most of what happen she told me) but i remember them saying hey homo, and when i didnt respond (mainly because i didnt know they were talking to me) one grabbed me and then i got cracked with a bat and blacked out


also, its legal here for use to carry any blade openly, to include full blown swords, i have a 6ft katana i carry around randomly

You're entitled to your opinion, but having a wreck is an accident.  I feel the way you do about those things.  Stealing things is a choice you make, and I can't feel sorry for thieves.  I hope they trip and fall on a knife.  Or, they can just go and steal things from you and stay away from me :smirk:

I get what you're saying but it's still extreme. First off, death row is incredibly expensive. More so than life in prison. And for something that petty? Yea, it's a big deal and they shouldn't be stealing shit that isn't theirs. Regardless if it's a cup, bike, eskate, or some priceless painting. 

I also get that it's a choice. But I also make plenty of stupid choices from minor to major. Should I get the death penalty because I stole a snack or two from the concessions at my summer job when I was a teenager? That was a deliberate choice that I wouldn't consider morally correct. If someone is coming after you with violence, I would understand. But for just simple theft? Nah dude.
