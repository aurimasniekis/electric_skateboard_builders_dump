With Jason dropping multiple hints that the Raptor drivetrain is going to be available on cyber Monday I'm keen to get an understanding of the history of these bad boys.

I'm a relative newcomer to DIY but practically every image I have seen on a Raptor includes chunked to hell worn wheels that I personally wouldn't attempt to ride.

What's changed if anything? @onloop are these coming equipped with the "best" formula with the new motors? You're not going to dump old stock on us hopefully? Is there a limit to how many you would sell and are they on the shelf now?

What about heat, I know its been discussed in the past but is there a real heat issue with these motors?

I'm really interested in buying a set, this post is to validate that possibility, not pick faults in the product. I'm hoping that will happen here.

If these are new new hubs, they have copper heat pipes, the axles are part of the hub, urethane is upgraded, there is better and bigger contact between motor & hanger.

On vesc tool the measured resistance of these hubs are 44-48mhom which is pretty good even compared to outrunners of the same kv but for some reason they heat up like crazy even with no load. I’m thinking maybe the steel laminations are bad or something causing the excess heat.... also there’s no extra friction from any part I can tell. They can heat up 10 degrees drawing 80 amps for like 2 seconds..... might be a dud motor for me but both of mine gets from 25 to 85 degrees in under 3km every single time

Good question. This happened with the fire sale wheels, but no one knew until wheels were already sold. To be fair, I don't know what percentage of those wheels were actually bad.

In the video he says that the power is the same, just everything is more efficient and stronger. So speed should be the same as Raptor 2, of course if you do 13s, it is going to be faster

That's only about 3x a sk3 6374 192 Kv motor. That's pretty amazing for a hub motor, all else equal I would have expected it to be around 130mOhm.

Hubs will always heat up more, but Enertion seems to be trying lots of new ideas to dissipate and endure the heat.

It was a risk ordering them....they were open when I talked to them on customer service that they really had no clue what the percentage was. I ordered 2 sets and have one of them on now and they seem to be fine.

The newest wheels were perfect from what I saw at first. It seems like they have cleared up their urethane issues.

That's surprisingly hot! Theoretically, that shouldn't be possible, 0.05 ohm * 0.15 A * 0.15 A = 0.001 watt of heat, even with 10x higher winding resistance, it shouldn't be heating up meaningfully at all. What am I missing here?

I have a pile of these hubs (there are more in my closet) including the newest version on my R2. Probably the worst purchase I've ever made. I've had the board for over a year now and the board in total has been sitting broken for basically a year with only about 200 miles riden between two R2's I've owned. The only problems I've had are with these hubs getting hot, tweaking out, making weird noises, bearing issues, ect... This is just my experience. But I've had a ton of people contact me with the same issues. Good luck guys. 

P.S- I totally forgot to mention that I only have around 10 miles on the latest version hubs due to shitty weather. I'm giving them a chance before my final call on these hubs. :slight_smile:

These all got sent to you for free under warranty? 

There is a very good chance there is nothing wrong with these motors, hub motors do need to be carefully setup and most people struggle to get them running well.

We actually found a problem with firmware that solved most issues.

We also have a solid warranty on our products, we also have a global network of repair agents that can help when your not able to get things working properly.

I do admit, we didn't design these motors to run cold at full RPM in a static no load test. They will get hot for sure when you do that.

Same as your car will heat up if you lift it off the ground & run it at full RPM.

I've had my raptor 2.0 board since May 2018 without major issues. Ride it nearly every day up long hills etc. I had wheels from the batch with bad urethane but otherwise solid. One of my hubs was missing a spring washer which I just replaced myself and eliminated small clicking sound my motor would make sometimes. These motors were from the old factory, the new factory has much more thorough QA checks. 

I've also been testing/sampling many of the new hub motors to get the FOCBOX Unity config dialed in perfect for the new raptor 2.1s. I currently have the demo board @Roan_Psyko  took on world tour. It was handed off to me for testing. Unfortunately, I haven't yet had a chance to test a set of new motors in combination with the updated truck/heat pipe, will get to that next week in Shenzhen. This is the urethane after a few hundred miles:

![20181106_232412|690x388](upload://nnnwVl5RUATCtnU6N2SzbuMyiVl.jpeg) 

The 2.1 motors are fantastic, just a bit quieter and smoother than than the 2.0 batch. Since receiving the new 2.1 motors (few weeks back) I've been commuting about 6-8 miles daily on them. I'm about 6'4" 180 lbs including my stuff, so a somewhat average to heavy weight and I will say if you ride them hard up a hill for several miles (old smaller trucks, no heat pipe) heat can become an issue. I have motor thermal throttling setup with the unity to prevent them being damaged. I am pretty sure that some of the raptor 2 hub failures can be traced in part to no thermal throttling implemented with previous motors.  

The 90mm hubs can do about 32-34 mph at 10s, so 1**2s should be something something like 39 mph top speed** and 13s 42mph :upside_down_face:. Please, protective equipment before testing this. 

So far after all the [la](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO1B1NWS6pg&t=2s)/[sf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oonU-kRR2XM&t=380s)/[vegas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSrdT7sSKI&t=19s)/san diego group rides I've noticed the thermal throttling effect three times on extremely steep and long hills (and once while I was towing a friend home uphill after dead battery). Mainly this resembles just a sight decrease in speed/power that goes away once the hill ends. Definitely rode the board hard in SF through some crazy hills with no problems. Keep in mind these are fully sealed hub motors, the benefits of this are that no dirt or debris is making its way inside your motor (no rocks to get jammed in the can and throw you :slight_smile:) but it also means no airflow over the windings so a bit more heat buildup should be expected when comparing to unsealed outrunners. Overall I think the heat is well managed and the huge amount of copper in the stator keeps winding resistance low which prevents heat generation in the first place. 

The internal thermistors line up with the default thermistor values expected with 3.xx vesc FW, and I recommend running motor temp limits of 85 C min and 140 max. My testing has shown that with these limits somewhere around 110C the motor current is reduced sufficiently that the motors never exceed 110 while remaining rideable over everything but the steepest of hills. You're unlikely to ever reach these temps in anything except the worst case scenarios. Really should have some data plots to show you guys, I'll do better in the future.

In my opinion, if you are average body weight these hubs will provide tons of power; they will be hot to the touch after a hard ride but the temps are within the design spec of the motor. They are the most powerful hub motors I've had a chance to ride. The only true hub motor that can match power with many of the belt driven designs.  
 

You may think I'm biased since I work with Enertion but these are just my honest experiences with the hubs. Hopefully you guys get some useful info from this post which is potentially too lengthy :smile:

They were surprisingly powerful and looked like they had been very well used. The tyres were flapping about all over the place but held on ok. Looks like the tyres are being addressed though.

Thanks for your input , mine regularly get up to 85c and gets throttled in under 3km, flat ground riding, 95 kilo weight and 1.85m height. I did a test on a 31% hill before and let the motors cool down first to 45c and they went up to 75c in just 1 run (less than 50m) drawing 80 motor amps throughout the run. Also, any idea why even at no load and 0.1-0.2a they get up to 60+c from 25+c? I am thinking maybe my stator lamination’s insulation wasn’t applied properly and is generating a lot of current in the core itself with no where to go and ends up as heat. I also got a small electrical shock when I touched the bearing, motor can and truck together after spinning them for awhile to check for heat and  I’m thinking maybe the voltage built up in the stator core and discharged to me? These are all my theories only as I don’t have my tools with me to open it up and check

http://vedder.se/2014/10/chosing-the-right-bldc-motor-and-battery-setup-for-an-electric-skateboard/

> Let’s look at an example: Suppose an 8 turn motor has one ohm winding resistance. The winding resistance is proportional to the wire area times wire length. Making the same motor with 4 turns would allow twice as thick wire. Since that wire also is half as long, the resistance is four times lower: 0.25ohm. Further, **since current times turns is proportional to torque**, we need twice as high current with 4 turns to produce the same torque as with 8 turns.


> **Copper losses are proportional to the square of the torque produced** by the motor, and at low RPM and high load they are dominant. As RPM increases, other losses start to add up exponentially. In my experience, these losses start to get significant around 60k electrical RPM, which for a 14-pole motor is about 8570 mechanical rpm (most 50mm+ outrunners have 14 poles, some unusual ones have 18). **Because of the square relation, it is desirable to run at as high speed and low torque as possible** as long as we stay below 8.6k RPM. To express the square relation in some numbers, **having double the RPM** and **half the torque** at a certain power output will cause **four times less losses**. The lesson from this is that: make sure the top speed you design the skateboard for is at around 8.6k rpm on the motor if you are using an 50mm-60mm outrunner.

Long story short: If you have no gearing, or even negative gearing (wheel diameter bigger than motor diameter), you need a super torque rich motor. If you have 1:3 gearing your motor can be designed to have 3 times less torque. Such a high RPM and low torque motor has 9 to 10 times less losses (square relation) as a torque rich hub motor of a similar diameter/size.
Since inefficiencies/losses always go 100% into heat, you will get overheating issues. The only way to deal with it is have multiple motors instead of one motor (reduce torque per motor) and try to get the heat away from the motor as good as humanly possible. Combustion engines have the same issue and need a radiator (liquid cooled or air cooling fins). They are only 30% efficient and in consequence 70% the energy stored in your gasoline fuel go into heat and friction. Every time you fuel up your car 2/3 of your cost for fuel is spend on heating the universe.
Electric BLDC motors have the advantage of being nearly 90% efficient if they run at low torque and optimal RPM. In consequence you can use 80 to 90% of the battery stored energy to get you moving forward. 
Only a small bit goes into heat. What we don't want is the need for a radiator as seen in combustion engine cars or bikes. If you need to cool the motor a lot, the system is inefficient by design. The heat is proportional to the losses and you can express that in Watts. The hub design starts get efficient at speeds we will never reach (70+ km/h). In that case wind drag will be your issue since you will need torque to overcome it. 

The only way to build a hub motor that equals a geared system is to make it a lot bigger and give it 6 times the mass.  Since we can't do that due to the size limitations we need to live with the inefficiencies.

If you rev up your motor with no load, you can see the current consumption in VESC-Tool (app or desktop).
There should not be a high Amp flow under no load and the motor should stay relative cool in consequence. If it heats up at low Amp flow already, it will heat up very fast under load.

I get what you are saying, but that’s not the point here. The winding resistance in these motors are impressively low for a 28 pole(sorry 20 pole for the new silver motor) sub 100 kv hub motor so in theory there should not be as much heat as I’m experiencing coming from the windings. Therefore I am very inclined to believe its from something else. If it was friction the motor would have died by now or the part that’s rubbing would have been reduced in size from the hundreds of km I’ve ridden since and not be an issue anymore so these 2 can almost be put aside as causes of the heat so I think the only other major cause would be the stator laminations quality. On the quest for answers I read up a little on the construction of the stator and if the laminations are too thick or the insulation between them are no good the current induced in the core from the windings will be much higher and have no where to go ending up as heat

It's torque output that is the issue. The more torque you produce the hotter the motor will get. There is nothing you can do about that since you can't cheat physics. You can try to cut down torque output by having more motors and you can try to get the heat away from the motor. You can also try to make the motor bigger. That's pretty much all you can do to deal with the issue. There are no other options on the table.

Torque is produced when current runs through the windings right? And heat is generated because of the current runing through wire with resistance right? My friend’s motor with a similar winding resistance do not get hot at all with similar torque output. Heat due to torque also doesn’t explain why the motor would heat up so much even under no load drawing 0.1-0.2 amps for a few minutes

Torque is proportional to 1/(motor kV) . So if you use a 3:1 gear ratio use a 270kV motor, if you are direct drive use a 90 kV motor. The result are more or less the same. The way 90 kV is achieved is adding more poles, so the ERPM ends up being pretty similar. Ultimately all that matters is amount of copper in the stator, quit listing a bunch of   random numbers:

[quote="trampa, post:33, topic:73682"]
give it 6 times the mass
[/quote]

Not even sure where this number is coming from.

Mainly heat issues with hub motor designs are due to the reduced heat being removed from the motor since it is wrapped in urethane and sealed.

Thank you for considering making these available, it's a good business move I think, I'm not exactly a big fan of enertion but I'm here considering these and I have two unities on order so the product is doing the talking.

If and when you sell these "kits" will they be from the new stock? What will the feasible lead time be?

[quote="Deodand, post:41, topic:73682"]
So if you use a 3:1 gear ratio use a 270kV motor, if you are direct drive use a 90 kV motor. The result are more or less the same. The way 90 kV is achieved is adding more poles, so the ERPM ends up being pretty similar. Ultimately all that matters is amount of copper in the stator
[/quote]

The 270 KV motor would run at 3x higher RPM and 3x lower torque output and would generate 9 times less losses. There is a reason why everyone uses gears in applications involving electric motors. Torque output and losses go hand in hand. There is an optimum RPM/torque relation for each motor size.  
Urethane insulation: If you want to compare heat output you need to compare a  Carvon style system with a geared one. Both motors would get quite good cooling and can radiate heat via the can. The carvon style system would still run a lot hotter due to the 3x higher torque output at 3x lower RPM. 

> My testing has shown that with these limits somewhere around 110C the motor current is reduced sufficiently that the motors never exceed 110 while remaining rideable over everything but the steepest of hills.

Please note that you always need temperature headroom for the brakes to work. If you ride with 110°C hot motors and you hit a downhill section with these hot motors you don't want the ESC to cut out power when the motor works as a generator for a longer period of time. You also don't want to overheat the motor further potentially killing the motor and loosing brakes this way.
Benjamin implemented the **acceleration temperature decrease** setting to make sure your motors would have 14% temperature headroom for full brakes. In consequence you can't hit a downhill section with a motor that is hot already. Since BLDC motors have a long term temp limit of a bout 105°C (magnet glue, max temp rating of thermistor and hall sensors) the ESC should cut back power softly at roughly 85°C so that you won't hit the temp limit when you need the brakes to work. 

Reason for the setting: There was an accident reported that happened due to a motor that melted under the long time heat exposure (possibly over months). The rider was very lucky and didn't get hurt. Car pulled out, no brakes... For the safety of the riders Benjamin implemented the **acceleration temperature decrease** setting and set a standard of 14%.

That 15% setting is in place. our thermistor is bonded very closely to the windings. Testing shows the can temperature stays a good bit cooler than the windings, I've tested and will continue testing the thermal settings to ensure safety. 

~~Also your math on the motors is just wrong... I'm really too tired to write it out at the moment. It's my job to know and understand these things intimatley, if you really want you can continue arguing with me and I'll run some simple numbers in the morning to show what your saying is incorrect. For the record gearing can increase efficiency depending on application... the factors of 9x or whatever you're claiming are what's ridiculous.~~

EDIT: I'm an asshole :blush:. Couldn't sleep with numbers bouncing around in my head. So humbling when I behave rudely and then don't even have the decency to be correct. Sorry @trampa. Here is some quick numbers. I'll use the excuse that I'm a bit tired to save some of my ego. Need to learn more respect for guys who have been around longer than me.

Consider the following [motors from t-motor](http://store-en.tmotor.com/goods.php?id=459): 
![image|690x289](upload://raL5EMpEcKfEZ5LUswQMm8H6VUM.jpeg) 

They are the same motor wound differently to have a 135 vs 280 kV rating. For simplicity lets just round 135 to 140 and say one has twice the kV. So lets say we use the 140 kV with 1:1 ratio (hub) and the 280 kV with a 2:1 ratio pulley. We can agree since rpm/volt is double the max speed after the gear ratio between the two is identical. Now an important point is that the motors torque constant varies inversely with kV. That is to say 1 amp in the 280 kV motor will provide half the torque of 1 amps in the 140 kV motor. Assuming a perfect gearbox (reality will be in the  0.7-0.95 range depending on transmission efficiency) then at the output both motors should need about the same amps to generate comparable torque. lets say 20 motor amps for our example. We can calculate motor losses as (winding resistance)*(motor current)^2

For 135 kV 1:1 ratio I calculate losses as: 37.6 Watts
For 280 kV 2:1 ratio without losses I calculate losses as: 9.2 Watts
For 280 kV 2:1 ratio with aggressive 20% losses through gearbox I calculate losses as: 14.4 Watts         

Again sorry my mistake! the last thing I want to do is spread mis-information. Let me know if I made a mistake somewhere. The efficiency will depend on the speed the board is going obviously.

[quote="12meterkuk, post:3, topic:73682"]
On vesc tool the measured resistance of these hubs are 44-48mhom
[/quote]


i've read that the VESC tool estimates 1-phase resistance for FOC calculations (lead to lead divided by 2)... assuming this is true it gives a lead-to-lead (2 phase) resistance of 0.096ohm in BLDC.

80a * 80a * 0.096ohm = **614.4w ohmic heating at full throttle**
^if the vesc tool measures 1 phase, the heating is 614.w at full throttle, assuming 80a motor current limit

80a * 80a * 0.048ohm = **307.2w ohmic heating at full throttle**
^if the vesc tool measures both phases, the heating is 307.2w at full throttle, assuming 80a motor current limit

-----------------------

since we have 2 motors attached to the truck we can calculate the total heating transfer by multiplying this heating x 2:

80a * 80a * 0.096ohm = 614.4w ohmic heating at full throttle
614.4w * 2 motors per truck = **1228.8w heating/loss per truck @ full throttle**

80a * 80a * 0.048ohm = 307.2w ohmic heating at full throttle
307.2w * 2 motors per truck = **614.4w heating/loss per truck @ full throttle**

In your comparison both motors run with matched propellers close to peak efficiency. Even then you have 4x the losses (roughly 37W against 9W). This perfectly matches Benjamin's statement:

> losses are proportional to the square of the torque produced

A hub motor will pretty much always run far off the peak efficiency region though. The efficiency curve has a steep drop which the biggest issue. Less efficiency = more heat.
The hub motor will start to feel comfortable at constant speeds of 35-40mp/h. Then wind drag gets your issue which generates heat again.  Also hot copper wire has a higher resistance which ads to the losses building up. 
Losses generate heat, heat generates higher resistance and higher resistance generates more heat again. 
At a certain point this becomes a viscous circle. The temp rise gets non linear and drifts away. 
In a drone or RC-Plane the motor sees plenty of airflow and the copper stays way cooler. 

We measured the belt drive losses the other day. Roughly 2-5% if adjusted correctly. Straight cut gears will be even better. So losses in the drive train can be overlooked in any valid comparison. Compared to the losses you build up when stripping out the gears the drive train losses are negligible. 

I'm not saying that hubs can't work, don't get me wrong! But the physics behind them are a tough hurdle to take and the system also comes with downsides like wasting battery capacity into access heat.

Which is why I created a thread about 8 months ago explaining exactly that and telling china to simply create larger hub motors with larger stators and more copper and at some point, you'll escape it. Worked for the hummie hub.

Do you happen to know the stator dimensions of the hummie, Carvon and Raptor hubs?  I think the cheap hubs you find on Meepo/WowGo etc are basically the stators from 6380 motors (so 5050 stator dimensions), would be curious to hear what the higher-end solutions are using.

@12meterkuk Just ran the no load test. My hubs definitely warm up after a couple minutes spinning no load. Here is a picture below, just rode into work so the motors started a bit warm (42 C) and after about a minute or a little more they were here: 

![20181107_134241|690x388](upload://cwhbpzHTGBKNDq3KJVypnpZ9n7n.jpeg) 

At no load you can see we are putting about 38 watts into each motor. Since no mechanical work is being done (except into friction) we can be sure all 38 of these watts go into heat. So it isn't particularly surprising they are warming up slowly at max no load speed. Sorry I didn't run the full 5 min pretty sure my coworkers got tired of hearing full blast hubs.

[/quote]

assumptions: 85kv, 39v battery, 95% max duty cycle, 0.096ohm, bldc

39v * 95% duty =  37.05v effective
85 kv * 37.05v = 3149.25rpm no load rpm

the motor has some friction, so i will assume this slows the motor to 3140rpm constant with no other load:

3140rpm / 85rpm/v = 36.94117v back emf voltage produced by the spinning magnets
(37.05v effective - 36.9411v back emf) = 0.1088v "drive" voltage above back emf
0.1088v "drive" voltage / 0.096ohm = 1.13357a motor current
1.13357a motor current * 37.05v effective = **41.99908w** **electrical watts**
1.1335a motor current * 1.1335a motor current * 0.096ohm = **0.12336w ohmic heating**

^the ohmic heating is far lower than the electrical wattage... i suspect this narrows it down to either heat from friction in the bearings, or possibly eddy currents in the stator...

60 / (2 * pi * 85kv) = **0.11234Nm/A** newton meters torque per motor amp
0.11234Nm/A * 1.13357a motor current= **0.12735Nm** newton meters torque
(3140rpm * 2 * pi) / 60 = **328.82003rad/sec** radians per second angular velocity
0.12735Nm * 328.82003rad/sec = **41.87572w** mechanical watts

^the mechanical wattage produced is about 41.87572w watts mechanical (before subtracting internal losses occurring within the motor from bearing friction and eddy currents)

1.13357a motor current * 37.05v effective = **41.99908w** **electrical watts**
41.87572w mechanical watts + 0.12336w ohmic heating = **41.99908w electrical watts**

^the mechanical power production + the ohmic heating losses equals the electrical power consumption

41.87572w mechanical watts / 41.99908w electrical watts = **99.7% electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency**

^ 99.7% of the electrical wattage is converted to mechanical wattage in this no load condition, before accounting for the friction and eddy current losses occuring internally within the motor
