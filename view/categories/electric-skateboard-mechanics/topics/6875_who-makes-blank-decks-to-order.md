For the last few days i been looking for a deck just like this <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/baab5231ebfab9f0140e3da4796138bd12240dd8.png" width="281" height="500">

But instead of drop thru i want it to be top mount and its gotta be 10" along the way (no hour glass shape) and at least 40" long with the double kicks and stiff
Does any one here makes board for sale???
If i dont find one im going with the one in the pics since ima be using 107mm wheels i should have enough clearance, thoughts???

It's also drop through, but I just don't mount them that way.

Here are the specs

It's stiff, and no you shouldn't worry about top mounting on a drop-through deck, works fine. No kicks

@Pablo_702 as @JLabs stated, I make custom decks. I could make that design (without the hourglass shape). I can also do extra thick with a semi enclosure. PM me.

You may also want to consider funbixdist.com (formerly Churchill Manufacturing). Reasonable boards at a rediculously low price. They include free shipping to continental US ... But I don't think they ship outside of North America. :frowning: 

Here's the shop page: http://www.funboxdist.com/store/decks/
