How does this happen? I head an odd noise from the wheel and when I looked down I saw the attached picture. How did that happen?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/9/5985437620277bb1c597cbf7fd469be58d484288.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Well bearings will not last forever. If you don'r lube them and clean em on regular basis they will worn out fast

My buddy did this to me on his boosted.. Didn't clean them...next thing you know we were in a group ride and I was carving 22mph down the street(borrowed the boosted while mine was down) and the rear wheel just rolled passed me...I was really perplexed... Until I realized I was now on a 3 wheel skateboard...

Cleaning and lube should be done every 50-100 miles depending how hard you ride

I use grease now. Lasts a lot longer than oil. Lately I have been using lithium grease in a spray can, just pop the seals an spray the balls lightly... done!

Been using grease, was highly suggested for less maintenance on silverfish. Stayed lubed longer side by side vs oil in a idler (oil bearing seized). Started using grease on all my bearings now. Less roll speed when spinning by hand but can't feel difference when riding, even put it on my push board.

Thanks everyone for the suggestions, if just never seen that before. And your all correct, I have never cleaned them. So if you don't clean them does the heat cause the cap to pop off? My bearings definitely have a steal cover over a soft seal. I'm just curious.

if you don't lube them, the ball bearings start to wear and chunk, causing a lot of friction and even seals to be blown off.

WHAAAAAAT

That must be a joke.  I'd just a s soon replace the bearings every 500 miles than deal with all that.

Guys just spray down your wheels after every ride with water then pat dry Iv been using the same bearings for over 3years on my daily it works. Also for lube use thin bike chain lube with a needle bottle that way you don't need to take everything off.

Sidewalk cracks and rough roads can be hard on bearings.

Just get sealed bearings if you don't want to deal with grease.

What type of bearings were you using? You should get built-in bearings like zealous

Yeah, I saw them but they are Mondo expensive. That with no inner seal is a deal.killer for me.  I stopped using reds for that same reason.

I had Enduro ceramic bearings in my Carvon V2's
They held up really well.
They are double sealed.
@mmaner  
Might be able to get them in 10mm
They are a bit pricey though. 
Over $20 ea.

Even with all the maintenance in the world. Mechanical failures happen. Lithium grease works the best.

For ceramic ball only bearings yes, for full ceramic not sure, I would assume yes
I love these ceramics(balls only)

It takes ten minutes... 

Normally skate bearings are used for hours of skating then maintenance. This turns into about 50-100 miles of pushing. I can ride 100 miles in a few days and I skate hard. So I keep multiple sets. Every 4 or 5 charges I just swap them out. I'll keep swapping for 3 weeks then clean them all at once.

This is for regular lube and keeping your bearings fast. If you want to clean less do what @psychotiller and @chaka  do, use lithium grease, it'll last longer but your bearings won't be quite as fast
