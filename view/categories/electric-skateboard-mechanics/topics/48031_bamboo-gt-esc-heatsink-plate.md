You'll need to modify the plastic case a little bit though. I can't show you pics cause my board's not with me, but it's not much work. FOCBOX's are a little too wide for the case. 

What file do you want?

Sure, send me your e-mail through PM and I'll send it to you.

Also, if you want it for normal VESC's, you can [buy this (not mine).](https://www.zeroformdesign.com/product-page/4-10-twin-vesc-mounting-plate-for-evolve-gt-series-board)
