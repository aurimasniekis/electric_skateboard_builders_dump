Hey yall,
so pretty much i have mad ptsd from my old aluminium motor mounts bending under load from my dual sk8 192kv 6374's.

Now, i'm designing my own mount purely bc why not.

My question is, if the mount is made out of steel, would the magnets of the motors used receive interference from the steel being so close to the magnets? Would it hinder performance?

Hmu with some "yeah i did this and it worked great" pls and thank u

Orrrr you can just get Boardnamics mounts and never worry about shits bending again

I think an old version of idea mount was steel.

I've used steel for a motor plate.. no problems. I painted it and didn't have any issues with magnets.

I am running stainless steel mounts that I made and they run fine with no interference to the motors. I had the same problem. In the end I had 12 mm of aluminium to stop my mounts bending which is ridiculous and now  I run 6 mm stainless which is bulletproof for my commute to and from work.

Also if you are running calibers you can get the @Boardnamics mounts and then mount the stainless plate on to them instead of the aluminium one he provides
