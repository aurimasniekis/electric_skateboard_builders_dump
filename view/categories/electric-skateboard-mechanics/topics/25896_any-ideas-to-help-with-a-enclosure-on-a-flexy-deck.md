So I have a medium flex deck and i'm trying to keep the flex if possible. Is there a way that I can use the enclosure I have with the deck while keeping the flex? Any ideas are welcome 

Here are some pictures of what I am working with<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/e/be259d8f4ff54b566588ffeb1ba0a78d06ad0fc9.JPG" width="669" height="499">

your best bet is to move to a split enclosure so it can flex.  Or segment your batteries and electronics so they can move with the flex.  @trampa has a great how-to for a flex enclosure - intended for mounting electronics under a flexy trampa deck.  BUT totally applicable to your setup with some ingenuity.

Short answer - a stiff enclosure like that (assuming metal) and a flexy deck = failure.  Sooner or later the eyes will widen or something on the enclosure will crack...  if you don't build it to flex properly it'll be a pain.

flex is a pretty big complication for a first build - doable but work.

GL!

I've seen solutions involving the enclosure being screwed on with springs between the deck and enclosure, sort of like a 3d printer bed, but I agree with sl33py that a metal or stiff enclosure like that is not well suited for a flexy board.

for the gaps, you could glue some foam to the bottom of your deck in an outline of the enclosure, that way no dirt or rocks will get in
