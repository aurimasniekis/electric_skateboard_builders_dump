As the title suggests, I've done a load of reading but I just cant find these (other than printed) and I'm sure they exist.

I'm looking for Kegel and Abec push fit pulleys in aluminium with 36 and 40 teeth. Are these made from the same unicorn poo as 15mm steel motor pulleys? It seems so strange that these parts aren't just on every store in the hundreds to me!

I never thought to look there, thank you for this.

Edit: The only issue with these bad boys is that Metroboard don't do anything in half measures and that meaty 18mm pulley laughs at my Caliber 2 trucks.

As today, there are NO SPROCKET WHEEL PULLEYS in the market MADE OUT OF ALUMINUM and produced in MASS QUANTITIES..... NON at all.

@JLabs is releasing Kegel & ABEC type wheel pulleys with sprockets in the coming days. [Metroboard](https://metro-board.com/) sells aluminum wheel pulleys but you are required to shave an internal ring in order to use them with other trucks; still, is a bear to get those pulleys because [Metroboard](https://metro-board.com/shop/pulley-insert-for-abec-11-flywheels/) stubbornly sells them only to [Metroboard](https://metro-board.com/shop/pulley-insert-fMetroboardor-abec-11-flywheels/) previous costumers. [Ollinboards](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/) is the other manufacturer producing aluminum pulleys with sprockets (Kegel/Popoca type hubs) but only for their own [Ollin Revolver Idler Drive](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/single-drive-ollin-revolver) system (single or dual diagonal drives) and not for individual sales.

* @JLabs, fixed ... :point_up_2:

Can you bolt them onto the wheel or is it just a push fit?

I think @JLabs pulleys will be push-fit and two piece. Seems like you can fit either Kegel or ABEC sprockets to which the pulley is also attached, and for example, if you decide to change your pulley size, you detach the 32T pulley and push-fit a new 40T pulley (to the Kegel or ABEC sprocket already in place).
```

## \#14 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2018-07-23T22:24:11.139Z Reads: 212

```
Essentially the exact same thing as Evolve/Enertion push-fit pulleys, except *ALUMINUM* is what the world needs, in 40T - 44T, in at least 15mm width, preferably 17-20mm

You can always make the motor pulley bigger but not smaller -- which is why 36T pulleys are not good

Yeah, the key aspects here are ALUMINUM and PUSH-FIT. Whithout those two critical features in current wheel pulleys systems, we'll be stuck in the mud for a loooonnnggg time.

They don’t require any mods or longer axles, that’s what great about them. They share a longer bearing with the wheel

Sounds really good @JLabs

Im building a board and have caliber II trucks, 85mm cagaumas and want to mount dual 6355 motors. Would your new pulleys be suitable? What do you think the maximum belt width I could run is?

Put me down for two. Is there anywhere I can place a pre sales order?

@Sender @akhlut I’m assuming that means your using surfrodz with extended axles. In that case, couldn’t you use another bearing? 

I will look, but I’m not sure a bearing that size exists.

@brenternet @kiwi_skate for the pulley I don’t want to do any pre-orders. Shouldn’t be too much longer, delivery is scheduled for Wednesday (for some reason the package went to Alaska and not mainland, so it was bumped back another day). 

It should work on standard caliber 2’s with 15mm belts and dual 6354. I want to get them in and test for to 100% confirm.

@thisguyhere the motor pulleys were accidentally left at the forwarder and didn’t make it in the first package. They are all ready on their way with some other little bits. Should be more that 4 days. 

All pulleys will ship Tuesday/Wednesday of next week as I’m waiting on bolts to come in. I accidentally ordered the wrong length. (The motor pulleys should be here by then too)

What is the widest part of an evolve hanger? If you get some measurments of the hanger and axle I will be able to confirm.

@briman05 they are 44t and 32t in the pic

If we preordered back in April we guaranteed how ever many pulleys we preordered in this batch? As I probably won’t be able to get them back on tonight. Also did you send out the codes cause I didn’t get one.

I know this is not ideal, but does anyone here know if 12mm belts will work fine on 15mm wide wheel pulleys and 15mm wide motor pulleys listed here? Would there be too much movement? I'm just trying to avoid having to buy yet another set of belts if I don't absolutely have to.

@JLabs When the preorder went on I had asked you how much for a set of 2 and you had said 60 total so I preordered, but now its almost that for 1 pulley. Dude I cant afford $100 for just my pulleys, my wife already thinks I waste to much money on my hobbies I cant give her more of a reason to be right.

Most likely $60-$65 for 1x pulley, hub, and bearing

Yeah might as well unless the code is not connected to me by name but just a unique code. I know you said everyone’s code was different. Because I don’t think I would be able to use them with my zealous built-ins. Plus I have 2 rings between the hanger and and bearing.

His old were $28 and he had confirmed 60ish for total back when he was talking about this in the pre order. I understand these are different but this was talked about in April when he did the pre order. I’m seeing if the code is tied to my account or just a unique code cause I can sell it to someone and he keeps the money that was used to do these.
