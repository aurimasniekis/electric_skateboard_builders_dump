Casting Wheels seems difficult - but totally worthwhile if done right.

Anyone tried this with success?

Why tho? All the engineering is already done. In my opinion, it would a waste of time and effort unless their is some specific reason for making your own wheels. For example making pulleys easier to mount but this too has already been done.

Treads and Science!

Boston winters are pretty hellish. I rode a Yuneec (expendable) through the snow, sand, and salt and could feel the slippage around corners. I'd like to cast wheels with metal studs or ones that crush a little (airless tire) for better traction.

Thane chemistry is a closely guarded secret by companies.  I figure the casting method starts with an aluminum mold which is treated with a release wax or coating and an ABS core. Then you prepare the epoxy + thane and transfer it to the mold to set.  Assuming I get a decent machine shop to make my mold, I plan to try my hand at science.

Yep.  I can't find any good articles online and I'd hate to look it up in a database before term starts. 

I tried All Terrain wheels (worked reasonably), but they were never meant for eBoards.

@Hummie casts his wheels with BJB enterprises polyurethane. An aluminium mould works but I think you can also use silicone.

I've cast ABS and acrylic with silicone molds without issue - the company you linked is the one I use for water-clear castings for part demos.

@Hummie, does the silicon molding require cleaning up afterwards (lathe trimming due to mold warping)?

I've been casting wheels for robotics for a while now. I used a glass tube as my mould, 3D printed mould base and 3d printed hub.

Prep the moulds with release agent.
Pour the urethane
Vacuum the mould for 20mins
Compress the mould at 40psi for the rest of the cure time (24hrs)

The vacuum gets rid of the bubbles, it's probably not necessary, one can get away with compression alone

Nice wheels Blasto what rubber are you using?
I use "cold pour" stuff,  the big manufacturers use "hot pour" which gives it better qualities but in my experience the bjb stuff in 80 and 90 duro has great performance characteristics and other than it's smell it seems practically as good.  Maybe less rebound but i havent tested.  

I'm moving on from polyurethane to epdm rubber as polyurethane deteriorates with heat from the motors

compression vs vacuum i've wondered about.   I have both and have gotten glass clear castings  using both together, vacuum the resin first, pour, and set in pressure pot.  You'd think the bubbles would expand after the pressure is released as the cured rubber isn't that hard but nope they're gone.  I generally just vacuum resin before the pour though and have a couple bubbles on the surface.  you need a big mold to not overflow the mold if you put the whole thing under vacuum and you have to have had the vacuum made under vacuum as well if you do put it in the vacuum when casting with it

casting wheels like im doing is easy as they dont have a core.  If you have to add a core then there's more complications but polyurethane sticks to polyurethane really well.



try it.  it's time consuming making molds and pouring and you'll want a decent vacuum or pressure pot but once youve got them and get comfortable making the molds it's fun and you can make a lot of stuff. making the mold just right becomes a challenge as you want to avoid air bubbles of course and allow the part to come out and have decent pouring and vent holes and make it pourable so yo dont have to stand there the whole time pouring a trickle:expressionless:

 I also have cast motor mounts directly on hangers I put in the mold and made battery sleds and lately am going to make a silicone bag for a vacuum infusion.  it's fun stuff silicone and all these resins.  smooth-on.com has a lot of great stuff.  Some of it cures lightning fast too and you can whip up a mold and pour it in hours.   

get hard silicone for the molds if youre doing wheels  45 duro minimum.  

the clear polyurethane gasses while curing are much more poisonous and takes a lot longer and harder to get right.

the cost of aluminum molds for wheels is more and if you want a major manufacturer to pour you wheels they require aluminum.  but aluminum is not necessary to pour them yourself.   manufacturer wanted 7000$ for them to make me 100 aluminum molds that they would pour.  100 is their minimum.  then they'd be 4.35$ each wheel.

I have spare wheels(80A duro) with 69mm diameter and was thinking I could cast 10-15mm extra 75A duro urethan surface (depending on tube diameter). Would it hold? I could make some holes or just gash surface of 69mm wheels for better adhere.

My first post here. Hope I can contribute something useful.

I wanted larger wheels and did cast 115mm wheels that glued to my original 90mm wheels. Only have had few rides so far, but they work well.![wheels|690x388](upload://nt1QM7PRTvJehDC3DhfKBYrAau4.jpg)

I 3d printed sacrificial mould and used  Xencast PX90 Hard Flexible Polyurethane Casting Resin.

Key here is to pour in the resin, let it set for 60min and take the mould apart with pliers. Do not leave it for too long or it will be hard to remove the mould.

I left it harden for few days and glued to my original wheels. The bonding surface is quite large, so it should hold (I hope!)

Oh yes, that's great!  
 
Xencast works with 2-part silicone, in my quick test with aged silicone. That is you can made detailed mould and don't worry about getting small details stuck in there. Mould with seprataed walls althou two part silicone can be flexed to rid the mould of negative surface part  
  
Adding reinforcing fibers would be nice as well to support small details. Maybe even metal powder as 'hard' abrasive resistant element

Goal is a AT PU sleeve for a landwheel drive based on my front MBS AT wheels. 
I already did one first try "Pi mal Daumen / pi times thumb :smiley:" which came out unusable but I learned a lot of it about silicone and PU handling. One big thing was centering. This time I used a M8 screw used for first centering and holding the Original wheel and then for the cast holding and centering the sleeve. 
Now its time to wait for the results but I'm pretty optimistic. I can't wait to cast the second one so I can test it on the board :)
edit: And yes, I just casted the new PU on top of the original one, before I did that I used the dremel to cut it in different shapes so the new PU would get really good contact. In the first try it turned out to bond impressively.

edit: Here is my first try:

that's a good question, so far it looks good but I didn't drive much with them. the two I already casted are not well centred and thus vibrate a lot.  funny thing: when I drive rough roads the new sleeves are way better but on good ones it vibrates like hell (my glasses shake :smiley:)

No major wobble on rotation, no. When spinning the motors its almost as silent as with the original PU. I'll try them on the road later today :) The left wheel (right one on picture) I cut away a little bit too much making it a bit irregular but it should work anyhow :)

Oh, its not that urgent, whenever you have time/access :D I'm overwhelmed by their choice of materials and I'm not so much into it. Some time ago I read from your posts of your pu experiment to use 80A for hubs and also that the stuff I use is inferior to the one from bjb :) But i had to try it anyways since I have no use for a whole container of that  (Its deteriorating quite fast afaik). @Pylonflyer Could you convince your boss to sell small amounts of that good pu? I got a one kilo set from smooth-on, thats about the size I can use. I won't ever produce the sleeves in a bigger scale ;)

Next run:

First I had to get rid of the PU from the last bad try which was a fight :D (which is good)

![SAM_2339|690x460](upload://3TJmOQecuv4VJrUoP8FoCkBlDQO.jpeg)

Then the sleeves had to be carved a bit. The removal showed the importance of this so I did even more carving with the dremel

I cleaned them with warm water and put them on the heater to dry
 ![SAM_2343|690x460](upload://sJSBAxBbUkUS0omJdYWUCS5K3BR.jpeg)

The mold and the centering hubs were sprayed with silicone spray for easier removal (dont know the exact term)

Have you tried applying a bit of baby powder to the mold? It's meant to help reduce surface tension, to stop bubbles forming.

not yet, haven't heard/read about it yet, will check, thanks :) My result will never be perfect, for that I'll need a vacuum chamber but maybe that baby powder will help a bit more. So far I'm already happy with the result but it won't hurt either :D

If u heat the resin a bit it will be thinner and less likely to hold bubbles. Stirring without adding air I bet I could get close to vacuum results.  I’ll use a very thin layer vasaline as mold release or coconut oil.

The upper side is a bit ugly but you can file it easily for a nicer shape. The wobble is totally gone as far as i can tell already :)

We do sell smaller quart kits but shipping to Germany is expensive.  Just for reference, Hummie used F-190 and M-3190 for wheels.  F is faster gel time, M is a Medium gel time.  If you aren’t in a hurry, M-3190 is safer for newbies.  With any urethane, it’s best to give them some heat after demolding for the best durability and abrasion resistance.  He used a 90A because after they heat up on hub motors they soften up.  But 80A is fine too, especially if you are making thicker wheels.

We're also casting our own eskate wheels and looking for feedback.  70D core that then has a 80A tread cast over it.  Having some trouble releasing hard core from hard tooling, 3D printed.  Tread tooling is also 3D printed but releases easier from flexible material it seems.  Next iteration is adding draft to the core tooling to improve this. Compatible with both ABEC and Kegel drive patterns.

@visnu777 But the mold @Pylonflyer made will be hard to get the tire out unless maybe with an air compressor.   I think he said next time he’d do it with the center and outside on different halves of the mold to get it out easier.  I did molds that way and would add a lot of mold release so the tire would get stuck only to the inner part.  I did molds for the same tire also with Half the mold center n outside on both halves of the mold. So split in middle, leaves a bit of flashing in center but comes off easily and if u do a good mold even better. Even then it can be hard to get out. 

I made my molds by sitting the print on a one inch brick in the big cylinder with sealed bottom. (Oatmeal tube n tape).  Melted coconut oil and filling up to half way up the tire, it solidifies, then pour the first mold half on top (the bottom of the mold). Melt the oil off and then pour the second half w some wax sticks for pour n airhole. Make the holes big to get the resin in quickly. I used a small hand vacuum to suck the resin in even with big holes.   and make a reservoir or even a sheet of acrylic taped into a cone like pylonflyer did.  Better if u have an attached reservoir if u suck it in.  and there’s silicone glue and u could build a reservoir , or u could pour a reservoir on top of the mold directly with wax walls.

Yup, I would change my mold shown above to have the inner part (where you see the splines) attached to the lid so it pulls out first and then the wheel would slide out much easier with a blast of compressed air.  The wheels still came out reasonably well but it took a little extra time with all the extra surface area on the inside and outside walls.  Since there are no draft angles on a wheel, you just try and reduce surface area contact.  We did a video on how to approach 3D Printed molds recently.  I would love to see what your molds turned out like, too!  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAOemKxSXyk

Having said all that, silicone molds are still my favorite option for making less than 20-30 parts IMHO.  Just use stiffer silicone and take a little extra time setting it up so it doesn't fight you later when you're demolding parts.

I got it wrong! Somehow, because I was traveling and only glanced I thought you had casted(overlaid) PU over MBS...doh

This is nice work and it’s great like @brenternet said the meshing of ideas with pics, really helps anyone wanting to make thane, thanks

Great mod for old hubs

I wonder if a 10mm ‘sleeve’ would stay on a MBS casted directly with no glue, or maybe even a light layer of adhesive put on a new MBS, instant 123mm?
