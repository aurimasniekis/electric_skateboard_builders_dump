any motor mount/truck should fit 107 abecs, given you have enough board clearance.

I think the crux on these is the pulley wheel insert.  Since the wheels are so wide people usually cut/sand then down

search the forum for 107 and you will find threads covering this

I have them mounted on Caliber II with enertion mounts and psychotiller mounts

I tried this awhile back, they are no longer responsive or in business.  They would not take paypal payment, and the phone goes to a voicemail server that you can leave messages but not responded to so not useful

Yes, you are right, there are threads on 3d printed wheel pulleys that are necessary and there is a thread on cutting wheels back 7-9mm to the bevel.  The problem is the width of wheel, with centerset core bearings, is too wide for most truck hangers and threaded axels.  I have also used them on psychotiller wide trucks ($25/set) and dart tracker 219mm trucks.

I seem to find the wheels do come up from time to time. Stores don't seem to stock to many sets at one time. One store told me he had a set that sat unsold for months. 
I'm currently working on my second build with these wheels. My first build I've used Torqueboard 15mm wheel pulley and motor mount. Unfortunately, he doesn't sell either of them any more. Because of the off set of the wheel, the mount has to move inward quite a bit. For the wheel pulley I had a spacer made up so that the pulley sat flush with the wheel.

For my second build, I ended up using trucks from Psychotiller and a custom motor mount. The mount is similar to TB newest mount. I needed something custom to mount the 8072 motor. Also a wheel spacer has to be made up. 
Either way there is really no pulley or motor mount that will work without some mods. I'm sure you are aware that there are printable wheels pulleys that you can get made.

Thank you for all the time you took to make these pulley i seen them before and always wondered where i can have them printed locally and whats the best material to made them off??? I know using these monster wheels will present some challenges but im up for them, still need to find the wheels tho, @chaka do you have these yet?

Actually those are @psychotiller trucks that I used as well, very wide and $25/pair deal. The interesting thing about that second build is the custom motor mount and motor pulley it appears. @cdn can you tell us anything more about that, as looks awesome and would like to replicate along with the wheel spacers.

Everything had to be custom made to make use of these wheels. The motor mount is identical in design with TB mount, other than its size being larger. The larger mount was needed for the larger motor. The mount is made from 7075 grade aluminum. It was made the DIY way using a Dremel, drill, belt sander, tap and die set. Both the wheel pulley and motor pulley were sourced from Ebay. The wheel pulley did have to be modified in order for it to work. The motor pulley needed no mods. Pulley  ratio 40:24. 

There was some modification done to the trucks to make the mount work. The little triangle portion on the truck had to be removed. The mounts open portion where it clamps around the truck sits on part of the truck casting that allows for it to not rotate when clamped down. Hope that makes sense. 

I'm really curious to see how this larger motor works out. Its rated at 4200W. Visually I think this motor pairs well with the Abec 107's. This motor is so much more beefier than anything everybody is currently using.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/c/1c8c4b06dbba4321cd1e47859ffa55d16800e51f.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/f/bfb828c864a85ba6cbae6f11c6f10ade76503a24.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/0/f04fcf779dcd56f058eba427ad5ccd554ca3a316.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/c/0c7e0f22833038d7bbdcda187f8652e914071c0b.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/a/ea7cc7b5495e6e7687051cbf9fb8fbd2b3601d57.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/0/80f06e50f5a891b40602d8f8cbf8e1bf315b28e5.jpg" width="640" height="428"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/0/800838daff79a411c59ed55c8c18425fc3b94000.jpg" width="640" height="428">

Are you able to get the pink 107mm ABEC 11s, I can not seem to source them anywhere now that they are not part of the 2016 ABEC offerings.  Only found a used set on ebay that were pretty bad shape.

Hi chaka,
Is it possible to spec a Ollinboard freeride with 107s?  For whatever the cost add, it seems like being able to get a little more clearance over rocks or cracks would be worth it.  If necessary for clearance I'd be down to go with Liquid precision trucks @200mm.  Not sure if existing pulley/mount design allows it.

As long as you are located within the US we can set you up with a FreeRide with 107's but we may need a little more time before delivery due to changes in the gear ratio. Need to reduce the the drive pulley motor side to accommodate the larger circumference of the wheels. 

@caustin I'll have a pre-order listing up soon, in a day or two. I have had an endless influx of questions about our new drive so it will save us sometime if we can direct people to a listing with all the details we are comfortable releasing at this time. Expect a full release of specs and options within 2 weeks. 

A few things to considering when choosing our drive.

1. Our drive is designed specifically for our motors, not all motors will fit. In time we will have a more universal design but we are focused on this specific dual motor configuration at this time.

2. Mounts only fit trucks machined to match the hanger diameter of our drive trains,  trucks need to machined to match and will be available separately and in a package form. There is no "universal" sleeve. In our experience this is the only way to have a solid reliable drive train. 

Feel free to message me if you have any questions!
