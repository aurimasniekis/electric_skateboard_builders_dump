Been trying to figure out a way to make a dual set up with the Ollin motors.  The first hurdle was to find an adjustable mount to fit the motor since it wasnt a normal 30mm.  The second was to either find a RKP truck long enough for both motors or an extension for regular trucks.  I couldnt find a RPK long enough, I even tried contacting Quinny to see if I could purchase the truck they used for their longboard stroller hybrid - nothing.  Then I looked for extensions and I could get 4 for 100+ dollars - nope.  I decided to make my own extension with a grade 5 1" threaded coupler and 2.5" stainless bolt  cut down to 2".  I used a cheap 184 truck to experiment with until my caliber comes in.  I threaded the shaft to the aluminum and cut the shaft to .5" and used red loctite to join coupler to shaft.  I had to file out my caliber mount to fit the cheap truck so I could see if it would fit and it worked great.

I made them.  I am starting to sell them them for 45.00 with free shipping in US.  Should have  a limited amount in a little over a week I am ordering more tomorrow for a few people PM me if you want one, no obligation, someone will buy if you dont want it.  Read the "Interest for Ollin motor mount OM5065-200" thread for pics and more details.

those mounts are gorgeous! That's a very elegant design. They look similar to something i was thinking about trying to cut out with my xcarve.

Still not sure how you did this ?

You slid  original Axle out first ,then threaded ends of hanger for the coupler ??

Yes! The Ollin motors are great!!  I am sure one would work just fine but 2 is always better.

No, this was just proof of concept with cheap trucks I had laying around.  I am waiting for my calibers to come in and I will do the same process.  The coupler and the bolt are harder than the shaft so hopefully it should be good.

I'm concerned about the practicality of this concept.  This appears to be a great way to take an already super wide set of trucks and make them even wider, resulting in an atrocious turning radius.

Wouldn't it be more practical to simply place them on opposite sides of the truck?  Or to use a taller riser and offset their center points so they can overlap a bit without touching?  Or even running longer belts on one than the other to offset them the other direction.

dual diagonal would probably be the cleanest option other than what he did here. 

I actually called Caliber and asked them about custom truck hangers a couple months ago. I was told they don't do that.

Those were the first trucks I looked at but for some reason I think I need RKP for turning something this wide.

I bought them about a year and a half ago from http://www.funboxdist.com/ they say 190mm on the site but they are 184mm.  I bought them for about 20.00 but they have gone up to 26.00 I think.

Just found the time to cut up my calibers and make a real dual Ollin 50xx powerhouse.  Still need to find a deck to put it on  I dont want to keep changing out my other board with the hubs. Hopefully the coupler holds up and the wheels dont fall off.  These are the motor mounts I have been making- just so happens I broke off a couple taps in the holes so I decided to use them for my self. Ill keep you posted

Hope does the coupler work? Did you swap out a shorter axle or just cut and rethread?

lol, second pic from the top of the thread shows the coupler screwed onto the truck  and a bolt laying next to it.  The coupler  and the bolt are grade 5 so it should be ok, We'll see.  Will definitely use thread lock on all parts.

Does the bearing sit on the coupler? Or how does that work?

The bearing sits on the non threaded part of the bolt. I had to use a 2.5" bolt and cut it down to get a big enough space that wasn't threaded for the bearings.

Don't have the enclosure yet, hopefully its in process shortly.  All the electronics are programmed and transmission is in place.  I had to take it for a spin at the office to see how the Ollin sensored 50mm motors run. Since it is near Halloween I wrapped it in electrical tape to keep the guts in and disguised it as a mummy. DAMN, sooth as butta.

They are holding up well so far. Still no enclosure so everything is just strapped to the board. I have it at work since that is where I mostly work in it.   I have had about 10 people ride it around ranging from 150lbs to 250lbs with no issues yet. Once I get the enclosure I will start riding it to work.

This longer truck solution is very interesting. I have the same motors and have been looking for a hanger at least 215mm wide. But this might be one way to get there. How is the progress of the enclosure going?

@Kaden56 is making it for me but am working around his school schedule, I have a few littles and they take up most of my time so I am not in any hurry.  He already made me an enclosure for one of my other builds and it turned out great - just havent had a chance to post pictures yet.

We head down to St George in just 4 more days and the new molds will be underway! I'm excited to see how they turn out. I have a brand new high quality flat endmill bit on its way right now that I'll get to use on it. Just a couple maintance things to take care of on the CNC first so I don't have another disaster.

I bought the couplers at home depot just to try out the concept but it is holding up well.  There are other couplers on the internet that have thicker walls and will probably upgrade eventually.  The motors are super powerful, I am about a buck fifty and they push me up hills with out slowing down at all.  I may try them on a hybrid board I am messing around with  trampa short deck and MBS matrix II trucks, still looking for wheels and working on a mount.

The mold is sitting here on my counter ready to go! Spring break is over after today so I'm back to school tomorrow and will vacuum the enclosures and send them out this week. Can't wait to see your board with an enclosure. You have some serious skills in designing these things. I like this one even more than the last.

That's great!!!! Thanks @Kaden56. I started another board (I think I have a problem) it's a hybrid mountainboard/ carve board. Using a trampa  short deck with MBS trucks and  113 razor gokart wheels. I haven't figured out what to do about the enclosure yet but I'll let you know. 

Thanks again

@korryh Is this setup still working for you? I'm curious about whether or not you upgraded the parts or just ran with what you set up initially. How's she running?
