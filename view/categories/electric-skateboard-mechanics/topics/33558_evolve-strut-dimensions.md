Does anyone happen to have the CAD for the evolve GT trucks? Or at the very least, the struts? I am machining my own motor mount for a set of Evolve gen3 trucks, and I need to know the placement of the 3 mounting holes in the circles that are welded to the struts. Perhaps someone that owns this board might be able to measure this and get it to me? I need the center-center distance from the mounting circle to the 3 holes in the mounting circle. 

Thanks!

I got the Trucks. I can take the measures for you.

I'm interested in the dimensions of the axle width and the hanger width if it would be possible for you to measure them. ðŸ˜‰
