as far as noise goes, read up on FOC vs BLDC, FOC is pretty quiet. If you want torque you generally go with belt because the ability to play with gear reduction can get you a good balance of speed and torque.

the 10s4p and dual 190kv motorS will get you the 20mph and 12 mile range you seek, I tend to roughly calculate 5-6 miles per P group. Use http://calc.esk8.it to figure out what you would get.
