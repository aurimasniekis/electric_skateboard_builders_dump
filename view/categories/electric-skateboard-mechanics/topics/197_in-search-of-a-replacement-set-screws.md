@onloop Can you let me know the set screw sizes and types for your motor mount kits because I've lost every one including the set screw for the motor pulley? That's what I get for not putting on thread lock.

@longhairedboy would these work as well because the ones you posted are from China I think.

HAHA! this happens to everyone the first time they ride their self built electric skateboard!... literally my motor was dragging on the ground because all the motors screws feel out of my first rig...


pulleys are M4 x 5mm socket set screw
motors are M4 x 10mm button head screw
