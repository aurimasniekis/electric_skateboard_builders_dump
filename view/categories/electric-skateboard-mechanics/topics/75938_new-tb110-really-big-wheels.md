I have been testing some new @torqueboards wheels lately and the latest version of them is really kicking my ass.  So out with the words, and in with the photos.

Gorgeous :heart:

This contact patch takes railroad tracks and potholes like a CHAMP

![20181028_223623|690x345](upload://jxVqKLDcYXRNKqewETcJb995WeK.jpeg) 

No chunks
![20180919_183826|690x345](upload://gwFIj73D2znH6uDKwALDv5gpF24.jpeg) 

These are massive
![20180902_174617_HDR|690x345](upload://cI6r7Edw6zzxiWA1m9Vd0sKExtv.jpeg) 

So I've been riding these for a few months now and I can't imagine why anyone would want pneumatics.  These soft monsters deliver a plush ride with the range-extending efficiency of DEEP premium polyurethane.  You can squeeze these in your hand.  They seem to be about a 74A - ish the way they feel to me.  I don't have a shore durometer, so I'm not for certain.  They're definitely a much better ride than SuperFly and they have a stronger, smaller core which allows for even deeper polyurethane.

Beautiful

wash me, please
![20181125_020312%20(copy)|479x500](upload://fDaAFvCmralaIL5HkVNNpCbrGq9.jpeg) 


***YES, PLEASE*** :heart: they are screaming to be ridden :smirk:

If you have any questions, hit me up folks.

More information is [available from the manufacturer](https://bit.ly/2TTR5jY)

My understanding was that lighter wheels give more range, is it correct?
So is these are as heavy as nummies, the range should be equal?
```

## \#3 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2018-11-25T09:12:59.516Z Reads: 678

```
The range is affected mainly by the rolling resistance and these will go further than pneumatics with everything else being the same.  An 80mm 82A wheel will go further than these will, but your legs will be toasted before you get there.&ZeroWidthSpace;

The wheel weight technically does affect range but realistically it affects it so little that it basically doesn't affect it.

Website says they're 75A, but that the durometer may change in production. Pre-purchase price is $110, projected availability in February 2019. I'm tempted, but I think I'll stick with my 97mm 74a ReFlys. I prefer the reduced weight.

They feel similar, but I like the ride of these better.  I did not weigh either one, but there [is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wcrCWDrO-0&t=42) of someone weighing the older wheels.

You are correct.  100mm Constrictors and 90mm Hatchlings. One of which may not work on TB's direct drive, the other will scrape by ok most likely i hope.

This is about 20m after a puddle and you can see the forces on the wheels when they are halfway dry.

My pollution addiction is satisfied by the following activities:

2. Hiding fully charged lipos in dumpsters

I swear I would never buy wheels that are $100+

But I always wanted to try good, bigger wheels than my 83mm (from diyelectric too actually). And the fact that they are cheaper than the final price is really tempting. @torqueboards would be cool to have 40T Kegel pulleys with those wheels. Also those new pulleys https:///collections/drive-wheel-pulleys/products/36t-kegel-drive-wheel-pulley-12mm are they still metal? They look like plastic.

They are softer than the Boa wheels and more plush.  These wheels are big.  They are very big.  They're wide enough and tall enough and soft enough to give a nice ride while still not having the battery-gobbling range-appetite of pneumatics.  They're great, really.

The Boa wheels are really good and the TB wheels are really good.  I think it just depends what size range you're looking for.  These TB110 are as close as you can get to pneumatics without losing all the range and without adding extra failure modes (eg: flat tires).

These wheels are my new go-to wheel once they are available.

Weird, out of left field question. 

Do you think these would handle the wear and tear as a wheel on a 1:5 helacial gear setup? 

I'm really looking to have a urethane option for my board, but I have to make sure the wheel is worthy (sorry to doubt Dexter, I just think it's alot to ask of a soft urethane wheel).

What do you think?

And tbf with such a high ratio and "small" wheels I would be turning the settings down... So... If that impacts your answer... 😂😂. 

Thanks for the help 🙏🙏🙏

These cores are super-strong.  I don't think you're going to break the cores.  If that's what you're asking.  I'd much rather do something like that on this or a Boa wheel than on other very popular brands with spoked cores.  The wheel will definitely break traction before anything breaks.  Definitely.

Who are you talking about?  Because if it's Kegel, that sounds like facebook marketing jive designed not to be truthful, but only to keep the cash flowing since they don't offer any options past 85mm.

The kegel-style core is very, very strong.  I've never had a loose bearing seat in a kegel core.  Additionally, making the core bigger for a bigger wheel might certainly *lower the cost* but at the expense of polyurethane depth.  This TB110 wheel has deep polyurethane -- and at 31mm deep, it's unmatched by any other wheel on the market.  Sure, increasing the core size would lower the production cost but I don't think it would make a better longboard wheel.  The kegel-style Labeda core is extremely strong.  It's much stronger than spoked cores.

Yes, they don't want you to be able to change their wheels.  They want you vendorlocked.  This has nothing to do with which wheel core is better at riding on the road, and everything to do with which wheel core steers the most money their direction.

Thats not what they have said to me, they said they have been evaluating it and they do not think the core is strong enough for bigger wheels.  I could pull a quote.

Ive been here for nearly 2 years, built a few things and been hanging around a bit.  Your attitude isnt conducive to good debate guys. Calling out fake news, bullshit snake oil or conman because someone goes against the hive mind is a bit shit.

Edit, and yes they will bring out their own pulley.  The only way they could vendor lock you is by building the pulley into the wheel so I dont think its that

A claim that hasn't even happened or not even a single known issue. Isn't really a debate either.

Personally, I see no issue with a kegel core for a 110mm wheel and/if not even larger. Any issues, we'll give you a brand new set + your money back.

I guess, eventually we'll find out what the real motive is behind why they said that.

The real truth is that the little kegel core gives you more room for that ***deep, bouncy 'thane***.  The deeper, the better.  The bouncier, the better.

And it doesn't come with a side-order of "vendorlock".  Just solid, tested longboard wheels specifically designed for the electric type.

Im really not sure where this vendorlocking is coming from - if they pulley isnt part of the core how are you vendorlocked? You can design a pulley for any core.  I call fake news, bullshit, snake oil conman on your vendorlocking claims.

With both Ollin Popocas at 90mm and Boas at 100, I've never heard of a core braking nor urethane separating. 90mm isn't much more that 85 and I suppose there aren't too many Boas out there but I haven't heard of issues.

I guess we'll see how the 110mm tb wheels do with even more 'thane than Loaded says is suitable. While I don't think it will be an issue only time and abuse will tell.

The core used by Labeda is made with a 30% DuPont Glass Nylon injection mould. We’ve got a lot of Boa wheels out there on customer boards and have been working on our wheel development for over 3 years. 

The way Labeda bond the core to the wheel is extremely strong and we’ve never had a single wheel delaminate from the core coming out of a production tool.

Currently I can only find [36T](https:///collections/drive-wheel-pulleys/products/36t-kegel-drive-wheel-pulley-12mm) in your webshop, which is a bit small for 110mm wheels. 40T would be nice, 44T even better. (I can see you have 40T for ABEC but not for Kegel.)

I had to sell my foam core cf Chicago longboards dh board for bills back in the day. Thankfully paid $130 and got $250 after they went out business due to rarity and .... Not many people got their hands on the CLB foam core...

Oh man I miss that thing. Compared to Maple, it was like riding on a cloud, all the same minus the deck itself- pure ... Pure sex... Vibration dampening, torsional stiffness, solid platform, 3 ply maple.... 

We got a few good weeks of that green superfood shit... When you don't have money for bills but spend all the money you have on pointlessly overpriced organic food and other health related bullshit for 10x the price...

@torqueboards - I have the torque board dual motor kit (mounts pulleys etc 218 trucks) 16t motor with the Allen key bolts and 36t wheel pulley ... mounted inward.. currently running inward with with 265mm belts if I want to run the 110 mm will I be able to get them to fit with simply different belts? What length would you recommend? 280? 300? I am running dual 6374 Tb motors .. there isn’t much clearance currently with the 97mm to the motor pulley about 4mm.. any suggestions?

@Balth81 Yeah, you would be able to fit it. You just need longer belts. We'll confirm the belt size soon once we test it. To gain added clearance, you just need to extend the belt size so that's not really an issue.

We should get the new 110s sometime the upcoming week!

 Maybe I misunderstood or asked my question wrong but I wasn’t curious about belts or pulleys and I thought you were testing the 110s…? Was that not the case because I was wondering how that testing was going and if we’re looking like this week or next for shipping on them with the direct drives…?  Or is March still going to happen even? @torqueboards

@Balth81 Yes, 280mm belt is correct for 16/36 with clearance on 110mm wheels for a normal motor mount.

@Jansen - We've already been testing the 110s. 110s we should be getting this week so for delivery we're looking at about the end of the week or early next week. As for the direct drive, we're looking at shipping out within a week or two. Finalizing everything as we speak. :smile:

My set came and I was trying some BKB pulleys and they don't seem to press in right?

There very loose and slide right out?

The cores holes seem to very in tightness each one is a little looser then the other.

looks the same I experience with popoca. I have popoca from last summer, tight fit with classic pulleys No the new batch from this months have the holes way bigger. They need 5.8mm spoke diameter to be tight fit. Try to press the pulley from the other side, the front of the wheels, if that works is the same as popoca. Do not know what happened with kegel core from China.

@yelnats8j - Front and rear side of these kegel cores are different. They aren't exactly symmetrical on both sides.

I do also know that I've received other similar kegel type cores with the actual wheel core flipped. I'm assuming it's someone at the warehouse that doesn't know the difference. If that is the case, I'd just swap the wheel and use the pulley on a different wheel.

Non ESK8 wise, it wouldn't matter if the core is flipped. So the bad one use for front wheels non-motorized wheels. Seems like a very small mistake but it does happen. I'll make sure to mention it next time around.

This is also separate from the press fit but kinda similar if your press fit pulleys don't fit the same over the wheels.

@torqueboards my first set, all 4 are all loose on the back side, snug from the front. The pulley insert I'm playing with, has a lot of play in rotation inserted in the rear (lol sounds naughty). No play inserted on the side with the print. Doesn't seem like they'll work with existing pulleys that don't clamp with screws.

If you look into the spoke holes, you can see some lines, what looks like a bit of flashing, on the tight side. So it's easy to see visually, without testing with a pulley.

@torqueboards i have seen the same happened with Popoca. Since the Kegel core is not symmetrical, the last batch of wheels go the core randomly installed in the other direction having the normal front side with bigger holes, about 5.8mm, at the rear side. Normally Kegel pulleys have 5.4mm spoke diameter that snug fit in the wheels. Would you correct that in future batch or you can not control on which side of the Kegel core is used at the rear side? Maybe something changed at the production level and they didn't notice that, but it's definitely present.

I think that the problem can easy be solved by heat shrink the 5.4mm spokes to reach the slightly bigger diameter of the other side. 

Thanks!

EDIT: I am not talking about wheels/core integrity. That won't be affect at all, just pulley wise.

yeh I can imagine that such a small detail is quite a pain in ass for you that orders so many wheels. If would it be in the other way round, people could just drill slightly bigger holes to fit the bigger spoke. In this case I think the best temporary solution is bolted pulley or heat shrink. Since the other side is smaller the heat shrink won't slide off form the front side.

core flipped
[/quote]

I checked 2 sets of TB110 and 2 sets of popocas, all mine are aligned the same way. The front holes are narrower than the rear holes. There's a step where they meet, shown in photos above, that's even narrower. Sounds like fatboy is dimensioned for the narrow side and everyone else for the wide side. Maybe the general solution for a good fit is to make the pulley spokes for the wide side, and drill out the holes in the core... Although I don't know if drill bits come in fine enough steps. But as long as it's not clicking back and forth it's tight enough, right?

I actually don't have any spoked kegel pulleys onhand. I'm working with @rey8801 on his adapters. @torqueboards I'm gonna keep dicking around a bit more and try to figure things out. I'll contact via email if it's not working out.

I _do_ have the TB DD on order, and am concerned about the fit there.

Thanks for checking it out. So either TB spokes are thicker, or they're long enough to engage the narrowest part.

I do think heatshrink could work, and the narrow ring (weld line? flashing?) will hold it in place.

I see. Well then it's weird that most of the kegel pulley I saw they use the narrow holes as reference and not because they are long enough to contact the other side. 
For instance BKB pulleys showed by @yelnats8j are like that. I do not think they were not tested deeply before make it. Something changed, before the narrow holes where at the back.

So... actually I just tested again about 20 wheels and it does look like this batch might have the cores flipped. So large end is on the inside wheel side.

Future batches will most definetly be narrow side on the inside. I've even designed my pulleys in this way.

So unfortunately.. the fix would be using heatshrink to seal that added gap if you are using a press-fit pulley.

I'll let the manufacturer know that way they don't f' shit up for anyone else. lol The standard should be narrow inside.

I'll fill anyone in if things happen to change but so far that's the assumption.

The @3DServisas pulleys I have, the prongs are 5.6mm diameter and 19.5mm long.  If they were smaller or shorter, they would not fit.  As they are, they fit great.

On the regular cores with the narrow part to the inside, they are very, very tight and you really need to use a 7/32" drill first.  But on the reversed core they fit perfectly

Ok so for anyone using BKB pulleys with the TB110s you must use shrink wrap.

Works like a charm and super easy no need to switch it out with new wheels.

5.6mm will fit the other side of the cores also, but it's very tight and needs to be hit to go inside ;-)

Depends, on your voltage / motor kv / motor pulley and need for speed. So who is to say?   

If I went from a 18t motor pulley to a 15t motor pulley my top speed would be the same as it is now on 92mm wheels according to the calculator. Or 10kph faster if I stay with 18t / 36t. Not really decided yet on ratio but it seems not too bad. I have 140kv motors. 

36t will give lots of clearance for my quality of "roads".

Under normal circumstances with 180Kv - 200Kv motors and 10S - 12S voltages, 36T is [not enough](https://calc.) for 110mm wheels.  It's totally usable though.  40T and higher is better.

Well max speed would be around 65km/h, so assuming you don't plan on going that fast that's a lot of wasted efficiency, torque and money. I would guess that a 6355 with more adequate gearing would be just as good if not outperform.

@BruSkater Yeah, they fit perfect. We use a longer leg on our adapters so no issue there.

Our ABEC pulley fits perfectly for ABEC clones but it's a bit tight for the ABEC Originals. The fix is you want to drill an M6 Bolt through the core inserts on the original abec wheels and it will fit a lot easier for our ABEC Adapters.

These say 78A on them, but with the depth and quality of the 'thane, they feel closer to 74A.  They feel nothing like the china flywheel clones.  These are first-rate premium wheels.

Thanks guys! I meant belt and not pulley, sorry about that. I'll try to get a 280mm belt. I believe the one I have is 265mm.

The grub screw idea is really neat too! But I don't like having the wheel that close to the motor pulley, if anything gets loose or something gets caught in there, it'll end with my face on the ground.

You'll want a larger belt, not necessarily a smaller pulley. I had to put 280's on, replacing my 265's when I moved from my Caguamas to 107's. For my 20T gears, I'll be sporting 195mm belts. I'm using the latest @torqueboards mounts and 16Tx36T

Bigger diameter wheels means a lower gearing ratio gives you the same torque curve as something like a 100mm wheel.

Each revolution of the wheel covers more ground distance when the diameter of the wheel is larger.

I understand how gearing works what i dont understand is why you would say 40T+ only. It sounded like you were insinuating that a lower tooth count had some type of weakness because of size. If its just an opinion about torque feel then you underestimate my board 36t on 107s on my set up is almost too much torque to handle. 32T will lessen the torque a bit and give me the top end i want because i do like to ride fast.

I ride my 107s with 15/32, 10S... Maybe the 10S is key here, any more than 32T and it's too slow. Torque is greeeat with 15/32. I used to run 20/32 until the aluminum pulleys wore out. I think 18/32 would be my ideal ratio... At 10S at least.

As @Battosaii said, contact patch...

I am pretty sure the kegel core is smaller too, which... 

someone tell me if they agree, but I feel like the 110mm wheels are noticably (significantly) softer feeling ride than 74A 107mm flywheels, I am guessing because of the smaller core/more urethane between core and road.

It does have a weakness, in that you can always increase the motor pulley size in order to adjust the ratio, but often you can't reduce the number of teeth, and also larger tooth counts are less prone to skipping.  So 40T wheel pulley puts you the middle of the adjustability zone instead of on one extreme end of it.  It is objectively "better", even if you use it at the same gearing ratio.

Not a good enough reason to just blatently say one gear ratio is perfect for everyone and every board. Whats good for you is not good for me. Ive been running abecs with 38-29t and soon ill try out a 23t wheel pulley. For me 32t is a sweet spot on my 4wd lots of torque and decent top speed.

In fact ive used my 6 shooters with 16/42t gear ratio on 4wd and it still pulls my fat ass up a dirt hill with ease, i had traction problems on steep inclines on grass at the park but dirt and gravel np!

Either way 40t would not work for me because i want to stay on the board when i touch the throttle.

I gave multiple good reasons, the only reasons you gave are specific to you.  You are trolling.

For 97mm wheels, MOST PEOPLE should probably use 36T and for 110mm wheels, MOST PEOPLE should probably use 40T pulley.

Really Big Wheels. Yes. 

I can confirm all mine have the large holes on the inside / pulley side. They start at 6.2mm then taper down to 5.5 ish somewhere near the front.

I am frantically trying to design a pulley to print so I can ride these ASAP. 6900 bearing setup for surfrodz.

I assumed it was due to the motor can being hot and the water cooling them rapidly was annoying as had to stop ride early .. was thinking if the mudguards would help keep the water off the motors or not haha mine are mounted underneath..

@torqueboards thanks Dexter for the haul can’t wait to ride on the new wheels sadly your 6374 motors betrayed me again yesterday and threw another magnet retainer ring mid commute had to get an Uber to the office.. I have stripped the motor down and fixed the loose magnets and used ring and used some loctite 648 to glue back in place. Hopefully stays put this time  makes me sad having to do walk of shame carrying the board busted .. I know flipsky had similar issues but have updated their design I am wondering if you have done similar? 

Wheel comparison is tb97mm vs new 110’s chalk and cheese difference between them.. really can’t wait to ride them. ![image|375x500](upload://oIEoarHhAM2fPDpHpzBzFt1M7Z4.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jnpzOO59xOWFhaekf3AW3zvACWu.jpeg)

Soft and smooth obviously. My knees and feet are happier. 

Much much more grip especially over high frequency bumps like blind person tiles or man hole covers. There is one spot on my commute where I am turning at medium speed and have to go over the blind person tiles mid corner, I used to loose all traction and do a little drift mid corner. But these still have some grip and not much vibration makes it though to the deck. :+1:

I feel much safer with the additional grip.

This is the corner in question, where before I would get zero traction on the blind person bumps and drift mid corner. Now there is still some traction available over the bumps. 

The blind person tiles are in the direction of travel and it's quite off camber. I come from the road turning heel side. The road is smooth and down hill so I can hit this corner as fast as I want, but its also blind into potential pedestrians, so I go like half speed. 

![IMG_3178|374x500](upload://hwzN4BhTsOX2gz9BvtqnJUcvbB9.jpeg)

While I do feel safer having much more available traction I feel there is at least one situation where it could be more dangerous. 

Since you have much more traction in general you can go around corners a lot faster, but if your mid corner and you hit an unexpected patch of sand or other slippery surface condition your going to go from lots a traction to none very fast.  

So I would advise people to be carefull with the extra grip and watch out for changing road conditions, especially around corners where you can't really see until your there.

Yes I did and have been using it, so far works perfectly. 

The spacing is designed around 6009 bearings that fit 10mm axles, they are 6mm wide as opposed to 608 bearings that are 7mm wide. See the red spacer is 5mm, if you changed that for a 4mm spacer is should still work for 608 bearings. 

Also the prongs fit the larger inside kegel holes of this batch of wheels. 

Its 39 tooth also, and for 15mm belts. Although I plan to make a 40t and 42t version when I get some time.

I hope it turns out well, mine are printed on a SLA printer with a material they just call "rigid". It's designed without any printer tolerance so you might have issue if the material has shrinkage. I think most of the geometry is quite simple for printing though so it's probably only the bearing seat that might come out tight.

I went to test ride mine for the first time today (belts arrived). I like them a lot. I could ride with a decent level of comfort even over the surface that would turn my board into a vibrator with the MBS 100 wheels that I used before. Thanks to @Idea for making really big 48T pulleys for me. The 15:48 gear ratio works well for me with 190 kV motors. Plenty of torque and still enough speed.

Def something weird going on with your printer. It’s weird that the print quality looks good but it it’s not concentric from top to bottom. Maybe one axis is loosing steps over time? Normally it’s easy to see lost steps if it happens suddenly. 

Can you try printing a simple large cylinder to see if x and y are in proportion?

It actually came out pretty good now to make a 32t version.

The model looks good.  I printed one just to check fitment and was truly impressed with how solid the fit is.  I'm curious how you settled on 39 teeth?

[/quote]

Honestly don't remember why, I recycled the tooth pattern from pulley I designed almost 2 years ago. I think maybe it was just to get a nice belt fitment with a setup I had back then. 

I can adjust the amount of teeth in CAD its just I wanted to get these wheels on the road as fast as possible so it was quicker to just use the size I had already.  

I think I want to do a 42t version for some more torque.

Weird i printed a 100% infill PETG pulley last night and the print came out okay but it was weaker then my PLA 20% infill pulleys. I had a layer seperation during the bearing install. It may have been because i printed with no supports this time. Im having a hard time sticking PETG support to the bed but the print it self sticks fine

Thinking of trying a raft to help stick supports.

I find slowing down first layer a *lot* helps with petg. Like 10mm/s if I'm having trouble, via front panel live adjust.

And supports are really hard to remove with petg. Maybe it's just slic3r's supports...

Im going to try a raft this time, i started a print with a brim and the outside supports were printing fine but the inside supports for the bearing seat wont stick to even sanded and alchohol cleaned blue paintera tape. I guess the supports are very delicate in assuming a raft will solve my problem. For now ill ride my PLA pullies till they break or deform. So far so good.

No ETA yet but working on it. Quickest and easiest fix for any typical kegel adapter would just be to add 5.5/6mm heatshrink on the ends of the 10 legs on the kegel adapters. That should make any kegel adapter fit if it's standard or a flipped core.

My pulley exploded and fully locked up the wheel. I had to walk back home. Luckily I was just fooling around down the street not too far away. I was riding off the gutter a few times in a row then on one lading this happened. 

This is one down side of SLA printed parts, they can be quite brittle. 

So I ordered some @dickyho pulleys, will see how they go.

Does the kegel core not have protrusions for the urethane to grip to like with most other cores? For example flywheels have extra core in the middle: ![flywheel%20core|500x500](upload://5hgFXNDL9M9C80UNggux5gDP1Z0.jpeg)  and although on my 97's there's more than 26mm of urethane from the observable core on the outside to the edge, it's adverteised as 26mm deep urethane.

After a few weeks using these wheels I want to give a more in depth review. 

First is I love these wheels, there is no going back. 

**I found only couple downsides**
-  Wheel bite will probably be an issue with most peoples setups that will need some tuning to eliminate. Unless you have a board that can fit pneumatics then you will be fine. 
- While they will smooth out almost all bumpy terrain there is one case where its quite harsh, if you hit a line where two pavements meet and its wide enough to hit booth wheels it can be very jarring. I think its more noticeable as its like smooth smooth smooth BAM. Where as with smaller harder wheels its more average, bam bam BAM bam. I think this is the only use case where pneumatics would be better other than offroad. 
- Not really a downside but the soft compound does not take well to doing burnouts, leaves lines in the direction of travel quite easily. 

**Ok onto the things that are good.** 
- Plush ride.
- Lots of grip.
- Lots of grip on bumpy surfaces like, manhole covers, blind person tiles, concrete that is worn to almost rubble. 
- They look cool, they have a motor sport like look. 
- I have had less nails and screws getting embedded in the wheels which I find counter intuitive being so large and soft. 
- I now enjoy going over manhole covers.
- Lite offroading is possible. 
- My feet and knees are not sore very often.

**Things that are a bit weird.** 
- The compound when worn has a texture that is almost like foam RC racing tires even though its not foam. Makes them **look** soft.
- If you spin up the wheel on the bench you can see the outer edge expand from centrifugal force. 
- I have had several regular people comment on the wheels saying they are really big. Hahah. 
- One of my wheels has a small bubble on the edge of the core, and it always blows of the dust around it in a circle, which looks really strange. I had a dream about it, but in the dream the air bubble was like 60% the volume of the wheel.

Very happy to hear about how grippy they are, I've only ridden pneumatic (not expecting the same traction ofcourse). These are my first thane wheels sense I was a kid and had a longboard.

I've also noticed that on worn/bumpy/rubble concrete, these differ a whole lot from Superfly. These stick a lot more. That's one of the main differences I've noticed, along with railroad crossings, these are a lot better.

My theory on this is that due to the offset core and the extra width the wheels are very flexible at the outer edge as the edge is really far from the core. This allows them to conform to small irregular shapes and provides a lot more grip on these type of surfaces.

I second @lrdesigns comments.. the wheels have been going good for me done maybe 2-300km on them now and taken them up to 64km/h they handle beautifully compared to other thane.. still a little slippery on the blind circles of death at speed but otherwise no issues at all... just took delivery of some 40t pulleys from @Kug3lis at 3DServisas’s which I have to say are some of the best machined esk8 products I have seen to date can’t wait to give them a go when my new belts arrive! Not to mention they were quite reasonably priced for a pair including shipping to Australia. Thanks @Kug3lis ![image|666x500](upload://i2kHyaGbeqh5FLKjOdXpIpi7zFH.jpeg)

But if center set they would not fit standard kegel pulleys, it would be a new standard. So I think you made the right choice.

Just to confirm, they'll work with

 Surfrodz 200mm 10mm axles 
and
TB110 Wheels?

what wheel bearing will I need, or do you have it to ship w/the order?

Because the cores were accidentally flipped you will need to put heatshrink on the prongs that go into the wheel hub. @yelnats8j did this

You will need an extra 10x22x6 bearing (just like you put in the wheel) for each hub. The included extended bearing is only suitable for 8mm axles.

Works perfect on Surf Rodz, you just need 10mm ID bearings to fit the 10mm axles.

Does anyone have a 3D model of the TB110? I'm about to develop a custom pulley with an internal bearing that rides on the hanger. I'd like an accurate model of the TB110 before I go and model it myself.

I think you can use the BOA cad model since the core is the same. You can enlarge a bit the wheels to get 110 but not really need it for the pulley

@DEEIF Not as much of an issue but of course always better if they are correct and not reverse. You can add some heatshrink to the kegel legs and you should be good.

16/36 is a bit aggressive gearing for these. You get a lot of speed but torque won't be great. I'm running mine with 15/48. That's on a 10p battery. I can easily go 40 km/h and could push it even higher (50-55 km/h) if I increased my ERPM limit.

Nice build, thanks for the reply.. do you think my build will still climb hills without a problem, and range won't be taken away much from these wheels? I've been building this thing for awhile, and I'm looking into a different wheel set for more ground clearance from the motors.. I currently have 90mm wheels, so I guess my question is.. is it worth doing the swap, even if I stick with that gearing? my goal is 35-40 mph with a range of 20-25 miles.. my motor kv is 190

You should be fine. If you don't end up liking the 36T or you want a bit more torque, you can always run a 36/14. We also have 40T/44T as well.

90mm to 110mm is a huge difference as far as comfort. If you prefer the comfort the switch is better. You'll be able to power through most things when riding and/or not feel it.
