Is this a good option for an all-terrain/off-road setup?

There's definitely better stuff out there but it's great for the price and will get you rolling.

Plus Duckyho is here on the forum and can help you with any problems or questions you might have. there's also a big thread on those wheels and or kit I'm sure.
