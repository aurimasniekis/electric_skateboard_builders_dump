I had these in the past from @Kaly but he's outta stock ATM. What are my other options here.... I'm also not completely married to the 40t... just need something that will PRESS INTO an Abec hub. Don't want a blot through setup.

Anyone got any data on using 3 total bearings vs 2 per wheel side? 

2 would be less friction but wonder if spreading the load really is a big thing too....

I think the new flywheels are so far sideset that it would not make a big difference. Use dual motors, idlers, loose belt, then the load is not a problem compared to your own weight on the wheel imho.
