Hey guys! 
I have just ordered a set of the skike wheels and now I am figuring out a way to power my board to get at least 40 km/h out of it using dual 250kv sensorless motors. I am using 10S battery so nominal RPMs of the motor are roughly 9000. I created this thread because the information about these wheels and such is scattered all over the forum. 
I am shooting for a decent tourque and the 40 km/h with this. People have done 35 km/h using 190kv but single motor so it should be doable. :) 
I hope that there is someone who can help me or something.
Thanks in advance
