I just saw the email about these and now it has me very curious. I just ordered a new set of 97mm Flywheels from the Ollin Board website. However, I'd like to have an all black look on my Raptor V1. If these new Evolve wheels are just as good, I'd consider cancelling my current order for the Flywheels and getting the new Evolve wheels. Thoughts?
