Says it all up there ^^^ -> what 3d printers are being used by folks to do stuff?
And how much are they being used?

A Delta type Rep-Rap, based on this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:318745 (Mini Kossel VSlot) with a different extruder (bowden, E3D v6). 

I will have it me again soon because I moved in a bigger flat, yay.
The last photo I have of it was a bit unfortunate lol, at least that "room" was soundproof and fumes-proof (even if I print mostly PLA) because it had an extractor ^^.

The Delta/Kossel model it's a bit tricky as first printer, as first one maybe I recommend something simpler like the Prusa or a Wallace/Printrbot-based  or a Bukito3D which is pretty advanced even if it's tiny. But a Delta type it's totally worth it because it can print at high speed and the printing head can be very light (just the extruder), so if you're willing to spend a bit more time for understanding the calibration it's totally worth it.

I don't use mine much for esk8 parts, but I know ppl that have used their printers to make motor mounts and such (even though I find making a plastic motor mount EXTREAMLY dangerous) I personally have a PB Metal Plus Dual, PB LC v2, Kossel Mini, LittleRP (not a good part printer, just for resin models), and also an X Carve for CNC work.

might as well check in here, i guess.
i use a heavily modified mini kossel although i'm almost done buying parts to upgrade its size to a 250mm diameter 270mm high build volume. 
Looking into setting up an enclosure and setting up a heated enclosure system using one of those cheap personal ceramic heaters off amazon.

endgoal is to be able to print functional parts out of nylon (specifically taulmann bridge), that stuff is frighteningly strong and with thick enough parts, i bet it could make really good motor mounts + pulleys with strength and wear resistance comparable to machined aluminum, at least for eskate applications

Ordered an Ender 3 and some upgrades and filament.

Got everything in today but the printer it self and the glass bed I ordered. 
![20190330_162937|374x500](upload://6MaJ4l7qKFkyJ3KTXKoYJDwiMhA.jpeg) 

I was going to use the regular red PLA to test and print random stuff and I got Polymaker Polymax filament for printing usable pulleys, I know Polymax is very strong but not sure how it will handle the friction of a belt constantly turning it. What material do you guys print pulleys from? I want to do Nylon or Nylon-X printed pulleys but I'd need to mod my ender 3 alot more to be able to do that.

Nice that looks perfect, Nylon-X is basicly the same but instead of glass fiber reinforcement it has carbon fiber reinforcement.

Problem is I'm going to need an enclosure and to mod my printer quite a bit to be able to print nylon successfully.

Nylon is tricky with it being so hydroscopic. Consider getting a dehydrator to dry it out. If you see steam coming out of the nozzle you need to dry it. Only takes a few hours for it to absorb enough moisture from the air to effect your print.

Also, it sticks to almost nothing so get some garolite g10 and use that as your print surface. That should give you enough stick to stop the part from warping. You can just stick a trash bag over the Ender during the print to retain heat.

If your going with glass or carbon fiber nylonX it will be more ridged but you should not print that with a brass nozzle. If you have e3d you can get the new NozzleX nozzle a print whatever you want.
```

```
Second the sentiment nylon is tricky to print with and takes quite a bit of effort.  I've used PVA Glue aka Elmers Glue and works incredibly well at holding the nylon part to the bed, but then the trouble is getting the part to release from the PVA glue.  Just a drop will do and then can spread with water, the PVA is water soluable so you'd think you could just soak the whole glass bed and have the part pop off but the water seems to have a hard time getting under the part I always found myself prying and soaking it at the same time to get any part free after using the glue.

I printed a motor pulley with regular nylon no extra reinforcement and it worked fine for about a month or two and then started to deform so I went back to my metal one.  For my wheel pulley I've been using a home made one but used a 3d printed model to make a mold using silicone then poured in resin for some much stronger solid plastic and it's been holding up just fine.

I've used

Wanhao i3
Anet a8
Ultimaker 2
Ender 3

And I would take the ender 3 over all of those printers above. The ultimaker is terrible, I could write a book about how they should improve and for the price of one ultimaker I can probably buy around 10 ender 3s

Look at PEI sheets, you won't need slurry and adhesion issues are null for the most part. 

The best thing about my lulzbot is the auto bed leveling. I think there's an upgrade for the anet and ender lines.

Within the last year I got a prusa i3 mk3 kit and used it to upgrade my old mk1 clone machine part of that upgrade process I added a bl-touch sensor (auto-level), modifying my x-axis to hold it on there was the "hardest" part really but honestly wasn't that hard just took me forever to convince myself to do it.  The bed leveling is a huge feature for sure, very rarely need to restart a print because of issues of the first layer not sticking because of things not being perfectly level

Also upgrade my old machine frame from acrylic to aluminum extrusion (and controller) so really the motors are basically the only original part on it :)

https://photos.app.goo.gl/TrT1T7S2VkuJRDhu9

^^ old machine after upgrade, printed many parts from prusa site for the x-axis gantry/z-axis, ordered some custom length metal parts from misumi (expensive but they'll do whatever you want for a price) and using an Anet A8 all metal frame upgrade kit, mine wasn't an anet a8 in the first place but close enough.

I have a BL touch kit coming in just waiting for that. Its just weird how it was easy to level the bed properly and now its very difficult. Makes me think something else is wrong like a warped bed. Glass should be relatively flat so ill try leveling on that surface.

Edit my problems all started after removing a few larger very stuck prints just by pulling up on the magnetic bed i may have caused it my self.

We need a thread on those who are willing to offer their 3D print services to others here with location and rough price estimates. 3D hub prices seems a bit steep these days. I remember them being much cheaper 4 years ago when I used them.


I had a tiny cheap "M3D" printer for little stuff before esk8. It didn't have a heated bed and only used PLA. it eventually broke and I sold it for parts, never got another one. Still on the to-do list, but really wanted an enclosed system that I'll leave/use in the garage

Instead of the stepper being mounted directly against the metal frame your printer and resonating/amplifying the noise, the dampener separates your stepper with a rubbery part in between.

The all metal is going to give you problem with Bowden setup if you use retractions. It will jam. 

I upgraded my ender 3 with $50 BGM+e3dv6 all metal direct drive setup(for printing nylon). Works like a charm. 0.2mm retractions. Less retractions make it really fast too. Direct drive is perfect for flexibles too because less filament between extruder and nozzle and also straight path.

If anyone else is interested, you need just 3 things for making a direct drive all metal upgrade.

I also designed a very compact bracket that keeps the nozzle almost at the old position.

I've been interested in moving to a direct drive system. Whenever you're free, pm me whatever links you found useful for your setup please! Bookmarked these links :grin:

Same here on my cr10s - makes a night and day difference.   Swap the driver chips out for TMC2130 too and you basically have a silent printer.

Yeah, will work exactly the same in cr-10. No firmware update. Just needs a different esteps. I changed it in the front console. The thermocouple provided is also the same.

Don’t think there is any ideal do-it-all printer although some come close 

You need direct drive for TPU really, a bowden is no good.

Best to have 2 or 3 printers, just like esk8 😁

I don’t have any experience with them but I believe there is now direct drive with a flex shaft now, light weight head speed of a Bowden but able to print tpu.

Got my octo print set up and BL touch installed and flashed the firm ware on the main board. No more constantly checking and adjusting bed level between prints.

I do notice a bit more noise from the printer. Nothing too crazy but must be from the z axis motors moving alot more often to compensate for the uneven surface.

What slicer and retraction settings are you using? Maybe it’s retracting a lot?

Cura allows control over very finite settings including not retracting if within N mm. Highly recommend, there is a plug-in which allows directly printing to 

Sounds like Z hop, which is used sometimes during retracting.. again configurable

Relocated my maketgear m2 to a smaller locker so my climate and humidity control didn't have to work as hard. Still need to seal the edges of the door and reroute the climate control tubes.
