I cant think of a way to get more clearance because my enclosure is pretty thick..
Could i just mount the truck on the bottom part without damaging it too much?
The deck is landyachtz 9to5...cool deck..
I just cant finish the build and im super pissed at this :rage: but hopefully i will enjoj it and not just rage on it and throw it in the sea

Yeah you can just top mount it like you said. Lots of people do this, myself included

Put it in a box and send it here, I'll throw it in the sea for you ;-)

You'll have to top mount it. I just had to buy a new deck after carefully gripping my drop through deck because I wasn't going to have room D:
