Like the title says, need to know the accurate spacing of the holes for both sizes for a mount I'm designing. 
I haven't been able to find a decent diagram of this so far.
Turnigy 63** series seems to have two sets of mounting holes, is that correct?
Thanks

this diagram has the mounting pattern. I seem to remember 2 mounting patterns on mine so I will have to check tomorrow https://hobbyking.com/media/file/s/k/sk3-6364_dt5035-14p_motor_edited_.pdf
