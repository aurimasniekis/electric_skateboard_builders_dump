There is no keyway slot on Keda motor so you don't use it or you need to make one. To secure pulley on the shaft you need to use a file and create a flat spot(s) on the shaft for a grub screw(s). Or/and use some Loctite 6xx to secure it. Also Keda motors have really short shaft, I wouldn't go for 15mm, depending on the motor mount you will have half a pulley sticking out...

Iv'e bought it, I understand i must file a flat spot for key, But what key will work?
```

You have the terms mixed up. You don't file a flat spot for key but for grub screw. You don't use a key because there is not slot for it on the shaft.
```

I can Create it,

But that Black thing "Key" I do not have,

So is there a second method Or that is the only way?
```

## \#11 Posted by: SilentException Posted at: 2018-01-16T09:59:02.639Z Reads: 152

I already gave you the other way. Flat spots and grub screws + Loctite. Or only Loctite.

For the key, if you can create the slot: products/motor-keyway

My point is : i have some motors with a keyway but some motor pulley with 1 grub screw and no keyway. 
Should i use the combo red loctite + grub screw locked into the shaft ?

There are holes/treads in the pulley you put the grub screw in and fix it to a shaft on the flat spot you filed.

The grub screw should be on the shaft where you've filled the flat. I put the pulley in this orientation because of the short shaft on your motor.

jesus chrust dude. there aren‚Äôt tutorials on where to put a grub screw cause it‚Äôs supposed to be common knowledge...

you really need to learn to use logic to figure these things out. ‚Äúhmmm, this has a thread, so does this hole, maybe i‚Äôll try to screw it in there.‚Äù  instead of making a brand new topic...

you really piss me off dude.  if you can‚Äôt figure where to thread a screw into you should stop building your board. when you enter this hobby, most people assume you have some basic knowledge of how things work. we‚Äôre not here to replace your school. 

next time you have a question, don‚Äôt make a new topic,

If you can't figure out how to put to a screw in a thread you really shouldn't be building your own board. Imagine when it comes to batteries jesus christ, I expect explosions. I'd read and educate myself on some basic knowledge before touching any part of an eskate if I were you.
