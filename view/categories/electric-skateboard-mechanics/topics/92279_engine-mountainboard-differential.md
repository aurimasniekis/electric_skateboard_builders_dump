I know this is a electric board forum, but I thought that you guys would be smart enough anyways to answer this as y'all are geniuses. I want to build a mountainboard with a 59ish cc engine. I would have the chain go down into a sort of axel to power both wheels (I don't want a "one wheel drive" mountainboard), but the problem is then both wheels would always be spinning the same speed constantly, and decrease maneuverability and wear down the tires faster. I almost need a sort of differential system... anyone got ideas for a solution?

I think your best bet is to find a gokart differential axle kit and modify it to fit the board. You will likely need to be able to fabricate metal plates to mount stuff, and probably need a welder

the easier solution is twin engine, one for each wheel.

If you're wanting to solely use it in very off-road conditions, 4WD's employ diff lockers. Maybe you don't need a differential? Unless you're on asphalt.

I have no idea how strong this is, but a go cart diff would be pretty heavy for a skate. +1 for the solid rear axle if all it's going to see is dirt. Two motors would be tough to set up with synched throttle linkage, otherwise two throttles, haha

Why would you use fossil fuels?

If you absolutely must, then only use the fossil fuels to run a generator, and use an electric drivetrain.

I get you're b264 and this is what you do, but that's literally even more inefficient and therefore has an even greater carbon footprint.

Nah, because it allows for easier full electrification once the dirty engine has a malfunction.

Plus, the performance will be twice as good.

or you could just repair the generator instead of throwing it out and wasting all the production and resources that went into building it? 

The only reason you commented on this thread was to troll some guy about his choice of motor on his MTB. If you don't have anything useful to say, why bother?

I thought my idea was very good and innovative, as we've seen no hybrid builds.  I asked a legitimate question on the puzzling choice to use fossil fuels and suggested an innovative way to use them and get more performance.

***You*** are just trolling ***me***.

using "fossil fuels" has many advantages - mainly its much cheaper. Also, it will travel much further, and if I need to fill it up, I can just stop at a gas station and put a dollar into it. Those are the main reasons.

Its not actually cheaper. The the board price is slightly more, but electricity to charge the entire battery is 5-25 cents at most. You also cant use it on sidewalks or most bike trails anymore if its gas powered.

Alot of it is personal preference, but i can link thr basic drivetrain.

Motor mount upgrade if you can afford it and dont mind dealing with diyeboard for 1 item
http://www.diyeboard.com/all-terrian-motor-mounts-for-dual-belt-motors-p-711.html

If you can afford to buy any sort of chain drive 200x50mm wheels, you will be better off. Belt works, but chain is better for an mtb.

Honestly, the best motors are turnigy sk3 6374 149kv with a sensor added if you want. Go with the flipsky dual vesc 6, its high current which you very much need on an mtb. The battery should be able to output 100 or more amps and be atleast 10ah minimum on 10s or 12s. I would shoot for closer to 15 or 20 if you can afford it

Some people claim these trucks are no good , but they just need dampers and a proper mount angle and they perform no different than trampa/mbs ones, they are just a little but heavier

I don't have much finalized, but here is the jist. I still need the small parts such as throttle cable, chain, clutch, etc, but that'll totally maybe add 100$. The parts I list here is a total of 540$, so yeah, its a little more than 500, but not much.

Sorry I actually lied and sent the wrong one. I sent my electric varient. The motor one would be a 100$ harbor freight engine which is a total of 370$, so add 100$ and you do have just under 500$

To get back to the actual question OP had,
The closest thing I've seen to  suitable differential is a 1:5 scale RC car differential: **https://tinyurl.com/y49ycxtq**
There's a guy on insta somewhere that built an axle for something like this: https://www.instagram.com/p/BSK-XYAhejN/
Gas engine build would be cool to see, not really very practical since you couldn't ride it most places without at least catching a lot of really dirty looks. But man o man do I love the smell of a two stroke.

Do you think a rc car diff. would be strong enough? The engine torque wouldn't pull it apart?

with the right diff and research its doable

https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2221742-The-remote-piloted-rickshaw-an-art-car-for-Burning-Man

Pictures to this build thread are sadly missing, but he talks about pulling 2 people in a cart.
Sounds strong, not sure how it'll  deal with large acceleration.

Or I don't know how you can use two different chains to link up the front axle an the rear axle then you'll have four wheel drive. Or find a way to just link up the front left an the rear right

Instead of all the trouble making the board like that, why not make a 3 wheel board? Normal wheels up front and 1 powered wheel at the back thats wider and bigger diameter. You could just buy a single tire off a diy powersports site that already has a sprocket and brake disk attached for dirt cheap.

Your best bet is an adult tricycle differential, it even comes with sprockets.

A clutch and differential aren't the same thing, though I may use something similar to the for the clutch... but it may have a few issues because it has to deal with incredible amounts of torque.
