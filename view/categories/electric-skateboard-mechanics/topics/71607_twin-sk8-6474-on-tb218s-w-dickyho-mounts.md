Why don't you get the 6374s from @torqueboards, they will fit on the 218mm tb hangers

i like the look of the sk8 better and they're a higher wattage
edit: it's also about $100 more for me in Australia

I've got dual 6364 SK8 with dickys long mounts and his 15mm pulleys, lemme grab a photo for ya when I'm home, doubt there is room for 6374 considering the length of the SK8s

cheers mate preciate it
it does say that the 74 is 80.7mm with the nipple thing at the end so if you could do some measuring that'd be great :metal:

Few things to note about this setup
- this is only a mock setup as I don't have the hardware for a full setup (currently running single motor)
-these are the 6364
-the wheels are spaced out are far out on the axle as I feel safe doing, with the nut being placed on backwards (nylon first)
-there is obviously room for error with the placement for things
-there is roughly 12mm in the middle
-the big belt is 15mm, the small one is 9mm, will be running 15mm on both once I get second ESC

Edit: it can't really be seen from the photo, but I have measured just the motor and not the mount, it's also a cheap caliper so give room for error with the measurement

Don't recommend using the dicky wheel pulleys unless you feel like grinding down or cutting the hangar

@kalebludlow so you rekon size wise it would fit all properly? it sorta looks like it would?
@dareno did a build with twin 6374s so i dont know

This is simply personal opinion, but I think if you used 12mm belts, and moved everything a bit closer than I have, then it probably would. I could move the motor pulleys up a couple mm

hmmmm okay. with that size motor i'd wanna go 15mm though so i guess imma just wing it and hope for the best? :joy: i think it'll be a squeeze but with enough spacing between the trucks and wheel (a bearing or a washer or 2) it should be just fine. gonna probs order the motors next week :crossed_fingers:

Thats why I decided to go with 6364, at least I know its gonna fit with a little bit of wiggle room

Can you do me a favour and measure between the mounts at their furthest setting on the hanger?  I'll measure mine and compare.  I don't have the sk8 on tb's anymore but I do have the set up that used to have them still at the same distance apart.

Mine have almost no axle through the nut and the distance between the mounts is 172mm  The motors had about 3-4mm between them.

Its not near you then?  Inside measurement from plate to plate.

@mynamesmatt do you have the mounts and trucks?
```

i will have the trucks next week. i've got the mounts so i'm just hanging out for the trucks. If push comes to shove i'll just yin yang the motors on the rear truck, but i'm hoping this won't be the case.

just make sure the nylon is fully engaged in the nyloc nut and all good.  When you go to set the mounts up give me a shout and if I can help I will.  Good luck.

would a picture straight from the side would be posible? I'm interested in motor / deck end clearance when mounting in reverse.

The mount is adjustable so you can have as much or as little clearance as you want

That measurement is without nipple.
With nipple it's about 89mm

Not sure if this will help but I measured it again with the tb mounts and its actually 178mm between mounts with little or no clearance between the motors as you can see.  If you can achieve that distance then the motors will work. Thats with the mounts pushed as far as I could without losing enough axle for the wheels with 15mm belts.  Tight as a ducks arse it is.

So you've got spacers on the axle right?
```

## \#27 Posted by: dareno Posted at: 2018-10-23T22:17:15.744Z Reads: 105

```
I use a standard spacer and another bearing although its doing no bearing activity it just worked out to be the right size.  I've since dismantled some old ones and used the inner core as a spacer

Hey dude.  How did you get the dickyho mounts on the TB trucks. Did you have to grind the trucks or part of the mounts?  I can't get a fit... Thanks

pretty easily. with the truck clamp thingo, wedge the nose of a set of long nose pliers into em and pry them open so that they slide over the truck. With the motor plate, do this
![20181023_175057|375x500](upload://gx3TCC9tQvzcfpUrKG0ju8faiPm.jpeg)

bolt goes through the threaded part, then with a nut on the inside with a coin to press against. thread this to pry the mount open, and over the expanded truck clamp. once over the clamp, take the bolt and all out, then reinsert bolt so that it starts tightening around the clamp. it will take shape by itself
