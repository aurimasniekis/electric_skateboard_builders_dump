So currently making a new board, and i never knew what the distance from the deck to the motor should be? I always just sat it so it would be at the end of my baseplate but could i go lower?

I need as much space i can get due to smaller wheels and big motor.

For me it was trial and error. The distance really depends on your bushings. Try different heights and get on the board and lean all the way in either direction

Oh okay so no smart way to do it, just did my old one with trial and error yet it was still so low the motor broke and was really poor looking after first ride.
