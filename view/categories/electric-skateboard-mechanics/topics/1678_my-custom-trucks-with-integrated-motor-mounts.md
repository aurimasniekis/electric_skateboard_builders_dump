So while i was building my 3rd board i realized that i canÂ´t fit two 5065 in 180mm paris clones.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5a7a0bdc283ff7ba3492fbf5580fb8dc9b25d2ca.png" width="383" height="500">
I just got these from my water cutter. the hanger part is 15mm aircraft grade aluminium and its raw weight is 360grm. while mounts are softer 10mm piece-i-found-on-the-trash aluminium. Mounts weight 130grm each but they will be milled to 5mm except the part where they will be screwed on the hanger. i think mounts will stay on with just two M4 and quality glue. im still not sure do i use press fit on the axles on threads with glue.

just weld or bolt screw all the mounts on to the extenders . i think i might just do that . have a set of GullWing SideWinders 180mm . wont change or tamper the original trucks .

https://www.silverfishlongboarding.com/forum/surf-rodz/103519-surf-rodz-extension-axles.html


only found these in web . maybe you'll find more from your site .
i was thinking of buying some few pieces of nuts and screws the same size as the truck's threads and make myself my OWN axle extenders

because my trial and error styled creating work, i realized that motor holes on these mounts are way too faraway from each other. well back to drawing board.

Looks massiv!
Where did you bought these screw in axles?
I tried to find them in the past, but the ones I found were ridiculous expensive.

Orginally i intended to use baseplate i have, but i fucked up as usual. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/947f2c5a5c36f4c881840de653c9f12c76d0470b.jpg" width="690" height="388">
So now i have to make new baseplate. well at least i can say that i builded my own board.

Dude,  just cut a little off the triangle at the pivot. Then screw a new pivot in.

I will try that with other hanger that pivot didnt center right. and probably it is best to lower this thing a bit.

thats looking real nice. I thought that the hanger looked a little bit out of proportion in the first few pics.
looks a lot nicer now. well done.

how thick are those motor mounts? it looks a little thin.
also I notice that you are mounting the motors at the back. any reasons?

I like to think out of the box, mostly my shit doesnt work :grinning: and mounts are about 4mm.Btw this was my first time using the mill or what ever the thing with 8 golden spinning claws that says fuck you to metal is called.

Ah cool. I usually use 6mm brackets and with the nature of skateboarding being a bit rough I have seen some of my 6mm brackets end up bent. 4mm should be ok but maybe go a little thicker next time.

i think belly pan between mounts will give it enough stiffness

ok time to bury this project.
i underestimated power of these small fuckers. so i added 1 support bar, but the motors snapped M4 bolt pretty fast <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/971f1fac1199ae952bd0dd9816f8c86a6f240718.jpg" width="690" height="388">
after adding another support it has been working pretty decently.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/b/3be71e535f06f75455d00449a56f03b1fd42d2f5.jpg" width="690" height="388"> it was a fun project but the desing is full of flaws.
