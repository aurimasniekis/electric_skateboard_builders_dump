It has a flange to retain it to the pulley. Like flatspot said, I think it's the f608zz as well.

Not sure if you found the bearing you need but I've got nothing but good things to say about vxb for bearings :)

@michaeld33, can you confirm that the pulley flatspot mentioned fits? 

It it is a F608ZZ, then it should be readily available as it seems to be used in 3d printers. 
Most shops that sell 3d printers stock this bearing and sell it for like 3$ ...
