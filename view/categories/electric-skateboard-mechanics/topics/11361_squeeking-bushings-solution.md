Yeah, i was gonna say, easiest way would be hand soap or wax. Make sure you cram it into that pivot cup too!

Here's a tutorial:

@oneafrikan I've tried the shaved gulf wax and soap but I prefer Armor All. I spray a little into the bearing cups and onto the bushings, wipe off the excess, and then reassemble. It makes the trucks the feel new again. It's a silicone base, so it probably works the same way silicone grease does, but less messy. I reapply it every 4 months or so.

I used WD40 spray - it got the job done.

Please don't do this!
WD40 is not a lubricant, and its not very kind on rubber/plastic either! (Unless you're talking about silicone wd40)

With wax you want to cut a piece that's the same size as the pivot and really work it in with some force and on top of that maybe some shavings. This made my trucks so smooth I had to get harder bushings.
