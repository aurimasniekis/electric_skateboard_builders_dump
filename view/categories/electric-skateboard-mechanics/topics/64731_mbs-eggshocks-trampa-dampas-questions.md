I'm looking to buy some eggshocks for my spring trucks that arent mbs brand, but im not sure if they will fir or make a big difference so i have some questions. Im also considering the trampa dampas but with shipping to the us theyre more expensive. They also seem more unlikely to fit non trampa trucks.

1. How tall are they? I measured the uncompressed space of my springs as 3 cm (between plates). Plates are also flat.

2. How do they effect the ride with and without? Currently carving and fast speed on normal ground feels fine, but if im going fast and hit a bump it destabilizes the board quite a bit. Im hoping the eggshocks would help with that.
