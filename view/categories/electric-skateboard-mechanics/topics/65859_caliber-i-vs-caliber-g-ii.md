Looking to buy caliber trucks and first genaration Caliber I is much cheaper for me than model G II. 
Are there any big differences between them? 
I guess a regular caliper motor mount will fit on both models, or am i wrong?

No sure about Calliber G, but the torque boards clamp and mount works with the regular calliber II trucks

Caliber 1 is TKP (traditional kingpin) and Caliber 2 is RKP (reverse kingpin)

Caliber 1 will be harder to mount a motor to but will be better for shortboards and 20-25mph builds

Caliber 2 will be easier to mount a motor to and better for faster longboards

The RKP [TB218](collections/longboard-trucks) trucks are better for esk8 than the Caliber2

Caliber II and Caliber I are both RKP trucks as far as I know. The Caliber Standards are the TKPs.
CALIBER I - RKP: https://www.amazon.com/Caliber-Truck-Co-Skateboard-44-Degree/dp/B00J5J6BVE/
Caliber II - RKP: https://www.amazon.com/Caliber-Trucks-Cal-50%C2%B0-Longboard/dp/B00NY3Q5P4/

you can see the blank caliber logo on the Cal Is and the Cal IIs have a II in the center of the logo. I believe the Caliber I and Caliber II run the same baseplate, but the hangar is slightly different. I think the changes were made mainly to the bushing seat and pivot on the hangar, along with an updated kingpin.
