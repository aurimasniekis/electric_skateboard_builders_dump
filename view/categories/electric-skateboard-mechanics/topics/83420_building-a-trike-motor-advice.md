 So In the past, I was building a FrankenBoard (Previous Post), weirdly enough it worked perfectly. I had a Top speed of around 35km/h and a range of around 20km (The chain wasn't aligned properly so it drew way more current to run than necessary). 

I am currently working on a larger Trike using the same 12S5P Battery Pack I built out of Samsung30Q's. I wanted some advice on whether or not [ this 800W motor](https://www.miromax.lt/en/m-6/c-39/c-45-brushless_bldc_motor_with_permanent_magnet/product-52-three-phase_permament_magnet_motor_800w_blt-800#tog109) would suffice and if I could still use my FOCBOX with it (It seems to have the sensor wires so it should work).  BTW its only a trike in the sense that it has 3 wheels, it's more like a [Soap Box Cart](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjbwoKJlqjgAhWDIDQIHeZMDZoQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theunion.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2Fthe-rusty-rockets-of-san-joses-don-schafer-wins-5th-annual-nevada-city-adult-soapbox-derby%2F&psig=AOvVaw1BnLleBvrgmbynEsnP_EzM&ust=1549579063626036) with a 13inch back wheel and 2 8inch MBS front wheels. 

Also I am open to any other motor suggestions, (Though I am trying to use a single powerful if possible, just for simplicity) 

My goal is a Top speed of ~60km/h, range of ~40km with a 3:1 ratio.

Top speed of ~60km/h

Seems like other vehicles I've had required at least 4-5 HP to get to around 40mph... so a 800w motor is just over 1 HP equivalent.

The spec sheet for that motor doesn't give a KV rating, but does give a performance graft, which gives an aprox KV of 50...
plugging that into http://calc.esk8.it with 3:1 gearing and 330mm drive wheel gives a top speed of about 20mph, which sounds about right.
