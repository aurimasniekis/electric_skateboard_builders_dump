Yep, the 7 inch inner tubes fit the 6.5 inch, just gotta pump a bit less due to the 6.5 inch tyres being a bit smaller than the 7

hey wait since you guys seem pretty knowledgeable, Should I get the holy carve for these bindings? https://www.trampaboards.com/nylon-hook-bindings-c-44.html

Or would the regular carve work 

Idk how to install them :>

@Sn4pz you should change the title a bit for deck and bindings too haha, so those who see the title can give some info if needed. If not @trampa might know too

I believe that you just need to order binding holes if you donâ€™t buy a complete. But like was said before, @trampa is the best source

7" tubes work on 6.5" tires. All bindings fit any of our decks. We can drill the deck for you. There is also a drillage manual under HQ>>Manuals.
