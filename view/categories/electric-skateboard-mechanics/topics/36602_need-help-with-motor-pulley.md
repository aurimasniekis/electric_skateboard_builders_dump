Remember that motor  uses pulley with 6mm bore.   

Question to ask yourself 
1. What battery will you be using.  
2. What kind of speed control. ( Car esc or vesc)?
3. Wheel size.
4. Top speed you want?
5. What motor mount to use?
6. What gear ratio you want  2:1 or 3:1?
7. Do you want to use 3mm or 5mm belts?
