Im planning to build a dual drive board and have 3d printed wheel pulleys that are for 9mm belts. Im also planning on buying some motor pulleys on ebay and they all seem to be 16mm wide.

Will I have to worry about belt slipping or truck space (standard caliber ii's)?

Nope, no problem as long as you use 9mm belts, it'll just look funny.
