Hello builders, 
Here is my motor mount, made of pom c plates cutted at my cnc machine. I can do this mount and adjust it for any truck. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/e/6e9feb8cca3c12d7d1f3229eed702192da57deb7.jpg" width="690" height="387"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/d/2dffd0fab2b437e41fa8774e62c6de55a97b7596.jpg" width="690" height="387"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/9/09bda7ef29d8e449295663e54b6f934f81a14141.jpg" width="280" height="500">

Nice like the steam punk feel to them, was thinking about using wood for some enclosure parts too, not sure I'm good enough at working with it to do what would need to be done though.
