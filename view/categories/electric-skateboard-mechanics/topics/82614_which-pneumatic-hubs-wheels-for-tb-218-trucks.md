I wanted to know which hubs or wheels would fit the TB 218 trucks - I can't work out if the axles are long enough for MBS/AT wheels?

I use them with the aliexpress 6x2" aluminum wheels. Costs < $100 for a full set including pulleys. Details in the thread below.

@torqueboards is working on pneumatic hubs/Wheels that will fit tb 218mm trucks with no modification.
They should be avilable very soon i was told!
Maybe you should wait for those? I know i will.

No modification needed for the AliExpress 6x2â€™s.  Great wheels.

Or the MBS Rockstar II hubs

Did you need to use different bearings?

Haggy's fit very nice, I just bought pulleys from marcmt88 for them. Just a heads up though, putting bearings in is quite the hassle and even more when you need to take them out (because the hubs are metal) ![image|666x500](upload://5VM2XKeClRvRpT9WRoXqfeXzg9V.jpeg)
