This topic has been brought up here before but I don't want this to get buried in a previous thread. In my opinion, the more safety awareness we have, the better. Last Friday, me and a friend decided to do a quick ride before heading to a basketball game. Not a "real ride" where we pack a bunch of filming gear, protective gear, etc. just a quick 15 minute run at a local high school. My friend has been skateboarding since 5 years old and is an avid photographer/videographer so riding with him is always a good time and his shooting/eboarding skills are impeccable.

So we did a few laps in a high school parking lot and decided to ride inside of the track and field area where it's a softer clay surface. I did my run first as my buddy filmed. Then we switched places and I started shooting him. This was pretty much the last shot before we were getting ready to leave. Suddenly and without warning, he took a bad fall while turning a corner, no mechanical errors, just clipped the edge of the track. I was wearing a helmet, he wasn't (he's in the middle of a move and his helmet was packed in a box - still no excuse). He started seizing on the ground and fell unconscious. Instincts kicked in, dialed 911. As I'm waiting for the medics, all I could do is watch his breathing. In my mind, all that mattered was that he was still alive. His injuries looked so traumatic - seizures, foaming at the mouth - I feared the worst and at best - a life of assisted care.

The ambulance arrived in record time. He actually woke up but was confused and slurring his words. All good signs but not enough to make any clear diagnosis. I took his car to the hospital and had to wait an excruciating 45 minutes in the waiting room before I could enter his room in the ER. The whole time I'm texting his mom and alerting his friends and co-workers. By the time I see him, he's awake but very groggy and still confused. The doctor says he has a subdural hematoma - a fracture in the skull and bruising in the brain. As his parents arrive, he becomes agitated and belligerent to the point where they escort us into a private waiting room as they administer sedatives and painkillers to calm him down. Essentially, one of the worst experiences of my life. Fortunately, we were less than a mile away from the University of Michigan Medical Center, one of the best, most state of the art hospitals in the country.

The following day is promising. The CT scans throughout the night show no further bleeding, no permanent damage, just a few weeks of bad headaches. I visit him in the morning and he is alert, aware and remembers everything. I said a prayer and thanked God for listening to me. Yesterday he looked even better and today he will be discharged from the hospital and bedrest for the next two weeks at home. Long story short, we dodged a bullet, but we shouldn't have put ourselves in the line of fire in the first place.

I would say that generally, guys like myself with families, tend to ride in a way that minimizes risk - from safety gear, to understanding the limits of our machines and our bodies. It's like a subconscious switch that protects us because of this fear of not being able to provide for our kids. For some of my friends who are in their early 20's without kids, that switch hasn't been activated yet, they are fearless which is both admirable but very scary. Eboarding is still a sport that emphasizes speed over safety and I take full responsibility for contributing to that kind of behavior with my videos. I take full responsibility for not saying "no". His take is that he didn't bail correctly when he got the speed wobbles. His parents keep telling me not to beat myself up. But I see it differently, this should never have happened. I came very close to tossing all of my boards and parts into the garbage and buying an Xbox but then I realized that I have a greater purpose and that's to put more attention to safety. Will people still get hurt riding on these machines? Yes. Can we minimize not just our own risks, but others who are not hardcore DIY enthusiasts? Yes. But we shouldn't have to wait for loved ones to get critically injured to truly understand that.

I'd like to urge everyone to ALWAYS WEAR A HELMET even if you're just going down the block. Even if it's not a "real ride". Always have a spare or two or three for anyone who wants to ride with you. No helmet, no ride, simple as that. And as an added safety feature, I've programmed speed limits on my VESC's with ERPM. Some of you may scoff at the idea of lowering the speed of your machines but until you've experienced what I did last Friday, keeping other's safe should always be at the top of the checklist. If you see reckless behavior, point that shit out. It's not cool and it will ruin this sport by putting lives at risk. I don't give a fuck about speed as long as I have my buddies next to me.

It will honestly take some time for me to get back to riding anytime soon, but just wanted to share this story while it's still fresh in my mind. Please be careful out there and keep each other safe.

Same exact thing happened to one of my friends downhilling in the anaheim hills. I had to dial 911 and cover the golf ball sized hole in his head until they arrived, the whole time playing down his injury to keep him calm. Definitely life changing..Then, two years later, I let my guard down and blew out my knee.  Moral of my story? Not sure...Helmets suck for protecting your knees?

I'm glad your friend is still kickin!

Thanks for sharing your story and taking the high road!

I see this more times than I'd like to when I worked in a recovering center as a Occupational therapist. One of the deadliest injuries is Traumatic Brain Injury which is probably what Happened to your friend. Get your friend to do MRI scan of brain every 3-4 months for the next year. There will be repercussion for the brain down the line. I've had patient who develop Parkinson because of too much TBI when they were younger sustained from soccer or boxing. It's really no joke. 

Wear your helmet, people! And if you're going more than 20mph wear a full face helmet, I've had a patient rip his jaw off from going more than 30 mph down a mountain. It ain't so fun when you need more than a year or two to recover.....if you survive initial impact.

Thanks for sharing the experience @RunPlayBack. I'm very glad that your friend is OK, and hope that he'll continue to recover well.

I think that safety is woefully overlooked in the skating world in general, and with esk8, and especially DIY,  it's far easier to end up at dangerous speeds.

Maybe we can turn @RunPlayBack's experience into something with a positive outcome if we start to encourage riders to protect themselves from these kinds of accidents. How about a Sticky on the this forum about safety that all members are required to read?

I see many posts where a new builder starts out saying "I want a top speed of 28-30mph!" Every time I see it I silently hope that speed is never achieved. I think that we, as a community, should start to dissuade that kind of planning with new builders. Very few people know how to safely ride at that speed. The casual person who skated as a kid and now wants an electric board for fun and commuting should be guided to start at a more modest pace.

Unless you are a pro, on closed course, and wearing full gear including leathers, top speeds shouldn't be touched. We've gotten really good as a community at building incredibly fast boards, but we haven't gotten very good at practicing restraint. No amount of fun is worth the cost of a major injury.

I am already using the full face helmet and feel naked if I don't have.

My next priority is some sort of wrist/palm protection that still alllows finger dexterity.

Seems like buying some slide or wrist guards is best and just remove or modify the insert or puck to not get in the way.

This is one safety product E boards needs to get more people on board.

Glad to hear your friend is doing better. I've only done one ride without a helmet, it was more of a slow paced ride at a speed I could kick push a regular board at for about half a mile. Felt horrible about it, but I was trying to do some photography early on a sunday morning, no cars or people around..still no excuse.

I've been debating on how much I would wear my full face helmet with the two boards I have incoming now that it's summer. My FF worked excellent during cold weather and I always wore it (especially considering it cost me ~$300). But I missed the breeze on my face when it started getting warm and stopped wearing it and switched back to my old Bell. 

Since I play on going 24-26mph consistently when I get these boards I think I'll have no choice but to where my FF. I always thought that if I end up not tucking my head to the side when I bail my jaw would be forced inward to a point where I'd fuck up my teeth or as @Nate described my jaw getting ripped off.

I plan on wearing elbow & knee pads from now on as well. Too many scars and I'd like to not fuck my knees for life...

My thoughts and prayers are with you, brother!! Thank you very much for putting yourself out there like that. This is very important stuff to share. I lost my friend Dustin to a motorcycle accident a few years back. He was a daredevil and did way more risky stuff than what got him hurt. He was busting a wheelie on a Harley Fatboy across a parking lot, he'd done that a million times, and clipped the curb setting down the front end. I wasn't there, but my buddy Bill was and he had to hold him down and used his t shirt to hold his skull bits together. Dustin was a really great guy. Loyal, honest, would literally give you the shirt off his back. Aaaaarghhh...I'm crying like a little bitch...I gotta get some air...Peace...

Thanks for the response guys, I just can't take a passive approach to safety anymore. One accident is already too much. @treenutter is right about having some kind of sticky about safety. And a thread like this goes beyond theoretical recommended safety warnings because these stories hit home for many of us.

Hope he recovers.  Most people don't think of falling until it happens to them.

I wear full face DH helmet anytime I'm goin above 20 mph and a regular certified skate or bike helmet regardless of how fast I go.  I wear wrist guards when under 20.  20-26 I'd add knee and elbow pads.  More than that and I'd use my DH leathers with padded elbows and knees.  I'd also use full fingered gloves. 

@CSN you can use full finger gloves and just remove the puck.  You can cut off the thumb if needed to get a better feel of the joystick.  I have $200 motorcycle full gauntlet armored gloves and since the fit is perfect I can easily manuever a joystick with those.  They definitely feel safe!

His name's Robbie the other dude I did the highway video with is Patrick, both of them are highly experienced skaters/longboarders in the area. But Robbie is definitely in a lot of my videos, he was the one who pulled a manual on one of my boards. Again, it's like the friends who know how to handle a board are the ones that get hurt the most.

After reading your story I will make sure they use helmets, just like you posted in A2ESK8, _New rule, no excuses: if you don't have a helmet you can't ride. All it takes is a second to change your life._ 

Hope your friend gets well soon.

Actually in the newest video it was my friends helmet that he was using and it was the Predator DH6, I am still waiting for my TSG Pass. Local longboard shop went out of business just when I had ordered the helmet so had to order it from online. Tomorrow it should be here, should I make an unboxing video with my finnish hydraulic press channel accent?

That's the *exact* helmet I have. Thought I had ordered the fully black one : p almost went and bought this carbon version which is even more badass but way too expensive... <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1019185e1628d718ca300a837b874370712857cf.png" width="500" height="500">

One word of advice with wearing these in the summer is to take it off as soon as you're done riding. Assuming most of you cruise around 22-25mph you should be somewhat cool while riding but as soon as you stop you'll be baking in it. I'd say just go slow and wear a regular helmet if you're in a really humid environment...

It'd actually fit with your incoming board more than mine lol I will pic one of these up if I ever really fuck up the current (fingers crossed I don't)

Also forgot you were the one that introduced the BB sub to the dh6 right? I almost got that exact one as well but cancelled once I heard about all the PASS' features and the look..also thought having predator on the side of my face wasn't the most flattering thing

yea I told the BB sub about DH6.  I do think the TSG pass looks better, would have gotten that but I didn't know about it.  The predator works but it's one size fits all.  You get velcro and pads to make it smaller if you want.

There are so many types of helmets out there...do you think you need a longboarding helmet specifically, or will a downhill biking helmet suffice?  I'm a little lost of this stuff, just so many options!

Don't get a motorcycle helmet.  Downhill biking helmet is better than a regular skate or bike helmet.  Downhill longboarding helmet works best, it's designed for the types of falls you will have going fast on a longboard.  Plus they look the coolest.

For commuting in the city where I rarely go past 13mph because of pedestrians, traffic, etc. I like to wear my Bern Brentwood which is aesthetically pleasing in my opinion because it has that flip down visor so it looks like a hat. I do think a full face helmet is the best option. Like @Haimindo and @Jeff I ordered a TSG Pass, shortly after the accident. I still don't think I have the nerve to go full speed for quite some time which is why I programmed speed limits on my VESC's but investing in a full face is something I should have done even before attempting my dual build. @chaka has always been a big proponent for the full face but I always brushed it off as a luxury item or for hardcore downhill longboarders. But I've done a complete 180 from that kind of mentality. I'm already thinking about buying more just so I have extras for friends who want to ride with me. You can't put a price on the value of someone's well being, especially our loved ones. I think the experienced rider's in here invest in a lot of safety gear and ride responsibly but I don't think we should take it for granted that everyone who is just starting out is doing the same. We all like to talk top speed and making land missiles but we need to balance that talk with safety. I'm not making that mistake anymore because seeing friends get hurt fucking sucks.

I use a Triple8 Brainsaver. Allowed me to walk away from a fall that could have easily landed me in the hospital or worse. I rode for years without a helmet and thankfully came out with no major head injuries, but having kids (and getting an electric) changed all that.

This is good point. I too use ERPM-limits when cruising in public places, mainly because the small EV law changed in January to allow e-longboards etc. that go max 25kmph and I dont want to be "that guy" who gets all e-longboards banned. Max speed is when you have safety equipment and you can be sure that you dont harm others (closed environment). But now I think the erpm limiter is for my own safety also. 

Is there some kind of speed limit in the states?

I think it's 20mph in California but not sure how strict they enforce that. I feel I've gotten a little too comfortable at high speeds but finally put the limiter on it because it's just not worth the risk for me anymore. Going REALLY fast by yourself isn't all that fun either. I enjoy riding with others and I don't think we need to break speed records to do that, especially when we're filming with different camera rigs and thinking about interesting angles, locations, etc.

I'm actually going to get the Bell Super R2 MIPS for the summer since I don't want to get all sweaty and soggy. I'm also going to get an armor jacket and wrist guard. Gonna go in full armor protection. Then when winter comes I'll get the airbag jacket and TSG helmet. Hopefully I'll never have a chance to put it all to the test :sweat_smile:

Edit: I'm actually having a hard time trying to figure out how to add knee protection on when I have to wear suits for work. Would appreciate any suggestion!

The Vector M-6 deserves a look.

Even in 100 degree temp with the visor open a few clicks its really not that hot.

I 100% agree with this...and that who "switch" turning on. When I was in my teens through my twenties, I rode skateboards without a helmet (not at skate parks though, I suck too badly at that) I used to fly down steep stairways with my mountain bike, I'm 36 now with a 1 year old daughter and in the past 6-8 years I never rode anything without a helmet, I might do a slow roll down my driveway, but that's all. 

I think my switch came on when I finished college and moved to a city where there were no bikers, scooters, skateboards, etc. really exist. Every once in a while I would see candles and flowers on a curb or one of those white bikes chained to a light pole where some pedestrian or biker died. There are way too many of these instances and too many hit-and-runs for me to take that risk. The helmet isn't going to help much being hit by a car going fast, but something is better than nothing.

I was thinking about something similar to that. While price isn't so much of an issue, fit definitely is and downhill bike helmets are the only thing that seem to be available locally.  I don't want to buy a super safe downhill longboarding helmet online to find it doesn't fit well, which isn't safe either!

I'm wondering if you guys know, like that bell helmet is probably only good for one crash, are downhill longboarding helmets designed for multiple impacts, or just a one time deal as well?

There's ways to measure the diameter of your head using a ruler and string or just go to a local bike shop and try out some helmets that are comfortable. Use the cm size to determine what size you'll need to purchase a full face online. For example I used my Bern Brentwood helmet (L/XL) to figure out the size for the TSG Pass (L).

If sizing is your concern then you can order from Amazon. They have a great return policy and in most cases free. 

As to your second question, NEVER reuse an impacted helmet regardless of superficial damage. You might not see it but the inside core might be crack and damage. Should you have an impact in the same area again, the strength and rigidity of the helmet might not be able to hold up to the force as well as before. You only have one brain my friend. Also, regardless of accidents, you should replace the helmet after 2-3 years of use. Deterioration can be a pain in the ass.

As an aside, there's a saying when I was still working a OT; you can replace every part of your body, liver, heart, arms or legs, except for your brain and nerve cells. So armor up!

Makes sense, kind of sucks if you tend to fall a lot, or even really twice...don't think FF would be that affordable that point unless you get something like the Bell. Wonder how often DH'ers replace their FF.

i use a full face motorcycle helmet when performance testing and a regular skate helmet while out derping. 

I couldn't agree more with this post. When i broke my arm last year and had to walk home with it and my board, i sat down on the couch and had a vasovagal response that scared the shit out my wife. I was looking for better gear the very next day while i was in a sling. 

oh and if you break the right part of your elbow, they may not even give you a cast stating concerns about ligament flexibility, so broken arm with no cast for weeks on end and no pain pills? fuck that.

Thanks for all the responses guys!  Some really good advice.  Regarding multiple impacts, I was thinking more along the lines of how some helmets are designed to sustain multiple small impacts without needing to replace them. Like the type of helmet used in a skatepark.  Just wondering if downhill longboarding helmets are the same, or if it's more like any impact at all and throw it in the trash like a bike helmet?

I live in Canada, so options are limited regarding helmet choice unfortunately...I've used the measuring method when buying a hockey helmet online.  And even though those helmets are adjustable it still fit like crap - I guess due to a different head shape and I couldn't use it, so that's why I am a little cautious of not being able to try before I buy.

After I get the helmet, I better start looking into some body padding as well...This sport is expensive!

There is some company that sells multiple impact helmets for skiing, S1Helmet comes to mind ( http://shop.s1helmets.com/s1-helmets/ ). I tend to avoid it though because grading scale of lethal impact is pretty subjective and experience based.

Now that you mention it, I guess our sport would be consider as extreme sport. Red Bull sponsorship here we come!

If someone falls that much then they should reconsider another sport. Unless you're doing tricks, uiu shouldn't fall that much if you practice safety precaution. I think injuries are unavoidable but lessening the damage is doable.

Boosted has a pretty good risk assessment page but it's buried in the site. Something like this should be a sticky on the forum like @treenutter suggests. 

https://boostedboards.com/category/training-posts/safety/

**Risk Acceptance**
Risk acceptance can be thought of as a ladder with negative factors increasing the height and positive factors decreasing the height. Negative factors include: traffic, hills, little space to maneuver, potholes, loose gravel, water, cracks, debris, fatigue, increased speed, spectators. Positive factors include: preparation, coaching, inspection of the board, familiarity of the area, protective equipment. The consequences of accidents increase as you climb further up the ladder.

**Risk Ladder**
An accident can be thought of as a chain of negative factors. For instance: imagine you are late for work. You rush out the door with the board still a bit groggy. You are going a little faster than usual, and all of a sudden you don‚Äôt see the patch of loose gravel and go sliding off your board. There are several factors or links that came into play in this accident, and if any one was taken out the chain of events would be broken and the accident may of not occurred.

**You Don‚Äôt Have the Right of Way**
As electric skateboards become a legitimate new form of transportation we will begin to create new laws and guidelines to replace the outdated laws surrounding skating and motorized skateboards. For now though, in most places you don‚Äôt have the right of way in ANY situation. It is good to remember that, assuming you have the right of way can get you killed; a car will always win in a collision.

**Don‚Äôt Ride on Sidewalks**
Avoid riding on the sidewalks whenever possible. Not only is it a bumpier ride for you, but it is also a danger to pedestrians. If we are going to positively represent this new form of transportation, riding on sidewalks is the easiest way to attract negative attention.

**Where to Ride?**
We should strive to follow all the rules and guidelines that safe bicyclists use. Ride in the street with the flow of traffic or in bike lanes whenever available. Avoid pedestrian walkways, sidewalks, and anywhere else bikes are not allowed. Be sure to leave enough space between yourself and parked cars that a door opening doesn‚Äôt block your path.

**No One EXPECTS How Fast You‚Äôre Going**
Pedestrians, cars, and bikes will pull out in front of you with alarming regularity! People haven‚Äôt seen electric skateboard riders that often. They will assume you are walking or on an unpowered skateboard and expect you to be going much slower than you actually are. You need to take a defensive position and be ready to stop at a moments notice. This is a great reason why you should learn to footbrake for emergencies.

**Be an Ambassador**
Everyone is going to be watching you! Your behavior on the road could ultimately determine whether laws in your area are overturned in our favor, or enacted to limit any use of electric skateboards.

You represent all of us every time you step on your board. Every red light and stop sign you cruise through someone sees it. Every pedestrian you have a close call with may be calling their representative. If you are riding in a dangerous way, you might be the one that ruins it for all of us!

Instead promote good riding habits. Stop at lights and stop signs. Give everyone the right of way over you, cars, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Use hand signals to signal traffic or bicyclists where you are turning or if you are changing lanes. Ride in control!

I'm speaking hypothetically. More realistic would one crash every 5-6 months or so maybe, idk. Point is if someone needs to get 2 $300 helmets in the same year it becomes a bit expensive. I've only wrecked once, but I didn't hit my helmet hard really. Lightly touched the ground. Still rode with it but maybe that's a mistake. No cracks scratches or anything...this was with a skate helmet meant to be for multi-impact though.

I feel the same way too sometimes. But the thing that I keep going back to is being an ambassador of this hobby/sport and taking responsibility when non DIY friends ride it, even just tooling around. If I put half the effort into safety that I do with evangelizing the rush, this never would have happened. I'm surprised more of the vendors haven't chimed in on here because it's an important discussion. Do we take the passive "I told you so" / "play stupid games, win stupid prizes" stance and keep accentuating speed over safety or do we find a balance? I refuse to turn a blind eye to the issue because the fact is I built something that ended up hurting someone because of one negative factor - protective equipment. I enjoy building these things to share with my friends and have a positive communal experience and this experience was the exact opposite of that. I hope the guys here who are building land missiles for new members never have to go through what I went through because it really sucks.

@RunPlayBack totally see where your are coming from mate...but I feel you are blaming yourself a bit too much.  There is an inherent risk in what we do. We accept it.  Definitely sucks what happened. And the light has been shown...you know better, he knows better, we know better....you have adjusted the way you ride and put safety at the top of your check list...

Hope your buddy heals fast...but he wasn't the only one that got hurt that day...you need to heal a little..Confidence is a little shot and placing blame on yourself solves nothing...limiting your board, throwing on a brain bucket...sharing what happened, now that doing something!

Get back on that horse and ride man...rip that shit up, but in a safer way...it's all you can do...that's what you are doing now. You are a better e-boarder because of it

Then I thought, what about my ears? So I got a 3/4 helmet. By then I'm e-boarding 
At speeds from 20-30+ Mph. Then I thought what about my face! So I got this.

Have any of you gotten aggressive abrasion from falling at speed even while wearing elbow and knee pads? I'm just trying decide whether or not to get full body armor / full leathers.. I'll be going about 22-25mph on average, sometimes a bit more. I've fallen once with a 2 layered cost on in the winter and gotten a scar on my shoulder. Wasn't going that fast either...

How many of you would *actually* wear full leathers or body armor in the summer for commuting? I want to go fast while commuting to work but don't want to lose my skin / visit the ER :)

I saw that, from the reviews I saw it seems like it's mostly meant for snowboarding or basically cold weather uses. Might pick it up for the winter but I need something breathable..seems like breathable and protective don't go together : p

Road rash seems to be the only real threat when it comes to body armor vs leathers/jackets.... I might have to toughen up and risk it. Would make riding intolerable on humid days if I had to wear a jacket. I'd like to think if I'm gonna bail at least my bones wouldn't be broken. Probably gonna just practice sliding on my pads and wear my Pass, better than nothing.

Probably a lot of factors here that are different for all of us in regards to safety gear - geography is probably the biggest variable. For example, going fast commuting to work isn't practical because I work in a dense city. Traffic, weather, road conditions, experience, etc. also come into play. I think you'll have to weigh how high the risk is but I think we can all agree that helmets are mandatory across the board. Safety gear can minimize some risk but predicting how a car or pedestrian will react to your speed is variable. In a closed course like a parking lot or other open space feels more appropriate for speed and full blown armor/protection. Basically what I'm saying is slow down if you're commuting to work lol. Sorry I'm just being a Dad again.

I appreciate the advice, I probably will slow down *some* day ahaha. But really I think from previous commutes during the day I can judge when it wouldn't be appropriate to go max speed based off of my conditions. Likely wouldn't be going 25mph when I get into the city, but in the suburbish area I'm in (first part of my commute) cars are usually going pretty fast. That being said I don't think I should need full armor for a work commute if I'm just mindful I guess.. 

I will probably steal your helmet for my summer commuting, this thing looks so nice I can't ignore it...and they came out with a [2016 version](https://amzn.com/B016MXB1CE) that's a bit larger than the previous to accommodate non-pointy heads:

@RunPlayBack Just took a ride with my new TSG Pass helmet. Pretty impressed with it. Lightweight, not too hot, and great visibility!

I feel like I should be wearing some sort of jacket to prevent road rash on my shoulders incase I take a slide on the pavement.

Anyone have experience with lightweight protective jackets? I found this one: http://www.revzilla.com/product/icon-anthem-2-jacket#reviews_tab

You should probably carry a durable backpack too. The few times I've fell from bike or esk8 at high speed I've end up having my back against the ground. My backpack probably saved me from spine injuries quite a few times.

When I did fall I didn't land on my back, but I slid on my shoulder which was covered by my 2 layered colombia jacket and it got torn through right to my shoulder. Would've probably gotten pretty aggressive road rash without a jacket... Probably shouldn't have been night riding when I was first learning to eboard : p

I checked out that jacket @Jeff, I had the same idea. Bit pricey for me atm, that's the main challenge with getting high quality protective gear that looks good : p  found a few other cheaper jackets, still can't quite find the right one. Might just take the road rash. Will be somewhat minimized with pads on at least. (kidding, I'll have to continue my search :/)

Just a quick update in regards to my original post. TL;DR - a good friend suffered a traumatic brain injury while eboarding and had to take him to the ER.

He's at home and recovering nicely in the 11 days since the accident. He looks great! However I don't want to downplay the accident. TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) is a very serious injury. One moment the person is normal and the next moment life has abruptly changed. Fortunately his main symptoms at the moment are headaches which have been slowly subsiding. With his family and doctors monitoring him closely, the healing is strong.

When he's up for it, I'll make a video that explains what we've been through and share it with you all. But in the meantime, here's a couple of goofy guys who are feeling really blessed today. :slight_smile:

That's great news! Glad to hear your buddy is recovering well. I've been witness to a few mountain bike related head injuries growing up, and it's amazing how quickly things can go bad, even with a helmet. From those experiences, I've made a point to always wear a helmet when biking, snowboarding, etc., but only started wearing one on a skateboard when I went electric. Maybe it's cause I never went faster than 10-15mph when I was pushing, but now I put on full pads/helmet each time I eSk8.

That jacket looks sweet dude. Does it have any type of foam plating inside of it? Usually, for me, the problem with falling off of a board is that my joints, namely my elbow and shoulder takes on the brunt of the kinetic energy and tears my muscle apart. And that's with some elbow pads. Maybe a long sleeve and armor jacket? Regardless please stay safe!

It has the non-Newtonian 3DO material. That means it is flexible when you move it, but becomes rock solid under impact.

@RunPlayBack those TSG helmets look amazing.  I use a predator DH6 myself, it's lighter than the TSG pass.  Although I think the TSG looks cooler.  I also have a moto GP level leather suit for anytime I plan on going above 30 mph for downhill or Esk8.  I'm in MI so DH is hard to do now w/o traveling to my friend's place in North Carolina, so I'm trying to replicate DH with Esk8.  Anyway this suit is total overkill but seriously safe, impact and abrasion protection like none other.  It's a pain to take on and off though, so most of the time when i'm just cruising and staying under 30 mph I don't it.  If you see my other videos I always have a full face helmet, and if I'm going 20-30 mph I throw on pads under my normal clothes. 

here are my leathers.

Also @Jeff told me you all are in a2.  I need to ride with you guys sometime, I'm over an hour away but I think i need to go up to a2 to ride.  I live in a flat area, but a2 at least has some hills where I can test my board out (12s, enertion r spec dual drive, LHB deck).

There are SO many full face helmets that downhill longboarders use.  A lot of them use mountain biking or motorcross helmets.  A lot of them use aero helmets too (which you don't need).  I think for Esk8 a downhill specific helmet works best.  The 3 main companies that make those are triple 8, TSG and predator.  From everything I've heard the predator DH6 and TSG pass are the better ones.  

Predator DH6 is one size fits all, it comes with foam inserts and you add those to make it snug.  It's really long, see my videos here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6w5jwWeYy_l0OGjYqVL1Ow to see what I mean in terms of the length.  Sticks out really far from your chin.  Also it comes with an orange and clear visor, I had to pay extra to get a black one. 

The TSG pass comes in 3 sizes and I've heard many positive things about it.  It looks the best in my opinion.  It is slightly heavier than the predator DH6.  I haven't tried one personally, but if I was buying one I'd get one of those now...for the looks factor.  It comes with a mirror finish and clear visor I believe.

The other advantage of a full face helmet is you can use the visor to block wind which can get annoying and cause teary eyes.  And you can also mount an action camera to your chin or the the side of the helmet.  I just attached an external lav mic and put it inside my helmet, so it can make for some awesome video with clear voice dialogue.

@RunPlayBack Agreed. That's just stupid. A big part of the helmet problem is the stigma that they aren't "cool". That and people not thinking about it or thinking it can happen to them. Not wearing helmets in amateur skate videos are one thing, but IMO, professional ESk8 manufacturers should have helmets (and other pads too) on every damn person in their videos along with some comment about responsible riding practices, and staying alive to be around to buy their next version/offering.

I guess that's what happens when you have your director of global sales delivering these boards lol, it's just about that commission. It's one thing to have unregulated overseas hoverboards without safety warnings, it's another thing to have a major US based manufacturer just throw caution to the wind because it would hurt the perception of their product as a non hazard, low risk product. How many miles do you think Leo their sales director spent on that board? Not many I assume, otherwise he'd know exactly the kinds of risks you take once you step on an eboard. I have to give it up to Boosted for presenting almost all of their current marketing videos with helmets on their riders.

I plan to ride in the city at 20-30 km/h and maybe up to 40 km/h down hills on the way to the city. I already have a halfshell helmet. I was just offered a tripple 8 racer fullface in new condition for a good price. I dont know if the positives of wearing it of not smashing my jaw and teeth outweigh the negatives of loss of peripheral vision ( will this be an issue) and looking more conspicuous in a country where E-sk8's are illegal (but nobody knows that because there's like 5 esk8's in the country) in either case I will wear a helmet, just not sure about the full face..

takes a little adjustment to turn the head a little more to see behind with peripheral vision.

The good FF helmets have wide enough openings and wrap around shields it's pretty much no real loss of vision.

Also a good helmet for this application is in the  1 kg (2 #) weight range so it's barely any perceptual weight.

Just a quick update - I've been putting the final touches on my ESK8 safety documentary and it's honestly one of the toughest things I've had to edit. As a doc filmmaker, objectivity comes naturally but being an active participant in one of the hardest things I've had to witness has helped me face a lot of the self-imposed guilt and regret over the entire experience.

It's also helped me grow as a human being, a father and as a friend. I doubt I could ever take a passive stance to a friend in distress but for a stranger? I wasn't sure until a few weeks ago when I saw a woman in a leg brace fall in the middle of a busy intersection. I flagged down traffic and escorted her to the curb. I figured it was a simple gesture, like opening the door for someone and it wasn't until someone patted me on the back and said "good job" that I realized the intersection was filled with pedestrians who stood idly by unsure of what to do. I reacted without hesitation and maybe I wouldn't have before Robbie's accident.

Additionally, my ESK8 interest has only increased because of the safety protocols and culture we've instilled into our crew. It's about lowering the risk ladder and the preventative safety routines that we've grown accustomed to. The story speaks on the thrill of ESK8 and the tight knit community that's formed in the shared experiences while also highlighting what happens when you miss one step in your routine. We're all in this together and we all have to look out for each other.

We'll be doing a local screening then probably push it online after the premiere. Thank you guys again for the support on this thread otherwise I wouldn't have had the courage to even watch the crash footage, let alone turn it into something positive.

@DougM @Photorph it was pinned for awhile but not sure what happened. I have no control over having this as the first thing new users see. There's a lot of different perspectives on safety - from vendors, to active users and new users and how often safety should be discussed, if it all. It shocks me how many people I see every day in Ann Arbor who don't wear helmets - from cyclists, skaters, longboarders, motorcyclists, etc. There's this pervasive, conservative attitude among some people here that screams "no one can tell me what I can or can't do on my own property". Yet three years after Michigan repealed the mandatory motorcycle helmet law, injuries have been soaring - http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-helmetlaws-michigan-injury-idUSKBN0UL2JN20160107  
 
I'm often conflicted about evangelizing DIY ESK8 and worrying who will be next to get seriously injured because of those sensibilities which are passed on from generation to generation. I can't help everyone, but I can help the people I care about and those who want to have these tough discussions.

Rik, your contribution and they way you've conducted yourself in this community is of the highest order. You've reacted to your friends horrible accident in such a evolved way, that I think you have (and continue) to inspired many on this forum. Not only to be safe, but to also be thoughtful in sharing and giving back into this community. Your putting out shitloads of good karma my man. 

I really look forward to seeing the documentary. Even though I we don't now each other outside of this world, I just want to say that I am really proud to have you as an advocate and representive for ESK8.

I'm on a tight budget and found these very affordable ff helms: 

http://demonsnow.com/store/Demon%20Podium%20Helmet

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00E5QK5U0/ref=pd_aw_sim_sbs_468_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=GQK9XAZ69FXYBPMCE0M8

The 2016 amazon link is 2 lb 2 Oz, same as the tripple 8 racer. I cant find weight on the older model. Looks pretty cool too. I'll be buying the newer one before my parts arrive. Wrist guards and elbow pads too. 

Also, two anecdotes about helmets. In high-school my friend fell going under 5mph. He hit somehow fell on the back of his head no helmet. He was alone and found unconcious some time later. Hes okay now but only after a 4 day coma.. 5 mph. Wear a helmet.

Second story. I commuted on a road bike every day. One morning park staff run a hose across the bike path. Two people in front of me ride over no problem. I was not so lucky. The hose caught and turned my front wheel 90 degrees and sent me shoulder first to the ground at 25 mph and whipping my head down on my temple. I would have certainly  died without my helmet. It was completely shattered but my head felt no pain on impact. Walked away with some road rash and bruised ribs.

Just pinned it back globally @RunPlayBack . There's a timer when you pin something which is why it probably went down. Hope it's okay with @onloop. 

Also little side story -- after a while of owning a GT I got really comfortable with it and stopped wearing pads, mainly just keeping gloves/helmet. Some days I speed around at 26mph in f*#*@ shorts with a half shell helmet and some slide gloves without the puck..

Had two crashes back-to-back days, first was from speeding on a bike path I hadn't checked for cracks -- jumped off and fell backwards only scraping up my hands and tearing up my shorts. Second day I fell within 30 seconds of my work commute wearing nothing but -- you guessed it -- helmet and gloves. I fell so hard, scraped up my elbow, knee, ankle, and hip due to some shirt stays I was wearing that dug into my skin. Also due to no deadman switch triggered my board accidentally and it hit me in the face on my lip, and oh yeah I fractured my scaphoid (bone in the wrist, the hardest to heal one that typically requires surgery). 

Despite the horror that was that day (having to patch myself up with practically one hand, changing bandages and driving to go get more because of so much blood), and the following, I was truly blessed with the way it panned out. From that day forward I've been wearing full pads on every single ride including a wrist guard which I thought wasn't necessary until I realized how often I stick out my hands to land on my palms (force of habit). I had a fall today that would've done more damage if I hadn't been wearing my pads. 

I'm convinced now that whether or not you're an "advanced" rider sometimes it doesn't even have to be your fault for you to get fucked up. At the end of the day even if you get hit by a car and it's their fault you're still the one that gets injured -- can't change that.

I live in a condo neighborhood where our garages faces each other, there are four units on each side. A few times a week. The parents would open all their garages and bring their kids out so they can play together. I would take my board out and just ride a little up and down the neighborhood while my wife is with our daughter. Last week one of the parents asked me why I was wearing a helmet since I was going pretty slow. I almost lost it and went ape$hit on him because he doesn't see the importance of exercising safety in front of his/our children.

As a parent....scratch that. As an adult, we have to set an example to kids that wearing helmets is normal, that it needs to be worn whenever we step onto a board or a bike or whatever. Sure, WE know the likelihood of brain injury is very small going low speed, but children should never think that!

So make sure you wear a helmet all the time!

Yeah I can definitely relate. After the accident, I put speed limits on my boards. But even then, I won't just let anyone ride unless they've put a few hours into my beginner boards. It's really about "when" you will fall more than "if" you will fall how will you be prepared to handle it. Having that kind of constant, situational awareness is what's missing from the culture marketing promoted by many mainstream companies, particularly their social media materials that don't show riders with helmets. Such a simple thing to do.

I was going to buy one of those Chinese LecDec/Melon/Backfire boards before doing my build. A 21 year old guy started a company rebranding the board as LectricLongboards, and sold them just $400. They took a while to ship and you can tell from all the impatient negative Instagram comments that majority of their customers are young teens.

As much as I would like for the price of these things go down. It scares me that they will get to that "affordable" price where every kid has one. I really think helmets should just be included in the box.

That's what worries me the most about making eboards "affordable". The more these chinese boards get pumped out into the wild the  more college kids (like myself) will get them and likely start getting f*^* up not wearing a helmet because they skate analog without one. Thankfully its not in the mainstream (yet...) and most peeps are up to their neck in debt and can't justify the expense. I'm a bit selfish but I really don't want to see more riders on the road where it hasn't been legalized yet (pretty much everywhere except california).

Sometimes someone gives a good example while riding an electric longboard with an helmet like vlogger Sara Dietschy. Unfortunately for her, she confirmed why it's good to always ride with an helmet on in her latest vlog:

Thanks for sharing, just saw that! It really will take bloggers and influencers to push electric skateboard safety to the forefront. While she does say that a biker cut her off, she can't assume that bikers/cars understand the speed/momentum of an eboard. While she did wear a helmet, there's a few things she did that raised the risk ladder.

1. As a native NY'er, riding and even driving over the Williamsburg bridge within traffic requires full attention which includes making yourself as noticeable as possible to everything around you. Eye contact and staredowns are key. I remember back in high school, I was driving over the bridge late at night with some friends and we noticed a motorcycle hanging over the side of the bridge. Apparently a car bumped the biker from behind and he fell off the bridge into the river. Terrible stuff.

2. Vlogging with a Sony RX100 and iPhone while riding at top speed on a Boosted over the Williamsburg bridge is not recommended unless you have some serious experience. Not everyone is Casey Neistat.

3. While breaking your cameras suck, the bigger takeaway should have been lowering the risk and accepting some responsibility over that. NY'ers are NY'ers and if you lack that situational/defensive awareness, you will get hurt.

I completely agree with you. The bigger responsability it's on the electric longboard rider, he must make all possible efforts to avoid accidents and must protect himself by actively taking measures like driving defensively and avoiding tricky situations which wasn't the case in the video situation like Sara explained.

One of the comments I made in the video was that "people are already used to bike riders and their behaviours but they 
don't know how to react to someone riding an electric skateboard." I think this was one this cases, the bike rider didn't take the electric longboard seriously enough to avoid a possible contact.

FYI...she should have called the police and gotten a case number. then the biker would've had to pay for medical bills..even if nothing was wrong. A $500.00-1000.00 ER bill is not uncommon for a few e-rays and documentation of what happened. Riding a bike/esk8 is like driving a car. You mess up, you pay! 

Anyways, back to the thread, thank you. I am ordering two bern fl-1 with mips for me and my son.

Yes, it is illegal, I know people who have gotten tickets. CN has been pulled over before for riding it. You are unlikely to get ticketed if you are on the street, but on the west side highway, they have a lovely sign which says it's illegal. I ride by it everyday.

I flip it off every time I ride by.

I can't agree with you more! Something similar happened to me. 

About a year ago, I was longboarding down a really big hill by my house in Tennessee. I was hitting about 45mph, which was a little out of comfort zone, but I did it anyway because I'm a thrill seeker. I had done this particular hill one time the previous day, and it was a ton of fun, so I decided to do it again. I was not wearing a helmet.

 I woke up the hospital two days later with a subdural hematoma. Someone had found me in the middle of the road, covered in blood. When the paramedics arrived, they put me into an induced coma to reduce the amount of brain swelling. Even so, there was a lot of swelling in my brain because of the bleeding, which caused damage to my auditory nerve, balance nerve, and facial nerve. I had facial paralysis for several weeks, and I couldn't walk without assistance for nearly a month. Luckily, my face and balance got better. My auditory nerve, however, did not. I permanently damaged my auditory nerve, and now i have terrible hearing, among other issues. 

I can't stress this enough:

Agreed. I ride the places in her vid on a regular basis and very few people know much about E-boards and how fast they go. Bikers are used to blowing past skaters like they're practically standing still. Cars are the same way. The general public does not understand the capabilities of our boards so we cannot ride like they do. Few bikers expect a person on a longboard to be able to hit 20+mph going up hill or even on flats. 

Technically, it's the bikers fault for not looking before changing lanes, but I'd put the blame on the girl. You have to be extra cautious around others while riding and always yield. Fortunately she came out with out any major injuries.

Im No expert but I'd say it's from having the vehicle under your feet. Sudden changes in acceleration effect your center of gravity from the most extreme point possible. If you ever catch a heel edge on a snowboard, you'll learn how fast you can get whipped into the ground. Plus speed, plus asphalt.

Yeah, I think that''s the case, with bicycle you are not standing straight like a pole.. and bicycle usually ''offers'' you to fly forward instead of backward.. with skateboard it's a lot worse, since, like in video, it can make you fall on your head backwards.

```
Protective reflex is your #1 enemy here. When you fall, your upper extremities will usually hyperextend institively to lessen the blow of the fall. That usually breaks bones or joints. While on bike, you're holding onto a handle which suppress the protective reflex for a few seconds, which is enough time to lessen the blow to the arms. However, that's actually why there are more legs and shouler injuries for cyclists and more impact injuries to the arms and head for snowboarders. Wear your wrist guard and helmets people :wink:

Which is why when I crashed my bike last year going 20ish I just held on and tipped (then slid). You definitely don't want to put your arms out straight when you fall.

This is a pretty basic video but talks about this stuff. They don't really cover the importance of helmets though.

Ya, I've been seeing a lot of kids on boosted lately without helmet. This one kid was even worst, he had headphones on the whole time, really infuriates me when they take chances like that.....I guess I'm getting old :unamused:

That video is educational for new riders but not enough since we have motors that generates momentum. That's why I've been telling esk8er to use arms and knee&shin pads. You really look goofy with all that armor protections but I really dislike getting hurt on asphalt and going to work with scars.

Yea, I picked up some pads and wore them my first few rides while getting used to it. Now I wear them sometimes. Its hard to force myself to put them on when I'm only commuting 2 miles and then have to walk into work with them on. Never without a helmet though. I do wear headphones but I mostly ride on isolated bike paths and make sure I can hear my fingers snap through the music. I hate trying to pass someone and you can see their headphones and you know they don't hear you yelling "ON YOUR LEFT". Not to worry about being passed on my board - hasn't happened yet :)

Here is some info on mips technology:
http://www.active.com/cycling/articles/what-is-mips-helmet-technology
What is needed is to safely and quickly decelerate the head so the brain (which is like a water balloon) does not slam against the cranial cavity and cause damage. If the force (fall) can be deflected (a percent of force re-directed) by moving the helmet within the helmet, the result is less transfer of force to the cranial cavity.

Hi guys, just want to share some wounds I earned yesterday.:poop: I was traveling back home after work and made a decision to go to supermarket for some food. So picked up a route I've never made before which was pretty rough due to heavy traffic and tons of industrial trucks pass by.

I should have got on the pedestrian path but I thought I was bit excited because the weekend was coming and yesterday was such a wonderful weather also few local events were held (zombie walk), anyway I stayed on bike lane for almost all time. 

Then, less than 30m to the supermarket, I hit the fastest speed I've ever had. Faster than 50km/hr, thanks to the tailwind :rolling_eyes:. All of a sudden I was launched from my board and landed on the rough, solid, merciless asphalt and slided for 10m long. Probably because there had a patch or a giant hole on the ground. Wasn't even a speed wobble lol. :joy:

Only had my 30 bucks half-face helmet on, short sleeve working shirts and most importantly : NO GLOVES. Well, you can tell by these pictures. I almost fainted when I was taking a shower, not to mention gave my wounds clean-up. SO HURT! But hey at least I still keep my nose and forehead although my glasses was wasted and got a bruise jaw.

So, everybody, get yourself fully geared then twist the throttle! Otherwise you could be worse than me, I was lucky didn't get run over by cars and my board kept at the side of the road so I can still having fun with it in future...:scream:

*Ordered knee guards , body armor and gloves this morning.*

Ouch.  Why do people always buy gear AFTER they fall.  Time to clean and dress your wounds.

To help with your healing, you will need to use antibiotic ointments to ensure your area doesn't get infected. Use saline washes to clean it often.  Do daily dressing changes for the first few days.

Switch to tegaderm dressings in a couple of days.  There may be fluid build up, but you can replace them if it gets to be too much.  

For optimal wound healing make sure it is clear of infection, and moist.

Ouch, I took a similar nasty spill due to the crappy winning remote. I rolled all over the place, but somehow only hurt my thumb. Took weeks for the skin to grow back though. Gloves, I would say, are the second most important safety gear. You'll always instinctively brace with your hands, and they're the most likely to get scuffed up. I'm using an old pair of leather drumming gloves right now, which have protect me against a few spills, but they're starting to show their wear.

Damn, you guys have sustained some pretty nasty injuries. I hope you all heal up fast and gear up in the end. I feel your pain. 

Having accepted the reality that an accident WILL happen at some point, and to avoid this very situation, I've been going with full knee, elbow, wrist pads, gloves and a full face helmet for my "serious" rides where I'll get up to 30mph/50kmh, and I'm still feeling like I could use more protection. I'm seriously looking into those plastic "armored" jackets like @RunPlayBack's buddy wears. Although, it's hard to tell which ones are good or not. Suggestions? :wink:

On my more mellow rides, up to 20mph/33kph, I still wear gloves, wrist guards, and a half bike helmet, at minimum. Gotta at least protect the most vital and easily injured areas. For me, this hobby/sport is way too fun to ruin by injuring myself, when the safety gear and protection is so readily available. Plus, knowing that I'm mostly protected allows me to relax more and enjoy the riding experience. 

Y'all stay safe out there. :punch:

Nurses use this all the time on pressure sores for patients, I hear it is great! So as a person who has worked with burn patients in the past, Keep those bandaged with some kind of ointment with antibiotic.. (silver sulfadiazine) is the gold standard. Also let them get some air uncovered for a few hours in the evening so they dry out a little. Good luck.

I agree.  Link them to Session Error as well. I've biked with a fixie and my landyatch switchblade for years now around campus and Downton Hamilton and never wore a helmet mainly  because I was being an idiot.  Left school to work at an internship for a year and a half,  obviously grew up and smartened up. On my first day of  my board I went straight to a bike shop and picked one up,  it'd just rather  or risk it,  don't know what I was thinking before hand but it's just stupid not to.  That and some good quality leather gloves.

I was cruising to work with my board but the road was a little wet this morning on some spots. Did easy and gentle carving at around 20 -25 km/h. Normally i am much faster. And from one moment to the other i made a highsider and looked right up in the air with my back in the direction where i was going and my head where i was coming from. And then had a very hard impact on my back head. Luckily i was wearing a bicycle helmet (which i wear most of the time, but not always) and a motorcycle textile jacket (looks cool and protects). 
Then had one or two barrel rolls and came to a stop. Without the helmet i am very sure that i would be in hospital right now or even worse.
Now my neck and my hip hurts a bit but nothing serious.
First thing i did when i arrived at work was ordering a Skate helmet to protect more of my head.
And i still don't understand how this could happen (very gentle cruising). 
I only can suggest to wear a helmet at **EVERY** ride which i will do now. Also if it is only a short 50 meter test run.

BTW: When i had my big motorcycle crash i was only going 50km/h and lost a kidney and broke my hip, spine, elbow and every rip i have on the left side multiple times. And i was wearing full high quality protection gear. 
But when there is a car infront of you which comes out of nowhere you will hit it like a wall. And the same can happen to us. 
So wear a helmet at least, because bones can break and heal. Damaged brains mostly don't.

Also the doctors at the hospital said that they can safe the most people as long as the brain is ok. But the most who have a brain injury don't make it.

So my helmet did its job last night (yeah, about 12 hours after I got it). I don't actually have much memory of the actual accident, or of the few hours after. I apparently got myself to the side of the road, campus EMS attended to me, and I somehow got them to call my wife, who then brought me to the ER (which is where my memory starts returning) and I was diagnosed with a concussion. I've been laying down and sleeping most of the day. So I'm out of commission for about a week (and my professors are being very accommodating), but I'm doing okay :smiley:

I'm a big fan of it so far. The dark chrome finish I have definitely causes a lot of rubber necking...but them again it could be the Raptor. TBH tho unless you are also planning to use it for snowboarding/skiing a bunch id probably recommend one of the other common ones around here. Its a little hot to wear with the goggles when its above 70 degrees F but that can be solved by taking off the goggles and just wearing sunglasses. The face mask is definitely not as strong as the ones on non-detachable alternatives but under 30 mph I'm confident it would provide solid protection.

Perfect! All I need to know to pull the trigger. I'm only going to use this helmet for winter when it gets too cold. I have another detachable Uvex helmet so I'm covered there for anything above 30mph or warmer days. Thanks for your info dude!

hi all,

i run in berlin city a longboard shop and also the biggest [longboard community](http://forum.longboardz.de) in europe.
since more than 15 years i fall in love with longboard downhill and since 12 years i go for WC race around the world.
what I have learned - alsways wear a helmt. what I have also learned - if i or my friends make a video show the people to wear a helmet. so we never make a video without a helmet.

many of the manufacturers post marketing videos in the social networks where the drivers do not wear helmets. as a manufacturer you have a role model.

since many years all longboard manufacturers post only videos with helm, which should be also with the drive manufacturers worldwide.

how do you see it? should manufacturers be obliged?
we always write to such videos - no helmed no respect - !!

just my 2 euro cents

Remember that motorcycle helmets are made and designed to withstand and protect the areas where usually a motorcycle rider gets hit, which isn't the same as long boarding, so having a motorcycle helmet will help but there are better options. Thanks for wearing a helmet though!

Thanks to @runplayback for turning me on to the Bern brand. I just picked up a barely used Bern "Watts" helmet for $25 on craigslist. I'm really liking everything about this helmet and the name "Bern Watts" is just too perfect for what we do. I especially like the fact that they have a Bluetooth speaker option and easily interchangeable liners for snow/cold conditions or summer/warm conditions.

Thank you for writing this post. I saw so many people riding without a helmet on YouTube while I was researching for my first build. I don't think people realize what kind of danger they're actually in. Helmet is an absolute necessity for this hobby, I would say pads are really a necessity too. Tarmac is like a giant sheet of sandpaper, you don't want to be sliding across it at 25 mph... So I bought pads and a Triple Eight Brainsaver helmet (the certified version). Thanks again.

Just to reiterate importance of a helmet.

My friend just took a tumble, not going overly quick probably 15mph, head hit road hard, hip and side scraped raw, possible fractured wrist. 

Lid took impact, without it he'd have been in a real state.

He does not always wear a helmet for short runs - playing the odds - Not going far, not going fast etc

We were only 100m into the ride.

Thankfully, this is not an 'if only' post.

I only started wearing a helmet after a crash, so can't preach, just urge persons that have not had a bad fall to take a pragmatic approach, learn from others and don't ride without a helmet.

@RunPlayBack Hey Rik, Tomorrow I will have the last parts I need to complete my first board. I just wanted to let you know what an impact this thread and your overall presence in this community has made on me. I was originally thinking "oh yeah I need a helmet and pads" but was just casually going about my build, I have a bike helmet I will wear but I had no urgency to get the gear I really need.

Today I ordered a FF helmet, knee, elbow, and wrist pads, I will never step on the board without them, and no one will ever ride my board without them.

I'm 23 and when I think about all I have yet to do in life, I wont let one moment of fun change that forever, just because I didn't take a minute to put on the correct gear.

Thank you so much for making an effort to help everyone realize how important this is.

Keep your head off the ground. Put your pucks and knees down or feet.. and not to often. Once it touches pavement. It's over.

Make sure your helmet chin is pulled down enough! I don't think I was wearing my pass right and hit that. Lesson learned 10 stitches later.

An article by my buddy James

https://www.facebook.com/groups/313675222393201/permalink/476935399400515/


There are some out there that believe it‚Äôs a case of natural selection. And I definitely get that and still some what agree (ironic as i write this) ,but as OG‚Äôs we need to lead by example. We‚Äôve seen people and been hurt ourselves. We need to help newbies avoid getting seriously injured like we have. To pretend it can‚Äôt or doesn‚Äôt happen is doing a disservice to Esk8. 

If Esk8 is to be accepted as a norm in society, we need to show that its a safe, long distance alternative to riding a bicycle....basically. And that we are good Esk8 citizens, sharing the road.

So, yeah...Wearing a helmet is all about being safe....but I also think it projects a positive light on our group, telling people that we are responsible riders.

Ordered [this.](https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Super-MIPS-Bike-Helmet/dp/B07GT7R6WD?th=1&psc=1)

My mishap after testing my DIY. Bad motor. Healing nicely now. The only time I didn't wear my protective gear. What are the odds? :face_with_symbols_over_mouth: Shoulder is still messed up but slowly healing. Looking forward to ride again tho.

A car might still hit you at much higher speeds. Your board may still go full throttle on you or suddenly brake in an instant. 15 mph is also plenty if you smash your skull against a curb.

Up 2 you though.

## \#370 Posted by: morrisxyz Posted at: 2019-04-04T04:42:24.963Z Reads: 130

To be honest, you should already be wearing a helmet.

With that said, I can bail and run off 15 mph, but there's no way I'm not hitting the ground at 25 mph. Falling at 15 mph is nothing like falling at 25 mph.

I suggest that any time you're trying anything new on your board, you should fully pad up. This way, you can safely push your limits, fall hard, and get up and try again. Regardless, always keep your helmet on.

If you intend on going fast, full face is a must IMO.
For slow rides an open face will do.

Keep in mind that at high speeds due to the stance we have on an esk8 which is high compared to a downhill longboard, you will slam the ground a lot harder.

id skated this route a couple times before but coming the other direction of this loop which is probably why i didnt feel this part of the road as I did here... wasnt a pot hold.. but like a patch n slap job...i could see it when i scrubbed frame by frame where the exact moment was =/

The weirdest thing about falling is how quickly it happens. One moment, you feel in control and before you know it, you are grinding your ass on the road. 

And then things calm down for a brief moment before panic sets in as you go through the sensation in your body to quickly assess if you have broken anything.

@accrobrandon I was wondering the same thing. Wasn't sure how the two pictures correlated. I thought maybe the first picture was what happened first, and the next photo was him geared up with a full face helmet so he's prepared for the next time. Then I wondered which one he was in the pic, and if he was the guy with the Raptor 2, and if it threw him off somehow.

When you are going really fast like 30+ i get into a tuck stance not just for wind resistance but for better stability. If you have any board malfunction at those speeds its face first into ghe ground. Ask me how i know lol

Full face is very important if you ever tuck anything can happen. In my case my front left motor on my 4wd build locked up at full throttle around 30mph. My board shot off to the left and i kept going straight. It happed so fast and i hit my helmet so hard till this day i have no memory of the actual fall. For sure i would be 100% dead with no helmet, the cracked ruroc would have been a cracked skull in the best case scenario.  This is the second time a helmet saved me. I owe my life to Derek because of him and his memory i never ever ever ride with out a helmet even a short test ride.

I forced myself to watch this before my first board, first time I watched this I decided to never ride without a full face, there is never an excuse to not wear it.

watched this again recently (it's on sky/now tv uk) I think it's important to remind myself it's not just me that gets injured with a TBI - friends and family get hurt big time.
