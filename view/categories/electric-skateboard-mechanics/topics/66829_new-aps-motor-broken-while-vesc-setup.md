Hey guys!
Today I finally finished my build. 
I set up everything. After motor detection this happened 
![image|375x500](upload://5Mh6mURA1frlMd3aeZkgJGpKx2b.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://fBKl67hJXxBjckTWOMfOxTZdpyR.jpeg)

By hand the motor was spinning free.
There was also no noise inside the motor which indicated something stuck inside. The motor mount screws also not too long.
Is it possible to repair that broken magnet?
If yes, where I can get them?
Maybe somebody know if some guys from alienpowersystem here who could help me out?

Have you bought that motor from APS directly? They should replace it because its obviously a faulty motor...

Unfortunately it was a reseller...
Bought two 6384 motors to brige the time till my other 4 motors from aps will come.
They on backorder and it takes ages till the come to Russia... now I need to wait again...
Fuck, summer close to finish...

I also had broken magnet from new motor, I think because of how they there shipped and I guess it cracked from dropping it...

Can glue broken fragment in. Clean with solvent, maybe scuff surface with sandpaper for better bite, make sure it sits flat and flush height wise, etc.

It‚Äôs not just aps experiencing QA issues.  I‚Äôve had magnets loose on two maytechs.  Both of my 3 month old sk8s have thrown hall sensors and all of them have no loctite on any screws.   Frustrating when you have just spent two days rebuilding only to find the can on a motor wobbling all over the place just after you‚Äôve glued on the pulley.  üò°üò°.  It‚Äôs not just motors either.  Most of the stuff we buy regularly is not properly tested.  I realise that when mass production is employed then a percentage is tested to give the overall rating but why then does it always seem to be me that gets the fucked one?   üôÑ.  Just ready to start programming and a brand new solid state switch shits itself too.   I‚Äôve had a bad weekend of failures without actually riding the thing with and this is a big point no fault of my own!!   Big shout to enertion for spending time in China nailing quality issues at the source.  Maybe more vendors need to be as vigilant.

That‚Äôs unfortunately true.
With some parts like our vescs I can understand if they blow when you run them on the limit with a 12s setup etc., but for motors...
That‚Äôs mostly easy things which cause the broke of something. Just the right glue and loctited on the screws would pretend 80-90% of the faults without extra cost for the producer...
The thing that always sucks...if you live not in a country like Russia, delivery takes ages.
Spend now nearly one full summer just with back and forth of components.
There is always something.
I already started to buy everything I can with one or two spare parts...
Guess I need to try my luck next summer üòÖüôà

Which Maytechs do you have problems with? I recently got 2 6374 170kv maytech sealed but haven‚Äôt gotten to testing or opening them yet.

I figured Maytech was a good brand as many other vendors sell rebrands of these motors feom what I‚Äôve read but I could be wrong

The point I was trying to make is not the individual quality of an item but the less than stringent quality assurance that the manufacturers and indeed the resellers employ.  It‚Äôs all too easy to ship out from China and rely on the factory to test the product but when you put your name on it then it becomes your responsibility and your reputation on the line.  Look at the issues enertion have had with multiple factories so much so that they had to spend two weeks shaking it up on site.  And good for them but it does seem to be an issue that occurs fairly regularly especially with motors.  I personally haven‚Äôt had anything from enertion turn up defective but two separate motor companies (one budget and one not so much) have had problems.

As far as we know, Maytech is also just a reseller. There are a few different bell designs etc. but most of it comes down to the same supplier and thus these motors will be using similar epoxy or glue. If you purchase a bigger amount of motors, you can apply your own logo/custom materials etc.

@Andy87
@Skunk
@Wraith   

so after all that conversation about motors failing I tried to ride my street set up and one of the motors was not spinning.  Opened it up and the vesc was flashing red 3 times in succession over and over.  unplugged the phase wires and all good. Stripped down the motor and found this.
![IMG_0017|375x500](upload://9Czw1jcPqgFK5TknREjKNLhFBBP.JPG)
then I looked at the stator and found this
![IMG_0018|375x500](upload://AuThstaY5Ro1fBVmYI57rnusN69.JPG)
presumably all caused by this
![IMG_0016|375x500](upload://okFBksWK8BZoqt4iv8tdW61SICF.JPG)
This is a motor not 3 months old that gets used hardly at all as its on my silly board that scares me a bit

So bearings broke apart and were moving about the can causing damage to the magnets? Is that grease on the stators from the bearings? 

Thats concerning :disappointed_relieved:

I'm assuming the bearing failed and chucked a lot of small balls and stuff round the motor and broke the pcb for the hall sensors.  That greasy looking stuff is glue that holds the sensor pcb down.  It chucked a hall sensor error at me a couple of weeks ago so I did what any lazy bastard would do,  disconnected the sensor wires, reprogrammed and carried on regardless.  Bearings that have had no weather to put up with and hardly any use should not disintegrate like this.

so frustrating too because I've been singing these motors praises because they are smooth and powerful and good value.  Hopefully its a one off.  Damaged on manufacture during assembly and once again it finds its way to me.  The fuck did I piss off in a previous life?

nah not in aus. Now I'm more worried about something similar happening to the Maytech ones I picked up recently. Have yet to hook them up to anything but I do hope they're fine and the epoxy/glue on the magnets isnt going to be an issue in addition to these bearings.

They do go about describing how they use quality bearings in them but I take that with a grain of salt now after hearing more QA issues.

Wow! That's chatostrophic failiure!

I'm very curious now. Was there only one bearing on the rear of the bell? If so that's just BAD design. Those tiny shallow groove ball bearings are not made to take any abuse. My 5070 APS motors have two of those bearings stacked up in the rear. I replaced the outermost ones with ceramic sealed RC gearbox bearings. Should last forever.


There's a few reasons it could have failed so horribly. If there was any kind of load pushing the bell into the motor (pulling the pulley outward, that direction,) then they'll be MUCH more likely to fail. These kinds of tiny bearings aren't made to take radial loads like that. A well designed bearing would have a needle roller thrust bearing stacked on top to take side loads.

But alas, we only have cheap Chinese motors.

@Hummie  hubs are made quality. Why can't we have well designed belt driving motors? There's a market for motors that can actually take abuse.

```
Yeah two bearings stacked but the outer one blew its load so to speak.  No radial pressure at all.  The other one is set up identical and fine.  Must just have been pressed in badly at the factory that maybe dented the cover or something.  Blows my mind how a piece got through and broke the pcb though.  How does that happen?  It was riding fine when I replaced the battery and never got a chance to use it with the new config.  I noticed it was stiffer than the the other to spin and the can was moving slightly.  All I did was set the new battery parameters and the vesc went all flashy red on me.  The rest is history.  Would be nice to have a good solid motor manufacturer thats for sure.

```
I betcha that the bearing was locked up. Axle was spinning inside the inner race. Once spun up using the VESC it probably had some kind of side load due to magnetic force between the stator and can, forcing the bearing to spin.

Hence why it shit the bed.

It just gets better and better at chez Daren.  Fixed the motor it runs and detects fine now.  Vesc not so much.  That little piece of bearing when it knocked out the hall pcb must have damaged it. worked for a while but now giving me the same 3 blinking reds   These are my fall back units anyway so i don't fry my focboxes.  Guess it did its job.  Shame though I actually like these hk 4.12's  
@Boxer86 yeah man think I might grab a couple for the very reason that they've been around for a while and no one complains about them.  Not designed for esk8 which is probably the very reason they are good.  As for power well I'm really just after 30mph and shitloads of torque.  12s4p with those motors should be enough.

```
just to give a bit more insight, sometimes factories will reduce quality after a certain reputation has been earned. Plenty of examples where initial batches of motors were using high temp expensive glue that was later swapped to inexpensive crap. The initial good reviews made sales sky rocket, after which they tried to play off reported failures as incidental once batch 3 or 4 were sent to customers. After the complaints went critical and had a big impact on sales, subsequent batches were improved again (brand RCX, multi-rotors). In a similar manner, bearings may be swapped out for different brands.

Same has happened with HK turnigy graphene lipos. There were subpar batches that all of the sudden could not handle the same amp draw.

Sometimes, resellers are not even informed of these changes.

In other words. Maytech & APS can be awesome one year and totally crap the next.
Same with ''diyeboard'' trucks, you name it. It applies to almost everything.

I bet you can buy those parts separately directly from the manufacturers. Only issue would be their minimum order quantity.
