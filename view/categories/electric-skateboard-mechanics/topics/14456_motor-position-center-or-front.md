I ask because my motor would end up hitting the kingpin if I mount it towards the middle.

you can move the motor out more to clear the kingpin. I can usually get better clearance with the motor inboard.

I've ran outboard on the back, you could do that too it just looks funny. and if your board gets lose the motor is taking the impact.
