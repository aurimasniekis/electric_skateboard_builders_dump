Hello I recent got my wheel pulley and I was testing it out putting it on the truck and it seems theres not a gap big enough? Here are some pictures tell me what you guys think. What is the solution here?

The trucks are Caliber 180
83mm wheels
Enertion Wheel Pulley

They are meant for longer axles like enertion trucks. You can grind some of the aluminum on the hanger to expose more axle like longhairedboy does

enertion sells trucks that work with this pulley, also the product page says that normal trucks need to be modified. there is a video showing it.

The width of a bearing ...just cut the aluminum around the steel axle ...and take it off ...hacksaw or dremel...

Takes a few more mins ...easy....

You should have one truck with a big hanger and another with a smaller (for the pulleys to be mounted)

Enertion didn't send to me the complete order, they told me that will send to me the missing parts in 10-20 days.

Over the Truck and 15T pulley I also miss SPACE and Fast Charger, hope they will read my email and will send the Truck & Pulley also!!!

Hang in there, your second truck and the rest will come eventually.
It's the same situation as I got my raptor. First the raptor, then 1,5 week after it the battery.
I'm a smoker, it's like having cigarettes without a lighter. Vice versa is less worse ^^

yep, you have them on the wrong truck. The rear truck will have either one or two "short" sides on the hanger. The axle is the same length on both front and rear trucks, but the amount of aluminum is less on the rear truck to make room for the pulley. 

I would advise against chopping that truck if you know you still have parts coming. One of those parts is probably the correct truck for those pulleys.

Don't chop it.... our truck factory screwed us.... so we are waiting on our narrow hanger trucks... we decided to send all the other parts to keep you busy.

Hi guys, 

I noted that with the 3rd bearing the wheel is dancing, removing it the wheel goes better and linear.

I've installed it on a Abec clone wheel but this happen with Enertion powerwheels also.

What do you think about removing the pulley and dremel the edges in the middle (the blue area) prolonging the cone, to let it fit with all trucks?

I think removing 1.5mm is enough, not too bad for the structure, it's also true that it will miss the support by the bearing then :D

or just add a bearing, it will act like a spacer.

same here, ordered a mono rspec and got a dual-chopped truck - good for a future update with a second motor.
btw i have received all the parts (including SCP4) but without the motor... very frustrating :grimacing:

I'm pretty sure they always come with both ends chopped. Just add a bearing spacer.

1) So what size trucks would I need on a dual raptor to upgrade to 12mm belts without cutting the rear truck? 
2) Does Enertion sell a rear truck for a dual raptor with 12mm belts?
```

Yes, Enertion sell the both chopped sides rear truck so is ready for dual drive. I have the mono so I had to add a bearing on the side without 3d 36t pulley

I wouldn't do it. 

the bearing is what holds the pulley flush against the wheel. Its a flanged bearing as you have probably noticed and when inserted correctly this pulley will rest its bearings against the wheel bearing and hold the pulley in place. Removing the center bearing and opening up the hole so that it can fit over the truck hanger will probably result in the pulley misaligning if not backing out while you are riding. It will likely begin to rub on the motor mounts and cause unusual wear patterns and cause the belt to travel and may result in belts skipping if not breaking altogether. This is why all of the pulleys that don't require truck modifications are the bolt through style. And given that the mold injection points are almost never ground off of these pulleys, it might actually hang up on the belt tension bolts and cause the wheel to lock up and street your face. 

I suppose you could use some kind of industrial strength epoxy to permanently bond the pulley to the wheel but then you can't just swap out your wheels which usually don't last as ling as these pulleys do in my experience.

Thank you for your advices and considerations, I won't remove the pulley, just added a bearing

I don't really like chopping trucks because of a pulley, so I've created my own pulley with aluminium, it seems to be aligned after 30km of tests, what do you think about the 3 bolts and not 6?
