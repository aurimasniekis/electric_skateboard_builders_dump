So while I was out riding I suddenly lost a huge amount of power, and the drive felt all skippy. As if the wheel was losing traction, even though I went on flat and dry asphalt. After coming home I noticed the belt making a weird slapping sound, as if it was loose. 

I have no idea what is causing this. Is it the belt being loose? I have had a loose belt before and it usually slips when braking, but I could brake without it slipping..

Looks too loose to me. Also make sure you didn't break a tooth on your belt or pulleys

I removed the wheel pulley and retightened the belt. Whatever it was, it is gone now :smile:
