Hello everyone!

I build custom fibreglass enslocures.
 -3-4 layers of fibreglass
 -they are waterproof
 -I can paint them to any color you like

You would probbably need to wait about 1 week for me to make it

Location: Osijek, Croatia (Europe)

1 enclosure -> 30e + shipping (about 10-15e to EU)
 -half when I start and half when I ship it

@DjamboBuksne I was wondering if you still sell the custom enclosures. And if it is possible to make an enclosure for a board with slightly more concave than the board on the pictures.

Since he doesn't have time, you should hit up @bigben, he makes the best enclosures around and doesn't charge like they are made of gold.

Good information. I will need a really big enclosure for a Lipo build soon.

@bigben : Are you in EU ? Can't find this info on your profile.
