So I have this problem with my belt and gears. The bolt that holds the motor gear on hits the belt and it is starting to shred it. The belt also will hit the wheel and squeak. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/e/ae882420e510418fe35fc36d19dfbb99f8b69e69.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/6/d69f0ddef36ff7b430e5480881126d8358fda3aa.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/4/e49f62d417ae23ae135f9a5af1eebae110eb69a1.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Flip the motor pulley around and move the mount closer to the wheel
