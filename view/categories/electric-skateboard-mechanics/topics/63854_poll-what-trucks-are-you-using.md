As the title suggests, it would be good to get an idea of what trucks are being used and in what capacity for future development. You can choose multiple options. If anything is missing let me know.

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=9 public=true]
* Caliber II
* TB 218
* Trampa
* Evolve
* Paris
* Ronin
* Surf Rodz
* Misc Clone truck

I feel like this needs a much bigger sample size, the amount of people using 218's on here is staggering just from seeing build threads and comments. Get voting please lady* and gents

haha, yes, how could you ignore? :smile:
Seriously, I just cloned a hanger from https://atlastruckco.com and left baseplate untouched.

Sometimes I'm really surprised there's not more people using surfrodz trucks.
But then I realized there's only like two people on this site making anything that will fit them.
It's surprising to me how many builds there are in the +$1400 range on $30 cast trucks.....

Availability is also an issue outside of the US. Compounded by the wait on mounts.

I'm in the UK so any surfrodz purchase plus mounts will cost me £80 in import duties and postage minimum - on top of the price of the trucks. I want to use them on this new hummie deck. Holding out for @Kug3lis precision trucks

Thats probably why there isn't enough interest to get them @kug3lis custom trucks for SR Base plates :disappointed_relieved:

I might end up having to grab a Tb218 truck for the rear if that won't be pushing through. Shipping to Asia is pricey at $40 for the trucks. Difficult to swallow for a single order :neutral_face:

yup you're correct but I was hoping to use my SR base plates with his gear drives and I'll need a different precision truck for it :persevere:

Edit:
Precision hangar to be exact

@Wraith Use the SR in the front,  get one of @Kug3lis hangers and all you need is a single caliber/tb/Randal baseplate.
You can get the Randal in 35° (perfect for the rear) for $14.
http://randal.com/comp-and-dh-35-base-plate/

*and your riptide pivot cups will fit that base plate as well

Thats a brilliant solution. I thought I’d have no other option but to either go with the SR compatible hangars or tb218s.

I’d be pretty annoyed if they di happen to produce them later but whatever gets me on the road faster is what I’ll go for

I didn’t know randal and tb/caliber baseplates had similar pivot cup shapes.

Hmmm I wonder if @kug3lis still has a spot for the GB precision hangars.

randal and tb/caliber baseplates
[/quote]

Yep, I think most guys running the torque board hangers are running them on caliber baseplates as they have a little less slop in them, plus that gives you more options when trying to set up proper split angles.

@squishy654 goes over it really well in this thread. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/split-truck-angles-wtf-are-they-and-why-should-i-care-and-other-stuff-about-trucks/57929
This is what I'm doing on here all day. Read every thing. I learn about 40% of what I read. Lol
Just keep reading till it starts to stick.

Any possible effects when running cast BP on precision hangars? 
Would like to know if it’s blasphemy to do so

As long as there's a quality cup in there I don't see why it would matter.
