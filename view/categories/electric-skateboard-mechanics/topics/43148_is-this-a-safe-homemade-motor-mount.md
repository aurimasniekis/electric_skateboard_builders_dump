Not what I would use for my expensive motors personally, but creative!

Only one way to find out.. Jk it actually looks really solid. How'd you make it? What material? 

And where did you find those sweet r-spec motors?

My uncle made it for me. I have not had a chance to talk with him as I just got it tonight and was working all today. I'll update you with the material.

I got the motors and trucks from someone on here early last year though.

Is that only one weld per side? if so is almost certain that it may bend or shear, but if in a future version you extend the motor mount and also do a top weld with the "L" profile the chances of working increase significantly due to reduced leverage

How thick are each part and what alloy did you used?

The metal pieces are 5 mm thick and Im not sure on the material. I will ask my uncle. What do you mean by extend the mount?

He also put a weld here:

It seems like a ton of work for a such an inexpensive part widely available, but the important thing here is you did it yourself so props to you for being creative!

Oh sorry, you already did what I suggested but on the other side, didn't see it before

Are the pieces considerably heavy? by the look of the weld and surface finish I'm almost certain that its all steel, if that's the case you are good

that's a serious mount. I don't think i've ever seen anything quite like that before. 

you may be able to find some original Enertion mounts on ebay as well if you ever decide to try them out.

You can do it on your carpet. Just stand on the board with loose trucks and lean back and forth. Check to make sure you don't have hard contact

it does not touch the ground but is really close to touching it, around a couple mm I would say.

yeah I feel that you may have something hit when you lean. it doesn't look like there is much clearance.
it looks like some really good work on the bracket, but perhaps needs a little more design work to be perfect.

I also gotta ask, how have you got enertion trucks, motors, belts and pulleys but no mounts?

I bought a enertion kit form someone who needed the trucks that came with it. I pulled out the ruler and the mount is 2.1-2.2 ish cm from the ground. I was worried that it might be to low.

I put the scale under where the mount is attached to the board and the scale read 9 pounds. So take that with a grain of salt. Haha

Your mount looks solid, like too solid. Props to thinking outside the box. But I think you may save yourself some headache later if you use a proven motor mount made for eskate.
