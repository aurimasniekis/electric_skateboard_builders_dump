So what Motor mount design is the dominant one right now.
I see all kinds of different ones what do you use and why?
What kind of mounts would you like to made available for cheap?

My Esc's are nearing completion so I want to tackle the next part or DIY long boards that I see as overpriced.

Would you like to see good Motor mounts for a decent price on amazon or do you like us keeping to ourselves?

I think Chaka aka Ollin boards has the best designed drive system out there currently.

Only way I could see to better it would be to use a helical or hypoid gear drive so you could get duel rear motors on a regular truck. Both solutions require machining of the truck or using a machined/precision hangar to get alignment.

But then again I like nice things, some one else will post up something cheap and simple and say that's the best... who is your market?

Price. Those UNIK ones are a bit expensive because it’s made in small batches. Beautiful mounts though.

@bimmer, hey
maybe your next project could be WHEEL PULLEYS ;)
For: ABEC11, Clones, Kegel/Popoca and MBS
If you manage to make them without the need of bolts and truck modifications, that would be very nice :slight_smile: 
BTW, @marcmt88 mounts are very good, i have custom one from him.

With the TB 218mm trucks and the Evolve Supercarve trucks, you can have both.  What you can't have at this point, is aluminum wheel pulley and no bolts.  We need that badly

```
The bolts create torque on the bearings in the way they are not strongest.

Putting a bearing inside the pulley and allowing it to ride on the axle transfers ONLY tangential/rotational force to the wheel and not radial forces and it's guaranteed the pulley is perfectly centered, causing less belt skipping under some conditions.

Also it just makes changing or cleaning the wheel and/or bearings super-easy.  Basically just a regular longboard wheel.

Metroboard sells [almost the thing we need](https://metro-board.com/shop/pulley-insert-for-abec-11-flywheels/).  It's so close, in fact, that I was thinking about modifying it with a drill press.  It's the only aluminum insert pulley I'm aware of, and it doesn't come in Kegel-style.

The only problem with it is it fills one of the wheel bearings with blank.  So instead of 2 wheel bearings and one pulley bearing, this has 1 wheel bearing and 1 pulley bearing.  That introduces radial forces again like bolts would and causes noise inside the wheel as the insert slips back and forth.

Plus, it's 19mm (for an 18mm belt) wide instead of 16mm (for a 15mm belt) although that can easily be fixed with a belt/disc sander

No @BoostedBuilder, Evolve Super Carves don't come with longer axles. They are in fact kinda short. Like 32 mm. Whilst TB axles are 47 mm each.

The TB 218 trucks have 48mm of axle while the Supercarve trucks have 55mm of axle, part of which is 10mm diameter.

The last 10mm of both are threaded.  So the Supercarve actually have the longest axles

@bimmer, there are no actual complete aluminum wheel pulleys (with sprockets) in the market for MBS....and I think neither for Kegel or Clones. I think @chaka 's pulleys are for ABEC 97 mm and Popocas 90 mm. Except for other isolated examples like Metroboards pulleys, there are nothing like that in the market for most wheel types. 

**WE WANT THIS**... :point_down:

For the the thing we are discusing here, yes. The usable part of the Evolve axle is just 32 mm, is the 8 mm diameter where the wheel sits. The remaining 10 mm diameter section is where the pulley sits using its own bearing. In that regard the Evolve axle is longer. But comparing the usable 8 mm section with other axles, the supercarve axle is short with 32 mm. TB on the other hand sports a full lenght 47 mm axle (8 mm diameter)

Yes, but you can just use 10mm "6900ZZ" bearings anywhere you could use 8mm skateboard bearings so the diameter change is not too important

@bimmer, if you are going to do your homework, suggest you do it right.  You need to come with the three most comon widths **9**, **12** and **15 mm** wide pulleys and from those you need to offer **36T**, **40T** and **44T** and youll cover all the bases.

**36T** is almost like a standard....good speed and decent torque (for hills)
**40T** is most torque and decent speed ...is like the oposite of the 36T
**44T** is for the extremist who want lots of torque ...for lots of hills (San Fran, Denver, Baldwin, Lake Como, etc)

as for inventory and offering I could say the **15 mm** will fullfil the 75% of the users needs and taste
the remaining 25% divided between **9 mm** and **12 mm** wide pulleys.

Normally what they do is producing the pulley with **1 mm** extra. If you do a 9 mm belt width is a **10 mm** pulley, an so on... **13 mm** and **16 mm** pulleys.

Credit where credit is due. My American brother has already designed a kick ass drive system with all the features you guys keep pointing to... yeah it has that extra bearing & it uses std width trucks hence has, faster steering response, more grip... plus what the queen pin of ronin trucks adds to no axle walk...

see that extra bearing?

no need to bolt up the pulley...

apart from drive systems I have already committed to, that's my next drive system (and there is another out there about to come to the party I'm on board with already).  Looks tough too, vented and fluted to dissipate heat as well as great design. 

Ollin, JensoBro are tied with different type products, okp comes in third (sorry bro).

[/quote]
Can you explain this a little more. I don't see how the bolts create an extraneous torque on the bearings.

[quote="b264, post:22, topic:47109"]
So instead of 2 wheel bearings and one pulley bearing, this has 1 wheel bearing and 1 pulley bearing.  That introduces radial forces again like bolts
[/quote]

Radial forces on the bearings?? You are applying a force tangent to the outside of the pulley on a plane perpendicular to the axle. There are no radial forces on the bearing from this. The only radial force on the system is the weight of the rider acting through the wheel.

The only reason you need 2 bearings is so that the wheel rotating axis stays in line with the axle itself and you dont get a wobble from there. A third bearing might even be considered detrimental as if the axle is not perfectly straight or your wheel core and pulley are not perfectly aligned so that they share the same axis of rotation, the third bearing would be over-constraining the assembly and applying a radial force on one of the other two bearings and bending moment on the axle. Essentially, you would have them fighting each other to keep their axis of rotation aligned with the axle and with enough time and fatigue, the axle would bend to conform to such constraints or one of the bearings will fail.

The best possible way to do it, is the way metroboards did, by placing the two bearings as far away from each other as possible so that any misalignments are averaged over a longer distance and have a much smaller impact on the system.

[quote="b264, post:22, topic:47109"]
causes noise inside the wheel as the insert slips back and forth
[/quote]

The wheel is slipping back and forth axially on the pulley? If this is the case then the issue lies with the spacers. The only time I have had this issue is when I bought some really cheap wheels whose core were thinner than a standard spacer width, so when installed, my wheel could slide a little back and forth until it hit either bearing. This was particularly annoying when carving as I could feel my wheels popping side to side between bearings. I resolved it by cutting down my spacer until it was the exact width as the wheel core.

That is probably the issue with the metroboards pulley. If they don't have a spacer wide enough to sit between the two bearings without touching anything else then when you tighten your wheel, you are tightening the nut on the axle to the inner race, through the ball bearings (bad as you apply an axial force), to the outer race, then through the wheel core, then through the pulley, to the outer race of the inner bearing, through the inner bearings (bad again), through the inner race and then to the speed ring and hangar.

If they had the appropriate spacer and they might (I dont own any of their stuff) then when you tighten the wheel, the loads go through the inner race of the outer bearing, through the spacer and then the inner race of the inner bearing, to speed ring and hangar. A much simpler load path and better for the system itself.

I agree those are some fine parts. But I am thinking more about people who are interessted into getting into this hobby and less about those so addicted that 500$ just for the drive system seem fine.

Lets think more someone has a caliber truck. We dont want him buying the china htd3 pulley kits and complain 3 weeks down the road because his mount spun of the truck or his belts are skipping.

Of course we can design enthusiast parts but I am thinking more of an affordable diy foundation.

I can draw you crappy picture.  See illustration A.

Then why would you continue to go on about how I am "wrong" when you don't even understand and you know that you don't understand?  Maybe wait for an answer?

[quote="PXSS, post:59, topic:47109"]
The only radial force on the system is the weight of the rider acting through the wheel.
[/quote]

Then, at a minimum, no force is keeping the belt tight... which is untrue.

[quote="PXSS, post:59, topic:47109"]
The only reason you need 2 bearings is so that the wheel rotating axis stays in line with the axle itself and you dont get a wobble from there. A third bearing might even be considered detrimental as if the axle is not perfectly straight or your wheel core and pulley are not perfectly aligned so that they share the same axis of rotation, the third bearing would be over-constraining the assembly and applying a radial force on one of the other two bearings and bending moment on the axle. Essentially, you would have them fighting each other to keep their axis of rotation aligned with the axle and with enough time and fatigue, the axle would bend to conform to such constraints or one of the bearings will fail.
[/quote]

I know how skateboard wheels work.  This is all only true if the pulley is bolted to the wheel, which we are explicitly talking about NOT having in this whole conversation.  It's literally the entire point, having a floating pulley, and it went over your head.  You're talking about a system where the wheel and pulley components are treated as a single immutable and inflexible piece... which is just not what we have here.  Picture something more like big abacus beads next to each other... except two of them have teeth that mesh together with one another

[quote="PXSS, post:59, topic:47109"]
The best possible way to do it, is the way metroboards did, by placing the two bearings as far away from each other as possible so that any misalignments are averaged over a longer distance and have a much smaller impact on the system.
[/quote]

Actually, this way is crap.  There is constant movement because the pulley insert itself is supporting the rider weight via friction.  The way Evolve does it is much better, *if it wasn't for them using shitty plastic instead of aluminum*... Picture a very slight transition from illustration B to illustration C and back again, while going over bumps.  Because there is a twisting force on the pulley inserts against the wheel hub, caused **because the weight-supporting middle bearing (black) has been removed**.  That means the pulley inserts are now holding your weight against the wheel hub.  You can hear this as it wiggles sometimes and it's also *why they lubricate the inside of the wheel hub spokes with grease and have a video on how to do the lubrication yourself.*  Otherwise the constant movement creates noise.

[quote="PXSS, post:59, topic:47109"]
The wheel is slipping back and forth axially on the pulley?
[/quote]

No, the wheel is twisting on the inserts radially to the pulley....  (ignore rest of paragraph)

You do get a set on machined ronin trucks in the deal also. Have you ever ridden a set of ronin trucks bimmer? sweet af dude... I have a set of ronin precision billet trucks, they cost me $500 and I got no engine mounts... 

Couldn't be happier with the purchase, still make me smile every time I ride them.

But I do get you, they are still the best mounts out there though.

Brings you back to doing a plate style engine mount like marcmt88 &okp with a bolt on truck bracket. You could improve it my adding a cross brace like okp, & make it look better with good design and anodizing like okp. Any features beyond that will hike the price...

Because nobody has been able to produce these pulleys entirely in 3D Nylon (with Carbon inserts) in great quantities and in a single piece (capable of holding its on bearing) with full length spokes that runs all the way thru the wheel's hub. So, is obvious there is a bottleneck somewhere that people have been unable to overcome. Therefore we ask..... please, give us a full length spoked wheel pulley made of aluminum (specially for MBS, ABEC, Kegel & Clones) and skip the crap for once and for all with these generic thingiverse or printed plastic pulleys made of multiple individual components (tooth pulley, bolts, retainers, etc).

So the extraneous load is being applied by the belt tension? Why not use a motor mount with idlers so you can run your belt looser as to not apply such a high load on the pulley.

Which part of my comment specifically do you think is untrue?
If the pulley is inserted correctly into the wheel, regardless of it being bolted or not, any misalignment between the two pieces or slight bend in the axle will cause the assembly to be over constrained with three bearings. 

[quote="b264, post:71, topic:47109"]

[quote="b264, post:71, topic:47109"]
abacus beads next to each other… except two of them have teeth that mesh together with one another
[/quote]
So a non press fit. That is very different from what has been said before and even the metroboards one. Most of the pulleys are press fit and act more as a single object rather than two since they cannot move with respect to each other. 

[quote]
This machined Aluminum Pulley Insert can be ***pressed into*** the hub of an off-the-shelf Abec-11 Flywheel with a diameter of 83 mm, 97 mm, or 107 mm, turning it into a Metroboard Outrunner Compatible Drive Wheel. 
[/quote]
It literally says "pressed in" on their description so can we stop the anonymity?

[quote="b264, post:71, topic:47109"]

[/quote]
So essentially, the fit and the assembly isn't good or rigid enough to not deform when going over bumps and stuff. 

---
So what you want is a pulley that is for all purposes, mounted on the axle and not the wheel. Then use spokes on it to transfer the torque over to the wheel with none of the other side effects. 

You need an axle that is looong for this. So this would really only work with a select few trucks or trucks would need to be modded to work with these pulleys. A meetier axle might also be required. 

I have to go but I think we can design something based on this that isn't very expensive to machine

This is okay because the pulley is completely free to insert and uninsert itself at-will, just like two neighboring abacus beads that have meshing teeth on them.

[quote="PXSS, post:92, topic:47109"]
So a non press fit.
[/quote]
**It is a press-fit.**   But nothing holds it in except some friction.  It's free to come out.  You can grab the wheel and pull it off.  The idea is if your setup depends on that friction level to be high, like the metroboard pulley that's missing the third bearing, then it's not ideal.  The amount of friction holding it (or the axle diameter, for that matter) in should not be relevant in a better design, like the Evolve ones.

There will be no confusion if you've seen Evolve pulleys before.  Basically those pulleys in METAL is exactly what we need.  **Either Aluminum, Magnesium, or Titanium.**  Bonus points for a kegel-style version.  More bonus points for a clone-hub version or one that fits ABEC11 *and* clone hubs.

Yes, exactly :slight_smile: 

We already have two great trucks that work fine.  The Torqueboards 218mm trucks and the Evolve Supercarve rear trucks both have super-long axles for powered drive wheels.  The Supercarve axles are longer slightly but aren't as good at speeds over ~28mph.

Idlers are fixed (although their effectivness maybe compensated with the horizontal motor mounting slots travel); using 107 mm wheels on that mount are questionable even without the idlers. 5 mm thickness at the motor mount position are kind of weak. You need at least 8 mm there.

dude then you’re gonna have like 200mm of axle exposed, itll snap the second you step on it

you really don’t think there’s a reason mounts are designed the way they are?

they’re only exposing an extra 10-15mm. in order for your design to work you’d need to expose and extra 50-60mm...

dude you’re just dead wrong 🤣

take the width of a wheel (approx. 50mm) then add the width of a 15mm pulley (approx 20mm. and add them, you would need to expose approx 50mm of axle to fit your badly designed mount + drive wheel on.

I think it can be done by removing 30mm material, however the mount will also support the truck axle :slight_smile:

I get the feeling you kinda don't like me :sob:

Because you're clearly not educated enough about trucks to be putting up an argument. That and the fact that you can't seem to take any kind of criticism. @GrecoMan is giving you true shit, so how about you open ur mind up a little and not call it "fake news"

Calm down kids, this is about trucks. Let the trial and error begin and test it in the real world, when it fails the losers can eat crow and the winners can gloat...but not till then, till then you work and argue together cuz in reality, no one knows till it's tested..attack the idea, not the person..It's way more fun to tell someone they are wrong when you have proof in you hands...and maybe a beer for the loser to drink as you bag on him...but.not until someone tries it..otherwise.its all just words and numbers and guesses..

@e.board_solutions if I understand your concept right you would need to remove at least 30 mm of the hanger material to fit in a 15 mm belt with pulley and some extra space. I am highly skeptical this would work, maybe for a while but a jump on the board, a kerb or similar will bend the axle eventually. You may regain some strength fitting the tube around the axle but surely not what the hanger was designed for!

Tbh, I don't think there is need for another mount that looks similar to the 10 that already exist.

what if used something like...
iglide® J260-PF (filament for 3D printing, "igus.com")
to  form a ball bearing (around the hanger) that inserts into the aluminum pulley. 
 would give you the entire axle to do as you please and not have to do something sketchy like cut a bunch of the hanger off

would kinda need to know what kind of temps regular ball bearings currently used on esk8's achieve... cause i don't know that info :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

The Caliber hanger itself is quite rough. I wouldn't even assume that the hanger shape is inline with the hanger axle. Better stick the hanger onto a lathe and remove material until you obtain a concentric geometry.

Can someone suggest a way to fit a 8mm core pulley on my 8mm shaft motor? The shaft is totally clean and i don't think that the two bolts of the pulley can hang on so tight. Do i have to drill the shaft where the bolts touch it?

Do you have a flat spot on the motor shaft?  If not, get one.  Use loktite on the set screws.  Failing all of that...green loktite, it'll never move again.

## \#146 Posted by: Grozniy Posted at: 2018-03-01T23:05:31.701Z Reads: 167

To explain a little better:
-file the shaft with a Dremel or hand file
-use loctite 243
-use knurled grub screws
```

Or don't file anything and just glue it on with loctite 648.

The shaft doesn't have a flat spot. I will try to file it and use loctite. If that doesn't work, I will make a flat spot and see what happens. The motor came with a spare shaft, so if I screw this up, I can change it. Thank you all.

Evolve has pulleys available on their site. With pulleys like this, do bolts still have to be used to fasten them together? Since the lock nut from the truck is holding it in.

You won't damage it but I strongly suggest against it as you won't be able to change pulleys anymore for whatever reason and changing out your motor bearings if they go bad would be nearly impossible.
