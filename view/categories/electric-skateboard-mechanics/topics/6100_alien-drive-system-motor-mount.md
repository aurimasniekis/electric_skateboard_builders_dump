Hi, I'm looking for ADS mootor mount users, I was wondering if the 15mm belt mod required some modification on the trucks ? 
Are you satisfied with the 15x32T pulley ratio they offer ?
Also do you know other motor mounts providers than Enertion, DIY, Psychotiller, ADS ?

At DIY, we offer 13T/16T w/ 36T for 12mm width belts. 12mm seems more then adequate. You might be able to fit 15mm but it runs close with a dual rear setup. We will have 40T and 18T available in the future.

@crameur - Keyway's typically come with the motor. I don't send the pulleys out with keyway.

If you could offer me a solution to pay with my credit card without using paypal I'd be happy to.
