```
After riding the raptor 2 hubs on 12S (up from 10S originally) and prolly harder than I should I noticed that the hanger was to hot to touch. This was only after like 10minutes of riding and up some not to steep hills of 1-2km. I have the Motor amps set at 60A and battery at 40A running sensored FOC with escape and a 12S4P samsung 30Q battery.

I then decided that I had to make a custom hanger with more alu, bigger cooling fins for increased surface area and bigger area towards the hubs to absorb heat from the hubs better. I designed and milled these over the last two days. I'm new to cnc machining so it's a rough prototype with some machining errors that I'll sort out later. Also I don't know much about hangers/skating in general so if you see anything stupid don't hesitate to tell me cause I prolly don't know that I do something stupid :D Any helpful design tips is also welcome. I'm guessing that if this design can be improved further it can cope with more amps :roll_eyes:  

These images are done approx 15-20 minutes after riding. The ones with custom trucks where taken 12-13 minutes after riding and that was after riding a lot harder. The shots on the stock trucks was after consuming 58Wh and the custom ones I consumed 89Wh and had much more full throttle pulls. It does look like it helped a lot and I noticed it very good when riding that I can now touch the truck without burning my hands but with the stock I couldn't hold it comfortably.

The last shot of the motor at 63¬∞C is after going uphill hard on the throttle for the third time on the same hill. After doing that hill two times with stock hanger I couldn't hold the truck. Now the hanger is warm like the motor but it doesn't show on the thermal images as I forgot to bring tape and alu is reflecting to much throwing the camera off ^^

No not yet at least. Need more testing to see if it works good and maybe someone comes with good tips in this thread on how to improve it even further for better heat transfer/removal so we can push more amps through these beasts :D I don't have anodizing equipment either so they need to be painted or anodized by someone that can do that else they won't hold up to water and dirt.

I think it's even more since I measured this with shorter time than last time and that I pushed way harder. First time I only did two pulls up that hill and now I did 3 pulls. And I hit 51km/h vs 42 last time + generally harder riding.

Vesc has a temp sensor input among the hall sensor pins. Should be easy to cobble together (compared to hulking the hanger) and you'll have numbers to compare.

Btw... wtffffff lol! Great job! It's like the bad iron man from the first movie.

I think that was while going flat. With the current limits at 60motor amps I think 50km/h going uphill with a 100kg rider is mission impossible :D I never tested it but this  thing is quick. If the heat issue can be addressed I think it's possible to increase it over 60 motor amps and get more action. I wonder what they state as a max limit for temperature on these motors.

I like the idea of copper to transfer the heat but I‚Äôm not sure on how to use this idea here since the axles are thin already so I can‚Äôt fit thinner axles to have a copper tube around them here.

you can keep trying to get rid of the sag, but it will never leave you now guy

focus on getting a real battery first, preferably get a boosted extended battery and retro-fit it into your board.. at least then it will have more range.

I‚Äôm doing some small changes to the design and might give it a go to produce a few of them for other ppl to test. Was just wondering if I should make more room around the bushing or is it fine as it is? I suspect that it might allow for to little steering for lighter riders.. Look at pictures in first post.

Also going to make straight fins as I don‚Äôt believe it helps much to angle them towards the motor. Main concern should be to absorb heat from the motor through increased surface area and then getting the heat from the hanger by air cooling.

changed 1/4th of the design to show the difference. 

-The square that goes into the hub is now increased in size from 11.95mm to 12.00mm for a tighter fit to the hub. Stock one is 11.9mm but there is room for tighter fit.
-fins are now going in airflow direction. this also increase surface area against the hub to allow for more contact/heat transfer 
-increased the width around the bushing by 2mm to allow for more space around it if you want to carve a lot. 
-decreased machine time some. It's down to 2hours + 6 setups with micrometer now. I will prolly use total 5-6 hours to make one hanger so this still isn't doable for production but if things works out I can make jigs and machine more units at the same time to cut down on the total. Boring stuff I guess but important if there is any point in making them. 
-thoughts for later is making chamfers around the model but for now I'll leave it rough.

To increase contact area with motor end those fins earlier. Also this slot for wires takes out some contact area but I understand that it have to be that way? Love this project ;)
```

Will look into that. 

Yes that damn slot has to be there :( The wires exits there out from the hub motor so it needs somewhere to go. I could lead out the wires earlier and make space for some fins at the top there but the problem is that I can't have long stickout on the 2mm endmill making the slots since it doesn't take much before I get chatter and have to slow down on that endmill. I'm experimenting now on increasing the speed 200% on the 2mm slotting to lower machine time. All the other work that is done with 10mm endmill can be roughed at a massive pace so the 2mm is what's slowing this down.

I removed one cooling fin as @LukePL suggested now for the next prototype. Milling as we speak :) 

I hope I can make them for sale but I can‚Äôt promise a bargain price :( I‚Äôm constantly adjusting to make it machine as quick as possible but those cooling fins are a killer timewise to make since I have to use a so small end mill. They are 50% of the machine time as things are today. 

Can I ask what cnc machined hangers go for? It‚Äôs kinda hard to compare tho as a normal cnc machined hanger does not have the hub mount or the cooling implemented.

I don't. In general I know  very little about longboarding :P These have kinda the same geometry as the stock ones so they should fit the stock baseplate. Maybe a final version will get a new baseplate to go with it but for now it's just the hanger and I made it to get heat away to save the motors when pushing limits :D

Have you considered adding some kind of thermal paste or adhesive between the hub and the hanger? It might improve heat transfer further.

Second prototype done. Quicker but still way to much machine time.

And some more pics. More space for the bushing on this one and more surface area against the hub. Took a picture for @LukePL to see why the slot has to be there.

Will try that on the next one. Hope I'll be able to adjust slightly and make another one tonight. First one I need to open open the hole around the bushing a bit to allow for some more movement since I think this next one was a lot better at that. Should also add some chamfer to the edges since it's pretty sharp to hold/grab as it is now. 

I still don't know if it's worth making for sale since it just is to much machine time but just to gauge interest.. Is there any interest in raw prototypes like this without anodizing for $100? Shipping is $19 world wide/$15 Europe.

Sounds good. Not doing a group buy. Will keep testing various design and try to improve and sell the working ones :) The first one is to thight on the bushings so I will keep this and mill it out after my vacation for my own use ^^ 

Been milling and designing all day and got two hangers ready for shipping. Think both is taken tho (sent PM) but I‚Äôll do some more after my vacation and maybe some wider if there is demand for that. 

Would be interesting to get some feedback on the current ones tho. They work fine in my baseplate but I don‚Äôt have a raptor baseplate to test with..

Nice progression, how much they weight? and the original one? I think that if weight is an issue, you can lower the overall dimensions and make the fins thinner, keeping the surface area, the problem is that if they are to thin any rock will bend them

I didn‚Äôt check. It‚Äôs def heavier than the stock ones but alu isn‚Äôt that heavy. 

The fins are now 2mm wide both spacing and inside. I cut them with a 2mm endmill. I don‚Äôt want to go lower than that since it will increase the time by a lot on my old slow machine (don‚Äôt have a fancy 30k rpm spindle). The rocks was my main concern also. When I made the fins 3mm deep they will handle less stress from stones and debris. Could always make it thinner between them but isn‚Äôt there that much to be gained? Would have to calculate surface area and check. 

Another thought I had was to drill many holes that goes straight trough the hanger but since people are running them in different angles that might not work very good. 

If everyone want a wider truck that will help increasing the surface area as long as the truck can transfer the heat towards the center. 6061 alu has good heat transfer and from my tests the hanger got even temperature over the whole hanger and that‚Äôs promising for a wider model.

Like you can see more people than me experience a to hot to touch hanger so they kinda solved the problem with transferring heat out to the hanger. 

I think that if we can improve removal of heat from the hanger it will help a lot for the motors and we might be able to push it even harder. Not saying it‚Äôs solved as good as it can be yet but I def think we are onto an improvement. Would really love to see if a wider axle would help since it would increase the surface even more.

> There is a lot of wiggle room in what is determined to be the overheat temperature of a motor. In practice, most better quality motors have high temperature enamel on the copper windings and can survive excursions in the 150-180 oC temperature range without damage. But few would suggest having the rated continuous core temperature be this hot. So what do you choose, 100oC? 120 oC? The choice of maximum temperature will have a large effect on the rated continuous power number.

Source: http://www.ebikes.ca/learn/power-ratings.html

It's about e-bike hubs. Shouldn't our Raptor 2 hubs be able to sustain the same temperature? Anything below 100 Celsius should be fine if the richt glue/epoxy etc. has been used. I've also never heard about anyone frying their Raptor 2 hubs.

Is temperature really a problem on our Raptor 2 hubs?

if you know what the wire was rated to as you say that would reveal one limit but the magnets as well have a limit that's probably a much lower temp.    worth finding out what temp they are rated but its not revealed.  

bearing grease will vaporize at 100c unless its rare high heat grease

electrical resistance goes up with temp so you will get less range and also have a snowball effect as it goes up in temp.   Ive heard 140f as a reasonable max temp for outrunner motors.  That's not based on anything other than whatever people feel like doing and you can go at a much higher temp if you have the right magnets and enameled wire and heat resistant grease.
but maybe the urethane is the first to go.

A 218mm hanger would be cool, then it would match with the very popular torquboards 218 hanger.  But you might as well make it 220mm. 

Gives you an extra 40mm of surface to use if the current is sized to 180mm.

I guess if you need more cooling you could use some of this area? Though it might start to look like a George Foreman grill.  :cut_of_meat:

Well the thing Hummie said (more heat = less range) already persuaded me :smiley: My interest is still sparked, and i'll follow any updates here.

My friend Joris drove his Raptor 2 full to empty in 12 KM's  a while back going full throttle against very very strong wind. Can't imagine the hub motor temps reached. I fried an xt60 connector with very strong wind on my Ownboard. So I guess wind can be worse than hills because wind can be sustained during your whole ride. Unless your gone climb the mount everest.

There is some sacrifices that are done one the prototypes to keep machining quick and simple. When and if there is a final design I can spend more time on esthetics and toolpaths to make it look more like an production unit. It might never come to this tho as it was really only meant to be a hanger for myself :p 

If I can cut production time when a ‚Äúfinal‚Äù design is around I can order special tooling to do the radius we want on it and optimize stuff more so it looks nicer :)

Why did not you make a wider truck? That Enertion truck is too narrow! :anguished: It almost look like one of those used for downhill. While you are at it, why don't you make a larger one, a really wide truck? If you do, you'll take the Raptor to another level. At the moment it looks ridiculously narrow with those beefy wheels. Right now, Raptor looks odd.... and unstable. Why continue with that trend? Come out of the box. Your truck is incredible, but still narrow as the original one. Take a chance and you'll do a killing. :ok_hand::grinning:

Anything above 200mm is good. Below that is like you never came from downhill longboarding. Wider trucks are always a must in Electric Skateboarding, because almost always you need to position motors at hanger's ends, on motor mounts, in between axels, not so much in your case because you will use hub motors so distance in between axles is non important, but still the wheels are too close together (and your truck will be too narrow). 

Wider trucks are favorites among Esk8ers. Take a look at popular trucks here.... Torqueboards 218 truck, well, is just that, a 218mm wide truck, not counting their axles; Evolve supercarve truck is about 240mm wide (306mm with the axles); one of the most popular, the SurfRodz, the RKP truck version, it also comes in 200mm wide without the axles. These are all very popular trucks here.

**Torqueboards 218**

...you can even fit iside this truck two of the most (if not the most) popular motors in the Esk8 universe, the Turnigy SK3...

With a Wider truck you will gain more highspeed stability. 
Large trucks are just preferred by esk8er because they can fit our beefy 6374 Motors!

It does Not need to be wider than the Normal one. I have no problems running the r2 at 32 mph with loose trucks. But every one has to decide on their own if they need more stability or just train more.

I just figurd that the trend is towards as narrow trucks as possible. The wider ones are to clear motors that are not a issue here. It can get the deck lower tho since wheelbite won‚Äôt be such a big problem. But no problem to make it wider. I‚Äôll try to make the next one 20mm wider so it matches a 200mm wide truck. I fear that making it wider so you need a torquebords truck to match the rear will lock it to just one brand.

maybe you could make the hanger aluminum get wider at the motor for more contact. its super beefy and a great heatsink but surely getting the heat from the motor to it is the bottleneck.  if you made the last little bit of the hanger so wide as to contact the whole blue aluminum part i wonder how that would go.  Maybe going wider there where they butt would give more support too.  i think it would look cool with more of an integration as well.  futuristic.

i see it is really wide there already and you'd have to go from the rectangular to a round shape to get more contact.   seems worth it to me.   and of course a bunch of thermal paste between the two and all along the axle inside maybe you could transfer to the steel too.


maybe too big a challenge but with the grooves in the blue part on the motor, if you could have your hanger cut to even get in there that would be awesome for transfer.   maybe it would rattle.   didnt read the whole thread maybe im doing repeats![image|375x500](upload://yTJ0j3jJHHon4YTzdNV1gUpQ6oN.jpg)

_Surf Rodz 200 RKP_.............  **200mm** (plus 60mm axles - 30mm each axle) .... **260mm**

Any takers for a equivalent of 200mm wide hanger (20mm wider than stock) if I make one? Would be as above $100 + shipping. I need to hear back from @SeanHacker first tho just to make sure there is no issues that should be addressed since I don‚Äôt have a raptor to test fit on.. 

I‚Äôve gotten some miles on my first prototype now on my vacation and I haven‚Äôt seen any issues yet. All this talk about a wider kinda make me want one myself so I might produce one anyways. 

Just a thought here... can we split the hanger in 3 pieces so that the center part is similar for all widths and then have swappable ends that can be in various width and with/without rake? I haven‚Äôt seen it done before so maybe it‚Äôs just a stupid idea, but with a 30mm wide truck as this I don‚Äôt see a big issue with the strength..

@Hummie I tried to maximize it with the stock I had that‚Äôs a 100x30mm flat bar. It‚Äôs 30mm wide as it is so would need to increase stock size to make it bigger contact area. Not impossible but a lot of material waste when machining. I think I will look into if I can increase the height of it tho since there is more height to go on and maybe fill in the grooves like you suggest.

Once I get the hanger I'll test it as best I can. We have some unusually hot weather right now (90F and into triple digits this week). I'll best testing stock setup, then your hanger in a two day session to make it fair. I don't have a thermometer or anything. But I'll use @Ackmaniac's app to check motor temps. I'd be down for a wider hanger also. Most likely two to match. Just gotta try and convince the fiance to let me spend the money. I'm an esk8 addict and I'm not rich. Lol. ;)

For some reason I thought I remember him saying his app supports motor temp. But I could be wrong as I've never checked before. I also thought the R2 wpuld have the sensor wire to support it. If not. It's just another stupid mistake that Enertion has made. I'll get more info later on that. If it doesn't. I'll just go by a cheap thermometer from home depot or something to make sure I get some sort of definitive info.

P.S.- You're right. No temp sensor wire. For some reason I thought I saw 6 earlier. Fuck. Thermometer it is then.

I know it‚Äôs steep :frowning: I‚Äôll try to work some more on optimizing stuff but I‚Äôm struggling with high costs in Norway and since I try to run a business it‚Äôs not a great idea to sell with a loss.. I ordered new tooling for this project now from G√ºhring for $450 so hoping things will speed up ;) 

A front hanger will be a lot cheaper since it doesn‚Äôt need to be this bulky and have the detailed fins. Not sure if that‚Äôs worth it tho since surfrodz already make some dope stuff at the needed width.

Btw, anyone know where to source good 12.9 M8x1.25 axles? Haven‚Äôt measured but would guess on smt with 60mm stickout and 20mm threads. Similar style to the stock one would be best. Just want to have some to not have to move around on mine all the time ^^

I think that is to little heat sink. The whole hanger hit like 50-60 degrees when riding so it transfers to it and all the area on the hanger is good for transferring it from the alu to air again. Reducing it to only out at the wheels will most likely (guessing here) make things worse again.

The idea is great for meeting with the hub yeah. But extending the axle will be a problem I think. There have been many cases of the 12.9 (equivalent) stock raptor axle breaking/bending and extending it won‚Äôt exactly help.

Extending the current acle by 40mm up to 220mm "equivalent". Wonder how this thing is gonna ride. The contours shows how much it's extended by. Also increased the height so it goes all the way up on the motor. I didn't make it round yet just to keep it simple  to machine. Round will happen once we settle on a design :P

Going good @Minim !! Like how you extended the hanger. It was 180mm before, right? That is what I understand; you added 40mm and now is 220mm. I encourage you to add 20mm more. Go to 240mm and then you'll got a winner carvy truck. It will look awesome with the 100mm R-SPEC Crossover Rear Wheels. Because right now with their current truck they look narrowly odd under the R2..... :point_down::confused:

Have you tried adding thermal paste yet? I saw a comment about it earlier but no results. I‚Äôm not sure how familiar you are with it, but basically all surfaces have a rough texture even if it looks smooth, so metal to metal contact is very limited. The idea of thermal paste is it fills the valleys in with a heat conductive material and is able to transfer that heat to the sinking material much more efficiently. I imagine you can see great cooling increases by adding paste. Also, not all pastes are created equal, computer modders will often change paste and see good temp drops between different brands.

maybe forget the attempt at a good physical contact between the motor's blue aluminum and the hanger and instead design the hanger so the phase wires go through it and transfer the heat that way.  Surely they will be hotter than the blue aluminum, which has it's heat largely from that transferred from the wire, to the stator, and then finally to the blue aluminum, and then the attempt to get it to the hanger

3 holes on each side of the hanger that the wires would go through, but its hard to find an electrical insulator but good thermal conductor that would be between the wires and hanger.  It's hard to find a material that is both.  And this would make the design more reliable as those wires break.

i tired thermally conductive silicone to make wires but its much weaker than typical and not that great a thermal conductor anyway.  
a super thin insulator maybe
and then how to get the wire in and so tight as to be making the best physical contact.  i dont think just routing multistrand wires through a hole will be good.  the thermally conductive silicone wouldve been ideal in filling all the spaces between the wire and hanger.   trying to get a solid wire in there with the thin insulator might be good if there is a really tough electrical insulator could be painted thinly in the holes and the solid thick copper were pushed through tightly.
i think finding that electrical insulator and thermal conductor and how it works would decide the design.

Gonna complete my wide truck tomorrow and check that out if the weather allows for it. I have an issue with my CAM software that makes the cutting path for the hanger. It crashed two times and made ugly marks in this hanger and this doesn‚Äôt show in simulation. When I did a similar op on the other side it crashed on the exact same spots. Will speak to Autodesk tomorrow and try to sort it out before I break anything. Scary shit when simulation is buggy like that especially when a crash can easy cost the same as a decent second hand car.

Completed the wide version today even if I had some crashes and funny toolpaths on this one. Atleast I didn't ruin a mill or anything other when it happend. For CNC geeks like me the reason for the crash is that on Fanuc controls if you do small arc moves it can misunderstand the command and do a full circle of that arc instead of just 0.02mm. Increased minimum arc lenght to 0.1mm now and crossing my fingers. First time I've seen this.. I've marked the crashes in one of the pictures. Pivot pin also got a weird mark.. 

I think I will go down on the width tbh. Maybe back to stock or something inbetween at equivalent of a 200mm wide one.

I just bought a generic 10k from ebay. haven't tested it yet tho but I will get on it now. Is it worth the PITA it is to remove the old silicone/sealant and try to get a new wire inside the motor? I mean.. I'm just going to use it as a reference on how good/bad the hangar is. 

I did some really steep hills today that required max throttle for 30secs (60amp continuous) and after a few times up the hill the whole hanger and the motor is again almost to hot to touch.. Ambient today was 32degres celcius in the shadow and I was testing in the sun on black new asphalt so might not have been the best day to test. This was not with the wide hanger that I just made tho. Def need these sensors to get proper testing since it's impossible to gauge it and with so many variables changing all the time..

If people are going all out with this I would suggest to use a heatpipe for extracting more heat from the mount .. or hub, or direct drive.. can be adapted for anything really. The pipes could be secured from top with some plates, but not covering the  whole surface, to leave at least some copper space in contact with the airflow.

I drew a quick mockup for the more visual folks:
edit: I realize it would be better to have the condensation end running along the slanted side of the hanger, but somehow the heatpipe diagram i saw was showing to use the condensation end in a lower position (height-wise) for some reason, even if it would make more sense to do otherwise, ya know, evaporate rises- condenses - gravity helps to drive it to the hot end. Maybe it was shown the opposite just to demonstrate how the commercial heatpipes use a porous material in the inner surface that can help transport the coolant against gravity. Ok I am rambling now. stop it, me. Anyways, the heatpipe can be even made diy style and run the coolside on the slanted end of the hanger. Its all good.

Oh so the part sticking out is actually 8mm still.. Hmm would need to know the threads inside to be able to make something for the new ones :( It's no biggie to swap for a M10x1.5 or whatever they made there but need to know exact thread dimensions to make it work. The square is 11.9x something from memory on the old one so then they didn't change that at least.

No it kinda stopped since enertion changed to 10mm and I don't have a 10mm axle to testfit with.. I have made a wide hanger but that only works if you have the old 8mm axle. 

The bearings is 6810 (big 50x65x7) and 6902 (small 15x28x7) for the motor. I use 2RS but they where delivered with low friction seal. 2RS doesn't have enough friction to make a problem for these motors and they will seal better so I went with that. Make sure they didn't change the bearings also ^^
