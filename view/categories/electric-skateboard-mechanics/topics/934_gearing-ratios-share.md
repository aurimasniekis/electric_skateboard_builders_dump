i'm building a new board (Boosted dual inspired) and all my parts are almost in! Im using DIY's 230 KV motors SENSORED and dual 120 amp esc's, running 6s.  83 mm wheels and a 40 tooth main gear, 15 tooth spur. Math only works out to 16 mph but with a whole ton of torque! 

im thinking about dropping down to 35t or 32 t soon!

What about your own gear ratios?

13,14,15,16 and 36 is what I've tried on both 50mm and 63mm 245kv motors with 6s.

I've also used these on the 190kv R-Specs on 10s.

Haha it just kinda depends for what setup I use, but here are my two current configs: 
13/36 245kv 63mm 6s on my little pocket rocket
15/36 190kv 63mm 10s on my downhill deck

Good idea! I'm using 14/36 right now on 6s with a 192kv motor and I reach around 15-25km/h which is a nice start for me as I have never really longboarded much.

You want a mixture of torque and speed to get up hills. If I had 230-270kv that would be best. Or I could increase my voltage and that would be good as well.

10s 15/42 dual on my pneumatic. All of my other boards have been between 14-18/32-36 and single drive. For the recored, I weigh 207lbs and never felt the need for dual motors. 63mm motors are plenty powerful and will knock you on your ass if you're not paying attention even @6s. the need for dual motors stemmed from 50mm motors not having torque to climb. Also aesthetics...some, if not most, cant get past the look of a single motor.

that, and the look on their face after they realize it is 1wd...

They immediately assume it pulls on way, and that your little motor can't do anything to push a whole human.

Big motor, tuned ratio for your flavor and you can blow a commercial dual 50 off the road easily. They certainly aren't slow. 

A good voltage, Kv and pulley ratio combo is like magic.

dont enter a drive ratio. it gets calculated once you enter the values you do know. 

for example enter these values only (motor kv,battery voltage, big teeth pulley, small teeth pulley and diameter of wheels) 
The rest gets calculated from those values.

You would need a 30T spur (wheel) pulley. Assuming 60mm center to center your belt pitch lenght would be 240mm 48T and yeild 6 teeth in mesh.

14/60 on 8S and a 245KV motor. I use VESC in FOC mode and I'm very happy with the build. Top speed is higher than I can handle, and hill-climbing is awesome, I can rip up and over any hill I've tried. The only problem with this kind of aggressive gear ratio is that if any VESC-related problems occur at speed, the reduction ratio can be enough to throw me off the board. Also kick-pushing this build sucks because that's a lot of power lost to the motor if it's not powered.

RPM is a little low. Most brushless motors optimal RPM range is around 8000-8500. If you were to increase your voltage to 10s, youd end up with 7955rpm. You could then change your wheel pulley to a 36T. This would give you a 2.5:1 reduction instead of 2.1:1 which will incrersase your torque.  So 10s with 14:36T pulleyes, and 80mm wheels will yeild you a top end of 47 km/h @ 7955rpm and a reduction rate of 2.5:1. = Better efficiency, higher reduction rate and relitive same top speed.

90mm wheel, 168KV motor, 16/36T, 44kph real world topspeed with 10S

both work really well and both ride very similar. I would always go for the largest possible motor pulley - only advantages and no downside! @Haimindo 1:1 looks cool :smile: 

I dont really believe in that superefficiency around magic motor numbers like 8500rpm. pretty sure in daily life its all marginal effects that might play a role at max speed, but then youll have the shortest range anyway, because air drag burns your battery. most setups I know run most of the time on partial throttle, which is always in any case far off the 8500rpm, so I really stopped caring about these numbers. just want a pleasant sound tbh and the lower rpm the motor runs, the less audible & annoying it is. :relaxed:

I've been told that for a 3 cell battery it should have a total output of 11.1V, which makes sense at 3.7V per cell. What seemed a bit weird to me though is that people were also recommending to stop and charge when each cell reaches around 3.5V. When done charging, mine is usually around 12V so that I can get max distance with my batteries.

@anorak234 You charge up to about 4.20v and nominal is at 3.7v. I would stop riding when cells get to about 3.6v since the lower you go doesn't make a difference and your pack will last longer = less stress. Total voltage when you charge should be 12.6v which is 4.2v *3. You can technically charge to 4.15v for less stress on a pack but if they are only 3 cells. I'd just buy a replacement when they start to lose their capacity.

So basically you don't know how batteries work.
3.7V is just the nominal voltage a lipo has. Charging will obviously increase voltage and you can safely charge them to 4.2V (I go to 4.1V to increase battery life). When discharging you use up the stored energy and the voltage will drop below the nominal voltage. 3.5V seems like a good cutoff.
Have a look at a typical lipo discharge curve to see how much energy you have at what voltage.

@Kaden56 raises a really good point; how do we calculate the recharge rate of regen braking? It's clear that bigger gear ratios would produce *less* energy than others during regen braking, but how much? I don't know how to calculate it. Has someone made a regen calculator?

## \#49 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-10-31T01:02:35.829Z Reads: 282

bigger ratios means the motor is spinning slower for a given speed. You need the motor to be generating a higher back emf voltage than your battery's current voltage to regen. That's why tighter ratios are better for regen braking.

Help
Id like to share my gear ratio because I feel it is inadequate for my uses, but my issue may be a Vesc limitation or something. 
Deets:
63mm 190kV 10s
15\36, 97mm

and I am looking for more speed. 
At top speed the motor is working at like 25-35%. It pulls so hard down low (enough to put you on one foot falling off the back of the board) but then quickly gets to top speed and stops pulling/accelerating. At top speed (roughly 25 mph) I can let the throttle off to like 30 percent before it starts slowing down.

 Maybe I have a VESC setting wrong but it just stops accelerating at top speed, even though it seems to have more torque/ power available since I can let off the throttle so much without slowing. 

Regarding hills,I only weigh 155 lbs and the minor hills here have not been any issue.

I would suggest you look at dual motors.  The difference is night and day.  I went from running a 6355 245kv to 190kv because of a shaft shim issue, then to dual 190kv motors and there is so much torque and throttle I can't use it all.
```

---
## \#53 Posted by: boards Posted at: 2017-02-13T03:37:50.229Z Reads: 257

```
So, the VESC doesn't throttle based on speed, it's based on how hard it's working (current).

The reason you have to throttle down to 30% to get it to slow down is because it's only taking 30% of the max current to maintain your speed. With your given ratio, you can't get over 25mph due to the max speed of the motor.

I recommend you change your gear ratio or increase voltage for more speed.

44T on a 83mm wheel will be very close to ground.

With those dual motors and 83mm wheels you would be better off with 32-36 T wheel pulleys and 15-16 T motor pulleys.

On a 200kv dual with those wheels i would go 16T, 32T , will be better all round , more room between wheel pulley and ground , ...and with 16T more teeth in mesh

Currently running 18:34 (_~1.89)_ on 83mm wheels, with a 149kv SK3-6374 at 12S voltage

This gives a max weighted (verified) speed of ~27mph.  But it can climb the steepest hills in town (in Colorado) at that maximum speed (25mph+).  Gearing your board to go 40mph+ is just throwing away torque if you don't actually use it 

I have another motor pulley to get me to 20:34 _(1.7)_, with an expected 30mph max speed

Hm.. i see..But how do you know the power input of the motor just with the voltage of the battery? if you have a 8S 5A lipo is not enought power ,maybe if you have 8s10A  (296W input) and the power output with that theoretical 80% efficiency you will get a power output of  236.8W on a horizontal plane without friction on the road without your weight.
Anyway the motor with that 8s10A you will get a torque somewhere at 0.33Nm and with that gear ratio is enought,but i''m not sure about the speed and the health of the motor(1350kv),**is just my opinion** maybe can you clarify me

@dan3s2020 delivery system is two 10k mah 4s lipo in series. Constant current and burst current A are amply covered. "Pun intended" Nothing on this setup comes close to overheating and it puts a grin on my face every time I ride. I would be be bold enough to say there are very few boards that could hang with it in a 150' race and on the big end.

I'm ~70kg planning on using a 10s battery, 6374 190kv motor, 83mm wheels and really want to be able to go up hills easily. I'm looking at diy's pulley kit and was wondering if I should go for the 13/36 or 16/36 ratio. I don't care too much for top speed as long long as it's ~35+ kmh. 13/36 might be a little under that but that's ok if it will help me up hills. I'm unsure whether 13t would be necessary for me or if 16t would give me enough torque. I've also heard that smaller pulleys might result in belt skipping. Would this be a problem for 13t? Any help would be appreciated.

Sk3 6354 260kv 36:16 6s does ~23mph will do a standing start with torque to spare (I still don't do it) - perfect for me.

Hey,

Im running 90mm wheel, 200KV motor and 15/36T. The top speed is plenty fast (30) and I dont need that much speed. I was looking for a torque beast that can rip up hills and I dont mind if it means I loose 10mph top end.

Will I notice a difference if I change to a 170kV?
Or maybe change to a 40T?

Cheapest option for best gain!?

Yes, you will notice a difference. @cliofreak 

You can use tools like [this](http://calc.esk8.it) or [this](http://calc.esk8.today) or my personal favourite: [this](http://www.elektro-skateboard.de/wiki/wissenswertes/strom-spannung-reichweite-vii) to determine which parts you would have to change to get your desired top speed.
Rule of thump: less top speed means more torque.

Generally I would say that on a street board the pulley is the cheapest option. 
Like you mentioned there is the possibility to raise the teeth count of the wheel pulley but you could also lower the teeth count on the motor pulley.

Just try some things in the calculators, search for the parts you would need to change and then compare the cost of each option.

Try to avoid motor pulleys with less than 15 teeth for belt longevity reasons.

Right
Or use idler pulleys

So, Ive got 100mm MBS wheels as well as the 90mm Flywheels.
The 100mm defs reduces torque but are great for rough roads.

So if I wanted a torque, hill climbing monster, Im looking at:

15/40T 170KV 90mm with a top speed of about 22mph (torque beast) OR
15/40T 170KV 100mm with a top speed of 25mph but less torque?

40T pulley circa Â£50 after delivery
170KV circa Â£90 after delivery.

The pulley and the motor KV seem to drop mph by about hthe same amount each (3.5mph) and when combined they drop by about 7mph.

Â£140... tempting.

Does that all makes sense?

You could 3D print a 40t pulley then it will cost you hardly anything

Anyone got a 3d Print  file for a 42T pulley to fit Flywheel type wheel?
Also, what material is good for a reliable pulley?

i've had a gear reductio  of 1:3 / 12:36 on my 12S 190kv sensored 6374 build. it could keep up with ppl on dual motor builds! it had a surprising amount of torque for a single motor build.

Used to run 230mm 9inch mountainboard wheels, with just 4.33 ratio and 192kv 6374 motor on 6s. 

Could get 35-40kph
