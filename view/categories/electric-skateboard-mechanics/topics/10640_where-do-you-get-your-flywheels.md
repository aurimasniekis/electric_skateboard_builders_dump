Evening all,

Searching from the UK, it seems really hard to find 75A 97mm Flywheels...
Are they like dinosaurs now, or am I missing something?

Where do you get 'em?

Funny you should say that, I've just signed up to the forum and have just began getting together parts for my 1st sk8, and I've bought some 90mm flywheels from stoked longboards like yesterday funnily enough! UK seller!

They have 97mm and you can choose you durometer: http://www.stokedlongboards.co.uk/-p-286.html

You've to seach worldwide, everyone wants them and nobody is selling them, escpecially not for cheap.
I went through google search (up to page 10+) a few months ago, asked several skateshops and bought the last one ever. (I guess)

Besides the 97mm in 75a, the 90mm in 75a will be out of stock soon too, forever, so if you've the chance to get one, take it.

I got these in green but only thing is unsure on duro as doesn't say but they aren't so for hard in the middle. I know they are 83mm but there are similar ones in 97mm in China on eBay.

Edit these are 97mm just no duro rating

Hard to tell.
There are some (one or two) reports of failing clones, but this has nothing to say about clones in general.
I've done 500 Miles on some clones and there are no signs that they will not last another 500.

But BTT:

They are hard to get at the moment because they stopped Producing this version but did not release the next one yet.

It pays to know how to use web search. Just got myself a set of 75A 83mm + trucks for half price!

Seriously though. Where do you all get your flywheels. Muirskate,Daddies and my other go to's are sold out and backordered on all flywheels. I ordered some from Boards on Nord and they are telling me that they were supposed to get a fresh batch of flywheels 11/1 but the box came from abec11 with everything but flywheels. They expect a box of flywheels at the end of november with no guarantees. Muir skate said they expect flywheels to come in before the 31st of december. So, as far as I know, nobody has any flywheels, but a fresh batch is being made as I write..

Orangutangs are in stock...

Abec was cleaned out by most skate shops in preparation for the holidays. They have another batch in production and you should see most shops with stock ready to ship in the next few weeks!

Woops I messed up this edit.
Well I found some 83mm flywheels in 78a on amazon 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B01LXTF4RM/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new&m=A16ZC15ZGEH7W1
and I found some 90mm a little above average price and in canada
http://www.flatspotlongboards.com/product/abec-11-fly-wheels-90mm/
Evolve has some too also a little overpriced compared to muir or daddies

nice deal on 97mm 75a once they are in stock

@chaka 
Sk8Trip Distribution told me over the phone they would have flywheels in 6 weeks which is dec 31st-ish. Do you think you would have wheels in stock before them? I will be getting the rest of my components for my DIY by the beginning of december and I am trying to avoid waiting 3 extra weeks just for wheels.

If you're looking for 97mm or 90mm 75A flywheels and find someone who has them in stock. Buy them. Looks like ABEC11 won't be producing those anytime soon since they're not listed on their site. If not, the 78A's are pretty close.
