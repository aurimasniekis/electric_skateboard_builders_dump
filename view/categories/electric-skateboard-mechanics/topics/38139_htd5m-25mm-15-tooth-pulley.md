Is there anyone that can make a couple of HTD5M 25 tooth pullies with 8mm bore for me?

I'm stupid, I meant 15 tooth but 25mm long.  Motor pulley, I wanna run 2 belts on each wheel.  It at least thinking about it.

No real reason other than I can.  I just want to see how loose I can run a 15mm and 9mm belt on the same wheel and still have good contact and no slippage.

I looked at that, Mondo expensive to by 2 and have shipped to the US. I was hoping someone had some milled stock and could just cut me off 2 at 25mm.

Metroboards run 18mm belts and they sell a pulley but I think it's 36 tooth
