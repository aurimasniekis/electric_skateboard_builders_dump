I rounded the set screw on my motor gear and the gear is stuck on the shaft. I think it's to far in to use an extractor without damaging the threads. I have an extra gear at home. Same teeth count but it is aluminium. Would there be an issue using a steel gear on one motor and an aluminum for the other if I just blow this out with a drill?

No issue with using one aluminum and one steel.. The aluminum will just wear down noticeably quicker and need to be replaced

Use a soldering iron to get the grub hot then use the best fitting torx tool to back it out

I'm honestly sick of using set screws. This is the second time I've rounded one as it kept loosening it self and every week or so I'd have to re-tighten it, I used loctite too. Is there any other way to hold down a gear without one?

Not that I’m aware of but have you tried using these bolts instead? Fits a larger hex and I’ve had no issues

Unfortunately, I'm using the racestar 5065's with the gear that only has a set screw. I have the steel ones now because I had to destroy the other aluminum one because the set screw got stuck on it.

Literally just came across this thread. Not sure how to properly post the link but there’s people using a loctite retaining compound. Apparently you spread it on, let it set and you’re good to go. no screws needed. And to remove it there’s a video apparently just apply heat (torch or something)

I find  my issue with stripped screws was solved by buying a decent set of Allen keys... I used cheapo tools prior and it always would Give me issues with my fasteners

Use sleeve retainer or retaining compound, can be somewhat hard to find locally- although often found at Automotive stores

OMG this sounds awesome. This is literally the problem I'm having and I just realized I could blow out the screw and still use the steel gear with that. I'm gonna try this. Thanks for finding that.

Slam the tool you are using to unscrew it with a hammer hard, and then press with you whole body weight and try to unscrew it

Use the Loctite 680.  Works great, no worry about set screws

I really need to look into how locitie works, if red is semi permanent, can't @ThermalChild put a tiny bit of red loctite on the tip of the hex key, stick it into the stripped set screw, let it cure and be able to pull out the set screw?

When you're using dollar store hex keys made of the same or softer material as the fastener, then yeah I'd think it would.

Cheap hex keys
[/quote]

just wondering what part of "cheap" is the issue? I'm starting to think the set screws or bolts are the weakest link. If they were made of stronger metals wouldn't the hex key not be able to round it? like we would strip a key before any damage can be done to the screw/bolt?

I got it backed out enough to remove it from the motor shaft. It's now stuck at the top of the gear and isn't moving. It's flush enough that I can give that loctite 680 a try. I just did a mad dash to home depot single motor and bought 3 bags of set screws because why not. Just got home and put on my aluminum gear. I'm gonna use this till the loctite 680 comes in. Really appreciate the help guys!

The hex key would be made of tool steel typically and very hard, when you buy cheap ones they do not fit very accurately and every time you tighten or loosen the bolt you damage it, thus a quality set of hex keys is a sound investment, I’ve not tried the wera hex plus but have heard good things about them. Always take your time to ensure the tool is properly seated in the head of the bolt

I’m in the EU, I use Teng tools and have Draper pro as well, lately I’ve been going over to Torx, harder to screw them up if you excuse the pun, they are great for motor bolts, I’ll probably pick up a set of torx grubs too like so![image|500x500](upload://qN2W588RLLZ5QdRYTmaID6x4XMo.jpeg)

My next question would be, how much of that loctite 680 do I put on? Do you just cover the motor shaft with it?

hmmm, torx seems like a good idea.

I recently swapped the button heads that came with my motor and mounts to socket heads just to be safe. Even then I striped one. Luckily because it was a socket head I was able to unscrew it with using a locking plier (Leatherman Crunch)

Guys grub screws and keyways suck, constant rattling, screws backing out, pullies moving out of place and constand adjustment are things of the past.

On a sidenote, I just heard Toys "R" Us is closing their doors because of all those suckers recommending to buy on Amazon on forums instead on a retail store.

Before I forget here is the link of the Loctite compound on amazon:

what do ya'll think of these?

Marketing jargon states: bits made of premium S2, high strength chrome vanadium, precisely and automatically machined bit tips to ensure accurate size.

well hex bit is hex bit no matter how precise. I would only use big one with drill set like that.  hex plus is waaaay better. the rounded part is allows slight angle for easy crewing and u have to torq it down with the flat one.

Ok, My loctite 680 came in today. I just applied some to my steal gear. This gear has a stripped grub screw in it that will not come out (it's the steel evolve 15t gear on 200kv racerstars). So I am completely relying on this to work as if it fails there's no wobbly/rattling grub screw as a back up.

Sand the motor axle and the internal hole of the pulley to avoid it from getting stucked when you remove them with heat

I do not plan on ever removing it. But I really appreciate the idea of using this loctite. Saved me from having to  go insane with the tiny grub screws. I really hate them. Is this a permanent solution or will it need to be reapplied eventually?

It's eternal, maybe your grand children will try to remove it when they grow pretty old

Awesome lol, I had my aluminum gear on for 4 days and I was starting to go crazy with the rattling even though it was tight. Looking forward to not hearing that sound ever again. Thanks man.
