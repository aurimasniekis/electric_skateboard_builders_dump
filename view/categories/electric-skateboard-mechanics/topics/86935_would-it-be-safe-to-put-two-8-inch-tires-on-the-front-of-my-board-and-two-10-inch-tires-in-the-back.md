I have a single drive EMB and i thought it would look cool to have larger and thicker pneumatic tires in the back and smaller tires in the front. would this cause stability problems or anything else that i should be concerned with?

Having larger wheels at the end of the board will make it look a bit strange. Stability won't be an issue here, but it will be a lot harder for you to turn while driving and you will have to be more careful from little rocks on the road

It will mean the board slants down towards the front, this may feel unstable. I would go the other way around personally
