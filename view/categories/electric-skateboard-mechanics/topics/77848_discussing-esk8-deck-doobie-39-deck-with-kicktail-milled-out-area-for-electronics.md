This is where we have a focused discussion about the 39" Kick tail Deck with a milled out section for batteries that supports up to a **TBC** battery configuration , made by @drangboards 

* Flat mounting area for battery and electronics - Aiming for 150x534x12.4mm (need to calculate what this area can actually fit)
* 10" Wide
* 39" Long
* 8" Tail
* 26" Wheelbase
* Price - TBD but it will also be available for people in Europe

Enclosures can be made by Psyschotiller and Bigben I presume.

I am just here to make @drangboards life easier and make sure we are on track and don't derail and continue with progress

**WOULD YOU BUY ONE?**

With a .5" channel being routed, I'd say this needs to be 11 or 12 16ths of an inch thick.  If we used carbon top and bottom we might even be able to go down to 10, but we're talking about 12 here if it's wood only.

This deck with a 26" wheel base will be stiff enough with wood only.  Composite after that would make the board overly stiff, and too heavy.  

It can be done on a deck with a bottom route that isn't as deep as this one is.  

If anyone sees this, and wants to talk about a deck outside of this deck specifically, then pop on over to the Drang thread, and post there.  www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/drang-boards-deck-building-services-design-cnc-etc

I don't have any cut outs in mind for this deck in this group buy. Programming a new shape for a board however in the CNC takes about 2 minutes, so basically people can have what they want, but that would not be a question for this thread.

Max sense to have the biggest cutout possible (and sensible) and the same cutout. Because no one is going to make several different enclosures for the same board

Oh when you are referring to cut outs, are you referring to the battery enclosure?  Yes, that is still in the plan haha, of course.  

I was talking about cut outs so freaks can put their 110s on it.  

I shouldn't have said that it isn't for this group buy, because I'm totally down to give people different shapes for each order.  Likely it will just cost another $20 to get a custom shape.

One of the biggest questions in regards to the battery enclosure is going to be motor mounts. Since this deck has a micro drop even outside the inner wheel base holes, there is a good chance many front mounted motors could hit.  

I have almost no point of reference to see exactly how much drop we can work with having different motors, and motor mount locations.

Do you want a top mount with a kick, or do you want a cut out board (could have a kick or not)   You seem to like throwing curveballs.  I do want this set up to work with as many DIY kits as possible, and I think we can get it there, but 110 mm wheels are 110 mm wheels, and they get lots more wheel bite, and demand way more riser if the deck isn't cut out.  But here's where these things begin to F with eachother.  

I need to know where motors are located.  If there are people out there thinking about buying this board, what kind of trucks do you have, and motors and mounts?  Maybe if we do a cut out version which won't use risers, those people could use rear mounted motors.... ?
```

People use risers if they use big wheels that's not a worry.

People use different trucks  but almost all motors are 63mm in diameter and either 55mm long or 74mm wide

Great, the main thing I need to know where motor mounts are placing those motors. If someone has a 3d model I can import it into this model, and take a look at just what motors will work with what risers ect.

I have a few mounts but it's all simple really.

Some mounts are long,some short. Some are fixed (not a lot and if they are they are the shortest mount possible) and most have adjustable angle

A short mount has a center to center distances of like 65-70mm iirc

So basically 70mm from the center position of the truck axle to the shaft of the motor

Well, with 110mm wheels, and a half inch riser, this board will work in top mount config.

That gives 20¬∞ of lean with caliber 50¬∞ trucks.  We should be solid.  I may have to optimize the wheel wells a bit but that can happen when it needs to happen, basically when we have a set up on hand we can use to check tolerance.

Sweet I'm glad it's still a plan.. I don't think a motor and amount really matter most adjustable now unless the couple fixed dual moints but just a big cut out for battery's and then we will figure the rest out most of is do this with no cut outs as I routine most of my boards for the lipo batterys that's it the rest fits fine

We‚Äôre probably good to go on the motor mounts unless we find out that with the requisite riser pads most motor mounts hit. If that happens we either create motor wells or we move the rear wheel base back farther away from the drops. I do not want to do that on this single kick. 

With the battery enclosure in mind let‚Äôs talk about the other channels and holes we might want to cut into and through the bottom of the board.  
 
1. Holes along the lengths of the enclosure. Should we drill small or oversized holes so we can inlay threads from the top? I‚Äôd imagine this will be the safest way but maybe it is partially a diy thing. 
2. Channels cut to run wires out the back of the enclosure. 
3. Other shapes all together. If you want this mold but not this shape we can offer a different shape for you. If it is one of my preprogrammed shapes am down to include this in the price because the board will not have wheel wells if it is a cut out board plus it will likely be shorter. 

-your own custom shape you draw on a napkin, your design, or 
-1 of 5 shapes I draw based on different configs 
   Single kick as pictured
   Double kick for the crazies
   Cut out 
   Dropthrough 
   Surfboard 
  For the cut out board it would probably have a longer wheel base. iirc i 29‚Äù or 30‚Äù is max. This would be the wheelbase for the pneumatic riders.
Minimum Drop through inner mounting holes are at 28‚Äù or so. 
Max board length is 45 or 46‚Äù.

I‚Äôll probably go live with that design sesh or seshes.  If anyone wants to watch and send comments with thoughts I would have fun doing that.  

Y‚Äôall are going to shame me if I don‚Äôt give you mm but I‚Äôm sendin it for now.   Will edit the post when back at my computer to add mm in with inches. I am eager to engage in this process all the way through with as many of you as possible whether it is through live design or here in the thread even though I can‚Äôt think in mm.

That's a good size. The milled out recess around that isn't imperative but could add an extra level of finesse if the thickness of enclosure and seal is right. It could though add another level of complication at this stage, and in the interest of testing a concept and showing something tangible simple may be better.

@bigben makes some mighty fine enclosures

Did you decide on a final shape for the first few?

Shapes can be anything for everyone really.  The shape I chose for myself is this one.  I need that kick.  Here is what that battery enclosure size looks like with this shape and overall config, 26" WB, ect.

I'm really into it. 
I admittedly like slightly sharper corners but I really like the shape of the deck overall.
I'd definitely like to add it to my project list.
Didn't think i would be happy i didn't order that moonshine sidekick last week.
This will be way better,  especially with a @bigben enclosure potentially. :wink:

IF we do a pointy shape, the board is going to get longer by a bunch.  I think the shape I have designed is the one I'd want to see now but can build it with any shape for anyone, for a price.  I'm not taking any length off this tail until I know for sure it would be desirable.  If I put a milled out recessed area around the pocket, on this one it will get a bit close to the wheel wells.  Maybe we do it on the next one.  Maybe we can end up making it a biit shorter than 534mm. If not that's fine, I think this size will work fine.  

I can discuss prices now.  This deck would cost around $150 or so.  If it is only getting a channel cut, we can talk about that first, and as we add features, or for those who want to add features, like perfect holes to match a fixture, or a channel for batteries to come out and up through the base plate or something I think that would be cool.

I think I'll cut one of these out today.  I have been pondering whether or not to use these wheel well surfaces on this board.  The wheel bite is pretty good, but could be maybe optimized a bit more, for huge wheels and risers. 

I am going to go back in at some point and make some more tailored shapes and I'll make a directional top mount, as well as a semi cut out deck optimized for the mold.

I'm loving this design. Reminds me of a esk8 tailored cantelated tesseract.

I would love to see the chamfers on the sides a little more aggressive of a angle to reach a more traditional deck thickness. This will make the profile look alot more sleek.

I like the shape, just one comment. Would inward mounting motors foul on the potential enclosure?
If you can cut a deck and get one to me, I'll make you an enclosure. You'll then have a deck that works and is more saleable with an available enclosure? 


Is that the CNC I can hear revving up?

Big Ben, I'm happy you're in on the convo.  For making enclosures, wouldn't it be the most awesome to have a mold with the contours of the deck and the fixture together?  I can whip one of those puppies out if you don't have access to CNC services.  Might be wise to put a relief cut around the enclosure base would be ideal for all things, including ergonomics, h2o ingress, and manufacturing.  I would really like to do a nice good base deck like what we're talking about in this thread, but there are additions we can design in which are SO cool!    How simple do you want to make it?  

Question for all:  Are the sizes 534 x 150 a standard enclosure size for anyone so far?  

Moon Yes I want to cut this deck today.  The other day in the stream I only had 1 hour to give in exploring shapes and I wanted to do 5 different shapes, so didn't get nearly enough time to really make badass shapes for this mold. 

If we want to add a feature later or multiple features I can put the board back down on the CNC table after it is already cut.  

Skunk, I'll try to remember to take some photos or video of the cut or parts of the cut. 

Chalupa thank you.  I love loaded too.  The tessie is probs a good ride  for its concave and rocker, but I'd say the tail might be too short for power manuals with confidence and a high ride height.   The wheel flares are a bit herky for my liking as a wider stance rider.  You might want to try putting a big thick tail guard on it, to decrease the pop/contact angle.  

I really want to get into design, throw some 18650s in this, and a foc box or something, and then see just how low profile we can make the enclosure.  

I think I am going to take my time, incite a bit more discussion, and let's finalize this, and make it tonight.

I might do some youtube live.

I've been thinking I wanted more.  Even if I'm not putting holes for the enclosure in yet, or wire channels so the enclosure doesn't need wires coming out of it, I'll add that later. 

This deck will be a learning experience anyways, as I think it might just end up breaking (Just don't know yet). 

I added these tail reliefs to cut the weight down,  The tail might save us a quarter lb of weight.  Idunno, but here goes nothing.  I'll do some filming and take some pics, but here's the final render.

Biggest question is how deep should the maximum depth be on the enclosure.  I think we need to keep the top of the board above the batteries at least 6 plies deep.  This is going to be the most important decision. 

Right now the cut is as deep as 7 plies.  The board may be able to handle a slightly deeper enclosure cut, but I don't wan to do it.  I think this might stay strong.

There may be other factories on this side of the pond who can and will jump into building these in more efficient manner at higher monthly quantity but for us now here at drang we‚Äôre going to be as high as we can be in that price. I like the forum for finding a price. In a few days we can settle on something solid. Group buy may influence a discount based on how many we presell. We can press boards right when they sell and we want 2 weeks for curing or almost that as Utah is a dry climate.

I wouldn't expect this to be the same. Hummie built those decks for himself and offered it to the community at pretty much no profit,  because it got him what he wanted.
@drangboards is a deck company.  Its his job to make and sell decks. 
But..... even in top end builds it is hard to justify much more than a 200 deck. Especially when there's lots of other fourm built decks (some with enclosures) for 200 and under.

I actually like that name a lot.  Maybe we see if anyone can topple the idea.  I want to name something the darmok.  If you know that reference you get some sort of discount. 

I just want to know if under 11mm is good for the enclosure.  It feels stiff, as there are almost all of 5 plies still in the middle of the board.  I do wantt to put the board back down on the table, and take the flush mounts down, and also the rear tail relief cuts. I might not do it on this one though jeez, there is just so much to do.

deeper would allow builders to more easily go double stack should they want to go crazy with big battery packs without having to go with bigger enclosures which would reduce ground clearance. I think the Hummie deck is about half an inch in depth for reference

Yeah, the problem with this one that makes it harder to go deeper is that it has radial concave.  Right now it is 11.11 mm deep.  If I do 1 and a half more mms down, then there would only be 4 plies at 4 different points along the bottom of the board, and it is a bit of a risk.  I am willing to make it if people all agree.

Our DHL game is strong, we would only need to add $50 to each order if it is being shipped in a single box direct to you.  The other way to go about saving on shipping would be to ship all the overseas boxes to a single location and have them all shipped from there individually. Might be able to keep it down a bit.

Reasons our boards justify a higher price.  

We hand roll our glue. More glue in the board is the result, and  If you don't know, this is a much stronger option for longboards.  We have found over the years that our boards still don't break, delam, and don't just give up after a year or two. 

We give extra love to the board during the sanding process.  More of the rail gets rounded and this makes for a longer lasting board which will shock you at how well it doesn't explode when you slam it into things.  FOR-E- VER!. 

We use zero death chemicals.  When we clearcoat we use multiple coats, rather than 1 quick light one and this means the skin of your board will last longer.  

Our resin is the good good, and isn't cheap.  

We use triaxial fibers rather than biaxial which mean composite boards won't twist as much under riding conditions (better ride).  

Our concaves are all awesome because we've build custom boards for a long time now.  

Them?  

Their concaves is whack!

Their shapes is whack!

Their laminations is whack!

They don't skate transition.

Logically thinking, the price of your existing boards should be a good indicator of value of this boards( + extra millling cost - reseller's profit), but seems like www.drangboards.com is not up anymore. Well your instagram indicated that you supplied to https://www.motionboardshop.com/collections/boards under the name "Beggars Supply Co" , "Drang" and "DB"(possibly others)

I might be wrong, but [this](https://www.motionboardshop.com/collections/boards/products/beggars-supply-co-the-temptress) deck is closest in comparison. I could have purchased it for $150 with free shipping from a reseller. So for me that's a reasonable value(shipped).

We never built for DB, but we built for many.   We are prepared to work with brands, shops, and direct sales, which is where many the big companies are shifting their attention.  It is our intention to keep doing as much direct as we can, but we entertain all offers for business.  Many small longboard and skateboard builders and large, go out of business on the regular because they depend on their accounts as a factory.  The ones who seem to hold onto market share also are their own brand.  Homogenizing all our pricing offerings is the only way, and we put lots of effort into calculating prices for each project.  The cold hard truth is that if boards are being ordered in quantities, it is much easier to manage that order, build the boards, and make money with lower price points.  We love shops and want to leave room for them in this picture as well, and while that means you pay more than you would in a parallel reality where no skate shops exist.  Retail pricing exists, and then shop rate exist below that (roughly 60%) and below that is where the OEM rate exists.  That is where we get a bit worried, and historically we need to ask more on the OEM level.  We can offer competitive rates for retail priced decks, and shops are also well taken care of.

Increasing the angle won't make it tip any easier, it will actually be the opposite.  It is a balancing act.  Your board is the highest I'd do on a deck like this at 18¬∞ and this one is the lowest I'd ever make a deck.  Depending on what we want to see after we learn from each, we'll see what the next model should look like based on how well these manual and ride from the tail.  

Let's see some video of you on your board with the 18¬∞ tail.

It is my hypothesis that the kick on this board will ride extremely well and "do all the other things".

@drangboards, it would be nice to have the enclosure mounting holes CNCed along with everything else. The one thing I hate about fitting enclosure is the work it takes to drill evenly spaced holes on the deck and even then it's not perfect. I'll be 3D printing the enclosures, so it will be perfect. You could make pilot holes and people could expand it if necessary. 

@bigben, would it be possible for you to make the enclosures with holes corresponding to the CNCed holes.

If I make a mold for an enclosure, I'll put little markers on it, so the final product before cutting or drilling will have little dimples to drill out.  Then for the profile cut, a template that was used with a flush trim router bolted into those holes. 

Yes I'd like to get holes on the decks too, and maybe even some wire slots for under enclosure wires.

In the same boat here with ya.  If there is a board that is made and you have the enclosure for simply having insert installed vs installing them yourself I will do the installing unless it is crazy cheap between the 2 options but if you have an unfinished board then you are going to have to do the installing yourself because if you get epoxy or spar in the inserts will then you have just a bunch of holes catching clear coat.  If I can do it myself I'm going to damn well try.

I second this as well. Both guys are proven top notch enclosure builders and it will be less of a head ache to have to learn to make one yourself  unless the is already a vac table and @psychotiller already has a super low profile enclosure so it could work for this deck depending on the dimensions

Is it manageable that I send you a file, we work on, and you can have it cut out?  Same goes for everyone doing good work in enclosures.

@drangboards would it be difficult to add wire channels in the rear?  As most of us run the wire's out toward the back of the board and run them next to the riser into the enclosure. maybe a wire channel on each side of the rear trucks for phase wires would be nice. But i don't know how hard this would be to mass produce so let us know.

A channel would also make a watertight encloser much simpler.

I have been waiting to finish this board to decide exactly what else can go into it, such as water seal channel, and wire exits, and mounting holes.  We can also cut the enclosure just a bit deeper too, by about 1mm to a total depth of 12.xxmm 

Let's spec this out group.

For now, i want something like the pic below. Channels for phase wires and sensor wires like 
@longhairedboy does will require milling from the other side if I am not wrong.

Routing channels on the bottom of the deck is possible but less ideal compared to the top of the deck manly because of the difficulty to make it look aesthetically pleasing. the top of the deck can be gripped over.

This would add another machining step but would be worth the result

Here is a example of both but with a 4th channel on each side for sensor wires:

Bottom:

Top: Preferred method

Would also love to see a recessed edge around the enclosure cut out so that the face of the mounting lip can lay flush with the deck.

Top routes are definately a new challenge because I only have CNC fixtures built for bottom machining, however, it isn't hard to make another side. ..  I guess the more people who want to buy one the more I'll be able to justify it.

I think wire channels and battery cutout is enough along with what you have already done with the deck. It is a diy community after all.

I really don't see the problem with roadside wire channels. 
Bringing up longhairedboys version of it and then saying cover it with griptape is funny considering he doesn't really cover things with griptape

I do like what he does with the channels on his build with the lights and everything. Not sure what material is laid over to cover the channel while allowing the transparent look.

Man, rear wire channels and I'd be 100% in. Top or bottom, doesn't matter to me. No wire channels? I'm considering this GB either way. This deck is sweet.

@drangboards, if you finalize the shape of the recess and the position of the holes, I'll send you a 3D printed enclosure with matching holes.  My 3D printer is just sitting idle these days.

I've scanned through the entire thread and seen specs here and there but it'll be nice to get a current run down. Am putting together a parts wish list right now :) chur bro!

What specs do you want to know exactly?  I think one big question is going to be motor mounts running into the drops.  angle changes might be mandatory for some set ups, however if you're rocking 90mm + wheels you'll need at least .5" of riser to be comfy, and wheel bite could still occur thereafter at about 15 degrees board lean or more.  Check out this wheel bite demonstration using 50 degree baseplates.  I am going to redo this math at some point with 23 degree rear truck and different front angles to figure out what to use on the board I'm referencing right now pictured below.  This model has 95mm wheels at the moment.  Wheel bite is going to happen sooner on the Doobie.  The Doobie needs .5" of riser in order to get over 15¬∞ deck lean.  

![image|690x359](upload://5lnS5n4a0yGIKDaSjSzFvwlxB6C.png) 

Here is a quick render of the doobie.  This one shows me that probably anything will fit all except for in the area of the enclosure.  
![image|690x397](upload://xi2hXeUTuyJZ4DVlCIJFnaG5oIn.png) 

On second thought here is the contact point.  I think I remember adjusting the angle of the woosh to accommodate the needed enclosure area which was dictated by the height of the unity and it has 50¬∞ baseplates. 

![image|690x397](upload://93qgl10z150PIUsDRdy3wM2iRdE.jpeg)   

See where my mouse is on the screen that is where contact would occur between the woosh set up at some angle (not sure how to reference that at this point)

Don't know what I'm doing, but it would at least fit this many batteries and a unity...

Still need to make the shape about .5" longer.  We're going to press another blank, and give that one a slightly different cut.  This one didn't get full pressure for as long as needed, and it relaxed significantly so before I decide on a shorter kick I need to feel the full geometry.  

Overall length could be as long as 40" (101cm)

Oh I forgot to mention I added 2 wheel base options in the rear of the deck, so motors will clear for sure!  I'd say after adding those wheel base options we can green light any and all motor set ups.  

Let's get a tally of how many of these decks are going to be pressed. Price is going to range between what and what?  That is the question.

If you want to forgo any of the specifications like battery cut,  ply count, various holes, wire cuts ect, then I can proceed on making your board with no obstructions.  That board will be cheaper.

Until I finish the remainder of the design I won't have one totally done but we can start pressing and curing them asap.  Better to cure a 12 ply deck for a few weeks to a month before cutting.

Sweet! Nice update! Yeah spec wise I'm looking at a dual belt drive 170kv motors (maytech), FSESC6.6, probably 110mm shoes.. something to suit the hilly road conditons around Auckland.. Battery wise I'm still researching.. 18650s  or 21700s.. For about 15km of range and hill climbing potential.. And what BMS to pair with that setup.. Anyway.. This will be my first foray into the esk8 world

@drangboards can we get a top and side orthographic projections of the board so we can start playing around with fit? 

I'm playing around with the idea of using [Samsung 21700 50e](https://ru.nkon.nl/rechargeable/21700-20700-size/samsung-inr21700-50e.html) in a 10s3p setup..  works out to be ~W:150mm  x L:170mm x H:40mm..
