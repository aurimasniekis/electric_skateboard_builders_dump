Looks promising!
definitly need a set!

@MBS they will come with the hollow shaft like the pro version or with the solid shaft?

Oh, interesting.  I haven't planned a solid axle version at this point but always happy to consider it.   In the meantime, you could buy the normal Matrix II trucks (solid axle), then upgrade them with the Metal top trucks.  It might cost a little more that way, but not too bad.  Have you had problems with the hollow axles?

No, these will be my first set of channel trucks. 

I am always under the impression that the solid axles are stronger and more durable than hollow ones, I have nothing to back it up, and it might be wrong, just my thoughts.

I‚Äôd love to hear your professional opinions about which axle are stronger and more durable or they both are?

Thanks for the updates! Do you have any plans to offer extended axles as well? Like maybe 10mm longer?  I think some of us could use just a bit more axle length to accommodate unconventional wheels/drivetrain situations. Or even some stepped down 9.52/10mm axles for those who want to use smaller street wheels with 22mm OD bearings? Could open up some new Matrix II build options.

@MBS I own a pair of matrix pros, the gold ones, and been curious of the differences of the two as trampa still does the channel trucks similar to the matrix pros but it appear mbs has moved on to the matrix 2. Shockblocks vs egg shocks/springs, also if anyone else has experience.

```
Regarding sold vs. hollow, solid are technically stronger.  More material = more strength.  There's no way around that.  But with respect to bending stresses the outermost fibers carry the vast majority of the load.  For pure bending, the fibers at the very center of the axle actually have ZERO stress.  

We've obviously hollowed out more than the very center fiber, and there are also shear stresses involved which get carried evenly by all the fibers in a cross section, but for all **practical** purposes, in the course of actual riding it's safe to say the hollows are as strong as you need.  I'd say the hollows are well engineered whereas the solids are over engineered.  

Smaller diameter axles (8, 9.5, 10mm) are totally different because the material that is removed (compared to a 12mm axle) is the outermost fibers, the ones that carry the bulk of the load. 
 That's why those are more likely to bend.  But as long as you're going with a 12mm axle you don't really have to worry about bending an axle.For the last several years of mountainboarding on these has proved they're plenty strong.  We go pretty big on these things.
![Joel%20-%20Sydney%20BMX%20Track|690x459](upload://zsNm2zyGG2TRsZeYOk0EvqK7UDG.jpeg) 

The only practical disadvantage to the hollows is that it's an additional step in the MFG process which adds cost, but for this truck we figured it's worth it.

Curious to know other people's thoughts on this though.

knowing MBS.. i'm gonna get a set.. and ride them.... and in the unlikely event that it breaks..  @MBS has done enough to earn my trust.  I have faith that they will do whats needed to ensure the situation gets set right.  Also.. I like weight saving, one of the reason why I ride with lipos and belts.  Weight does impact the ride dynamics, done 12s6p went right back to 12s 9000mah lipos :slight_smile:  Truely can't wait to get my hands on the new deck + metal base plate trucks!

I love weight saving too, that‚Äôs why I ride like you with lipos and belts on my jump deck.
But let‚Äôs put my thoughts on it:
Here are the specs for
Pro
![image|671x499](upload://2xvkZgbhlrlepwvC6gFeeklft7b.jpeg) 

And Solid truck
![image|535x500](upload://lTMts37horrX2HypDYki9U3kO83.jpeg) 

So in total i save 40g? üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
@mbs can you confirm that the numbers I found are correct?
Is it really worth adding one more production step and more money for this some gramm weight saving?

Subjective question...  

For mountainboarding we care a lot about spin weight because freestyle is an important part of our sport.  Weight losses/gains that are out near near the ends of a board are greatly magnified (rotational inertia), so small differences in the weight of trucks and wheels make a big difference to spin weight.  Deck and bindings not as much. 

Electric boards on the other hand are so heavy that 40g (60g by my measurement) probably wouldn't be even be noticed.  Just being honest.  

Ultimately, our trucks are multipurpose, so hollow axles is what everyone gets for the new Metal Matrix II trucks.  When we introduce swappable axles into future designs you'll be able customize as you see fit.

Hey Joel @MBS, would you have any interest in bringing some Foot Hookers to market? Like the Freebord S2 bindings, but hopefully better in every possible way? That would be awesome.

OK Guys.  Sadly our official launch got pushed back one day to March 7th.  Just a few more marketing boxes to tick...  

But because you guys have been sooooo patient for soooo long, I've decided to pre-release just the trucks to just your forum.  MBS USA only at this time.  Use the product page links below.  Please DON'T publish outside this forum!  We want to properly launch these at the same time as the other item launching.

BTW, the tech talks that are on there are for the old trucks so ignore that for now.  The new tech talks will be live tomorrow.

Price is 34.95$ for the base plate only.

Hmmm, not sure why that link preview is showing the wrong price.  The price for the top truck only is definitely $34.95 (not 89.95).  Price on the actual site is accurate.  I edited and refreshed the link but no luck.  Just ignore.

***EDIT - Ha. Now it's right.

Or use a forwarder company like shipito or similar. Mbs US offer free ground shipping within US over 75$, so in the end you just pay shipping from the forwarder warehouse to your location.

Hi Joel @MBS, 

I got a question about the stance on the new _MBS Pro 97 Deck - DWII_.

On the website, we can see :

> we've shortened the wheelbase by approx 3/8" (1cm)

This is compared to the last Dylan Warren model right (all black) ?

So, is the new one more like 96cm tip to tip, or it's just a new holes pattern on the tips (and the stance and length of the deck are the same?) ?

Thanks for your help :v:
```

---
## \#65 Posted by: MBS Posted at: 2019-04-01T02:44:45.243Z Reads: 166

Sorry for the delayed response.  I've been on the move for the past few weeks.  The answer is the latter, the deck length and stance are the same as before, only the truck holes have been moved inward from each end slightly.  If someone wanted to drill new holes for an extended wheel base there'd be room for it.

I guess I will understand more about the feel once I get up and riding.  I am extremely curious about the stance and being "locked" in with the straps.  If the Holy doesn't sell..hit me up.  I can help you out with that.

I am mad, my ignorance didn't know about scrub decks and such.  Watching the videos that seems the way I would of wanted to go with the Matrix II trucks.  But....there is always next time.  Until then I need to see you go ahead and build that beast!!!


(In all honesty I never had a doubt.  I know my message was a little more detailed than needed, LOL..sorry about that!)

:blush: hahaha, thanks Ixf !  
 I ride it a couple of time last year, plus the Dylan (1 or 2 times), and it's not really flexy for me ^^ (but like a kind stiffness).  
The bird is a little bit shorter no? Or just the drilling pattern too? I really want a long, wide, nicely flexy mountainboard :smile:
(My scrub was 1m long, supa mega flex (and don't twist), the sandwich in carbon fiber help me a lot to get something as flexy but more strong and reagent. Wide underfit, camber but not to much underfit, concave etc... but the stance is too short)

Does anyone know if the segmented enclosures fit the MBS decks?  I really don't remember seeing any during my research.  It seems that there aren't many MBS builds.  Pretty dominated by Trampa builds.  

Also, it seems if one does go with an undermount it could work seeing that the MBS decks are rather stiff and "springy".  Just curious about this option for housing batteries.  Even with my 200lbs jumping up and down I am not even bottoming out.

[/quote]

to which ones exactly you referring?
i have seen somewhere a eboosted enclosure on one of the mbs decks, but i don¬¥t remember who posted the picture.
For the trampa underboard tray, just cross check the dimensions.
they are available on the tampa side. you might cut the side lips, but you anyhow will need to cut that tray, so no big thing.

Good eye @Nemesis. We added that hole to the F5 ladder cover a while back with DIY cable routing in mind.  For instance, you could route wires (from a battery box between your feet) underneath the ladder strap cover, and out that hole to the motors.  It just keeps the wires a little more out of the way of the ratchet when ratcheting.

I have ye old f4 bindings (for now) my vesc-batt cable goes underneath the bindings ladder strap cover, like you have threaded your velcro strap but obviously still following the same route and positioning as your cable.

Edit.... yes its narrow but i took the strap out threaded the xt90 head and shrink wrapped cable then back in with the ladder/strap.

Unfortunately it's nearly impossible on the current trucks.  The axles are serrated then press fit with a giant press.  In theory... secure the aluminum hanger in a vice.  Make a steel "doughnut" (i.d. 12mm / o.d. approx 50mm).  Slide that onto the axle.  Tighten the axle nut.  Then hammer on the doughnut to pull the axle out of the hanger.  The easier option might be for us to make removable axles on our next version of these trucks...

I also had to deal with this and the two MM top trucks I received were not the same as each other.  I ended up making two different pair of flanged bearings to make them work.  On the plus side, nice work for the price but they should be more consistent in their dimensions..

Picture as received with stock flanged bearings:![56|690x388](upload://mbSzxuga0cbosib7ibDXJ7PRay6.jpeg)

One more comment, your commitment to the tiny nuts is questionable and to recess 2 of them into the top truck is pointless and a waste of effort since it makes them far more difficult to mount.  I bridged mine with 15mm fender washers and use regular skateboard hardware.

Unfortunately the US is sold out until the next batch arrives (July/Aug) so we can't check any there. For the complete trucks any potential gap gets closed when the kingpin is tightened so can't check that stock.  Here in Australia the limited stock we have measures 58.0, 58.1, 58.2, 58.3, 58.5.  

A little gap obviously isn't a problem since the tightening of the kingpin easily closes gaps.  All dims have associated tolerances and we prefer to have a little gap rather than having an interference fit to make assemble easy.  

BUT @Schteev's  picture above shows more than a "little gap".  I'm guessing that's more than 2mm.  Tightening the king pin will still close that gap but it's still not right. It's out of our tolerance so it needs to be investigated. I'm following up on that now.

At the end of the day if something isn't right for a customer it's not right for us.  If anyone has a gap like @Schteev's and they're not happy with the king pin cinching it up submit a warranty claim via our website (mbs.com for North America) and we'll sent you a replacement when they're back in stock. 

Thanks again for bringing this to our attention!

Oh they are sexy looking, any chance of some new color version Shock Blocks in the future? thinking a pastel purple/pink shocks would look dirty on the oil-slick trucks or the black original finish version.

you can always send MBS a mail. 
they probably can ship them also over to you, just not standard on the US website.

Sorry for the delay @Alphamail.   The new parts measure 58.9mm.  Any gap will cinch up easily, but if you're worried about yours we have some bushings with a slightly thicker flange I can send you.  That'd snug things up even more.

Joel, a question: do you offer Matrix trucks in plain raw metal color?

We have in the past, but we don't at this time.  The closest thing would be our new oil slick coating.

Yeah, I saw those. But I'm really interested in raw metal. Any chance to get them somewhere else?

I was considering sanding the finish off of mine but not sure I'd end up doing it since black is fine for me.
