I have a set of 83mm 75a ABEC11 Flywheels on my board. Can anybody recommend drop-in replacements (clones included) that'll handle really worn asphalt well?

I was thinking 97mm 75a but I'm not sure what other options are available.

Thanks

Clones are usually not as soft as genuine Abec11 flywheels because they don't have the same chemistry.

What about some MBS wheels, great for rougher roads.

will the MBS actually give you a smoother ride or do they just have more traction because of their shape?

I have a good set of clones, but my flywheels are better. 78a's are good, but the 75a's are better. Original flywheels are hard to beat.

at some point you can only go pneumatics I guess - until then 90mm + softest duro is probably about the best you can do.

90mm 75A abecs is also not the holy grail on its own - on non supportpin trucks like caliber IIs you can tune also with softer bushing setups and soft urethane pivot cups. shock pads also work a little ... finally, a flexy board helps a lot! if the ground gets rough I move my feet inwards for higher damping, on good roads I move them towards the trucks for more precise steering until I have the correct carving energy return timing for a more energetic carving experience.

The Metroboard wheels are supposedly genuine abec11's,  probably  custom made for Metroboard.

Really hope MBS comes with a softer compound for 100mm wheels. 

I'd would also love some 4" or 4.5" tops pneumatic wheels, but nothing on the market at the moment.

My absolute favorite setup is legit Flywheel 97's!  Roll over just about everything (small rocks, crappy sidewalks, small children (unattended))...  But this was also on a drop deck subsonic/GBomb which the drop brackets flex a bit and take some of the bump out too.

Soft thane and bigger wheels seems like the best combination for bumps and rolling over stuff.

GL!

Thanks for all the suggestions. @JLabs I like the look of the MBS wheels. Do you know if they offer a smooth ride or are they just able to ride over stones etc. with ease?

@whitepony Pneumatics would be ideal but Iâ€™d like to keep as much of my existing drive-train as possible.

Has anybody tested MBS All-Terrain wheels versus 97mm 75a ABEC11 flywheels?

For bad roads the MBS will feel better. 1. Theyre bigger, 2. they got more grip and 3. they tend to be softer :D
