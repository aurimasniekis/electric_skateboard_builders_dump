Hey fellow e-skaters!

Sometimes it's the small things, that makes our lives easier. 
Everyone who owns a mountainboard, frequently changes tires, or tunes esc settings knows the hassle of handling a board with three or less tires on the desk or leaving skid marks by accidentally touching the trigger.

If you recognize yourself, this one is for you:

If you have a 3d printer, just download the model and print it in every material you like. Even plain old PLA works perfectly well and holds up great. You can even stand on the board, while it's on the boardstand!

Is in Germany, but gives Freedom Units as the answer.  We're going backwards :confused:

228.6mm = 9 inches

This is a :slight_smile:  sweet idea, I use pieces of wood to do the same thing but things fall down easily...

Unweighted full throttle on carpet.... That happened in summer 2017 and is still visible, need to renovate :laughing:

Dude, you just need to go full throttle in REVERSE and that should clean right up. At least I assume that's how it works. :thinking::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

That's the sleeping room of my 2 room apartment (but I can't sleep there). Left side recording studio, right side esk8 workshop.

:joy:
That's exactly what I accidentally did before going full throttle forward (to save the furniture), I've tested the reverse function with Ackmaniacs FW.

Wow, interesting...

It took 22 posts from offering something for free for the community to someone making profit with this data.

Don't get me wrong, it's totally ok ok for me, if you help someone out who doesn't have a printer. But it's a bit weird if you charge more than what you need to cover your expenses for material (maybe power) and shipping.

Honestly I have seen the stand already a while ago on the etoxx website.
Never expected that you guys will share the files.
It‚Äôs a very kind thing and I hope as min some of the guys here will order from you.
It‚Äôs not that expensive and it would defintly support you to go on doing other cool stuff for us!

Think molding and casting these would make more sense if you're selling them on mass.

really like the design of stands

designed very fast an extra bracket to flip the deck. It sits stable even if you have the trampa bindings.

disadvantage, not an compact design en you need a little bit bigger buildplate.

if somebody is interested let me know. I will put it online.
