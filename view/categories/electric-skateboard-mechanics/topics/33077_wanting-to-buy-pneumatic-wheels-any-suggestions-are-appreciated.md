Hello,
so this week my Skikes (oh man they suck so much... see pic.) pretty much exploded...

I wanted to buy some 6 inch wheels or maybe even trampa 7 inch but they are pretty expensive and made for 9mm axle so I would have to change the bearings and that would cost even more money...
I already have my trucks (caliver II) machined so the axle is longer so I could fit the skikes which are 34mm hub width...

This is what I found so far (apart from trampa) https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/6X2-Inflation-Tire-Wheel-Use-6-Tire-Alloy-Hub-150mm-Pneumatic-Tyre-Electric-Scooter-F0-Pneumatic/632724_32808118999.html?spm=2114.12010608.0.0.2995e5c023eWrC

Thank you in advance :)

Take my dog üê∂ after surgery as a cute bonus... I sure do need it because I am pretty disappointed after the skike failure... :D

Have you seen @psychotiller's pneumatic wheels? I've ridden them and they are great on pavement and over grass/dirt

Yeah I have seen them but he seems to be only selling tires and tubes for them... they are the same as the ones I found on aliexpress. That is why I chose them.. they are at least somewhat "tested"

why not just get the evolve AT kit? its 200$, and comes with everything you need. It also comes with bearings to allow for 8mm axles.

I was looking at that but I am not sure if 7 inch is not too big on regular trucks :/

Huh?! My tires and tubes do come from China. Just like all others, but the difference is I make my own wheels and they fit all trucks without requiring any mods. Also, skikes suck, and mine don't.

I know you make your own but I didnt find them on your website so I had to look elsewhere and found exact same tires just some chinese hubs... I guess I worded it wrong my bad

Are you saying you dont think the 6 shooters are tested?  I mean, Ive got 150 miles on mine, so thats pretty well tested :slight_smile:

Yeah, Actually it's probably safe to say more testing has been done on boards using my wheels than any of the other non-longboard specific wheels. Not sure what was meant by the "somewhat tested" statement.

oh man guys.. okay... let me explain because it is all going the wrong way :D 

So I knew @psychotiller makes wheels so I went to his website and somehow failed to find or missed his wheels  and only found those tires and tubes so I was searching on the Internet and found same looking same size 6 inch tires so after my skike exploded I thought that these from aliexpress are at least somewhat tested because psychotiller and his customers use them or similar to them more than skikes. 

No need to be passive aggressive here :D just a misunderstanding hope it is clear

Ive got a set of the wobblies (the v.01 6 shooters) that I'm gonna try the[ 6‚Äù 150*50mm 70A Airless wheels](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/6-150-50mm-70a-airless-inflation-free-solid-tire-anti-puncture-all-terrain-off-road-electric-longboard-skateboard-wheels/32666/80) on, if you can wait until delivery Ill tell you if it works.

Not being passive agressive, just being clear.  It appeared you were stating that the PT 6 Shooters hadnt been tested so I wanted to correct that s they are the best numies on the market.  I've ridden Skikes, MBS, Evolve and Trampa wheels...the 6 Shooters are better.

Not being passive aggressive..Even if you bought the tires I use on my sixshooter wheels and put them on your skike hubs, it wouldn't be functional..It's not the same thing. They are super narrow hubs which make the tires have a slim profile and stand up too high. This allows them to flop over and wash out. My hubs are 36mm wide and offset for a reason.

I'm only coming at you because everything you've written somehow slightly slanders my site or my wheels. You don't get it, because you haven't done that much research and that's fine, but dude, you're not getting the same thing from somewhere else.

You can also print my hubs and use the china tires.
But @psychotiller's are way more professional and high quality hubs.

Would love to but switched jobs and don't have access to the printer anymore. From what I read some modification is necessary. Hopefully @mmaner can tell us more about the combination of your hub and the tires - if it fits it should fit the printed ones as well.

In martins defense, I was looking for wheels too and was confused by your site as well(I actually ordered my vesc from you). I think you should update the main display picture to be a picture of the bare wheel by itself.

@Martinsp you have a few options...

@psychotiller SixShooter wheel kit is $300 and will mount on your trucks with no modifications.... $300

Evolve AT kit is $220 but you will need @torqueboards 218mm trucks to avoid wheel bite. You also have to mill 8mm off the rear truck to fit the stock Evolve pulleys. You can use a printed pulley and avoid this..... $355

MBS hubs with 200x50mm tires and tubes will work but you will have to order 28mmx22mmx8mm bearings and also use @torqueboards 218mm trucks.... $280


I know all of this because I did a lot of research while building my current board.

I just got a nice set of pneumatics w/drive gear from @slowmez from 85$. If you wait around long enough, good deals will always come your way. Yes, @psychotiller's wheels are amazing, but I am perpetually on a budget so these work well enough.

I got a set of @psychotiller wheels  but ended up needing more ground clearance so I went with the 7" Evolve.

I didn't like the experience of the pneumatics... just wasnt the longboard feeling I like. Glad someone could get some use out of them.

Anyone else try these 5" scooter wheels? Inflate to 80psi and seem to be working really well. I just had to press the bearing out and respace them. They bolt right on standard truck with no modification and are about $26 shipped each with the bearing,wheel, tube, and tire. 

No wobble(@ 22mph anyway) and they ride great. I'm 6'4 @ 200lbs and the ride quality was night/day just swapping the front only.Working on a modified avenue trucks truck pad suspension of some sort for the rear now.   

Pretty cheap if you buy 100!

I have the same problem.. 
I want to upgrade from my 83mm hub motors (hard as hell) to something more comfy. I don't have resources for psychotiller's, tb110, abec or any other brand names so I narrowed it down to those roughly 30 bucks a set setups:
1. 5 Inch Pneumatic
https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/3jN7XFa
2. 97mm polyurethane 
https://www.amazon.com/Cal-Longboard-Flywheels-Bearings-Multiple/dp/B07SB6HF1M

I would prefer pneumatic but I'm afraid of wobbling and larger rolling resistance. What do you think, what would you recommend?

Dickyho‚Äôs pneumatics are pretty cheap & good afaik. You won‚Äôt be using it with the hubs tho if that was your initial goal.
