Hello everyone!

Been lurking here for a while and decided I wanted to build a regular longboard first that's 'eskate' upgradable if I decide I like it in the future :slight_smile: Now I was wondering if the @dickyho mounts wil also fit the caliber fifty I trucks? They are on a pretty nice sale in my area right now and I would buy them if they fit. Couldn't find an answer in other posts, that's why I'm creating one now :slight_smile:

Cheers, Lorenzo
