Hi Guys!

I'm new here and I'm planning on buying Torque Boards PRO3 Conversion kit.
It has basically everything you'd need to do an eskate conversion. It comes with 218mm to accommodate 2 6374 motors. It has basically the same specs as this guys post that I linked.

I'd like to put it on a Landyachtz EVO deck but with the motors facing inwards. How would I go about doing that? Risers? I saw a build on here where a guy was using the same Torque Boards motors I would be and I believe the same 218mm trucks.

Also he listed it weighing a little over 30lbs...does that sound right?
Anyway please give me some feedback!

Awesome!

How? lol.

What enclosure are you using?
I was going to use Torque Boards enclosure since it comes with the kit. The post I linked the guy is using the TB enclosure but it's double din so it sits a bit low to the ground. I would like to use it but I don't know how  to get around clearance issues. It's a 12S4P battery. From some other posts it seems your is 10S5P?

So you're not using TB mounts?

How much does it weight?

Do you use 6374's?

Yep it’s 10s5p single stack with a big bms. 
I made this enclosure. (I make enclosures!) 
From memory it’s about 11kg?
Yes dual 6374s

Got it! 
That's awesome, it does seem super well fitted. 
That's actually not bad at all.

So is all I need to do this just risers to make the motors fit and for that matter raiser the battery pack/enclosure for clearance?

@bigben

Do you think you can make a custom enclosure that would accommodate the 12s4p battery that torqueboards makes? 
So that it would work with the LCD indicator and power switch, charging port.
