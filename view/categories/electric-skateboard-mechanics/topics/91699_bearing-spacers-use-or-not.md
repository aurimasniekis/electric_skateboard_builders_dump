My TB110 wheels came in today and I realized I don't have bearing spacers for them. I'm actually not sure I even need ones though. I found [this article](https://www.livestrong.com/article/557399-spacers-vs-no-spacers-for-a-skateboard/), which mentions both pros and const to using spacers. They claim you shouldn't need them if you don't make sharp turns, which I don't on my RKP trucks. I also found found [this vid](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bearings-bearing-spacer-useful-info/6823?u=janpom) that shows how spacers can do more harm than good if they don't fit the wheel core perfectly. I wonder what people have to say on using bearing spacers on esk8. In fact, let's have a poll as well.

I didn't read the article buddy but from an engineering perspective does it not make full sense to brace the inner race of your bearing so that you can fully tighten your nut/bolt? Otherwise you're rolling along at 30mph potentiality on a hope and wish that you applied the right pressure when you did it up?

If you want to ride it then don't over tighten the wheels or all you are relying on is the plastic core and not a complete through sleeve of metal over the axle.  Don't ride it for long but to test you should be fine.  Always use a spacer.  Period

Mechanical engineering is largely beyond me, sorry. I understand that some wheel cores don't have a stopper for the bearings, so you could potentially push the bearing all the way through the wheel core. That sounds like the case where you'll want to use the spacer. The Kegel cores do have the stopper, so I guess you can still tighten the bolt even without the bearing spacer? Or would the problem be that the bolt would push the stationary part of the bearing inside the wheel, potentially out of the rotating part of the bearing?

OK, so the problem is that if tightened too hard, the bearing would damage the plastic wheel core since there would be no metal part (spacer) to stop it?

Get Zealous bearings with built-in spacers or just flush extra spacers. I beat the crap out of my wheels and never got any issues with spacers. However I almost fucked up a bearing by forgetting a spacer (bearing still good but one side cover is gone for good).

Another thing to not is that if you're using push fit pulleys you'll need to space anyway.

For the sake of 50p I'd just run spacers, zero pressure on your bearing balls seems smart to me.

No,  the bearings themselves should never have lateral pressure on the outer race apart from natural usage.  By this I mean that no pressure from tightening the axle should impact on the outer race.  By using a spacer the inner race provides a solid tube right through to the hanger and so when you tighten the nut it compresses the solid tube of the inner race and the outer is left just to spin. Think about it.  If there is a gap between the bearings then when you tighten up the wheel nut the 2 inner races will try to meet in the middle and put pressure on the outer race and ball bearings.  Experiment.  Don't use a spacer in the front wheel and tighten it up.  It will become stiff and hard to turn.  Then put in a spacer and no matter how hard you torque that nut the wheel will spin freely.

Yeah sure, I wasn't trying to save cash here. I thought that maybe without spacers could be a better solution for esk8. Apparently not.

Thanks for your help guys. I appreciate it.

And here I have been never running spacers on by board because I never bought a bearing set with them included. I also don't use speed rings (read "washers") but that's not as big of a deal. Time to get some I guess to be safe.

Spacers are totally necessary. 

Coming from the world of downhill skateboarding, there is a clear advantage to having appropriately sized spacers properly installed (it's kind of hard to mess up if you got the right spacers for your wheels).

Without spacers, you will have more wheel wiggle/play than with spacers. This adds an unnecessary additional source of unpredictability. If you ever carve hard to the point where traction breaks, this is where you will feel it the most. Even if you don't plan on carving hard, if you ever need to you don't need your wheels skipping, gripping and sliding at random. Like others said, the wheel core is doing all the work at this point and taking a huge beating. Spacers square everything up and keep your bearings where they should be, especially since bearings don't usually fit just right over most axles. Truck axles are usually slightly under 8mm while bearings are just a tad over. Spacers allow you to tighten the nut down and minimize the play in this gap. Breaking traction with spacers is noticably more predictable, which besides taking load/wear off your core, in an emergency this extra predictability might be what ends up keeping you on your board since you can control a predictable vehicle easier than an unpredictable one. 

That's all I've got to say. 100% use them.

wait, you're suppose to tighten the axle nut all the way (with spacer)?  I normally tighten the nut all the way, then back off 1/4 a turn.  I feel wheels spin more freely when i back off the nut a tad.

That's correct, you back if a bit to reduce friction. Just not so much that anything nice that shouldn't.

If you have to back it off to reduce friction, you need slightly larger spacers. Some aren't just the right size. Zealous bearings and their integrated spacers are amazing and cheap as hell. I always crank mine all the way down and not back off at all- wheels spin free with no friction. This is the best case when using spacers.

You can deform the inner race so that it's not vertically aligned with the outer race if you tighten it too much.

I've never had that issue with zealous bearings at least. When using a lot of spacers out there it can be a bit more finnicky- with some spacers I'll have to back it out a bit. Some of the perfectly sized, thick spacers have been great and fully torqued never had any issues with deformation. If it's just a tad bit off, you are totally correct. 

Otherwise, are you talking about over time even deforming/compressing the spacer itself along with deforming the inner race from too much torque? I've seen that happen as well, to the spacer at least, when it's a softer metal.

Something is binding then.  Either the spacers are too small or the bearing is binding on the hanger.  Speed ring will fix that.  Plastic cores are not always perfectly moulded so spacers don't always fit to the tolerances needed but the better quality wheel the better the cores.  My son is a pro scooter rider and dialed is the thing.  Not rattles or loose wheels.  Nothing puts more lateral pressure on a bearing set than a hard ridden scooter.  The spacers need to be spot on or bearings last one or two rides.  You should have full free spin but be unable to feel any movement with your hand.  Then everything is perfect.

Imagine the forces impacted on the bearings from landing this and esk8 seems like a breeze.

Even with zelous beatings in had to back off a bit. It may be a difference in how much torque is initially applied, I tend to really lay down on wheel nuts to make sure everything is seated. I've litterally never seen a wheel nut I couldn't tighten a little more. Too tight is as bad as not tight enough.

No such thing as a bearing that is too tight if its spaced correctly.  The spacer should be snug within the bearing space.  If its not its too small.  Unfortunately its not easy with badly moulded plastic cores.  The tiny tolerance should be on the bearing seat on the wheel and not the inner race. Create a solid tube through the two bearings without exerting lateral pressure on the outer and you are good to go

I installed my bearings and spacers yesterday and this is exactly what I'm getting. One wheel I can tighten all the way and it spins nicely. Another one I need to loosen a little bit otherwise there's friction and the wheel doesn't spin very well. That's with speed rings on both sides. I guess I need slightly longer spacers.

Yeah thats exactly the problem.  Core differentials.  So long as the wheel remains immovable by hand then don't worry about it.  Under esk8 conditions it won't ever cause you a problem.  I'm just a bearing nazi.  I have put a speed ring inside the wheel before and while its a fiddly job it does take up the tolerance but only if the tolerance is big enough.  You don't want the bearing to be too far unseated in the wheel.  Fine line and probably overkill in esk8

Is it better to still tighten the nut all the way and live with the sub-optimal wheel roll? Even then the free roll of the front wheel is much better than the free roll of the driven rear wheel (this is with a belt drive). If I loosen the nut enough to get good roll there's a little bit of side to side travel. It's barely noticeable but it's there.

No mate if you can't lose the movement its better to have your bearings free rolling.  Like I said in esk8 its not a drama if the wheels move slightly.

Bearing spacers should be the correct size in order to allow you to fully tighten down the nut.

If your wheels don't spin freely then the spacer is not correct something which happens very often due to wheel core tolerances (even with cnc wheels)

I usually end up making spacers for each wheel separately on my lathe.

Agree 100% with Dareno about the need for an accurate spacer.

I just wanted to add that ball bearing (like 608, 6200), have very limited axial load capabilities (cars use conical bearing to handle it).

On powerkiting boards, where axial loads are important, ball bearing showed their limits (short life span) and a loose spacer causes the wheel to wobble immediately. Some people even tried to replace them by plastic sliding bearing, which is smart.

On Esk8, where milage is very important, we might have to reconsider our bearing design ...Recently, a FB video showing a Emtb wheel suddendly driving away + rider face plant made me thinking twice...

I have tried bearings with angular contact for axial loads and did not see any increase in reliability over a common 608. Switching to grease has yielded way longer maintenance cycles though. 

Wheel cores are all a little different. Some wheels will do fine with a standard spacer while a different brand will bind or have excessive wheel pop. A few companies make precision spacers but your best bet if you want perfection is to do what @taz has stated and cut your own since each brand can vary slightly. But you need to do it on the lathe and keep the surfaces parallel.

The problem is more critical on mtb wheel, vs skate, as there is much more leverage between contact point on the road and bearing seat (ie  wheel diameter vs bearing diameter)...and the accuracy of mtb plastic hub bearing seat is questionable...

Spacers vary in length a bit, but so do the hub dimensions. So, quite hard to achieve a perfect preload with all those loose tolerances.
