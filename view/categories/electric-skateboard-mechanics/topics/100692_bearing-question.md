They should just be normal skate bearing. 
Local skate shop or reds on Amazon.

But they have larger diameter? I am talking about the one in the gear not on the wheel.

Oh well knowing that helps.... Do you have the old bearings still?
Clean them off if so, and see if you can read the numbers on the bearing.
