Hi everyone.

I have found these Pneumatic wheels on Taobao, i think they are fine since Alienpowersystems sells the same set just many times more expensive.

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.5.74392936rSFvix&id=539649943859&ns=1&abbucket=9#detail

But i am looking for some 6 Inch Pneumatic wheels can someone help me? I will not be using them for heavy forrest driving just regular paved roads and occasionally offroad.

The best wheels for me is the ones that still can fit a normal 180mm longboard truck, It work well for me since i have some good trucks with 3d printed mounts and pulleys.

Low profile 6.5" on 8" rim.

The first lot was flown over and sold withn a day. 
The second lot should be on the water and will hopefully arive around easter time. 

The wheel you pointed out is 8" and the bearings sit very far apart, making it impossible to mount the hub onto a skate truck. They are also very heavy and the rubber is probably half rubber and half plastic.
Waste of $.

I'd rather the superstars (those wheels are shit) & i'd mount a socket (or similar as need be) sized to the outer bearing race on my drill press and i'd press the bearing in (if need be) just like I do to replace my bearings and shafts in my press fit electric motors.

You can keep your american screw driver (hammer).

Shity advice is shit, doesn't mean there isn't another way though & you are extending the shity advice paradigm by suggesting those wheels are the way to go...

Actually saying "rather than" didn't mean he was recommending the taobao wheels. It meant he liked the Trampa "Hammer ins" Less. 

Maybe Lawyer isn't the best suggestion either...

[/quote]

Reads pretty black and white dude, Greco stated two options, and he would rather have the taobao wheels than superstars. Re-iterated as much in his follow up post.

Doubled down on shity advice just so he could justify taking a cheap shot at Trampa.

You're seriously going to argue your misinterpreted opinion? Those wheels are shit. I understood what he said perfectly. So did @RedEagle. 

And It hurt your feelings... @GrecoMan you should apologize for jab.

dude I'm not gonna apologize for you misinterpreting what I was saying. I was simply stating that both wheels were bad, but id take the ones OP linked over the superstars. I NEVER SAID EITHER ONE WAS BETTER OR WORSE (OR BAD AND GOOD). my personal preference is way different from real life testing or your personal preference.

I'm not taking it back.

technically he didn't say fast... so he should be able to have it cheap and good, just slow. Meaning it might take a few more years to come out with something good and cheap :P

Dude..the quality of those hubs is 100x worse.
The bearings are pressed in and the hubs themselves out of balance. You'd need a blowtorch, a fridge and two hammers to remove the bearings. Possibly a quantum drive.

Anyway, the OP is not looking to buy these 8'' monstrosities. He is asking for advice on 6'' pneumatic wheels.

Wow this thread is a bit out of hand. Can I get a simple yes or no for the wheels. 

If no then what would be better? Just remember that I will not be doing hardcore Forrest riding

No. Save money for something better, as I mentioned in the other thread.
Out of balance hubs and wheels are even more problematic if you move at higher speeds, which tends to happen more frequently if you stick to regular roads.

These hubs are impossible to balance and will cause speed wobbles.
Just don't. It's a safety hazard.

Its all about finding the sweet spot for Price to performance.
But esk8 is odd because The more expensive stuff are actually worth it. 
(I don't know if trampa is worth it)

3D printed ones for cheap and good wheels with a bit of DIY thrown in: -

psychotillers hubs are in my opinion the best, they're shiny and chrome :slight_smile:. 

Nothing wrong with Trampa's products, it's a reasonably big company and his stuff is quality. their products aren't to my own personal taste but in the end it's about what you want.

Yes it been alot more clear to me now and i have the 3d printed part as my primary way forward. But i would still  like to check the options.

Tire wise they are exactly the same - hub wise these will not fit standard axles as the bearing to bearing distance is too wide.

Good to know thanks. 

So now my big decission is either to use 6 inch wheels and 3d printed hubs. 

or

Find some 8 inch wheels with mountrain board trucks?

What do you guys think?

Those bearings are not rubber sealed (also indicated with 2RS), thus more susceptible to dirt/water ingress.

The acceptable mountainboard trucks start at a price range of 70 euro (MBS or Trampa trucks). Due to the axis length, you are limited to their specific wheels and perhaps a selection of scrub/next hubs if you use your own bearings.

I'm gonna machine some rims/hubs, but don't know what tyres to buy, really any that have a 6 in od are good for me because I will size the rim to the inside, but would like to find something decent.  Any recommendations appreciated, for tyres that are somewhat light and don't have too much rolling resistance and for tubes that fit that tyre.   Also what is the right size is for the inner hole, for a press fit with skateboard bearings?  Thanks in advance for your reply.
