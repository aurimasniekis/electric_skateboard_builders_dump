I saw that torqueboards has used 15mm belts and was wondering if they are worth it or is 9mm for a single motor setup fine? What are the advantages with using bigger belt widths?

are you using a single motor? I think for a single, wider would be better. 
but for a dual motor setup 9mm is sufficient and also helps with space on the truck.

I have used 9mm on my single motor builds, and it works, however it would be better with a little more surface area.

I'm sure there are plenty of places you can get them, but this is the first place I saw on google.

12mm or 15mm is better but it does add to the drag unless your spinning the drive wheel on a bearing which helps but if your using skate trucks most likely not.

12mm is ideal for dual rear since 15mm is a bit tight.

12mm is better than 9mm. If you can 15mm all the better.

But if you find 12mm, 12mm is a custom size.

@NNGG I have about 40 miles on this  [build][1] using a single motor and a 9mm belt. It seems sufficient, I've had no issues and the belt seems stable. As others have noted, 15mm is even better.

but can you use two 12mm TB kits with a dual raptor without cutting the trucks?

raptor dual already has cut trucks

my understanding is that you cannot just buy the enertion 12mm belt kit and throw them on a dual raptor... I thought that's what the video for? To show how to cut the trucks to make them fit.

I don't see why you couldn't, both 9mm and 12mm pulleys need the same amount of aluminum cut from the trucks. I suppose the limiting factor is if the mount and/or motor is too wide to fit dual.

If you have a raptor dual and are upgrading to 12mm you'll probably need to readjust the mount on the trucks.

Hello,
Thank you for contacting Enertion Support. 12mm belts will not fit on the dual motor. There is less space for using a 12mm belt hub in dual motor.
Regards

@onloop. Your thoughts?

Another possibility is enertion are using shorter caliber clones, though i doubt it. You can see in @torqueboards site that he fit dual 12mm pulleys on standard calibers

I asked someone in the chat box at DIY Skateboard if 36T ABEC Pulley Combo Kit would fit the dual raptor and they said it would "probably" fit.

I thought I could just order the 12mm from Enertion and pop them in like the 9mm. and just re align the mounts.

They should fit fine. But I'm not aware of the actual specs and sizes of the Enertion trucks and/or Mounts.

but the motor pulley is exactly 9mm (or just enough to fit a 9mm belt) right?

correct.. I am talking about buying the kit..belt,pulley etc and just changing it out so i can run a 12mm. Enertion told me I can't do it, DIY says probably...I thought this would be something easy to do for a noob like me in the near future... guess not

No it should work, a little unnecessary on the dual drive though.

i broke a 9mm belt in a month on dual. I wouldn't say unnecessary, just more robust.

Fair enough. I would consider 9mm to be acceptable on a dual drive though. Unless you run this: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/nyc-drivetrain-of-death/9006?u=michaeld33

for sure, 9mm dual is just fine. I'm still going to run it on that board. My next board will be 12mm duals though.

Definitely go wider.

If your running single drive and throw a belt then it's possible to have runaway speed on a downhill.

I have had 9mm belts just fly off with no warning. Fortunately not on downhill.

The 12mm belts from Polybelt have so far held up much better.

I ate 9mm belts constantly under braking on single drive 12S Lipo 6374.  Went to 15mm and it is rock solid.  I would not run 9mm on a single drive.

yeah using DIY 16t 12mm motor pulley and DIY's ABEC 36t 12mm wheel pulley.

It works but couldn't be another 1 mm wider without rubbing.

Takes a little more effort to align

## \#37 Posted by: CSN Posted at: 2016-09-23T23:14:40.498Z Reads: 116

depends on the motor mount thickness and if there are recesses for bolts etc.

It's very close fit.

If the wheel pulley has it own bearing then trucks need to be cut.

If regular wheel pulley then an extra washer might be enough for clearance.
