It is time to get down to business with this never ending debate. We need to be myth busters and use real life testing to make a pros vs cons list of both FOC and BLDC.
I want to know, why do YOU use FOC or BLDC? Why do you use this vs the other? Why should I (or anyone else) use it?

I can't tell any real difference in range after a few hundred miles.

FOC does take a couple MPH off the top speed.

Perhaps FOC riders should gear a touch higher to compensate.

I am enjoying 2.25 gearing 16/36 97mm wheels. Rider weight #145

@link5505 I'll offer a non-scientific entry; I like the way that FOC sounds and feels, so that's why I use it. I find that I have much better low-speed performance, and I end up in a lot of low-speed scenarios during my commutes. The quiet operation is more practical for me considering the suburban environment I ride in. 

I'm aware that I may lose a few mph at the top end, but that makes no difference to me, the top speed of my build is already faster than I care to ride so I limit it using ERPM. I top out at 22mph and average 12-15mph on my 6-mile rides, which is perfect for me.

I have plenty of torque in FOC mode; I can climb all the hills in my area. I don't feel like I've lost much by using FOC, and I gain smoother starts, silent operation, and overall smooth acceleration that I prefer.

The loss mainly comes in readily-accessible options in BLDC Tool. Since BLDC Mode came first, it has a lot of easily accessible features like "startup boost" and ERPM settings. There aren't a lot of features to try in FOC mode; you essentially do the motor configurations and that's pretty much it.

@link5505 I started with a VESC from Enertion with a C18 mod but after about 140 miles I blew the DRV8302 chip. I think it failed because two motor leads made contact.

 I'm now using an Ollinboard VESC while I replace the DRV chip in my original.

I live in a quiet town and I ride at 9 or 10 at night. BLDC would not fly in my hood.

I've been sticking with BLDC on my old 4.7/4.8 VESCs.  I have a 4.12 i got used w/ dead DRV.  After repair i might try FOC on it.  

What i remember reading on FOC was a sacrifice for top speed - slightly more efficient, and better low end torque.  Can anyone who's gone FOC confirm?  

I could care less about top speed (reasonably - i gear for about 25 and rarely go full speed).  But startup and off-the-line acceleration is much more important.  I usually gear pretty low 13 or 14 / 36 on 8s and 83/97mm wheels.  190-200kv motors.

My bad, I meant that FOC in general is the more proper way. Now I made a little research about current vesc hw rev and found out it's really not ready for reliably handle FOC on a lot of motors. The fact that when Ben made first revisions of the board, he didn't really think FOC will be big, so he made them "foc-ready", but not really "foc-oriented" adds to this conclusion. It seems v6 will be a lot more robust in this regard.

i re-flashed the firmware to have factory settings and then just set up foc. since my last vesc repair it works flawlessly!

p.s.: I just think foc somehow runs cooler under load - it might not resolve your issue generally. for me it was just on the edge I guess - bldc was a little bit too warm and foc is just cool enough to make it up there. guess it could help you a little, but it wont allow you to magically get up any hill without overheating. ;)

As now I have a backup vesc I upgraded to the latest firmware and switched to FOC. Rode 2 miles with it and it seems all very good so far, not only the board is more silent but the acceleration and braking is much smoother too, let's see for how long this vesc will last :slight_smile:  :upside_down: :slight_smile:  :upside_down: (this vesc already has ~150 miles on it with bldc) 


setup: 6S - 6374 sensored motor + vesc from esk8.de

edit: rode  18 km (~10 miles) and made a quick "timelapse" video (2 hours shooting and editing/publishing) of 3-4 miles track: (https://maps.app.goo.gl/i/wDQSU - back and forth, recommended route if you're in london east / se)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqS5nSAGw9A

 the steps to switch to FOC with a similar setup like mine are:
- flash new firmware (optional but recommended)
- set battery (cutoff start and end) and motor parameters (motor max), I left battery current limits parameters at their defaults
- set rpm limit if needed (high kv / high voltage, not in my case)
- FOC detection process - Measures + Calc CC - Apply/Apply 
- test, run FOC detection process again
- check that the buggy value hasn't raised in Advanced (current ramp step should stay around 0.04)
- configure remote

edit2 - WARNING: FOC may destroy your VESC - I noticed that on a brand new Enertion VESC powering a brand new RSPEC 6374, following the same procedure that works for the esk8.de VESC and sensored motor, the motor was failing to spin at startup sometimes, I ignored the issue and boom, after 5 min ride time the vesc caught fire - use at your own risk

Well, correct me if I am wrong.
When we say FOC, we mean vector control, and it must be Sinusoidal wave. Its Sinusoidal wave on BLDC.   In my understanding  FOC on BLDC means control the current and only give high current when that current generate more torque (power in tangential velocity).  And when the current generate no torque.
I think when you say BLDC, you guys mean SQARE WAVE driven motors.  Square wave give max current on all wires, no matter how little torque that current generates.  And the ESC don't care where the place of the spinner relative to the Pemenant magnetic.   This way, a lot of useless current is flowing,  more heat, more battery wasted.
I am no expert, I do want to share with you guys and learn from you guys.

```
Sinusidal ware (FOC) means supply less current in the wire, when current on flow in that wire generate much Radial force and little Tangential force.   So, this way, the Tangential force is smaller in the FOC set up compared with other method (Square wave).  Imaging a man pushing a desk.
 Sqare wave is like a man who push a desk NOT in horizental direction but still he use his max strength.   FOC is like a man who only use max strength when he is push in direction horizental.

I just tried FOC for the first time on my board. It's an Arcboard converted deck to a  TB 6374 motor and 16/36 ratio. It is really quiet and smooth at low speeds but after a certain amp rating/motor load, it seems to have this really loud jet engine noise kick in! It's a sudden noise and sounds like a turbine. You can hear it more obviously at 0:16

I'm used to BLDC for my previous builds which is generally noisier all around. I'm wondering if this is due to configuration problem or is FOC supposed to sound like this? I have no other reference.

I've noticed that using FOC mode on my board causes it to have ABS_OVER_CURRENT faults frequently, pulling up to 261 amps at times (according to the data displayed when I look at the faults on the computer). This causes my board to shutdown for a couple moments. In BLDC mode I never have this issue, and I find BLDC mode to be more responsive and predictable. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

Hey mate, im having the exact same issue. Thinking of going back to BLDC. I'm using an Enertion Focbox for my ESC in FOC mode, and at least once or twice a day i get ABS_OVER_CURRENT. It's pretty scary when you're doing around 35-40kph and go for the brakes and they just arent there until your board starts working again.

What setup are you running with FOC?

i re-did the measurements part of the BLDC tool setup and i dont seem to have problems after making both focboxes identical with their settings. 

both are running individually (no CAN bus) just a Y splitter and ive cut the ground going from one of the focboxes to my receiver. its working really well

I have been running the same SK8 VESC with different motors and with a mix of FOC and PWM/BLDC control modes. It seems that I'm getting substantially better efficiency with PWM/BLDC mode than with FOC, I'm afraid. Like 15-20% difference in PWM mode's favour. I can even feel the motors getting more warm with FOC, so it's no mystery where the power goes.

FOC mode sounds better / more quiet, though.

I have just concluded a simple 3km test with the exact same set-up and near identical condition. In FOC, the recharge was 1020mAh, and in normal PWM ("BLDC") mode, the recharge was 860mAh. The motor also seemed noticably cooler in "BLDC" mode.

**So, in my case,  "BLDC" mode outperforms FOC mode in efficiency**  ![:shock:|15x17](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif)

Yes, I thought so too, but there may be an issue with FOC if running at near maximum rpm.

I don't think that is the case here, though, as I've tried with 4 different motors and gearings, and I get the same suspicious drop in efficiency everytime I use FOC mode.

No, that would not be an implication of the FOC being more effective. Not in my book, at least.

Haven't ridden BLDC in a few months now. FOC is just much smoother and leave your build with more of a polished feeling. 

Have not had any issues running VescX/Focbox. 

Now bldc and FOC feel pretty identicle at any rolling speed there is just a sound difference and a much smoother start from dead which makes a huge huge difference riding pnumatics in the grass or gravel.

Have you tried to kick push a pnumatics wheel board in the grass to get it going in bldc? It's not easy and I have thrown my back out doing that haha.

I think you must be mistaken then. Just because the motor is hotter doesn't mean it's less effecient.

If the test conditions were actually the same, and both tests provided the same amount of braking power, and FOC generated more mAh, then FOC would be more effecient, completely regardless of the motor heat. The losses would be in your battery heat, vesc heat, AND motor heat combined.

Think his comparison is of recharge amp hours and having ridden w foc needed more. 

But why canâ€™t we change frequency in bldc similar to how u can in foc?

Thereâ€™s another thread here showing testing of foc efficiency being bad and the programming I think was suspected

Another problem with that comparison is that it been discovered recently that the energy computation of the vesc may be far off, and the switching frequency has a key hole in it

Since BLDC uses variable switching frequency, we canâ€™t even do an external measurement and find a correction factor since it will be dependent on how you ride

The safest way to assume would be to charge to full and do a full discharge test,
Same course, keeping the same speed by limiting in vesc tool and see which one you can go farther

There is next to none energy dissipation in the battery and VESC. At least they don't get warm. I only base my idea of the FOC mode's lower (overall) efficiency on the **recharge figures**. I can simply ride 15-20% longer on the exact same set-up in BLDC mode, and that makes a huge difference for me.

Yes, I am using charge testing. And range testing: I simply can't make the same distance in FOC mode.

Clearly I'm missing something then, because your figures clearly show that you generated more recharge capacity on FOC, yet you're saying you rode further on BLDC?

That would mean that either, you were riding faster on FOC and we're braking at higher speeds, you were braking more frequently, or that you were braking harder and accelerating more.

And I'm not basing that on any technical knowledge of the vesc, I just know that what comes in goes out. Conservation of energy and all that.

You are misunderstanding. He means that is the amount he is charging the pack after a ride. I don't think he is talking about the regenerative recharge of the pack during a ride.

Exactly. I have disabled regen until I have the dual direction tensioner system. The charging mentioned is after the ride.

**EDIT: For posters below; My set-up is on a bicycle with dual disk brakes. I just posted here, because it seemed the only place with an active discussion on FOC vs BLDC.**

Isnâ€™t disabling regenerative braking the same as disabling brakes?

No when you disable regen braking you just disable the ablility to charge the battery when you brake. You are still able to brake

Well thatâ€™s bloody news to me. So I was missing something. 

Even so is it still correct for electric skateboards then that when you disable regen that you can still brake and that the current is simply transferred to heat via the motors?
Surely this would overheat our motors really fast.
