I've recently seen some builds with 5"-6.5" tires on really wide hubs, what tire/hub combo are you guys choosing for these builds?

These are the tires I was talking about thanks @Skunk

However I wonder if there are wider hubs available, not a fan of the 3 spoke design, I'd like to see something like a sports car wheel design and wider than regular hubs just to have a wider look

I would LOVE a wide low profile, flat contact surface tire.
Something with a old 70s/80s vibe hub.

The problem isn't the hub. Its finding tires....
