guys I have a little problem regarding some pulleys i have thread locked on the motors, now I canâ€™t remove the motors and use my mounts itâ€™s annoying. 
The thread lock is really strong
What should I do ? do you think some heat will be enough to remove the puley ?

Heat will be enough. I use a super hot air gun with fine nozzle.

whatever you do do not and i repeat do not use the red threadlocker. its permanent and will strip any screw you try to get out. i have had experience :wink:

For screws I generakky use blue trhead lock it's great. I have some red thread lock as well so I shouldn't use this one ? The thread lock i used for the pulley was green and apparently very strong 

Blue and red are not enough to use for pulley right ? it's only medium strenght

blue should be fine if you have like 2 set screws on pulley. do not use red unless you plan on never ever taking out the screw

ive used both blue and red. blue is very strong but not permanent so with a bit of force i could get a screw out of blue threadlocker without stripping it. not red

I have no screws on the pulleys that's why i had to buy and use thread lock on the first place. Normaly I use a keylock but there's not any on the shaft of APS motors... I had to change all my drive train just because of this ( and the 1 cm bore instead of the usual 8 mm I wish I had double checked )

in that case i would recommend trying to drill and tap 2 holes and using some set screws.

 you don't need set screws, in fact they will be the weak point if you use them...

thread locker and you are good to go!

Problem is the neck of the pulley is alloy and not very thick. if you want to go all mech. engineer and do the calc. you can but I can't be ass'ed... the alloy is soft and thin, the screw is hardened steel, the surface area of alloy threads in contact is low... you just can't apply that much force without stripping...
the thread locker provides more grip over the entire area in contact.

and shit [like this can happen](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/daily-driver-v2-0-35-holypro-trampa-vertigo-trucks-aps-6384s-170kv-4kw-custom-directdrive-12s-custom-esc/36560/100?u=cobber).

how are you guys building boards without a heatgun? what do use to heat shrink?

applying heat until a little wisp of smoke is released should melt the threadlock and allow you to remove the pulley...

PREACH!  

For real though, I use the hot air gun on my soldering station and that tiny little wiper arm remover and it works every time...and the bonus is that it doesn mar or bend the inside collar on the motor pulley.

for me this method of hiting didnt work.
but in this process i learned something usefull, the brand of allen keys

i used to have cheap allen keys which destroyed all my screws. using a good brand you wont destroy your screw and you will have more "torque", so maybe you will be able to remove your lockthread screw

the brand is called GEDORE

Guilty here as I either use my wifeâ€™s pink blow dryer or blow torch which never burnt anything

What exactly are the benefits of a heat gun if the heat and air from a blow dryer is doing the job? Am planning to get one though.

Try using a lighter or just go buy a flame torch for 10$ like that with a small propane tank under it

Yes this is totally doable, but industrial heat air guns are cool, you can fire up some charcoal if you run out of woods for a bbq

Mission accomplished, the first one went out easily but i had a hard time to remove the 2nd one ! 
I used this torch and it went well

I have a cheap soldering iron but no heat gun however I do have heat shrink, heat gun, nice soldering iron, and a lot of small and large screw drivers plus screws at work.  But seriously if anyone doesnt want to spend the money on that stuff atleast get them from harbor freight to do the job.

To remove my motor pulley, i pressed it with 2 wooden blocks on a vice,  used my 100W soldering iron, tinned the tip and pulley, put the iron tip on the pulley for 3min. then i just pulled the motor and it came off easily.
