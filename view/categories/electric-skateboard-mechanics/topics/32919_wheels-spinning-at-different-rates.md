Here is a link to the video that should help show the issue,

I was also wondering if I went into bldc tool if that could help effect it at all?

I went into bldc and ran start detection, but it only ran for one wheel and I clicked apply, did I mess it up there? If so how do I run the other wheel on bldc?

```
you need to run detection for each vesc individually.

each vesc has his own micro usb port. what do you mean by only one ?? can you describe more your setup ? vesc and connection to your motors?

```
Then it should be 2 Vescs connected over CAN bus, so you can connect to the usb port and choose CAN forward to ID 1:

Then you are connected with your slave (second) Vesc and you can do all your settings there.
If you have further questions, iÂ´m sure @Kaly will help you out ;)

guys, I would be careful telling him to mess with the can settings. The OP doesn't seem to know much about vesc configs. Worst thing that can happen to him right now is that he blows a drv because of a can setting.
