Excited to get my first build underway. Looking forward to posting in the E-board "builds" category one day soon! But first, a few questions:

1) **37" Arbor Vugenhausen** deck -  Is this deck going to be too big to be maneuverable enough for urban commuting?

2) **Protoboard Motor Mount** - Has anyone had experience with this vendor? His Caliber [motor mount](http://www.proto-boards.com/product-page/6e3dc19c-5e3b-08f6-1817-3f752d70525b) is the most reasonably priced that I've seen on the market.

3) **Pulley system for 80mm Kegels**, I'm planning on a [3D printed wheel pulley](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1677410) and an eBay motor pulley (e.g. [1](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HTD-5M-16T-16W-5-6-6-35-8-10-12mm-Bore-Pitch-5mm-Synchronous-Timing-Belt-Pulley-/262711471664?var=&hash=item3d2ad2ee30:m:mq4H33KsMh709aVt4dpPjlA) or [2](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HTD-5M-16T-5mm-Pitch-16mm-Width-Timing-Belt-Drive-Pulley-Choose-Bore-16-Teeth-/262711723502?var=&hash=item3d2ad6c5ee:m:mOCOih3nrTU7cWV-MewXmOA)). Is this an exercise in futility? Are there any less expensive options than the $50 DIYElectric solution?

Thanks for your help!

just received my @ProtoBoards mount yesterday.
It looks very nice :thumbsup:

Service was also excellent.

Don't be fooled though - the motor in the picture is only attached with 2 srews because the mounting hole distance is different to the more common SK3s and other 63 motors. Seems to hold quite nicely however. Will try it like this.

That's what I use, its by far the best deck I've ever owned.  It turns great, no worries.
