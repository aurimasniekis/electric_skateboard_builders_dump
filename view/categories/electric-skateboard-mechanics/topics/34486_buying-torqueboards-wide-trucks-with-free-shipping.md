Hey guys so I really want to get a set of the Torqueboards wide trucks (linked below) but the shipping for one piece way too expensive to Europe. So my plan is to gather a least 5 people to get over the 300USD mark to get free shipping. 
So far:
martinsp 1 set
@I82 1 set
@bigben 2 sets
@monkey32 1 set  
@stormboard1 1 set 
@Ishayc 1 set
@Trans-amers 1 set
@ARetardedPillow 1 set (confirm please)
@Youssless 1 set
@tueboard 1 set 
 
   

collections/longboard-trucks/products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks
The way I think it could work out is that one of us orders the trucks so we all would send money (PayPal for safety) to that person and that person would order it and then shipping in Europe is cheap (under 10â‚¬). If you have any better idea I am open to hearing it! :)

just curious, how much does it cost for TB to ship to Europe ?
```

## \#3 Posted by: Martinsp Posted at: 2017-10-01T17:33:08.419Z Reads: 334

```
40USD which is like 2 thirds of the price of the trucks :D so in theory we can save 30USD/25â‚¬ on shipping each, considering that the shipping inside europe is 10USD/8.4â‚¬

HI Martin,
Where are you?
I was happy to order 5 sets so they get delivered to the UK!
Then if I need to I can send on a few others.. Or stockpile like I seem to like doing!

I am located in Slovakia. So we could even maybe get a discount along with the free shipping. Maybe :D hopefully, that would mean we could order 8 sets if I am not mistaken. 
Not sure what stockpile is :D

I am in Spain and I will apreciate a sensible shipping rate and not a killer international flat rate. Being this accomplished, i don't care if my trucks come from Slovakia or UK ;)
Are you guys in hurry?
The paypal payment seems great to me, pretty much like the aussies group buy was done. Confidence inspiring.

Best regards ;)

Oh I see :D 

So as a recap so we are all clear. You @bigben  would order 5 pieces, then there is me in for 1, @monkey32 for 1 and @I82 in for 1 set. That makes it 8 sets total. I just asked if we could get a discount so we will see when they get back to me...

I dont have problems sending it out from me. I will look up the prices.

Ok so I was just redirected to email communication by Alex. 

I asked if there is any chance they could send the package marked as a gifht or say that it has no value so that we could avoid paying tax and import fees. Because that would mean 20%+ on tax and some import fees may apply to :/ that would suck.

It is possible still. Seems like bigben might drop out if he has not already so with you we might be back to 4 sets :confused:

The thing that worries me is the tax and sh*t. I am really hoping that they reply positively to the email :D

that is not true all the timeðŸ˜‚ depends on whats the value, where you are and which shipping company is used. 
I've sent 5 FOCBOX's from here and no one got charged) I sent them as gifts though.

@monkey32 offer is very good, but I would like to have them a bit sooner if possible.

I would be interested in one set. No rush, end of Nov fine with me.
But I'm now lost on the solution for delivery: if @monkey32 takes them back from US, why are they landing in Switzerland? 
@bigben are you ordering on your side or did you just st give up? 

By the way @monkey32 could you also take me back a pair of 15 deg Khiro risers?  Can't find them in Europe :wink:

15 euro's would be the tracked priority shipping and you'd have them by the end of October)

If monkey gets them then they don't land in Switzerland, they will only see the Swiss land if I buy them for you guys) and I am ahaha

No import fees and no trans-atlantic shipping if you wait till late Nov. with me. I've have two successful GB bringing FOC BOXs to Europe...........

Just to clarify, that's a bit off. We do not use a gift option for sending out packages international. We may put a lower value amount but it is not a gift option. If your package is opened and they search for the real value. You will have to pay for import tax. Unfortunately, that is not something we control. Richard has been corrected.

It costs us anywhere from $60-$120 to ship to EU/AUS. Very expensive :cry: Definitely, far more than the $40 flat rate which we charge.

@Youssless Haven't tried but I doubt it. They are much longer than 74mm. With our motors, you can fit Dual 6374 and 15mm wide pulleys which we also have.

You may very well be sending me two motors and two sets of 15mm drive trains in a few months

Hi, you can. But with the tax and potential import charges to europe on such a large order, it would probably be a bit of a problem. The thing is that there is not a way to know if the package is going to be stopped at customs since they mostly do just random picks. I think that this group buy thing wont be happening unfortunately :( :(

Guys I just updated the first post with new names, I think we should discuss more about the paying and shipping. I think it is a lot of risk to get the money from you for the order and then be like oh there is customs so I will need 20% of the price from all of you... The import fee is more or less the same in European countries so whoever orders these will have to face this.
Please let me all of you know what you think as this is important. 
Thank you all in advance, regards Martin.

Yeah but for the vast majority of us who are ordering a pair, we may fall under the threshold for gifts and thus avoid paying customs. So if a US participant in this group buy got hold of em and sent them out to each person we'd pay a little more than â‚¬10 for shipping I'd imagine but still less than $40 and not have to pay customs... Potentially.

How much is VAT in Germany? Not sure if I'm qualified to do group buys, VAT in Finland is 24% and shipping from here to overseas expensive AF.

So it's approx 74 euros shipped if I'm correct. And 91 euros if I order just one for me. Maybe we should ask about VAT value DIY is going to put in a shipping.

```
Worth noting that US sales tax should be deducted by  since they are not supposed to collect it for international orders, so the actual price should be up to 16% lower. Since for an order of that size duties and VAT are going to be paid on import, it makes sense to at least try and claim that.

Alternatively, if they don't want to do that, the person that handles the group order could ask them to misdeclare the piece value, like they do for individual orders, so that less VAT/duties are paid to counter the above extra charge. Obviously the right way is to deduct the sales tax, but it's more important that the buyers don't get charged more than they should.
