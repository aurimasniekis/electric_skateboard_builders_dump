You should be able to find regular ABEC bearing with the ID you want so you can use regular wheels on those trucks.  I bought some 9.5mm ID bearings so I could use thane on ATS 12 trucks.

The last selection on the list is the demensions for the bearings that come with superstar wheels if they r the same as the hypa then it should work just one mm of width extra and the 8mm id to work on regular axles I have ordered them when I receive them I will let you know how they work

Yes you would need longer axles either way.

Cheapest things to do would be to remove part of the hanger to expose more of the axle. Or purchase tb218 trucks from diyelectricskateboards.com

@Acido, I read on the Trampa site their 125 mm Gummies fit the Hypa rim, but says nothing about working with the SuperStar rim (??) I previously thought it was designed for both rims but I guess I was wrong. What do you know about It?

I ask because I think I got a partial solution for this dilema.... If they Gummies by any chance, also work on the SuperStar, we may overcome the 12 mm - 10 mm limitation (don't know why Trampa behave like this producing parts few could use, disregarding 95% of the esk8ing world which uses the universal 8 mm axle diameter ??)....

...Board Bumpers already offers this 8 mm axle Trampa SuperStar Hub Bearing Adapter Set. Check It out...

Hypa and Superstar hubs are the same size... One is sixspoke plastic one is five spoke aluminum... Fyi

Superstar have the the retainer and are multipiece... Hypa are just two plastic halves

Yes I know. I've seen them. Been surfing Trampa's site. But wasn't sure about the hub size, plus they only advertize the Black Gummie for the Hypa, not the SuperStar.....

...although it says the Red and Blue Gummies (advertized as "125 Gummies") fits on both Hypa and SuperStar hubs.... :point_down:

![image|690x423](upload://bwdFv9O1hyZNQ6v19ANJlcZ3xBk.jpg)

... on the other side it says the Black Gummie (advertized as "125 Hypa Wheel") only work on CUSTOM Hypa hubs... :point_down:

![image|690x308](upload://johPWqXyHEGwqlwGYSS6D99zjGo.jpg)


...and is the Black Gummie precisely the one users are intereted the most. This is what says about the bearings: 12 x 16 x 18.2mm Bearing & Axle support Spacer on 12mm Axles.

Nah... They advertised the black gummies for both. That's what I bought(gummies superstars)

Blue and red we're 76a nd 78a

Black is 75A

@trampa mind clearing up some confusion :)

Do you have a pic with the whole axle? I´m thinking about putting the TB trucks with Superstar Hubs and 6,5 Urban tyres on the new Hummie deck

like you see in the pic above but maybe more suiting. To fit your superstar hubs to 8mm trucks like TB 218mm

You probably want our 240mm LB Truck together with the Bearings. Coming soon, featuring 9.525mm axles.

Yeap @Gromok :+1:. Third party for the moment. Theres no other way now. As usual, stubborn companies intending to sell 'a couple of trucks' to users, going against the market trend, the costumers wishes, and failing to forsee the sales potential for hundreds of rims (??) :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

8 mm esk8 axles account for what?? ...90% ...95% of the worlds market?? For some, another example where.... the forest is hidden away behind the trees.
