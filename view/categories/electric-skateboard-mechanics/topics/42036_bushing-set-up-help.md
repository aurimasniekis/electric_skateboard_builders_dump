Since I manufacture RipTide Bushings I have extensive knowledge of bushings and how to set up your trucks to do what you want to set up to do, including wedging and de-wedging.  Unfortunately, many trucks for the electric market are clones of other trucks at least in appearance but they do  not necessarily use the same sized bushing as the trucks they look like.  If you want help setting your trucks up, I created this thread for that purpose.

In order for me to make an informed bushing recommendation, I would appreciate the following information:

1) The brand of truck you are using plus the base plate angles and hanger width.  If it is a clone, I need the bushing Outside Diameter, Inside Diameter height to the .1" or .1 mm, and shape (normally a Cone/Cone, Cone/Barrel or Barrel/Barrel for stock set ups).

2) If you are using aftermarket bushings, I need the bushing brand, duro and shape that are in the trucks currently.

3) I need to know how the trucks feel and what you want to change: Do you want it looser, tighter, more stable, less stable, more rebound, less rebound, etc..

4) Type of skating you want to use the setup for.

5) Deck you are using and how likely the set up will wheel bite.

6) How much you weigh.

To keep things simple (I hope), when I respond to your question and you have additional questions, I will add to or edit my initial response.  Does this board notify you of edits like it does likes and responses?

This is great @Alphamail so many people skip over this important piece. 

I'd trust anything this guy says ^ being a president for one of the best bushing manufacturer out. They literally have a bushing and pivot cup for every truck you can imagine.

Hells yes I'm taking advantage of your very kind offer:

1) Caliber II 50s all stock and genuine.

2) No aftermarket bushings.... Yet :wink:

3)  I've tightened them down with the kingpin and whilst I get great stability at high speeds (30mph) my turning circle is atrocious (~2.5m by my guesstimate). I run my front trucks looser so its dipped down a bit but I believe I need to change me bushings. 

4) They're responsive and have decent rebound but I'd like to find an optimal compromise between stability and turning circle (so I suppose stability whilst running trucks looser). Not sure how realistic my wants are. If I can squeeze in more rebound that'd be super and would help me weave between manhole covers more swiftly. 

5) drop through deck with cutouts, no wheelbite (will hit the trucks before I hit the wheels). Edit: deck is 40 inches long. 

6) about 195lbs or 89kg.

Let me know if I missed anything/wasn't clear anywhere.

Thanks again!

From my experience with clone trucks, the biggest issue is the pivot cup.
That is the part that the clones can't seem to get right when copying name brand trucks like Calibers.
I took a pair of 218mm Caliber II clones and put the hangers on genuine Caliber II base plates so that I could
run upgraded pivot cups.

Actually intrested in your opinion since I am still not completely happy with my freeride set up. Thanks a lot for your effort and input !!

1.) Bear Kodiak, 45 degree baseplates, 180mm hanger$

2.) Back truck: 94a Riptide KranK TallBarrel board side / 90a Tal Barrel Fruit Punch Ronin OEM Bushings streetside
   Front truck : 94a   Tall barrel Fruit Punch Ronin OEM Bushings board side / Tall Barrel Bear bushing 90a streetside

3,)A little bit more freedom, more responsiveness and smoother carve. Also easier time seting up slides.

4.)Freeride / DH. No technical slides, mostly fast freeride.

5.) Rayne otherside v2, not wheelbites ever. even with 76mm wheels

6.)85kg

Here's that post. The baseplates between the 180 and 218 are the same..I have them in hand

[quote="Alphamail, post:17, topic:10090"]
OK, here is what I found about the Torqueboard 50 degree V2 trucks and what RipTide fits where for upgrade purposes.  The pivot cup that fits is our Indy 96a WFB pivot.  It is dimensionally very close to the stock pivot and goes into the base plate a little easier than we like to see but it is tighter on the hanger pivot nose so it does make for a functionally good tight fit when assembled.  As for bushings, the trucks will accept our standard longboard bushings both boardside and roadside.  The hanger will take the following shapes that we make:  Cone, Barrel, Canon, and FatCone.  The tightest fit in the hanger is the Canon bushing which is slightly larger diameter than our Barrel.  Additionally, the king pin length does not leave much room so you may elect to not use a boardside bushing at all when using two .6" tall bushings or you can run our Street series bushings in the roadside position since they are .5" tal

Alrighty, I'll gladly take this offer!

1) Torqueboards caliber clone, same measurements as Caliber II 50s

2)stock bushing

3) I'd like something more stable at speed

4) mostly commute

5) I'm using the redemberboards shuggah deck. There'll probably be wheelbight with the 6' pneumatics I want to start running, there's no wheelbite with my MBS 101s

6) 145 lbs

Thanks!!

Thank you @Youssless:  

We  developed a compound called KranK for just this type of situation.  There are several ways to approach what you are confronted with.  First of all realize and appreciate that it takes a high amount of skill to go fast on 50 degree trucks as they are inherently unstable.  Caliber II's address this a bit with zero rake making them a bit less responsive so they are more stable than a raked truck at the same angle base plate under most conditions.  I would suggest as a "Synthetic Split" set up where you use bushings to simulate a de-wedged rear truck thus taking some of the steering input out of the rear.  This is similar to what you are doing running the front truck looser.  I would suggest RipTide KranK 90a Canons up front top and bottom, starting with flat washers and a KranK 90a Canon / KranK 90a Chubby rear with a cupped washer on the Canon and a the big flat that comes with the Chubby.  Experiment with cupped washers up front to fine tune the feel.  The KranK compound is our highest rebound compound and it is very responsive to clamp pressure of the king pin nut.  The starting point for compression of the bushing stack is to tighten the nut just to the point where you can still turn the roadside bushing in the bushing seat by hand then adjust from there. The Canon is slight larger diameter than our Barrel so it fits the Caliber bushing seat better since the seat is a bit sloppy.  

Whenever you change you busing set up, remember to check for wheel bite before you ride.

Interesting set up, is this an eSk8?

In any event with at least 3 different brands of bushings in your set up: RipTide, Ronin and Bear, I suggest focusing on one compound and maintaining the split duros.  Try running KranK 90a/93a TallBarrels front and back.  With a full Krank set up you can run it with a loose center and dive hard into it when initiating a slide and it will support you well.

OK @anorak234 some notes about the Torqueboard 50 degree V2 trucks and what RipTide fits where for upgrade purposes. The pivot cup that fits is our Indy 96a WFB pivot. It is dimensionally very close to the stock pivot and goes into the base plate a little easier than we like to see but it is tighter on the hanger pivot nose so it does make for a functionally good tight fit when assembled. As for bushings, the trucks will accept our standard longboard bushings both boardside and roadside. The hanger will take the following shapes that we make: Cone, Barrel, Canon, and FatCone. The tightest fit in the hanger is the Canon bushing which is slightly larger diameter than our Barrel. Additionally, the king pin length does not leave much room so you may elect to not use a boardside washer at all when using two .6" tall bushings or you can run our Street series bushings in the roadside position since they are .5" tall compared to the longboard series which is .6" tall

Additional notes on stability:  With a symmetrical set you (50 front and rear) running a tighter rear than the front goes a long way to make a more stable set up coupled with keeping more than 50% of your weight over the front truck.  

Since the Torqueboard 50 degree V2 trucks do not fit our Chubby bushing, the best next thing is the RipTide FatCone to run in the boardside position in the rear coupled with a RipTide StreetBarrel roadside.  For the front I suggest a Canon boardside and StreetBarrel roadside.  The boardside bushings in this set up are .6" tall and the roadside are .5" tall so you can run washers in all positions giving you additional options for dialing in the set up with flat verses cupped washers.  For your weight I suggest KranK 87a.all around.  The Fatcone is the key here to changing the response of the rear truck to a progressive ramp up in resistance where the front is a linear response

This or baseplate splits even by a couple degrees offset the front and rear truck so they don't oscillate off of one another like they would at the same angle. Certainly helps with speed stability.

Base plate splits are definitely better than a synthetic split,  Usually the place to start is with a lower degree rear base plate or de-wedging the rear to make the king pin angle closer to perpendicular to the ground.  This can get tricky since all the power is driving the rear wheels in most cases and the wiring may need to be modified.

That is true... But even the smallest split can make a board stable...haha ever seen someone go 35mph+ on a Loaded vanguard? While.i don't suggest it because the vanguard is a noodle, a 46r/50f split makes it stable. I could barely hit 20's when I had the same angles due to how much torsional flex it has and the front and rear oscillating off of one another.

Thanks @Apolo 

The Bustin sportster 33 is easy to modiify to prevent wheel bite since it is Bamboo / Maple construction so you might want to consider making some changes to the deck.  You can get more rebound by using either RipTide APS or KranK with KranK being our highest rebound compound to date.  For your you weight on a symmetrical set up I would go with a Canon / FatCone set up in either APS 87.5a or KranK 87a.  The FatCone Boardside will give you a lot more support and progressively ramp up resistance the further you lean.  This works well for set ups that have a potential for wheel bite.  Like I said, if you can modify the deck to eliminate the wheel bite issue first, you will be a lot happier in the long run.  If you want a really stable, high performance set up, you may want to consider running a Caliber II 44 degree rear to take some of the steering input out of the back.  If you do that, I would suggest running a Canon / Canon front and a Cannon / Chubby rear in the same compound /druos listed above.  Since the rear is at 44 degrees, you have greater leverage over the bushings so you need to use either a larger bushing (suggested) or a harder bushing in the rear

I have been using the fatcone bs on my rear truck with good effect on my traction, it works much better for me than a chubby because it allows more turn but retains the stably with more urethane, it acts almost like a taller pushing and I like taller bushings..The Krankz are the best for carrying any amount of weight and retaining rebound, I have about 235lbs on my deck when I'm riding and I still want a lively feel so I can carve and shred and the high rebound does that. I tried the WFB as well and they seems a little less lively, but super stable and comfortable..I tend to run harder duro on the bs of every truck and softer on the rs to tune the lean, I think of the boardside bushing (bs) to be the support of the deck and road feel, while the road-side bushing is used to tune the lean and carve, it depends on the bushing seat shape though and different trucks are different trucks, the surfrodz bushing seat almost provides a progress feel when using just a barrel while the same barrel in a Caliber will feel pretty constant and linear, best bet to to trial and error till you tune to the feel YOU like..it is sort of subjective that way after you get the functionality dialed or close to what you need..

I don't ride anything else besides Riptide bushings now (a downhiller named Jake "wingnut" Knutson turned me onto them), they have one for everything. I have recently tried the new Hardcore barrels and they have a nice rebound as well, but no where near the options Riptide has when it comes to fine tuning. Ace trucks are the only bushings I leave stock, they just fit me well and my weight out of the box, I sometimes use Bones hardcore on tkp trucks for bowls and things when the stocks are just too soft for my fat manatee like body and I need to check out the shorter street truck options from Riptide as well.

 I have some in the Liquid Attack tkp trucks and they are really nice in that truck, I wonder how they work in Bennet, Tracker, Independent...I have run Riptide barrels and fatcones and chubbies, in Arsenal, Avenue, Caliber and Paris, and they just feel better than anything I have tried. Blood orange seems rubbery, Venom seems mushy, Reflex are nice but limited to a few great uses like Bennett, and the Nipples are a weird size I only use in the Bolzen trucks where they fit better than anything else, they are like a street truck where the bs bushing is taller than the rs and somewhere between a tall and normal barrel...modern rkp tall bushing trucks like the Savants, Arsenals, Ronins,, Roques and others are the best turning trucks I have used when it comes to bushings, you cannot argue with more lean and bushing in your trucks, you cannot have enough of a good thing, the fatcone comes into play perfectly here, and when you have more room for a bushing and add a fat cone, you can use a much softer bushing that has the same stability as a smaller one, and lean further with more stability..There's also a lot of people using the bushing seat bushings now, many people who used a spherical bearing on the kingpin are now opting for a tuned bushing in it's place and the downhill guys are going crazy over Roques for this reason, they are a cheap way to experience a tall bushing and insert..it gives you more to tune, but makes up for the lack of queenpin and helps keep the truck centered and from shifting..I love all this new technology, it's a great time to be a skater, I hope people can start to understand it all and see what I am talking about.  Without tuning to your weight and preference these advantages are lost. I recommend just dumping a 100 bucks on bushing and forming a little kit like I did, that way I have a box with all the options I might ever need for any skateboard build..

Thanks @Colson003 

You are battling is a couple of things regarding your poor turning radius, first you are using a drop through deck and second your trucks are wider than your deck.  Both of those features are killing the leverage you can exert over you trucks.  You could achieve a much tighter turning radius by simply top mounting your trucks in place of dropping them through the deck.  If that is not an option, go with a RipTide KranK 87a StreetCone / Canon front and a StreetBarrel / Canon rear with cupped washers all around.  Due to the relatively short king pin of the Torqueboards 218mm 50 degree trucks, running the Street sized bushing on top which are .5" tall and the regular longboard bushings on the bottom which are .6" tall, allows you to use washers in all 4 positions and therefore greater tunability

Hi @Alphamail,
I'm building a new board. It's going to be a Landyachtz Evo deck.
I have a set of TB trucks to accommodate the two 6374 motors but was also considering the surf rods from psychotiller.
I'm 6ft 6 and 200lbs, reasonable eboard experience and loads of push longboard experience. (no "real" downhill experience) Snowboarder and surfer for years.
I wondered if you have experience of these decks and could point me in the right direction. I'm imagining 1/2" risers as the enclosure is 25mm.
Looking for stability..

Hey @bigben, the Evo is a legendary DH deck so it should be quite stable out of the gate since the front is wedged and the rear is already de-wedged 15 degrees.  Regarding truck choice you may want to review what is said regarding what the deck was designed for before you build:  http://reviewlongboards.com/landyachtz-evo-review/

@Namasaki certainly, years ago when we starting toying with pivots me made a wide range of pivot duros and sent them to our team riders to test.  The results were consistent in that the preferred duro was 96a.  That duro struck a fine balance between control and suppleness.  At the request of one of our largest retailers, we began ,making 90a, 95a and 100a due to market pressure.  Who are we to tell people what they need!  I have tried them all and keep coming back to the 96a WFB for the feel of it.  It is likely a option of personal preference and for a lighter weight rider the 90a may make sense but for my 197  lbs, the 96a is perfect

@Alphamail Thanks for staring this thread. I recently got my hands on a small assortment of WFB, APS & Krank bushings and I'm eager to learn and experiment with them. 

Does the width of the hanger, e.g., TB 218 (305mm width) trucks affect the optimal duro of the pivot cups to use? Would 100a be better for these? Correct me if I'm wrong, but due to the increased leverage of wider hangers, it seems like we need to use higher duro bushings to get the same "feel" that we would get on narrower hangers. Would that hold true for the pivot cups too, or am I off base on all of this?
```

## \#33 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2017-12-31T00:29:06.906Z Reads: 435

```
@Mobutusan, The bushing duro will have a much greater influence over the trucks than the pivot duro.  Wider hangers do allow you to put greater force on the trucks since the pressure you are exerting on the edge of the deck is  translated into hanger angulation in place of the wheel lift you could get with a narrow hanger.  I personally do not think pivot duro is influenced by hanger width but I have never devised a test protocol to determine the effect.

@briman05 at 52 degrees, Bear 852's are already extremely turny.  Try this, if you are using cupped washers, switch to flats at least in the front to see if that improves your turning radius.  If that doesn't work, you might want to go down in duro or bushing shape.  What is your weight?

Ok, it is a common misconception that flipping the hanger changes the angle...it does not.  It is still a 52 degree truck but now it has negative rake instead of positive rake.  Try running flat washers on the front to see if that gives you what you want

Replacing the pivot cups, provides a smoother feel, there's no stiction (the friction that tends to prevent stationary surfaces from being set in motion.) or unevenness in the feel if you have a new and consistent pivot cup, they do like to get chewed up and some don't work well, the aftermarket ones are designed to fit perfectly, which is important. Most American made trucks have a good enough pivot cup and I only replace them to upgrade or when they wear out. I have yet to see a Chinese truck with one that is even acceptable for me..I would always replace the cup if I was forced into using a cheap trucks.

I recently just installed the Indy pivot cups and have yet to ride them, here's a 109mm T hanger Indy spinning Seismic Focus wheels, upgraded with Riptide's pivot cup, and a nice Riptide barrel under a Bone medium short cone, I made this for a Freestyle setup which I want to turn, pump and roll, things typically you wish to stop on a Freestyle, but I'm going to try and tune and control it. I have a custom 80's style deck coming from Deckcrafters for this setup..it should be a pleasure to ride..

Hello all, I am a little confused by a couple of posts regarding Torqueboard 50 degree V2 trucks and Caliber II hybrids (matching Torqueboard hanger with a Caliber II base plate or a Torqueboard base plate with a Caliber II hanger)!  

The pivot cup that fits the full Torqueboard 50 degree V2 trucks is our Indy 96a WFB pivot. It is dimensionally very close to the stock pivot and goes into the base plate a little easier than we like to see but it is tighter on the hanger pivot nose so it does make for a functionally good tight fit when assembled.  

When hybridizing the truck using a Torqueboard hanger with a Caliber II base plate or a Torqueboard base plate with a Caliber II hanger, all bets should be off regarding using the Indy pivot since the because the Caliber II base plate has a .700" hole in the base plate and the Torqueboard base plate has a hole diameter of .625".  Conversely the hanger nose of the Torqueboard hanger is .434" and the Caliber II hanger pivot nose is .500" so the combinations should be incompatible.  What am I missing?

I measured the pivot nose on the TB 218 truck hanger that I have, it is .505.
It fits very snug in my Caliber II baseplate with WFB Caliber II pivot cup.

I did put a set of Caliber II hangers and TB base plates with stock pivot cups together to utilize spare parts for a budget project.
Will update on the quality of the fit as soon as possible.

I just measured two brand new @Torqueboards 218mm trucks I got on Black Friday, and found that the pivot nose on both hangers is slightly oval. I measured .495" and .508" widths on one hanger, and .493-.498" and .503-.508" on the other, depending on what part of the nose I measured. I wonder if the design has changed slightly or you got an earlier version of the truck out of a different factory?

You know, I'm not really sure. Maybe Dexter @Torqueboards can help explain. I don't recognize the baseplate in this pic from your other thread, but since he sent these to you as the DIY/Torqueboards 50° v.2 trucks, they must be the newest version, but a different design. The main thing I notice on these, is that the pivot cup is extended outwards on the baseplate, which is different from the trucks I have.

This is what my TB 50° v.2 trucks (blue) look like, although I got them almost two years ago. They look dimensionally very similar to a genuine Caliber 2, despite some small design differences. They do have a circular pivot nose though, measured at .475". They are next to a TB 218 truck, for reference, which are the TB trucks most of are interested these days, if I'm not mistaken.

I haven't received my parts yet so I haven't been able to test and tell you what exactly it is, I want to change. Since all the pros here are raving about RipTide rubber and they are kinda hard to come by here in GER, I would like to just order some bushings and pivot cups and see how it turns out. I know similar setups have been commented on before, I just want to make sure I got everything more or less right.

1) TB 218mm (is the upgrade to original Caliber II Baseplates worth it?)

2) stock bushings

3) I want what almost all the riders here want - a smooth carve at slow speed and a stable ride at high speed. I know having both is difficult so I am definitely putting more emphasis on the stable ride and avoiding the much-dreaded speed wobble.

4) Type of skating: Electric commuting and pushing my speed limits without going to the mountains

5) Deck: Never Summer 2013 Status. It is rather stiff for a longboard but it has some flex. Will have to cut some wood away and/or add a riser against wheelbite because I'm getting 107mm abecs

6) Rider weight: 82kg

So using the info I got from this thread I am thinking of getting the following:

* A pair of caliber II 50° trucks to use the baseplates           https://goo.gl/cVFo5i
* WFB 96a Caliber II Pivot Cups
* 2x Krank Barrels 93a          http://www.riptidesports.com/krank-barrel-duro-choices/

Comments and suggestions?

Asides from pivot cups and bushings, would it be a good idea to stick TB 218 hangers on Caliber II 44° degree baseplates in order to make it more stable? Does anyone know if that fits?

@koralle do you have a set of calipers that you can measure the pivot cup in the TB 218mm trucks currently?  Using calipers to the .1mm or .01mm should be perfect.  I need the Outside diameter, Inside diameter, depth and overall length of the pivot cup that is in the trucks

Hey Dan, if the green RipTide Cone cone is 97.5a, it is extremely stiff.  First thing to try is replace the cupped washer on the cone with a flat washer or just flip it over.  With the amount of king pin threads showing, are you cranking it down really tight?  If so back it off a bit in addition to changing the washer set up.  If that doesn't get you where you want to be, try the Cone in the boardside position with a flat washer so it will deal better with your weight and deflect more than in the roadside position.

@GrecoMan it is interesting you are getting wheel lift with that set up.  First thing to try is changing out the washers from cupped to flat to see if it becomes more supple.  Under what conditions does wheel lift occur?  Right turn, left turn, both, and is it front, rear or both?

OK @GrecoMan tuning with flat washers (switching to flat washers in at least 2 of the 4 positions) should solve that.  Keep in mind that you will increase the range your trucks are able to travel heelside so be cautious of wheel bite.

Hey @Alphamail, thanks for taking the time out of your day to help us out!

I've been riding riptides for a while, and I'd like to hear what you think of my setup.

SurfRodz TKP's

Running WFB 95.5 barrels boardside and 95.5 tall barrels streetside. 

As a fat guy - 280ish - I really need to crank down the kingpin to keep the trucks from getting too lively.  I know a chubby won't fit boardside, and I'm unsure of a fatcone.  Should I consider Kranks?

Also, the 96a pivot cups -   I don't see a sizing for SurfRodz, have a recommendation?

Thanks in advance!

The trucks are wedged front n rear ie the trucks have the thick part of the wedges facing each other   My loaded vanguard is electric and has riptide red barrels  boardside and green cones roadside. Way to stiff.  I’d like to soften them up. Which bushings can I buy?

Thanks @akhlut WFB does not respond much to clamping pressure so you would be much better off with our KranK compound in 96a.  For SZ trucks, you can use all of our longboard shapes except the Chubby.  The FatCone was invented for use in SZ trucks as a matter of fact!   As for the 96a Pivot cups, they are listed as "Randal, Randal RIII, SurfRodz RPK"

Streetside.

The standard kingpin on the surfrodz TKP's is a little too long and is a tight fit with a standard barrel.  The TallBarrel is a perfect fit though, with enough room to vary the pressure on the bushing.

I might get a new kingpin that's a little shorter one of these days.

When you find the kingpin you are going to use let me know, I am interested as well.  Keep in mind the nut that the kingpin screws into is non-standard, meaning its shape is not symmetrical.  It has a long flat edge on each side to fit in the baseplate.

Coming back to the Torqueboards 218mm trucks:

My trucks came earlier than expected, so I was able to measure them myself. Hope everything is self-explanatory.

Question to @scepterr and @Namasaki : Do you use the original Caliber II baseplates just in order to be able to fit other pivot cups or is there any other upside?

Yes, because at the time I set it up, I did not know that the Indy pivot cups would fit the TB base plates.
There is however another advantage to switching because you can use Caliber II 44 deg base plates to increase stability at high speed.
Then again, the 50 deg base plates will give you sharper turning and they are stable enough up to 20 mph.

Yes thats right. I remeasured the second pivot cup and turns out they are different by .15 in some places so not high accuracy but I guess parts like these never are.

The inside bottom of the stock pivot cup is conical, not with a round radius but otherwise your sketch is correct!

@mmaner I would have to say that you choice may help but I think there are better choices.  With the LY EVO, the deck is already wedged and de-wewedged by something close to 15 degrees each.  Take into consideration the SZ TKP's are already squirrely handling trucks to start with without wedging.  Tall bushings deform more than the same duro regular height bushings so I would not recommend talls in SZ TKP's

Can you provide more details about the set up?  I suspect the rear de-wedged is fairly neutral and the front turns a lot?  Is it currently set up with the same bushings front and back?  If so, the rear has a lot more leverage over the bushings than the front which can lead to a very unstable set up.

I have 1/2in hard risers on the deck, thats just for motor clearance.  I could probably get rid of them and replace with some 4mm or 8mm rubber risers, if you think it would help, after adjusting the motor plate angle, I just prefer it this way for piece of mind.

Mostly I have issues while carving over 20mph, which is not something I do often.  The front trucks tend to wobble a bit but I usually just accelerate out of it and the slow back down.

Here's the build log...  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dropped-airless-glorrrrrrryyyyyyyy-dual-208kv-dual-focbox-10s4p-30q-ly-evo-airless-6in-wheels-on-6-shooters/36578

The only major change from the initial build is that I am now using 6374 190kv motors and 25mm motor and wheel  pulleys with 25mm belts.  These changes have not noticeably affected the wobble, just lots more torque and lets me run my belts looser.  I am using the stock bushings and pivot cups.

Other than that, the only thing I can think of that is pertinent is that I tend to steer from the rear more than I should, just habit.  Thanks for the advice and taking the time to do this thread, mondo cool of you.

@mmaner, steering from the rear is also destabilizing on most set ups.  The biggest issue, from what you have said is you are running the same bushings front and rear.  This is problematic because of the differential leverage you have over the bushings so the rear is easier to turn than the front which is the opposite of how it should be tuned.  I suggest as a first step de-wedging the front at least 10 degrees and running a Barrel / Chubby combination in the rear.  This should shift the bias to the front, allowing the front to turn easier than the rear.  Give me the rundown on the shapes you are using in both trucks currently as i have seen them with both a Cone / Barrel or Barrel / Barrel set up.  Let me know your weight also so I can give you a full recommendation.  You also may want to consider a different truck up front as SZ TKP's are not known for going fast.

Brad it's great having your pu knowledge here.

I how can I get the squeaks out of all my connections in my bushings and the cup?  drives me nuts.  ive used soap and also oil and they work just ok and I have to repeat it. 

also, I think I asked before but now I forget, is there a more durable pivot cup because with the motors the extra forces beat them up really quickly and my pointy bit ends up loose in the cup.

@Alphamail 

Reporting back!

Got the new bushings a while ago, but jersey has had crap weather for a while now.  Got the 96a krank fatcones boardside, the 96a krank tall barrels streetside and the new 96a wfb pivot cups installed.  

Installation was easy of course, but the pivot cups were tight, like really tight.  So tight in fact that i had trouble getting the truck pivot into the cup!  It all went together eventually though.  Might want to check the geometry.  I can measure stock cups if you'd like.

First impressions: much better!  Very smooth, almost buttery.  Tightened the kingpin midway through the ride and really makes a huge difference for a chubs like me.  I need to go for a daylight ride to see how stable they are at higher speeds.  

And its going to snow tomorrow.  Naturally.  :frowning: 

Thanks again!

Hey @Alphamail, thank you so much for taking the time to give us all informed recommendations, and I appreciate the help greatly!

 I am running Caliber 50degree baseplates with torqueboards 218mm hangers. They're sitting on **1 inch risers**, so I assume there is some added leverage that will affect what bushings set up I should choose. As of now, the pivot cup is the stock caliber, and the bushings are the stock torqueboards (which felt stiffer than the stock Calibers in hand, but I am not sure to what the exact duro is).

As of now, I haven't finished my Eboard, so I have only ridden manually. However, I do assume that I will begin to wobble and loose some stability at higher speeds, (my board should travel at 30-35mph at the very top end), so I would like to be as stable as possible at those speeds. From my testing so far, the setup with the torqueboard's bushings has felt mushy, and I would like a little higher rebound. I'd also like to have a decent turning radius, especially with the wide hangers.  I don't know if I am asking for an impossible set up, but any recommendation is appreciated :joy:

I am going to use this board mostly for commuting to work as well as some fun carving. I'd like to retain as much of a surfy feel as possible while still being stable at speeds. 

The deck I am running is a Loaded Tan Tien flex 2, and I weigh 145 lbs. 

Thanks once again! 
 -Ben

I have to use them. With my current battery set up (2x 5000mah 5s lipos, pretty chunky with BMS mounted on top) and the flex of the deck, I need them for clearance of the enclosure. Definitely not ideal, but it's the only thing I can do before I upgrade to a slimmer 18650 pack. If only I had unlimited funds. And in all honesty it isnt that bad. Almost like riding on Sidewinders height-wise.

Thank you, here are a couple of general thoughts.  Symmetrical 50 degree base plates are designed for maneuverability, not speed so you need to de-wedge the rear truck using an angled riser at least 10 degrees, 15 or 20 would be better but mounting the truck becomes difficult since the mounting hole spacing is diminishing as you wedge or de-wedge it.  You can also pick up a Caliber 44 degree base plate and add you 10 degree de-wedge will net you a net split of 50 / 34 degree for a more stable set up.  Since you are already using risers, there should be adequate room to do this.  Now that you have a split set up, you need to compensate for the higher leverage that the 34 degree rear truck exerts on the bushings.  My favorite and way of doing this is to run all the same duro and use different shapes in different places.  I weigh about 200 lbs so I would run a Barrel / Barrel front with possible a flat washer / a cupped washer, for the rear I would run a Barrel / Chubby or FatCone with a cupped washer / the Chubby flat washer.  As far as i know the TB 218 will take the Chubby boardside but I will know for sure soon!.

They seem too tall. I knock them in with a rubber faced hammer as far as they will go, Then put all my weight on the hanger to get it over the kingpin, But it just doesn't align, I can't get the bushings (bones hardcore tall barrels) to seat on the hanger. I need the pivot to seat further in to the base plate, but it can't cause the pivot tube protrudes too far from the base plate. I did a google and searched the web plus asked here...

Hello @Alphamail 

I just got my Raptor 2 and I want it to have more turning capability, I tried to loose the kingpin nut but all I got was rattling between the nut and washer, almost no increase in turning.

What RipTide bushings do you suggest for these trucks?

OK, the "bite test" is a fairly reliable method for determining relative durometer.  Wipe off or clean a bushing of known durometer and give it a light bite with your front teeth, then test the unknwn bushing, you should be able to quickly tell if the unknown bushing is harder, softer or the same.

So, I have a pretty unconventional build. Recently my board/me got hit by a car so I'm ordering an Original Apex Diamond Drop 37". So it's a drop deck and I was thinking about using the drop through but upon reading through this thread, looks like it doesn't really help with control. So, I have 150mm 30mm wide off-roadish inline skate wheels. I'm planning on keeping the caliber truck on the back which has purple nipples in it and I shaved off enough axle to fit the wheels on 48° atlas Ultralight 8mm core trucks.

If that's not recommended I can switch so they match. I'm about 125 lbs. I'm used to small boards, like regular skateboards and penny boards so turning on a longboard is tough for me. So I need easier turning (I have a kick tail, still getting used to the distance) but also more stability when hitting between 18-20mph. I commute in the city with huge potholes and idiot drivers.

concerning pivor cups:

[quote="Alphamail, post:31, topic:42036"]
certainly, years ago when we starting toying with pivots me made a wide range of pivot duros and sent them to our team riders to test.  The results were consistent in that the preferred duro was 96a.  That duro struck a fine balance between control and suppleness.  At the request of one of our largest retailers, we began ,making 90a, 95a and 100a due to market pressure.  Who are we to tell people what they need!  I have tried them all and keep coming back to the 96a WFB for the feel of it.  It is likely a option of personal preference and for a lighter weight rider the 90a may make sense but for my 197  lbs, the 96a is perfect

The most common reason for wheel lift is the bushings are too stiff for the base plate angle and the ratio between the width of the hangers and the width of the board.  On the same width deck, narrow hangers will wheel lift easier than wide hangers.  Higher angle trucks (greater than 45 degrees) require softer bushings because as the angle of the truck increase, the leverage over the bushings decrease.  As an example, in 45 degree trucks, I would normally run a KranK 90a, in a 55 degree truck, I run a KranK 84a

Bushings can be measured with a ruler because the height measurement is not a critical.  Pivots need to be measured to the .001" or .01mm.  Our bushings run just over the following the following heights:
ShortStreet:  4"
Street:  .5"
Longboard:  .6"
Tall:  .75"

 Got flat precision washer boardside and cupped streetside with that set up. Running it as loose as possible. Gotta admit, you almost need the same amount of weight for each degree of lean.

@Alphamail sorry to bother you again sir.

Please don't forget to recommend the correct set of bushings for my Raptor 2.

BTW today I tested [these Venom SHR 91a](https://www.amazon.com/Venom-Double-Barrel-Bushings-Trucks/dp/B01CKUMMEY/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1517113443&sr=8-3-fkmr0&keywords=Venom+SHR+Double+Barrel+Longboard+Skateboard+Bushings+Pack+%28Choose%3A+Blood+Red+%2891a%29+%2B+Washers%29) bushings for Ronin trucks I had laying around, the size matched the stock bushings that came into the Raptor 2, so I decided to give them a try.

[img]https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61I3q2lwlcL._SL1200_.jpg[/img]

Unfortunately, the result was pretty much the same as the stock Raptor 2 ones, I need something more flexible that returns to the center position quicker, I'm trying to ride with the trucks as loose as possible but the washers rattle against the king pin nut on every small crack in the road, so I know they are too lose, the worst thing is not even that makes the trucks turn more.

Would you suggest [these Krank 87a bushings](https://www.amazon.com/RipTide-Sports-Krank-Barrel-Bushings/dp/B07412BDV3/ref=sr_1_4?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1517113929&sr=1-4&keywords=krank+bushings)

Thanks for doing this @Alphamail 

I would like some new life to my Evolve Bamboo Board. Currently I run everything stock Evolve (double kingping trucks) with a couple of mm kingping showing and their AT pneumatics. 

I find the current turning dull meaning that it has the same “slow” feel from start to end of the turning. I would like some more responsiveness. I would like some resistance in the beginning of my lean, and then a smooth squeasy feel when the bushing starts to give. And I would like to get thrown back in to neutral getting out of the carve. Is that what you call rebound? 

With this I hope to get some more stability when I am heading straight a head. So I can move my feet around with out to much wobble, and then a smooth firm feeling when the initial resistance is broken. And then the thrown back in feeling :) Does this make sense? 

I mainly cruise around between 12 - 18 mph. 

I weigh 165lb

Need more info?

OK the basic approach to stabilization of compound truck set ups is to progressively tune the bushings going from the loosest to the stiffest - roadside front, boardside front, roadside rear, boardside rear. The KranK compound works great for this because it has high adjustability based on thee clamping pressure of the king pin nut. What duro Evolve bushings are you using, Peach 90a, Green 92a or Orange 95a?

Thanks @Eboosted, those are very deep seats, normally you will see something around 2.5mm in a precision truck to take advantage of shapes such as TallChubbys.  With such a restrictive seat, I would suggest going to a TallCone /TallBarrrel combination in the front and a TallBarrel / TallBarrel rear in either APS 87.5 or KranK 87a.  So lower duro than stock and a easier to turn combination up front.  If you want it even looser, run APS 85a or KranK 84a

Thanks. Does that mean that I should use clamping to adjust? I got the impression that I should find the right duro and compound of the bushing and then have that determine how the feel is, without extra clamping. 
I believe the stock bushings are the orange ones 95A.

**_The recommendation below needs to be revised due to some possibly incorrect information I found on the Evolve website regarding bushing heights.  Once this is confirmed, I will post a corrected recommendation._**

I would use a combination of duro, shape, washers and . force to accomplish this.  Since you are looking for rebound, I suggest our KranK compound, all in 93a.  For the front StreetCone (Cup) / Barrel (Flat) over StreetBarrel (flat) / Barrel (cupped) and the rear I would run StreetBarrel (flat) / Barrel (cupped) over StreetBarrel (flat) / Barrel (cupped).  The suggested washers are listed as a starting point and will allow the front to be a bit easier to turn than the rear.  Always be conscious of potential wheel bite anytime you change or adjust bushings.  Even though we are going down in duro, we are going up in shape and rebound.

Thanks for doing this!!

The oem red bushings in my caliber 44° trucks are nice and soft..perfect for a 9 year old..

I've since swapped the rear to black regular barrels. Khiro..
It's dewedged 6° (Sector 9 wedge riser) and additional 1/8" riser...at 38° now.
Using cups on road/boardside.

Front has unknown duro yellow barrels, also cups on both sides.. straight spacer @1/2"

Issues:
I'm still getting a little wheel lift, caused by the cup washers grounding out on the hangars..

Bushings are tightened 1-1/2 full turns.

Tall barrels will fix it I'm sure.
I'm 205#
Abec 11's 97mm 
Bustin YoFace double kick deck, with the wheel cutouts dug out a bit more via belt sander...

What tall barrels do you recommend?

I have never run Talls in Caliber Trucks, do you have the king pin length necessary?  If you are suffering from cupped washer bite and you have tightened the kp nut 1.5 turns you are nearly at kp lock.  Sounds like you are using too soft of a bushing or you need to boost up to a Chubby shape at least boardside.

Yes, there is plenty of room..

Just to check, I put two cupped washers boardside, and a cupped + flat washer roadside..still had a few threads showing @ only 1-1/2 turns from loose..

loose:   i.e. can just turn bushings by hand

It is better with the harder black barrels at rear and yellow barrels in front, 2 turns from loose.

But again..still getting hanger contact in deep lean..

At just 1 turn tight, I can see it (washer) hitting the hangar when I push on the truck.
(Upside down on the bench)

Flat washers all around solves the contact issue, but   allows some wheel bite.

@Alphamail thanks for doing this I've learned alot by reading through these. I would like to get some quick feedback on my setup. 

I'm running an landyachtz evo/ TB 218mm trucks/ boltzen 12 degree wedges so I'm essentially at a 53/47 split. I'm around the 195-200lb range for my weight. 

Right now I have blood orange 89a/89a rear and 86a/89a front with flat washers. I realize this is way too soft for my weight as i had to crank down the kingpin nut to the point of bushing deformation. 

I would like a bit more stability in the 30+ department so I need to go higher duro most likely. I'm wondering if going with the softer RS bushing up front will essentially do the same thing more or less than all the same duro but running a fat cone on the rear BS to keep the steering bias balanced due to the split setup. 

Let me know what you would suggest. I'd really appreciate it man!

Interesting way to work with the wedging.  I am OK with what you did with the front but the rear I would just use a flat riser to end up with a 35 degree rear giving you a 18 degree split (53/35).  We weigh about the same so let me know if you are OK with rearranging rear to 35 degrees and I will have some ideas.  I just received a pair of the TB 218mm trucks and I want tomorrow to test out our different shapes before I suggest!

I’m up for trying it. I’ll just not be able to run quite as much motor cleanace in the back. The wedge allows the motors to be tucked up higher as it moves them away from the drop. Hard to visualize unless you are looking at it and see what the angled wedge does to the final motor position in the rear. 

It would be much easier to remove the wedge from the front truck. Which would give me a 65/ 47 split instead of a 53/35 split.

Would that essentially be the exact same handling more or less since the split differential is the same amount from to back?

2. Don't have info on duro. But bushing seat size is different from road side to board side. Road side accommodates regular barrel bushing(25mm) but board side is shorter and has a short cone with 24mm width.
3. They are a little unstable over 25km/h. I would like them more stable.
4. Cruising
5. Loaded Dervish drop through setup. I have 90mm wheels and no wheel bite.
6. 76kg

Bushings are fairly low maintenance items but I would check them when you clean your board or every couple of months if they feel good, or immediately if they start to feel different than you remember.  Inspect them for cuts or cracks and replace them if you find either.  Cuts and cracks can propagate into a split bushing which can be catastrophic.  Also replace them if they are also severely compressed!  Inspect you king pin also for wear, cracks or bending and replace if any of those are found.

OK, I just watched their set up video...very complex.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oSomITT_9U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oSomITT_9U)

If you have the ability to modify bushings to fit boardside, you will have far more options available to you.  Otherwise you will tied to replacements from Brakeboard or just be satisfied with changing the roadside bushing which unfortunately influences the set up less than the boardside bushing.  A Dervish is a very flexy board and it may be contributing to the stability issues you are having.  Can you describe what is happening over 25km/h?

@torqueboards was kind enough to send me a pair of the TB 218 trucks and here is what I found:![53|690x388](upload://8FFsrBHgmNwGBAzJ6CYm7apEydx.jpg) 

The RipTide Caliber II pivot is a perfect fit.  As for bushings, there are some surprises.  The best fits are Cones, Canons, FatCones and Magnums.  Our Barrels fit, but the Canons fit better and our Chubby does not fit well.  That being said, here is a rundown on the most common options for a symmetrical set up (same angle front and rear)

With the durometer remaining constant the relative feel follows:

Cone / Cone: Extremely carvey set up, generally used for low speed pedestrian slalom, campus crusing
Cone / Canon: Playful carving set up, good for commuting where tight turns are occasionally needed. Low to medium speeds
Canon / Canon: Versatile set up for medium to high speeds, can be run loose for tight turns and tighter for high speeds. Response is very linear
Canon / FatCone: Similar to the Canon / Canon but the response is progressive. Resistance ramps up progressively the further you go.
Canon / Magnum: Extremely stable set up, meant for very high speeds or a heavier rider with a wide board
```

Shit, now I need to try out some cannons..damn Brad, great run-down...

I ran some bushings through the 218mm torque to try and tune them for my fat 200lb old manatee like body. I can really leverage that long hanger. After a lot of trial and error I landed on Barrel/Fatcone combo, 93a Kranks on all 4. I didn't have cannons to test.

I wanted to feel lots of rebound and a balance between stability and liveliness to begin this setup. the fatcones help tame the added leverage of the long hanger, it's non linear feel and progressiveness lends well here. I did try the chubby, but like you said, it didn't work well at all except for constricting the hanger movement.

I need to stick some cannons in there and get rid of the deadspot, but barrels seemed to work in combo with the fatcones just fine. It's what I had around already.

Remember that the longer the hanger, the higher your duro may need go in order retain the same feel you have on a narrower truck. Riptides harder duros are still plush, you just have to be a fat man to appreciate them and make them work..

So, I now am using the original skateboards diamond drop 37" deck with the same caliber trucks and purple nipples. From my little test ride around the block, I loved it. I actually put a fairly soft riser under the back truck to make the motor fit better. The bushings squeak but it feels really nice so far. I'm about 125-130lbs so I'm not sure if I need softer ones but so far so good. I tightened the back truck more with advice from the forum. I wouldn't mind getting the perfect bushings for me though lol. I think the concave and drop is what's really making me love the ride though.![IMG_20180203_183342_483|406x500](upload://ynMEpwf4sBvHwmhDAwLf1IujKs.jpg)

@rpasichnyk The HK trucks take the standard Riptide barrels just fine, they don't have a restrictive or shaped bushing seat so it makes it a little simpler. For smooth easy turning while still remaining stable I'm going to guess at a Riptide WFB 85a bs barrel...and either a 87a or 84a Krankz barrel on the rs for easy adjustment..you may want to start with a flat washer rs and if it's too much turn and makes it unstable, use a cupped washer to tame the squishy riptide bushings.. @Alphamail may have more input, those trucks are a pretty good copy of a modern precision rkp truck..the pivot is what I'm curious about replacing..maybe I'll send a set of these to Brad to measure and play with..they have potential but I just haven't put many miles on them to speak confidently about their durability. I looked at the bushing seat area in the hanger and my fat mantee like body and decided on the Avenue trucks.. for you they might just be perfect with the right tune..they are not bad for the $30 price point and I think some parts are even forged, which typically costs twice as much...

Dan sends out RipTide!   Blue is APS 85a and yellow is APS 90a.  Bushing selection is very personal for these so you need to tell me what you you want them to do after riding them for a bit.  Depending on my use, I often run 60a up front on a LDP / Pump set up and 90'a in the rear and I weigh just about 200.

It is hard to fit this. If I change the Barrel with a streetBarrel it is easier. I guess that would be alright? I have to clamp it a good deal to get the whole nut to grab properly. With the StreetBarrel / Barrel I can't get the nut to grab. With there Cone / Barrel I can get the nut to grab, again I have to clamp it a good deal loosing some of the setting variation. I will take it for a spin and see how it feels.

Let me check a few things, to get more space for now, just pull all the boardside flat washers to get some more space.  The stack up of the stock bushings should be 16.5mm +12mm= 28.5mm and our longboard barrel plus the StreetBarrel or cone  is 15.4mm + 12.7mm = 28.1mm.  If you bought them from us, it will be easy to change out.  As far as I can tell, the the spec on their website for their bushings is incorrect and we might want to switch to Street / Street combinations or ShortStreet / Street combinations.  This is a quote from their website:  "Four 16.5mm Barrels, Four 12mm cones".  The Evolve cone in the picture looks more like 10mm to me.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Let me know what you would like to do!

mmm..... seems that it would not be impossible to make it work. If I change the Barrel with the streetBarrel it would be no prob. But The difference to the Barrel / streetBarrel should not be an issue I guess. The diameter of the riptide is slightly bigger. Especially the cone have a bigger base, which make the fit less perfect. The hangers a slightly cone. The stock bushings fit perfectly but not the riptide they fit almost perfectly, but maybe thats also what contribute to my issue. But I guess when they are first tighten in it would be no issue. I have time tomorrow to play again and take it for a spin. I will be back.

@Bensaida and @Cobber   Flush to the top of the kingpin is only relevant if you are using stock and the parts are actually to spec.  Every bushing brand is a different height and washers have different thickness spec as do kingpin nut heights.  That being said, my starting point for all trucks other than Ronin is to tighten to the point where it is difficult to turn the bushing in the roadside seat by hand then the range of adjustability for KranK and APS is 2 turns, for WFB, i would say 1 turn.  For Ronin, the starting point is when the support pin just starts to move down.  If you need to use the full two turns you likely need a harder duro or a larger bushing shape.

OK for the HK trucks, here is what I found and suggest.

Nicely made with some interesting design features that may help (reinforcing rib boardside) and may hurt (gapped bushing seat wall).  I found the Stock bushings to be around 94a and severely undersized in diameter for both the cone and the barrel (.915" nom) and undersized in height for the Cone (.428").  The stock king pin diameter is .362" and the king pin hole is drilled .387".  When you take all those things together you have a lot of potential slop where the truck does not turn when you go off center.  It takes several degrees of angulation for the bushings and king pin to go to the end of their tolerance and start the truck turning.  This causes a very uncertain center, like the steering of a 1955 Chevy.
  
Picture shows the available space for bushing shift in the stock set up:

![45|690x388](upload://qLUfjUlEuns9vGsWJj1eFzlBRg0.jpg)

Compared to the upgraded set up:  

![26|690x388](upload://saMcMv9yXuXrF5mllK2ylqKguU4.jpg)

Possible upgrades include RipTide bushings and pivot cups.  The HK trucks fit our standard longboard Cones, Barrels, Canons and FatCones (boardside only) and our Indy Pivot cups fit perfectly.  I also suggest replacing the stock king pin with a AN6-26A aircraft bolt, the bolt alone takes .010" slop out of the set up.  It can be purchased at most aircraft supply stores:  [http://aircraftproducts.wicksaircraft.com/item/aircraft-bolts/bolt-an6-3-8-24-/an6-26a](http://aircraftproducts.wicksaircraft.com/item/aircraft-bolts/bolt-an6-3-8-24-/an6-26a)

well I love it. Used it for most events/races.
Concave is almost perfect, put a W implant at the back. It is a big deck, ans has a lot of curves. Don't think it suits esk8 much. Also its somewhat overkill for a esk8 in my opinion. Its a sick sports utility tool for sure. I put a foot stopper as I usually do and with the shape it has feel super responsive.

Go for some cast rogues (cheap), bear kodiaks (medium), or some Ronin prec. (expensive) and you have a setup that you will never outclass.

as for the kingpin...

https://calibertruckco.com/product/ii-forty-four/

Manufacturer states the kingpin is pressed in & doesn't have replacement kingpins listed in the webshop.

You could heat the base plate with a hot air gun, maybe cool the kingpin with a can of butane and try to press it out with a drill press and a jig to hold the baseplate/kingpin vertical... lot of work?

I wouldn't apply too much force with a hammer, sometimes a clean in a ultrasonic bath can help (if you have one). I've had kingpins that wont budge. 15m in the ultrasonic bath and they fall out with a tap. But they are designed to be removed.

You dont want to mess up hanger on baseplate geometry by using tall barrels on trucks that arent designed for them.

Theres no benefit and the hanger wont sit flush on the boardside bushing.

Thanks. I'm replacing the stock Blood Orange bushings in the Calibers to the Riptide barrels. The boardside bushings are almost the same height. There's less than a mm difference in height and I'm comparing new bushings to old, slightly compressed bushings. Is this enough to make a difference in the angle of the hanger?

Do you mind giving me some advice Brad on a gravity deck?

I comute on this deck on wet days down the esplanade in to town. The trucks used to be on a symetrical double drop deck that softer bushings worked on.

**The set up**
Hi5ber limelite (36.5 x 10 inches), currently set up 26 and a bit inches truck bolt to truck bolt.
Aera k4 50/50 trucks running 6mm positive rake f/b (176mm wide).
Venom 1/8 risers.
Venom mach 1 magnum wheels (78x70mm wide).
I am 6 foot 2 & just over 100kg or 220 pounds.

Aera recomend Hardcore barrels, 4 x 93a barrels (firm as they come, I have tried all combinations of 90a & 93a) are too soft and the deck gets sketchy at speed over uneven ground. If I put all my weight on the deck edge and rock it on to two wheels the wheels catch the deck. Cupped washers just restricted the bushings without getting me what I wanted.

I changed out the board side bushings for 93a HPF venom eliminators with a flat washer to make up for their reduced height.
Front and back it took out all the turn (lean) and made the deck dead, heaps of wheel clearance now.
With a eliminator just in the rear (current set up f, bs/93a, rs/93a hardcore barrels, r, bs/93a venom eliminator/flat washer, rs/93a hardcore barrel) is best so far but not quite perfect. 

I'd like a fraction more turn (lean) out of the rear but to keep the stability the eliminator has added (I was thinking maybe a venom keg before I decided to take your advice).
In the front I'd like a tiny bit more wheel clearance and a tiny bit more resistance, maybe rebound, like I need to up the bs barrel duro (a flat washer didn't do it for me).

I also have some of your k4 pivot tubes that need to be modified to fit my trucks. The kingpin/hangar fit is quite tight on the k4's and I have noticed with the stock pivot tubes the kingpin is now contacting the hangar and a aluminium dust is collecting on the bushing seat (wasn't a problem on the double drop, maybe my weight and the extra leverage of the top mount?). As per our previous conversation to cut the pivot tubes flush, could I grip the pivot tube in a socket or similar to hold it true and sand it down till the bushings/hangar line up?

I currently have a old bushing as a foot stop, I tend to squirm around on the deck changing micro positions. Is this the footstop you would recomend me?

Sorry for the long post and the blow by blow...

Sure Brad, it will have to wait till I get home from work tonight, i'll dis-assemble the hangar to and get some shots of where the kingpin has made contact with the back of the bushing seat.

the pictures for you @Alphamail...
(tell me if you need more, I have not got the pivot tubes with me atm, I'm at work they are at home)

![DSC_6133|690x459](upload://Aa1TqJtBQR7p0Sf7GeKKGrZ1Sd4.JPG)
ignore the wax, at the back of the bushing seat you can see where the kingpin threads have grooved the hangar.
![DSC_6137|690x459](upload://qr5MLy55ywiezQ505QGD5JdwUjZ.JPG)
another angle...
![DSC_6138|690x459](upload://dV2cA0NHh53QXKT2P000wofcpfC.JPG)
& finally you can see how tight the bushing seat is around the kingpin
![DSC_6135|690x459](upload://8qdGfSNX2hYhdVZVutSLkom3B5B.JPG)
If you look to the pivot you will see a small gap between the hangar and the base plate. When I had two 93a hardcore bushings on the truck, I think the hangar was deflecting up in to the pivot. The eliminator seems to have stoped that on the rear truck though as there is no more new aluminium dust in the bushing seat although you could see the previous wear from the pictures.

The new pivot tubes I have are too long and you can not get the hangar bushing seat over the bushings. We did have a previous conversation about it and you gave KR a call and he told you that there were two different depth pivot tube seats over the manufacturing period.

So my suggestion was istead of cutting the pivot tube flush with the base plate to sand it down so I have enough pivot tub exsposed to fill the gap between the base plate and the hangar to stop the hangar from moving in to the pivot tube and catching on the king pin...

lastly this is where I bought my riptide pivot tubes

Certainly it is OK to sand down the pivot to where you want it.  Technically speaking if a truck is not using the bottom of a cup to provide thrust support to center the king pin in the hanger, the shoulder of the hanger at the pivot nose should be used for that purpose as you are describing.  From the Aera K-4's I have seen they rely only on the bushing seat and the bushings for that thrust support and not the shoulder of the pivot tube which is how it should be done,  The stock Vinyl tubes Aera used will not provide enough thrust support.  You are on the right track.

_Area notes:  K4.1 - K4.1 was originally made in Canada. It has double the rake of the K3. The bushing seat is deeper, and there is more distance between axle and bushing seat making it a touch taller. It has the old Aera Trucks logo. .96" seat - we brought out K4 plates with a large A engraved on top that were 25% lighter than K3 plates, but they were too weak and we discontinued them. They still gave 2-3 years of service for most people, and most of them are still out there today. The K4 hanger was 17% lighter than K3, so we did make some pretty big improvements. Stainless steel and titanium parts became available at this time._

_K4.2 - made in California, bushing seat opened to 1", same everything else as Canadian made._ 

Can you measure the diameter of your bushing seats?

![image|690x388](upload://mdBXGz3RWxYwY6eBzEy4IkemHCS.jpg)

Ok @Alphamail I got the calipers in to the bushing seat and took a handfull of measures between 25.34mm & 25.28mm with the hangar still mounted (but the rs bushing out). I would say I have the 1 inch bushing seat.

Looking forward to see what you recomend for me Brad, Doesn't matter if every bushing is different or the same what ever you think is best for me.

1.) TorqueBoards 218mm 50 degree trucks

2.) I currently have stock bushings, but my friend recently gave me a set of Orangatang Nipple 96a (barrels), and a set of Bear 90a (barrel/cone). I would love to know what I can do with those until I can buy new ones!

3.) Trucks feel super tight, kind of difficult to control due to massive turn radius. I want stability at 35mph speeds with reasonable turn radius. I'm pretty new to this, so I'm not familiar with what rebound means.

4.) Commuting as fast as i can :joy: top speed of 35mph

5.) Arbor Shakedown, I don't think it actually can wheel bite. I have 1/2" risers to accommodate the somewhat large wheels and enclosure. 

6.) 160lbs

I also want to know what I can do in terms of base plate angles, and why. Can I 3d print an angled riser, as a temporary fix until I get a different base plate? As well as pivot cups! Tell me what I can do about those!

Thanks in advanced!

35 mph is very fast for a commuter, I just hope you dress appropriately!  Since it feels super tight, I suggest changing out all the cupped washers and put in flat washers.  Try that to see where you are at then if it is too loose, progressively change back some of the positions with cupped washers.  Begin with the back Cone, then back Barrel, then front Cone...With this you are simulating a split set up so the front turns more than the rear.  You will need to experiment with the Nipples but run the shorter bushings in the set boardside.  For base plate angles, as the kingpin approached vertical, the truck turns less and has more leverage over the bushing so you will need harder or bigger bushings to compensate, conversely as the kingpin approached horizontal, the truck turns more and has less leverage over the bushing so you will need softer or smaller bushings to compensate.  Since you are starting out with 50 degree base plates I would just de-wedge the rear and leave the front at 50.  This will make the rear turn less and make the setup more stable.  Printing you own risers is fine as long as the material you use can withstand a lot of compression without failure!  Pivot cups are simple for the TB 218's, RipTide Caliber II pivots fit them perfectly!

I probably won't go that fast normally, but if i find a nice strait road, let 'er rip! I have full safety gear for sure, I It has already saved me once which is why I'm here :joy: Thank you for the fast reply! So what I am understanding is that I need to use flat washers, and I need to de-wedge the back trucks. De-wedging just means adding angled risers right? How much should I do that? I've seen a lot of people add 15 degrees,, do you have a better recommendation? Is there a good combination of nipples/bears I could use, or should I just stick to one? I was thinking nipples in the back, nipple boardside/bear (cone or barrel, need to experiment) in the front to simulate the looser in front thing. 

Thanks again! You are saving me a pretty expensive future trip to the hospital!

Start with the washer fix first to see if the stock bushings will work well for you.  Making the rear kingpin more vertical by 15 degrees will go a long ways.  A 50 / 35 split is nice.  As for the Bear and Nipples, I am not that familiar with how they respond so you will need to experiment.

Since you have the 1" diameter seat, the eliminator you have is likely the issue since it's diameter is a bit below 1" (.965" I think) thus allowing the hanger to come in contact with the king pin.  Best to use bushings closer to 1" diameter like the Canons using the sharp edge towards the hanger.

Hi,
i would like to have your advise.
I am a 200lb guy who is commuting with an esk8 on a daily basis. I am not a really experienced rider so my truck's are way too tight and my turning radius is shit. Additionally to my heavyweight i need to carry lunchbox, clothing to change and so on. I would like to keep the stability but if i lean in i would like to turn the board more as it is now.
My trucks are Paris style clones which are widely used on Meepo, Wowgo etc.
I will include a picture.![1519685802028-584834430|690x388](upload://yk3RmQ6C20ueB5InizFKvQLoYcY.jpg)![15196858556271877226560|281x500](upload://lG4SUkwdq4jwAkGAo5w3FJ9MsMT.jpg)

I am really looking forward to your advise and would like to thank you for doing this, great initiative!

[quote="Alphamail, post:236, topic:42036, full:true"]
Since you have the 1" diameter seat, the eliminator you have is likely the issue since it’s diameter is a bit below 1" (.965" I think) thus allowing the hanger to come in contact with the king pin.  Best to use bushings closer to 1" diameter like the Canons using the sharp edge towards the hanger.
[/quote]

ok, i'll have a think Brad, funny thing is:

[quote="Cobber, post:228, topic:42036"]
When I had two 93a hardcore bushings on the truck, I think the hangar was deflecting up in to the pivot. The eliminator seems to have stoped that on the rear truck though as there is no more new aluminium dust in the bushing seat
[/quote]

Slop aside I think the extra meat on the elim and the increase in duro 93-95a has enough beef to handle my weight and I have had no new wear on the hangar.

Thanks for the info on the trucks Brad, guess i'll keep playing.

not sure if youll be able to help me since i havent actually ridden the trucks yet but maybe you can throw me a suggestion. So I'm gonna be using TB218 trucks...reason i havent ridden them is because theyre at home while im at school...
anyways; ive ridden caliber ii 50  trucks for about a year on stock bushings( my only frame of reference since i havent tried the TB trucks) and always found that they had to be very tight for me to eliminate speed wobbles upwards of 30-35km/h, and when theyre that tight my turning radius is pretty bad, especially at slower speeds.  I ride a slightly flexible deck with a large wheelbase (dont know the measurement but the deck is 42" i think) with dual rear 260kv, so i like to go fast. I weigh 160-165lbs. 
suggestions are greatly appreciated

@abenny I go by this guide: https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/bushings/2696/venom-hpf-barrel-longboard-skateboard-bushings-pack

I have 3 different combinations and shapes of bushing for regular longboards and esk8 from Venom and they all work well. Another thing you could do is have a 44 Cal baseplate at the rear but might need riser or adjust mount angles.

If your turning radius is not where you want it the first thing to try is changing out some or all the cupped washers or at least flipping the roadside cupped washers.  That should give you some more freedom of motion and the same goes for the Caliber II's.  Making any change, please be sure to check for wheelbite.   As for the pivots, for the pictured pivot I need ID, OD depth and length to ne nearest .1mm to be even close to knowing what to recommend.  Pivots for the Caliber II's, RipTide makes those!

APS are a specific rebound based on the duro number, they are great centering and smooth when tuned to your weight, but harder to dial in and need to be under the perfect amount of preload using the kingpin to really come alive and function their best, they are great for looser trucks and pumping. Krankz are more forgiving, have a similar rebound and can be adjusted to a wider range through preload of the kingpin..making the tightness of the kingpin actually adjust the rebound a little giving you options. It's sort of like using a shotgun verses a sniper rifle..one is very forgiving and you don't have to aim well and the other will not work well at all if it's off...the WFB formula is squishier, has less rebound and is better for high speed control (downhill), they are also self lubricating..Every single application of a skate bushing is subjective..the formulas create options along with the sizes and shapes to dial in the perfect feel for your weight and what your doing and on which trucks (and how wide and how much leverage) and so on..there is infinite possibilities and options and tons of tribal knowledge rules...having someone like Alphamail here analyze and then apply all those rules at once to your setup is very educational..this thread is worth a million bucks for those who read through it and understand the value of open analysis..

Thanks for your reply!

Indeed wheelbite is an issue if i run my setup more loose then it is now. I am ordering different sizes of risers at the moment and want to replace the bushings anyway because i feel like the rebound is terrible on them. Reading through the thread i think Krank is the way to go for me. I am located in Japan, so there are not many retailers here and they stock Pivot cups only for Paris and Caliber trucks so i guess i just try them both and see what fits.
What duro and shape would you recommend to start out with?
Looking forward to your reply!
Cheers

http://www.xtreme.jp/ and www.funwaves.biz carry RipTide in Japan so you might want to start there.  Measuring the pivot cups accurately will definitely save you $ as there is no guarantee that either Paris, Caliber or Caliber II will fit in the trucks.  As for the bushings, our bushing are about 1.04cm (ShortStreet), 1.3cm (Street), 1.55 (Standard Longboard), and 1.93cm (Tall) so none of them are an exact height fit.  I would suggest running a Standard longboard bushing without a washer boardside and a Street height roadside in Krank 90a.  Keep the same shapes if you want it to be nimble (StreetCone / Barrel) or a StreetBarrel / Barrrel if you are looking for more stability

Hey @Alphamail, You're going to hate the abomination I'm about to print you in this post :smiley: 

So my set up is basically @scepterr's 

[quote="scepterr, post:28, topic:42036"]
I’m using TB 218mm hanger in caliber baseplate with RipTide WFB Caliber II 96a pivot cup
[/quote]

but here's the catch. The Fronts are 195mm Paris V2 Trucks and the back Trucks are have the ability to be also 195mm Paris trucks or 218mm Tourqueboard Trucks (the former for hubs and the latter for belt drive). 

*I know I know I should burn for this.* Most likely going to running risers up on the front to even it out when I use the 218mm since they're far taller and would just have to have the back 195mm run risers as well. Risky running trucks of two different heights and width, but I have to see if it'll work. 

What I'm shooting for I guess is stability at this point :joy: Anything that'll help at high speeds or even turning. 

I weight 145 pounds. 

 I'm going to be using this [deck](http://www.customskateboards.com/Blank-Laying-It-Down-Longboard):

Extreme is my supplier of choice, but i wasn't aware of the other one. That shop has all sizes of Pivot cups to choose from.
Now i got around measuring all bushings accurately and will attach the pictures.
First the barrel of the paris clones.

Do any of you guys have issues with the kingpin becoming sloppy really quickly in the @torqueboards 218mm baseplate? 

I removed the stock one and put one from muirskate in and it’s now doing the same thing. When I rock the trucks back and forth with my hand I see the hex end of the kingpin bolt shifting a few mm in either directions. 

All this talk about “I can’t even get my kingpin bolt out has never been an issue at all for me” sometimes it’ll just fall right out without any pressure. I probably only have 50 miles or less on these trucks. 

Any help?

Hey @Jc06505n, you are in luck, our Canons and Magnums work great in both those trucks and for your weight the KranK 84a or 87a should both work well.  The deck looks a bit narrow so the 84a may be a better choice.  Run a Magnum on the bottom and a Canon on top

If the hole diameter of the truck baseplate is larger than .373" you will need to epoxy the bolt in place but you will never get it out again.

Hi @Alphamail - thanks for all the info posted.

I would like recommendation on duros for the Pivot Cup and Bushings. I am building an dual motor Bustin Boombox 38'' using TB218 trucks top-mount. My weight is 75kg/165lbs. Wheels is 90mm Flywheels or 6'' pneumies (SixShooters). If with sixshooters became too far from the ground, thinking in drilling deck for drop through truck - not sure yet.

My priority is commute and cruse...def. not high speeds.

Based on the past recommendations....I am thinking in getting:
-  WFB Caliber II Pivot Cups - 95a or 90a ??
- Cone  / Canon  - 95.5a or 93a ???

Thanks again!

All guesses here, but I wanna test myself against what Alpha posts..

95a cups to help carry the extra load of eskating power plants hanging off the hanger.

Reboundy Lively Feel:  APS Fat Cone BS 90a / APS Cannon 90a RS
or
Squishy Stable Feel:  WFB Fat Cone BS / Krankz Cannon RS (85a-93a)

Picked up some 
 
- WFB 96A Pivots
- WFB 88 Fatcones Boardside
- WFB 88 Barrel Rear Roadside
- WFB 83 Barrel Front Roadside

They really are a "you control the bushing" not bushing controls you.

Anyway. I normally pack my kingpin stack with shaved wax, but the WFB formula seems to release this white stuff on it's own...I imagine this is the "self lubricant"

Do you have an life expectancy on when the white stuff stops coming out? Do these dry out quicker?

@Quiles, My personal preference is the WFB 96a pivots for everything I do.  As for bushing compound and durometer, I feel KranK offers the most benefits in that it is the most adjustable to work with.  WFB bushings offer very little adjustment with the kingpin compression so if you miss the right duro, you are stuck.  With KranK, you can run them loose for a extremely nimble setup or tighter for a higher performance setup.  Cone / Canon for you I would go KranK 87a or APS 87.5a

@squishy654 you are right in the sense that durometer is a very poor measure of how a bushing feels and performs.  Modulus and rebound are far better measurements for feel but no one is familiar with using them.  We use those parameters internally but not publically.

Hey @briman05, what are your base plate angles and do you know how old the grizzlies are?   Bear Grizzlies are tricky because several years ago they had two factories making them and they used two different diameters cups.  One around .750" diameter and one at .700".  Ever since it has caused countless problems since some people have one of each on their board.

OK, they are listed on our website [http://www.riptidesports.com/wfb-96a-pivot-cup-choices/](http://www.riptidesports.com/wfb-96a-pivot-cup-choices/)

KranK 90's should work fine for you.  The 852's are a very turny truck so I would go with Barrels for a linear response or larger combinations like a Barrel / Fatcone if you want a more progressive ramp up in resistance.  Are the trucks wedged or dewedged?

Canons or Barrels work great in the TB218's with the Canons a slightly larger diameter so a better fit in the trucks.  87a / 90a will work too just a bit looser.  I would experiment with running them in both positions to see what you like best and also experiment with different washer combinations (flat, cupped, precision).

I will give this a try, first thanks @Alphamail 

My current setup is a 33” board with 195mm Paris trucks V2 with stock bushings, it kind of works, I have it all tighten up to the max I could, but when I aproach 35 km/h it’s not really stable anymore, I doesn’t wobble, but it’s not a relaxing cruise experience, I would like to improve the stability even if I have to sacrifice low speed cornering

I used this exact trucks and bushings on my previous 39” board and it was perfect, stable at speed and very turny at low speed

Second think is, do you have any oficial reseller in Brazil? From the search I did I found just a few places online with a very limited selection

Thanks again

6 inches shorter on the wheel base can make a difference, are you on the 50 degree or 43 degree Paris trucks?  

Brazil is very difficult to maintain a dealer there since the import duties and taxes are ridiculous.  Are your stock Paris bushings a Cone / Barrel or Barrel /Barrel?  

The first thing I would do is be sure the sharp edge of the bushings are towards the hanger, not the rounded edge and use cupped washers

Thanks, they are 50°, but I can easily 3D print some angled risers to teste

I perfectly understand about the dealer situations, sourcing esk8 parts takes a lot of time and fingers crossed that it will arrive quickly

My bushing have sharp edges on both sides, I will give a try again to the cupped washer, I swapped them out because they were hitting the hanger and limiting turning, but I didn’t test ride with them, as you can see there’s little space for the cupped washer

@alphamail, will you please help me with Riptide/truck recommendations for my two E-skate boards?  Board 2 is tricky.
Board 1:
Extremely unstable (killer wobbles) above 17mph with a low-moderate-skilled rider.
Torqueboards 218mm trucks.  Subject to your recommendations, I am likely to add a Cailber II 44 degree baseplate to the rear and leave the front stock  (50 degree?) base plate.   Caliber II 44 plates seem to fit the TB hangers fine.  Besides switching to 44 degree baseplate, I can de-wedge if needed.
I have tried stock bushings, Hard orangutang nipple double barrels both front and rear, stock front and tightened double barrel rear, and none of those combinations are acceptable.
I want it stable in the whole speed range (max 35mph), and AT LEAST be “carvy” enough to be able to do a U-turn in an average street.
The deck is a semi-custom, W-concave, 9 3/8” wide, 31 ¼” from truck axle to truck axle, top-mount with ½” drop.  
I weigh 215lbs and am building my skill level.

Board 2:
Caliber II 10” 50 degree trucks.  Subject to your recommendations, I am likely to add a Cailber II 44 degree baseplate to the rear and leave the front stock base plate.
I want it stable in the whole speed range (max 35mph), and AT LEAST be “carvy” enough to be able to do a U-turn in an average street.  I’m just building this board now, but want it optimized for the below unusual situation.
The deck is a custom W-concave, 10 1/8” wide, 31 ½” from truck axle to truck axle, top-mount with no drop. 
Rider weight is 153lbs, though I’d really like it if I (215lbs) could ride this board, too, at least at lower speeds.  If we went with Kranks suitable for 153lbs, could I tighten a couple turns and get away with reasonable performance for 215 lbs?
Thank you!

Just tested, i found some old 97A bushings that I had. First, my rear truck board side was without any washer, I probably forgot to put when assembling the motors.

Now I have 97A barrel board side and 95A barrel road side, cup washer board side and inverted cup washer road side to it doesn't interfere with the hanger but this provide grater surface area, and rear a little bit tighter than the front

I'ts awesome, stable as was my last board, I can ride at top speed side by side with traffic with total confidence

Thanks for the tips @Alphamail

Thanks, @squishy654!  I wish I would have known sooner, though might still try one. @JasperM, I tried the Caliber 44 baseplates on the TB 218mm hangers and they fit fine.  I also verified all of the key measurements.  As alphamail says, though, the bushing seats are different on the TBs, simply limiting choice of bushings.

Board 1's instability confuses me, it seems as if the trucks are not inline with each other and they are not tracking correctly.  Place a yard or meter stick along one of the base plate edges and slide the straight edge to the second truck to see if they are parallel and inline with each other, if they aren't, you may need to remount one or both of the trucks.  Semi custom could mean hand drilled mounting positions and they are easy to mess up.  If you can post a picture or two.  with a 31.25 axle to axle WB and a 1/2" drop, you standing platform may be a bit tight for a 215 pounder.  Dewedging the rear will certainly help but lets check alignment first.

Board 2:  50/44 will be a good place to start, for the 153 pounder, KranK 87a Canons up front and a Canon / Chubby rear with cupped washers on all three Canons and a flat on the Chubby.  Should be able to get away with a loose king pin nut setting, just snug enough to take out all the slack.  A 62 lb difference can be tough to span with one set up but KranK is your best shot so for the 215 pounder you might need to add a cup washer or three to the Canons to keep safe.  It depends a lot on your riding style and wheel size etc.  Wheel bite needs to be considered anytime you change anything fo check first!

Though I have significant skateboard experience and am pretty brave, I have never ridden downhill or e-board before, so maybe I just need to get used to the speed.  Any bushing/truck recommendations to optimize it would be appreciated, though.  I'm eager to try your Riptides.  For Board 2, I should buy all 4 bushings at 87a duro, even with the 44/50 leverage difference?  Thanks so much for your input.

In the process of dialing in my new set up. I want it to be both stabel for those long straight stretches where I can hit the throttle, and loose and turny for maneuverability when in the city. At first glance I thought that was two opposing things and both not possible, but the last days I have learned that it is possible to have both (the way I want it any way). 

I have Surf-rodz RKP 50, 220mm wide (I believe) with stock 93 bushings (black) and flat washers. 6 inch Pneumatic wheels (sixshooters). RedEmber Obeah6 deck. 

To begin with I ran 50 both rear and front, but fund that I had to clamp down the king ping when speeding, and loosing them again when I wanted maneuverability. I fund the trucks a bit to responsive in the beginning of the turn, and then reaching a dead stop. Then I de-wedged the rear by 15 degrees, and that really took me a long way towards how I want it to be. I dialed in the clamping, so I could steer from the front truck (before I felt that the back turned more than the front). But I have the feeling that the bushings are not that affected by clamping. @Alphamail do you know how the clamping characteristic of the surf-rodz bushings are? 

As I have it now I actually feel that I am close to how I want it, but have the feeling that I can dial it in even more. 

I think I could have the trucks even more stable / less reactive to lean, and at the same time have them loose. And maybe have the ability to tighten up the trucks if I want that for some reason. 

I will properly get a new baseplate (35 degrees) for the rear, so I can get rid og the added risers both in front and back, and have the ability to de-wedge the rear even more. 

I plan to see what a cupped washer can do in the rear. 

I am a bit uncertain on the SR stock bushings. Something just don’t feel optimal. I have a hard time putting my finger on what it is, but somehow they don’t feel as smooth as I would like. They feel like they come to a dead end when turning. That feeling got better after de-wedging the rear but still. 

So I am looking for suggestions to try out. Any further wedging. Washers to use. Bushings to trow in, if thats sugestable over the surf-rodz bushings. Would a pivot cup be worth trying?

I have some Riptide 93a Barrels here that I could easily try if it is that Way I should go. 

I weigh 165 lb. 

I was inspired by this reply you gave earlier:

[quote="Alphamail, post:100, topic:42036, full:true"]
Thank you, here are a couple of general thoughts.  Symmetrical 50 degree base plates are designed for maneuverability, not speed so you need to de-wedge the rear truck using an angled riser at least 10 degrees, 15 or 20 would be better but mounting the truck becomes difficult since the mounting hole spacing is diminishing as you wedge or de-wedge it.  You can also pick up a Caliber 44 degree base plate and add you 10 degree de-wedge will net you a net split of 50 / 34 degree for a more stable set up.  Since you are already using risers, there should be adequate room to do this.  Now that you have a split set up, you need to compensate for the higher leverage that the 34 degree rear truck exerts on the bushings.  My favorite and way of doing this is to run all the same duro and use different shapes in different places.  I weigh about 200 lbs so I would run a Barrel / Barrel front with possible a flat washer / a cupped washer, for the rear I would run a Barrel / Chubby or FatCone with a cupped washer / the Chubby flat washer.  As far as i know the TB 218 will take the Chubby boardside but I will know for sure soon!.

1).  SZ stock bushings will stiffen slightly when clamped.
2).  Cupped washers in the rear are a good idea especially with the dewedged rear and using the KranK 93a Barrels.  Run the KranK 93a barrels up front with flat washers.  I think the 93a KranK will be a bit too stiff for your weight and the angles you are dealing with but it will give you a reference point to compare to the stock bushings.  I think you may end up with 87a Krank Barrels up front and perhaps a Barrel / FatCone rear.  The SZ seat is why we developed the FatCone design in the first place since the SZ RKPs would not fit our Chubby bushing shape

Stock Paris bushings do not fit the seat as well as our Canon and Magnums.  If you FR switch, keep it symmetrical and run a Canon / Magnum combination in either APS 87.5a or KranK 87a and I think you will be gold.  If you want it asymmetrical, run a Canon / Canon front and a Canon / Magnum rear.   

I am recommending a slightly lower duro than stock but upping the size of the bushings to compensate.

I'm using TB 218mm Trucks and find that the stock bushings seem to be too stiff.  I would like more rebound.  My riding style is typically high speed carving (if you consider 20-30 high speed).  A better turning radius would be nice too, but not required.   I'm currently using a Landyachtz downhill board with cutouts, so no wheelbite with my 107 Abec 11's and I keep my back very tight and keep it pretty loose in the front.  Can you recommend a bushing setup for me?  Thanks for the help.

**This is the revised recommendation for Evolve compound trucks and replaces the recommendation below written 01/29/18.  Street shapes have been replaced with ShortStreet shapes!**:    I would use a combination of duro, shape, washers and . force to accomplish this.  Since you are looking for rebound, I suggest our KranK compound, all in 93a.  For the front ShortStreetCone (Cup) / Barrel (Flat) over ShortStreetBarrel (flat) / Barrel (cupped) and the rear I would run ShortStreetBarrel (flat) / Barrel (cupped) over ShortStreetBarrel (flat) / Barrel (cupped).  The suggested washers are listed as a starting point and will allow the front to be a bit easier to turn than the rear.  Always be conscious of potential wheel bite anytime you change or adjust bushings.  Even though we are going down in duro, we are going up in shape and rebound.

Ok I been out experimenting with my surf-Rodz rkp. 

This was my proces... 

Started out with 93a Krank barrels all over and no extra washers (must be equivalent with flat washers everywhere). Tightened the kingpin to the point that I could barely turn the roadside bushing. 

That gave me a feeling of a middel position that was not supported by bushings at all. A freeplay where the hanger was klonking from side to side with no support. I didn't like that. It gave me lots of hanger play but a sudden stop when the bushing began to give support. A bit similar to what I felt with the stock bushings. 

I then tightened the kingpin to the point where the freeplay was taken away and there were support by the bushing form the beginning. I liked that there the support right away, but fund that 93a is properly is to hard. And the trucks didn't feel very precise. 

Take a look at the video at the end to get a visual of what I mean. 

I then put in cupped washers in the rear. I tried both with cups at the top only and also top and bottom. I liked the two cup setup the most. Now I got the more precise feeling that I missed with the no washers set up. But with the washer at the base will I disturb the truck geometri? Would it be better to use the shortstreet barrels with extra washers to get the height to match the height of a normal barrel? 

Anyway... I ended up with something that was a lot better than what I had before, but don't think I am done dailing in. 

To sum what I learned... I like when the hanger gets support from the bushing from the start with no freeplay. I think the 93a are to stif when I want the support from the beginning. I like cupped washers in the rear both at the top and at the bottom. 

I want to try softer bushings 90a or 87a? I want to try cupped washers in in the front. I liked the more precise felling when they were added in the rear, and I am wondering how it would feel in the front. I might want to try to dewedge the front 5 degrees. And then there is the rake thing. Right now I have it in positive rake. Would be fun to see what happens if I flip it. especially in the front.

I am a bit confused by your initial setting described as "Tightened the kingpin to the point that I could barely turn the roadside bushing."  Technically this is correct but the video show that is not the case since there is tons of slop where there should be none.  The SZ grind king pin can be deceptive since the flat washer is the head off the kingpin so there is a lot more resistance to turning the roadside bushings buy hand plus the diameter is closer to .375 than most  You need to rock the hanger back and forth to determine the starting point for bushing compression when using SZ grind kingpins.

Washer boardside will not upset the geometry enough to be an issue plus it depends on how much preload as to where the hanger actually ends up.

90a KranK may be the sweet spot if the 93a is close

@Alphamail

I’m taking advantage of your very kind offer:

1. I'm using toqueboard 218mm trucks.  I think the hangar length is 315mm?

2. No aftermarket bushings at the moment, just the stock black ones

3. I've tightened down the trucks but they still feel quite loose. It feels nice and carvy but i worry about high speeds.

4. I'm looking for the best balance between carvy and stable. I usually travel at 18mph - 24mph if that helps.

5. drop through deck that is top mounted. 100mm MBS wheels, no wheelbite (deck is 39 inches long)

6. I weigh about 195lbs or 89kg.

Let me know if I missed anything/wasn’t clear anywhere.

Thanks again!

A "split setup" is when the rear truck is set at a lower angle than the front, this makes the back truck turn less and the front turns more, they are no longer equal, but "split angles". The Evo longboard deck displays this nicely for you in it's angled front and rear truck mounting areas, that deck had it built in and it works well. You can use an angled deck, wedges, different baseplates, or adjustable brackets or adjustable baseplates to change the angles of any trucks and dial in what you want.

 Split angle setups help stabilize a board while still maintaining some agility...it also feels cool, like its turning more from the front like a car or surfboard. Wobbles typically start at the rear truck, so lowering the angle of the rear truck so it turns less provides a stable rear end a base to turn from, and then you can increase the angle on the front, making it turn more than normal, making up for the loss of turn in the rear, and wobbles go away, so you end up with a board that turns the same as it did before, just in a little bit different way, and the wobbles disappear at higher and higher speeds...this combined with split duros in the trucks (harder in the rear, softer in the front) makes for a sick ride...it's what I did to my "commuter" I have been riding recently, with a 35degree Randal baseplate in the rear, and a Caliber 50 degree baseplate up front, further wedged another 10 degrees..I can keep the bushing soft and it allows me to take quick turns and weave through busy streets like I did in Vegas while testing this setup, but when you hit the throttle it will remain stable to its max speed..sort of like getting cake and eating it too, or managing to land two girlfriends that like each other...split angles make all non-symetrical setups work better..and eskates typically only go in one direction so in reality, all eskates should feature split angles...

Here is a link to my commuter build and you can see the angles I used in the pictures..  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/a-skaters-commuter-build/50222

this subject most likely deserves it's own thread, there's lots of info about trucks people should know... angle, width, rake and seats are all super important factors that all need consideration when dialing in trucks and most people just throw caution to the wind and just get whatever...when it's sort of the difference between your board bucking you off or working with you..a subject I love because it's still a subjective mystery of human preference and "feel". Once you understand it all, you still have to interpret it and dial in the feel you like..

Here is some good reading I just found on it, check this out:

@alphamail:
I have some problem with the stability of my board. This is my setup:
- Loaded Cantellated Tesseract (wides wheelbase option right now)
3.5° positive Wedge based on rocker of the board!
- 44° Caliber II
- 1/2" riser
- 90mm Flywheel
- 85kg rider

My problem is the following:
while riding it is really sensitive to any movement of my front foot. once I stand on my board and drive it is almost impossible to correct the stand of my front foot, because this leads to immediately wobbles. The wobbles are mostly just in a smaller range. So the damping for higher steering angle ist ok! But for micro changes it feels like there is almost no damping at all. I increased the tension of my truck three times already. The first an secound tightenings helped. But meanwhile there is almost no difference.
One mor thing:
while accelerating hard the board feels save. But the moment I leave the throttle it becomes unstable.

so..... what should I do?
Which bushings would you recommend?
Should I wedge my rear truck?
```

I got 10 degrees Khiro soft (60a?) wedges. They've compressed a lot under the hardware and I'm actually concerned it is actually taking force out that would otherwise be used for turning. Looking for shock absorption. 

In terms of this, how would putting a piece of rubber in between trucks and the nut, as well as between the screw head and the board? That way, when dealing with vibrations, the hardware wouldn't "bottom out" with metal against metal, assuming the shock pads are compressing.

This is a bit off topic but I will bite!

As a general thought, shock pads associated with the truck mounting are a bad idea since they severely deaden the response of the trucks.  60a is downright soggy when you get down to it.  I suggest finding a better way to dampen vibration such as a pad under your grip tape or using shoes that cushion your feet.

Sorry, it appears we have some mistakes on our website, sorry for the confusion.  From the Paris bushing section "The Canon shape (along with its companion, the Magnum) is specifically made for trucks with slightly larger, or looser, bushings seats - such as Paris.  It is ever-so-slightly larger than our Barrel shape and has a sharper bevel to the rounded edge, thus eliminating that 'dead-feeling' that can occur if the bushing does not have a nice tight fit in the bushing seat.

So I asked this elsewhere earlier, and I wanted to repost it here because it seems like a pretty good place to get answers from a really good source. :slight_smile:

Basically I'm just trying to figure out best practices when it comes to bushing lubrication to prevent squeaking and other sorts of issues.

Its a weird topic, because you kinda don't want bushings to be too free to move, or they're slide right out of the bushing seat, and pop out of cupped washers. But at the same time if they don't move freely enough, they grab and squeak, and just don't rebound optimally.

 [quote]
Question, what's the best way to deal with bushings & bushing seats?

I'm convinced soap is not a very good fix, but am I crazy for using silicone grease ( in very tiny amounts )?

Ideally bushings wouldn't be able to slide around in the seat at all, but... Thats never going to happen because the bushing literally has to do some sliding to accommodate for movement. But when they do slide, you want them to be able to move smoothly and not grab not squeak.

So what do you do?

In my mind, if you don't want the bushing sliding around too much, then you address that by having a more restrictive bushing seat, and thats why I don't think a small amount of silicone grease shouldn't be a problem, but I still don't think that's ideal.

Riptide bushings come pre lubed with some sort of PTFE powder don't they? Is that the ideal?

I personally have never lubed my bushings.  We have one compound, WFB that is internally lubricated but it is not PTFE powder.  Several people have used our lubricant "Speed" in the Wet version for this purpose and it does not appear to degrade the urethane.  An alternative is graphite powder.  Squeak is normally a small amount of contamination between the seat and the bushing

hi, with your advice i went to Sickboards to test it out. i ended up purchasing a new caliber II which i kept stock, and i purchased a pack of APS 90A chubbies and some wedges. the fatcones were a little too small (weird chinese sizes smh) but the chubby actually fit very nice boardside. for roardside i used a stock paris bushing which fits nice n snug. i wedged the fron and dewedged the rear.

all in all the board feels more stable at speed and still lively enough to make decent turns and carves. the wedges also added some extra wheel clearance for the turns! thanks for your advice Alpha!

I thought that the fatcone would fit nicely, but there was just a little bit of wiggle room. I also tried the larger diameter ones (cannons i believe) in it but those were just a hair too big and would sit weird. With “weird chinese sizes” I referred to the truck being chinese made, thus having weird measurements for bushings and pivot cups.

There are just so many options! I've put off begging for answers in this thread but if anyone wants to chime in I'd be grateful :slight_smile:

Load : 200 lbs / 90kg

Trucks : TB 218mm

Wheels : 6" Pneumatic Tires

Mount: Dropthrough

Deck Length : 39"

I currently use a double barrel setup of Orangatang Yellow 89a on a similar board (though not dropthrough) which is fine, but I want my new board to be perfect. With the double barrel I can make sharp turns and still be stable at speed. I ride pretty carvey in general, but like to hit 25mph when commuting

Anyway my TB 218mm has all stock right now, so I'd like to replace the pivot cups and bushings. I was thinking the WFB 96a for pivot cups, but have never bothered to replace them before so I don't know

Open to all suggestions. Which pivot cup? Should I stick to double barrel on both sides or a barrel/chubby in the back? Teach me the ways oh gurus, just don't make me use the search function :stuck_out_tongue:

Hey @SuperBen, My personal favorite is the 96a Caliber II pivots for the TB218's and as for bushings you have a lot of choices, From above:

Cone / Cone: Extremely carvey set up, generally used for low speed pedestrian slalom, campus crusing
Cone / Canon: Playful carving set up, good for commuting where tight turns are occasionally needed. Low to medium speeds
Canon / Canon: Versatile set up for medium to high speeds, can be run loose for tight turns and tighter for high speeds. Response is very linear
Canon / FatCone: Similar to the Canon / Canon but the response is progressive. Resistance ramps up progressively the further you go.
Canon / Magnum: Extremely stable set up, meant for very high speeds or a heavier rider with a wide board



We weigh the same so KranK 90 or APS 90 should work great in the desired shape combo description above

When you say Canon is that the same as barrels? I ask because I don't see the word canon on any part of your site. 

Right now I'm thinking 

Pivot: 96a
Front Trucks: Krank 90a Barrel / Krank 90a Barrel
Rear Trucks: Krank 90a Barrel Roadside / Krank FatCone 90a Boardside

Does that look about right? And should fit my TB 218mm trucks?

1- Taco Trucks. Dunno what they are because they came from an old Stella Pintail. I think 90° but unsure.

2- Barrel/cone 83 duro

3- They feel great at speeds up to 20mph but are really touchy and jumpy at anything higher. Sometimes it feels like it suddenly compresses and won't rebound when going straight which could mean my trucks are too tight? Not too bad of a turning circle now but I'd like to keep it small. I want more stability at high speeds without sacrificing too much turning ability.

4- Commuting full speed to work on smooth roads. 

5- Zenit Marble 38, no wheelbite problems with my current setup but it does get close on really tight turns.

6- 130lbs.

This set up could be the one to go with. But I want to see and feel what happens if I change the rear angel even further. I have a 35 baseplate that I will try and dewedge it to 25 and 30 and feel what happens.

Rear: I put on the 35 degree baseplant. Dewegede it to 25 and tried two sets of bushings. 1. krank 90 chubby board side and krank 90 barrel road side. 2. Krank 93 barrel with cupped washers both road side and board side. 

Front: 50 degrees and krank 87 barrel both board and road side. 

I like the 90 chubby / barrel setup better. This gives me the feeling that the resistance is the same both front and rear. This is the first time I feel this, and it really makes the lower speed riding, turning and handling better. The 93 set up made the rear to stiff.

This config is the best I have tried yet. I get my loose trucks that I like and it makes me do lower speed hard carving and tight turns. It takes me to 30 mph with no problem. It is like takes out the turnyness of the setup when speed increases. Its a funny feeling having a board with that loose trucks, but feeling totally safe at high speed. I can feel the loose trucks and waiting for trouble, but it just doesn't come. I can change foot position and move around at full speed now without feeling unstable. Something that was not possible for me before. I feel the movement in the board, but it is stable. 

As I wrote this is the best set up until now, and I am pretty happy with it. I will stop the experimentation for now, been giving it a lot of attention, and I need to just riiiiide now. I will give it a long go and see if I down the road needs some adjustments. I don't bother trying the 30 degrees, its kind of a hassel to change wedge back and forth :) 

So after all it was possible get get both sides. Loose trucks and stability at higher speeds. 

Thanks for your help and patience @Alphamail it is much appreciated!

Ohh... by the way I also threw in some 96 pivot cups, so now I am totally covered by Riptide :)

The next thing I might want to experience is having harder bushing board side and softer road side. It seems to be quite popular when I read around DH sites. Do you have anything in general to say about what we get out of that config in contrast to having same duro both board and road side?  I see people running 68-74/96-98

@Alphamail what’s your recommendation for a Torqueboards style truck with 52/46 degree baseplate angle? I am approx. 70 kg with all the gear on and thought about APS barrel bushings 0.6” board and street side (yellow 90a = front, red 95a = back)?  

Thx

Hey what is your wheelsbase on this setup? measure from inside truck hardware to inside truck hardware bolts...

With a 50 baseplate, you can get pretty surfy with a barrel/cone combo, but I want to make sure your wheel base is long enough to remain stable at 25km with such a setup..

16 is too short for a 50 degree rkp, 16 inches is like 1980's short skateboard wheelbase..I have something near 19inches on Calibers and I had to use 44 to get it stable...you will need to be over 19 inches and most likely need a longer hybrid type deck...your other option is using a 35 degree Randal rear baseplate to get the rear really dead, and then use a Carver CX front truck to get that "surfy" feel you want...typically a surfy feel is due to over 4mm of rake or extremely split angles and/or a combo of both...bushings alone will not make a setup feel "surfy" by itself, but it will tune a surfy setup well..Calibers have zero rake and are notoriously unsurfy..

I weigh over 90kg (over 200lbs) so my experience is totally different than what yours will be...but you should start soft, like 85a and below..only you and your weight and feel and opinion matters, but yeah, start softer and adjust from there..your best bet is the Krankz formula as they are more forgiving in their pre-load adjustment..

This might be a great place to start....
Boardside: 87a Krankz Barrels
Roadside: 87a Krankz Cones

Because the roadside is going to control the feel more, maybe get a few duro option for the cones for initial tuning...the 85a and 90a...same for the barrel if you have the cash...its better to have options, so I would just get a pile of all the softer options..

Hey @stormboard1 the first thing I would do is ditch the soft riser since they are prone to unpredictable handling.  If vibration is an issue, there are other ways to deal with that.  A tall, 50 degree symmetrical setup will be prone to instability so after you replace the soft risers, dewedge the rear by at least 10 degrees to take some of the steering input out of the rear and leave the front at 50 for now.  Alternatively if you want to keep it symmetrical, replace the baseplates with 44's to settle the setup down a bit.  As for bushings, it will depend a lot on what you decide to do with the suggestions above.  If you do not want to change anything except the bushings, I suggest a pair of Canons up front and a Canon / Chubby rear in APS 90a or KranK 90a

Your deck has two different wheelbase options as well (25.5 - 26.5)

Changed the stock bushings of my Caliber II's against purple Orangatang nipples with flat washers and I have to say the ride has heaps improved compared to the barrel / cone setup with cupped washer on the street side. Also, the sideways slop has slightly improved since the Orangatang nipples are slightly larger in diameter. I will make some insert bushings out of the old barrels and see how this goes.

Hi, just wanted to confirm what I have thought and ask what you think about it ;)

I have Evo 39" deck, front calibers 50º 10" and rear caliber 44º baseplate and TB218 hanger. I will be using 6.5" pneumatic wheels with our 1:3 gear drive.

At the moment after doing some research I ordered these things:

* Riptide Pivot Cups (set of 2) - Durometer : 96A, Type : Caliber II
* Riptide KranK Canon Bushings - Durometer : 93A
* Riptide KranK StreetFatCone Bushings - Durometer : 93A

Thinking of trying these setups:

[quote="Alphamail, post:177, topic:42036"]
Canon / Canon: Versatile set up for medium to high speeds, can be run loose for tight turns and tighter for high speeds. Response is very linear

Canon / FatCone: Similar to the Canon / Canon but the response is progressive. Resistance ramps up progressively the further you go.
[/quote]

I am 182cm ~83kg the board will weight around 13-15kg. I am running pretty bumpy asfalt roads many small hill bumps which makes my trampa jump and etc... I would like to have high speed stability I hate to drive slow right now cause at higher speed its getting unstable... But still manage to do some sharp 90º turns...

What do you think @Alphamail ?

Yeah 65 is a lot of turn for the front by any ones std, you can always wedge/de-wedge later to get it where you want though. 

I'd ride it first, even if you just kick it about.

Brad doesn't do any wedge-risers though as far as I know you will have to find them else where...

Having owned and ridden that absolute crap out of 4 Evo's (x2 Evo & x2 Evo Falcons) I would suggest you try the built in deck geometry.  The back is at 35°, the front is at 65°.  The back is dewedged to lessen the turnability of the rear to make it more stable.  The front is wedged increase the carvability/turnability.  

I have found that wedging the back to 45° will increase the turnability but will make it noticeably less stable at high speeds.  You could then dewedge the front to 55° to increase turnability, but then you essentially have a regular drop deck...so why?

I know some guys who are doing ultra-high speed runs with some mondo tuck are finding an altered geometry to be beneficial but I think 99% of people will be losing the benefit of the board geometry by altering it.

On to bushings...
My setup is a little less traditional than most because I hated the slow return of the deck on deep carves.  THis is what I cam up with to resolve the issue and it made this board a beast.

* front, road side  >  WFB Barrel 93a (Red)
* front, board side  >  KranK Street Barrel 93a (Maroon)
* rear, road side  >  WFB TALL Barrel 95.5 (Green)
* rear, board side  >  KranK Street Chubby 96a (Grey)

OK, a couple of things, do you know the evo deck wedge and de-wedge?  If it is at 15 degrees you are now at 65 (15 + 50) front and 29 rear (44-15).  That is a bit steep for the front do I would suggest de-wedging the front by 10 t0 15 degrees or run the 44 up front and the 50 in the rear for a 59 / 35 split which will work fine for higher speeds.  Since the rear has  lot more leverage over the bushings than the front, you will need to compensate to balance the set up.  Since the TB 218's take the following from my post on 02/02/18:

With the durometer remaining constant the relative feel follows:

_Cone / Cone: Extremely carvey set up, generally used for low speed pedestrian slalom, campus crusing_
_Cone / Canon: Playful carving set up, good for commuting where tight turns are occasionally needed. Low to medium speeds_
_Canon / Canon: Versatile set up for medium to high speeds, can be run loose for tight turns and tighter for high speeds. Response is very linear_
_Canon / FatCone: Similar to the Canon / Canon but the response is progressive. Resistance ramps up progressively the further you go._
_Canon / Magnum: Extremely stable set up, meant for very high speeds or a heavier rider with a wide board_

**I suggest running a Canon / Canon Front and a Canon / Magnum rear in KranK 90a but this may need to be fine tuned depending on what your final truck angles end up being.**

As for the pivots, 96a is great!  Regarding the StreetFatCone, throw that in some Indys for some fun as it will be too short for the Calibers (.5" tall verses .6")

@Kug3lis 

Durometer is a measure of hardness and it roughly translates into resistance of lean for a given weight.

X/Y = Top / Bottom or Roadside / Boardside

The word Street designates a .5:" tall bushing usually used in TKP trucks, a standard Magnum is .6" tall.

The lever arm is measured from the top of the deck to the base plate so unless you are using a big stack of risers, the leverage is not effected by the overall height of the wheels.  If you feel 90a will be too soft, go for the 93a KranK

Today I received my ordered parts... Damn the evo is good... 

Also I only received two bushings I was thinking like many told me that it will come for set of two trucks... So good thing.. The problem with canon bushings was that caliber original washers did not fit. Also the height was bit high needed to squeeze to get the nut on. With 93A I am able to turn the truck not the same as I did with original caliber bushings... Plus I got two different bushing on calibers one was cone on roads another barrel so was interesting.

Also I don't know if that's because of my 70mm Chinese wheels but then I fully turn one wheel lifts off the ground is that normal?

@Alphamail so i didnt test out the stock caliber bushings like i should instead i changed them out and not sure where the stock ones are but this is what i changed to..
 93a riptide wfb barrel bushings
88a riptide wfb cone bushings
large khiro cup washers
Atlas Precision Top Hat Washers
Riptide Pivot Cups (set of 2) - Durometer : 95A,
then i swapped the wfb cones and precision washers to the cones from the tb218 trucks and used theyr cup washers as the precision washer dug into the wfb cones and ruined them.
think this might be causing the speed wobbles

Can you get the hanger on Bro (@banjaxxed)? Looks like you did and they fit? You actually want the pivot cup/tube to come out to the shoulder of the pivot on the hanger to help support it to prevent lateral movement.

The white stuff is just WFB lube ;) keeping them "Worlds Fastest Bushings" :rocket:

OK so I swapped the tb218 cups washers back to the atlas precision top hat washers and loosen the trucks because they were literally stupid tight..so tight the hanger was grinding :man_facepalming:

So now running cup washer & wfb 93a barrel bushings boardside and atlas precision top hat washers & tb218 cone bushings roadside and riptide 95a Pivot cups.

the trucks are tightened to one groove on the kingpin.. I was told as you speed up they tighten up as in not be as carvying as they are very loose atm..

@Cobber is was a bit of a fight & nothing like sliding in a caliber pivot, I actually had to use a grip vice to get them in.

I can't uncut the cut, back to sickboards for me,at least a spare will come in handy down the road & now we all know TB 218s will slot into a Randal baseplate fopr sure,which means you're not stuck with 44 or 50 baseplates

@stormboard1 I saw your PM and you definitely have them too tight.  Rule of thumb for our bushings is tighten to the point where there is no slop but you can still turn the roadside bushing in the seat by hand.  Tighten from there no more than 2 full turns for APS and KranK.  For WFB, one turn maximum.  In all the discussions, I have lost track of what you are trying to do so please recap here.

Randal is so over the map matching the BP hole diameter and the rough, oblate shaped Randal hanger pivot nose (the new ones are better now) plus the depth the pivot goes in to the 35 vs the 42 vs the 50, we opted to default to very tight to cover the wide tolerances we were confronted with.  Some Randal's, I need to use a vice to install.  Caliber trucks are much more consistent so we did not need to compensate for such a wide tolerance

I put one of those pivots into the 35 Randal and I've been riding it with it sticking out like that, and it's a non-issue..it works fine..and it's still better than the stock. The only concern would be any added fiction from touching the hanger's "wings" but it's not notable..

@Alphamail, I'm doing a small build and plan on using some indy 215's. The idea is to have stability at speeds of about 25mph max for my 185lb ass, but still have a decent carvy feel as i would like to take this setup in a bowl and just ride until dark. The Indys were purchased in 2008 if that makes a difference in measurements. 
Love your products and the value you add to the skate scene.

You will need a longer wheel base or de-wedging of the indy 215's to get them stable above 20mph, which means they will not carve a bowl at that point, they will lack the turn needed. I've done this. 

I have a wedged indy 215 setup on a 19inch wheelbase and I can carve bowls with it, but I wouldn't go 25mph on it, too unstable, but for slower speed freeriding and sliding it works well. Its just not a DH bomber by any means..

As for bushings on the Indys the street kranks work well and remember to go a little harder than you think you need with such a wide truck, you have more leverage on those...

I know kranks are where i want to go, was more looking at specific shapes of street series bushings that would work best with the indys and for my application. Hoping to have @Alphamail to weigh in when he gets a chance, but that's for your input @squishy654.

There are always compromises and ways to max or min the effects.  I often run a synthetic split when it is not practical to change the truck angles.  For your setup, I would suggest a ShortStreetCone / StreetBarrel front and a ShortStreetBarrel / StreetChubby rear in KranK 90a.  Some 215's were set up with a longer kingpin so you may be able to use taller bushings than what I have suggested here.  Measure the height of the top and bottom bushings, they are normally .4" and .5" respectively.  Let me know what you find.

OK, I found my review of the 180's:  

OK, here is what I found about the Torqueboard 50 degree V2 trucks and what RipTide fits where for upgrade purposes. The pivot cup that fits is our Indy 96a WFB pivot. It is dimensionally very close to the stock pivot and goes into the base plate a little easier than we like to see but it is tighter on the hanger pivot nose so it does make for a functionally good tight fit when assembled. As for bushings, the trucks will accept our standard longboard bushings both boardside and roadside. The hanger will take the following shapes that we make: Cone, Barrel, Canon, and FatCone. The tightest fit in the hanger is the Canon bushing which is slightly larger diameter than our Barrel. Additionally, the king pin length does not leave much room so you may elect to not use a boardside bushing at all when using two .6" tall bushings or you can run our Street series bushings in the roadside position since they are .5" tall compared to the longboard series which is .6" tall"

That being said, do you have the ability or want to wedge and / or de-wedge the trucks or do you just want to work with the bushings?

![image|500x500](upload://q8DlypylkfFNrE7hrI3VsVKWvDY.jpeg)1. Evolve double kingpin trucks. 

2. 
Rear truck: 
boardside: cup washer, venom 98a SHR barrel (.6″ tall x .97″ wide), bones 96a cones, flat washer. 
Street side: same

Front truck:
boardside: cup washer, venom eliminatirs  90a, venom 95a cones, flat washer. 
Street side: same

All stock cups. 

3. I use freebord bindings so I put a lot more torque on the trucks. They feel stiff and at top end (33mph+) prone to wobble. 

I would like a setup that feels a little more soft and consistent at end range motion, yet still can tolerate low 30s for bursts when I have to fight traffic. 

There have been rare perfect days when bushings were new or perfectly compressed when my board felt so carvey and stable, I thought I was on a snowboard again and I did a double take to make sure I was going to catch a toe edge in the nonexistent snow pack. I want this snowboard feeling. I think I steer with my rear foot sometimes, which I think I like. 

I know my king pins are over tightened. I switched over to titanium hardware to get stupid tight compression with out stripping hardware. 

4. I ride street (carving and fast) 70% of the time, grass and parks 30% (small tricks, nothing extreme). 

5. Bustin sportier 36 pro. No wheel bite ever. On 8in pneumos. Dropthrough set up, no risers or wedging. 

6. I weight 170lbs, board approaches 30lbs. Back pack up to 10. 

Thanks for any thing you can add. I read some of the other double kingpin set ups, I think I ride differently and have different goals.

I know. I thought I’d throw it out there for the skate God’s to mull over and granting me even fractional improvements. 

Some rare days, I swear it is perfect, but the bones bushing go to mush. Mostly my fault. I’m always trying to tweak things (just ask @E1Allen)  Every time I pull off trucks, I have to undo the boardside bushing set up because the drop through slot locks the truck in. Maybe should cut (see yellow lines) the slots to allow for easier tinker time:
![image|374x500](upload://kA3AHw0OD3q3ZZ1H3qYD3bkLppz.jpg)

Is this a dumb idea? I plan to glass the board to unfuck all the screw holes in the deck from past experiments. 

Really, I just need to suck it up and buy motor cycle steering dampers ala etoxx and put them on a set of channel trucks. 

Do pivot cups really do much? Would I gain anything from a bit o’ wedge action?

OK the front turns fine so I would just dewedge (make the kingpin more vertical) the rear about 5 degrees then run KranK 87a Barrels all around and use Cupped washers in back and flat washers in the front to compensate for the 5 degree split or dual cups in the back and a Flat / cupped in the front.  For some reason wedge companies only give out the dimensional difference front to back so you are looking for a height difference of .26" over the 3" run of the wedge.

Looks like a fun set up, I think I would set it up progressively increasing resistance from the top front to the bottom rear but it sounds like you are looking to perhaps slash the rear a bit causing a bit of rear oversteer, is that what you are saying?

So we are on the same page term wise, does this work for you?
Top being the closest to the ground and the bottom being the closest to the deck (servicing orientation whole working on the board)

Since there are 4 pairs of bushings we will reference top pair front, bottom pair front, top pair rear and finally bottom pair rear

top pair front:  
bottom pair front
top pair rear
bottom pair rear

Hi there, first post so bear with me if I don't format correctly.

1. **The brand of truck you are using plus the base plate angles and hanger width. If it is a clone, I need the bushing Outside Diameter, Inside Diameter height to the .1" or .1 mm, and shape (normally a Cone/Cone, Cone/Barrel or Barrel/Barrel for stock set ups).**

Currently I have the diyeboard 10s5p kit. I'm on the stock trucks it comes with but I threw some double barrel 93a bushings in the rear for the time being and kept the barrel cone setup on the fronts. On hand, I have paris 50*, cal2 50*, and cal2 44* trucks available.

2. **If you are using aftermarket bushings, I need the bushing brand, duro and shape that are in the trucks currently.** 

I have Blood Orange 93A Barrel and Cones available, I also have stock paris bushings, and 90a/96a double barrel bushings available.

3. **I need to know how the trucks feel and what you want to change: Do you want it looser, tighter, more stable, less stable, more rebound, less rebound, etc…**

Currently the deck is a little dead feelings, I eliminated the rear driven wobble by sticking some double barrels in the rear but would like some more turnability. At speed, I'm pretty happy with the board, it just needs a tad more maneuverability. My daily downhill board is a rayne isis with 44cal double barrel 93a in the rear dewedged to 35*, 44 cal barrel cone 93a in the front for reference; so I don't mind a little rebound.

4. **Type of skating you want to use the setup for.**

This is mainly a daily commuter/speed setup. I am usually in the 20-28mph range unless in tight areas or where theres a lot of pedestrians.

5. **Deck you are using and how likely the set up will wheel bite.**

I'm using a landyachtz switchblade 38, I have 0.5" risers on the board. Top mounted on the diyeboard oem trucks w/ the stock 90mm wheels. I have no wheel bite currently, I'll be switching to abec 11 97's next week but still won't get any bite at the moment.

6. **How much you weigh.**

I weigh 175 lbs.

Unrelated but what section would I post in for modding the 10s5p kit? I wanted to get an idea of what modds are out there, whats available, etc.

On my first ride I got speed wobbles (I ride skateboards so not a total newbie) which did not expect on that particular deck.
I have some Riptide pivot cups 96A on my cart but I am undecided yet on the bushings.

Thanks.

@taz

I'm going to guess 82a to 87a krank barrel/barrel. You will need a to increase the duro of the rear truck here, maybe just a fatcone of the same duro on the board-side would do the trick and provide a more progressive and stable feel for the drive truck.

OK @MrMeowgii looks like you are just looking for a bit more maneuverability.  If you are using cupped washers in any of the 4 positions, start changing them out for flat washers to remove some of the restriction you are experiencing.  If that is not enough, you might need to go to a different durometer

Hey @taz if you are running the stock bushings at those angles, the front will be very hard to turn and the rear will be very easy due too the difference in leverage a 65/37 split places on the bushings.  You can adjust with durometer and / or shape.  If you have some cones, throw those up front and run barrels or bigger in the rear (FatCones or Chubbys).  If you have all the same shape, say barrells, you will need at least 5 to 10 points different in durometer to compensate.  Something like 80a or 85a Barrels up front and 90a Barrels in the back.

FWIW It did not look to my eyes like the Evo board has +-15 angles so I did a quick measuring.
I do not know if they have changed the angles but mine is nowhere near 15 degrees.
The rear is de-wedged approx. 7degrees and the front wedged 9 degrees.
No fancy equipment was used, just my phone with a level app.
This puts the rear at 50 degrees (considering the pads installed) and the front at 59 degrees.

Edit: I found another reason the board is so unstable. Loose baseplates. I do not want to spam this thread with irrelevant details so more can be found here

All right, I was about to order a bunch of bushings, but would love some expert guidance!

I am running dual 6374 12s 15/40 ratio on Abec 107s.  I am a little over 200lbs with all my stuff.

I am on some wide Surf Rodz Rkps with an adjustable baseplate. I am still fiddeling with different baseplate angles.  Right now it is about 40 degrees in the back and 45 or so in the front. I am thinking about taking the front closer to 50 and leaving the back the same.

My bushings are stock crap and too squishy for me.  I like turnability for sure, but I can gun the acceleration or take it much north of upper 20mph without it feeling a little too loose (even when over tightened).

I would like to buy a good bit of bushings to dabble with.  

@Alphamail. If you could give me some ideas and a list of $60-90 worth  of bushings/pivot cups to try out, that would be sick!

OK @Sender, SZ RKP's can take our Cone, Barrel, Canon and FatCone, I would suggest the variety of shapes to chose would be combinations of Cones, Canons and FatCones in the KranK compound for the greatest adjustability.  For your weight and the range of the trucks base plate angle, you have a lot to try out.  Most split setups achieve the desired results with 10 to 20 degrees of difference so you could go 60/40, 55/35, 50/30, 45/25, 40/20 if the increments are 5 degrees.  Once you drop below 40 in the front, maneuverability begins to suffer but if you are flying down open roads, it will be stable and predictable, and even more so as the rear approaches 0 degrees.  With any split, the front needs to be softer than the rear if you are working with durometer, conversely keeping the durometer the same, the front bushings need to be smaller (Cones / Cone or Canon / Canon, Canon / Canon) then the rear (Canon / Canon, Canon / FatCone, FatCone / FatCone).  We weigh about the same and I normally work with KranK 90a but most of my hangers are narrower than yours and SZ trucks are a bit twitchier than others so I suggest KranK 93a for you.  1 pair each KranK 93a Cones and 2 pairs each KranK 93a Canons and FatCones so you can run a load of combinations!  The starting point for tightness on KranK is taking all the slop out of the kingpin stack but you can still turn the roadside bushing in the seat by hand at least a little.

@Sender, I find the surf keys to be a detriment to stability in SZ trucks, it takes an already twitchy center and makes it more so.  If I ever used them at all, it was in the front truck with a really stiff rear.   You findings may be different but I did not like them for the most part.

Hey alpha! I had talked with you a bit early but i went to do some studying so I’m back again.

I’m currently using stock baseplates on a tb 218mm trucks. I use 96a krank barrel and cone. Barrel boardside and come roadside. Same config both back and front. The board feels okay but i want to emulate the surfiness of double king pin trucks. I am open to using wedged risers and also changing base plates. Any advice? I’d also love some stability when i add this surfiness

Local hardware stores can provide washers in a pinch, try the 5/16 first to see if it will fit over the king pin since the hole tolerances are so big with hardware stores.  For cones, the big end go into the hanger so big end facing big end.  Before you order anything else, try what I suggested to see if it works..

```

## \#513 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2018-06-17T18:07:36.184Z Reads: 127

Personally I do not correlate rebound with speed wobbles since when I started to skate, I experienced it with various rebound bushings.  I found rider technique and experience a far greater influence over wobbles than anything else.  

The first technique I learned was to relax your legs when the wobbles start and do not try to fight the wobbles, this counterintuitive technique is difficult to learn but it works.  You have to let your legs go limp.  

Second was dominant weight distribution over the front truck.  This goes a long way to prevent wobbles and also why I am not a big fan of dropthrough boards or drop boards where you cannot stand over or just on the rear mount screws of the front trucks.  The further you are away from the front truck, the more you will be prone to wobbles.  

Third, is running a split setup where the front turns more than the rear, like a car.  This will compensate a lot if you cannot be over the front truck as in the Second above.

Fourth, which is unique to eSk8 may be running front wheel drive as @MoeStooge is demonstrating but more research is needed to test this as he is running a 20 / 0 split with 20 degree front and a 0 degree rear.

Count me in as another thrilled customer. I installed the rear de-wedge, bushings and washers yesterday and I am beyond pleased. I was pretty happy with my O. Nipples but this set up is significantly better in every way. I was worried the rear of the board would feel lazy at medium speeds after de-wedging, but it really doesn't. It's actually even more lively, carvy and fun while being way more stable at higher speeds. Truly the best of both worlds Duro seems perfect for my weight and application as well. Thanks @Alphamail!

My bushings arrived so I did some testing.
First the pivot cups are a lot better fit compared to the stock ones that are too loose.
I put the 93a web barrels in the rear and the 83a barrels in the front. Unfortunately I did not have cupped washers that would fit the roadside bushings so I flipped the small ones that came stock with the trucks. Loved the carviness however it was a little loose when speed was increasing.
Put in the 88a in the front and it tamed it a little while still turning better compared to the stock bushings. 
I am thinking about ordering 95.5a wfb barrels for the rear and large cup washers. What do you think?

So I got some 88a Riptide WFB barrels (I'm 115 lbs) and wow what an upgrade from the generic cone/barrels I had before. An issue I have though is that I didn't have enough of the right washers and had to use a cupped one which dug into and cut off a small piece of my rear bushing that was bulging out of the washer. I don't think it's an issue but will it reduce the life of that bushing?

You may be tightening it too much or it is too soft for your weight.  Please keep an eye on it to be sure the cut does not propagate causing the bushing to split.  Usually exterior (outside diameter) cuts are not much of an issue, but cuts and splits on the interior diameter are dangerous

Hey Brad some feedback and asking for some advice?
I have set up my Ronin 165/155 & 155/145 with your double crank barrels/pivot tubes (faster freeride DH). Both item have a tighter fit with RipTide. The Ronin hollow kingpin seems to be a shade larger than others. I need to wrap something around the bushings to pull them off by hand. Also marginally yours are a touch taller, adding to a bit more pre-load. I've dropped some of the cupped washers I was using as a result.
I also put some of your bushings in some Rogue cast I just got, the stock 90a don't have enough beef for me.
The 96a Krank I pinched out of my other Ronin's, is this what you would recommend for me for this style of truck? (slower freeride). Running rounded narrow icey wheels.

Ronin: 165/155 & 155/145, front 45 degree & 5mm rake, rear 25degree & 2.5mm rake. 96a Krank barrels all round. Running large wide square off set wheels on both.

Rogue: 186mm, F/R 48 degree, 2mm rake (I'm ridding on a Rayne Darkside if you know it?)

**Should I stick with Krank?** I like your theory of keeping the same duro bushing type and changing shapes. 

**What is best for the insert/kore bushing & pivot tube?**

Should I stick with Krank or go matching WFB, the Kore only goes to 93a Krank?

so many questions... all written in between watching the world cup, sorry mate :neutral_face:

The bad:
I got speed wobbles even with them at 40km/h.
I am either completely incompetent or there is something wrong with my board. Although most would bet on the former, the fact that I spent the last couple of days trying to figure out why it randomly cuts out does not rule out the latter.

Back off the angles if you have anything wedged, increase the wheelbase, use split angles if not already by 1st de-wedging the rear angle, use solid secure riser pads no rubber floppy stuff...

I've moved away from cupped washers and precision cups on my board because of the increased rebound. Rebound is not good for preventing speed wobbles.

If you haven't, try some flat washers- they will allow you to lean and turn more, but they reduce rebound a crap ton compared to cups. Back in my DH days, that's all we would ever use was flat washers and we never had any issues with speed wobble. If you don't have flat washers, just flip your cups (for roadside at least).

If not using WFB or other internally lubricated bushings, I like to rub my bushings and washers real good on a bar of soap to get them nice and coated up.

BTW, not saying this is *why* you got speed wobble, but it's one thing that could certainly help.

@Cobber I need to think about this a bit but some general thoughts are I don't usually mix compounds as figuring out what is doing what is complex enough and I don't need characteristics cancelling each other out (this is a personal problem) Can you measure the recess for the insert bushing of the Rogues, when they first came out they were too large for our Kores but our Kores fit their precisions.  They may have fixed this issue.
For the pivot, I would stick with the Cup as not many carry our Rogue tube.  I am traveling so I will continue to respond intermittently.

I don't know how to thank you and Alphamail
The board now is finally stable and yet it turns easier and it carves better than when I got it.
I removed all the rubber angled riser pads and since none of the local skate shops carried hard riser pads I made some in my mini mill from a plastic cutting board.
The difference is night and day. I also tried dewedging the front by putting back one of the soft angled risers but it seems that whatever stability I gain from the smaller angle in the front I lose due to the flex in the pad so it is more or less the same. Definitely worth exploring smaller front angles though.
I will try a hard wedge in front and a few more bushing combinations to improve it even more but even now the board finally is ridable.

And to stay on topic the menu this weekend had fish 😋

OK, interesting set up with all the width options.  Are you running a different width front and back? I take it these are precision hangers?  With the .375 Ronin Kingpin, our bushings are tight but that is better than loose.  Mist kingpins out there are .370 and lower, the AN-26 bolts I use are .373 so some compromises need to be made.  Usually after a short break in time the bushings will slide on and off the Ronin KP.  Ours are slightly taller to allow for preload and eventual compression set.  I usually do not use a boardside bushing on Ronins.  Personally I would stay with KranKs in Ronins as the WFB are very pliable and the lean can be excessive with not a lot of return force.  I am curious how you are ending up with 5mm rake in front and 2.5 in back.  Please explain.  I should be able to cover the rest of it once I know more.

hi there, im hoping you can assist me in getting a bushing set up. im currently using tb218 trucks with the stock bushings (dont have calipers for measurements) and i find them very hard; but i seem to NEED to run them very tight or there is bad stability.
i ride my set-up hard (for what it is), its an 8s dual 192kv on a vanguard clone board with tiny amounts of flex, 0 chance of wheel bite with 97mm flywheel clones. I weigh 170lbs and typically ride all out (40-45kph) for most of my rides. I find the current stock tb218 bushing very stiff and make it difficult to turn (i feel like i need to lean way too much to get it to go where i want it to go), where as caliber ii trucks/bushings felt much better than this. i want to be able to loosen the trucks to make turning and carving better, while still having some (more) stability at high speeds.

thanks for taking the time to help the community out like this. :grin::+1:

Hey @Alphamail thank you for taking the time to answer all of our questions. I am about to start the build of my first ESK8 with an Arbor Dropcruiser deck, Torqueboards 218mm trucks front and rear, 6380 motors and a 12S4P battery pack. Suffice to say it ain't gonna be slow :wink:. I haven't built it yet so I don't have any experience, but I plugged in the specs to an ESK8 speed calculator and the top speed should be in the ballpark of 35 to 40 MPH. Obviously I will hardly ever be going that fast, but I wanted to get your input on the best bushings for mitigating speed wobbles at those speeds while still retaining a carvey feel at lower speeds. I weigh 130 LBS. After reading through this entire thread I think I'm gonna go with KranK Cone 87A/Krank Canon 87A front and KranK Canon 87A/KranK Canon 87A back. Another thing I am confused about is street vs. regular bushings. Will regular bushings roadside and boardside fit on TB 218s, or does one of them need to be street? What are the benefits/drawbacks of street and regular? Thanks again for putting up with all my newbie questions.

so ive read through the thread and ive come to the decision i need to get some 96a  WFB caliber pivot cups, a set of those precision washers...i read  from an earlier post by @Alphamail that canon/canon set up for bushings ;  

[quote="Alphamail, post:177, topic:42036"]
Canon / Canon: Versatile set up for medium to high speeds, can be run loose for tight turns and tighter for high speeds. Response is very linear

one thing im confused about is the duro hardness i need, and just want to clarify what canon/ canon actually means...it means i want canons and on the board side AND the road side?

Duro is really a personal thing, the heavier you are the harder you want. 

My basic setup usually starts at 96 boardside front a rear, 94 roadside rear, 90-94 roadside front. I'm a big fan of precision washers and cups too. 

I usually run double barrel, cones tent to wobble with me I er 25sh. I use cones in RKP trucks on cruisers, never on TKP ttucks.

I'm sure some will argue, but this is what I've been most successful with.

Is your stock setup with the TB218's a Cone / Barrel.  If so, try this to start with:  
In the front, run the cone boardside and the Barrel roadside and do the reverse in the rear, Barrel boardside and cone roadside with cupped washers in all positions.  If that improves the feel, try one more thing to see if it is better or worse.  Run both cones up front and the Barrels in the rear.  If none of that works we will try different bushings

```
If you are talking those speeds, do it right the first time and build it as a split setup with a steeper front truck baseplate angle in the front and a shallower angle in the rear.  There is no good reason to run a symmetrical setup for what you are building.  Once you can defoine the angles you end up with, we can talk bushings.  As for the different series of bushings, it is all based on the height of the bushing, you want to replace what you have in your trucks with approximately the same height bushings to maintain the truck geometry.

Canons are a barrel shaped bushings that was originally designed for Paris trucks more open bushing seat, it is slightly larger in diameter than our Barrel.  Durometer is just the hardness of the urethane and it has a loose correlation to what you should use for your weight.

Hi again, I have a couple more questions before I buy. Sorry lol. My first question is what pivot cups should I get? I know the WFB 96a compound is the one to go with, but I don't know what truck to select since I'm gonna be using TB 218s. You recommend the Indy pivot cups for TB 218s in this thread, but I've also seen you recommend Caliber II pivot cups for 218s in a different thread. Which one is better? As for my second question, I feel like I left out an important piece of information when I first commented on here. While I want to reach the top speed of 35 to 40 mph occasionally, I plan on using my board mostly for cruising at 20 to 25 mph. I also think I want to go with a slightly less extreme 60/40 split. Do these two new points of data affect your previous recommendations at all? Thanks for answering all of my stupid questions :stuck_out_tongue:.

## \#562 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2018-07-10T23:20:10.217Z Reads: 119

```
TB218's take the Caliber II pivots, I would stick with the 96a.  Canons are very close dimensionally to barrels but they fit the TB 218 seat better so there is very little slop so all angulation translates into turn.  The Magnum is a big bushing that takes more force to deform than a Barrel or Canon so it is more stable when used in the boardside position.  I do not think your questions have effected my previous recommendations...To be sure, can you repeat the recommendation for the actual set up you are asking about?

Instability can come from many sources, the primary source is the rider and your position on the board.   Many  newbies drive from the "back seat" in they weight the back of the board.  You should be in the "front seat" and have more than 55% of your weight over the front truck.  Your front foot should be close to the truck mounting bolts and if possible, on the mounting bolts.  Knees bent and loose should be your standard stance.  You will need to shift your weight towards the rear once you start braking if you have a  regenerative setup. 

The next source of instability is truck geometry and design.  I would suggest a 50 degree base plate in front and a 44 in the back.  This is inherently more stable than a 50 / 50 set up and is referred to as a "split" setup.  With the split setup, the rear bushings will need to be harder or bigger to balance out the increased leverage the 44 degree base plate has over the bushings.  I have found for the TB218"s a Canon / Canon front and Canon / Magnum rear goes a long way to settle the setup down.  For your weight, KranK or APS 90a should work great.

Thank you for taking the time @alphamail , that's very helpfull info! I've been using a Onda Core for 2 years but this is my first "real truck" board  :slight_smile: so my stands shold be ok'ish.

I'm putting together a shopping cart now with the parts you recommended. Should I go with a harder bushing for the rear 44° trucks or is the Magnum a bigger bushing?  Also any need of changing pivot cup from original caliber?

This is my cart for the moment :

1. Riptide Krank Magnum bushings / 90a

2. Riptide Krank Canon bushing 2 set / 90a

3. Caliber 44° baseplate

Hi, I have a **TB 218** with **sector 9 mini daisy** deck my weight is **72kgs**, I read through this post and most of the TB 218 posts and I went with a cone, canon ( or is it canon, cone?) setup @ 95a.

But after reading some more and looking at Youtube for some videos i'm not sure I made the right choice of the duro, should I go with different duro boardside/roadside? or same?

The aim is to make my board turn easier in the city (lots of 90) without me falling of because i'm leaning too much and also be able to drive it at ~35kmh.

Hi @Alphamail , can you please give me some advice on bushings? I'm still confused on which shape, compound and duro I should choose. That's for a freeride / upcoming FWD build (so rear truck won't be loaded with motor torque). Here is my list : 

1. I use Caliber v2 9" 50°, stock Blood orange 89a bushings and pivot cup. 

2. No aftermarket bushing yet ; I plan on swapping the pivot cup for WFB 96a. Maybe gonna have to first start by mixing stock bushings with the Riptide ; later fully upgrade.

3. I look for a fluid, stable and predictive feedback from the trucks ; kinda want a stable center for higher speeds yet a fluid responsive shortturning radius ; I hate "too loose" and "too stiff" trucks.

4. A mix of freeride / city commute / DH and speeding. Yea I'm greedy haha

5. A street Vega deck (with bit extended wheelbase) and 97x52mm wheels, potential wheelbite without risers but I'll shave some wood from the deck to make deep wheel arches.

6. I weight a solid 190lbs.

Thanks by advance !

Hey @Alphamail I'm sure you have come across many similar requests for these trucks but I do quite enjoy a direct response from the man himself. I currently have two standard boards (not electric) and this summer I am trying to get into sliding and downhill longboarding. So far my experience with my stock bushings has been okay if not a little underwhelming. My goal is to have a bushing setup that I can both use for downhill runs (higher speeds) but still have a good turning radius for sliding. 
On my Landyachtz switchblade, I am running bear grizzly trucks with stock bushings (I am not sure what gen). 

I also have a loaded tesseract that has caliber trucks (the original version) and stock bushings. For this one, I would love to be able to make it possible for some sliding but I would really like some deep carving to really take advantage of the nice concave.

P.S. I weigh 155 pounds or 70 kilos

There are several things you can do to make the 95a Cone / Canon combination work for you.  Have you received them yet?  If so try several different setups.  When I list something like "Cone / Canon", that means Cone roadside (top) and Canon boardside (bottom).  It is best to have both flat and cupped washers available for the Cones and Canons for additional tuning options.  So here is what you can do with a pair of 95a Cones and Canons.

Symmetrical:  
Cone / Canon front, Cone / Canon rear
Canon / Cone front, Canon / Cone rear

Asymmetrical so the front turns easier than the rear
Canon / Cone front, Cone / Canon rear
Cone / Cone front, Canon / Canon rear
```

The first thing I would consider is dropping a 44 degree baseplate on the rear to reduce rear steering input.   The closer to zero the rear is, the more stable the setup becomes so if you want to dewedge it further, turning radius will not suffer much until you get around 25 degrees since you still have the 50 degree up front.  Stoked to see you trying a front wheel drive!  Once you decide on the angles you will end up with, I will be in a better position to recommend what bushings to try.

Thanks for the response @Alphamail, I mostly want to change the downhill board with the bear trucks. However I would like to get two possible setups for the tesseract, one that feels carvy like a surfboard but not too much considering the possibility of bite. I don't know if it's possible but maybe this would be the same setup, but it would be cool to be able to do some dancing too. That setup would be switch. The other setup would be for downhill and currently I am pretty shaky at high speeds even when I tighten the bushings so I would like high stability with predictable turning. This setup would be only in one direction. The caliber trucks are 44 degrees baseplate.

Thank you for the tips ! Well I'm converting a freestyle street deck into a kind of shlongboard with custom angled risers (dewedged rear and slight dewedge front), trying to end up with a geometry similar to Landyatchz Evo but in a sub 80cm format. 

Due to current budget, I have to stick first with the 50° baseplates front and rear but I keep in mind the 44° baseplate upgrade.

About the FWD, well I got kinda sold by a redditer and @Deckoz when I read "it gives the closest feeling to an analog DH board" ! I'll post it once it is ready to roll. (Edit : Btw it does kinda make sense to have a lighter rear IMO)

So my current truck angles would be 50° trucks, with modified angles à la Evo. What do you think would work best ?

Hi,
so Id love to get on this as well.

got tb 218 trucks and just ordered some caliber 2 44's to put the base plate on the rear.
all stock bushings so far.

Im 140lbs and have 42" skateshred drop thru deck that is top mounted right now with 1/2" risers, so no wheel bite and over all so far is fairly stable as is and just geared up to 18/36 and feel ok at top speed close to 30mph.

i like a lil speed here and there but mostly its my commuter and free ride board in nyc and i dig carving when the asphalt is nice, fresh and smooth.

current carving conditions feel like it grabs at the end of the carve right before I come back to mid line, very much reminds me of wake boarding or snowboarding when you carve kinda hard and the rail finally catches and gives a nice little spray, so guess id like it to be a bit more consistent than catching just at the very end, but fun none the less.

Hey @Alphamail, I was hoping you could give me some advice on how wedging might affect my bushing choice. I ride a Meepo conversion on an Arbor Highground, with my front truck wedged 15 degrees, and the rear dewedged the same. From what I can tell, they're basically Paris V2 clones. Right now I have it set up with barrels in the rear and barrel-cone in the front, using 88a Venom SHR bushings. I weigh 135 lb and they feel fairly loose and I have to be careful to prevent speed wobbles around 20 mph, but do not wheel bite.

I'm about to swap it onto a Landyachtz Evo with a bigger battery and plan to wedge it for the 50/30 split that deck was designed for (since I assume these Paris clones are at 50 instead of 35). At the same time, I plan to swap out the pivot cup for a Riptide 96a, and was considering getting a set of 90a Krank Canons too. Eventually I plan to swap the motors and ESC to get up to 30mph and want a setup that will keep me stable. Any thoughts?

Hello @Alphamail,

I am looking for Pivot Cups for Avenue Trucks, both TKP and RKP versions. Do you produce them or know which ones would fit ?

Thank you for being active in this forum.

Our Indy pivots fit the TKP's but we do not have a fit for the RKP.  It is really silly they did not use the same one since they are so close to each other.

Hey @Alphamail I got your pivot cups and bushings and today I'm setting them up on my trucks, but I can't get the Caliber II pivot cups to fit all the way. You said to get those, but the hanger needs to go down by a couple millimeters before the bushings will fit. Could I get some help?

All of our pivots are designed to be an interference fit with the base plate so it can be difficult to install sometimes as it requires some forse to do so.  I will often use a flat file to press against the open end of the pivot to force it into the base plate or even a vice.  These are TB 218's right?

Yes. I tried a pair of vice grips, but it didn't work. It sticks out of the pivot cup seat by about 1 or 2 mm, and when I put the hanger on the kingpin it is too high up. I tried putting on the bushings and  cranking it down, but if I look at the side profile I can see that the bottoms of both bushings aren't properly seated.

Here’s what I’ve got; 
Jet spud 29”
Surf Rodz TKP 177mm hanger with 60mm axles. Currently have stock medium (90a I believe) duro barrel/barrel
1/2” riser with kegels 
I’m 170lbs 
I have freebord bindings installed on the board so I can jump up curbs and over any obstacle I can find. Currently trying to get good at 180’s so I need to be able to ride switch as well. 
If I lean too far I get wheelbite. I have the kingpin tight enough so that it’s difficult to turn the boardside bushing with my hand. 
I think I just need stiffer bushings in general, this thing turns ridiculously sharp, anything above 10mph and it gets squirrelly. Wheelbite sucks when I don’t land a jump somewhat close to level.

Hi @Alphamail would love some advice on bushings and also a link to where i can get whatever you’ll be recommending.

1. Barrel-Barrel Caliber 2 50deg.

2. Barrel- Barrel Orangatang Nipples (Yellow - 89A) with stock pivot cups.

3. A setup for crusing at low speeds (15mph). Really difficult to turn on the current setup.

4. Crusing/ speeding from time to time.

5. Using a loaded vanguard flex 2 42" with 107mm abec 11 74A wheels.

6. 72kg (160lbs)

OK so you have SZ TKP's front and back?  If you want to keep it symmetrical, de-wedge both the front a back a couple of degrees to settle them down a bit and increase the duro or the size of the bushings you are using.  I suggest a Barrel / Chubby both front and back in KranK or APS 90a

Hey man. Recently had a pretty nasty fall and just posting to see if you can help me with my bushing set up.
The trucks I’m using are caliber fifty with their default bushings still in place.
I’m looking to mainly get a more stable ride at higher speeds (I’m getting wobbles pretty early on) and if so, make turning a little easier as I have quite a large turning circle, will I need wedges for this?
My type of skating is just cruising around and commuting.
My deck is the landyatch 9two5 and I’ve never got wheel bite so far.
I weigh about 75kg
Really appreciate the help :slight_smile:

It looks like other people had problems with the Caliber II pivot cups fitting the TB218mms. In fact, you even followed up here (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/torqueboard-50-v2-trucks-what-trucks-are-they-really/10090) saying the Indy cup fits best. I'm confused. Why did you tell me to get Caliber II pivot cups? Is there something I'm missing?

OK, just to clarify, @Freddiecook's 925 is a top mounted to a dropthrough deck.   In my mind, this may be an advantage.  When I first stated skating, I loved dropthrough boards and we even developed, as one of our first products, backing frames to reinforce the cutout (I did not like the idea of my life hanging on so little wood). As I improved, I quickly abandoned dropthrough for top mounts for several important reasons including speed, stability and more controllable and predictable slides. Turns out top mounts are better at both grip and slip plus I could stand more over the front truck with a top mount than I could with a dropthrough.reducing the chance of wobbles.  That being said, with a topmounted dropthrough deck, wedging and de-wedging are simplified.  50 degree front is steem enough so i would leave it alone and either buy a 44 degree rear Caliber base plate or de-wedge the rear a minimum of 5 degrees with 10 degrees being better such as using a 44 degree rear with a 5 degree de-wedge thus dropping the rear to 39 degrees.  Once done you will need stiffer or bigger bushings on the rear than the front due to the increased leverage you now have on the back.  This coupled with concentrating your weight more over the front truck while general riding and accelerating and keeping your knees bent and legs loose, your chances of wobs goes way down.  If you are open to making some of these changes let me know where you will end up so I can make a specific recommendation.  I can also make a recommendation if you want to keep the setup as is and we do a synthetic split setup to improve the ride and handling.

Thanks for the reply. I'll have a shop around and try and pick up a 44 base plate for the rear and look at buying a 5 degrees wedge to bring it down to the 39 degrees, when you say putting your weight further over the front truck, should I just make sure that there is a smaller gap from the front of the board to my front foot than the back of the board to my back foot? (currently i stand with my feet equidistant from the ends of the board).
After all of this what shall I do with the bushings?
The help is very appreciated :slight_smile:

Yes, standing closer to the front than the back will bias your weight towards the front plus bending the front knee more than the rear will help also.  If your stock bushings are Barrel/Barrel, start by using Cupped washers in the back and flats in the front to create a differential if Cone / Barrel, run the front Barrel / Cone and the back Cone / Barrel or Cone / Cone front with cups and Barrel / Barrel rear with cups.  If none of this works, I suggest KranK Canons up front and a Canon / Chubby rear in 90a

I can confirm this. I have the caliber II pivot cups and the hanger does not fit as low into them as the cups that comes with the tb218 trucks.

Edit: fits on one of my trucks but not the other, seems to be a difference in thickness between the two cups I got.

@Alphamail I'm 225 lbs and have 2 board, one uses Paris Trucks V2 and the other is still being built and will use Caliber IIs 50 degrees.

On the Paris Truck V2 board I've been using the stock bushings and it's very soft, I over-tightened it a lot and got used to riding it that way I can carve and turn very well, but I hear it's not good to over-tighten. 

Today I bought and tried a green venom stepped barrel (93a) + green venom cone (93a) and that setup was too tight and I couldn't even make turns. 
I tried a few combinations with the stock Paris V2 bushings and I ended at green venom stepped barrel (93a) + stock Paris V2 barrel (picture bellow) and it seems to work well tightened to 2 full rotations (I see 2 threads on the kingpin). When I carve the boards feel bouncier than before like it's trying to move me back to center, just a different sensation.

![bushings|690x388](upload://jL9O6YqPS1SvmEgfYBeiZJzzldP.jpg)

I really don't know what kind of setup I want, so if you could recommend a good starting point for 225lbs weight for both the Paris v2 setup  and the Caliber II 50 setup I would try it out.

Thank you!

@Alphamail A little update. I got the new pivot cups today (yay!) and when I installed them, I ran into the exact same problem. The canon bushings won't seat correctly because the hanger doesn't go down enough. I guess it must be the Torqueboards trucks :(.

As I said, we manufacture with an interference fit so installing pivots without the trucks being mounted is difficult if not impossible.  With the trucks mounted to the deck, do the following with the boardside bushing and washer in place.  Install the pivots and push them in as far as they will go, you can use a flat file to press them in with force.  Insert the pivot nose of the hanger and slip the hanger over the kingpin, rotate the hanger back and forth as you add pressure pushing the hanger intp the cup and add the roadside bushing and washer and kingpin nut.  Snug up the assemble continuing the rock the hanger back and forth then flip the board over and stand on the deck to further force the hanger into the pivot and tighten the kingpin nut as you go, this should seat the pivot properly.  Urethane takes a compression set so we designed these with that in mind.

@Blix, I am a little confused by your question but I will answer what I think your are asking.  I  would not wedge the front of a 50 degree Paris setup but I would dewedge the rear with a Paris 43 or an angled riser for the 50 degree plate.  If you want to keep the stock bushings try running the front cone / barrel with flat washers and the rear cone / barrel with cupped washers too compensate for the difference in base plate angles

Hey @Alphamail, quick update for my FWD board (thus need new advice too haha) 

I ditched the 9" Cal V2 and am picking a pair of 50° Paris V2 150mm at the shop by Tuesday : narrow is better! They don't have the 43° baseplate in stock though, only angled risers.

I have kinda set my choice on combo pivot WFB + APS Magnum boardside + WFB Cannon roadside front & rear.

Which durometer (front / rear and boardside / roadside)  would you recommend for me ?

Extended stock Wheelbase is 55cm. I lost some weight and am now 84.5kg. 

Also (is it important?)  : since I have to wait for shipping, I'll be riding the board analog till September. 

Thank by advance!

Hi! I realized I still need bushings optimum for my upcoming build, I also just picked up a pair of Riptide custom esk8 risers! Will be using both risers front and back

1. Brand of Truck - Torqueboard 218mm Trucks

2. No bushings installed

3, I'm looking for stable but still carvy experience. not too loose as it makes it less ideal when cruising further distances.

4. I want to use it as a sort of all around setup, good for carving but something I can still cruise to take me from A to B but no serious downhill uses.

5. Hummie Deck. Shouldn't have wheel bite, going to be using 6.5" pneumatics on these, tested for no wheel bite on similar sized wheels

6. Weighing 102kg

hope that provides all the info needed. I am stilll getting my parts together but the trucks are what I will be using as I've already committed to a gear drive that uses mounts for the TB218 trucks. Thanks!

Below is a PM that I think is relevant here, my answers are in **BOLD**

I would appreciate some recommendations for my bushings and pivot cups and especially the difference how let`s say mangum and canon bushings feel for example.

Vanguard 38" non electric:
Trucks: Paris v1 180mm 50°
Bushings: 90a divine barrel/cone with cups

I have a very bad turning radius because i think my bushings are to hard for my weight, but the force i feel to turn is still too soft for me and not stable at speeds. So i need a more controlled turn, maybe progressive.
I have propably overtightened my bushings as well for faster rides…Is that why they feel so light in turns if I loosen them up for carving?

I will use this build for 10-15mph rides, maybe 20mph but definetly not above that.
I would like to have a nice rebound that is pushing me from carve to carve.

**I would suggest Canons all around in 87a and have cupped washers and flats available to further tune the setup to your liking. Run the sharp edge of the bushing towards the hanger for the most stable setup**

Hummie 40" electric:
Trucks: Paris v2 195mm 50°
Bushings: 90a divine barrel/barrel cup/flat

I don`t have this setup yet…
But I have already ordered some tunnel risers and want to order everything together and not waste a lot of shipping to europe with separated orders…

I was looking for a very stable ride with this E-Board.
Canon or Magnum possibly mixed and 87a or 90a krank
Rebound is important for me, I like the feel of getting pushed back to center if i do quick impulsive turns.
But the focus is on high speed stability with this build.

Could you tell me the differences I would experience with
Magnum/Canon vs Canon/Canon vs Magnum/Magnum

**I suggest having a variety available in KranK 87 and 90 so you do not need to reorder. Say a couple of pairs of Canons and a pair of Magnums per durometer. You will find something that works great with several combinations that you need to try yourself. Common combinations are as follows with the top bushing / the bottom bushing: Front Canon / Canon, rear Canon / Magnum + Front Canon / Magnum, rear Canon / Magnum + Front Canon / Canon, rear Magnum / Magnum. I strongly suggest dropping the rear baseplate angle to 43 or lower to increase stability**

I weigh 58kg so propably 87a but 90a is more stable, I can`t decide it…

I shouldn`t get any wheelbite with 83mm wheels on the hummie deck and 70mm on the vanguard…

Softer Pivot Cups equal to what?
Like a little bit of wiggle without actuatlly turning?
I don’t get them.
I will propably take 95a or 96a… but for lightweight riders you said 90a could be good… ah why can’t i just decide it. :confounded:

**Stick with the 96a, we have the longest history and the best overall performance with that duro so you can’t go wrong**
```

```
For an advanced rider with a lot of bushing experience, mixing duro and compound is fine.  Do you fit into that category?  Otherwise, it is best to stick with the compound most to hit the sweet spot all the same durometer and differentiate the requirements with the shapes of the bushings in the different positions!  The reason I ask is in order of adjustability from low to high (response to kingpin nut clamping pressure), our compounds go WFB, APS then KranK with the highest adjustability

With your weight and the height of your setup plus pneumatics, I think you will need the KranK 96a Canons and Magnums front and rear.  If you dewedge the rear a bit, you stability will go up and if you do run the front Canon / Magnum and the rear Magnum / Magnum

just to clarify, that much leverage you describe is if I use it with the 93a? I'll probably give the wedge kit a go after I get a better feel with the bushings but will definitely still consider them!

I have A Raptor2.  The ride is too stiff. Turning radius is way too large.

I weigh 150 lbs w/pack and pads.

I just don't feel the "rebound" everyone talks about. I can lean and turn a wide corner, but if it weren't for the kicktail, I'd have a hard time navigating paths or small  streets.

I just need some more give in the trucks. 

Thanks for al this help.

Alright. I Want to know how magnums work compared to chubby bushings? So having the bushing not sit completely flush in the bushing seat is fine and won’t cause any problems for wobbles or anything?

Also what pivot cup would you recommend to go with the TorqueBoard 218mm Full stock trucks?

Awesome. I'll inform Tracey to add in the Caliber II pivots. Just to be sure that would be these?
http://www.riptidesports.com/wfb-96a-pivot-cup-choices/ for the caliber II cast option? should they also be the same 96a as well?

I've already received the invoice with the 2 sets of Krank canon 96a and single magnum bushing 96a. Just waiting for Tracey's response on adding in the pivot cups too
Also think its nice for you and Tracey to offer free shipping for any additional orders with the tunnel risers so I’m going to be checking out the risers with the bushings and pivot cups together! :blush:

If so, TB would have had to send them with the 180 baseplates as this is the only truck I got from them. So I do not think so, without knowing how the 180 baseplates looks like. I could send them, but, since I am located in Norway, it may be a hassle.

So, these are pictures from last time i tried fitting them, I have 2 sets of cups, only one cup was close to a decent fit:

Hello, 

I am on caliber 2 44’s, 180mm width. Running stock blood orange 89a barrels, truck feels very loose and hard to control at speed no mater how much weight I put on front. I am on a landyachtz Evo falcon, half inch riser, 97mm flywheels, I get some wheel bite in the front when I try to u turn in narrowish subdivison streets. I weigh around 200. 

I’m not exactly sure what I want, so I was thinking maybe a variety or a starting point and going from there. Thank you!

Hey @Brdchris do you know what the functional baseplate angles are when mounted to the deck?  I cannot find the specs on the Falcon, they just say wedged and dewedged.  Most likely the problem is with stock bushings all around, the rear truck is easier to turn than the front since the rear has so much more leverage over the trucks due to the dewedging.  This is the opposite of what you want.  The front should be easier to turn than the rear to balance out the system.
```

## \#656 Posted by: Brdchris Posted at: 2018-08-15T17:16:24.365Z Reads: 88

I think it’s 15 degrees wedge up front and 15 dewedge our back on 45 degree baseplate. So that would be 60/30 right? 

I’ve read you talk about that before earlier in this thread, should I do harder/larger bushings out back or change my wedge?

It does have a funny forklift feel to me, I don’t mind it so much but it’s definetly there. Also mind you I’m new to this. That’s why I’m not exactly sure what I want out of the board yet.

## \#657 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2018-08-15T17:30:30.318Z Reads: 86

If it is 15 degrees than you are ending up at 59/29 which is fine with the right bushing setup, do you have any cone bushings of the same durometer laying around as the Blood Orange to do some testing with?  Or perhaps some harder or larger bushings to replace the rear with?  Bottom line is you need to boost the shape or durometer of the rear bushings to resist the enhanced leverage there.

Before you buy anything, throw at least one of those in the rear to see the effect.  Start with the rear boardside bushing.  If the feel improves add the second one so we can see if that is overkill.

I had 0 issues with the krank magnum nor the pivot cups. They are not perfectly flush with the top of the baseplate but maybe .5 mm higher. 

This is ofc a TB 218mm truck. As far as  Im aware my 2nd set is identical tho I haven't installed the new pivots there yet. 

PS anyway to get those suckers out without destroying them in the process?

Hey @gigoy, there are a couple of things you can do.  I took a quick look at the Wheel lift thread and yes, you have well exceeded the recommended compression of virtually any bushing on the market.

If you have read any of this thread you understand that symmetrical setups are inherently less stable than split setups.  Are you open to changing your rear truck by dewedging it or replacing the rear base plate with a Caliber 44?

[/quote]
An angled riser for the rear truck to change angle from 50 to 45. It does the same job as different base plate. You can cut this from a piece of wood with a saw or some thick plastic maybe. (-10deg might be easier to cut by hand) 3D print. Or local skate shop might have them if they deal lots of long board stuff. 

If you have both cupped washers and flat washers, run cupped washers in the rear and flat in the front for less rear steering relative to the front. 

Run the rear truck a little tighter than the front. But dont go crazy. 

You can strengthen your ankle and calf muscles to give more control. I dont know the best way to do this apart from time on the board but if you have the trucks really loose it forces you to control your feet more. So maybe run the trucks really loose and ride around at slow speed till your muscles hurt. Repeat until you have that sweet muscle memory and tone. 

When going at high speed put more weight over the front truck then the rear.
```

Since I think your bushings are shot, I suggest replacing then with something more suitable for your weight.  At 105 KG, I suggest KranK 96a Canons or Barrels in the front and a Barrel or Canon / Chubby rear with the Chubby on the bottom (boardside).  This set up will simulate a split setup and will also work on an actual split setup.  Tune with flat and cupped washers.  With RipTide, the starting point for compression is tight enough to remove all the slop out of the stack and you can still turn the top bushing by hand with some effort.  With KranK, from that point you have two full turns of adjustment at your disposal so a max of 2 threads showing.  If you need to go further, you need harder or bigger bushings in more positions

hi @Alphamail, thanks in advance for the help.

- TB 218mm trucks cone\barrel stock bushings (unknown durometer). they are really hard to turn for me, im 130lbs and if i make them loose they get super unstable also i dont feel like they come to center.

- i want a stable ride (30-35 mph). if it affect the turning radius im wiiling to give up some of that. awful roads where i ride thus the wanted stability in case of a big crack on the road or something like that. setup mostly for commuting to work when weather is favorable and nice group rides on weekends.

-using evo 39 with 1\2" risers and @psychotiller six shooters pnummies, no wheel bite.

-again 130lbs with nothing but helmet knee and elbow pads.

Hey @Dazeto, as a starting point take both Barrels and put them on the back truck and run both cones up front.  You are currently running a symmetrical bushing setup on an asymmetrical board.  The rear has a lot more leverage over the trucks than the front so you need to compensate for for the base plate differential.  Try that first then report back and use cupped washers all around and when you make any changes such as this, be aware of wheel bite!

Several issues depending on what SZ RKP's you are referring to but mainly the bushing seat designs being different from each other top and bottom plus they will not accept the very popular Chubby shape as well as other iterations.  I could go on and on but it won't make much difference.

It's easy to get bogged down in choices, all I can tell you definitely is that SR trucks do not leave me disappointed where Caliber II and Paris V2 trucks leave me wanting more. Obviously SR trucks are more expensive than those but they are the most inexpensive precision truck available. 

Ronin's fall into a different class as they are constructed using a different geometry and bushing setup.  TB 218's are every but as good as Caliber II trucks, assuming you swap out bushings as I'd do on C2's as well.

Sure, it's been a long day so I can't remember all 3 buy I'll post the 2 that aren't with me in the next couple of days. 

On my latest build I'm running 90mm popocas on SR TKP's with the following bushing combo...

Front Road side = APS 97.5a
Front Board side = Krank 96a
Rear Road side = Krank 96a
Rear Board side = APS 95a
Cupped washers board and road side on front and back

I'm almost 200lbs so I need a former bushing. I'm experimenting with the 95a roadside in the rear, not sure I'm happy with it. The idea was softer should eat up some vibration as I'm running 4mm risers. I'm thinking I'll go with an APS 97.5a instead but I'd love your advice.

I am using all barrels.  Typically I don't use cones other than short push decks, even a push longboard usually gets double barrels with me.

I really don't have a reason other than it fells more natural and the return response is better.

Hey @Alphamail I am currently building an mtb using the MBS ATS trucks on the Atom 90 deck. I'm looking for a medium setup that's good for turning and stable up to at least 25mph. I weigh just under 160lbs. What would you recommend?

Want to ask if you guys are using this for an ATB build? @anorak234

Looking for good trucks when I’m expecting abit more dirt and offroad which i feel caliber style aren’t ideal for(could be wrong) and want to know if there’s a different bushing setup for that application

Yes, I'm using the trucks for an AT build.

I decided to go with these both for the price and because I like the idea that an mtb can have the same type of bushing/baseplate setup as any other longboard.

Ok @kalebludlow sorry for the delay, we had some equipment rebuild issues this last week...  I will recommend based on what is not what will be (Randal rear, deck and your eating habits).

I am going to recommend a symmetrical and asymmetrical (synthetic split) setup that will work work well if you decide to dewedge the rear truck also.  I suggest you pick up a pair of KranK 87a Canons and a pair of KranK 87a Magnums and try several different setups with them to see what you like the most.

Symmetrical (Roadside / Boardside) 
Canon / Magnum front and rear
Magnum / Canon front and rear

Asymmetrical (Roadside / Boardside) 
Canon / Canon front, Magnum / Magnum rear
Magnum / Canon front,  Canon / Magnum rear

OK @anorak234, thanks.  So the top (road.side) bushing is our Street height and the bottom (boardside) bushing is our longboard height.  Looking at the base plate, unfortunately they designed in a recess which limits your bushing and washer shape choices.  You might be able to circumvent the recess with the large flat washers we ship with the Chubby and FatCone but you might need to go with the Street height in that position also to compensate for the lost height.  I suggest riding the setup with stock bushings first to see if there are any shortcomings and if there are, we will have a baseline to know what direction we want to go.

@Alphamail, RE SR RKP's.  I ordered a selection of bushing so I could try out some softer duros that I had and harder duros I was out of.  I ended up using the hard duros   This is what I ended up going with.

	Board Side Rear : 96 Cannon
	Street SIde Rear : 93 Chubby
	Board Side Front : 96 Barrel
	Street SIde Front : 93 Barrel

The effect is still not as carvey as I would like, but they are RKP's.  Its plenty stable and comfortable, has plenty of push back on lean and no slop.  I think this essentially what @Sender is running as well on his RKP's.  Do you see anyway to improve on this setup?
```

I am rocking 
Rear:
96a Fat cone board side (with the included fat flat washer)
93a cannon road side (with cupped washer)

Front:
93a Fat cone board side (with the included fat flat washer)
90a cannon road side (with cupped washer)

I also have those Surf Keyz in there which do make them a bit turnier... aka more response earlier on in the turn.  It juat sucks paying like $20 for two bits of nothing, lol.

I believe I am running essentially 50degrees in the back and 55 in the front IIRC, but it is not exact because of the combination of it being the Adjustable RKP baseplates with the 30degree kicks on the Lacroix deck.


Edit: Fatcones not chubbies

@mmaner and @Sender how on earth did you fit a Chubby street side or boardside in Surf Rodz RKP's?  If you are using cupped washers on the Barrels, change to flats for more freedom, you can also do the same with the larger bushing, replacing the large flat washer for a smaller one.

@Alphamail, I'm looking for some advice on bushing setup. I don't have all the parts yet for my new build but I plan to run 50 degree Caliber 2 base plates with TB 218 hangars on a landyachtz evo. I weigh 130 but always carry about 10 pounds of stuff in a book bag plus gear. I usually hit about 27-30 on my board however I tend to cruise around 20-25 while carving. I'd like to run a setup that's right in the middle between loose and stiff.

Hi Brad,
I just got a set of surf rodz RKPs.
I measured the stock bushing length and it is 1mm taller compared to the riptide WFB barrels I have.
If I put in the riptide barrels it changes the truck geometry. I can of course use 1mm washers to take up the slack.
Is there any riptide bushing that has the same length as the stock bushings?
```

@ThermalChild I would suggest going with a pair of Canon's up front and a a Canon / Magnum rear in KranK 87a so order 2 pairs of the Canons and 1 pair of the Magnums so if you prefer a Canon / Canon front and a Magnum / Magnum rear you can do that also

@taz from my measurements, the SZ stock bushings are 0.5mm taller which represents a difference of .75 degrees over a 1.5" distance from the pivot ball center to the king pin center which is a nominal difference.  We worked with SZ to come up with the FatCone shape and our stock height was never an issue.  What I am saying is our stock height works great in them and the other variables such as washer thickness can alter geometry more than 0.5mm bushing height.  In general SZ trucks could benefit from a reduction in base plate angle even the 0.75 degrees this height difference represents.
```

Maybe the difference is due to the fact that the riptide bushings I have are used whereas the stock SZ bushings are new.

I just got my Raptor 2 and I want it to have more turning capability, I tried to loose the kingpin nut but all I got was rattling between the nut and washer, almost no increase in turning.

What RipTide bushings do you suggest for these trucks?
[/quote]

What did you end up doing on your Raptor set up here @Eboosted Trying to dial in my R2 as we speak and was curious what you ended up doing on both bushings and pivot cups (which ones fit)

Brad @Alphamail I was hoping to get your input on my set up too and what you think would be best. Always have loved and use Riptide and currently have your bushings (the same front/back which I'm reading is not ideal right? It's double barrel 93A B/S and 91A R/S with cup washers on top and bottom on the TB 218mm trucks with 97mm Abec's) and I also run your tunnel risers on my DIY set up too. (& Stickers on my helmet, board, and iPhone case). Currently, my carving/turning isn't great and would like a tad more on my new set up but i like how stable I am. I like having more stability though cause I am always riding full speed 25-35mph. Anyway, see below for additional info you asked for and get back to me whenever you have a chance. I greatly appreciate it in advance!

I Weigh 195 lbs
Deck I'm setting up with my raptor 2 trucks & motors is the Moonshine outlaw 
I've never switched my pivot cups but would like to
The other info you asked for is all above I believe but lmk if you need anything else.

Hey @Alphamail I would appreciate some help.
Just finished my board yesterday so still getting used to it, but I have stock Caliber II 44's front and rear on 83mm wheels. I have a 16" wheelbase so turning should be ok no matter what I think but around 10mph I start to get some wobbles. I tightened up the bushings pretty far so where they're almost bulging out, but it still feels too loose for me. Should I upgrade the bushings or just keep tightening the trucks? I also have 3/16" spacers and no wheel bite on full tilt, I have more spacers I can add if needed. 
I'm about 170lbs and don't really plan on going over 20mph since I'll be riding on campus 90% of the time just to get between classes. 
Thanks

@Jellybean as you may already realize, tightening some bushings has little effect besides ruining them so tighten  no more...A 16" WB is very short so your weight distribution is critical to performance.  At 170, using 44's I am surprised you are experiencing wobs at 10 mph, you may want to check truck alignment to be sure the board is tracking properly.  A bent hanger can also contribute.  If the Calibers are setup with a cone / barrel set up, at minimum you should move up to barrels all around or a larger combination.  Can you tell me what shaped bushings came in the 44's?  I have seen them two different ways.  Also, how wide is your deck?

I am trying my best to keep my weight forward, I'm used to pushing a 44" deck so there's still some learning for me with this short deck. 10mph is a guess, I just know I'm not going faster than if I pushed. I will check the alignment, just make sure the trucks are straight and parallel? They have barrels on both sides with the stock 89a bushings. The deck is 9" at it's widest, 8.25" at the thinnest point.

Any update here fellas.....? @Eboosted @Alphamail 

I am trying to buy a few things and the discount/credit I have for a store that sells all things riptide plus some other items I want runs out today at midnight so was curious if either (or both) of you could confirm what size/shape Riptide bushings and pivot cups will fit on the raptor 2 trucks.... planning on buying things today and just trying to avoid buying a shape that won't end up fitting that's too big/small.... pivot cups do the indy ones work or a different one? I know barrels will work, what about cannons, chubbies, cones, fat cones, etc?

Also, do you guys or does anyone else know if we can swap the R2 base plates out with any others.... say a caliber II or some other truck? Or is it a new shape just exclusive to Enertion only? Trying to de-wedge the back without having to use angled risers if possible…?

Thanks in advance.

I will say that I used to buy in bulk from them and there attention to detail was always somewhat lacking when I would specifically state no knots on top or bottom veneer as I do woodburned designs.  One time they sent me a deck that was warped and I questioned them on it and sent them pictures with a level/rule and everything and they still denied it was warped.  So I stopped using them because they had messed up my orders and other issues.

Hey man, well, to be honest, I only changed the bushings from my Raptor 2 with the OE from Caliber II, the red soft ones, but even though, I didn't get any major improvement in turning capability.

The Raptor 2 trucks were designed for high and to avoid speed woobles, so if you want a more carvy eboard you will need to change the trucks and that's almost impossible

Hey @Jansen you have the following:   
> I Weigh 195 lbs

I would start out changing your washer setups to see if it makes enough difference to get away with using what you have.  Take the Cupped washer(s) off the front and replace with flat washers but leave the cupped washers on the back.  If you want to go a bit further, replace the rear roadside cupped washer with a flat also and let me know what if feels like.

The Raptor 2 trucks I saw over the weekend take our standard .6" tall bushings so we can go there if needed.  Based on the bushing seat, the trucks can fit our Cones, barrels, Canons but I do not think the FatCone, Magnum or Chubby will work due to the deep seat.

Ass for the Raptor 2 pivot, I will need accurate dimensions to determine what might fit!  Can you provide?

Hi @spesh first things first,  50 degree trucks are not geared towards stability, so you will need to do something to counter their tendency to turn a lot.  You can dewedge the rear or replace the rear base plate with a Caliber 44 degree base plate of if you want to keep it symmetrical, replace both base plates with 44's or dewedge both the front and back 5 to 10 degrees to get the trucks to settle down a bit.  Is this a eSk8 or a non electric setup?

  - Stock Caliber Bushings
- Feel/Want
  - Trucks feel way loose, 
  - Like to tighten up the ride a bit and hopefully avoid wheelbite.
- Skating
  - Mostly cruising/commuting around at 10-20mph
- Deck / Wheels
  - Subsonic Shadow 37 / ABEC 11 90mm Reflys
  - Currently can turn hard enough to induce wheelbite
- Weight
  - 210lb when cruising / 225 when commuting
```

After reading through a bunch of replies... My amateur guesstimation is:
Front: 96a Krank Canon
Rear: 96a Krank Canon/Chubby

Thanks for all the knowledge bombs you've dropped in the thread!

OK @finges, the reason I ask is I am learning that my recommendation can be different for powered boards versus non powered and weather they have 1, 2 or 4 drive wheels so please bear with me.  You have supplied more than most but could you give me an idea of how many wheels are driven?   The more eSk8 setups I ride, the more i understand the dynamics of how the drive systems influence the handling.  The deck and rider are a "system" if they are to be in unison and work together I need to know all thee factors involved.

I was just wondering, what is your opinion of Avenue Suspension Trucks?

Also could recommend a set of trucks, bushings and pivot cups for a Subsonic Talon 37"? I'd love to have stable 30mph while having a short turning radius. I weight 50kg/110lbs

Lastly i would like to thank you for taking your time to answer all these questions, seems you have helped a ton of people out!

OK, I weigh about 200 and normally use 90a KranK, I think 96 will be way too stiff for you since you are going up both in durometer and shape.  I would suggest Canon / FatCone front and a Canon / Chubby rear no harder than 93a  You could likely get away with 90a but since you are at 38 in the back, I think you will be happier with the KranK 93a or APS 92.5a.  If you order from us we can mix the FatCone and Chubby in one package if you don't want to buy all three shapes if you don't want to or if $ is tight.  This is one of my favorite combinations for split setups.

OK @iTzDiego, I have only ridden the Avenue trucks on a non powered board and they were not my favorite for the skating that I do.  They do not seem to respond well to wedging and dewedging and I found sliding on them to be choppy so I rarely use them.  In an eSk8 application, they may be fine but they are an unknown for me.  Since the deck you have chosen is already wedged and dewedged 12 degrees, you have a lot to pick from but I am sure your choices are limited since you need to adapt a drive system to them.  Do you plan on doing that yourself or use a truck already ready to mount a DD system to?

1. Caliber 50s  184mm/10" with a Randal 35° baseplate on the back, with the rocker on the board it's: 53.5° front, 38.5° back.

2. Still running stock bushings. Cone roadside, barrel boardside. 89a, I believe, with cupped bushing washers.

3. I currently have no stability issues at 24 kph/15mph, but am planning on doubling that speed. I'm looking for something that will be stable/safe at that speed. 

4. Mostly commuting.

5. Loaded cantellated tesseract. With 1/2" risers and diy wheel wells, wheel bite isn't an issue. I'm using 85mm Orangatang Caguama wheels

6. 74kg/163lbs. ~77kg/170lbs. with my backpack. 

I don't have the electronics on the board yet, but am looking to get ready for when they come in. I also want to thank you for what your doing on this forum.

EDIT: It will be a dual rear drive.

@Alphamail
Alright, I've got another one for you if you don't mind. I figured I should probably get some good bushings for my push board while I'm ordering anyways. 
I'm ~170lbs, 6'4". 
Deck is custom made, non-powered, 44" long, 10" wide. 
76mm wheels (no chance of wheel bite), 183mm Gullwing Pro reverse kingpin trucks 47°. Double barrel 89A bushings from RAD all around, just a flat washer. 
I have them super compressed for stability downhill so turning radius is bigger than a bus. 
I'd like to be able to turn a little sharper while still having some decent stability when going a little downhill. 
Thanks again!

First of all @AToasterOfDoom, your build choices sound great and we would be stoked to be a part of it!  A 16 degree split definitely commands different bushings front and back.  There several ways to do this depending on what the desired end result is.  I often like to work with the shapes of bushings to achieve the results i am looking for so here are some options
1).  Cone / Canon front, Canon / Conon rear. (Divey and nimble, a lively and setup.  With experience, high speeds can be achieved)
2).  Canon / Canon front, Canon / Chubby rear. (still very maneuverable but can run at quite high speeds also due to the replacement of he roadside Cone in front) 
3).  Canon / FatCone front, Canon / Chubby rear (still very maneuverable but can run at quite high speeds also with the added characteristic of having the front truck resistance more progressive than a Canon / Canon set which is more linear.  Also it will return to center a little faster with the FatCone up front boardside)

For your weight and deck width choice, KranK or APS 90a for option 1 and KranK 87a or APS 87.5a for option 2 and 3 due to thee supportive nature of the larger shapes in the mix.
```

Hay @Jellybean I am bit surprised that at your weight, 89a bushings and 47 degrees, you need to crank them down as much as you describe.  10" on the deck will definitely give you some additional leverage.  47 degree symmetrical setups can be run at high speeds with skill and experience so I suggest a more stable shape combination such as a Barrel /Chubby front and back close to the same duro as the stock.  My choice would be KranK 90a since it is a bit more tunable than APS 90a but both are fun.  KranK also has a bit more rebound than APS.

Hey @Alphamail! I was directed your way for some bushing recommendations. I'll be basing some of my answers off of what I currently ride, but the bushings I will be buying is meant for a new build.

1. SurfRodz TKP Trucks; base plate angle 50 (I think), hanger width 177mm. I'm ordering them from Psychotiller.
1. Currently using orangatang nipples, medium, cylinder.
1. Right now I'm stable with my current set up when going 10mph or so, once I start going pass that I do feel a little wobble (but part of me is sure it's the way I'm standing as well). For my build I would like to keep the stability. 
1. I'm more of a cruiser, but want to test out speed (limiting myself under 20mph).
1. Red Embers Caldera. I believe there shouldn't be any wheel bite.
1. I'm currently at 218lbs, but I am slowly losing weight.

Hi @TheAwkwardLlama please confirm the truck choice as it will make a big difference in what I recommend.  TKP's normally do not exceed 15 degrees or so since the king pin axis and pivot axis are not perpendicular to each other.

I found one site that reviewed it and they stated that its 45 degrees. When I compare it to other TKPs it looks like matches the ones stating 10-15 degrees. Right now I'm asking the place I'll be purchasing it from and awaiting their answer.

OK @TheAwkwardLlama, once again sorry about the delay, I had a lot of production and projects to contend with this last week.  When you get down to it, I cannot make make an informed recommendation without your input on how the build feels.  Once the build is complete, ride it with the stock bushing to determine if and what the issues are.   It may be just right for you and I will have nothing to offer, in other words, if it is not broken, i can't fix it.  So once the build is complete, let me know what you find

Thanks @Alphamail in advance. I'm trying to get optimal setup for more stability at high speed. was getting some wobble doing maybe 25-30 mph downhill and afraid to push the throttle. gonna need to upgrade bushing. 

1. 195mm Paris 50 degree front. In the back it is the same baseplate but with hummie's custom hanger.

2. Using paris cone/barrel front with the small cup washer on the cone, stock barrel/barrel back with big cup washer on outside barrel
3. Honestly It feels great for carving but I need more stability at speed. I was experiencing some speed wobble going 25+mph, would like to go 35 without any wobble.
4. stable at 35mph but still able to carve on the street. idk if thats possible.
5. Im using hummie hub which has the same width contact pad as a centrax. trucks mounted drop through on hummie wood carbon deck. currently if I the wheels rubs but not bite when i put my whole weight on one side.
6. 150lb

did a little bit of research. I think I should get the 93a pivot cup on both, cone/magnum front, canon/magnum back. Will probably go for the Krank but not sure which duro to choose and what rake config on both hanger. I know i probably should go for a synthetic split

Thought this was a fun thread so I'll throw in my setup. I currently like my setup pretty well but my best description is I want a stable back to help with speed wobbles because I definitely go 35 or 40 at times, but want to be able to turn and carve from the front a bit still. 

218mm Torqueboards trucks on a fixed motor mount with dual 6374's. 1/4 inch riser on the trucks for the motor mount to avoid motor bite on the deck. Bustin Maestro thermoglass 2017 deck.

Venom barrel bushings 93a and 90 on the back, 90 and 87a on the front for that extra bit of turn/carve. 

I weigh about 135.

OK @Winfly, there are couple of things.  A synthetic split will never be as effective as an actual split so keep that in mind when pushing the speed.  Second, i am unfamiliar with the bushing seat design on your custom rear hanger so I cannot confirm if a Magnum will work well there but it might.  If you could draw up some specs, I might be able to tell but it looks like you can use Cones, Barrels, Canons and FatCones with Magnums and Chubbys, unknown.  As for the pivot, stick with the our Paris 96a WFB pivot.  For the front, the Cone / Magnum Might be a bit too much unless you go for a softer uro than stock like KranK 87a, If you keep the same shape as stock, use KranK 90a Cone / Canon. Like I said above I will need additional info if you want to go for a Magnum or Chubby in the rear truck.

Hey @Lunasi 35 to 40 is really considered Downhill speeds and from the Bustin website, the deck is not well rated for those speeds so it is rated 3 out of 10.:

![01|690x388](upload://gB3AZ0MUx8Ce99ysgBdKDhPMqPR.jpeg)  

Since you are on barrels currently, I think you might enjoy trying some new shapes in the TB218's such as KranK 90a Canon / Canon front and a Canon / Magnum rear.  If you want a direct match just different compound choose KranK Canon 87a / 90 front and KranK Canon 90 / 93 rear.

Thank you for the suggestion, I think you might have a different view of the deck though based on the current Maestro model. The 2017 thermoglass is a significantly stiffer deck and was designed as an all around deck as well as for some downhill. The current models with e-core are flexier and made for pushing/freeride more, whereas the 2017 thermo maestro is a lot more versatile.

@Alphamail hey, @moone recommended you to give me some advice on bushes for my new eboard build.. I will be running torque board trucks in a street set up with 6374’s dual so should be pushing 60km/h. I’m 110kg and am looking to have the board stable at high speed runs while still having a bit of movement to manage some light carving. Should I be swapping out the bushes for something more stiff? I haven’t got the trucks delivered yet hoping they will arrive next week.  

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give.

Hey @Balth81, I suggest riding it first to find what issues there are since stocks bushings are sometimes perfect for some riders.  You may want to take some of the steering out of the back truck if you are looking to do 60 kph.  A 50 degree symmetrical setup can be very challenging at speed.  At 110 kg I think you will definitely need to increase both the durometer and size of your bushings to make it work.  Are you open to reducing the rear base plate angle?

If the front turns the same as the back, the setup is very agile and maneuverable at slow speeds and is great for doing slides, pendys etc a higher speeds with the proper skill set.  If you are looking for stability and to reduce the chance of speed wobbles, reducing the truck angle in the back is the fastest way to get there.

I have now ridden the standard bushes they are ok for carving when cranked up tight.. I am thinking need something more solid for my weight.. I am not opposed to Changing the truck angle but for now I would love some stiffer bushes.. got any suggestions?

OK @Balth81 reducing the rear base plate angle goes a long way to stabilize almost any setup because you are reducing the rear steering input .  Cars are extremely stable and steer only from the front.  If the front is 50 degrees, you have a lot of steering so you can reduce the rear quite a bit and still have an agile and carvy setup.  My recommendation hinges on what you decide to do since a lower degree base plate or one that is de-wedged (as the kingpin nears vertical it approaches 0 degrees) needs bigger or harder bushings to compensate for the increased leverage a lower degree base plate angle puts on the bushings.  If you want to leave the setup as it is (symmetrical 50 degrees) 60 kph will be very difficult to achieve unless you have a tremendous amount of experience an skill.

First: Thanks a lot for offering this service! I don't know anything about how bushings work and what to look for when buying them. Thanks a lot!


1. The brand of truck you are using plus the base plate angles and hanger width. If it is a clone, I need the bushing Outside Diameter, Inside Diameter height to the .1" or .1 mm, and shape (normally a Cone/Cone, Cone/Barrel or Barrel/Barrel for stock set ups).
 - I have the TB 218mm trucks. I have not changed anything on them so it's the stock bushings, base plate angles etc.


2. If you are using aftermarket bushings, I need the bushing brand, duro and shape that are in the trucks currently.
 - I have the stock bushings.


3. I need to know how the trucks feel and what you want to change: Do you want it looser, tighter, more stable, less stable, more rebound, less rebound, etc…

- Right now it's okay for turning at low speeds, but when going 20mph, the board turns really easy and I have to stay very still and absorb all vibrations to have a nice and safe ride.
I wanna be able to make sharp turns at low speeds and not be able to turn the easy when riding fast. I guess that means I want it to be stable at high speeds and looser at low speeds
Haven't noticed any rebound, so I think it would be nice to have some of it, when cruising, making sharp turns and maybe carving a bit.


4. Type of skating you want to use the setup for.
 - Electric skateboard. For both cruising (15 mph) and speeding (20-25 mph). 


5. Deck you are using and how likely the set up will wheel bite.
 - I use the Bustin Royce Pro. I haven't got any wheel bits yet and dosen't look like I will be getting any.


6. How much you weigh.
 - I weight 139 lbs

OK @legend27, you have several options.  If you want to keep the trucks at the same angle as stock and run symmetrical, pick up some KranK or APS Canons in 87 or 87.5 and use flat washers up front and cupped washers in the rear.  either should get you where you want to be.  KranK has a bit more compression adjustment than APS so more versatile.  Start with the  trucks just tight enough to take out all the rattle then adjust tightness from there

My default is KranK but a lot of people prefer APS so trying both will allow you to decide for yourself.  I do not like to mix compounds for mental health reasons.  I already have 3 compounds, a wide range of durometers and shapes to work with and keep track of.  If I threw mixing compounds into the mix, I think I might go more insane than I am already...

In most cases, same here but you can find some great setups by experimenting.  Say you have one pair of Canons and one pair of Magnums, I have set them up in the following ways:

Front:  Canon / Canon, Rear:  Magnum / Magnum
Front   Magnum / Canon, Rear:  Canon / Magnum

OK as it is right now, the rear has much more leverage over the bushings at 42 degrees than the front has at 50 degrees the rear is currently easier to turn than the front.  This Is not what you want, you need the reverse where the resistance in the front is less than the rear.  To accomplish that I suggest the following combination  Pick up 2 pair of RipTide Canon bushings and one pair of Magnums in KranK 90a.  Having the three pair will provide a lot of options to balance out the board to your liking.  Combinations to balance out the 8 degree split: 

Canon / Canon front using flat washers and Canon / Canon rear with cupped washers
Magnum / Canon front, Canon / Magnum rear.
Canon / Canon front and Canon / Magnum rear
Canon / Canon front and Magnum / Magnum rear

@Alphamail I'm currently running krank 96a bushing on TB 218 with piviot cups. I'm running the same setup on both fronts and back. Cannon on Street side and magnum on board side. With flat washer boardside and cuped washer streetside 

The board is incredibly stable at 30mph, how it is not very carvy or turny even with my 200lb fat self. I ordered some 90a magnum bushings to make it better but what would you recommend for me?

40" board, 8 ply so flexible

Evolve GT supercarve trucks and OEM orange bushings (95a)

I'm 80 - 83kg weight, higher end of that after Christmas 

Top speed 30 to 35km/h

Average speed 20 to 25km/h

Looking to have a setup that is acceptably stable at top speed but pliable at slower speeds for tight footpath turns for commuting.

Hi I also would like some help if possible. I have a Jet invasion series deck with a half inch drop, TB trucks with caliber baseplates, I have 44 and 50 baseplates with riptide cups. I weight around 68kg. My board is neither  stable at 40kmh+ neither has a good turning radius. The turning radius ir really bad.  At the moment i run Venom 96a road side in both, riptide WTB tall cone 95a in the rear board side and blood orange 93 in the front board side. I would like to have a bit of turning radius, but have a bit more stabilaty, the board is not very wobly, but enough to make me reduce the speed. Is it possible to make a quick turning front, with a fast rebound, and make the back laggy? Or is this not I want to have?

You have to hard of bushings for your size you should be down in the 80's if you do a 85 or 90 chubby bs and a 80 or 85 barrel rs you would probably see a more stable and more rebound ride. But I would definitely wait to talk to brad before you order.

@Komamtb How did you fit a TallCone into that setup? Since you have such a mix of bushings, we need to start from scratch.  You have a relatively small split of 6 degrees which helps.  Your bushings are far too hard for your weight so I suggest either APS 87.5 or KranK 87a.  Similar to my recommendation above, Pick up 2 pair of RipTide Canon bushings and one pair of Magnums in either APS 87.5 or KranK 87a, you will have the following options available: 

Canon / Canon front using flat washers and Canon / Canon rear with cupped washers
Magnum / Canon front, Canon / Magnum rear.
Canon / Canon front and Canon / Magnum rear
Canon / Canon front and Magnum / Magnum rear

What Brad said.  I don't think they make the pivots in 90a I am around 175lbs and the 96a pivot cups work for me in my calibers. The Evolve truck bushings look like a barrel and a fat cone. Depending on your weight as that will effect which duro you get but I would get a set of krank barrels and krank fat cones

It is certainly fun to experiment if you like but I resist having you spend where it may not be needed.  Bushings are a very personal choice and if you like what you are on, why change?  From a educational and experience viewpoint, shape, as well as compound offer virtually limitless tuning options but it can be overwhelming so I suggest changing one thing at a time so you understand the effect of that change.  We call our pivots a "gateway drug" because of their game changing capacity.  For bushings, we have 90a in both APS and KranK compound.  Evolve trucks take our ShortStreet height (.4") on top if each pair and Standard longboard height (.6") on the bottom.  If you want to play with bushings also, I suggest KranK 90a since it is more adjustable than APS and get  combination of ShortStreetCones and ShortStreetBarrels to combine with our Standard Barrels for the bottom of each pair.

Yeah forget they are consider a kind of tkp style truck.  I personally would never skate a sidewinder truck cause they are so damn tall.  On a separate note the pivots that you have for the surfrodz on the esk8 page are they the same as the surfrodz on the longboard page?

I didn't try that because I it was like the hole for the bushing was too small for the insert/ insert hole was to wide for the bushing.  It fit on my stock abec11 bushings though for my liquid attack rpk.  It was also a harder duro that I was trying it on so that could have had something to do with it.

@kmitas, I have one of these in house so I will publish my finding soon.  My initial impression is the factory has tightened the bushings far beyond where they should so relieve the king pin nuts to the point where the washers are loose then tighten to take out all the rattle as your starting point for adjustment.  This will loosen up the setup a lot. The theory on compound truck tuning is to progressively have stiffer bushing pairs with the loosest roadside front and the tightest boardside rear.   I will have a full evaluation soon.

Hey @flanagan805  First try creating a differential bushing set up front and back.  Loosen the king pin till you can just rotate the top washer front and back then tighten the front 1/2 turn in the front and 1 to 1.5 turns in the rear and try riding again keeping your legs loose and knees bent.

OK, great, I suggest picking up two  pair of Canons and one pair of Magnums so you will have the ability to try several different setups.  These bushings will also work if you decide to create an actual split setup so  you are covered.  For your weight, I suggest KranK 93a

Right now I have 90 (green) krank barrel in thread and 87 (white) barrel in the front. I want to be able to use the bushings full potential in a lean, with out the physical barrier from the hanger seat. I want more lean and I want to be supported good in the end range of the lean.

## \#913 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2019-02-23T00:26:16.120Z Reads: 76

The Chubby is designed to increase stability and in effect reduce lean.  If you want lean in SZ trucks, do the mod and use Cones, Barrels, or FatCones.  If you want to try the Chubby for a high lean application, you will need to go down in durometer, about 5 or more points than the Barrel you are using

Hi, I got myself Riptide Krank 87a and 90a barrel bushings (0.6" tall). Compared to the purple Orangatang Nipples (87a) which I have on my Caliber truck the Riptide equivalent feels super stiff. My truck has a 230 mm wide hanger and just from the feels how the hanger behaves it is not going to be a great carving machine. I'd like to know if using the APS barrels with 85a and 80a duro will improve this significantly. My weight is 65 kgs.

Hey @DAddYE sorry for the late reply, I was distracted by something shiny!

For Evolve compound trucks:

For simplicity, I will refer to the bushing positions from roadside to boardside so for the front, F1 is the bushing closest to the road in the front and F4 is the bushing closest to the deck in the front, rear will be the same just designated R1-R4. Also, the position 1-2 are the primary turning pair and position 3-4 are the secondary turning pair.

Front truck
                                                                                                                                       
F1: KranK 90a ShortStreetCone (.4" tall)
                                                                                                                                       
F2: KranK 90a Barrel (.6" tall)
                                                                                                                                       
F3: KranK 93a or 96a ShortStreetBarrel (.4" tall)

F4: KranK 93a or 96a Barrel (.6" tall)

Rear Truck

R1: KranK 93a or 96a ShortStreetCone (.4" tall)

R2: KranK 93a or 96a Barrel (.6" tall)

R3: KranK 93a or 96a ShortStreetBarrel (.4" tall)

R4: KranK 93a or 96a Barrel (.6" tall)

For reference we defaulted to the harder choice of the options above, I weigh just about 200 lbs and this worked well for me as well as my son that weighs 140 lbs. We found the key to settling down your trucks is to keep the pair of bushings closest to the deck (F3-4 and R3-4) stiffer than the bushings closer to the road (F1-2 and R1-2). The primary pair should initiate the turn, then the secondary pair should come into play when needed or wanted.  I hope this is not too confusing as there is a lot going on with these trucks. The way we have it setup currently, you can run full speed all day and still have a lot of turn when needed, so agility and stability. Also, our Evolve Pivot cups fit the trucks perfectly.

@Alphamail
What is the equivalence between WFB and Krank bushings?
eg Right now I have 95.5a WFB barrel on the rear and 88a WFB barrel on the front.

If I wanted to change to Krank what should I select and how would it affect the behavior of the board?

This is a theoretical question as I am really happy with the way I have setup my Evo right now.

However I am building a Tayto with caliber 2 50degree trucks and I am trying to figure out what Riptide  bushings to buy.

I have already read that article.

From what i understand a Krank bushing would have to be approx. 1-2 shore ratings softer to give me the same feel as a WFB and would also allow me to play a little by tightening the truck unlike the WFB.

So instead of 95.5a WFB I would have to use a 90a Krank and maybe tighten the kingpin a little.

Also since they have more rebound the board would have more of a tendency to return to center as opposed to WFB which would need more input from the rider.

Is that correct?

That is very close, but I think 93a KranK may be a better choice is you are using a Cupped washer on the WFB, just run a flat with the KranK

2. Stock 93a hard bushings.

4. Transportation, 20mph+ carving. 
5. Hummie's double drop deck, top mounted. 
6. 180lbs geared up. 

The current bushing feel dead to me, not a ton of response or rebound. I can go fast comfortably, but my turning radius isnt a tight as id like it to be

OK @Colson003, @PickSix24, and @SkatesontheBay, SZ TKP's turn a lot and can be very twitchy, which is even more pronounced if you use the "Surf Keys".  Often they need a lot of bushing to control them, unfortunately the most recent versions no longer accept our Chubby as SZ has opted for their Venturi seat both top and bottom.  The ideal boardside bushing for SZ TKP's used to be the Chubby so depending on the vintage you have, that ship may have sailed.  That leaves our Cones, Barrels and FatCones to work with as well as adjusting the base plate angles.  I suggest leaving the front unchanged and dewedging the rear (make the kingpin more vertical) 3.5 to 7 degrees depending on what is available.  Stock SZ bushings are normally a cone / barrel setup so change the front to a Barrel / Barrel and the rear to a Barrel / FatCone.  If you are using grind kingpin, use a Cupped washer for the rear roadside Barrel to help compensate for the increased leverage of the dewedged rear.  For compound and duro for a 180 pounder, KranK 93 should work fine, for 150-160 go KranK 90a

Mbs ATS 12's on double drop 41" deck. The king pins are almost vertical. They are ment to be mounted at a 30° angle not drop through so there's that. I added maybe 5 or 10° front and back riser to try and wedge a bit. Got bad speed wobbles and went down at 30mph, Then switched from barrel/cone and cup washer to double barrel with large flat washer. Feels much better now, can I do anything else?

You might be right, I just found this above responding to @anorak234 :  "So the top (road.side) bushing is our Street height and the bottom (boardside) bushing is our longboard height. Looking at the base plate, unfortunately they designed in a recess which limits your bushing and washer shape choices. You might be able to circumvent the recess with the large flat washers we ship with the Chubby and FatCone but you might need to go with the Street height in that position also to compensate for the lost height."

I normally ride metros setup with a barrel and cone but I really compress the bushings.

I like the idea of krank changing with pressure but wonder if the correct duro with the other 2 formulas would hold me just as well but give a bit more turn.

OK @Thebreadsticks, thanks for the 45 degree base plate update.  SZ RKP's can take three of our main shapes in out .6" tall longboard series of RipTide Bushings:  Cone, Barrel and FatCone.  We designed the FatCone specifically for the SZ trucks back when Wayne G. still owned the company because the trucks do not fit the Chubby very well and we wanted we wanted a "larger than a Barrel" option for them.  So there several ways you can set them up.  Your trucks are both at 45 degrees and you can set them up the same front and back (symmetrical) or different front and back (synthetic split).  In my opinion, it does not make a lot of sense to set them symmetrical unless you want the ability to go as fast forward as you do backward or you want the option to us the setup as a front or rear wheel drive.   I will give you both recommendations below.

Symmetrical 45 degree 240 lbs:  Barrel / FatCone Front and back KranK 93 or APS 95

Synthetic Split 45 degree 240 lbs:  Cone / Barrel front and Barrel FatCone back KranK 93 or APS 95

As for washer selection, flats are less restrictive and cups are more restrictive and precision are the most restrictive.  Often truck manufacturers try to be cool, fashionable or just don't know any better, design their trucks to not use washers in some positions which is a huge mistake since washers are one of the most inexpensive (not precision washers though) and most effective tuning tools you have.  SZ opted to ignore those benefits, supplying their trucks without a boardside washer and using a kingpin that acts as a flat washer.  It looks nice but that is where the benefits end.  Depending on the length of the king pin supplied, you should be able to add a washer boardside and or roadside, if not, you can replace the SZ grind kingpin with a slightly longer standard grade 8 kingpin.  Please let me know if this cleared or added to the confusion regarding washers.

Currently setup:

Surfrodz 45 deg

Rear:
 - 96 barrel (board side) krank
 - 93 barrel (street side) krank

Front:
 - 96 barrel (board side) krank
 - 92 cone (street side) aps

I tried these:

Cup washers for front and back
 - good stability but need steering!
 - doesn't hold the lean while turning. It felt like it rebounds the board back to flat too quickly.

Cup washers front (street & board side) and cup rear board side; flat rear street side
 - good stability
 - good initial steering but bad exit.
 - perhaps bad user stance

Cup front and read (both board side); flat front and read (street side)
 - edgy but I like how it steers
 - scary at high speed.
 - need more stability.

I like the board to steer w stability. I mainly carve.

Any recommendations? 170-180lbs depending in what I carry in my backpack.

TIA

@pookybear My first thought is the durometers you are using are a bit high for your weight.  The starting point for KranK compression is where you can still turn the roadside bushing in the bushing seat by hand so all the slop is out of the stack.  From that point, you have about two full turns of adjustment.  I suggest using the rear truck to be the the main return to center so try rearranging the bushings this way:

Front: 92a Cone streetside / 93a Barrel boardside Stare 
Rear: 96a Barrel streetside / 96a Barrel boardside

Start with flat washers in all positions and add cups where needed

I think I understand. Just not really sure what precision washers are, or what I really need. I thought they were super high end trucks, can’t believe there’s stupid issues like that. Gahhh

But I agree 100% that running a higher duro in back adds stability and improves tracking. Will definitely try what you recommended. Just dunno about krank or aps. I like the idea behind both. But kranks adjustable tension sounds helpful for dialing it in!!

Hi @Alphamail 

I wondered if you can help me. 

I just finished putting together my board (An Evolve Carbon GT). I thought it would be a great idea to go with the stock trucks but this has turned out to be a bit of a disaster as I get massive speed wobbles any time I try to accelerate above 20mph. Further to this they also feel like they want to be in the turn constantly so even when I'm trying to hold it straight they feel twitchy as hell and I'm constantly trying to correct. 

I've ordered some Surf Rodz 45degree RKP's with 80mm axles as I understand these have a reputation for being more stable at speed. 

I would now like your help to find the right bushings. I don't mind buying more than I need so I can try different combinations. 

My weight is 170 but 180 with gear. My preference is speed. I like long, gentle, stable turns as I'm from a snowboarding background and want to try recreate that feeling of holding an edge. Most of the time though I'm bombing it forwards so I really want something that is happy to keep me in the middle and holding my line. I definitely feel I need more stability at the back. 

If you think it would be an idea to wedge also I'm open to the idea.

Thanks. I really appreciate the help!

Cool, let me know how it works out, for your weigh, I would opt for the lower duro range.  As for the SZ RKP/s I would definitely dewedge the rear 5 to 10 degrees and leave the front at 45 degrees  to start.  A fun and functional bushing setup for the split above would be a Cone / Barrel front and a Barrel / FatCone rear in either KranK 93a or APS 92.5a

Hi,

I’m looking to get a new bushing set-up to replace my stock ones. Could you recommend me a setup?

* I use genuine caliber II 44’
* I use stock bushing that came with it. This is a Cone/barrel
* The trucks feel alright. But I would like to have more manoeuvrability so looser. It is quite stable and little speed wobble at high speeds and I would like to keep it like that. Not sure what you mean with less or more rebound and how that will affect my riding.
* Aggressive riding, aggressive carving at medium to high speeds. Or just very relaxing, cosy ride.
* ttps://www.ospreyactionsports.co.uk/osprey-text-twin-tip-longboard.html this is my deck and wheelbite is not very likely.
* 75 to 80 (with equipment) kilos

Surf-Rodz RKP

* If you are using aftermarket bushings, I need the bushing brand, duro and shape that are in the trucks currently.

N/A

* I need to know how the trucks feel and what you want to change: Do you want it looser, tighter, more stable, less stable, more rebound, less rebound, etc…

Have never skated before

* Type of skating you want to use the setup for.

Safely commuting. Largely cruising, while I'd like to be able to carve it's not exactly the priority

* Deck you are using and how likely the set up will wheel bite.

In the future, hopefully a HAYA. Slight possbility of wheel-bite at extremes

* How much you weigh.

I'm currently in crunch time to make a build. Since I've never skated before... I really have no idea what I'm after. Mainly looking for a recommendation for the SR RKP's to be safe & stable at my weight. Would be open to buying a few pairs from you initially to get a feel of things.

@s5300, I would strongly suggest riding with the stock SZ bushings to begin with, at this point, we will be guessing what will work for you.  I appreciate your willingness to pick up several sets of our bushings but we work best if you have problems or issues with your setup.  The stock bushings may feel just right to you but as you gain experience your will realize what you want to be different.  At that moment, we can help!

Hey. Riding SZ rkps. Went with your recommendation of krank 93a fatcone/barrel and barrel/cone.

I had to over compress the bushings to keep me stable and I couldn’t turn very well. I tried cups everywhere and loosened a bit but still didn’t feel right. I now put venom hpf barrels 95 cupped rear and 93 in front, not as stable but can turn great. I’d kinda like to try the same setup you recommended but a higher duro. Any chance I could buy 1 fatcone 2 barrels and 1 cone?

Maybe aps instead of krank? Dunno

Great topic, thanks @alphamail 
Currently pushing - which is not that fun on a deck this tall (38 vanguard flex 3, caliber 2 50* trucks, 85mm caguamas 77A)
I live in Philadelphia, this is a commuting and cruising board. Compiling parts for a dual 6355 and 10s4p system. I wont be traveling at top speed too frequently. If you've been to Philly youll remember our roads :smiley:

I use to skateboard years ago, still snowboard. Been on the longboard for just a few days and starting to get my balance and rhythm a bit, have adjusted trucks a bit. My only observation thus far has been that it seems to really dive about 1/2 way through my lean-  like there's a cliff there.  
Anyways, turning radius is important and reasonable stability. I can re-visit new bushings when ive got some more time on the board.

165 lbs, probably 180 with gear
open to wedge, truck angle swap etc. 

thanks again!

I think you need to loosen them up to the point you can turn the roadside bushing in the seat by hand then tighten the rear a little bit first then adjust 1/4 turn at a time front and back.  Are you using cupped washers in any of the positions?.  You have the bushings in the front Cone roadside, Barrel boardside and the rear, Barrel roadside and FatCone boardside?

Cupped washers top and bottom. Barrel board. Cone road side small side to road on both. 

Just checked. I had them about 1.5-2 turns tighter than when I can spin the road side bushing by hand. 2-3 thread over the nut.

@Alphamail

I  find that the advice of tightening only until you cannot turn the bushings does not work with Surf-Rodz trucks due to conical and restrictive shape of the bushing seat.

It works for other trucks with a more open seat but if I do it on my SR trucks the hanger flops left to right since the bushings are not yet seated.

Hello Alphamail,

I run now the Canon / Canon front and Canon / Magnum rear since a while and just want to setup my new shortboard, Its more a fun board and carve a lot. Short commutes with a lot of turns and carvey streets. Will the same settings work for this board?

I would go for the same setup, just with 87A instead of 90A... 

1. CaliberII with 97mm Popocas, 5mm riser on the front and 6degrees riser on the back
2. No aftermarket bushings… all stock.
3. They feel okish... just stock
4. more carving
5. HAYA shoarboard deck
6. about 85kg

Yes that’s how I ran them. Started with no cups, eventually had all cups except on the fatcone. I can’t turn the bushings even when the kingpin isn’t tightened. Super hard to even put on the kingpin. Keep in mind I only have one arm.

I put all venom barrels on, 95 cupped in rear, 93 open in front. Haven’t taken it out yet. 

I need more turning with at least as much support for speed.

Round end to hanger

That’s how my venom are. Going for a try now. Maybe I’ll try dual fatcone in back and dual barrels in front. I just think a harder barrel would work better than compressed fat cones. And they really only add resistance in the turn, while uncompressed isn’t it about the same for stability?

I’m also going to take my tires up 10 psi, might help with wobbles

The venom hpf barrels are great. 95 double cupped rear and 93 up front. Way more turny and just as stable.

Maybe I should try aps or wfb barrels at the highest and 2nd highest duro.

I’m liking their hpf formula that I believe is closer to your wfb or aps. They also offer a super high rebound formula that I would guess it be closer to KranK.  
Any reason you think krank would do better than aps or wfb? I like the idea of aps’s white powder shit.

I’ve already got 93 krank barrels fatcones and regular cones and I didn’t like them near as much as these venoms.. I just don’t want to buy another set of krank if I don’t like that formula. 

I guess I’d only have to buy the 96a and I could try it. But I’m looking for more turn and that doesn’t seem to be what krank is intended for. Maybe I’m wrong.

I need more turn with the same stability. Is that possible?

Venoms formulas are very different from ours, especially WFB (white residue sometimes present), for a further discussion of our formulas, go here:   https://www.riptidesports.com/aps-krank-wfb-explained/ 
I default to KranK since I have spent so much time on it and it is very forgiving, stable and adjustable for me but that is a personal choice as with all formulas.   I would suggest trying APS at the same duro as you Venoms or slightly higher, if you want to try WFB, definitely choose a higher duro or a bigger shape!

[quote="Alphamail, post:975, topic:42036"]
My first thought is the durometers you are using are a bit high for your weight. The starting point for KranK compression is where you can still turn the roadside bushing in the bushing seat by hand so all the slop is out of the stack. From that point, you have about two full turns of adjustment. I suggest using the rear truck to be the the main return to center so try rearranging the bushings this way:

Front: **92a Cone streetside** / 93a Barrel boardside Stare Rear: 96a Barrel streetside / 96a Barrel boardside

Start with flat washers in all positions and add cups where needed

There is no 92a krank cone bushing under longboard.

Based on what I can see about the trucks you should be able to fit our Cones, Barrels, Canons and FatCones but not the Magnum or Chubby.  Can you confirm the height of the bushings so we can know what height will fit without changing the geometry?

If this is the case it seems like going fatcone/barrel barrel/regular cone all 93a was a bad suggestion. I thought wheels were expensive but I’ve got 50 bucks in riptide and 40 on venoms. Almost 100 bucks for such a small amount of thane. I’m liking the low rebound of the venoms HPF formula, their lower rebound compound. And then you recommended the highest rebound formula you have..

Why is their hpf so different than wfb or aps?

@Leon8121 that is an unusual set up for sure, sounds interesting.  How did you compensate for the height difference?  Compound trucks seem to benefit from a stiffer or bigger shaped boardside pair than the roadside pair.  I normally set them up with a ShortStreetBarrel / StreetBarrel boardside and a ShortStreetCone / StreetBarrel roadside.  For your weight, KranK 87a, for the rear Caliber, is it a 50 or 44 degree truck?

The following discussion is being moved to the public thread in hope of helping others: 

I’m 6’1" 165lbs. I will be using 10" Caliber 2 trucks with 50* baseplates. The trucks will be going on G-Bomb DDR brackets so the truck angle is adjustable on the fly. I will probably end up with a wedge dewedge setup like an Evo but I’ll have to tinker the exact adjustment when it gets here. I don’t know what I want to change about how the Caliber 2 rides since I don’t have them yet but I do ride Gunmetal trucks right now which are similar. They feel a bit dead to me, I would like a more lively feel. I would like the turning to be agile for commuting and carving but also stable for when I’m going 30 mph.

@Alphamail: Both Caliber and Gunmetal trucks will fell a little dead because they do not have rake but they can certainly be improved upon. The split you end up with will determine the differential you actually need in durometer but I think I can get you close. I would suggest a pair of KranK 87a barrels up front and KranK 90a for the back. Be sure to have both cupped and Flat washers available for additional tuning options. For additional questions, please use the bushing help thread so others can benefit also.

Do you think I would be better off going with Paris V3 with 43* plates? I was actually thinking I might adjust the split depending on whether I’m commuting or doing a group ride since it only takes a minute. What about pivot cups? Can’t a cupped washer be used as a flat washer by flipping it? Do you think precision washers are worth it for cast trucks? Sorry, do you want me to move this discussion over there right now?

@Mr_Monday, thank you, the paris 43's are a nice lively well made truck and would also make a good choice with the brackets, the only downside is they do not take our Chubby shape if you want a plush, stepped bushing for the rear.   However, the Magnum works great in the Paris and it is just a little less restrictive than the Chubby.  As fo adjusting the front and rear angles, each time you do it you will need to adjust or change the bushings to accommodate the change in leverage you have over the bushings.  I have had plenty of g-Bomb bracket setups and once I find a good all around setting, I never change it again.  There is a lot to be said for a consistent setup that you have muscle memory with.

about to upgrade the stock bushings, my setup is:

I find that the advice of tightening only until you cannot turn the bushings does not work with Surf-Rodz trucks due to conical and restrictive shape of the bushing seat.

It works for other trucks with a more open seat but if I do it on my SR trucks the hanger flops left to right since the bushings are not yet seated.

I finally got to try this. Wow. Amazing. Carvy and stable at high speed. High speed to me is 35-40mph.

Thank you!

@XTLA, I think you misunderstood or I misspoke.  For our bushings, specifically Krank, the starting point is where you can still barely turn the bushing in the seat by hand.  From that compression, you have about two full turns of the king pin nut of adjustment to work with

i'll try that again, i love riptide, i've been using them on my 2 boards with caliber trucks and everythings work like a charm. on my Surfrodz i'll try to put sharp edge of the barrels toward hanger and see how it goes. for now i need to fully tighten them to make it works and sacrifice the turney feeling. i'll try again and update later, thanks Brad.

Got a Teamgee H9 electric longboard, and I would like to switch out the bushings. According to the manufacturer the standard bushings are SHR95A and 25mm.
Which one should I select?
I am 84kg (185lbs), and I have ridden longboard before.
I am not really happy with the original bushings.

It feels a little unstable at high speed and I had to tighten the bushings quite hard to make it more stable. At low speed they are pretty hard to control. According to the manufacturer they are 95a but I have a hard time believing that. One of them are barrel and the other is cone.

Hey again,

Cupped washers did make a noticeable difference, but now I’m going faster! Cruising about 30-35mph and looks like I need to swap out the bushings. To feel okay there id have to have them super tight and they’re really compressed making for a sucky turning radius. Even then it doesn’t feel amazing. Let me know if you have any suggestions!

Weight: 165lbs

Trucks: Haggy Kahua trucks (double barrel, 92a, flat front cupped back)

OK, I am going to agree with you regarding the stock bushings and recommend you try a Canon / Canon setup in KranK 93a.  Have both Cupped and Flat washers available for additional tuning options.

OK, I am surprised that the 92a stock bushings are too loose for you because I would recommend going softer since your weight is 165 and the trucks are at a 50 degree angle unless I missed something.  Did I?

Here’s how my bushings looks right now, I’m getting the impression they’re a bit too compressed? Feels decently good at 30 up to 35mph (which I cruise at), but a little higher at 40mph  feels a bit sketchy & turning at lower <8mph sucks :frowning:

Maybe I should loosen them a bit and just build more confidence and stability at speed?

At this point, they are likely over compressed and shot.  I suggest getting a pair of 90a Canons and a pair of 90a Magnums in either KranK or the APS compound.

Roadside bushing / Boardside bushing configurations below

Symmetrical:

Canon / Magnum front and back

Magnum / Canon front and back

Asymmetrical:

Magnum / Canon front, Canon / Magnum rear

Canon / Canon front, Magnum / Magnum rear.

To be safe,  pick up 2 pair of the Canons and one pair of the Magnums in case the Magnums will fit only boardside which will add an additional asymmetrical setup to the mix: Canon / Canon front, Canon / Magnum rear.

Gotcha, thanks for the help! Will be putting through an order. I think I'll go with the KranK for flexibility. One quantity on your website is a pair of bushings right? 
- also, if you could explain the difference between the canon/magnum's? would help me understand the differences between the five setups. Sorry for the bother :sweat:

Correct, sold as pairs, Canons are a barrel shaped bushing slightly larger in diameter than our Barrels and the Magnum is 10% larger diameter than the Canon and has a beveled edge that faces the hanger

Gotcha! do you recommend I should pick up a pair of pivot cups too? Haggyboard says the caliber II riptide ones fit perfectly into the baseplate.

One last question :P I also have a set of paris clones from dickyho ready to be ridden, since I'll have an extra pair of bushings left over, do you reckon I should grab another set of canon or magnums for them (3 - 1 or 2-2)? Thanks again so much for your help!

Interested in some nice bushing, pivots, wedge or dewedge whatever you believe I need that can fit for me. Sooooo here I go lol

Hummie Deck Surfrod RKP 200mm 45 angle (Regular bushing & pivot cup it came with)

I like to curve a lot sometimes even going fast so I would say I like it on the looser side. I don’t like the trucks too be tight but not hella loose ether :flushed: Over course everyone don’t want speed wobbles . So what do you suggest ? I hear dewedging the rear helps from wheels wobbling too much but is it still good for carving ? Sorry for information not good enough please ask me anything haha

2. Not using after market bushings but looking into getting: RipTide Krank Canon 90a and Magnum 90a for board side and roadside and the RipTide pivot cup for Paris V2.

3. They feel kinda shit lol. like its either too tight or too loose and the carving is not fun.

4. all terrain setup with pneumatics but ride on the street and on college campus most of the time.

5. I'm gonna use [this](https://www.skateshred.com/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/blank-drop-through-decks/wholesale-bamboo-drop-through-deck.html) deck.

Hey, I have the same set up as @esk8snith with the dickyho paris clones, except I'm using 97mm abec urethane wheels 

I have a high speed setup and regularly cruise at 40mph. At this speed even with nut very tight it feels loose, and at low speeds it feels far too tight. At medium speeds around 15 I would like to have a tighter turn-in.
I'm asking for everything here with clones, I know, but what bushings should I get?

My deck is a stiffy 40" maple skateshred dropthrough bottom mounted.

I'm 165 lbs

 OK @esk8snith sorry for the delayed reply.  I think a Canon / Magnum setup may be a bit more than you need.  I would suggest Canon / Canon in KranK 90a using flat washers up front and cupped in the back.  I would also suggest our backing frames anytime you re using a dropthrough deck to reinforce the cutout portion of the deck.

Hey @turbolovah, since you are top mounting your dropthrough, I would recommend de-wedging the rear 5 to 10 degrees truck to gain some stability with a split setup.  I suggest getting two pair of KranK 87a Canons and one pair of KranK 87a Magnums so you will have several setups to try.

3. I want them to feel very stable at high speeds, haven't tried them out currently as is.

## \#1105 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2019-10-27T20:00:33.665Z Reads: 21

Yes, washers matter welcome to the forum.  With the EVO, using stock bushings you will definitely have some issues because of the deck angles causing the front to be more difficult to turn than the rear which is the opposite of what you want.  If the TB 218's are equipped with a Cone / Barrel set up, try putting both cones up front and the Barrels in the rear to get a feel for the setup.  If that cannot be done if the Barrel is a insert bushing, try Flat washers up front and Cupped in the rear.  Making any changes, be sure to check for wheel bite and let me know what you try so we can determine what approach to take.

Thanks for doing this, I appreciate the help. I made a post a gooood while (few months ago) about my build but I haven't really gotten around to updating. Anyway, I actually went ahead and got most of the parts I think I have on there, and I threw it together with the electronics taped to the top to see if it works - it definitely works, has PLENTY of torque and I can tell it could go much faster than I need. 
1. Caliber II 9" Hanger Width, 50deg (wondering if I should go 44 on one or both of these? Maybe angled riser?)
2. Just using the bushings that came with them, Muirskate says they're cone/cone 89a, I got my trucks from Amazon
3. Right now I like how it carves, but it feels like I need way to much lean to be able to. I have 1/4" risers and if I REALLY push right to the limit of how hard I would ever turn I can get some wheel bite. Also, its a short deck (Arbor Pilsner) so it's somewhat unstable at any sort of cruising speed. I really just wanted a super compact board with a lot of torque that can go maybe ~15 mph, but even before that speed it feels pretty unstable. I like how it feels rebound wise I think? I would probably be ok with more centering force like with full cylinder type bushings - looking for your opinion on all this though.
4. Cruising around campus, not more than a few miles a day most likely and not any faster than 20 mph, most likely slower 10-15 mph. Still want to be able to turn somewhat tight at slower speeds while maintaining cruising stability if possible.
5. Arbor Pilsner 29" - it has cutouts for the wheels, I'm using Orangatang Kegel 80mm with the 9" trucks and 1/4" risers. Like I said, right now if I lean pretty much right past the most I ever would (like if im carving or something and I need to lean into it harder to regain balance or avoid an obstacle I guess) it might wheel bite. 
6. ~140lbs 

Again, thanks!

Also I can take some pictures of how it looks. Its kind of weird looking but I dont care much, its functional lol

OK @BadBeaver, changing the rear to a 44 degree base plate will go a long way in settling this setup down a bit.. At 140 lbs I would go with KranK 87a Canons front and back using cupped washers in back and flats up front.  Canons are a slightly larger diameter than our Barrels and fit the caliber bushing seat better.  I also suggest replacing the pivot cups with our Caliber II WFB 96a lubricated pivots

Hello @Alphamail I am new to this esk8 fourm and I heard you are the guy to talk to to get the right bushing set up.  I've been riding my current set up for about 4 months and still occasionally get speed wobbles when I reach 30-32mph I thought it was just me needing to get better but a couple of my friends think it is my bushings.

 I currently have caliber II 50 degree with stock bushings 
I weigh 160 but usually ride with a 20lb backpack for school. 
I'm also going to be getting bigger wheels and might start experiencing wheel bite. Is there something to do to increase the height of the trucks? Might just need a different board but I'd rather see if the bushings and help first. 

Thanks in advance!
