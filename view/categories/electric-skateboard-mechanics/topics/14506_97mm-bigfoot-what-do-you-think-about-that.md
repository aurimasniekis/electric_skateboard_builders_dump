I want to use them with a Selfmade deck and:
Vesc/Sk3 6374 149kv/Selfmade mount and belt...

Do you think they would be good?
They are cheaper then flywheels with trucks...

Thanks for your mind.
But real flywheels are the same price without trucks.
I am searching for an better option to buy wheels in Germany.

High quality urethane makes a huge difference. I'd recommend genuine Abec11 flywheels if you can find them. Or Kegels

I agree with @jmasta, Abec11 wheels provide a much smoother ride with excellent grip. That said, Clones will suffice if its all you can afford. I also started with clones and found that they seem more stable at speeds above 30mph than my Abec11's.
The thing you gotta watch out for with clones is sometimes there good and sometimes there bad.
I've had 90mm clones that spun true and where very stable.
I've had 97mm clones that wobbled like there was no tomorrow.
Personally I would not recommend going over 90mm and I prefer 83mm.
About the trucks. you really need genuine Caliber 2 trucks 184mm
Better to buy these components separately.
