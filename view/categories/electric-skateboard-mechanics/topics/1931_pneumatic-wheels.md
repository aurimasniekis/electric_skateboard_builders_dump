Hello guys, I've spent a couple of days on the internet searching for pneumatic wheels for my e-board and to be honest, couldn't find any for sale (aliendrive urban 5 wheels are out of stock). Does anybody knows where to order them shipped to Europe? Also where to order motor and wheel pulleys in Europe or shipped to Europe for reasonable shipping price. Thank you.

@inspekto The ADS wheels are 5" Skike pneumatics designed for kid-sized rollerblades. They work really well (I use them). You might be able to find and mod them outside of ADS. 

The other go-to would be @psychotiller's aluminum hubs that can use Matco pneumatics. If I could rebuild from scratch, that's what I would do (they weren't available when I [completed my build][1]) 

Another option, which I think could be really awesome, would be to use a pair of gbomb extenders and MBS Rockstar 2 hubs. This would mean 8 inch wheels but I think you could use standard trucks and a set of 8mm bearings designed for the MBS hub (I think Trampa and Scram sell the bearings). You can get a wheel pulley from Evolve for the RS2s.

A few things to consider about pneumatics: they are larger, and thusly might impact the ease of carrying your eskate, especially if you use the 8" wheels. Also, even though all of these are technically ride-flat tires, I still carry a spare complete wheel (hub\tire\tube\bearings) bearing set in my backpack. Riding with a flat is possible but it sucks! So add that to the cost. You also have to be careful with wheel clearance and axel size, some wheels won't work on certain deck shapes without wheel cutouts.

The 5" Skike wheels are no longer being made so stocks are slowly depleting.
I already had a hard time finding spare inner tubes.
I have a complete assembled set of pneumatics with bearings, spacers and 60T wheel pulleys plus two spare inner tubes I've been sitting on for some time now. Absolutely zero road time. I just don't like the look of a board with pneumatics, it looks too much like a scooter.
I'd be willing to part with them for €100 plus shipping.

Thank you for your replies. I'm looking for small (5'') and lightweight wheels, so I'm leaning to Skikes, however, as being said, I cannot find inner tubes for them. Also, is it possible to modify them to fit 22mm skateboard wheels bearings?

Just bought some skike 5" wheels from their website. They have a promotion going on where you get 5% off for every round your national football team advances in the European championship.
For Germany that means 20% off right now.
5 complete wheels cost me 91€ including shipping (got a spare one just in case).
Only need to make them fit longboard trucks - but a lathe should be able to handle that.

As far as I know Skike no loinger sells products with 5" wheels which means they have become a legacy product.
Did you get inner tubes and tires as well ?
I had a hell of a hard time getting hold of those.

Oh yeah and good luck putting the tires and inners on the hubs. It's a wrestling match ;-)

@Maxid this is great new. They've been out of stock for so long that rumors buzzed about discontinuation. Thanks for the notice.

@trbt555 is right about lubrication, I used Tire glaze, which has the added benefit of making the tires look good for a few minutes. 

I recommend the tire tool that Skike sells; it will spare you a lot of sore hands!

I've tried these wheels  without success. All the wheels had a slight wobble to them. I bought 2 sets through ADS after hearing the possibility that these wheels were going to be discontinued. Initially I thought I had a problem with the tire not being centered with the wheel but with the wheel on the truck by itself, one could see the slight wobble.  I ended up buying Psychotiller wheels.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7c7e34848ed35c333c2425baf77691e1e3cf955a.jpg" width="640" height="428">

A wobbly wheel translates to a lot of vibration to the board. Gets worse as you go faster. I'm surprised that other people haven't mentioned this before. Perhaps it was discussed on Endless Sphere forum.

I agree. I think someone should figure out how to properly place a counterbalance.. The wobble is quite bad just by spinning the wheel with hand..

Picked up a set of 5" Skike, and some bearings from them as well, just in case, while I wait for other perhaps better stuff to be back in stock (Psychotiller and DIY-ES). Also just to see how they'll fit the board I picked up for this (been stuck for a while with indecision what to get, eh, have to start somewhere :) ) 

Will have a go at removing the necessary material with a Dremmel and report back about wobble etc..

@cdn @Okami @dsmudger I've been riding the skikes for a while and I'll confirm what @cdn says about wobble. The quality control reflects an obvious truth; they are meant for a kid's scooter not a grown person, and certainly not for esk8. Here's me quoting myself because it's relevant:

[quote="treenutter, post:13, topic:4232"]
The search for good AT wheels is tough! I currently used modified 5 inch skike wheels and they are pretty good, here are some thoughts on them:

The high psi means low rolling resistance so they are fast, but still smooth out the roads. I don't fear every pebble or crack on the road.

The tires aren't very robust so the drive wheel tire burns up pretty fast (I get about 120 miles per drive wheel tire). 

The QA for the tires and tubes is not very good, so it's common to get a tube or tire that is not true and has significant wobble even though it's new. I'd say about 30% of tires or tubes have a problem. 

Skike stopped making them. Once I use up the spares I have, I'll need to look for a new AT wheel.*

I think that 5 inches is the sweet spot between good road performance but still compact enough to carry around like a skateboard; 6" might be OK as well. The new 7" Evolve wheels look OK. My first choice if I could start over would be @psychotiller's hubs.

*note: they appear to be in production again after a long time being OOS.

I don't think it will be such a big deal. You are not supposed to go 25mph with them and even if there are vibrations they will probably still be a lot lower than what you'd experience with standard wheels on anything that is not perfectly smooth tarmac.
Also it is probably not the wobble in the wheel but the valve that is causing an unbalance.
```

## \#27 Posted by: cdn Posted at: 2016-07-31T14:41:04.065Z Reads: 291

The wobble is definitely in the wheel. As mentioned earlier, with the wheel placed on the truck and spun by hand you can see a definite wobble. With 2 sets of wheels, all of them had a wobble in them. Not what you call a quality product. Got to remember these wheels weren't designed for e-boards. I did complete my build with these wheels and did test the board out.   In my opinion, having a wobbly wheel makes it a dangerous board that can cause serious injury to yourself or somebody else.

I have 9'' primo striker wheels and the wobble is definetely because of the valve's weight. Would be great if someone came up with a position and correct counterbalance weight, otherwise at higher speeds it might be noticable.

Have not had a chance to test these wheels yet, unfortunately still have not got my motor and I accidentaly messed up one of the hubs.

```
yeah I just noticed that on my drive wheel. Once I put on the screws to hold the pulley and left the one closest to the valve out the wheel wobbled way less. The bolts basically acted as a counterweight.
I am now thinking of applying this even to the non-drive wheels. The holes in the skike rims are perfect for M5 screws.
Not a beautiful solution but could be easy enough to justify it.
Will report back once I actually tried to ride them - maybe the wobble isn't even that bad at the low speeds I am planning on going.
```

## \#31 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2016-08-01T10:29:10.387Z Reads: 297

Yeah, I was thinking the same way - to use the existing bolts / bolts holes to counter the weight. 

Don't know how the screws are placed for you wheel  / or are there any clearence left but it should be possible to insert a longer screw with added metal ring to increase the weight. It just needs to be the correct weight, as the screw is not at the same position as the valve.

---
I've had this problem for a bicycle. As far as I remember the ''feeling'' of wobble changed depending on added weight to the seat. / weight distribution.

Ride characteristics was not that much influced, although it was quite annoying to feel that your wheel has excess ''spin'' / weight all the time. For smaller wheels this could be less noticable, as the wheels are not as big. But Im not so sure, so someone might correct me.

[/quote]

I think it is an even bigger problem the smaller your wheel gets, due to the fact that the total weight becomes usually smaller while the valve stays the same. That is why on a bike you usually don't feel the valve at all - the total weight is large in comparison to the valve.

https://core.skike.com/img_pool/thumbnail/263RTMGZAR78QU61-169.jpg
That is the wheel and you can see the 5 small holes closest to the center. That is where you can fit 4 M5 screws as a counterweight - which does not need to be perfect anyway. Anything will at least improve the situation.

These skike hub holes seem to be very handy for placing screws in them and thus limiting the imbalance caused by the valve

----
Agree about weight importance of valve. For my wheel valve seems to be even bigger/longer than what bicycle's have, as it has an angle, too.

Im not that good at physics (dont remember the formulas) - but there was a thing related with anglular velocity at different points / diameter of the wheel

So someone with better understanding of speed / physics could correct me and point out why exactly it is worse for smaller wheels.

I somehow messed up the concept for small vs big wheels and which one of them needs to spin faster to achieve the same speed in terms of km/h or mph, so that's from where I made my assumtion that it could be less worse for small wheels.

Here's an illustration for that.

http://www.cap-ny153.org/Propeller%20Rotational%20Speed.gif

So I asssumed it could be worse for bigger wheels but did not take into account that smaller wheels has to spin faster to achieve the same km/h / mph (I hope im not wrong on this one)

Hello from Trampaboards!
We use stick on lead weights to balance the wheels. They are standard in the car industry. Some riders used coins to figure out the weight needed. You can buy some lead stripes and strong double sided tape, eg. mirror mounting tape.
Wear some gloves, don't touch the lead!
The non split rims, having no flat inner surface to stick the weight to, are not so easy to balance. The whobble is really intense because of the small size. The small wheel spins so much faster at the same speed, compared to a bicycle wheel. The wheels high rpm is the issue. We should consider selling some balancing weights.

its a known annoyance for the old evolve boards - comes 100% from the heavy valve and its quite easily balanced with the typical 5gr motorbike counterbalance adhesive weights. you get them in great numbers for pretty much a few cents on ebay. on my evolve, a weight of 15-20gr counterbalanced the valve, leading to a much smoother riding.

the new evolve gt wheels have included counterbalance weights to the valve within the rims - pretty cool imo! :slight_smile:

I put three M5 screws and nuts through the opposing holes in the rim - that helped a bit as well.
It is definitely noticeable but compared to the vibrations with standard wheels on rough ground not that bad.
And cruising throught the forest is hella fun :smiley: - only the decreased range (like half of what I usually get) is annoying (time for my spot welder to arrive ;))

Hi Gordy, just place the weight opposite the valve.
On our Superstars there is a spoke in this exact location, since it is a 5 spoke hub. So you have to split the weight in two pieces and stick the half's left and right of the spoke.

So an update on how I got on with the Skike wheels.  I got them machined down by a local machine shop and they ran into an issue when one of the wheels shattered on the lathe.  Luckily I bought 6 so had spares!

Unfortunately I discovered they weren't going to work for my deck as they touch the deck in extreme leans.  So as I don't fancy face-planting  I will have to go for smaller wheels.  :smiley:

I even tried mounting my trucks in the normal way instead of drop-through and 3d printed some 10mm risers to try to give me the clearance.

@gordy I was about to suggest making cutouts in your deck, but that's probably a little harder with the beer can board! Although you could pretty easily soften this angles with a dremel tool and then paint them. Are you using Paris 195s? They have the most room of the "commonly available" trucks and motor mounts are available for them. Don't give up too easily on pneumatics, you'll love the ride.

I could go through all that, but the only reason for going with the skike's in the first place was to allow more room for battery clearance.  The space of gained with the truck mounting change is more than enough I think.  I am waiting for the wheels/batteries to arrive in order to test my theory.

The skike's were also going to need a ton of work balancing them, so it seems a lot more work for not a lot of gain.  I will keep them for the meantime in case I change my mind :smiley:

Anyone else try these 5" scooter wheels? Inflate to 80psi and seem to be working really well. I just had to press the bearing out and respace them. They bolt right on standard truck with no modification and are about $26 shipped state side each with the bearing,wheel, tube, and tire. 

No wobble(@ 22mph anyway) and they ride great. I'm 6'4 @ 200lbs and the ride quality was night/day just swapping the front only.Working on a modified avenue trucks truck pad suspension of some sort for the rear now.   

Pretty cheap if you buy 100!

Interesting wheels. Though i see a bit of complicated design, if one wishes to attach a pulley to these.

Not sure whenever simple 'bolts through spokes', design would work here

I’d think drilling the center of the cheaper steel pneumatic wheels out completely to say 80mm or so would be the easiest route. Then use some sort of strong epoxy that glued the pneumatic wheel to the urethane wheel. Could even go a 1/2 to 1/4 mm shy and press them in with epoxy. 

 Again though for $50 you can get the spring loaded pad and truck from avenue for the rears. Just file down their truck a bit for your motor mount and run urethane on the rear. And run the cheapie pneumatics up front.

Not a pneumatic wheel, but a solution for hub motors and a much softer ride.  I welded up a little plate onto the avenue trucks mounting plate. Then bolted on my E-hub motor/truck assy.

 I drilled 3 additional 1/8th” holes in the bend of the spring as it was initially too rigid. The ride quality isn’t as good as having 4 pneumatic wheels, but with the pneumatic wheels up front and spring suspension in the rear, it’s a BIG difference! 

I’m trying it out on the new WOWGO  board. Sits a bit high for my liking. I ordered another drop deck to swap out.
