# Help me upgrade my board&rsquo;s drivetrain

I would like to upgrade my boards drivetrain.
Currently I have Caliber II trucks with eskating motor mounts, 6355 sensored motors with 9mm pulleys.
I would like to change to 15mm CNC pulleys (along with belts etc).
I am thinking about these fatboy pulleys as they come with a bearing https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/fatboy/products/fatboy-wheel-pulley-set-for-flywheels?variant=12394675535965
This will mean I will need to change to TB218 trucks since they will not fit on my trucks and I also have the option of switching to 6374 motors in the future.
Currently I am using MBS 100mm AT wheels, 15motor pulleys and 36T wheel pulleys but may change to 107mm in the future.
Do you have any other suggestions?

Yeah, I have been thinking about them but along with @psychotiller mounts they come out at 300€ + shipping + import taxes (which will be at least another 100€) so it gets pretty expensive. Still I would love to get me some.

Dude.
I
HATE
YOU

Not only am I going to buy surfrodz and 107mm ABECs, I rode an evolve GTX (with upgraded battery) yesterday that was on AT wheels and it felt so smooth over rough stuff and cobblestones, I am now thinking about @psychotiller sixshooters.
Right now I am about 11Wh/km, what kind of energy consumption can I expect with pneummies?
My range in more than 50km with 12S5P.

I'm not sure, I'm yet to try out @psychotiller   6shooter. I've only ridden wheels like that on gravity powered boards.
@mmaner would be a Good person to ask.

I'm honestly scared to try out @psychotiller six shooters. Get spoiled and not be able to go back to urethane
I can't remember which EU web site it was but one of them still carried adjustable base plates for surfrodz reverse Kingpin trucks. (Noone here does)

I see what you mean.
Price wise there is not that much difference though. Considering that six shooters include pulleys whereas the 107mm ABECs do not it comes out at almost the same price.
On the other hand PU wheels can't get any flats and I don't know how much of a problem that would be with the six shooters plus the additional maintenance (pumping up the tires).
In the long run maybe six shooters may be cheaper though as the cost to replace the tires is a lot smaller compared to a whole set of ABECs
I guess like everything in life it's a compromise, you just have to weigh you needs and expectations to make a choice.

And then have second thoughts and also buy the other choice :roll_eyes:

I've considered the same points choosing between pneumatics and thanes. Less maintenance and better performance for thanes(torque and range-wise) while comfort and better off-roading for pneumatics.

I don't want to be stuck with a board that I can't use if I only go with pneumatics not not pick up a spare tire and tube which I feel is a deal breaker if I can't grab an extra replacement tire.

Probably going to take @mmaner's approach and get both :laughing:

Also @skunk is good at getting you to just buy stuff. One of these days I'll probably bleed my wallet dry after looking at the moonshine decks He's gotten me staring at :drooling_face:

In all reality Sr trucks have so many baseplate options that after you get your truck dialed in there's not a ton of need to adjust them unless you're changing your riding style on a regular basis.
The big Advantage I see to them is if you decide to switch your entire setup to a different deck you, may want different base plate angles based on the deck. @Wraith

Yeah to keep my expenses on builds in check I don't plan on building a new board from the ground up but rather just deck swap between 2 or 3 decks to get a different feel/ride and just make the time to outfit it based on what I need or when I need it instead of having a separate board ready to go for each occasion. Save me some cash though not sure how long I can tell myself its worth putting off a complete new build :neutral_face:

sorry didn't mean to derail your thread @taz but would consider the six shooters. I owe @psychotiller some support and more importantly money lol his wheels speak for themselves and I recall @mmaner getting around 3k miles before actually getting a flat when running over an object(can't recall what it was) 

I'd get a set but the hubs I've got aren't compatible with the six shooter tires/tubes yet but He's putting a newer version together from what He's hinted

He's got those green 107s now. 
If you do maintenance to keep chunking from happen you can get crazy miles out of urethane.  @Deckoz use a super  glue on his wheels on a regular basis for maintenance to prevent chunking from happening.

yes, we of the queens english (not really :slight_smile:) use imperial standards.   

I get about 28 WHM on my Bludgeon with 6 shooters, but Im a bigger guy and I'm running 25mm belts and pulleys.  Im guessing I'd get 23-25 with 15mm belts and pulleys.  I average 15-18 WHM with thane.

although I think 28whm to 15-18whm is a considerable jump. Where do you plan on riding most often? that may help tilt the scales in favor of one over the other

It takes a lot more lightning to turn big wheels, but the ride quality makes up for it.  I honestly can't think of a single thing about 6'ers that I don't like.  The tooling is great, the tires and tubes perform really well and are inexpensive, they are frikkin gorgeous, bets ride performance of any numie out there, they are 6 inches so you get a lot more road feel than other numies....

When you buy a set of ABEC FlyWheels, you expect a lifetime usage of some about of weeks.  When you buy 6'ers you just change out tires and tubes every once in awhile.  They are literally lifetime wheels.

Thanes are great on nice asphalt and will feel like a numie(my best guess) but on anything less than those ideal road conditions, probably better to do your feet a favor and go with six shooters. I'm guessing size and weight(slight) isn't a factor you're taking into consideration?
```

I do prefer thane, for 10 mile rides and most days.  For unknown terrain or 20 mile rides I go with the 6'ers almost every time.  

It's a matter of drive vs. ride.  With thane your 2 inches from the ground and your 'riding' the deck.  With 6 inch wheels and the level of comfort they bring your 'driving' a vehicle.  

A good analogy would be my vehicles.  I have Tacoma a Charger and a 77 CJ7.  When I wanna go fast I drive the Charger, when I wanna carry tools or whatever, I drive the Taco, When I wanna get wherever I'm going anyway I wanna go whether that be grass & mud or Mountains I take the CJ7.

My favorite is by far the CJ7, but I only put 2,000 miles on it last year.  I put 24,000 miles on my Taco.

It's also a daily preference thing.  I decide on a whim which board I wanna ride, recently I did a 16 mile ride on 90mm thane.  It was hell on the feet but still fun.

No, not really.
As I understand it six shooters are not heavier than 107s and my board is a beast in any case (11kg).

![20180917_161758|666x500](upload://vhWFdQOvMDPSZC58vr6ffUYAiny.jpg)

As long as it is carrying me and not the other way around I got no problem with a few extra grams.

yeah you're probably right, another reason to get them I suppose? :grin:

Nice build by the way, looks like its seen lots of shredding and no chunking on the mbs either which leads me to think thane generally will last longer with your riding which is good! 

btw what handle is that? I've been thinking of attaching one to my deck but still considering what options are best.

Don't let the tread wear fool you.
These wheels have a little over 300km on them. I shaved them on my lathe since everyone was raving about how much better they were shaved. Waste of time in my case since I can only tell the difference on ultra smooth roads.
The handle is this https://eskating.eu/product/ruk-handle-for-electric-skateboards/
and it makes carrying the board a lot easier.

the image on the link looks diff from whats on your deck for some reason or maybe its just the perspective :thinking:

looks nice though! did you mount it as described on the enclosure bolts? I'd prefer to reduce the amount of bolts but don't know if a few bolts can support the weight on a heavy deck. I assume I'd be getting about the same weight as well. did you have all 4 bolts through it?

It's the same handle.

![20180917_163335|374x500](upload://iJcAUw2BYIWCsDmRVQfYRhCOBQ2.jpg)

It was mounted by Alberto at eskating.
I had to modify it a little bit though as the bolts tore through the plastic. I opened new holes at a location where they also went through the fabric.
So far it has been holding ok.
If you do get I suggest you do the same thing from the start to avoid any problems.

Order for Surfrodz trucks with mounts + SixShooters placed.
Now I need @psychotiller to contact me for a couple extra items I will need (belts, pulleys etc).
@Wraith
I am sure I will love them.
Ever since I tried pneumatics I can't help but noticing every crack and rough surface I go over with my board.
I also hope that they will help with the longevity of my board considering they will greatly reduce vibrations.
@fottaz  has done a fine job with my build and everything is tight but there are surfaces like cobblestones that will eventually start taking their toll on my board.

Finally if I don't like them I can sell them to you for what I paid +10% :sunglasses: . Of course in 3 equal 0% interest installements.:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Totally worth it to me. I actually bought a hat before ordering my trucks or mounts lol.
I really like his press fit mounts. No more messing with clamps. Much easier to get true and keep mounts lined up.
Keep in mind you're going from $30-$60 cast trucks to $150-$200 precision trucks. It's a big upgrade.

Not really. That info is all on his site.
I want to use a 16T motor pulley with a 60T wheel pulley. This should require a 350mm belt.
I want to use 15mm wide transmission but all that is available on the site is 12mm.
Also I need to know what colors are in stock for the trucks etc.
Small details like that.
