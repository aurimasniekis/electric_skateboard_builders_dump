Hello guys, first, sorry for the large number and options, but is the only way to gather the data to conclusively identify the main causes of belt wear

PLEASE READ BEFORE VOTING

First, for this study i'm only interested in completely failure where the belt ruptures and are no long a continuously belt like the picture bellow

AND DO NOT CONSIDER BELT BREAKING DUE TO DEBRIS

My theory is that the internal fibers loose strenght due to high average load and if the interface with the rubber is weakened due to water and excessive bending due to the use of a idler 

unfortunately i can't test all the variables by myself, so for that i ask for everyone help

The main variables for this analyse :

-Single / dual drive
-Less than 5% hills / more than 5 % hill
-Always on dry pavement / wet at any time
-Idler pulley / No idler pulley

if possible also comment or your personal experience

Thanks

So heres goes my experience

currently i use a single drive with a 12/36 gearing and an 19mm idler pulley, my belt lasted approximately 100km

it ruptured a day after i rode my board practically under water, and when it ruptured i was slow  and barely applying throttle, lots of times if ruptured just after it got wet

before the 19mm idler i was using an 13mm one and was breaking belts much more quicker

since this is my commute vehicle this is getting to expensive to buy belts

my next board will be a dual drive to ease the stress on the drive train

Here is my experience:
Dual drive
15/36 aluminum pulleys
No idler
9mm belts
Tension loose
More than 125mi
More than 50% riding hills
Dry conditions 
I have gotten a lot of small rocks stuck in my belts
I have never had a belt break.

I could be wrong but I think that running the belts a little loose is key to prolonging the life of both motor bearings and belts. 
I believe it also reduces motor heat and increases range.

I tough that too, and it seen to help, what i don't get is how people with bosted boards that use a 3M belt with a 17/50 gearing that has to be very tight to no skip manage to make the belts last more than 500km

Another thing that could influence is the 12 teeth motor pulley, the radius is to small and crack the glass fiber. i use that so i can keep the wheel pulley farthest from the ground to avoid the lots of rocks that i have to deal

Im pretty sure the problem is the 12t pulley. At that size the bending of the belt in both directions because of the idler make the belts wear and break also the 3:1 ratio means more tension on the belt with relatively few teeth in mesh.

With 14t 36t no idler. 9mm belt. M belts last at least a couple months everyday riding 15miles/day with 10%+ hills. That's averaging nearly 1000 miles!

This is with belts from polybelt.

I agree with @Namasaki ... a little loose....I have enough tension so that it looks taught ... but if you push it with ur finger it kinda bounces .... I also check by holding the motor and then trying to spin the wheel .... it should engage nicely on all teeth but kinda gets slack on one side...only a little ....
That's how I have my belt..and that's been on since last year and it looks fine....broke a belt once...because of a big rock

I plan to test that, unfortunately the pulleys are pretty expensive so it will take a while since i have to build my next board, more than 36 teeth on the wheel and i practically touch the ground, and less reduction and i can't climb the hills on my comute 

Maybe the idler don't have a big influence, most of the time the radius is greater than the idle bearing because it's on the relaxed side of the belt

i think the next step is to try 12/36 without the idler

And what about boosted? maybe a 3M belt can flex more sicne its thinner

yea 36t htd5 is the biggest that will fit on 80mm. you need 90/97+ for a 40T/44t

on 14t/36t I can go still get up most hills. some slow down on longer ones.
gearing can only get you so far tho. with a 190kv 6355 or 200kv 5065 on 8s and 80mm wheels I was crawling up any hill but topped out at 20mph. 
I think your setup is just being pushed a bit too hard in one direction. ie not efficient. 

i tried 12/36 wit no idler but between the m3 set screws and no keyway, either the teeth would skip, or the pulley would spin on the shaft.

I agree, my next board will have better cells so i can increase the current a lot, i'm pretty limited right now with a 230kv motor on 10S, high gearing is the only way

It will be a dual 5055 190kv on 10S, speed is not my goal, i limit my VESC to 30km/h anyway

Mechanically my board it's pretty solid, appart from the belts,no problem with the pulley, and pretty efficient too, even almost all the time full throttle i average less than 9Wh/km with hills anda heavy back pack (90 kg total)

I personally like 15mm with no idler. You can run them loose and still get all the braking power you need. I would also venture to say 15mm belts have less drag than 9mm belts for the same amount of stopping power (meaning no belt slip). The key is having 6 teeth in mesh. Also steel motor pulleys are a must because the smallest amount of wear in the teeth means less belt grip.

From these top photos ..it's telling me it's too tight. The flat tear looks like stress from being pulled apart....may need to go with a fatter belt

@Titoxd10001 i'm already running 15mm and hardened steel pulleys, the aluminium one was gone within a month, and with the idler pulley teeth in mesh is not a problem 

@Michaelinvegas yes, i had belts breaking from rocks and you can clearly see where the puncture was made, but definitely not too tight, a have a generous amount of slack, if you want i can make a video

Here the picture of the teeth, they look pretty intact, this is from another belt

my belts last forever (>1000km), but i mostly ride at constant speed a lot. never lost a belt just like this - has always been due to debris working itself into the belt and then weakening it at this point.

running 99% in the dry
no real hills
15mm 15/33T with 190kv and 90mm wheels

my belts are very loose too, just at the edge of skipping!

i think a loose belt is the key. a belt actually gets hot when its too tense, so it really cant be very good for its life.

coasting is so much better with a loose belt and that energy loss with a tight belt gotta end up somewhere (and it hast to be taken in by the belt for the most part).

I think saul hit it on the head. The 12T pulley doesn't engage enough teeth and i bet it shreds the belts. My evolve started to shred belts, I found it was due to the teeth wearing down on the drive gear. Do you use aluminum drive pulleys?

```
The belt breaks on the tight side which is the side being pulled by the motor, if the tensile strength is overcome by the tensile force it will shear. This is combination of the smaller pulley (12t) creates a small radius of curvature around the pulley so the belt basically is stretched a lot on its outer edge while the teeth side is probably not stretched. In addition the small curvature has less teeth in mesh unless the pitch is also very small and the belt is thin.
Basically the only way to fix this if you stay with that 12t, to get a thinner belt wider belt.
If you increase the pulley radius it allows for a bigger curvature meaning less bending stress on the belt and on the outer side of the belt. Plus it allows more teeth in mesh. 
Making the belt wider allows for more tension dispersion along the width of the belt.

@whitepony exactly, my best experience was with a 3M belt, there was almost no drag, but it skipped like crazy even with a lot of pre load

@Fiori no, hardened steel, what's the teeth count on the evolve?

@wmj259 I just done some calculations, I'm well below the breaking strengt, my 15mm belt should be good for 4785 N, but my setup loads the belt with a theoretical max force of 267 N, that's a lot of headroom 

I think is safe to assume that my problem really is bending fatigue of the fibers, since apparently I'm the only one that has this problem and only one that uses 12T pulley

@chuttney1 if enough people answer we can identify what are the major causes of belt failure and avoid them

@Fiori thanks, it really depends on the load and the diameters relation to determine how many teeth in mesh

From my experience a big hit (gap in road or pothole) or very heavy vibrations can cause belts to break. I'm not exactly sure what is going on there. I don't think the belt is scraping pavement either since I run larger wheels. Not sure if anyone else has had the same experience.

Most likely the the wheel loses contact to the ground and spin up rapidly, and when the contact is back all the motor inertia is transferred to the ground via belt, this put a huge stress on it

most of mine ruptured in a particular patch o very bad pavement that to make it worse is the steepest part of my commute

Not sure will it fit your setup.. im using mountainboard and with small wheels it is an ease to even take off the belt without removing the wheel.

it is definately stronger.. Though it tends to make a little bit of noise if tension is too big or if the belt rubs against the side of the pulley..

--

To be honest, the rubber belt ''snapped'' similar like in your pics you showed.. so I think it was partly due to shocks received and too much tension you had on your belt.. it had been running fine for let's say 200km before it broke on these nasty ''tiles'' I was riding on

It cannot be seen in picture easly but it broke on ''tram line'' blocks as the gaps were quite big in between the blocks.

@Pedrodemio on one of your pictures i can see that the type of your belt is called HTP (High torgue power) and not HTD (High torgue drive). I don't think it makes a difference but maybe somebody knows more.
 
@Okami your idler forces the belt to bend a lot in the negative direction. Could be a bit too much stress. And which wheels do you use exactly, they look interesting.

@Ackmaniac i made the reference to the wheels in the post about chinese wheels / hubs (maxid was an active participant in that thread)

Here you go;

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/100-set-of-4-6-pneumatics-wheels-sign-up-now/14383/129

**The price needs to be ''beaten down'' quite a lot for them to be a viable option I think, so someone should come up where to source them for cheaper (hubs itself)

----

Im not sure how but the previous owner somehow did come up with them.

The hub/centre seems like is taken from ''mobility vehicle'' shop, at least I found them listed there, seemed like the exact same hubs im having.

The tires itself can be easly sourced from china for the size im having.. I believe it was something like 6 - 1/4.

For city use they are quite good.. not too large but still manages to absorb impacts and go over uneven surfaces just fine. The tire profile is ''slick'', the tires have little grooves and there is a bit of curvature for the tire, so mostly the mid section touches the ground.

Though - they do get a bit warm while riding and I think tire swapping will be needed in future, as the drive wheel gets ''beaten'' / used up a lot more than the rest of the wheels.. Im not sure how many kilometers can be made with them but so far I think I might have done about 100-150km at least. 

Can report in the future when the time comes to switch the tires, as unfortunately i dont have super precise distance logging options available to determine lifetime of these tires and the pressure.

@Pedrodemio So far i have already 'lost' 3 steel wires.. due to friction I have with the pulley since my alignment and motor plate is not in the best shape.

Though the belt is still going and I think with rubber belt I would have suffered some damage already as these fabric cords does not hold the belt as good as these steel wires, I think!

Though, as it can be witnessed, the steel cords/ wires still get torn apart with friction but I think they might manage the stress better and keeps the belt 'not as stretchy' as rubber belt might be.

So I am quite ''satisfied' so far but I also see now how important it is to get proper thickness for motor plate in the first place and not mess with bendy plates.

The problem with steel is fatigue, in a belt the wires are exposed to a lot of load/unload cycles, and as you described they should be on the fatigue limited region and will rupture no matter what

i have no idea how glass fibers respond to fatigue

You are probably right. Best thing to do is minimize belt tension and maximize the size of your motor pulley. Taking a stiffer material for the belt will help with the belt tension, but not at all for the bending stress when going around a pulley.

The idlers worked great, felt smooth, and didn't wear the top of the belt really, but they were positioned to tension the slack side when accelerating, and they both broke when braking, one one day and the other broke the next day. The second belt I broke sheered in half when just braking gently.

I've gone back to running without idlers, as I've never broken a belt without idlers. I wanted to buy mounts made for idlers, but this has me worried if I'm going to be breaking belts more often. 

Is it more common to break belts when setup with idlers vs no idlers, or do you guys think maybe something was wrong with my idler setup possibly? I just used 2x 608 bearings that fit my 15mm belts perfectly, roll was smooth.

Lots 9f people have had that issue, you can mitigate the issue a bit by running them super loose. This situation the reason I got away from Idlers. Proper belt tensioning FTW.

Agree with that, design your drive train with enough teeth in mesh and select a Kv accordingly 

@skatardude10 if I remember correctly the gates design manual says that the minimum idler diameter for HTD5 is 30mm

And to give a feedback, my new board I’m running 14/34 15mm wide, never changed a belt so far, probably 350km or more

I believe that part is due to the larger wheel, part for not have ridden in the rain, and part by using dual drive and spreading the load between two belts
