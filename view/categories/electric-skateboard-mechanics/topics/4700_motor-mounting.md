What are your opinion on where to mount satellite motor/motors? Under the board or with them sticking out from the board like on many mountainboard builds? What are the advantages/disadvantages?

If you have a kick tail deck you would want to mount the motor to be sticking in, If you have a dropped deck there will be more clearence if you have the mount sticking out backwards.
