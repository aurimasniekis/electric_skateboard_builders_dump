Hi!

I have opportunity to produce upgrade sleeves from 90mm to 110mm. They will be produced in one tire factory in EU from same hardness and tire material like real car tires. I could go with softer or harder material on those sleeves, but first I would like to try real car tire hardness. Sleeves will be „barrel like“, wider in the middle, 110mm on widest part.

Installation is very easy: just glue sleeves on 90mm hubs or 90mm polyurethane wheels and you are ready to go.

Price will be 30-40 euro for set of four tires.

Target market are normal, mostly non diy guys with chinesse hub boards. For them, going AT is not possible, but cheap, easy and effective upgrade like those sleeves could give them something between normal and off road board. Also, they should last much longer than thin polyurethane around hub motor.


In my opinion:

Positive sides of upgrade sleeves:

* higher top speed (because of bigger diameter)

* softer ride (especially with hub motors) – probably most important upgrade

* tires should last much, much longer than thin polyurethane sleeves around hub motors

* cracks on the road won't be so noticeable

* possible to install on cracked or worn off wheels or hubs



Negative sides:

* more weight

* less torque (I think it could be noticeable on chinesse boards with limited esc amps)

* higher battery consumption (tire is softer than polyurethane, which means higher rolling resistance) -This is just my guess, will have to test to see how noticeable it will be

* hub motors will heat more (this is also just a guess)

* some decks will need higher risers



So tell me, what do you think about this idea?

[poll type=regular]
* I like this and I think it could be meaningful upgrade for chinesse hub motor boards
* I think idea is stupid or unneeded 
[/poll]


I need your honest opinions and suggestions what could be different/better.

well there are already some of these types flying around. But they produce alot of vibrations, probably because of the holes. But i still like your idea. Will the Glue be included?

yeah I know about these skullboard tires. now ownboard has them too. 
my tires will be from different material and without any holes and vibrations should not be problem. 
I think glue won't be included because anyone has or can get super glue in any store.

Contact between sleeve and wheels is whole wheel surface + glue. Surface friction and glue should hold them in place. I won't start selling those until they are tested and I'm 100% sure I won't risk someones life.

i dont think regular superglue will hold under temps of a hub motor. 

to give you an idea, loctite superglue has a flash point ranging from 80C - 93.4C

@Tinp123 is there a way you could make an entire wheel instead of just a sleeve. Maybe with a abec/flywheel core so everyone can just slap there pulleys on it.

There is always a solution (This might be a bit overkill)

you can get 107mm flywheels, I don't see need for whole new 110mm wheels. 
there are some people whose hubs last no more than 200km on really bad roads. I'm sure my sleeves could help them with that. 
and about glue, I will try first with superglue. I will measure temperatures on hubs, and see if there is need for stronger glue. 80-90C seems like really big temperature for motor. 
I will talk with guys in tire factory, I know they use glue in some cases.

I think your idea has merit, but I would be reluctant to buy cheap chinese hub motors so that I could avail myself of your product. That being said, i think you might find a market for it with existing owners looking to upgrade their urethane.

Yes, first I want to try with superglue. if it won't work, I will try with something stronger. I believe sleeves could work even without glue (because of high friction between surfaces), but I won't risk it. If you have any suggestion what to use instead of superglue, I'm ready to hear it.
@baxter it would be stupid to buy chinese hubs just to use sleeves. sleeves are meant for people who already has them, or has old, chipped hubs and they would like to use them again. I see reddit is flooded with people who use chinese hubs, but I am asking this diy community because I know you will be harsh if you think this is stupid or won't work. and that is exactly what I need, honest opinions

I'm actually surprised that nobody has already offered this before!  If you can get your thane recipe, and molds right, I am sure there would be a market.  Perhaps reddit or facebook or another non technical forum might be a better place to gauge if there is any interest. :)

that is good question! inner diameter is 89mm instead of 90mm, but I could go smaller than 89mm later on. if wheels diameter is smaller than 89mm and it won't hold sleeve one, thicker adhesive could work here. or I will have to make all sleeves 87mm or less. those will be harder to install on 90mm wheels, but since it is elastic rubber, it should be possible. for now I am just collecting opinions and interest in community, I will have to test those sleeves with different setups and wear and tear before selling them.

for now, only 90mm. those are most common hubs. 97mm maybe later, because meepo has 97mm hubs now too.

Miswrote to @Benjamin899 ; @Tinp123 Do you plan on selling **only hub sleeves** and we need to match corresponding wheels ? Or you sell a **pack** sleeves + front wheels ?

I suppose inner size is 90x55 ? What is outer size? Is it round or flat profile with rounded edges ? Based on your schematics it looks like "slick" type tyres. No radial lines ? 

Btw are you sure under hard carve / corner or even a slide are you sure J-B Weld glue is sufficient to keep the sleeves from tearing from the PU ?

no Hummie Hubs for now :frowning:
@Vanarian plan is selling only sleeves in the beginning, without wheels. maybe later I could include front wheels too, or maybe whole 4 wheels. I guess it won't matter if wheels are original abec or chinese copy.  
yes inner size is 89x54. but it is possible that I will have to modify mold for less than 89mm, so sleeves will be harder to install, but they will hold stronger to the wheels. 
yes they are "slick" type tires, with widest outside diameter of 110mm. no radial lines and no threads, because making mold for them will be few times more expensive than mold for this simple tire and benefits would be minimal. 
I'm not sure sliding is healthy for any type of wheels or tires, and I don't know how mine will hold when sliding. that has to be tested. 
before they went out for sale, I will ask few guys here for help with testing. If sleeves won't hold as strong as I hope they will, I will abandon this project.

I am definitely interested since I already have a cheap chinese board that I would like to improve.
I don't know how difficult it would be to make some prototypes but I'm willing to try one for that price

Try using a urethane or silicone based glue. The glue is  gluing two flexible things together so if you use a non-flexible glue (such as cyanoacrylate aka superglue) it will create stress concentrations and ruin the bond. Superglue will also set too quickly when you try to slide the wheel on. I've worked a bit in soft robotics fields where there a lot of gluing of soft molded parts together. 

[Sil-poxy is one possibility that might work](https://www.amazon.com/Smooth-Sil-poxy-Rubber-Silicone-Adhesive/dp/B00NGZHGFI/ref=asc_df_B00NGZHGFI/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=216766339349&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4243903377101827140&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061191&hvtargid=pla-367030410871&psc=1), but a flexible urethane based glue would likely be better. I'd also recommend adding a small lip to one end so you have some alignment that means the wheels have slid all the way on. 

 For 90->110mm change your board will feel about 80% as strong in acceleration.

```
yeah, you have some valid points about super glue. I will ask guys in factory which glue they use for tires, and will probably go with that. 
and idea about small lip is great! this way, every sleeve will be perfectly installed. I will see if that will make price of mold much higher, but it shouldn't 

@TheFluffiest price for a set of four sleeves will be 30-40 eur. 

those 3d printed sleeves looks cool, but I don't think they could last more than a real tire.

Just some advice but I would advise against using rubber as it will increase friction and thus resistances. This will give Chinese boards with already saggy and low ash batteries even less range than they already have. 

Urethane would be a much better alternative imo, probably cheaper too

yeah battery life is one of my concerns written in first post. Once I get molds, I could try harder tire material. But who knows, maybe even car tire hardness won't have such a big impact on battery life? that's up to tests.

Actually the bit soft rubber compound is a good idea. If it makes for good balance between more grip, bit of deformation and low friction, it will help turn some hubs into something more aggressive, given ESC and batteries are appropriate. 

Hummie do use nitrile rubber for his hubs and these aren't weak in any way.

trying to get prices from China for only metal part of replaceable PU sleeve for hub motor, so I could make whole rubber tire instead of PU on that metal part. But they reply slowly or ask for really high prices for metal only. I will update this thread when there will be something to update.

I machined up some Slick Revolution 110mm All terrain wheels to slide on my generic hubs and due to the thickness of the PU, it fits well on the hub with just with an interferance fit, absolutely no glue needed. 
For my purposes the 110mm wheel set up is way better to ride on road surfaces than the original verreal board 90mm wheels. I would even go 120mm but there comes a point when the height of the wheel will interfere with deck/feet. 

There is certainly a market for a 110mm generic wheel

I’d  definitely be a customer for this type of product with my 90mm hub motor equipped meepo although due to the lack of life changing feedback for the backfires thicker PU sleeve from 83 to 96mm I wonder how much of a difference or large scale demand there actually is for a product like this.

Sorry donta42, wont be doing the slick rev modded wheels for a while. Too busy with other stuff. I do recommend the 4WD setup.  Even with the large diameter wheels I have acceleration that will throw you off the board if you are not careful.  I can transverse pretty thick grass and even going up grassed hills at good speed.   Overall a very useful board for my travels which involves going thru hilly parks,
