So I have @marcmt88 reverse mount long plates on my Surfrodz trucks, i measure 100mm center axle to center shaft and im using a 16T 15mm wide drive pulley w/ a 36T 15mm driven pulley and i was curious if a 335-5M-15 belt would be the right match.

Hey Brandon,
I recorded as 345mm for a long arm with 16/36t setup.  I recommend mock up your setup and wrap a string around drive pulleys and idlers to confirm.
