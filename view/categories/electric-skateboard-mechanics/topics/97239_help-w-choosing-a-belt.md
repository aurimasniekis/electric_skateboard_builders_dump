Hi
It is my first build and here is my situation.

 I have this motor pully: https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F322328974649

And am using a 36T wheel pully w my 90mm flywheels. Currently I have a 265-5M belt that is 15mm wide, but it is just a little too small. What belt size do I need with these parts?

Thanks!

I just went and filled it out but it didn't tell me the length. It gave me pitch diameter for each but not length

What motor mount are you using?

Edit: you need the teeth count for both pulleys and the center to center distance
