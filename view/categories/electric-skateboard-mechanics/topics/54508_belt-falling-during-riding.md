Hey guys!
Having a trouble with the belt slipping to the side... when I test everything the belt stays in place no matter what I do, but when I start riding it suddenly slips to the side (away from the pulley) !
If I stop and align it properly and spin the wheel off of the ground it stays in place, I start riding and after like 10 seconds it falls of again

Any idea what can cause this?

Sounds like a misalignment. Could the mount be loose? Video of spin by hand and spin by remote would be helpful.

If your mount has flex, then under load the belt will move away from the motor and towards the wheel... not sure what would cause it to move the other way other than permanent misalignment.
