 I've had this board sitting around in pieces for around a year as the motor broke, the cheap motor mount broke as I rode over a bump and the motor came free and didn't handle the impact. This board was originally a Fiik Rager board and I swapped out the deck.
  It's a really nice cruiser and I'd like to get it back up and running to use as a filming board. I film on electric skateboards using them as a dolly track and this setup is great for indoor and smooth surface filming. I'd like to get hold of a replacement motor that operates quietly, has no problem starting from a standstill and has great low speed high torque performance with precise control.  

Any motor suggestions would be much appreciated :)
