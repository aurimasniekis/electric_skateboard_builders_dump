Very cool setup, don't think I've seen anything quite like it before. I'm looking forward to seeing the full reveal.

Whats different from most builds besides the idler? I do like the look of the pulley (from what I can see anyway). It looks like a more elegant aluminum version of Enertions pulley.

The wheel insert is usually attached to the wheel. This wheel insert is mounted to a modified truck so there isn't very much play in the drive system.

Yea but it just looks like the wheel was taken off. An enertion pulley would look like this too if you took the wheel off.

I thought the design would allow for quick wheel change which would be far more convenient.

That hasn't been my experience with the enertion pulley - I've gone through two pulleys and they both had a bit of wobble - could just be me though. Here's the video of the old one for reference.

It's also supposed to reduce belt misalignment and tensioning issues.

No, you're right. There is slight wobble, especially when there's no wheel, which is why this looks more elegant, but not unique. Usually though, if you put the wheel and nut on, wobble is pretty minimal to non-existent.

To your point - I'm not sure what this will add in real terms by itself, but hope to see it aggregate to a great final product. It's nice to see small inefficiencies being eliminated. From my own experience, and what I've seen in other boards posted here, small issues can cascade on these boards, something as simple as belt rubbing on the wheel or a loose nut on an enclosure can quickly lead to bigger problems.

In terms of the enertion insert - the skate bearing inside the insert is up against a washer, which is against the hanger. Here it looks like a bearing is actually mounted to the hanger, and not the axle, so it's different in that way as well.

I believe the hanger themselves are machined to allow a bearing to sit on it and this makes possible to put the pulley bearing closer to the inner edge where the stress really is. The motor axle has an extra bearing to support it designed into the mount which also keeps everything aligned. Plus the idler your looking at least 3 bearings to keep everything aligned.

@Jinra The drive pulley is mounted directly to the truck hanger. All the drive force is directed into rotational motion since there is no cantilevered forces or flex at play like we see in the popular plastic drive gears.  The addition of the idler pulley also puts more teeth in mesh which reduces tooth wear and increases the load potential of the drive. The effect this had on acceleration braking power is insane!

That sounds amazing! Will you be offering the mount as a standalone product?

A complete dual drive kit with motors, wheels, trucks and motor mounts/drive will be available for pre-order soon. There will be a 2 to 3 week lead time on fabrication.

Would the trucks be wide enough to accommodate dual rear setups with your motors? (or shorter motors would do)

Only dual diagonal in this configuration. We can accommodate a dual rear using other trucks but the cost will go up. You also want to consider that a dual rear unbalances your board and can lead to the rear end icing out while sliding or cornering hard. Not really an issue at lower voltage but this drive is fast at 10 and 12 s.

Aw cool!  So you could basically choose your own board and battery pack and still get the benefit of ollinboard innovation on drive train?  2017 is going to be the best year ever!

I'll have this in a week or so!  Will be posting more photos/videos of how this drive train works soon.

@guyguy does. He has an Ollin Freeride and has posted numerous photos of these motor mounts.
