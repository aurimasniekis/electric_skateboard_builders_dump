I already took off the snap ring but the pulley is completely fixed on the shaft. 
Any idea of to replace it?

Also how do I make sure it‚Äôs fixed when I‚Äôm putting my new pulley back on?

Thanks so much!

As in heating the pulley up? Does that work?

That's what I was suggesting.  Tends to loosen things, plus makes metal expand, so if it is just stuck it should help loosen.  I'd be careful with the motor and all ..

Looks like there's a tool for that, too https://metro-board.com/shop/motor-pulley-removal-tool/

Yeah that is one option, often helps loosen up the pulley a bit, however another way that you could try is how I got mine off.

Mine were stuck on my shafts quite tightly due to the keyway and the dust and stuff that had gotten in there.  I sprayed a bit of WD-40 in the pulley keyway and around the joint and let it sit for a while.  I was eventually able to wiggle each of them off.  Cleaned it up real good and it is perfectly fine now.

Automotive stores like Orielly‚Äôs have tools like this for cheap.

Lots of heat and one of these will do it.

Most automotive parts stores will let you borrow one.  It's a pulley puller.  Hook it to the back of the pulley.  If you pull from the front you will just rip the front of the pulley off.

How is the current one fixed?  Are there any grubscrews or a keyway?

There is no key way or subscrew. Seems like it‚Äôs pressed fitted. Or maybe there‚Äôs just too much friction.

If you have a vice you can always hammer out the pulley. 
Use a screwdriver or a center punch and give it a few taps with a hammer. I've never had a mount bend or anything weird like that.

Not yet because I can‚Äôt get the puller yo hook on the back of the pulley. There isn‚Äôt enough clearance between the motor mount and the motor pulley for me to stick the puller in between.

if there's very little clearance, a screwdriver as a prybar may be your friend.

The motor shaft? Probably not, it's really thick. I would first try twisting a flathead underneath as that'll give a fairly vertical lifting force. If it doesn't budge you should try heating it with a heat gun (or a lighter for a very long time) and see if that loosens it up.

I bought the gear puller from Oreilly but somehow the pulley seems to be completely stuck. Tried pulling from both top and bottom of the pulley and this is what happened. 
It seems like there‚Äôs a tiny key way in there but there‚Äôs no way I can reach it. Any idea?

I used a flat head screwdriver and that‚Äôs how I ripped off the bottom of the pulley. Seems like it‚Äôs fixed somehow.

Have you torched it yet? If it's held on with loctite, that might be the only thing that will get it to budge.

Update: the pulley‚Äôs both ends came off after I heated it up but the teeth part remained stuck on there. ![image|374x500](upload://kmeIRbPnOmrC4AZpeLvDWXvfmHh.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://3yPEpZIrIpGffjmk1mKEWw9DmrE.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://ArtEE4s6DJiGY4aBMBXm5IDFueb.jpeg)

I first heated up the loctite with a torch that can go up to 2500F. I then tried to remove the pulley but only the darker pieces come off leaving the aluminum teeth still on there. I took off the motor and found a key way but after unscrewing it the whole pulley is still completely fixed in there. No idea why.

Yeah but right now I‚Äôm not sure if the part with keyway is together with the pulley or not. Idk if I should attemp to remove the pulley or with the black part altogether. 
Yeah the loctite was smoking and the red turned brown kinda

Take a Dremel to it, and cut down one side. Screwdriver in-between, and twist.

If that won't get it off, cut down the other side ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Dremel/rotary tool or multi tool even hacksaw (if you can cut straight with it).  Cut straight down along side of shaft, do your best not to cut into motor shaft.  You‚Äôll end up taking 2-5 teeth off exposing part of shatf.  Heat it up again and pull that bastard off.
