I've been in the market for just one Caliber truck to mount my motor on, since I already have a really nice Paris truck in the front and I don't want to buy more than I need. I asked Dexter if I could buy just one from him and he was cool enough to offer just this single truck, which as far as I now is the best option for new builders like myself who are trying to keep their costs down. Bundling this with his other items and his flat rate shipping could really save some dough.
