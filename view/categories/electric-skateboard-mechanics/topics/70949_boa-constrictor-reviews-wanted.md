Hello there, I have two possible routes to go with wheels soon and I want some feedback.... do the Boa constrictors ride as good and soft as 74 or 75a ABEC thane? Only interested in ride quality, these are purely for comfort!

I have the black and green abec 11 97mms and they feel very similar to the red boas. Weird thing is that boas are 83A, and abecs are 74A

Yep. But i'll go with the Boas if i'm on a longer ride. I'm using it for my dual drive, where my 97s are on my single drive.

But do note, the Boas have a bit more urethane so it's heavier than the 97s. I've not tried the 107mm Abecs so i can't compare them. But i'd say in terms of weight the Boas will be similar to the 107s

```
Boa are offset while Abecs are centerset, offset wheels will always be heavier for the same width because the design calls for more thanes.

Another example is that the 85mm Cags (offset) are slightly heavier than my 90mm Arc wheels (centerset).

Yes the flywheels are center set, I believe superflys (107mm) are offset as well though. 

I come from downhill longboarding as a background to this, so I can definitely appreciate the difference this makes, thank you!

Have both and 100% agree here.

The kegel-style cores are physically stronger.

As far as wheels that are available to buy right now, I'd prefer the Boa.

Indeed. I already have caguamas, but am upgrading my entire board and want some wheels that are better for rough pave and cruising so I can race the Caguamas and thrash them.... I am thinking these are the way to go. Now, red or white? Is there a difference in quality?

I think i remember reading on here sometime ago that different companies can call their different durometer products any number(within reason)... I think i saw it in a boa vs abec thread?

Can someone confirm :thinking:

No.  [Durometer is a scientific measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore_durometer) just like meters or watts.

But durometer is also very subjective to feel because of different urethane formulas. I've learned this from downhill wheels

The feel of the ride is very subjective -- but the durometer is definitely not.  It's a well-defined scientific measurement.  I think there is another property of polyurethane that affects ride quality a lot, but I don't know what it is.  It might be what one manufacturer calls "rebound" but I'm not sure what that is without a definition.

## \#19 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2018-10-12T19:29:28.782Z Reads: 156

```
Manufacturers seem to make up their own duro number n not put it to a standardized test


Rebound gets u the long roll with low rolling resistance (more miles per watthour too).  Itâ€™s test is the easier and the percent something will bounce back off a slab of the material being tested. .  The test is more standardized than that but thatâ€™s the general test

With so much being subjective itâ€™s probably safe to say any wheels made by aend industries are better!  It would be a trade off n you canâ€™t have durability n rebound and low duro but aend are known to make the best

Duro maybe measures the deformation by a force n rebound a measure  of that energy lost to the material as heat or returned by the material when force removed.  I think youd feel duro and only experience rebound in a long roll but not feel it

I'll leave my two cents on the Boa's. They are my favorite wheel I've' ridden. Here is something I noticed when I rode the 107's. There is this little pothole in my neighborhood that I usually avoid but I clip it every now and then. With the 107's I felt like I was gonna die when I hit it, like the wheel almost stops. With the Boa's they seem to just bounce over it. I definitely felt the pothole but it just bounces over it. I've noticed it with railroad tracks and small lips up driveways and sidewalks. Bottom line, I've ridden them since I got them in june. Zero chunks and are super grippy. Beware though these things will kill you if it's slightly wet out.

no ETA on 90s was provided at this time.  good hunting.

A lot cheaper and better than a car.

The question is, do you value your safety?  How much is it worth?

Don't get me wrong, I like those wheels (I'm for the looks, remember?) but buying a Harfang treaded wheel is like buying a wheel more than twice the price of a competitor (100mm MBS). In that case better jump into Pneumies and there you have all the needed safety your money can get for an Esk8.

Nope 100mm is the perfect size I was running Abec 107mm for a year once i put boas wonâ€™t be going back they ride Amazing and they have  Way better grip they slide a lot less than the 107 I would never go back to 107,  I actually switch all my build to boas wheels

It really depends on the roads you have in your area.
As much as I liked my thanes when the tarmac was good (10% of the time) I fell in love with pneumies the first time I tried them on an Evolve board.
My commute is a 20km roundtrip and the roads involve cracks, road works, cobblestones and some pieces of tarmac so rough that will make your teeth fall off.
I can now ride faster, a lot safer and my board will last a lot more due to the massive reduction in vibrations.
There are downsides as you mentioned but the advantages outweigh them by a big margin (in my case).
