So I got these drives yesterday and immediately installed them, it was extremely easy, all you need to do is cut the motor axles 12mm and install the motor gear with Loctite 680.

I paired them with 6380s 170kv @torqueboards motors, pretty much the same power rating of the APS 6384 motors. 

The gear drives are 4:1 and come with a pretty nice matte black powder coated hanger, bearings, oil seals and all required hardware, just bolt into the Trampa hanger and you are set. 

Big shout to my friend @kaly for such a great piece of hardware.

LoL it's just marketing-jive.  Once all the axial direct drives (Carvon, TB, ??) are out, then this will be a bigger deal so we should get used to calling them correctly :smiley:   We have a nice short name for radial direct drives already ("hub motors")

I think Alan is too nice to do it but I want to believe he did this on purpose.

I‚Äôm waiting for this, pretty impatient :smile:
I read a lot about the differences between the belt and the gears and the pros and cons, but in particular with this gear drive how are you? noise and smoothness? the question is: is it really all another world?

You guys do get that "The Gear" is slang for drugs like Heroin right?

@Andy87 probably does. @pixelsilva did you know?

I guess its different everywhere,

You say moonshine, Russians say Semogon.

It's safe to say that in a lot of places "The gear" stands for some kind or kinds of drugs.

The 'Heat' stands for the authorities, the police, or law enforcement when they are onto someone. 'Heat' means chasing the criminals.

What do you mean by that you had to cut the motor axle 12mm?  Are you referring to cutting the motor shaft?  I've ordered a set from Kaly in his next batch.

The part of the axle which comes out of your motor need to be only 12mm. If your is not longer all is good. If no than you need to cut it.
ü§î I speak about the motor axle all time....
