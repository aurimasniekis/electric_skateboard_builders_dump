I had my vesc in a box under mounted for a while on my DIY carver.  I have been wanting to move the box up to the top of the board.  How is everyone doing it?  I see alot of build pictures of builds but not alot of how the box is attached to the board.  Do people use the existing holes? drill new ones?  What are the container that everyone is using.

You either get a flexible enclosure or put a box between your legs or the angled part where the trucks are

Thanks Dave and Acido.  I do have an ultrabox.  What I am trying to figure out is how people are attaching their ESC boxs to the tail.  I am trying to avoid drilling more holes on the deck.  Battery was easy with velcro and straps but I am still looking for an elegant solution for the ESC box.  I see plenty of pictures on boxes sitting on the tail but 2 things are still open questions for me...

* Most of the top mounted builds are mountain board, I want to top mount on a carver... 

* Do people drill more holes?  Do they leverage existing holes and just put screws through the box?  Would love to see a close up picture of how its done.

Its a silly question but I'd like to see how others are doing it and the devils in the details here...
