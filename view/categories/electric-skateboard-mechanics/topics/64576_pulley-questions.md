My board feels a bit slow (I'm more confident in my electronics now). The motor/board doesn't seem to want to go faster than 24km/h.

These are the gears that I have on my board right now: 36T at the back and 15T at the front.

I figure going smaller at the back will give me a higher top-speed, and going smaller at the front will do the same?

I'm ordering some other bits from diyelectricskateboards.com and I figured I would get some new pulleys ("pulleys"?) from there. Looks like 36T is as small as they go. My only option for going bigger on the front is a 16T 15mm.

_(argh @ pointer in the image :()_

Is that going to make much difference? Is it 16/15 difference?

Thanks for your advice in advance!

Think you'll be better off finding a 18t for the motor.

@JLabs (buildkitboards.com) has some 32T pulleys in stock

I have a 15mm wide belt which is limiting (at diyelectricskateboards.com). 16T is the highest it goes.
Also: I'm in New Zealand so paying for freight once is important :).

I guess I could buy a 12mm belt. It's going to suit my 36T pulley anyway, right?

I kinda want some 18t myself now that I'm playing with the speed calculator.

```
15T - 36T is the _The Facto_ standard in this hobby. A lower motor pulley teeth count with less than 15T is not recommended. Less teeth cause the belt to slip, also cause belt breaking in the short-term because the belt narrows too much. With 36T wheel pulley you get the best of both worlds: decent speed and good torque (for going uphill). 

When you widen the pulleys ratio (example: 15T - 40T, 15T - 44T or 15T - 50T) you'll get considerably more torque  at the expense of less speed while preserving belt integrity in the short-mid term. When you narrow the pulleys ratio (20T - 32T or 20T - 36T) you'll get a speedier board while improving belt aging in the long-term but it will considerably lag in hill climb due to its neglected torque.

Great info @pixelsilva thank you.
I've still got alot to learn. 
I have 15t 36t and 16t 40t now for my 107mm wheels.  But have been thinking of getting 18t for the 36t or 20t for the 40t.
Almost no hills were I ride.... lots of flat

Then 20T - 36T or 20T - 32T will be your thing.

Sure Kelly, any time. :wink::+1:

I plan on keeping my 36t on my front wheels and 40t on the back (and belts in my bag)
So I can swap them around and figure out what I like.

Well, I'm not so sure if that kind of hybrid configuration will really work (??)

I'm rear drive. The pullye will just be ready on other wheels so I can try 40t than swap wheel from front to back and ride 36t on the fly.

I will leave your 16T - 40T untouched. Use that for your torque applications. Change instead the 15T - 36T for 20T -36T (upgrade to 20T) if you want to get more speed. But use that configuration in both dual diagonal truck installations, which seems the one you are using.

I'm lucky that I'm pretty light, and not heaps of hills so I don't think I need to worry too much about torque. Also my motor is a 125kV which I think means it's torque-y to start with.

To be honest I'm a bit surprised that the top speed is only 24km/h (not mph!). I'm wondering if it's because I don't often fully charge my 10s5p battery (way more capacity than I need) and maybe it's just sag.

Speed seems about right with that motor. I think there is a point where low kv is less efficient than a higher kv with high reduction. Where that point is idk. With less reduction you also lose torque/brakes. Here is estimated (95% duty)

Instead of upgrading the pulleys I would actually change the motor, for the same price you could get a Keda 190kV from HobbyKing. It is unfortunate that you must pay extra shipping since your outside the US

Hmm... I _literally_ just bought a second one of those motors (125kV) to make my board a dual-diagonal setup. Nuts.

24km/h is ok 95% of the time (commuting).

I was wondering if I was just getting to max RPM.

You bought the Keda or 125kv turnigy?

I have the 125kV Turnigy that HK were selling in the eSKateboard kit a while back. I'm not a speed-demon and light so it was/is fine for me. I just wanted maybe closer to 30km/h for some straight/wide/clear bits of my commute (sometimes in traffic).

You'd probably need 18t-20t motor pulley or bigger wheels

or 190kv motors will get you to 40km with pulleys you have

I have 83mm wheels. Maybe this is the motivation I needed to buy 107mm wheels (gasp).

I guess 90mm wheels will me 24km/h * 90/83 = 26km/h. Crap. :slight_smile:
24km/h * 107/83 =  30km/h. "Win!" (but might look silly-big on the Truncated Tesseract).

107s will get you there. That's what I have for 50km/h+ with 190kv motors. They're big wheels though and I would recommend a drop deck so it doesn't sit to high

Yeah, wheel bite is something that occurred to me as soon as I looked fondly across at my deck.

24km/h is fine enough. _Fine_!

Hi, I have a question close enough for this topic I hope, I am not sure about. ANy suggestion would be very much appreciated. How do I mount a motor to this mount? (It's the only mount by Trampa that doesn't have 4 holes on each side the same distance from each other as all other mounts do. I wanna fit this motor
https://eskating.eu/product/eskating-pro-motors-6374-190kv-waterproof-sealed-and-sensored/
to this mount
http://www.trampaboards.com/12fifties-carbon-fibre-motormount-panel-with-motor-axle-support--pulley-kit-for-gummies-wheels-twin--p-25686.html
(Those holes are not in a square pattern as the motor's holes. Thank you
```
