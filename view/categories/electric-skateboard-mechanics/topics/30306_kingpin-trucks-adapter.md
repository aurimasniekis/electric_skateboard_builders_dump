Why not just get calibers and easily accessible mounts.

@Djawho I've recently used these trucks in another build: http://dosimplecarbon.com/first-dsc-longboard-ever/
And I needed to adjust the motor mount because of the middle rib in the trucks. I imagine this would be the issue in your case as well.
