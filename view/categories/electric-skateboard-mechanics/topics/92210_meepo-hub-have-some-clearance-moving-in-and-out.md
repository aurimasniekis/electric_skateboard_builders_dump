Hey guys, I have a problem with one of my meepo hubs... I found some clearance on one side. I can move one hub 0.5 to 1mm in and out!

Where could it come from? Has anyone experience with these hubs? @rey8801 maybe? 

Is tuere a retainer missing or something? I donâ€™t get the other hub teared down unfortunately ðŸ˜‚

Can you move only the stator or the whole hub left and right?

No, I think the stator is fix. canâ€™t move it...

Usually they are bolted it the truck with 4 bolts and nuts. Did you check them? Because of the stator is fixed then has to be the whole hub that moves. Is the movement along the axles vector or I understood wrongly?

It moves in this direction.

No itâ€™s just the â€žcanâ€œ that is moving... looks like the spacers inside (Can/bearing/stator/spacer/bearing) has changed. I took the hole hub with me and take a closer look tomorrow when I have the right toolings at work. Super strange. The Can(or wheel) can move 1mm over the Stator.

I got a spare hub set as replacement for cheap if it turns out unusable ðŸ™‚ replaceable hub version, based in Germany

There was a small seal ring inside to Create soft pressure against the bearings. (Very cheap solution). The ring slided over the place where it should sit. This created the gap between stator and the can... i just pulled the ring back in Position and now it should work. I ll find another solution for this.

I placed the distance ring between the two distance washers... this should solve this problem.
