I bought motors to big for my trucks...I have 15mm for a motor mount and sprocket set...should I use a 0.25in steel plate with countersink screws and #25 chain or a motor clamp and a 12mm belt?

[poll type=regular]
* Steel and chain
* Clamp and belt
[/poll]

This style of clamp but metal![image|628x472](upload://x6QrXUc8aUD5IbQcHyLamv6KPYF.jpeg) https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d7/6e/94/77/6d/Cim_Motor_Mount_preview_featured.jpg

Jet get a belt setup, belt slippage should be "none" if setup correctly, and if your extra scared of slippage use idlers...

Whats the best belt I can fit in a 15mm gap...12mm belt and a u-clamp for the motor?

Why not to mount one motor front facing, one back facing?
Or diagonal drive?
```

```
There are some mounts out there with fat clamps (you want lots of clamping area for rigidity) and thin sections where the motor mounts.

9mm belts are an option as well. It's not recommended for single drive, but with dual drive neither belt is as stressed as a single.

I theory I can but the distance from the motor can to the ground is only 3/4 in...is that safe?
```

Idk if it‚Äôs safe. Depends how much clearance you need...how much clearance have direct drives ü§î
If you worry than go diagonal.
Front truck, back truck.

I didn't get around to adding them but it is a dual drive, although its geared for torque, do you think they will hold up to really aggressive acceleration?

Using a 1/4 in plate for the motor mount I only have 8.5mm from plate to wheel so I need a c-clamp mount to get even a 9mm belt, have you seen that type of mount before?

No really was just an idea. If you don‚Äôt like how it looks you need to find other ways to mount them.
Or just sell your motors and get smaller ones üòú

I'd absolutely hate to sell because they are the MayTechs that were on sale for 60% off and they're so nice

TBH I'm just confused and upset because I have no idea what I'm doing anymore...the numbers added up before but now they don't

An option I considered at one point was to stagger the motors - Have one in front of the truck, and one hanging out the back. 

It's like a dual diagonal, but on one truck.
The maytech motors make it a tighter than other 6355s, because they've got that nub sticking out the back.

Ah ok you already have 6355 motors.
Thought it‚Äôs 6374 size.
Just if you calculate your battery max output it‚Äôs like 
12s x 4.2v x 80a = 4032 Watt 
So with two motors rated to 2200watt you would have the same power than with two motors rated for 3400watt

Unfortunately I think you've kind of backed yourself into a corner. If you can't go staggered or diagonal, you either need wider trucks or shorter motors. There's just not room for mounts and pulleys in there.

@Bobby might as well

Personally I don't like belts but that would probably be okay, margins are still tight, I'd get a mm for each wall and or total clearance

```
It has a tendency to torque steer under heavy acceleration or braking. Hit the gas and it'll veer one way, hit the brakes and it'll go the other. You can compensate, but it feels funny. Also you end up with long wires, either battery or phase, which can somewhat increase the chance of damage by voltage spikes.

(This is regarding one motor per truck, not two motors on the same truck but staggered.)

Ah okay, that makes sense then.

If it's off grabcad, it's my 180mm wide model for. The Paris trucks.

Get yourself some 195mm Paris trucks. They handle equally as well and will give you proper clearance. Trust me, this will save a ton of headache and it'll save you money in the long run. If you want one or two trucks, I've got some lightly used black 195's with your name on it.

Currently you're running on 0 space left lol.

Thank you I tried my best :innocent:

I'll give em to you for the shipping cost, they've just been collecting dust since I got some calibers.. They've got a few scuffs around the bolt holes and some light paint scratches on the hanger, hope you don't mind.

Nothing a sexy matte black paint job can't fix ;)

You have no idea how much I'd appreciate that!  With 16mm I could put on anything from 12mm belt to duplex #30

Also scratches and scuffs are nothing, the bottom of the board is covered in salt so its not like its noticeably, and those hardly count as scratched
