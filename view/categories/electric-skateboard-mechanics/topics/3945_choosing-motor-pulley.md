For a single drive you want 12mm or higher (if you can find it). 12 is fine.  i thought your question was about gearing not belt width

12mm will work fine, 15 to be safe.
9mm on single drive works unless you got a lot of hills in your area.

9mm also works on hills if gentle with the throttle and sub 70kg

Less friction and the possibility of using two bigger motors  because not so much space is used up by the belts

I'm 85kg, have hills in the area and generally go easy on the throttle in favor of range. I have no problems with a 9mm belt except for some occasional skipping when hard braking.
