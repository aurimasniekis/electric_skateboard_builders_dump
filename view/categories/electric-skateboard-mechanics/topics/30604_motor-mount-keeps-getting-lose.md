 Here is my motor mount and clamp from Torque Boards:

For some reason, even when I loctite the grub screws in the clamp keeps getting loose after about an hour of riding. What can I do?

Thanks

Punch a mark in the centre of that grub screw hole on to the truck, (obviously take the screw out first)b, take off the mount then drill into the truck about 4-5mm. Throw lots of thread lock in there then tighten up. Should then be solid.

you should use a drop of locktight, if too much it doesn't dry well. and use high strength, no med blue stuff

if you use loctite, let it cure overnight then tighten them again in morning.. this worked for me i wish you luck.. i realize waiting that long is not practical, i constantly scraped my motor on the ground till i did this however also i had to ride a street tighten ride and repeat this for awhile

great idea @darkkevind

Also thanks @onepunchboard I was using a lot of loctite so it might not have dried well

@trancejunkiexxl I brought an allen key set just incase anything happened, and tightening it up was a quick fix.

Make a shims out of steel or aluminum. One to go on the bottom flat spot, and maybe a shime made out of shrink tube or copper for to rounded top. Also don't bolt the clam to the truck with the mount  arm screwed to it. I also replaced my clamp locking bolt with a better hardware. Definitely needs to be shimmed.

I made my shims out of spare change I left on the train tracks. The pennys turned out real thin, and flexible. Then I used some files, and my rottory tool to clean it up.

Make sure you are tightening the screw in the correct order. You want the bottom and one side the be flush against the truck and the open space taken up by a screw on the other two sides.

I'd also suggest having a decent hex screwdriver that way you can actually screw it down with some force.

Make sure your belt drive setup is 100% aligned properly because it could pull your motor mount left or right.

If it's setup properly, you shouldn't have any issues.
