I've got this bug to build up a three wheeled electric dirt board using the frame of a old electric scooters.

You can find  suitable donor scooters for under 50 bucks in all states of repair. Best case the scooter battery pack and motor are in working shape. The next step in finding a suitable esc for it. I know Vesc can drive a brushed motor, and I have one laying around. But I was looking around I found this little guy.... 

https://www.ebay.com/itm/High-Voltage-HV-Speed-Controller-brushed-waterproof-ESC-24V-W-reverse-RC-board-l/281477350334?epid=630449884&hash=item41895b83be:g:wYMAAOxyhS9Tfqfw

Normally these little scooters run any thing from a 250w motor to a 1000w motor, and draw like 30 amps under load? This looks like it could work out  well. Maybe a replacement for some of those older eskates you see floating around that use brushed motors. This unite uses the ppw stranded  so it will work with the new eskate remotes so those with old boards with wired remotes could upgrade. 

There a good chance that I'll want to upgrade the battery and motor to brush-less down the line. But if my donor scooter is in good shape I'd be happy to run the old system into the ground before upgrading. It's ultimately going to be a funky "mad max" a dirt-trike board so I'll like favor torque over speed, and If it's fun to ride I'll keep working on it.

What do you think. Is the hobby brushed motor esc linked  a good fit for are application? Would I be better off  to run the VESC in brushed mode?

Smoke 'em if ya got 'em. I'd go with the vesc, it's just so much easier to troubleshoot and configure, plus you already have it. And you can run stupid overvoltage to the motor no problem.

So after doing some web searchers just looking for a good frame to base this build on I came across the Trideck. From what I can tell the Trideck can easily fit a scooter or bike hub motor in rear, and has plenty of space for a battery pack if you're creative. It even has a built in bike style foot brake. I've done some searches on the forum but it looks like no one has built a board using this deck yet. Looks like the this would be a good base for a cheap light duty all terrain board. Retail price is like $230.

One possible motor choice. 
https://www.uumotor.com/uuen/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HUB12SF-390x300.jpg

Running some number, and it looks like if I can find 1000rpm motor this thing will cook with a top speed of 25mph to 35mph. I ordered a trideck on Black Friday and got my deck for $224 with shipping. I'm pretty excited about this build. Think I'll make it my winter ride.

No. You must run something sicker on this. JohninCR's hubmonster, MXUS V3 Turbo. Or Edge / Leaf air cooled motor. Or Q205 motor ? With the lean layout it would also do great as a scooter / seated scooter.

That's impressive I wonder if the 3 wheel design makes it more stable at speed? Looks super fun but looks like it would be heavier than a mountain board.

Stock it has to be under 22 pounds. Motor and battery should push it  a little past  40lbs. I'll be able  to run the wheels at over 100psi so I hope it will just keep on rolling.

I'll look into those motors.  I'm limited to 12" tire, and a motor with a drop-down spacing that fits the frame. I won't know what the spacing is untill I get it in my hands on the Trideck.

That one has a single wheel in the front, and all the turning happens at the rear truck. Thats a pretty bad set up for a three wheel deck. Like how many cars use only their back wheels to turn? None that I can think of. Really that's a fucking ass backwards build you are showing right there. Did you even watch the posted video the of the trideck? It looks pretty responsive to me.

Just joined here, but I have been looking at the Trideck for a while, thinking of ways to convert it for the specific purpose of (don't laugh) running my dog. Must have the ability to run on sidewalks and even dirt paths, and I keep coming back to the Trideck as a starting point. I contacted Laurie at L-Faster because she has some pretty cool e-bike and e-scooter conversion kits. I'll be following this thread!

Not a trideck build but very similar. It was called a outback board, and I think it's out of production now.

Just received my trideck, and I measured the rear fork spacing or dropout. The dropout on a the trideck is about 100mm. Time to find the fastest hub motor that will fit in the space available.


On option rated at 500w. Could overvolt it a little, and run more amps from the controller

I ordered one too, and expect delivery tomorrow or Friday. I am leaning towards a hub motor setup, too, but haven't ruled out a belt drive setup similar to this:

https://www.l-faster.com/items/1650w-oxelo-town-9ef-scooter-customized-motor-kit/

From what research I have done, it seems like skateboards are typically controlled using a 2.4 or similar receiver with a (V)ESC controlling the motor(s) for simple, handheld wireless control, whereas most hub motor applications utilize an ESC/controller in a box with a lot of wiring for a wired throttle/brake, battery indicators and other readouts/displays, usually for ebike-type applications. I want to do a hybrid where there would be a hub motor but with skateboard-like control. I understand that a hub motor draws/uses more power (or amperage or whatever, I have a lot to learn); how would this affect how the motor is controlled?

As I understand the Vesc can handle up to 60amps, and up to 48v but 36v is "safer". I'm not really sure how to calculate the ERPM  for this style of motor but that's something to be mindful of. From what I can tell these hub motors pull anything from 20amps to 30amps maybe more before over heating. We will need to balance you volts and amps. More amps means more torque, more volts means more speed, and more of any of these mean more heat.This is just a general rule Ive seen around. Check out https://endless-sphere.com its all about ebikes and such, and has a lot of info on hub motors.

The motors I linked to is rated for 500w. Watt=volts Ã— amps. So a motor feed it 36volts at 20amps you get 720w of power.  Bike hub motors can take a lot more then rated so you just need to be mindful of the heat.

Thanks so much for the reply. When you've warmed up a bit(!), can you expand a bit on the math? The voltage (24, 36, 48, whichever) is determined by the battery; the ESC then sends this voltage to the motor, as regulated by the throttle, correct? Does the ESC also control how many amps the motor sees, or is the amperage draw a function of the motor's operation? Let's say, for example, that I am more concerned with torque than top speed. Is it a function of a programmable ESC that I allow the motor to draw more amps and thus give me more torque, or is it the case that a lower voltage battery (let's say 24v) allows the motor to draw more amps and thus provide more torque? Sorry for the basic questions, but in the research I've done it's almost universal that hub motors are powered by control boxes that also have wired throttle, brake, LCD display etc. as would be typical on an ebike application, whereas skateboards seem to be universally controlled by an RC ESC or dedicated (V)ESC and wireless/radio controller/recieiver. Finally, how are you determining how much power (watts) you need? Are you using a calculator to project weight/speed/climbing ability? Thanks again, hope this isn't annoying!

Sounds like you need to do some reading. A Vesc and a bike esc are basically the same thing. Just with different features. You can build a ebike with a Vesc, and a board with a bike esc. The Vesc is nice for a board because its wireless.

Now about volts and amps. The more Amps you pull the hotter everything runs. A 24v system will pull more amps and generate more heat then a 36v system doing the same work, and as you go up in voltage the less amps will be needed to do the same amount of work. 

The whole wattage thing is kinda fuzzy. The math is kinda just there so you can see how they get that number. The more watts  a motor is rated for the more it can take before overheating. Some hotrodders will drill cooling holes in the sides of their hubs so they can run more amps without over heating the hub. 

Each battery has a max amp that it can deliver, and sometimes the manufacture states the amps a battery is rated for on the packaging or in the documents. I'm planning on using a ebike battery with a switch and a key.

Its rated at  48v 20ah with a 30Amp discharge. 

From what I've seen in the ebike forums It's always better to run a higher voltage motor for speed, and with as many amps you can handle for all the torque. With out the amps there the motor will bog down under load. This is a electric bike simulator and can give you a idea what you can expect. http://www.electricbikesimulator.com/

This is my first ebike hub motor build, and only my second board build so I'm learning as a go.

Very cool, and I'll keep reading. Sometimes I read too much and end up knowing less than I did before I started. The point you make about ease of work makes sense though; a car with 100 HP can go 80 mph, but it'll be working a lot harder than a car with 400. I think the distinction I was making between the bike vs skate ESC was more about that big box with all the wiring for features I don't need or want; I understand that the basic function of each is a motor controller.

I want the lightest most streamlined setup, and I'm even willing to do some cutting and welding and deck fab if I have to... I have a lot more skills with the mechanical stuff than with the electronics... I'm old(er) so I have a couple decades of bike and car building, welding, basic machining, etc.

I've even been thinking about scratch building a Trideck like thing with a tilting deck with a descending element attached to tie rods that would steer the front wheels so I can optimize caster/camber geometry, even a rudimentary suspension. There are lots of cool ideas out there. But for now, the Trideck!

Thanks!

Just finished making a 8ply deck for my trideck. It need a little sanding and sealant. Starting to think I need to make a bumper/skid plate for the front. I've got a few ideas on that.

I've reached out to a hub motor manufacturer and they on a nice little hub motor that will fit the frame and can hit speeds of 24mph+. It's rated at 500w, and a tops out at 1000rpm. http://www.peipeiscooter.com

That looks perfect! I got my Trideck, and the dropout on mine is a little less than 100mm, around 96mm. Close enough that I can spread the rear forks apart. I'm now thinking of running a VESC and 36v. I have found some slim battery packs that will fit between the frame rails under the deck and I'll mount an aluminum plate below that to protect the batt and electronics. 

How do you like the turning radius of the TriDeck? I'm a little concerned, especially without the pole/handle in place...

Ya I'm thinking vesc at 36v sound pretty good, and I've got a spare vesc sit around for it. 

The new deck is a little less then 1" wider then the original deck. I'm hoping the extra inch will let me put a bit more leverage on the front truck, and help it turn a bit better. If that doesn't fix it I'll leave a little nub of a handle just for when I need to make extra hard turn. Maybe I'll mount the battery and elctronic to it. 

The king pin is a little troubling and will be a pain in the ass to replace it you can't get s new one from the manufacture. Not impossible but your need a drill press, and a stick welder at the minimum. 

The drop out is likely the same on mine. I didn't use calipers when I checked it. But ya it will be easy to cold set it to fit a 100mm hub motor.

Been looking for a motor that will fit the drop out of the Trideck, and have a hard time finding anything that will fit well.  So Ive ordered these dropout adapters for fixie gear bikes. These should give be about 5 millimetres more to the dropout, and will rise/lower the rear axial about a inch. This should give me a few more choices in the motor department. Alibaba is your friend when it comes to hub motor shopping, and double check your measurements.

This is a torque arm for electric bicycle. They  helps to reinforce the dropout, and keeps the motor from rotating in the dropouts. Pretty cheap and a good idea on this type of build.

All it would take a is couple tube clamps and a cheap motorcycle steering damper, and you would have a better high-speed set up.

Ok, I did a test fit today, and it won't fit the stock dropouts with out a set of adapter plates of some sort and, or,  some welding. I was kinda of expecting to need to make adapter plates to fit this monster anyhow. Really I just to to rise the mounting  points for the hub motor up about 1/2 of a inch to get it to fit.

I did look at a few smaller motors with better clearances but they had low watt/amp rating, and were physically smaller then this motor so I passed on them. I wanted something with a bit more pep. I'm hoping that a physically larger mass means the phub-199 will handle heat better. I want to run as many amps as i can.  Maybe 30amps? 

I've been fooling around with the electric bike simulator, and it seems that the more amps you run the less hills slow you down and the faster you get up to speed. I'm planing to run this motor at a minimum of 28amps, and it will pull around 1008watt up hill, and 510watt on the flats. It will have a range of about 27km at full throttle, and 50km at 75% throttle. 

This thing is heavy. I'm really staring to think about mounting the battery over the front wheels to try to balance it out a bit.  

I'll post pics when the adapters are done.

That's some huge range. Can't wait to see how the hub motor looks installed. I'm still debating a 6374 and belt drive... I don't really need more than about 15-20 mph, and range is not an issue. I've been using it a lot with my dogs and having a blast, can't wait to get it powered up. (Or for Spring to arrive!) Thanks for the updates.

Sounds like you could get away with one of the smaller hubs. I looked at the outrunner with a belt or chain.  I liked the idea of adjustable gearing you get with that setup, and I had a few ideas for a motor mount for the outrunner but...
Anyways here's a small  update. I've got the dropout adaptor, and just did a very rough test fit.

It looks like it will fit just fine. The adaptor need a tinny bit of grinding for clearance. I'll fit it properly  when I get a chance and post a update.

I had to sign up purely to ask if you have any updates. Such a great idea for a build, I really want to see how it turns out.

Did the width of the forks contribute to the clearance issues, since it looks like they extend past that little triangular attachment? Or was the motor simply too wide?

So I've made some progress and things are looking pretty good. I need to make some ultra low profile bolds to hold the dropout adaptors. Basicly cut down the heads of a few bolts tell they are about 2mm or so thick, and cut slots for a flat head screwdriver. I'll  work on the bolts some more. I've cut them down a but but they need more work beacuse they are rubbing.

So its all mounted. It was a tight fit. The rear wheel is about 3mm of centers to the frame, and
this was just a little troubling to me.

I searched motorcycle forums and it turns out that this is pretty common on all kinds of bikes, and my hub motor falls well with in the offsets seen in these models. So I'll go with it.

My question is are the dropout adaptors and torque arms REALLY needed? Ive added longer wheels on bicycles before without the adaptors and scooters too if its already offset by 3mm then maybe just bending the rear fork just a bit wont hurt but will the hub motor axle fit in the regular forks?

Well the dropouts are just under 100mm, but the bearings housing rub the fork arms if you mount them in the original dropouts. So for this motor I had to rise the dropouts by 1/2in or so to clear the frame. It would be possible to machine away some of the housings, but I dont own a lathe.

As for the torque arms, well not strictly necessary it does make the whole dropout adaptors set up safer. If you find a hub motor that fits stock I'd still use torque alarms if you push more then 1000w. This seems to be the prevailing recommendations I've seen on ebike forums.

I wonder if that housing can be hit with a grinder because my concern is the ground clearance since u shifted the wheel a half inch higher the body fell half an inch lower when u turn will the frame hit and if a battery or any components are mounted underneath will they hit. I know I wouldn't mount anything underneath but turning wise how will that do? Just trying to break it down to see if its worth the project because I started a project but I would dump it and go to this instead if it can be done and thanks for all ur input on this and taking the time to answer really appreciated

I don't plan to mount anything under it, and everything in the nose between the two front wheels. At first I thought about mounting the battery under the deck but that would mean Is need  a flat style pack, and I'd lose ground clearance. 

There is no chance of rubbing the frame while turning no matter how hard you tune. In fact your end up on two wheels  long before the frame would rub the road. The difference in height is negligible. The front has about 2" 1/2 of clearance, and the back has just over 2" in the rear.

When u stand on the trideck do u notice any flex? And also what psi are the wheels that come with the trideck?

I had some flex from plastic deck that came stock, and it ended up snapping clean off. I replaced it with a 10ply deck cut down  from a cheap longboard I had laying around. 

Right now for testing I'm running 50psi in the tires. I find 12" tires have a pressure rating of 30 to 40 psi. But from what I've read BMX riders will often run 120psi on tires rated for 40-60psi. So I plan to run them as hard as possible.

From what I've gathered from other builds of this type to much pressure can make the ride feel to bouncy so you kinda need to dial it in a bit.

Yup I used to ride my bmx with 90psi and they were rated for 50psi but its different as the wheels get smaller I almost doubled my psi but on 20 inch wheels with my 6 inch wheels on my board its rated for 60psi but I like them on 45psi dont know why probably have to do woth the bounce. So what is the measurement now of the 10ply deck u cut down?

Its a 8.5" deck. Really if I had 9.5" I would have gone with it. I think there's is clearance for it. The original  was 7.5" wide. I usually ride 9"+ deck. I don't do any flip tricks so I like having the space for sliding.

At this point its time to take the motor mounts apart and make some solid spaces. The washers just can not be trusted.

This is how I plan to mount my battery and electronics. Rated for 15lbs with room to mount a headlight.  

There are stronger units but this one was dirt cheap, and I really just wanted to see if it would work. I will likely upgrade to a beefier one later.

Just a little update. Mechanical it's done, and I'm at the electronics stage. I'll post a detailed update when I have time.

Hey! Thats the exact instructable that got me to build my first board and eventually to this site. I actually posted my build and some tips to that page haha ![20180607_140803|666x500](upload://by9XNyK761IFOJMQLlkPLWo70Sd.jpeg)

Nice build bro. yeah what torque clamp did you use for the Hub motor in the rear cuz I have the trideck as well and I'm trying to figure mine out for the right clamp how did you get that clap if you give me some information on it how to get the rear torque plate for the Hub motor I need one of those as well.

Just wanted to say thank you for sharing your build, really helpful and looks brilliant, Iâ€™ve always been obsessed with trying to build an electric off road snowboard style wheeled board, I might just buy a Trideck and give it a go, how did you get on? Would love to see more and how it finished up.
I had a go this year at building a similar 3 wheeled style rear steering scooter, very rough build but great fun, love the lean to steer and turns very tight but at fast speeds it has speed wobbles, so frustrated at the moment. Iâ€™ll try and post a pic
