I am looking for a pair of 5mm pitch x 16mm wide, 15-16 tooth pulleys for 10mm shaft motors. They are the normal ones that everyone seems to use for belt drive boards.

I ordered from two companies already (Alien Power and Flipsky) and it's been 4 weeks and neither has shipped. I'm a little frustrated with British/Asian suppliers.

Does anyone know of an American supplier that sells motor pulleys? I wanna ride nowwwww üòÅ

most motors use 8mm bore pulleys, I have drilled them out before, just be careful using successively larger bits until you get to 10mm.

He's not based in the US, but @dickyho has the pulley you're looking for and the shipping is reliable although a little slow

Ebay. Timing belts are usually 5mm/10mm/15/mm wide etc. I found some belt murdering 11T 8mm bore for a TRAMPA. I dont bother with a keyway on boards, just loctite.

Hey thanks for noticing :) They are my own design, derived from VESC6 and built for 250A peak and 6kW sustained. I made them for an electric hydrofoil or surfboard. I made some extra, and since I had a few motors from testing I put them on a skateboard, which is why I need the 10mm shaft pulley instead of the normal 8.

They are exactly 5 times too manly for me. Sad part is they are for a water application, so there is no sensor inputs so they dont start as well as a sensored controller. Gotta kickstart on an incline.

Yeah I rode for an hour last night after I got the pulleys on. My roommate as well. I'm 195lb and he is 225lb, and even so they are WAAAYYYY overkill. Never rode a board with 6" rubber wheels: it's a smooth experience. I can't wait to ride more :smile:
