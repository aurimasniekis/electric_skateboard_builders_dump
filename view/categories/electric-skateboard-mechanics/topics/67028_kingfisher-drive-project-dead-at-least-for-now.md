Here is my current planned design for a nice looking functional 50-63mm motor mount.

**Renders:**

![MOUNT%20ISO|689x388](upload://r2G93qclQQkvX6tfheFpcBK2DDy.JPG)



**SPECS:**

**Features:**

22mm Idler for fantastic tooth wrap. Functions for both 12 and 15mm belt.

3d printable motor cover.

Fits Paris and CaliberII trucks.

**Pulley Sizing**

Motor Pulley:
Maximum pulley size: 20T HTD 5M
Maximum 17mm thick for 12mm belt
Maximum 20mm thick for 15mm belt


Maximum wheel pulley size: 40T HTD 5M
Maximum 29mm thick for 15mm belt (from bearing face including speed ring to face of pulley)
Maximum 26mm thick for 12mm belt (from bearing face including speed ring to face of pulley)

*This depends on your wheel pulley combo, whether it's center / off set etc. This dimension is important.


**Motor Sizing**

Maximum Can Lengths:

12mm belt with 184mm Caliber: 59mm long
15mm belt with 184mm Caliber: 56mm long

12mm belt with 215mm Caliber: 74.5mm long
15mm belt with 215mm Caliber: 71.5mm long

12mm belt with 180mm Paris: 57mm long
15mm belt with 180mm Paris: 54mm long

12mm belt with 195mm Paris: 64.5mm long
15mm belt with 195mm Paris: 61.5mm long

Maximum Can Width:

50-65mm supported.
30-38mm hole pattern supported.

**Wheel Sizing**

Fits anything up to 107mm flywheels

**Non standard hardware?** (doesn't match above)

You can still use this mount, but it will affect the maximum size of motor that you can use.

The following maximums **cannot** be changed:
Motor pulley thickness
Max pulley tooth count
Max wheel size

The following maximums **can** be changed:
Bearing to wheel pulley face distance

**How does the above affect maximum motor size?**

However much your wheel pulley is over the spec will decrease your maximum motor size.

**Here's an example:**
I'm running 215mm Caliber trucks. I want to use 15mm belt. The spec says that my wheel pulley to face distance must be 29mm thick. My pulley is actually 32mm thick.

Thus: Actual maximum motor size = (**71.5mm** + (29mm - 32mm)) = **68.5mm**

Similarly, the maximum motor size can increase if your pulley width is shorter.

For example, with the same setup except with a 28mm thick pulley: 
Actual maximum motor size = (**71.5mm** + (29mm - 26mm)) = **74.5mm**

**BELTS:**

I currently haven't done all of the calculations. But as of now the maximum length belt that could be needed is 66T for a 20T 40T pulley setup. This accounts for the idler.

**Confirmed matching parts:** (you can use these and it will definitely fit)

Definitely looking for testers!

I don't have access to caliber trucks or belts of varying sizes, so it will help greatly to have testers willing to find out recommended belt lengths, especially if I include an idler (which is a possibility, trying to have the motor plate be flippable L R.)

Interested for sure. @Grozniy  From what i understand the enertion mount is very pricey to have produced which is why even though the files are available to anyone nobody has bothered with it.  To make it viable people I have talked to would only do a huge MOQ 
@TowerCrisis I'm a little stuck in my ways and when I find something that works I tend to stick with it so if you want someone to test out the mount on the caliber/tb profile then I'm your man

Something else worth considering is a motor plate that fits the standard evolve dkp trucks to enable 63 mm motors.  With the cross members and idlers you would have some interest there for sure.  So many people are tuning the evolve platform right now because with some diy magic they turn into a weapon.

![image|690x460](upload://weRN998zGVa3LrDFIV2HlzAOQPZ.jpg)

Has a built in mount as you can see but the standard plate is just the 50mm version.  They are a really nice carvy truck though and wide enough for 63mm.  
![image|690x459](upload://hn92jzQ001ISncXstmZjSoChQNj.jpg)

The best way would be to get a mount to fit on the front truck then you'd have some adjustability and the profile is nice and square but ti does taper somewhat.

My buddy has 2 different Evolve 63mm mounts they both suffer from the same problem, there are only 3 screws that hold the plate in place and the extra weight from his 6374s makes the plates sag over time. Imo best way to make an evolve plate is with a fixed position so that the plate cannot move down over time.

Here's a question. I'm planning on having this press fit into the hole where the motor shaft goes through.

https://www.mcmaster.com/#5154t53/=1egfl2f

This means that the mount would only work for 8mm shafts.

Is there any demand for 10mm or 6mm shafts? I'm fairly certain that 8mm is standard with us and 10mm is very irregularly used for street builds (usually for AT builds). Consensus?

Good solid products with fast cheap local shipping would be a godsend to most people I'm sure.    How to run it by the wife though........I know, don't tell her.

![max%20width|690x379](upload://u3q2jnyPUJbd8b5FOvLKZoHuJJx.jpg)

We're looking at a maximum of 6376 motors (76.125mm from midpoint to mount face) using:

TB 218mm trucks
 90mm wheels
13.5mm wide wheel pulleys (from pulley edge to wheel face) This dimension can decrease for more clearance.

Is it just me or is that quite large? I haven't seen a street build using motors this big.

Since having an idler seems like a popular request, here's a potential placement. Uses an 8x22x11mm bearing.

Depicted is a 20T and 40T gearing setup. These would be the maximum sizes available.

The idler seems too deep inside, but then again I don't know efficiency losses due to this. Maybe negligible. 
Another factor is stress on the belt.

## \#44 Posted by: TowerCrisis Posted at: 2018-09-05T05:10:26.563Z Reads: 162

Whether it's deep or not, the belt still has to bend around the same radius. AFAIK this would be the same resistance as any other 22mm idler system.

Cover that fits a 107mm wheel with 20T pinion pulley with 40T wheel pulley

![cap%20Large%202|523x500](upload://Abp4PO3qasjXlO62f7rySBwF2z0.jpg)

![Cap%20Small%202|497x500](upload://pjpvUm9X3n4bVRYItIecw3hC7k3.jpg)


I went ahead and designed a belt cover. Because of the idler, the cover can extend all the way from the motor pulley right to the wheel pulley. I'll eventually make a repository of all pulley size and wheel size combinations. All free to 3d print.

I actually really like this belt cover, it's the first design I've made that I'm actually satisfied with.
It must be used with hubless motor pulleys. (or I could make a hole, it all depends on what you guys wanna use.)


Eventually I'll release all CAD files in a .step format. But not until I test this stuff.

Goodnight All!

PS: ditching the bearing seal in the interest of reducing cost.

I have a pair of Calibers and 107s for my commuter build and I like the way your pulley cover hugs close to the wheel in the sketch and doesn't leave room for things to fly into the belt.

Put me down for a dual set please!  I'll be using them on TB 218's with TB 6380's.  I have the 15mm kegel pulley from @Kug3lis.  Just want to make sure everything will fit.  They look great, how long till you'll be ready to ship..?

Likely have a functional test model working in a week or so, then probably ship a month or a month and a half after that. May be delayed from low order volume, it really depends how many. I'll need at least 20 to get an order, I'll probably front the rest of the cash once I get 10 user confirmations. I can't really give an accurate time estimate because of that.

Is that ten mounts or ten sets?

Can you show a few pics of them mounted on a complete board or just mounted?

Unfortunately 10 sets, L / R are mirror images and MOQ is 20 of any given part.

I'll post pictures once I have all the hardware to mount them. I think I have some 9mm belts with the right tooth count that I can squeeze on, just for demo purposes.

Between $75 - $100 is quite a bit, relative to the overall price that is.  What are some things that could make it much more than the $75 version?

Depends how many sizes of crossbar are needed, it has to change relative to the truck width, etc... Besides that, black anodize could be pricey, I'm not sure how much it'll affect price.

Sorry that I sound blunt saying this, but what advantage would it offer over say Dickyho mount, given the price? Tension adjustment?

Or even Marc's mounts... 

Ive already asked but it must have gone unnoticed. Whats up with the idler being so far inwards? D
That's a drastic curve backwards that the belt has to take.

Sorry my bad. The distance inwards doesn't negatively affect performance. Whether it's in or out, it still has to take the same bend radius (11mm). The fact that there's more length of belt bent at once means just that, there's more belt that's bent. What's important to designate is that it is not bending any more than other idlers that use 22mm bearings. So it should not be any harder on the belts themselves. IMO, it's better because you get much better tooth wrap on the motor pulley.

Its not performance in worried about. Your causing the belt to bend on its self backwards which opens your tooth profile. Granted nothing wrong with that from our eyes. But what you do cause is stress on the inner fibers of the belt causing them to break over time. Such a drastic tension isn't needed in our applications. Not saying you're wrong. Just my experience with automotive applications with belts.

Oh it definitely is bending the belt backwards. HTD belt is rated to a 16mm radius bend while under load. An 11 mm bend isn't great, but it is on the slack side of the belt, which helps a lot.

My point above is that every other motor mount that uses a 22mm bearing for an idler is also bending the belt just as much, so it can't be any worse.

I got it together, everything nice and sinched tight. Will post a video of it running tomorrow, I've got a spare battery and a few focboxes lying around. I'll try and strap everything to a deck and take it for a spin. Only single drive for now since I only have one functional motor.

Also out of town starting Friday - Monday, so tomorrow's my last post for a bit.

Sorry for the delay, life got in the way. Here's a pic to tide you all over, I won't have a battery for a while so no video unfortunately. But I'll post a video of a bench test soon.

Looks like it's going to cost $60 USD for a DUAL drive.

This includes everything pictured (including unseen idler bearing, and excluding belt and pulley).

One consideration is the cross bar length. It would have to change depending on the length of the hanger and the width of the pulleys... I'm going to have to make a poll eventually to figure out what sizes are in highest demand.

Final parts will be anodized black.

71.4mm - 75.4mm center to center.

Also note that due to the idler, small movements to the center to center distance can change overall belt pitch greatly, so not a lot of stroke is needed.

Also, I will custom print a belt cover for every order so that it fits your specific belt and pulley setup with minimal gap.
