I'm looking for hub motors that I can buy for a mountain board build... I don't want to build motor mounts (not sure if there is a kit for them for mountain boards) and I think hub motors would be much better for clearance and simplicity. 

I know enertion has some type of prototype for them but what are you guys thinking? Aliexpress?

Hub motors of that size would be heavy? Right? Dual 168kv wouldn't do the trick?

Hit up @nowind on endless sphere. I think he machines and sells mounts for trampa trucks.

Hud motors are heavy from my experience... Chunky center... Good wheel size but maybe motor overkill in size...I bet that hub motor is not specific to e-mountain boarding ... I bet if they design one specific... It would be less in mass and work just as well

yea there seems to be a bunch of options in terms of motors avail... my main concern seems to be if that hanger is something i can buy or if i have to make it.

Those are quad copter motors, it was a custom job.

Thanks! 

So I've I'm reading it correctly. There is a chain and a belt drive kit. 
I prefer belt because it's quieter. Have any idea on price point? Does he sell the belts/cogs? And will the kit work with any trampa full kit? 

(Not a noob, just to emtb lol)

Should work like a charm. Nowind uses the same trucks if I'm correct.
I'm sure he can sell you spare parts if needed, but he will give you what you need to order them anywhere (belts, pulleys).
They wouldn't be cheap because he is milling all parts in his own shop by his own. I would guess the complete mount is in the 200â‚¬ area.
