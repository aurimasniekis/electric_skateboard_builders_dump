Looking for ideas of how to convert an electric skateboard into an electric wheelchair. (badly dislocated knee)

Was considering propping the esk8's back wheels against the ground with weight from the wheelchair, using left and right wheelchair wheel's breaks to control turning.

Maybe setting up two remotes to individually control each back wheel in order to also control turning. In that case, I would have to forgo the wheelchair's wheels, and use two remotes.

I could also set up a new drivetrain onto the wheels of the wheelchair, but that will require a lot of mechanical work.

Wow that's perfect. Not enough trucks to mount wheels on the side of the chair, which is a fantastic idea.

If anyone has well-used trucks to sell or donate I'd greatly appreciate it.

Why don't you just make a buttboard with a luge extension to hold your dislocated knee up for you...

That’s not very cheap though. If no one else in the US has a spare pair they’d be willing to part with I’ll look up the price for shipping!

Any trucks work. Not mounting any motors to it or anything.
