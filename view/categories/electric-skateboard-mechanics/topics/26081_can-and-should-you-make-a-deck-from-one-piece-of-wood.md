I think I might be making my own deck. I don't need concaves, and any other stuff.
My question is that is it a good idea to make it out of a single piece?
I am most concerned about durability, and vibration.

it would certainly be possible but it would have to be unnecessarily thick and would be less flexible.

I would obviously buy the right thickness, and I am fine with less flex.

Do you think it would be strong enough?

sure.. depending on the thickness it will. And it will not only be thicker but also heavier. Any reason you don't want to use plywood?

I don't want to mess with glue, and clamps :wink:  . 
But weight is important, so I might use plywood...

just buy a sheet of plywood. you dont have to make it yourself. and I'm sure you can find a longboard deck somewhere for 20-30 bucks. no need to make it yourself unless you want something very specific.

Sadly I want something very specific...
My deck has to be almost exactly 90cm long, and with the biggest possible wheelbase.

The reason being, 90 cm is the biggest deck I can fit into my school locker, and I want the most stability I can get.

Although, if you can show me a deck like this, that can be shipped to europe, and still be under 100â‚¬, I would be very thankful :grin: !

My ACTON Blink deck is about 65cm, it's the 1s gen Blink board. I am not sure what is the size of their new ones.

The ciemah micro is a pretty sweet option!!!
To this point I have only found similar decks from America, and shipping from there is usually more than the deck itself.
Thanks a lot! I have been looking for days now.

Hey!
I made my own deck from a sheet of birch plywood with 15mm. Do you think is thick enough?

  Get good Baltic birch ply, not the cheap crap from Lowes or Home Depot. You will have to look around for a good hardwood supplier but it's worth it, more than twice as many plys.

That deck is awesome too, but I really want to utalize the 90 cms, and having lipos, this deck may not be for me.

Why don't you just get a deck you like that's a little longer than you need and cut a little off the nose then relocate the front truck.

I don't know...
I am afraid that having 97mm wheels, there would be clearance issues.
Although cutting off the kicktail might be a good idea :thinking: .
I will start looking. :slight_smile:

If you get a deck like this you could trim it a bit and not even have to redrill it.

I think you should buy a real skate deck, blank board without shape is awfull ride. Concaves are really an improvement in between deck and rider. Anyway this guy's are good and cheap. http://llisalongboards.com

These are the decks I have found what do you think?

--------------
1, http://www.ebay.com/itm/Moose-Longboard-9-25-x36-Drop-Through-Deck-/361953280023?hash=item544618c017:g:0F8AAOSwpP9Y70gu
(this is the cheapest I could find, sadly it comes from the US, so I will have to wait a lot...)

(still from the US, and a bit more expensive, but it is 35", and looks good)

(from Europe, but somes with trucks, and wheels. I am worried that it may result in a lower quality deck...)

36 and 38 inces would be over 90cm.

with the cheap board I wouldnt worry about the deck.. the trucks will be low quality, but I use one of those RAM boards for my electric build with the stock trucks and so far no issues. mounting the motor plate is a little trickier than on caliber trucks I guess.

I wouldn't worry about the deck itself.. plywood is plywood for the most part. esp. with a short board like that you won't have any issues.
