I got some urethane incoming to experiment a bit with casting my own wheels. 
I'm especially interested in larger wheels of around 100-120mm in size and all terrain wheels. The pneumatic ones are too large for my taste and the availability and prices of urethane AT wheels like the MBS ones is pretty bad.

I want the wheels to fit standard bearings and trucks. I will experiment with solid 75A castings and maybe 90A tubeless tire designs with hollow sections. 

But I want some input from you guys. 
What would be your favorite dimensions? Is there anything you'd want in a (AT) wheel that the few commercially available ones don't provide? What core placement would you prefer (centered, offset or side). Side placed cores would make mounting pulleys really easy but wear unevenly. Has anyone experience with those (how bad the wear issue really is)?

I love large wheels (i use 97mm) because it increases ride comfort and safety. The major drawbacks are the increased weight, wheelbite and/or shoebite. Youll be rich if you make 90-97mm wheels that dont weigh so much, work with flywheel style pulleys and have incredible ride comfort.

I actually wanted to use a kegel style core, because theres just more meat there (durability). would that be a big drawback?

Not a big problem, its just that I feel like there are more pulley options for the flywheel style. You might even be able to design your own core that fits both kegel and flywheel styles, or make two versions. Either way, I feel like a soft, large diameter wheel that is lightweight would sell very well regardless of the core style.

Also, if you could make those wheels grippy on wet roads..... Many people complain about the slipperyness of PU wheels on wet roads, and apparently the MBS all terrains are even worse.

100mm wheels
Wide wheels concave on the outside
Abec style wheels
74A durometer
Orange, red and transparent colors
As light as possible, maybe air inside the polyurethane

How are you planing to cast the wheels? Where are you getting the polyurethane and how do you select the durometer on it? 

I could be your test mule, I've tried Abec clones, Kegels, 97mm ABEC 11 75A, MBS 100mm 78A. My favorites in smoothness and weight are the Abec 11 75A, my favorites in shape are the MBS

Casting into silicone moulds. RTV urethane from a local distributor here in Germany. I have 75A and 90A resins. I will try to go with the 75A unless the wear is too strong. The 90A is for testing and comparison.

Once I have functioning prototypes that I'm satisfies with I'll ask around for testers. I keep you in mind.

As for the weight.. is that really that big of an issue with our boards all having several kilowatts of power? I was thinking of casting the cores from zinc, which would make them heavier than plastics or aluminum

I love the initiative but what I am thinking is for input from the community on a custom design wheels shape, features and hardness. Then we can source a manufacturing company to make them for us

If the design is what you are looking for, go with the MBS wheels but with flat surface like ABEC 11 flywheels, use concave for the outside and ABEC 11 cores.

If you can use less urethane in order to decrease the weight without taking off the rebound properties, that would be a big plus. 

Use transparent urethane for the wheels as Abec 11 Metroboard cobranded ones. 

@kaly I'm really doubtful Abec 11 won't do the wheels for us. The community is too small at the moment.

Please do, but I feel custom, non standard wheels are almost impossible to get made since it takes thousands of dollars worth of tooling before even the first wheel can be made. It would need a group buy of epic proportions ;)

If Abec 11 can't have those wheel in stock consistently, then it would be tougher for anyone to even try to make a custom wheel with them.

I looked into this quite extensively. I wanted to machine aluminum hubs that would bolt a gear on directly. 

What I understand is that cast urethane is not nearly as abrasion resistant as hot  processed. This means cast wheels will wear quite fast. I bought some smooth on brand materials but never cast a wheel. 

I moved on and bought some flywheels.

I'd mainly do it for the durometer, 75A are hard to find nowadays. Maybe we could design a wheel and get it made from a Chinese manufacturer? With 6mm or so holes in the hubs so bolts can be fitted, or an easy snap in design. The clones seem to be quite grippy

It is but everyone know that it has to be trimmed in order to fit most boards and the overall look is not that appealing. 

So they are redesigning it.

What do you think is the ideal size for urathane wheel,..is 107 to Big ? , how much do they weigh ?

I would love to see a 90mm Black Kegal !!

Orangatang is coming out with a bigger ?wheel but only  in prototype stages.

I think 90 is not big enough. 107 might be too big. at least I think its the maximum before pneumatic becomes the better choice. maybe 97/100mm is the sweet spot? and does weight really matter with electric skateboards? don't all our builds have more than enough power?

The core will have the same geometry as the current one, the position and overall look of the urethane will be the change. 

@Randyc1 I don't think is too much weight, to me this boards are a vehicle, stuffing as much battery as possible the weight always is less than 40 lb.

I've started modelling the core to cast the urethane around. I want the core to be side set, to have a flush surface to mount  pulleys to and make the effective wheel base a little wider. 
I went with flywheels style mounting holes because I think thats what most peoble use.. However I now think kegel style holes would be better (because they have more meat and its a more straigt forward design), since there are no flush flywheel pulleys out there anyway. 
Any reason why to keep it flywheels vs kegel holes?

The wheels (107x54mm) are just a placeholder as of now. I might make them 115 or 125 later if the design requires it, but I also want to save urethane where I can. The wheels will probably get some kind of profile, I'm not sure yet.

I think the biggest benefit of using flywheels is their already wide adoption.  A bunch of people already have flywheel pulleys and they're inter-compatible with flywheels and their clones. Keeping the same type of pulley will give buyers more flexibility to choose which wheel they want without restricting them to custom or Kegels.

That said, I'm a bit late to this part and the wheel I REALLY want are the Evolve GT wheels in 90/97mm. The profile and wide contact patch are amazing, they just don't ride that well because I don't think they are truley 75a duro, and are a bit small at 83mm.

wouldn't that be just 97mm flywheels pretty much?

these flywheel pulleys that most people have are made to be set into the wheel a bit, right? that means they would stick out more than normal from a side set wheel like my design.

btw.. how do these attach to the wheel exactly? just by friction without any screws?

Those are the Evolve ones which fits all legit fly wheels snugly and some (but not all) clones. It never stuck out of my fly wheels when I had a Carbon GT. I use the Enertion pulley (LHB has some for sale too on shapeways) myself. The spokes are a bit thinner but they stay relatively snug on the wheel.

The contact patch of flywheels are actually a whole 1cm shorter which is why I want a bigger version of the Evolve GT wheels (and not having bright green wheels is a plus too)

no, I meant that they would stick out with my design. since the core is set to the inside wall of the wheel making flush.

I wanted to make it that way so that you can use any cheap pulley like these for example:
