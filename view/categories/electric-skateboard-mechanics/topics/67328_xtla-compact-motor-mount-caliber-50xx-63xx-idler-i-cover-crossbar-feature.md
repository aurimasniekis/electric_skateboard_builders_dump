XTLA | COMPACT MOTOR MOUNT | CALIBER | 63xx 50xx | IDLER FEATURE

As the title said, i‚Äôm making a motor mount design for my next build. Machining will be start tomorrow, so i just put my design here and hope to get some nice input. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

This is a fixed motor mount for Caliber trucks 44/50. Great Inspiration comes from UNIK core series @okp. I put as much feature as possible the mount can hold. It can be fit both 50xx/63xx, it can be use with idler and cover.

It‚Äôs a compact motor mount design for its features, the total length are 130mm and it has fixed angle at 20 deg.

DETAIL SPECIFICATION:

For Motor 63XX
Flexible center distance are at 67-73mm
Fixed center distance are at 70mm
Idler can be used at 70-73mm for standard motor and 72-73 for sealed motor (because part of the motor that make contact with the mount are full 63mm will hit the nut of the idler.

For Motor 50xx
Fixed distance at 70mm (use idler for tensioning)

Optimal size of pulley to use with idler are 32T & 36T,  but it can be use up to 40T (without idler)

Up to 107 wheels to use (110 need cover modification)

Will be use custom aluminum idler with bearing (4mm ID)

The clamp will be use M6 bolt (x1) & M4 bolt (x3)

What size of belt to be use? It depends on every setup will be used.

Pretty solid design.  I like the simplicity.  So forward mount only then?  how about a cross member for strength and be sure it can accommodate the longer motors 6374/6380  These need the 218 hangers.
```

Hi, thanks. Yes it is forward mount. Cross bar will add strength for sure, but have to decide which length to be use also, but thanks for reminding me to put other feature üòäüôè. For now, i want to test them with my 184mm Caliber.

It is hard to get a clamp mount to stay tight when using heavy motors but that simple design and short form factor should work.  The cross member doesn't just add strength it transfers the weight across both clamps which alleviates the stress on the individual units.  Anyway good luck with the project.  Its always nice to see new stuff popping up.

I'm looking for some new mounts. 
Will you mirror that design so we can have dual?
What grade aluminium will you use?
Could you skip to thread the aluminium for the clamp and make a pocket for lets say m6 nut to fit and use that instead of threads in the actual mount? 
Can you extend it 15-20 mm so you can run them with 6" pneumatics?
I vote for alu idler insted of bearings.
Idler diameter should be 20-25 mm. Something like that if I rememver correctly. Or was it 32?:thinking: need to check my practical machine book at work next week.

Split it in 2 pcs where the clamp is and add 2x m6 bolts with nuts..

A good clamp will work if its made of the right material.  Hard enough to not deform and soft enough to not crack.  Unfortunately i just don't know enough about the correct grade of aluminium to advise you my friend but be patient and a guru will respond.  
With the caliber profile you are lucky in the respect that you have square edges to work with so keep the tolerances to a minimum and as @L3chef suggests captive nuts are a good call if you have the width on the clamp.  Ally threads can strip but again with the right material you should be fine.
```

From experience. Sooner or later you will stip the thread no matter what alu grade you use. So therefor it's better to have nuts if it's possible .
But anything 7k grade will be great

Yes the design will be mirror. This mount will be machining tommorow i don‚Äôt think i want to change them for now (already make a deal with them), maybe i could design longer version if there is any interest. The space is tight thats why i said its a compact type but still have option even to use idler with its minimum length. About the idler i‚Äôll try with 15mm because of the space, if it didn‚Äôt work, will try bigger size.

hi, thanks, the crossbar would fit the new e caliber trucks, it is 123mm, the mount attached to the motor are 6mm left and right, so total hanger that used are 135mm. let say from 184mm caliber hanger (actual is 183mm) minus 135mm, the hanger still have about 48mm (24mm each side) to use pulley with bearing, speed ring, and space from pulley to mount.

Edit: i‚Äôll add extra length (crossbar), 128mm for dual 6355 sensored sealed for e caliber with my own pulley setup.

bump bump. What's the status of this mount? I ordered Unik's mounts but OKP refunded me because the last one in stock had alignment issues.

I really want this for the idler. OCD makes me want the two motors to be in the exact same position.

Hi, for now i only got a set of prototype for my own use. I know some of you guys asking about this mount, but for producing them, i'll need atleast 10sets, that's what the factory minimum order.

Would it be cheaper if you shipped a bunch to one location and then had someone distribute from there?

Yea i think that will be the best solution. Anyway the mount will cost around 150$ (rear-left,1crossbar, 2support bar anodized), additional idler about 15$(With bearing&bolt system). Not sure if the price are good for everyone üòä so let see how much interest of this to go.

Well right now. I‚Äôm gonna test this out, really throws off the balance it once had. If it doesn‚Äôt work out I‚Äôll NEED this mount![image|500x500](upload://kX40t9ny3VuGRCVjHAlUzwoyGRC.jpeg)

It‚Äôs a raptor 1 with the handle. I‚Äôm talking about the balance of the board while HOLDING said handle. 

The original setup was forward mounted 6355. Didn‚Äôt get the UNIK mount I wanted so trying out the rear mounted TB218 and dual 6374s I had laying around.
