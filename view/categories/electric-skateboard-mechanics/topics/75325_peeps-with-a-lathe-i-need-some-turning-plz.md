So I am building a DD and have designed most of the parts I just need some help with machining. I don't have a lathe except for at school, but I am not confident in my capabilities to use it accurately enough. What I need is for someone to turn a piece of aluminium stock into a cylindrical tube with an Od of ~65mm, Id of 59.1mm and length of 75mm.

Any help is welcome and I am willing to pay. I just thought I would see if anyone here is able to do this before taking it to a local engineering shop.

I will be posting up a build tutorial on how to make a DD once this step is done :grin:

Damn that could be a big problem as most guys here are in us or eu. I wonder how much it would cost to send something in one of those cylinders you get posters sent in, just a shortened one. Thanks anyway man

There is no machine shop that could do it for you? Something simple like this should be pretty cheap in any honest place

No seriously... maybe take a look how much shipping to europe or the usa would cost. Maybe it's not that expensive :slight_smile:

I haven't checked with a shop but just looking at aluminium stock over here it is about $70 for 300mm before it's even been machined

yeah we have to be careful about the kangaroo population, if too many stomp at once the island starts to sink a little. Maybe we need some help from your leader to control them ... a nice thiccc wall

mate.  kangaroo is beautiful meat.  Like the best steak you ever had.  Very good for you too.  Lean as and tender.  I just had to get my head round eating an animal I'm still in awe of.

How easy/complicated will the turning be? I got a 7x12 lathe and will be using them to help @nuttyjeff turn 10 sets of caliber hangars for his gear drive. 

That is, if you're willing to send it all the way to Singapore...!
Your best bet will hopefully be someone in Aus as well.

Damn. Iâ€™ll have a look into shipping costs tomorrow but it shouldnâ€™t be too hard of a job, just done boring. What lathe do you have I would like to get a mini lathe like the 7 x 12 you have but some of the reviews Iâ€™ve seen havenâ€™t been great

I'm using a SIEG SC2-350 lathe. It's a chinese brand but very well made. No problems with it so far after using it for a year.

hmm... this seems to match your requirements pretty nicely:
https://www.onlinemetals.com/merchant.cfm?pid=4371&step=4&showunits=inches&id=74&top_cat=60
2.88" OD x 0.28" Wall x 2.323" ID 
or in sane units:
73.152mm OD x 7.112mm wall x 59.0042mm ID
just order custom size of 3 inches (76.2mm) and it's like 8 bucks Aus dollars, if i remember the aprox. conversion.
shipping... ruins the whole idea. 
I'd check for aluminum pipe or tube to save costs and machining time.

God damn it doesnâ€™t even ship to Australia. Itâ€™s the perfect Id though and I could just leave the outside that size as it would just give the drive more protection. 

Anyone wanna buy it and ship it here lol

Lol, nope. Holidays are coming up soon so I will have about 6-8 weeks to build it all. I did manage to find some tubing though. About $16 and itâ€™s in Aus, pretty sure itâ€™s mean for an exhaust or something but oh well, at least itâ€™s the perfect size 63 x 58.96

Make those teeth longer. 
Add chamfers and fillets wherever possible.

Yea, the problem with getting a machine shop to make a custom part for you is that it's often crazy expensive. It's like starting a production line. The first chair you make is a million dollars, then the rest cost like 40 cents a piece to make. Well if you only want one or two pieces, you still gonna have to pay up for that initial startup.

The fillets add strength? adding them to the core teeth would strengthen it right?

```
Fillets decrease the chances of creating a stress fracture in sharp corners. The chamfers make things not sharp, useful when you have metal corners on plastic as you can gouge the plastic over time. 

Happened to mikenopolis and his Carvon adapters. 

Go look at the carvon tuners thread or at my adapters thread for a good design you can follow.

Thanks, I will do. Is this looking better I extended the teeth and added a solid base at the bottom as well as 1.5mm fillets on the inside and outside

All g, I thought about buying hubs and converting them but non have enough torque once converted to use 100mm wheels, plus its about the same price for sk3 motors that make a lot more torque and speed
