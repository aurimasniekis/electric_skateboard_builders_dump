Hi! What kind of nut is this? 15/32 inch or 11/12mm does not fit.

Its a special tool that you get with the kit.  Its a normal size skate nut for an 8mm shaft but you need a really skinny socket to get in there.  Contact landwheel or @pkasanda if you are in the states and he can help.. Resident landwheel guru.
