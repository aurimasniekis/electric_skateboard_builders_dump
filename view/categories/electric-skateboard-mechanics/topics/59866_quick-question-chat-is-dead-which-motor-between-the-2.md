6355 vs 5065?
Low KV  ~140

Light commuter build
Single Drive
30 inch deck, around 14-15 WB
90kg rider
Light to moderate hills

6355 or 6364 is the way to go for a light build, 5065 will work but will be strained more on hills

Can't seem to find 140kv 6355 though. Closest I found is this

Yeah thats what I mean, there is always a slight variance. There is also another 6356 Keda motor, it is labelled 5663 though for some reason

dw the keda is 190kV
