To those who have idler mounts. What is the distance of the idler arch from the center of the motor mount located exactly in the center?

Just want to know so I have a general idea for design.

Had to use iPad so pardon the finger drawing....

Mine are about 35mm from the motor pulley center using 624 bearings.

I think the question is how far from the wheel axle should the idler bearings be.  Because it's the wheel that gets in the way of the idlers.  The motor is on the other side.

So probably your wheel radius plus 15mm.  And turned the other way so they adjust around the wheel axle and not the motor axle.
