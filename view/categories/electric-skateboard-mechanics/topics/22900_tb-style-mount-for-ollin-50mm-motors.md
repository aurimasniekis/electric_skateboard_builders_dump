I'm building a double diagonal cruiser with Ollin 5065 motors.  Already had one Enertion mount from Jason, but they are no longer sold separately, so I got a TB mount for 50mm, and the bolt pattern is different (Ollin's bolts are 1.060" on center).

CNC mill to the rescue.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/1/c1700c35412237c998a5a9142218036bc0c784cb.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c673219ce9c37b15a29d04830eda679af265849e.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Would you sell those? Because I have a extra caliber attachment.

Sorry.  A friend drew and ran it for me at his school shop, and I only have one spare (which is overlong in the x dimension).
