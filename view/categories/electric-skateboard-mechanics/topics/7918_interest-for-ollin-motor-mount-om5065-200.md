I purchased a couple motors from Ollin and found that my mount didn't fit.  I finally got around to making one that fits these motors and wanted to see if anyone else is interested in them before I start making and selling them. I have a prototype now and a few more clamp parts due here next week - had to refine them a bit.  Here is the plan if there is interest.

Clamp for Calliber trucks - 25.00
Motor mount for Ollin (38mm hole pattern) motor - 25.00
Motor mount with 30mm hole pattern - 25.00

If you bought ONE clamp and ONE motor mount together - 47.00 + free USA shipping

The mount will be raw 6061 aluminum (I'll knock the edges off so they are not sharp) and comes with hardware for the mount and motor.
It is fully adjustable- I am using 36/16 gearing with 255 belt and the mount still has room so could probably do 265 depending on gearing.  

If I get 20 or so people wanting them I can have them done in two weeks or sooner if I get a good sample of the clamp in next week.

My goal was to make it as least expensive as possible and modular so you dont have to buy another complete mount if you change out motors.  You just have to by the Ollin hole pattern or the 30mm hole pattern.  If I add anodizing or powder coat it would bring the cost and lead time up. However, I am open to anything.

Adam0311 - I am still waiting on the revised version of the clamping mechanism, it will be here next week.  I can set it up tonight or tomorrow and see if it will work in reverse - may have to use a 265 belt and may be tight.  Ill  take pics and you can decide.

Adam0311 - it didnt take as long as I thought to turn it around.  it is very tight with a 255 belt and you will only have about 1/8 to 3/16" of space between the motor and the mount.  Not sure how far your deck drops down but you can see from the picture.  I dont have a 265 belt to test.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6415ca70c063bdd4550a2b82a69c83d63d102c36.JPG" width="666" height="500">

There is one that has a 30mm hole pattern which will fit many motors (check your motors hole pattern) and one that has a 38mm hole pattern which fits Ollin 5065 motor.

Just to clarify - the motor mount assembly is made up of two pieces- the truck clamp and the motor arm. 

There are 2 different motor arms you will need to specify which arm when you order. 

The truck clamp is universal and will work for both arms.

Adam0311 - Yes, I should have the updated clamp by Thursday to test and if there was enough interest I would make a bunch of them. However I do understand wanting to get rolling as soon as possible  Do you have the Ollin motor or do you need the  30mm hole pattern. 

I have 1 other sample but the clamp needs to be filed down to fit the caliber trucks correctly.  If you dont mind filing it down about 1/16" on the bottom and 1/32" on the sides I can sell it to you for 30.00.   It took me about an hour to make it fit correctly. Or you can wait to see if there is enough interest, and I will start making them. Up to you.

I have had a few people ask for an update so I am just going to post here. The updated clamps will be sent out on Friday which means I will get them on Tuesday or Wednesday.  I put in an order for more arms with the Ollin motor hole pattern yesterday so should get them around next Friday.  Once I make sure everything fits I will order a bunch so there is no more waiting.

Got the Clamps today and they fit like a charm. Drilled and tapped some holes and put everything together.

The space was a bit tight so I replaced the SHCS attaching the mount arm to the clamp with a low head SHCS.  I also added stainless washers for motor and clamp screws.

I am ready to make a larger order now that everything works.  

8 Chaka motor mounts and 7 30mm mounts are spoken for, if anyone else wants to put their order in now I am selling them for 45.00 with free US shipping.  I am ordering about 10 or so extra so if you want to wait till they get in you can but first come first served for what is in stock.  I Have some on order and will be ordering more tomorrow. Just let me know if you want 30mm hole spacing or Ollin 38mm hole spacing.

I ordered some belts from vbeltsupplies.com for this project and accidentally ordered 15mm wide for my 12mm system. 

The AWESOME people at vbeltsupplies.com sent me 4 new 12mm belts and only charged me shipping.  So, I am giving away the 4 15mm belts they let me keep - you just pay shipping.  I would like t give them to 4 different people but will give them to 2 people with dual configs. PM me if you are interested.

I dont see the mounts for his motors on his site.  It looks like @michaeld33 is selling similar motors with the same hole pattern. So if anyone is interested just specify the motor hole pattern 30mm (generic 50mm motor) or Ollin, bitblock (38mm motor hole pattern). I have about 10 extra on order, they should be here this week and I will ship them out early next week.

Just spoke with the company that cut the mounts out and they are just sending them to me today so I wont get them till Wednesday. This means I can send them out on Monday the 19th or before.  I do have 3 mounts I can send out this Monday the 12th.  @themegak and @Michaelinvegas get first choice since they showed interest first. If you both are doing duals, one of you is going to have to wait.

Depending on the caliber trucks you have  clone or branded - the branded trucks have a bit of a taper.  The clamps are cut by a water jet which has a bit of a taper as well so when you slide the clamp on the truck , one way will fit a bit more snug than the other.  Take the arm off and slide the clamp on the truck you will see what I am talking about - I just put them on for shipping and so you would know what screws went where.  depending on what side you put the mount on will determine where the arm will fit.  Just line up the round slots with the holes on the clamp in whatever position (close to your deck or tail side) you feel is the best for you.   Im sure you already know to put loctite on after you fit everything - pretty straight forward. Use the screws on the top and side for fine adjustment to keep is straight and to keep it from moving when it is where you want it. Maybe I will make some instructions before I send them out. Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey that mount is really nice. I love how thick and solid most of it is.
I do have some suggestions though, for your next iteration. I have broken many mounts over the years and what I've learned is the metal needs to not have much holes in it. and the metal around the holes you do make, should be very thick. 

This is my suggestion for you, don't cut off all that metal to make the curve in the middle. Leave that extra metal there for support of those holes.

I agree with @Mikeomania12. I just broke my psychotiller mount this week after I think it got a little loose and out of alignment. Put too much stress on the mount and it broke around the large slotted holes. It's only 3/16" 6061 which IMO is a little weak, especially around the holes. I am going to give DIY v4 a go...I'm hoping the 7075 and smaller holes will do bettter.

Another advantage of 3mm SS is it gives you more Shaft length for your Gear.

Many shafts like on the Sk3 Motors are short.

I am probably not going to do the stainless for awhile - end of October when trade shows are over and work slows down a bit. I would like to test it before I sell it.

I didn't use a key. I picked up some stainless set screws and used the slot with the set screw. I couldn't find a key locally and too lazy to make one I may eventually.

@GCB yes, it comes with all hardware needed to mount the motor to the truck.  Do you have a 63xx or 50xx or Ollin motor.  How many do you need.  I am getting in a new batch tomorrow sometime and I will need to take off the sharp edges and tap some holes so I can ship out on Monday.

Just to clarify - you have the 50xx from ollin.  I am just making sure because his 50xx is different than most 50xx.

Thanks

I dont offer them in black because my goal was to offer a good mount at about half the price of others.  The only way to do this was to not have any extras and to process the metal myself (take the edges off, tap and drill holes). However they are sanded and ready to be painted or powder coated or anodized.

Hey MIV- I have a regular 50xx, 10 Ollin and 3 63xx. I just need to knock the sharp edges off and tap some holes. Anything in particular you are looking for.

Hey it's been a couple months and I just wanted to say the motor mount's held up pretty good. I think the only problem about it is the bolts that bolt the main piece to the clamp piece are really thick so my wheel pulley scrapes up against it, but all i did was add 2 truck washers to it and it spaced them out.

Hey, thanks for the feedback and letting us know your solution. I have been making stainless arms that are half the thickness, unfortunately it's a few dollars more expensive

Any of you ever consider using (Titanium) Additive Manufacturing technology to create your motor mounts (or any other Esk8 piece for that matter)?

Is basically a printer which uses Titanium powder to print complete Titanium pieces. Much or less the same principle as 3D ABS or Nylon printing, but instead using plastic material it uses raw metal powder to manufacture complete pieces.

Dont know the price. I'm not sure about the polish. Probably done with the printer process, is called **Additive Manufacturing**.

It's even more expensive than subtraction manufacturing which is already expensive enough.

Well, but when the the tough gets going, the going gets tough. When you hear complains about not achievieving this and that, and there's solutions out there, although expensive, but solutions anyway.
