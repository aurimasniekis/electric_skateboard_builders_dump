I want to buy the [Enertion motor mount](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/carbon-fiber-motor-mount-enertion/) at $58.55. I live in the United States. The website calculated a shipping cost of $30. Did I do something wrong or is shipping always that expensive?

That sounds like it is correct. Shipping overseas is expensive, he may also have to pay import taxes and that is why the price is so high. Not sure tho. If u need motor mounts and don't want to pay $30 for shipping check out
