Was about to place an order not long ago for an Eboosted Trampa Enclosure, but seeing he won't ship them before Jan next year it sadly means its not an option for me since I'm in China by then and I need to have most of the board ready and dimensions ready before i leave.

What are my options? Can't really find any other than his, it needs to be more or less like his in different rooms that allow flex and a battery config like the one that fits his.

Making one myself is sadly not an option, no tools no room for tools (Apartment in the city) and not much spare time to do such thing and I know it won't be up to my standard if i do make one.

I bet @psychotiller  could make you something in ABS if you give him dimensions.
