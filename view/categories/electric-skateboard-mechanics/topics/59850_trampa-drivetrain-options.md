Hello all,
I have been looking to purchase a 4wd drive train for my Trampa mountainboard but can't seem to find all the options out their. I know that @Nowind has a great product but that is a little out of my price range when I get to 4wd. I also need to buy a 2wd belt or direct drive setup for my trampa street carver. @Kug3lis has some nice inner gear drive systems which I love but they are out of stock. Can someone recommend some 4wd setups in the $300-$450 range?
Thanks,
Thomas
