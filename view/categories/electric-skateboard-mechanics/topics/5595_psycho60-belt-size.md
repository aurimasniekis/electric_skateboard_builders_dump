I've spoken to psycho about this, but I can't for the life of me get the slack to go away on my 255 belt running 16/36 pulleys. The deflection is almost an inch and my belt was brand new. I thought I had it fixed and it was user error, but I was wrong. Going shorter is always an option. No hate towards psycho, probably my error somehow. I still buy stuff off of him.

Seriously? I told you the size you need. 51 tooth. It's called a psycho60 mount for a reason..60mm center to center. Also, it says this info on my website. @Nordle are you reading this thread?

How many teeth does your belt have? Thought you got it figured out...why is no one else having this issue? You need a smaller belt. 1 tooth smaller. That's 5mm shorter. Get one! This is such an easy problem to solve. Please get a different belt and go riding. And take video

Would it be stupid to go 17T to 40T, and use a slightly longer belt? almost the same ratio, but never seen so far on esk8.

It is, I have two belts on the way. I can't explain why no one else has this problem. I've fiddle with it for hours now, and it's not rocket science. It rides though!

hmm, the above linked belts only have 1.2mm deep teeth. I assume they aren't viable?
