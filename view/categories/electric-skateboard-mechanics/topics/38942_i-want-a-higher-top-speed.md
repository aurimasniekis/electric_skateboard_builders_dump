I have a dual 6355 10s3p with 16/36 gears and I top out at about 27mph with 90mm wheels I was thinking of getting 18t motor pullies to be closer to 30mph is that a good idea or will I loose too much toque?

lower your wheel gear to 34 and see what that does for you. OR even 33. I'd try that before increasing your motor pulley size.

I do. Feel free to browse the other tooth counts. I also have them for Kegels.  

If you're using a standard axle length hanger, you'll need to remove 8mm of aluminum from the hanger to use these, and you'll need an F608ZZ bearing. you can get those bearings for cheap on Amazon. Like $11 a ten pack.

So I got the LHB 33t wheel pullies and I tried it out on my Raptor today with 107s and I was able to hit 36mph it was awesome.
