a few things, diy is more, but seems to fit well w caliber trucks and enertion is less expensive, but i noticed there is no set screw, would this work with sk3 6473 motors? also notice you may have to modifi caliber trucks to work with this set? is there a mount/ and or trucks that work well w enertion i cant seem to find enertion mounts anywhere, are they no longer available? ovi less expensive is better but not better than quality and convenience for me. thanks
