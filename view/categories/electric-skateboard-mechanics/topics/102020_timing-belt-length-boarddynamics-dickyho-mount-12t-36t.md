Hi there,

I'm wondering whether my belt HTD 320 5M  is too long for my mount and pulleys.
I have an old version of the Boarddynamics-Dickyho mount for Caliber trucks. I have a 36T wheel pulley and a 12T motorpulley.

I'm happy with the speed I get but when going uphill the belt seems to skip easily. Should I maybe switch to a 40T wheel pulley or get a shorter belt? Shorter belts seems to be hard to find. How much shorter should I aim for? The idler wheel is already in it's bottom position.

Your belt is too loose

You should use 305mm belt with 12/36t combo on this mount :+1:
