Hi all,

I'm planning on changing my 5055 motors, I have got a dual motor setup, vescs, and 12s. I'd like to have better motors with more torque, and lightweight. Do you think two [D5036](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/dt6376-14p-sensored-motor-125kv.html) will work on my build? If not what do you suggest?

I have no idea why they named them like that, when they seem to be a 6355 size.. So annoying!

But yeah, should work :) there is a whole thread about those motors
