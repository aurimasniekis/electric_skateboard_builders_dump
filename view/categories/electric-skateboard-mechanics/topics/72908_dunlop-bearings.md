I don't know them, but if you manage to get any big brand bearing they will last forever, see if you can find locally from NSK/SKF/FAG/Nachi

And they usually are cheaper than "skate bearings"

I Always buy Industrial bearings Made in Germany for cheap and they Last. Havn't serviced them in a year ans they run Smooth.
Edit: Not Sure If they are actually Made Here but they work well
