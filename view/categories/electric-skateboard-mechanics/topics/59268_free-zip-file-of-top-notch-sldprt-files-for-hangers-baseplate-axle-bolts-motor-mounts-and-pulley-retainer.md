Ok. Free link for anyone to grab for either personal use or to brand it with your own brand and sell.

( File has a few new edits with minor improvements added now with slightly smaller axle holes, slightly rounded corner in the inside of the pivot cup and added pulleys / retainer)

Baseplates 0 to 50 in 2 degrees increments.

Standard 5/16", 3/8", metroboard 5/16" and SuperStar 3/8" axle bolts.

Hangers of many sizes up to 240mm. (Metroboard hangers need to be 35mm shorter then the front hanger. In readme I said 30mm which is incorrect. Listing of Metro hangers vs front hanger is also correct)

G-Bomb motor mounts.


36t HTD5 17mm pulley and retainer

Technical information for tapping.

Simple readme notes in technical folders

All old links removed and now here is the one stop [GrabCad](https://grabcad.com/bradley.ford-3/models) page showing all of my projects.

Ok, I got a couple of minor overlooked problems fixed up.

Made a pulley that offers the best of both worlds, spokes for good alignment and bolted on for ease of installation. 

36 teeth 17mm wide HTD5 pulley and retainers for genuine flywheels. (I do not think it will fit with the fatter spoke clones)

Editing it should be easy enough to change number of pulley teeth.

Hole in the center is 26.984mm in diameter. Little holes in the pulley is 3.242mm for M4 bolt tapping and the retainer holes is 4.1mm in diameter. Retainer big center hole is 24mm in diameter.

Note: I have not had it made yet so if you make it before I did and find size issues, let me know.

(File link removed as it now have been added to op file which has minor hole size updates)

Before this thread blows up, would you have any interest making a post on Grabcad? It will make it much easier for people to view individual files, have interactive model viewing in browser, and tracking of likes and downloads. It also allows for updates to files without changing download links. It's also free :slight_smile: 

The community there would love it.

Are you going to use your own custom bolts? Asking cos you only have 12mm deep axle holes.

Caliber and my bolts is 17mm long from the butt and also the hole in axle on precision caliber is 22mm deep and mine at 25. I think many tapping tools have a slight taper at the start to ease the tap into the hole and the shallow hole will prevent you from tapping all the way in for the bolt.

Also hanger axle hole diameter at 8.17mm for M8? How will the 8mm tap make threads into the hole if the hole is bigger than the 8mm tap?

It will have to be smaller than that, smallest diameter for M8 internal at max is more like 6.647mm, the teeth in the tap will dig into the metal creating threads and the overall dimension of said thread would be at 8mm max.

See image below for M8 nut tapping.
![M8%20ISO%20Internal%20Tapping%20Information|520x499](upload://4L8niqr6K4MZ7h4wNIueNzAcj54.PNG)

Kingpin hole is at 5mm on mine, but then half a mm is trivial so I cannot see any issue with 4.5mm.

New update now that I have received the pulleys, 40 degrees baseplate and G-Bomb mounts.

No stress as I understood that prototypes might not turn out quite right, but then it becomes very easy to see what needs to be changed.

From most incorrect to perfect.

Pulleys, it appears all perfect except one problem, the gap of the outside of the spokes need to be about 1 to 1.5mm wider. Will have to edit that. Files has been removed till edited item has been done.

Retainers is great and the gap for pulleys/retainer for M4 bolt is just right. No edits needed here.
![Retainer|666x500](upload://lsjbs8Jr37ErpRUr7VNmkB5a3LX.jpg)

You can see here that three spokes have some damage on the outside, that was where the gap in the pulley spoke was not wide enough. :thinking:
![Retainer%20bolt%20spacing|666x500](upload://n6o7U8pPIuktjdLrHfnQFAXbIUn.jpg)![Retainer%20and%20bolt|577x500](upload://qopsg0Re0thBMs8UFPKbKxa3QU7.jpg)![double%20retainer|425x500](upload://cBza8hLeY0DQ6UA8Mh0MR1sWsxV.jpg)

Baseplate. The kingpin needed to be about 2mm higher up..... Also the kinpin hole diameter needs to be reduced by about .2mm. Pivot hole diameter needs to be reduced by half a mm.

The perfect item right out of the mail parcel is the G-Bomb motor mounts. No edits needed at all!!!!

Complete ease for phase wires via the ramp. More mounts need to have that feature. Image shows motor at closest position.
![Ease%20of%20phasewires|690x277](upload://nzQTESXT15mtFVefXbCMbmqCPyE.jpg)

Motor positioned at the furthest possible distance (129mm)
![Motor%20max%20distance|551x499](upload://eIUVHlQhsz575r45bqMbdRGU0w6.jpg)

Motor position at the closest possible distance (123mm)
![Motor%20Min%20Distance|514x500](upload://bTIanQnPPCPLtsF8MPh2OM2oi26.jpg)

This is the closest I could push the motor mounts in till the curve for the kingpin hole obstructs any further pushing in and guess what, it stops at the perfect distance for 6355's as you can see the  small gap in between. 

This thing is very sturdy due to 1.5cm thickness and 3cm wide clamp, so despite the closeness of the gap, it not gonna hit each other.
![Motor%20Min%20Visible%20Gap|624x500](upload://ktEu2l5LyFnHaoXkXLtwtJCUKIf.jpg)

Loosen the kingpin nut till it is almost off to test max lean and there is no problem with the 44 degrees baseplate max turn. I will be using 40 degrees when I fix the dimension error.

Max right lean.
![Max%20Right%20Turn|559x500](upload://9iyDAQzvcpNm91mN7ToKo0bgwoD.jpg)

Further update on discovered errors on prototype of baseplate and pulley.

Baseplate kingpin hole moved further up by 2mm. Kingpin hole diameter size reduced from 9.950mm to 9.650mm.

Baseplate pivot cup hole diameter reduced from 17.7mm to 17mm.

Pulley spoke inner gap increased from 3mm to 4mm and outer spoke gap increased from 3mm to 5mm. (It includes the gap between the two bolt holes as well as most of the bolts will be screwed into the slope of the pulley anyways.
![sdafasf|690x335](upload://vodrsBJlzLMLQKSTTZHYySnuSWD.jpg)

Pulley spoke thickness reduced by 0.5mm

Yes I will as I have an interest in purchasing 110mm Boa if they do get around to it.

I have got myself a Kegel sldprt file. I assume that the inside shape of the kegel wheel vs the hub core is the same as Boa wheels?

I will model 30t for 90mm and 37t for 110mm in case they do get around to that.

For the Flywheels, once the fit has been fixed, I will then make 26t, 28t, 30t and 33t for 76mm, 83mm, 90mm and 97mm Flywheels respectively.

## \#50 Posted by: Brad Posted at: 2018-07-16T11:14:05.918Z Reads: 117

```
Primarily I had the models made for myself, not for "everybody"; then release the files to the public.

The reason for these specific teeth numbers is so that the top speed will always be the same. (One pulley for one specific wheel size)

Top speed on full charge li-ion 12s5p should be very close to the same with 90mm on 30t and 110mm on 37t which will also match top speed of flywheels from smallest pulley for smallest wheel and upward.

Anyone else is free to grab it and then make some edits to make 32 and 36.

Yep, very happy with it, hard to pull out by hand but not too hard which is just perfect.

Sadly I made the base plate pivot hole too small :( I made it .7mm smaller in diameter and it appears I should have reduced the diameter by .25mm thereabouts. Ah well, third time is the charm for the baseplate!

Pics of pulley with 380/75 5htd belt. Had to insert a 1mm ring on the inside as 200mm hanger was a tad too narrow. Will have to make 205mm hangers which will be perfect!

If you want I can check if I can do it cheaper. Can’t anodize (yet). Do you need aerospace tolerances? :D

If you PM me your email address I can send you the file plus a drawing. I am not entirely familiar with "aerospace tolerances" but it would be great if the axle stub boreholes would be somewhat concentric and the borehole diameter must be within a certain tolerance band. I'd love to have 7075-T6 but this will be extraordinary expensive. 6082-T6 and 6061-T6 are quite similar ....

I guess it depends on the job there also and what’s specified. It was supposed to be a joke :) How accurate does it need to be? I actually never thought about it when I made a truck for my raptor hubs since I didn't think it was high precision stuff. The machine is rated for 0.02mm and my zero tool is 0.01mm but the human error with two setups is prolly the worst part :) Some pics/vids below of the raptor2 home made truck.

Final piece which is the baseplate has been successfully made. Everything is perfect, no minor corrections needed so the third time is indeed the charm! I will upload the sldprt files on my GrabCad page. 

The gap you see between the pivot cup and the base of the hanger pivot butt is because the venom cup is actually about a mm more shallow than the standard Caliber pivot cup.

New update: [Download Homepage](https://grabcad.com/brad-248)

Wider pulleys at 20mm wide with 26, 28, 30, 33 and 36 teeth has been added for hangers of 210mm or wider. (Use 36T Pulley (17mm wide).SLDPRT for the 200mm wide hangers and you probable still need to insert a couple of washers on the inside)

26t
![26t|627x500](upload://onQKL1Ydzk6BEzWF9otJrDEs2N6.png) 
28t
![28t|569x500](upload://1HxWvEBJSfECeYCXhNJW3fwfMBS.png) 
30t
![30t|628x500](upload://qYdnhc3DHcogSdW3f39C4h53zsn.png) 
33t
![33t|542x500](upload://yCODxyZHtvm4HYZvLG1AuljiSuk.png) 
36t
![36t|498x500](upload://f9XhblIl7BrUQlVI0FMwaRAVYDg.png) 

For close to the same speed - 26t for 76mm, 28t for 83mm, 30t for 90mm, 33t for 97mm and 36t for 107mm.

Note: for 26mm, you will have to make sure the bolt is not too long as the hole does not go all the way through.

![Not%20all%20the%20way%20through|470x500](upload://qGvRmTVVpxLCAyc2yioZ2VOQSH3.png) 

Constrictor pulleys will be next project, but may be a bit as I have other priorities right now.

[Little update](https://grabcad.com/library/single-hanger-and-mount-non-adjustable-mount-1).

Added single peice hanger-mount for 210, 220, 230 and 240mm wide hangers,so no worries about mount coming loose etc. Also added an option for fixed removable mounts that will be held with two bolts for 210mm.

Distance between mount and hanger side has been set for [20mm wide FlyWheel pulleys](https://grabcad.com/library/20mm-wide-htd5-26t-28t-30t-33t-and-36t-pulleys-for-flywheels-1)

Hi, How do you mount the single piece mount to the hanger? Grub screws?
Cheers

Grub screw wont work at all, the screw will need a head to tighten the motor mount onto the hanger section as the hanger mount holes will not have any threads, only the detachable motor mount will have threads.

This is just an additional idea I did up. I have not got it made at all.

After doing a bit of thinknig, I think you were talking about the single peice mount/hanger and not the lower picture because I cannot see how you would think of grub screws doing the job. If that is the case, the single peice mount/hanger is exactly that, just a whole single peice made out of a single billet of aluminum.
