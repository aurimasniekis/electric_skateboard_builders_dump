Hi guys, as many people were asking about smaller wheels like (125mm) for direct drive, after spending some time on the design we finally have something to offer.

Some initial specs:

* ~90mm diameter of case
* 3:1 gear ratio
* Outer gear style
* Motor gear in aluminium 7075 T6 coated with a hard surface or something similar don't know the name.
* Wheel gear machined from POM plastic.
* Should fit mini hanger from Trampa with small filing one surface.

Sorry @Kug3lis  I’ve change the title, I think gears drive and direct drive are two different system and since your system is base upon  a reduction it can’t be call direct drive

My point was just to name thing for what they are and not what we wish they are. And start educating people on real term, I know Jenso Call is drive "Direct Drive" but it isn't right neither, and now when you talk about hub everyone is confuse.

guys coming from hubs want a carvon to be a direct drive... guys coming from belts and chains want a gear directly driving the wheel to be a direct drive.

And wikipedia is hardly "evidence" the page was edited a few weeks ago and not that long ago I thought I remembered reading the same page and it said something else...

maybe we all need to imagine?

Im pretty sure that direct drive means direct transfer of the motor revs.
Note NO gearbox. 
By that definition carvon IS a direct drive, as it is just a hubmotor...
```

---
## \#24 Posted by: Cobber Posted at: 2018-02-18T15:05:05.797Z Reads: 487

```
I'd say carvon is a direct drive and not a hub-motor as the motor is not the wheel hub...
and I had previously asked Jenso about why he called his gear box a direct drive and he flicked me up a page referencing his perspective... And I respect him enough to move on.

At this point we can argue semantics of drive systems or if it should be eMTB or... it don't really matter unless you are a keyboard warrior looking for conflict (no dis-respect Dan, just making a point).

This is more for street, so torque is not much a problem, plus with 5:1 you would need really low kv motor for 125mm wheels.

We are also working on making a mounting plate for TB218 trucks and specialy part of Solid Core hub with direct mount for gear which saves another plate for mounting gear to hub.

These look sweet! How much testing have they been through? I’m no engineer, but I know from working on cars and motorcycles that POM plastic is prone to thermal expansion. I imagine there will be some pretty good heat with sustained high speeds.

## \#58 Posted by: Kug3lis Posted at: 2018-03-08T23:36:56.823Z Reads: 348

This is already the fourth generation of the drivetrain, and there are no problems with POM plastic. POM based gears are used in many industrial machines and in way much higher speeds and loads than our esk8.

Of course, before putting those to the sale I will try them out myself on my build http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/urban-dailydriver-35-holypro-carve-trampa-mini-vertigo-trucks-aps-6374-130kv-3-2kw-fatboy-directdrive-fatboy-solid-hubs-12s-fatboy-esc/47028/3

P.S. These one are only for mini Trampa trucks (which will be required to be sent for milling because @trampa removed them from his store so no more purchase of only hangers) and TorqueBoards 218mm hanger (this will require our custom FatBoy Solid Core wheel hubs)

No worries man! I just was having a hard time keeping up with the different threads so wasn't sure if I missed it.

You got no idea how bad I want off of belts... Lol

PS are you considering helical to decrease the size of the spur gears while increasing the surface area in mesh? 

Didn't know if you were using blank gears and milling them or if your using blank stock and milling.

We will base off original 1:3 design with bit smaller sizes and different gear ratios like 1:3 1:27 1:25 1:24 the drivetrain is done just need to receive wheels to make hub mount. But I can tell you it's second day I am riding this 1:3 trampa version and I love it!

Guys we could make on SurfRods version too but I don't think it would fit on their hanger, I don't know final width of version of 107mm but mine for e.g. is 10cm width (with 6374 motor) so you need at least 20 cm width on hanger. I see they have 20cm width hanger but I don't think it will fit nicely.

## \#129 Posted by: Acido Posted at: 2018-04-30T20:40:36.060Z Reads: 257

Could you explain why?

Since when you use a round shape there are always the same number of tooths transfering the force, and on squares and triangles there are a lot less on a certain point of rotation
That is resulting more wear on the certain tooths
This is acceptable if they are made out of some high quality hardened steel
But my guess that these are made out of aluminum
So as the number of sides increase the tooth number that are transfering the force increases
And you cant get the number any higher than with a round gear

Im no means an expert on these things im just using my logic :D  which to me seems that it makes sense
Simmilar reason why there are no square or triangle pistons used in engines

Sure it is. You just need an intermediate gear/idler gear to keep the motor center to wheel center distance.

13mm is not alot.... I suggest going smaller with like a 14 pitch, 8 tooth motor spur, 8 tooth idler, and 24 tooth wheel gear. So you can keep the center to center distance so the motors don't hit the trucks...

Why not? Making duplicate 8 tooth gears (motor and idler) could be the same, and smaller housing should save some material cost... 8:8:24 is 1:3 the most voted reduction... The only addition I see is a extra 8 tooth gear, a short shaft, and two bearings.. so the idler can spin freely, mean while the stock width  for cutting the housing will be smaller..

Just an idea...if you were talking about cutting different teeth idlers..yea.. but just duplicating the same cam program for double the tiny gears... I don't see how it could be that much of a price increase...and the shaft for most motors is 8mm.. as are skate axles.. so skate bearings for the idler..


Either way it was just an idea so you can get more clearance...  Since running the cam for more of the same part is cheaper then running it for a different cut..
```

---
## \#138 Posted by: Kug3lis Posted at: 2018-04-30T21:27:12.354Z Reads: 244

Then you will need another side of plate to support the idler gear, now it's only motor gear is supported on motor bearings and wheel gear on axle. So you basically changing whole design, which almost doubles everything.

Plus even if you go to 24 tooth gear not much clearance you will get... From 36 down to 24 is like Iess than 1cm..

Also then you will need to support both sides of gearbox on the hanger which will minimize motor length availability...

I don't really see a point of getting less than 1cm clearance for so many cons...

Its louder than belt drive, probably 25% louder.  But it has easily 50% more torque and a lot more (don't know how much yet) top end.  This is assuming like wheel and motor sizes.

80mm will not fit as motor is already next to hanger. Also I don't see a point of running 80mm motors, with decent 63mm you will not be able to handle this drivetrain as torque is massive...

@ATLesk8 I saw it, but I have no info yet regarding that topic.

@Naysh there is no point in making helicals, plus they are not good design choice... Axial loads will kill your motor and wheel bearings.

There is a lot of material on helical gears, I suggest to make some investigation first. I have a person who works on racing car transmissions design explain me why helical gears on this type of gear drive is really poor design choice. Double helical is whole different story. Like @mmaner said it is bit louder than belt drive because these uses a smaller module tooths so they mesh much better and honestly is not that loud ;)

Nice, Which APS motor is pictured there? Is that a 218 hanger?

Edit: seems to be 6384 from posts above. Since the shaft passes the centre point maybe that answers @uigiroux's question.

Perhaps there is enough axle space left to make it happen but any spacer used takes away from clamping area, not something to consider with a powerful motor

I like the addition of more pre-drilled holes in the plate, the 218 drive unit I bought has only four holes meaning the drive can only be mounted in-board due to this restriction. That pretty much stops me trying to use it with a tipped deck - La Croix..dunno may have another shot at that

I am not sure if @Kug3lis is including any gaskets there. But I planned on visiting my local Grainger to grab a seal like what was provided on my NoWind DD for Trampas, so that I can add lubrication without contamination

Gasket o-ring in black also called slip ring gaskets... just a thought..

I am running my gears raw (dry) no wear after 1k mi ;) So I don't know you can if you want but I just see wasted effort :) Maybe with lubrication it would be even silenter :) One of reason why you don't need lube is POM self lubrication :)

I think the problem is that you can't go with another angle for Caliber 2 because then the motor will touch the trucks hanger.

Oh yeah, POM is great for this :) it's one of the best materials to use for gears. I just figured I have the option to get some slip ring gaskets, so probably will for a complete seal, and to aid in silence.

Still same issue.

This is very close to the gound so that you will hit stuff with the motors first. So a steeper angle would be nice so that the motors are closer to the board.
![image|666x500](upload://gvEgDosjxNKN3ouAXl9xn7Colxo.jpg)

But that doesn't seem to be possible because the hanger is in the way.

Randal baseplates & two choices of caliber baseplates & Angled wedges,you can create an angle as desired.

Also some crazy people like @Sender & myself plan to try skate trucks on a tipped deck (La Croix). I for one welcome the adjustability.

Just seen your edit and you have a point.The extra holes allow you to mount the drive outboard - to the other side...or up in the sky, or bouncing off the tarmac..options

No i don't have them. Just only had a closer look at the product. But i have Direct drives from Nowind and as these here are also not helical gears i expect them to be at the same noise level. That means i expect them to be louder than belt drives. Especially at some speed. Sounds a bit like a car in reverse gear.

The only thing i don't really like about the product is that i think that the angle will be a problem for a normal board. For a Landyachtz Evo it will be fine because of the -15 angle from the baord. But on normal boards it is very close to the ground. And that is an issue of the limited wheel size. 107mm isn't small but you need to place the motor a bit away from the axle because of the trucks hanger. And i asked the question a couple of times if it is possible to change the angle. But the suggested predrilled holes in the mount don't seem to fix the problem because of the hanger. Adding risers to the beck truck can solve that problem a bit, but at the same time it will also change your boards turing behavior.

Here you can see what i mean
![image|666x500](upload://aYN2DWhTpxdwKbVuHdMbbX1QxpX.jpg)

What i would like to see here is a hint from Kug3lis what the limitations of the gear drive will be so that the costumers are aware that they have to live with motors that are very close to the ground or that they have to find a solution to change the trucks angle. 
What i did see or how it felt for me was trying to talk the issue (or physical limits) away by not really answering in detail to a detailed question.

But on the other side the product is still in beta (prototype or whatever you want to call it) and let's wait for the final version.
And don't get me wrong. I like to see products like these.

I understand your point @Ackmaniac I know you want to look up for people, at the moment we don't have yet 6374 to show you that all angles fit correctly with real 74mm length motor, but as you know each motor is different. So there is an option to place motors on outer position, which shouldn't cause any problems :) (APS backorder is taking more than a while with all those shipment label cancellations and etc...) 

But I think @b264 and @Deckoz then they will receive the drives will show what I mean :)

Gear drive is not direct drive.  As far as I know, only Carvon and Torqueboards are working on axial direct drive and the radial direct drives are called hub motors.  I don't think Nowind has either of those.  He's hawking gear drives and calling them direct for marketing reasons

Have you solved your tolerance issue with the wheel bearings? I bought a set of cnc hubs from you because my bearings fell out of my Tramps superstar hubs. I mentioned this to you dude before purchase. I was under the assumption that because you did not anodize your hubs the fit of the bearing would be "press fit" but it falls out... Not good enough dude... Unhappy customer :frowning: your solution was to loctite... something that should press fit. @Moderators I already tried to work this out, so buyer beware! dude is sloppy!

Not true. Anodizing take away material.
I have talked to a lot of people (engineers and mechanics) and what they all said is that thermal installing of bearings is the best way. warm up the nest and cool down the bearing and it should just fall into it's space. Once it reach equal temperature it should be nice tight fit.
Your new solution looks complicated and noisy probably and more resistance..... for high power setup I would go with 15mm wide belts and next stage is some kind of direct drive I believe.

I agree with you but how many has access to like blow torches and etc, we use green Loctite which was made exactly for glueing in bearings:

> LOCTITE retaining products secure bearings, bushes and cylindrical parts into housings or onto shafts. They increase maximum load transmission capability and uniform stress distribution and eliminate fretting corrosion. Applied as a liquid, they allow 100% contact between mating metal surfaces, eliminating the need for more expensive designs, time consuming machining and even the use of mechanical methods.

@cobber I just talked with my father he said that when he shipped the wheel hubs for you none of bearing even fit into them without really hard press. Also he said if you don't like it and want your money back, don't even bother shipping them back just cut them in half or hammer them so they would not be usable and send pictures to prove it. We will return the money back. As shipping can be expensive for you. ;)

Because the way you started this sounds a bit sketchy :)

@Pedrodemio I agree with you :) Next one will be shipped with bearings needed to be pressed in so they wouldn't fall out.

And now you have the gall to call me sketchy :thinking:

My bearings fall in and out of my trampa hubs too. I think the only interference fit we get is plastic...even though it doesn't seem right coming from our world's(me cars, you moto) where everything is interference fit...

This is great improvement for me, the first version did not have enough clearance for the horrible roads in my area. 17mm is a decent amount of road clearance.

I bet it does mate! There's no doubt you have the ability to destroy them utterly.

But you have to bear in mind that these are not only a beta product, but even alpha will be beta, everything about the esk8 game is experimental. The VESC is classified as an experimental product.

This very forum is a beta business; the art of the build; the thrill of pushing yourself over the challenges encountered.

Why not instead challenge yourself to address the falling out bearing in the flywheel hub, instead of pushing that back on 3DServisas? 

A few drives were made including yours to the same spec, @Deckoz has had success inferering that your own components led to the failure, now assuming that you drive was not a one-off I think the problem falls into your lap regardless of pre-sale conversation. 

I say this looking over at the corner of the room at a 3Dservisas ATB 5:1 drive mounted onto some wobbly 9" wheels on a Trampa HolyPro which is waiting for the arrival of some Superstars from @trampa. It's my problem. Maybe they will wobble when Superstars go on at which time I'll talk to 3DServisas privately.
 
I don't have this particular drive in the arsonry and don't really intend to, as I've just mounted some pulleys from @dickieho for my 107s. With a Flywheel hub there is room for the bearing to fall out between the adapter and the wheel iteslf am I getting that right? Does @Deckoz's guide not help? 
Why not shim the bearing if the wheels don't hold them securely?

Anyway, choice appears to be
1. Thor's hammer and photos - money back, dissapointment I think you'refeeling already to destroy something with potential that is very nicely machined.
2. Send back at your coin to get same refund. No destruction, bit more expensive lesson.
3. Fix it.

**Edit:** Just realised we're talking about another product - Fatboy wheels, thread is here,maybe keep it on the same topic?
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fatboy-solid-core-hub/46781/86

I did not notice a problem with bearings falling out, maybe the bearings are ever to slighly undersized. I would doubt you got a set with differrent tolerances tbh. No load should go on the bearings laterally, a bit of threadlock would probably do it. The end of the hanger and the nut should keep everything in the right place.

But only because I machined the baseplate + use thiner Motormounts and use low profile nuts (with red Loctite).

Great, 

I just did 2-3 rides as I'm very busy. More than increased efficiency/range it's more that there is almost no gap in between when you give it throttle and when the board moves, same thing when braking. Also there's not much drag, I could push the board quite well with a 1:3 reduction ratio. The only downside is that is a bit loud, but as @Kug3lis says, that helps to be noticed when you're riding around town. But overall I like it a lot. 

I mounted the motors facing backwards and I had to add washers because the axle of the motor was a bit too long and I didn't want to trim it, so I needed to shave the trucks a bit but it was very quick with an angle grinder. 

Overall I found it to be a very quick install, all the tolerances were great, I put some threadlocker on the outside to make the bearing not move inside the plastic housing as suggested above. I did some tests like hard acceleration and hard braking and everything is holding up so far. Haven't reached max speed yet but I tried going at at high speed and I like a lot the response when braking.
I'll probably do a build thread soon when I'll complete the build and manage to use them more.

Hey guys some news regarding FlyWheels 1:3 Gear Drive. There were some design changes and some new stuff happening with this drive.

A design was changed to a sealed aluminium housing with a choice to submerge gears in oil for silent operation. (Oil fill port, V-Ring included). Now fits 6374 motors on all angles thanks to included CNC machine 230mm Caliber II style hanger made out of 7075 Aluminium with Titanium axles. (Maybe would fit 6380 at some angles).

FatBoy 230 Hanger will be available to buy separately for those who want to use 6384 with wider belts (should work with all Calibre || style mounts)

![27%20PM|690x465](upload://jCAuRLutQSuosAbSOOF8VZuMAv5.png)
![33%20PM|690x352](upload://7VTDLit9ZDAF4WLhQGTFKbhQH19.png)

Prices would be:

* FatBoy Mini Drive Train + FatBoy 230 Hanger would be 400€ (excl. VAT) + Shipping
* FatBoy 230 Hanger 100€ (excl. VAT) + Shipping

Prices can be decreased if we could make a group buy...

Now several questions:

# Would you be interested in buying one?

[poll type=regular public=true name="a"]
* Yes
* No
[/poll]

# If there would be a group buy would you participate in buying it?

[poll type=regular public=true name="b"]
* Yes
* No
[/poll]

Depending on answers we will decide to make this or not, because on the standard TB218 hanger without sacrificing gear quality and running into clearance issues is not really possible to run bigger motors than 6355. It does not apply to all decks but most popular decks and angles will run into issues. We don't want to release "working" product to the market.

Hello,

I was curious if anyone with this setup or any other FatBoy drive train in the USA has a good recommendation for grease/lube that can be obtained here? I have been sitting on this kit for a while and ordered it before it came with the "Gear oil Molykote G-67" as part of the kit but seems hard to get here. I took a test ride without grease just to make sure everything was working but definitely want to add it for smoother operation. 

@Kug3lis or Anyone?
