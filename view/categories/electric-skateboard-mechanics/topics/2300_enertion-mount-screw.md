While on one of my first test rides, it seems that I didn't put enough Loc-Tite on my motor mount screw, and one came loose and disappeared somewhere in my neighborhood. Can someone please tell me what spec bolt that the Enertion Mount uses? 
Caused me to break my phone, and now I can no longer ride my EBoard :sob:

If you mean the bolt that clamps the mount to the truck it's an M6.

take the second one you still have to your local hardware store and just buy an exact copy... Maybe even a few extras!

Are they both supposed to be the same length? On mine one of the screws is 25mm long and the other is 20mm long. I'm also not if the longer one needs to go at the top of the mount or bottom.
