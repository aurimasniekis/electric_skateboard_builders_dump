Any got some? I’m trying to make a clamp for them but don’t actually have any.  Caliber 2’s will always do better business than Paris it seems...

Why don't you download the plans for the old enertion mount? It'd give you the dimensions...

It doesn’t have the dimensions for the clamp anywhere I can find, just the mounting plate
