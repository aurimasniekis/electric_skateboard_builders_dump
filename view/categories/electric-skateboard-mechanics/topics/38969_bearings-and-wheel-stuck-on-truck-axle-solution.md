Hello everyone,

Today I tried to remove my electric skateboard front wheels from the truck to change the bearings of both wheels. 
What happened next I've never seen or experienced before :fearful: ....
So, after removing the truck axle nuts and the washers on both sides I pulled the wheels and none come out. 
Strange, they usually come out very easily after removing the axle nut but I thought Ok, maybe they need some lubrification.
So I took my WD40 spray and put some on both bearings on both wheels.
I let it stay for a while (5-10 min) and tried again, without luck.
At this point, I decided that they might need some strong persuasion so I went to get the hammer and hammered the wheels.
One come out immediately with just one bearing and the spacer inside, the second bearing remained stuck, I mean like glue, to the end of the truck axle. This bearing doesn't come out. I already tried hammering it, pull with pliers and she didn't even move.
On the other wheel, I already tried everything and it doesn't come out from the axle :sob:....
I swear I'm freaking out with all this :triumph:.
If anyone can help me and give some advice I would reeeaalllllyyy appreciated ;).

I guess they burned up on the axel. Try to use blow torch or heat gun to heat them up so they would expand :D

Easy, put it in a vise and crank it down. It’ll shatter all over the place with sparks. Be careful when you do it 

Bearings are super brittle

You won’t be able to damage the axle. Just place the bearing on a hard surface and one quick hit

Get the hanger and go outside, and smash the sidewalk with the bearing

You're probably the only person to have it happen.  With enough data points, all possibilities trend into existence...


I would smash the outer bearing race to shatter it, and then put a SMALL torch on the inner race and try to pull it off hot -- making sure the axle and truck get LESS hot than the bearing race, so they expand less than the race does

One in a million, such a luck :triumph:
I will see if Koowheel send me a new truck but I really doubt it. If this was the only problem, great, but the board arrived at less than 1 week and I already also had problems with the hub motors bearings too :expressionless:

Have Koowheel send a technician out to remove it for you.  :-\

That would be great but its really unlikely. I possess 2 years of warranty in their German warehouse but it's been almost a week changing e mails with my seller to solve the situation and everything stays the same. 
I also have put some YouTube videos to show the problems, so they can sent to the quality department or the people responsible for repairs authorization, but it was almost useless.
Its a great board for the price but this problems are so annoying and easy to fix that I really don't understand.
I guess the different languages don't help and some information may get lost on the way...

I don't know if I can put the link for the videos here so forgive me for any infraction :)

I explain my point of view of the problems in the videos description...

My view is the unit is defective and should be returned.  The wheel wrapper surface is not round.  That's a HUGE problem.  Also one motor acts different than the other one.  Clearly a sign of something wrong

Use a blow torch and ice cubes. The metals are different and will expand at different rates. It will not take much heat, you need to heat the bearing and cool the axel.

I would think a gear puller would also work in this situation?  My V3 has this issue on one axle I’m dreading the day I need to clean the bearing because it’s hard to get it off since the wheel adapter gets in the way of most tools. Probably need to destroy that bearing when it comes time

Well its another option to consider xD. I didn't know that exists but checked youtube and seems very effective in particular cases

I think the simplest approach is to put it in the freezer.  Use cold first. Than the heat and ice method.

Get something hard (best if it's metal) then put it on something and give it a good old smack

I had this issue before, I ended up hammering the shit out of the bearing until it spitted all balls like fireworks, then I desperately hammered the inside of the damn sticky bearing ring even more for 15 minutes until the f..king axle broke apart, threw the whole piece of broken crap to the trash, even the f...king hammer! 

Sorry if I was of any help. Just needed to vent

Update to the situation: Today the seller agreed in sending the board to the Germany warehouse of Koowheel for quality control and free repairs, of course.
I also asked for a new truck. I know the paint damages that mine possess were made by the different tries I made to remove the bearings and wheels but, in first place, if they weren't stuck this haven't happened...
Let's wait to see :unamused:

Guys I have another doubt about a different topic: trucks bolts and nuts. The quality of this materials is important or basically they are all the same in terms of quality and longevity?.
Someone told me I should avoid stainless steel screws /bolts, why is that?.

Cheers 👍

For me they are all the same, except for the price :joy:. How do you check the quality of a bolt, what points should I pay attention?. They are to secure the trucks to the board
