In addition, just looking up standard htd 5m belts, they are expensive, (not even considering student discounts). Your better off looking somewhere else.

Only time mcmaster-carr is good is for sponsorship of school projects, unless you buy a lot to keep costs down....

Why the herringbone pattern? That's just expensive to produce for pulleys
