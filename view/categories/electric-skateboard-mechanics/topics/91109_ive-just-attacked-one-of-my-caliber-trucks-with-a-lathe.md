Because I've just got my hands on this, a bearing mounted wheel pulley

So I cut 19mm of truck allowing everything to slide together nicely. I did find that the truck axle was knurled but quickly skimmed that off

What RPM did you run and how much wobble did you get?  Gotta face down a Paris V2

Kept it really low, 200rpm for the out of balance centre but no wobble on the cutting face

And just chuck the axles in the jaws and a tail stock or something in between?

Yup, wanted to run a couple of standard sk8 bearing in the tailstock chuck but it's only 1/2" capacity so gripped a wheel spacer in there instead and once the tailstock was locked down had no runout at all
