My first build was on a super stiff drop deck which is good because Iâ€™m 200 lbs. i was able to get away with a single enclosure because the deck was very stiff. I am now thinking of doing a second build mainly for my son and I bought a used arbor deck  because it had brand new Orangetang kegels on it -$40 - great deal:).   This arbor deck is super flexy and honestly feels a little cheap compared to the other.  My question is do I spring for another new deck or should the arbor be good enough and if I use the arbor should I go with a 2 enclosure setup due to the flexy deck. If I am going that route should I dremmel a channel or will it compromise the board.  I think the arbor is 6 layers of bamboo whereas my first board is 9 layers of bamboo and maple. 
First build.

I think that for your son it should be good. If you want a good combo you should go

Man I have a very similar arbor deck on a focbox meepo for my son and i routed out the thickness of the battery cabling with no issues.  Once done though fill the channel with either silicon on hot glue otherwise it bulges up through the grip.  I would suggest polyurethane but then I'm not sure you'd ever get the wires out should you need to.  I used clear silicon.
