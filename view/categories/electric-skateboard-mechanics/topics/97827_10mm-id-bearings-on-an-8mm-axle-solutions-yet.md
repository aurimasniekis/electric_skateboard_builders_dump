so i scrubbed old threads and heres what im looking at/for.

Id like to try some 8" budget tires... they have the 10mm ID bearing and assuming you can swap out the bearing (cuz i dont want the hassle nor to hit a wall and be denied) lets just roll with what we got... then we got trucks that have the 8mm axle. Im looking for a US domestic option for a sleeve of some sort. Not board bumper from AUS. Not looking to lathe either. So do we have a solution or option that sleeves and makes this magic happen with out either buying a higher end truck with a 10mm axle?

thx

Could you simply buy a pipe with internal 8mm hole and 10mm OD.. ?

I've made these a few years ago. No issues. It's basically the same thing as using a pipe

Go to a local maschine shop and ask for them to make the "sleeve" for you, its a 15min job for them

What are the outer diameter? I use 638 bearings (8x28x9) in my Trampa wheels to use it on standard axles

yeah Im being cheap considering the budget 8" tires which have the bearing pressed in...so a simple bearing swap wouldnt be so simple but a PITA... trampas could be an option yes but trying to build a budget 8" in the near-far future =)

Yup that's right. But in my case I had to extend the axel diameter and the lenght of the axel to fit trampas 8"  .

how much axle do the trampa hubs need? the budget 8" ask for 47mm...

either way more axle is needed so TBs wont work... Ive got a good feeling for the new baseplate/hanger combo boardnamics has coming out... rough specs at 220mm hanger with something like 45-50ish mm of axle which should work...

theres always the knock off trampas too...looking for that old thread again...feel like someone said they were slightly cheaper (could do the bearing swap easier) then would just have to find budget pulleys for them...if theres even a source for that =/

to many ideas draining my wallet lol

I don't remeber how much they needed. I have one extra sleeve at work that I can measure tomorrow

I think Trampa sell reducers for so you can fit their bigger bearings onto 8mm axles... might just be for the 9.xxx diameter bearings though, can't really remember

Those looks nice. Not sure they will end up much cheaper then buying from trampa tho.. But you'll get the aluminium pulley wich is nice. I've used 3d printed pha/pla pulleys with my trampa wheels for years. That's a cheap option aswell.

Edit.
Ffs that's a 1:1 copy of trampa's hubs :expressionless:
Support the original designer instead and I'll send you the pulley stl file
