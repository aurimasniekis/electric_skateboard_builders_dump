I have a diyeboard 10s5p-kit board and it has an annoying rattle when driving over any type of pavement which is not perfectly smooth concrete.

I am sure it is not the ESC as I have padded it considerably. I am suspecting the bearing-spacers or the pulley in the wheel, but I need advice here.

Hope someone have some good advice, I have heard from metroboard-users that lubricating the pulley-part mounting to the abec flywheel reduces sqeeking, but what my board got seems to be more rattling than sqeeking.

Grateful for any feedback! :slight_smile:

I'd check for simple things as well, like a loose spacer.

For me it was a motor bearing. Annoying rattle gone with new one.

if you have belt drive, then you have 1 or 2 motors that are running those belts. Those motors have bearings inside.

if it has no rattle on smooth pavement.  There probably something loose in your enclosure.  Just velcro everything down or pad the inside of your enclosure. It can be a connector banging on something.

I can record my rattle so you can compare it with yours. I still have it on one of my evolve GTs.  Never bothered to change those on this deck.

Very good point, its just wierd because it sounds like its coming from the rear truck and its kinda a deep-ish rattle-sound. If the weather is nice tomorrow I will try to record it to better explain what I mean.

Thank you for taking your time to reply! ðŸ˜„

No. Only on rough asphalt.

That's kinda what mine did before snapping in half.....
Light noise, kept thinking it was pullys, pully cover (pully cover did come loose a few times)

There you go. First on smooth pavement then on rough.

Sounds promising, glad my wrist guards are arriving in a few days..

No but seriously, hope came away from it without any injury man!

Gona check for cracks etc, but hoping its not a bad cast of the trucks of course.

Check the belt covers, thats what rattled on my diyeboard kit. Be careful of the trucks, they may snap

Thank you, gonna check tomorrow! Were they loose to the point where you had to tighten them by a lot or just by the millimetre? Just looking for clues on what to look for when investigating tomorrow :slight_smile: 

Did yours snap at any point?

They will be loose just a little bit.

I did have mine snap. Had it for about 2 months, had ridden maybe 150km before it snapped.I am not the only one, with at least a handful of other people have theirs snap as well

Thank you for the info, hope you came away from it safely thats not nice. 

I have heard that there is a bit of a snapping-problem going on at the moment yeah, hoping I recieved a cast made before the bad batch (ordered in may) but I guess I (hopefully) will never know.

I believe I may have found the problem, one of the motors is able to move a bit. Is there any way to fasten it more?

Update: These screws were loose, gonna loctite them and fasten properly, hopefully case closed

Update 2: the deeper-sounding part of the rattle was likely caused by the motors beeing loose (warning to all other diyeboard-users, fasten and loctite these!). This did not cure the lighter-sounding part of the rattle however, but I am quite sure this is caused by me not tightening the wheel nuts enough. Will test now and leave (hopefully) a final conclusion :slight_smile:

**Conclusion:**
The rattle is now completely gone, it was the loose motors that caused the majority of the rattle and semi-loose nuts on the wheels which caused the rest. _Case Closed!_

**_Warning to all DIYEBOARD users: Loctite your motor-screws shown in the picture above, I am lucky they did not fall off completely at speed!_**
