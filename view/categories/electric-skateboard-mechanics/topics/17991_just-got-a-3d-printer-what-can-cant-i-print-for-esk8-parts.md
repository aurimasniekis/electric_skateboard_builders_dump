Basically as the title states, just got a maker select v2, having a lot of fun with it and now I want to start printing stuff for my next build. I want to build more of a mountainboard type thing, with nice big pneumatic tires. I doubt I will ever take it off road, but I would like to have that ability. I am planning on using some motors/vescs from @chaka and i'll probably just scour amazon for the other board parts.

Things that I want to know if I can 3D print:
-Motor mounts: I know there are 3D files out there, but those seem to be for regular longboard esk8s and im not sure if they would be strong enough for what i want. Note: i am thinking of a mount style like this, where i would print the motor mount parts and then the cross braces could be wood, metal, or 3D printed if they could be strong enough. diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torque-trampa-dual-motor-mount-kit/
-Battery pack/holders: I am planning on using recycled 18650 batteries so i would like to have a pack style where it is easy to pop them in and out if they fail. Sort of like "regular" battery holders with springs and stuff.
-Pulleys for the wheels

So, are those reasonable things to print on a 3D printer? Or am I crazy?

I use 3d printed covers for VESC and batteries, and printed pulleys
I print the gears in PTEG with 100% infill

I dont know if I trust motor mounts to plastic.. motors may get hot, and PLA get soft at 50C, a melted gear is fine,, just change it..
A melted mount, can destroy motors or face :-/

I am planning on upgrading my extruder to a E3D full metal, so i could print in some more exotic materials and hopefully not have melty issues : P

if you were to print "sleds" for the 18650 cells I'd be interested in helping design it for copper and springs.  or it's probably already designed, I like this one:

thats a pretty big brick though, you going to try to fit it under a board I imagine.   how bout going for a single layer deep.  18mm wide.  12s 6p.  a monster.  maybe  you aren't trying to go under the board

Im just getting into 3D printing...but I've printed 2 enclosures, gopro mounts, headlight mounts, wheel pulleys, a million little baubles :), etc.  You looking for anything specific?

**Can print:**
Wheel pulleys (80% infill PETG) - not tested with PLA or ABS
GT2B Controller housings (Mad Monkey, Baby Buffalo, Sparkle, etc)
Pulley and belt covers
Enclosures for VESC, BMS, Receivers etc.

**Probably can't print:**
Motor pulleys - haven't tested but can't see them working well.
Motor Mounts
Enclosures for batteries.  I know a few guys print these, but I have serious concerns over their strength on rough high speed stuff with large batteries.  I'd trust a Velcro strap over a 3D printed enclosure.

Some test motor mounts.  I made it 1/2 inch thick at the truck, and 1/4 thick by the motor.

100% Solid infill PLA Black - no cooling fan, hot temps for good strength - failed after 30 miles

100% solid infill PETG Green - no cooling fan, hot temps for good strength - failed after 1 mile on a big bump - this surprised me.  Assumed it would last longer since PETG is more flexible.

maybe if you reinforced with some carbon the mount would hold up.  I bet.

It's interesting on carbon filled materials - this test showed the carbon filled PLA was significantly weaker than regular PLA.  I wonder if I made it larger to adjust for shrinkage then baked it if it would have worked longer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZX8eHC7fws

I also think Polycarb or Nylon would have held up fairly well, but those are really expensive materials, and really difficult to print with (moisture problems, heated enclosures, warping, etc)

Unless you mean carbon overlay on the 3d part?  That's an interesting idea and may work?

In the end though, nothing beats a good aluminum mount.

But then you would get size variations from the epoxy cover. Pretty much I'd just stick to metal, maybe plastic for testing.

I dont understand you.  why wouldnt epoxy and carbon covered 3d parts work?  I thought you could remake anything if you printed it, maybe stacked a bunch together, and then carbon it.  Someone on you tube made a 3d printed then carbon covered 747.  .   ok that didnt happen but i thought it could

If you want a strong and easy to print material use polymaker PC. I have been printing for a hobby and work for years and its by far my favorite material so far. Stronger than ABS with less shrinkage and no weird smell. http://www.polymaker.com/shop/polymaker-pc-max/

It does not get soft until around 115c so could work for hot applications. 

I have made wheel pulleys with it and they hold up really good.

I think a motor mount is possible but its going to require a really smart design to even out the stresses and probably quite a bit of trial and error.

Hi,

If you want a reliable printed board drive, you should try this one:

It is tested and durable.

Pretty cool!  Any thoughts on settings / materials?  Are those 50mm motors?  My mounts would fail riding over harsh bumps/cracks, did you any issues with that?

Material is whatever was in tbe printer at the time  pla or abs the mounts are so strong is does not matter. But they are so big that dual motors will only work diagonal. The motors are all sk3 6364 245kv. Running vescs with 14s8p battery's.

I don't have a pic right now, but we have these steel pins at work that might be a good fix.  I'm just thinking out loud here, but what if you printed the mount with a 3/16 hole from the hanger clamp end to the motor plate end on both the top and bottom, then glued a rod in both slots?

If anyone wants to try it I literally have hundreds of the rods from 5/64 to 1 1/2 inches.  I'd be glad to send a few for testing.  Failing that I've got a small double kick I'm working on, might try it on that.

I've been using my ABS wheel pulley for more than 300km and just a little wear

40% infill, the most important thing is to adjust the extrusion width so that your teeth has no voids inside it, and increasing the perimeters to 5 also help

Sure I'll upload them later just keep in mind these were designed specifically for the gullwing sidewinder 2 trucks they don't clamp but use the shape of the truck and get filled with around 2cm3 of epoxy.

I have been using all 3d printed parts on my longboard; Both big and small gears, motor mount. 

I chose to use a sheet of aluminum to build a casing for my lipos for 2 reasons. More fire proof than plastic, I hate waiting long prints.

While, I don't have a great amount of experience with printing, if you're able to add a small radius to the corners of the mount where it slides onto the truck your failure rate will decrease significantly.

Also does the failure surface look shiney near the corner?

PETG holds up well and is easy to print.  ABS works too but is a bit trickier to print (warp, heated enclosure, etc).  80% infill on pulleys works well.  PLA is probably a bad idea since it gets soft when it's hot.  My opinion is stay away from printing motor mounts.  On the fence with enclosures that have to hold a lot of weight like big batteries.  Probably fine for enclosures that only hold a VESC or other light weight stuff.  Pulleys and controllers are perfect for 3D printing with good settings.  Allows you to adjust gearing easily and print replacements easily.

Has anyone here applied fiberglass to their 3d printed parts ? I've recently made some enclosures for my build out of PETG and now want to use the final design. I'd like to reinforce it and I think coating it with sth. is the way to go ?
