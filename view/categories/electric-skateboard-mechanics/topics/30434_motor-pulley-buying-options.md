Trying to stick with 9mm belts on my dual drive I'm planning to build but finding 9mm width motor pulleys is actually insanely hard. I really dont want to shell out 40 bucks for 2 DIYes motor pulleys (why does it cost $10 to ship two pieces of small metal????) when ebay has stainless steel pulleys for $5 shipped. Sadly ebay doesn't have the specs I need.

However DIYes seems to be my only option as the industrial websites that sell pulleys are charging even more for inferior pulleys.

Anyone know any alternatives for 9mm/12mm wide pulleys with 8mm bore? 15-17Teeth.
