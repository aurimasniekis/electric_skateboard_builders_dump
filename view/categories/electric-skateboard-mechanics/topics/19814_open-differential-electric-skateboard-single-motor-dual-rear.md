I see one problem with this, a diff always chooses the path of least resistance, meaning if one wheel loses traction it will send all power to that wheel, whereas a dual drive would still power the wheel with grip. I imagine this may also be bad when braking?

That's definitely an problem, same thing happens in cars. It only really becomes an issue on snow/ice and other slippery surfaces. Seeing how that effects braking will be interesting though.

I'm just waiting for someone to do a 4wd with limited slip diffs so I can try to drift it.

Very interesting to see it in real life.
Have played with the idea quite a while, but couldn't solve the size problem of the differential.
Compare the truck to a regular one and check the axle to bushing distance. It's huge!
It makes the board high and gives a long lever for the pivot point of the bushing. I never realized it because I expected it to be unstable at higher speeds.
The the other problem is that it isn't an anti slip diff.
At low speeds and/or slippery surfaces it'll behave like a single drive.
Awesome concept but it will come with a huge price tag concerning all custom parts!

my concern is the heights. it could use dogbone and use higher kv inrunner to torque conversion, to reduce the h. But for that kind of ,u can only use for penu wheels. not very realistic. 

it would be more realistic to adapt some of leanboard design with dogbone adaptation.

Newbie here. Is this idea dead? Couldn't find much reference anywhere else, this thread seems to be the only one with serious conversation. And it's almost a year since the last post lol. Everyone seems to be moving towards hub motors at this point; is it that much more superior over a single motor with differentials? Am thinking primarily of the cost and weight savings, and with the differential, we can now place the motor in a different place (center of the board under the deck? Or on top of the deck, connected with belts through the deck?). Are there no parts available because no interest, or nobody likes the idea and thus parts were never found/built?

Thanks in advance!

I can understand wanting to have a diff with just one big motor but why an open diff? These are terrible in cars and will take away from performance. Where are the Helical LSDs or Clutch LSDs just please no torsen set ups lol

Imo a dual motor set up is a hell of a lot cheaper and less complicated than a proper differential set up that could emulate a dual motor set up and in the end you still have 1 motor vs 2.

Don't know the more complex differentials, only know the basic one, which I suppose is the open diff. Is the power loss bad? And an open differential looks like a simple enough device to mass make, certainly easier than a motor. I dunno, just a noob thinking out loud here.

***Yes, the idea is dead.***

Two motors (one per wheel) is much, much, much better than 1 motor.  The only reasons cars have differentials is because they can't fit/afford to use 2 engines.  The electric cars use one motor per powered wheel, just like esk8.

Essentially, you are adding complexity (increased failure rate) and weight for a worse end-result.

Also if one drive train were to fail, you'd have no brakes...

[/quote]

Open diffs suck.

Torsens are actually pretty good when you consider other factors compared to clutch/helical(outside of function)

Torsen will only let loose when the limits of adhesion on both tires have been exceeded, whereas the open diff will let loose when the limit of either tire is exceeded regardless of the condition of the other tire.

Also...dual motor with traction control... It's kinda already like a 1.5way

Traction isn't usually in short supply unless you have enough torque to spin the wheels.

The downside is adding more parts and ways to fail for no real benefit.  Cars use a differential as a workaround to a problem -- a problem you don't have on small electric vehicles.  You are adding more ways to fail in order to use a fix which adds failure modes.

It's a bit like cutting a piece of paper in half so you can use some badass tape to hold it together and comparing the quality to the uncut paper

@b264 what's the supposed downside of fully enclosed/protected gear reduction/differential as opposed to exposed belts which can slip/snap & with half as much traction?

and are we sure there's more moving parts to fail? seems to me like it's replacing one set of moving parts with a different set of moving parts while improving traction on high torque setups ie mountain boards...

lets count moving parts:

Belt Drive:
2 motor **2 wheel drive**-- (2) motor pulleys, (2) belts, (4) idler pulleys, (2) wheel pulleys
**(10)** total moving parts - half the traction

Differential Drive:
2 motor **4 wheel drive**-- (2) motor shaft/cogs, (2) crown wheels, (4) output cogs/shafts, (4) "small" gears
**(12)** total moving parts - 2 extra moving parts, 2 extra driven wheels & **twice the traction**

You forgot the two wheel anchors for the differential, so that's two more unless the axle spinning inside the wheel is okay :stuck_out_tongue:

Plus you should not compare belt to gear, compare gear to gear which means the non-differential method has only 4 moving parts: 2 motor gears, 2 wheel gears - ***4 moving parts total***.  

If you want to compare belt, then use a belt differential also.

So gear drive is 4 moving parts and gear differential is 14 moving parts.

So you've got 2 to 10 more moving parts now for no benefit.  I never reach the point of my polyurethane wheels skidding because they don't have enough traction.

You're searching for a problem with a solution in your hand.

If you REALLY want to find a use for this "solution" then find a way to make a shittier esk8 using a differential -- THAT'S CHEAPER than a regular one.  If you can make it dirt-cheap (and maybe shittier) then it will be a real solution

The differential system would have to be cheaper than another motor and drive circuitry -- but it'd have to offer some benefit over a 1 wheel drive system (which I fail to see that part as I ride a 1-wheel drive all the time)

Honestly an open differential seems to give you little to no benefits.

You're likely much better trying to simulate a LSD.

In a dual motor drive you could theoretically have a friction pad between the two cans' ends. Won't generate any heat during normal operation as wheel speed differential is minimal unless one has lost traction. If one slips you get a little extra power through to the other side. This in conjunction with traction control integrated in the two vescs would limit how much the unloaded motor could slip against the one still with traction(sets a maximum speed difference between motors), effectively limiting how much wear / heat could be generated on the pads.

This really shouldn't be all that hard to implement, considering a lot of motors already have threaded holes on the backside. Definitely would be motor and mount specific though.

No, both back wheels would be on the opposite side from one another, regardless if a differential was used.  For example, one wheel on the left side and another wheel on the right side

&nbsp;

With dual motors the wheel with more traction would be *powered* by its own motor
On a differential, the power would be robbed by the slipping wheel

my point is with 2 motors regardless of dual motor & differential (4WD) vs. dual motor & belt (2WD)--

in both cases with one slipping wheel there is still one or more other driven wheels on the board via the second motor.

so if both options lead to a second motor-driven wheel, I don't see it as a deficit acting against the dual motor dual differential option.

In either case 2 motors will give you at most 2 powered wheels.  So having the extra complexity of the differential system is just added weight and failure rate for no more benefit

First of all, your use of "4WD" and "2WD" is misleading at best because a single differential and motor would be given the moniker "2WD" whereas two motors driving one wheel each is something totally different and definitely not the "2WD" thing

suppose the differential is "sealed" and comes with motor attached, to the end user it's effectively one part vs multiple- motor, belt, mount, pulleys, etc. i'm sure the innards could be engineered to be fairly durable despite a higher part count. then it's 4 wheel drive with only 2 motors & 2 differentials.

the advantage over a hub motor would be ability to use a high kv / high gear reduction combo for high efficiency...

Majority of people here want get board for cheap not pay 5k$ just to get same stuff you can get for 500$

P.S. high kv motors will burn on high reduction rate...

The only use this idea will have is if you can get it cheap enough so it's cheaper for a 1 motor w/differential than for a 2 motor -- and that 1 motor w/differential is SIGNIFICANTLY better for a broke college student than a 1 motor, which I can never see happening.  Unless you can do that, this idea seems dead

It's a solution looking for a problem

performance. by having all 4 wheels driven with 2 motors (instead of 2 wheels with 2 motors) the contact patch on the driven tires is twice as large, enabling more power to be applied to the road without slipping during acceleration, enabling faster potential acceleration using 2 motors than a 2 motors with gear drive.

Even in an ideal world, an open differential is horrible. You will gain nothing by having a motor twice the size drive two wheels. When one begins to slip, you lose power.

This is ESPECIALLY true because we LEAN to turn. You're going to end up with one side with very little weight on it, which means it is likely to slip.

The wheel that has less weight on it is is actually MORE likely to slip than on a dual motor system with motors half as strong.

So, you say, car's don't have this issue as much? That's because they have a **L**imited **S**lip **D**ifferential. If one wheel has lost traction and begins to freewheel a clutch tightenes up inside the differential and causes the two wheels to spin at more similar speeds.

AND STILL this kind of traction control isn't all that cars have now.

Cars nowadays have specialized control measures. If one wheel slips a car can actually engage the BRAKE on only that wheel, which is necessary because even an LSD isn't perfect. This causes the torque of the single motor to transfer to the other wheel, until the slipping one regains traction.

THAT is the closest in technology we've actually gotten to the ideal "one motor driving two wheels" perfect scenario without causing the problem of wheel slippage during turning caused by different arc lengths.

AND STILL the best technology we have in cars ISNT AS GOOD as the perfect scenario being described here. AND this is ignoring the important detail that CARS DONT LEAN nearly as drastically as skateboards do. Even a full miniature car traction control system wouldn't work as well on a skateboard as a car operates normally.

So. To top this off. In order to get close to anything like a cars differential you will need:
A pinion gear driven by a motor
Which drives a sun gear
Which turns a gear housing
Which rotates two gears each powering one wheel
Connected to each other by an idler gear (at LEAST 1)
In-between all of this are multiple sets of clutch pads
Two disk brakes, one for each wheel
An electronic control system to control each brake, which must integrate with:
At LEAST two sensors, one measuring each wheels rotational speed.
 
And **FINALLY** to top it off, this system STILL won't function to your expectations. The ideal system described doesn't exist.

"O but what if it di-" **NO.**

I am totally confused as to what you are saying the benefit to having an open diff is. It's been said many times already, open diff is only because cars are cheaper with a single engine running to 2 or 4 wheels. If you shrunk a car down and could put a drive system on each wheel, why wouldn't you?

I look forward to seeing what you come up with, but I am in love with my dual drive system. I never have to worry about loosing traction, when I hit Ice with one wheel, I'm still going.

the dual differential motors can output more torque than the dual gear before they lose traction from too much mechanical power on a road surface, due to a larger total driven-wheel contact patch, so they can accelerate more quickly, and win the prize.

First of all, being able to spin the wheels is not good. A 10000 watt motor is not going to move you any faster than a 9000 watt motor. Once you lose the static rolling friction of the wheel your applied force is always going to be less. No matter how fast that wheel  spins.

Regardless of that, you should choose a dual gear, with both motors in the rear. You can apply more weight there, let's say 90% of your mass. So now, you have two motors with the frictional force of 90% of your weight, so 45% each.

In a dual differential system powering 4 wheels, your weight is not going to be evenly distributed to both the front and back, the acceleration will make sure of that. So the front motor is going to lose significant frictional force while the rear will maintain a reasonable amount, but unfortunately the rear is only powered by one motor.

A closed/locked differential driven by two motors in the rear is best for a drag race. But it makes turning very troublesome. Not usable for regular esk8.

![c700x420|690x414](upload://zP71o34u8k5WFPxL6GHzOED1gGF.jpg)

Ya see this? There's a reason the front isn't driven. Because in a drag race it provides almost nothing.

All you had to do was literally Google "drag race car" to see why a rear driven system is better.

Look no further than the world of 5th scale remote control car parts.

Hahahahah 😂 you guys think a 1/5th scale RC car differential is going to propel up to 200 lbs? Those cars are less than 30 lbs.

You're literally going to shred those apart.

These things transfer much less net power and operate at MUCH lower rpm's.

Oh, and I forgot to mention. RC car LSD's don't exist. They pack an open differential with thicker grease so it somewhat simulates an LSD like effect. But it's not a real LSD. That, or they just have a spring that pushes against opposing bevel gears. That really doesn't do much.

You guys are off your rockers if you think you can just strap an RC differential onto your board and call it good.

And ya know what? 9mm isn't enough.

People here use hardened steel 8mm axles for their motors and still have managed to snap them, and they are protected by a torque reduction! And now you're gonna directly drive a wheel with a 9mm shaft. And don't say you can add another speed reduction for each wheel. You can't, because the differential already has a pretty high gear ratio. And guess what, you can't use a higher KV motor to get higher rpm's because of the vesc erpm limit!

You can not use an RC differential for a skateboard propelling a human.

And not to mention (again) that NOBODY here has solved the issue of an open differential. Which, as we should all know by now, all RC cars use. (Except when they use closed differentials, but we can't use that for obvious reasons.)

I am speechless. You have literally just described how the rear motor loses traction. Your rear motor has just lost effective power. You have two separate motors. The front is not connected to the back. The lost power from the rear is not magically transferred to the front.

Yes. You are right that there is "no complete loss of power." Infact, it's the **exact same amount of power lost as a dual motor rear drive** loses when one wheel slips. So guess what. It's **exactly the same function as a normal dual motor setup.** You have gained NOTHING from having hundreds of dollars worth of differentials on your board.

the front motor could put out twice as much torque through the front wheels before loss of frontal traction (compared to dual geared board with one slipping wheel), since the contact patch for the remaining motor is doubled (2 remaining driven wheels).

I'm going to break this down for you.

A rider is 100 lbs. Each wheel has 25 lbs of weight on it.

The coefficient of friction is 1. Which means each wheel can output a maximum of 25 lbs of thrust.

Let's say the motor we're using output enough torque to supply 10 lbs of thrust.

In a dual rear driven scenario the board will normally output 20 lbs of thrust total, given that it has full traction.
If one wheel slips it can now give 10 lbs of thrust (we're assuming complete loss)

In a dual differential setup your front can supply 10 lbs of thrust, and your rear can supply 10 lbs of thrust normally. So 20 lbs of thrust total.
If one wheel slips, then that motors thrust is reduced to zero. The board now supply's 10 lbs of thrust.

Do you see how blatantly the same those are?

Let's say that the motors are bigger? Let's say they can output 25 lbs of thrust each. It's the exact same scenario. You will not be surpassing this amount of thrust.

The reason why? Because you will not be doing burnouts on your skateboard. We do not have motors that are capable of overcoming frictional force on pure power alone. Nobody has made a skateboard that can spin it's rear wheels on the road. And there's two reasons why:

We don't have motors and motor controllers that can output that much raw power.

And we are uncable of standing on a skateboard that supplies that much thrust.

That is why an open differential is not better.

All of this above is excluding the fact that upoun acceleration, the rear wheels receive more down force than the front. And as your motors become larger and you approach the theoretical limit for static friction between wheel and ground, the scenario begins to favor a rear wheel drive more and more, because the front differential becomes much more likely to spin at that point due to less down force. 

This is irrefutable. The math and physics are not on your side.

You're saying you can spin both wheels at once? Because if only one is spinning then that's a traction loss scenario, not a shear amount of raw motor power 'kinda thing.

If you're losing traction on one side, then you'd be just as likely to lose traction on that with a differential.

If the two motors can do burnouts from raw power, and we're in a scenario with one wheel slipping on ice, i think the dual differential can produce more remaining thrust from the one remaining motor without losing grip from raw power than the dual gear, say with a 300a controller, high kv, high gear reduction -- because I believe it takes more force to make 2 tires skid from raw power than one tire, because the contact patch is doubled.

Sometimes things need to get done, even if’s unpractical, a lot more expensive for the sake of learning something 

I can see where a dual motor 4wd board would be great

Back from my days of 4wd RC cars, the differentials were open, but they were loaded with a unbelievably thick silicone oil that made up to the limited slip functionality, and you could keep two diagonally opposite wheels in the air and still have enough traction to climb whatever you wanted

Probably the oil alone wouldn’t be enough for a person, but the friction pad idea that was mentioned above could be a way

But agreeing with everybody, if it’s a purely open differential you loose all advantage of having two wheels driven

Thank goodness, someone with facts has arrived

I had facts too. Software simulates a 1.5way LSD with two motors, why add more mechanical failure points. Just add more motors to canbus with traction control enabled.

Strange concept that

[quote="professor_shartsis, post:40, topic:19814"]
a different set of moving parts while improving traction on high torque setups ie mountain boards…
[/quote]
My 4wd has a set of very expensive diff locks for increased traction on loose surfaces.  Mountain boards would be the last place you'd need an open diff.  Little tiny diff locks with mini compressors or complicated electronics to activate.......yeah no. My stuff goes wrong just looking at it sometimes.

This is so so so true... Sometimes you haven't touched board and you are scared to go out in case something had happen while it was standing :D

Hey here's a thought why don't you look at building a live axle truck?  Bearings in the hanger so we get power to both wheels with one traditionally mounted belt/gear drive.  Be great for small commuters and kickers.

how about one motor on normal asphalt... gear drive vs differential... can the single motor w/ differential put out more power without inducing tire skid from power than single motor w/ gear drive? the differential motor power is transmitted through 2 wheels instead of 1... so less constraint on max acceleration with the differential, no?

On most cases I would say yes

After running dual drive for a long time and coming back to single, I say it’s really bad to have traction in only wheel, even with the slightest turn to the side of the non driven wheel you loose traction

But if you loose traction with one wheel with a open diff you loose all power

Now that is an idea. 4 motor 2wd. Dayum son. Burnouts for all.

I saw a guy on youtubes the channel was called back then "Electric bike" now it changed to something else. That nutcase of an Aussie had 3 bldc motors on a single belt drive powering the read tire of a trike. And those werent no sissy 6374's either...

Better yet have some kind of mechanism to switch which motor is driving the wheel so you can have a super low KV and a really high KV.

so by extension if a single motor powering 2 wheels via differential can transfer more motor power/torque to the road without inducing tire burnout (resulting in greater thrust/acceleration) than single motor w/ single wheel gear drive, it stands to reason that 2 motors powering 4 wheels w/ differential can transfer more motor total power/torque to the road without inducing tire burnout than dual motor w/ dual wheel gear, belt or direct drive, and therefore the differentials themselves are capable of transferring more power to the road from a given pair of motors enabling greater vehicle thrust and acceleration on normal asphalt than is possible with 2 motors via gear, belt or direct drive. regardless of how many motors are attached to each wheel-- above a certain motor power threshold, acceleration is limited by tire grip, not available motor power.

I remembered this thread while watching this video. Now I'm not technically inclined and was barely able to follow the ideas in this thread but maybe this video might be related to using a differential on electric skateboards.

And why then people say, that single motor dual wheels drive is impossible? I'im not about differential, but   locked rear wheels.

I'm also lose traction on turns.
