If you frequent the Evolve forum, as I did before deciding on a DIY build, beware of what you say now.

It looks like negative comments are removed, after that your account appears to be flagged and any new content you post, however rational is not approved.

Someone asked about Evolve wheel chunking, my response was terse but well founded, I tried to follow up a bit later with thread links and proof to help the chap make a decision and it was not approved, I have also lost loads of other forum privileges.

Make if this what you wish :slight_smile:

That’s why we are working on a gut out kit for the evolve, battery, esc controller and motors. For both carbon GT and the bamboo GTX.

It is definitely a way to breath new life into that old board, I started with a boosted and quickly moved to the Carbon GT, it's commercially ok, but battery life and the (purposefully) designed electronics to keep you locked out of the system and locked into their parts..........

NOT ANY MORE
