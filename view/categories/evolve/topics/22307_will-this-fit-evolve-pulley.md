Hey Everyone I just recently purchased the Evolve Skatieboards 32T pulley for their boards. I am wondering about fitment on my caliber trucks. (obviously I have to mod my trucks regardless but I am trying to figure out if I need to do any further modifications?

@longhairedboy uses this for some of his builds on caliber trucks. However, You have to shave off a huge chunk of trucks to make it fit (something like 20mm), additionally, you may have to chop off some of the pulley teeth width if you want to fit dual motors since they're 15mm.

true. i did both of those things. 

A decent chopsaw will make short work of that pulley.
