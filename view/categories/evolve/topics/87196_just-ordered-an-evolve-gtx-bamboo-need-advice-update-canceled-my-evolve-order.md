Dear Members

I was thinking about ordering a GTX All Terrain for quite some time now.
Yesterday I pulled the trigger and ordered one as it was off 10% and you can't get it cheaper than that in Europe I guess.

I already have a pretty strong DIY Longboard but needed one to go into the forest - a no brainer one stop solution and I thought the Evolve GTX might be a good idea.

I seen some posts that for some people the Remote doesn't work all the time but I am hoping that with the newest shipped units those problems get less.
Also I could imagine that it might be more of a problem in Crowded cities with lots of bluetooth and other signals.

So what I would really love to know is:

* If you own a GTX - what do you love about it?
* What do you hate about it ?!
* What was the most extreme terrain you have been with your board at ?
* Which mods would you recommend ?

Also it says it's water splash resistant, I don't plan do go through rain but would also like to know to which degree short rain bursts might affect the board ?

Thanks for your time,
Patrick

thanks for your input matt.
However I already bought the GTX and I wanted to try one out of the box board for once.
I don't really need crazy mileage.. just up the mountain a couple of kilometers and down shouldn't be the big issue.
The range of the GTX doesn't seem so bad by looking at all the reviews, but I will know once the board arrives mid of next week :slight_smile:

well, this is a sad moment.

you could've always made a 12s2p or something and had like 8km range and still had a better board than an evolve so yeah.. 

i look forward to seeing you wanting to upgrade everything on your board in future 😊

* If you own a GTX - what do you love about it?
**I don't own one but a couple of friends do. It seems ok but that is about it.**
* What do you hate about it ?! The battery. **One of my friends has upgraded the battery to a 10S4P VTC6. I can go on rides up to 20km with him. The other has the stock battery. He has to ride slow otherwise it sags too much and usually I end up having to tow him.** 
* What was the most extreme terrain you have been with your board at ? **It can go on hard packed dirt and a bit of gravel. It is an all terrain board, not a mountainboard.**
* Which mods would you recommend ? **New battery or better yet get a mountainboard if you want to go off road. Underdeck enclosures are not the best idea for off road**

Also it says it’s water splash resistant, I don’t plan do go through rain but would also like to know to which degree short rain bursts might affect the board ? **There is no gasket around the enclosure. Splash resistant at best though this can be easily fixed.**
[/quote]

My thoughts in bold.
For a few hundred euro more you could build a true mountainboard.

Thanks for the comments.
Yes you might be right - but I would have to test if it will hold up to my expectations.

If not then I can still decide to go the Mountainboard DIY route - however I don't have the time to plan and build anything at the moment that's why I chose a prebuilt one to see how it goes

I think i may of got one of the first boards with an r2 remote. they had not started selling them yet on the store if i recall correctly. i have not had any problems at all with the new remote they sent me. The people at Evolve Australia are very nice and willing to help with any problems i have had.

yea sorry bud I'm not here to be told how to speak. didn't look to insult you. im simply stating a fact that over time the battery **_will_** sag terribly, and for a similar price point you could have the satisfaction of riding something you proudly built.

and in the politest way possible, I've been here a fair bit longer than you so please don't tell me im going overboard with my attitude

I'd only bother using the All-terrain wheels even though i have the 2-in-1. On gravel hills with a full battery in GT mode you should not have any problems with power, just traction!

Like I said - I might have reacted to the things you stated basically saying:

* your investment is shit - you will soon see that it sucks
* This forum is esk8.builders - build your own board or gtfo
* That you are looking forward on seeing me fail with my GTX (and admiting you have been right)

So if you think that I on my side was a little bit overreacting to your kind recommendaitons. Then I am sorry.

I will just admit now that I spend 1650 € on something that totally sucks and you are right.
So now we can move on.

Breaking is on point. It certainly is a good investment. If you want something that is not going to have any problems and just work (that's what a love about mine, i can always count on it to get me to where i need to go)
what gravel paths and trails are you going on? is it very soft?

@RyuX dude forgetting all I said before, here's what i think of the evolve after i hopped off my diy (you said you have a diy yes?)

i have the mini remote on my diy and find it super responsive and love it. on the r2 remote it has nice feedback but alot of people have reported drop outs. also, on gt mode the brake (pedal, lever thing..?) is really really touchy. imo it should be as powerful as how it can accelerate. i find the brakes ott.

2nd-ly, in gt mode you get very little range. and once you're below 40%, there's almost no acceleration due to the battery not being able to hack it. 

3rd, at speed the supercarves aren't very stable. but that's just me i like going in straight lines fast not in squiggly lines slow. 

and last i find theres a lack of programmability and control, but that's just a perk of a prebuilt. 

we went on a 13km ride the other night and a bloke came along on a brand new gtx with at's and ran out of range at about the 8km mark. 

for the price i just don't believe the performance is optimum

Since I already built a custom landyachtz street esk8 board I also wanted to just have something that I will use for some forest paths. So shouldn't be too hard - only my Landyachtz board is a lowrider and it only has one 6374 motor and I didn't want to change the whole concept of my board so I decided to go for a prebuilt solution for once.

Well yes I do have a street diy board.

The GT battery restriction might be problematic going uphill.. judging by the youtube reviews it didn't seem so bad.. But if you say its only 8km.. might get problematic

Also on a second note - I will not close my mind to the reality that it might in fact be a bad purchase.
However I can't imagine that so many people are still happy with their boards and on the other side there are many people just hating them I can't really evaluate in which category I will fall.

Worst case is that I will sell it again and start building a mountainboard when I have time (however earliest in the summer).

Best case - I will like the GTX and can use it right away

You can investigate

I have never bough from them but this seems like a good product.
This would allow you to put trampa wheels on your gtx.
I would first try the evolve alternative.

The only reason someone might be happy with an evolves range, speed, disconnection issues, as well as poor CS and paying an arm and a leg for replacements is that they've never gone diy

And yet here you are... After finishing a diybuild

I'll give it a month for your honeymoon  phase to die down 😂😂

Here's a thread on upgrading your evolves battery, you'll need to after about a month or two of any significant amount of riding. The thing with evolves batteries, just like other batteries is that once out of the factory, the battery will never hold it's previous charge as well as the next. This is extremely amplified for evolve builds as they use cells that are pretty awful. When you upgrade you're going to want either LG hg2 cells, or 30q for the best range/discharge current balance

Guys. The GTX is not a bad board (well apart from the battery) and it honestly just works.
It is just that for the amount of money it costs if you are into DIY you can build something a lot better.

I've only ridden one once, for about 50 feet. I slammed the throttle in gtx mode and watch the battery percent dip like a stripper on a pole... 

If nothing else,scrap the shitty battery and the electronics combo. If they don't bite you now,they will later. It's a game of "when will it fail" and not "if it does fail"

To be fair, I'm just regurgitating information based on what I've seen before regarding their CS. However, I think that draing with evolve Australia will be significantly different than the rest of the world. (I think this next sentence is true, correct me if not)I'm fairly sure Evolve Australia is more compelled to help due to local laws, where as I've heard of people having issues getting even the most simple items in the US

Maybe it's also only I want to compare how a prebuilt board handles.
I am the only one that has a esk8 in my area so I don't really know anything.
Maybe it's only my curiosity.

Let's see how my build compares to a prebuilt one. In all honesty I already know that mine will be a lot more powerful and have more range than the gtx.
Currently I can go around 50km with one charge and the power on the 6374 is insane.

Almost the same thing happened to me! Was bombing it down a hill, applied the smallest amount of break, and the belt snapped like a rubber band.

I know it's not on the gtx, but if you're ever tired about belts breaking you could always give a gear drive a chance :P

Please, when you get the gtx, do a screw/bolt tightness test. Test EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM

Don't want anything falling off/out while you ride o.O

I've only heard of one case where someone got loose screws, but it's never worth finding out when it's too late

If the GTX sucks - and I will sell it then I might consider this for my next build.
Just didn't have the time to research and put together all mountainboard parts.

So a little laziness on my part for sure influenced the buy decision.
But yeah I think it sucks that you cant change the ESC Parameters yourself and update the firmware - kinda restrictive but understandable as they would have to deal with a lot more complaints/warranty/issues if people would mess around by themselves not knowing what they are doing.

In a few months I'll have my trampa done, if youre still looking for inspiration for a GTX esque board. 

I'm trying to go for a mixture between AT and 'street' style board, something with large wheels that can do grass/gravel (could do more, but the gtx isn't an AT board, and while the battery is mounted under the board, IMO it can't be defined as an AT board) with plenty of power and range

I agree with Harry, ride it first. Depending on your weight, trigger discipline and region (temperatures) the gtx might perform on one end of the curve, versus the other.

Yes true that.
I guess you cant DIY the battery pack can you ? it always looked very small judging by the photos and I heard something about some special BMS locking to the ESC.

My weight is 75 kg and I plan to go up mountainroads with slight gravely paths. just for some fun - maybe some drifting here and there - no real speed freak I rather prefer to have a flex board that moves well.

Fingers crossed

What do you mean? If you ask if I get wheel spin, that depends on the tarmac surface but generally no.
Off road yes, but I don't use it off road as I have my Trampa for that.

And please. Please please please please please PLEASE get a battery that can flex if you're sticking with the GTX. A normal battery will quickly become toast in that enclosure if it can't deal with the forces the bending board puts on it

How the hell did I reply to myself? Lol I clicked the blue one at the bottom.... :roll_eyes:

Looks like you're no stranger to pushing your temperature to the max. I can't say for sure but I would think that if you're doing pulls like that constantly on the evolve, the range is going to be abysmal. You're chomping through amps on your way up that hill 😂

Also be wary of the evolve ESC and high temperatures, I don't know if it functions like our vescs and restricts power, or if it just shuts off.

Just something to think about 😂

Was not aware of the "technology" that evolve used for their batteries.

Seems that the GTX at least has the same battery as the GT Carbon. So it shouldn't suck as bad as the GT Bamboo.

A nice range estimate trick for 30qs is that 10-14wh is equivalent to one km of distance

I can't believe no one has mentioned that the range on there is the most optimal range possible. With them riding as slow as humanly possible, with either no rider, or the lightest person you could imagine.... But it gets worse unfortunately. :( 

That range is only with urethane wheels, expect a 1/2 efficiency rate when you switch to the all terrain wheels

Start

360wh -> 36km 

Account for pneumatic tax

36km /2 -> 18km

account for voltage sag

18km - > 15km max

and you're left with probably 10km of fast riding, and then 5km of Eco mode

I'm really not trying to make you regret your decision, I. Just trying to lay it all out for you 😭😭

I will never regret it - like mentioned earlier I am the only esk8er in my area.
Having built three boards already of which I only kept the strongest one I was never really sure if I did a good job or not.
I mean the board handles great - is even too powerful for my taste and has great range, but who know's what "professional" companies come up with ?

Thats why I wanted to try a "premium" board and see how this compares.
If it can go up the hill and go down again without breaking I might keep it and upgrade some things along the way.
However if the sag is really that bad and they also didn't improve on any of the newer revisions than I might have to bite the bullet and sell it for a couple of hundred euros less and move on planning my Mountainboard project.

The board is not cheap - my estimation for building my own mountainboard was around 2k € and with sourcing the parts and building and maybe also drawing some 3D printed parts in CAD, finetuning everything might set me back around 2 months.

So 1,6k € and a out of the box solution just sounded so much more convenient :rofl:

I can't argue with you there, but dollar/km ratio for prebuilts is mind-blowing high. If you can afford it, go for it :) 

I just know I couldn't spend 1.6k of my dollars on something that only takes me 9 miles. A 2k mtb would be astronomically more powerful and have a range of at least 20 miles 

All depends on the buyer in the end. I hope you make threads about modding the evolve if you decide to do so, more documentation for the community is always a good thing

I'll try to keep this as unbiased as possible. Just some facts for you.

I owned a GTX before building, 

One motor seized on the first ride due to a broken magnet, I returned the board and they replaced the motor. 
Two days later the second motor went, same process.
Remote disconnects happened several times in 2 months
Remote calibration was required before every ride due to it being thrown out and braking failing
Sag threw me into a bush half way through the battery "capacity" because they use cheap batteries and conservative settings (because the battery is cheap)

Positives:
The deck is great
The double kingpin's are fantastic for slow cruising

My recommendation is to either cancel your order right away or return it before you ride it. It's extremely overpriced for what you get and you will not be doing any "offroad" with it. It will vibrate and fall apart internally.

Build a mountain board with your money and never look back.

With that in mind, be aware of who you are dealing with. 

Ride super carefully, if you scratch a motor mount for example, even within your "money back" period, they will charge you 60 euros to replace it. If you miss clearance and scratch your enclosure you're in for 100 plus euros.

Evolve have a shit load of returns, QC is non existent and they have build their customer service centers around not accepting returns or charging as much as possible to ensure they can still profit from your buyers remorse.

I still highly suggest not riding it. Your money to waste though!

He can return this one, I get what you're saying but there's still a way for this gentleman to not get ripped off by Evolve here. They offer a money back guarantee if you're not happy with the board and if it's not received yet he can cancel this order. At least that way he won't have to cover return shipping.

@Ryux , if you can cancel it do it.
If you don't want to build a board from scratch, get a Trampa complete (change the motors if you can), make a LiIon battery for it or just get a couple of Lipos it will cost more but you will have a proper mountainboard.

Finally another question. The boosted board has a 200Whr battery and the Evolve GT a 234Whr battery. The boosted board claims a range of 12 miles whereas the evolve gt 21 miles. I honestly can’t see how such a difference is possible (considering the boasted board uses less powerful motors) unless Evolve runs the battery down to lower voltages which is never good for a LiPo or any type of Li-Ion cell.

100%

I would suggest not even opening the box if you haven't received it yet.

You may have to take a hit on a restocking fee (I hope you don't!) but it is going to be worth it in the end. 

If you want to build a sick AT board, check out @Kaly's upcoming stuff. He has a new deck out that is meant for carving, and an awesome helical gear drive that comes with custom spec'ed motors.

There's tons of resources here, we love building, we want others to build. We get a bit frustrated when people bring up purchasing premade board, but not at the person buying them, but more at the state of the market. The promised specs and safety is never accurate, we see so many people reporting problem after problem that you get due to them trying to be cheap and save money on their production. That's all @mynamesmatt was trying to get across. 

Do yourself a favor, figure out what you want in a board, and start searching on this forum and seeing what can be done. Its not going to be a HUGE difference in money, it all depends on what you place value on. And thats the great part of DIY, you get to choose what features you want your board to have, then get the best quality for YOUR value on that type of part.

Good luck with all of this man, hope you can get out of your evolve purchase and build a true beast here with us.

Got to admit that I maybe thought that the manufacturers are better than they actually are.
Maybe it's really only all about keeping a good margin and since I can built a DIY board myself easily, I just cancelled the order officially.

They said they can still pull the board out of the shipment and I should get my PayPal payment back in a few days.

So let's talk Mountainboard now.

Focbox or Vesc?
Which drives are recommended for trampa boards (motor mounts) ?
Any personal remote control favorites?

ESC: Both are great. I have both, prefer the VESC6 but would not hesitate to use any of them.

Drives: For a mountain board only enclosed type. Either go with e-toxx or Trampas offerings (gear or enclosed belt)

Remote: Wait for Trampa's nrf remote then decide.

Enclosure: As much as I like the looks of underdeck enclosures for Trampa boards, only top mount for off road.

This 1000%, but if you're not fully off roading( getting serious air off of ramps/ crazy amounts of bottoming out and board flexing) a bottom mounted enclosure with 3 to 4 inches of undercarriage space should be perfectly fine if you're just doing flat forest paths

Also I might add that the battery goes about 10 meters in GT mode before being dead.  It goes about 7 kilometers in FAST mode before being dead.  I don't know how far it goes in ECO mode because I can't ride in ECO mode.

The Trampa motors are not very good so I would not get them. The Hobbyking SK8 6374 are almost a straight swap (you can get them from the Hobbyking European warehouse at 149 or 192kV). The Maytech sealed are more powerful but they have a short shaft so you have to ditch the protective cage and the mounting plate with the additional bearing to make them fit. Your choice.

Depending on what you prefer you can either get a gear drive (from Trampa or e-toxx) or the Trampa enclosed belt drive. I have the latter and I am happy with it. It is quiet, has quite a bit of ratio range (you can use 13, 14 or 15T gear pulleys) but it has a lot of drag albeit lots of it is from the sealing v-ring.

If you get the assembled board with the electric deck, you also get 2x VESC6, the battery box with all the wiring, bluetooth module, remote, CNCd electric hanger, travel bag etc. When I did the same exercise it came out cheaper than making it myself so I went for it.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-mountain-board-buy-or-build/72702

If you do not get the included charger they will knock 100GBP off the price.

I decided to make a LiIon 12S7P battery but you can choose to go with lipos again there are pros and cons with both choices.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/12s7p-battery-for-trampa-help-me-with-the-build/72900

So if I were to do it again I would get the Trampa complete with the gear drive (it also has shorter gear ratio which I find important on a mountainboard due to my terrain), sell the motors (you may not have to in your case, where I live it is very steep) and get a set of Hobbyking SK8 motors.

Trampa after sales service has been superb and their shipping times are ultra fast.

Thanks for the very detailed reply!

I tried to customize a electric deck. So with this setup I have everything except Battery and Charger right ?
Did you ever test this kind of remote ?

I have the Maytech thumb remote so no experience with that remote.
Get the 154kv motors, they will be easier to sell.
For your weight I would get the 16ply deck.
Ask to drill for both styles and setup as regular (in your case). That way if you ever decide to sell the board it can be setup either way.

They overheat easily and when setup with the amps I need to climb the hills around my house they would loose tracking.
The Hobbyking Sk8 149kv can take up to 55A motor amps before the stator is saturated and they start to lose tracking, the Maytech 6374 had no problems up to 70A. This is not immediately evident but if I climb a steep hill for a few minutes then they lose tracking and start studdering.

Ok I see..
So my best bet is I will only order the deck with wheels/trucks etc. and then source the rest over time.

Just fell in love with this setup..

![trampa630|690x317](upload://fQTXCsbDY78kG120aGp31PRBpzV.jpeg) 

So motor mounts will be quite hard to find in europe I guess.. I could 3D Print the pulleys for the wheels (with 66T ABS should easily hold up - even PLA might work).

How about APS Motors (i guess those are rebranded Maytech anyway) ?

So would be really thankful for Shops to find Motor mounts (and maybe wheel pulleys) in Europe.

So I will wait for the reply of Trampa Boards and then see how to proceed.
The motor mounts etc. without the motors are out of stock.
So the question remains if I should buy a complete set.

Otherwise I will have to source an enclosure, vesc, motor mounts, motors, pulleys, etc.

I could also try to draw a motor mount myself once I have the deck here and try to rent some hours on a CNC Milling machine.

Only time will tell :smiley:

Their customer service is subpar. Compared to boosted; they suck in this department.

Their board is no where waterproof or water anything. Get a dusting of water on there and you will fry your board.

I am shifting over to the world of DIY coming from a boosted OG. From a boxed board perspective, boosted is bar none the best service and quality product at any price point (opinions may vary). 

The evolve remote is terrible unless you

Good man.
I too came here to hate on evolve, and talk about how when you buy it, within 2 months the parts are worth half what you got them for. Additionally, the problems that come up only come up after its too late to return, and then you're stuck with this huge loss asset. With dickyho components, you can make a bamboo gtx with far more power and all its issues fixed for under 1.2k... You can make a very capable exteeme mountainboard for about $900 with graphene lipos too. You'll have a lot more fun on a diy than a shitty evolve, you just made a really good choice cancelling that :+1:

I've never had remote issues either, but I did have a few cut-outs that I diagnosed as the power button rattling-loose.  If you push it on forcefully and in one fluid motion, it seems to not come open.  I believe that might be the "remote cut-out" that folks talk about.  So the remote connection seems very solid.

The battery is a big smelly turd, and the remote has no "PPM" (PWM) output, so that makes it shitty, but I haven't had cut-outs.

I still use the Carbon GT whenever I need to go 50 meters or less.  :smirk: ;-P

I am not sure I agree with you there.

Maintenance in the case of gears is probably even less than belts.

That said when a gear does wear out though it will be more expensive to replace compared to a belt but I would expect gears to last 5-10 times more than a belt.

This just isnt right sorry, gear drives should theoretically last indefinitely if they're properly constructed and maintained. ( No vendor here has released a total lifetime distance on the drives, maybe they know, maybe they last forever 🤷🤷) 

Belts will *DEEP BREATH* *"stretch"* and unless you have a tensioning system, will require semi frequent( depends on how hard you ride, temperatures, road conditions, etc) changing. I've seen people get 5 miles out of a belt, and others get hundreds of miles(how???)

One is a larger upfront cost, but if you'll ride that board for a few years, it might be worth it for it's 'ease of maintenance', versus cost savings

Not to mention I feel much safer with a gear drive... It just seems more bulletproof 🤷

So you would recommend an e-toxx in this case ?

hows that one ?

One quick question.

I want to build a battery pack with Samsung 30Q - 12S4P or 12S3P.
How much range could I estimate for each with a dual drive 6374 and 8 inch wheels ?
Of course with some offroad action and uphill/downhill in the mix.

Thanks

Man, I want to help you but you are beginning to tire me out. You have to do a little more research.
12S4P with 30Q cells will not be sufficient for a mountainboard. It is not just a problem of range. These things are big, heavy and have a lot of drag due to the tires etc.

You need at least a 12S6P to not have too much voltage sag.

I am not mad. I am just saying it is in your best interest to do more research.

It will help you end up with a board more suitable to your needs.

Let me put it another way, you ask, I answer and you rely on my answers and a couple of other guys to configure your board.
But this weekend all the experienced guys are away on holiday and you are stuck with an idiot like me giving you false information because I do not know any better.

If you do your own research you have a better chance of distinguishing the good from the bad info.

I just found many other builds ranging from 12S4P up to 10S12P and I don't care much about range.
Considering 20A per parallel pair - 4 of them can discharge 80A would be 40A per VESC. In my opinion that should be enough for 2x 6374's and I don't care much for range.. If I can get 10km I am good.

Also seen your 12S7P build.. however you didn't mention any range - at least I couldn't find it

You will definitely get at least 10km with a 12S4P, I would expect closer to 20km depending on how and where you ride your board. However I believe you will have too much voltage sag.

I get approx. 40km with my 12S7P but this can get a lot less when going off road aggressively.

I mean upgrading is pretty easy so I will start off with 12S4P and see how it feels.. Worst case I buy another 3-4P.

Printing out a "holder" for the 12S4P. Will print 3 of those.. top - mid - bottom. Should absorb shocks quite nicely and then seal them with a lid on the top and bottom

So I was just thinking about my motor choice..

I still have a Maytech 6374 Motor (170 KV) so I would just have to buy another one to complete the set.
But I think 170KV might be too high for my 12S Setup.
I was also looking at APS Motors - those are not enclosed for the most part so the sensor PCB might be problematic for muddy/rainy terrain.
Most other suppliers that I checked are out of stock on certain motors.

Whats your thoughts ?
I think the motors should have around 130KV (or would you use 170KV and just compensate with gearing) ?

Would you use APS Motors - or can you recommend others that are on stock in Europe ?

Some People say they prefer sensorless because they are less likely to fail (I want to use them with a FOCBOX) - what's your experience ?


Maybe I am also lucky and some motors pop up in the used items market.
Thanks again guys
have a great day

The Maytech 6374 work perfectly for a MTB, you just have to gear accordingly.
I had tried them with 13/66 gearing and they were fine. I might have wanted a little shorter gearing but I would be happy with that too. Keep in mind that I like very short gearing on an MTB since I live in a very steep area that gets really hot during the summer.

APS motors have a lot of problems. Do a search and you will find plenty. Stick with Maytech or Hobbyking SK8.

Sensorless does not work for MTB since you can't push start. An exception to that would be the use of an external encoder such as AS5047.

I have those exact motors bought from eskating.eu

I am not sure that the 190kv is accurate though, they are closer to 170kv.

I can't measure the kv with the vesc terminal KV command since I run FOC, but I can tell you what erpm they reach at what V and you or someone else can figure it out.

The Unity has been rated for higher discharge, for longer amounts of time when compared to the single focbox, but the temperature aspect sort of becomes irrelevant when you strap a heatsink to it.

Ive heard of people doing 80a batt max on a single focbox(I think this was Kug3lis ?) But I would stick around 40a unless you have some good cooling
```

## \#213 Posted by: RyuX Posted at: 2019-03-18T12:09:54.335Z Reads: 52

So I should wait until the unity is available in Europe ?
Then I will only order the motors and the direct drive and hope for the focbox unity to be available to EUROPEAN Suppliers as well

It says shipping "after march"
