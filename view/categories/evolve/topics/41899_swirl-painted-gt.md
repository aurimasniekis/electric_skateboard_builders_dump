Swirl Paint. Cheap and easy. I think it looks pretty cool. Painted my GT about a year ago.

Cool. How did you get the paint? It was made by you?

Type borax paint swirl into google and you will find a bunch of write ups. Picking the paint is key. I used testors enamel paint. It comes in tiny jars for painting model cars, etc, from art stores for about a dollar a bottle. The paint you put into the water first is is usually the less dominant color (black here). However, each color behaves differently so youâ€™ll want to do a practice run.  Then just top it with a few layers of clear coat.
