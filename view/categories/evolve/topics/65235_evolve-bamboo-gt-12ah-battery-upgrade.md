This is a small thread on the battery build I've done for my Bamboo GT.
I have seen a few different approaches to 18650 battery upgrades and didn't like the BMS being placed on top of the VESC for a number of reasons. Heat build and thickness increase.
I've been playing with 3D printing and CAD design so came up with an extension piece that doesn't require plastic welding or fibre glassing. The extra length of the battery when going to a 10S4P  only equated to an extra 5mm if you take the slope out of the cover and give it a more vertical design. I have cut off just inside the last two screw holes so that it will anchor to the board and also added a lip to the edge so it pulled the cover down onto the deck. Anyway a picture is a thousand words they say.
![Evolve%20Bamboo%20Series%20Skateboard%20battery%20cover%20extension|690x388](upload://lRkS37GG2JaB2mad3HxWbMtW6u4.jpg)
There's another cover piece at the top left of the picture as I printed several.
The second phase is a silicone gasket to give the cover an extra few mm clearance due to the thicker battery. I have done the CAD work for a mould and will make a gasket soon.
I built the battery myself as I have been building battery packs for some time now for telemetry equipment, ROV's and a few custom skateboard builds.
I opted for HG2's for the high capacity 3Ah and the high discharge current of 20 Amps per cell.
So my pack is 12Ah and capable of 80 Amp continuous. They are slightly more expensive than the 30Q's but don't have as much voltage sag under heavy load.
This is the battery fitted, nice and snug.
![Evolve%20Bamboo%20battery%20upgrade%20install|690x388](upload://lNbdEBY4dobUddrYryC0g2nueHy.jpg)
I sourced an 11 way JST plug that although is not the original Evolve one it fits nicely as you can see. I have also fitted the power leads with 4mm gold plated Supra X bullet connectors so that the battery unplugs in seconds, no soldering required. Well just the first time when I fitted the bullet connectors to the BMS. I can now build a second battery for extended rides, just need my deck allen key and I can change on the road.
![Bullet%20connectors|666x500](upload://7G69gu7ipbbEjc5aZWAqkhZS7HK.jpg)
I've only tried a few runs with the new battery to test it out. Once I have the new gasket fitted then I can go for a test run for distance. Got a few good hills by me so will be testing it out on those too.

New stuff added 19/8/18

Some info about my battery and it's build. As I said I have used LG Chem HG2's for this battery but I have used the Samsung 25R's. I built a 10S3P to start with from 25R's. When I fitted it to the board it looked kind of lost in there as there was some much extra space. So I built a 10S4P with HG2's. I'm spoilt with choice as I import and sell these cells to vape guys near me so I have lots of 25R's, 30Q's and HG2's.![20180814_105658%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://67hGC9ELGgnMZPTqcDl6RAfIszq.jpg)
This is the 10S3P with 25R's just before shrink wrap.
Well I built the 10S4P and it didn't fit so hence the extension piece and soon to be gasket.
The pack was going to be a tight fit width wise so I have used flat braided copper wire for the interconnections., low profile and flexible.These I solder on first then weld them on to the first Nickel strip so no soldering is done onto the cells. This also gives an extra layer of Nickel for increase current capability. I use 0.2mm x 10mm Nickel and my welder is a 15KVA beast so welds are good and strong.
![20180715_180323%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://gEB73yAOBKRzej6X9yc1qfuSuvC.jpg)
This shot shows the welder and HG2's in a jig I made with the 3D printer to keep everything nice and straight. The pre soldered braided connectors just to the left. A couple of spare extension cover pieces on the right I made incase of cockups.
Everything conductive gets Kapton taped and then wrapped in reinforced clear duct tape, then shrink wrapped. This battery got 12AWG silicone power leads even though the Evolve battery uses 14AWG, I had the space to work with so decided on the higher current capability of the 12AWG. The braided wire is 6mm2 which according to RS components rated to 60A continuous so should be fine for such a small length (50mm). 
I soldered the leads directly to the BMS to start with then decided to change to bullet connectors. Soldering to the board needs a big soldering iron and a lot of heat. I am planning on trying a few different batteries so the bullet connectors is a simple solution. They are used for the motors on some boards so why not the BMS?
I picked up a 4A charger from my battery supplier as the original Evolve one is only 2A. I also have a West Mountain Battery tester so the battery got fully tested before the first test run.![20180802_155745%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://7QCy8t1qPmhwbBTKn0Npx6W1kOB.jpg)
This shot shows the battery in place, cover extension, 4A charger and the West Mountain tester in the top right corner. I use a gas soldering iron as they get hotter than electric ones. You have to be careful of the exhaust port on the side of the tip, had a few close calls forgetting about that.
New AT wheels fitted, almost ready to hit the road (well dirt tracks here in the Australian bush) Just the gasket to make and fit.

No, didn't want to route the board as it flexes enough with my weight so I've designed a mould that I'll print out on my 3D printer and make a 3mm gasket in silicone. I've seen a few done in plastic straight from the printer but I thought silcone would work better, flexible and a good seal. Will make it next weekend and post some pictures.

nice one! I like the extension, is that something you can make to sell?

I've had less than ideal experiences with 3d printed risers. ended up going with neoprene foam, which worked well but I think silicone would be neat!

Thanks. Yes I was going to look at selling them. I've already made several just in case I messed it up when fitting the captive screws or sanding them down.
I like the silicone approach as casting is easier than printing.

How much range would you get on a 10s3p?

Hi Yanzo,
The Bamboo GTX has a 10Ah battery and gives a range of 50Km with street wheels and 30km with all terrain so a 10S3P with Samsung 30Q's and 9Ah would be about 10% less than that. The 10S3P 7.5Ah is only 1Ah more than the stock Bamboo battery of 6.5Ah so a slight improvement of stock performance can be expected, you should also see less voltage drop as the cells are high performance cells.

![Screenshot_20180926-091828_Sports%20Tracker|243x500](upload://5Rw7imf62RtpVaz3oMAu6yF9sQ0.jpeg) 

Had a 10s4p 30q pack done. 13km into the ride we drag race up a hill in gt mode. The gtx with the 30q pack (70kg rider) dropped to 72% the standard gtx (80kg rider) dropped to 14%.

In total we did a 23km run. The end is where it gets interesting. The 30q had 0% for the last 5 km where the standard battery had 30%. The last 3km the 30q was showing 0% while stationary. The last 1km the standard battery was in fast mode. My mate didn't let off the trigger to prevent the eco drop and was able to hit 30kmh. We were switching boards every few kilometres too.

```
The Evolve battery is custom made using LiPo cell so will have the stated capacity, unfortunately there are a lot of fake 30Q's or even old stock and B grade 30Q's on the market so unless the battery pack was tested for capacity once built there is no guarantee it is a 12Ah pack. The 30Q's showed that they are better performing on hills with far less voltage drop but it seems the capacity is not what it should be in this case. Interesting input though.

No not that easy. You need a watt meter. That basically measures the voltage and current and displays it in watts, some will show Ah too. You then either fully discharge from full or fully charge from flat. You can buy battery capacity testers or make one with a watt/capacity meter.

Hi Yanzo,
What app is that your using?
Going to be building a 30Q 15Ah battery for the Carbon Gt soon so will test the distance. I'll measure the true capacity of the battery before the ride and see what happens.

Haha, I was just thinking I hadn't put that on here just this morning. I have made one that works well but I'm not happy with the mould so need to modify it slightly. It was fiddly getting the gasket out around the holes so I need to make the gasket a bit wider near the holes. The silcone I used was a self leveling type with seems fine other than it takes 3 days to fully cure and was easy to damage trying to remove before full cure because of the small sections around the screw holes. Got a picture of the gasket will take one of the gasket fitted when I get my board back. My son has it for a couple of weeks.![20180926_125310%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://lrbV6qtAhrXoA7luT8eW2ogcz0U.jpeg) 
Made it in grey, will make some black next with the modified mould.

It's the shape of the cover so hard to change how it looks. It's been extended by 5mm to suit my extended cover. Looks like a rocker cover to me. I wonder if there's a car out there with a gasket that would fit, save me some time :smile:

Are you building the battery yourself? I have had the BMS plugs made with 600mm of leads already fitted with a red and black wire on for correct polarity if you need one. I'll be selling them on my website soon. Also have all the other bits like braided wire and silcon wire etc to build a battery pack.

Hey @Marsen Love seeing what you are doing.

I have just bought a BGTX and am probably going to be doing the battery upgrade next year when it's 12 months old. Also love that you are Australian based. Just out of curiosity how are you going with making the new enclosures? Also what are the chances of building batteries that are "Airline compatible" so that we can take them on flights. I know that the range will be reduced but it will give people a travel option.

Cheers

The enclosures are progressing( slowly) I have been building a large CNC router (1500mm x 900mm) which is about 80% completed. I hope to start carving out enclosures soon, still working on the CAD design work, not very fast or good with that at the moment as I am still learning. I also have the vacuum forming machine to finish as I am looking at an enclosure that is made with a combination of the two machines. I have also been looking at flight compatible enclosures too.

Hey Marsen,

I recently bought a GTX and i actually quite like it, got a great deal too.. I'm thinking about buying a better battery, the one i have does serve it purpose but I'm greedy and want to go further, faster, more often... I mainly commute and dont really go off road.

What battery do i want? well i would like to go 30kms on my AT wheels and at fast pace, i also want the battery to last the test of time..

any suggestions?

Many thanks in advanve.

Dave.

Hi Dave, the problem with the Bamboo boards is they can only fit a 12Ah 10S4P  if you want to keep the original look as much as possible. I have sold a couple of 10S8P batteries to Bamboo owners but they have had to fit a 15mm spacer to get it to fit. They had GTX boards so the board was also routed out. GT boards would need a 20mm spacer to fit the doubled up battery. I am working on a range of enclosures to suit the Evolve Bamboo boards so that you can fit a 15Ah battery in quite easily. It is a few months away from design, prototype then production. I think the 15Ah 10S5P is a great choice for Evolve boards as it gives the board the ability to perform as it should and not too heavy or bulky. I can offer you a 10S4P as an easy fit, you will still need a spacer or rout the board where the ESC sits. The Samsung cells are a great choice for esk8 and you will get many more recharges than the stock one.
```

Ok so i guess firstly i can wait if its worth the wait...
It sounds like the 12Ah 10S4P is not much better than the original apart from the reduced sag.
15mm is probs a bit much... i would guess the 10S8P perform above and beyond expectations tho.
Could you hazard a guess at the performance of a 15Ah 10S5P? If its worth the wait then it sounds like that is the go...
Now as for the 15Ah 10S5P what is the issue? It it too long, wide or deep? Would i need a new BMS or VESC/remote? 
Sorry for all the questions..

Hi Dave, sorry been busy at work then flying home. The 15Ah battery is my favourity, plenty of power no voltage sag and easy to make :smile:
It is however too long for the Bamboo board enclosure. Which is why I have designed a replacement enclosure. It also gives you a finish product rather than your old enclosure and a spacer.
The BMS and ESC work fine with this battery as it uses the same voltage and configuration. I have a guide I have written with lots of pictures showing what's involved. I can send you this in an email if you like.

Hello @Marsen , thank you very much for the piece you sent me in STL for the evolve Bamboo. I already have everything assembled and the enclousure cuted, but when I tried to close it with the piece that you sent me I see that it is short for me. My BMS must be too big and I still need 1.5cm of extra space.

Do you have another version of the piece with the same position of the bolts but with the far end leaving a little more space?

I've been trying to modify the version you sent me (tinkercad and meshmixer)  but I'm not capable.

Thank you!

Hello! The problem is that I do not have evolve electronics, but a unity and a fairly large bms, in this photo you can see the modified Enclosure and still missing site and the bms mounted on top of the vesc.![IMG-20190404-WA0014|282x500](upload://vFPtln7CfgT31DbRKtGKKsEf8Tp.jpeg)

Maybe just use a smaller bms. I have a bamboo gt with original enclosure running a high discharge 80A BMS with dual Focbox. I added some foam between the deck and enclosure so the BMS can go on top off the focbox

Thanks @pjotr47, yes, my bms is too big ... I have already sent to print the longest piece, as soon as it arrives, if all goes well, I will finally upload my skate to the sk8 builds section

I have designed a spacer for the heatsink so you can double up the bms and vesc. Similar to the one I did for the CGT but with groves to fit over the heatsink shape of the Bamboo board. I haven't tried it on the 3D printer yet so will most likely need tweaking. I'll post it on here once I have it finished.

Hey Mark, I am loving your post! 
I am across the ditch in NZ and am in the progress to upgrade my BGT too...
Your extension enclosure was exactly what I was looking for, is there any chance you would be able to email me the STL file too please?
(I cant find the PM message button for the life of me too.... ehhh)

Thanks so much dude!

I have designed a new spacer for the Bamboo boards. It fits under the heatsink and provides the space needed for the ESC/BMS. This way you don't need to cut the end off the enclosure. I also have jst plugs and cables for the BMS. ![20190423_135439|690x326](upload://xWdJC0WUCSQWfs44nTA7Ozz9oYK.jpeg) 
![BMS%20cable|690x460](upload://m2PxSYCf12CT54qUnbqQ6fTVwIg.jpeg) 
This is the cable and plug fitted to a battery by Jaydawg56
I also have good quality copper braid for the interconnections. 
The spacer has slots for the fins and extends down into the enclosure to create a seal. Only $25 and includes the longer screws. JST plug and 600mm cables $12. Copper braid $4 mtr.

that looks fantastic! Where and how would I order this from you?
I haven't actually taken my BGT apart yet but im guessing the BMS sits where the extention is?

Hey @Marsen 

How are you going on the custom GTX enclosures? I'm hoping to buy a new battery off you soon.

I'm not to sure what my options are with what you make. Does your 10S4PGA fit in the stock enclosure?

I've made a  prototype and will be making a few changes for better fit. Hope to start making them in a few weeks all going well.
![Marsen%20Bamboo|690x271](upload://chGoDNFa6AYOjrf9w4Iyn6e0xt5.jpeg) 
This one is the extra size which will fit a 15Ah 10S5P.

The cells lines up the same way as we do 18650s? I can‚Äôt imagine 10 more cells length-wise and still fit under a GTX length deck

@Marsen I can't wait to see the final product. I did a 16.5km run last night and got back home just on the stock battery. What sort of $$$ are you looking at for the new enclosure?
