with a deadman switch (if you dont like it, you can turn it off)

2 separated triggers for accelerating and breaking

2.4 wireless connection

you can see the controller battery level on the screen, i think you can't do it in the old remote

Cruise and Nitro modes - really?

The separate brake and acceleration triggers is an interesting idea, must try one out to see how it feels. Being able to switch off the dead man switch is a cool touch too.

Any idea of this remote be compatible for us DIY pepz? Compatible with our receivers?

Why exact feelings, haha. This is one reason that I'm looking at colored filament for remotes also. Shape and color can't look like a gun or someone will get shot at some point, just a matter of time.

I find it looks like they put a lot of thinking and engineering in it, but separate acceleration and braking? That must be uncomfortable and silly. I even would say it is dangerous,, I don't know any controllers where the opposite direction of a motion is put on separated places.

That thing looks interesting but stupid.

I hate to say it, but I think it's a matter of time, with how trigger happy some police in the US are.

On the remote design though, thoughts on seperate brakes and acceleration? Seems like it would feel un-natural to to most people who already ride eskates. Wounder if you can hit both throttle and brake at the same time or not.

Does this actually fix their remote disconnection issue? I mean was that the remote or the receiver's issue?

Having a separate button for throttle and brakes seems like a step backwards. What they had was fine and the dead man switch solves the accidental throttle problem

I'm a die hard DIY'er so not a fan boy of any company. 

I guess it depends on how the triggers are setup and if you can fine tune the curves to your liking. I can imagine it allowing for a precise and faster reaction. Just like a clutch in a manual car. 

But i'm just speculating and don't have much experience with esk8. Only regular sk8's and manual rwd cars! :sunglasses:

people are going to intuitively mash both at the same time. I'm glad they thought of that by making the brake override the gas. Ebventually that safety will malfunction.

[/quote]

That is already an issue though. Your instinct reaction when falling is to reach forward and let go. When bracing for inpact, it's the exact opposite. Clenching fists. With a trigger style remote braking is the most unnatural and counter intuitive motion when faced with a dangerous scenario. 

This remote kind of fixes the latter by having the second trigger override the first. If you clench your fist in fear and mash buttons, the board will brake and not accelerate, where as right now you would actually accelerate full on with a trigger remote 

I have never used a thumb remote but have a few coming so that might be better instinctively.

Nevertheless, cost per cost i would say that the Photon remote seems more promising for us DIY'ers due to amount of customization that can be done.

I know
The best remote would be this
Finger Trigger
GT2B how it doesnâ€™t have drop outs
Small
Screen
Sensor so when you let go of the trigger it just cruises at the same speed
Some weird sensor so that if you fall the board automatically stops
Programmable dead man switch
3 modes
The screen led you change Vesc setting, see speed in that run, see top speed in that run, and show a trail that you did
Perfect remote

I'm almost 100 percent certain its not the receiver its the remote. I have had two remotes work perfectly on my ESC never 1 connection drop. Fast forward a few months and my charging port fell off, after the warranty replacement remote arrived: connection issues out the wazoo.

once you use one you'll realize that the problem of unintuitive finger pointing braking has been solved since the first wii nunchuck was paired with a vesc. 

Its really the only format that makes total sense. Acceleration is a thumb forward, which isn't the clench state. The relaxed state is no throttle at all and braking is much closer to a clench.

I've used a GT2B and I honestly had no complaints, and the @MasterCho mod I used on it was great....BUT...no complaints is different then really liking something.   My Benchwheel and Maytech Steez v2 remotes are a lot more comfortable and just feel natural.  

I like the Nano-X alot too, its just a bit too small for my hand when wearing gloves.  But I put some double stick velcro on the remote and my glove, that problem was solved.  Unfortunately I busted up my RX when rebuilding a board awhile back, need to check with @onloop and see if I can buy just the receiver.

Also, I'm bad about hitting the breaks too hard with trigger remotes.  That's not an issue with thumb remotes.

I bought one for science, and it did not work. I have a winning nano V2 w/o a reciever that connects to R1 nano reciever.

That rubber better be part of a two component molding, otherwise its going to tear down fast. 

When watching the video, I was thinking yakes! That really do look like a gun!

And they should have used their 3D model for showing of the functions, the actual physical remote they used was no sight for my sore product designer eyes.

Yeah the more remotes look like guns in the dark at night, the more likely I will get shot.  And if that happens, the cops will get off with no consequences because there's a real gun on me too that they will find and say that was the one in my hand.

It's terrible that I'm more worried about cops than thugs.

Just got my remote. Itâ€™s alright, I can barely push the beak curve and my hands arenâ€™t small. Itâ€™s a pretty deep trigger. 

My remote wonâ€™t shut off when the board is on. The secondly, it wonâ€™t chnage modes unless I turn it on then off about 5 times. Maybe I got a bad remote 

Can. Anyone attest on the remote?

I actually already have mine and am very impressed with the throttle control. 100x better. But.... I have pretty big hands and for anyone with regular sized hands it might be to big. My GF couldnâ€™t even use it because it was huge. Iâ€™ll take a pic when I get home but itâ€™s a pretty big remote in general. The throttle curve on GT isnâ€™t even close to the old remote. I am having problems switching modes from eco to fast then to Gt. Never had problems going down but going up required me to turn everyotbibh on and off a few times. Typed this quick so bare with the grammar errors
