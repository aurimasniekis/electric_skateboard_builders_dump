So my Evolve bamboo series came today.....

Little disappointed to be honest, don't get me wrong the build quality and finish are fantastic as are the looks however torque and hill climb ability is pretty awful! I would say on par with the yuneec ego which I also have. After talking with the guys at evolve they told me hill climb ability would definitely be better than the ego but it's really not!. Don't get me wrong it rides beautifully on flat ground or on slight inclines and that motor is totally silent and I mean silent it's amazing even when braking. I'm just wondering if it possible to gear it down slightly to allow bit better torque and lose a bit of top end. Any suggestions? 

Still in the process of building another one so could always use that one as a hill climber I suppose.

Well it is a single motor, not very powerful from what I've heard.. They really are meant for range more than they are for hills. Depending on the hill grades your climbing you should sell your bamboo and invest fully in a DIY build with a nice dual motor set up.

Of course if you have the money to throw, could always invest in the GT..but honestly if you're patient enough I think DIY would be the better option for your money -- I just have no patience to wait for parts/tinker with stuff all summer lol

I'd go ahead and sell. Prices are dropping for a lot of secondhand gen 1 boards (boosted/evolve). I'd say go DIY if you can spend $1000-1500 -- you could get a good super powerful dual motor set up for that. Get a GT (when back in stock) if you can spare 2k -- assuming you're in the US (because thats the price for us). Or if completes are your focus get a used Boosted dual+ for about a grand.

I had both and E-GO and an Evolve for awhile. I found the torque to be substantially better on the Evolve than the E-GO. There were a lot of ramps and uphill gradients that my E-GO struggles on that the Evolve did without even breaking a sweat. It was no dual motor board, but mine was clearly better than the E-GO. I would check to make sure you're getting enough power to the motor and that everything is working properly. That sounds odd.

I'm sure the electronics are programmed to keep it civil... notnsure what size wheel you have ... If you have 83mm I don't know if you could go smaller .... If ur 90mm and above ... Moving to an 83mm will help you ....as well as changing the tpulleys if that's an option ....

I believe fhe carbon had the better battery snd thus a little more power to go up hills. The bamboo range is the base model of the ecvolves. Now also beng single motor less torque again

I hear this a lot about commercial options. 

if you want to climb hills as if they aren't even there you need a dual drive 10S or 12S with fat 63mm motors at a lower KV like 190 or below. 

i happen to be building two of those right now.

From what I've been experiencing of the boosted and evolve boards out there so far I'd say yes that they are way slow and weak.  I invite anyone with a boosted or an evolve to race me on any flat or hill and film it.   It's a blowout.  I'm on the top of the hill before evolve is half way.  Boosted is a bit better.  On a flat it's the same.  The peak power of what I have is obviously way more.  the weakness with the hubmotors, at least at full speed non-stop, is they will get too hot after too much.  Maybe..maybe they therefore have better continuous power but if I were to diddle around on the way up the hill going as fast as they do it...I doubt I'd have any heating issues.  A worthwhile test I'm too bored to try. Going slowly just doesn't happen and I hit every hill at full throttle. I'm sure they do too.
Maybe it's the limitations that are built into those boards. Maybe an amp limit. Probably.

Have 80mm at the mo and I thought about going smaller but ground clearance is already really low especially when going up and down pavements so think smaller wheels will be even worse.

Nothing wrong with power and yes if you get a run up at a hill it manages better than the ego but bottom end I don't think there is much difference at all.

Yeh spoke to the guys at evolve before I purchased and they said there really isn't much in difference for Hill climbs just range that's why I didn't bother with carbon. And the price! Lol

Buying the commercial boards is like going to the car dealer and taking the family wagon because they hold your hand while you fill it up instead of the race car for half the price.  At least the raptor has some power.

Is this really a legit comparison though:

Are the motor pulleys the same
Are the amp limits and timing set the same 

And then what happened after getting to 5mph...how about 25.

They sure do!
Enertion Raptor has incredibly high quality dual motors as well as a single motor version.

I wish I had the chance to afford one, let alone use one it would change my life and open up so much happiness and thrill! Top quality product and the best on the market for years to come if not the Raptor, then the brand Enertion. Jason (lucky enough to share the dudes name) is an absolute powerhouse genius and cant wait to see him start creating off-road electric boards like his original dreams before the Raptor came about.

Happy days!
Jason

Hey! I'm in the pan handle of Florida close to Panama City Beach. Can you recommend a route to go to building my own or can you tell me what you would build and what it would sell for? I'm kind of digging the Trampa Urban Carvers just for the versatility. Thoughts?

hey hornet90....thanks for your suggestion....i looked up a couple of videos online for metro board...they seemed like pretty good board with brake control...but they covered only board wen they brake....i wanted to see how they were standing..so that i can learn the posture too......do you have aany good video links to demo the brakes?

N00b here. I don't own a soldiering iron and cant build anything. So props to all of you folks.

What I have found:
1. Evolve Bamboo GT
2. Boosted Dual w/ext range Batt
3. Blink S2

Thoughts?

I like the Evolve for the performance, range, looks, and price. Its still a little less than the Boosted when adding the bigger battery.

Question: is having two motors really better than one? (Look at the performance of the new Evolve ONE board)

Does anyone know if the Blink S2 is airline compliant? (the "S" is) I know both the Boosted and Evolve are simply not due to the Watt Hours. Is Blink any good or more of a "toy"?

General thoughts and advice please and thank you.

You're on a DIY board so.....
Soldering irons are cheap and building a board is not that difficult. Especially if you have the budget for an Evolve. Hubs are the easiest since they generally come in a complete package with wheels and trucks. Just mount them to your board and solder 3 wires to your VESC. Connect the VESC to a pre-built battery pack+bms+enclosure like Enertion's Space Cell 3, connect the remote receiver, then screw the enclosure onto your deck of choice. You'll just need a few extras like Velcro and some shrink tube to make everything pretty. It will help cover up your messy solder connections. 

If you want a pre-built board you can fly with, Boosted is the way to go with their travel friendly batt. When choosing a board, it may be helpful to try it out before hand. Each one has it's own advantages and disadvantages.

didnt  get a blast on bamboo yet but my Metroboard came in i also have a diy board,standing on the metroboard feels great and dont worry about breaks there great i can stop when ever i need to it feels so safe the metroboard feels so well built cant go any where people are stopping me ill do a few more miles this week end if u want to know any thing let me know and by the way customer service
from metroboard is so good i think there on 24/7.

thanks for following up hornet90. i have been so tempted to buy metroboard..but i have made investment on airwheel last week...been fighting with it for last 3 days...making progress one step after another. once i get a hang of it and i feel saturated i will think about metroboard again...but if you have a youtube video...please feel free to hit me up with link..i would love to see it.
