I installed a new style brake lights.
It reacts according to the signal of the remote control.
You can see that it works in my YouTube video below.

It receives electricity from the vesc and receives a signal from the receiver.

This is exactly what I had in mind to research.
Do you mind sharing the arduino code and setup?

I mean I have found some on ebay made for bikes. They are called "smart" automatic brake lights. Maybe they could be retrofitted into a 3d printed cover like he has and all I know is they have to be mounted vertically to work.

Not only are the lights super cool, but I really dig the black and gold color scheme. Reminds me of the old JPS Lotus F1 cars.
