Hello everyone!

So I just bought this moose drop down deck ( http://a.co/gsnvqNN , side view here http://a.co/9SloA2H ), which is very similar to Landyachtz Evo, because I want to deck swap my wowgo 2 board (similar to meepo). 

Since the drop is very aggresive and there is not enough clearance, I want to mount my enclosures on top of the deck, right between the legs, just like some of the mountain board builds. Building a flat battery/buying a new one is out of the question because I'm working on a budget. Using riser pads would be a shame and would defeat the purpose of this deck. In order to do this swap, I have a few options regarding my enclosures:

_1) use the stock enclosures_, mount the battery between the legs and mount the esc as a kicktail (extend the tail with a wide piece of wood and mount the esc case above it)

_2) build a custom Kydex enclosure_ that is compact and fits both the battery and esc, but this is the hardest option & trying to avoid it because it's a very tedious process.

_3) put them both in a waterproof box like this_ 
a) https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DXLDMFR/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_VkBuBbKMJCX6K
or this
b) https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B005F7Y1TO/ref=s9_dcacsd_dcoop_bw_c_x_1_w

Option 3b is my favorite one, but the problem is that I am in USA and amazon only has bad quality boxes here (unless you know where I can get something similar to what is in the links). The battery's dimensions are 160x105x45mm and the ESC's are 104x80x17mm. I can either mount them one on top of the other, each being secured to a different wall of the box so that there is space between them, battery on ceiling of box secured with industrial strength velcro, esc on the bottom because motor wires are short (will also put foam between esc and battery), or just mount them side by side and find a longer box. I am shooting for a box that is as compact as possible in order to have maximum footspace possible (that's why 3b is the best option). 

What are your opinions about these solutions and do you have any advice?
Do you guys think that the flex of the deck is dangerous for mounting something in the middle of it? It might put too much pressure on the screws that secure the enclosure.
Any idea where I can find enclosures similar to the ones from those links, but in USA?
Can you think of any problems that might occur from having them in the same box aka overheating? 
Another option would be similar to 3, but a box that also fits the charger and skate tool. That would be an all in one solution and eliminate the need for a backpack on long rides. 

If you made it through to the end, sorry for the long post,.
P.S.: My account is new but I have spent many hours here before creating it.

Hey man, imo @Eboosted makes the slickest enclosures around.

I've seen his work. Looks really good indeed, but I'm working on a budget and I'd rather do it myself with kydex as a last resort.
Now I notice the motor wires are not long enough to reach the center of the deck. that would mean I have to mount the esc on the tail or extend the motor wires somehow (too much work with soldering, cutting cables etc.). I can as well make a very slim enclosure for the esc and mount it under the deck, but that would ruin my plans for a water resistant board. Any other ideas?

Deck arrived. Looks way better than I expected. Will probably put a decal on the bottom and clear grip on top to have that beautiful bamboo exposed. Very comfortable after trying it a couple of miles on skate trucks with 59mm wheels. Can't imagine how it will be on 90mm wheels with good shock pads (however they are hubs with harder durometer). Plenty of space on the deck so I will mount the battery between the legs after all. Still thinking about ESC placement

That is very pretty.  Deserves some serious aesthetics.

It's very similar to landyachtz evo, but narrower and different angle at the tail. 
I can't think of any way of mounting my components without making it look ugly. The motor wires are too short to reach the center of the board where I plan on putting the ESC and battery. I can route the ESC cables outside the enclosure, but then it will be a mess and all the connections would be outside the board. cutting into the deck would work, but hiding the connections there would mean cutting a pretty significant space which could affect the structural rigidity of the board. 
I want to mount the electronic above the deck and between the legs. Maybe soldering some extensions for the cables? any ideas?

I think you should try to keep it simple.  Just do the deck swap.  The point of that type of deck is the angled truck mounts.  Gives much better stability at speed.  The height on the risers won't affect that just the angle of them.  The evo was designed for 35' trucks (randall) and it looks like that one is set up for 50'
So straight risers will be fine to give you the clearance for the wowgo enclosures.  It will still be more stable than the stock deck.  I personally don't like top mount stuff especially on something that pretty. The only drawback with using the existing enclosures is the battery leads because you wouldn't want to route them into the top like the meepo/wowgo so I would just surface mount underneath and use some cable protection.  Keep the top sweet.  Thats what i'd do but its entirely up to you of course.  Good luck with it and update when you can.

Looks similar to those 1166 Longboards....
