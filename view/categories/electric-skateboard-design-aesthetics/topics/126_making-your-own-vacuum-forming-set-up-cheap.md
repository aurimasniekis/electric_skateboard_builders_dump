This has been an off again/on again project for almost 6 months. It took me awhile to find the right oven. (One that would really tie the room together ya' know?) Then as luck would have it, I would have no way to hook it up in my shop without installing a new electrical box too...

So I ditched the 220v idea all together and pulled out the bottom element. Then I replaced it with a 110v Smoker Element that I had on hand.

I also had a converter/inverter that I could use as the switch for the smoker element.

It works! definitely gets hot enough to heat the ABS to a proper temp.

The table is really just a 1" hole drilled through my work bench with a shop vac stuffed underneath. I used some door seal molding to shape the seal around the top.

You can use almost anything as your mold as long as it doesn't have a melting point of 220-300 degrees. I use wood, laminated to the thickness I need  and then cut and sanded to the shape I want. Sometimes I can just add a piece to the mold if I'm adding a component. *I used a few flat head screws in the bottom of my mold to barely lift it up off of the table. This really helps get a good suction on your ABS.

I used 5/16" screen frames cut to oven size and then clamped together over the abs sheet.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/d0f3fc291f9259473ca3fd51cdcb80f49ba86eac.jpg" width="690" height="390"> 

The process is simple if you keep things in order and time it the same way every time. Pre-heat your oven, place your screened abs in the oven and wait for it to sag. It'll sag a few inches below the screen frames when it's ready to form. I left an oven rack below it just to make sure the sagging abs couldn't hit the hot element. 

In this order, Turn on your vaccum, open your oven, pull the abs sheet, place it on the vac table, make sure you press it down far enough to get a good seal, turn off your oven, Let the vacuum run a couple of minutes while the abs cools.

Now all that's left is to trim the fat off of your new cover. I use a 5 in 1 tool and a dremel. A band saw would be nice though!

As you can see, the ABS flexes to the shape of the deck nicely and road clearance is pretty damn good!
These enclosures shown here are 39mm in height. 2 zippy 4s 8000's or 2 zippy compacts 6s 5000s fit great.

I'm limited to enclosures under 19" in length because of the size of my oven so keep that in mind when you're hunting for ovens. You can find free broken ovens pretty easy. Then just do what I did and buy a 110v smoker element. It will install into your oven easily and you'll be up and running without an electrician. I think the elements cost about 30 usd. If you don't do this, you'll need to get your 220v oven wired into your house or shop. I would have needed a new panel installed as well as some new wiring. Quoted $1500 to $2000. Of course I chose the DIY alternative. Haha!

This seems like the best way to make enclosures! 

And there is enough flex in the ABS to not crack if your deck flexes, right? That's one thing I ran into with my Arbor pintail... The only way to make everything work was to set it up like a boosted board, with the battery in the front, everything else in the back, and nothing in the middle. This prevented me from using larger batteries, because I didn't have a way to make a flexible case in the middle to mount components to.

@cmatson I think if your enclosure had soft walls (angled, not straight up and down) it would definitely flex with your board.

@onloop  Yeah it's available for the same price in sheet form. I haven't purchased any but I was thinking about it. It would be cool to find someone to sublimate graphics into the sheets. Then we could do some cool stuff.

Have you tried different plastics with this method? Just wondering about acryllic because it comes in multiple colors and also in clear and color tinted clear. ITs probably tough enough for this application, right?

If I was going to do a floor model, something to build and take to events for display, i'd likely want to use a clear or tinted box so you could see the guts, possibly with a mirror film applied to the deck below the box.

I tried acrylic one day because I found a sheet for 4 bucks. It worked, but it was really brittle. I agree it would be cool for say a lighted display on a showroom floor, but I don't think it would last long on a board.

I sort of ran into the same problem when i was slumping some lexan for an art project. I thought it was because i was using too much heat since i was using a mapp gas torch at a distance (i didn't have a good heat gun at the time) but maybe its just the way the plastic is. Looking forward to the pics!

Also, I'm on the hunt for colored ABS. Seems like the only places i can find it only have it in black or white, but i know it can be colored and even clear. Hell they make tail lights out of the stuff and tail lights are tinted clear.

3mm = ~1/8th inch

3/16 will work. The thing is though, it is a lot harder to trim and your enclosure will be super heavy. Flex will definitely be an issue too. There's no way it will conform, so you'd have to make a perfect mold to match the concave of your build.

I'm working out a process in my head that would let me use the deck as the vacuum table without destroying it with holes. I think it can be done. That would allow you to mold to the concave of the deck being used resulting in a perfect box for the deck. Only downside is that if people wanted you to do this for them they'd have to mail you their deck. lol

If I nail down the process though I'll share it with you. Its something i'm going to need to be able to do before I can build the quality of customs that I want.

just ordered some ABS from ebay. Hopefully I can talk my wife into letting me borrow the oven in the kitchen to droop some plastic in. Wish me luck!

I also just ordered a blank longboard deck from a skate supplier on ebay, but that's another thread. I will say that it has an ideal wheelbase for the space cell and its 9ply rock maple which means that a decent sized cavity can be routed out of it. its a crazy bullet shape with deep wheel wells but no kicktail, reminds me of one of bustin's DH boards. All of that is to say that the plan is to vac mold a sleek, low profile box for it while using the deck as the vac table if possible.

That's a good point, i'll have to look into that. I know cooking food in plastic is bad, and having food in there with plastic is bad, but i don't know if having just plastic in there is bad for food that's in there later when there's no plastic around. Of course there is the risk of ruining the oven if it melts too much and gets all over. But then again the oven is already on its way out anyway, maybe i can help it along and get a nicer one.. hehehe)

i spent most of the holiday weekend getting a good start on my vac table setup so i can make boxes specifically for my decks. 

I made a form for the boxes using part a blank deck i pressed. i drilled a million holes. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BAqR4lJBBlh/?taken-by=longhairedboy

then i made a table for the whole thing complete with an oven box. I'm going to get a toaster oven and tear it down for the heating element and controls, then line the box with foil and put the element there. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BAtMP0YhBgo/?taken-by=longhairedboy

hoping to finish it up this week and start tasting it out. I would have been on this a lot sooner except i stopped to have an affair with fiberglass. 

if i can get this done and working i'll have Scarlet deck and box combos for sale on my site along with @psychotiller 's boxes that fit regular concave decks a bit more snugly.

I've still got some adjustments to make on the form, but its very close to putting out boxes. I've just been very busy with other things lately, and i was sick for about a week so i haven't been able to get this to 100% quite yet. My last attempt was close but no cigar.  Using a section of my deck as the vac table surface has presented a number of challenges but i think i've got it almost nailed down. 

hopefully i can get the process worked out soon so i can sell some DIY box and deck bundles!

i forgot to point out that the Sunbeam space heater core is doing its job nicely. It probably takes longer than an oven would, but it does do a decent job of cooking that plastic and making it slumpy. It takes a lot of experimentation and finagling though to get it to work.

@psychotiller That "lexan" looks more like Lucite to me, but I know the names are typically interchangeable when buying sheets. When I worked at an injection molding plastic factory years ago the only time I saw bubbles in the Lucite was when the injection pressure was low or if they were cleaning the nozzle and left a ooze pile on the floor. I bet that plastic is going to need HOURS of really low heat (under 200*F), and you'll need to heat the mold along with it. Instead of using a vacuum make a hand pump so you can pull the air slowly and not cause too much cooling? 

Alternately, get some super thin stuff and make two pieces, then paint on layers of resin in between.
I really like the idea of clear enclosures. Vacuuformed polycarbonate would be perfect.

Yep! Haha. It's always a little different.  You can reach in and touch the abs to make sure it's soft all the way to the frame (not just the middle). Once it starts to sag you should work fast or it will get too hot, or will cool off and not form.

yeah i kind of can't wait. Its basically the only thing holding me back now. I just couldn't justify getting a junker from craigslist to mess with when i knew one that will work would become available soon, just didn't know when. Our current oven has a bad element on the range and the element is worth more than the whole thing, and its old, and the drawer underneath is total bullshit, bugs in the LCD display, the whole thing is awful and ready for the garage. so it was an easy sell. We're waiting for the memorial day sales coming up in a month or so and its on.

Do yourself a favor. Buy a $30 110v smoker element.  It'll come with a cord/maybe even a temp gauge. You just pop the bottom element out of your oven, then run the cord of new one out and through the back of your oven. The smoker element gets to the perfect temp and won't require 220 hook up.

I'll have to double check then, but it looked like the plug they used was 110 and not 220 when i was cleaning behind it the last time, but maybe i'm mistaken. I'm pretty sure the 220 rail is in the same breaker box though (we have more than one) so either way it shouldn't be a problem. If i end up having to replace my spot welder i'm going to replace it with a 220v version, so i may need to go ahead and put a 220v circuit in the garage anyway. 

Now i'm not going to rest until i pull the oven out and check the plug. lol

@psychotiller The memorial day oven sale was a success! i have the old oven in the garage now. As soon as i get a chance it will be time to cook some plastic in that thing. 

What temp do you cook your ABS at? I know you're using a 110 smoker element, but i wasn't sure if you knew what temp it ran at.

It stays under 300. But if I don't keep an eye on the abs it will bubble. Lately it's been so hot here I can't get a perfect enclosure.

Hydrographics A.K.A. Water Transfer Printing or aqua-dipping.

You lay your preprinted design (most commonly used to apply camo-design to rifle-stocks and carbon to car parts) on a bath of water, activate it with an activator spray and dip your object into/trough it.

Look it up on youtube "hydrographics".
"mydipkit.com" seems to have good and affordable kits for all you american people (https://www.mydipkit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2&products_id=193)

I think its a perfect solution to give d.i.y. enclosure a nice finish.

I'll have to measure it to be sure, but i think it will accept a 24" sheet of plastic, so 22" usable not counting a frame? I don't have a vac table, per se. I have a form i made specifically for my decks that works but i haven't been able to evenly heat the plastic to the degree it needs to cut those hard corners along the edge like yours seem to.

yes. I built an entire "cooker" around a sunbeam space heater. It failed to sufficiently provide even heat around the edges of the plastic resulting in the sheet not conforming to the edges of the form. 

I tore it down and used the framing to build my xcarve table and threw away the sunbeam. Ovens are really where its at apparently.

I'm having fiberglass boxes made for my monolithic custom builds as well as a DIY deck-and-box combo, but i want to sell smaller split-style ABS boxes with 7 ply decks as an option as well. 

I'm meeting with the fiberglass guy on tuesday. I'm pretty excited. They won't be very cheap, but they will be exactly what i need.

Thanks @psychotiller and @longhairedboy for the inspiration and all the great info 
I just made my first vacuum form enclosure
I wanted a slight concave so I built my vacuum bed with a curve in it it took 2 attempts to get the heat right.
I used .060 Kyvex

One question how do you avoid the little divots from the vacuum table holes around the edge of your enclosure?

This is for my first build a 28" mini cruiser 
the enclosure is ~6x11x1"

no need to coat it, the plastic will not stick. Right around 300 is the sweet spot, make sure the PLASTIC is at 300, your oven may have to be hotter. I've gotten better results with 1/16in abs, it's plenty sturdy too.

also anyone tried making a tab and slot to attach the plastic, or you could call it different names, but with a tab on the plastic that inserts horizontally into a hole in the deck?  I've got these decks with holes cut in them like 15mm deep for the electronics, and I'd like to put (3) thin slits into the 2 sides of the deck and cut the plastic so it has 6 tabs that fit in those slits and snap it in.  so no screws.  not waterproof but i dont ride in the water.

That’s one that I’ve never tried. I agree though. It would be durable. I have to go to the plastic shop today. I’ll pick up a sheet and report back.

I have a square of this on my bench at work, its great for cutting and assembling on because of its density.  Unfortunately its also much heavier than ABS.  

I'm sure it would be tough as nails, but if you want an extremely durable enclosure (more durable than ABS, why would that even be necessary?) I think fiberglass would be a better alternative as its just as strong and much lighter.

HDPE  has a melting point around 280° but the info I found suggested a 330° working temp. Also to heat it until it sags 2" before forming. Hdpe can also be done inside the house as there are no harmful fumes produced. I'm still working on a way to tilt my oven 45° so I can fit a 24" frame in flat horizontal.  Otherwise I'm stuck with this 20" crap.

I've found that polycarbonate is pretty brittle when cutting it. I score the rough shape, then snap pieces off.  The I sand for the overall finished shape.  Then progressively drill bigger and bigger holes for the rough slots and then use a file to make the final slot shape.

How thick were u doing Mike?  I was going to do something thin. Forget exactly how thin they have for sale. What u cut it with ? A dremel good enough for an outline cut?

In usually use 8-15mm stock. Get you a big fat flat edge and a scoring knife to make the rough shape. I use a bench sander to get my outside edges, a Dremel and file to get my insides. Just be careful how much pressure you put on it.  When drilling the bit will try to grab and pull through, don't let it.  Back off and keep the nit just barely cutting until your through.

Make sure you dry it first in an oven to get all the moisture out,  it can cause bubbling otherwise

polycarbonate (lexan) I was going just frame and lay over open-topped oven.  I don't have a normal oven big enough to fit the size I want to do.  maybe I can just flip it a couple times on low heat, as its got the top side open, and that would dry it enough?  or i'll make a cover I guess.  reading it can be an issue.  thanks for the headsup.

Bumping up an oldie but goodie!
I'm thinking of starting to make my own enclosures but I don't have space for a second full sized oven. Would a toaster oven do the trick?
You can get ones with 50-60 liter volumes, easily enough for smaller enclosures, and you can probably do the bigger ones as two separate halves.
The main thing I'd think you need to look out for is that because the space is smaller the plastic will heat up more quickly, so you really need to keep a close eye on it.
Thoughts everyone?

It actually wont heat up more quickly. The smaller elements just don't pack the punch larger elements do. Also, do this in a well ventilated area.

Thanks, I'll make sure to do so. Basically, same amount of time, keep an eye on it and try not to screw it up too much.
