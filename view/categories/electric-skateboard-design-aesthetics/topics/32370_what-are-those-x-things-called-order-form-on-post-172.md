I've seen on some boards what looks like a reinforcement X mounted on the deck side of the truck. What are these 

Thank you

Can't find one for looking now, it's basically in an X shape going to each bolt that goes through the board to the truck

It replaces the 4 bolts normally used with one piece of hardware, eliminating the need for two tools to tighten. Then you only need a wrench

X-bolt is what Chris Chaput (Abec11) called them.  Good luck finding them. I swear they've been out of stock for a decade :joy:

hmmm what's the point of having this "X" if the bolts are not permanently attached to them? Not using two tools to remove trucks would be awesome. just had to install the Shred Light brackets on three boards

@SilentException 

That's exactly what I did on my board.  Top plate out of 3/16" aluminum to stiffen the drop-through and a 1/4" aluminum riser below.  Resulting pocket provides a handy space for the battery meter.

These will be for pan heads for loaded vanguard decks....would you be able to make them for countersunk? reason I ask is that I noticed the used CF deck I have might have been over tighten cause I see a slight bend (looks like a crack in this, but it's not)

Flat Head Version: http://a360.co/2yyfXpN

Choose which style you like, red or blue.  If you'd like a design alteration let me know.

These will be milled out of 3/16" or 1/4" AL.

They look awesome. Color is not necessarily if it’s extra work. I prefer red since LHB states it adds 20% performance ;) How hard are these to make? Is it possible to add in a “nub” on the bottom of the countersink version so it will sink into the existing holes in the deck? Without that I’m afraid the aluminum might bend into the deck holes?....or maybe just make a larger surface area around the ends like a washer?

I will take two sets of each. So 4 pieces of each at say....$18 per two?

Actually, the the color coding was for the style.  The blue ones are a bit thinner than the red ones.  I still can't anodize, so they'll be raw AL.

So (4) sets in total.  Just let me know if you want the chunky version or the slimmer one.

True, steel would be the best.  Unfortunately my lightweight CNC struggles with it.  I'd need a coolant setup to get it done, and at the moment I don't have one.

I would have made a video, but between the CNC and the air handlers it's just too loud.  And the machining porn is not strong with this one - my borescope that used to look at the bit during milling broke.

Also!  just FYI each set weighs about 50g ~ 2oz.

Also!  Pricing, which is probably the most important part.  The material is fairly inexpensive, maybe $1 in material.  So it really comes down to machine time.  Each set takes about 26 minutes to machine.  If I had a more robust setup it would be faster.  At $25/hr that comes out to $10.83.

So I'm thinking $10 a set is a fair price.  No wife tax yet.  :D  

Shipping is probably USPS with tracking.  Assuming USPS priority is $6.

Example:  withing the US, (2) sets shipped would be (2)@$10 +$6, or $26.

Will DM everyone on the list with info.

@akhlut, just measure the holes on my Pintail 40"  they are 2,125" inches; so my guessing according to your chart... they are **New School**.  And the screw heads are **Flathead**. You made those X braces?

Shipping to the EU is $11 (at least it was for Ireland and Finland).  So $24 a set, or $37 for two sets.

Just fill out the form and you'll be on the list.

The universal nut keeper is a great idea! It's a real pain to get to the nuts when there is motors in the way. 

Maybe its time to start a new thread? So you can keep all the up to date info at the top of the thread. Its now hard to find the order form and its just going to get harder the longer this thread gets.

Maybe I should clarify how the process works so that everyone is on the same page.  Transparency is always a good policy.

It's just me and my small CNC.  This isn't my 9-5 (analyst), and my wife has made it very clear to me that family comes first.  So that means I can't get a set cut every day.  Sometimes it has to wait until the weekend to bang these out. 

I don't take payment when ordering because I cannot deliver at that time - these are cut-to-order.  It would be nice if I could build up a stock to fulfill orders quickly.  Unfortunately right now I'm in a time crunch - I'm teaching this semester.  

Also, you should know that each set takes about 30 minutes to cut.  That's comes out to be about $0.50 a minute ($13/30min).  Cheap shops charge double that.  The wife wants me to charge more - something that would be the same or equal to my regular job rate to make her opportunity cost worth it.  The obvious alternative is to build a more robust machine to cut more faster.  But I need to sell a lot more sets to do that.

Let's talk about the running costs.  Aluminum is cheap right now.  I don't factor material cost into the final product.  I also don't factor transportation costs into the price.  It's a two-hour round trip to my closest supplier, who happens to be awesome.  So that time, gas and wear-and-tear on my vehicle aren't factored in.  Then there is the obvious consumables - end mills.  They aren't cheap.  Last one I bought cost about $20.  I'll need to get a spare soon just in case.

I'm not complaining mind you.  If I didn't want to do this I wouldn't.  I really enjoy it, and I enjoy helping people on the forum.  It's my way of giving back.

@Bensaida , @BigBrit and @perron are next on the list!  My machine gave me some trouble at the end of the night last night.  Just strange behavior - I think some of the stepper drivers started to overheat, so I gave it a rest.  Had stuff to do today.  I'm hoping to get them cut tomorrow.

The orders for @mmaner, @Mikenopolis, @scepter are cut, sanded and ready to ship Monday.  

@deckoz, yeah, I can do that.  I need to find the Landyachtz font or something similar.  I wonder if I can get them laser-engraved...I know a guy.

@scepterr  what is the width and depth of the mounting bracket?

My guess:
![image|690x461](upload://5RdOvuecgskMVYMBlyCtrKiGgZ6.png)

I'm assuming that's a 1/4-20 screw.

I'm wondering if milling out a recess for the bracket is the best way to go, or whether clamp with a recess might work better.  I'd like to try one of these guys out...for science of course.  And I want to ensure that they don't vibrate loose and spin out of position.

It keeps the bolt heads from marring/splitting the deck.  All of the pressure on the deck is converted into down pressure and spread across the total of the brace as opposed to each bolt exerting down and side pressure on the deck itself.

You can put that in your brochure @akhlut :slight_smile:

You are a range demon so all you really aim for is parts that gives you range, so you are a function over form guy I think.... so this is the function

I’m not sure about everyone else, but I don’t like the hardware digging into my decks, the used CF deck I have looks like it was over tighten so this acts as a thick and pretty washer to relieve stress

I love the hardware digging into my deck and always have...it feels for secure to me and locked in, and yes over time or working on them it goes deeper but I try to remember it's all disposable anyway...the bolts not holding on my old skateboards was a great reason to go shopping for a new deck...I have just never had a skateboard break in this place or need any reinforcing there, I mean no disrespect, I'm just trying to understand the appeal of such a part..

It is true, I'm a function over form guy, without a doubt...if it's not serving a good purpose or even two purposes, I seldom include it on my boards..complexity hurts robustness overall, where simplicity is strength..

Totally understandable, we all value things and aesthetics differently. I see my boards/decks as precious belongings, my two Raptor 1 decks are hard to find these days. The Jet Spud is an awesome commuter that was gone for a while and probably will again. Working on the wood decks definitely wears those holes down over time.

If you want function, then @scepterr definitely has one since he got a custom made one for the huge headlight he wanted to use, here's a picture of the smaller one he tested![IMG_20180313_193747__01|618x500](upload://hoJBEJPL7TgckunLYE6TUCBeHEa.jpg)

I dunno.  A rubber washer will deform as you tighten it down.  Try a plastic washer instead, or a metal one with the cupped face toward the brace.

The recess should be 11mm, so it should fit a 10mm washer.

Try putting the battery meter in the front and the power in the back. This way you can see the battery meter while you’re on the board.

Could I spray-paint these, or would it just wear off w/ light scratches? Do you have to anodize them if you want a durable color, or are there any other options?

You can paint them, but it will come off.  Anodizing is probably the way to go.  Im putting an anodizing setup together now.  Probably a ways off in terms of  getting it 100% reliable.  I need a vibratory tumbler and a buffing wheel.  Lots of things to do to make this a reality!

I just put my first set of washers in a vibration tumbler overnight in walnut media.  It was all my buddy had because he normally uses it for polishing brass for reloading ammunition.


That media/substrate had literally 0 effect kver 12 hours, lol.  I figured it wouldn't, the walnut seems way too "soft" or "fine."  I figured might as well see.

What do you think would be best to tumble them in @akhlut?

Apparently walnut treated with a polishing compound is the bees knees:

Form filled and submitted @akhlut! Could it be possible to fill as much space to cover the gap on the drop through hole for the hummie deck? 

I recently saw @Mikenopolis photo of his x-things but wanted something to cover it up more as I’m routing cables via the Riptide tunnel riser. I wouldn’t mind it being more of a squre than an X but I’ll be good with whichever you think would be best :smile:

Yeah. Definitely have @akhlut make you the fat X to cover up the wires. I just redid my mount last night and added in the tunnel risers. This is how the wires are “exposed”. Of course it depends on which way you flip it

Yeah a fat X may do just the trick or maybe those shaped like a base plate? like @PredatorBoards Anodized finish and strangely looks alot like @kug3lis version of it. Might just try that later on even.

I wouldn't be too picky if it can't cover the hole completely as the deck integrity which is what these are really all about is more important anyway.

The way yours came out looks really nice either way @mikenopolis!

I don't have the deck with my yet and it won't be awhile before I do as its still has to get to @psychotiller before it makes its way to me as @skunk says.

I could ask @Mikenopolis for the measurements. Hope he has a set of calipers though.

If it would make it easier for you to just maximize the size all around instead of just getting it to cover the circle and cover as much of the hole like a plate of sorts, I'd be fine with that as well.

I could ask @hummie for just the hole measurements if you prefer to do it that way

You could make it extends a bit past the tip of the board, and then have one for the bottom, and have both pieces have screws at the end for another piece that connects the two pieces, to act as a bumper protector for the board.

Also maybe on the top you could offer some work holes for changing and on /off button.

that would only cover the area near the drop hole but still leave the sides of the nose/tail exposed wouldn't it? and wouldn't it be better to use a softer material with more rebound to absorb impacts when considering a bumper guard?

Yeah it would be better to use something softer, I'm just trying to think of something though.  That design was the best so far I've seen that could do that.  Maybe the design could be left as is, and the part that screws between the two would fit at the front, through the opening, with screw attachments for adding a softer bump guard that wraps about the front and a bit on the sides?

Wow that's great!  Any chance these will get made cause I'll buy four, since I have two of Hummies decks.  Though for the rear, the top and bottom would need to be made just for the bumper, no holes or wire openings for the on /off or charging.

Honestly, I think the bumper makes sense on the front of the deck, no so much on the rear.  Or am I wrong here?

@Mikenopolis just need the button and LCD you're going to use.

@hummie, they are intended to fix the truck plate bolts against the deck. Normally, when you tighten the bolt heads against the wooden deck holes, you wear down the holes and in some cases the pressure cracks the deck between the holes. I-Things and X-Things serve as stiff holding metal pieces on which the bolts could be tighten sandwiching the wooden deck between them an the truck plate underneath.

There are 6 parts in a hummie set (2 tops, 2 risers, 2 bumpers).  I'm cutting a set of them today to make sure the sizing is correct.  That set will probably run $50 - a price I'm not thrilled about, but I don't think I can do it for less.  

The NutStops take longer than a set of X-braces and consume about half the material.  I ran the numbers and they'll run $25 for a full set (4 parts) shipped inside the US.  If you've already ordered a set of X-braces you can order a set of NutStops for $20.  

On another note, a full set (X-braces, NutStops) will run $40 shipped inside the US.  

Engraving is on top of that.  Engraving takes time - a lot of time.  Not only that - every time I do an engraving there's CAD and CAM that needs to be done.  That's why engraving per plate is $10 to $15 depending on time and complexity.

Shipping outside the US is an additional charge (usually $14).  

I need to modify the form to incorporate all these new things and options.

Hey.  

I have an idea...one that _might_ not be insane.

Could we use spare barrel bushings as bumpers instead of a hard 3D printed part?

They come in a variety of heights, and can easily be shaved down with a knife.

 riptide tallbarrel is 19mm high...

May need to add a small bushing or spacer around the bolt to fit the bushing so it doesn't get pushed back but maybe not depending how close the holes are to the outside of the board

Excuse my oversized hardware,  couldn't find my 1 1/2.

That's with my 50° base plate if that makes a difference.

Wanted something much more solid. Will use the action mount for lights as well. This was almost the exact thing I was looking for. Would have been perfect if the GoPro mount was part of the design. A blank plate would work for me as well since I can use VHB and stick a mount to it. 

I wonder what it would cost for @akhlut to machine a solid mount on it. Would waste a bunch of material tho...

that first one is good.  can screw down into the plate to secure it.  the others are harder as you need a permanent post sticking up from the plate for the mount.  20mm distance is easy.  i can add holes and insert helicoils for the screws.

God, I feel bad too.

I wondered about the SS thing too.  I assumed, I dunno. Dumb.  I noticed and said nothing.

Pretty shitty of all of us who noticed that and didn't say anything in a pm or something.

Due to all of our neglect this happens.

Our fault Matt.

ok someone get out the tar and feathers. lol  I wouldn't blame yourself as the person who designed it/ ordered it probably had no idea about it.  Also if you look at the SS flag the lightning bolts are more vertical than these.  Slayer got into some shit with their eagle logo looking like the symbol from nazi Germany.  So I would not worry about it,  like you had said there are far worse things out there.  This was nothing to do with any sort of hate and everything to do with skating.

you guys have no idea.  

its worse.

the queue is solid, feels like 10 people deep.  i have more custom work than universal x-tings.  and i keep designing new stuff that more people want which backs me up even further.

its a great problem to have.  i just feel bad that i cant cut fast enough.  people are patient, but i need to get jobs out the door faster.

and now im cutting motor mounts for SR TKP.  

luckily, ive been given a new space at my institution and im setting it up now.

the great news is this is in a non-academic setting, so i can come here on my lunch break and make as much noise as i want.

progress.

typically an hour for a single engraved brace.  some are shorter, most are longer.  Milling the brace itself is fast, that's the easy part.  The engraving is the long process.  the V-cutters can't move quickly through the aluminum like an endmill because the effective speed at the tool tip is very slow - it's almost grinding through the material instead of cutting.  I've been able to speed up a little bit now that i have a tumbler.  six to eight hours in the tumbler helps deburr the engraving as well as the sharp edges left from milling.  After that it's off to polishing then an ultrasonic cleaning.

It's a process, but one that's been giving me really good results.  

I really need to build a website that documents the process and lets people choose different options.

Anyone have issues mounting these with Surf Rodz base plates using the farthest apart mounting holes? It seems the holes on the X-thing are not quite far enough apart to do so and for some reason the other mounting holes on my deck don't line up.

The fit should be tight, but not impossible.

![image|464x500](upload://65C4ApGOiSFIIogj2BxKF17aIGb.png) 

New school is 2.125" or 53.975mm

Old school is 2.5" or 63.5mm

The holes are made with 6.53mm end mills, so they are slightly inset so that the bolts heads have more meat to press against.  I can change this in future models if there is a clearance issue emerging.

It would go from this:

Hello @akhlut,

I filled the google form hoping to get a price (including shipping) before the end of the process but nothing (and asking the address with only one line of text is a bad idea)... So now I'm in queue but I don't know how much it will cost, such a nonsense !

How is it supposed to work to get final price including shipping (universal models)? And the same for custom models ?

Thanks in advance, keep the good work ! ;)

I don't know what exactly you would need, but I am sure you could sell some limited edition x things in CF.

They even have a bunch of colored fiber plates and stuff too.

These are the guys I get all my CF stuff from.

This would have to be run a little differently than I usually operate.

1. We'd need to agree to a color.
2. We'd need to agree on a thickness.
2. I need 10 people to pre-pay a deposit so I can get the material (this shit is expensive).
3. You choose a shape and let me know what you want.
4. I cut the parts and invoice you the balance.  The balance will depend on machine time and amount of material used.  I'll calculate the total price less the deposit and give you an itemized bill.
5. I ship the parts to you
6. You pay the balance when they get there.

I think this is pretty reasonable.

Survey Monkey link to accomplish step 1.

So here's where it gets tricky.

So each individual brace takes up about 70mm x 95mm of area (this includes tool paths and 1mm of waste all the way around the part.

And I have to be conservative about how many parts I can produce.  Shit happens, so I need to have a little bit of material in reserve in case something goes terribly wrong.

The numbers below are for the 3mm red kevlar.  Others may not be the same.

12"x12" (300mm x 300mm) I can reliably produce 5 sets, with 1 set in reserve in case shit goes south.  Those 5 sets would be $17 each for the carbon fiber plate alone.  No bueno.

If we move up to a 12" x 24" sheet I can produce 10 sets reliably with potentially 2 in reserve.  That's $12 per set for the plate.

Going to a 12" x 36" sheet I can produce 15 sets reliably with potentially 3 in reserve.  That's $11 per set for the plate.

The sweet spot is 12" x 24".  10 sets @ $12/set

|W|H|Cost|Cost/mm^2|Sets|Sets, Actual|Cost Per Actual|Min Cost|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|300|300|85| $0.00094 |6|5| $17.00 | $14.00 |
|300|600|121| $0.00067 |12|10| $12.00 | $10.00 |
|300|900|167| $0.00062 |18|15| $11.00 | $9.00 |
|300|1200|214| $0.00059 |24|20| $11.00 | $9.00|

I think it's going to be difficult to get enough people to agree on a single color.  Ideally I'd go 12x36, but that's 50% more people than 12 x 24.

Not that different.

I like the twill better too.  It looks really nice.

@Indiangummy yeah, I'll need a new endmill for this.  But  that's not the end of the world.  we'll build it into the price of the set.  might add $1-2 per set.

The most recent try guys video the play pubg against cloud9 and deadmou5.

Make sure you got a good plan to be cutting that carbon fiber. I see you're running a desktop CNC router setup like me. It's critical to your health and safety that u take care of the carbon dust. That shit will mess you up real bad.

Ideally try to cut them under a water bath so none of it goes airborne.

Maybe I am paranoid but I've heard countless stories when I brought up the idea of routing CF to ppl I know.

More like 80 to 90%

Milling is fast.

So this is another simulation:

https://youtu.be/ERx9ufGfLOw

The milling for this part takes about 12 minutes, while the engraving takes 38 minutes.  That's 75% of the total time.

For that deep cut honeycomb part above the milling takes 12 minutes and the engraving takes 1 hour 40 minutes (100 min).  The engraving takes 89% of the total time.  And the more complex the engraving the longer it takes.

It actually is. The way I did the jokers you did for me was painted over top with with black nail polish and or testors model paint and let it dry a bit then take 100% actone and put it on a rag or paper towel and wipe over the paint the paint in the cuts will stay and the rest will wipe off.  Took a little testing to see what  solvents would dissolve the testors paint

I havent had the time to get the right hardware or install them on the board yet.  I think it would probably hole a little better because it isnt on the smooth metal surface it is in the rougher area that was carved out so the paint actually has something to hold to.  It always makes it so you see all the little details.

@Skunk
that looks really far forward.  Is it really that far up or is it just the angle?  I designed it from a photograph, but I didn't think it stuck over the edge like that.

:worried:

## \#803 Posted by: Skunk Posted at: 2019-02-09T23:10:19.184Z Reads: 119

I think it's a combination of the angle and the fact that I mounted drop, so the plates literally sitting on top of the base plate not on the deck like it's intended.  so the perspective is skewed it does pass the front of the deck just a bit.

Don't worry about it.  When you get a chance (no rush) snap a pic of the brace from the underside so I can see the deck profile against the brace.  Try to keep the camera as square to the bottom of the deck as possible.

Whats really cool about this is the depth of options.  I wouldn't have picked hardly any of the skin jobs I have done, but they are all so independently sick and personalized.

So dope.

I wasn't even that psyched on this fabric TBH. @mmaner saw the potential.

That's why it is cool there are almost a million pattern options on spoonflower.


If I just did what I liked I would miss out on seeing such awesome end projects.

Totally.  The depth and breadth of the parts I make are because the community has driven the designs.  Sure I tinker with shapes, but it's the voices outside of my own design process that drive things forward in ways that the community desires.

In short, the stuff I do on my own is lame, because it's for me - boring and utilitarian.  When I collaborate with people is when we make awesome stuff with style and aesthetics.

Absolutely.  We're in an era of fit and finish now.  

The mechanics and electronics have been sorted for 99% of boards out there.  The mechanical and electronic bleeding edge is a lot more like a papercut instead of the sucking chest wound that it used to be.  More people with better tools making things, standing on the shoulders of the giants who came before us and advancing further than thought possible.

But that said people are placing a much higher value on aesthetics now.  People want to have their hair on fire and look good while they're at it.  The difference is so apparent, it's like night and day.  And it's all about the decks and the effort that we put into them - they should look awesome as well!

These honeycomb V claw were just too beautiful to just defile them with alum black. I knew I’d have to swag them up with color the moment I laid my eyes on these beauties. 
It was either Cerakote or anodizing. I was blown away by all the artistic stuff the Cerakote guys do. It also adds a layer of protection.

I'll just chime in a little bit here. 
I work at a firearm factory here in Utah, we use cerakote for all of our actions and barrels that aren't carbon fiber. For being a very thin layer it lasts a very long time and is surpisingly durable. 

I'm no expert on it but I've learned a fair amount in the last 4 months. Just to give an idea on pricing one of the larger bottles below lasts for roughly 100 barrels and costs about $100. 
The pink one can do about 10 barrels and cost somewhere around $25. Its not cheap to get into for personal use ($500ish), however the results might be worth it to some. 

TLDR; expensive, but can have amazing results

How does the application and curing process work? What kind of prep does the surface to be coated require?

What all equipment is needed? Is it toxic during curing?

Shit, I need to just research this more.

Imagine being able to really customize all the metal components on a high end build.

Why not use a powder coating setup. It is surprisingly cheap to get into if you have a compressor and a toaster oven. Not sure how it compares to cerakote but it holds up well.

It tends to chip where screws are, but other then that it works well. I have a set of @akhlut motor mounts that are powder coated in matte black.

Rocks from the road will chip it too. Would be intersting to see how much better some of these firearm coatings do. There is an outfit north of me that specializes in a coating similar to cerakote and I have been tempted to utilize them on some projects.

The freak in me is tempted to thin some epoxy and tint it with pigment. Just need something to take the shine out so it would cure in satin or matte.

@Colson003 is it a 2 part coating, does it use a catalyst...?

Powder Coating adds a good bit thicker layer than cerakote I think.

And cerakote is more resilient

Ok. Lots of questions to answer. @Sender 

Application just involves a low pressure spray gun. 2 light coats is all it takes. 

Curing is simply cooking in an oven at 300 degrees Farenheit for 45 minutes. 

Prep work is sandblasting followed by being wiped down with acetone. 

I cant imagine that it's toxic during curing. Then again, its in an oven. 

Equipment; low pressure spray gun, beakers/syringes to accurately measure catalyt to the cerakote, oven.

@chaka yes its a two part coating, more catalyst makes the end result ...glossier? Less catalyst takes longer to cure and has more of a flatter finish.  

Yeah powdercoating adds significantly more to the surface as compared to Cerakote which barely makes a difference when it comes to the inner workings of the action in a firearm. That is why we use it.
