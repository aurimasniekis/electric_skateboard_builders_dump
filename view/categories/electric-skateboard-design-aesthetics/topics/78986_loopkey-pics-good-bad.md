Not installed yet. And the one I had was on the TB enclosure. I think its about to hold something 6s. 

I'm curious as to how creative people for with theirs.

My battery and the vesc is too mounted.
I donâ€™t use a loopkey, but a xt90s as direct connection from battery to vesc which I can take out easily at any time.

@Skunk probably it makes sense to link some panel mounts for xt90s ?

Those are great.  I'd like to see how creative people got with installation.
Looking for inspiration for future builds.

@skatardude10 thanks for sharing.

Someone made a printed unit that fitted in the drop though hole. The key plugged in and then swivelled flat. Really neat. No idea who made it and couldnâ€™t find the files. It might jog someoneâ€™s memory though.
(Edit)
I think it might have had something to do with @hoeksame1 and @pjotr47 ?

Was just thinking about the same one. If someone volunteers to scroll through the last 6-8months of the no words thread they will find it lol

Looks kinda ghetto, but it works and it doesn't let in any water.

I used an mt60 on my last loopkey that fits with a bit of a push into the switch hole.  I'll upload a pic when I can be bothered.

I'm still in the process of mounting it just Velcro to the enclosure  for now but I made this riser fit my lipo balence charge set up and I'm gonna run the loop key from 6s to 12s from the very front of the riser. I just have to route the board a bit to accommodate the 10 Gage ![15458690454656061465928688873907|375x500](upload://3PVvclbRpGs8Ri3wRl0nz8uVrA8.jpeg) ![15458699055521746513556941829639|375x500](upload://ij4wbe77y7wfEYEqdKvhPZoANpF.jpeg) ![15458701119693708086121617240409|375x500](upload://pgBODmdGuf4LRtAjmGB15IO9dK7.jpeg)

First one has the pcb mount on the inside. Like this.

2nd one came out ugly. :) Working well so I'll leave it for now. Instamporph plastic.

3rd one is still being debated. Might swap out the huge washers and 3d print something to fill that cavity. I like female on the board-side, but the way things were going for that board, the other way makes more sense, at least for now.
