I finished my vacuum forming table today! Now I have to make a mold for my enclosure. I want it to look nice, but don't have any ideas.

Post your enclosures! I am looking to be inspired.

I really like how small mine is but it is very fragile.I have considered making it into a mold, but it probably would lose a lot of the details on it.

I agree those look great, he likes to laugh at my chop jobs I do hah. I finished embracing the box at the top I need a rubber o ring and weather strip to seal the box. Then I will get a larger fan to vent the box, I have washers between the board and top piece to let heat escape from the top where the fan will be. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/27e4c57b88db9d7f546edbf10d1ebe410a2e933c.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/69a43e67db2d8eb0640b2c5450f41b4e6e01a2e5.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b151cd1fd5ff3c4dd6aae6b0738319a2947e0825.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fe4addbb37819089f559f9e0fc8ebef9789bf9ec.jpg" width="281" height="500">

@lowGuido Yes indeed. It's actually two since the first LC-1 was dead, and I had to buy the newer MTX-L version with the built in guage/display, which is awesome and much easier to use. Used it to help my tuner remotely tune my Subaru WRX.

@lowGuido Nice! Another Subaru lover. I'd like to see some pics of the Subaru and the Nissan's. We should start a new thread for our other non-skate related motorized vehicles. 

On topic, I love having the carry handle option. So convenient.

I can take pics of whatever you want, just tell me. I don't have them on my current board they are for a future board. They are made of very thick abs and are shiny, they don't seem to be vacuum formed but rather molded and have no wrinkles or other defects.

I was more interested in how they fit on the Vanguard as I purchased a deck a few weeks ago. I stumbled across your photos looking for a good enclosure for it. 

That's good to hear they are are high quality. I am going to go with the ESC enclosure and the smaller lipo enclosure.

They fit really nicely (i test fit just for fun as you saw in my photos). They have a slight concave to them which fits the vanguard PERFECTLY. Really they fit perfect.

```
2 Reasons,
1: the enclosure was lifting between the screws and I was trying to make it seal.
2: I had to grind some of the deck away on the bottom to make a wide flat spot for the battery pack and enclosure.
adding more screws actually added more stiffness back to the board from the enclosure.
I tried it with less screws and it was noticeably stiffer with the extra screws.
Total weight of the board now is 20 lbs.

It's a 2 piece clam shell made by Serpac. 
There available on Amazon and other sources. 
The bottom is screwed to the deck with the straps running under the bottom and around the top.

The TB 12s Esc's work very well with 10s. 
Very smooth and controllable. 
The battery is a custom diy that I built out of Basen 26650 cells. It's a 10s2p 9ah. It takes up the foward half of the enclosure. The BMS, Esc's, sbec and battery meter circuit fill the rear half.

You dont really need to match the curvature if you make it like Boosted Boards. Plastic printed nylon is naturally flexible. Also, the battery compartment that boosted created is slightly narrow and longer than it is wide making it flex better when screwed on. The speed control compartment also does not take the entire width of the deck. These charscteristics along with printing in nylong plastic will make it strong against impact and flexible enough to mount it on top of a nice water resistent gasket. Just copy Boosted Board Specs exactly

So this is a new idea i came up with! I wanted a swappable power pack. They way it works is the white piece that is bolted between the deck and back truck is aluminum delrin composite. The composite runs the span of the wheel base and the other side has 2 peices of aluminum than hold it down. The abs enclosure is bolted down to the composite. What i wanted is to be able to build a small latch on all my decks so i can just swap the trucks and power pack to have a new board. All i need to do is take off the trucks.

I started with 80 grit (60 would have been better), then 150 and 240. I'll probably give it a final sanding with like 500 and another two coats, it's still not quite perfectly smooth. But it works really good if your enclosure just needs a little smoothing out. 

No primer needed, paint is just regular old Krylon Fusion satin black.

I'm using the flex 1 deck so it's the most rigid of the lot, but I will say it flexes just fine. Just as much as it did before the enclosures. Also, Its inspired by the Boosted Board which employs this setup and keeps the default characteristics of the board intact.

It doesnt, and since it's flexing inwards there's really no risk to the battery at all. When you stand on the board it essentially flattens out so there is no flex to battery the way I have it setup. My batteries are not "attached" to the board, but are wrapped and packed in the enclosure for a tight fit that gives them room to move with the board.

I looked at getting mine done from there because my printer was being a bit finicky, but they wanted $80 a piece for 3 pieces! One thing though is I had to cover my enclosures in epoxy for extra strength. 3d prints like to split under pressure when there isn't good layer adhesion.

I'm also trying to design some Vanguard enclosures. Trying to squeeze a 12s4p pack into the space isn't easy and requires some... inventive battery layout. (Not sure if this is viable...)
Would the flex mess with this kind of set up too much (Even though it's a split design) Only problem is that I can't really think of a way to get this fairly complex shape out of the computer right now...

If you dont have a cnc or 3d prnter, what you can do is slice the model into 1/4" layers and print them on paper, then cut those shapes from 1/4" plywood and glue them together, with a bit of patience and sanding you should get it looking really good.
Then you can do whatever you want with it (vacum form, gfk, cf, paint, you name it)

I had an enclosure design just like this one with curves and everything. I used a program called [Pepakura](http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/) to turn my 3D file into printable pieces that you can cut out and glue together. It can take a long time to assemble all the cardstock pieces (nothing music/audiobooks can't help), but it lets you get very precise designs out of the computer. Once you've assembled it, you can use fiber and resin directly on the paper model, or fill it with plaster of paris to get a cast for vacuum forming. This is the same process used to make prop armor/helmets. I'll be posting photos of my personal build soon if you want to see how mine turned out.

Ideally, the designs are printed on cardstock, then coated with a layer or two of resin to harden it. I plan on doing a full write up as soon as I can on the whole process. No one seems to have used this method before for electronics enclosures.

I did mine from fiberglass yesterday and it turned out pretty well, its not the best since i was too lazy to make some support for the fiberglass to stay in shape but after a night of drying im proud of myself hehe.
This modelling is not eazy especially if its your first job with fiberglass

Just for fun to test other "fiber" possibility (I don't recommand it breaks pretty quickly !) but if you got an old favorite tshirt just for decoration ... it could be fun ... maybe :blush:

what I really like is my 3d printing inlay ! Looks so cool, under gorgeous CF hummy !! I will test it again soon ;)

@Fabar Yes. Slowly getting a range of enclosures together. 
I’ve made a couple more moulds today. A long one in matte finish with BB branding and a long one but not so deep for a lower profile battery. 
When I have some come out of the mould I’ll put them on here.

I've made 4 builds and always the same way, with a sheet of 2mm rubber. And added some hardplastic layer underneed to protect the batteries and other stuff.
Very easy cheap way and always worked fine for me :slight_smile:

I made a form out of wood by sanding down and gluing together some old 2x4. I then wrapped the wood with plastic wrap to be able to separate the final shell from the form when it was done. Then I did 4 layers of fiberglass mat, painted it, and voila!

I think next time I would probably just buy an abs enclosure or do Kydex or something. The fiberglass kits were expensive from my local hardware store and the whole process was frustrating at times.

This is the enclosure I am designing for use with ABS Vacuum Forming.  Its actually a form, but this what the end result will look like.  Each section is 10ix8.5 inches for a total of 19x8.5 inches (1 in overlap in the center).  There are slots for phase wire & sensor cables and a place for a volt meter.  

The space for the volt meter is ready to cut out and should fit a wide variety of meters.  The slots for phase & sensor wires is designed to use rubber grommets around the cables.

I almost put a space for a switch, but its just a 16mm hole, so I left it out.  I might actually remove the volt meter space as I have been cutting a square hole in my decks recently so the volt meter can be installed top side.

I'm not actually planning on selling this, just something I've been working on in my spare time.

There's a few things I'd do differently if starting over, but for now I think the enclosure is finished. Was a bit more effort than I had expected, details all over [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/polyurethane-battery-enclosure-bad-idea/24480).

I did not, need the mold 1st and that is hard thing to find. Specifically, you would need someone to cut the large shape from MDF then using .5 in does make the phase wire guide.
