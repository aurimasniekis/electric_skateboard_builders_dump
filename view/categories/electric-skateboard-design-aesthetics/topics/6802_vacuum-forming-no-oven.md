I really want to start vacuum forming enclosures to replace the tackle box on by board, but I don't want to use my brand new oven and the toaster is too small. I have a heat gun and a hair dryer... Will those work? Is there another way?

nope.

I vacuum formed my enclosure today in my kitchen oven. ABS plastic.

Any particular reason you don't want to use yours? A lot of people are concerned with the toxins -- you won't get them unless the plastic makes contact with anything and burns. I propped my frame up on some wood and it worked great @ 350f.

I have a youtube video coming soon and this is included.

@link5505 It's an expensive oven... Cleaning it will not be fun, and knowing me something will go wrong. Maybe I can use my camping oven though. How big do the sheets need to be to make a decent sized enclosure? (What sheets do you use?)

Don't use a brand new oven in all honesty it does leave a smell for at least the day. There are other options which I can go into but a quick Google search will do s much better job.

Includes building a box and using either a space heater or lamp

Try a toaster oven. Some of them can plug straight into the wall outlet and can heat up to decent temps. I found one big enough to do big enclosures for around $100 AUD

don't build one out of a space heater. ITs a waste of time. Best bet is to get on craigslist or something like that and find a busted range with a good oven for cheap

I just do it my oven

Completely cover everything under the frame in foil
Run a fan and it's fine in a few hours
I do watch it like a hawk the whole time
I do the foil every time just in case but I've never even come close to a problem
$0 :grinning:

Ok so here are the measurements for the inside of my camping oven: 
Depth: ~10
Length: 14 
Height: 6.5

not sure if this is going to work :/ the smallest enclosure I need is at least 7.5 inches across, not accounting for the height

Ok so I did some calculations and took more measurements... Looks like it will work but I'll need a very specific size for the rim and the piece of plastic will need to be dremeled to fit my requirements

Ok so I found a cheap seller on eBay with the thickness that I want I can dremel the rest. How does this look? http://m.ebay.com/itm/4048-BLACK-ABS-1-4-THICK-12-X-12-FOR-SALE-/190853632566?hash=item2c6fc35236%3Am%3AmyiyZWO1eiaiwlGhPc15Tyg&_trkparms=pageci%253Aef6892a3-55dd-11e6-a6d2-74dbd180a17e%257Cparentrq%253A38d411581560a60cd58e9fb4fffc4c1b%257Ciid%253A16

1/4 in is super thick, will be hard to shape. 

The abs once shaped like a box will be very strong IMO you can go with 1/8 in. Excellent impact resistance and little flexibility just enough.

Go with 1/8". Works like a charm.
