Hey everyone, recently I have been planning on making a few decks with a custom press and some Canadian Hard Maple or bamboo depending on the deck. I am not great at drawing so I taught myself how to make longboard templates that can be printed at life size. If any of you need any just ask and I can do it.

Here is a picture of some I have printed: Landyachtz Topspeed, loaded vanguard, and I also have done a jet spud that is not shown.

Hey NickTheDude, you just use photoshop and then resize to the dimensions and then export as a photoshop pdf. Then open it in adobe reader and print it as a poster. Just offering my service because I have photoshop and some may not.

I just thought seeing as though its only a template which you will draw around, and with ink being so damn expensive, it may be better being a template just with the make/model in the middle of it.
Stilla great job though and a super idea (both you who thought of it!) i had considered dipping my toe into having a go at a skateboard deck but my printer would die halfway through that :-)

Thanks a lox897 the template was very good!!
i could´n test it more than 5 minutes today, it was quite wet the road, but the flex and the feel it was great!!
Tomorrow i will give it some sandpaper and transparent griptape.

@lox897 Thanks for doing this! I may follow @Surfer and cut one out from a snowboard.

Anyways, I'm curious what kind of flex you'd be getting with the bamboo decks you're working on. I've always loved the idea of a bamboo deck, and they seem to be able to take quite a beating compared to maple veneers, but I've loved the flexibility of my current (maple) deck.

It flexes ok. I'm only 50kg though so that doesn't help. With my 80kg dad it flexes really well with 12mm thickness. I've pressed one deck for testing and am making a proper bolt press which I have the materials for to press two others.

All the deck templates can be found on my mediafire, I realised they are too big to email. The crown longboards one didnt work, all their product pictures are corrupted for me. My internet's quite slow so they'll be finished uploading tomorrow. I'll send links tomorrow.

```
I got it from a manufacturer in china. But to be honest, bamboo is really fragile and hard to work with. It involves a lot more than just doing a Maple stiff deck. Mainly because you can't give it much concave because it's actually lots of bamboo strips pressed together sideways, so bending can cause it to snap. I have pressed one bamboo deck without concave and am close to doing the other two with concave. You also can't cut it with a jigsaw, only a router. But hey, if you are up to the challenge then go for it.

It is just a shape, I made it from a picture, dont have time ATM to remake it so i hope this will be enough :) Also I didnt find any pic from a side to make the kick as long as it is...maybe later when I will have more time I can rework it and make it better :)

The small difference (not caused by the top bottom side thing) is in the length of the tail, because the template I have made is from upside view and it doesn't include tail angle :/ Which is about 13 degrees i guess :/ If you plan on cutting the deck according to the template,you have to count with that :)

I can, but i dont think it would help you anyway, because the deck has a lot of weird angles and I can only make template, that does not include 3D structure :/ If 2D template of the look of the deck is enough, then I can :)

Well I mainly want the part of the deck that will actually be able to be stood on, I'm not concerned with where it angles up for the trucks.  I basically want to have a life size area of what I'll be putting the under mounted deck on.

This last photo is essentially what I'm concerned with, but it's at a raised 35° angle.  The schematic says it's 690mm, but that must be with it bent.  Let me message Frank or someone at Tampa and find out the actual length of that part of the deck.  Thank you!

Ok I messaged Frank and Ted at Trampa, so they are pretty good about responding quickly.  Should have the actual dimensions shortly :wink:

The deck part for the enclosure and to stand on, when flat is 695mm, and the overall length is 912mm as shown in the diagram, while at the center of the board where it is most narrowest, it goes from 230mm wide to 205mm. 

Those are the dimensions given by Trampa just now. :smile:  can you work with that?

Here it is :) 
As all of my templates, this is not 3D model...I cant make exactly the same template if I dont have the deck...it has the same dimensions and shape as boosted mini does, but it does not reflect angle changes like kick tail :) Hope you understand :)

Print it as a poster, tape it together and you are ok :) ALso I made it out of the picture from their website...there is everything needed like truck holes and so :)

Any chance you would be able to make a template for the jet spud 29", preferably from the underside so I can see where the wheel wells need to be. Thanks very much for the work you've done so far

Hey guys!
I wish I knew how to overlay an image I'd like to use on the loaded vanguard board. Can someone help me or tell me how to proceed?

it's better with a pic i think...

Montana markers, pencil, some sketching and a lot of time and you have high quality cover...That is the way I would go :O 

Or you can try to print it on a adhesive vinyl foil...I have seen few ppl doing that with their boosted boards...search YT

Or maybe some decent printer and epoxy glue to connect it, but you would have to be really precise! 

The last two methods needs high resolution picture to get good results! 

Or if you know a young talented artist in your neighborhood, try asking them ;)

I already know how to put my drawing on my board, because I already made 3 like that but the drawings were much smaller. For this drawing, I have a scale problem, I would like the drawing to fit entirely on my board but I can't do it. I have already tried several times but it is always too small or too big.

Is a very good quality image really necessary? Because I would really like to do this drawing precisely and I don't think I can find a better quality image... Besides the quality of doesn't really bother me, I'll manage (it's a santa cruz grip).

No no :joy:, I'll draw it under my board, drawing on the grip is still too complicated for me. For the moment I only have the model that lox897 shared at the very beginning of the conversation, the Loaded Vanguard 40" by 10" but since I did nothing else to print the model, I think the 38 would be better :smiley:
