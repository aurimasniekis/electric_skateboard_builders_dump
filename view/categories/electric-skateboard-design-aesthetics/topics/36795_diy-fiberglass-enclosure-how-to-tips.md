Needed: Fiberglass (I used 460g)
Catalyst
Resin
Mold (Wood,Styrofoam) you must cover it in some kind of tape unless its polyester is going to stick to it,regular brown packaging tape works well you can use duck tape also but its expensive
I paid 13$ for my materials in Croatia and still have left like a liter and something left of resin

Steps:
Cover your board in tape,use two layers since some resin may get under the first and you will end up cleaning the board with rakija since you do not have any nitro or 100% alcohol at home, **BUT** rakija is close :D

Calculate the dimensions of your enclosure and make a mold of the materials above.

Go to your hardware shop and buy some polyester resin (easier to mix than epoxy,still super strong I restored my boat out of this,and its not some grandpa boat its a speedboat that goes 80mph and 4.8m long so the forces on it are huge especially when you do a 90 degree turn in second at 70kmh)
Catalyst 5mll will do it
Roller
Fiberglass, I used 7 layers of 460g one, buy 2m so you have some left
Gloves resistable to this kind of stuff, i forgot and had to use those for the house, and they dont work well at all

Mix it together and start rolling, make sure you use enough of resin, cut out the fiberglass and repeat

When you are finished you can use your fingers to fix the corners a bit for better look

Now while it dries make a frame for the mold slightly bigger dimensions than the mold so it holds the fiberglass in shape so you get nice 90 degree sides,of course you need to cover it with tape.

You can also add some more material on the edges, so if it scrapes on the road you wont have problems

If you want it to dry faster put it in a warm place, the warmer the better 
Mine dried for 15hr and its rock solid

When it dries, you only have to cut out the excess, sand it a bit, fix the errors with some kit if you have them, and paint it!

Of course you can buy an enclosure from people from the forum for 50$ idk but this is wayyy more fun than just buying stuff, like 100% DIY

If I remember well it was about 450grams per m2
Its a really fun project just make sure to use gloves for this kind of stuff

3 layers of 450gsm makes a very tough box. I've used 600 gsm too, a little trickier to work with. The chopped strand mat makes it easier to work with than the woven mat if you are doing it for the first time. Gloves are a must and a respirator mask if you want to look after yourself.

7 layers will be bomb proof!
Plenty of sanding unless you make a mould from something smooth!

You should be able to get 4 layers from that. More than enough.

I've found 3 layers to be very strong.
I use a gelcoat on top to get a clean coloured finish but I use a mould which is a fair bit of work if you're only doing one enclosure.

I'm making mine with a surface curing and plan to put a few coats of black spray paint. I made the mold with some wood lying around in my garage.It didn't take too long to hand saw, but I have to hot glue them together and dremel sand them down. I'll post some pictures sooner or later

Can you mold an enclosure from an enclosure that already fits? I switched to a more Concave deck and destroyed the screw holes a bit over time. And can I use this stuff? I think I got the wrong one. ![20180118_165116|354x500](upload://4OGOkdC0TVrsMwn9BEQLQFF7aPO.jpg)

Just fill the holes with fiberglass and drill again, should work the same and a lot easier than making a new enclosure
Also im not sure how well will that work, never used it next time put some ruber washers so the screws head doesn't make the hole larger with vibrations.

won´t it stick to the last layer?

I didnt vacuum this one the results would a lot better
Make sure that resin wont stick to it
And that the resin doesnt get in to the pump or whatever

if resin don´t stick to the brown tape, I assume it will hopefully also not stick to a plastic pack.
Thx so far!

Is it bad if its sticks? I wouldn’t mind keeping the plastic with the enclosure. Just use fiberglass to make the plastic stronger

I used a vaccum bag and to make sure to have a better finish you need to make a sandwich made of:
Starting from the bottom. 
Last layer of fiberglass socked with resin (no bubbles have to be present, really important) 
Ply sheet (Nylon sheet that allow the excess resin to go through but doesn't stick to it) 
Breathable tissue (you can by it or you can use kitchen paper or newspaper) to absorb the excess resin
Vacuum bag (the one from cloth is enough)
```

I cut it rough with the shitty vibrating tool that looks like a dremel, then just sanded it down a bit

Just try shaking it out a bit then put it in the washing maschine alone

If you mean trimming the finished fibreglass I try to use extraction whenever I cut it. A lot of tools can have an attachment with a vacuum. Either the vibrating saw or grinder with a thin disk are good. I use a band saw with extraction and always wear a mask.

I had a mask and used a hack saw but it was tough as shit. Broke a pair of scissors.... i didnt have my dremel with me but i feel like it would use up a lot of discs.

I cant wait for my next build...i really feel i can make huge improvements by investing more time. This was def a rush job to get the build mobile

Theres a type of blade for jigsaws used for cutting tiles which is pretty good too. They go on forever.
If you can get someone holding a vac that will make it a more pleasant job.

Reviving this topic because enclosures and new material questions.

Has anyone tried to use Diolen Fiber as the outside layer?

![image|500x500](upload://jyhsrUxhCKlAYeIaritdEQoZzsR.jpeg) 

I think it's a hybrid fiber with nylon, something almost kevlar but not there yet, moldable freehand.

It has quite the mechanical properties and I guess using 2-3 fiberglass layers for stiffness and then plopping a Diolen layer might make the enclosure nigh-indestructible?

For example @bigben, maybe you might have some insight in "exotic" materials. :slight_smile:

I am planning to make my own enclosure just to keep the spirit of DIY, I will attempt to use Diolen as the outside layer so I can share my experiences later. Diolen is called "poor mans Kevlar(Aramid)" so I guess it's heckin good. Also 4x more expensive than fiberglass twill but costs 2x less than kevlar/carbon fiber.

But why do you even want to use it except for science?

My board got water damaged and started flying off full throttle and the hit a curb at 35kmh and it was a direct hit in @bigben enclosure, there was only cosmetic damage

If this is your first time working with fiberglass, i would keep it simple and instead of messing around with the new material I would find a cheap vaccum pump :D

I did research, it's supposed to be the outer layer of things. I will do it.

I bought enough to have several attempts anyways.

Lots of colors to choose from too. ;)

Ofc, there's Vectran too. But it's VERY expensive. Apparently it's "five times stronger than steel and ten times stronger than aluminum". Also requires something called LCP - Liquid Crystal Polymer(-isation?) technology. :smiley:

You can sublimate or 'print' any picture on a t-shirt/fabric/fiberglass(?) and if you take into consideration the darkening of colors after wet-out, you can make it kinda anything you like  
  
Easycomposites in the UK and East Coast Composites in the US offer Lots of different things to wet out
