So my motors right now are red and grey. It kinda ruined the whole aesthetic so I was wondering if anyone had some advice for blacking them out.

Should I take them apart and paint them? Are there any other types of coatings I should consider? Hydrographics look cool, and I thought they might work but I haven't been able to find anywhere to buy a kit for black hydrographics.

Seems like adding any type of paint or covering would diminish there ability to dissipate heat. 
Probably not s good idea.

I personally would try black marker or dye or something that didn't prevent them from bleeding excess heat into the atmosphere as much as paint would.  Maybe xylene to strip the paint then marker if needed.  The solvent in the marker though might cut the paint layer.
