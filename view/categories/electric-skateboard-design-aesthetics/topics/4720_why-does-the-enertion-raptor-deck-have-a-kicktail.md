Lots of people (word removed)  think the Raptor Deck is ugly!

Some people say shit like _"why don't you make a cool looking deck that looks like all those other ones that all those other cool brands are using to make electric skateboard with"_

When asked why they don't like the aesthetic of the raptor they often say because of the kicktail....

I say something like this "Yeah well the kicktail is not there to make it look good you fucking "______ ", it is a fucking functional part of the deck"

Anyway, i made a video with some examples of why i like the kicktail.

mostly it is due to these reasons.

* Improved cornering ability
* Improved maneuverability
* Ability to stop & rotate on the spot
* The ability to lift the nose up over large cracks
* The ability to be able to ride up 45-degree angle gutters.
* The ability to pop the deck up for tricks, like ollies & kickflips.


I made a vlog about it. (skip to 6:30 for the examples)

You're doing it right, it brings different options to the market.

Maybe lots of Eboarders haven't skated before (me included) and don't know how to use it, good video.

Nevertheless, I don't like or need a kicktail, it just doesn't fit my style ;)

I totally agree with you kick tail.
All of my skateboards electric and non electric have kick tails for sharp cornering and over all you can just do more things with a kick tail, The kick tail may make people think its a design flaw but have they ever tried a kick tail??  I <3 kick tails

Gotta have that tail for the kickflips and boardslides. How the hell am i going to k grind UP a double set on a boosted?

Edit: The raptor isnt pretty to me because of all that awful blue and im concerned about shattering the carbon fiber, but the shape is near perfect from what ive seen online.  I will buy one eventually,  when i can afford to destroy a months salary.

after I built up my tesseract I started to value kicktails more, mostly for jumping down sidewalks or small stairs, but also to get up a few things where I wasnt supersure if my wheels would get up or go fullstop on me. :stuck_out_tongue:

I gotta say though, most things I need my kicktail for are probably things I shouldnt do with fragile DIY batteries and electronics onboard. :innocent:

How does one maneuver at a stand still without a kick tail?
I can't imagine riding a board without one
But I come from a street skating background
I can see people already using longboards used to not having one so it might seem strange

Who gives a shit what they think? They've obviously never skated. Right now, they only have opinions. Which are pretty much worthless until they gain some experience.

Well this is very topical in my world as I am just wrestling with this very question. To kick or not to kick?

I have a great (if not the perfect) top-mount - the Landyatchz Topspeed. My only issue with it is the fact that I am unable to get leverage on the tail for maneuvering at low speeds. 

I am looking at one of the larger Jet decks with the micro kick tail- the hot potato or the Mr Baked Potato (what's up with all these spud names?)

I currently own the Evolve Carbon GT, it performs great but having to literally get off the board, pick it up and move it for sharp cornering feels a little silly when compared to a kicktail. Think I'm gonna have to make a modification of some sort.

I would say my greatest use of the kicktail while commuting through the city is the ability to pop it up when I'm standing at an intersection waiting for a light. It's such a minor thing but that habit is so ingrained in me that if I can't pop it up on stop it feels very strange. It's also safer to have the wheels off the ground while I'm standing at a busy intersection. I always get nervous that I'll throttle accidentally and the board will go flying into traffic.

When I first got a longboard without a kicktail, I found it a bit annoying. While the main two longboards I ride don't have kicktails, I still find it annoying though I've gotten used to it. Since I ride the subway a lot, having a shorter board won out over having a kicktail. I can still use the small bit of overhang to do kick turns, but it's not nearly as easy.

Kick tails all day, at LEAST in the rear. Extra traction, better stance stability, and kicking up when stopped. Who wants to bend down and touch their nasty deck when they gotta stop?

For the extra traction you get from a kicktail, a dropped deck helps, but I also installed a small footstop on my rear trucks. You can really push back against it when turning hard and most of your weight is on your front foot.

The main reason I miss kicktails is going up and down curbs.

I do like the kicktail. I miss that on my last board. It is a functioning part of the board. Muni tracks in SF are far from flush with the street, sometimes you need tight turns, and I like being able to tick tack for fun. Gives me more board feel, even if I'm not going to be popping the tail (cause I don't want to break a $1000+ board unless I have the money to risk, which I don't).

The kick tail is one of the great features of the raptor IMO.

I need a footstep installed for sure, I sawed my top mount board down to a small "drop through" shape but feel like I could sell higher speeds on small boards if I had a place to really dig your feet into the board and get a solid stance. You can still kick up without the kick tail, even with just 13mm of space from the end of the truck to the end of the board, it just takes some practice and wayyy more friction from your shoe. I shredded a hole in my non-push foot in about a month :/

I think more people would be receptive to the raptors kick tail if it were say half the length it is now, I think the tails current length might make the board look a little unbalanced and oblong aesthetically.

Got my footstop from Kreep. The guy who makes these is ultra helpful and custom made me one to my exact specs for around $20. Ended up getting a couple others as well. Not their intended purpose, but they do the job. Haven't shredded any holes in my shoes from kicking up my board, but it does cause additional wear. I usually wear my shoes out from footbreaking before anything else.

biggest issue for me is the enertion blue all over the place, not very fond about that - still waiting for the day when there will be custom anodizing colors. 

the board itself looks really bad in the product pictures because its 100% rendered - in real life that board makes a pretty good impression imo. had my "huh?!" moment when I watched jacobs hub motor video - thought the carbon deck looked really good there.

My Raptor gets compliments CONSTANTLY.  You all can bitch and moan about the Enertion Blue all you want, but others are into the carbon-and-blue look.  It's sort of to the point where I wish folks would just leave me the hell alone as I get where I'm going on this damn widowmaker...

... and yes, I'm a fan of the kicktail, even though i still suck at using it.

To me, the real question is why the fuck major manufacturers don't even offer a kicktail version as a deck option. If I were dropping $1,000+ for a board, not having a kicktail option would be a deal killer for me. Not being able to pop the nose up to go over a crack or uneven pavement, or easily change direction without having to pick up the board seems like a major handicap for getting around town. With that said, I do have a drop deck with no kicktail for my second board, but I run 97mm wheels and ride it mostly in places that I know have smooth pavement.

Fan of kicktail. Not fan of Enertion's board design. It looks really geeky and uncool, IMHO. Way prefer LHBs Scarlet design. It's beautiful.

My favourite deck design has got to be the Landyachtz Tomahawk though. I base my boards that I roll myself on that.

Everyone has their own opinion @onloop. No need to be sarcastic.  For everyone that doesn't like your board 10 others will.  I am always getting  conpliments from others.  I love the deck  and the colour.  Now back to topic.

@makepeace just admit your still dark on Enertion and any chance you can diss you will.  Do it in the hate thread or your own threads not in this one.

Excuse me, but I believe my post was pretty much perfectly on topic. The OP mentioned about how other people think Enertion's board is ugly and I was just adding my opinion, including my opinion on kicktails.

@Dedbny, my post has nothing to do with my run in with Enertion of a couple of weeks back, although I can understand how it appears like that. I was really just expressing my opinion of a deck design on an open forum.

Anyway, done now. Not looking to get in to a fight. Back to the topic.

> Lots of people (idiots) think the Raptor Deck is ugly!

Seems I'm also an idiot on this "_Raptor Design Scale_", even if I really like the kicktail.

No offense here, at least not against any people. Raptor just has its own, unique, natural duck-billed beaver-tailed Australian design, like:

_Remember: even God has a sense of humor. Just look at Platypus._

Everyone should be able to say what they like and dislike. Even about the raptor :wink: Though I must add it would be awesome to add a why, any kind of explanation. There is no reasonable why. You can straight out say it reminds you of a beaver and damn men after seeing this, my unciousness must have added that picture to my picture of the Raptor! Adding a why makes the comment more fun to read, creating a story and maybe allows others to get a good picture of the commenters picture about the product. Dont forget guys, everyone experiences everything differently and maybe we all come to a point where we have a common kind of picture of the raptor, where as we can even give constructive feedback to how we would like it more and why. Still everyone will see and judge it differently. :sunny:

Experienced my first non-kick tail board today. Felt like something was missing because I've never not had a kicktail (on non-powered boards). But hey,  the platform felt really stable for carving. Isn't that obvious though? Maneuvering on and off gutters/ drives/ footpaths/ tricks/ board pick up= kicktail. Carving hard or downhill= less of an attraction, arguably less stable. Personally, I think my own build will have a kicktail for inner city riding. I'm amused how on here you are either 100% right, or you are an idiot. Simple arguments for simple people I guess.  Also think it's amusing you can compare and discuss anything, as long as it's on the party line. A common theme starts to form over repeated threads and eventually people will call bullshit on bias moderation. All threads deviate slightly from the main topic, it's call discussion. This hit me when another thread was suddenly told it can't mention the Raptor only after the board/ brand actually delivered. WTF. Why not? Why not before? Why wouldn't people compare design aspects if they want. Most of us are interested in all the boards/ styles so it's natural. Some people will love a design, some people wont. Diverse views are better than a forum full of sycophants. Maybe this forum can't work out if it's the owners personal business marketing tool or if it's an open e-skate forum. If this was advertised as the Enertion forum, I'd fully understand. But if you want to leverage an 'all brands/ views' forum/ movement, and other third party open discussion platforms like youtube  and reddit to pump a message, it needs to be transparent and consistent or it just isn't convincing to the people who hang around long enough to view more than one thread. It'll undermine and blur the actual natural strengths of the product and the forum. And I'm someone who thinks the Raptor looks awesome and enjoys the vlogs. Yeah I know "thanks for the hot business tips idiot". I'll show myself out of this thread.

## OMG, it's a JOKE!!!!....

try to lighten up a bit fellas....... maybe i'll have to ban myself again.

the entire OP is a parody, written in a comical tone......  its a fictional story written for entertainment.... nobody has ever said this >> _"why don't you make a cool looking deck that looks like all those other ones that all those other cool brands are using to make electric skateboard with"_

I was trying to make fun of all the "hipster boosted boards fanboys"  the people who have never ridden a skateboard until they got a boosted board & now they think that anything that doesn't look like boosted boards must not be a good skateboard - they just don't know why.

Come visit me in Australia sometime and you will eventually understand how Aussie humor works....

My opinion involving kick tail is the same opinion I come to with good features of any other deck: it's functional. To me, any deck that you choose must have all functions that the rider is looking for. My build for example, had a curved deck with no kicktail, because I like flexibility but I don't think that where I live has enough tight corners to warrant a kicktail. However I would also like to bring up features of the raptor in particular. Although it isn't what I used, I do believe that the raptor deck is by far the most functional deck for electric boards when it comes to DIY or market for the following reasons:
1) In-board electronics housing
        1.5) housing doesn't only work with        enertion electronics
2) carbon fiber build = stiff = doesn't damage electronics because it doesn't flex too much
3) handle for simple portability
4) Kicktail for tricks and easy turning on tight corners

And personally, I think that the carbon fiber deck + the beautiful enertion blue looks incredible

Holy Trampa!, I did today some test runs on test-shape for various planned builds, and the kicktail was INCREDIBLE. Never ridden one before, I really didn't think that to be That functional and easy,  altho wheel bite is definitely an issue if you like lower deck height and have big 90mm hub motors or so

I'm really tempted to find a compromise here with the long almost drop-though deck one  
  
The kick-tail tho was... I dunno - didn't work at all, imho
