Hi! 
I have seen a lot of people requesting a STL file for a 63mm motor for the enertion motor mount. I've seen a lot of mounts for the diyelectricskateboards oir tourque boards mounts, but none for the enertion mount. So i decided to design one myself in fusion 360. it's not perfect, but it works great and looks great. Here is the file for it:
