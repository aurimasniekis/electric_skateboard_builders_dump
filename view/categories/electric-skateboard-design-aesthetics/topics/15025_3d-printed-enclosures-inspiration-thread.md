Hey guys,

I've recently started building my first build. It'll be a Vanguard and the thread for it is coming soon. Parts are on the way :) 
So I just got myself an Prusa i3 and I figured. Why not model my own enclosures... I have no vacuum setup and I dont want to mess with molding my enclosures...

Anyone here that printed his own enclosures ? What did you use ? PLA/ABS ? How is it going so far ? I've heard ABS cracks easily... There is also flex PLA filament I might try it.

I've been trying to get some enclosure models done. I'll upload them here and you can make suggestions for improvement. I'll also try to print them when theres time so you can see what the outcome is. I could make some adjustments to the size if you want to. 

Here are my first trys at the battery enclosure for my Vanguard (split enclosures) this is able to fit 6s4p/24Cells.

Model 1:

I guess this will be updated with enclosures once or twice a week :)

**ABS**
It's a strong plastic with mild flexibility. Its strength, flexibility, machinability and higher temperature resistance make it often a preferred choice for mechanical parts.

**PLA**
Also strong, and more rigid than ABS. Yes, it's brittle. It has much lower melting temperature and that makes it ( for example ) unsuitable for keeping in a car during hot days as it can easily droop and deform.

TL;DR: use ABS for enclosers.

By the way, the best option you have is probably a nylon.
It combines the best of the both worlds :)

I've printed some enclosures using PLA because I didn't have ABS at hand.

Your models look sweet! What are the measurements?
Will you put them on thingiverse?

Cheers

After the Busted Board replica I did a few years ago, I am now going for a (WAY most easy one) Evolve Mission Bustin. So I did this one. STL are of course available if someone is interested. 10SP3, 10SP4 will fit easily.

I also did a second version that you can screw below the deck

http://www.e-sk8.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/troncon31.png

of course, this is the last part, now I need to refine it to include charging ports and ON/OFF switches, but the print is on going.

These are also extremely nice and I'm interested in the STL's if you care to share.

Is there an easy way to split them with some kind of joint? My printer bed is only 150x150mm

@IDVert3X thanks ! Thats very helpful :) I dont know yet if my Printer can handle nylon. I've not tried ABS yet since it requires some setup. I'l look into nylon ! 

@rwxr yea sure ! I'll be giving out the stl files after finishing up the designs. The inner fillable space is 220x150x30. Wall thickness is set to 4mm. How did your pla enclosures hold up ? 

@unikboards those are sweet ! Is that ABS ? Did you do refinements after printing ? Like aceton and stuff.. 
I'll come up with a cool subtle logo which I can put on mine too :) 

My printer does 210x200x200mm so I'll have to split bigger enclosures in 2. Connecting them shouldnt be that hard.

Original Průša i3 can print nylon.

Some of the cheap-ass chinese i3 clones ( which are far away from beign "clones" quality wise ) can do that as well, but most of them can't. Nylon requires quite high temperatures ( 240C+ ).

Ah allright. I've got the Anet A8 :/ not fine tuned yet. 
I'll probably go with PLA for the ease of use and reinforce it with carbon fiber or sth.

@TranxFu: Thanks! I've not tried my enclosures in the wild because the weather doesn't allow skating at the moment.
@SimosMCmuffin helped me split some enclosures from thingiverse and added a connection ledge in another thread.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/help-needed-with-splitting-a-3d-printed-enclosure-from-thingiverse/14667
The word on the street is that ABS can be joined using acetone, but since mine are PLA I haven't tried it.

Doesn't really make sense to use PLA when reinforced with CF.
You can use it as a mold tho.

Most likely not the final design, but here's where I'm heading. It's going to be attach with only two screws so that the deck can still flex. 

I have some crazy high spacers on my trucks so clearance is still good.

I like that one. Looks so clean :open_mouth: !

I really dig the 3D Printed way because it offers a lot more room to play with. And go for a more industrial design. I'd prefer sth. like this over rectangle boxes any time ! :) 

Heres a more developed enclosure I worked on today. It has an output for the battery cables and it is also slighty curved to fit the vanguard concave.

I'll start printing once I have made my choice and finished up designs for both the VESC and battery enclosure. Expect some real-life pics in january.

I've looked into G2TB mods and mby I'll try to do sth. in that direction too

I'll need to make the edges of the enclosure more curvy so it can sit closer to the trucks

I think I'm done with my battery enclosure. I took some inspiration from the boosted board. 

This is for a flex board and works in a split enclosure setup. This will fit 6s4p while the other will fit 4s4p + VESC, Electronics,... . 
The top is flat so it will be easier to print on a 3 printer. I also split the model in 2 since it exceeds the general 200mm bed volume.

i recently just tried to design[ my own covers](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2252464) but they are not half as good as the stuff here. are you willing to share the STL's?

btw, i used PETG for my covers (motor mount and pulleys as well) and so far it works pretty well.

 Like your design @okp, see you did take the concave into account. I hope I can form mine or putt some weather strip underneath. And the screw holes are really nice, takes less space. I did them 'old school'. 
And yours can be printed without support, I am now printing with a massive support in the middle, think I'll print the other ones the other way around, will save allot of time and filament.

So my first enclosures were fully 3d printed. they took 10+ hours to print. didn't look as nice as I wanted, and eventually broke.

A few iterations later, I came up with these!
the prints are only used for the endcaps on aluminum sheet bent into boxes.
These caps are easy to design, and only take 1-2 hours to print!

embedded the same m3 insert rivets I use for mounting to hold the sheet together!
then bend some 1/2 x 1/8 alu flat bar ($3) into mounting brackets!

The down side you need to insulate the inside. the up side they bend/dent but won't break!

I used vector images. You can load them into Fusion 360 and do an extrude into the top. Like you did with the letters.

I did a small redesign to be able to print it with the top down. I removed the chamfer and added rounded corners only to the side edges (the ones that go from the bottom all the way up). Cause when I printed it with the top down the concave got ugly (might have been the PLA tho).

Before I printed the box I first tested the edge a few times to get as close to the concave of the board before wasting filament and time.

Good luck printing!

Will do some small edits on this version, like moving the holes for the motor wires down to the board to keep them more low profile, they're sticking out right now.

Can someone share their STL files? I am in need of an enclosure for my modified Koowheel. Need a battery housing, the dimension of the pack is 4.2cm thick, 11cm wide and 32cm long. Seems like okp's design might work. I have no idea how to model something in 3D.

For easy 3d modeling, try Tinkercad. Simple tools, but very easy to learn.

Hey man, sounds great. I'll definitely check it out when you're finished with it. I can wait  but sooner better than later, I took apart 2 battery packs from the board to combine them into one and put them inside an enclosure so I'm out of riding until I can find one. Have heard of tinkercad, will check it out as well.

I'll try, I haven't had much time in the last week. 
My battery is a 10s5p so it's about 45cm long, 14 wide and 3.5 tall. My enclosure will be about 60cm long so I can fit a pair of FOCboxes and some other stuff in there too.
Do you have a 3d printer? Keep in mind that you'll likely need to make the enclosure in two or three parts, so you can fit it on the printer bed.

Yep I have a 3D printer with a standard 20cm x 20cm print bed and this would be the largest part I'll be printing out so far so I'll be having to learn how to slice it in parts. I have been using Simplify3D and it seems to make the slicing easy enough to do. Now I need to start measuring everything so that's probably why I need to start using tinkercad or Fusion360 to make modifications if needed.

Personally I prefer to make a few parts rather than trying to slice half of the model.
I've heard of Simplify3d, never used it though. I use Slic3r for printer settings and Repetier-host for the actual slicing and printing (the programs can talk to each other).
I use Solidworks for design work, Tinkercad and Onshape if I'm away from my computer.

Ziro3D TPU on amazon is pretty much the same price as hatchbox PLA. Battery clearance I've had no issues, I'm not sure if I'll share the battery case design just because of how specific it is, most people want "skinny" battery packs and such. The wheels I'm planning on releasing and making an etsy listing for a few of them once I ace the design, I've got some degradation on the V1 treads that might be a deal breaker for most, could indicate a concept-level issue, could just be a simple fix, will know more over the winter.

Not everyone is of this train of thought.
Many people fit their stuff into enclosures and bolt it to their board. Some manufacturers also follow this approach. 
A 3d printed enclosure though might not be the best option if you go this way.

For sure. The issue I have (had?) was being able to modify it to fit my battery pack. I think I got it down though. My board curves, and I can't figure out how to modify the enclosure properly to curve, so I'll probably just add a little extra insulation around the ends to make up for it. I'll give it a shot. In the end I would love to have a perfect model for the type of board I have but that will need to wait.

HI! ABS would be fine, I just found PETG easier to print on large model. It also more flexible which is importatant too. I went for PETG, 3 mm walls but I would say 4mm is better. I attached all the hardwares to the board otherwise the printed enclosure will go through hard time. My enclosure held up pretty well for one month and a half then it started to crack down in the points were I had some problems with the nozzle during printing and were the hardware was pushing from the inside (i made the model a bit undersize). So basically it would be fine, I just made some mistakes along the process. Then last weekend I finished my first fiberglass enclosure and I used my printed one as mold. Way more stronger than the printed one, but heavier so it is not a bad idea choose to reinforce the 3d printed enclosure with fiberglass. You have mainly 2 options: keep the 3d one outside or inside. If you choose to laminate the fiberglass inside, than keep in mind that you are going to loose room for your parts, so printed overall 4-5mm bigger. If you choose to wrap it with fiberglass outside than the regular size should be fine. For mine I used a vacuum bag (the one for storing clothes), as @ninja suggested with the Ghetto Vacuum. The vacuum bag will help for a better final look, although if you add fiberglass inside you can probably go without since even if the surface is not perfect you are not gonna see it. I would reccmmend to use it anyway, it's easy and helps a lot. For the type of fiber glass you can go for the matt one, cheaper and easier to laminate and remove air bubbles (important step if you want a strong structure). The lighter matt the easier to laminate but on the other side the more layers you will need. I used 260g/m2 matt fiber glass and I used almost 500g/m2, probably way too much, it's a rock! a heavy rock :laughing: Something like 7-8 layers. I would suggest to go for 350-400g/m2 so you will need to laminate 4 layers to be fine or even less if you just want reinforce your 3d printed enclosure.
You could also use the 3d one as mold and since you are doing the process anyway, you will get a stronger enclosure with your personalized shape that you like the most. I hope it helps!

If you want the fiberglas outside, for a great smooth final look I would suggest oto buy also an epoxy gel coat. basically after yuou finish you can apply it and it will cover all the small imperfection and holes in order to have a smooth urface, than you sand it down gradually, for instance from 200, than 400, 800, 1200 wet sanding and you will ger a perfect finish. You can see my Spud build. Unfortunatelly I didn't have it the gel coat so the surface is not perfect, it's smooth because I lost the use of my arm for sanding it, but to cover the holes the filler I used during the painting was not enought.

Just checked out your build, I'm doing something similar! I have a jet Spud deck (the gray one), the problem is my battery is 10s5p...

The second board is 36" so I might try that one instead, but I think I'll still need to put the vescs on top. And before anyone asks, the reason for the battery is a tight budget, so I'm repurposing my previous (first) build.

I've started printing a case for my Trampa HS11 build. Unfortunately eboosteds enclosure would be too small for the BMS and ESC combination I want to use.
So my plan is to print them, tidy them up and mold the enclosure to then produce masters in fibreglass.

If you print correctly you can skip the composite on top, mine have been fine for 300km of bad roads and lots of vibrations 

The main tip is print hot, more than you usually set to, this makes the layers have a better adhesion, the surface may look bad, but you can sand afterwards

How is the battery configuration? Double stack I guess. I used a 10s3p with a huge BMS. That why I had to make my own enclosure. I see other spud builds with 10s4p as double stack. I see this morning a guy on reddit that used the diyeboard dual belt 10s5p kit and it's tick but doable. For sure with a longer deck you can use a thinner enclosure because the space is limited under the spud. If your board would be a commute one, than Spud for life.

Yeah, it's double stacked but still works out to 46 cm in length. I can just fit it under the Spud, but nothing else. 
Totally agree with using the Spud deck if I can, I'm doing one like unik's with the trampa trucks and tires.
I know psychotiller makes a one or two enclosures that would work for me, but since I have a printer anyway I thought maybe I'd try this myself.

Ah ok cool now I got it. then if you are going to use such big tires, double stack won't be a problem. For the enclosure if you are going to use it offroad you better use fiberglass outside to protect the board from rocks. IN this case I would suggest you design the enclosure as you like it, then print it with out edges so you can use it as mold for the fiberglass one. It will fit perfectly the board concavity. I mean you are going to do laminate anyway. I do not know how much is gonna cost for you fiberglass + resin (epoxy or polyester) + roller + brushes + gelcoat ecc... because othersiwe can be a cheaper solution go for a pre-cast enclosure. Of course id you want to do it diy, I agree that it's really a nice experience.

I think I printed using 235 or 240, usually I use 225 for better surface finish, but this vary from filament to filament

The best you can do is get an enclosure for the printer, large ABS parts will deform in a open printer, I spent a lot of time with a hair drier deforming back after printing and needed a lot of sanding to get it usable![IMG_3368|690x388](upload://rTbMwCMkYanmDtRd3LbVg5QDU84.JPG)![IMG_3360|666x500](upload://b4KvIAHsjZU3XlPcYoGyUJnMzdp.JPG)![IMG_3126|666x500](upload://qnX7xNue3NlKEbeZ6q6YfyG0yKs.JPG)

That was the first thing I upgraded for my printer. All set on that front :slight_smile:
 Since I'm planning for my components to sit in the enclosure I should probably make it thicker, maybe 4 or 5 mm. Of course, then weight starts to add up, even before the fiberglass.
@rey8801 that's the big question , I'll have to check total cost. I also don't want to have to spend too much time on this, I want to get back out there...😉

IF you want to sit your component in the enclosure than the 3d printed one is gonna be a challenge. I would advice at least the battery to be fixed to the deck. I used strong velcro and it does the job. Regarding the time...You will spend a lot of time, that's for sure. Then I will say even if you have to add 10-20$ for a pre-made enclosure, go for it because it's worth the time saving. With the 3d printed you can still do a lot. I designed and printed my raiser to perfectly fit the spud deck and to host a shock pad. You can print mod enclosure for the remote, xt90/60 port, vesc enclosure ecc...

If you plan to put fiberglass in it you can keep it thin, mine is 2.4mm and already weight 300g
You have to plan carefully the mounting point, make space for a washer between the screw and the plastic. I made the mounting role as small as possible to fit just the head of the screw so I can’t really put too much torque os the screw

Okay, new plan, courtesy of my overactive brain at 1:00 am.
I found some aluminum frames meant for plasterboard (otherwise known as drywall I think), which I can cut into strips and bend to make a sort of ribcage which will be bolted to the deck. The battery will rest inside this like so:
![IMG_20180601_130507|375x500](upload://ra1Oo2d5OPfO0BBbjJwCr7CWhXi.jpg)
I haven't made the bends yet, just started cutting.
I can print enclosure sections which will attach to the metal frame and thus they won't take the full weight of the battery.

my speed controller case is has lost its screw mounts, it delaminated because of a small mismatch in the concave and flex of the board. one day i found it dangling on just a few strands of PLA and the cables :open_mouth:, currently it is held in place with a strip of aluminium that stretches over the the width of the assembly and a few long screws, it is now some kind of hybrid case. although my battery case holds up strong, i think PLA is just not the most durable way of creating skateboard parts

There are some very small cracks along the lines of the print. Since I printed with abs I'm thinking of soaking a thin rag with acetone and laying it over the piece for a few minutes and then brushing it to fill in the gaps. Has anyone ever tried something like this?

I haven't actually tried it myself, but I have seen great success from other people. I'm fairly certain this works with almost all filaments, not just abs. It might have troubles with slippery and/or flexible stuff like nylon though.

I think this would be a great way to join enclosures together as well, not just for fixing cracks!

Another way is acetone or MEK in case your ABS is more resistant to chemical (ABS MG94 for example)

Take all that scrap (supports, brims and etc), dissolve it in a paste and use it to glue, since the solvent completely evaporates you joint has the same resistance of the material, actually even better since it fuse all layers together

I don’t know exactly, I keep adding ABS until it’s thick, not no so much that you can’t work with 

If your parts are fitting really well you can try without making the paste, just put put MEK of both sides of the joint with a brush and press them together. I made the paste because I had some big gaps to fill

I recently did a few printed enclosures on my flexi board and used PLA.  To strengthen the parts I did 3 coats of XTC-3D which worked quite well.  I then did a light sand and sprayed with plasti-dip for a rubbery coating.

The plasti dip has started to chip/peel away from stones getting flicked up so i may rethink that but the enclosures have no dings or cracks in them.

Because of laziness.  It was the right size one way for the fsesc 4.2 but ended up with the fins the wrong way.

In the end i could have gone without it as it barely hits 32c on a 20c day.  might get a touch warmer on a 40c day but i doubt i'll be riding on a day like that as i would rather be standing in front of the AC.
