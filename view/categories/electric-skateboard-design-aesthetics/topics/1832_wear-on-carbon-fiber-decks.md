For those who have had carbon fiber decks for a while (especially the enertion deck), how do they wear?  I'm thinking of getting a carbon fiber deck with a kick tail and was wondering if the tail would wear out any more or less than a wood board.  My wooden deck tail is pretty worn after 2 yrs of riding.  Also, is there a health risk with the composite dust that would be generated?

I was thinking I should just get one of those old school tail skids to protect the deck.

Yep, go get the bumper guard. There are plenty cheap diy to make guard, such as using rubber hose cut into half and hot glued.

I don't have one but I wouldn't slide the tail on the ground without protection. I was going to use "ultra high molecular weight polyethylene" (slippery plastic) on the carbon deck I was making (that project is on hold). A lot of downhill longboarders use that for hand slider pucks. Should last a while and be good protection. You can pick all kinds of sizes up on Amazon.

I have bought a complete raptor and it comes incl. tail guard.
I'm riding mine since the release (maybe six-eight weeks) hard and it got some scratches.
Nothing major and the quality seem to be very good. Only downside is the loud noise of a cf deck on rough street.

Just been riding my Raptor a week, but so far it's surprisingly tough. Accidentally full throttled the board into a brick wall from 3-4 feet away while grabbing cash at an atm (note to self: turn off remote before fumbling through pockets). I was prepared for a sizable dent, but only damage was a small scratch on nose. 

As Tarzan mentioned, it will be a bit louder than traditional board. I added thin weather striping around enclosure lid and under space cell and that reduced the noise quite a bit.

The biggest risk of damage is to the nose &/or tail, as mentioned above I already include tail guard to protect the road-side from slides, but if in future I get an alarming amount of complaints (zero so far) from people damaging the nose I might include some kind of ugly thingy to protect it... since the question has been raised maybe i will just do it anyway.

The cool thing is you can actually do repair jobs fairly easily. This video explains the steps fairly concisely.
