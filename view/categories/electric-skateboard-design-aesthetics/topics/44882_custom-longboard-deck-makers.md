Thanks - I actually spoke with him already. But I‚Äôm looking for something very specific that he is not yet geared up to do (he said he should be in a few months). 

I‚Äôm basically looking for this except 43/44‚Äù long (big enough to fit a 33‚Äù enclosure)

Nah joking, it's 38", I thought I'd let you know since it's pretty much what you posted.

12s6p (I want unlimited range)

The battery is 25.5‚Äù long, so a 33‚Äù enclosure from @Eboosted would have 31‚Äù of internal space, leaving 5.5‚Äù for vescs/wires. Then I figured 5 or 6‚Äù for drop through mounted trucks on each end. So basically a 43-45‚Äù board total

@lennylogs I have a board that is around 40 ish I would have to measure it specifically I actually just got mine in for my board. They are 100% American Hard Rock Maple.   They are 7plys 

Here is a link to my page that has some of the boards I have done I haven‚Äôt fully updated it because I just got in a few new decks in the other day.

May I ask what for? Like what good does it bring to be able to ride your board more than a day without charging it?

That‚Äôs a good question. I guess the short answer is because it‚Äôs possible. 

These boards are already expensive, so why no spend an extra hundred dollars and put a huge battery in it. The boards are already pretty long, so why not make it a few inches longer if it means you won‚Äôt have to ever worry about running out of juice. 

Some days I will take my motorcycle out with no destination in mind and just ride because there are gas stations everywhere. It would be cool to do the same on an electric skateboard!

Lengths I‚Äôm not sure about but you can always hit them up. They also do custom grip tape and will color the deck. This is what I ended up doing ![image|375x500](upload://ahD5ExK8hmNhEkTT0sMo0GJmNFn.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://lhsfi7IXRnwWfXDVKeqWfH8KBWC.jpeg)

Custom longboards made in Belmar - that‚Äôs awesome! I lived in Point Pleasant Beach for a little while. 

Could you make something like what I am looking for?

+1 

I am seeking a maker for (3) examples of a deck I designed years ago (wide cruiser, mellow concave, kicktail) if anyone may have a referral (Silicon Valley). Thanks!

I have the decks made for me. The board I have has a size of 10 wide x 40.5 with a wheel base of 31.5. It will be hard to find one with the size you're looking for.

What I have in mind is the "carrying" part. You see, the motorcycle always stays on the ground whereas the longboard will sometimes go in your hands and you won't enjoy carrying it. I got 10s2p and 10s3p boards which get annoying to carry after 5 minutes or so. So unless you are wanting to simply cruise around for 6+ hours and not use it for any means of transportation, I feel like it's not such a great idea because only your battery will weight around 3.5kg.

Anyways, don't want to stop your dreams. Good luck!

maybe just bring a power supply you can plug in at a coffee shop.  I wonder what the smallest you could find that could do 5 amps

Maybe try [Honey Badger Decks](https://www.honeybadgerdecks.com/custom-longboards)?

Not too sure if they will do custom decks, too many site calling custom is really nothing more than just colours and grip tape art...

Thanks I will check them out. 

And I know! There are a ton of places that will screen print on the bottom of the deck, which I guess is technically still custom, but it makes it a lot harder to find the real custom guys

No you can have unlimited range battery in your backpack and take it when needed, and have 12s4p on the deck for the rest of the time

Am running 12s6p 30q on the landyatch evo or have yet to  put it on but it will fit, if your concern is its going to take up a lot of space, its custom made so it should he shorter. Any 39-40 deck should be fine

Its custom made by chi boards @barajabali 
This is what he quoted me for 
"Dimensions would be 360mm x 132mm x 36
That work?
Or I can make it 330mmx 132mmx 48mm"
I think he doesn't use battery blocks or what Ever there called to make it easy to solder them.

He‚Äôs gonna be making mine as well lol. 

But I want to go for a slimmer profile battery for this board. You know......for aerodynamics... :slight_smile: 

Also, isn‚Äôt the land yacht evo‚Äôs wheelbase lowered like an inch or so? Are you worried about putting a thicker battery under a wheelbase that is already extra low to the ground? Maybe with extra big wheels it would be fine?
