How do you mount your XT-90s to your enclosure??
I have seen the mounts that will do it horizontally and some nifty 3d printed ones but would be interested in seeing how everyone does it.
Pictures would be great!
Thanks

I think most people panel mount, 3d print, or glue.

You also get a mounting part by Hobbyking  for XT90 !

I use those hobby king mounts on 1.5mm g10, works great for my loop key.

Could you also just use some abs cement to attach it to the enclosure?

I found this file on thingverse for a xt90 mount and got four 3d printed via a uk online print service https://www.3dhubs.com/ and sent through the post. 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2016540

Problem is none of my Xt90 connectors (yellow and black ordered from hobby king) will  fit in the print as its slightly to small.  This is my first experience of getting something 3d printed where it has to be an exact size to fit another part.   Is it possible the original STL file is sized just right for the originators printer or is it the fault of the 3d printer service, should I ask for a refund. Do you normally have to print a few attempts  resizing each time to get something like this to work for each individual printer.

Shave it with a file or something to get your connector to fit

So I should be able to send this to a reputable 3d printing service and it should it should come back and fit my xt90 exactly without any filing or sanding.  Sorry I'm  new to this 3d printing lark.

Yep.  It even has 2 really small holes that you can put a drop of super glue in to make sure they don't move.

Thanks I've give it another go.

Was it these aluminium mounts you were thinking of.  I think thease are ok if you want the plug to protrude from the enclosure but not flush mounted which is what I'm after.

As150 instead of an xt90

```
How did you fix the As150 inside the enclosure did you just epoxy it.  I've been thinking of how I can panel mount a 5.5 bullet connector out of my battery enclosure to get at the mid point in a series connection for charging.  
My battery enclosure for 2x5S in series is that tight I've not been able to wire any proper parallel connectors for charging so I've T'ed-off the middle connection point with a 5.5mm bullet connect.
I've got this idea of making two charging cable's for each battery each using a xt-90 but with only one connector to either the - or the + and then the other connection going to the 5.5mm bullet to pick up either the + or - of the cell depending on if I'm charging battery A or B.

Since my enclosure is made of Kydex, I had some scraps laying around. I cut a hole the exact shape of the XT90 in the enclosure using a drill for roughing and an exacto knife for the finishing, then I made a "U" shape out of scrap kydex and glued it down over the XT90 plug to keep it from moving, while keeping it lined up to the hole. Not completely waterproof, but a good enough seal to keep the rocks out at least.

And Yes, I do realize that mounting the side of the XT90 with the resistor in it (the part with the female sockets) inside the enclosure will be a huge pain if I ever fry said resistor. It would be better to mount the "male" portion in the enclosure, that way if you ever fry the resistor, you can just replace the key.

I didn't want to open a new thread for it. I am going to use one of the 3D print XT90 mount but I notice that the XT90 is really hard to pull it out and I am afraid I will brake the enclosure in that point over the time. Hence I was wondering whether you sand it a bit (male side) to still have a nice grip with the female part meanwhile applying less stress on the enclosure.

```
From what I can tell, the majority of the friction plugging and unplugging the XT90s comes from the fit of the actual copper bullets into the sockets of the other half, rather than friction between the nylon housings. You don't want to reduce this friction, because that's what ensures good electrical contact.

That for sure. But If I can remove a bit of it by sanding the plastic part maybe it can help. I understand the tight fit but you need ti pull a lot to unplug it, at least in mine

after a light shot of sandpaper fine grain on the xt90 keyloops it goes nickel ... and that it forces a little is not worse to avoid any unintentional disconnection of thevibrations on rugged terrain ... IMO

Thats the only reason that can push me to buy an antispark switch. They are nice but not worth it the price to me.

I drilled a hole and super glued it. As150 have plastic housings that screw the bullets, you could use the non-antispark version with housing for your mid point..

I can print simple stuff in petg if that helps. 
I have black loaded now. 
Iâ€™ll track the file down and see how they come out.

no one's mentioned yet but i use sugru to mount all my ports.  not as clean as 3d printed brackets but...don't need a 3d printer either.

sorry, don't have photos.

@mmaner thanks for the reply, also thank you @bigben though im kinda thinking wouldn't i need ABS over petg? as il be using a XT90AS power to esc's cable rather than a loop key on a power cable so it needs to be able to take repeated use (pulls and pushes) .... :thinking:

@thisguyhere il be using sugru to dampen cable vibration and waterproof the said XT90 housing, hopefully :smiley:

Edit i have seen the one on hobbyking i may just cut that one down to size but thought ide ask about it on here first.

zero issues.

it's "rubber" so it's pretty compliant.  and it kind of binds to whatever it's put on.

only thing is it's unnecessary expensive and it's got a shelf life.  i just used the last two remaining packs that were "expired" and it was noticeable grainy and kind of lumpy looking.

but now that it's cured it seems to be the same consistency.

Thanks for the info. I'm going to give this a try on my board as I'm not overly happy with my current method. I never would have considered using SuGru, so thank you.
