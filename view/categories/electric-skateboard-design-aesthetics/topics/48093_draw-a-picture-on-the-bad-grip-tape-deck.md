There should be a grip tape on the whole deck, but only one of the decks was shipped in that shape.

So I decided to draw a picture. :thinking:

The first art knife on the grip tape was broken at the moment it was cut.
So I worked with a cutter knife :weary:

The total working time was 2 hours and 30 minutes.

That's so creative! Turned out great! Your lighting setup also looks awesome. Are the back lights integrated into the belt covers? They look really sweet! How can I get my hands on some? I assume the front ones are Shred lights?

144 neo-pixels on the motor cover.

The front light is a 12-volt daylight mounted on the vehicle. I made a cover with a 3D printer.![20160323_234056|666x500](upload://fRCy6Dgpu1GJk64P6pfUh7MLB4L.jpg)![20160323_234113|666x500](upload://tRnbQR0bkMj9YaVkZdBTiZXcNTl.jpg)![Screenshot_20180304-142416|690x316](upload://ntHGjf7obQlY0aEIUisoMFyk7BP.jpg)

Sweet! Any chance you could do a write-up on how to mount and control those rear lights? What do you use for the animation and blinking? Do you need special belt cover 3D print files? Thanks!

Hey those are the exact lights that I am using for my board.  Glad to see they are nice and bright!  Are you running them at the full 12V 0.5A

Here's the link!  They were incredibly cheap but the outside is aluminum, and the threads and everything seems pretty high quality to me.

It is the front. It feels like a bigger wheel.
