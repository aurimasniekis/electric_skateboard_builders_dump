This is, in my opinion, the cleanest way to mount an enclosure without having to drill all the way through your deck. I'm putting this up as a Go to/How to for anyone that doesn't want to use wood screws or "skate type" hardware on their builds.

For this install you will need:
m4 x 16 cap socket screws
![image|225x225](upload://3KPOD314Cy9gS5z7x5KY7JOS6v4.jpg)
M4 plastic flat washers
![image|500x500](upload://b0egPOTkPhmA0M38cAQFS2B6GE.jpg)
M4 threaded inserts
![image|159x134](upload://4IQ2qEZhEPI62I0DqrNGlLdUkPB.jpg)
an M4 Drill bit, A 1/4" drill bit, and deep well socket and a T-handle Wrench or good long M4 allen wrench.

1) Line up your Enclosure on your deck. Eyeball it for awhile to make sure it is equally spaced how you want. ![IMAG0065|282x500](upload://vfwD0ryVXV5PxPg6Gwo3Cqo9lC1.jpg)
2) Use some blue tape to mark the edge of the enclosure on the deck. This way if the enclosure moves, you can easily line it up again.
3) Take your enclosure off of the deck (or half of it if its a 2 piece) and drill the first 2 mount holes in it. I usually start on the front corners. I use an m4 or m4.5 bit.![IMAG0066|282x500](upload://wgYyLWrzpBF0Csu25ByXL2sCEen.jpg)!
4) Put the enclosure back on the deck, lined up with the tape markers, Using the same drill bit, mark the holes into your deck. -DO NOT drill all the way through! Take the enclosure off the deck for the next step. ![IMAG0067|282x500](upload://6BCjilwZjWZZDx33kPdrxXegC2l.jpg)
5) Now you need to switch your drill bit out to a 1/4" bit. -Here's a slight detail to pay attention to-  Find a small, deep well socket that fits over the drill bit. When you chuck the drill bit into your drill, leave about 1/2" of the drill bit sticking out of the socket. Should be barely longer than the m4 brass insert and not longer than the thickness of the deck. You can hold the socket while you drill the marked holes on your deck. When the socket touches the deck, the hole is deep enough to screw the insert into the deck.![IMAG0068|689x390](upload://83N0Nx9Gp9RjqVDtGRmYXH923XE.jpg)![IMAG0069|689x390](upload://3Y2VeHuNFWluALlosvY2wDAs1hI.jpg)![IMAG0071|689x390](upload://dpVCbnfnNPKwd469gczXk8mQbXE.jpg)
6)Don't use a flat head to install the insert. You're going to put the insert in upside down because it will look cleaner.![IMAG0072|689x390](upload://mlDp7UiPwzOcrYg0Y0GoaO1Et2N.jpg)
Take a short M4 cap socket screw (M4 x 8) and screw it into the unslotted end of the insert. Then use a T-handle M4 wrench to screw the insert into the deck. Then, back the screw out of the insert. Repeat.![IMAG0073|282x500](upload://xDQyha63JXYEgFBZAtRPV4B5Yxr.jpg)
7) screw the enclosure down to the deck, switch back to the m4 drill bit and mark a couple more holes. You can now, drill through the enclosure and into the deck. -Do not drill all the way through the deck!!![IMAG0077|689x390](upload://94J4hyxIYouK5X1EXsTsMZCKJgV.jpg)
8) Take off the enclosure, and repeat steps (5 thru 7)![IMAG0074|689x390](upload://6GICyrNiUjDBbi1bTECrPZGnrcZ.jpg)![IMAG0075|689x390](upload://xMhjKUxH5lIOLHqAhTyjskZmGs1.jpg)![IMAG0076|689x390](upload://p5loOWronmGo3jaJh46OfldCCIK.jpg)![IMAG0081|689x390](upload://ummJZbc9FeR8Dz53WKD8dPzIMpc.jpg)![IMAG0080|282x500](upload://sFgrWlj1SJFNaWyrii1mWCwEEA2.jpg)![IMAG0082|689x390](upload://A0FgHeCD2Fha0YHgq1OTkK6mZBA.jpg)![IMAG0083|689x390](upload://tU5Evk6H5UESNM06g5PfK0aoWGV.jpg)

Your inserts look a little different to mine (metal vs wood perhaps), but the slots in mine are intended to help the thread cut in and not intended to be used for a flathead screwdriver. So the way you've put them in isn't necessarily upside down.
![IMG_1842|640x480](upload://zI1W7QCuCiEUCCKmZD5owj1hWb2.png)

Sometimes you'll find the insert backs out with the screw you've used to insert it in[1]. A solution to this is to use a longer screw with two nuts threaded on. Tighten the two nuts together, then screw the insert on. Screw the insert into the board, and using two spanners untighten the two nuts. The screw should then come out with very easily and not take the insert with it. This is all YouTube BTW, I can't take credit for this ;-)
![IMG_1844|375x500](upload://49IMJ15QaQueP5U21T3xGYoM9HP.png)

[1] I used an epoxy glue when installing the inserts to ensure they never came out, somewhat ironically I believe the glue served as a lubricant which meant the inserts often unscrewed when I was trying to get the installation screw out.

I’ve used meta washers in the past and they all rattle out eventually. I have enough holes in the enclosure that I just replace them after they fall out. I’ll definitely be giving the plastic washer a try. 

Thanks for the write up! Always nice to see a detailed guide

Nice write up and tutorial!

I would like to add that the slot in the inserts is not for going in with screwdrivers. As @lock mentioned, it's the location where the thread cuts in. The slot is there, so after installation, your installed screw pushes  the edges a bit out at the bottom of the insert, so the whole thing secures even better in the wood.

And in case you mess up, or want to be sure, it helps to put a little loctite on the outside while scewing them in. Depends in what you're screwing though.

One thing that I have found is that the threaded inserts will case cracking on the board because it is hardwood.  

I guessing that you should use the next drill bit up from what it says on the packaging for recommend drill.

I used 8-32 because they insert were sold in the bigger packs and I was able to get the socket heads local for that size.

The threads are supposed to be facing up however after talk to people who use them in furniture. They also have have a tendency to go
crooked.

I used weather stripping from home depot on the board you can also do it on the enclosure.  Home depot sells a brand called frost king.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask but how many times can you drill through the deck without compromising its integrity?

I’m buying a slightly used Loaded tesseract but its already been used with a @psychotiller mount so it’s been drilled through once. I won’t likely be using the same enclosure as it  won’t fit the 10s6p battery I’ve ordered very well. So I’m looking to grab a bigger enclosure from @bigben

My question is since the bigger enclosure will not align with the current drilled holes on the deck(at least not the ones length-wise) I expect to have to drill in new ones but I’m worried I could damage the board or crack it in some way to make it unsafe for use. What do you guys think?

I think it takes a lot of holes before you should be worried about structural integrity. 

Will the holes line up width-wise? If so, just drill corresponding holes in the new enclosure. Bigben recently made me an enclosure with extra lip to fit pre-drilled holes.

And if you haven't bought your tesseract yet, Ben has his sweet color matched enclosure+tesseract for sale.

I do indeed like the set he’s selling but only thing putting me off about it is that its the trucated version and not the full one cause I wanted to practice dancing on it(only trick I’ll ever do on an eboard lol) I could post photos of the enclosures if that may help. I’d love to use @psychotiller’s enclosure but it’s going to be very tight

It'll also set almost instantly as opposed to waiting for epoxy to cure. Put a piece of tape on one side of the hole and then layer it in there. 

Edit: You can always sand it down if you over fill

How is it an added step there are actually less steps involved. You don't need to use a spacer or socket to drill the holes you can mount your enclosure and drill right through the deck and enclosure to get perfect mounting points.

Like I said it isnt less steps if you are not using the inserts.  Doing it with inserts like @psychotiller states here makes lit look clean and professional.  If you have holes through your deck and no bolt going all the way through you will have a gap and you will end up showing the outline of the hole as it gets pushed into the holes over time. atleast if you are going to drill through the deck and use inserts cover the other end with a mixture of sawdust and wood glue or epoxy.

even if you don't use inserts. Don't be lazy! I mention the steps because that is how you are going to get your enclosure straight. Also, it's how your are going to get your enclosure to conform to the shape of a concave deck. 
I get 5 messages a day from people telling me my enclosure doesn't fit on their deck. Because "their" evo is different than the 100 I've installed enclosures on right? WRONG.

They just drilled a bunch of holes all willy nilly and assumed they would get the same results I get, but instead ended up with a build that looks like shit.

You get out, what you put in.

You lucked out, because that deck is fairly flat. But there's no way you are going to use 6 screws (or inserts) to put an enclosure down clean on an evo deck.

Yesss after a month my deck inserts finally came in, I went a little over kill and went with a M5 set up instead of the more common M4 I just wanted to over do it. I also purchased varous length screws cause I wasn't sure what length I'll need but I think it's gonna come out sweet.

So Im finally at the point of installing my enclosure I was wondering if I should go 4 or 5 screws each side.
I'm leaning toward 5 each side since it's gonna have a pretty heavy battery. 

I'm glad the m5 hardware fits perfect on the lip of the enclosure. 
Edit: I didn't take Dave's @psychotiller advise on how to mount as you can see from the pics lol

I used inserts but they ended up popping out of the wood deck then I drilled through completely and went with T nuts.  The T nuts are a bit unsightly. I would like to hear from others on what provided a secure hold and good aesthetics.

Question for you guys who epoxy threaded inserts into the board:

How do you stop the epoxy for coming back up into the the threaded insert before it dries? Is it an issue I should be concerned about?

Not saying that this has happened to me yet, but I'm worried that it could and I'm careful not to put too much on the outside in case it does.

I still wonder which end you insert first? I always thought the sloted end was to for the screw driver, until a while ago a forum member told me  is the other way around, the slot is intruduced first and act as the insert shaving mechanism into the wood hole as you screw.

Then, this week some one posted a video in Instagram in which the guy was introducing the insert the other way, with the flat end first (??) So, which end goes first?

The slot is the 'self-tapping' part of the insert.  Its not for a flat head screw driver.  Use a bolt and nut of the same size, in the insert to mount it.

@pixelsilva Some threaded inserts have self tapping barbs that will go on the bottom so I think that's where a lot of confusion comes from (like drywall anchors). The slot on the thread is meant to be used with a specific manufacturer drill bit that will drive the insert without marring any surrounding wood. Most people just use a flathead screwdriver but make sure the head is **NO WIDER** than the insert itself. You can also use a hex head bolt that is meant to fit that specific thread pattern, tighten it into the insert, and then insert the insert/bolt combo into your hole and ratchet it tight. 

Just a tip of general info that will serve anybody well: when picking a drill bit to fit a screw, the diameter of the drill bit should be equal to or **barely** smaller than the diameter of the screw's shaft (if you stripped all the threads off)

I used the ez-lok and was told by a guy who make furniture and uses them  that the slotted end goes up so that if you ever strip them they can be taken out. While installing my enclosure I stripped one and had to take it out also had them go in at an angle and had to back them out.  So i thinking that it can be both ways the inserts that are stainless are less likely to strip and could be done slotted side down and it will make it look cleaner

If the deck is dish shaped you need to decide between drilling straight down or perpendicular to the deck. 

Straight down will fit the enclosure better, but you might have to grind down rivet nuts on the other side. Perpendicular will match the board, but might be hard to get enclosure on and off.

Blind Rivet Nuts, those are the ones @Eboosted recomend ....

![Volker-Blind-Rivet-Nuts-1|389x341](upload://osBtHt9oO7UBDsLGJ4gesczMHo6.jpeg)

He said these are much stronger because are made from steel (won't break like treaded copper rivets), you don't tread them into the wood but instead rubber hammer (previously epoxing the hole) and that'll do it.

I would not recommend blind rivet nuts for wood... They are made for sheetmetal. True they are much stronger (in sheetmetal) But wood is a changing material and over time there is a chance that the nut will be loose in there (It wouldn't fall out simply because of the shape). I wouldn't shoot the idea of rivet nuts but threaded insert with glue just seems a better practice.

This is exactly how to do it. There should be no confusion. Or even a reason to do it the other way. also, You don't need epoxy if you drill the right size hole, put them in perfectly marked holes. Then if you can put a screw in without cross threading it you don't need epoxy.

I just prefer a hex head insert over using the existing threads to mount it. Lasts longer. Plus if you're drilling into your board you better be using a drill with a torque collar. I could see how the extreme vibrations may cause concern. Coarse threaded insert for hard wood FTW. Bonus points for using a drill press for plumb.

I respectfully disagree. If those were in fact cutting slots, why would you need a hole to be drilled in the first place? Your pilot hole is the bore of the insert shaft and the threads do the rest of the work. That slot is for emergency removal with a flathead in the case of stripped threads and also doubles as a flush mount for threaded insert specific tools. I don't think it holds better one way or another but if that insert strips out, how would you remove that insert aside from drilling the whole thing out? Also that means you're putting the thread insert counter clockwise. As you tighten the bolt into the insert (counter clock wise will now be tight, drives me nuts), it wants to back the insert out.

https://www.kipp.com/gb/en/Products/Operating-parts-standard-elements/Machine-and-fixture-components/K0978-Self-tapping-threaded-inserts-with-cutting-slot.html

This is what a lot of confusion is over. These tapered ended ones have a super deep slot for cutting threads, not the shallow slotted ones that are to be mounted up.

that's cool.  Just how I learned to do it from a buddy who works on cabinets.  But, same principle applies, just flip the insert over and put in the same way. It would still be better on the threads than flathead screwdriver application.  I will edit the top part of my post.

Thank you for being competent enough to read the entire post before replying :slight_smile:

I'll re summarize for @angeljmm and @nuttyjeff:

If it is a tapered bottom (slightly conical shape at slotted end) the slot is a thread cutter. 

If it is a cylindrical shaft with no taper, it is for insertion/removal with a tool (like @thiswasandy posted above), and the slot goes up.

Is that an aluminum strip you used over the sides of your enclosure or steel. I would like to also do that.

I did the same with an aluminum strip. It is bending a bit and I previously didn't use washers and had my nuts pulled through the aluminum after a while.

It's aluminum. I got some aluminum strips at my local hardware store and cut them to the right length and rounded the edges with my belt sander. 

The strips already came in the right width.

Mine has been going strong. You would need to tighten the crap out of it to pull through the aluminum I'm using even then I think the deck or the enclosure would split before that would happen. Maybe the aluminum you used was too thin?

I don't use any glue/epoxy on inserts and have been fine.  Be sure it is a good tight fit into the wood.  The softer the deck, the smaller the pilot holes.  

But, it is never a bad idea! Just be sure to use very sparingly to not harm the threads.

I am curious what size drill bit you will end up using. My inserts are m3 and I had to use drill bit 4.5mm. 4 was way too small and 5 was too big. let us know :slight_smile:

also factor in the tapered ends of drill bits. make sure you drill deep enough to account for those or you will end up with a insert that wont go all the way in and be very difficult to pull out to drill a longer hole. Thats why I used m3 x 6mm inserts on a 10mm thick trampa deck. in reality, i probably drilled about 8mm into the deck but that last 2mm or so cant be used because of the taperedness of drill bits. .

I'm using m4s on a deck that's about 10mm thick. I'm going to line up the deck with my drill press table and set the max stop depth of the bit to just beneath the top of my deck. The correct drill bit to use is the one that is the same thickness of the bolt shaft minus the threads. This is true for all wood screws/inserts.

Its possible you didnt drill a big enough hole for the insert... I start small then ream up each hole if it doesnt go.in with ease... So if the whole was a drill bit to small as it digs in it splits the wood to make.space as you force it.in....instead of digging threads for an appropriately sized hole

Sorry, didn't see that mentioned. Try soft wood inserts instead. If the deck is that dried out, that'll cut through nicely. Also, make sure you're putting a shit ton of pressure on the inserts while inserting. You have to make them cut through.

Not saying you didn't, just offering tips.

Why pull the insert? If the bolt lines up with the enclosure, just epoxy/superglue+baking soda/wood filler, etc with the screw in so it sets straight,  and pull the screw when it starts to set. I may be looking at the picture wrong or reading the problem wrong though.

Not sure if it's a typo or not but for clarification's sake, this is untrue. The finely threaded inserts are for hardwood. Much as steel screws have super fine threads and furniture inserts have loose threads for softer wood.

@ryansinatra I used 4 of [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DXRJXPH/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on my top mount and have had no issue. They went in super smoothly and have held my heavy ass battery/esc/electronics on to my deck while riding through the woods.

He stated that they are the ez lok threads which are the same that I used and have a very coarse threading.  The fine threaded inserts like you said are for hardwood which I totally agree with you.  Even though on the website it says for hardwood using them with the drill bit size they recommend cause the bulging of the wood.  To fix this I had to redrill the holes with the next size up bit .

Did you insert these with the slot exposed (for use with an insert tool like it is designed for)? 

Or 

Did you insert slot side first thinking its a self tapping insert? 

They look very similar in design and cause lots of confusion. 

Tiny slot that doesn't go into threads = for removal tool

Large slot that goes through threads = self tapping

Man. I tried loctite and super glue to get bolts in to pull these inserts out with no luck. Any other recommendations welcome ![IMG_20190321_011047|375x500](upload://pTyznph1lP6hiFBM093abvtzpii.jpeg)

Possibly a drill bit for removing bolts/screws where the head rips off. They have em cheap at harbor freight

Im actually mounting a case as we.speak... Using a slightly different insert... But.. I found a 5/16 bit easier to get the insert in... The 1/4 im forcing.it.to go an it.wont easily... The other inserts (which i used on my other deck) have way better digging grip which may have attributed to splitting holes...

Well I just looked and my inserts say to use a 17/64 drill bit 😐 lol - definitely don't have one of those yet. But I will after a trip to the hardware store I guess.

On the road to recovery now

Repainted. Still need my washers but all is better now :) 

I am definitely going to mount my electronics to my deck to put less weight on the enclosure.

I just did what you are about to do. It was my 3rd build and the easiest ao far. I  did use the hard woos brass inserts from Amazon and m5 hardware. There is a good tutorial on here about putting in the inserts. From the drill bit countersink to the way to place the inserts. 
Were you asking the legnth of the inserts?
