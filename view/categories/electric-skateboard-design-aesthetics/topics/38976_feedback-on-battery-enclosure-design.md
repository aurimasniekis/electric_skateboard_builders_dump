Link below is a design for my 2 6s lipo batteries. These are the dimensions:
Batteries Dimensions (LxWxH)- 5.60"x2.15"x2"
You will see that the enclosure is split in 2 sections. Each of those sections should be 2.15 inches. If any of my dimensions are wrong please let me know if if someone wouldnâ€™t mind updating it and giving me the updated file.
Thanks!!

couldnt you just take screen shots and show us that like everyone else does?  most of the people here probably wont have the knolage to say "x needs to be xmm thicker, try this"   
I know im too lazy to download a unverified .stl from a guy I dont know just to see if the design is good enough. especially since all the links youve posted dont have any form of virus scanning.

You are right, Iâ€™m not so great at cad designing which is why I wanted feedback on what to change

You can open the iCloud file and edit it if youâ€™d like. I would appreciate it if someone can fix it up. Itâ€™s just a rough design

And the 2.15 inches is for each battery separately not both combined so 4.30 would be both combined. Thanks.
Check back soon!
