Does any one have any suggestions/thoughts on this? 

If possible, I‚Äôd like to attach my enclosure without having to see a bunch of extra screws on the top of my boards - I think I‚Äôve seen on some builds from @longhairedboy  and some others where this was accomplished. 

Maybe extra plys of wood on the deck are necessary for the enclosure to be secure?

Drill all the way, use wood thread screws resin on top and griptape over that.

Thats how most do it.

Okay - but I am planning on using clear grip tape or Lucid clear grip tape spray and am looking for a way to preserve the wood deck look without having like 15+ screws showing

You could use the wood dust and wood glue to add that on top, i saved the dust from my board and i mixed it in with wood glue and put it in the holes.

Was able to restore my deck to brand new, cant see where i drilled holes was even able to return it to the store for a full refund since i only drilled the holes.


But if the deck is thick just drill untill your close to the top and use the wood things you screw into it and use short screws with a little threadlocker on it.

By wood things, do you mean threaded inserts?

Shouldn't if you use enough of em and drill them deep enough. You can use resin to be certain they won't mess up.

If you thread them in with some epoxy in the hole it shouldnt.

The only thing i would imagine is the weight of the box under it, so you might have to use bigger screws for it.

And secure most of the things on the deck itself with velcro straps.

you could try not drilling all the way through and using something like this:

they expand and grip as you screw into them

Look closely on the side of the pack I have wire hooks. They are glued down and underneath the pack is 2 layers 3m foam tape. Gonna strap it down and 6 screws m4 will hold only the enclosure and its own weight. Hope it works

I'm using the slotted ones as pictured above - 5mm, they are pretty sensitive for hole diameter and a smear of epoxy helps for sure, might have better luck with the furniture type ones...have ordered a few to compare.

You can measure deck thickness (sometimes varies a bit) and put a piece of tape around the drill bit to tell you when to stop drilling

that works a treat for sure. I also use a white line of paint from a paint pen, it seems to cause less distraction as the tape wants to fly off, and sometimes it moves.

If you use T-nut you need to drill a hole through the board.

I rarely see links from Amazon.ca here, I thought "hey cool !". But then I tried to order, product will arrive between Feb 9th and March 2nd. No thanks :sweat_smile: 

Back to the topic, I'm thinking of using insert nuts. I have one question though
- Should the insert nuts always be inserted from the top of the board and go through it ? Or can I just drill from below and put the insert nut from there ? Do you recommend using any sort of wood glue or anything to make sure the inserts won't move ?

i don't have to remove a paint dot to use the bit for something else, a paint dot costs like a millionth of a cent, and a paint dot won't rub the wood when if gets down to the line. I have bits with multiple dots on them in different colors, each one at a different depth for a different task.

Paint does work great. 

I've always used collars  with tape on the surface of what I'm drilling so that the collars don't Mar the work once you get to depth. Different strokes for different folks

I just know tape on the drill never works as the shavings go up the material evacuation splines and rip /press the tape out of place making for inconsistency when doing more then one hole

The question is... what will win the fight when you have to remove the enclosure every now and then...
Woodglue/epoxy on the wood threaded inserts OR the thread locker you put on the screws?

In my first build I used nothing but the threaded insert (no resin/epoxy) and I used thread locker on the screws. When I tried to take them out, as you'd expect... the screw took the insert with it. Needed to be cut off with Dremel. 

Im building a new board and Im about to attach enclosure. Almost tempted to screw straight into the wood with normal wood screws and bypass the threaded inserts... unless someone can testify that the epoxy'd inserts beats the thread locker?

Thanks for sharing that, I didn't expect that to happen. I haven't setup my new enclosure with threaded inserts yet, but I guess I'll have to find a way to make sure the inserts stay in the wood.

Use epoxy on the inserts, don't need thread locker on screws. Wood screws may work, but may weaken once removed/reinstalled.

I'm using a rubber gasket on the enclosure. When compressed it puts pressure on the screws, keeping them tight. 

Or you may want to try a weaker loctite. I use a removable and unremovable loctite for different needs.

Exactly.  They cost a LOT more on Amazon.  Like everything, you could order an infinity from alibaba probably for next to nothing if you don't mind waiting a lifetime.

But 8mm M4 are on prime. 3 day shipping. They accidentally sent me 30 instead of 20. So win there.

After using the inserts @Eboosted (stainless rivet nut inserts) suggested and the traditional inserts @deckoz uses, I can say I will only use these.

Maybe thats just me. @deckoz have you tried these in any of your mirad of amazing builds?

E-Z Lok Externally Threaded Insert, 303 Stainless Steel, M4-0.7 Internal Threads, M8x1.25 External Threads, 7.49mm Length, Made in US (Pack of 5) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KLT1UC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_S-6fCbN75DDDT

Interesting product I haven't seen offered before. I'd still trust an epoxy most but this would be interesting to test. Anyone have user feedback?

Agreed. I just don't want to use brass because it mars more easily. Most boards are a glue, hardwood composite so I think metal threads would be alright. My deck is also 13mm thick so I'm probably just going to use m4 x 10mm

Im using 2 3d pribted frames one on the board and one on the enclosure.
The frames are made out of flexible tpe to avoid vibration noise and to achive some sealing aganst dust / splash water
In the frames are strong neodym magnets 6 in each frame
So when i put the enclosure on it fets alligned through the magnets and to really fixate it ill push it down thts the 2 valcro pieces touch
It holds up well and you dont see any screws at all

Looks really good but strong magnets + electronics scares me. Nobody point out that motors run off of magnets. I'm well aware.

Right on. This was the only thing holding me back from trying magnets myself. Looks so clean and doesn't damage the deck one bit.

I know this is an old thread but if my deck is about .5‚Äù or 12.7mm would I be fine with a 10mm deep wood insert?

Would 10mm be too close to drilling straight through?
