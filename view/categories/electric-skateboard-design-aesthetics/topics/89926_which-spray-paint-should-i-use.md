What type of (spray) paint would work on a blank deck?
Any recommendations?

I've heard automotive paint looks the best but I imagine any 'ol paint/primer/clear coat will be fine as long as you put good work into it.

Hey!

Don't know enough about paint to give any suggestions but here is what I did.

First I sanded my deck.

Applied 3 layers of primer

Applied 3 layers of black paint

Applied 3 layers of clear coat

2 layers could probably had done it, but....

Use urethane based car paint and primer. Anything spray paint will run, will fail to adhere
