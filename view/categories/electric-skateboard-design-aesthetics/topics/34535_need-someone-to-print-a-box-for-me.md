I have designed a box and lid I need 3D printed. I have a printer but dont trust it enough to leave running for 37 hours. Anyone have a quicker printer and would be willing to print this for me?

Iâ€™m thinking I may print it in pieces and join it after printing.

Thatâ€™s possible, just remember it will be weak at the joints

Itâ€™s going on top of the board and will pretty much just act as a dust cover so I think it will be ok. We will see.

Should be good then as long as itâ€™s not structural. 

@GrecoMan most of the printers I have have been built or modded by hand so I can trust them pretty well

Even though I can watch my print from a different room with the built in camera I still donâ€™t trust it...

If you make it in sections you could always abs cement a small sheet of abs to the inside to solidify the seams. That's what I'd do. I mean. if I didn't already have a better way to make an enclosure.

If you need to join parts together, try friction welding. It works suprisingly well
