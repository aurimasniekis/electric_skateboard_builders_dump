Will easily fit up to 2 4s 10ah lipos or the S.P.A.C.E. battery from Enertion. Will also fit 2 esc's. Dual Diagonal, dual rear or dual front. I'm going to make a rubber gasket for my next build to seal it up perfectly. LHB inspired me to dremel out my next board so that my motor wires wont be exposed. Let me know what you guys think. If there's interest I'll make more.

Sweet! When you attach these enclosures to your board, do you just screw it in? Or do you use some sort of removable fastener so you can unload the batteries for charging, modifications, etc?

I think psychotiller set up charge leads for his batteries for his last enclosure and he just used some thing that you put in the board to make threads so he could use screws.

Wow, very nice @psychotiller ! @siggs3000 one option for this kind of enclosure is to use [t-nuts][1]  and then regular screws or thumb screws to keep it on.

Looks like the enclosure might be too small for some of you...just did a return because he said that his 2 Vedder vesc's wouldn't fit with the space cell. He did however mention the added caps and that he didn't want to just stuff them in there. This is just a heads up! For anyone else that uses my enclosures, please post pics of your build. Would be nice to see the layout of your components. Thanks!

@psychotiller just bought your enclosure!  It took some time to convince myself that I needed it!  You've inspired me to move up to 8s (using those 10ah batteries in series) and pick up a VESC.  This is a project that never stops!  The need for speed and clean aesthetics is alive!

Nice! @Gatwod That battery set up in particular is really nice (there's no adhesive between the cells so its an easy job to lay them out flat.) Works out to over 300Wh too!

@psychotiller It looks like you said someone earlier felt that the enclosure wasn't big enough for dual VESC and the cell battery? Have you made an enclosure that will fit those yet ?
```

---
## \#20 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2015-10-13T13:06:59.003Z Reads: 381

```
It does fit. You would need to lay both vesc's sideways though. Not lengthwise with your deck. Another factor is probably the caps used and how they are soldered to your vesc.  He wanted me to make the enclosure 3 to 4 inches longer when I already had dimensions straight from @onloop. The vesc's aren't even that big...

@disastorm I made a modifiation to the mold today. The Low Profile Enclosure will now have the capability of being 20" long. This will allow you to lay your VESC's out lengthwise as well as (I'm hoping) give enough room to cover the new larger capacity Space Cell. *Note this enclosure is now 2 piece with a tongue and groove seem in the middle.
New dimensions are:
Length-508mm (was 448mm)
Width- 216mm
Middle section-27mm tall
Either end of enclosure-33mm tall for esc clearance.
Both ends of the enclosure taper to 203mm 

Let me know if you want  one!

Whats the point of 2 pieces? Is it just because your printer wasn't big enough ? Also, I would need to cut parts to access a power switch or to see the voltage display ? How do you seal it?

Yes. If you read the threads you will see it mentioned a couple of times how big my oven is. So you know,  you don't use a printer when vacuum forming...and as for cutting out ports or holes for your accessories, of course you have to. Why would you think you wouldn't? Everybody does. We all have different parts, ideas and setups. The only way to work around that is to buy a complete. 
I'm making these enclosures by hand one at a time. The hard work has been done for you. 
If you want something specific all you need to do is give me some specifics. Or read my threads.  You could make your own vacuum forming setup with the information I've written on the forums.

Threw on @psychotiller's ABS enclosure....looks much better than the hobby box I was using prior to this! I used the Tree nuts (or T-nuts) to secure the mount, also I put some foam weather stripping on the edges to keep debris out the box. I am very happy overall, thanks brotha!!!

nice!
@psychotiller  I just ordered your 21 inch split enclosure.

So, if I understand correctly, the way people screw in enclosures is to drill a hole in the bottom of the board, screw something in and then have a t-nut on the top of the board ?
```

---
## \#40 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2015-10-16T22:36:50.925Z Reads: 299

You could just drill a wood/sheet metal screw of course pre-drilling a similar diameter hole through the enclosure but eventually the thread will wear out and it's better to include a t nut + thumb screw/bolt.
```

---
## \#41 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2015-10-16T22:40:23.593Z Reads: 277

Awesome! 
Yup, just use T-Nuts. Drill the hole pattern needed to properly form  the enclosure on your deck, insert the T-nuts down through the deck and then grip tape over them. If you do it this way they'll be invisible. Goolge T-nuts and you'll see all of the different varieties. There are some pretty cool versions that look good too if you don't grip over them.

I'll pack up your Enclosure right now and ship it in the morning!

Thanks!

Either one of these would work perfectly! The second one is basically the same as the first but there is more ESC room (for 2 ESC's if wanted) and a little compartment up front for switches, Voltage meters or fuses..

@camyboy
 You could either wire up a charge port and fix a plug to the enclosure or just use T-nuts to fasten the enclosure and that way you'll have nice threaded holes that wont strip out when you remove the cover to charge your batteries.

Here's a new shape!
19.5" x 6.25" Split Symetrical ABS Enclosure
Dimensions:
Battery area (middle) 10" x 6.25" x 1.75" (L 254mm x W 158.75mm x H 44.4mm)
Each end is 6.25" and 1.6" tall (W 158.75 x H 40mm)
Length of entire enclosure is 19.5" (L 495mm)
Overall width including the flange is 8"  (W 203mm)

Will work for 4s, 6s, 8s, 10s, and 12s setups and will accommodate 2 esc's if needed.

ah right on I'll probably just do that then. Might have another small problem too because I have [these][1] 5S 5Ah batteries that claim to have a height of 38mm but are actually a little over 44mm. So do you think I could squeeze them in the V2 enclosure by just raising it up with some washers or velcro or something?

You could always make a gasket that's the same shape as the flange. That would raise it up and it would be clean

Lay them all out how you'd like them on your board and email me some solid measurements. If I have something I'll get you set up quick! If not I'll make a new mold for you.
Cost for a custom mold and enclosure is $86 shipped in the USA

Hope that was clear. As to what you need

Perfect. Are you going to put your speed controller(s) in a different
enclosure?

How much do you charge for these? Do you have a how-to video or something? I think I have all the tools to make my own but would rather not risk it if yours are within my budget
