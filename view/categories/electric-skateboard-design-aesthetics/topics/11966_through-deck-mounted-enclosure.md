Looking ran good my next build is going to be a fully enclosed battery/ esc enclosure. Will have a normal deck and smooth mold a extract section of wood and carbon fibre weave sheet on top to make it look like one pice.

I will cutout a curve corresponding to the curve of my deck, in the plastic end bits, when I get my deck.

The aluminium should bend easily so no problem there
