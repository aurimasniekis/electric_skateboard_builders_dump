I'm looking for a way to panel mount my motor wires to the enclosure. Other than routing cables in the board, what's the best way to connect motor wires to/through an enclosure? Is there a panel mount for bullet connectors? I found this:

It says it's rated for 55a, but I can't find the size of the bullets on the spec sheet.

Any other panel/enclosure mounted connection ideas?

Could always just drill 3 holes and epoxy the bullet in place. Would probably give the best look from the outside.

If anyone is considering getting these I did a bit of research of Amphenol ones. 

There are versions where you can put your own bullet sockets and versions with bullet socket connectors pre-installed and you just need to solder the wires. Bullets are 5.5mm type.

## 1.

The exact part number is DA3W3SA00LF. This version only has 3.1mm holes for mounting to panel (enclosure).

Version with M3 threaded insert instead of just holes, which I would recommend, is part number DAL3W3SA00LF. But the latter version is not really stocked with quite long lead times..

Part number is LCC17-A3W3SM-2N0 (3.10mm holes). According to datasheets, there should be a version with threaded inserts LCC17-A3W3SM-4N0 but it seems like it is not in production.

@Holyman92  those mt60 connectors are 3.5mm. the bullet connectors are 5.5mm. or will it not matter because i am soldering new wires coming from under the pad to the enclosure?

That's where u get into making your own connectors... u use an mt60 on the vesc and it's corresponding piece with 10 awg wire with 5.5mm connectors at the other end to click into the riser pads where the motor female leads go
