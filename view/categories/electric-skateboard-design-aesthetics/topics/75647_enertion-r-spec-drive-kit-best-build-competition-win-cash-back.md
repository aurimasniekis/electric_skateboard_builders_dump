What have been the reviews on ur recent hubs with upgrades, still having heat problems?
```

## \#9 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2018-11-23T08:06:32.477Z Reads: 382

```
At this scale there is always going to be excess heat in the motor when you have direct drive system. Going larger motors is always better but obviously there is a limit to the physical size when using 90mm wheels. 

Heat therefore is one of the biggest challenges of direct drive hub motors systems.

So what becomes important is how you deal with the heat. There are at least three points that must be carefully considered. 

1. Extraction of heat from stator core.
2. Heat sinking and dissipation.
3. Digital thermal management, using sensors and current throttling.

We believe we are the market leaders in all 3 categories at the moment. Building the Raptor 2 meant we approached the drive train design as a complete system. This is why this kit bundled with the focbox unity will be so good for esk8 builds, its a system that has been designed to maximize performance. It's not just parts put together.

I guess I could probably put something together. Old parts with the new. Might be able to have some time this weekend. Just waiting for a new battery to get here. Ordered the new drive so I'll end up using that in the end when it gets here. But for science...

@onloop you give here the reason for me to take the plunge. 

I have already ordered the unity when the first sale came up. So I don't need the bundle. 
Buying the bundle is mandatory to make the contest or having the unity and the drive train is ? 
If it's the first option can I cancel my first order of unity to transfer the money on the second order if that makes sense .obviously I won't need 2 with 1 drive !

Might be best to cancel the first order and get the unity at lower price in the bundle. Please email support@enertionboards.com or use the 24/7 chat and we can sort this out for you.

I have still yet to see anyone do a 2wd comparison race between hummie hubs and raptor 2 motors (preferably a 3rd unbiased party).

At some point, I think it becomes more about the system you have and how much power it can delivery to them. I am assuming these hubs can take high watts (2000 or so) without any issue, as hummie hubs can.

I really wonder how much the 24 tooth stator plays into this. More switching loses. You’ve made a large effort though to pull that heat away, where hummie hasn’t yet. However, hummie hubs don’t need all to of that to stay cool.

That’s the whole trick to hub motors. Less rolling resistance, but still good efficieny and torque without a lot of heat. Not entirely sure anyone has quite figured that out yet. Based on what I keep hearing, it seems you have 2.5 out of 3.

Now that these are going to be out in the diy wild, curious to see more about how they perform. You told us a long time ago that longer stator with be harder to dissapate heat. But so far, heat build up hasn’t been an issue at all.

Can’t wait to see what others do and how they perform. Glad to hear your using a 15mm axle. John said to me on day one that 8mm would have issues because it’s so long for 8mm. But sometimes, you have to try anyways, for science.

Buy these and build some crazy builds. Need more over powered boards to race.

Would love to see an unbiased look at them both. I said it a long time ago, collectively we can all push the industry forward by understanding each others points of views and learning from it. Im sure both sides have learned and/or are learning from each other. Combining ideas is the best path to quicker innovation. Keeping stuff hush hush slows things down and is better for buisness. The good thing is, with motors, it can all be reverse engineered. So nothing is a secret once it hits the public.

## \#34 Posted by: evoheyax Posted at: 2018-11-24T20:40:25.592Z Reads: 264

With hummie hubs, $800 for 4wd. Get 4x focboes now for $400 and I just got a 12s 25ah lipo for $400. $1600 later you’ll have a 50 mile range rocket with insane power.

Can do the same thing here with raptor hubs, just a bit more money. If money is an issue, skip the unity and just buy focboxes. $200 cheaper for 4wd.

The problem is that I don't even have $1600.... :slight_smile:
I would love to have some hummie hubs but right now it's pretty difficult to get them :joy:
Otherwise it's a neat idea...

Edit: If there is anyone who would like to sell me their hubs (I doubt there will) just send me a pm :smile:

Thanks Man! Yeah, I got a 3D printer a while back and decided to figure out how to design my own parts for this build. After I designed it, I had to break it down into 3 sections to print because of the max print size limits, then fuse the sections together. It took a lot of trial, error, revisions and reprinting, but it was worth the time invested. 

As for the fan, I live in texas so figured it was a good idea once summer rolls around.

**My Entry to the R-spec Drive Kit Best Build Comp-**

**Solar Bone Breaker 2.0** 

**Deck**: ORRSOM Longboard 985mm tip to tip Concave

**Under Tray**:  Trampa ORRSOM LONGBOARD Underboard Battery Tray 63cm long CNC precision mounting holes

**Drive System**:  Enertion Raptor R-Spec 2.1 Drive System

**Wheels**: Enertion Raptor Ghost 90mm 

**Batteries** :  12s4p Samsung 30Q custom built pack 

**Regen System**:  jiang Flexible Solar Panel Thin Film Module DIY 1W 6V Photovoltaic Cells, Blue DROK DC/DC Boost Converter 12-60V to 12-80V Step-up Voltage Regulator 600W Auto Power Supply Transformer Adjustable Output Volt

**VESC**:  Enertion Unity VESC

**Trucks**: Custom Remodeled Enertion "extra wide " edition. 

**Controls** :  Enertion Nano X and Custom "POWER GLOVE " remote .  Switchable between both systems 

**HUD Display** :  Boscam receiver module and Adafruit 1.5” display 








So I am new to this Forum and this is my second build but first time posting . I am posting to enter my build to Enertion 2.1 drive system contest build. I hope you guys can give me feed back and not beat me up to badly . I also hope the build really show cases the contest rules and maybe bends a few of them .

OK so first off, this build was Sponsored by my work , to be more specific Mattel…Hotwheels Group . Yeah Hotwheel as in thee die cast cars most of you grew up with . I wanted to start off with the names of the people who helped make this board build possible . Micheal Kadile (ME) hahah, Riki Yoshida , Sam Tsui, Kevin Cao, Jim Highwart, Rex Hidalgo, Chris Downs, Rafael Bencosme and Cesar Correa(the guy that got me into Eboards) .

We wanted to attack this build with a innovation heavy theme rather than just a use of the motors on a board build . Like just slapping the awesome enertion 2.1 motors on a deck and making a build . I knew from my previous builds that wider was better also lower for more stability. So making some major changes to the 2.1 trucks required a redo on the stock hangers.

As you can see we widen the stock truck to make a 2" difference per side. In the pics above we just showed the rear ones being made and assembled. I will post pics of the front trucks later .

Another thing that I was interested was increasing over all distance with the battery . We decided to add some solar panels to the top of the deck . This was a major pain in the ASS!! The deck choice for this was the TRAMPA’s ORRSOM Longboard 985mm tip to tip Concave . I choose the 15 layer deck for the build . Now i say pain in the ass because if you know what material TRAMPA decks are made of and have ever drilled in or machined them …yeah that stuff is like fiber glass . Itch town 5000!!! Cover up and wear gloves . So we got solar cells and I routed out the top deck to accommodate the panels. The other guys where figuring out how to wire in the converter and reconfig it so that it would fit inside the Trampa lower tray. You can see what we got and the specs . I can go into detail later on the overall assembly but it wasn’t that hard just the deck prep was the most time consuming . Finding the right size solar cell was also an issue and ones you could stand on as well was challenge . You can see in the pics below what we found and used .  The results of adding the Solar Cells to the top of the deck goes as follows .  
          So its not like ride it on solar power…hell there isn’t a car you can buy that does either. BUT…what we got out of the 7 solar panels is that you can get a mile for every hour that the board sits in direct sun. So if you where to travel 3 mile and hang out at the beach for 3 hours you would get your ride back . That also means no plugging in that’s just on solar regeneration. Now I live off the strand in Redondo Beach CA. Its flat …adding hill to the equation will change the amount and time to regen. Also clouds …big factor , sunny CA is very beneficial for this board build . If you leave the board in the sun or out on your deck or porch it would take 30 hours to charge fully from 10% . So it helps …not a 100% change in the way we regen but it does help with getting back some juice .   With the solar converter there is also the ability to charge a device straight from the solar cells .  So if you need to charge your phone on a sunny day out on a ride while taking a rest ...there is that option.

Finding room in the tray for all the components wasn’t that hard . The new UNITY VESC was vital to saving room . The new vesc made it easy to drop in the BMS, a 12s4p Samsung 30q battery pack, GPS tracking, flight controller custom board , voltage reader , and xt90 -xt60 connectors. So Thanks again Enertion for the new designed Unity VESC. Also motor set up was so fast and easy !! I would say the longest part of the set up was waiting for my bluetooth to find the Unity VESC.

The controller , here is where I let the other teammates(Riki and Sam) decided how I would control the board. Now just a little back story … non of these guys ride !!! SOOOO they decided to make me a POWER GLOVE style controller. I know that this isn’t as much as a new way to control throttle and definitely not the best way, but why not try it . First time controlling this build with he glove style controller was needless to say… SCARY AS HELL!!! It was finicky and unnatural . I would say that this would be something that would require a little more tuning and thought. I put a Enertion NANO controller in after that first couple rides just to make sure I wouldn’t break another arm and shoulder again. We used a flight controller as well for the radio in conjuction witht he power glove style controller … There are some great options that you can tap into when you use a flight controller. Some feature that we added to the board where , onboard GPS Tracking , heads up display unit w/info, speed monitoring , voltage monitoring , and signal strength. Like i said …I did switch to the nano controller and we are trying to refine the final way we will control the board . I also mounted the Head Up Display to my helmet . Its kinda chunky but it does work …I can see all the things that I stated above by looking through that lens . No need to look at my phone or controller for speed or battery voltage .

This far into the build I asked my friend and co-worker Kevin Cao designer on HotWheels to put some design aspect to the board build . He designed the rear Kick Tail that doubles as a drag handle . The hex grip tape and HotWheels trim was made by Rafael Bencosme I think with more time I would have also liked to add a side retractable handle for carrying it. I will say this board isn’t light . I would say that it comes in at about 25lb . So the drag handle make it a little better than actually carrying it . Anyways here is the end results . Hope you guys like it …it was alot of fun putting this together . My hope in the end is to possibly make another board with some more innovative parts and possible wheel interchangeability. Enjoy and good luck to the other contestants .
