Whats everyone's thoughts on re-profiling this deck, I have marked out with tape the approximate shape I was going for?

If you're happy with it, personally (in my own opinion) I think having that small tail at the back looks weird. But do what makes you happy.

Totally cool if you want, but is there a goal here?  The deck limits you to smaller wheels, so this will allow bigger?  Don't think so since it would be symmetrical...  but curious.

Sorry should have made it clear, I would be replicating the cut on both tails. The deck is symmetric.

Just wanted to show what it is now.

Objective: not the biggest fan of the blade tip and trying to avoid spacers for 90mm wheels

I think the top end looks much better and gives you more wheel freedom

I say cut it too. It looks better and big wheels are cool.

Chop it dude...

maybe make a jig you can clamp on each of the four cuts to make it symmetrical?
