With tons of options out there to hold and protect all of our prized electronics, what have you used, and are your go-to enclosures?

@psychotiller and @RunPlayBack make DIY enclosures, I would use one of them! ADS also sells some. Or, a lunchbox!

I like to fiberglass mine custom for whatever build i'm currently working on. It's messier and more work, but i think the end result is pretty damned sweet. I usually end up with a pretty tough box and at around 1mm thick its thin and sexy.

I have been making my own custom enclosures from carbon fibre.

I build a vacuum forming machine BUT i cannot get it to form correctly so I just used a heat gun and bent the sheets of HIPS to the shape i wanted. and it is connected to the board via neo magnets.  9 partial holes drilled in the deck, magnets glued in to the deck to be flush.  And then 9 magnets on the box to clamp it on the deck very tightly! works perfectly.

@barajabali what size neo magnets and how did you get them to stay on your plastic enclosure?

1/4 inch thick and 1/5 inch diameter round magnets. 

And i used gorilla glue and then i painted the enclorsure so they dont move

Here's my duel VESC case for my latest build. 3D printed case and vac formed cover, will be wrapping in black or carbon vinyl. Can't decide yet üòÇ <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fd697c0522c4fffd201dc7680c05271ad4948834.jpeg" width="499" height="499">

Cheers Tom!

No I used a CNC MDF mold for the vac form then printed the abs case separately. Here's some more pics :)

That's so clean! I'm assuming you'll have a second case on the opposite end for the batteries? Or will you be running SPACE cell?

Yeah I've got another case to go on the front I'm running braided cables under the grip tape so the two cases are separate as my deck is pretty flexy. Thanks for your kind comments. :smile:

Amazing enclosures @Jack ! Very slick and boosted-esque. Been wanting to DIY something like this for my build. Wanted to vacuum form something from probably ABS but wasn't keen on the texture that comes with that. What material did you use?

Cant see it on the pic, but there is a readout in the middle of the drop that shows voltage or percentage of battery left. Switch and charge ports on the side. 

10S4P with ESC, BMS, switch and bt module all tightly packaged. Just over 3/4" tall

Vacuum formed. Planning to redo it with fiberglass.

Have any of you ordered from psychotiller lately?  I ordered almost a month ago.  Didn't get any responses on my e-mails.  Then finally it said a shipping label was created, but when I track it the package hasn't been picked up/sent.  Does it usually take him quite a bit of time?  Anywhere else reasonably priced and quick I can find an enclosure that holds a 12s4p and dual vesc?
