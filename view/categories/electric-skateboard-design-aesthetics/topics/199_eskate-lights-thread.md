@onloop mentioned I should make a build thread for my headlights.
To be honest they are so super easy and cheap that I dont really think they deserve a thread of their own, but how about you guys also post up some of your lighting ideas as well.

so here are my headlights:

they arent going to give you super night vision, but they do help a lot, and if nothing else, they get you seen by others at night. (the amount of times I have nearly slammed into cyclists because they have no lights at night...)
so heres what I did:
I bought 4 20mm "P" clips and 2 3W LED flashlights off ebay. total cost of $6 AUD
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/33b407d56556e7c9e6e8df9e2efb565c8a7aba23.jpg" width="690" height="388"> 
bolt them under your truck hardware and presto.

one bit of advice, maybe get higher quality LED flash lights than I did, as one of mine tends to flicker with the vibration from the board.

other than that.. happy night riding!

This guy here works great. There's also a red one. You can mount it to your board on the front and/or zip tie. Could make a   3d printed mount which mounts to the truck.

100% co-sign on these lights. I ended up buying  2 sets of White and Red because of @torqueboards recommendation. These COB LED's are way brighter than standard LED's, 3 brightness settings, 3 flash settings, and the rechargeable USB battery is super robust. Really can't beat the price as well. I used to mount them on my trucks but kind of got tired of having them collect dirt and grime. Now I mount them to my backpack for better vertical visibility and strap the White LED on the bottom of my @torqueboards mini remote which acts as a hella bright flashlight and a way to warn any approaching vehicles with the wave of my hand.

The light on your controller is a brilliant idea :) didn't think of that one. I should put some on my backpack too.

I have a torch helmet so that helps also.

[/quote]

i would be thrilled to death if everyone just stopped making lights for bikes and boards that flashed. There's no reason to throw somebody into a seizure/migraine just so you can claim higher visibility when it in fact does not increase visibility, just irritation, and for some of us the flashing makes it take longer for our eyes to adjust back to the darkness. Not to mention bikes and eboards are not emergency vehicles. And how the hell can you possibly see as well when riding the vehicle if your headlights are strobing?

I just keep the lights on. I don't flash them. I think strobe lights are better than putting these on a helmet.

Yeah I'd never use the White COB setting on strobe and typically keep the Red on solid. But you never know, having a flashing option might prove useful in some kind of emergency. I don't think I've encountered any obnoxious strobing from cyclists or skaters in my area. In fact, there's such a lack of awareness with safety lights that [the city issued free lights and reflective gear to the public][1]. These bright COB lights probably saved my ass on a few occasions and it's really up to the user to not be obnoxious with it.

Not quite sure if this part of accessories, but I consider them as an added feature.

My previous accessories / features that I used to love is the telemetry for rpm meter, temperature and battery meter live feed to the remote from the board.

It has a button for 3 settings of brightness. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e717355894573ad0e17912aac1d8a9d90644109a.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6eda2cda1c1602b2dec01ed371735e3233ce9e66.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Build isn't done yet but when it is the light will fit into the enclosure and there will be a clear plastic over it to protect it

:grin: Ask and you shall receive. I got the idea from the torch light on the E-GO controller which is novel but not very practical because you have to hold the slider up while controlling speed. This mod you can keep the light on and control brightness if you get into some dark areas. It's saved me from hitting major potholes and wiping out. Also acts as a wand to let approaching vehicles at an intersection know you're there. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/916e8e223204a3344e0e5cc28f1473c0991ba7a2.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I have one of the lights that @torqueboards and @RunPlayBack mentioned. That was the easiest upgrade I've ever done! This thing is insanely bright, and at the highest setting it will still outlast my 5000mah packs! Can't go wrong for $9! Now I want another for symmetry!

Nice! Cool lights right? Before my build I was experimenting with various LED strips and regulators to tap into the battery but none of it really compared to the design and adaptability of these things. Plus COB LED's are just way more energy efficient. One of the best ebay finds thanks to @torqueboards

This thread is right up my ally way. All boards that I'm building with have lights build into the deck. Hopefully, I'd like to build thinner boards with thinner lights in the future, but for now, these bad boy off road lights provide quite a bit of lighting.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00C1BZT3E/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Led headlights and FUNCTIONAL brake lights plug and play with enertion controller. No wiring, no worrying about charging your lights separate.  And real brake lights are just trick

those brake lights work if your esc has the right connectors. I'm using those headlights/taillights in my boards, and they work great. But to get the brake lights working as brake lights and not just tail lights, you need special light ports on your esc, which most esc's do not have.
```

## \#37 Posted by: lowGuido Posted at: 2016-03-02T18:54:31.221Z Reads: 1564

not necessarily true.
you can buy light kits that will work with any ESC, not requiring "special light ports"
they just pick up the signal from the PWM line on the receiver.
see the connections in this picture:  it just plugs right in.

I'm not saying it needs a special port to work. I use it with the gt2b and enertion controller.

But you get a solid red and white lights.

You do not get working brake lights without the special ports. They are just solid red lights. They don't react to the throttle.

Mind posting a video?

Because I plug mine into my GT2B and all I get is light. No throttle response does anything to affect those lights. The only video I could find about setting up these lights is by hobbyking, and they show you plugging one cable into the reciver and one into these light ports on the esc. No matter what port on the receiver I put these into, nothing changes.

I think i figured it out. It has to be on the same channel of as the throttle, meaning I need to combine the esc servo wires and the servo wires for the lights together.

However, it controlled my headlights when I braked, not the taillights.

Also, How would you use turn signals?

haha keep going you will get it eventually.. swap the headlight ant the tail light plugs.

that particular kit doesn't come with turn signals, but it is the same theory, but instead of plugging into the brake channel it plugs into the steering channel and the lights light up when you turn the wheel of the GT2B.

I'm getting weird results switching it around the other way.

It could be my controller needs charging, but it worked once, then it got stuck dim, and wouldn't go back up to bright, Sometimes I turn it on and the tail lights are on, sometimes, they are off. If they are off, sometimes, they come on when I hit the throttle or brake, and sometimes, they stay off. I double checked my soldering and it all seems good.

Head and tail lights worked flawlessly on a 10 mile nighttime shake down.  Gives plenty of light,  combined with a helmet mounted light I felt very safe and well seen

Quadcopter Lights 1.5w .... Best set up so far...clean easy to use and super bright....run the wire under the truck....the light has a metal stem at the end of the metal casing so you can put it right up against the truck.... I suppose you could run a small channel .....

a company called RC Lighthouse sells RC car lighting kits for 8th and 10th scale model cars on Amazon. They're plug and play and some kits come with blinkers! They even have police car light kits so you can pull over other eboarders and write them tickets for lack of steez. 

They go between the ESC and receiver, so they pick up the signal and know what to do with it. Reverse triggers a brighter red light when currently moving forward. For the turn signal kits i'm pretty sure the wheel triggers it, which would finally give the GT2B wheel some purpose for eboarders.

This is basically the same kit since RC Lighthouse seems to be out or not listing thiers. This kit comes with housings for the head lights, mine didn't, but mine was also half the price so i hope they come back soon.

I'm trying to do a simple lighting mod and there's a few different ways to accomplish this but I was hoping to get some input from the lighting experts in here. So I got this compact, ultra bright dimmable USB light stick and I wanted to run 5v power from the VESC into a mountable female USB port that I would mount onto my enclosure. This is for a single VESC setup. My goal is to have a removable, plug and play lighting option that doesn't attract much attention and doesn't draw too much power. Any suggestions on what I would need?

@longhairedboy I thought of that but then I want the option to shut it off so I'd have to install a switch. Then I got my hands on these usb lights and I remembered one of the things I dug about the Yuneec EGO was the USB port which I used for some LED strip lighting a few times. I want a non permanent system basically and the easiest plug and play solution I could think of was a USB port.

@Michaelinvegas it's to connect a USB desk fan for those hot summer nights

Am I missing something here, the eBay auctions of these usb modules are all 5v-5v modules.  I understand you guys want to use the voltage output from the gt2b but what about something like this?  http://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-DC-Converter-Step-Down-Power-Module9V-12V-24V-36Vto5V-Dual-USB-Output-adapter-/331697728675?hash=item4d3ab9aca3:g:P~cAAOSw0HVWBPw9

this way there's no possibility of ruining the receiver?

Yeah that would work too but I already got that USB module servo splitter that I listed above which hopefully doesn't interfere with the receiver channel. It's cheap enough to experiment so I'll update this thread once I install it.

Dunno...it's made for skateboards...but we ride for miles with teeth shattering vibrations under our feet...

I've toyed with metal brackets for lights....No Bueno ... Plastic cracks or the actual metal bracket will just snap...

At $29 bucks...I may give it a try........

But your right...I do hold a little doubt that these would survive a month.....but could be wrong...

Block lights like these aren't ideal...too much mass vibrating ... The case or the actual lights inside will break or dislodge ..... 1.5w quadcopter lights, wired through a truck riser is almost the perfect solution in my eye...they are small...tucked in the corner...can be super clean look if you wire it right...it's cheap...simple and bright....they weigh nothing and stay in place and don't jiggle around when I ride at night no matter what type of road ..and since they are tucked in the conter of the truck...it will be less likely you smash something with it...I broke my mounted light so many times...it was annoying .... Hit the curb...hit another board.....and the light would end up smashed or bent for the ride back home...

I'd like to find something like the little metal bubble shaped lights you see on the tip of a boat, the red and green nav lights. just something you can mount with one bolt under the nose and each side under the tail. I'd also like to see pink classic Cadillac fins on the back of a board, but that's beyond my fabrication abilities currently.


EDIT: This is what i'm currently using. Seriously, they're not cheapos but they are 1/2" risers. I'm going to attempt to make them shorter soon, possibly angled.

Those are some cool shots. Really digging the different light shows from each of your boards. 

What's your opinion on EL wire? I know it's not as bright as LED's, but I have about 150' of this stuff in 5 different colors that I want to try something with. 

A little off topic, but what kind of box/enclosure do you have on the board on the right?

I got some to experiment with using it on my Subaru for a night RallyCross race, but they had different lengths and colors on sale for uber cheap on Amazon, and well, I got a little carried away. Kind of like this whole eSk8 thing. I think I might have a problem. :smiling_imp:

I wanted to do a lot more to my car, but I ran out of time. I also found that little squares of clear gorilla tape every foot or two hold the wire in place very well and don't interfere with light output.

[Pelican cases](http://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/watertight-protector-hard-cases/micro-case/standard/1060/) I drag them right across speed bumps with barely a scratch. The clearance sucks but they're strong enough that it hasn't mattered yet. The white tape in that pic is covering holes where I had a small fan sitting on risers to keep the air flowing but all internal. I'm still working out how to stay dust proof and get fresh air to the ESC.

Oh boy, can't wait to see that! With a little routing and artistic talent, you could probably do any kind of line drawn design that you want. And if I'm not mistaken, I think you can splice different colors together to make one single multi colored strand. Wish I had more time and talent to try this myself. I'll probably just wire up a night riding suit like those guys in the pic you posted.

It's pretty easy and fun to work with, but it's not winning any awards for excessive brightness. It looks cool, but definitely for aesthetics only, and not for illuminating anything else. 

And thanks for the encouragement! I have built a board. And then another board, and then another board, then an experimental combination of two old boards, and uh oh, its happening again. Lol. Shit, I'm only like two months into this hobby. :fearful:

I will definitely do some tinkering, and may have to learn how to router just because of this. Great, more tools, research and money. My wife is going to hate me.

Bought these lights on ebay, satisfied with their bright and compact size. But can't hold them on the truck properly and that will be too low to see the road clearly if mount them on the truck or deck. So came up the idea that put them on the backpack's shoulder straps and use PVC tubes to mount them more perfectly, can even change the angle of the light by twisting the tube itself and from this position the light can hit the road more ideally.

Ok, tonight's the headlight test.  Last night was supposed to be the test but there was a short and every time I hit a bump the whole system would reset, which was a bit disconcerting.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1be2cbd9ee2aa6854dd7860897e788c0a1be51a1.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Anyway these lights are pretty standard from SuperBriteLEDs.com driven by a 1000mA BuckPuck, have 20 degree lenses.  The two cool things about them are the aluminum mount brackets, which I machined out of scrap from another project, and "idle mode" where when the board is not moving the lights go to half brightness (pictured) but as soon as the board starts moving (even if you are pushing!) they go to full brightness.

Also when the headlights are on the TFT display goes to half brightness as well.

Thank you for your suggestion [torqueboards](http://www.) and I agree these are great. I have checked out many different lights to use as skateboard headlights, but these lights along with a similar designed light have performed the best so far. However, the mounting post and plastic clips they come with are not built to withstand the rigors of skateboarding, so I am looking into getting modifications done. I use a custom designed bracket to mount these which works great. With the right modifications, I think these lights will work well as skateboard lights. This is my board with headlight and tail light. My goal is to offer these lights to other skateboarders eventually from the Website I am building here: [Kngt Up](http://www.kngtup.com). If anyone is looking to purchase some headlights right now, I can't say for sure because I have not tried them myself, but it looks like Shredlights is offering a good skateboard light solution.

@Luke Im yet to install mine.  Was going to make a modified bracket and fix onto riser somehow.  Ideally you still want to be able to take it off.  So I was also going to cut up the bracket that the light connnects to.  Be interested to see your install. To bottom.  The front lights however are better above the deck to get better range of light.

Thank you for your comments. Yes, this is the same light to begin with and they work great. However, what I have found is the mounting post and clip are not strong enough and eventually break. The campaign is set up to fund the modifications to these components to make them strong enough to endure the rigors of skating. The modified lights will be included in reward along with the mounting brackets. I understand that seems expensive but getting custom molds made for the new parts is very costly.

Im getting an enertion steez remote, what do people think of this:
(I'm left handed) and the top one would be swiveling on an axis, maybe like what bike lights use to rotate if possible, otherwise the simpler version below with a regular flashlight.

Finally put my rear lights on the Raptor. From AliExpress Soul Travel store, but other sellers available there.

https://youtu.be/hZx4aKsxDTg

Was actually $25.50 US free postage.

Features, IPX4 waterproof, rechargeable 2000mAh battery, led rear light, turn indicators, various light modes, day/night auto detect on / off, lazer lights, wireless remote.

Was going to strap on the remote to back of steeve controller. The light needs a modified mouting bracket which I made of an aluminium C section and mounted on riser. Once mounted it cant be taken off without unscrewing it from bracket. 

Can be turned in via side button on light or remote.  Charger portt is in bottom of light via mini usb port.

Will do.  Tried to keep it simple.  Its just a small aluminium C channel that slots into the C bracket of  the light bracket.  The 2 C section is connected by the screw and nut of the original bracket.  Then 1 screw into riser at back.  Picture would help.  Will try when home and also confirm size of aluminium bracket. Just need to paint bracket black when I have the time.

Only just put them on, but agree.  The light has a plastic bracket which is a weak point and also the screw to the riser may loosen.  Need to put some locktite on and was thinking of connecting a wire tether to light itself.  Already lost a kicktail plate because it only came 3m taped.  The board takes alot of vibration.

If your riding on the road I suggest a hi vis jacket and also some good lights up front so you can watch out for any bumps. Slowet speeds recommended as you just dont know what you can hit.

I just brought a 1m long section of aluminium channel anspd cut it to size. Really smple and used a wood screw to fix to riser. Needs testing though as to how long it will stay in the board though. Theres alot of vibration. Will keep you posted on reliability.

Looks good man, but yeah, vibration will likely take the best of it.
I would suggest if you have some scrap metal layin around to make a plate with same holes as the risers and put it in between them.

The light sits under there at the perfect location and has a tapered angle on the bottom of the light. It clears the ground by at least 10mm. When I found the light I knew I could do something with it.

If its going to be above some how you  need to make a bracket and also mount it out of the way of where you put feet.  I have a Raptor with tail so cant mount on top.   Light is bright,  so you will be seen. Ill try and get night shot or at least from a distance,  so you can see what mine loomd like

@ra.rend not bad.  Mines really working with prebuilt,  but you could still use the Meilan light in any set uo as long as you have the height in the riser to mount bracket. Yours is more discreet.

I bought waterproof LED strips from Amazon. Used angle aluminum and removed some of the right angle in order to bend it like the deck contour. the wires tuck under battery lid and goto the main switch.

Lumen output is probably bullocks.. so would be great if someone tried them and can show the beam these lights throw off!

I think the real one could perhaps be close to 3000lm, as I assume these should start to compete with car's headlights

As for the price, this listing also comes with a headband, so I assume there should be a cheaper model with less accesories..

http://www.banggood.com/3x-CREE-XML-T6-LED-Headlight-Front-Bike-Bicycle-HeadLamp-Head-Light-p-1001961.html?rmmds=search

These are the ''chinese'' ones.. so there might be some hidden defects, like defective switch button or loose battery connection.

Thanks for the response! I wanted to include 2 led light version but could not find it anymore. 

Yes, someone complained about the switch and i also had to fix my chinese headlights switch by holding it in place with similar material to plastidip / plastaline.

Is the beam ok? Is it uniform? I hate leds which has spotlight reflector.. light in very narrow beam is not great

neopixels are pretty simple. my new lights use them.

this libary and examples are the best place to start.
I would use a 5v trinket because you only need 1 pwm pin for lights. you can use the others for buttons. or the builtin button i think.

If you are crafty and willing to build / get a led driver.. try to search for 3w led chips or such.. I think i've seen them in purple color.

U can also try these nobrand ones.. will be cheaper but also possibly less light for the same watts..

Check color spectrum / look also, have not used / tested/ seen much of these uv/purple leds in real life

Just used the standard bike mount. Does the job although running into a wall would kill the light. Not sure that mounting to my truck hanger would be much safer since the bottoms of my trucks get a fair amount of hits and wear. Thanks to Michaelinvegas, I got a set a Shredlights on order. Should solve my issues.

I printed at 50% infill using ABS.  It seems pretty tough.  The light is not great for seeing stuff, but it's definitely visible to oncoming traffic.  The camera is pretty good, as good as my old Go Pro anyways.

This is the light and camera that I use.

You know, at first it was a joke. But people see me from and that's the whole point for me, the places I ride are lit up enough, but its still scary that nobody sees me.

So, I made a version 1 of my LED light control box.

It is a simple +/- input from 12v to 55v. Just splice power from the battery and clip in the wires into the terminals.

There are three outputs. One for steady on, for headlights. And the other two are for special lighting effects.  You can use any led light that requires 12v. It can handle a total of 3amps. 

The steady on and lighting effect terminals are on separate switches, so you can turn them on/off individually.  You can also turn off the special effects through its remote, which also controls the different lighting effects.

That was the first print, and it works quite well! I need to change some sizing for my board it goes past the edge of the board (which I don't really want) but I think revision 2 will work quite well and I'll post the stl files then. I've also got a rear module in the works that has motor wire management and no headlight fixture.

From experience @lowGuido I can tell you the flicker (for me) was caused by the battery shaking around. The spring on the inside is not very strong relative to the weight of the battery. So...
Stronger spring?
or Just stretch the spring out a bit more so it applies more pressure :grin:

Just wanted to share my lights set up. 

If I had money to spare I would have gone with Shred Lights for sure - its just simple and works!

DIY method I have decide to use cheap Ebay LED torches P Clip clamped to the truck kinda like Shred Lights. 

Lights - £2.14 each plus shipping

Rubberised P Clips - approx £2 for pack of 2-3 as two different sizes are needed.

25 mm to mount at front ( thicker) part of the torch

14-15 mm for the slimmest part of the torch

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/P-Clips-304-Stainless-Steel-Rubber-Lined-Pack-Qtys-1-2-5-10-P-Clip-Clamp-W4/221393085611?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=520267944693&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649


Here are pictures of torches just with 1 P Clip. Second one will be mounted soon ( waiting for delivery). This will ensure that they don't come off or rattle while riding. 

Since I have angle risers I had to get 50mm M5 bolts. 

I also have ordered rear red torches - same brand and model :) 

Total Cost - £4 per light x 4. Shred Lights - £75 for set of 4 ...

@sayreul here is link to red one.
https://www.ebay.co.uk/i/222462250075 

Unfortunately as the torch has screw on bottom ( for battery AA replacement) it unscrews itself off while riding and also on off butting is there making it either switch off the flights or change it to flashing mode by itself . All due to vibrations. 

I haven’t had tome to look into fixing it somehow so I took lights off for now. 

Also the P clips due to vibrations rattle against truck base and are horribly loud ;( 

Might need to put a bit of rubber between them.

Perhaps I will tape on the screw on part of torch so it doesn’t come off. Not sure if it will work at all. Fuc**g vibrations!!! ;(

I have a headlamp I'm thinking of mounting to the board. It's really bright and durable. My kids actually brought it in the tub with then and it still works. I barely use it so I figure it would be good for the board. I also made an altoids light that I want to find a place for.

They are WS2812, you can find them very cheap in China, I bought 100 of them for $10,00

They are RGB and individually addressable, so you can't just feed 5v and hope if lights up, an arduino or similar micro controller is required to make them work, even the VESC can control them

Yep, exactly that, this is my second version of the light itself, but the code to run everything is already working, I've used the it on my previous board for more than a year and hundreds for kilometers 

It's easy to implement because I use the arduino itself as my receiver, but even if you use the GT2B or any other PPM receiver you can connect and arduino to the UART on VESC and use the current data to determine if you are braking or not

Unfortunately UART is not a BUS as far as i know, so you can only have two devices, but you can give a try to the VESC firmware with ws2812 support, i never used it, but its supposed to work right out of the box, maybe you have to change how many LED's are connected, but them you would have to recompile it

Thanks!

I think what you're doing ( 3d printing enclosure for front and back lights) is the way forward. This way they are very secure, wont rattle or come off, and it is a customisable cheap solution. They might not look amazing ( PLA/ABS quality) but they could be printed in resin :) 

I might design my own, as so far I haven't been able to find any cheap substitute to Shredlights that works. Also not having to change batteries/ charge them is additional advantage.

Yeah, the quality is not so much of a problem, people tend to treat printed parts as finished, but that is not true if you really want a quality looking, at least in hobbyists level prints

If you take the time to prime sand and paint you can't tell that the piece was printed 

One future step is to send my enclosure, that is also 3d printed to Shapeways, they can print it in one piece in SLS, with should give a way better result

Just finished assembling my head and tail lights. The mounts are 3D printed and designed to mount underneath the trucks in place of 1/4" risers. They are powered by 12v and are controlled by a custom LED controller I made. I'll cover all of the features of that controller and the app used to change settings when I post about my complete build later this week. The headlights use oval lenses that cast the light in a narrow horizontal beam so the majority is kept on the ground and not in peoples eyes. The taillights use red LEDs covered by a transparent red cover to create a solid bar of light.

I've tested few "deck" light products but have noticed that it was not enough. Visibility was mildly improved but due to short light reach it was only enough for low speeds where you have more time to react to something. The lights however helped with others seeing me better which is also important. What I ended up with was ShredLights on the board and this on my head :) It's on the 360 degree rotaing GoPro base and I keep it pointed low to avoid blinding others.

Just made this, it is remote controlled (on/off), powered entirely off of VESC 5V line and shines light 15m ahead. Center of the light is focused 5m ahead of the board. Pictures taken in the darkest dark I could find. Under street lights you can still see the light on the ground... pretty powerful for night riding. I dont use any additional hand held lights with these.
I had brake lights too but when I had them there the other lights would dim a little when I was braking so I removed those...

@Pimousse Wow with 5W you’ll need a large heatsink... otherwise they might burn out in 10 minutes. I would go for lower wattage - perhaps but 3W but more of them! Keep us updated !

Thanks for the warning.
I hooked the PWM pin of the driver to an Arduino so I'll lower the current.
What do you suggest ?

Here's the (small) heatsink (picture shows a prototype, now it's attached with thermal paste) :

Excellent job! That's some damn fine EL wire detail.  I think you've set new high water mark for artistic design and creative lighting. That would be awesome if you could add a battery level indicator in the form of a single red LED with a couple little red LED rings (like a bulls eye/target) to the girl's eyeballs. When her evil eyes are glowing big and red, it's fully charged, and they get smaller as voltage drops. Definitely post up some night/dark pics too. I sure do love me some EL wire. :thumbsup:

Here are some 12v head and tail lights I created to fit caliber trucks (they may fit others).The headlights are designed to hold two 20mm oval lenses over the LEDs to create a nice spread on the ground that keeps the light out of the eyes of passersby. Both mounts house custom PCBs that are linked on each page.

```
Stick with stepping down from the batteries, but make sure your converter can handle the wattage of your lights (i.e. 12v @ 1A = 12W). When you step the voltage up,  the current at the input of the converter increases to produce the same wattage (12W = 5v @ 2.4A). The vesc 5v can only supply about 1A so the setup in my example would damage it. When you step the voltage down though, the input current to the converter decreases since the voltage is increased (12W = 24v @ 0.5A). With batteries its usually preferred to step down rather than up.

Not directly. But,  you can measure the current through the lights when they are powered with the correct voltage,  then multiply those two numbers together to get the wattage.

## \#463 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2017-11-25T18:32:16.447Z Reads: 499

It really depends on how much current the lights draw. If they're just some 10mm LEDs or something, then you might be able to get away with powering them from the vesc, but if they draw more power, then the only options you have are either power it from the main battery, or add a little extra battery just to run the lights.

Those look like commercial lights, so they should have a rating on them, e.g. 12v 300ma or 12v 5w. If not, you can use a multimeter to check the voltage and current.

You put the multimeter in series in the circuit in amps mode and power flows through it, they will have a rated max amps on the multimeter but usually fused so if you go over you just have to replace a fuse (too much and I've heard they can blow in your hands but shouldn't be an issue here).  The Watts is just volts*amps so if you have two meters you can get that accurately if not you can measure no load voltage then multiply the amps you measure by volts to tell you watts.  For a given component (LED in this case) you can measure the voltage drop from one side of the component to the other and multiply by the amperage to know the watts.  Example say you have 500mA at 5V that's 2.5W (0.5A * 5V = 2.5W)

I always fall back on this:

I bought a 3 LED version which lasted one night, and then I got the 2 LED version which lasted about 10 minutes. There is a coil inside that is free floating above the circuit board. On the 3 LED version it looks like it shorted out a little chip at R2. On the two LED version the coil fell off the solder points. I will try soldering it back on. I think it needs some big gobs of silicone to prevent the coil from moving around.

Yes, the low angle accentuates the cracks and fails to reach far enough ahead. On top of deck is a little better. It is slick having it all under the board but not the best angle for down road illumination at speed.

I have a few different light bars on a few different boards.  I am not yet good with step down electricity and what not so I have kept it simple. Just plug my lights into the  remote control's receiver free channel ports (Example my VESC uses channel 2 then I have channels 1 and 3 free to run the lights)  It's really good for noobie'ish builders like me that are just in our first year (6 months).  Just beware the receiver only receives about 5.1v from your VESC. I don't know if that is configurable in the vesc-tool.. haven't looked around for it.

Look here -- $7 on Amazon:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013SSO70Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Then I just glue then into enclosure with a hot glue gun. Never failed me.. been riding the board for about 2 weeks now to work thru snow and hell.  Front lights are white and rear are red... all on the same circuit so just uses 1 channel on your radio...

I have the same LEDs and was afraid to connect them to the Vesc directly because everytime I read about LEDs I read about resistors depending on voltage. But it seems that these lights don't need that much power so maybe they don't need a resistor. Maybe someone knows...

Well, not directly into the VESC...Into the receiver for your remote. That receiver is powered by the VESC's PPM port for the remote.  Maybe that's what you meant :slight_smile:

Oh directly to the PPM port... I have not tried that.  Did you measure the volts?  When I measured on the receiver connected to the PPM port... I got 5.1V

I tried my setup on a my Trampa Carver board as well. The light bar up front fires up fine.  But the bar on the rear only has two lights... 5v not enough I guess :frowning:  Was my own dumb fault really... the Amazon listing for that one said 6v minimum. So about 2 of the 5 lights light up.

Pretty sure none of the voltage regulators on the VESC can supply enough amperage to power all the LEDs.  Personally running mine off a 1S separate from my main battery but using a buck converter can drop the voltage down to something reasonable for the LEDs from your main battery

https://www.amazon.com/eBoot-LM2596-Converter-3-0-40V-1-5-35V/dp/B01GJ0SC2C/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1513548979&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=buck+converter&psc=1

If you're running 10S or higher you'd need ones that can support that voltage but anyhow that's the gizmo for "efficiently" dropping the voltage.  Alternative to the buck booster above there are "linear voltage regulator" ICs as well but believe they bleed off power as heat rather than switching a gate open/closed:

http://www.linear.com/product/LT8697

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giGRrODKJSE

Can easily figure out you LED circuit values by putting in the rated voltage/amperage for the LEDs

Hi guys!

Im in the process of figuring out what lights I should put on my new board! :slight_smile: 

I had my eyes on something minimalistic like this [10CM 12V LED COB](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/2Pcs-Set-New-Design-DRL-LED-Daytime-Running-Lamp-Auto-COB-Light-100-Waterproof-Free-Shipping/1959441498.html).

Since I will be running my board at 12s, I chose this [DC/DC 55V to 12V 3A Converter Step Down](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Car-Auto-DC-15V-55V-24V-36V-48V-to-DC-12V-3A-36W-Converter-Step-Down-Module/281848477612?_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D47301%26meid%3De622a0d86fa64554895bed65a6d6469d%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D262877030319&_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851) to take power from my main batteries to power the LED bar. 
![s-l1600|500x500](upload://jG8Of2y4HIWO76p4oZanSSQnOeA.jpg)
The effect of the led bar is said to be 2.7W and my step down converter will put put out 36W. Is this a problem or will the LED bar be able to handle the power?

The LEDs will only draw as much current as they need, so they will draw around 2.7W but the converter is capable of supplying 35w.

In the beginning I had both hooked up to one, 1.6 A for both is well within the specs, but it got quite hot and, meh, I got 10 of those so...

I don't know if I should be ashamed or proud of my mounting solution. Stupid simple but works like a charm. I had some large heat shrink laying around. I poked holes in it to put it over the truck mounting screws making a loop, 
stuck the flashlight in, 
torch, 
PROFIT! 

I even kinda like the look of it.

I've been working on exactly that for a couple years now and plan to make a post about my project soon(ish). Some pictures of the lighting controller and my board [can be found HERE](https://www.instagram.com/mattsauve/).

The lighting controller takes 15-50v in and allows you to control nine PWMed 12v outputs: 1 head light, 1 tail light, 2 RGB side LED strips, and 1 auxiliary port (for a horn). It also provides a 12v output for any 12v devices people want to add to their board (Im thinking a speaker system).

The lighting modes include 2 static modes and 5 dynamic modes. The static modes are ones that are not influenced by the ride at all. The dynamic modes use (depending on the mode) a combination of data from the ESC and an on board 9-DOF IMU.

To control the lights and motor the user has 3 options: a PPM remote, a Wii Nunchuck remote, or the Android app. The PPM remote allows the user to turn the lights on and off. The Nunchuck allows the user to turn the lights on and off and cycle through modes. The Android app provides an interface to customize the lighting modes, monitor all motor characteristics in a graphical view, monitor IMU data in a graphical view, get stats about your ride including a google maps view of the route, and control the motor with a dynamic remote.

> Will you have kits available??

Yes, I will eventually. I just ordered the latest version of the HW and am working on polishing the firmware and android app. Once I assemble and test the HW heavily, I will make a thread to gauge interest in kits. I'm hoping to do this within the next 2 months.

> Does it have the ability to control addressable strips?

Not as of now, but that would be a great addition for v4.0 of the HW. The module currently controls only 12v analog strips for the side lights.

> can it connect to the UART port of say, a FOCbox for speed?

Yes, it can connect to any VESC based ESC through I2C and all of the data from the ESC can be viewed in real-time on the app. That said, I currently only own a v4.12 VESC so I have not created/tested firmware for any others yet. I have an ESCape (HW6.4 based ESC) on the way and will be altering the firmware for that to work with my system. For ESCs I do not own, I am thinking that I will create libraries for communicating with my module so that anyone could add them to their VESCs firmware if it has not already been done.

Here are some screenshots of the main interface tabs of the app. The second picture is of the motor info tab. On this tab you can view the current values of all of the ESC data and plot them on the graph at the top by checking the check box next to the value in question.

I'd be up for some hardware beta testing as soon as you're ready! I'm currently doing this with addressable strips and an arduino but have a new build coming together that I would like a more complex driver for it.

Also wondering if since you said it can be controlled by an app, that means it has bluetooth... Sooo I was curious if it could also pass communication on to Ackmaniac's VESC app so we could connect to UART for speed data and we wouldn't need another BT adapter.

_Btw you should create your own thread so we can subscribe to it for updates!_

Cool I'll definitely need some testers to make sure the system works on different set-ups.

Yes, it has a BLE module built in so in theory it could pass info from the ESC to the Ackmaniac app. However, to accomplish this, I would need to know the communication scheme used by Ackmaniac and then have my module send out that data.

Thanks for your support. Once I assemble and test the first v3.1 HW, I will make a thread and look for a few people like you to test the system in their boards :smile:

just wrapping up my first build.... ended up fabbing a rear light holder from 1x1 wood dowel, but have a 3d print file which i may get fabbed at some point.... but did get a 3d print for the front light and added a couple holes in a block as a tool holder too... the best part  NO VIBRATION NOISE... pure beautiful silence!

Yes I imagine Nylon would last a very long time, only downside with Nylon with regard to 3d printing is the difficulty of printing with it (absorbs water, doesn't stick to anything except PVA glue, doesn't let go of PVA glue, slippery and hard so difficult for extruder gear to grip and push it, warps, etc etc.)

So, I have had great success with Nylon. WolfBite Nitro works great for the print bed and releases with water. I also use cheap Nylon from Micro Center in So Cal. http://www.microcenter.com/product/485160/175mm_Natural_Nylon_3d_Printer_Filament_-_05kg_Spool_(11_lbs) Unfortunately, it only comes in Natural.

Agree with TPU I use it for all my quad stuff which typically endures some pretty high impact forces.  I had the polycarbonate shell on a go pro crack and the TPU mount holding it on was fine (replaced the loops that were polycarbonate with TPU ones epoxied onto it).  The tpu is pretty rubbery feeling so it's great for absorbing impacts.  Only down side I see with it is can be a bit tricky to print with (especially with bowden tube) it can stick to the PTFE tube and can get bound up in the extruder (loops back on itself because it's not rigid at all).  Also don't expect to be making any substantial support material with it since it all droops and oozes together.

Oh I know, the current board is pretty slow and I typically ride it about 10 miles per hour most the time because there's a stop sign every block and the roads are terrible. And I only have to ride it about a mile a day I learned how to ride a board before I learn how to ride a bike, I'm more confident on a skateboard that I am walking some days. I do agree I need a helmet. I've just done a lot of downhill stuff going well over 40 miles per hour.

This is mine, I made a mount to bite around the cutout for the double drop and I'm going to TRY to open up this light and swap the lense. Right now it will shine from on side of my block to the other in a straight beam... its nice, but i want more of a flood. It also has a wide operating range (12v-80v) so no matter what battery setup ur rocking it can plug right up to it and not have to worry about any converters. 

The duct tape is there for wire management. I don't want to accidentally step on wires so yea

These lights work on 3.7v, but I would like to hook them up to my battery
[/quote]

@L3chef because i didnt knew that was a option/how to do that :sweat_smile: Im still relatively new to all of this, im more of a luker/reader then a poster. I know n00bs can be horrible with question an no research. 
Would you have a link on how to do that properly?

Remove battery from light. Find the black neg and red pos wire. Hook em up to a free chanel on your ppm reciever. 
I can take some pictures later.when I'm back home

I wouldnt recommend doing that. Failure or overload in the lighting system will take down the control of your board.

use ubec with builtin protection or separate fuse

Just picked up these. Look like an update to the older blitzu. Probably paid double than the older style from eBay but oh well, these are pretty sweet.

Using the 168T and its quite bright. the slow blinking is nice as well but I'd recommend fastening them tightly to the strucks as its fallen once before but its probably cause I had them on quite loose as its stopped falling now

It's a 7000 lumens rechargeable bike light incl. back light. It got 2 18650 batteries inside so you should be able to change them to Samsung 30Q and it will last forever. And for only $20 this seems like a steal.

I was thinking of getting some velcro, but in every store they told me it won't handle the stress. How about put it directly to desk with 2 side tape (holds 500kg per meter)? Power bank weight is 130-140g and measures are 138x69x9.2mm

i hope the gopro light holds up for you... maybe pnuematics will help with vibration... my light still worked at time of replacement but it was actually the gopro mounts that cracked or the angle adjust arm you have attached could never be tight enough and the light would fall foward or back... i ended up having to fab it into a fixed position =)

I've not actually ridden with it on yet so have no idea how durable it is.
I hope it holds up too.
It is quite light and a very tight fit in it's mount so I can't imagine it falling forward or back under normal road use.
Only time will tell.
Going to have to do some aggressive off-road midnight riding now to test it to the max...

Tossed a small light that has decent range on my remote since my shred lights don't really help me see rough roads ahead. Could definitely be better but it actually works pretty well. Will probably do something similar with a stronger light when I get my benchwheel remote for my hummie deck.

My friend got a 3d printer so I decided that I wanted to make a light mount for my board. I designed it with the following specifications in mind:

- Had to be modular
- Quick to install
- Vibration dampening
- Elevated off the ground to avoid long shadows
- Compensate for angled front end of evo deck
- Still be able to acess mounting bolts for trucks

Here is what I came up with:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhqFTL-WwXs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jCEHGOudWo

The blue vibration isolating parts are TPU and the black parts are PLA. If you would like the files feel free to ask.

Here is my $25 DIY solution.  The purpose of these lights is to make me more visible, not to light up the road in front of me.  The lighting is on it's own circuit and can be turned off/on with a switch.  Powered by a 2200mAh Lipo, I can get about 5 hours of run time (LEDs have 400mA working current) before needing to recharge the battery.

According to the description on Amazon, those lights can take an input voltage ranging from 9-32V, but your pack can go as high as 50+ volts. So you would need a step down converter of some sort to reduce the voltage.

Something like this should do the job: [https://www.amazon.com/DZS-Elec-Synchronous-Rectification-Adjustable/dp/B07BMVX9MS/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1536706668&sr=1-8&keywords=voltage+buck+converter+48v](https://www.amazon.com/DZS-Elec-Synchronous-Rectification-Adjustable/dp/B07BMVX9MS/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1536706668&sr=1-8&keywords=voltage+buck+converter+48v)

Are u US based? I was looking at a similar pair but were more a flood pattern than spot.. Regardless ... I have the buck converter u need =) if youre interested, and based on your current board setup I'll trade you the buck converter pre wired and soldered with what youd need for easy plug n play...

Hi everyone. So many cool lights!

I want to fit some lights onto my board which use an on/off switch on it's own circuit that's powered by the main battery. I've noticed some people go on about their remote and receiver units.

Question:
1. How can I set up a brake light that shines brighter when I put my brakes on?
2. Is there a way to use the remote to switch on the lights (this receiver 2 thingy). I've got the Enertion Nano-X.

I want to set up a front and rear light but want easy control of those lights. A brake light feature would be ace.

If anyone has any guides/wiring diagrams I'd really appreciate it!

It's not the most beautiful thing... But I DIYed it and it's working.

Cree whatever cheap Chinese flashlights that break from all the vibrations.. So they're useless unless you mod them. 

Removed the battery part /switch and soldered on a usb cable so that the two lights are connected in series.

Runs off your everyday powerbank!

Anyone tried to put leds inside a Hummie deck? I'm thinking is going this way, these lens that I bought are really small and together with some 3W 220lm Leds produce a nice beam

I may go WS2812b addressable led on the back on a cavity and them cover them with clear resin

The front will be the lens, only have to decide between 2 or 4 leds

What you guys think?

If you're using it on a MTB then you could use a bike handlebar extension like I've got. This will help raise the height a bit.

Can you give a clear picture of the mounting setup? I want to see how you did it vs how the manufacturer thinks it should be done. One of the aluminum fins that holds the tiny nuts in is getting bent and mangled pretty bad in multiple spots from all the vibrations and leverage this heavy light has.

I thought I share my experiences with this 12V/18W LED light here (width about 15cm/6inch).

![203018|690x388](upload://vGzEvC5qrQUo4aOIkTOiRPEU7au.jpeg) 

I bought a flood and a spot version but the spot is much better. I wanted to mount it on my MTB but realized the poor illumination level so close to the ground like this:

When holding it in my hand it's much better and I see everything. Next step is to find out the minimum height from ground with good visibility. This was the first test:

So this inspired me to try  "integrating" an easy way to mount lights to your remote, and I figured what better platform then Picatinny rails? So I've made a rough mockup for the Feather remote, any feedback? The second image shows a possible use case with some part I found on Thingiverse that is a flashlight holder, but truthfully any gun light should work. What's cool as well is that you can use GoPro lights just by getting a Picatinny to GoPro mount

EDIT: would work well with something like [this](https://olightworld.com/led-flashlights/safety-and-self-defense/olight-pl-2-valkyrie)!

I really like this setup. Focuses light where you look. Retroreflective tapes shine brightly. Bright.  Rechargeable. Cheap.

I tried several different configuration of board mounted lights. They all suck. Vibrations make them rattle, come off loose, don't focus light where I want, create annoying Shadow on ground.

You are looking for a very cheap electronic piece called a "buck converter." They can be found on ebay for around $3 but take like a month to get to you. There's a small screw (potentiometer) that can be dialed to give you the correct output voltage. Good luck!

Check out reviews looks like hit or miss but mostly miss so a bit of a gamble there, people saying caps blew up, not sure if the caps were installed backwards or just bad caps? hard to say but just letting you know small gamble there, let us know if you order and it works out.

Still running mine off the 1S battery but it would be nice to grab one of these higher voltage buck converters and not have to charge another thing.

Probably knockoff but they work quite nicely - with around 1-1.4A output. Convoy flashlight Store on Aliexpress I think sells authentic Cree stuff  
  
On my last build I used those round SMD LEDs with little legs hanging around, tho only managed to use 4x~700mA @ 3.8V which was roughly 10W? with lens they were quite good for the speed of the board, and quite blinding when coming right towards you  

Front 10W lights

rear 5W lights

[Question] On my new build, I plan on adding a high power Cree XHP50.2 and one of those XMLs (1.4A @ 4.2V). The first with 10-degree lens and second one 45-degree one. Maybe I'll do them double. But due to low placement of lights, I'm thinking of adding the helmet a another XHP with 10-degree lens.  
  
I could add board lights' angle adjustment remote mechanism with +/- 25 dergees, altho I think it would be totally pointless on a board? Better to have remote lights' control for the pulsewidth, or just have one light permanently on 10% mode and then a high light which you turn off/on depending how it would obstruct oncomers?

I bought these lights rated at 12v and 15w, but god damn they are pretty dim, I wanted to integrated them as you can see. Anything of the same size-style available that you know of? It's either diy those lamps, or making another enclosure with more space.

I've got a question for you people. My brother wanted me to make him an electric skateboard from the Vanguard deck, and he wants it flexy. Would this be a problem when mounting LED light strips on the bottom of the deck? I'm not sure if the bottom of the deck stretches or not, so I don't know if the light strips would follow the deck or just snap, and I also don't know how to mount light strips in a way that this flexing wouldn't tear up the adhesive. (I suppose a stapler might work lol) Has anyone done this before? :slight_smile:

1 3/8" stainless u-bolt 9$. fit over the truck body, clearance to tighten nuts, perfect fit for holes lining up. used spare bushing to get rid of a little more of the long shadowing, and a neoprene ring to help with the vibration. works like champ and is rugged as hell! I feel confident picking up the board buy the light! This light is stupid bright, oncoming traffic hates me. at least they see me, right?

In my opinion why waste more space and more batteries that need to be charged when you can easily run off yur main power source with a small converter....just makes sense... Its led so doesnt kill to much juice.. And besides how much night riding in one shot could one do.vs in daylight before needing a charge? Its a minimal loss in capacity if you ride full to empty...

What orientation do you print this out in and do you have to use supports.  Sorry only just getting into this 3d printing.  I managed to get the file into cura v4 and sliced into gcode and  printed out work new cr10S in the orientation in the photo but it didn't work out very well.
