I have been doing some research on vacuum forming and laying carbon fiber cloth but I need a bit of help.

I understand you need the carbon fiber cloth, the epoxy and epoxy hardener (2:1 ratio), the release agent, accessories (gloves, scales etc.), 

Would this work: http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/Products/carbon-fibre-laminating-starter-kit.aspx ? Thanks for any replies!

im not sure that kit will be big enough to make a battery box. if that's what you are doing.

plus that kit does not include any peel ply or bleed cloth and barely enough PVA (imho)

if its just the experience you want then that's a pretty good kit. although you will need to buy all the vacuum bagging equipment as well.

In the video the company posted they didn't use a vacuum bag. They put release agent on, epoxy on, carbon sheet on, epoxy on, carbon sheet on,epoxy on, carbon sheet on, epoxy on.

Yeah you can do it that way. It wont yield the best results though.

the thing about carbon fibre is that it is light and strong. this maximum strength density can be achieved with vacuum only.
you can lay it up like fibreglass and paint the resin on with a brush, but you wont get a perfectly even resin coat and you end up with a thicker layer of resin than required. the resin is heavier (relatively) and you end up getting a weaker heavier product. which if its just the carbon look that you are after is fine, but if you are going to use the carbon for its intended strength density (that you are paying for) 

vacuum bag is the way to go.

yup. that's why carbon fibre things are expensive.
the actual carbon is relatively cheap, but there are loads of consumables and other equipment that make it expensive.

For enclosures only i think a vacuum setup is overkill.  I have all the parts to start playing with vacuum bagging now so i've been doing a lot of research.

I got my supplies from Fibreglast.  Not cheap.

Film/bag - [url=http://www.fibreglast.com/product/Stretchlon_800_Bagging_Film_1688/Vacuum_Bagging_Films_Peel_Ply_Tapes]Stetchlon 800[/url]
Release Film - [url=http://www.fibreglast.com/product/low-temperature-release-film-1580/Vacuum_Bagging_Films_Peel_Ply_Tapes]Low Temp Perfed Release Film[/url].
Breather Fabric - [url=http://www.fibreglast.com/product/Breather_and_Bleeder_579/Vacuum_Bagging_Films_Peel_Ply_Tapes]4oz Breather/Bleeder Fabric[/url].
Sealant Tape - [url=http://www.fibreglast.com/product/gray-sealant-tape-00581/Vacuum_Bagging_Films_Peel_Ply_Tapes]Gray Sealant Tape: (½" wide; 1⁄8" thick; 25 feet)[/url]. (you can also try cheaper "butyl" tape)

I also got some release *Fabric* to compare with the film.  Film is supposed to be shiny but perfed may pull too much epoxy out.  The fabric gives a matte texture and less epoxy is lost.  Not sure so will try both.
Not exactly what i got - but here's the Fibreglast [url=http://www.fibreglast.com/product/econostitch_peel_ply/Vacuum_Bagging_Films_Peel_Ply_Tapes]Release Film[/url] ( i got the [url=http://www.amazon.com/WEST-SYSTEM-879-2-Systems-Release/dp/B007I908NU]West System 879 Release Fabric[/url] instead).

So that's the materials.  Then you need vacuum...

Two options - a vacuum pump (1 or 2 stage).  1 stage is loud, 2 stage is quiet and faster and more expensive.  You can google how to make a vacuum pump from an air pump/compressor or a refrigerator coolant pump.
[url=http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Robinair+vacuum+pump]Robinair or similar[/url] are well known in the AC/Automotive trades.  $$
Option 2 - [url=http://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Cutting-Tools-Venturi-Vacuum/dp/B00PWJJY6U]Venturi pump[/url] - hook up to your air compressor and it creates vacuum.
A third option - hand pump.  There is one in this [url=http://www.roarockit.com/skateboard-building/thin-air-press/tap-kits/thin-air-press-kit-14x47/]kit[/url].

Material - I've had good luck with some suppliers on ebay for relatively inexpensive CF.  I personally would practice with some GF/Fiberglass first until i felt comfortable doing it.

You might also look at vacuum forming ABS/Kydex as a start for just enclosures.  I'm planning on doing a layup like freshair on a deck so might also do the enclosure so it's more seamless...

Start reading lox!  tons of info out there.  one nice thing about fibreglast site in particular is their videos in each of the areas on the product.  lots of good info.

GL!

Had absolutely no experience layering carbon fiber or vacuum bagging, and here is my result

Learned some valuable lessons doing this layup, and would have changed a few things to get it to look it's best cosmetically, but all in all think it turned out alright considering I was rushed.....which happens to be the biggest thing I would change, is give yourself LOTS of time to get prepared and think things over. 

One thing I would recommend is to NOT use a roarockit vacuum bag if you plan on doing organic cures, waaay to thick to be used for curves. It is possible but you absolutely must use a plug!

A true mold can be made damn near out of anything...  but i'd be worried the ABS would be too flexible.  AND since epoxy is exothermic (see i did pay attention) when curing it heats up.  Heat and ABS might be an issue depending on temperature.

Ideally you have an absolute pristine surface, with MULTIPLE (seriously 10+ coats) of wax so it doesn't stick to the mold.  So between the surface finish of ABS and possible flex/heat issues i don't know if ABS would be a good mold material.

Someone who truly knows should chime in - this is my guess.

one time when I was in a rush i made a mold by putting the batteries and ESC on the board and vacuum bagging them and then using that as the mold.

it wasn't super pretty but I needed some thing fast and its still rocking today.

Yeah I guess it all comes down to what you are used to. I notice people even walk on the left side of the sidewalk down here. when I was in the US I kept walking on the left and wondering why I was bumping into everyone.

@lox897 if you are ever in Canberra hit me up. Im always keen for a skate.

oh also want to point out that that video was made 9 months ago It was my first proper video of my prototype board  that board had a $40 ESC with brakes disabled so I was a bit conservative. I have built more and improved components since then and I'm a lot more reckless now :P

so this is the split (I added the washer after. it didnt help)

I made some quick modifications with whatever I could find

this random bracket surprisingly lasted the rest of the skate.

went home to start on the repairs, (you may notice my box has easily enough room for another pair of 8000mAh lipo's although with the current 22km range I have never needed more.)

<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/1X/b0abbec5753bce68f8fe8fbae237b918b08b549d.jpg'>

I got some small carbon fibre off cuts that were laying around and epoxy'd them on top and bottom of the split hole.

<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/1X/24493f3cd469ee2f554ab61447aabf2d690e0877.jpg'>

i'll sand them down flush and re drill once the epoxy has set.

Nice work and that CF looks beautiful.

Have you though about adding a simple neoprene gasket or similar soft foam?  To help with vibrations and also seal up some of the dust as a bonus.  Just around the edge i think it might help!

I'm almost embarrassed to ask... but this is an aesthetics post right? Has anyone tried out carbon fiber vinyl? Obviously it provides none of the structural benefits of real CF, but it seems like the look and appearance of CF can be replicated this way. Car detailers do it a lot. It appears to be a simple solution if one only wants something to "look" like CF. I was surprised by how closely you can get it to hug corners with just a heat gun.

@lowGuido any tips on good vinyl to use?  I wasn't sure if it would mount to wood. Did you have to sand the paint off of your board first? I found a deck with the perfect shape and stiffness,  but U-G-L-Y graphics. I was thinking I would spray paint it or use vinyl like this to cover it up.

The best carbon vinyl is 3m all the way. You will have no problem applying it directly to the wood. So long as you thoroughly prep the area first. 3m also has an adhesive promoter that brushes on before applying the vinyl. I like to use it specially in any nooks and crannies that you want the vinyl to stick to.

I sanded one board before applying the vinyl and the other board i didn't. The board that I didnt sand has started to lift around the edges. so I guess sand and clean the board first.

I have used 3m vinyl as well as many other different no name brand ones. its hit and miss. I did get one no name brand that was as good as the 3m and a fraction of the cost, but I also got another that was rubbish.

the stuff that was good as 3m was this stuff:

Thanks @King1017 and @lowGuido. When you say that you sanded your board first, do you mean that you sanded it down to bare wood and then applied the adhesive promoter, or do you mean that you scuffed the painted surface for better adhesion? I'm going to give this a try on my new deck! Great solution to ugly graphics!

besides a final wipe with a tack cloth before applying vinyl - what did you wipe it down with?

I usually use denatured alcohol - anyone else use something else?

And a heat gun is helpful as well right?  I've only done some flat surfaces.

## \#42 Posted by: lowGuido Posted at: 2015-09-23T03:43:08.166Z Reads: 176

so what I did was sand down the deck and wipe it down. then I applied a coat of black paint. (originally I was going to lay one layer of real carbon so I didn't want the light wood peering out from behind the dark weave)

after considering the cost Vs the benefit (a lot Vs none) I decided to vinyl wrap it instead and perhaps leave the carbon for a full deck project later. so I put down the vinyl with a heat gun.

@lowGuido @King1017 I tried this tonight! I partially sanded my board, cleaned it with denatured alcohol, prepped with tack cloth, and then applied the adhesive promotor from 3M. Waited five minutes. The adhesion went well and the vinyl molded to every corner with little effort. I used my heat gun around the corners and at the drop just to get the vinyl to sink in.

But I wasn't able to make nice straight cuts to finish it off, as I trimmed away the remainder, I realized that I had no idea how to do it well! All of the instructions I watched online about applying carbon fiber vinyl were for car parts, where the vinyl edge is "tucked" somewhere and not visible. 

So here's the result:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/0d402c7106a827c2ccd4dc59b54a8cc4be97b80f.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Any tips on getting a straight line with vinyl? I'm going to give it another try!

I does look good, I understand your want for it to be perfect. I used to own a vinyl print and install place a few years back. Whenever I wanted a perfect straight line that followed an edge nicely I would use a vinyl squeegee  (the kind you use to help apply the vinyl) as my straight edge. I would put it between the surface that I didn't want to Mar up and my blade and smoothly cut.
There are videos out there demonstrateing what I'm talking about.

Also make sure before you start a cut to have a brand new sharp blade. Another tip would be for the size of cut it is to trim a skate deck you should try to do it one smooth cut without stopping

but for what you are doing it is totaly over kill. just get a new sharp blade and run it down the wood. same as if you were cutting the grip tape.

Looks awesome @lowGuido! I tried to follow the grip-tape method, but the vinyl doesn't have a much structure as GT, and it would fold and wrinkle as I cut. I'm wondering now if the blade I used was too dull. It was brand new as of yesterday, but I also used it to cut new grip tape for the board just before applying the vinyl.

Just a side note here. I know some people even go as far as to spray over top of the carbon vinyl with a nice clear coat. I think it gives a more realistic carbon fiber look. If you have some scrap it might be something to play around with.

Snap off blades are best for trimming vinyl you want a really sharp tip to trim vinyl nicely. I prefer NT Brand red dot stainless knife with carbon blades the seven section 30 degree ones (BAD-21P). 
I tried clear coat over vinyl and have had no lasting luck. I have not found a clear that is compatible with vinyl.

@lox897 I know this is a pretty old thread, but I found this video about laying CF and it looks pretty doable and the results this guy gets are excellent. IMO Check it!!
