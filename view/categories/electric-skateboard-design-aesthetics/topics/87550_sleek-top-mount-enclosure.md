Hi! I was wondering if anyone knew of a small sleek enclosure for top mounted batteries. I would like to fit a 10s5p of 18650 in it. The esc would be in a separate enclosure so just room for battery and bms. 

Thanks in advance!

Thanks @Grozniy

Has anyone used the beast box with a FOCBOX Unity?

I have some mini enclosures that look way nicer than that piece of junk.  I only have 2 left.  $30 shipped anywhere in the US.

Thanks! How long do you think you’ll have these? I’m still pricing together the parts list...
