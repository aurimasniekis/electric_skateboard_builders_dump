So the other day I decided to set up a long-board using some spare parts. I've seen a lot of cool builds using boards without kicktails. So I thought I'd see how I like that style of deck because I've always had boards with kicktails.

I had a  top mounted drop top deck laying around that I got for free. It arrived delaminated, and  I repaired it with some clamps and some glue. I had to wedge the trucks pretty hard to get the truck to turn right because this was more a slant drop deck.

 It rides all right, but I hate it. I feel so locked in that I feel trapped. I hate that I cant lift the nose. I hate that I can't ride of a curb with out scratch the shit out of it. Maybe binding would help with that but I'm not really into that idea of getting those. It feels slow when I kick it up to speed. Really the board just feels kinda dead, and just not as agile as I like.

I know exactly what you mean! I have a smallish cruiser board with a kicktail only on the back, and one day I tried riding it the other way around, so the kicktail was more of a kicknose. It was _awful_! Felt totally stiff and unresponsive. I turned it back around pretty quickly.

Lovely little board, light, a bit flexy with a really nice kicktail. Bout the same size as a regular skateboard too!

Cool looking board. I'm going to end up stripping this build for parts, and keep my eye out for a cheap deck for my first lipo build.

 I've been looking at downhill, freeride decks, and pool decks. But I'm not in a hurry. I've got that Jart10 build that needs to be finished first.

Not super cheap, but love the Omen Sugar deck - great longboard w/ kicktail.

i find turning to be the bane of my existence with stiff trucks for high speed and zero turning at the end of culdesac .
