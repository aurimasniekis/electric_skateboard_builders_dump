Hey guys and girls, 
I was wondering if anybody has had experience with removing a logo from underneath clear grip (tape?). 

I made a scratch to see if the logo is a decal that can be peeled off but it seems to be just paint. This is an inexpensive deck from Costco, I’m not even sure if this grip variety is common. 

Wasn’t sure where to start, so thanks! 
For reference:

That doesn't look like grip "tape" which normally you could peal off. This looks like a clear paint with glass or sand as texture. If that's the case you have to sand it all off to get to the logo!

Use a low grit sand paper and sand until the logo fades away

try a heat gun. heat up whatever paint that is and try peeling off the flakes...careful to not burn yourself in the process.
