Get some cheap polyester fabric from walmart for the breather. I'm assuming (ply press) means peel ply... for that you can use nylon fabric from walmart or a cheap hair care wax (sportin waves) instead.

Breather is important so air gets sucked out evenly. Peel ply is importand so the carbon doesn't stick to the mold.

Oh yea oops on the typo... don't know how that happened ðŸ˜‚ 
Anyway, thanks for the tips. Also, I should cover my mold and board in certain wrap right? And the layering should go:
Mold
Plastic wrap
Carbon fiber layers
Peel ply
Breather
Vacuum bag

Correct me if I'm wrong please ðŸ˜‚
