The only difference between the two is the housing. Same internals.

I'd like this too... My nano-x controller wheel is just a tad janky on the far ends of the throw.

If I could print a new thumb wheel or case, that would be great. I might end up trying to disassemble and draw something up at some point if this doesn't come up...

@onloop ... Any hope maybe for CAD files for personal modifications to our Nano-X controllers?

@onloop that would be amazing for those who want to print in a more reinforced filament

It'd also help me not have to manually measure the thing to design it into an enclosure to fit in my slide gloves, between the glove and puck, without crushing the thing ðŸ˜Ž
