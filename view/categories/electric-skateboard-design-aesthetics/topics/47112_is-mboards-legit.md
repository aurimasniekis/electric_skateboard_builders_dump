I was looking for cheap, non Tupperware enclosure solutions, and I stumbled upon the Mboards website, where I found this https://www.mboards.co/collections/diy-electric-skateboard-parts/products/battery-esc-enclosure. 
-Has anyone used this enclosure?
-Is the site legit?

He's legit just he's marking his stuff 20% over store value because fast shipping or something along the lines , anyways his enclosures seem to be solid, his components are from other reliable companies so you should be fine

I ordered a battery an esc and motors from mboards two weeks ago and chose one day shipping and he hasn't even shipped it out yet I later contacted him three days later and he said he would ship it out that Thursday and that was may 9th and I haven't gotten any emails except for an order conformation so I tried texting him calling him and emailing him and nothing so i'm beginning to get a bit impatient so i don't know what to do at this point.

I've had a very unpleasant experience with MBoards.  Made a purchase and didn't hear anything for two weeks.  Contacted MBoards by email and asked him to cancel the order.  He said no problem and that I would see a refund in 1-3 business days.

2 weeks later still no refund and he shipped the parts to me anyway.  Sent him a follow up email when the parts showed up and asked him what to do.  MBoards said that I had to ship the parts back to him on my own dime before I can receive a refund.

Filed a complaint with PayPal and am waiting to hear back.  MBoards is no longer responding to any emails.

looks like mboards has the same products as http://www.diyeboard.com/

I know DIYEboards was experiencing shipping delays due to some large orders, so maybe that impacted your order.  Jason at DIYEboards has been super responsive and open, though, so I knew what the delays were about.

I can't speak for those that have had bad experiences; sorry to hear.  And I can't speak for Mike at MBoards.  However, after meeting him for the first time last month, here is what I can say whether it matters to you or not.

Mike is young for a business man/entrepreneur.  He has a noticable spark and drive for the esk8 industry.  Like many vendors in the US he does purchase some things wholesale from a wholesaler or manufacturer.  With that said, many of these one man shows do have delays and/or need to adjust there business model for the future.  However there learning experience does involve real life people and there money.  

Over all, I feel from the owner of MBoards that he is learning the business.  Everyone started somewhere and for sure he is also starting.  I hope he pushes through and becomes a vet vendor.

yea but the consumer should be penalized for someone's lack of business acumen.

i watched this kid make a video about making his first board then opening up shop moments later.  it's another example of someone thinking they're a seasoned builder far before they're ready.

I don't disagree with you.  Before coming to market, it is extremely important to have your house in order.  Any haste and the consumer gets the short end of the stick.  With the growth of esk8 in the last couple years vendors and board companies are popping up like weeds.  And, there is a lot of cross over between skateboarders and YouTube personalities that want to be the esk8 parts vendor or board manufacturer.  I know there's actually a pretty awesome thread for those that want to know who's who in the vendor space.

I had to get PayPal involved then he apparently spoke with them and has shipped out my bms. But still after 15 or 20 messages  (email and text)  he just ignores you. I could have gotten faster and better service from china. But I like a lot of other people chose his store based off his word and videos. That mistake will not happen again. Slot of this would be understandable if he would just communicate  and let us know what's going on.  By the way may 16th I paid for 2 day priority shipping for a esc. Nothing no excuse no apologies nothing. Never again.

I had similar experience, paid a little extra for fast delivery and better quality checks etc but it took nearly a month to get my order, and shipped the day after I asked to cancel the order. I also had some technical issues and got very poor response. Overall I'd say Mboards sucks, they are expensive for what it is, you could get it cheaper from China, there is no quality checking etc. Really poor and unresponsive.

Wow! Just wow!

That response is like a child sticking their finger in the ear and go “LaLaLaLaLa...I can’t hear you! LaLaLaLa”

Many of us understand that these small Esk8 businesses uses our money to achieve minimum orders required by Chinese factories/manufacturers. In the end we get a lower price and they get a small profit. It’s like a mini Kickstarter with our awesome successful group buys. 

His response is pure verbal (finger) diarrhea. If you don’t respond to complaints and questions on the forum and then tell people that you don’t care, how is anyone supposed to stand by you even if you finally figure how how to properly run a business with ready to ship inventory?!

The owner seems way over his head. 

It also seems to be an indicator of a larger problem of people trying to "cash in" on the diy community so to speak, to make a quick buck on newcomers looking to build their first board. This isn't a cheap hobby, the average build is like what? $800+? So people are ready to spend their money and we get "businesses" reselling chinese parts with markup for profit. 

The most blatant example of this are motors, which are all chinese made and ordered wholesale by resellers with a logo added. While I appreciate/respect all the reputable vendors on here who also sell their own products(enclosures, batteries, mounts, etc.), I think the forum as a whole can do a better job of alerting people of cheaper options that aren't necessarily shittier in quality, but just takes longer to ship straight from the source.

I want to make it very clear that I am not mad about him being in the community, and I am not mad about him kind of being a jerk. I'm pissed because of how he sells ordinary parts, from other stores, with a massive markup, and without giving much credit to the original seller. Some examples are his ESCs (diyeboard, hobbyking), decks (skateshred), risers (skateshred), hardware (skateshred), enclosures (diyeboard, except for one), wheels (kegels, flywheels, MBS) , BMS's, grip tape (skateshred), skate tools (skateshred), and some batteries and connectors (hobbyking). I am also pissed because as a new buyer, you see this website, and you might actually buy stuff, which can lead to people thinking esk8 is more expensive then it is, and being deterred from building, or just make people spend more than they need to. He also appears to have a pattern of bad communication, and kind of disappearing. Long story short, he isn't anything special, so just buy from the original sources, and save money


Edit: This isn't about a few misplaced orders anymore. It is about the greater community

**Don't buy from MBoards.** There is absolutely 0 support even on social media, and my package only got shipped when I filed a complaint to my bank (ironically, I was trying to contact him to cancel it). He fought the claim and sent picture proof that he sent the package after I wrote the complaint while claiming he had sent it before.

He's in college, being young doesn't really excuse this many issues. I've bought parts from high school kids without issue. He just needs to admit he can't run it very well and stop, or start shipping out items properly. I haven't seen anybody buy from him and not get screwed over.

I think the problem might be him not actually having what you purchased in hand. The stuff he sells is Chinese stuff. I think he just orders if after a you hand him the money, he waits for it to eventually come from China and then sends it to you.

I literally know where @JLabs' charger came from in China but because he stocks them prior to posting it on his site I knew I would get it in 3-4 days instead of 3-4 weeks from China which is why I'm fine with paying for the profit he makes. The lesson MBoards needs to learn is to make everything a "presale" or pull off items that are not actually in stock.

Drop shipping with poor communication and what appears to be no rush on either end of receiving and sending. 

One day Mike is going to snap out of his youthful stupor and look back at this. He's going to realize he had a decent marketing machine behind him from youtube views and he could have turned this little endevour into a fun small business, but he squandered it.

I can relate pretty hard.

Asked for when the last item will be shipped no reply 

Sent him this 


Some wisdom from someone that's done this all before and had many people working for him in startup companies:
1 communication is the absolute key!!! If you can't supply something in a timely manner, or you have some sort of delay, Be HONEST! TELL people what's happening! most of the time people will cut you a break. 
2 deliver what you promise! If it's on the website as immediate dispatch then it has to be that, not two weeks later, again communicate...put it up as out of stock and have the date you can send it listed on the website
3 don't process credit cards if you can't send something in time, ASK the buyer if they don't mind a delay

Good luck in the future. Remember, people buy companies not products! Word of mouth is your advertising, not you tube.

YES. Many people on this forum confuse these companies.

 Diyelectricskateboard- American company that for the most part sells high quality parts with great customer service 

Diyeboard- Chinese company that sells cheap, shitty parts and has some lame ass customer service

Flipsky- decent for the most part, with pretty good customer service, but inconsistent and mostly shit motors

I would just like to say (amongst all the negativity) that I placed an order with Mboards for an anti spark switch a while back and got what I ordered within a week or so. While it might be a crapshoot to order from them, they do get some things through the door. Not applauding their bad business practices, but just adding my experience!

My guess is that MB is into electric skateboarding because it fits the image he wants to portray.  Saying he owns an online skateboard shop probably just feeds the "entrepreneurial" ego, especially when he gets to talk about it to his YouTube audience.

There is no passion here.  He doesn't live, breathe or dream about electric skateboarding.  So I don't think we should be that surprised that he doesn't want to hang with a community of enthusiasts.

I mean... he's just a kid and we all speak about him like he's a simpleton. I'd probably also avoid meetups if I was in that situation.

Anyway, as @monsterbuilder said, he's not really into esk8, he's into making a few bucks and his youtube channel. Which is fine, but deliver the damn stock on time then. It looks back on the DIY community when he's out there behaving that way.

Out of interest, he's probably still delivered more than @LEVer and you all still seem to like him ;)

For those of us that have been around, the quality of service and parts, is really all dependent on where he sources his shit from. He’s essentially a pass through. So, he’ll wait till he has enough to make the MOQ and place the order. Hence the odd delivery times of a week or more.

He doesn’t make or develop squat. All he makes is margin....He makes sure that he pushes out his product as fast as he gets it in, to avoid the waiting angst that is so very common in DIY. 

I guess if your looking for the cheapest prices...hey who wouldn’t. But you aren’t really supporting a person or company that is taking time to develop and involved in the esk8 community. 

Now ask yourself....Who would you root for? Who would you like to see continue? 

I live in Vegas. I’d never give him a cent of my money.

He’s shown me that all esk8 community means to him is, a note on his resume, a story to tell his grand kids, and of course cash in his pocket.

So...all you that keep buying from him...you are his supporters.....you support an imaginary esk8 owner that is just profiting from you without giving back to the community that he is profiting from.

Oh, I totally 100% agree with everything you said. 

We are on the same page. He hits order when someone else hits order unless he comes in here to educate us otherwise. 

Still, for newbies, they find him and think he's legit. And if he can source (however easy it is to order from AliExpress), products for other people and people get their shit and are happy... Well that's a business model. 

I'm not agreeing with it, I urge people to shop elsewhere personally when asked, tell them why, including all your deets... 

But I guess it's a legit thing to do. I don't respect it personally. Anyways. 

No need for a mic drop lol this whole thread seems to have been mostly anti mboards, I think we all already agree. If there are some satisfied customers, good for them most of all and second... It's not the end of the world I guess, I'd rather people order from Dexter, buildkitboards, unikboards, psycho, lhb, etc etc. But it's not my money when I give advice.

My opinion on CarvOn is biased because I ride and talk with Jerry. I hear his business plans and what he plans for the future in order to not have this delay issue he ran into this past year. He’s planning to get everyone their boards and is in talk with people to increase build numbers. 

I’ve never met MB so I can’t really speak about his intentions which I guess is how you all view CarvOn since you’ve never met him. The difference is that Jerry has been in this game for much longer. There’s no excuse for his lack of communication so that’s on him.

We are going off topic here but I will answer 

What’s going on with Carvon is indefensible by any one here.  Obviously, he is having some issues. We know he is trying to work them out and hasn’t fled to Argentina as you all saw on various Esk8Squad Videos. But slowly but surely he’s trying to make good on his orders. He delivered a drive to @nmagz3 after how many months? There is a lot he could of done to  mitigate the cascading issues amd delays that have arisen. Unfortunately, I nor anyone here has the  definitive answer to your questions, only Jerry can answer them.

If you ask me what I think, and that’s from an arm chair perspective ... I think he will make everyone whole. He’s pretty determined and the “others” have been helping and offering assistance. Of course till he makes people whole, he’s gonna get a lot of hate.

PS pulley kits are identical from both companies although the small pulleys look plastic from MB. Don't bother with there front enclosure if you aren't planning on running their VESC, nothing else fits I threw mine in the bin. It has a 5mm heat sink in the bottoms that takes up most of the room. 😩Got a 12$ box from Jaycar here in Oz that's ten times better.

Lol, I hadn't read this topic in a while and was reading up on the new messages. Out of curiosity, checked mike's channel and he posted a new video about a week ago. About halfway through and for the rest of the video. He seems to kind of talk about the current issues that he is facing which mirrors exactly what a lot of y'all recently said. Focusing on the business, shipping and the delay of, shortage of the pulleys, and the items and quality of them. I dunno if he kinda took a hint from this topic or it's the general problem everyone is facing and he just addressed them. He didn't really talk about the lack of communication though. It's like a child or a dog. Maybe if I don't look at it and ignore it. Then it might go away and doesn't exist, lol. Not advocating for or putting down. I almost bought some things from him but research and recommendations led me away. I just read this topic then watched the video and was amused.

Hey everyone! 

Haven’t been on the forums in a while. Stumbled on this thread. Been working hard on everything. We’ve read through everything and many great points have been made. We hear you loud and clear. 

Just wanted to put our two sense in since we really haven’t written anything on the forums in over a year. (Although we’d love to change that and share our builds and tutorials with new builders). 

In the beginning everything was pretty rough. The brand and support from everyone grew and grew each day so fast I couldn’t physically keep up with shipping, purchasing, communication, support, etc. I absolutely have no excuse. We just had a lot to learn not having been in the retail business before. 

Unfortunately our happy customers aren’t the ones out on the forums talking about us. 

We are happy to report that all of the concerns have been addressed and fixed as of 2019. 

Communication platforms have been streamlined, shipping times are down to 1-2 days, and higher quality parts are currently being worked on. 

We can’t wait to share more and more parts and original designs with you guys. 

Thank you all for keeping us in check. We absolutely needed all of this criticism to grow as a company and to serve you all better in 2019. We’d like to apologize to everyone that caught us during one of our many learning experiences. 

We’ve put a little video together highlighting where we came from and what’s ahead for MBoards:

https://youtu.be/E0V0dj8ahTY

Again thank you all again for your support and understanding. We’re super excited for 2019 and have a ton of big plans to contribute to the DIY Esk8 community. 

If anyone has any feedback, please shoot us a message on Instagram: @mboardsco

Not asking for anyone to come back and purchase from us. We just wanted to let everyone know that we’ve heard you and 100% care about all of you. 

Thanks again,
Mike Beard and MBoards Team

We’ll continue to look for ways to be able to lower prices. As the brand grows we’ll be able to replace older products with more customized products that would either cost less or just be higher quality so our customers get more for their dollar. We’re exploring a number of product options now and finalizing some designs that hopefully help accomplish some of what I just described.

When you buy an antispark and realise when you take the cheap paper sticker off its a lunacycle item you could have got cheaper on ebay but purchased because you bought into the whole I build this stuff myself videos, well thats just not cricket sir.  Not cricket at all.
Going to have to do some serious convincing to part anyone here with their money.  Too many have been burned by the whole diye train and as such until you do prove that you are not rebranding that rubbish then I for one will actively encourage new builders to go elsewhere. 
Sorry nothing personal just the facts of life.

Still here listening to feedback. And I appreciate all of the constructive criticism. 

All of the products we have on the site now only exist because people consistantly requested that we add them. I feel like many of our customers simply asked for us to add specific items so they could purchase what they needed while giving us a little something to keep the videos coming and to keep the channel going? I know some of our international customers preferred purchasing from the US for some reason. I’m not exactly sure, but once a particular item was asked for over and over again of course we had to look into it to see if we could get them what they asked for. 

I have not and will never add any products to our website with Ill intensions. 

The original products listed on MBoards way back when we started were my handmade battery packs and vacuum formed enclosures. Both of which I tediously made with love while breathing in way too much solder smoke and plastic fumes. I did it because I really cared about the people who watch the videos and the community. So when people asked me to build them packs or make them enclosures I felt like I should try to help them out. Same reason why I made boards for a people too, people kept asking. 

Had to eventually stop handmaking anything simply because it took too much time and my backlog just got too long and I felt bad for how long it would take me to deliver. 

100% have made mistakes in the past. No way around it. 

We are already working on making a lot of our own stuff and original parts. We’ll most likely keep carrying the generic parts as well just so people have options and to help fund the production of the nicer parts for the serious builders like all of you. 

I have personally packed every single order we’ve ever received, never any drop shipping. Has there been gaps in inventory and created awkward wait times? Absolutely. The downfall of having no inventory management experience prior to opening the store. But I still tested,  packaged, and shipped everything myself. 

You all are entitled to your own opinions. Just wanted to let everyone know that every single bit of profit goes back into the business and I really do care. 

I know a few messages aren’t going to change your outlook on us. But I hope we can coexist here on the forums with open minds as we transform our company into something so much better that hopefully one day we can all be proud of.

You can carry generic parts but is it really necessary to put a 50% markup on it? and have slower shipping times compare to shipping from china?

When it comes down to it, most of our generic parts have so little room in them once you consider the shipping we pay to get them here and the 10% off coupon that most of our customers use plus shipping them to our customers for free. 

And shipping times are entirely fixed now. 1-2 days.

Yeah Yeah Yeah i TOTALLY understand, shipping is 8$ anywhere to the us, and the esc that your selling retails for 66$ while you sell it for 120$ without shipping

let me do the math:

120- 10% = 12 bucks

so your left with 108 and that minus shipping is 100$ left 

100$ - 66$ = **_34$ profit_**

Unfortunately that number isn’t what we pay and doesn’t include the shipping we pay to get them to our warehouse. 

Either way it’s about time to re-evaluate our supplier and the numbers we are paying for them. I’m sure we could get them cheaper. Would love to get them on the site cheaper for sure. 

Will have to find another reliable source for less and pass the savings down to our customers.

Please stop stocking the "diye" mounts that snap and then calling them "Premium" The market moved on a long time ago to boardnamics mounts and you should really move on too. Its actually not a hard process to have a company cnc 25 custom mounts for you, its not that expensive either. Look into it

Other things you probably shouldn't sell:
- The flipsky powerswitch with the mboards logo on it. That thing has destroyed many vescs, look around here
- 10S2P 30Q Being that expensive is scam tier of high. 
- 2 XT60 connectors for 1.50$ i mean come on

Also you have the winning remote listed as a mini remote, but in the community they're not the same (Google "Mini remote electric skateboard")

@MBoards  If you were to make a thread about your store, I think that the best course of action would be to make two threads, one of products that are available elsewhere, and another solely for promoting the 'handcrafted items'(no sarcasm here, I just dont really know of a good umbrella term). 

Maybe one day you can have a real section of the market cut out like some of the top vendors do here, but thats going to take worlds of dedication, ambition and hard work. goodluck <3

wow, yah..the ESCs you are offering are certainly priced too high and most people by now know that these are crap, mainly due to the countless of social media reviews of the early wowgo, etc. They have moved on since then and the ESCs you have listed are only used in the cheapest and shittiest prebuilt Chinese boards and kits with equally shitty 30-50A Li-Ion packs.

Prebuilt boards have become somewhat OK since they started using this, months ago.

![esc|500x500](upload://oJ8AMMtEGAXCYPGLKarlfSdD8xI.jpeg)

You're also selling the one FSEC (dual 4.20) that is known to cause cutouts. I would not stock items that cause issues and might damage your reputation (that includes trucks that snap etc.).

One of my first esk8 purchases was with MBoards.  Found the guy on YouTube.  He seemed helpful and knowledgeable so why not support him?  That transaction went completely sideways and even caused me to reconsider the idea of a DIY build.

Your apology seems sincere.  And it takes balls to post on this thread with grace and class.  I applaud you for that and really hope you can change everyone's perceptions.  On that note... I'll make a purchase from you tonight and see how it goes.

Even the most basic product development is going to take more than 24 days. 

Look, mboards in it's current form isn't for me, and in my opinion it's not even well suited for the 'market' this forum represents. 

But at least give them credit for jumping into a shark tank here and keeping a professional attitude. 

They may not sell what you want for the prices you want. It's on you as a consumer to make a choice as to where to spend your money. These guys do in fact seem legit, so let's not get the torches and pitchforks out for every vendor that doesn't operate like LHB/Psychotiller/Ollin etc

Hello,

I tell you about my experience with a purchase that I have decided to make with [MBoards](https://www.mboards.co).
My esk8 needed a battery change. I am from Argentina and in my country you can not get many good quality pieces so I have to do all the parts myself or bring them from abroad.
3 years ago I had made my first purchase of parts in [Diyelectricskateboard](https:///) (engine, engine, trucks, etc) and everything went perfectly. He had already made several purchases through ebay in other types of products, so I already had some experience in purchases abroad.
This time I decided to try another store (also because it was cheaper). I looked at several stores and decided on [MBoards](https://www.mboards.co).
His site looked well designed, of course, with good prices and something important SHOWED HIS STOCK ... Besides that in these 3 years I had also seen some of his videos on YouTube, meaning he felt that he was not "unknown" to trust him my money.

I finally decide to make my purchase at Mike's store. ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT I INCLUDED IN MY CART WERE FOUND IN STOCK. My order was $ 218.
Your page indicates that the delivery time of the order is 1 to 3 business days after the payment is credited. ([Shipping Policy](https://www.mboards.co/pages/shipping-policy))
In the state of my purchase the status "Paid" appeared, but I also decided to wait a few days to consult him if he had received my purchase and my money to be more secure
(At that time had already found [the thread on his poor reputation of sal](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/is-mboards-legit/47112)e). I started to worry.
Within 2 days I receive confirmation from Mike that he had received my purchase and my money. But he did not tell me when he would send my purchase ...
I decide to wait another week. It was still in the "Pending" status. I go back to communicate with Mike and then he replies that he had already received more batteries and was doing the last tests. It did not seem bad to me even though in its page at the time of making my order it appeared that I had the battery in stock, so I kept waiting.
I wait another week (we're going 14 days ... I repeat that on your page said from 1 to 3 business days), the status of my shipment was still showing "Pending" ... I ask Mike again and he says "Sorry for the delay. Our 6s2p batteries were much more popular than I had originally anticipated. I have more to come in a few weeks. I totally understand if you can not wait that long".
In this then he has already filled my patience!

I found a complete lack of respect, and part did not understand how to have received and be doing "the last tests", in a few days happened to have no more in stock.
I lost a lot of time, more punctually 20 days. Not to mention the nerves and stress generated by sending money to someone who is so far away assuming that he is someone who will fulfill what he promises.

I write my experience so that it does not happen to anyone else, and also so that Mike understands that having a store and offering products is not a children's game.

I show the captures of the conversations with Mike to verify everything that I mentioned:

I ordered a couple of items a few weeks ago.  One was not in stock (budget mount), so my order was waiting on it.  I ended up canceling the out of stock item and he shipped the in stock item (belt & pulleys) in timely fashion.

I’m waiting for the 6s2p (w/charger & BMS) to be in stock before ordering it.  I like the fast shipping (impatient and don’t care about cost)...

Christ almighty. Why buy from a shady store with a history of poor service?

6s2p 30Q and prone to failure charger - ~$80 in parts. There's a 90% chance these are fake cells and welded poorly. At least the explosion will be small because that battery is weaker than an unbrewed cup of tea.

<strong>Battery Info:</strong>
**Range:**  10-12 Miles (16-19.3 km)
**Top Speed:**  18-20+mph (29-32+ km/h)

Yeah, sure. Ok dood.

I ordered from him recently and can't complain. Package was shipped the day after I ordered it and arrived in Australia 8 days later.

If your shit hasn't shipped yet and it's been an unreasonable amount of time.  You're well within your rights to perform a credit card chargeback or PayPal dispute.  Vendor gets hit with a $50 fee for being a tool and teaches them to make less mistakes.

I hit them up on Instagram and got a response in minutes.
They really should consider removing the email from the contact us section of their website and direct people to Instagram instead if that is their best communication option.  The automatic email promising a 3 day response time should also be revised to say "We have a massive backlog of emails and are waiting on some parts to arrive in stock. Hit us up on Instagram when you get really frustrated with us not responding and start to think we are a scam company and we will then tell you how much we appreciate your business - but not before."  I actually don't mind waiting for the parts, I'd just like to know what's going on without putting in the effort that was required to get a message from them saying my parts are back-ordered and would be shipped next week.

There used to be a chat area on their website it’s probably gone now. Email them or start writing comments on their Instagram !*emphasized text*

Thank you all for your advice on MBoards, definitely steering clear of them ! Too add my own experience, I emailed them directly about 4 days ago asking for help about more info on their 10s3p pack and no response. Also asked about the same on their YouTube comments and ... Surprise.. no response. Glad I decided to email them first before buying. Definitely seems like the customer service has not improved
