Sad day, this was curious, was pushing for a while and decided to go electric so turned on remote and pulled trigger and board started smoking tried to get battery out but failed, don’t know why did the board go up when asked for current, vescs were fused. Battery’s where old and didn't hold much charge as they where 2 years old and charge daily.
Edit: my good friend made a go fund me 😂

scary. I carry an aerosol fire extinguisher in my bag most of the time just in case.

I'm going to assume battery short after 2 years of daily use and vibration?

Yes I didn’t treat it very kind, I am interested if the bms shorted though because the battery would not have waited for me to pull back on trigger right?

watch your soldered together 2p battery pack Zach... it is a candidate for a similar fate.
at only 2p the battery will be used hard and the heat from soldering the nickel strips on would have damaged the cells to some kind of degree...

I have been getting more paranoid about this recently. I just bought a locker to stick my board in at home while it is charging/storing (lipos). It would be the worst thing ever if my house burned to the ground because of lipo fire.

Switch to lion, they are much safer. And also use fuses between the battery and bms. I have a stainless steel enclosure so I am chill. (unless the fire burns a hole through my deck :fire:)

While a stainless steel enclosure could help contain a fire, it can also help start one.  Also keep in mind the radio transmissions won't go through it, only through the deck

This is one of the few reasons why I have my battery box easy to detatch. If it goes on fire, the box will burned with the batteries but not the entire board. Also now I am switching to loop keys instead of a switch as loop key ensure 100% power detachment.

More or less, when you make a solder joint, make sure those solder join are a well made heated solder join. This ensure vibrations won't knock it off and start shorting the shit out of the batteries.

It looked like he's using

1 x TB Mechanical Kit
1 x TB 6374 motor
1 x TB VESC
$430 TB 12s4p battery pack
$200 TB cabon fiber deck
$60 Anti-spark switch
misc.

At most $1600. And I just found it here: products/torque-rocket-dual
But that's a dual. I guess he may have hit a few snags along the way.

dude...

that’s unreasonable! i’ve spent about $5000 on my board, only about $1200 are currently in use. what you can see from the outside is not everything involved. that’s a custom carbon fiber deck, probably took a large amount of labor and time to complete. you really gotta start to check yourself before you post. all you’re doing is embarrassing yourself.
