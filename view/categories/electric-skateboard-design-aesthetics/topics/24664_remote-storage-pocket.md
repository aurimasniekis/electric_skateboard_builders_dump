Hey, just a really quick tip about the storing the remote. I just wanted a simple and quick way to store the remote on the board. Summer is here, packing light, pants without pockets...remote was a hassle :)

So I found this little dirt cheap "car mesh" on eBay, opened it up, and drilled over existing holes that hold the thing together to fix it on the board. 

Voila, job done, remote fits snugly and securely, it takes a second to put it in place and no more hassle :thumbsup:

That would be a great place to put a skate tool while riding!
