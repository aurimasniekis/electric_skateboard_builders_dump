Looking for something like this but preferably not Aluminium as I want a comfy ride. How comes there are no bamboo decks with this type of design aswell?

Probably because a traditional bamboo deck with that much material removed would easily snap in half. 

If you're looking for holy decks, Landyachts has their "hollowtech" and three six makes metal ones like you posted above.

Would there be a big difference between Aluminium deck and Aluminium Alloy deck?

I'm not sure, presumably the aluminum alloy is stronger than just aluminum but I have no idea what it's alloyed with.

You know if it would be possible to get a deck printed anywhere? Or how much that could cost?

A printed deck in this size is going to be a fortune since you'll need a huge printing bed. If you want comfy ride, get a Vanguard. If the deck is full of holes, building the enclosure is going to be a pain
