Hi guys

I am considering developing some new products for our EU store; pwrboards.com 
I know that a lot of you guys are very passionate about this hobby, and spend a lot of time designing your boards. So who better to ask than you guys? 

I thought it could be a nice idea, to let you guys come up with your own designs (or just written ideas) for some universal motor mounts and some abs / glass fiber enclosures. 

If we choose your design, you will receive some units of the finished product when its finished. You will also receive a gift card to our shop on 100EUR. 

There is no limitations. Please feel free to be creative. But remember, that these things need to be sturdy as hell. 

The window will be closed buy the end of July. 



We look forward to see some of your designs. 

Good luck!
//Oskar

I love this idea! Thanks for taking steps to include the community in this! Are we supposed to PM the ideas, or post them here?

Thanks for your feedback :D 
Good question; I guess if you prefer your design to be public, you can post your design here. Otherwise, a PM will be okay too.

I get the idea, but.... most of the people who design enclosures and stuff on here actually sell them if they are any good. Giving up those designs might not be something that's going to happen easily. The other public designs are probably already on Thingiverse if they are made by a non-seller.

Are you looking to purchase the designs, or just get ideas from the people that make the stuff already ?

```
Most experienced designers/manufacturers are selling their mounts through builders already and have gone through the process of testing/improving their designs based on own experience and customer feedback. 

It would be easier to contact a few manufacturers/DIY guys who produce in small batches outside/inside of Europe to see if you can take care of mass distribution for your region. Offer them a good margin and you're set.

Yes, I have had that thought too. 
I guess some people are making the designs to get money, while others just wants their designs to be used. 
I guess I am somewhere in the middle. 

Anyways, we could go on all day debating wether this is a good idea or not. It might be, and it might not. We'll see :)

How do you want the files? .STEP? .STL? Something else? I like the idea, I usually design personal items that can be 3D printed... I've only designed maybe a couple enclosures and haven't done any motor mounts. I do have a bunch of other random things though... But mostly niche designs. If you have any idea for things other than mounts and enclosures, let me know... If I feel inspired by the ideas I might get drawing and testing with prints 😎

I feel like there is some good money to be made in selling a waterproof battery that will fit flexy decks like Trampa or loaded decks. Dont think anyone really makes a good solution for this right now.

I think you need to be more specific, like motor mount for which trucks, what size of enclosure, more like ‘terms of reference’ if this is goin to be some e-skate design competition 😄

You don't get it. The mount should fit everything and be stupid strong. :sweat_smile:

As a result, the whole thing will be supported purely with massive grub screws that will dig into the truck over time.

The enclosure should unfold in some clever way to accommodate anything in between 1s1p to 100s100p.

A good design is worth cash. A good designer should get paid, or gets the satisfaction out of releasing a product at near cost price (you sure as hell won't). If you want cheap labor, a forum contest is not the right place. No matter how well the request is disguised.

Yeah, I guess you have nothing to loose except for your reputation. 

Honestly, I find these type of contests unstructured, cheap and it highlights the lacking knowledge of the person organizing it. Just my humble opinion. All the best though.

Take www.eskating.eu as an example please and get some good people on board to design your own products.

If you've made a custom part that is ready for market you should not be giving it away wholly for a voucher and some samples of your own work.

Just think before you submit your hard work please.

I have to say I'm surprised at animosity shown here, as far as I understand this thing @OskarCastrone is just looking to make some cool shit out of designs and feedback from builders.  Where's the problem?

Here's a simple fact for you guys...there is 1000 people here that have designed something but lack the relationships or machinery to get it made.  So that idea just sits there and doesn't actually do anything.  

Personally, I have given away 20 ish designs (in posts on this forum) for 3d printed gear that I found useful.  I've seen a couple of instances where those ideas were turned into products being sold without so much as a 'thanks dude', but it's not like I was going to manufacture and sell them.  At a minimum @OskarCastrone is willing to reward someone for a cool idea.

Y'all need to check your motivations for the downtalk that is starting to be prevalent around here...

Start with open source stuff.  Just follow the license.

I need to publish more often.

Absolutely agree my friend, unless you have something groundbreaking then all it really is is variations on a theme and this is a builders forum not a commerce site. This type of design pool is great for the community in general so good on you @OskarCastrone

Chill out mate he's hardly likely to go out and buy a porsche for a different type of flexible enclosure but that enclosure will be readily available for everyone.
you missed my point and made the one I replied to.

Sounds awesome dude!

The file type is kind of irrelevant. But since you ask, I will prefer .STL 
I'm looking forward to see your design(s)!! :D

Sure, I guess you are right. 
Regarding motor mounts, I guess it would be best to to fit caliber trucks and clones. It is the most used. 

Regarding the enclosures, the design is more up for discussion. There is a lot of different ways to go at it. I am open to any design that seems relevant to the comunity. :) 
I think most people use a 10s3p battery, so maybe an enclosure, that can fit to these. 
It could also be a split enclosure like boosted boards, with a smaller enclosure for the the speed controller and a bigger one for the batery. A 10s3p might get too big here though... :)

Thanks again for your feedback. 

I agree with you. Many people are already giving away there designs as open source, which I think is great too. This is kind of what I wish this to be as well. 

As you say, many wish to design something, but dont see the point since they dont have the resources/connections/time to get them made. This is where I can help. 

All I wanna do is to offer some great products. Sure I would like to make a profit too, but everyone have to eat right? Furthermore, it is not free to run a webshop... 

I get why some of you think it is stupid to give away your hard work for free. I guess it is a matter of perspective.

I don't think it's a stupid idea at all, my point was just speculative that some of the best designs won't feature in this contest, that's all.

I'm no designer, but the stuff I've done is on thingiverse for anyone to use. Tbh I'm flattered that so far I'm up to a whopping 20+ downloads haha !

Hope you get some results in the end 👍

You could cause yourself an intellectual property problem.

Patent laws vary from country to country. For example, in the U.S. one has a year after public disclosure to file the patent for U.S. patent protection in the U.S. However, as far as international patenting goes, that person loses the right to any international patents the moment it was published/disclosed. So...you could for example sell it outside of the U.S. without any problem, but that person still has a full year to  patent his/her item in the U.S. AFTER "publishing" or disclosing the design, and if you sold it in the U.S. you would be infringing on his or her U.S. patent and **could** face a lawsuit in the U.S.
Other countries may have even stronger IP laws.

Edit to add:
You also have to watch out that someone may "give" you a design, but that design MAY be patented by someone else, or even just PART of it may be patented by someone else. The helpful contributor may not have had any legal right to "give" that design to you or the public. He or she may not even know it's already been patented (in whole or in part) by someone. You could find yourself unknowingly infringing on someone's already existing patent.

in response to this, i say go with the TB approach and design a ring, however combine that with Psychos idea of a press fit ring and then have a seperate mounting plate that attaches AND offer different sizes like marcmt88 who offeres 3 different length plates that have adjustable angles (again referencing TB plates)

thats about the only way to get universal i think... 1 plate that fits different press fit rings WITH grub screws, because why not... whats great is you literally just cut a bounch of circles and the only thing that changes is the shape of the inside cut... the rest is quite easily cookie cutter and universal, you can offer a drop down on the site to select the trucks in which u affer the adapter rings for and even sell just the rings so people can buy 1 whole kit and then only have to buy different rings and be good to go

however thats just me...

If you live in places like the uk it rains. I know its hard to believe but it does.

I have a flexy deck and one of the hardest things I have found is finding a waterproof battery solution. lots of company's offer large prebuilt battery's with/without bms but these often still require an enclosure and none are suitable for flexing. 

I think a waterproof battery pack that can be easily mounted to stiff or flexy decks would be great for DIYers.
