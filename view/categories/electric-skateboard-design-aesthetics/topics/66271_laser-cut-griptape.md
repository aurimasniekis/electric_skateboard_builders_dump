Hey everyone, I have a laser cutting unit i've been working with to cut griptape so if anyone needs any cut please message me. I can do mostly any design as long as the lines arnt too close together. I have some stock designs too if anyone just wants something cool thats already done.

Where are you based? 
How much you charge?
Dimensions of what you can cut?
 Examples of what you already cut?
Thanx

Sorry for the vague post guys... I'm relatively new to the forums. Mike I think we met in Irvine, I'm a friend of Joe's. I'm located in Carlsbad, CA.

I've been charging $45/grip for single cuts up to 45" shipped to your door. If you want multiple cuts of the same design we can work something out depending on how much work you have for me. 

My max canvas area is 23"x18" so any width of griptape will fit. I have hexagon designs ready for cutting immediately but am open to change it up to suit your individual needs for each project. If you want a one off grip design you will need to supply me with an .svg image that I will not share with the public. If you want me to make the design and produce multiple grip tapes we can speak privately about pricing and lead times.

Right on. His reputation is well known so i'm sure you'll get a solid product. If you want something done for your board that he is making, I'd be happy to get it to him before it ships out or send it directly to you as well. Let me know... i'm very flexible.

Miller? That Irvine ride was a hot as hell. Glad my board didnâ€™t burst into flames and start a wild fire
