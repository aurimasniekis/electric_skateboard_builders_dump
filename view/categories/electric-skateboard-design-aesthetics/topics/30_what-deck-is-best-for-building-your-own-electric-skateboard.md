I get asked this question a lot by my customers. So here is a summary of features you should look for in a deck when deciding what to buy.

**There are a few important deck features to pay attention to**
* **Wheelbase** - The distance between the trucks, Specifically the baseplate of each truck. 
* **Deck Flex** - Does It bend/flex when you stand on it. 
* **Deck Shape** - Concave, W Concave, Drops, Micro Drops, Rocker & Camber 


----------


So lets go through these features in more detail to understand why each aspect is important.

**Wheelbase** is important because it dictates the area you have available to mount your electronics. Unless you are planning to have your battery elsewhere like in your bag or pocket, which I don't recommend as it means long cables and this has its own problems which we will discuss on another topic.

So you need space for your battery, motor controllers, motors and any other electronics gadgets that you want built in. If the deck is too short you might find it difficult to fit everything 'on board' that you want. This is why using a long board is so popular for building esk8. A deck of approximately 100cm is generally ample for most builds. You can definitely go smaller just make sure you calculate length of batteries, the length of your ESC & how much your motors are protruding out from your trucks. 

So lets calculate it now, Motors need about 120mm of clearance. This is the area between the truck axle to the edge of your closest components housing. Unless your motors are backwards mounted which is not as common but definitely an option. If your motors are backward protruding you can have the enclosure much closer to the the trucks, as long as there is ample clearance for the truck to pivot during a turn.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/28ec920b4277bd888b87ef12102bc710ed7db0ea.jpg" width="600" height="352"> 


You may also have other components such as on/off switches, LCD screens, watt meters. These take up some room beneath the deck. The more components you have the more wire bulk you have also. In most setups you will need to allocate about 50mm Minimum of area just for wire routing.

So for motors and wire bulk 120mm & 50mm you have already used 170mm of Wheelbase. Now the rest of the area can be used for a battery and ESC (or two ESC for dual drive)

Battery size will be directly proportional to its Wh rating. More Wh = larger battery in both weight and size. A batteries proportions can be varied. Most Lipo batteries with a decent sized capacity, say 6s with 8000mah, that you buy from the hobby store tend to be short in length but fat in height. 

A 6s battery has 6 cells. Each Lipo pouch (cell) is about 9mm thick. This is fairly standard. The length can vary a lot from 130mm-200mm & Longer. The width of a lipo pouch is generally between 45mm-70mm.

As a beginner with lipo, for ease of setup normally you buy them pre-built how you want to use them. So if you want 6S you buy one. But as you get more advanced with your understanding of battery configuration you can start creating your own unique layout. For instance it is becoming increasingly popular to buy two 3S packs, which are about 28mm in height (instead of 60mm like a 6s) and wiring them together in serial or parallel to get your desired voltage or capacity. The slimmer battery configuration allows for improved ground clearance, which is very important, but requires more real estate (both length & width) beneath the deck to lay the batteries out.

So if you are going to customize your Lipo packs for the slimline look & maximise your ground clearance you might end up with two batteries end-to-end OR side-by-side.

**The battery therefore could require up to 400mm in deck area!!.**

**The ESC will generally require about 100mm maybe slightly more if you have lots of wire bulk.**

This is another nice way of using the space efficiently
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/1X/a876e4900563041867233b25bd5a56004f58952f.jpg'>


**So for the slimline look using 3S Lipo you probably need max of 670mm long wheelbase. If you mount the batteries side-by-side maybe you will need just 470mm of area.**


----------

**Deck Flex** as you can already imagine will be a problem if you have a really long battery, current battery technology isn't designed to bend. 

What is Flex - This is the bouncy feel that you experience on your longboard. Flexible longboards are best suited for low speed riding. longboard decks can come in a variety of flex patterns including (but not limited to): Light, Medium, and Stiff. Flex may be indicated numerically or indicated in the description of your longboard deck. A flexible longboard deck will soften the ride on rough concrete and over bumps and cracks but will be much harder to use when building an electric skateboard.

**However there are ways of getting around the bending issue.**

* Don't mount solid parts where the deck flexes, so this generally means avoiding the middle section. Put the battery behind the front truck and the the ESC at the other end with wire spanning the gap. It actually works fairly well as the wires across the middle actually don't bend much so this technique is viable. However much more challenging to make it look nice.

>Here is a custom made board I built for a customer last year that uses this mounting method.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/0563ac3c39d175964d8f6c7c1dfc8516361b4bdf.jpg" width="333" height="500"> 

* Run you battery array sideways down the board, as pictured above with four 3S batteries side-by-side, if each battery is separate they will move independently when the deck bends. I tend to think this will result in some additional cost & maintenance though as wires & solder joint may eventually break due to constant bending & flexing. You also need a flexible enclosure. I have often though of using some kind of silicone like they use to make mobile phone protective shell cases with.

* Put your components elsewhere.... like in your bag... I really don't like this idea. I think everything should be safe & secure built into the deck, or in a hard case beneath the deck, its not just for personal safety but also to protect your expensive components from the harsh environment.

So if you do decide you must have the bendy one, make sure your mount the components onto the deck in a way that allows the flex. Plastic or Aluminium enclosures won't flex like the wood does. The surface area beneath the deck expands as it flexes, this will put force onto the screws, glue or what ever you used to attach your enclosure. It may also break your case.

The other thing to consider about decks that flex is at high speed they are not as responsive as a solid deck. So if you plan to travel at high speed, which I tend to think is anything over about 30km/h, you don't want a flexy deck. What you want is a rock solid unit that responds to the most subtle flexion in your ankle to help you navigate the unpredictable streets that you ride on. 

**30km/h is 8 meters per second. Just think about it.**

its worth noting that when it comes to decks that flex or bend it wont be the same for all riders. Your body weight will determine how much flex occurs. So if possible I suggest heading into your local board store and trying the deck out.

So to summarise, I would generally avoid the flexy decks!.  


----------
**Deck Shapes** will present the e board builder with various challenges.

**Concave** - The curvature between the two sides (left-to-right) of the board. Concave helps hold your toe and heel in place, giving the rider more control of the longboard. Concave locks your feet into your longboard deck while carving in and out of turns. When build an electric skateboard on a deck with a lot of concave you want to avoid having a wide component housing, as it won't sit flush beneath the deck. Long & skinny is better.

**Camber** - The amount of upward bend along the length of a longboard between the two trucks. Because of camber, the riding platform is set higher than the truck mounts. Camber allows the rider to have more leverage for turns while riding the longboard. On more flexible longboards, camber ensures that the rider will sit at the same level with the trucks (rather than below them). Also, camber allows for boards to have a lot of flex without letting the deck touch the ground unexpectedly. Boosted boards made a really nice electric skateboard using a flexible deck with camber so its not impossible, but it just means you need to split the components apart, which adds to the cost of the build and complicates the build. It also lengthens the battery wires which can be a problem for some ESC.

**Rocker** - The longboard deck bends downward in a smooth arc (like a banana) so that the center of the board is below the trucks. Because of this arc, the nose and tail are “wedged”, allowing more turning in the front and rear trucks. Rocker is good for long distance pushing since now the deck is lower to the ground. This is also known to make for a comfortable freeride deck since it decreases the stress on your knees and ankles. These should be avoided as you don't want your expensive electronic stuff grinding across the ground.

**“W” Concave** - This is the concave that takes the shape of a “W” in your standing platform. The bump created is also referred to as a “dome”. This “dome” fits the arches of your feet giving you more control with your back foot. This can work really good for your eSk8, However the "W" profile will generally mean that the underside of the deck is not flat so mounting can be a problem. You will definitely need to screw or bolt your enclosure onto the deck, double sided tap won't work as the mounting surface is not flat.

**Drop Deck** - This form of longboard deck involves an effective foot platform that is dropped to sit significantly below the truck level. The main advantage of the drop platform is that it can be lowered to barely clear the surface, although the actual deck height ultimately depends on the size of the wheels. The lower center of gravity creates more stability and causes less stress on the knees and lower back. These decks can work! But you need really slim components or large diameter wheels, probably both. 

I used this type of drop deck, the Bustin ibach 40", for the custom made enertion all-terrain decks that I made.

**These are some of my favourite decks that i have converted into eboards.**
**Super Glider by Earthwing**, this deck is super light & really flat across the underside. I personally love having a kick for extra manoeuvrability & popping down gutters or over cracks, In my opinion this is Probably the perfect eboard deck....

**Machine by JET**, Not the easiest deck to mount electronics onto, but the shape is just so awesome, it has a slight micro drop but nothing you can't easily overcome with some planning.
 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/cbaf3a31fa0fe033f6cc6cf9fb31df627bf98a58.png" width="500" height="500"> 
 
**THE FUTURE DECKS FOR EBOARD BUILDING**
I believe that eventually people will want decks that are custom made & specifically designed for eboard builders. Carbon fiber is probably the best material to use as it is very strong & light weight.

This is the [all-in-one carbon fiber eboard deck][1] deck I will be using to make my next electric skateboard with in a few weeks, once it comes out of production. For the design I took inspiration from the Earthwing Superglider it has a built-in cavity for the electric components so the result is a super slim & rigid deck perfect for high speed & high performance.

<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/1X/919b702e5e5e1f6ae17febb094ddc41c8a4c4978.jpg'>


At the end of the day what's most important is you have a choice! You can decide what deck you like based on your weight & your vision of what the perfect eboard should be. Choosing your own deck is the reason that building your own electric skateboard will always be better then buying one off the shelf. Everyone is different and everyone deserves a choice.

Nice write up.. Well done.

I prefer the sturdy decks by far and short as possible. You end up getting use to the short size and shorter stance eventually.

I have a few decks, I'll be testing out soon.

 - [OverlandBoards.com Bo-Fax 35"][1] $150 (Aluminum)
 - [Hi5ber.com Incisor 34.5"][2] $180 (Carbon Fiber)
 - [HydroflexSkateboards.com The Angler 36"][3] $190 (Fiberglass/Epoxy)

I was looking into a loaded board but for the price a regular deck for $200 wasn't ideal.

I actually like @onloop's carbon fiber :) I just don't have a battery to fit within that spec size. You have any extras in-case I do change my mind?

Newbie questions:
1) What will be the minimum ground clearance required for a drop deck board? Is Landy Switch 40 a good option? I am an old fart and will be using only for commuting. 
2) Is this a good deal? $99 for Eathwing Superglider deck: http://www.earthwingboards.com/#!product/prd1/2324869461/superglider-v-lam-aspen-core
Thank you guys! I'm just soaking all info given in this forum. Hope to be able to contribute  one day.

Generally a drop deck is not a great idea.

But it really depends what the thickness of your battery and components is.

And your wheel diameter.

Really you want as much clearance as possible, for instance if you need to roll over a speed hump, you don't want ya bits scraping the ground.

I think a micro drop is ok with 83mm wheels. But a one inch drop would be asking for trouble on 83mm wheels.

Great writeup onloop.  Lots of good info.  A bit funny like asking what is the best coffee or wine?

hehehe - it's all personal preference.  Though onloop is correct a drop deck is not ideal - i'm building one now!  (small'ish drop of ~1.5" so not dragging the deck on the ground kind of drop.  Paired with big wheels (97 Flywheels) still enough clearance for skinny batteries.  My electronics and batteries are going to inset into the deck (double thick deck) so should have ample protection if it does take a hit going over a bump/curb/rock.

This is what i love about DIY e-boards!  Instead of your one option from Boosted/E-Go/Marbel - you can build it around the deck you want.  The deck shape, size, flex being i think the most personal choice of a rider and how they want to ride!

Torque - those are some sexy decks!  Like the Angler especially!

Downhill decks are pretty sweet because they are stiff- flex is usually not what you want because components don't like flexing.. my current eboard in progress is on this deck, and I absolutely love it.

I built my own, but any downhill deck will work fine. Things to check for are deck stiffness and wheelbase. Outside of that its basically whatever you can make work and are comfortable with.

Hey guys. Im a custom deck builder and have my own personal preferences, but what would any of you guys say would be your ideal specs for an e-boards set up using the exertion components. Ie Any deck flex? Length? Wheels base? Wheel diameter and hardness? etc.

## \#10 Posted by: lowGuido Posted at: 2015-12-07T05:40:46.811Z Reads: 1349

Id say less flex is better for mounting batteries and components, and wheels of 70mm absolute minimum for decent gearing. (83mm is most common I believe)
length is really up to you. obviously a longer deck gives you more room to mount stuff, but I have set up a 31" deck without too much issue.

Ok cool thanks @lowGuido. Can you tell me more about why that wheel diameter is better? Is it speed related? Motor clearance related? I have my own wheels which are 65mm diameter I was considering using.

its just that its almost impossible to fit a drive gear to anything smaller. if you tried to use 65mm wheels the drive gear would be the same size as the wheels!

I bought these yesterday from Ryan Ehlers. $50 a piece. Both are super stiff. The one with cut aways is pretty short in the wheel base arena, but I think it will turn out to be a fun ride with the semi kick tail. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/ad236e76126c8d2ffd99e0dc4a14b591681cd0c8.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/238d21cb4d6303eba329e8f737caaeac67d22d3a.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/486bf1cabcaa12100da53117b66c3a4b56292c1b.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/deb548dee0d6aa292e5cbc92c16c4121dd1bdee8.jpg" width="689" height="390">

Oh, I gotcha. I'm really digging that Lonely Pirate deck. Shape, dimensions, graphic. Debating between that and a slightly cheaper blank deck, mainly cause the cool graphics get covered with enclosures anyway, but I can't seem to find a blank with those dimensions; close to 37-40" length, 26-28" wheelbase, with a kicktail. Any blanks or there that fit this bill?

Btw, do you know the wheelbase range for the different mounting positions on that pirate deck? 

That would be awesome if you could find out a price for one of those Pirate decks shipped to San Francisco area, but only if it's not too much trouble. Or even find out why Ehlers site shows $45 for the deck only selection, but goes in the cart at$70? I appreciate you trying to help a brotha out!

@psychotiller Aww, I thought you were gonna get ME a deal on it? Lol. Thanks for trying though. Now I'm torn between the mid-length kick tail, a drop down version.

How do you all feel about drop down or drop through decks? I'm running 97mm wheels, so I think I could get away with  a drop deck, and still have clearance for the enclosure, but I'm not sure about the motor. Would the motor have to be mounted outboard, or could it still fit inboard? I like the lower center of gravity, but most of the drop decks I come across have really long wheelbases. Any favorite decks or feedback in this department?

hi, Im new to this and I have a few doubts regarding decks. I have a strong not flexible arbor deck which is meant to be for downhill, and I am worried that it is probably to heavy for an e board... I weigh about 60 kg and I really want this think to go fast. Maybe with a bigger motor or would you recommend two motors... or maybe buying a lighter deck... also, I have abec flashback wheels which  (the side that goes in the truck) the rubber goes all the way to the truck leaving no plastic to drill... I hope you understand me, should I drill through the plastic? or should I buy new wheels, and if I do, should I buy only one or all 4 should be the same? thanks a lot @onloop

Everything will fit fine, but the deck is flexy. So you will have to split your battery pack and esc into two enclosures like Boosted or use a smaller pack that fits on or side.

The Space Cell 4 battery takes up 3/4 of the length of the enclosure. So the last 1/3 of the battery will sit at the center of your deck where it flexes the most. even if you hang it with a 1/2" of foam, it won't be enough.

if you don't want to split your enclosure, you can split up your battery pack into a few groups of cells connected by wires instead of strips.

It's advertised as a stiff deck, so it should work well on an Esk8, but will not fit the SPACE CELL enclosure. Here's a pic of how it will fit. You can still use a Space Cell 3, but you will need a smaller enclosure.

Try looking for a board with more of a symmetrical shape like the Funbox dist Suzie Slide through.

Switchblade works fine with that setup. I mounted my 90's and Carvon hubs drop thru on a switchblade and it worked fine. Just had to carve out a wheel well so the hub motor case doesn't hit. No wheel bite on the 90's, but it was close. I changed to a Suzie slide through because my enclosure didn't have as much clearance as I wanted and I still wanted a drop thru.

The trucks you have may make a slight difference since it's close when I carve really hard, but nothing a few minutes with a file can't solve. I was using the Funbox trucks my car on came with. I calipers look like the hangers are a little farther back and may hit a little.

I'm planning my first build, and I'm thinking about using a pintail deck. I found [this deck only](http://www.mindlesslongboards.com/mindless_products/peche-ii-talisman/) for a reasonable price (around 40 EUR) at a local skate shop. 

I'm planning to use 90mm wheels with 180mm Caliber trucks, but I'm unsure whether they would be too big for the pintail deck and cause wheel bite. Would 83mm wheels be safer? 
Is there any information out there regarding what wheel size (or additional riser) is recommended with given deck shapes?

I'm 83 kg (183 pounds), and I'm completely new to skateboarding, so probably I won't make sharp turns at least in the beginning. 

thx.

LHB built a custom board for me, he used a 9 ply deck.  And that thing was total overkill for my 140 lbs.  It does fine with 300 lbs on it.  I'd probably get an 8 ply for myself next time, I maybe able to get away with 7 ply.  Not an expert on this by any means, but all I know is 9 ply is pretty freakin tough.

Hey guys, unfortunately something happen to my vesc (stray radio at the same frequency maybe?) While I was in Manhattan. The board took off on me and decided to go toe to toe with a Nissan frontier. Needless to say the frontier kicked my boards ass. Luckily the only thing that broke was the deck (a earthing chaser 36) I also cracked the space cell case but it can be easily repaired.
Now on to the question for the community. I mostly chose the chaser 36 for the tail which is absolutely a must have for me. I need to pop over curbs and such, I also like to kick the board up to grab it. However I had to extend the wheel base on the chaser to get enough clearance for the motors/battery. Pushing the truck that far back reduced my leverage quite a bit basically making the tail useless.. does anyone know of a deck that will fit the space cell/enertion motors and mounts while also having a tall?
The other option might be for me to gut the space cell to make my own case. The section for the vescs could be quite a bit shorter this providing clearance for the motors.
Thoughts?

Hi there! Been lurking around and trying to figure out which is the shortest possible all terrain / mountainboard deck available..

----
I've got two boards now:

*Scrub Silver Reef series II mountainboard (42.5'' long) - already electric*
*Street line - X mountainboard (35'' long) - not electric*

I measured that the **shortest ''comfortable'' deck lenght could be 31.5''..** That is the lenght which the street line - x mountainboard now has at its baseplate outer screws. 

---

From observation I have witnessed that the wheels should be outside of where your feet is located.. Otherwise the board is not very stable (skateboards are a good example).

So it seems that for now, the shortest distance for where the **feet can rest comfortably, is about 27.5''** plus there's a need for some extra material where to locate the trucks / baseplate to mount the wheels outside of standing location. **This is why I came up with 31.5'' lenght.**

---

There are some few other things to consider - like turning radius and more.. but for now I would like to figure out what size to choose and how should I modify a ready made board to make it more suitable for my needs (by cutting it shorter or narrower at the ends)

---

If you got any ideas or tips..that would be great.. I know there are a few all terrain build logs here on the forum but I just wanted to ''shout out'' this proposal, so that I can update it later when I have gathered some more info..

Hi,

I'm just starting to scratch the surface of this fun wheel and am really excited about the thought of building my own electric longboard.  I used to longboard a ton in high school and have recently started building and flying multi rotors.  I would love to use my knowledge of the drone hobby and my love for longbaording.  I have an old board made from a very small company in Salt Lake City that I would like to potentially use for the build.  Here are some pics of the build: http://imgur.com/a/tNWZb

I know this board is very low clearance, but I am wondering if there any possible way to make it work in its current configuration?   I know if would likely need to upgrade from my current 70mm wheels.

I can't find any information on here about rear mounting motors to where they would be protruding out the back, like Evolve does on their boards.  What term would I use to search for builds like this?  Does anyone in the DIY community use this mounting style?  Thanks for the help.  I look forward to continuing to plan and hopefully execute on this build.

@Snow4us 

Hi, 
consider making your own topic or ask in the new chat...
If you want rear drive, you can use some motor mounts like DIY's (USA) or APS's (Europe). I think both of them should work, to be certain contact their support...

ALso chech this topic (http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/1132).

It is also possible to use normal front drive, but i wouldn't do that or I would use smaller motors (50mm, 63 only with 90mm+ wheels) Consider using hub motors :wink:

I've never ridden my drop thu bottom mounted.  if i did that it, and I liked it, I'd rather have gotten the board without the cutouts!  next time.  do they sell drop thru bottom mount top covers for the ocd.  ...im going to fill the holes with a sound system.

Hi,

I need some help with choosing the right deck. Currently I have this combination od trucks and motor mounts. I am aware that i will have to go on bigger wheels (8'').  (hope @Idea is going to be ok with using his picture).

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/1/7133ff6abd41dfc2f7303953fde4facd3369f5b1.png

My question is : which deck should I buy to be compatible with these trucks and motor mounts.

these are MBS ATS Mountainboard trucks, so they are used on MBS decks.
Don´t know if they would fit other decks

If you use those trucks on any standard longboard decks you will need special risers.  Im fighting this battle right now :).

Should be fine....usually they market board because they found it rides best with ( whatever mark inserted here) if there are clearance issues you can always add risers or sand down areas of the board with rubbing. It is a drop through so less material if you go caliber II's.

There are a lot of dope brands, depends on what you are looking for (e.g flex, drop/top).

I like Rayne, Landy, Never Summer. It's really a lot of personal preference.

If you choose stiff deck, it will be more stable in speed, they aare usually made out of maple...If you choose flexible deck, it wont be as stable as DH, but it will absorb much more vibrations...

It's a matter of preference. Just keep in mind that a pintail deck won't have the same wheel clearance as a freeride deck... so you have to use risers!

I think your post is very knowledgeable and is a good place to start for new skaters! Especially your insight when it comes to flex impacting performance at higher speeds. As a manufacturer for downhill skateboards, managing or eliminating flex while ensuring a smooth, responsive and stable ride has been a focus of my work as a board maker thus far.

Since you mentioned the future of e-sk8 decks, especially customs, I'd also like to take this chance to link my [website.](https://www.voxelboards.com/) I've been recently looking to make my first e-sk8 deck and I think that my technology would make a very good fit without many tweaks! We have our own unique deck construction, and some new vibration normalizing truck mounts and I'll even have the ability to design and pour my own wheel and cores in house! We can do custom or commissioned graphics, and we have material options with an affordable and durable standard construction at around $100, and a more lightweight and premium construction as well!

Concave is definitely an important consideration when attaching your enclosure, so I think I'd like to make a dedicated mould with a generally more mellow concave than what I currently have available. I think that will work to a riders advantage in terms of comfort, although I think our current pressed in wheel wells would be perfect here as well.

I'm trying to build an electric skateboard and am choosing a board to use and wheels 
I have a few already I can use but not sure if I should buy a different one 
1) a 34" Santa cruz board with a kick tail, worried that it would be hard to ride at fast speeds(20+ mph)
2) 40" flexible fiberglass long board, probably to bendy
3) 38" concave wooden long board, not that flexible
like the idea on an all terrain drop deck with mbs all terrain long board wheels

If you are still looking for a deck , i've bought this one and love it.It's on sale for the moment. It has a nice mini drop that locks your feet pretty well:

https://www.sickboards.nl/en/longboards/5641-db-longboards-freeride-dt-38-deck-only.html

I didn't like the graphics so i wrapped the deck with some cheap carbon film:

Hi,

I can’t seem to be able to create a new post, but this place seems to be as good a place as it could be. I have ordered the earthwing superglider v-lam to go with the pro 2 kit from diyelectricskateboard (@torqueboards) collections/electric-skateboard-conversion-kit/products/pro2-electric-skateboard-conversion-kit

I’m a little worried about the flex (I’m 85kg) and was wondering if anyone had experience with that deck.  It is worth noting that I live in the UK.

A particular case is US American  [Alani Lani](http://alanilani.com/) from Hawaii, fantastic carbon deck manufacturer I appreciate.

I learned a trick that simulates the foot-gripping effect of the W deck. Just stick some folded over tape lengthwise underneath the griptape to be thick enough, and you've basically got your little hump to lock your feet on without having the wood go all wonky for the battery.
