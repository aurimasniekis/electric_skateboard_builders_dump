I know this topic has been posted before as I have done a lot of searching on the forum, however I need an enclosure for just a vesc without batteries. I can’t seem to find any that are the right size.
I don’t even need a custom one, just maybe a suggestion on a cheap Tupperware container or something of that sort.

I could probably make one pretty easily, or you could use a piece of heat formed ABS.

Depending on the cost of printing I may have had it printed for me but if it doesn’t have a cover then I don’t know if I would do it.
However, it does look cool

I don’t mind using a container or plant saucer or what not, I just don’t know where to find the right size

They have an esc enclosure for their 12s esc not the vesc and it’s ridiculously expensive

They have a blemished version that's cheap if you look in there.

I bought the dual, its quality gear.  It took awhile to get it and was a total PIA to get the new cap boards installed and make everything fit, but they end result is pretty awesome.  I would suggest it if you want a VESC enclosure and cant find a vacuum formed ABS or fiberglass solution that fit your needs.

My suggestion is not to confuse "case" with "enclosure".  The case still needs to be in an enclosure typically

@dg798 We use the ESC enclosure for VESCs also. You can use it for 12S or VESC doesn't really matter.
