I discovered the word 'frit' this morning and it led me to something i've been searching for for a long time. Ground glass for grip in any color i can imagine that i don't have to crush myself. 

https://www.aaeglass.com/glass/bullseye/frit-opalescent.html?dir=asc&order=position&p=1

Craft glass is everywhere, but its not worth buying if i still have to crush and sift it. But this stuff... the Fine grit is what i end up with after sifting my own. I did some more looking and found that frit is really just silica and some other compound used to create the desired effect, then heated to form glass and ground up. In all the time i was looking for glass for grip, i never thought to mosey over to ceramics and glass blowing, i honestly don't know where my mind was. 

shits about to get sick up in here. 


I was tiring of grinding my own glass and started trying different grip tapes. I tried clear MoB. I tried clear Black Diamond. I tried a roll of clear generic a while back. I've tried sprays like Lucid and a few other brands. They all just suck compared to poly and glass on a number of levels so I keep coming back.

Glass cleans easy (with a hose and plastic brush), can be easily reapplied after a good cleaning if it has worn down simply by brushing more poly and sprinkling more grit, and doesn't detract in any way at all from top side artwork. It also lasts a little longer than even things like Viscious if its locked in with a couple extra top coats. 

I need to listen to my gut more and quit wasting time with bullshit.

BTW clear mob and clear black diamond are the shit on white boards or boards with light woods or light stain colors. The further you move from whites and bamboos and nudes though the closer it gets to crap.

No, I saw it, but i couldn't bring myself to pay $35 for a pound of glass. If the frit is to irregular though i may try it. 

I just bought a pound of crystal clear frit for $14, and also got some 5oz sizes of several opalescent colors. 

@briman05  how regular/clean is it? IT looks great on your board but did you have to do anything to clean or sift it before you use it or was it pretty prestine? also, link me.

The 30 mesh is a little rough and I have had some stuck in my hand when I’m first applying it. What I do it put several coats of spar urethane down between the glass and the deck. Then a wet layer sprinkle the glass on where you want and how much you want let it dry and then do a coat of spar over it and it’s good. If you want to put more you can. To me the 30mesh is about as course as blood orange grip

I’ve got a natural wood board where the grip is almost imperceptible.  I’m not 100% sure, but I think it’s sand.

You can only really see it close up, or, if you light it up at deck height.

![image|666x500](upload://lUPxpkgg3RNCGqNHhO05Oc5qcRz.jpeg)

Probably not the gnarliest grip, and maybe best suited to wood if it imparts colour.

Do you apply one layer of resin, apply the glass, then another layer on top, or how do these things work?
Have no experience with this stuff and only did a few test with various griptapes.
Also what brands do you prefer and why?

But 90% of my boards have either vicious or seismic griptape. Seismic last an eternity but quite expensive.

The sword board was a one time thing, i'm not doing anything like that again i don't think. That tree pattern is something i have used in all of my builds since day one. that's where i put the phase wires for the motors, and its a big part of the reason i'm using glass grit in the first place and have been since i started out. In fact the sword build didn't even have wires in the wire channels because of how the rest of the board was set up, so i illumuinated them with 12v red LED strips instead.

i simply use spar urethane, the outdoor formulas resistant to sunlight and abuse. Minwax makes a good one in a water based satin or gloss. I use satin most of the time but occasionally gloss. 

i do a thick coat of poly with a foam brush in sections, and sprinkle in grit in each section before moving on. It dries kind of fast and you want it to get in there while its good and runny. Then after its mostly cured, i take that foam brush and just stab on another coat making sure it gets all in and around the granules. then a third one to make sure its good. 

even with two coats to clock it in you're still going to have a few grains that refuse to stick. usually i just flick them off and then spot treat anything i misshed with a dab of poly and a sprinkle and another dab.

This is the satin Minwax water baed poly with crushed Ragu bottle glass. I have some Pyrex too, it's actually a little clearer, but i thought spaghetti sauce glass would be a better match for a weed board.

i'm actually trying out fine grit of the frit. The medium is closer in granule size of 30 grit. what i'm going for is a range of granule sizes between .2 and 1.2 mm in size (as they define "fine" ) which is basically what i ended up with using the two flour sifting screens i got from the grocery store to sift this grit seen on the board above.  

if it doesn't work out i'll try the medium, but i suspect it will be good.

@longhairedboy I was thinking about ordering some glass frit.   How do you like it?  Do you still recommend "fine" over "medium? 

I am plannjng putting on a coat of clear polyester resin, then letting it dry a bit and get tacky, then sprinkle on an even layer of glassfrit.  Then letting it dry and brush off the frit that didnt stick and seal with another coat of resin. 

Thoughts?

I think after some use i have decided that the fine is just too fine. 

I've got a couple pounds of medium sized frit coming, 1 of opalescent black and 1 of clear transparent. 

The majority of the fine chunks are probably big enough, but there seems to be a lot of dust as well. I'm hoping the medium has less dust. 

However, the fine looks pretty decent... once you get a few coats of poly over it it resembles melted sugar:

Awesome, I thought the fine looked, well, fine.  I am going to grab some medium frit and try it out.  I skinned a landyatchz dinghy in this star wars fabric for my kids board and the clear MOB is just not quite good enough TBH. Are you using standard water based polyurethane?  I have polyester resin, but I guess I will grab some polyurethane for the frit.

yeah the clear grip tape is basically garbage, even from MOB. It looks ok on light colored boards but not ona nything dark, and glass-n-poly looks soo much better on everything. 

I use minwax clear spar urethane, water based. Usually i use gloss but sometimes i use matte. 

That mini cruiser looks sick. I love it.

Way I have been doing it is by putting a layer several layers of spar urethane down and let each one dry before starting the next and light sanding in between.  Then when you are ready for the grip coat.  Lay down a layer of spar like previous and then sprinkle on the glass frit and let it dry then put another layer of spar on it and let it dry then your are finished.  I like using waterbased spar as it dries quick and it brings out some nice grain and tones in the wood.

@longhairedboy is correct the best surface you can put on your board is crushed glass or if you buy it like i did its called frit and you can get it on amazon. This is what I used one my board,

https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Clear-Transparent-Fusible-Medium/dp/B07CY212NT/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1532745538&sr=8-3&keywords=frit+medium+clear

It is awesome grip and I believe can last longer than most of the components of your build however it is time consuming.

The benefits are:

1) better grip than the best tape on the market
2) you can do any number of colors and put below the grip surface graphics will be protected and last.
3) it cleans up much better than grip tape with a little bit of water and soap
4) it does not peel on edged as most grip tape does over time
5) It is custom

The downsides:

1) It takes time!!!! to do right
2) you need to prep the board surface properly
3) It is is a permanent finish (however it can be repaired or enhanced)

So above many comments have been added to how to properly apply but here are few additional items I learned on my first board.

1) Put down a couple of primary coats of SPAR urethane.
2) Don't rush sanding as it will just clog you sand paper.
3) Don't rush coatings as if the previous coating is not cured it can get gummy which means more sanding.
4) Apply glass frit when urethane is gummy.  Pay attention this stuff can flash up quickly.
5) Over coat should be dabbed on with brush it you brush across frit it will cause air bubbles.

Here is final board with frit installed...(The white hue is due primarily to the fact I brushed last coating and got air bubbles remember dab it on!!

![image|282x500](upload://1UnYJdmaysEaIrxH4zE3Yh6zHvG.jpg)

Overall the best coating you can out on a deck,  when completed you will feel the difference at it is significant.

Good luck,

Kevin

I usually do 3-4 base coats but I use the brush on kind so it can be very thick coats.  Water base is usually dry in like 3-4 hours depending on the temps and humidity of the room its in.

This is what I use.  https://www.amazon.com/Minwax-630520444-Water-Helmsman-Urethane/dp/B001W42A24/ref=asc_df_B001W3YPRS/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=193168541182&hvpos=1o4&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4884513100844998032&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003983&hvtargid=pla-311135402851&th=1

the way i've been doing it lately is without even brushing on an initial layer. I wet it heavily with a soft bristle brush and sprinkle in the frit in sections. Usually by the time i get to the end of the board, i only have about 30 to 45 minutes longer to wait before i brush on the second coat. 

I often do 3-4 coats on top of the frit to lock it in. 

One of the interesting things about it is that when your feet finally wear it down, it can be patched easily using the same methods used to create it in the first place. In fact, its more work and less return to try and sand it down first, so don't bother. 

A lot of my customers just enjoy it while it lasts, then go ahead and grip over it with MOB or Vicious or something when it finally wears off.

## \#57 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2018-08-15T11:12:45.208Z Reads: 270

Definitely. The pigment in the dyed veneer is often soaked up by the poly resulting in swirly candy red/clear areas of the board and add a dimension to the finish. I don't see any reason why you couldn't add additional pigment to achieve a desired effect.

I am planning on giving this a go in the next couple of days.  Home Depot doesn't carry miniwax anymore!

Thats the poly I was going to get, but instead got this triple think stuff.  I don't know if the added viscosity will be a good thing or a negarive thing in this application.

@akhlut. Check it out.  I still need to sand, paint, and seal the bottom and edges of the deck.

I used epoxy to lock in the glass frit instead of poly, but I will add a light coat of waterbased poly in a rattle can over everything after I finish the bottom and edge.  Looking pretty sharp though!  Great find/idea @longhairedboy!

everything @briman05 is saying has also been my experience. Even with five total coats you can still get several 40" boards out of a quart can of minwax spar urethane in whatever flavor you choose. Water based spar urethane is the best. 

if you happen to be brushing it onto dyed veneer that has only been sanded and not clear coated, i would suggest using a cup to dip your brush and not just dipping it in the can. My red veneer turns my poly a swirly pink color which looks cool as shit but will turn the whole can pink if you don't pour it into a small cup first.

I'll grab my broadsword, that'll get the blood going.  @briman05 I did about a third of the board at a time, put on a single coat and immediateky spirnkled on the frit, then did the rest of the board.  I waited for it to dry, brushed on the loose frit from the first application and patched in more poly/frit in the bald areas.  Waited for the patches to dry, lightly brushed off the loose stuff once more, then two coats of poly/drying after to seal it all in

Man, I like using epoxy much more. Really locks that shit in there more so than poly IMO.

Also, I did poly tests with aerosol and brush on.  Deffo I think brush on for base layer and first over coat or two.  Then a layer or 2 of spray on for finishing.

I thought this produced the best results second to using epoxy

It depends on what I am doing honestly.  But typically sand, one layer of epoxy, sprinkle grit, cure, one more layer of epoxy. 

Then I do a spray on layer of this

Darn, cus i have sprayed a nice color and stencil on the top of my deck and want to retain it while having glass frit.
[/quote]

that's literally how i do every board. 

sand the deck, paint the deck, die cut some vinyl stencils and art up the deck with spray paint, the poly-frit that shit, then poly, then poly, again, then poly again, and sometimes poly again.

You're probably using an oil based one. I had the same issue. This is what I use, its water based.

Aside from spray paint (for which i just built a small painting booth for) , and epoxy for the wire channels, we use all water based paints and finishes. I refuse to deal with oils where rags, brushes, and any kind of cleanup is concerned.

To me it seems that glass is the way to go i want my art on top. I cannot find a frit supplier in the UK but then i thought it looks really like glass blasting sand we use in ‘sand blasting’. Has anybody any ideas on that?

Oil based urethanes will cause yellowing. You will want to use water based like LHB said. I use Hellman’s water based spar. There is also general finish that is water based. I have even used polycrylic when I was doing rice paper wash outs.

I am wondering if I should lock in my fine frit even. It feels well sunk into the epoxy..

![image|666x500](upload://7qUHz4NG1oH7hD0IMsVEvwt1umN.jpeg) 

Any good way to know? My epoxy is quite too thick to stab the board with a brush and hope I don't raise the level so high I will lose the point of frit. :smiley:

If you run your hand over it, it should feel like griptape and shouldn’t be able to brush any off.

I doubt I will be able to brush it off. I didn't wait enough time for the epoxy to start vulcanizing and dropped the frit. It's quite sunk in. I guess when it fully solidifies I will try to use a brush on a tail or sth, if I don't lose any, I am good to go?

Yeah, that looks fine really.  With the fine it can do that if you don't wait a little before dropping the frit.

But that lools fine honestly if the friction amount feels good to you.


I am just in love with medium frit! Really locks you in!

I will see how it feels once everything is solidified. I might try medium frit on a second board, but I think it will need way more locking in. :slight_smile:

With medium frit, I drop the frit as soon as the epoxy is down.  The sink in is good on medium frit. Locks it in really well

I will use this information to presume that if I dropped my fine frit after waiting measly 20 minutes(40-60 minute vulcanization period) it will lock fine as well. :smiley:

Well, after allowing the epoxy to harden initially I can say that the result is perfect for my first attempt. :smiley:

I mean, it does have 2 small spots where I Scrooge McDucked on glass frit (in general it feels like it would cut any patch of skin on my body instantly), but I guess I could just sand that spot and the repeat the previous step? Maybe some other tips regarding "adding what was not added in the first try"? @Sender

I have started to always lightly sand with 120 - 220 grit sandpaper over all the grit and everywhere really.

then thoroughly cleaning, then final clearcoats with spraymax 2k clearcoat. 

This removes the super sharp stuff and yields awesome results.

In my case some frit in the middle decided to actually sink below the layer, yet on the outsides it's fine. So I guess I will see how the grip is after 24 hours have passed.. I think I might need to use some nasty low grit sandpaper if I want to recover. But that's my favorite thing about epoxy I guess. I can sand it and recoat and it will stay as clear as it was. :smiley:

Also I guess that's why you use medium frit. :stuck_out_tongue:

@murloc992, looks awesome. Where did you get that fabric from? Also how do you have that matte finish? Doesn't epoxy make the surface super glossy?

Fabric is custom printed by a guy who made the deck itself here, locally in Lithuania.

Also, what do you mean by matte? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

![image|666x500](upload://gfvazA7asPzfskBqqEZkObPcy4x.jpeg) 

Lighting can be deceiving. :slight_smile: 

The problematic spots can be seen, but I don't think they will impact anything. If they do, I have sandpaper and I am not afraid to use it. :smiley:

## \#164 Posted by: briman05 Posted at: 2019-05-06T13:04:11.974Z Reads: 90

Yeah that is fine. The 96 COE deals with glass fusion when you are doing glass work.  COE stands for Coefficient of Expansion and deals with how much it expands or contracts when it is heated or cooled.  So you don't need to work about that unless you want to put molten glass or your board.
