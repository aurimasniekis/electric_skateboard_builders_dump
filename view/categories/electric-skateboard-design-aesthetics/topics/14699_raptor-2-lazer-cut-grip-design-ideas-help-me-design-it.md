I liked the fat stripes like in the video of the prototype in the hill climb video.

Personally I think simple with just company name on it,  it's a bit of a stealth machine anyway. 
Get too fancy and it will start looking a bit naff.

What about something like this one? That "raptor" written in the middle is not the best, I think a logo like the "E" of Evolve fits better the look of a board

return to it the beta flair with the slash marks. Its fashionable to be retro, and an original design from a beta stage era  could be what was right all along.
then again, I like my boards fully gripped.
maximum grip!

Do you guys have any suggestion for me?![IMG_20190227_005448|666x500](upload://j4xb6rZ45TWZWamRn9hqVfPw4PS.jpeg) 
![IMG_20181018_205330|666x500](upload://sCore5zy4BivTKfijlaTVpBMqrb.jpeg) 

I am thinking something like these 2. I feel these are a better fit to the curves of the board as compared to hexagons. Can someone with an artistic eye comment on it.

I wasn't sure if I should create a new topic or post in this topic asking for design suggestions. I realize it's for raptor 2 though.

What are you using now? Your board seems without grip tape. I actually prefer it like thst. Otherwise grall fritt only where to stand in it could be a nice solution to still see the natural wood.

I haven't been using anything at all. Because of the drop and the concave I already feel pretty secured. But turning at high speed, sometimes I feel it would be nice to have some extra grip.

BTW, I decided to go the glass frits route and it ended up looking terrible.

I had to do quite a bit of work to restore it to normal. After restoration:

yeh probably black on brown is not the best. Maybe bettwe fine glass frit just in the sport you need it and clear.

you didn't like it ? Not enough frit, and to maybe too big also ?.. But I think I like it ^^ maybe with more small frit, and not on all board ... IDK but some alternate (I think I will let the front and rear tip and the middle free, and I like the black frits matching all your black part and wheels etc.)
But I'm saying what @rey8801 already says I guess ^^

I tried this spray grip from skateshred and its perfectly clear and gives a decent grip however not as gripy as regular griptape.

Oh the grip was awesome(the big frits would go inside my shoes and bit and just lock in place), I just didn't like how it looked. I just love the dark wood look. Maybe like you and @rey8801 suggested a fine glass frit might be better and that  maybe even a transparent one. I feel like it's going to take a lot more experimentation than I am willing to undertake. 

@M.Hboards, great find. From the image it looks like it shows the grains underneath, that's actually ideal for me. Also looks convenient. Will give it a shot.

Yes thst clear grip that is good. Only thing that tends to detach and you find on your hands and cloths of you scrape it. At least that what I have seen from reviews

What grit of sand paper would you equate it to

Hard to say as the partials of sand are more spread out than regular sandpaper but prob around 80-120 grit.

Hopefully enough to hold you in? Seems a little low :thinking:

the clear grip spray that you buy from skateshops sucks indeed. one's better off buying some epoxy resin and glass frit
