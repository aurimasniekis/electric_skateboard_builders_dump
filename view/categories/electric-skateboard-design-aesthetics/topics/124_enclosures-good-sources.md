I'm eagerly awaiting all of my parts arrivals and starting to think a little bit about enclosures for the ESC and the batteries. I'm shooting to have them separated to both sides for weight distribution like the Boosted. 

I'd like to have it look as clean as possible. Any suggestions on where to look for that sort of thing? I went with a VESC and a pair of 8s lipo's (Compact 4000mAh) so I'm thinking that two smaller enclosures on each end of the board should be good.

After hunting around for a while and trying a couple of different metal box configurations, I decided to make my own out of Bondo fiberglass. I'm going to post that whole experience here soon, but here's how it turned out:

https://instagram.com/p/6n8ZJfhBnY/?taken-by=longhairedboy

Not terrible, but a little on the wavey/lumpy side. Also i totally wouldn't blame you if you were like "uh, no." because Bondo fiberglassing resin is horrible to work with. It just happens to be readily available at Lowes and its a third of the price of something real, like West System 105. I'm not going to waste words lamenting its horrors here, as I have a build thread planned out in which the true terror of Bondo will be revealed. I will post it as soon as my rig is reassembled and ready for pics.  

Also, Vacuum molding of ABS plastic sheets is a very good option for the DIYer. I'm going to try that next. ABS sheets can be had cut to measurements from TAP plastics for about $10 per sheet. A vacuum table can be built from leftover 2x4s and some pegboard, then plug your shop vac into a hole in the side. Use an old metal screen to make a metal frame for your ABS sheet then heat in the oven till it starts to droop, pop it on the form, flip on the vacuum and "flump" you have a box. 

All that aside, I just did a precursory search and found that Alien is completely out of their carbon fiber boxes, in fact they seem to be out of all of their boxes. They used to have a pretty wide selection. I just can't recommend metal boxes after the experiences I've had with them, but i believe @torqueboards is designing a plastic box that should hold what you're talking about. I'm not sure when that's going to be out though. 

I've seen a number of plastic "project boxes" online though and if you google those you may come up with something close enough. 

But what really got me interested in making my own using the method i used was the fact that its basically the only way to have one that follows the curve of your concave. Even Alien's were flat on the bottom and unless you use an identical deck to make your vacuum mold, even the ABS option won't match up with your curve. 

Hope this helps.

If you are fastening your vacuum formed abs to the deck it will flex to match the concave of your board so a flat mold isn't even an issue.

It can be a little bit of an issue if you're anal about a snug fit and want a really clean aesthetic as he mentioned he did. Yes the screws/bolts will force the flanges into position but what ends up happening is the box warps a little bit and there is some small gapping that results, and the flange will get a little wavy between the screws. 

but of course if you don't have much of a concave or have a deck wider than 9" and you run everything down the center line it becomes less of a problem than if you're turning your packs sideways to fit more of them between your trucks or running a single taller pack next to your ESC and receiver when using a shorter wheelbase deck. I have a concave double kick, a bustin yoface, so it was a problem for me as its basically a 41" popsicle trick deck.

I hear you, but it isn't happening at all on any of my builds. The fit is tight and none of my decks are flat.

@psychotiller so what thickness of ABS sheets do you typically use? I couldn't help but notice the way in which that box was so cleanly flexing over the concave and thought the thickness of the plastic had to play a role in that. Knowing its you making these has made you a target for my questions. lol

Newb question about these enclosures and batteries:

Do you not have to open the enclosure to plug the batteries in for charging? I thought they needed to get unplugged from their parallel harness and then plugged into a parallel board for charging. 

Do you just keep the connections outside the enclosure? 

Those enclosures look super nice. I'll definitely drop you a line ( @psychotiller )  once I know my exact dimensions.

@longhairedboy I have settled on using 1/8" or 3/16" for my enclosures. The one in the pic is 1/8". It is super impact resistant and just flexible enough at 1/8" to work perfectly on concave decks.

@siggs3000 I solder leads to a series or parallel adapter depending on the set up and then run a balance lead extension out of the enclosure so that I don't need to remove anything to charge or balance charge. (I also use a loop switch to isolate the electronics while charging)

@psychotiller good to know. I felt like 1/16 was probably too thin, so i thought I'd ask since I'm probably going to be trying this in a few weeks when nobody's home to smell what i'm cookin'

@siggs3000 You can also rig up a special cable and jack to bundle your charge ports into one port. @onloop uses a milspec multi-pin connector to do this on his kits, but you could do something similar with a different type of connector.

@longhairedboy It barely smells at all when I do it. I just start to notice the abs smell right about the time to take it out of the oven. Maybe lower your oven temp if it smells real bad.

I know for Kydex a laser/non-contact thermometer is really helpful.  What temp do you aim for getting the ABS to before forming?

## \#20 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2015-08-21T22:28:26.512Z Reads: 586

@sl33py  I believe it needs to be about 215-225 degrees. I use the smoker element in my oven and it doesn't have a temp setting. I just turn it on and wait for the abs to sag. It's been working perfectly every time since I started using that 110v element.

Making a universal enclosure is difficult.... every deck is different... 

I have been looking at a range of flexible materials. Like silicon or TP... many phone case are made using TP. 

This solves the problem of it needing to slightly bend/conform to a deck which flexes. 

But the mold fees are crazy expensive..  the cost of the mold was not much different then the cost of making a mold for a full CF deck.... so i invested in the CF deck mold instead... with an complete all-on-one CF deck that you don't need an enclosure! It's 2 in 1 so sort of solved a few problems. 

I'll be making at least two other CF deck shapes so i can cater to the various taste of DIY'ERS. .. not everyone wants a kick tail deck.

@onloop will do!  So you know, the flexibility of the abs does allow it to conform to different deck shapes. 
On another note, do you think your cf deck will work with my 6" wheels? I'm really tempted.

@siggs3000 I spent a lot of time looking, and finally decided to buy a plastic screw organizer and dremel out the channels to make room for my batteries. Here are some pics of its current state. In the third empty column I'll have a VESC, receiver, and a battery arming switch. 

The batteries are 4S, wired in series. Everything will be velcro'd to the enclosure and I'll add some extra foam padding to keep things from jiggling and to absorb vibrations. I've also got a nylon strap with a clasp to help keep things closed up. In the end, it will be spray painted matte black. If this approach works I'll be happy about the small size of the battery/electronics pack on the bottom of my deck! I'll also be pleased that I'll be able to easily flip the board over, open the door, and access everything quickly.

make sure you put some velcro straps or similar around that box, because you wouldn't want it to swing open on the move.

@torqueboards I'm interested in purchasing your [14" Aluminum Enclosure][1], but I'm concerned that it's not going to fit my [Multistar 4S 10000mAh Lipo Batteries][2] are not going to fit.  I was lucky enough to buy these when they were half price.  The enclosure's internal height and the batteries height are only off by 1 mm.

@claudiofiore88   The dimensions I used on the enclosure were verified by onloop. It was designed to hold the space cell and two vesc's. 
Aluminum does look nice I agree. It just doesn't hold up to the riggers of being on the bottom of a longboard.
Full disclosure,  One enclosure is on its way back to me right now because the guy said his vesc's wouldn't fit because of the caps (I'm assuming he added to the vesc's) 
All of the dimensions are listed for you to compare your components to though and I can confirm that I can fit 2 4s 10ah batteries and 2 ez run escs inside this enclosure.
Edit- the enclosure pictured here had one castle esc in it however I can modify the mold specifically for 2 vesc's if you give me the dimensions.

@claudiofiore88 yeah you don't want an aluminum enclosure. Too many screws and too many forces trying to bend the box in too many directions. Well, mainly one direction, that being across your concave curve. They just can't stand up to that and they fall apart. I already went through @onloop 's and @torqueboards 's aluminum boxes. Both have irreparable damage caused by vibration.   

My advice would be to get @psychotiller to hook you up with a custom ABS box or to make your own. I made mine out of fiberglass.

Alum cases would be ok if we design a special mold. Then we can get a custom extrusion that is suitable for the purpose we want. 

Otherwise the little screws that come with them can be problematic. In the end I was using red thread lock to keep them in place. But very hard to open again.

So to summarise. Aluminium can work but needs to be fully custom. Just like everything we make for eboards. Custom is king.

Yeah, they are old stock which is why they are still there. Aluminum is much bulkier and rigid. They are also much harder to open if you plan on swapping out packs.

Plastic is more forgiving and is a bit more durable for our application.
