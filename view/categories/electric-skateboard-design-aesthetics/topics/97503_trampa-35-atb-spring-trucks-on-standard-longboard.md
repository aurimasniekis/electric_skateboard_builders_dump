I am curious if anyone has used the 35° risers to mount the trampa ATB spring trucks 35° mountainboard channel trucks to a standard longboard? Like a drop down maybe. I have seen the risers/adapters for sale but havent seen many longboards using them(think i saw 2). Wondering how it would perform and how it would look. In my mind it seems like it would look good but idk thought Id ask the experts.
