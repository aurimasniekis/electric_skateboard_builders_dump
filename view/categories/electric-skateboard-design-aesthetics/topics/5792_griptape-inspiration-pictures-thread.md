Hello everyone, I'm trying to design something awesome for the top of my deck, which let's be honest, is as important a part of the deck as all the other parts ;), and well done griptape art, well it just looks Sweet!! :heart_eyes: 

So I'm starting this thread, to be a inspirational place, I want to see what you amazing people have done with your boards! And share opinions, Pictures, drawings, sketches, whatever it is STRUT THAT STUFF! :rainbow:

To start the thread off, I included some of my design ideas for my deck that I drew up tonight.

This should be an interesting thread.

Who can name this molecule?

The molecule is C9H13NO3 (Epinephrine) also known as adrenalin! The symbol kinda looks like a cross section of a brushless outrunner :D

I do custom griptape jobs for all of my builds, personal or customer, electric or not. Most of them I do by hand, but I have a laser cutter for the second somebody asks for something more complicated

@cmatson You really seem to like the stealth fighter style. I do too. The logo, carbon fauxber, and all the angles work really well. Almost to pretty to step on and ride. And all by hand? Well done. :clap:

Yep, I'm happy with how it turned out-

Was initially just going to clear grip on the logo (like it is now) and regular grip everywhere else, but the board was wider than the griptape, so I had to start cutting it up and improvising!

Clear grip over some sliced up stickers...I think it came out pretty gnarly looking.

My sis and i did this. Called it the kamikaze. NOT used to glorify WW2 Japan or offend anybody affected by what they did. I think as a grip job it's quite striking...

Here's my generic hexagon pattern I did the other day. I love being able to see the marbling on the deck, Still need to replace the enclosure.

been really thinking of doing this lately exactly like you did. What do you think of it and how much does it help the vibrations? Do you lose traction at all or not noticeable? I have the Landyacht/hammer foam grip-tape on my esk8 now but feel I need a little more thickness on the padding. A friend has the Loaded "pushin cushin" but that seems to be only an 1/8 think like my foam grip.... interested to hear your input and welcome any advice. Where did you get that piece of foam from as well. Is it just EVA foam like from a surfboard stomp/traction pad or what? I have been trying to find the foam padding/grip that comes on my wakeskate but have searched hi and low with no luck yet cause I think that stuff would be perfect!!! Thanks in advance.

Honestly it is definitely grippy. When i hit some very coarse roads and the vibration is really heavy i tend to check and see if my feet are moving around but they stay put!! It definitely adds a bit of cushion as well which is nice üëåüèº
