Guys,

I've got this board- http://www.skateshred.com/index.php/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/46-x-10-pintail-dark-walnut.html.  Anywhere to buy electronics/battery enclosure that will work with the sweeping curve?

You could check out www.psychotiller.com. Send Dave an email. I'm sure he could make one for you.
