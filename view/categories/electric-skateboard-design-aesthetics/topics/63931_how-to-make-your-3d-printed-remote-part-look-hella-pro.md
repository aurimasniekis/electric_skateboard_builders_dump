Remotes, they're as important if not more than the board itself. I personally go for aesthetics for my builds, so if the board looks sick, the remote must too. I'm currently getting into DIY remotes and unfortunately the casings are often 3D printed. Don't get me wrong, 3D prints are great and some can produce prints with fine resolutions that would be good enough for most. I do not like the look of a 3D print so i have a few methods of smoothing out a 3D print to look like an injection molded piece or even better! 

https://www.amazon.com/XTC-3D-High-Performance-Print-Coating/dp/B01BKSLI9M/ref=sr_1_2?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1533491772&sr=8-2&keywords=xtc3d

This is XTC-3D.
It's essentially a resin that is two parts, you mix the resin with the hardener at a 2:1 ratio and then brush it onto your print. It self levels so it will fill the lines and eliminate the 'staircase' effect that is caused by the printer.

I got a Photon remote months back, the print was very fine actually, but i went ahead and smoothed it even further.

This is just from one coat!
![20180523_234002|690x388](upload://80oLKop9Amh677ooqRiIuaoDo7f.jpg)

I sanded the first coat and applied a couple more to fill up the words. Sorry @Wajdi :joy: ![20180524_143028|690x388](upload://zOfB1idaPxlTapUW9fxqaeSJqQB.jpg)

And there it is! You coooooould leave it like this can call it done, or use a scotch brite pad and make a matte finish as you see fit.![20180525_101737|690x388](upload://hDLmUJsKqWOXNhthVIDHxErFcfq.jpg)

Hello there Plasti Dip

https://www.amazon.com/PERFORMIX-11221-Multi-Purpose-Coating-Aerosol/dp/B008J20R1S/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1533493501&sr=1-2&keywords=plastidip
![20180617_142422|281x500](upload://yidkALgzprLRGYRVHuFfWT8WVd9.jpg)

Plastidip is a rubber spray, usually used on flexible materials or on surfaces that need traction. This works great for remotes as it'll prevent slippage from the hand.

My method of spraying is one light coat, then a normal coat to get the surface wet, and the third and final coat is sprayed from about 2 feet/60cm away to get this  'orange peel' effect on the surface. Wait 30 mins per coat. 
![20180617_002621|690x388](upload://1UUrQ2zc1CG0eBw4bWAuc5mjYEd.jpg)

Here's some more pics of the surface. Oh! If you do this, spray a coat of primer first, and lightly sand the primer a bit, it'll give the Plastidip something to grip on.
![20180617_135832|690x388](upload://jfEerudnT7l7FlMl45ovCAlVeGC.jpg)![20180617_125328|690x388](upload://peeiNjakQCpVLLFE3ehTReO5jgE.jpg)![20180617_125253|690x388](upload://mw9gcpFNczOUZzJBpCO6gcLw9rJ.jpg)![20180617_125324|690x388](upload://aeqdYpmfJZWQhhl0E3yx2Y9TWi.jpg)![20180617_135839|690x388](upload://4A0GgB7vPYSJOJzlSgAAzAYHCKa.jpg)

But Lin! I don't wanna spend 20 bucks on resin! No worries, there's another method.

Acetone Vapor bath
![IiI5nKH|690x314](upload://u8FAYxZKvxn5xkJZIDsqV67Kpoq.jpg)
I ripped this picture from the net because i myself have not tried this. But i have seen some incredible results from others. 

Acetone is a solvent that is often used to clean oil from parts and also melts plastic materials and styrofoam, and a few others that i can't remember from the back of my head. Do note that if you're doing this to your print, **ONLY ABS WILL WORK**. 

Doing this with PLA will cause it to be very brittle and will snap rather easily. Not sure about other filaments like PETG or Nylon but do feel free to experiment if you have some acetone lying around. Do not try to brush Acetone on your ABS print as well as the surface when it dries will usually be worst than before. Hence the Acetone Bath method. It's a more controllable way to let the vapors wrap around the print and circulate, causing the print to slowly melt from the surface and fuse.

The pros of this is that your print will be 100% solid and stronger as the print lines are fused and becomes a single piece, with no risk of delamination. 

I'll link a video on how it works down below, using a cheap method with a glass cup and a paper towel with some acetone absorbed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyoefQ4k4BA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xFUNFG-UKE

So if you're doing a larger piece, use a bigger container **that is not ABS** and hope for the best! Do leave your print to dry overnight prefably after removing the print from the bath so it'll dry fully. 

Filler Primer

https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-249279-Automotive-11-Ounce-Filler/dp/B003CT4AM0/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1533491914&sr=1-2&keywords=rustoleum+filler+primer

It's a primer spray that fills up the 3D print lines, less mess than the XTC- 3D.
I didn't do this for another remote but i did use this for a little project i did three years ago. I made an Iron Man suit and got the fingers 3D printed. The rest of the suit was made of cardboard and then fiberglassed. 

Taped the 3D printed fingers to my cardboard tray...

![1|500x500](upload://8QFmbEflaUYnfXy4Z3A0Ez0HNYB.jpg)

Sprayed three or four coats, wet sand with 400 grit to even out the layers if needed
![2|500x500](upload://mQKhfiep413ilgA49f0F9x1sn8O.jpg)

Nice and smooth.
![3|500x500](upload://trHwupMBMhpVutObtBLGOPXbbEn.jpg)

Spray a few coats of your desired paint![4|500x500](upload://Tikh1Kq8jp4iw02RXGfwy4qaHP.jpg)![5|500x500](upload://qwn6jC0oFppTNAURo7wkvFa8Kwi.jpg)
But yea, the method is the same if you were to do that on your remote or belt cover etc.

Now, if you want to change the shape of the remote and give it some bulk for example, then you will have to use this.

 Automotive body filler/Bondo

https://www.amazon.com/Bondo-312-Autobody-Filler-Quart/dp/B0007ZE7XY/ref=sr_1_4?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1533492363&sr=1-4&keywords=bondo

This is a body filler, usually used to fix car dents. This is not recommended if your remote has a complex shape like the GT2B, you will have a lot of sanding to do. 

How does it work? It has the body filler which comes in a cake icing consistency, and a tube of hardener. The usual mixing ratio is 98:2, yea i know it's weird. But i usually mix a golf ball size, and two drops of hardener. So if you're mixing less, then divide accordingly. 

Commonly asked questions,
**Does more hardener make the filler stronger?** No, it'll just make the filler cure faster, which is not good because you will have lesser time to work with it. 

**Can i use the body filler without the hardener?** No, it'll never cure/dry and will remain sticky and yucky.
I'll link a video to how the body filler works, and how to apply it. In the video he's applying it to a car part, so if you're applying it to a small item like a remote, i recommend using popsicle sticks or poker cards.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRPEDZ7Q3vM

I did this method for a DIY remote @ervinelin made, as the model's edges were a chamfer, and i wanted a round edge throughout, so off i went.

I sanded the surfaces with a rough grit before applying, so the body filler has something to grip on.

![20180618_185008|690x388](upload://9D2hPxvh9Yhg7ZY5DvffDa8959f.jpg) 

Here's a tip, **PLEASE** work in one section at a time and use small amounts. Once it starts to harden, which is usually around 2 mins, it'll gum up and won't be like a cream anymore. The piece above started to harden, as i was working too slow, and it balled up and the surface was bad. Nothing a little sanding can't fix, but it's extra work. 
![20180618_190211|690x388](upload://sDbldH8iPQ5JXKy5BhXLSJApszl.jpg)

Kinda look like chicken legs.![20180618_204956|690x388](upload://2rvmeQdcuCRx7oeb5ElBMF0if5t.jpg)

After some sanding. Note that you won't be able to get it done with just one coat. You have to sand each coat, and then fill up any imperfections with more filler.
![20180619_002815|690x388](upload://44vHc3IxdLLJ2JYpQLQtGkebiP7.jpg)

After three coats, sanding in between and got it nice and round. 
![20180619_002830|690x388](upload://dwEVeFGenSCrXPOzDHLquIzi08F.jpg)

In comparison with the 3D print![20180619_002842|690x388](upload://41OifxJq8u9AHSiy5Jl0JH1z8wp.jpg)![20180619_002911|690x388](upload://60geIv5RuA0zi5JAieCrPFcQchU.jpg)

After that, spray a couple coats of primer and choose your color of choice and call it done! I went with the Plastidip method after that and it looks really good. I chose Plastidip because it has a rubbery feel and won't slip off your hand easily.
![20180619_235350|690x388](upload://r28NHmc18apvXHmrBOYjegwCgYE.jpg)

![20180619_234955|690x388](upload://wHKlhwL7UmNEz1XjtdSXlnEUMs6.jpg)

![20180619_235357|690x388](upload://idxjzSRCoR5HESgIqmcRodkUOL6.jpg)

So yea, these are the methods i use to turn a 3D print to a professional looking piece. If you guys have any other methods, do share with us as well!

Wrapping Sugru around a remote? That's gonna cost a few packs haha. I'd say spraying Plastidip would be easier and have a more uniform surface.

You do commission work? Lol
There's a 3D printer at the library down the street from my house I've been meaning to use.
I just bought a benchwheel Wheel remote but I've been kind of wanting to do a DIY.
Or at least a custom shell.

Great guide, thanks, will definitely try some of it

I did acetone bath a few times, the big problem is to know when to take it out, if you leave it too long the acetone begin to dissolve the whole print and it can loose shape

Also give a try to MEK, from my experience some ABS compositions don’t dissolve enough with pure acetone, MEK is way stronger, also great to make a slurry and use it to glue parts

I never tried actual hydro dipping but i did a 'poor man's method' which worked for me, basically spray paint sprayed onto a water surface, and it makes a very abstract oil look. I'll see if i can replicate that and perhaps add that in.

Okay, i've got another finishing method but it's spray paint related. Do smooth the print slightly with sandpaper first or follow any of the above steps that is not the Plastidip. 

Here's what i did with the Photon remote. I removed the Plastidip as it can be peeled away if you dig in with your fingernail very hard. And that's one of the issues. It's a nice rubbery and grippy surface, but in terms of durability, it's not the best. Hence i recommend this next technique. 

The 'sediment spray' technique. I just came up with it i know right?

![40307405_249858925869586_8275855668141883392_n|690x388](upload://zHsrTrTD6V6sciuW9sRtK69lDet.jpg)

Well, omit the green splatters if you want, it's mainly for aesthetics. 
Ok here's the rundown, similar to the Plastidip, coat #1 is a light coat. Coat 2 and 3 are normal spray coats.
Coat 4 and 5, are to be sprayed 2 or 3 feet away from the piece, and evenly spray from all angles. Note that this will use up a lot more paint than usual. The trick here is to get the paint mists to form sort of like a fine powder, and have it adhere to the painted surface.

And finally on the last coat, do one light coat normally like coat #1, so the 'powdered' surface gets a little wet from the final spray and bonds together to form a slightly rough but grippy surface. If not, the surface will feel very powdery and the paint dust will just get all over your hands.

For this method i recommend Krylon's spray paint.![40282913_495037134304853_293324263199342592_n|690x385](upload://pHSGQANSbDGP7PuM56W3OOZ3bXO.jpg) It works extremely well on plastic and does not require a primer, because it is a paint and primer! It sticks like a champ and will not peel. I've tried to violently scratch the painted surface and has shown no signs of peeling or burnish. 

If you'd like to follow the green splatters, use the same brand if possible so there's no adhesion problem due to incompatibility, and the method for that is to spray the paint into a disposable cup, and use a popsicle stick or chopsticks and flick it over gracefully to get the splatters. You will notice that the splatters will be a tad bit thicker on the remote, so it's up to your preference. 

If everything is done right, you will get a very nice paint surface that is both durable, and grippy.

I like this method the most so far, and i plan to peel off the Plastidip on my other trigger remote as well and paint that green with red splatters soon.

Really nice. I don't dig the splatters but the spray paint job is looking awesome.
Perhaps some experienced EU members could chime in with paint/filler/primer alternatives that we can get here because many of the options mentioned are either hard to source in EU or very expensive to ship.

My friend @nuttyjeff is in the midst of getting his mini remote mod made, and handed me a few casings the other day. I used the body filler method as i wanted to add some bulk around the edges as it's a 45 degree chamfer than a round edge. As it's a relatively simple shape, it's easier to sand. ![20181029_070751|690x388](upload://8x4BwRRIu9AFfJeth5n1hyXcGPb.jpeg) ![20181029_212626|690x388](upload://76EqZhRPgOzekDNl2lRllj4NnIk.jpeg) ![20181029_081154|281x500](upload://6qeFFQvFBZ7kcQVtDpk8MVMMAF3.jpeg) 

A couple coats of primer after sanding them smooth![20181103_070019|690x388](upload://60AiqDgqD9S60niY2omdyPGg0AD.jpeg) ![20181031_123017|690x388](upload://xu7vNZFAT3wBpUpc9dcX5tFdA2V.jpeg) ![20181103_070007|690x388](upload://pQuMPeyFvMCNjK1JaFhCYrRl0lW.jpeg)

Sprayed the first one a fluorescent green.![20181104_173834|690x388](upload://3g5XJutx5buZGXdV1WQxtNxldxJ.jpeg) ![20181104_173838|690x388](upload://x8KGTOCzA1tHyKZt3Tt5rwGS9Ya.jpeg) 

And comes a metallic look that i'm trying out. The gist is basically an undercoat of black, then silver, and then candy color of choice. Candy colors are transparent, so the silver underneath will show, giving a metallic look. I did a red and emerald green for Jeff's and mine.

Heh it's almost the same color as my Calibers!

Finish with a few coats of clear coat to protect the color and it's done! I noticed that between a matte and a gloss clear coat, gloss seems to have better grip and will stick to your hand better than matte.

I have been looking to get this spray for the longest time. It's a two part truck bed liner spray, similar to Line-x, that indestructible spray.![20181209_233332|690x388](upload://oXyUi4FqEIF8G8uTmvkDgPTj5Ve.jpeg) 

I got the Samurai Paint brand as it originated from my neighboring country and was able to get it locally from a distributor. Check out the durability test which they did!

I bought a few cans for myself and a few friends, and decided to spray it on all of my enclosures. All of my enclosures are fiberglass and normal paint is still prone to scratches, so this spray is the most suitable for enclosures. ![20181209_221532|690x388](upload://h4OGAFn9LsBecWR8xTXyQ9TIeK7.jpeg) ![20181209_225735|690x388](upload://aPL4FLrAgtfCJg9EMPrK94EioGP.jpeg) ![20181209_105010|690x388](upload://ho3csgkUFQvNA85iXlcQEymMKPf.jpeg) ![20181209_224518|690x388](upload://lLT6yKoiinGAPWPY7jMhXBjFAvx.jpeg) 

It has a rocky texture, but is not rough like sandpaper, so it provides traction, since it's used on trucks to prevent cargo from sliding. Hence i thought it'll be good for a remote as well.

I like it, some may not like it as it might look like asphalt haha. If you would like to protect your enclosures and give your remotes some traction, this spray is the best candidate. 

Keywords to search would be 'truck bed liner'.

Do you first paint and put all the nice goodies on the enclosure? Or first assemble and then the rest?

I install the enclosure on the deck and check alignment is all good. Once it's all done I remove everything from the enclosure to spray

What do people use as a top coat? Is the paint good enough?

Paint itself should do fine, but if it gets scratched the paint will get scratched off. The top coat protects the paint more. The brand of paint you get from should have a topcoat as well. Lacquer or clear coat are words to look for. 

Good spray can brands are Rustoleum and Krylon
