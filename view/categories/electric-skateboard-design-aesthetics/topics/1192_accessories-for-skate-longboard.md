Hey guys 

I recently bought a pair of ShredLights from their website for my board. I gotta say, they are really bright for how tiny they are. I barely even notice them on my board. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a04fb7ed78ddcbaa1156fd0d44c8e68a3c05c49a.png" width="690" height="459">

There are these decks i saw at a local skateshop that had lights on the bottom similar to your picture. The headlight and maybe a brake light would be AWESOME ! Not just for coolness but also because when you're riding 20 mph at night, you better know where you're riding.

I used a HRD DC-DC Converter 24V Step Down To 12V 3A and x2 Eagle Eye 18mm 9W LED Lights and a rack mount ear from an old Ethernet swicth to mount the lights in and screeed it to the deck.  Total cost was less than $5.  They are pretty bright too.
