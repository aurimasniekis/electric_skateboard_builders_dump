They come without batteries and it seems like all other electronic parts are also not included (besides the motor)

yup.  but still - looks like they've put a lot of thought into their offering, and it looks like good value. am pretty sure that at some point the electrics will appear too, if only the battery & ESC.

I am waiting for the battery and esc also...just got a christmas gift idea for my son. I was trying to put all of the parts together myself.. this is just too easy to pass up.
