Last week i recived my order from Sickboard.nl 
![20181119_160809|666x500](upload://khIvWeC9MQ5asncPLOsLETApXGr.jpeg) 

First thing i did was starting to cut out hexagons... this was such a pain to do.
Made a total of 30 pieces and it took me over 2hours.:joy:
![20181119_175913|374x500](upload://w9Onab9DjHxIXozUZxpRSS6R75c.jpeg) ![20181119_164122|374x500](upload://sHLg2KgprJAsg9z2Hwc7Bsl1hZd.jpeg) 

Testing the layout to make sure i made enough of them
![20181119_180545|374x500](upload://ghC7P3jtA4FLgo7y7LLadbF6hRC.jpeg) 

I didnt like the deck color so i decided to change it to red, i was so insipred by eboosteds Darth maul so this project will definitely have similarities.
First thing was to sand down the deck completly and then add 2 layers of primer.
![20181119_193500|666x500](upload://4Ecl1KbSXnS46oDk2Il6RW5zqgz.jpeg) ![20181119_192443|666x500]
(upload://eIJdl4EEVXRB82DAXNOxxqJbR7T.jpeg) 
Next the red paint
![20181120_164357|666x500](upload://rX7D3zShzpAaj11h4DHvjjFvgI2.jpeg) ![20181120_164346|375x500](upload://mTDxHU0NYSY4s1VEmWNU0L4UbjZ.jpeg) 

The motors and trucks i bought from a friend who decided to sell some esk8 parts.
I bought motors, trucks, pulleys and a benchwheel remote with reciver.
![20181120_132950|666x500](upload://uTrzEtN6OgS3EFen1G9YD2bAsXP.jpeg) ![20181120_185048|666x500](upload://8aacUVqh5JandoATXrJOuS8Lak4.jpeg) ![20181120_185054|666x500](upload://hKZQTvsw5Fr68QGctZcbPB4N29K.jpeg) ![20181120_143259|374x500](upload://wzdhwdfIdZQ5wtD0iNvhm67wmXN.jpeg) 

On my last build i used the maytech v2 remote and i was quite happy with that one. Loved the fact that i could swap speed modes on the fly!
The benchwheel also seems to have a good rep but i keep reading about bad recivers. I dont know yet it the remote i got works so i will need to test it out first before i decide on what remote i will use.
If i understand correctly the benchwheel remote needs to be shut off and turned on again to swap between speed modes? 

Focboxes are on their way and i will set them up with a ppm y-splitter. On my last build i tried canbus and it ended with fried vescs so i dont really have any trust in canbus connection. It seems like a hit or miss. 
Split ppm is also safer if the master decides to quit for some reason...
Ive also heard that the canbus issue on the focboxes been fixed but i dont know for sure how to check if the focboxes are the updated ones.

Battery: I was first thinking of getting 12S but after some reading it seems quite risky you want to try Foc.
So i think i have decided to use a 10s battery just to get some peace of mind.


Will keep you guys updated as the project evolves :) 
I appreciate any input :)

cool build man.  If your focboxes are the new version they don't have the canbus issue anymore.  Then you can still use your bluetooth.

I am guessing but they will have an updated hw version.  Check the version you get and ask either on here or the enertion website.  I think its 1.7 but not sure.
Canbus is not that big of a deal if you protect yourself though tbh.  Never disconnect while powered up and use a fixative to make sure they don't accidently come out.
```

Another con with Canbus is if the master fail everything fails. Feels a bit safer with split ppm. 
Can take some photos on the boxes when they arrive and we can see what hw it is :slight_smile:

True I only use split ppm for that redundancy.  I haven't used canbus for ages but then I don't use bluetooth either so Its fine for me. Just make sure to snip the 5v cable to the second vesc.

Yep used canbus on the previous build, poof blown drv... Went to split ppm and had no issue for over 1000km. 
It just gives me a peace of mind when I have a backup if something goes wrong.

Same.  I just like everything simple.  Very reason I don't use bluetooth too.  Been hearing about the apps re flashing settings on the fly.  Loss of power etc.  I travel too fast for those kinds of shenanigans.

Yeah you're right!  @dareno 
Btw how do you feel about those 97 mm wheels on 16/36 gearing? Is there plenty of torque? I loved the torque on my previous build with dual 6355 16/36 90mm wheels. 
Maybe 6374 can deliver the same torque with 97mm?

I found the torque on 10s to be good tbh.  6374's with at least 4p will pull me up hills no drama.

Some minor parts arrived today!
- Enclosure spacers
- Enclosure screws
- Y-splitter
- Motorscrews 
- 1 sensor cable
![20181122_163304|666x500](upload://dBRK6mBI4F2QCFejtzttZ0fyg0t.jpeg) 

Did a test install just to see what riser im going to need.
On the pictures a 1/2 riser is installed. I do however think that i may be able to use 1/4 and still have clearance during full turns.
Another thing i noticed was that the tb 218mm trucks feels super weird, they have huge play in them so i probably need some other bushings and pivot cup. (Any suggestions appreciated).![20181122_165559|375x500](upload://50xaUlG5C2Fu6Hrb5nxDyP03gye.jpeg) ![20181122_170342|666x500](upload://qGEgQwQCRqH2BCLEa1w4wCbfvL2.jpeg) ![20181122_170556|666x500](upload://wUgRJ3kEVoscc2NBFgp6SmTL3L2.jpeg) ![20181122_170418|374x500](upload://93PX1P98ie0kZo8WJ3YBuZDC3EN.jpeg) ![20181122_170346|374x500](upload://oX9LvKL7uxdwExbuAanFnP8xo3r.jpeg) ![20181122_170352|666x500](upload://fYB7xSayohqJrXlcSFnY3i5lWhP.jpeg) ^

Guys I need help to make up my mind! 
Should I get 90 or 97mm refly wheels for the build? 
Dual 6374 and 16/36 should be punchy even if I use 97 instead of 90mm? Decisions decisions....

test mounted the trucks today, my boxer girl approved! 

I did also notice that i think im going to need to use 19mm risers just to get clearence for the motormounts and cables. 
With 12mm riser the mount hits the deck on full turns and there is also very little space to let the cables ride under the motors (may touch doing hard turns)

The height of the deck as it sits with 90mm wheels is 12cm. Im guessing that it will be around 12.5cm with the 97mm wheels.
What do you guys consider to high?

If you want them to last for ages you can coat them in some epoxy resin and sand it down a little.

I do that on everything i get 3dprinted, also makes it look less 3dprinted.

Looking bloody good so far!  Hear you on the height thing but with forward mount motors there isn't much else you can do.  Thats one of the reasons I run reverse mounts.  You could try wedging the rear truck away from the deck but then you are getting into the realms of complication.  Finish it ride it and fall in love my friend.  Great looking build.

Todays  tasks

- Install the enclosure
- Drill the deck to make room for the m4 inserts
- Solder bullet connectors.

Started with drilling the enclosure. 
Used masking tape to point out on where to drill the enclosure, decided to go with 6 screws along the sides.

![20181212_100058|375x500](upload://fzwO2RbhSWWX6dTvs76VxiJZ5Zj.jpeg) >
Next i taped the enclosure to the deck just to make sure it wouldnt move out of alignment. 
Made a small mark on the deck using the drilled holes one the enclosure.

![20181212_101001|374x500](upload://98Ky3gwTQZr47Tp4MhxEyM1b7qG.jpeg) 

Next i used a  4mm, 5mm, 6mm and 7mm drill bit to make the hole big enough for the insert.
This helps to prevent the wood in the deck from cracking.

Then it was time to install the inserts.
I found that these inserts i got from ebay works great, on my previous build they were solid and never caused any issues.
Its important to make sure not the tighten it to hard, when  you feel resistence STOP. Its good enough.
m4 inserts.

All done!
![20181212_103756|374x500](upload://4Re906I37u45T903edA43eYBRFq.jpeg) 

Test install the enclosure with the aluminum washers.

Looks amazing IMO

Looking good my friend.  Nice use of tape for depth.  Old trick but effective.  I use a  bit stop now and thats just the business.  Little collar that grub screws onto the bit.  Stops the eventual slip and full penetration.   oooh   full penetration.  :sunglasses:

Looks clean, like the rest of the build.  I just HATE those inserts.  Those have been backing out on me unlike my other board with slotted.  Did you use any epoxy when inserting the insert?  Also are you attaching hardware to the deck or to the enclosure. 

Oh and I love the aluminum washers!  I have a set of red ones in case you need some.  Although, I think the red ones I have are M5's.

On my previous build i had ZERO problems with the inserts.
Dont use any epoxy or such i just screw them in with a screwdriver.
I think that most people over tighten the inserts and it makes the wood go soft. I stop as soon as feel that it bottoms out.

Im going to attach the hardware to the enclosure. I been thinking of attaching it to the deck for easy maintenance, haven't decided yet.

So i test installed everything and noticed one of the motors was making this high pitch noise. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N03AJhm2Y-A

It was really noticeable during the test ride...started to google and found out that this tb 6374 is quite prone to have issues and the first theory was that it was caused by loose magnets.
So i went a head and pulley the motor apart to check for rubbing.
![20181219_201204|375x500](upload://sfFzTuxKafpBpKYkhiOLbEnf2fI.jpeg) 

This tool is super useful for this application, and i works great to remove motor pulleys to!
![20181219_202100|375x500](upload://oZJXWeFO2iBdD7FDk7H7s2UeXEV.jpeg) 

There where some rubbing marks on 2 magnets and they where loose and also had cracked on the underside of the magnet.

One of the broken magnets 
![20181227_114013|374x500](upload://3n5ZmJOvqQah80v1OnUuVxnoTjw.jpeg) 

I decided to ditch the motors for now until i can get new magnets and hopefully repair the motor.

I fortunately found a great deal on some 6374 190kv sealed motors that im going to use instead!
The new motor was a bit wider so i had to remove the clamps and reinstall them further apart to get some space.
Installation of the motors.
![20190102_210418|374x500](upload://j18BQZRvBuAzKQlmhOVZfiVUgrH.jpeg) 

I noticed that i couldnt remove the motor when the pulley was installed and it was due to the mount being thicker at the end so i took the dremel and made some room so i can remove the motor in a easy way if i have to. ![20190102_210425|666x500](upload://7FdLOAuWP9sRpVwp1er7c6c8Coy.jpeg) 

Both motors installed.
![20190102_214244|375x500](upload://cBINniqZPUh5gLfVyoMPk7KOxYf.jpeg) 

I did order a metr module last year but unforuntatly it couldnt be used with my phone so i had to upgrade to the metr pro.
Did the wiring and installed it inside the case
![20190104_100819|375x500](upload://h1BHvKJLV43asIEYqsjOUBTkkho.jpeg) ![20190104_100816|374x500](upload://fXOLmJ1jajzP0kFlxHvrz9QaB1X.jpeg) 

Installed everything and programmed the vescs.
I first wanted to try BLDC but i was not able to do detection so i went the FOC route... Had no issued detecting in FOC.
Used the following settings on each vesc.
Motormax 60A
Motormin -40A
Batterymax 30A
Battery min -8A

Foc felt really good, no cogging at all and the startup from 0 was amazing.
https://metr.at/r/vVeOc?fbclid=IwAR1tCZawgQ1eAhiCzhp4k-IqmMrQngenIK4MEp_cKaxZ5B_EZ3MCd2V6U_M

I think i will up the settings to 70A on motormax and 40A on the battery.
The motors are only rated for 70A so i guess its best to play it safe :slight_smile:
Now its 98% done!

Increased the settings to 
Motor max : 70A 
Battery max : 40A

Feels great, acceleration is crazy from standstill but im a bit disappointed on the top speed, its around 40km/H at 70-60% battery so probably around 43km/h on 100% charge.

Placed a order on 18T pulleys so my setup will be 18/36 with 97mm wheels, hoping to get around 46-48km/h on  full charge :) 

Super satisfied with the results!
Foc really makes it feels more refined and braking is so much better in FOC compared to bldc.
Now lets just hope the focboxes can withstand the settings in the long run :crossed_fingers:

Did shoot a acceleration test. 
Its crazy... fast as a mother ****

Today i recived some AT-wheels. 
Will start with adding some paint to remove the chrome lip .

Then i need to cut off the flange on the motor pulley , cuz at the moment the tire rubs on the pulley,
I guess AT is more suited for reverse mounts since it will add some clearance.

Unfortunately the At wheels didnt work on my board so i had to pass them on to another member.
Been enjoying the board for about 100km so far and its running great. 
Foc is really mind blowing compared to bldc, its so smooth and accurate in a way thats hard to describe. Bldc was great but its not very easy to control when you push a lot of amps. 

I love it, its the raptor 2 killer i always wanted ;)

This build looks awesome!
I'm waiting on my first esk8 board from ownboard (w2) belt drive. If I like the thrill I might build something more powerful if I would outgrow the w2. 

Anyway, where did you buy your parts from?

Thanks for the prompt answer. Yes I live in Scandinavian in eu.

Thanks for the tip, did you buy the drop through deck there as well? Because I can't seem to find a clean drop through deck anywhere without all the colors on the bottom. Just looking for a clean deck if I'm building one myself. 

Thanks
