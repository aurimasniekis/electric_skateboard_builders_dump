That's amazing! The LED's are a really nice touch!
Which ones did you use, and how are they powered?

I just picked up some LEDs from eBay and siphoned off some power of my electric skateboard power system .... It's good times

That's what I'm talking about! Time to give the hoverboard some real credibility again. How did you do the graphic? 

Just had a thought that the Enertion Raptor's shape would lend itself well to getting an optional Hoverboard graphic overlay like this. For all those folks that would still love to buy a production "hoverboard".

Here is a better look at the two other boards that I created. This was taken on a trip from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier in California.

Black 40 X 10 free ride board with blue LEDs, head and tail lights 
White 33 X 10 kick tail board with white LEDs, head and tail lights

moved your other topics to this thread- try to keep all your posts concerning your build in the same thread, as to not create too many irrelevant topics.

How did you "siphoned off some power of my electric skateboard power system" ? 
Can you explain in layman's terms and some pictures as I am "electronically  challenged".

```
Battery -- to ----> ESC and On/Off switch-Stepdown converter to 12v 

Power----->ESC to remote and Motor
Power------>On/Off switch -> Stepdown converter to 12v -> Lights

Basiccly, what it is above ----->

The Battery then split the wire from the battery so it goes to the esc and the Stepdown converter which drops the current to 12v .... Then hook your lights to the 12 v output.

I have a switch to turn off the lights and a light modulator to control the lighting effects .... Slow glow, flashing, solid lights etc..... 

Best to test lights by mocking them up and making sure you have everything wired correctly. 

Good luck

I'm curious if you increased the intensity of the under lighting maybe it would flush out the wheels and give a better effect?

And make the wheels +trucks the same color as the lighting

none of my boards have under-lighting. This is so i can sneak up on my prey and devour them before they see me coming or figure out what that weird electronic warbling is that keeps getting louder behind them.

Is the green led as well or is it because of the blue LEDs? The wheels look like kryptonite!
