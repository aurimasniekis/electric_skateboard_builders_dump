Hello,

I'm a student Engineering in Ghent, Belgium. To get to school everyday i wanted to try something different. I decided to build an E-board. The idea came long ago and did some testing but never really worked it out. But this week I don't have class and decided to start the build. First off, the specs:

SPECS/PARTS

- sk3 6354 245kV motor
- 5000 mAh 6S lipo
- ezrun PRO 150A

DRIVE TRAIN

In the local shop they didn't have any HTD belts/pulleys in stock so i went with XL-type belts and pulleys 9mm width. They didn't have aluminum ones so i will order some online. The setup is 15T-36T. The wheels are 69mm but plan on getting ABEC clones 90 (?) mm. A friend of mine had a lathe which i could use to widen the pulley hole. I used my drill press as a lathe to get the truck completely round at 15mm.

I'm planning to CNC a custom motor mount at school, but for now i made a quick custom one with aluminum scraps.

FUTURE PLANS

- Enclosure: i'm thinking about custom fibreglass or maybe vaccuum formed one
- Charing: adding GX16 plugs for easy charging without opening the case
- Motor mount: custom CNC aluminum mount at school
- Pulley: ordering new pulley in aluminum. Has anyone got a CAD model for the ABEC wheels? I want to make spacers and drill holes very precisely at school for a custom sprocketmount, like the diyelectricskateboard style
- Wheels: ABEC wheels
- I might go for onboard charing, boosted board style

I'll probably make a complete new set up, this was some prototyping. I want to make a real clean board

Has anyone used the EZRUN without a fan? I plan on integrating it in the enclosure with the heatsink mounted to the outside, it would work i guess?

Don't forget that the core is molded, you can't have your tolerances to tight.

This is not my drawing, but the description states abec 11

Used a temporary case and make the cable look nice and tidy

On the ezrun i have 8 possibilities for motor timing. What is the effect of low-high timing?

Made a new mount. Only using jigsaw and files <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f4147ffd7d6937bd804ae6db3147eb5823765137.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e945318e910cee8e1e5840361817ff35323ab781.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/ffa4761658538da2932a6257abc5886f8d932ec0.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5d8267dc530043886e89b5d50b2f0b11ac6f1c90.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

I also like your multi purpose drill press. it's a lathe, its a mill, its a drill press, call now...steak knives!

Bought a new deck and got the orangatan kegels. Right now i started On a fiberglass enclosure.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/91ddff36ce8a5c21bb6c1c81b99f8fe4e62e1b8e.jpeg" width="690" height="459">

I'm running 6s right now but want to go up. Would adding 3s be good? Or is running uneven Numbers not recommanded. Am i correct to say with higher voltage i use less amps and get a bigger range at the same mAh than with a lower voltage?

Yeah, your right. You should just go 10S or 12S. 2x5S or 2x6S.

@Mathieu That's right, and you also get more "punch" in acceleration if you need it, and a higher top speed. I use 8S and I my build eats hills. 10S or 12S are more common though.

So 9S is not a good idea? Or will it work just as good
```

We'll for 9S. You'll need odd packs together to get 9S and/or (3) 3S packs for 9S.

It's easier to unplug only 2 packs so it's better to go in pairs of 2x cells in series. 4S,6S,8S,10S,12S which would be 2x2S, 2x3S, 2x4S, 2x5S, 2x6S.

Problem is i'm running 6S right now and my battery broke down. The esc i have is only up to 6S and i'll probably have to wait on the vesc for a while

It does work. It's just not practical. I would regret the decision if I went that route but that's just IMO.

I'd say just get a new 6s pack.

there's nothing wrong with 9S do it.
if you had asked can I use 33V? everyone would have unanimously announced "YES"

people just don't like the sound of 9S call it 33V next time. every body loves 33V
