Just got these: http://imgur.com/a/yT1IQ

I'm building my own DIY board, and only have wheels and a remote left to buy, was wondering if these could be used? I see they have the custom drilled 'thing' in the middle, can these be used with Enertion mounts and pulley? Or will I have to adjust them, or are they just simply not useful for a DIY build?

Does boosted use a 15mm belt? They look bigger than a 12mm.  If so its gonna be a bit difficult finding a motor gear and belts. And you're limited to using caliber trucks for clamp on.

Yeah, it definitely looks a lot bigger than some. These are probably not that useful here haha. If there isn't a solution, might just have to sell or not use them ever.

I'm currently using these wheels on a build.  The Boosted wheels use a 15mm belt on a  HTD 3M pulley.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0cebe9ac51d2710ae3c6535ee019a5ffc620f314.jpg" width="640" height="428">
 I'm using TB  V3 mounts , TKP trucks, Ebay motor pulley, SK3 6354 260, TB 12s esc, battery undecided (leaning towards making my own).
