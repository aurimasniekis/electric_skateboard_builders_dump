Hi! I'm a new member but have been reading this forum for the last couple of months whilst researching my first build, I doubt I'll be able to give back anything that's not been done before but everyone likes a build thread.

I've never really been into skateboarding, but have snowboarded for the last few years. I had the opportunity to have a go on @HighMasterGogo board during it's prototype/build phase something just clicked, since then I've thought of little else!

I'm 32 and getting married later in the year, and part of that is finishing the full restoration of my 1966 Beetle, which is where all my time and money really should be going (I have a forgiving fiancée!). So this build has to be efficient, quick and as cost effective as I can tolerate. 

I've been compiling parts over the last few weeks whilst getting to grips with pushing around on a longboard, I had a week in the snow over Christmas and wheels have come more naturally than I expected - bonus! There's a couple of bits left to buy, most of which I'll be bringing back with me from the States at the end of the month, then it'll be straight into the build which should hopefully be completed mid-February.

I'm a huge BTTF fan and riding about on an esk8 is probably the closest I will ever get to being on a hoverboard - certainly how it felt! My build will have a nod to the infamous Mattel hoverboard but subtle and not in your face with neons and the like.

Before the pictures and build spec, I will just take this chance to credit and thank @HighMasterGogo as I'm relying heavily on his expertise and experience. My board will be effectively a clone of his with just a few styling differences. Having a good mate with his own 3D printer is invaluable, as his electric skills.

**• The Deck** - [Two Bare Feet "Maverick"](http://www.twobarefeet.co.uk/skate/longboards/bamboo-collection/two-bare-feet-maverick-42-inch-2017-bamboo-fiberglass-longboard-skateboard-complete.html) I wanted something clean and don't really like the cut outs for drop-throughs, the composite bamboo and fibre deck sounds ideal for this sort of project. £59.99 from £89.99 at time of purchase.
![mktbf012-maverick-004_1|375x500](upload://vDmU20Y78H2l1kNxqfjxF9FzoO8.jpg)
**• Motor** - [Street-Wing 6374 190Kv](https://street-wing.com/product/6374-190-kv-motor/) Firstly I cannot thank @DavidBanner enough for his patience and help throughout. He's a knowledgeable chap and if all companies ran like his the world would be a happier place. I went a little different to @HighMasterGogo for two reasons, mainly this is a sensored and sealed motor and where I live is often windy and inclement so the more protection the better but also because of the satin black finish which I really preferred. £113.99 from £136.78 at time of purchase.

![motor_6374|500x500](upload://bBRi05XRC0N7IgOAAmy2z9gFUsh.jpg)

**• Motor mount** - I've not purchased one yet, but planning to use the @WSB Stealth Motor Mount which will complement the Street-wing motor and Caliber Trucks perfectly and looks like a great bit of kit for the money.

**• Trucks** - As I mentioned them, I'll be picking up a pair of 10/50 Blackout Caliber II's, bought through ebay.com £40 at time of purhchase (~£60 in the UK) 

**• Wheels** - I would love some Abec 11 Pink Flywheels but cost and availability makes then not viable at the moment, second choice would be a set of the Boardbumpers 97mm again in pink but AU$75+shipping also pushes them over the budget. For now I'm going to pick up a set of Flywheel reps off ebay.com as they're under £25 with a set of Abec7's and spacers included. No doubt these will be upgraded to one of the more premium options quickly, but they suit the theme and are inexpensive.

**• Electrics** - HighMasterGoGo has a fried BMS we're hoping to breath life into and use on my board. I've yet to buy a VESC but plan to use the well established FOCBox and power will come from [2x Turnigy Nano Tech 5s 35-70c LiPos ](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-nano-tech-5000mah-5s-35-70c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html?___store=en_us) wired in series to make a 10s1p battery.

**• RC Control** - based around an ebay FLYSKY FS-GT2B (UK supplier) and shoe-horned into a 3D printed "Baby Buffalo" thumb throttle case.

That about sums it up for now, the bottom enclosures will be 3D printed in a garish purple/pink as will the GT2B case. It might clash with the wheels, not sure yet, but I want to acknowledge the colours of the Hoverboard - even the power switch glows purple!

Thank you for reading, next update should involve a lot more pictures, I know that's all you're really here for :call_me_hand:

How much flex does that deck have?  If it's got a fair amount of flex you may need to consider enclosure and battery options to allow for the flex

Its not too bad, but have taken that into consideration. Enclosures will be either end tucked as close to the trucks as possible and using a decent gasket to aid water/dust resistance.

Couple of bits ordered, massive faff using UK Paypal and shipping to a US address but I found a work around through ebay!

Some very subtle 97mm Flywheel reps
![s-l1600|500x500](upload://3qqlUeoVbpj2I4lHSykJ8NYW7lJ.jpg)

And a pair of Blackout Caliber II's

![s-l500|500x204](upload://k2WSgbPDtOlrH2yaOcetNbUqjVY.jpg)

Total spend including shipping less than £65! Or what you'd pay for just the trucks without shipping in the UK :+1:

watch out for the import duty, VAT and handling fees. Hopefully the package will slide through without getting hit.

VAT is the killer for me, adds 20% to the prices I need to charge - nightmare!

You could Cheap out on the motor, You will only use 10s

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html

And the battery is not such a good Deal either,
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-heavy-duty-5000mah-6s-60c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html 
If you use 2 of these batteries in series You will have 12s instead of 10s and higher C rating!
Better range and top speed and it costs less.

And maybe buy flywheel clones from Amazon.com and ask them to wave shipping. worked for me! 
(Import taxes are Charged in check out)

Besides not Being Budget It should work great!

Baby blues are @HighMasterGogo 's to have a play with whilst we build mine in a few days time.

They look great and ride better, the Caliber II's are massively better than the stock TBF trucks and the wheels are smooth and fast.

Only consideration now is colour for the the enclosures, they were going to be the pink-purple but I think it'll clash with the wheels. As the trucks, motor and mount are all satin black I'm thinking black might be the way to go  🤔

They're great quality, wide and well put together - they come with quite soft bushings, I'm planning to change them just for stability at speed but with the 97mm reps the board felt brilliant.

Build has started, we've got all the components together, most the soldering done and loom is about made. We printed a pully set to check it fitted the reps and that's now printing properly ready to bolt up. I've tidied up a spare motor mount with some satin black and drilled and re-tapped a chewed up thread. Short of a couple of bolts and some 3D printing we expected to be riding later today, that is until I realised the motor mount isn't adjustable and a 270 belt is far too short. Two 320mm are being couriered next day, frustrating but can't be helped. Pictures;

Its seems everything is conspiring against us, always the way! Longer belts were ordered for next day delivery but they've had a mix up so they won't be here until tomorrow, although rain and snow would have stopped play anyway. The BMS @highmastergogo had hoped he'd rescued is toast so having to charge with a hobby charger until a new one arrives in a few days. But other than that, it's about finished, just a few 'training wheels' parameters to set on the VESC until I get comfortable riding.

I'll add some more pics and a cost breakdown once it's finished in a week or so 🤙🏻

New Street wing mount replacing the non-adjustable mount I've borrowed from @HighMasterGogo. This solves two issues with the rolling prototype, firstly I couldn't get a belt small enough to not use tensioners and tensioners made the board hesitant to accelerate and brake. I'd hoped to have solved this going from a 325mm to 305mm belt but it was too tight. The board felt fantastic, it accelerated hard and stopped well but it wouldn't coast when I came off the power and after a few minutes the belt was trash and the 36T cog melted. 

Bit the bullet and sent @DavidBanner some more money but its a great bit of kit and obviously matches his motor and my Calibre II's perfectly. 

Just waiting on a new cog and 265mm belt and then back out on the road  🤙🏻  

The 97mm reps are great to ride, they're grippy, fast and roll over most debris without any issues. With the motor limited to 1000 output and crappy belt setup was comfortably getting 15-18mph. As soon as I replace the bushes and dial in the new mount and belt I'll take it up to 2000...

New mount and shorter belt fitted and totally changed how the board feels. Also finally finished installed the BMS with the help of @HighMasterGogo

Had a few issues and ultimately the board became unusable;

Firstly I had issues after riding for a while at a constant speed where I'd gradually lose power, checking the stats on the phone app it seemed the VESC was getting too hot (85-90°C) and restricting powers. I've since drilled hopes in the case to allow airflow as it was pretty well sealed and I assume the BMS was warming things up too much? This seems to have reduced temp down to 78-85°C, which still seems hot but didn't trigger the power restriction. I'm not sure if my gearing is off with 97's as I'm running 15/36T, seems plenty people have the same though, might go up to 40.

Next, it developed an intermittent issue where the motor would just instantly stop when at high speed and full acceleration. It generated a current error which I think might be an issue with software settings and will look at ASAP. 

Finally, it started cutting out or had unusual throttle response until it lost connection altogether and displace no VESC detected in the app. I assume this was a connection issue having rewrapped the loom when installing the new mount. It turned out to be just that and will be testing it this weekend to see what, if any issues are still there.

On a positive the bargain Chinese USB lights are great, and some new raiser pad/mounts are being printed and I've bought another pair to run two front and back 👌🏻
