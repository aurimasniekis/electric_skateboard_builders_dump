Itâ€™s alway hard to juge with just only a picture, best tricks I can give you Is to try it first with a low voltage power pack (with not much current) to make sure everything power up the right way.

This is where a Lab Power Supply comes in real handy.

If you knew my power supply, you'd love her to.:wink:

A good trick to ensure all those little legs are attached, is to after you have hot-air-soldered it, press them with a small flat-head screwdriver and heat with a soldering iron.
Another way, which needs more careful solder applying, is to apply just enough, certainly not too much solder on center ground pad(which is good to do anyways), then use hot air, and when it has reached the melting point, push the chip down, so it really attaches every leg.
And before soldering, ensure the legs are slightly bent downwards or perfectly level.

About the pin near the phase, although it looks like a short, it usually doesn't spread past that gap easily.
