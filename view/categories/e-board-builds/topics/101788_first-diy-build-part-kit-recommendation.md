Hi, I want to build an electric longboard but find it very difficult to find the parts I need to achieve what I want. I have therefore chosen to look at various kits that contain most of what I need, but since I have no experience in electric longboarding, I hope you with more experience can come up with some input.

I want to build a board that has good range (25km ish) and a top speed of around 50km / h. Do you think it is possible to achieve these requirements with a budget of 1350 $ / 1200 â‚¬?

I've looked at different kits, which I'll link to at the end of this post.

I can also say that I live in Norway, so it would be very good if it is possible to send to Norway :)

I am about 188cm tall and weigh about 90kg.

One big plus would be the ability to change from regular longboard wheels to all terrain wheels and 110mm wheels.

The kits ive been looking at is:

Yeah thats true, hoping to find a small walkaround for that. Maybe Ask them to post a lower price on the package or mark it  as a gift.

Ait will check into that, thinking about getting a pre build battery, guess thats a good place to start instead of making one myself.
Is the fucbox a good vesc? The price is very different from sites to sites.
