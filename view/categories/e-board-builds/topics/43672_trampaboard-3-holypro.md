Hello people.
Who using boards of 35 HolyPro Carver 16ply and Mountain 17ply. 1) Is there a difference in driving between these two boards?
2) Can I use the HolyPro Mountain board ABEC11 89mm wheel, and and the turnover on the HolyPro Carver board HYPA wheel? Will it be comfortable?

The Holy Pro is not the Carver! It is the Mountainboard Deck.
If you buy a Mountainboard with Ultimate Trucks and Urban Drive, you can swap wheels from street to pneumatic. You will need the #45SC clamp in addition, and a shorter 375mm belt.

The Board rides nice with both wheels, but once you are on pneumatics, you probably don't want to ride street wheels any more.
