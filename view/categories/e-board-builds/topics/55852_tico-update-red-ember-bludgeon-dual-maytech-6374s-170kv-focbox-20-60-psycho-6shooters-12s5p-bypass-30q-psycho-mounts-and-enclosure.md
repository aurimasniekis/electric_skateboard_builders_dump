Alright gentleman and @Sapphirinia (you're the only lady that I know is on here) I really need to start some build threads and I have a few projects in the works.

This one has become my baby.  First, I must admit a few factoids to get it out of the way....

Yes, I didn't grow up on skateboards.  I started staking in bowls with my bambino 2  years ago.

Yes, I come from the illustrious Boosted Board background (but that shit is still fun, pretty damn reliable, and just fucking easy.)

No, I knew nothing before this.  I didn't know shit about electronics (still know just enough to make me dangerous 😉). Couldn't solder, couldn't lay fiberglass for shit, actually didn't dabble too much into anything that I would call genuine DIY.

Yes, I like beer and I am 5 IPAs deep and counting.... this might be a bit long winded.


So no shit there I was circa 10 months ago when I discovered this amazing builder's scene.  I quickly got the itch, and got it pretty bad.  So, l started reading. And reading. And reading.  I didn't even make a username on here for a couple months.  TBH, I didn't feel like I even deserved one.

I found myself absorbed.  Studying.  Fucking studying, like a lot.  It is hard to say how many countless hours I spent researching and watching "how to solder"  or battery building or whatever I could find.  I knew I didn't know shit, still don't really, but maybe I know enough, you know?  I mean I have somehow spent 18 of the last 216 days on this forum, it would be depressing if this tracker also logged all the reading/research/drooling done not on the forum. That's ludicrous. I mean, its probably a little unhealthy, but I digress.

So, fast forward a bit..   I ordered tons of stuff, I mean like a lot of fucking stuff.  Great things from Build Kit Boards, a couple grand to muir skate for God knows what.  An arduino spot welder.  A Rorockit to use for something or other. A hakko soldering station, gobs of stuff to learn how to solder.  Stupidly $400 to Composite Envisions, for resins and fiber because I am a fiberglass/carbon fiber expert now (lololololol).  Though I did spend many hours watching videos from Chris and Steve at Fibreglast.  It's a good time.

Happy to say, my wife didn't take the kids and leave me...

So I don't want to get too damn sappy or anything, but I appreciate you guys.  This has been great for me.  Ever since I got out of the army in 2015, I felt kinda shitty about a lot of things. I had a rough time in the army, I was a Green Beret medic, and saw a lot of fucked up shit worked on some friends who didn't make it.  I Missed a lot of milestones of my growing family.

Getting out, I was really happy to have all this time to spend with my family, but I still felt like I was a little lost.

This place has reinvigorated my love for learning, because I had forgotten.  This place has introduced me to new friends.  How lucky am I that fucking @mmaner lives within driving distance?!?


So, thanks guys. Thanks Mike. Thanks @GreasyGearsWRX, thanks @eb1925, thanks @Deckoz.  

And the vendors are fucking awesome too.  I appreciate @JLabs, @psychotiller, treenutter, and @longhairedboy for putting up with my dumb ass, you guys are great!

So before this turns into a complete novel (woops, too late), I want to show you one of the boards I've been working on!



So I knew I wanted something cool, fucking shocker.  And what is cooler than a custom made gorgeous, jaw dropping deck? Very little in my opinion.  So only one place to go: RED EMBER BOARDS.
   
He doesn't push his product at all (honestly because he has no need to), but @treenutter 's work is simply exquisite.  If you need a bad ass deck, message that guy. Like now. Do it. And it is cool his website is password locked.  I felt special when he gave me the password.  Yes, I am a dork.  The ordering process and his cool personal updates are truly one of a kind.

Check this Red Ember Bludgeon out!!![20180326_160644|281x500](upload://A7p0ThfNBu1lMSaa4stw5wh9pVZ.jpg)

Mmm pretty black (but you can still see the awesome wood grain and midnight blue edges)

****Let me take this time to inform you that I am typing all of this on my phone and it takes forever to dig into my albums to find the older photos, so sorry if their orientation is wrong, I will try to fix it later.

I wanted to build this one with very high quality components, so I went with Surf Rodz RKPs.  It took them forever to come in as they were out of black hangers and I got upgraded to these sweet adjustable base plates for free!

![20180326_160728|281x500](upload://oLOG9YLrulbN6mUEPyZJisuavYv.jpg)

For motors, I hopped on some sweet SK3s from @barajabali. Sensored 6374 190kv extended cables.  Damn do I love shiney.... I come from a Harley background, so chrome and black is super dope to me.

 
As for mounts, there is truly one option if going Surf Rodz. Psychotiller!!!!  His stuff is fucking bulletproof and rock solid...  and comically he let me trade those black hangers I waited for so long for a brushed hanger because I thought it looked better...lol! (Thanks man)

Yes, I will be taking off that powdercoat on the clamp so it matches....

![20180514_183649|476x500](upload://2aunGPt5n0ofJrt6HPZuCd7VfUK.jpg)


Battery wise, I am going 12s5p discharge bypassed (thanks thisguyhere) , and I am making it.  I just finished a 6s3p with my arduino.  Some  guys on the forum, had a battery building party at my climbing gym. It was a blast!  Of course I had to reach at to Deckoz for some backup and will need to again, rest assured. 

I still need to take a day this weekend to build this one, but the cells are siliconed and waiting.    
![20180429_140535|281x500](upload://bB1SanL2XBhzcFT8myXxUDxQ4g1.jpg)![20180429_130451|690x388](upload://tbgouGvcyvZUgujuHUAG73H8GTv.jpg)![20180429_165817|690x388](upload://bx2KSwucbUXqc1fsdvrV7IIie0r.jpg)

For the enclosure, I was planning on making a custom fiberglass one.... remember that $400 I spent at Composite envisions?  It was for all this mess.  I am not going to detail my Carbon Fiber adventures here.... I will save that for my "Learner Burner" build thread...
Spoiler alert, it is a pain in the ass.  I dont regret it at all though because I learned a lot and am getting better...

However,


Wouldn't you know it, fucking psychotiller makes some bad ass enclosures tailor made for Red Ember boards to boot!

![20180516_125542|690x388](upload://x09Rz5QLIx2XpPXa30ueFfNBr0g.jpg)

However, I wanted to do something fun with it so my whole damn build isnt a "carbon copy" (pun intended) of a psycho build (shit it still is, there are MUCH worse things to model after...actually there are few better).  And I want to build my electronics into the enclosure instead of onto the board, and I felt the ABS enclosure better suited as a dust cover.  So.... Carbon Fiber skinning! Yay!!!

Don't mind the "scuffiness" of that last picture, I am still in the middle of the process.  I just keyed it and will apply 3 more coats of epoxy tomorrow, then more sanding, a final epoxy coat, and polishing.  Already looking pretty fucking sweet though.  If you are curious about the best process, listen to this guy:

https://youtu.be/aqwhcfQZT8U

I am going to be using some dickyho 15mm pulleys because the fact they can house bearings and there is plenty of room for that on this build.  They aren't here yet, but I will update when I get em.....

Mmmmm griptape.  I know it is a little overdone, but I am going with hexagons.  I think the dusty clear MOB grip is going to be dope and will pop with the brushed aluminum components and shiney motors.

Hexagons need to be pretty accurate, so I got these awesome quting templates to cut them and it worked a charm!

![20180512_104031|690x388](upload://x5TxzJKwAZECzJEoGMtAQO2PWMb.jpg)

Oh yeah.  One other sweet little detail before I help my wife get the kids to bed (I think she is pissed at me for sitting in the sofa silently typing all of this on my phone).  Deckoz pointed me in the direction of "fender bumper washers" for a little flare.  They have tons of colors on amazon, and I feel like they really tie shit together.  ![20180501_221523|281x500](upload://hYheBNOEhixVQvVhcxKiGfNgyIm.jpg)
![20180517_205922|302x499](upload://pE1eRMVuALOgj2u6a8IRX9mZjnv.jpg)

Look at how cute that match is!  Obviously not mounted yet because I need to finish my skin job.  But it is adorable.

Once again.  Thanks everybody.  I will update this thread as I finish this one up.  I will put my 12s5p battery build here as well.  Please all you experts, help me not burn my Loft down....


I will start my "Star Board" and "Learner Burner" build threads soon.  I will try my earnest to keep them more on track.  

I doubt anybody made it this far, but thanks for reading!!!  

I will fix all my typos and mis aligned pictures later.... it is tough on the phone, and my laptop got "orange juiced" by my two year old a month ago and I still haven't gotten it fixed.


CHEERS!

You are a couple weeks ahead of me.  Same deck, surfrodz tkps, psychotiller enclosure and 107's in-hand.

Waiting on batteries.  Feels like I ordered them last year, but its been 3 weeks.  Literally killing me.  12s5p as well.  UPDATE!  Batts will be here on the 25th!  Yay!

Psychotiller enclosure with a carbon skin? Dude...how the hell didn't I think of that... Lol.

Thanks for the shouts. But, you have made a piece of art on your own...(well you pieced together the masterpiece) if ya know what I mean...

Thanks man.  It is going well, but am running low on Duratec primer for my plugs and such.  

I am finishing up this small enclosure for my bambinos "StarBoard".  And also one for my "Learner Burner"

They are fine, but I did ger a good bit of cosmetic air bubbles so will either paint or skin them with some more carbon.

You've really captured here what we all have experienced in our building -  a passion for absorbing new knowledge, the thrill of working a difficult problem over and over, and the connection to all of our friends here that help along the way. Thx for sharing this, made me smile!

Haha yeah I'm surprised @Sender is one of the first I've seen grab them since the Evo.  They're great though, I think the real benefit is being able to use smaller hardware (m4) but still achieve the head width of an M6 for clamping force. :)

Spend the extra $100 on a vacuum pump, drip reservoir, and the consumables to vacuum bag it.. you'll end up extremely happy since you can't work from the backside... Your working face is exposed.. best finishes come from vacuum bagging.. or like what Tim is doing... Alot of love and working that jerk muscle...

 https://compositeenvisions.com


Here is a great source.  Way better prices than most places I qas able to hunt down.

I am a complete amateur at this, but have a casual "dabblers" knowledge at this point.

As far as skinning is concerned, stay away from polyester resin. Go Epoxy.  It is so much less toxic and it is easier to work with as it can have a longer working time.

I recommend:

https://compositeenvisions.com/system-three-silver-tip-epoxy-resin-kit-with-slow-hardener-2132.html

You can get smaller amounts and it is easy to work with as you use a 2:1 ratio.   It also wets our very well without being too "runny"

The actual fabric you use is very important.  If it isn't "soft" and pliable enough, it will be a nightmare to try to get it to conform to more complex shapes like an enclosure, but might be fine for deck skinning.

Check out that site, there are tons of cool options, but I have had the best luck with stuff that is around 6grams or so..... much more and it is pretty rigid and is harder to conform to things.  

If you see sonething on there you like, show me what it is and I can possibly steer you if it will work well.


But, I know very little.  The experts on here are @MasterCho and @bigben.  Guys, correct me if any of this info is way off.

So, if skinning, watch that video I linked above several times and pay close attention to time lines. It is very important.

I will say this:

@Eboosted enclosures are some of the best and they hold a lot of detail, especially that one.

I wouldn't skin that guy.  At most I might use an hvlp sprayer and add some color.  But I probably wouldn't. Just my $.02

So I added 3 more coats of epoxy last night, waiting for about 3 hours between coats to get good build up.  Already looked great this am, but not done yet!

Taking 120 grit and sanding it down until it is all even.

After I wrap this up, there will be one more light coat of epoxy, allow full 8 hour cure,  and progressively sanding from 400 to 1500 grit then polish to a shine.

Agree with this wholeheartedly. @Sender I feel like you captured the proper attitude perfectly of a person who wants to go from newb to master. This is the road. There isn't any shortcuts. So glad to see a build thread from you. We were collecting parts at the same time, so i figured you probs had a good pile and more than a few builds in mind. This board is going to be absolutely SICK. Will be my inspiration for build #4 (a few years down the road lol). Already have the trucks at least...
If I'm ever down your neck of the woods, I'll contact y'all for a group ride.

So final coat (hopefully) of resin is on .... I had a little extra epoxy so I threw some on the "Star Board"

![15267500946193694664267671104078|690x388](upload://huHdDI1IZKnk59R3zH85lkjdAx1.jpg)
I don't have my glass frit yet, to give the starboard more grip (the clear MOB I have is too opaque for this).....  but as this layer of epoxy starts to tack, I am going to take a chipping brush and add some texture.....  see how that turns out.  Even from just the first layer of epoxy I had on before, it had some descent grit to it that I attribute to the fabric itself... we will see how it turns out.

Damn, I really need to start the "Star Board" build thread soon.  As soon as the kids are asleep for a nap, I will try to get that going as I am in a "waiting to dry" holding pattern for the next 8 hours!
Hmmm, or do I fire up the spotwelder...... tough decisions.

Alright guys, I am beyond psyched how the enclosure came out.  I love @psychotiller enclosures, but now it is even stronger and looks just amazing.

This is not a cheap endeavor, and sure takes a lot of effort. I literally put close to 10 hours into this over 4 days. 

Sanding, sanding, polishing.... oops missed a spot, more epoxy, sanding, sanding, polishing.

Eventually you have to call it good, and I think I have. Not perfect, but I love it!!!

Alrighty, reaching out the all the battery guys 

I read such mixed stuff.  On this 12s5p with 30qs I am using 10mm .15 pure nickel strip from @thisguyhere

Should I double up on my parallel connections or is one actually enough in practice?

Yes, definitely double up the series joins... Especially with just 10mm nickel.
However, your middle series joints don't need to be double as long as you have 1 strip of nickel going from each cell in the parallel group to the other...

If you're doing it that way, 1 layer between parallel packs from each of the 5 cells is perfectly fine. Don't make them too tight between them in case it ever needs to flex and I would alternate the orientation of the joins between each parallel pack for that reason.
At the bottom you will need to at least double up on the nickel on the 4th & 5th cell and the 1st & 2nd cell, if you understand?

They're all connected. Your amperage isn't going to be 100a all the time. Likely most of your riding will be in the 2-40a total range. And higher is just burst. 

If you look at my pack it is staggered for the series connections, meaning the current must pass through all cells, or the nickel.

It's thicker and takes more heat, so it will take away space. I'd double up on 12 so it's easier and thinner between the cells as you look tight on space already. :slight_smile:

I ran out and now have 8x.01

So do you guys think that 5 strips is enough for these serial confections?

You've got no cell protectors on those batteries! :astonished:

You're better off off-setting those tabs to the side of the cell so they site inside the crevice...

@Sender when you solder your balance leads, cover the tabs with a small piece of fish paper, then some kapton or masking. So the corners can't rip the tape, and/or then later puncture any of the balance wire sheathing

So taking a break from battery building today (well until I am done with wheel pullies).

  I just got a package from @mmaner with some @dickyho 40t 15mm pullies, some 10mm bearings, a ton of 10mm washers,  4 90mm axles, stickers, and of course two pepperments.  The kids stole my pepperments, bastards.

I still haven't even paid him yet.

Holy crap, I know people have their complaints with running these on something like calibers, but the ability to put bearings in the pulley is unbelievable.

It makes it so easy to get true... aka it can't not be true (like that double negative @Mikenopolis?) 

And for Surfrodz trucks with extended axles it is amazing.

@b264, you are right these are awesome.  I want to order a few sets to have on hand.

So I have my Bms and balance wires hooked up.  All the voltages ascend properly taken from the JST plug (so it is in the right order).

![20180526_092117|690x388](upload://3MzcHRrBOYhZxRzPHvPPNqeACG0.jpg)

But it doesn't seem to charge...

I have a Waouks 12s charger that I changed the connector to 5.5 x 2.1mm barrel.
![20180526_092117|690x388](upload://3MzcHRrBOYhZxRzPHvPPNqeACG0.jpg)

![20180526_091917|690x388](upload://yKoCf5ZJv1veoU8VjeiUYTFzpvH.jpg)

When the charger is plugged in LED 2 is supposed to go red for "charging" but it is always gree , even when nothing is plugged in.

The output on the charger seems right though.  50.6v
![20180526_091917|690x388](upload://yKoCf5ZJv1veoU8VjeiUYTFzpvH.jpg)

Any thoughts?  The pack is sitting at 41.3V.

That right light is supposed to be red when charging and switch 2 green after full charge.  The left red light confirms it is hooked up to power.

Wow! An hour and a half later on the phone with @Deckoz and I think I am sorted...

I love this place!

Probably a BMS reset issue... reconnecting, disconnecting, and for some reason hooking up a multimeter for a bit (maybe the added resistance?!?!? ) Got the charger actually charging.  

Now it is behaving how it should. When plugged in, the left right is red, the fan is on, and it is actually charging.

Yay!

It was weird, I am not an idiot... right @Deckoz... maybe? 

Now to dismantle the charger amd adjust end of charge to 41v per cell for longevity.  

Naturally, under the tutelage underneath Darth Deckoz.

Sorry, you seem Sith to me.

@deckoz thinks it was a BMS reset issue (obviously, he is most likely correct)

On the off chance, I think I "over flux" when soldering and the flux drip in the connectors may have caused a continuity issue.

I felt possible as I worked those bullet commectors from the charge port back and forth it may have made an impact.

Maybe anecdotal.

I'd try the charger on another known good pack, and another charger in this pack. That will let you isolate it to the charger or the pack + BMS. 

If it's the charger you can have my 2 amp 12s charger for as long as you need it. If it's the BMS or the pack...well, that's not good as it'll be wait it redo.

@Sender I've never used these words on this forum before,  but I'm borderline jealous of your build. Except for the liion batteries, of course lol. 

Looks like you have plenty of room for the sk3s, no? I wonder if @psychotiller is going to design the reverse mounts  (that I've been bugging the shit out of him to make haha) to allow the motor plates on the outer side of the flange 🤔

I can imagine! It's funny, I never experienced the feeling of building a "masterpiece ", and by that I mean building a board exactly how I want it to be, or a "finished product". Way back when (last year), my goal was just to make it work. Once it did, it just kept evolving step by step. Definitely a thrilling experience, but in a different way. Super excited to see your project nearing _completion_. I wonder if mine ever will, lol.

Good vibes are infectious. It's hard not to notice postive things around you without being effected. I just want everyone to have the slickest well put together builds around, nothing like being able to say "I built that" and not only be proud of it's function, but learning along the way, and making people second guess it's a production quality board by appearance. 

Thanks dude... But @sender did exactly what I did. Changed the game. You will 100% start seeing some carbon skinned @psychotiller enclosures because Tim took it next level. I'm only standing on the shoulder of Giants before me...

So I have a water plan.

I am going to make a ruber seal around the perimeter, but also covering everything.

Then also use "d" sttle weather stripping on top of that around the edge for further protection.

I only have 4 inch strips, so had to join them for this plan.   After some quick tips from @Deckoz, here is the attachment plan:

So after I get everything right settings wise and I am not ripping off the enclosure a bunch....

I want to do a very THIN silicone bead around where my rubber seal meets the enosure.  I will have to peel it off and reapply when I need to get in there, but hopefully that will be seldom after I get all of my settings locked in.

I will also be using a BT module.  I have a few "normal" ones to run with @Ackmaniac 's app.

I am debating on geting a METR app? But I don't believe that works with Ack firmware yet.

I am using a  Galaxy S8 active... i know there have been some android issues.  I need to look this up.

Metr also allows you to do wireless tcp pass through your phone to computer without USB. So you don't even need to open your enclosure to do motor detections or configuration.

So as I am waiting on my motor pullies and belts, I have been looking at the phase/sensor wire routing and I hated it.

I preordered some of the Riptide Tunnel risers, but those are a month out and won't solve the fact that the Surf Rodz baseplate I have is oddly shaped and those risers will leave a bit of an awkward gap.

So I a made some "tunnel risers" out of a super dense hardwood that fit the tombstone shape of the Surf Rodz base plate.

One might ask, "Where did you get super hard wood?" (Well besides looking at this beautiful board).

I salvaged a small unused cutting hoard we have that is a shade over 1/2" thick. I went to a buddies shop and cut it to shape.

![20180601_143027|281x500](upload://2xH4kWDvUP05i7ASTNeznc5LPJX.jpg)

Then I mounted it to a table and drilled the holes.

![20180602_084507|690x388](upload://7CMvNbGZ4UUKCkANXTIUmed3j6M.jpg)

![20180601_172110|690x388](upload://9mqYlaEHj8IiO2gzs9DBbnCvJzy.jpg)

Then drew out a loose routing plan:

![20180601_192713|690x388](upload://yM1GN0Lm06u9760fqfi85t2wUYg.jpg)

Then some time with my dremel and its routing attachment:

![20180601_193450|690x388](upload://mzO4ZlH2enHCXFc06mVWoIPIq0e.jpg)

And you get something like:

![20180601_194925|690x388](upload://4gvV1rOFlkyAvDFhyudkEcvYJkd.jpg)

![20180602_085603|690x388](upload://7VSGPPvuXpUpnFADnV6JNEgGGgs.jpg)

![20180602_085624|690x388](upload://35MQVHkev90CQx4mcwItQwwZgOg.jpg)



I am trying to figure out how to finish them.  I have a "espresso stain plus poly"  and some appliance epoxy black paint.

I sprayed the inside of the tunnel riser with the "epoxy" paint but am planning on staining/poly the front riser and the visible sides of the rear riser.

Alright, here is where I need help.  In that last picture is the stained side (only one dose of stain).  I was hoping it would be less brown, but alas....

Do you guys think that espresso brown clashes with the deck and the rest of my set up or is it a cool accent?

Firstly I cannot believe you managed to Dremel out the tunnel. Haha I would have taken a hobby saw to the outline, then chiselled the tunnel. Lol I cannot Dremel straight and it bugs me lol.

Anyway that espesso is a nice base on the cut side for a translucent yellow clear. 

Not sure if you have any model shops around with testors paints. But they have a yellow pearl that. You can dust under a clear coat to give it shimmer like the baseplate with wood grain coming through.. just an idea..

Otherwise it looks fine to me! And I like the cutting board idea alot lol

God damn you come up with some cool ideas, that's awesome. I 2nd @trrenutter, you definitely bdont want any sharp edges where the phase wires are, I learned that the hard way with some 3d printed risers. 

I think I would maybe paint them with plasti-dip in black, it will be a little less than satin and give it a manufactured feel. I think if you stain it was or 3 times then clear coat it will darken up a lot.

It looks like I could fit a full length of myself between those motors  (I was in the pool). @psychotiller , what's the inside dimension of this mount vs your press fit again? For those of us with derp-related memory issues? And who are obsessed with knowledge of your SZ mount options..?

So this is what I am working with electronics wise

![20180603_131921|690x388](upload://vZSugpeNHZlUEfqrYPSjO7lbtap.jpg)

 sealing this is weird.  The phase wires should be long enough especially taking into consideration the length of the focbox phase wires.


![20180602_213524|690x388](upload://2NYPybKN4hPglYeXixidtYtR4Hq.jpg)

It is the sensor wire length that is a little iffy.  I am thinking about extending that out a bit, but I only have 20ga silicone and that seems a bit overkill for each sensor wire when I will only ad like 40mm or so... ugh. Decisions.

And that tail on the back end of the enclosure to hide the wire entry is a bit funny.  If it wasn't there I would just do phase wire panel mounts amd seal them, but with the little tail, I am not sure.

I am putting all my components in the enclosure, so it would be nice to have a little more length to work with so it is not too terrible a pain in the ass to get the enclosure on and off with everything hooked up.

Little details I didn't think about until now.

Also, the tail leaves me wondering the best way to seal the enclosure , while making removing everything reasonably simple and not "siliconed in" for water ingress.

Tough decisions.

Suggestions ?

Uugh, sensor wires chap my ass. Extending them is a tedious process. You can get 6 pin wires on Amazon for cheap, but soldering the teeny wires together sucks. I cut them to different lengths, to avoid them shorting, and minimize the bulk that heat shrink adds. Then i use ptf braided tubing for strength and appearance, but it adds a whole new level of ass-pain to do it this way. Then if the wires aren't the exact same length, they won't fit in the connector. Gotta do what you gotta do tho. ![15280618271761817862606|374x500](upload://xwJ5PBg5nrWBb9V3SMv36M9dDAn.jpg)![1528061865655280115653|374x500](upload://nPUHaUpK1dn1ZC3LZYiUjWthMtm.jpg)

@Deckoz @mmaner

So I siliconed in my battery, have my belts in, life is good.  Just need to extend sensor wires and seal and such.

Then I plug my charger into the port on the board, and nothing?!?! Fuck!

So finally discovered the culprit.  I was right about the flux.  All of that time I had an intermittent continuity on my negative charge port.  Thats why it was hard to ID the issue.

"Damn" I thought.  @deckoz was right I need yo reflow that bullet.  But still no continuity, and I knew I flowed that well the first time, but hey.

It was the damn little bullet.  When I soldered it a little extra flux went into the male tip... couldn't see it, but it caused intermittent connection.

I replaced it and it's all good. Sweet.  

I think it was this the whole time and when it qas working before it was just intermittent, but I didn't realize it.

@Deckoz
@mmaner 

So I am full charging the battery, and my cheap Drok  battery indicator reads 100% but the charger was still going.  I checked the voltage and it was like 49.8v.  I figure that is just in the window of error or something for the Drok (it is the small one that only has percentage, not volts)

I plugged the charger back in and it kept chugging, but the brick still didn't go green after another 30min or so. Fan still going, still charging.

I checked the voltage and it is at 50.4/50.5  Once again, range for error on my cheaper multimeter quite poasibly.

I am nervous to leave it plugged in until it goes green (if it will?).

The charger puts out 50.7 output with no load.

Brad, is this why you recommend fine tuning the pots in the charger?

This all might be normal behavior, but want to ask.



Thoughts?

I've had the same thing, I usually just leave it plugged in.  Typically its a balance issue and the reading is within the margin of error.  Off that your charger goes to 50.7 though, that's a little concerning.  Whats the amps on it?

So this is how i had it when i was on ackmaniac 2.54, on 3.1the braking curve takes the same shape as the acceleration curve and they are both more less step and slightly more linear. It takes a lot of tuning but this is a nice start.
Gotta ask yourself;
1. Hard acceleration or easing into it
2. Hard brakes or soft with increased intensity as i continue to pull

Mike, I also have two other quandaries.

How are you doing belt tension?  Do you loosen the motor everytime you pull the belt on/off, or do you find the right tension, set it and leave it?

If it isn't the latter, I don't know how to access this bolt when everything is mounted:

![15290760844095076581930906142350|690x388](upload://aGHSSfFjixuwOMtBcvwlXinxXF2.jpg)

I am assuming you set tension on the other three, pull off the wheel, tighten that inside one, then reassemble?

Any reason not to just run the 3 on the outside that are easy to get to with the wheel on?

I thread all 4 screws until tight and then back off 1/8 turn, put the wheel and belt on, tighten the wheel, slip the belt on both pulleys.  The last part takes a little fiddling...

Put the hex key in the outermost screw, pull the motor back until you have the right belt tension then back off about a 1/16 in.  Tighten that one little bastard of a screw you've been trying not to knock the hex key out off :slight_smile:.

Pull the wheel off and tighten the other 3 screws, put the wheel back on and test the fit. 

You will lose that 1/6 in you backed off when you tighten everything else up.

Honestly, not really.  I've run 50mm motors for a couple of hundred miles with only 2 screws, but that one time the motor slips and the wheel binds on the belt (equals sudden and maddening stop) will ruin that for you forever.

Let me know how that goes! :smiley: definitely isn't a one stop shop. @mmaner and i actually have similar curves. the difference being you can't really smooth out the curves on 2.54 if i remember correctly. Looking at his curve;
1. Initial acceleration is very nice, then it eases off a little bit and picks up as you continue to pull the throttle.
  
2. Initial Braking is harder as well, then as you slow down the intensity reduces and you can ease into a stop

It's a nice curve he has set up. Give them all a try :smiley:

Yeah, its vastly different between 2.54 and 3.x.  I have mine built so that the acceleration and braking are slow response at the beginning and the progressively faster as you increase the throttle.  This seems intuitive to me as most control issues happen at slow speeds, there's not much difference in balance from 20 to 25 mph but there is a ton between 2 and 7 mph.

Wheel side will actually affect how your curve is as well, when i switched to 107's with 16/36 still as my gearing ratio, i had to give myself more initial oopmh in order to contend with that gearing ratio. So i made the beginning more linear. 

the straight line from the 2.54 bldc tool is just awesome if you ask me. You can see your starting point (pink linear graph) and then edit the curve but still have the initial for reference. 

Rule of thumb for acceleration: above the line is harsher, below is mellow. (As compared to stock)

@mmaner i actually like that curve better than mine :confused: i tried downgrading from 3.1 to 2.54 last weekend but you can't jump backwards from '3' to '2' software is what i found

looking good brudda.  If you get bubbles, use a sewing needle to pierce the bubble then push the air out.  A heat gun will work too on small bubbles.  Just be careful as the heat will release the glue so they'll slide if you touch them.

But, I have another annoying tid bit.

When I plug my nano x into to charge, it flashes green.... isn't it supposed to go red?

That would be an annoying reason to have to remove the enclosure. To change remotes.  I have 6 of the bastards, but still.

I have a new water seal plan. Simple. Will post later (obviously only if I like it if not, you will never hear of this again)

My nano x flashes green too when charging. I contacted enertion support and was told this was normal. It does not stop either when fully charged.
The former one I had that broke which obviously came from a different production batch goes red when charging and shows a solid green when fully charged.

From my experience, it affects the way the curvature is formed. Exponential follows the shape of a “real-life” exponential curve, steep and then flattening out. This follows the equation e^x 
Polynomial follows x^n and Expo natural seems to be some combo of the two. 
I’m in the car right now if not I’d be able to help out with the graphs but a quick google search and you’d see what I’m talking about

So I know thats a lot of stuff, but you experienced guys check it out. 

I noticed a lack of power towards the end ( still plenty of voltage).  I could easily full throttle instead of it being super fast. Marked reduction.  I think it is due to the Temperature threshhold cutting it back?

It was on some speed runs down an open street.  Does that make sense? I just want to attribute for that marked difference in throttle feel.  Thoughts?

Yeah, the temp is kind of high.  I actually had my BMS cutout on me a few times on a ride saturday, but it was 97f outside ans I'm sure the asphalt was hotter than that and I was riding pretty hard.

I was pushing that hog for sure. And it is pretty hot out.  I am wondering, does the FOCBOX reduce output when a certain temperature threshold is reached? Aka, is this normal behavior?

Yep, so does a BMS that is wired for charge/discharge.  I thing the cutoff start is 80c and the cutoff end is 100c by default.  I'm not sure, but I think the temp you see in the Ack app is the motor temp, not the VESC temp.

So as others have said... Temps.

I know I TD ya on the phone but gonna post here for others. Becareful with summer heat, we have been having regular demagnetizing when sustaining over 30mph with the heat outside.

A few buddies and I with different boards all did a ride and log at sub 30, mostly holding around 27-29mph, and pulling between 2.9-7a per motor at speed.

We did a follow up with +30 speeds sustained and I am pulling 10-20a per motor,and my heavier friends in the 20-40a at sustained 35-38mph. we've been taking the boards out cold, to try to avoid lock ups. 

End result is basically we can rid all day sub 30, we may deal with focbox thermal throttling, but motors fine. If +30 is sustained, motors get to the point of demagnetizing and flipping poles which has caused us to have some pretty fast bails from motor lockup. Motors returning to normal once cool.

Basically what I am getting at is as little as 750W continuous for any sustained time, on 85F+ days, results in heat soak from hot pavement (140-170f measured with laser temp)  and not much space between motors and pavement means they're getting cooled with air that is almost at demagnetizing temps.

Stay out of the thirties until it's cooler outside.(night/evenings/early mornings should be fine)

Tell tail sign of motor heat is a vrrr vrrr vrrr feeling like the motor is engaged in braking or throttle when no throttle is being applied.

So I noticed some cogging on one of my motors during start from a stop.  Definitely a sensor issue, but weird because everything detected fine before.

So I ripped the enclosure off, and tried to redo hall detection and got a bad reading.

I upped erpm on Hall sensor tab to 5000 and to read at 10a.  Still nothing

Tried a different motor on the focbox and it detected fine.  

I did extend the sensor wires, so I redid all those (I was hoping I just had a bad or broken solder joint on one of the sensor wires.

Still no detection.  I even pulled the motor apart, nothing seemed broken or out of place on the sensor board.

I reassembled and still no hall detection.  Motor detection is fine of course.

Anyone have any suggestions? I can take some more pics of settings if there is anything you need to see.

Luckily I have a @JLabs motor which is essentially the same thing in black (same brand, size, and kv).   But it would be lame to have one black and one chrome motor.

Unfortunately I don't know where to hunt down a sensored sk3 190 kv in chrome...

No go.

But I did just check the voltages between the ground on the jst and halls 1,2,3.

They sat .1 or 3.29 respectively as I spin the motor slowly. BUT between grnd and H3, it says 3.29 no matter where the motor is, aka never goes to .1 like the others.....

Did I at least isolate the problem? Anyone know of a solution? 

Anybody who actually checks my Build Diary, I mean build thread.....lol....know anyone they could tag that might have a clue?

Truth be told, I was already drilling out the stripped screw, slipped, and the fucking bit went into the motor.

Sweet. It seeems ok, but definitely dont want to run it until I get it apart to inspect.

I literally had to walk away for the rest of the day.  Been the most frustrating thing.

All my fault obviously, I was trying to take the can off of a perfectly working motor like an idiot. Just to match. Dumb.  

BUT, those tiny ass phillips are a disgrace.  And I have no clue why the sensor board is bad on the other one.

Dude my finger is hovering over the 6380s....  I had one 6355 with a clicking noise, I just fixed it though.  Haven't ran it yet.   It was just a tip of the sensor board rubbing on the can, but it was annoying AF even just hand spinning it.  I have had that motor sitting around for a while.  I was a bit turned off by the defect, but after taking alart the SK3s and the TBs...... the TB are much simpler. In a good way.

TBH, they just don't look as cool as the maytechs for the price.  I am going to try painting these TB 6355s, if that looks good maybe I will grab those 6380s.  Unless @torqueboards  has a flash sale on em in the next day. Lol. Then I would would hop on.  I have more than enough room on my hanger for that big boy

Since moving much of the Tico components to my Lacroix, "City Slicker,"  I am in the process of converting Tico to a more city-all-terrain setup. I am psyched to get it done, but I can't stop riding my Lacroix to finish it!

It will rock some Surf Rodz TKPs with 90mm axles and 6 shooters from @psychotiller of course.

Luckily the enclosure, battery, and Focboxes are already done, so I should be able to wrap it all up quickly after I get a few components.

I also have some 18t motor pullies on the way to try out if I can't get the 20/60 to work out or if there isn't enough torque for my taste. I want this to be a speedier board.

For doing something like this? I know that the newer stock of @psychotiller mounts dont have quite the clearance as the original bolt on set I got. But it will still probably clear.  I have kinda moved away from Sk3s for the time being...

Unsure of what to say here.

I would use them (Dual) at 9s and then in the future 12s.
So basically, I want to use them for a street board running standard belts etc.

On surf rodz TKPs? I just didn't really know why you were asking if you should get new motors or not, my bad.

Caliber 50s.

I just wanted to ask your opinion on the motors because if you say there crap then I might want to do careful research and maybe send them back and get something else.

(motors haven't arrived yet.)

BUT scratch that.

Ahhhh. I may have overreacted. A lot of people love them, I just had some bad luck on a sensor board. I also don't love aspects of the design.  The ones from HK are unsensored anyway.  I say ride the shit out of em until you have an issue!

Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe hobbyking has actually been selling motors with a sensored option for a few weeks now...

Those are the sk8s though right?  The sensored sk3s are for special orders, or they were.  I haven't looked, but I will

If you're asking about @Sender's bludgeon... It's a @psychotiller Alter Wedge.
