Great Board man!
I really love the 3d printed enclosure, looks like a really well thought out design!
Are the motor mounts 3d printed as well or is it just a cover? Either way i like the visibility of them and the rest of the board too!

Thank you!
The motor mount is aluminum and only the cover part is plastic.

There's just so much about this that I love.  I'm in process of an Icarus build and wanted to eventually go the way of the gullwings.  Lots of fun carving?  How do you like this deck compared to a vanguard?

Super jealous of your status lighting btw.  Well done.

Gullwing trucks can be as small as the radius of your choice. It does not mean that you can not drive at high speed. It depends on the mind.

What type of LEDs are you running? And how do you control them?

Would you be so kind to share the STL files. I love the case design!
