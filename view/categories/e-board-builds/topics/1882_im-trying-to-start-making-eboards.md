I have been a big fan of skateboarding ever since i could remember. I started a long time ago and i really want an E-skateboard. The main reasoning of me wanting an E-board is that my 2 wheeled segway hoverboard broke. Anybody know any good options for an E-Board? (DIY or Pre built. Willing to pay no more than 1000USD) thanks!   Also, Shipping to Hong Kong?

I would check out the 'start here' post that @onloop created. It's pretty good for diy electric skateboards.. prebuilt boards are gonna cost at or a above $1000 tho. I think the enertion raptor is a bit more and I know the basis boosted board is $1000, but you can get a lot more for your money than the boosted board. I have heard of 'melon board' that gets good range and is $600 but the reviews are not to good after a few rides. They are cheeply made in China a rebranded, there is another board that is the same thing as the melon board, with diffrent logos. I would personally stay away from them. I would go with diy because it's awesome to learn and there is a great community here is u need any help..

go diy of of course do to recent advances in pre built electric longboard batteries theses can easily compare to but most likely beat any board on the market for speed and range. The vesc offers open source programming that allows you to make it the best for your specific motor and setup, also your riding habits and conditions. The hong kong shipping will probably kill you by a hundred or so dollars for everything but this is easily doable

do you have and top speed you want in particular or if you live in a hilly or relativly flat area

run a 245 kv tacon geared low on a 10 or 12s setup

I thought 245KV was too high to use at 12S with a VESC.
Is is safe to use this high KV at 10S with the VESC ?

Haha higher voltage lets your vehicle run cooler and yes ideally with the right gearing you should be fine

Sorry to insist but Ben had issues running motor at 12S with more than 200kv. Are you aware of this problem or is your answer a general comment on voltages and esc ?
Have you tested it yourself ?
The switching was too fast for the components to handle that high voltage.

Sorry.
The people using batteries are often speaking of voltage as S.
1S is 3.7V (to 4.2 depending on the charge). 
12S is around 44V
This comes from the fact that batteries are usually made of several elements in series.
And the elements are each 1S in voltage.

There are limitations in using this battery with that ESC (controller) and that motor.
One of the limitations already mentionned by Vedder (the VESC inventor) is that you should not use 12S batteries with motors that have a KV (another motor specification) higher than 200.

yes i have tested it so long as you gear it right for the motor ull be fine

however if you dont have money to waste then just go 10s just to be safe

@CHU1313Y i would love to build you one and i could totally do it within your budget but i can't ship completes overseas yet. 

Fortunately you're in the right place for advice on building your own.

I am very surprised.
SEveral people fried their VESC running >200KV motors with 12S and Vedder 
explicitely recommended not to use >200KV motors with 12S VESC.

What is your configuration exactly ?
You said 2 weeks ago that you were starting your first build, you must be a very quick builder !

however Its gonna depend on how fast your going to be going, what you amp draw is going to look like, your motor kv, and how much you want to spend on the whole thing. Most importantly though are you trying to build a unique board?

Hi,

Until last November I was living in Hong Kong and while it is probably going to be expensive to get stuff shipped from the US, most of the component can be found there. 

my first board was 6S and I got batteries, charger and motors from Hobby king, their main office is in Hong Kong, shipping is free or cheap and you get stuff in 1 or 2 days. 

You can get FVT 6S ESC from Taobao for around 350HKD the FVT 12S should be around 900HKD, small 2.4ghz controller can also be found on Taobao for something like 120HKD. In fact, most of the parts can be found on Taobao, blank flywheels, some Chinese made hub motors, battery cases and so on. 

you could also get the RC stuff from Mongkok and supplies for soldering from Sham Shui Po. 

The only thing I would order from abroad would be the drive Kit and motor mount although there are plenty of kits on Taobao All I have seen there are HTD3 pitch belt and pulleys and the motor mounts is made for 50mm motors. I have tried the kits from enertion and Torqueboard and they are much better quality than those I tried from China. 

I already had a board so I did not have to buy one but I looked around, there is not that much choice in Hong Kong. 

Hope it helps.

I have talked to torqueboards personally and he hs confirmed that he himself rides with high kv motors on 12s without any difficulty and also recommends this to others.

Do you have any experience with the pulley size with the tacon 245kv.. I ordered 14 to 36.. Will I get enough speed for takeoff, or is this an okay gearing ratio?? I ordered them a while ago and they are finally coming in tomorrow :)

getting a new tacon soon!!! Gearing wise ive been running 5mm pitch 10 by 32 tooth and its going great but i also ordered a new 15tooth pulley. What belt size are you going to be using?

[/quote]

@willpark16 - This is with my 12S TorqueBoards ESC and not the VESC. 10S is recommended for a 200kv or higher motor. VESC will need to be tested if you plan on doing it at 12S but as many people have mentioned already - no luck.

Htd5 9mm how is the torque with the motor?? It's the higher the number of teeth the more torque right??

lower teeth means more torque but you also want more teeth in the mesh of the belt.@JLabs

No problem, glad I helped. I was surprised Of the number of DIY e-skateboard items that were sold in China.

Sorry, I took my board with me and as many spare parts I could afford. Where I am now, it is Close to impossible to find parts and shipping from anywhere in the world is very expensive.
