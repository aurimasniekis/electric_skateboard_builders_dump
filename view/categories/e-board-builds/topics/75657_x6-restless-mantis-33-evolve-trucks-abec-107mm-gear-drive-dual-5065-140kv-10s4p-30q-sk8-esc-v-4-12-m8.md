**X6 - A board with a range of over 70km on a single charge**

It's time to post a description and photos from my last build, a board equipped with a gear drive

![20180725_175708_HDR_cr|627x500](upload://gKXODJOXWvfyWJAZgpGcil7Rhyc.jpeg) 

**Parts list:**
Restless Mantis Warrior 33&quot;
Evolve Trucks
ABEC 107
Racerstar 5065 140kv
10S4P Samsung 30Q
Turnigy SK8-ESC V4.12
Benchwheel DIY Remote &amp; Receiver
Enclosure Evolve 2 gen
Bluetooth module and metr app
Gear Drive
 
_At the beginning I want to apologise for my English, a foreign language isn't my strong point_
_Undoubtedly my description will have some mistakes ... but you must forgive me.. :)_

**DECK**

I'm obsessed with the look so I bought 3 decks before I chose the final one

1. Kebbek Smoothcut 37
2. Jet Invasion Voyager-X
3. Restless Mantis Warrior 33&quot;

![20180209_120711_cr|690x326](upload://oCoUekIyN4UZpVgGuJylKLBpM0z.jpeg) 

![20180213_202819|666x500](upload://aHlYiEsEai2iNRE4ienQLPDTgPS.jpeg) 

![20180303_150307_cr|690x485](upload://zrIBXiYsYxrqss4AgfGY688Eq54.jpeg) 

![20180524_212054_cr|690x486](upload://jZ52zxtmgLFgcMxjkXGae8TyVWe.jpeg) 

Restless Mantis Warrior 33 had (in my opinion) the perfect proportions for this compilation so I chose this deck

**ENCLOSURE**

At the beginning I wanted to make a modular enclosure so that she could bend with the deck
I designed encloure made of many pieces that can be combined with each other. Segments (individual parts of the housing) I printed on a 3D printer
My enclosure was flexible but not hermetic.
Elements made on a 3D printer are also less durable than injection molded parts

![20180625_221133_cr|690x365](upload://xBMn5sv4XtFk2YTFQqv8c6HfV8V.jpeg) 

![20180625_221201_cr|690x362](upload://ucqWJoBjhmooH9w5VvvbGmPbfV2.jpeg) 

I started looking for a casing designed for the board.
I wanted the housing to be durable, hermetic and low ...... and I found the EVOLVE 2 gen enclosure :D

![20180619_161357_cr|690x383](upload://ho0pIVAVGnnjl84QwPGJbiilvtk.jpeg) 

The disadvantage of this enclosure is a small space inside (I could not fit BMS)
The advantage is compact dimensions and high durability.

![20180625_220446~01|690x360](upload://8hLZAfYO7C4qQ6YHG4jvzF4lMx8.jpg) 

**Battery**

I chose Samsung 30Q batteries from which I built a 5-segment 10S4P package.

![20180416_141511_cr|690x256](upload://mDAItAWkaJ6s1jgkGgqu4E54TeL.jpeg) 

![20180706_164855_cr_cr|690x386](upload://jXEbBBqK10pmGaRvRx83RLMsuFb.jpeg) 

![20180706_184117~01_cr|690x237](upload://47susb7UhEN3kpwxhWBUHcfaznc.jpeg) 

The battery capacity is 432Wh (12Ah), discharging current 60A
I wanted to mount the BMS 60A 10S with a Bluetooth module, but this BMS did not fit into the Evolve enclosure

**ESC**

I had three types to choose from

1. FVT Dual 120A, 12S
2. Turnigy SK8-ESC V4.12 (VESC 4.12)
3. FOCBOX

![20180717_205202|666x500](upload://i8npGQz1H6393BRIOVlzdVHSW72.jpeg) 

The FVT Dual 120A, 12S seemed to me the best choice, it was the smallest, it had a built-in switch and passive cooling
![20180706_134357_cr_cr|690x240](upload://beBbdR2saNymvchzqDT8ygC5IpB.jpeg) 

However, VESC has much more configuration options and gentler brakes, which is why I decided to use VESC 4.12
Theoretically, along with two VESCs, I would fit BMS inside the enclosure, unfortunately it would be very difficult to implement
![20180717_215939_cr|690x446](upload://lmA3Uk46eQb0FEJHRHwTkQNwXof.jpeg) 


Foxbox seems the best choice but I have assigned this ESC to another project (about it at the end)

![20180717_221800|666x500](upload://rHtGnbmj9qK7bKP8C5ZxSIDr2Hs.jpeg) 


**Remote &amp; Receiver**

I chose the Benchwheel DIY Remote &amp; Receiver, it is ugly and not ergonomic, but it is well done, works perfectly and is reliable.

**Motors**

I chose the &quot;Racerstar 5065 BRH5065&quot; motors for two reasons:

* I designed the direct drive as an upgrade for Evolve boards
* I wanted to use a motor with a small diameter, so that the clearance between the drive casing on the road surface was large

After the first tests, the motors proved to be a great choice,
The motors are small but have a large power reserve, they are very well made.
The board has a very large acceleration, speed over 40km / h and most importantly a large range.
They are also one of the cheapest motors, so they have an excellent value for money

**Gear Drive**

The idea of building a gear drive for Longboard he suggested to me @Powadangaboards
He asked me if I could do something like that
![motor%20mount|500x500](upload://tcy1obD3NXEQfAwSIgl5XMd2wc.jpg) 

I did not want to do the same myself, so I did it my way :D

@Powadangaboards also sold me EVOLVE trucks for which I am very grateful to him

The first prototype was made in February 2018, later, I built several more versions, the final one was created in August and is being tested all the time.

![20180218_163946~01~01|598x500](upload://vjhZgNrSUjz7WSKjDFASvzqIQsK.jpg) 

![20180218_164032~01~01|652x500](upload://eFGhnvSRqcpz8051ArG3fQPVd3u.jpg)

![20180303_132635_cr|617x500](upload://zA5rXJLwonj0bUJ7UpQGLPDW6Lo.jpeg) 

![20180303_133102|666x500](upload://tEPM4QeSO0HdSITxQTHVtHpOfJo.jpeg) 

![20180905_185906_cr|690x319](upload://87r0fnpTzHxXmFRprOv3aHzwEnk.jpeg) 

Final version of the gear drive
![20180902_215619_cr|465x500](upload://qe2aJmTcfGdRV9LQEpmt7ZiT0eb.jpg) 

![20181024_100038|666x500](upload://dvw7zFdlcNomH9dhUumoE6E0v4L.jpeg) 


The drive has a 1: 2 gear ratio, and is designed for 140-150kV motors, Evolve trucks and 97-107mm diameter wheels
The greatest advantage of the drive is the low friction of the toothed gear, the drive is more efficient than the belt transmission. The drive housing is waterproof and dustproof
The disadvantages are the large diameter of the drive (small clearance) and louder work, but I like this sound :D

The drive's efficiency is confirmed by tests.
The parameters of the drive are measured by Transmitter METR (older type) + application on android

@rpasichnyk has created a great tool,

Without METR, the gear drive tests would be difficult to make, now I introduce small changes in the design of the drive and after driving a distance of a few kilometers I see the effects.

**In September, I traveled 71 km on one charge,**

**My board has a 10S4P battery pack built with Samsung 30Q, so it has only 12Ah**

Below are the data from VESC
Unfortunately, at the last 8.5 km, the METR has stopped sending telemetry data, only data GPS from the phone's

These are two measurements from the same day

1. https://metr.at/r/lO5aA
2. https://metr.at/r/Gybgh

I think that METR sends data only from one motor, because METR shows me that my battery pack 12AH 10S is 185Wh (5.08Ah) so some data (current, battery capacity) needs to be multiplied x 2

Here, other tests from round trip on a distance of 2km

https://metr.at/r/4q1IF

Energy consumption is about 0.12 Ah for 2km

Assuming the battery is 5.08 Ah, the board should cover a distance of over 80 km

Of course, the ride is very economical, driving with small acceleration at a speed of about 20km/h, but I weigh about 90kg + the weight of the board 10kg together is around 100kg, so the total weight is not small :)

**Finished board**

![20180905_182401~01|690x423](upload://xvlNyRxO9QPHUBpIcepVBF71E0k.jpg) 

**Below are two videos of tests ..**

In the first film the microphone amplifies the sound ... in reality it is quieter

https://youtu.be/dNfN5IhbzbU


In the second film, the intensity of the sound is more realistic, even a rooster can be heard in the background.:D

https://youtu.be/yucJajwPKZw


**What's next ???**

- Now I design a gear drive for pneumatic wheels for this board. I built the first prototype but I still have a lot of work ahead of me

![20180915_221745~01|456x499](upload://rCmdkugEasZH8tFPJh5B5UNvRJD.jpg) 




- I'm starting construction of the second board with a 10S6P battery pack built from Samsung 35E batteries - expected range - over 100km 
Description of the construction soon..........

Since the first time I saw you board I fell in love, congrats

I see you are using a large bearing as a seal on the wheel side of the gear drive, why that instead of a axial seal? I'm trying to decide between the two for my gear drive, @nuttyjeff is also using a bearing

I guess the drag should be lower than a rubber one

I'm sorry, I have not seen your drive before........     bearing works correctly  :)

That's true... but 107mm is better than 100mm :)
If BOA produces bigger wheels then ABEC will have competition

Thanks @Fiori
Yes, probably I will be selling this drive from January 2019

Wow wow wow, that's a sweeeet setup. The board looks great . 
So did you find the 'sweet spot' for the right size gearing for torque for each type of terrain . Do you think in the future there may be tech to create a system for  more than one gear, say maybe three gears ? Select or change gear from the remote ?  That would be awesome someone would have to be creative and think outside the box but also have the skill to bring it to reality.
What about having one motor on opposite corners on each truck at both ends to free up space for extra gears ?

The gearbox for electric motors is in my opinion senseless..
Maybe it would make sense if you wanted to change the wheels for bigger pneumatic ones, but such a drive would be complicated and heavier

I like simple constructions, so it's not for me ...

Multiple gears was just a thought, and I'm probably overthinking as where I live there are lots of hills. I like what you say, yes, "keep it simple "  👍, not worth the effort. 
What's your thoughts on placing motors at each end of the board on two wheel drive and do you think four wheel drive has any benefit for off road boards ?
 Gear drive looks to be the future in power delivery, to me it's better than belt or hub drive systems in whatever form they are in. Hub drive is still good for simplicity and price for the average novice, but if money was no object I think I would go geardrive. 
I know  I'm overthinking again, lol, but do you think the gears will break or wear out in a geardive system over time ? On a belt drive it's just the belts mainly.

I also live in a mountainous area, but the power of these small motors in combination with the gear drive is enough for me

Below are data from METR -  trip to the top of the mountain :slight_smile:

The gear drive is very durable, but I can not assess its viability. In total, I traveled about 600 km and I do not see gear teeth wear

A different reason for maybe three gears is that the one attached to the wheel could be much smaller, this would enable better gear drive clearance on smaller wheels. I am thinking of a permanent three gear setup, not the ability to change gears.

```
My battery pack has 4P and I traveled a distance 71 km but..  the range depends on many factors

- Power supply voltage (how many S)
- Battery capacity
 - Characteristics of discharging batteries
- Motors type
- ESC Regulator Type
- Configuration of the ESC regulator
- Type of wheels
- The weight of the board and the rider
- Driving style
- Landform (flat, uphill, downhill)
- Wind
etc., etc.

X6 has a 10S4P Samsung 30Q battery pack
The theoretical capacity is 12Ah / 10S

It is now building an X7 board with the 10S6P package built of Samsung 35e batteries.
The theoretical capacity is 21Ah/10S 

![image|690x354](upload://tJEpbLKCbdvyepQtW5ldCUT9lEW.jpeg) 

Theoretically, I should have a range of 124km but the batteries have other characteristic,  so the range can be much shorter ...

I hope that the range will be no less than 100 km :grinning:

[/quote]

432 wh is the theoretical capacity, 
In fact, the capacity is 370Wh (measured with METR), so the average consumption of energy is 5.2Wh/km

How's the progress going with the gear drives? Also, isn't the main point of gear drives that you can transfer much more torque? Would love to see a version for 63mm motors :slight_smile:

The first sets will be delivered to customers in July ... but it will be a standard version for EVOVLE trucks and 5065 motors

I designed a larger gear drive for 63xx motors.

However, this will be a gear drive for Surf RodzTKP trucks,  but also wants to make a version for Surf Rodz RKP

In the picture, the comparison of gear drives.  

6368 motor vs 5065 motor

![IMG_20190704_170212_cr|590x500](upload://ixg0EOLleKjWwrxJJIsUgVg8CfB.jpeg)

This is the first prototype, only for size verification and not for testing

On June 10 and 11  I tested the range of the X7 board

The actual capacity of the battery pack is 640Wh

I tested the range for two days, in total I  traveled distance **138km** on one charging  :grin:

The range would have been larger but the wind was blowing in the first day 

Standard power consumption at **20km / h is 4.2Wh** per 1km so theoretical coverage is **152km** :) 

Range would be even bigger if it was tested by a lighter rider, I weigh 90kg, 


Below are METR data from another test day

88 kg naked  :upside_down_face:, but I ride in clothes , so about 90 kg, In addition, the board weighs about 11kg

Total more than 100kg (101-102kg)


Below: 
Gear drive vs belt drive. On the right side, standard EVOLVE belt drive,  15/38 gear ratio

There was a slight slope, which is why X7 drove away, but you can see differences. Of course, under the load of the rider the difference is not so  large

That's cool, but we already have gear drives for SurfRodz by @marcmt88 and @moon. It's Evolve Supercarve trucks we need more 63mm motor mounting options for. (Supercarve trucks are special because they give you a longer wheelbase, which is really useful for boards not meant for huge esk8 wheels)

@rusins
You've used 5065 motors?
The 5065 motors have high power and torque.
Evovle uses similar motors  but Evolve limits their power, 

In June I rode several times a EVOVLE GTX, this  board in GT mode does not have such acceleration and power as X6 or X7. 

I regret that I did not do comparative tests :(

![IMG_20190704_184953|666x500](upload://1yJ6toEv1MljaLSSrqI9xyQYafl.jpeg) 

Of course, the 63xx motors have more power but 5065 have enough power and acceleration when using urethane wheels.

I am planning to build a gear  drive for 63xx motors, but at the beginning for the Surfrodz TKP trucks
If this gear drive will work properly, I will also create a version for EVOLVE Truck

However, I would like the drive to be small and this is difficult to design because most motors 63xx have a high  speed (KV),

No, I must confess that I have not tried 5065 ever :frowning: But I do know that my dual 6355 can get pretty hot when riding, and bigger motors have better efficiency.

Also, there are some 63xx motors that with pretty low kv, such as these 150kv Maytech motors that Bioboards sell: https://www.bioboards.se/en/produkt/6374-motor-3600w-150/

I don't think 63xx motors' KV differs much from that of 50xx motors...

You're right, but two Racerstar 5065 140kV motors cost around less than 80 Euro, that's much less than one Maytech motor :slight_smile:

I am aware that the price of the motor is not everything. You also need to buy a second ESC or dual ESC and dual gear drive....

But I think that two 5065 motors will be more efficient than one 63xx motors

Wow I didn't realize they were that cheap!

Also for some weird reason (that I don't get the theory behind) apparently using 2 motors instead of 1 cuts range in half :confused:  (There was lengthy discussion about the fact in one of the esk8 calculator threads)
