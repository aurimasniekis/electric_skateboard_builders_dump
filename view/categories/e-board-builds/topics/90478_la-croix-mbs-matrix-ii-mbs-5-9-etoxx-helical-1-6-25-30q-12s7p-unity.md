Nice, thanks for the feedback ;)

5* share the same bolt pattern as the Rockstar’s so direct fit the the drive
[/quote]

Yes, Rockstar, R2, R Pro and Fivestar have the same pattern but not the same deepness? 

Jens make the test with my Matrix 2 new hanger length last summer because I ask him if I could set 9" wit 5*, and it was not possible, maybe the extenders are longer now ...   
Its why I was curious, because it's the setup I want :blush:  ;P 

If I make this layout like I already did, the extender didn't go out of the 5* rim, as they are wider  than the Rockstar2 ...

(As my board didn't roll anymore, I will unset and measure them. But the 5* wide is around 39/40mm, Rockstar is less, around 37.5mm if I remember. And Trampa are 35mm deep, they will need washer...)
I will make it just like you ^^ (with T2, after finishing my Primo Stricker I guess)

Witch motors will you choose?

To be honest I don’t know if the rear extenders with the drives should be as far out as they are, maybe because it’s not fully threaded to the axle.
[/quote]

IMO its not save to use the Truckextension with the wide Fivestar Hubs on Matrix2 Trucks.
I told @Riako last year about and i still think the same!

That looks pretty solid with the double bolts on each side of the binding. Are those inserts in the correct position to double as the mounts for the regular bindings when you want to switch? I like the idea of being able to switch bindings in the same holes. And make sure you don't short yourself on stance width. I have those freeboard bindings on a drop through deck and they are pushed out as far as possible, but still feel like my stance is too narrow.

Also, are you gonna be doing rail slides on your enclosure? :rofl:

We use M3 Self tapping but if you are going to use a lot of pull out force (for the bindings) I'd recommend using M4 and higher.

And, yes, megastar 9" fit the kit with some shim/washer with the [Trampa Direct Drive Hub Adapters](https://www.e-toxx-shop.com/trampa/direct-drive/hub-adapters/#cc-m-product-9945304870)
But I prefer your solution, cheaper, like that I could keep my lighter 5*!

Yeah I'm gonna steal that too for sure. Been thinking through the best way to mount that elsewhere and want a top mount charge port for this new extended range backpack battery I'm cooking up.

Keep up the good work!

That is awesome. Way to make it work. Funny how just a little bit of material can make all the difference. I was also going to try to get my hands on a set of five stars so I can run 9" tires until I saw this, but now that I know it's possible, I'm wondering if I can just shave my nuts at home using hand tools or a drill or something.
