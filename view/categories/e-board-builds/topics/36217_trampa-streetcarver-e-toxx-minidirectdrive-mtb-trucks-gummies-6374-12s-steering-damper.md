Do the mini DD units fit 80mm motors fine? Not sure what is required if anything to adapt.

Thanks Man
No its not possible to use the Mini Drive with 80mm Motors...
You only got 50mm CTC ... 40mm gone for the 80mm Motor...10mm not enough for the Truck
You have to take the regular Direct Drive with Adapters... like here shown for Alien APS :

Using a regular Mini Direct Drive, just on a MTB Hanger, it has only to be flipped ,
The remaining gap is something bigger but will be sealed with Sugru as usual... easy

Updates are looking MEAN. I'm really interested on what the ride quality will be like on the gummies compared to say the superfly 107mm. Those wheels are huge but a good chunk of it isn't urethane. 

Also what the reasoning for DD on a street build? Wouldn't you prefer belt for less noise?

Also what enclosure are you using? I'm assuming it is going underneath possibly? What battery setup are you planning to run?

yes the noise factor would be better for sure with a belt ... 
But:
-Loving the ultra compact look
-Autumn is known for alot debris on the streets
-Full braking performance possible, far behind any Beltsystem
-will use it also with pneumatics in light/dirt/offroad

Battery Setup will be Sony VTC6 in 12S Config,How many P depends on enclosure.

Option Nr1 is Trampa Enclosure, limited to 12S4P, already got one prepered with CNC cutted Slots and Holes... it was such a mess last time by hand...

Option Nr2 will apear hopefully tomorrow... 
Thinking about for longer and just give it a try this time... Maybe (-;
I  hope its not too bulky, 50mm height, Trampa one is really slim with nearly 30mm height... 

Today the engines arrived, quick mockup for clearence check...

Let me know how your enclosure works out. CNC is dope.  Yes, I did the hand cutting + mini circular saw way before. It is a lot of hard work and time consuming than Frank's @trampa  original thread on the matter suggests. You have to saw and saw and saw till your arm falls out.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/official-trampa-diy-build-thread-street-and-urban-carve/22294

One issue is that the space is so tight. I had to remove the neoprene from the aluminum L-profile and now will use just the silicone rubber sheet on them because every bit of space counts.  I am still trying to shove the antispark with on/off button in there.... I barely have room... very concerned if I can make this fit.  I think instead of following Frank's design to the letter I should have connected the battery packs with 12AWG wire at the tops rather than diagonal because that is just lost space. If I had just like 2-3 more cm everything would fit so comfortably.  Or if I chop two cells off and make it a 10s4p... but that just feels like a sad, sad, way to go... after planning for 12s.  

Any ideas? Smaller AWG wire on the ends of the battery to the vesc's + antispark and xt 60's instead of xt 90's? maybe bullet connectors will save more space? I am having trouble folding the wires to all fit in. No BMS because using a 12s charger from Amazon.

Tell me about it.
I had to 3d print these end caps, in order to fit everything inside, which is working perfectly fine btw. ... But I would love some more height on the trampa enclosure though. 
But aren't @trampa working on a new one ?

So your batteries or Vesc's extend into that 3d printed end cap I suppose?

Yes, height is a concern... I think I may have to re-do my pack padding:

I created a sandwich with total height: 27.75mm + tape height

1)  1.5mm tufnol (bottom)
2)  3mm neoprene (battery cushioning bottom)
3)  19mm (18650 18mm + .5mm battery enclosure) 
4)  3mm neoprene (battery cushioning top)
5) 1.5mm tufnol (top)
6) 0.75mm silicone rubber sheet

I thought I could just squeeze the neoprene down to fit from 6mm total to like 2mm but it is more resilient than I expected. I think I will remove the neoprene part of the sandwich entirely.

HI, I spotted some things:

The balancer leads should be layed in a curve, each time they cross a cell block. This will allow the flex.
You have taped them down in a straight line, which will put strain on the balance leads once you step on the board and flex it. Have A look how I did it.

I would tape the cell block interconnecting AWG wire to the cell blocks itself >> just next to the solder joint.
This will grantee that there is no movement in the nickel strip. The only movement is in the centre of the cable once you taped the cable ends to the cell blocks.

If you use the aluminium L-Profiles, make sure to use rubber cable feed throughs 

Frank

I don't know how I missed this build, amazing as always Jens.

I'm going to make the same build but with HS11 deck, ultimate hangers with carver baseplates and 107mm Flys, I already had the Carver deck before so I wanted something different this time, the carver deck sits very high from the ground on pneumatics, I dont like that much either.

I'm just worried about the clearance as I haven't seen anyone with a HS11 or MTB Holy Pro deck, ultimate hangers and street wheels, maybe because there were no options before but the 97mm flys
```

---
## \#31 Posted by: Sender Posted at: 2017-10-30T16:18:08.208Z Reads: 472

Just out of curiosity, why did you decide on the HS11 over the other Trampa offerings?
```

---
## \#32 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2017-10-30T17:00:43.932Z Reads: 491

```
Because:
1. I already had the Carver deck, I wanted something different
2. The HS11 shape is way nicer than the carver
3. The carver sits too high from the ground on 8" pneumatics, I like HS11 stance more
4. I will be able to convert it to full MTB
5. According to some, 107mm Flywheels give enough room to avoid the deck to touch the ground
6. The HS11 has more room underneath to run silicone wires between individual packs, planning to run 12S5P
7. The HS11 is cheaper than the Holy Pro 35
8. The HS11 has this slimmed belt shape that makes it better looking than the street carve deck wihich is more plain

Carve deck:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/3/03e623c0b96e54e2737ef60da79ec52b6fd0d4ba.png" width="667" height="287">

HS11 deck

However nothing in this life is perfect so here are the negatives:

1. The HS11 I chose weights 2900g (16ply) vs 2500g (15ply)
2. Deck clearance might be an issue on full leans (I'm hopping not to be an issue, I'll have to test it myself when I get the 107mm Flys)
3. I'll have to swap axles on the ultimate trucks as the originals are too long for street wheels

You can use spacers to fit the street wheels. Replacing the axles can be painful. They are pressed in and won't come out easily.

Decidet that i wanna use this build also to test my new steering Damper, :kissing_smiling_eyes:
unfortunaly i realized that even on the wide MTB Hanger there is not enough clearence with the 6384 Aliens

Swapped to 6374 :laughing:
also modified the Mini Drive to work without the Motorspacer to gain more 6mm´s

So the lack of space with the 6384s were because of the steering damper device?

Are you going to run 10S4P on Samsung 25r?

I'm building a similar build but with an HS11 deck, I wonder how will it run on 107 flywheels?

Hey remember when I originally gave u the idea for this steering damper and I asked u to help me make the bracket for it. U told me it wasn't worth your time. Now since u did it urself can u maybe sell me some of the attachment brackets u made for that thing since I still was never able to use mine. Thanks buddy.

Yes the lack of space is a result of the steering damper.
Using Sony VTC6 as 12S4P
Never tried HS11 Deck, cant tell you about.

Forget this (-;

Its a hydraulic damper which can be adjusted easily in many steps of how hard it damps.

Check YT for "speed wobble motorcycle" , the damper could prevent this.
I hope for alot steering for cruising, and one click adjustement

Vesc and Rcx is good to seal in the seperate Box for splash proof i think.

This kind of energy chain is meant for protected against chips etc but not for moisture... 
Will close the front better and then its okay for mine, i´m not the "riding in the rain" guy

Water will always find a way, no sealing at all... only debris proof :

Word bro -- I wish I went the other way. The tufnol is crap, the wood backbone is crap.... Jenso always invents shit out of thin air like this...just when you think it's getting boring ;)

Let me know if you do the energy chain... I might go that route or use @Kug3lis pre-printted PCB's if dude comes thru with them... as I already drilled by board and put in inserts so maybe just redo my battery with PCB's.

As you know trampa boards very well. Can you easily change vertigo trucks to hang 8inch AT wheels to gummies wheels?

As I'm going to make a mtnboard with dual 190kvs on 35holypro 16ply on ultimate trucks with 8 inch wheels. And bindings, then when gummies are in stock can they be stuck on the vertigo trucks?

Looks great Jens, any reason to not mount the steering damper on the front? wobbles tend to start at the front of forward moving objects and also an advantage of no clearance issue

I have one lonely 6384 APS motor it's a thing of beauty power wise

These a whole bunch of physics involved and I don't have esk8 experience in this at all only motorcycle where the front is not a fixed plane. With a board there are two unfixed planes given the bushings on both ends.

In saying that having the damper in the front may be beneficial to keeping the board headed in the direction needed, I'll have to get this on the try list for 2018.

Done some rebuild with the new Motormounts...

No more room for the steering Damper but in generell i dont get that good feeling for it on the Street build...maybe will try it on the Fronttruck soon

![K800_P1030460|666x500](upload://t6H1hGyj8fhOXZqa9xGzyQapM7s.JPG)

Had to reglue the Energychain the third time now )-; now i got some real industrial stuff which seems to hold up great... the Idea of the Energie Chain is nice but its no cool solution if you have to remove it again (-; 

![K800_P1030461|666x500](upload://tszOnAQqsrKlcQn2WwNaDyiWZl3.JPG)



This convertible Hybrid concept realized with Trampa Gummies and Evolve 7Inch Pneus is a great solution for people who like to have one Board for all... 

![K800_P1030465|666x500](upload://vfl2X585eT87hdEfyr1NZMjs6NS.JPG)

I think i´m more the guy who prefer specialists (-; but it rides really nice with both wheel types

The 7 Inch gives your nearly 40mm groundclearence : 
![K800_P1030482|666x500](upload://vfBWPsuUoKEGx1B6yPxMsP4Wno9.JPG)
 
The Freebord binding are no bad solution, running actually without griptape and they give good support... but i will do some padding with neopren like on the Leiftech... its not comfortable without for me

Really love this tiny drivetrain... motors inside the 7Inchers

![K800_P1030487|666x500](upload://eGmFgmWYUpYIK5Bfc7WjoaHD6aP.JPG)

Thanks Pedro,
good idea if you need more battery, not sure how much more you could add ?

Switching of Wheels goes faster with a second set of Hubs of course... 
thats the way i did... 
front wheels only needet to change via the axle nut, done in 2 minutes
Rear wheels needet to deflate, axle nut, 5x M5 screws which hold the Hub on the Drive, done in maybe 5min
Really i would say max 10minutes with spare Hubs and a Powertool

If you have to change complete wheels on Hubs it will take longer.. i would say 30minutes ?!?

Thanks, 30 min is doable for a weekend of off road

I did some sketches yesterday and if I manage to cram all electronics is less than 100mm length wise, which is doable, I can fit 10S10P with a 3D printed enclosure that goes from side to side, this without double stacking, you could go to 19S10P and the enclosure would be approximately 35mm thick, one day maybe, 9kg of battery’s  and 100+ Km on pneumatics

i am pretty new in the amazing world of e-sk8 builder.
At first i was hot to get a HS11 16ply, 12S4P underboard,vertigo truck, mini drive (e-toxx), helical gear (e-toxx),10T/40T for pulleys, Vesc6, Motor 6374 150kv and 8'wheel
But Trampa has no stock for HS11 16ply untill, vesc6 untill ???
I am stuck now (1m85, 90kg)... 
My question is Trampa StreeetCarver could it be a good choice instead of the HS11 or the Holypro will be a better even if i will have to fill the holes.
Thanks in advance guys
I am still impressed by this stylish build

The HS 11 Deck is currently not in production. We make the 35° Holy Pro instead. New shape, 8 holes in stance area, symmetric, no holes in the tip. 
Like this, but no holes in tip and no CNCed cable channel:

The new decks are cut today and arrive next week. We will need another few days for edge trimming.
VESC 6 is in production and will arrive end of July, start of August.
The current stock we have is for our e-boards. If you order a Mountainboard, you can kindly ask Ted for two VESC 6. ted at trampaboards.com.

I would recommend to go for the Monsterbox and the CNCed E-Holy Pro. Riding off road you will have impacts sooner than later. The box swallows up to 1Kwh of juice. No cables, tidy, safe.

The Monster Box has a twin VESC 6 option at reduced price (395GBP excluding VAT)

I am very confused about if you have holypro 35 15ply in stock or not..Cause if I choose one of your "premade" mountainboards, it says that it is in stock, but if I choose the custom mountainboard it says that it is out of stock.. Do you have the Holypro 35 15ply in stock or not? :confused:

@trampa
So no more Hs11 ish board without holes :-( ??? What about people like me, who love a stealthy look, with enclosure under the board ??
I already have the Urban Carver deck without holes.... but i love that Hs11 has more space for al my electric components. So i was looking forward to order Hs11 deck

Is it only me that dont get the "smart" thing in the hall sensor pcb ? You still have the motor wires, that needs to connect the same place as the hall sensor cable...??? 
And is it only ment for enclosures on top of the deck ?

Btw. Are there comming a new enclosure ?

At this stage the HolyPro shape decks will all have 8 holes. You can fill the holes if you like to put a battery under the board. The Griptape will cover that anyway. You could also buy a 35° long and cut your very own, preferred outline. People have been doing that for ages. 
The electric HolyPro deck with cable tunnel and Hall Sensor PCB is for enclosures on top of the board.

We allocate raw material to products we actually sell on our website to assure that our customers can purchase complete boards from us at any time. We can't make only a few of something, that is the nature of the production process. Making the HP without and with holes means a pile of additional stock our end.
We would need to make them in all ply ratings to please everyone's wishes. 
If you browse our website, you can see that we have a lot of different decks to offer, most of them in 4 different ply ratings. Guess how big the pile of raw decks is already? We are talking about metric tons!

Trampa has more different parts to offer than anyone else and that actually means that we need to stock all that choice of goods in bigger quantities. Offering a new tire means needing space and money for a couple thousand tires. Guess how many $$$$$$$ dollar of stock sits on the shelf waiting for sale? In addition to that, stock consumes space and space costs money again. 
You should be glad that we have all that choice to offer. If you need to slightly modify our products to build you dream board, than it's still better than not having it available at all. 
Everyone has different wishes and we try to offer parts to satisfy most of the wishes. 
At this stage we decided to allocate our available raw material to other products, so that they stay available on our website.

I think the most of us understand that step. It's the normal way of reducing capital tie.
The decision trampa has to make is, which product makes the most profit. I guess trampa as a company grows and mature to a level where efficiency gets more in more in the focus. Maybe you have have investors that want to see a bigger margin or whatever it is. 

I think this community, with all the enthusiasts that made a lot of products open-source tried to figure how to made there passion affordable see this step as a drawback.

More money through efficiency and other steps are a normal step in a maturing industry. The root of this is the financial system in my opinion. But we can't change that. So trampa is now a bit more a part of the money focused machine, we all living in. 

Of course trampa needs money to produce quality parts, but don't forget where you come from. 
Don't forget the people that made trampa big. 

I think there is a way to bring something to the market, that can fix the issue with the holes. And I think trampa can find and sell it (for an affordable price)

We are not the kind of company that chases the easy earned bucks! When you browse our website, you will see that there is tons of effort behind Trampa. Sometimes we have to compromise and we can't always please everyone's wishes. It's not super tragic to fill the holes in a DIY built. @LunarKim  would probably drop some LEDs in there in fill them holes up with transparent resin (-; 
I would take some automotive filler compound...

I'd just buy the cheaper deck (35 short or long) and cut both ends into shape (only did the tail due to gear drive myself) . Would actually be nice if we could print templates of the Hs11 for shaping the deck.

Just heads up guys, if the flexible 'cable thingy' you put your batteries into is made of PP or PE plastic there aren't much you can use to glue them and glues that do, well I have even no idea where to purchase them but 3M does make special snake-oil glues for those.  
A good check is that if you soak the piece into acetone or put acetone soaked towel standing onto it for like  a hour (although 1min could be enough) and you don't see any sticktivity nor melting of plastic you can be sure it's PE/PP. They're chemically very inert. Tho still the usual velco tapes and some double sided tapes stick to them GOOD and wont peel off with age, but chemicals like superglue, resins, silicones and silanes won't get this strong binding they usually get. Hot glue at it's gun-temperature will stick good onto PP/PE as well as it 'melts' onto the surface but it can be hit or miss  
Making very rough surface could help to have a  'mechanical' bond tho you'd have to have lots of stuff sticking up
```
