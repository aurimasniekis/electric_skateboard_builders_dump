those are nice wheels!
How hard it was to replace the shaft on the trucks and how the shafts now fixed? set screw and loctite?

no way .. you need press or high temperature   to remove them  , this area is the problem![52d91f99-2d84-4fe4-b7c1-8ce770634d1d|280x400](upload://xaqrjtSVdYgzUCDhpu1T2nxqyqU.jpeg)

With your 10" wheels do you have to have wider hubs? I'm thinking about 10" tyres for my quad...![Screenshot_20190418-141132_Alibabacom|243x500](upload://wrjgkh1kFkBXOTiyZjcG3Q20Tc0.jpeg) ![Screenshot_20190418-141132_Alibabacom|243x500](upload://wrjgkh1kFkBXOTiyZjcG3Q20Tc0.jpeg)![Screenshot_20190418-141009_Alibabacom|243x500](upload://dfAMPMgN6hhJaHpRQBADkzpQuF2.jpeg)

Uh-oh, I've got ultimates. Should I be worried?
Could you post some pictures of how you removed the old axles and replaced them?

no , I really love this trucks!  and sorry, but it is too late to take pictures ..  

that's what I wrote to one of the users here on PM
1. remove the set screw holding the axle
2. disassemble the lower part of the truck and remove all plastics .
3. apply WD-40 inside the setscrew holes
4. hold the axle with clamps
5. heat the trucks really good on the tip (place with the pattern
6. when the aluminum extend try to hold the trucks with heat resistant gloves and rotate+ pull out .
