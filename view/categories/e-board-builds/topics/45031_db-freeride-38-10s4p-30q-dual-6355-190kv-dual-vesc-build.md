- Enclosure 520mm from eskating
- Diyeboard ESC with remote and 3-speed modes
- Diyeboard Dual Belt Drive 1400W*2 N5055 Motor Power Truck kit

Amazing built. Please share the feeling of the diyeboard ESC. Do you know which is the cut of current for it? I mean with 4p 30Q cells you have 80A discharge current (60 nominal but these cell are capable of more). Do you know if the esc is set for 50A? Once you tried could you tell us how smooth is it? Thx a lot man!

Hey! 
I have two kits from diyeboard and i like the esc that they provide, super nice with 3 speed modes.
The esc is capable of 50A continnous and 120A burst.

Looking good! The red trucks look sweet! I’m about to start a build for a friend with the same deck. Do you have enough clearance between the motors and the phase wires? It’s hard to tell from the pictures. 

Can you tell me where you sourced the pulley and belt cover?

Yeah there's enough clearance with 1/4 inch riser with the diyeboard trucks (50 degrees). 

With the calibers i must use 1/2 inch risers cuz they are 40 degrees. 

This will not longer be used on my build

Thanks. I’m curious why you made the change to vesc speed controllers over diyeboard’s esc and the 6355 motors over the diyeboard dual motors. Are just looking for more power or did the diyeboard perform poorly/have issues?
```

## \#25 Posted by: Bjork3n Posted at: 2018-02-20T06:29:54.726Z Reads: 258

Well I always wanted a board that has performance that is top of the line so i changed my mind and decided that this is going to be that board. 

I still have a board with diyeboard components that I use often, it's a great board!
The speed controller on the diyeboard is great imo. 

I highly recommend the diyeboard kits, they are great and very reliable.

Holy shit.... it has power. 
A bit unsure of the deck choice.. its hard when you get wheelies on acceleration haha.

Max battery amps was 78A!

Nearly every topmount kicktail deck will wheelie (or manual in skateboard jargon) with that drivetrain. I have a dual raptor 1, which is a similar set up. I just keep my weight on my front foot on hard acceleration and my back foot on hard braking. A bigger wheel pulleys will reduce the wheelies if it really bothers you.

Everyone said the torqueboard vesc was a high risk, well they was right.
I got the drv error even tough i done nothing wrong! I follow their instructions to the letter, when i was about to do motor detection nothing happend.... typed faults i terminal, there it was... the drv issue.

No mark on the drv chip and i only did the setup in BLDC. 
Well see what Torqueboards () says, but at the moment i have a hard time recommending their vesc. 
The maytech i used for over a year is still going strong and i had no issues setting it up with the same settings.

Little update!
So i have recived the deck and new vescs from eskating.
Only thing im waiting for now is the new maytech 2 remote.

I decided to ditch the canbus, i will use split ppm to be on the safe side!  (Think canbus burnt the drv..)
![58|666x500](upload://6aG4GHsTR3l2Pz7wavmw7iPHtKO.jpg)

The new deck!
![18|374x500](upload://qS8xaRQKBPyM2SxXpRwfM3HrEx2.jpg)
Added 10 nut inserts to hold the enclosure.
![53|666x500](upload://f9r8wh1bn2zpuNMk49VTtyzDlB7.jpg)
Installed enclosure! 
![39|374x500](upload://1xEyW3LhcsQ26QiTAlQRez62hQW.jpg)
Installed the griptape , starting to look finished! 
![46|666x500](upload://pS7F4QBRmIBebGkGu3VzxFJm7r.jpg)

Decided to ditch the sensors since it seems like i have a bad motor temp cable, got a fault code in the vesc tool (Over temp motor) so i couldn't run detection with sensors attached on one vesc.
Will be sensorless for now and if i feel the start up is a big issue i will probably find a solution to fix the broken cable.

I will start with these settings and increase them after a while if i feel a need for more power.
Each vesc.
Motor max : 60A
Motor min:  -50A
Battery max: 30A
Battery min -8A
Startup boost: 0.05
Max current ramp step = 0.04
Min Erpm: -100,000
Max Erpm : 100,000  (will never reach this with 190kv so i left it stock)

So the 190kv will never reach its ermp? Can you explain, I'm still confused the the ermp part. I set my ermp to 60,000 since I keep seeing people on here doing that. I'm running a single 6374 190kv form diyelectricskateboard

Testrun today!
At the end i got drv error when accelerating. 
It just vanished by it self, didnt even had to reboot?  (you can also see that i test throttle directly after the cutoff)
Rode home just fine with no error, something must have went bananas. 
Vesc tool shows no error and i went out for another 4km ride with no issues.

Anyone else experienced this?

Hey Guys!
So i sent my Vesc for repair and recived them today! 
Installed everything and made sure to setup the settings.

I flashed Ackmaniac firmware 3.1 to both vesc and connected them via split ppm.
Works great! I do however want to try canbus again in the future to get the values for both vesc and be able to switch modes on the fly.

The settings i went for this time was. (each vesc)
Motormax: 60A
Motormin -50A
Batterymax 30A
Battery min -8A

Startup boost 0.05
Current ramp up 0.04

These settings works without any problems and to be honest the board is a freaking animal with these settings...
Most of my testing have been done on open roads but today i tried narrow bike lanes... holy shit it changes the experience.
Going to keep this settings for a while to get used to the power.
I have a pair of focboxes also so maybe i try FOC....decisions..

New pictures of the complete build.
Very happy with the result!

Little update!
Board as been fine since i got the focboxes installed! 
Maytech still worked fine as long as i stayed at 30A on battery max.

Im now running 60 motormax and 35A batterymax on each vesc, its perfect IMO.
I got some 90mm genuine abec flywheels and was super surprised of the difference it made.
Its like riding on clouds , seriously is such an amazing difference and probably one of the best mods i done so far.

The wheels also raised the top speed to 47-48km/H depending on the charge.

I also installed some 3d-printed pulleys on the toquemounts so now stones will hopefully have a hard time getting in between the pulley in belt, this happens alot without the covers.

Update! Been running the board for around 1200km and its still running strong as ever!
Been using it for my commute and i mostly use the slow mode (max is 38A battery on slowmode) and the range is usually around 45km when commuting to work.

I will most likely sell it in the future to start another electric project, but this time with 2 wheels instead of 4 ;) 
I haven't decided if i should part it out or sell it as a complete yet. 
If anyone would be interested in this beast and is located near Sweden send me a pm ;)

@Bjork3n, what width are the belts you're running? I'm building a similar drop down setup and love the look of the motors tucked under the deck. If those mounts allow for 15mm belts on Caliber II's, I think those might be the way to go for me. Also what size riser pads are you using? Between those and the wheels it looks like you have plenty of ground clearance.

I'm running a similar setup, albeit with 85mm wheels, so I wish I had bought longer motor mounts and mounted the motors behind the truck. With standard caliber trucks you're stuck to using 12mm wide belts (with 55mm motors), which is fine unless you set your motor settings to the max, and start playing around with the board literally lifting its front up when accelerating – that broke my first 2 belts. Bought a bit longer belts to replace them, and set the motor limits down to sane values: I think 12mm per wheel is fine. If you really want dual 15mm belts, you'll need to go for different trucks. Luckily, there's this: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-caliber-trucks-for-esk8-community/60822/207

Honestly 12mm is fine! I have clocked over 1000km on this board and it still uses the same belts as it had from day 1. 
Most belts breaks due to incorrect tension, rocks or bad alignment imo. 

I used  1/2 risers if i remember correctly.

I think I'm slowly adopting the idea of 12's. This is for my first build and I've seen most people running 12's with the Caliber/dual 6355 setup but occasionally find someone that squeezed 15's on. I'm more worried about skipping than breakage and like the idea of running a little looser belt with an idler or two so you can still push. I'm about 200lbs(90kg) and figured 15's would be the way to go. I've also see that @longhairedboy has the longer Caliber E's which I'm pretty sure would allow for what I want. 

Thanks for all the info! Looks like I still need to think some things over, I'll probably go 12's and keep the tighter Caliber II's.
