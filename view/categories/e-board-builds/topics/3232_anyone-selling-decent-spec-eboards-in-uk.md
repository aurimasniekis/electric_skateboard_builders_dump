Hi as well as thinking about building my own board I am also thinking of buying one due to stock shortage on various parts. So was wondering if anyone has a decent one for sale? I want at least 20mph and 10 mile range more if possible as well as decent hill climb ability. 

Thanks

Build one I'm in uk and have prity much finished building mine and it's not hard. All depends on what electronics you want. Vesc are harder to setup but car esc are dead easy.
