i mean, price difference isn't much if you know where to get the batteries from.

2.50 for 25r and 3.50 for 30q, but 500mah capacity increase which is a nice 20% increase from 25r to 30q

still, a nice build. enjoy it.

curious as to what the range would be however, update us on it if you don't mind.

@Eboosted: I really dont know yet.  I went from 2x6355 belt to 2x6374 and haven't put too many miles on it yet.  So as far as performance, hard for me to tell at this point.  Noise doesn't bother me though. 
I know that you have one as well.   Have you installed it yet?  I really think I'm going to like this drive in the long-haul and would purchase again.  

@goldrabe: I asked Kaly the same question about the sound and his response is that it is comparable to a Boosted Board.   I don't notice much noise coming from them.  The trick is ensuring they are properly lubed  
I recorded a clip just after I read your message this morning (dont judge my sandals).  It was with an iPhoneX somewhat close to the motors.   This is in FOC mode.
In regards to the maintenance: it is suppose to be very low maintenance since it is sealed off from the elements.  Only requiring lubrication.   

Some other notes about the direct drive:
* The hangar he is sending them premounted on is heavy duty.  It is also thicker than the "Ultimate" truck i had on there.  It was pretty difficult to sandwich it between the baseplate.  I had to open up the baseplate slightly by a couple of mm to get it on.

* The O-ring around the POM gear spins with the pom meaning that there is friction between it in the back black plate.  Iubed up the back part of that ring and everything is silky smooth.   (see image below)

* I had to trim off my motor shaft + key down to about 26-27mm.  The torqueboard motor i had was 42mm.  This took about 5min with a dremel.  Cover your motor with a bag so the magnets on the motor dont attact all of the metal.

* When installing the drive I wasn't sure how far or close to put the gears.  Kaly said "You need to use a double piece of paper and push the motor gear against the wheel gear. Do not use a lot of force, just put them together firm."

@cody00 PM'd Kaly to find out when he's getting some more DD's in.  I'm thinking I am going to go ahead and purchase the gears even though I don't have my board yet.  I'll order the board before the end of the month.  I work offshore in the Gulf of Mexico (For the Oil and Gas industry).  I don't expect to be home until then.  Going to get all the stuff ordered before I get home so i can work on and build my board when I'm home.  I keep looking at your build every day.  It really looks amazing.

Sounds awesome @ElectricCoast.  Kaly had an email that went out this morning saying  _"Extended Promo to 2nd Batch, 20 Units Available. Secure Yours Today :-)"_ so hopefully he has some ready.  

A few things I have learned from my first build and from this build.

* Take your time.  Let things dry that need to dry.  Measure where holes should be drilled. Use a file to slowly make any cutouts perfect.  When you have a pile of parts when you get home don't rush it :).

* If you are going to make your own battery.  Research, research, research all of the correct way to do things and safety precautions.  Otherwise, buy one from a reputable builder.

* I had a 10s3p on my first build and quickly regretted that after experiencing voltage sag.  Don't try to save money by getting a smaller battery.   In any future builds I will find myself between 10s4p->12s5p probably.

* When you order from Trampa pick up at least an extra tire/tube/wheel.  Also go ahead and get a handful of bushings since they are so cheap and you might mess a few up trying to get kaly drive on.  I recommend the yellow dampas as well for keeping some type of carving.  You will be doing a lot of straight lines with the stiff dampas (i weigh 210lb).  I have my yellows drilled out as well and waiting on the custom orange dampas

* I found out the easiest way to remove the springs on trampa is not to try and use some clamp (which I tried initially based on some video) but to unscrew the spring from the suspension and remove the adjustable screw from above.  Stand on the board slightly and slide the spring out.   Don't unscrew both at the same time or you will find that one of the springs will shoot out

Be safe out there on the water and be on the look out for the Meg.

I'm very meticulous.  I've been buidling drones for a few years now and those are smaller and have all the very same parts.  As for the battery I've decided to have someone build my battery for me.  I contacted the same guy that built your battery to see if he could give me a price.  I plan on a 12s4p but I'd like to more parallel cells if I could.  I'm a big boy 240 lbs so I need it.

On the enclosure I have, I would not have been able to fit a 12s5p.  Maybe you are going box on the top of board?  Or you could possibly do 10s5p vs 12s4p.   Mine was street carver board.  Maybe HS11 will give you more room.

@cody00 so I ordered everything but made some changes along the way.   After speaking with @Kaly he suggested that I purchase the HolyPro 35° deck since I'm a bigger guy.  He built me a 20700B 12s4p battery with enclousre, BMS, 8A charger etc... I purchased the direct drives as well from him.    I  should have the build put together by the middle or end of next week.  I forgot to order the extra bushing, tires and tube ike you suggested hopefully I'll be ok for now.  I ordered a print for the Meilan light via thingiverse that's going to take up to 10 days (booooooo).   The direct drive, battery, charger etc.. and Trampa board should all be here by the end of the week.

Nothing I would change on this build, @totalgeek9224 . I would have had all kinds of things to tell you on the first build but I wanted this one to be perfect.  I never took the time to add up all of the cost (I like to be able to say... "uhhh. i dont know honey") - I would guess somewhere in the $2500 range

I still haven't started the build as of yet.  There was an attempted delivery to my house 2 days ago but I didn't receive a notification from the USPS for my gear drives.  Kaly still has not sent my battery but he assured me that he would send it this Monday (2 days from now).  So with that being said I should hopefully be able to start the build by next weekend.  

In the meantime I have other ancillary things that need to be done such as filling the holes on the Holypro deck plus prepping all the items to go on the board including some programmable LEDS for the bling bling effect.  l'll take my time making myself familular with the VESC tool and my Flipsky 6.6's. Ironically I just realized that I am still waiting on my canbus cables.  I digress, my point being is there are other things that I will be keeping myself busy with.  

The charger from completely empty batteries to full charge would take by the math 2 hours and 7.5 minutes of course not accounting for the time it takes to balance. I read somewhere for 18650 batteries that you're best of charging them at 1/2 C.  I would assume that 20700B batteries would be about the same.  On a side note if I am wrong about the charge rate and you could charge the batteries at lets say 1C then I know that YZPower has a 50.4V 15A charger and if that could be used then you could charge the battery from empty to fully charged in about 1 hour and 8 minutes again not accounting for balancing time.

Thanks for the follow up.  I'll keep you posted and will try to do a build log.

In my particular situation, there is no way I could have fit an extra two cells in there for (10S5P).  Having one VESC would solve the problem or if your enclosure extended out slightly further (see bottom of my board) then it wouldn't be a problem either.  However this would probably cause a non-uniform layout.  The best person to ask would be @Eboosted

That's probably a question for Kaly - shoot him a message on instagram.  He sends them already mounted on a custom hangar.  So if it was a $ issue then you would probably only be looking at purchasing 1 instead of 2.
