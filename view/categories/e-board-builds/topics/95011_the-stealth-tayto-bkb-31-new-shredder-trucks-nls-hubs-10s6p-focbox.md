First of all I want to thank all the Facebook ESKATE-DIY chat group for the help and support.

A bigger thanks to @danieloath  to for all his help and support on building this DIY.

This is my first build and my second esk8 ( I have an Evolve GTX 2in1) 

The whole idea came up when I wanted something more stealth than my current custom GTX.

It still a working progress, I'm open to tips and comments to improve the final result.

SETUP:
-Tayto BKB 31''
-Shredder trucks
-Meepo NLS hubs
-Meepo 100mm NLS wheels
-Abec 11 bearings
-Enertion FOCBOX Unity
-Enertion Nano-X remote
-106SP custom battery pack by @Tony_Stark with Samsung 30Q cell, 3000mAh, 15A discharge rate 
-BKB custom enclosure stacked version
-Custom skull X-Things
-Seismic Lokton Griptape ''Ninja Pattern''
-Venom bushings
:money_mouth_face::money_mouth_face::money_mouth_face:
More to come...STAY TUNED...

After 3 weeks finally BKB made and delivered my Tayto 31'' and my custom stacked enclosure... 
Happy as Larry :slight_smile:

Custom battery pack!
I opted for a 106SP custom battery pack with Samsung 30Q cell, 3000mAh, 15A discharge rate to make sure that I will obtain a ''decent'' range.

It that layout does not work out correctly there another layout.

@AlanZhou after seeing all your posts it appears you have a case of ‚Äúbattery envy‚Äù.... batteries for carrying the weight of other batteries haha

What type of inserts did you use to mount the enclosure? They look kinda weird in the photos.

And what are you planing to use as a seal?

Anyway, you're gonna have some serious range with that many cells, good luck with the build!

sick build!
- just curious, why did you decide to opt for chinese hubs rather than more powerful ones?

Have not decided yet, still work on it.
What would you recommend?

I was insecure between a 10s5p and 10s6p, then I thought that the whole idea of this build was to have something stealth with top range. That's when I choose the 10s6p.

Since you are open to tips allow me to recommend you to use these spacers:

https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/cLdnPvVq

The integrity of the battery will be much stronger reducing exponentially the chance of failure. Spacers also work as radiators keeping the battery cooler. The only downside is the increase in height but that can be solved with longer screws and rubber. If you press them properly the increase is barely a few mm.

Are you sure that it will fit? Max I could fit with vesc and BMS installed in normal stack config was 12s5p in that enclosure

which is plenty actually üëç

They are just there to make sure that the enclosure and deck stays together. Proper screws, bolts and spacers are on the way lol

I could get into it... But it's too late here.

Simply put - using a phillips head screw, in this day and age, is fucking wrong. It's barbaric. It's ugly, and it's not durable. It's like wiping your ass with pulp fiber instead of using a bidet. Downright SAVAGERY. 

Please invest in some socket head hex cap screws, Torx, Robertson, flanged hex... just about anything other than phillips. It's 2019 yo.

If you now would change just a tiny little thing, the motors could not be destroyed by skating up on smaller curbs at almost any speed.
...The magic would be FWD, bc you where able to lift up the nose by using the tail, and you re able to pop your rear truck against the curb the chinese ollie style. 
Im riding my chinese hubs FWD, too AND SINCE I DO SO, i never ever had to worry about my hubs getting destroyed by punching the curbs. Skating this way is so much more fun and you can tread your board really hard up the curbs. just a hint from a street skater for street skaters.
Peace
EDIT: the same for going down any kind of curb or stairs, but you just need to lift up the nose a bit. It is a very big benefit and i will never go back to RWD bc i fucked up my motors almost weekly. Riding hard this way for about 6 month now, without any damage or issues on my boards and motors, just "pop-klack" "pop-klack""pop-klack" heheheheehhe

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcinaGJk01Y

bc of the very big wheels we skate you dont need the tail to pop, you know?
And the chinese nollie works great as chinese ollie as i discibed already.
double peace and skate or die
