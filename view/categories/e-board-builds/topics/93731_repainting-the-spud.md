Never used glass before. I vaguely remember there being a website to get it from.... I do live near mexico so glass soda bottles are easy to get. Im just always nervous when using goopy shit like that polyurethane spar stuff

@Sender is it possible to skin enclosures in fabric?

This wood look great on a @bigben spud enclosure

If you were cool and on the esk8 news I did a write up about it explaining the steps. It also depends on if you want color or clear. I redid a spud for @Jc06505n

Fabric is pretty tricky on enclosures... the mesh of the composite materials moves to accomodate the shape of the enclosure while fabric does not behave the same way.

I think im getting a hang of this glass frit thing. So i used a greenwine bottle for my classy cherry oak spud and so far so good.  I used two coats of water based polyurethane and addrd the frit after the third coat. Currently on coat four (second cost after glass). ![image|375x500](upload://gRRAl4m7Wc2O6G9Rh4bwd7kztIN.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://rJcsaORWZc4VRFkfpR8aRD7xh3L.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jQNQxFFcIdb0aRJYQnXNewsC8H8.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://i0ffuYK277IzJQJ9VCVOMgcwbFQ.jpeg) i used golf tees to hold the board off the floor since i coated
Both sides before adding glass
