If that lists all you have ordered/have, you might also want to control that thing. So get a remote. Speaking of ready-made, "Nano" and Nano v2 seem to be popular. Browse the forum.
And also a receiver for the remote :slight_smile:

Yea, that is 6S1P on the link. No idea how many of those OP ordered, so no comment.

see how you go bro, but that might be overoptimistic that you will get that far (24km) on pneumatic tires with a 12s 6000mAh pack...
prob. use 25-35whr a km depending on how hard you ride. could be a bit less, but will be more than 11/12 whr for sure
