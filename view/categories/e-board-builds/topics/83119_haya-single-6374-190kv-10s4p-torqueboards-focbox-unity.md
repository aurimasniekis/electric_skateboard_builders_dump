Hello, my name is Oscar and I am 12 years old and a new builder to this forum. I was going to purchase a boosted stealth but then looked into some DIY option after realising that the range wasn't satisfactory for my needs. Firstly I was looking to do a boosted clone like the skate metric foosted board, but then decided to do something different. That's when I met @moone. Seb has been helping me so much with my build, there are 475 messages on our private chat of me asking basic diy questions and him patiently giving me answers that have led me to nearly completing my very first electric skateboard. 

Deck: Haya by @bevilacqua, sold to me by @Friskies (who has also been awesome help).

Trucks, gearing, wheels, mounts: Torqueboards Single motor mechanical kit, with upgraded 218mm trucks and 97mm wheels. ![image|375x500](upload://eeV326GHFXMojL4fs0feRbySB3C.jpeg) 

Motor: Single 6374 190kv Torqueboards

Remote: Torqueboards Nano 2.4ghz.

The battery is going to be a 10s4p 30q made by @Marsen (who has been sorting out everything to do with the battery and has been a massive help).Charge only 20amp smart BMS. I still need to do a bit more foot massaging, car washing and gardening for the neighbours before I can get It though :joy::joy: 

The ESC is probably going to be a Focbox Unity because of the ease of use, battery protection system and is compatible with dual motor upgrade. All great features for a first time builder.

After 6 hours spread 3 over days, I had finished the mechanical side of the build (had a few issues because of my limited knowledge of putting boards together).

So far I am loving the deck, (number 19)  with a perfect length and width for my height, a perfect amount of concave and looks sleek, smooth and fast, it ticks all of my boxes!
 
This build is names Escapii (Ee-scar-pee) for no real reason.

I am hoping to get this build finished by the middle of march, it all depends on if my Mum wants more foot massages :joy::joy::smiley:

The reason I ordered a significant amount of my build from Torqueboards is because shippings to Australia costs to much, so it would be cheaper to get most things from one brand.

Again, a huge thanks to @moone, @Marsen and @Friskies for all the help!!

From Western Australia!!

Sounds like a funding issue not a lack of desire. He's 12. 

Congratulations on the build btw

He is 12- that one big motor will be killer at his weight. And also an extra motor + mount will cost a fair bit. This build is sick!!

Son that there is some nice build!  Glad you went with the haya after all lol.  (there was some indecision)
Make sure you tighten the mount correctly though.  They can be fiddly to set up.  Seb knows the ways of the mounts.  Good luck sunshine and keep the thread updated.  Oh and yeah don't bloody hurt yourself.

Awesome build young gun!!! I have a Haya deck myself. Love seeing all the builds come out with them. Also don‚Äôt fret, single 6374 on a 10s battery is going to be crazy powerful. All my decks so far have been mono drives. Never had a power issue. Like they all said, make sure you rub your mums feet enough to buy decent head protection. Just as important as the wheels. 
Speaking of wheels, you get any bite on those 97‚Äôs? You using risers? Angled?

 At first I got will bite with the 97s when I was pushing it around. But then I tightened up the trucks so I don‚Äôt get speed wobbles and it was all good. Just a 1/8 shock pad that‚Äôs all

Just picked up the battery from @Marsen, everything looks great and now all that is left is the Unity which is still awaiting fulfilment after 2 months. :disappointed_relieved:  :rage: :sweat:

Why getting a unity if you're only in a single drive ?
To be able to easily go on dual later ?

I've got a single HK vesc you could chuck in there while you're waiting little brother.  Get you on the street.  Pm your address and I'll send it over.  All you have to do is replicate this build thread on the news forum and join the revolution.

I like the idea of the unity it‚Äôs because it has many features that are useful for a beginner like me like battery protection, easy set up ect.
