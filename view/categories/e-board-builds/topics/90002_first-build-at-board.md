Hello fellow Esk8ers,

I have a Raptor 2 board at the moment, however the streets where i live are not the best, so i would like to build a board with AT wheels.

I have already bought a 10S4P battery with Samsung 30 Q cells. 

I would like 2 motors.

**Some questions:**

1. Direct drive or belts? brands?

2. Deck? suspension?

3. ESC? I was thinking of Unity

4. Enclosure?

5. Wheels? how big?

6. Remote?


If you guys have any suggestions, or have built your own board with AT wheels, please let me know and share any pictures you have.

Thank you.

$1500 AUD budget, which would be 1100 USD.

I read about the Elofty direct drives, would they be good with AT?

I think Elofty is TKP so not spectacular but if you just want AT wheels on a street build its probably fine, it'll be fast and low torque though

Would this kit from DIYeboard be good?

They are belt driven, i would prefer a direct drive however, not sure what brands are good
