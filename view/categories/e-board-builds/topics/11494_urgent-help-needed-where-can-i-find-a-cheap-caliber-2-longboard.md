fit the motor mount from emertion? If not, where can I find a deck similar to the one I linked but with caliber 2 trucks and cheap (around Â£50-100)? I dont have the right tools for buying the deck and truck separately and then drilling holes into it...


Thanks,
Cal

Most, if not all decks come with holes for the trucks. So you shouldn't have a problem if you get them separate.

Where would you recommend I buy low priced but good quality decks from? I'm building an all terrain if that gives you an idea...
