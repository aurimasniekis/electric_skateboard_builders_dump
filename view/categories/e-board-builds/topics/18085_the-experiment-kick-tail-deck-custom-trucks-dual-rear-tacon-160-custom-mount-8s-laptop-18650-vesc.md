Hello everyone,

I finally got some time to start my build thread. I'm currently a mechanical engineering student and between going to school and working my free time is very limited. I have been wanting to build an eskate for a while now and over the past couple months I started gathering parts for my build. I am calling this build the experiment because I have no Idea what to expect when its done, could be awesome or could catch fire. This mostly due to my battery choice. I have decided to make a 8S pack out of recycled 18650 cells from dead laptop batteries. I know these are not the correct batteries for an application like this, but they were free and I'm curious to see how the pack performs. I have not decided the exact size of the pack but it will be 64 cell minimum, possible even up to 80 cells. Even with this amount of cells the pack will still have a low discharge amperage leading to intermittently pulling 3C or more. Obviously this is no good for the cells, but lets see what happens.

Onto the build. The part I'm most excited for with this build is designing my own truck hangers. I purchased a set of caliber clones before I realized that they were not wide enough to run dual 6364 Tacon motors. An old friend of mine is a machinist and has recently purchased his own 3-axis CNC mill. He agreed to help me out with the trucks as well as the motor mounts. 

I sill have a lot of work to do to get this board done, but I hope to finish for the summer. Anyway here is the build list and some images.

Deck: Ebay Kicktail downhill deck
Trucks: Homemade 200mm CNC hangers on caliber 44° base plates
Wheels: 90mm Flywheel Clones
Motors: 2x Tacon 160 245kv
Motor Mounts: Homemade version of Torque board mount
Gearing: 15T motor / 36T 3D printed Wheel pulley
ESC: 2x Axle VESC
Battery: 8S8P or 8S10P Laptop 18650 cells
Remote: GT2B with 3D printed case
Enclosure: 3D printed

Hi there!

This build looks awesome. Could you post the Link to the Deck on ebay?

I am searching for months/weeks an alternative to the Loaded Tesseract because its too expensive. Yours looks quiet similar.

Thanks in advance!

Thank everyone and yes, the 3D printed parts are just design samples. I want to be sure that my design is perfect before machining. I am even trying to run a stress analysis on the truck and axles in solidworks just to make sure.

Ron, I checked on ebay for the deck I purchased but it looks like they are not listed anymore. The sellers name was decoysupply and it was titled Longboard Downhill top mount quality skateboard blank 9.75 x 37.5" SPEEDBOMB C03.

I haven't had much time to work on the board, but I did get some parts in. I also was messing around in solidworks and made some new truck designs. My plan is to make several designs and let my machinist friend choose the best option. I almost have all 64 cells for the 8S8P pack. Still have a bunch of cells to test and since I have the time I will to go through the rest to find the highest capacity cells. Most of the cells in the pack so far are between 2400 and 2200mAh according to my cheap Chinese testers and my balance chargers.

```
Just FYI,
The stress analysis on solidworks isn't perfect. My boss only lets me use it to verify deflections, but no real engineering can be based on it...
Hangers are made out of 4140 Chromoly Steel which has a tensile yield strength of 65KSI, 6061-T6 aluminum on the other hand only has 30KSI. People bend hangers all the time, so make sure you pick out a good material to machine them out of, and make sure that your friends CNC mill can actually handle said material.

Can't wait to see the results!
Good luck!

Very nice work so far. I think there may be several people interested in a wider caliber hanger. Im looking for a 215mm hanger to fit dual 70mm long motors and 15mm belts. Be interested to find out how much CNC ing the hanger cost?

PXSS, I do agree with you with the solidworks analysis. This will be my first time messing around with the analysis side of the program so I thought I would give it a shot. I am trying to over build the hanger to be safe. This includes using 10mm axles, which I did not want to use but I think it will be necessary, and using 7075-T6 aluminum.

These hangers are around 205mm wide. I was wondering if I should just make them 215mm in case I wanted to get 70mm motors in the future but I can't make up my mind. I feel my board is not that wide and might handle a little weird with that wide of trucks.

Maybe someone can give me some advice on the truck axle. I keep going back and forth between the 8mm axle and the 10mm axle. I was set on using the 10mm axle, but after printing my latest hanger design I am a bit worried about the amount of material around the axle. This is because I am sticking to the same hanger profile as the Caliber II and there is not much material around the axle to spare. My main question is would it be better to have the stronger 10mm axle or to have more material in the hanger and use the 8mm axle.

```
I would say go 8mm only because I love to use skateboard bearings with extended race. It eliminates the need for a spacer and shim washers and allows me to really tighten the wheel nuts. With 10mm you will have to use an industrial bearing and I have not seen much selection in the 22x10x7 size. But to your question about not much material being left with a 10mm axle, how much material is left there like 3mm? I think it would work but may ovalise over time. How much thread extends inside the hanger?
```

## \#16 Posted by: jdyer8989 Posted at: 2017-03-14T15:00:36.583Z Reads: 372

```
Irdesigns, bearing selection is another reason I would like to use the 8mm axles. With the 10mm axles there would be about 3.8mm on the sides of the axle, the top and bottom have more. Using the 8mm axles allow another mm of material. Another consideration is the 10mm axle uses 8mm thread and the 8mm axle has 6mm threads. The shoulder portion of the bolt will slide about 34mm into the hanger.

With 34mm inside the hanger I think both will work perfectly. The M6 thread should be fine provided your not changing wheels every day, then it could wear out a bit faster than the M8 thread.

```
Although 7075-T6 has enough tensile strength, it's fatigue strength is lower than chromoly steel which means that it'll fail sooner seeing the same amount of impacts. The Aluminum in this case is also the stiffer metal which won't be as smooth to ride over bumps and might lead to fatigue.

If you're ok with these trades, then I'd suggest go with an 8mm axle. No need to go larger

Been busy with school, but made some progress. I decided to try the "boosted style" VESC enclosure from Thingiverse. Its a tight fit for two VESCs but should be able to fit them if i move the capitation location. I also started soldering the battery and should have it completed soon.

I see you are using 18650 cells, salvaged from laptop batteries.
In your 8p configuration you will have a very low amperage you can pull from your battery.
I found a safe value to be 1 C for random tested Laptop cells, which would mean 8 amps for 2 Vescs total :sweat:
If you pull too much current from your cells they will eventually die, which can result in a not so nice fire.
I would look into using cell level fuses (pic attached) or different cells. 

Btw: your self designed trucks look awesome

1C means 1xcapacity in ampere.
If they have like 2.5Ah then 1C will give him 8x1x2.5=20A

You are right about that for new cells, but most random laptop batteries were abused and cannot last much more than 1 C,
This is my personal experience with Laptop Cells and it can be different for him, but still suddenly having a fire underneath your feet really sucks.
Most of them have somwhere around 1500 mAh to 2100 mAh left.

Battery: 8S8P or 8S10P Laptop 18650 cells
[/quote]

If assuming 2A per cell min and with 3A max, then he could ''expect'' 16 - 24 A (8P) and 20 - 30A (10P)

It looks like he has a somewhat good cells choosen for the pack, some time ago I found a guy on ES forum, who said **he could pull even about 4-5A per cell** for his e-scooter and his pack was also built out from laptop grade cells.

--
So, unless, he has some hills to conquer for ''general cruising'' I think this might be okay.. Im using 6inch pneumatic wheels with 6s setup and one motor and ''typical'' consumtion seems to be about 300-400w (~15-20A), if I can trust my power meter / analyzer.

For acceleration, usually no more than 600-800w is needed. Not sure how @jdyer8989 fast is planning to go but with 8s setup and ''longboard'' wheels he will be okay, I think.

 Im sure he has planned this battery part good enough, the same as he has done to other parts of his build ;)

I agree with you guys completely. I know I am expecting way to much from these cells, but it is more of an experiment to actually see how they work than an attempt to build the best battery. I am going into this build knowing what to expect and will be sure to keep a close eye on the pack. As exciting as a flaming board sounds I think I will try to avoid it :grin:. I have not spent anything on the cells so if they get damaged quickly it gives me an excuse to build a proper pack.

Haven't had much time to work on the board due to a busy school semester, but will be done with school in a couple weeks. I did however finish the battery pack. All soldered, taped up and balanced. Still need to decide on how I want to mount to the board.

I also found some wood dye called FolkArt Ultra Dye , mostly used for arts and crafts, and used it on the edges and wheel pockets of the deck. My plan is to vinyl wrap on the underside of the deck which will cover up the dye on the underside.

Well, I had a go on the trucks over the weekend and I'm going to take it as a learning experience. It was a little rushed into and the results did not turn out so well. We were short on time and the cam programming was being done on the spot. Luckily we ran a a test piece of scrap 6061 so none of the good metal was wasted. The next attempt should go smoothly because we did learn the best way to do all the setups and plan to get the programming done beforehand.

@jdyer8989  Im a bit into motorcycles. so why your friend has a turbo for his bike? That is just ''crazy'' :D

Though I totally dig the idea.. im not sure though is it still going to be petrol fueled or diesel now?

For petrol usually they use 'superchargers'' right?

But tell me more details.. im totally interested in hearing more why he even needs this.. and what might be the end power from his 'beast' when he finishes building it

Okami, you are right it is crazy :laughing:.

It is still the stock bike motor so it will be running off petrol. There is no need for this really, well other than making a very fast bike. I think it should get up to 80-90hp, which is a decent increase from the stock 50hp.

Made some progress today. I finished the 3D printed truck riser with integrated bullet connectors. I should have spaced the bullet connectors a little more apart because they were close together but I slid some rubber in between and secured with hot glue, just to be safe. After that I threw the trucks on the board and took it for a spin. Now I'm even more excited to get it done. 

I was surprised how quick the board turned, almost made me a little nervous. I've never really ridden longboards, only double kick tail trick boards. I'm wondering if this something I will get use to or does anyone recommend some harder bushings. I might increase the height of the bushing seat in my hangers which should stiffen the trucks up a bit. Anyways on to the pictures,

Printed a larger electronics enclosure that I found on thiniverse. I added a XT-60 port and DB9 for charging.This enclosure is the same as the Boosted style enclosure, but a little larger.

I also finished modifying my cheap 150A watt meter. I made the a harness for the screen so it could be remotely mounted and replaced the 12AWG wire with 10AWG then added the XT-90 connectors.

I don't want to jinx myself but I think the trucks will done this weekend. I am almost done with everything else so the board should be ready to ride soon. I'm getting excited :grin:. 

I ended up not using the boosted board style enclosures because of the small size. I originally planned on making an enclosure to house all the electronics as well as the battery but it would have been way to big. As I have brought up before the laptop cells are not best for this application and I will be replacing them in the future. When that day comes I will look into making a better, and smaller, enclosure that will hold the battery's and electronics. For now I found the easiest way to attach the battery to the board was with straps. I 3D printed covers for the ends of the battery that hold the charging ports and also house the electronics. Its not the prettiest setup, lots of Gorilla tape, but it will do for now.

Half of the rear enclosure. Had to print in several pieces to fit on my printer.

Front battery cap has a DB9 connector for the balance connector and XT connecter on other side for charging. The 3D printed blocks have teeth that bite into the straps so I can get them really tight.

Now I need to make the motor mounts. I was part of the carbon motor mount group buy on here but it looks like I will not be receiving those mounts for a while. This means I will be making them myself. I already used to much of my friends time so I don't even want to ask him to machine the mounts. I will need to cut them with basic tools which I am not looking forward to.

Thanks everyone, I am happy how the hangers turned out. I checked out Korryh's  mounts and they look really nice. I wish I went with these mounts from the beginning.

I need to save some money though so I will still be making, or trying to make the mounts by hand. I will see how the mounts turn out before pulling the trigger on another set. I might even break out my old harbor freight powder coating setup and powder coat the mounts to hide any ugliness. I'll let you know how it turns out

I was wrong :pensive:. I though I could make a nice enough set of motor mounts but I guess not. I attempted to make them today and I am not happy with the results. They would probably work with a little more tweaking but I decided its not worth the time for a sub-par mount.

@korryh - Are your mounts still available? The tacon has 45mm mounting holes.

Does anyone know where else I can get any reasonable priced mounts without the long wait?  I really need to stop spending money on this board but I just want it to be done.

Thanks @korryh, let me know.

The addiction is real! I haven't even rode an electric skateboard yet, but I already know I'm hooked. I am already planning the future battery upgrade. I'm thinking 12S5P Samsung 30Q cells. The only thing I will need to figure out is if I can reconnect the tacon's to a wye setup, therefore lowering the KV from 245 to around 140. That way I don' fry the VESC's.

@WARMAN,  I'm curious, what was your configuration with the laptop batteries? Did you run into any problems or did they just have bad performance?

I built a 10s8p out of samsung 30a laptop cells "30a is the model number not amp rating" 
Just wasn't enough speed,range was ok but the pack was really heavy,couldn't carry the board for long.
I now have a 10s3p "space cell" and hit 30mph+ and get 15+ miles and can carry the board round town if needed.
Don't get me wrong a cheap laptop battery build is ok just nowhere near as good of performance as higher rated 18650 pack buy hey it gets you started and on the road.

@jess.t.moody - Thank you, its somehow is turning out better than I thought it would. The LCD screen is on of those cheap watt meter off ebay. I broke it down then removed the screen and replaced the 12AWG wires with 10AWG. The vinyl decal is actually the plastic from the watt meter. I made a small recess in the 3D printed enclosure for it to sit.

I ended up ditching the axle bolt idea and made some threaded axles out of shoulder bolts. I removed the heads of the bolts and cut some threads. I plan on freezing the axles and heating up the hangers slightly then quickly applying some loctite retaining compound to the axles and sending them into the hangers. Between the shoulder bolt threads, the tight fit, retaining compound and the two set screws per axle I can not see any way they will loosen up. The retaining compound is on the way and once received the board is pretty much done. Still need motor mounts though. Hopefully I can get mounts soon and finally ride!

Received the motor mounts and got to work. Thanks @korryh for the quick shipping. I did have a slight issues with the mounts being slightly larger than my trucks, seeing how the cast calibers have a large variance in the hanger dimensions. After I used a piece of heat shrink on the hanger the mount the mounts grabbed quite well.

I do have a few issues that I need to address. First, the belt seems to be riding off the wheel pulley so only half the belt is in contact with the pulley. It looks like the mounts are perfectly square with the hanger so I am unsure why they are running off. Secondly, for some reason when I shut off my remote while the board was still on the motors stated spinning, slowly and erratically. Its like the receiver is getting a signal/interference from something. this only happened a couple times and once the remote was turned back on it immediately stopped. Anyone have run into these issues before?

By the way, this thing is fast. This is the first electric skateboard I have rode so I have nothing to compare it to, but I was very surprised with how much torque it has. I almost had the board come out from under me a couple times. This is even with the vescs set at 15A BAT MAX each. I might try raising the current slightly but 30A is already close to 2C on the pack so I need to be careful.

Nice build!  what I do with the mount is figure out the distance with the motor connected and on the truck.  Tighten the clamp so the mount doesnt move, then untighen a half turn so it can move.  I put my wheel with the pulley and belt on and tighten the clamp.  Then tighten the top (arc part of the mount) screw so the clamp is all the way against the bottom (opposite the arc of the mount).  Loosen the top screw a bit and turn the wheel with the belt on so you can see if it is on the pulley or if it needs to be adjusted.  tilt the mount left to right to adjust so the belt is on the pulley correctly and tighten the side set screw then tighten the top again.  You may need to repeat the process until it is close.  I just did this yesterday and it took my a few trys.  I ended up using the lock washer half (sent with the mount) between the bottom flat of the mount and the flat of the truck to even the mount out with the slope of the truck. Let me know how it goes.

Check the manual for exact procedure but it's somthing like this, with the board and remote on (leave remote in neutral position) press the little button on the receiver for a few seconds, the lights will flash and now the fail safe is set. Test it by turning off your remote, motors should not move. 

It will basically store the throttle position when the button is pressed and if you ever loose connection with the remote the receiver will give that stored signal to the esc.

Thanks for the help guys. I figured out how to set the failsafe, So there is one problem down. I still need to mess with the motor mount alignment. I noticed the cast calibers have a slight taper to the hanger which makes them get wider closer to the center. My hangers do not get this wide and the motor mounts will not tighten even if I really crank on the pinch bolt. Once I added the heat shrink to the hanger it grabbed fine. I now just need to spend some time messing around with the heat shrink and maybe some washers to shim the mount into the correct alignment. I find it odd though because for some reason if i spin the wheel backwards the belt rides perfectly on the wheel pulley. Then once I spin it forward it starts riding off again.

I ended up printing wider wheel pulleys to help with the belt alignment. I put about ten miles on the board over the weekend and found a few things that needed addressing. First was printing a new front truck riser with a block attached to stop the battery from moving forward. Since the battery is only strapped in it is free to slide forward if nothing is stopping it. Secondly, I increased the BAT max to 40A total and after a couple miles of fast riding the battery was getting a little to hot. The limits of laptop cells becomes apparent very quick. I will say though even at 30A the board has good power. I heard these Tacon 160's had plenty tor torque and I defiantly agree. Although the battery can't handle much current it does have a giant range. I guess it should with around 16Ah of capacity. I imagine the board can easily do over 20 miles on a charge, but I can't say the same for my legs. I'll get some pictures of the completed board soon.

Some updates. I put some miles on the board and its a blast to ride. I'm only running 32A total (2C max on the batteries) and I am impressed with the torque of the Tacon motors. I think I have only charged it twice because the battery lasts forever, but I guess that was expected with 64 cells.

At the start of this project I really could not find much information about people using the recycled laptop batteries so I will make some comments about what I have learned. 

- Can recycled laptop batteries be used to make an electric skateboard?
 Yes they can, but you're going to need a lot of cells.My pack is 16Ah and I don't think I would go any less than that.

- How much current can they provide safely? 
 I would say that 2C is the max I would run these cells at. I tried running 40A (around 2.5C Max on my pack) and after a short ride the pack started getting a little to warm for my liking.

- Does the cell voltage drift because of the mix-matched cells?
In my 8S8P pack I made sure that that 8 cell packs in series all had similar capacities. If I can recall correctly there was only a couple hundred mAh capacity difference between the series packs. I do take that number with a grain of salt because the capacity testing was done with cheap Chinese capacity testers. With that said I think the most voltage drift between the cells I have seen was around .04V. 

- Can I use laptop cells to make a super fast hotrod electric skateboard :laughing:?
I'll just say no, stick to lipo's or good 18650 cells. My board is a tank. It weighs well over 20lbs because of the batteries. I could have built a 40 cell pack out of Samsung 30Q cells and had roughly the same capacity, about three times the current output, while still being lighter and more compact.

- Biggest benefit of using laptop cells.
They were free!

- Biggest weakness of using Laptop cells.
TIME! Is it worth the time :dizzy_face:? I think I had to break apart about 50 laptop packs just to find the 64 decent cells used in my battery. I had to sift through about 300 cells for potentially good cells and then cycle and capacity test until I had the desired amount. Its not hard work, but I spent months going through cells.

I received the carbon motor mounts and plan on using them because the two bolt clamping design works much better on my trucks. I ran into a problem with the motors hitting the 3D printed wire channel when turning.This was due to the lack of angle adjustment of the new mounts. To solve this problem I needed to get rid of the external wire channel by recessing the motor wires into the board. I ended up chiseling out a small channel in the deck then lining the channel with epoxy to seal the wood, potentially stopping cracks from forming. The wires were then chidden with a 3D printed cover.

Your board is sick!  Wish i had access to all of the fun tools you've got there.  I've been looking at a similar board/truck setup.  May I ask what size risers you had to make?  How tall did they have to be so you didnt get any bite from the 90mm wheels to your board?  thanks
