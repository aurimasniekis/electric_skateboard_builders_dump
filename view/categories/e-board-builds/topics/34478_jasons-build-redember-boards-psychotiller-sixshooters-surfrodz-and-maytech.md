This is a board I just finished building for one of my oldest and best friends. We used to race mountainboards together when I lived in Seattle. We traveled all over the place just to hit up some of the best downhill slopes we could find. It didn't stop there though. We also ran a site called WeRideSideways or WRSwest.com and we supplied gear to people wanting to try mountain boards. IT got so popular a local school made us an elective for their kids physical education and we would meet with groups of kids at Woodland Park in Seattle. Super fun!! Another positive from that adventure was the county gave us a bunch of land out in the foothills to develop into downhill riding trails for mountainboards/mountainbikes.

I moved back to California before we completed anything, but Jason still rides out there to this day. We lived a life there in that period of time that I honestly don't think is possible to achieve today. Jason got in touch with me a month or so ago and told me he wanted any board I would make him. He said he wanted it to remind him of all the great times we had snowboarding in the Steven's backcountry, longboarding down through Ballard, and epic fast runs down through Rogers and Woodland Park.

Building this board, with the help of RedEmber, Surfrodz and @mccloed brings back so many of those memories! Hopefully, Jason likes this build as much as we do. Because if he doesn't, Jamie, Matt and I have some serious arm wrestling matches in store to decide who's getting this beast!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/6/26a57388390939bfa52f0ef3dd5bb7d86376131f.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/1/41ffdf27f561e9900063f93f5b2d3e2a1df4da66.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/3/439b9c66bc175d7e73978e13c03927e6ebb7af6d.jpg" width="282" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/c/1c7cbe9db6d16f976d3787f735510767ee893885.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/1/d1049d14be503eea0658a9dbf0036c9bab5d585c.jpg" width="282" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/5/f5c0b9e59a0319a3da621ad2b5f2ff650403b506.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/b/dbc7243a3f66ab3a3069d143c6f8993bfaf049dc.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/9/c94d4075217ff7cb74ca0e05b6a67288f4aeccf4.jpg" width="689" height="390">

 I will definitely be on the lookout for the board when riding around Seattle! Looks awesome though

That's a great story and a great build. Congrats. I don't think you guys will have a chance to arm wrestle for anything. He's probably gonna love it. Subbed and hoping to get some juicy video after he gets it.

@psychotiller, are those the  10mm 177 tkp's with 70mm axles?  I think i need to give them a shot.  What size motors are on there?  6355's?

Yup, that's the size of the trucks. We have 80mm axles in there though. The motors are 200kv 6369s.

Perfect! If you run 6355's you can roll with the 70mm axles.
