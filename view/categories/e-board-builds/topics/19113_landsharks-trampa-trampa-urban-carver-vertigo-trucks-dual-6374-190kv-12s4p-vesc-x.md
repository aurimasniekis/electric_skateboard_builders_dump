Starting a build thread for my newest project.  This will be my first ESK8 build, but I have done plenty of similar work with quadcopters, rc helicopters and cars.  I have to learn quite a few things such as BLDC VS FOC, programming VESC-X, battery and electronics waterproof mounting systems, etc....Just recently spending time on this forum I've seen that people are willing to lend a hand...pass on info, so I'm not to worried about it.

I'll include prices as well, because I know I'm always curios as to what other have paid

Here is the parts list I have so far and hopefully will start ordering by the end of the week

**Deck**: Trampa Urban Carver, I plan on reversing trucks and using Street Carver Motor mounts to account for the street wheel clearance issues $450 

**ESC**: Dual VESC-X, Group buy $220 

**Motors**: Kaly 6374 190kv motors $200

**Battery/charger/bms**: Barajabali aka Chiboards 12s4p Samsung 30q custom power pack, for pricing send him an inquiry

**Enclosure**: Kaly custom Urban Carver enclosure $75

**Radio/receiver**: Hobbyking GT2B and Master Cho mod $50

**Motor Mounts**: Kaly Motor Mount Kit with belts and pulleys $240

So thats where I'm at for now.  Please post any suggestions, tips, ideas or what to consider or possibly change!

Thanks for the shout @willpark16

I think he's going to need a flexible battery with that deck which would need to be custom made. 

P.S. I am also going to have sealed 6374 190kv motors in about 1.5 weeks if your not in a rush

I'm definitely not in a rush.  Right now I'm pricing things and still trying to figure this whole esk8 project out. Do you have specs or any info on the motors you have coming?

So I'm researching the vesc x and it looks like 12s might be a little too much voltage for it, but I'm looking for 12s torque and speed when I want it.

 I might even end up towing my wife around on my other foot powered skateboard sometimes just for fun, haha.

Can the vesc x handle 12s or should I plan this build around 10s. I weigh 185 and live in flat south Florida

Ok folks, well board arrives tomorrow.  I'm excited to check it out, assemble and have Gator, my bull terrier, pull me around the hood, next best thing to an esk8. :sunglasses:

I'm planning on posting pics of the build along the way.  

After researching and finding a lot of parts I need, I hit a wall with the power pack.  First off the price for a pre made pack was def not what I was expecting, but I completely understand the time, energy and cost of materials that is required to build it.  But luckily I found someone to lend me a hand and spot weld it all together, super cool.

So this post is to ask for input on sourcing the following parts to complete the power pack and what people have had success with

**-BMS**: Bestech seems like the option, do I really have to order from the slow boat from god knows where? This is one in specific I'm looking at

http://bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html

**-XT90 for Anti spark switch and for pigtail coming off power pack**

**-Waterproof charge port**

http://www.ebay.com/itm/111889160001?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT

**-Battery Monitor**

**12s Charger 2 or 4 amp**  

Anybody have a good one for sale?

Am I missing anything?

So after I looked over everything today and considered shipping, sourcing all the materials, labor costs, my time involved, learning curves and opportunities for screwing the pooch.  I felt getting my power pack built for me was a wise, albeit expensive, decision that I'll leave to the experts.  Yes it cost more than I expected or wanted to spend but at least it will be 100%, so... ramen noodles from here on in gentlemen!

Cool stuff starting to come together!

Just received the board today and am really happy with the quality of it.  I had to reverse the hangars so if I decide to switch over to a street wheel the clearance will be ok.  

It was a bit of a pain in the butt and I'm not sure if there is an easier to do it, but I basically removed all the fasteners on the springs, popped them out, unbolted the hangar from the base, reversed it and muscled/finessed the springs back into place and secured everything.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/38c057fa15fc248898ce866b5fffdad552e583e0.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/f/ff21494d666a4423910fa9e7d4897e0d21ac6f2e.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/a/aafb321eaac1bfb6dd6aa707a58bba8a3a7998be.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/b/9b593f2e379ec397d478ad6e95fef9754d284ea6.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/8/c83ece41898b2911ad407e7e0db28ab26ad547d9.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Took the board for a cruise around the block with Gator tonight and all I can saw is that it is super smooth.  With the flex in the deck and the pneumatics it is like riding on a magic carpet.  This is my first longboard (I have had plenty of shortboards) and wasn't sure what to expect.  Def happy with my decision to choose Trampa as the base for this ESK8. Looking forward to getting some power to it!

[/quote]

This is definately a nice comparison! Maybe it should be quoted somewhere when someone asks what it feels like riding a pneumatics setup :D

Non the less.. wish u luck with the build, looks like u have choosen a really nice base,

 **Did u take grey wheels on purpose or the cost for other colors was too much?** 

I just find it that it is later hard to match the colors of enclosures and other things on board.. if you got an ''odd'' wheel / hub color

I had blue hubs for wheels before but now i have black ones.. it seems that matching black color is a lot easier and involves less work.. ;D hope u understand my point about wheel color based from this perspective..

--

So yeh, when u can update us with more pictures.. personally would be interested what enclosure you have in mind for this build.. is it going to be the one from user barajabali / ChiBoards ?

 ... just suspecting u might have ordered it from him, since you said it was custom work and paid some margin to get it done

I didn't specify a tyre color but the grey works for me, I think thats the standard color they send on complete decks.

As for enclosures I ordered one from Kaly specifically for this deck and I have Barajabali building me a power pack to fit it.

Here are a few pics from the gear I received this past week.  I just installed the motor mounts as a mock up, I'm not doing the final assembly until my power pack gets here. 

I'm happy with the quality, time will tell after I ride it for a bit on how it holds up, but so far so good. :+1:

One thing I did was remove the yellow dampas on the trucks.  The board carves much better, but it now rubs the tires...as a reference I weigh 185lbs and have the 15 ply deck.  I'll prob have to keep them in so I don't have that issue.

Actually...I'm going to move the springs to the outer position, maybe that will help

Fast forward 20 minutes...it helped, can't carve as deeply but no rubbing with springs in outer position

Here is an update with the motor mounts all ready to hit the road, locked down and loctited up.  Next step is to fit the enclosure! Its coming together...

BTW I was told today by some nefarious character @Crushkrew that my tires looked like "old lady scooter tires"... but to be fair I pretty much agree.  

Anyone have a pair of black 7" tires to sell? 

How does this belt tension look?

You have to reverse the hanger to use the 7" pneumatics. Otherwise wheel bite will occur.

@trampa   Thanks, but I reversed it on purpose to be able to use street wheels when I want to.  I've leaned into as hard as I can and where the springs are at the moment I'm not experiencing any wheel bite, but when the springs were in the inner position I did.

So far so good, but if it becomes an issue I'll def switch them around.

I see what you mean, but it looks like Kaly mounts work only in the street carver configuration. Can I have the trucks with the drive train on them set up for street carver and the front set up for urban carver? Will it effect the boards handling with two differently positioned trucks?

That's fine! You can use stiff setup in the back and loose setup in the front (outer and inner spring position). We designed our drive train to allow both hanger positions, using the #45UC or #45SC clamp. Ted rides a board with urethane street wheels in the back and pneumatics in the front. Anything is possible.

Here are some pics for you guys.  The board is really powerful, like no joke you'll get hurt powerful.  Lots of torque and I don't even run wide open throttle, mainly cruise around 20mph, but have pushed it to 30mph without trying to hard.

I am running BLDC Hybrid sensors with Can bus

the only settings I have changed are 

Motor Max/Min 65/-65
ERPM 60000/-60000
Voltage cut off/end 36/33.6 (12s)
