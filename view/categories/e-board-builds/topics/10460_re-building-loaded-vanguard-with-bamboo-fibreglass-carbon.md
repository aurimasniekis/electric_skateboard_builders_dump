jojo, been sitting on these 1/16" bamboo plys since a while now (from roarrockit) and always wanted to build my own board ... but then the loaded vanguard happened to me and I really fell in love with that board, hard to imagine a better carver right now. but there are a few very minor things Id like to change - first of all I want Id like the board just a liiiittle bit wider, probably 1cm is already enough. 2nd Id like the middle section to be just a tiny bit stronger and the rest of the board a little flexier - I Imagine that way I could pump harder and have an even springier energy return while at the same time its damping cracks and bumps even better with the softer nose & tail sections.

In any way, Ive never built a board yet all by myself, but since I got a vacuum setup, the bamboo plys and enough experience with fiberglass and cfk I just went for it.

I started with measuring the thickness of the flex 2 vanguard, since nothing will affect the flex as much as the thickness and the strength of the outer layers. its about 1.1cm with my added fiberglass top layer - with the 1/16" bamboo veneers, I decided to start with 4 layers for now, sandwiched with fibreglass which is apparently a good lively springy combo, so: 

bamboo fiber bamboo fiber bamboo fiber bamboo = 7-8mm thickness right now

I worked in the things I wanted to pimp a little in the correct layers, so before the streetside bamboo ply, I added 3 wide unidirectional stripes right in the middle of the board along the boards axis - middle 30cm, outer sides 20cm for some sort of smooth stiffness transition.
below the upper bamboo layer, I added 2 unidirectional 45° crosses for torsional stiffness, because I need to get edge pressure to the trucks.
now, keep in mind: I actually have no clue about building boards, but thats what my naive mind came up with and Ill just try it now. :smiley: 

the outer layers are all bamboo right now, because Ill sink in enclosures and wires as usual (or well, sinking in enclosures by about 1mm only so there wont be a transition board->enclosure like on my jet spud build). so either way Ill cover the bamboo up later with either fiberglass if the flex suits me, OR carbon if the flex wasnt enough! if the flex is completely far off, ill add one more bamboo lower top or bottom - undecided yet! :slight_smile: 

my active vanguard - went for the annual maintenance and want to change a few minor things like sinking in the lids of enclosures for some splash proofness. you can see the torsional stiffness crosses (its otherway round in the picture - the crosses will be on the boards top side and thats how it cures right now.

the smooth cambered concave of the vanguard - the veneers are about 2cm wider than the board at both sides - so there is a lot of room to make the board a little wider than the original! 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_2.jpg

finally, since the bamboo/fibre composite works against the cambered board and I wanted to preserve the vanguards camber profile, I added some weights for curing. nothing feels as great as well balanced lively camber.

curing as we speak, Ill keep you updated on this experiment :slight_smile:

Looking forward to this! Always love Vanguard builds, my favorite deck in terms of feel and looks. Too bad I can't afford it :sob: . Been trying to find a stiff/cheaper equivalent of it for a while though, might end up making my own :3

ok, since I was busy with my real loaded vanguard maintenance and my beautiful veneers finally arrived, I kept on working on that, in order to enjoy the last nice days in autumn with my favourite board.

wood veneers are soo BEAUTIFUL! :heart_eyes: I ordered quite a few different woods and 1 sheet of about 200 x 30 x 0.06 cm dimensions costs only about 7€ and will restore the neat wooden natural vanguard look - or actually surpass the original look because the veneers I got are really a nature's work of art.

currently the board is curing in the vacuum bag - the veneers are very thin - just 0.6mm thick - so I was super careful. its fixated on the board with epoxy ontop of the additional fiber glass layer, that I used to reinforce the boards routing areas (and I added one more layer ontop of the reinforcement patches to get a little stiffer board.

status quo of the vanguard top. the routing and filling of the wire channels kind of killed the nice original look, which is the reason why I used black instead of transparent vicious griptape.

some of the veneers - together with red ronin trucks and black trampa stickies, this vanguard will become something really beautiful:

went with a moderately strong wood grain veneer with a very cool pattern. I placed the board in a way that the wood grain "arrows" point exactly from the roear tip to the front tip of the board. the wood grain will also become more prinounced once I oil the topside. :slight_smile:

bit afraid that I might destroy the veneer accidentally at the boards edges when I cut it out tomorrow. or well, actually Im afraid that the pressure and slight bending was killing off the edges already. :grimacing:

lets see, fingers crossed! :smiley_cat:

giant fail! basically I had the board ontop of the veneer ontop of cardboard without a release film between veneer and cardboard. this morning I had a great unified board+veneer+cardboard finish. :crying_cat_face:

epoxy apparantly managed to get through the veneer on the whole surface area, probably because it has a pretty low viscosity. this will teach me for the next attempts. :frowning2:

Second this - any chance to carefully sand off the carbon and re-expose the veneer you wanted?

Looks beautiful and another great walk through!  

Good luck!  If that doesn't work, looking forward to round 2 and what you do next!

very happy with my work! under the vicious transparent grip, you can see the bamboo grain just slightly, but enough to immediatly understand that its natural wood! with the red truck and black trampas, its just a gorgeous combination imo :slight_smile:

after my aesthetically very pleasing winter maintenance of my vanguard, I went back to my pressed deck. last night I had an idea about the shape I wanted to try because Im not a superbig fan of the bottle nose, I wanted a slightly wider stance, slightly wider board and possibly some splash protection.

decided to make the original stance longer by 3-4 cm on each side, but I cut off the bottle nose with a smooth circle. basically on that picture you can see the seemingly smaller board inside (the original flex 2 vanguard), a 3-4 cm shifted outline, the base of the original bottle nose and the new round nose in 2 version - one with original base stance and one with my increased stance.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_4.jpg

cut it out with a jigsaw and sanded the edges a little
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_5.jpg

next to its shape donor - you can see how the base stance is wider (actually the whole board is wider too by about 1 cm), but the bottle nose it cut off
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_6.jpg

I increased the original camber a little bit, hoping for an even livelier board and carving experience
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_7.jpg

here you can see that its wider (well, not very well), but overall a little shorter
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_8.jpg

smooth camber
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_9.jpg

with the beautiful concave of the donor vanguard :slight_smile: 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_10.jpg 

right now its 4 layers bamboo, 3 layers fiber + reinforced carbon patches for torsional stiffness which you can see in the picture (+ some extra hidden patches in the middle region where the original vanguard felt a little soft).
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/diyvanguard_12.jpg



since I decreased the overall length, its not superflexy anymore, but still too flexy for my weight (not by much though). overall it might actually be perfect, if I use it for an all weather build, add wire channels and seal the rest with a top & bottom layer of fiber glass.

I guess, since it also fits the 6355. the trampa wheels are only available in 83mm right now, but ted expects them to be available in 90mm around xmas. the wheels are really weird - they feel quite a bit harder than my 75A 90mm abecs, but they really grip a lot better. like REALLY a LOT! :smiley_cat:

yea, the thread is a little mixed up. started with pressing my very first own deck with the donorshape of my original vanguard, then I jumped ships to finish winter maintenance with the bamboo veneer and transparent grip. now that the old girl is sexy again, I went back to my pressed deck after I made up this very cool new modification of the shape! :slight_smile:

Thanks for clearing it up, so for the one with the transparent grip - was it just this "bamboo fiber bamboo fiber bamboo fiber bamboo".

How would i try that out if i buy the veneer sheets.

Also would it possible to have a built in enclosure or would that make the bamboo too weak

the one with the transparent grip, red trucks and black trampa wheels was my original vanguard thats been running over 2000km now. for next season I wanted a more natural look, so I removed my black vicious, covered the wire channels ontop of the board with a 0.6mm bamboo veneer, clearcoated with a thin layer of epoxy, followed by transparent vicious grip tape.


the other storyline is my DIY pressed deck (the one with 4 bamboo plys, 3x fiberglass and carbon 45° unidirectional stripes with that new kind of shape = no bottle nose). I just restarted working on that after I fixed up my "old" vanguard flex 2 for next season. today I drew the new shape, cut it out and sanded a little. :slight_smile:

build in? nah, dont think so! I specifically want a very flexy deck with great damping and springy energy returns. any enclosure must be split and working it in means, the board will instantly be too stiff because of the decks thickness.

if i set it up to be electric, I would just follow my original vanguard build, since it works very very well. https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=80808

yea, just used my original vanguard as shape/blueprint in a vacuum sack - check the initial post for the pictures.

if you dont have a board you love as a blueprint, it can be done like @MasterCho with some acrylic sheet for camber & concave. check his board building threads - they are amazing with great results!

I added 2 ronins to the board just now ... and my forever-leftover kegels to test the board on the road a little ... on socks, no grip tape and I didnt want to make the bamboo dirty just yet. :stuck_out_tongue: 

well, what can I say ... what felt good when it was seated on 2 bricks and before it was cut is now WAY too flexy with trucks on wheels. :unamused: Ill certainly have to add one more bamboo layer or some serious gfk top & bottom! probably one more bamboo layer is the way too go ... and then fine tune with thin GFK layers. got a lot of time during winter and my vacuum pump is silent. :slight_smile:

results: with 5 layers bamboo and 4 layers GFK in between, Im now pretty happy with the Flex (ist now just a tiny bit too flexy for me). once I add some channels and a notch for the enclosures, Ill wrap it completely in gfk for weatherproofing, which should really yield the amount of flex I was looking for!

some flex testing - I think it will really be spot on once I have it wrapped in one top and one bottom layer of GFK.

its very springy and got a lot of pop. was wondering if loaded did anything special with their boards - turns out they dont. cambered bamboo + gfk = springy board with a lot of pop. :slight_smile:

I heard of GRP before from suppliers . Maybe GFK is. I haven't stayed in US long enough to know.

German language is cool. I took German classes in my high school as a third language and currently my son is also taking it in his high school.

few weeks ago I started fiddling again with my first DIY pressed board - it finally got the perfect flex after some sanding, routing and finally adding carbon (man, carbon is so strong, a carbon layer on the outer layer is really massively affecting flex - i think I got lucky with the outcome. expect to add some GFK to the top for fine tuning the flex, but the carbon bottom brought the flex just where I wanted it. or well, initially I had the boards edges covered in carbon too, but it felt just a tiny bit too stiff, so i sanded it down again and now I love it!).

I couldnt really sink in anything, because the board is very slim - all I did this time was sinking in the future enclosure lid in advance (following my jet spud build). these sunk in lids REALLY help avoiding sand, dust and wet inside your enclosures, because its a double corner entry for all these things - really hard to pass. at the same time its very elegant to have the enclosure lid at the same level as the rest of the board.

electronics and battery done 2 weeks ago - its a 10S3P LG HG2 battery with a german vesc and a custom 2x 2200uF capacitor layout to account for the very limited space I have. even though I like 10S4P a lot more, my daily commute to work works with a 10S3P without overly stressing the battery. I did this to minimize enclosure and maximize unaffected board flex really.

as you can see, I set back the enclosures as much as possible towards the trucks - the middle flex part is really as large as it can be, the motor is forcing the rear enclosure into some L-shape. tested all the relevant heights and wheel clearance - everything will fit to the millimeter! :smiley:

for the enclosure, I will probably try something new: I want to use the electronic parts as they are, fixate them on the board with double adhesive tape and use them directly as mold for the enclosure. that way it will be the absolute best possible fit, no rattling, no movement, nothing. all parts are already covered in a 2mm felt layer, including the vesc. the copper heat sinks of the vesc are partially sunk into the board on the lower side to give it an overall low profile. think all the components can widthstand atmospheric pressure and Im looking forward to the results. possibly, it looks like an accident with bumps and dents, but then again its the street side anyway and in the end form should follow function.

here are some pictures that show some of the ingredients. its old wheels, Im probably buying the 90mm stickies from trampa once they become available.

Would you please post how you connect the capacitors between the battery ans VESC?, do you have any picture of the layout? On yout build did you use just a standard 2200uF capacitor?

I wonder if I should use two capacitors, 1100uF for each VESC?

yea, 2x 2200uF 63V 105°C capacitor (probably one wouldve been fine too). layout is very simple - they are bottom to bottom and the passing cables are just connecting them in parallel. both of them fixated by shrink tube and the pin sides are under hot glue! check the third picture, think thats pretty clear.

Awesome as always ! :smile:  Your boards are the sole reason I think people should go DIY instead of a commercial board... Just knowing its possible to get a product finished at this level is motivating me haha... 

Are you carving channels on the top of the board again ? Do you have a router or are you using an "Fräßaufsatz" ? I'd love some pics for that process if possible :) 
Does the length of the cable that connects the batterys affect the connection ? Or does it even matter when using 12/10AWG ?

hehe, thanks :slight_smile:

yea, ill carve channels for the battery connections ontop of the board - probably skipping the LHB motor wire channels this time though. for pics, just check my jet spud thread - its exactly the same thing really: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carbon-jet-spud-freebord-bindings-single-vesc-10s3p-lg-hg2/5805

and yea, if you use 10AWG wires, the length is quite negligible imo!

ive been riding the black 83mm trampas since a while - they are comparable to the 80mm kegels - feel a little more grippy on bad pavement, but also a bit harder than the 80A kegels. overall the comfort of 90mm 75A flywheels is much better. but black looks pretty cool tbh :stuck_out_tongue:

hm, I doubt it! maybe @trampa can help you out there, Im reluctant to try, cause Id have to reapply all the loctite again and my supply is running short. :stuck_out_tongue: 


been busy during xmas - had a few small screwups on the DIY bamboo/fiber/carbon rebuild, mostly aesthetic stuff, but I had the time and I still had all the mats, so I pressed a new board. this time I made it even larger and a little wider - its now exactly 1m long, actually a larger wheelbase than the vanguard flex3 even though it doesnt have a bottle nose. its nearly 2cm wider to give a little more leverage when carving. again 5 plys of bamboo with 4 GFK layers in between.

here it is - its quite a giant, nearly as large as the whole flex2 vanguard, also nearly the same wheelbase. :smiley:

the last time I had a few screwups cause I just didnt take enough time to prepare everything perfecly. this time I was meticulous and drew ALL the needed lines beforehand, even the lines where I would place the router guidances. predrilled all the holes for enclosures so that when I vacuum the board and the enclosures, I can already see the holes and have perfect alignment!

after routing I had quite a few router bit burn marks. sadly, because my original plan was to put a transparent GFK layer on the board and make the enclosures transparent with gfk only. wouldve been awesome tbh, but there was no way I would get rid of the burn marks properly (or well, with a TON of sanding maybe). I routed an extra deep hole for the vesc heat sinks :slight_smile:  overall routed deeper this time, to allow some sealing tape under the enclosures and still sit flush with the board surface. this time the screw holes are also placed much better (= closer to the corners of the enclosure). on my original vanguard that was a weak spot.

the other side holding the 6S3P part of the 10S4P battery is a lot less complicated.

the electronics are very compact, i reduced the number of capacitors to 1x 2200uf and now all I got is a 2 x 9.5cm area for receiver, on/off switch (loop key) and charge port. worst case, Ill piggyback the receiver pcb directly ontop of the vesc. just dont want ESC magnetic noise to disturb the reception. hmhm :confused:

@whitepony is known for not using a BMS. Basically he is the reason why I felt confident enough to not use one as well. With quality 18650 cells drift is not an issue so a BMS is not crucial to have. Also look at the tight fit he is using - there is not even space for a BMS :heart_eyes:

i just love the deep shimmer of carbon <3

flex is perfect again: 5x bamboo, 4x fiberglas alternating, finally 1x carbon after routing seems to be really great for my weight of 82kg. since I made the board even longer (100cm now) and I carved out more wood (2mm over the whole area), I used thicker fibreglas to counter that. on my last board 200g/m^2, now I used 390g/m^2. feels like the boards have pretty much the same flex, so either the fibreglas didnt have a big impact anyway sandwiched in between bamboo, or I was just lucky once again.

tomorrow ill connect the batteries and hopefully i can finish the enclosures this week. id really like to try to use the part themselves as mold. has anyone ever tried that?

I would expect some not so awesome looking enclosures, but the perfect fit and the slimmest possible profile. I mean, its under the board, in my case even 2mm inside the board - you wouldnt see much of the enclosure anyway.  :thinking:


directly unwrapped:

added the battery connections, just used 12awg this time so I wouldnt have to dig out that much (its actually mostly about the exit of the wires - the wire runs partly under the 18650 cells and a 10awg wire would not really fit under that too well. in the end its just a single motor cruiser with probably 10-20A current average, so Im not very worried. :slight_smile: 

the channels are filled with resin and to make it perfectly flush, I used fine putty and one more time sanding:

and thats how the other side looks like - battery plus pole arriving near the loop key enclosure spot, the shorter one is the serial connection between the split packs. the copper heat sinked vesc is now perfectly flush with the board surface and every single part of its surface is touching the board, so when I apply pressure, the mosfest and the JST plugs will evenly share the load.

finally the sweet 5/4 bamboo/fibreglas + 1x carbon board flank  :heart_eyes: you can see that its not particularly thin, but its also not particularly thick.

my pump is a very small laboratory membrane pump from KNF. its very convenient to use, because it doesnt need oil and its very silent too ... but its also quite expensive.

yea, thats correct, but it works for all emtbs and it worked for my vanguard too since thousands of kilometers. maybe cause I used 10awg wires or had 2 4000uF+ capacitors, who knows! i went for just 1X 2200uF this time to reduce the loop key spark, which over time eats away the gold connectors! if something isnt stable, ill add another 2200uF!

vanguard cables were about 50-60cm!

tonight im babysitting our youngest dog who hasnt experienced new years eve yet, so im soldering a little with my private audience :sweat_smile:

its the cleanest job of my boards so far. using the new APS remote and hoping that it will work through carbon. removed the receivers enclosure (which is huge), removed all channel pins except ch2 and shrinked it all into a tidy package (hot glues the vesc receiver 3pin cable). the 3 motor phase wires will leave the enclosure LHB style i think - wanted to do it differently at first but ah well, its the cleanest solution.

one red wire comes from the battery in front, exits the carbon directly behind the receiver module. the other wire comes from the cap and runs behind the edge of the receiver. the power cables are on the opposite side of the antenna and of the receiver vesc connection to minimize any magnetic induction from strong currents!

after some consideration, I added a carbon window for the receiver (it acts as a receiver seat for the vacuum enclosure mold as well) and routed the LHB phase wire channels on the board topside.

its amazing how much time these things always take, I feel like a snail. :kissing_smiling_eyes:

top side got routed channels next to the motor, but this side is more intersting: i kinda made a permanent connection of board and vesc. if this thing blows up it will be oretty hard to remove and most of all reattach later. i didnt really find a better solution if I eant to use the components as mold. open for ideas!

same problem with a loop key and charge connection: how can I set up connectors as mold when I want them later sticking through the enclosure. its all a little awkward, but ill make the direct mold thing work!!

tonight I jumped into action - last night I was fixating the loop key + charge port with sugru (gave it a small ramp pointing slightly upwards and once the enclosure is cured I can remove sugru, drill 3 holes and attach it to the enclosure):

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/d/edde56207d52e018296832f7db66b368e7fe0c9a.jpg" width="690" height="448">

while I had sugru open, I also attached it to all of my triple layer nickel bands leaving the cell packs for the routed serial connections - smoothing out sharp nickel edges - didnt want it to pierce my separation foil between board/components and the fibers.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/2/920c1ebb94d2d74d9902f8d679200441851663bb.jpg" width="645" height="500">

all components are fixated with double adhesive tape, the vesc is additionally fixated by the 3 wires sunk into the board. the pcb has contact on full length with the boards surface - the 3 copper heatsinks are routed into the board. was a little afraid that atmospheric pressure might just break the pcb otherwise.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/3/8370ebcc16b47de3b1e0cf7ac313fa0e7a762d3e.jpg" width="375" height="500">


finally laminating. used a lot of resin and in total 5 layer - 3x 400g/m^2 glas, 2x 200g/m^2 carbon. was hoping to smooth out some of the sharper features and irregularities by that. you can see that the cells, despite heatshrinked and wrapped in felt are clearly visible. the electronic stuff around the vesc is less clear, also the very sharp features of the copper heatsinks are very rounded - didnt really manage to model sharper edges - the fiber sheets are well connected already and it was really hard to drag around the sheets through the vacuum bag.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/3/e3d558a144ee4bb82e19e51d40662c3550b23f37.jpg" width="666" height="500">

think in the end, the results can vary between "pretty good" to "interesting". in any case, its the roadside of the board, takes 100km to make it look like crap anyway, so even if things arent perfect I think I will be fine with the results. wont find a better fitting enclosure for board & electronics than this and it make me clean up the electronics more than I ever did in the past.

i wrapped everything in cling film and used a separation foil too. didnt want resin on components or the board and most of all I didnt want resin pressing in behind components so that i wouldnt be able to separate enclosure from components anymore. basically did a wet layup on the separation foil, quite loose actually, I let the vacuum pull everything into form. i really hope that i get the enclosures off later! :stuck_out_tongue:

even though I didnt have much time tonight, I just needed a sneak peek on the enclosures. first of all: they just fell off :joy: so my fears that I might have trouble getting the enclosure off the boards/components was unfounded:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/0/e092d8dc200cffcff9b35e002a8ae700d45e3317.jpg" width="690" height="412">

here is the inside:

you can see very nicely the spot where the VESC usb port pressed into the enclosure flank :smiley:

and thats how the surface looked directly after unwrapping. I expected the crinkles, but it couldve been worse I think. never ever had an enclosure without them. the rear enclosure with the electronics looks actually not that bad - vesc and vesc power cables are clearly visible, every detail pressed forever into carbon. plus some extra crinkles :sweat_smile:

anyway, impossible to just leave it like that and mind my other business, so I at least had to cut it out and give it some rough sanding. keep in mind, the enclosures are just put ontop of the enclosures without any pressure - all rims can be sunk in flush with the board (and I was generous with cutting, think I could take off more material, but for now decided against it, cause that bend edge will give a lot of stability for the screws.

soo, front enclosure with battery only - that one looks really pretty great:

rear enclosure - ok, its admittedly a little special, but it doesnt look that bad to be honest! :slight_smile:

and with the trucks to see how close the enclosures actually are to the trucks and how much surface there is between the enclosures!

I think it will look pretty great once the screws are in and the enclosures are actually flush with the board! right now, the shadows of the bent edge destroy the visual impression a little. ;)

haha, ah well, I somehow I think its not that bad and Im usually quite anal about aesthetics. 

the original idea was a bamboo natural board with transparent fiberglas enclosures. the problem right now is, that in that light you have max shadows and max lightning reflexes, so any imperfections are really exaggerated. thats a problem you wouldnt have at all with a transparent fiberglas enclosure where its hard to even spot which kind of surface and form you have.

sadly my router left a lot of burn marks on the bamboo, so that in the end I decided to use carbon instead of fiberglas. 

but that aside: I really think that once the board is ridden, you wont even see the enclosures anymore, because the board is quite wide, the enclosures really narrow and as slim as it gets. few hundred kilometers riding and everything is matte, dusty, scratched and only one thing counts: reliability, robustness, rattling and weatherproofness. thanks to all the features imprinted into the enclosures, they are the stiffest and most robust enclosures I ever made. features add a lot of strength, just like concave & co adds a lot of stiffness to a board. :slight_smile:

If accept constructive criticism, I'd suggest to trim the enclosures following the shape of the board, it'll look a lot nicer IMO. Just to be clear, it doesn't look bad at all!

[/quote]

I agree, it looks more harmonious - did that on my vanguard and on the first pressed board on this thread - but my building experience decided against it this time:

* you route a lot more surface than whats needed
* the rim is partially a lot wider than whats needed, and the wider a surface is, the more likely it is going to rattle in some way
* if the rim surface is wider than necessary and picks up vibrations easier with the board, dust and sand is a lot more likely finding their way between rim and board and eventually entering your enclosure OR you have the screws following the curvature of the board and the components arent 100% fixated which was the main goal with this build - waterproof supersolid minimalistic enclosure with absolutely zero ratting. rattling/movement is what causes wear over time. not many people ride so many kilometers with their boards - anything that moves will eventually wear something down. on my vanguard I had to resolder the battery exit wires 2 times now. never broke on the run, but maintenace was definitely needed. ;)
* its very simple to realign screw-holes and screws after everything is done - I knew from older builds, that screwholes you set up initially sometimes arent perfect because of how the laminate turns out. it happened this time too - the rim is bent upwards a little sooner than I thought, so I probably want the final screw holes closer to the electronics. with a rim following the curvature of the board, the routing and the very undefined electronic edge of vacuum laminates, its very hard to properly align screws. the outer edge however is very clear and precise - a very useful guidance!

all of this stands vs. aesthetic reasons when you turn over the board, which you basically never do. the rim is sunk in flush with the board, you cant even tell the rim form, even if youre looking with your head on the floor. easy win for the pragmatic functional form tbh. :stuck_out_tongue:

you guys just wait until I shoot some fotos with the enclosures properly attached and sunk flush with the board standing on its wheels. :slight_smile:

didnt have my blacked screws anymore, so I used silver which is a little too unstealthy, but I wanted to see the fit and the flush edge. think you cant get more stealthier unless you completely hide electronics in the boards body. :slight_smile:

very happy with the stability, 400g/m^2 glass is really sturdy and the structure of the components really stiffes it up. on these enclosures you could probably railgrind :sweat_smile:

anyway, results:

finally the worst looking part of the rear enclosure - with it sitting flush, its really not bad, in reality all irregularities will be in the motors and boards shadow anyway.

one is still running my vanguard, the other had this weird noise and when I disassembled it one of thebearings did that sound. wanted to replace these bearing with ceramics for weatherproofing (and coat windings to rwduce noise), but I havent done that yet! the bearings were stuck in really hard and I definitely would need a hammer and some bolt to hammer them out. reluctant atm :p 

the old rspecs are still from my very first build - the dual rear topspeed! :slight_smile:

board was still a little on the soft side, so I added a carbonlayer ontop to seal the routed wire channels & enclosure threads.

LHB style motor wire channels. the motor side had the wires a little tight on my vanguard, but with wire exits on opposite side they are a lot more relaxed:

downside of a topmount non-bottlenose is of course wheelbite unless you press in wheel wells. I couldve gone the giant riser route or sand in wells which I wasnt sure how to do yet since I dont really have any cool drum sander or anything alike ... until I realized that I had the perfect drum sander: my wheels! :stuck_out_tongue:

thanks to the awesome supportpin, you can use the ronins without bushings at all and still have an absolute precise idea of where the wheel will be under load with bushings: just where they are without bushings and without load :smile:

so I used double adhesive tape on my 90mm abecs (cause i want to use 90mm wheels once the trampas become avilable)

today I filed down the support pin cast part of my ronins to get the motor as close to the board AND as close to the truck axle as possible. thought Ill file down only a part of it to give you a feeling of how much material you can take off the truck. didnt dare to go much further cause I expected to see the support pin plastic cup any second. if you dare to go further, show some pictures! :smile:

changed a few details - coated the wheel wells with black resin because I know how much crap the wheels will throw at the board. also changed all screws with all matte black screws to make them less noticeable. finally, I added 3x 4mm gold connectors with sugru to the rear enclosure for the loop "ignition" key + charging. basically I really just need to add a motor pulley + belt and I could go. Im really proud, its by far the best looking board Ive ever built up. :nerd:

quick question :D I have the same setup as you for spot welding. We might even have the same car/motorcycle battery charger. Does yours output 12v/6v and 9 Amps ? Not that it matters since we use the power cap for discharge... Does your battery charger also have a slot for the fuse ? If so, what fuse are you using ? I have 30A fuses here but they burn through after a couple welds...

board is ready since a while, got my first 50km on it already, tonight I ran my first longer test since i was in ski holidays before. actually it snowed all day, but its so cold that the snow covers the road like dust, can actually ride over it quite well and behind me its a white whirl. :smiley:

really REALLY happy with how the board has turned out. it feels lighter and more agile/playful than my vanguard ... mostly thanks to the shorter wheelbase I guess. I also love that the board is wider, its perfect for my feet and from the change bottle nose -> round snowboard topmount shape, there is more flexibility for your stance and much more room for "dancing". flex turned out simply perfect for my weight, carving is pure joy. been tinkering long enough with it - final version is now:

200g/m^2 carbon twill
2mm bamboo
400gr/m^2 glas
2mm bamboo
400gr/m^2 glas
2mm bamboo
400gr/m^2 glas
2mm bamboo
400gr/m^2 glas
2mm bamboo
200g/m^2 carbon twill

routed channels for battery and motor wires
2mm inserted electric compartments

its thicker than the original vanguard - but the flex is still very similar, because my board has slightly less concave. what I also like is, that the board is dead silent. the perfect enclosure fit really pays off to be honest.

actually I didnt weight it, but its not a lightweight. feels about as heavy as the original flex2 vanguard. think my deck is even a bit thicker, but flex is similar because I got a little less concave.

yea, my vanguard was blank anyway, because there were a lot of routed cables on the top surface. vibration grinder with 80grit makes VERY quick work of the original spray on grip. ;)

maidens ride last week on 83s 76A trampa stickies, now switched to 90mm 76A stickies and made around 50km already. superstoked about the wheels, never had a more silent and smoother ride feeling than with these new 90s! just super comfy, even better than my 90mm 75A abecs which so far set the bar for me!

about motors: on my diy board im running an old 6355 rspec, on my vanguard I ran one of those APS closed 6355 motors. got a direct comparison for the first time, back to back, and I like the rspec a lot better. both motors in foc mode, both on german vescs, uthe rspec is much more silent, especially at max rpm where the closed aps motor was screaming like a little girl. perfectly suits the carving cruise character of the flexy board and the great wheels.

max gps speed: 51kph and absolutely no sign of speed wobbles even though the board is about as flexy as my flex 2 vanguard and all that with a shorter wheelbase! thank you ronins :heart_eyes:

search for "rampa muffe" on ebay, there are plenty types to choose one. Im using M4 8x8mm, choose the length by how you plan to use them. if you drill a hole in your board and stick them through, you can just use 10mm length, if you just drill a partial hole, 8mm length is probably better.

Beautiful as always @whitepony!

You mentioned on several occasions that you're using a simple loop-key for turning it on and off.

Are you using an XT90-S? 

Could you possibly take a photo of your implementation of the loop key in your enclosures?

Thanks!

ill take a foto from the outside when im home from business travels.

its a simple male-male 4mm bullet connector loop key and its sparking nicely. i went back to this kind of on/off after I had a melted xt90 and an electronic powerswitch stopped working in on-mode, nearly killing my battery!

No worries! 

I was debating whether or not I should get an anti-spark switch or if I should just go the loop key route. Looks like a switch would be a more elegant solution although more expensive and more prone to failure as you've experienced :frowning:

My twill has arrived, borrowed a vacuum pump from a friend, new mold is ready.....
Can you tell me, how much epoxy ratio to cloth do you use? I have read equal weight epoxy to cloth and also read just to coat the cloth evenly. Do you go by feel or measurement? I used equal weight epoxy to cloth this time.

22 hours to wait. 1 layer fibreglass 1 layer regular carbon 2 layers twill

I usually use "enough", soaking everything heavily, excess resin is pressed through bleeder layer into the soaking material anyway! looking at your soaking material it looks as if its not really getting a lot of resin, so I guess you couldve used a little more to be save! youll see the next day :slight_smile:

awh :worried: how did you make the mold? I used the hardest foam that was available and for my latest enclosures I used MDF wood which is very strong, but still quite easy to shape. atmospheric pressure is STRONG, 9.5tons of pressure per square meter if you have a good pump!

I used plaster of paris, toward the stronger spectrum of water to plaster mix-found a cool tupperware container that fit the cells as per your build, but a vacuum pump running continuously is so powerful.
I will try again. and again. Was a little dry I think more epoxy is needed.
Also I think I should use MDF - terrible to unwrap a present to find this.

Still usable - will see how the next one turns out - will turn the pump off after I pull a decent vacuum.

after a week with the trampa I switched to my DIY deck today for some urethane carving and woah, one week nearly made me forget how absolutely perfect this deck is - every detail is spot on. perfect flex, perfect trucks, perfect bushings, good old kegels which are great for this kind of excellent pavement. :hugging:

I recently reworked the deck slightly because, for the first time ever, the top carbon layer came off in a few places - really weird. I was able to peel the carbon right off with the grip tape - never saw anything like it before:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/a/bad73b5302e97708f4375004934d45f6847a21bd.jpg" width="690" height="498">


I gave it a very thorough rough sanding and took it as an opportunity to replace the 200gr/m^2 carbon with 400gr/m^2 fiber glas for an improved reception and minimally harder flex. it has bonded strongly as always now, inseparable. really not sure what went wrong with the carbon back then. the reception is really improved with the glas. I had the problem before that I wasnt able to keep the mini remote in my pocket, kept having dropouts like that. now I can keep it just about anywhere without any reception issues. :relaxed:


decided to upload a short video I made with my phone, so you get an idea why I build the boards the way I build them. every detail is made for the endless carve with my favoured carving frequency. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZfjyCLBaMQ

if you switch to slow motion, you can see very well the compression for a turn, decompression after a turn and taking the free energy right into the next turn. the carving frequency is pretty much determined by the flex of the board. if you remember my flex test videos: the natural swinging frequency is very similar to the perfect carving frequency - basically you will ride in tune with the natural frequency of the board for the best energy returns in the right moment. its highly addicting :blush:

Do you think it would be possible to make a drop down deck using your method or would the (1inch) drops be to much of a hassle?
```

i dont really see the point of a dropdown unless you want to push your board? for carving, a deck that got your feet too close to the road feels somewhat "shallow", not sure how to explain it better. 

firstly, you loose board flex travel and might bottom it out or your heel/foottips might touch the road. 

more importantly, the higher your feet are from the trucks, the more leverage you get over the truck and the easier leaning in gets - its feels more like balancing a rope, much livlier experience compared to low decks.

ultimately, this offset feet<->truck pivot point determines how much force is transferred to the outer wheel while carving - with a sharp lipped outer wheel, a large offset adds a lot of pressure and in return adds a lot of traction. its the "top moints have more traction, drop through slide easier" consensus in the longboard world. thats why you see only super high slalom boards - always top mount, often with high risers.

but if you rearmount the motors or start the drop after the motor sure, its possible. from a carving perspective: not optimal!

I was referring to making a custom deck based on a existing model like you did with the vanguard. I have drop deck with 1 inch drop already and have the motors rear mounted. I like the drop but there is things I would change like the flex. It was just a thought, it's probably to complicated.

I currently have older rayne nemesis. It's has to much concave stock and heavy. I have been looking at treehunters deck also, but it would be nice to make a custom one

Ground clearance​ hasn't been an issue with 100mm wheels and 1/4 shock pad. I just want tiny bit more flex. I had routed the deck for wires and it was to flexy​ so I put two fiberglass layers on top, I should have put one. Maybe I can just route for flex but I'm worried it will be to weak structurally.

@whitepony Simon do you any tips working with the rampa muffs ? I figured the ones with the allen insert are higher quality. I have mounted them on my vanguard but I couldn't for f**ks sake get them in straight... :pensive:
I have an icarus on my way which I'll want to convert my current setup to. I don't want to mess up the deck too much when trying to screw in the inserts.  

I've read that you also have the icarus in your collection which you are using as a push board. Would you say its possible to mount a single 6374 under the deck(mby topmount?) ? Or should I have the mounts faced to the back just like evolve does.

EDIT:// would you say a split enclosures is required for the icarus ?

icarus is probably not the easiest board to electrify. its a very thin deck and the mountable area is really small. its probably really hard to do split enclosures on the deck. but killing the flex of the icarus makes the deck nearly pointless. maybe slitted one piece enclosures like @trampa showed in their official trampa build thread are a possibility for the icarus.

about the inserts: testdrill holes in some random piece of wood - it may not be too small so that the wood splits, but also not too wide that the insert is too loose. use some epoxy glue, drip one drop into the drilled hole, use a torx or allen screw + washer screwed into the insert and drill in the inserts with that screw and a well fitting electric drill bit.

i got one post about inserts in my latest trampa build thread: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/segmented-carbon-flex-enclosure-for-trampa-urban-carver/20067/32?u=whitepony

Well, I'll check once it arrives if I can mount my 10s4p enclosures there. I might just send it back if its too hard to electrify.

Thats what I've been doing ! Maybe my senses are crooked which is leading to crooked holes... :sweat_smile: Taking note of the epoxy glue drip tho. These inserts tend to unscrew with the screw all the time.

i only mounted stuff underneath a deck in all my builds (for stealth) - in theory there isnt a problem, but it reduces the space for your enclosure.

seems like the new motor from @fottaz got an issue now after about 500km. the shell with the magnets got loose off its baseplate - can see that in the foto by looking at the lack of an airgap at pulleyside and the small gap between baseplate and magnet shell:

luckily I had an 6374sk3 in my treasure box, silicone wire modded it and set up new foc detection - works likea charme. should probably stick to those. my sk3 168kv was the best motor I ran so far. :slight_smile:

board is holding up so well, been riding 20km every day since weeks now, even through rain. the enclosures sealed with neoprene tape between lid and board are really more than just splash proof. ran through really wet roads one day, so much spray that got me completely soaked .. but the electronics were completely dry!

Im not sure what my vesc did differently, but the FOC parameters on my 190kv 6374SK3 seem to be MUCH better compared to my 168KV 6374 back then on my vanguard. the motor is MUCH more silent under heavy load and particularly at high rpms where I had some form of screaming sound once rpms were close to top speed. its one of the smoothest, strongest and most silent motors I ever used so far, really a game changer for the board, because it was lacking some torque with the 6355 230KV motor. 
also the startup is extremely smooth. on most motors, they have issues to start up without load with the board on the bench. the sk3 just starts up right away and the slightest remote signal.

must say, Im super happy with the sk3. :heart_eyes:

p.s.: they are actually available @ hobbyking eu right now woah, thats pretty rare! :fearful:

it was kinda funny how it happened - carved down this pretty rough tiled sidewalk with in ear phones, suddenly the board brakes really hard as if i dragged a big stone with me, then it was fine again, then suddenly again heavy braking and scraping, then it stopped again, but I wanted to check anyway and stopped. turns out the motor made it through the truck somehow and was finally dangling on its phase wires behind the board on the road.

its crazy how I didnt notice whats going on due to my headphones. 

the mount just broke though, no impact, nothing. just rough sidewalk and heavy sk6374y :neutral_face:

hm, so after riding probably around 800km with my DIY board it got softer and softer until its finally now too soft in my eyes - the energy returns dont feel as vivid anymore. now sure why that happened ... probably laminate bit my bit delaminating? I realized I should have probably roughened up the bamboo veneers with coarse grit before using epoxy to press them together. :confused:

anyway, Im just took my DIY board ronin + sk6374 + 90mm stickies combo to my vanguard and man, its such a carving machine. love the longer wheelbase and the energy returns feel very fresh and nice on the vanguard flex2, especially coming from my slowly decaying DIY board. and thats even though the vanguard has WAYYY more kilometers on its back. rode it really long and hard last year. guess the loaded guys really know what they are doing ;)

stickies are coning nicely by now, adds a lot of extra grip. today was sunny, hot tar and Ive never carved harder I think. had way more grip compared to march where I bought the stickies.

carbon isnt a bad idea - its probably much better suited to withstand vibrations over a longer time. hmm :thinking:

uhhh, what is this?! a most likely **indestructible ronin truck mount with idler pulley** by @nowind https://www.e-toxx.com ?!? fuck yea :grinning:

full set with idler, belt and jens patented mount grub screw adapter that also fits ronin trucks! no immediately obvious aluminium bridges where you can expect breaking like on the APS mounts. aluminium has a perfect milled finish and is really thick!! and incase you missed it: RONINS! :sweat_smile:

I like the thick aliminium motor guard a lot - 2 of my motors were killed by an impact that bent the outer motor shell where the magnets are fixated!

back to back comparison with my last APS mount after I killed 2 within 3 months now. @nowind mount is made to last, thats for sure!!

Been waiting for those since @nowind first showed pics of it here. But I prefer my Liquid Fyre trucks over my Ronins...and I wonder if these mounts will fit onto those trucks (with minor mods and/or sugru if needed).

That...and these won't fit 50XX motors D:!

think they fit quite generically ... all the mount needs is 2 flat surfaces. jens sent me a slightly adapted ronin truck with the mount!

I never thought about ever using less than 63mm, so thats not really a big deal for me. the downside of generic mount screws is the APS X that broke my mount twice now! ;)

Luckily, the Liquid trucks are square all around, so plenty of flat surfaces to be found :smiley:!
And I measured my Ronins to the Liquids and it's about the same, so I think they'll work...might need to do a little sugru filling in or filing down, but it'll work!

I was aiming for 50XX motors since I'm not all that heavy and (for now) I live in a pretty flat area with barely any hills. And I was going for a more lightweight build, since 63XX motors are about double the weight (on average).

And I'm assuming you're beta testing these for Jenso. Keep us updated on how they hold up please and thank you :smiley:!

There's no thread. @nowind has posted pics of them though in the pics only thread. He's been testing them for a little while now but hasn't put them on the market yet.

@fottaz also has some pics of Jenso's build with these on his facebook, because Jenso used his enclosure :smiley:.

Thanks @fottaz for extrem good and fast delievery 

@whitepony will do some testing... he is the right guy after killing 2 mounts in 3 month (-;

Got no clue about the price (-;
Dont thought about really...
But normaly my parts are not for the budget builds...

Thx

Ronins are not really for budget builds. $200 a set in my country.
A lot of people will be wondering - how much !
Do you think you would be able to mount 2 for a dual drive ?SK3  6354

cast ronins, not precision ronins! cast ronins are nearly as cheap as caliber/paris while providing a MUCH better ride. set of cast ronins is 90€ in germany!

No @Jebe is actually referring to the cast ronins. Even the cheaper cast ronin variant is very expensive here in Australia. Hard to find and they are usually almost double the price of Caliber II's :frowning:

yea, Ill test the mount now with 6374 single for the rest of the year (guess thats the biggest load you can throw at a mount) and for next year Im planning a long eboard roadtrip with a really large battery and dual motor for redundancy! :slight_smile:

 It's worth even playing with, really appropriate to the e-ride IMO (in view of our setup)

Jenso your mount look GORGEOUS ! Strong and precise like usual !! BiG UP 
This deck is crazy once again ! Enjoy WP - my next build, like always, will be inspired by you !!

hehe, sweet hub setup! think if hubs were offered with ronins, I might be tempted! :smiley:

thinking about a board for long distance europe touring - 60-80cell+ segmented enclosure vanguard (probably not split, but segmented like my trampa setup - but split is still in the room with very large compartments directly at the truck). possibly front and rear diagonal 6374 drive with jensos idler pulley mounts. possibly even completely decoupled front and rear setups for redundancy. one electronic side down, Ill just remove the belt and drive with the remaining single 6374. 

still thinking about many details, but it will be a really sturdy long distance tourer with lots of overengineering and probably even a BMS. :astonished:

love the idler, cant wait to test it. used the belt fairly loose and idler on the non stressed side. also love the motor aluminium guard :slight_smile:

You already got plenty of details, and I like it soooo ...
bamboo deck with green FW + black truck and carbone enclore ... some chrome details on truck according to the mount ... your motor wiring is gorgeous ... so ... WHAT A DECK !!! Like wine it improves with time :blush:
Like that the base mount fully protect the crown/belt.
BMS ? Smart BMS ? Looking forward to seeing the selected :slight_smile: And 6/80 cell, yummy!

Enjoy & Good ride :sunny:

it feels awesome tbh!! its not a stretcher though, just a fixed wheel to keep more teeth in contact with the belt. i always ran a loose belt which is why they always last forever - but then you skip a few teeth when you brake hard. thats gone now, even though I set up the belt very loose! :slight_smile:

first 40km on the mount and I ran it really hard. the belt grip has changed in a way like making the upgrade form 9mm to 15mm a while ago. its not magic and a loose belt is a loose belt, but it has significantly improved the torque transfer. people who made the 9->15mm transition will know what I mean! idler pulley yay, good concept that doesnt add extra noise nor extra friction or anything. basically only positives, no negatives! :smiley:

one thing that I really noticed on that run: the heat conduction is phenomenal! my motor was quite hot, the mount was really warm, the truck was really warm. thats something that didnt work too well with my aluminium cylinder epoxy trick. actually the heat transfer mount->truck is better than anything Ive encountered before. I blame the 2 large connecting patches that have a real precision fit:

been using the mount since 14 days pretty much daily, each day for 20-30km now. it really invites for nowind'esque full throttle abuse cause the idler allows reliable full sk3 6374 torque transfer and Im not afraid of bumps and cracks anymore with the solid impression the mount makes! :heart_eyes:

it even saved my motor from impact once already :grinning:

I'm very interested in these mounts.

I will seriously consider buying a set if I could ever get a pair of 200mm liquid fyres. (I go after 200mm, not less so Ronins is out)

How thick is the mount, asking so I can work out how long the motor shaft will need to be to accommodate a 15mm wide pulley.

Hey @whitepony , I will be routing a loaded vanguard 42" flex 2 for my build as well, 2 channels between the battery and ESC enclosures. I'm looking at 10 gauge silicon wire and they are 5.5mm in diameter. That seems like it would be a really deep channel and might make the deck too weak. Do you have any advice?

What kind of resin did you use to attach the veneer? I have 3m Bondo All Purpose Resin for fiberglass, does it need to be some kind of flexible resin? Really worried about putting some epoxy on the board that will make it either too stiff or crack.
