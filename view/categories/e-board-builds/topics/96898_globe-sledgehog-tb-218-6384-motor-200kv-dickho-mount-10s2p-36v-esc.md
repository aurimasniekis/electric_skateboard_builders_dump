Wondering if the following would be a good set of parts for my first build. I already have a Globe Sledgehog board with the wider torqueboard trucks, along with 100mm mbs offroad wheels. I am mainly concerned with the battery output being a good match with the motor size and kv. I don't want to be pulling to many amps if possible because of the budget esc. I was going to use the wowgo/ownboard cases for mounting everything. Thanks for the feedback!

Not suggest to buy this pulley, go to find 5M36T and 5M12T pulley is better

Why 36 and 12? Isn't 16 and 48 also a 1:3 ratio?

I'd suggest getting wheel pulley + motor pulley from @dickyho too (same vendor as the motor mount + motors + esc). 

Highly suggest avoiding that battery. Super underwhelming + potentially unsafe. You're better off going for a better (maybe bigger) battery and a VESC.
