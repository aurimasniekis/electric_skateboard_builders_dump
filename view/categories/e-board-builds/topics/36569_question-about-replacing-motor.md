Soo I bought a single conversion kit from MIB miami electric boards and it 
came with a 12S2P battery a vesc and an uncensored 250 KV motor. I've read that with a 12S battery Its better with a motor with a bit lower KV, like maby 170 - 200. Can I just buy a new censored 170 KV motor and replace it without changing the VESC settings? Or is it more to it?

Sorry for any bad spelling, English is not my first language.

You'll have to run motor detection after you switch motors. Other than that the settings will probably be fine.
