So I am new to this Forum and this is my second build but first time posting .  I am posting to enter my build to  Enertion 2.1 drive system contest build.  I hope you guys can give me feed back and not beat me up to badly .  I also hope the build really show cases the contest rules and maybe bends a few of them .  

OK so first off, this build was Sponsored by my work , to be more specific Mattel..Hotwheels Group .  Yeah Hotwheel as in thee die cast cars most of you grew up with .   I wanted to start off with the names of the people who helped make this board build possible .  Micheal Kadile (ME) hahah, Riki Yoshida , Sam Tsui, Kevin Cao, Jim Highwart, Rex Hidalgo, Chris Downs, Rafael Bencosme and Cesar Correa(the guy that got me into Eboards) . 

 We wanted to attack this build with a innovation heavy theme rather than just a use of the motors on a board build .  Like just slapping the awesome enertion 2.1 motors on a deck and making a build .  I knew from my previous builds that wider was better also lower for more stability.   So making some major changes to the 2.1 trucks required a redo on the stock hangers.

As you can see we widen the stock truck to make a 2" difference per side.  In the pics above we just showed the rear ones being made and assembled.  I will post pics of the front trucks later . 


Another thing that I was interested was increasing over all distance with the battery .  We decided to add some solar panels to the top of the deck .  This was a major pain in the ASS!!  The deck choice for this was the TRAMPA's ORRSOM Longboard 985mm tip to tip Concave .  I choose the 15 layer deck for the build .  Now i say pain in the ass because if you know what material TRAMPA decks are made of and have ever drilled in or machined them ....yeah that stuff is like fiber glass .  Itch town 5000!!! Cover up and wear gloves .   So we got solar cells and I routed out the top deck to accommodate the panels.  The other guys where figuring out how to wire in the converter and reconfig it so that it would fit inside the Trampa lower tray.  You can see what we got and the specs .   I can go into detail later on the overall assembly but it wasn't that hard just the deck prep was the most time consuming .   Finding the right size solar cell was also an issue and ones you could stand on as well was challenge .   You can see in the pics below what we found and used .

Finding room in the tray for all the components  wasn't that hard .  The new UNITY VESC was vital to saving room .  The new vesc made it easy to drop in the BMS, a 12s4p Samsung 30q battery pack, GPS tracking, flight controller custom board , voltage reader , and xt90 -xt60 connectors.  So Thanks again Enertion for the new designed Unity VESC.  Also motor set up was so fast and easy !!  I would say the longest part of the set up was waiting for my bluetooth to find the Unity VESC.  


The controller ,  here is where I let the other teammates(Riki and Sam) decided how I would control the board. Now just a little back story ... non of these guys ride !!!  SOOOO they decided to make me a POWER GLOVE style controller.  I know that this isn't as much as a new way to control throttle and definitely not the best way, but why not try it .   First time controlling this build with he glove style controller was needless to say.... SCARY AS HELL!!!  It was finicky and unnatural .  I would say that this would be something that would require a little more tuning and thought.   I put a Enertion NANO controller in after that first couple rides just to make sure I wouldn't break another arm and shoulder again.  We used a flight controller as well for the radio in conjuction witht he power glove style controller ..  There are some great options that you can tap into when you use a flight controller.  Some feature that we added to the board where , onboard GPS Tracking , heads up display unit w/info, speed monitoring , voltage monitoring , and signal strength.  Like i said ...I did switch to the nano controller and we are trying to refine the final way we will control the board .  I also mounted the Head Up Display to my helmet .  Its kinda chunky but it does work ...I can see all the things that I stated above by looking through that lens . No need to look at my phone or controller for speed or battery voltage .

This far into the build I asked my friend and co-worker Kevin Cao designer on HotWheels to put some design aspect to the board build . He designed the rear Kick Tail that doubles as a drag handle . The hex grip tape and HotWheels trim was made by Rafael Bencosme   I think with more time I would have also liked to add a side retractable handle for carrying it.  I will say this board isn't light .  I would say that it comes in at about 25lb .   So the drag handle make it a little better than actually carrying it .   Anyways here is the end results .  Hope you guys like it ...it was alot of fun putting this together .  My hope in the end is to possibly make another board with some more innovative parts and possible wheel interchangeability.   Enjoy and good luck to the other contestants .

For got to add what the solar Cells provided in real world testing .   So its not like ride it on solar power...hell there isn't a car you can buy that does either.   BUT...what we got out of the 7 solar panels is that you can get a mile for every hour that the board sits in direct sun.  So if you where to travel 3 mile and hang out at the beach for 3 hours you would get your ride back .  That also means no plugging in that's just on solar regeneration.  Now I live off the strand in Redondo Beach CA.  Its flat ..adding hill to the equation will change the amount and time to regen.   Also clouds ...big factor , sunny CA is very beneficial for this board build .  If you leave the board in the sun or out on your deck or porch it would take  30 hours to charge fully from 10% .  So it helps ..not a 100% change in the way we regen but it does help with getting back some juice .

This board is long ... but the wider trucks really make the difference . because I clear the deck at the extremes and there is not bottoming out .  I make some pretty tight turns .  The new Enertion motors are damn powerful so moving a heavy thing like this isn't really an issue.  I will say we looked at the build not as a Electric Skate board but more as a replacement vehicle.  This could replace a car for those 25-30mile commute.  The weight added a good feeling of stability at higher speeds .  I would like to get the weight down but with the stability might be compromised.

not sure yet.... the board is only 2 days old.  lol  I built another board with the 2.0 motors and 30q's and got real world solid with hills 28 miles.  I mean hills that where 25-30 degree at most.  I also had a climb daily a 30 degree hill that was a 3/4 mile long.  If it was flat and no wind ... easy 30 -35 miles.

Have you considered putting the solar panels under the board?  To charge it, just flip the board over.     IMO, you're losing efficiency with the grip tape and your feet/shadow covering the panels while you ride.

What a rad build! This competition is getting better and better. Truck hangers, solar panels, HUD, kicktail... awesome. I'd like to see a FPV video of the HUD while riding. Very cool.

Very interesting real world feedback on the solar PV charging. Those multi directional panels are pretty cool. Do you know what kind of heat build up the cells/electronics would be subjected to if the board was left in the sun for a few hours to charge? Is there any thermal break between the panels/deck and the electronics? That would be my only concern. 

On the flip side, in regards to increasing solar charging potential, do you think one of those solar cooker/tanning reflectors could speed up the process to say, 1 mile per solar hour (mpsh)? If be interested in seeing the results from that test. This is what I'm talking about:

I want a kick tail like that for my hummie deck!

Somebody make two for me. 

Is the kick tail strong enough to kick flip the board or is it just aesthetics?

I wouldn’t actually be able to use it though with my motors hmm. 

That deck looks great. Really nice looking build and diy work. 

I didn’t know trampa had this kind of style deck.

considered that actually ...but I we were going for as much sun all the time even when you ride.  The solar panels aren't giving you much even when in the sun without being on it .  What the idea is here was range extending .  Not that it will do it fast but its there as a back up and regenerating while its sits out on a sunny day.  More improvements need to come in solar tech to really achieve  good voltage from such few panels.  Maybe putting glass ones under could give you better results but I worry about speed bumps rocks and random junk kicking into those fragile cells.

It’s actually a cheap FPV camera and the lens is nothing more that some acrylic with some mirror film .  Not as expensive as you would think.  My co-worker Riki came up with the idea and it really isn’t that $$.

My friend Riki Yoshida is the master mind behind that .  He used a GPS unit for a quard rotor build .  Paired with a flight controller And radio you can actually get good tracking .  It would be great for mapping rides , theft location, and accurate speed tracking .

I actually gave that some thought before making these truck.  I built this not to compete with Enertion.  I made them as a inspiration piece and pushed there already unique design .  If I was to make these trucks they wouldn’t  look like this .  I would completely redesign them so they could accept there motors and look at other ways to pull heat from the motors other than there design .

The trucks that were designed for the contest are not for sale .  They are a one off concept with the hopes to inspire .  Sorry . But thanks for the love !!

The amount of heat that the solar cells are generating on the convert isn’t much .  It actually came with a heat sink for the converter .  I will drop some numbers on this chain to show you what I am actually getting in voltage and heat .  As far as the panels go they can be trimmed up on the ends so the gapping between each cell is minimum.  I have 7 panels total on the top deck and the 1mile per hour back charging rate is due to that number of panels .  It is possible for you to get better regen if you where to add the full amount which was at first 10 panels .  But i had only room for 7 trimmed ones. I would love to see if those mirrors would help ...interesting concept .

Awesome build so far! looks super clean ;P

Can I recommend that you avoid putting stuff like that on your helmet. If you fall it may do more harm than you think.

I totally agree with you on that safety note.  I used to ride with a go pro on my motorcycle helmet and not anymore after I low sided and that camera mount almost broke my neck .  This was just to show what else we integrated into the deck build .  I don’t think this part of the build is 100% , we are looking on making the unit much smaller. Thanks for the input though!

Seems like a lot of distractions.

All you need to have all these features and open source that works in almost any helmet would be google glass

H @mikeg60d, this build is insane. You and your team have materialized an idea I've played with since 2016. I am currently a final year mechanical engineering student, and my final year project is a solar powered electric longboard. 

I am in the literature study phase of the project, and from knowing a bit of background of solar energy and battery tech, you guys have done something amazing in such a compact form factor. 

Is there a way I can come into contact with you when I progress with my build? I would love your inputs.

Thanks a lot, 
Jaco :grinning:

Any chance we can see a link to download that cnc file for the hangers? Wider trucks would really help get that perfect carve and lower my blood pressure.

your "second" build is absolutely insane. mad skillz mate

noob question though... I have a similar battery readout device I want to install on my board but im not certain where to connect the wires to.

If I connect it directly to the main power leads wont it be on constantly??

you can splice connect the wires to the output of your antispark switch (the one that goes to vesc) or to one of the vesc cables, (+) & (-) obviously.

I need a picture of what your trying to do.  If your trying to get a battery read out and you have a UNITY VESC , then it’s super easy.  But if you don’t I need to see what you are trying to do.

I got another male 2mm jst and plugged it into the aux port on the unity. It’s working like a charm now 👌🏼👌🏼
