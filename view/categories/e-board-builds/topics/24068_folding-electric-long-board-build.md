Hello All!

Happy to be a new member! I am completely new at this. Long time admirer, first time builder. I am pretty handy mechanically, but lack the knowledge and understanding of the electronic components. I was hoping I could post what I would like the outcome of my build to be, and you fine people could help guide me in the right direction as far as components. I apologize, in advance, for the length of this and my esk8 ignorance lol. Thanks for the help!

Deck: 
I am going to use the deck from Board Up. It folds in half for fantastic portability. (Important feature to me). Because of this, the components will have to be separated into 2 separate enclosures. 1 front 1 back (think boosted board). The front section of the board has about 10inches of available length and 7inches width for the battery. The rear has about 7inches of length and width for the rest of the electronics. I would like to keep these fairly thin since, when folded, they will be touching one another. 

Motors:
I want a dual motor setup. Where I will be riding will be about 70% flat and 30% hills. I don't want to have any worry about climbing hills, and I want good braking. These are the main reasons for the dual setup as opposed to single. Speed is always welcome, but I would be happy with anything 20mph and up. Not looking to break records. Motor Suggestions? Pulleys and belt suggestions welcome too.

Trucks:
I don't think the trucks that come with the deck will work. Was thinking about using the Enertion narrow hangar trucks. Thoughts?

Wheels:
This is probably a stupid question. Are there wheels out there, made of rubber, or possibly pneumatic, that are a happy medium between an 80mm street wheel and a large 5 or 7 inch all terrain wheel? Would love some bump absorption and noise dampening. All terrains are just too big to be portable though. 

Battery:
Ok. This is all very confusing to me. I want Li-ion setup with built in BMS. Since portability is a huge need, I want to be able to just grab a standard wall charger, throw it in a backpack, and go. No balancing or special chargers. Building a pack, on my own, really isn't an option. 

I would like a range of 15miles, give or take. Crazy acceleration isnt paramount, and as long as 20mph + is in the cards Im happy. Torque for hills (not crazy steep) is important. 

The battery has to fit within the physical dimensions of the board as well. 10 inches long by about 7 inches wide. 

VESC:
Looking at the VESC-X controllers from Enertion. Thoughts? Cheaper, same features/quality options?

Remote:
Looking at Nano-X from Enertion also. Thoughts? Alternate options?

I know this is long, so thanks if you stuck through the whole thing. I am assuming some motors may or may not come with mounting hardware, pulleys, belts etc. I'm not so worried about that if not. I think there are a lot of options out there. VERY MUCH APPRECIATED!

Looking into hub motors might be a great option for you so that it can be easily foldable for you and you won't have to worry about bellts and stuff. There are tons of people on the forum that are willing to make a battery for you and I have seen the battery in Miami electric boards (12s2p) not sure if it has a BMs but looks awesome what is your budget?

The board looks great but worried that if there is the slightest bit of fold in the board, it will push the board more folded (if you go forwards on back wheel drive and backwards on front wheel drive).

Thanks for the reply! Do hub motors limit the wheel options available? Are you kind of limited to whatever wheels fit the motor? Main reason I was looking into the external motors was the ability to pretty much put whatever wheels I wanted on  without changing motors. Of course, pulleys, belts and gearing would have to be adjusted/changed, but not motors. Budget wise, I am honestly not sure. trying to get an idea of over all cost for this setup.

Are you saying you would be worried the board could fold by accident? I'm not TOO concerned there. It seems to have a pretty solid hinge/locking mechanism. Also, since it folds in the direction it does, the likely hood of it folding while standing on it, even if the hinge lock fails, seems like it would be pretty low.

I am worried about it turning into a hill shape when the hinge is not locked (don't know how/ if there is a locking mechanism). But I suppose you have to test it to find out!

lol yes that wouldn't be good. It does, however, have a locking mechanism. You release the lock with your foot by pressing down on the lever, on the front tip of the board, once stopped.

Even though the hub motors would give it a much cleaner look and require less maintenance and parts, I think I still would like to stick with a non hub system since it allows for more customization options.

The board can be seen on goboardup.com (I assume it is this one). USD 200 a piece, it is not cheap, especially if you plan to replace the trucks and the wheels. But the concept is interesting.
The question I have about your dual enclosures is how you plan to run the cable(s) between the two halfs. There seems to be a shorter half, and it looks like it is the rear one, otherwise you could have thought of squizzing everything on one half.
You could potentially still do it with Lipos, but i doubt you will reach the range you expect.

I know it's not the cheapest deck, but given its capabilities, I think it might be worth it. As far as running cables and enclosures. The front section of the board is about 10" x 8". Possibly slightly longer as the board narrows towards the top. I am currently looking at a 10s3p Li-ion BMS pack from @barajabali. According to the dimensions on the site, it measures in just over 10" x 5". If I were to use that battery, or one like it, there would be no room for anything else on that "half" of the board. I wouldn't need much room in the rear of the board (it measures in at about 8" x 8") just to house the Vesc(s) and BT receiver. I was thinking of just extending the wiring coming out of the battery pack to reach the Vesc(s) in the back, and wrapping it with some sort of high strength, protective, braided nylon or something. Thoughts?

Yea, I think I am going to stay away from Hub motors for the simple reason of being able to change wheels and essentially put whatever I want on there. I could go from 70mm to 7inch all terrains and just change the gearing as opposed to motors. The probability of that happening is low, but I would feel better knowing I have the option.

The problem I see is that the wire will be straight when the board is unfolded (open), and as you say if they are protected and guided with some plastic holders along the way it should be ok, but when you fold the board there will be an extra length of wire you will have to deal with.
The other problem is that the wires may not like to be bent regurly at the same point and could brake after a while.

This is true. I don't really see that as much of a problem though. Definitely something to watch out for, but not something that can't be remedied. Many new drones, for example, have arms that unfold and fold constantly. I think its just a matter of finding the best way to do it.

Hello everyone! I DID end up building this board and finished it back in August of 2017. It has been a blast to ride from day one! Works like a charm to this day. There are some things I would change if I were to do it again, but overall its super solid. Enjoy the pics!! @onloop FOCBOX works great! @torqueboards [IMG_7255|666x500](upload://pf5hBheUKEQ1B18RYrRj0CDdmev.JPG)![IMG_7252|375x500](upload://2vyY2GP7SEx0VWz9rmMsgMp6Adj.JPG)![IMG_7715|666x500](upload://9KFG5PgztYpCcGxXoCDza9QQBJv.JPG)![IMG_7254|375x500](upload://6IjOZ0qFyxoIZyJwSElpKkS5uVy.JPG)![IMG_7713|375x500](upload://8R7jD2OuoKtMEnxFbA4ZKtuBnhg.JPG)![IMG_7714|375x500](upload://1Osmzq4k5IX2M4cctMHh1gkZJBL.JPG)

Hinge is actually fantastic. Very strong and solid. Almost no flex. (im about 160lbs for reference)Some slight play in it, but minimal. The kick release works really well too. It's all a bit of a pain to fabricate, but happy I did.

Things I would/will change: 
Deck: Obviously its a drop through deck. Not ideal. All I could find with the right dimensions at the time. A slightly shorter kicktail deck would be ideal. Around the 37" Mark. The current one is 40"

Motor(s): Let me start by saying I have no problem with this motor at all. Really strong, gets up every hill no problem. But, Once hub motors have the same performance (Or at least raptor 2 like performance) I think they would be the way to go. Much cleaner looking and less to get in the way once folded.

Other than that, I really don't know. This is the only Esk8 I have ever ridden, and maybe the 3rd or 4th skateboard in general I have ever ridden, so I don't have anything to compare it to as far as ride. I am getting over 10 miles per charge, and I clocked myself at 26mph before I chickened out and slowed down. It still had a few more in it for sure.

Nice to enjoy something you made!

I guess if mating to a traditional concaved board which has flex, then it's all down to the hinge which would need to be very special as to work well. No problem with a metal board like a beercan

Flexible boards with a concave don't like hinges, I would be sceptical how this could be done for instance with a vanguard without damaging the deck at the mating area, maybe a hinge like used with glass would be more approriate.

![image|432x402](upload://A0Un5HMiDgZK8okyRnUeJ0nE09u.jpg)

Regular hinge no bueno, maybe two is better
![image|690x131](upload://4gan5I51oYP8Bb3fmQ5uUR5sMvy.jpg)

A two-part enclosure a-la-Vanguard could work with a hinge, the running power lines normally channel into a deck would need to reappear just before and after the hinge with enough length the handle the hinge operation, about teh same as a loop key

They could be kept flush to the bottom of the deck with simple rubber loops which stretch when the hinge is rotated

```
The hinge is actually curved to match a board with a concave deck. It sits completely flush with the deck. When open, you would have no idea there was a hinge at all. It is rock solid as if the board had never been cut in half. It is very robust. More so than a hinge made for a glass shower door.

It also has the locking and unlocking mechanism built in. How would you lock the deck open, and then unlock it to close?
```

The hinge in my pic uses the axis to lock, a two piece attachment makes sense for concave

If the hinge itself is not concave like the board, then yes it would make sense to have two pieces. But if the hinge is concave like the board then it would make more sense to use one large hinge. Here is a top view of the deck and hinge when folded. You can see that both the deck and hinge are concave and come together flush. ![IMG_7738|666x500](upload://zzeoZwERypceDknHYmACcJMeZRC.JPG)

I bought the board and hinge together. I had planned on just attaching my electronics and trucks to the bottom of the deck that comes with Boardup, but the deck ended up being to small to fit everything under. So I had to disassemble the hinge and kick release mechanism, find a different deck, and modify it to fit the hinge and kick plate. If I had gone with a smaller battery, I probably could have used the deck that comes with it.

They are glued on, yes. I just used a razor blade and cut them off, trying to waste as little as possible. There are also tiny little metal pieces screwed to the deck, under the foam, on each corner. The board is notched so they sit flush. They help protect the edges of the board from damage

Hey @VerticalMedia. I'm new to building but been researching for a while. I'm looking to do a similar build to yours. I'd like to keep the board in a standard backpack. That means I'm looking to keep the standard deck so that it's 17" folded and trucks under 180mm. I know I want a single belt motor. Range is not a priority for me. Just wanted to ask you if you had any specific tips or lessons learned along the way during your build. Also, where did you get your enclosures? Thanks for whatever help you can offer.

Sorry in advance if I'm breaking any rules.

For such 'mount-on-top' of deck surface, I wonder a some 'insert' lock would be better, sturdier and smaller resolution   
 
I have been wondering over a concept board in my head for a while now, where I'd try to make use of that kind of 'insert' lock type of a system. So far in my head everything works great, AFAI can tell

Hey man. Sorry for the delay. My biggest issue was the battery because of its size. I am using a 10s3p which wouldn’t fit under the front half of the stock board up deck. If you went with a smaller battery, maybe 10s2p, I would think it should be ok. 

Single out runner motir is fine too, that’s what I have, but I would also just make sure you’ll be able to fit the truck, motor and esc enclosure on the rear portion of the deck.

I made enclosures out of tin (air conditioning ducts). Easy to bend and shape. DON’T DO THIS! It worked great for a year, but eventually the shrink wrap on the battery wore down and the battery terminals made contact with the tin enclosure. Shorted out. Lots of sparks and smoke. Ruined a few cells. Had to have it repaired. All fixed now, but still haven’t made a new enclosure. Plan on 3D printing it once I can figure out how to use Fusion 360 lol. Fiberglass/carbon fiber would be a good alternative as well. Might be able to use some generic enclosures like so many of the ones on the Chinese made boards. Just depends on demensions of your electronics.

I'm using the original deck because it fits into a backpack just right. I'm only using wowgo 10s2p battery with enclosure, which seems to fit fine for the front half of the board. I'm doing a single belt driven board because I don't want the trucks any longer. 

I am having trouble fitting my esc enclosure and motor mount all on the back half of my board. My current plan is to use a shorter motor mount, make my own esc enclosure, and shift the rear trucks further back. The wheels would bump into each other upon folding but I wouldn't be able to fold fully not matter what anyway.

I have an arcboard which has an incredibly compact drive train. I could use that, but I'd rather find a new one so I can still use my arcboard as is. Any thoughts?

I am planning on just deck-swappping the wowgo mini that I currently have, which comes with hub motors (so I wouldn’t have the drive train issue, but only buying those standard Chinese hub-motors isn’t that expensive). But I think building a custom esc case will work well! Do you maybe have some pictures of your current build? Do the battery and esc enclosure touch when you fold the board right now?

Someone already did a meepo deck swap so your deck swap should be no problem.

Instead of lowering the front or back trucks, do think if you were to use bike brake cables to extend the unlocking latch it would give more clearance? If so, then it would be possible to cut the deck lower a bit lower for the hinge and making more room for the battery.

The BoardUp comes with extra cable so I guess you could just join them up and you’re good. But my suggestion is Forget the unlatching mechanism...just cut it off and loop it to finger size. It’s not going work the way the original BoardUp did anyway if you change the length of the board or the weight of it.

What’d you use for the black pads where the two halves meet when the board is unfolded?

Black foam one sided sticky pads off eBay for like $4.  More cosmetic than functional though. Placement of the hinge is a very difficult task to figure out based on closing it, wheel line up and straightness of the tracking of wheels.  Took me two times.

First thought it was neoprene foam strips, but it’s rubber. Somewhat similar to this, not sure of the actual thickness on the board. I check in a bit.

I have a BoardUp too and would have sworn it was closed cell neoprene too. But this stuff looks interesting.

Just cut the originals off and use those. I did that twice.

Plan to switch to the hinge as soon as I swap the deck for my build from 2 years ago
