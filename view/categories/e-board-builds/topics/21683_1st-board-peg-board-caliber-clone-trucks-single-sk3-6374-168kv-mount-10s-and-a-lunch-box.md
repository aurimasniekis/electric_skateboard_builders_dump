Absolutely loved finally getting a ride. It's defo a noob board by some of your standards :) I've clearly saved money in areas. Ordered 2x 5000mah batteries instead of 2x 8000mah by mistake. Note my wood screws into the wheel :) not permenant I promise, need wheels. And I did steal one of my daughters lunch boxes.

I believe you have your motor-mount the wrong way round. The motor is supposed to sit in the recess in the aluminium.

I believe btw that woodscrews are the oldest method of drive mounting that we have so far found, mentioned in the old testament and everything. So considered 'retro'

Nice build!
Love the clean look of the trucks with motor mount on it!
Where did you get the trucks, motormount an pulleys or was it a kind of kit with everything included?
