Hi guys, I have been driving my Evolve Carbon GT with AT tires for over 5 months now as the daily driver with over 1000km of distance. Month ago I wanted to test the current of motor and stalled it after trying for some time it gave a little smoke after that I have randomly stalling motor on right side which is not fun when you ride a board at higher speeds so I finally decided to build my own better board based on Trampa mountainboard parts.

For mechanical parts I will use:
* 35° HOLYPRO TRAMPA Mountainboard Deck
* Vertigo Truck - 12mm Hollow Axles Red
*  Superstar 8" wheels
*  Rachet bindings

For drivetrain parts:
* APS 6384S Sensored Outrunner brushless motor 170KV 4000W
* Custom made CNC machined "direct drive" drivetrain (similar design to Nowind's direct drive)

For electronic parts:
* The planned battery is to have 4 x 6S1P 22Ah 20C packs in 12S2P configuration (I love the distance)
* Custom build double VESC with support for over 200A constant current (Currently in development)


Later on, I plan to make myself all-in-one solution for BMS, ESC and MCU  (for data logging, configuration and etc)
 
Yesterday I have ordered all the mechanical parts, now waiting for direct drive drivetrain to be built.

Today I finally have done some progress with the custom VESC board. It's bit massive...

Mosfets will sit on the bottom side of PCB.

Sadly I would like to work on this more but it's already 3:30 AM and I need to get up early for work tomorrow :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

This sounds so cool!  Can't wait to see where you go with this.  I thought of combining the vescs into a dual board too but I don't have anywhere near the circuit design skills yet required to make that combination haha

@ShutterShock hehe it's not only two vesc on one board but also bit more power handling.

Yesterday I received some electronic parts two dev boards one for the remote and another for main cpu of the board. The tracking number from trampa order says it should arrive today so I am waiting for board parts in the time I am sitting on PBC

So apparently currier was not able to reach my home or etc :cry: I was working on ESC design and went from dual on board to two separates too much struggle to fit everything. The power stage is done. All is left to design control board.

Tried to inflate the tires... One tire is punctured. I guess when building hub it pressed the tire in between... Ech no try out today.

So here how it looks compared to Evolve Carbon GT AT

Are you using a hot air blower or reflow station?  If you're gonna be doing a lot of surface mount soldering, it will save you sooo much time and your connections will be much better.

Solder paste and a hot air blower is the only way I would do it

Now I need to figure how to turn it on and control fan speeds :stuck_out_tongue:

I dont know about fan speeds, but to turn it on you just bridge 2 of the pins on the ATX connector.  The ATX connector should be on the back, but not sure as I cannot identify the power supply.  Look  here...

It's not ATX power supply ;) But yeah idea I have to find a pins which turns it on and pin which accepts analog voltage in for FAN

I think that is an **Eclipse hybrid power and signal connector**.  They are supposed to be the most robust and high life cycle connector available.  Ive never actually seen one in real life, but looks interesting.  Maybe this can help you find the info you are looking for...  https://3o9g5a3i56xc3au70w1rfrdv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/M06U-NC_Eclipse.pdf

No worries, just helping out where I can.  FInding the other side of this connector is probably doable, but will be expensive.  If you can figure out what pins operate the power on/off function I would consider making a connector to bridge those to pins with a rocker switch.  That will save you some money and be more reliable most likely.  I've done the same exact thing with ATX power supplies on multiple occasions.

If you really want to push the 1000W Reaktor i'd suggest using 24V or more to power it. My 650W 12V Dell Server supply can push around 370 Watts on 12V with an ISDT Charger, i will soon switch to two of those power supplies in series. But maybe you can adjust voltage on yours, i know some server supplys can be adjusted to 10V over their nominal voltage.

It's not for reactor :) It's for my BMS reactor is just temporary solution until I finish BMS. Plus I am getting DPS5020 so I can lower voltage for it and still use this power supply.

It's not really oversized. I am looking for 1C charging so 24A, but currently will be limited to 20A as I will be using DPS5020 for CC but in future then I will figure out how to CC at 40A will be doing it for quick charge under 40min :) This power supply has way higher efficiency in comparison I guess 80 plus platinum level and it cost only 39€.

About the motor mounts they there waiting for new CNC machine to arrive, as it arrived several days ago I guess next week then I will be back for holidays they will be done by then.

I have been riding my board every day for like 12km to get used to handling it as it feels completely different from my old board. I would like to go further but its really cold here and my feets even in winter boots get cold pretty soon :)

Yesterday, I had a problem, in the middle of my route I started hearing the strange sound from gearbox my first thought was something came loose, so I turned around and was going back home on really slow pace to not damage until 4km until home I heard a loud noise and one wheel completely blocked, but it wasn't blocked as fully blocked it could sping like 90% of its turn and then something was bloking the gear so I had to lifet back side (the heaviest side) and pull it back home on feet was not much fun :D

After taking apart, I found out that set screw on motor gear was loose and another one went missing I was searching for it inside the box but couldn't find it until I picked everything apart and found it stuck inside the gear...

Minimal wear on the case, the scratches on the big hole was because of miss aligned fitting of the gearbox on the truck, and small because gear came lose and slid on the keyway.

Just your mudguards should (maybe) be on the other side of the wheels (at 2h instead of 10h on the profil photo). To protect you, the rider and not the road back at you ;)

Hi, guys sorry for the lack of updates. After coming back I put all my resources into finding an apartment and moving it so after settling in I am returning back to work. Today I received the new inner gear direct drive train and swapped my old gearbox with this one.

The gears after 600km look pretty decent as they there running without any lube or etc.

Went for a small ride because it was raining hard as *** so first impression 10x lower noise from gears sounds pretty similar to belt driven. Much smoother ride, acceleration and etc... Feels way much nicer and safer for some reason. Strangly whole board was covered is mud and water but gear and around it was dry...

I love to see that you also tried the inner gear version!
The only "disadvantage" I see in a direct drive is that the clearance is less.
Do you think a direct drive on ABEC 11 - 107mm is possible?

I don't really see a problem with clearance as you don't drive on the borders so only the center part can hit something. The smaller wheels will have a problem. It's possible to make but then the gearing will be way different more like 1:3 or etc to make it smaller

It's been a bit busy month for me, I am changing jobs so I am kinda stopped progress on my projects. Last week I received my helmet.

![image|375x500](upload://p172qPXNsFR4XPyHI0724JprOfT.jpg)

Today I worked on my battery mounting controlling situation, in first I thought of making one single box, but now as I work on two different projects I thought it would be cool to have one battery solution for both boards. So I came up with the idea after seeing @Duffman solution of stackable battery modules. The problem is that my lipo are not in the hard case so I need a case for my packs. First idea 3D printing the case but 3d hubs price for 4 pack case was over 100$ for half case peace and to mill it was way to wasteful as it would make 90% removed material so after several days of thinking of the solution I remembered about a general enclosure for electronic solutions. This is where I found a perfect fit case for 1/6 of the price of 3d printing. Of course, it will require some modifications.

![image|444x330](upload://wTEyqWIIKAQY2VT64XoGExewFNr.jpg)

https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/general-purpose-enclosures/7739617/

Then there were some problems with one BMS, as I would need two BMS for both projects, but then also problems with the modular design, as I would like to select how many modules I want to use and charge them collectively or independently as a single module. So have replacements in backpack or etc.

So current plan is to have small BMS for each 12S module and making it stackable and modular. All those modules would have an OLED with a button to display module status and cycle count and etc information as I would like to keep track of my battery life. Also use coulometer as battery level then using voltage.

Here are some planning drawings:

![image|670x500](upload://kpx7byMggHoEhk87qVFhzy3UCbt.png)

![image|690x392](upload://lIPzW80AXjkNdgrMOXoBeLtWtTU.png)

The board would have a docking station which would allow using a single or multiple modules with some other stuff.

Just came back from a 50km ride. The whole battery pack ~9kg the board feels way more stable, less speed wobble and more controllable compared to before. Battery pack went from 4.2V/cell to 3.88V/cell (I was doing a lot of steep hill climbing) So I guess 150km achievable :D My left leg (back one) feels so numb that I can't even walk (haven't been riding for several months) Helmet feels really nice I like the visor helps riding in front of the sun :smiley:

Batteries have almost no sag only then full power (1.7kW per motor) I had 1V down. Need now enclosure for focboxes so I could go bit higher current now only 60A/motor

Also, I hate that every time I turn off Nano-X I need to restart power which resets esk8 app and loses data...

I did not want to push the FocBox'es without proper cooling so I took those hills without much power to not overheat them (they already reach peak 70ºC on the hill)

Not really, as I do not want to reduce sound (helps a lot to have some kind of noise when driving in London streets because bicycles have no idea that you behind or etc) Maybe in the future but right now I don't see a point. Even if we make it it would be expensive and I don't think it's worth invest money just because of noise plus there are no longterm tests and etc. At the moment our internal gear drive train is a best at the moment because it is easy to mount on and any maintenance jobs are few screws away.

Today I thought about modifying front hanger to include inner spring position (I am going to reuse rear mounting plate from Urban carver as in it's back springs are in outer position)

The boards now kinda similar setup (trading drivetrain as I am waiting for Urban Carver gear train to come up)

Board feels similar to Urban carver with inner springs, haven't yet tried outside as batteries charging, but will be going for a ride later today.

On my build I made the inner spring position mod but only with a 4mm hole without countersunk drilling to have more material holding it, used bottom head screw make the surface as flat as possible. 

The board feels a little nervous but it's way more maneuverable on sharp corners.

I only did the front ones

I drilled 4,5mm hole and added just a light 2mm depth countersink was more than enough. Board became way more controllable and stable on the streets :) The back feels like it does not much work. I have been trying without dampas in the back but at higher speed, wobbles begins.

@Eboosted took of all dampas, removed bindings and went for a ride... A slow one but still pretty cool. The board is a way-way-way more controllable I was zigzagging in between poles and etc. The only problem I see that my front feet (My feet size is 13 (47 eur)) so I managed to touch my mug guards many times. I haven't yet tried in the streets but somehow I feel way safer as I am not strapped to the board anymore :)

Now the only problem is battery enclosure :P

Why do you need such a big power plant? I'm still mastering how to ride full throttle on my simple 12s4p, full speed is very difficult to reach without wobbles. 

Do you need a crazy long range? 
Is the weight not ever a concern  with you?

I just wanted charge once a few days, sometimes go for really long range drives you know those days when you don't want to step down from the board. I am not into the speed as my max speed is 54km/h. Also, the weight is not much concern for me.

But in the end, I am going to put 8 on one and 8 on another build :)

I found out after many builds that really long ranges boards are not for me, every build I've made was heavier than the previous one, right now a 30kms board is more than enough, they will charge much faster and I'll charge it immediately after every ride. 

I'm building a short deck ATM (Moonshine Sidekick) and want it to be the lightest one. I have the feeling that it will be the one I'm gonna use the most

I like to go for a ride around the city, that was one of biggest let downs then I had Evolve Carbon GT as the range was really small. Last time I went to small ride ~60km/h was really nice as I was riding and didn't have to care about the battery capacity as I well knew it will be enough for pretty much anything.

Now I am also looking into charging these 8 packs pretty quickly... I have a power supply able to supply 2C current but the problem it is not constant current so I have to either buy some kind converter or build my own... I have in mind building small very light board which would charge under 30 minutes and would deliver pretty good range and would be really light.

So as my Urban carver tire blown, and somehow the whole board feels too small for me and somehow too high with 7" tires and bit unpredictable I thinking of selling it with drivetrain and motors :stuck_out_tongue:

Now back to this project. I moved all electronics, mounted mounting plate for dual FocBox case (now running motors 90A/each) mosfet temperature never jumped 40ºC (104ºF) running for like 40 minutes non stop with 20km/h avg (stoplight waiting) reached top speed, climbed many hills like its freaking nothing just one problem... At higher speed without dampas every small bump is amplified like 10 times which makes you feel like board will kick you off the deck. Also another problem need a way better grip tape on it original is so shitty today several times my leg slid off... Plus thinking of making rubbery leg stoppings so that I would not run my leg too much front because then I start to rub my front of feet to wheel (47 eur shoes...)

@Eboosted I think this next will be interesting for you too ;)

So today I had idea which I tried out and proved to be liable solutions. Idea is simple to make dampas more squeezable I drilled a small hole around 6mm though dampa and then used 10mm bit to make hollow space inside top/bottom bubble of dampa this made top/bottom part squeezable much easier. I put them on front truck (still no dampas in the end) straight test out felt like it turns but not that much like before. So I went out and tested in street immediately pushed throttle to see how it feels on high speed... No more instant wobble which wouldn't make fun riding board. The turning radius is bit lower like 10-20% but that's more than enough to ride on streets without bindings. I could had drilled more into central bubble but I wanted to have center still harder. I have another idea but I will try it bit later, as I want to give this setup a several day worth of testing (My commute consist of 12km bicycle high way road so I can go fast long straight distances if no bicyclist are in the way :D )

Another problem I found out after riding several days long distances that my back feet is getting numb after half hour of riding non stop... I don't know maybe my sneakers are bit too hard or etc maybe someone had similar problem and knows a good fix? Maybe its related riding without dampas or I don't know... It just annoys as I don't really have time/place to stop in the middle of highway :D


Oh and here are some pictures of current setup :stuck_out_tongue:

Great idea with hollowing out the dampas. How about using an old soldering iron bit to melt away the middle of the top and bottom bubbles?
Sure the gases given off would be horrible and possibly toxic, but generally safer than trying to drill freehand.

@trampa @Eboosted tried that with green dampas (in the front) as I though yellow ones will loose stability at higher speed and I was right now I have turn ability again and I think it is still stable at higher speeds, but it was way too cold/windy/rainy to try more :)

I am going to replace my dampas to orange ones today after work and will try them out, they already are way more squashable so it will allow more turning while still working as dampeners :) Can't wait to try them out

So yeah went out after swapping them... Two words:

# F**CKING AMAZING...

So yeah it's a freaking god stuff... I have full turn-ability kinda same as without dampas (these are really squeezable) and I was oh yeah turnable but high speed will wobble like hell Oh boy I was wrong...

## I reached top speed like 6 times...

All small bumps I had kinda disappeared from feeling now I can go through London style speedbumps without even braking... Small potholes and etc which would cause the board to shift now doesn't even make a difference...

So yeah my custom formula is a big success going to make another two for back trucks cause now in the back is yellows with holes... 

### No more holes... No more sacrificed turnability...

Can't wait for tomorrow rides :stuck_out_tongue:

Why not add a trampa flex bridge? You know the part which is added to the middle which removes flex

I swapped yesterday the back ones to orange too, at first it was bit scary too much turnability and bit was unstable. Rode for like 20-30km and then I went on my normal route to work for a night group ride... Damn it was amazing experience it felt really nice turnability is cool I always touch my front foot to wheel, stability is good until max speeds. There will be some videos about my board because according to others it is a monster... I thought it was just normal board :D Had one speed wobble on cam at top speed was scary as fuck but it was 55km/h...

@Eboosted @Silverline I can try to make a set for your guys if I have enough material.  Is 20£ + 4£ shipping a good price?

P.S. They are not cosmetically the nicest ones but it does it job.

Small update. Change the tires to street ones, added bindings changed dampas to red ones (was going back to yellow then green ones) Now I am riding bit higher speeds so stability is important :) Also fixed my battery mounting using velcro tape as lipo bags started making fiber glass dust and it was getting pain in the ass to charge it :slight_smile:

So I was coasting back home like usual ~40-50km/h nothing special and then bamn one motor disappeared. I stopped with in mind idea fucking focbox blown or etc.. Looked at faults no faults, took of lid checked focboxes evertyhing looks fine I apply throttle green LED turns on and etc. So I just assumed motor died, so I took it off and went back home without it.

It was first time with single gear drive and 6384 going back home oh boy it was a journey... I remember @Pingo03 was asking about 6384 as single motor...

I don't know how with urethane's but oh boy with my street 8" tires it was fun can't drive any faster than 10km or any sudden acceleration wheel spins in place... Brakes barely works... Damn it was fun to go downhill felt like on normal longboard whole board felt like its running freely brakes managed to slow down a bit but still not enough... Also torque steering is way too big on single drive... And last thing as I drive with motorcycle full helmet I usually don't hear/mind gear drive sound I know its loud but with helmet you can't hear it that much... But oh boy my gear drive was screaming from the load... IT was crying for help... 

So came back home first test of simple motor phase shortening and spinning to see if there is resistance all phases passed. Next step was connecting focbox to tool... Damn it was scary I connected wrote faults and says no faults, I am like okay... I tried to spin motor I see like 0.5A drawn and nothing spinning... Took lid again and I see from first watch DRV popped and magic smell...

Ech at least I have another focboxes which I was suppose to send back home for test board oh well I need to get to work tomorrow so... :smiley:

I think DRV popped while I was driving back home with disconnected motor... I remember looking first thing at DRV and nothing wrong was with it... I fixed it but just didn't finished everything as I was shortening phase wires. Also I really **hate** JST PH sensor connector... One pin broke inside and shortened 5V so another DRV is dead too... Now I can cook pancakes on DRV :smiley:

I changed my rear dampas to blue (had some problems as metal insert inside spring holder started to spin itself @trampa that's a bit design flaw...)

I took a Chinese Pro camera and went out for a test ride to see the difference instantly I felt turning is limited, but stability is oh boy... I was riding top speeds and my body just waits for that wobble to begin and gets stiff and etc but no wobble or anything else supper happy with this setup right now.

As mSD card was FAT32 camera split videos in clips and at the moment I don't have tool to merge them so I just uploaded all of them to youtube :smiley:

The Inserts are custom designed, A4 stainless and spinning inserts have never been an issue so far.
If you don't crank down the screw like hell the spring retainers last for ages. No mater how good the steel interlocks with the plastic, there is a point where the plastic is the weakest link in the chain. We made the inserts mega big to increase the surface area as much as humanly possible.

So after this morning commute I can say blue/red combo is way too stable, like literally I don't need any effort to ride high speeds I was going down hill on throttle to overreach my top speed to see if at higher speed I will get wobbles but nope its just stable.  So far I love this setup and I think I will stick to it.

I changed my rear dampas to blue (had some problems as metal insert inside spring holder started to spin itself @trampa that’s a bit design flaw…)
[/quote]

just unscrew the top adjuster and use a clamp to angle the trucks. You can then slide out the top of the springs to work on/exchange the dampers without having to remove those bloody bottom spring holders.

[quote="trampa, post:293, topic:36560, full:true"]
The Inserts are custom designed, A4 stainless and spinning inserts have never been an issue so far.

If you don’t crank down the screw like hell the spring retainers last for ages. No mater how good the steel interlocks with the plastic, there is a point where the plastic is the weakest link in the chain. We made the inserts mega big to increase the surface area as much as humanly possible.

They spin here too...mainly because of loctite. One could not be loosened straight from the factory and I had to apply heat before it would let go.

OMG.....

Just did a testrun with the custom dampas from @Kug3lis in the back .... They are the shit..... Stable in neutral position, when going fast forward, no speed wobbles at all, and yet super carvyyyyy :heart_eyes::heart_eyes: I have yellow trampa dampas in the front at the moment, but i will replace them with these orange ones now, and give it at go :ok_hand:

So yeah, after yesterday group riding was going home when one plastic wheel hub broke at 30-50km/h speed don't know exactly which hit the brakes as it started to wobble supper hard, the tire tube broke, I think focbox is also fried as motor wasn't spinning anymore. Thanks god I was with bindings otherwise I would had been laying on the ground or etc so yeah took Uber back home and didn't looked at board as I was supper pissed...

So I think I need alu wheel hubs on this board like asap... it's freaking scary

So did the hub break which then caused the inner tube to burst. Or did the tube burst and then the hub broke as the weight went directly onto the rim from the flat tyre.

I think riding on the streets with bindings is a bit like having a deathwish. Too much shit that can go wrong. And when it goes wrong you can't get away. And if you don't ride with heel straps then sooner or later it is very likely the board will break your foot or leg.
In the woods it's another story.

So yesterday I received new FocBox from another person which was definitely new no usage mark or etc, changed plugs added to the case did motor detection and etc everything was working fine, did some inside ride (10m or so) worked fine went out finally for a ride outside haven't been on board for a month and public transport in London sucks so badly (Central line who knows :joy:) and bamn 2 meters and DRV error on new FocBox... Came back home, check PCB, DRV looks like nothing happened but when I plug power it heats up so I  think something is bad with DRV :( Sad thing is that warranty is down as I replaced connectors. Will try to replace DRV...

I also ordered 1 new one from Enertion as nobody has in stock in Europe :( @onloop could you check delivery times on order #20213?

Another week without a board :(


P.S. Stupid idea I had today as inside my apartment today was like 36ºC. The idea is to connect big as propeller to 64** motor and use it as a fan :D would vesc be able to handle it :D

So as I was fixing all the wiring, sleeving and etc, just before getting tomorrow my drv I checked all gear drives if it spins correctly and shit...

One motor everything fine, the other one (the same which blew previous vesc) did same thing as new I got before...

So I was like this motor is for *** bad or etc, took multimeter, measured phases on wire is dead like zero contact with the world... checked cables and next base where windings attaches to phase wire its broken inside heat-shrink...

![image|375x500](upload://15zBcxNNkL66OoMnAAg46xMXxZk.jpg)

So thanks god Farnell is like next day delivery should get DRV on Thursday...

So be careful guys, always check your motor phase wires, if one is damaged it can kill your ESC :)

On the other side some good news, received my upgrade package for my board, as I have already 3.5k miles on it and gears are not the best shape, after broken wheel hub and other stuff happened it was screaming as someone was killing it.

So I got FatBoy Solid Core Wheel hubs and v2 of 1:5 gear drive. Can't wait to get back home from work to be able assembly it.

Yesterday, after rushing back home after work. I installed new parts, [FatBoy Solid Core Wheel Hubs](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/wheel-hubs/products/fatboy-solid-core-hub-3-75-5-spoke-for-28mm-bearing-set-of-4-hubs) and new[FatBoy Inner Gear Drive Train 1:5 for Trampa](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/fatboy/products/fatboy-inner-gear-drive-train-5-1-for-trampa). 

It was fun to take all wheels apart and change wheel hubs, dirtiest work on the board I guess and all brake dust and etc is present on wheels...

![image|500x500](upload://x34ZaZH5JeUR8KOJOE2YOy2DYTU.jpg)

The wheel hub structure is so THICCC it's like not even comparable to original plastic ones, its one massive wheel hub... I was thinking maybe even polish them for more bling bling

https://media.giphy.com/media/OcO1mg91Ct4CA/giphy.gif

![image|500x500](upload://zC4hg1z7rFdZFSXsU3CywqnChup.jpg)

Also now wheel hubs, come with high quality bearings (not comparable to Trampa ones and bearing spacer)

![image|375x500](upload://uv4OLa8fbwjviqYT2gYtWpQI5hV.jpg)

Mouting wheel gear is much easier as you can now tighten them really well as there are no more plastic which can brake and etc :D

**Also I changing all my bolts to Torx ones, as I hate to use drill to drill off the head then head spins off...**

![image|375x500](upload://4Sp84vLrVX6iUBw4rKiaDvv8noU.jpg)

The new motor mounting plate is way much better

![image|375x500](upload://1NZlrasUZ968MyrN3QeVCjuZ6Qa.jpg)

Wheel hub bolts now are from behind and need no more hammering to get it on.

So went for the first ride. First notice just from pulling board to outside, sound is much nicier than pulling board compared to previous one. That's a big plus, I hate to pull my board through office and everyone looks at me like who is making that noise :D

First step on the board and first push on throttle... I was like where is sound there was no sound compared to previous one it was some but not like before it's completely different also the whole feeling is much smoother the new drive train just flows you press throttle and it just goes doesn't feel like motors have to struggle to push the board it just goes..

https://youtu.be/ym60DdSHQrY

I was amazed... Did some turns around the home and went to the road around thames CS3 road in London from Blackwall, damn the wheel hubs... I didn't thought it will make such big difference in riding experience the board just flows... No more vibrations at higher speeds or anything, it also rolls much further I don't know if its related to gear drive or just wheels I can push lot more and just coast much further than before. One noticeable thing is jumping those wheel hubs are bit heavier than plastic, and also they don't absorb the jump like plastic ones, so you feel it with whole board.

Went for speed runs, and now to reach top speed is super easy, and it feels supper stable ( I am running  red dampas in front and blue one in the back) 

https://youtu.be/ZI_elNQTYlA

https://youtu.be/5vtw-OTBDMs

P.S. I need new motors, my current one magent retention ring touches motor baseplate and makes noise too...

Will hardcore accelerating be a problem too or would it be impossible to do without bindings as well?

Okay so that kind of braking will never really be possible for my usage and thats good to know as well. Thanks @kug3lis!

Well this was nice, went for a ride but with half sensored half sensorless accidentally dropped motor, and sensor wire broke inside the wire sleeve was lazy to fix as I wanted go for a ride but in the end was pretty fun.

Was hitting ERPM limit several times, its fun then whole board just bumps at top speed :D These motors have strange vibration sound at specific RPM range sounds kinda electric but also bit mechanical don't know where its coming from but its similar to those APS 8072 making noises...

Have to do some fixations on the wiring, also will try to add 3rd pack to the deck for bit longer rides at the moment able to do 15mi (25km) with 2P but there is going to be some group rides this weekend so want to spend more time riding than charging :D

If you go out to the Front door it is life risking.... Anything is risky...

But it is especially risky if you ride a trampa MtB over 30mph/50kmh because the body and Wind resistance pushes the Board back and the Motors Pull to the Front. That way you compress the board like a spring (-->  <--) and when You Release the throttle the Board Releases the tension (-->   _____) and the Board goes under your feet a bit backwards. That can easily pur you out of Balance.

End cap is also glue broken I managed to get it out with simple knocking on the axle...

![image|375x500](upload://gOmxIBYUZHSIfnqFuofpCicR512.jpg)

So I took Loctite 648 and started assembling it from scratch...

![image|375x500](upload://mc5xQLzk6kkYdkHD1i9blacP00d.jpg)

Everything assembled fine, but I guess if fcked with one polarity of magnet because it doesn't spin freely on the stator...

But the worst thing early before the critical mass ride I got replacement rotor from APS so I will probably use that one... This time I sank the whole rotor in 648 so it wouldn't unglue by itself...

Btw, I am looking into getting good quality motors, not with epoxy used to glue magnets but some serious stuff which holds up until 120ºC not starts cracking at low temperature...

Looks like they are using cheap glue or epoxy to begin with. It's a well known trick to keep the cost of manufacturing down and has plagued the Multi rotor industry for some time untill the news was spread and the manufacturer was forced to utilize the more expensive high temp glue/sales decreased significantly.

So today got many stuff in the post, new tires for autumn sleeks are bit slidey on wet surfaces, black buckets for mud guards, connectors for sensor cable for small update to my project will post soon as would get all the parts for it and 35º risers.

So the project will have overlap with Mark 48 :D Will by trying out Evo deck instead of trampa deck. Should be fun with back 20º and front 50º trucks maybe it will be more stable and turnable will see but I can't imagine evo deck on 8" wheels :D

After swapping deck and trying out... I am done with Trampa decks... Stability, turn-ability, stability is off the peak. The evo deck angles just makes even more better. At the back now is 20º and front is 50º back is clearly visible that it doesn't turn much but front is super turnable. I tried with my original blue dampas it was still turnable and stable without bindings but I changed to green ones as I want to carve bit more. I tried out today with green ones to the work so summary that I need to work on normal longboard stance (if you forget to put whole weight going over a bump you can jump off the deck :D ) and work on my stance. There was one 90º turn which I couldn't make but it was because I placed my foot incorrectly at that moment.

I also changed my fenders to black ones and now what is left to is change esc enclosure to fully water proof one.

So yeah day 2 damn I miss my bindings trampa is like riding on couch you don't need to do anything much don't care about front foot lifting or bumps or other stuff happening. Today I was literally crying as muscle pain was massive since yesterday, and to turn was even harder with hurting muscles.

Still haven't found a correct stance, my rear foot hurts from tension or etc... @Deckoz could you send picture how you stand on it?

i use sort of a downhill stance unless im going less than 10mph, front foot about 45 degrees from center of the truck with my heel over the edge of the board for better control(small adjustments with ankles when roads are bad) at speed and turning heelside. 
rear foot i try to align the ball of my foot(big toe lol) with the front foot big toe. i found this works good for me since the evo turns mostly from the front. 
weight distribution is almost all the time 60-70\30, more on the front.  hope this helps :slight_smile:  
oh and relax your hips a little and keep a stable core, specially your back muscles.

In the middle of the ride one motor stopped spinning looked like it lost CAN connection or etc because iOS App couldn't connect to it over can forward. I was like yep popped DRV came to office took apart lid no error light or etc restarted power boom it spins... So now I am bit confused like WTF happened :D Probably will return back to split ppm..

@sk8l8r the deck is to high 20cm from ground, was riding at bit higher speed and big bump caused me turn bit side and because of high deck I almost fell off of it to the side right in front of incoming car damn was scary :D So I am back to bindings

It's the backlash I have set, when free coasting down the hill, it's backlash chatter. 

You can setup any gear type to have little to no backlash to minimize noise, but lack of backlash causes constant pressure on the pressure points inducing premature wear and unnecessarily pressure angles. I setup these gears backlash based off the tooth type and spacing for longevity.

@Wraith

![svg|690x366](upload://7LhEkWveR2aoASVGnbY3j3ab2cB.png)

You can see the teeth could be further in mesh(closer together), which would also shrink the backlash. The smaller the backlash, the further misalligned the pressure angles (dotted circles) will be, inducing premature wear which can break teeth from over pressure

Same goes with to large of a backlash. You can strip the tips of the teeth off. So backlash is one of those things you can adjust for noise/wear patterns etc
```

Okay that pretty much explains it :laughing:

Ohh I see so the larger the backlash(to some extent) the better the expected wear on them due to proper alignment?

How did you set these? I can’t move the gears to set the amount backlash without altering the distance which requires modifications to the mount location and so on? Or am I over thinking this lol
```

## \#384 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-09-07T13:40:42.588Z Reads: 275

To large of a backlash puts all the pressure on the tips, which can cause stripped gears. The majority of pressure should be at the bottom arc of the tooth so the pressure is on the meat of the tooth. However to close of backlash and there is constant pressure on both of the surrounding teeth. Pressure should only be on one tooth at a time.

This should help explain how a gear functions
![png|609x500](upload://i9jKjYXJOEOEYyje0fK6QkjJZ63.jpg)

You can set backlash by moving the motor in or out on the mount in the motor screw slots.

So yesterday I received new parts for this build: FatBoy SS Drive with 1:5 and 1:4 configurations, and 2 x 80100 180kv motors.

I was doing hyper-lapse for assembling everything but the battery died and didn't have yet time to edit as it was pretty long one but I have some pictures from assembling everything

So after removing the board from the "work table" I instantly felt that these motors are from another dimension... When I was assembling it had some hard resistance to sping the motor but it would that much that pulling board felt like I am towing a truck I didn't expect it. The magnetic forces of these motors are in another dimension...

TIP FOR MYSELF: Implement board pulling feature in ESC :D To assist pulling with the same RPM from motors :laughing:

 Went out for outside and boy this gear drive is silent compared to inner gear :slight_smile:

This motors transformed this board to dark side... They are massive... At first I thought I got wrong kv rating as it felt slow until I saw the speed reading that I am almost top speed but it didn't felt like it at all.

It has nice torque but feels like it need bit more voltage and current to feel satisfied it feels like they are still starving... Running 80A motor and 80A battery... Motor constantly reaches motor amps limits and I have seen a dozen time I reached 80A on battery... So far heatsink of FocBox manages to keep up with cooling

![image|690x162](upload://7W0d14xipNoggkRXoQcMes2dTN9.png) 

I thought that bigger motors will heat up less but that's not true as they are eating more current so based on IR it releases much more heat but I think the sizes make it dissipate that heat much quicker...

The battery side its bit sad right now as power consumption increased to around 20Wh/km per motor I am getting only 20km range with 12s 18Ah setup. But thank god still no sagging problems

![image|690x148](upload://yw3HNWaplyqhxS9WKjfpuw75DQu.png) 

5mm bullets with 12awg wire holds up without issue, no heating up detected. 

The ride to work felt pretty nice, definitely lost some speed downgrading from 200kv to 180kv :) But I still have 1:4 setup but I don't think I will switch anytime soon :)

If it doesn't going to rain this evening, I will go to Hyde Park to do some filming and try some offroad as I haven't yet unleashed its power :D

@tabbytabb can't wait to test out ARC200 as these motors need POWAR and focbox'es bit struggling with them :blush:

Looks nice. Great build 👍🏻

Had those monsters on my boards also (modified) and with encoders. I ended up running 6384 instead. The extra weight and loss of range with these 80xx motors just didn't add up. But it was great fun building. I used a vesc6 with 120 motors amps.

Yep- free rolling is a total different feeling with this size of motors. A lot of resistance. And mine got hotter than 63xx series too.

Would not recommend these motors for esk8 unless your are:

2. Climbing insane hills/mountains
3. Just want to do something insane that most people don't do  😜

After coming back home decided that I will keep them... I had some doubts before, but boy that torque... Driving in the road, 5 cars ahead of you driving slow... Small push board jumps forward and overtakes all the cars in instant :D No way I can get this feeling on 6384 :D

Will wait for ARC200 and probably will get another pack of battery for group rides to mount on top when I  do need range, for smalls shits I can recharge half of battery in 15mins so I do not see much problem :)

Just please HobbyKing make again black friday sale with half price for graphene packs :D

What current were you running your 6384's at?

Torque = current / Kv

The 6384's are quoted as having an 80A max, which is what you are capping these giant beasts at, so you should be able to achieve the same torque levels with the smaller motors since you arent running 80A continuously.

Those 6384 can't handle 80A without over heating and other issues... Look some previous post and you will understand why I don't really want to go back to 6384

I am running both 6384 and 80100 at same settings definitely 80100 has way more torque and different response compared to 6384

Any insight why they consume so much more? In the discussion with @professor_shartsis the final word was that a bigger motor will have way less loses due to more copper, but the reality seems to prove the contrary

Maybe is just because you hammer them all the time since is too much fun? Or they are powerful but a bad eletromagnectic design that lead to lots of iron loses?

Do you speak of motor amps?

Because I got the APS 6384S 170kv and had also the aloy ring came loose on both motors and on the second two magnets "moved out" - but I was also running the vesc6 config with 120A motor amps - did not had any issue about getting hot.

?? I must be misunderstanding.  Motor amps absolutely matter! Motor torque = kt * motor amps. The whole point of bigger motors is that they allow you to achieve low Kv values without severely limiting your max motor current capabaility. What motor amps are you running your 80xx at?

Matters but it's not the one you specified. On specification, max amps are at their working voltage.

Do you expect these motors to deliver 90kNm? :D

At low duty cycle, (low speed, low voltage) (duty = voltage) For e.g. at duty 0.1 I can send over 500A without an issue because it would be 0.1 * 50.4 = 5.04V and power rating would be 500A * 5.04V = 2.5kW still under rating.

So according to your theories, I should get around 90kNm at ~900RPM?

[/quote]

I disagree with this.  500A will burn up a motor regardless what voltage it is applied at.  Current causes wire to heat according to I^2 R, which is independent of voltage.  You can melt a motor very easily without ever breaching its rated power by running them at high current, low voltage.

That is exactly why you can't get 90 kN*m out of these motors at low duty-cycles.  The excessive current melts them.

Full explanation here:
http://www.ebikes.ca/learn/power-ratings.html

As for torque, wikipedia has a great explanation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_constants

*KT*  is the torque produced divided by armature current.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_constants#cite_note-10) It can be calculated from the motor velocity constant  *Kv* .

You probably haven't seen raw ESC current consumption spikes ;) ESC doesn't run calculations that fast enough to smooth all current spikes... The current limit is achieved by measuring current and then turning off mosfets if its over the limit, so when you turn on you can even reach as much as motor needs at that moment... Motors don't run at constant currents to even feel I^2*R effects of those spikes :)

EDIT: It's not much visible for small motors, as they dont have these kind of power needs, but on these 80100 I  am getting ABS_OVER_CURRENT with like 280A readings :) So motor consumes what it needs for that moment until ESC limits it

I'm sorry, I've gotten a little over enthusiastic, when really no one wants to read my ranting.  Let me step back and just ask what motor current settings you are running your 80XX motors at, and what motor current settings were you running the 6384's at?  I'm genuinely curious to know that.

90A motor and battery for both the 6384 and the 80100?

BTW, I remember someone suggesting to just crank up the motor amps and let the VESC's thermal cutoff protections handle the whole burning-output-mosfets thing.  I think that might be a valid strategy in your case, since there's relatively little chance that you're going to over-current these motors.

Yes for both.

Well like I mentioned, vesc doesn't handle current limiting really well... I am already getting absolute over current errors with 200A numbers, so I dont want to just burn it. Thermals maybe but still valid option, but somehow I don't want to spend more money on focboxes don't have budget for them in upcoming months :D I have pretty much enough torque right now, definitely way more than it was before :) I can jump through places where 6384 were not performing :)

Not really if u knew how much force it needs to spin those motors on free roll... If wheel looses friction it freaking slides not spins.... I can't imagine how it would be with lower reduction gearbox... Impossible to pull board ;)

The magnetic force of magnets are huge and it needs current to overcome that... Plus it doesn't have free roll you let go current and it instantly slows down don't even need to brake ;D

They could be, but again, we don’t know how much of these motors are really engineered and how much is guess work

They could just increased the stator diameter without paying attention to the higher flux being pushed with higher currents, it could be saturating at a lot of places, since @Kug3lis says that they are getting hot supports this

Went today to cyclopark in the UK really nice place have done a bunch of rides, tried out bicycle off-road track but it just isn't made for esk8 have fallen more times than I have ever fallen while riding all the boards :D

This morning had to do some modifications on motor hall sensor dead so changed one motor to sensorless thought I will have some issues but there weren't any didn't even felt any difference...

Also flashed focbox with no limits firmware and set motors to 130A and abs max to 180A

https://i.imgur.com/2xWXMo6.png

And oh boy it changed everything... At first was everything nice until I was standing on hill stop light and as always pressed bit more of throttle as it was uphill oh boy my board started making wheelie while going uphill... Later on every time I push more throttle it lifts up even without any help some people were like WOW in cyclopark but for me it as bit scary as I don't know yet how to balance that stuff :blush:

Heatsink managed to keep focboxes under 70ºC max I saw was 68ºC while speeding on the race track. Also, note that in colder times super flat surfaces for pnuemies are scary as tires are cold and they don't stick much to the surface and you start flowing on the road which is also scary :smiley:

As there was no CAN cable supplied with the kit I looked up the docs in wiring and managed to make myself can cable with PWM input using fly lead and another PWM input lead (I don't know if intentionally but PWM cable pins matches CAN on THRO cable :D

No white smoke so then connected to my machine.

Mechanical part was everything really nice, I like those connectors and etc stuff, but software it still bit lacks :)

So apparently the GUI application doesn't work on Windows 7. Had to download windows 10 and install on virtual machine :) Thanks god I have super quick internet :D

First connection, tried to run setup wizard and got some exceptions (Division by zero as a developer don't remember last time I have seen this exception somewhere) Probably because it didn't read the values or etc from ESC at startup :) Restarting the app helped.

![image](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/4/84329c08901c9dc78d6ec2bc1a12190f80f60494.png)

So I tried to follow the tutorial from @tabbytabb youtube video for setup ARC200 for esk8

https://youtu.be/u6EYof3M2Fw

I did a whole wizard and etc, but for some reason, my motor wasn't reacting to remote at all. I see in telemetry tab that values move on raw throttle input :)

So I redid again and after clicking write to flash my motors started making really high pitch noise and I saw OV error on UI and quickly disconnected power after restarting nothing was happening so I tried again 5-6 times the wizard and it finally worked. 

Finally got motor spinning. The first impression feels like motors spinning a bit more silent than VESC (probably because of higher PWM frequency). But it has this not nice feeling when even after releasing throttle ramping down is too slow and it keeps going longer than VESC... Couldn't find anything related this in the settings maybe it is the way it works.

https://youtu.be/C8e0bihDsMM

I couldn't find the CAN option in the configuration so I had to make Y splitter for PWM input... I need to buy those RC receiver male connectors because my simple PCB header pins don't really work well :D

So after mounting everything on the deck using trusty zip ties, I went out to try it out :)

Sensorless startup for some reason didn't really want to pick it up and also both motors feel really out of sync torque wise, but after spinning up they reach equilibrium between each other and feels nice for that speed. Then like I always try out the brakes to feel how they feel compared to VESC. The brakes don't know if it works incorrectly or I didn't configure something correctly but they work like they block the motor for like 100ms release and block again until it stops. While riding at higher speed this is really bad as it makes the whole board jump back and forward. Also at 0 speed brakes do something strange with motors it doesn't lock but it keeps knocking. So I decided not to risk and went back home :( Had to skip an event ride.

@tabbytabb maybe you can help me with configuring it? I really like the design of it and it looks really solid ESC but at the moment I am switching back to my focboxes. 

Here are my configuration files maybe they will help.

Sorry to see you had some troubles getting this going. I'm the software/hardware designer on the project and hopefully we can get your board working better!

Unfortunately the GUI is currently only compatible with windows 10. The divide-by-zero bug was identified recently (as you suspected, it is caused by parameters not successfully initially downloading). This will be addressed in an upcoming release.

As for the motors stopping slowly with no throttle (slower than VESC), this is completely normal. Your video is not anything that should concern you. If you want them to stop faster, you can use the 'Current Command Offset' to do this, make the value more negative than the default value. 


Seems like the biggest issue you're facing is the regen current going into a fault state. The phenomenon occurring every 100ms is the drive detecting some fault and self-protecting. We need to figure out why this is happening to get smooth braking. Before digging in too deep on this, can you make sure your drive firmware is the latest? It will tell you at the top of the telemetry tab of the GUI. If it is not 1.1.5, download the latest firmware from the wiki (v1.1.5 https://freeflysystems.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRP/pages/269320215/Arc200+Firmware+Updates), update your drive (and GUI if it is not also up to date), then see if it works better. The firmware update instructions are on that page. Since you were having problems previously, I'd recommend not loading your old configuration file in. Instead, re-run the setup process with the new firmware as there have been some improvements to the process and default values.

If you're still having problems after that, I'll give a few suggestions on parameter adjustments to tweak to see if we can isolate the problem.

What is the model of the motor you are using?

Hey Chris,

Thanks for pointing out the issues :) I think I have probably 1.1.4 version as far as I remember. I will try to upgrade the firmware. But I will only do it on weekend as I am riding my board daily and don't want to make it unavailable :P

The motors are APS 80100 180KV 8kW rated 18S 180A

Thanks for helping, I will try to upgrading firmware and try it out again I would love to get it working.

So today I just checked how my gears look after emergency stopping from 50km/h to 0 in like 10meters and stopping right in front of car like 1m away from its hood... Damn I loved my gears, big ass motors, bindings and lipos for managing to stop me like this...

After looking at graphs I am happy I don't have Li-Ions...

![image|690x394](upload://sf6c4hsfLdLV3RvnjSzM2mcn19g.png) 

Took quickly lid off to inspect the gears everything apart grease changed color looks OK :) no visible wear or chipping on gears.

I love my small tool for making life easier :D

Imagine the p count required to brake at 100A and I guess he would have hit the car at the typical brake strenght that is set for li-ion. 

Lipo handles higher charge rates at ease (the Graphene labeled lipos at least).

My guess is that his board would not have issues stopping regardless with those humongous motors.

Yes, Li-Ion is bad on charging currents for e.g. if I had 12S20P any 18650 battery pack it would be 20P * Capacity (3Ah) * 1C (that's maximum safe charging rate for 18650) = 60A maximum charging current.  At 2C 18650 starts sweating a lot. So now imagine pushing 200A into battery its more than 3C... So in the end I would had my crotch on fire and have hitted the car :D

Wasn't the 25R rated for 4A constant charge current, which is around 2C? For peaks like this I assume liions to not perform as bad as implied here.

The 4a was just to show that liions can safely take more than 1C. Then braking is not constant charge but compared to a full charge only a momentary situation (read: relatively short). I'd like to see some actual research on this, as so far this seems to be an assumption. Have you tested what will happen at 60A brake current on a 4P pack temperature wise? I guess the voltage spike will cause the VESC to shut down but am not sure. A resistor a la mellow might be a solution to this though.

I would also like to see some data on high amp pulse charge and its effect on battery life or battery temp. Anyone seen any test data on this? Maybe we need to get Mooch to do this test for us. Or if someone on this forum has the equipment needed. 

1c is empty to full in 1 hour. Emergency braking is max 5 seconds. So they are not comparable situations.

I love UK weather forecast... In the morning putting on shoes looking into forecast outside is sunny and etc :) After looking forecast 10% chance of rain not much turn around it is down pouring... Welp into rain suite and ride to work :)

I was prepared to be angry the whole day but boy I was happy :D It was so much fun... Wheels spinning in place, drifting on the roads + carving is so much fun :D

Now I realized how much my front lifts up just a tiny bit when accelerating (every time I push more throttle front lifts up and drops down causing puddles to splash such cool thing) 

Also now I know that my board is fully waterproof :D Had been swimming through a puddle and one even cause water wave up to helmet :D (I didn't even dare to look at the back to see how bicyclist and pedestrian look afterwards)

Lol this song on repeat through all rain and lightings (yeah you read correctly lightings in middle of November :D)

Well time for some updates :) As I got 3D printer I finally started working on decent casing for my graphene packs...

I am building modular 12S1P 6Ah packs with battery voltage meter, balance connector and dual xt90 power connectors.

The bottom part will be CNC machined aluminium, middle and top 3D printed PETG I guess, top something black or gray, middle semi transparent red:

![image|690x428](upload://deVEaebskEWjLI9b6BvAVY2974.jpeg) 

Here is some renderings of how it suppose to look

![image|690x488](upload://eLgr0jtQtX3fO0D9fmqGi4OkxqT.jpeg) 

![image|573x500](upload://omiI1XxLdtqhFnNHWPNiViShoiV.jpeg)

The idea is that I will be able to remove and swap packs on the fly by just unscrewing those 4 x M6 bolts holding them to frame which will be mounted on top of deck. Total height should be around 16cm

Another planned update is the esc enclosure, finally my diy enclosure died so I will be replacing it with our  enclosure modified for two focboxes (I am bit in the doubt unity will be able to hold currents I am running right now) and 5V 40A DC/DC regulator for RGB strips and etc stuff need a sandbox for Esk8Lightuino to work on.

![image|690x492](upload://9KIi9qZO2qmm2dkQcSUaLh7RJq.jpeg) 

Also thinking of getting Metr Pro. I loved the way I could change power settings on 3DServisas trampa on the fly...

BTW Which tyres do you guys think are the best for asphalt 8" I tried multiple from trampa but still havent decided which ones are decent.

Yeah... It spent more time printing than idling already :D

BTW I had one idea which which I really wanted but current solutions where not what I really wanted. The idea is simple I am running really high current settings which drains my 1.2kW battery like its nothing and its really annoying sometimes when you don't really want any torque but just ride to work shop or etc. First thoughts were to just get Metr pro but when I was thinking if you stay at stoplight and want to drag some bike or car when you will suck as you will need to flash new settings (not safe thing to do in the middle of intensive street)

Then I was thinking what I could do so I had and idea from Esk8Lithuino I am using toggle nano-x second channel to turn on the lights, when I had idea to merge this with bit of code on VESC which will read single pin if its high it turns on normal settings set by VESC tool, if its low it defaults to standard 60/-60 settings.

For the pin I choose 5V tolerant SWDIO pin as it not used anywhere and is routed out to connector on most of the VESC boards (I updated code only for 410/411/412 (AKA 4.12 and FocBox).

I haven't yet tried it on the street but it compiles and looks okay

https://github.com/aurimasniekis/bldc/tree/slow_mode

So now it will be hold on Nano-X second channel button for 5s to turn on high power (aka normal config mode) by default it will be in slow mode.

The best thing I haven't changed almost nothing, but good printer, filament (prusament) and settings provided by prusa are like almost high end enterprise level quality even with kit not assembled :)

Only negative I could possibly see is if it's been pissing down you possibly can get some water in those connections and cook it😎
Maybe have em on the side...
I would like to see it as a one unit between bindings...maybe not so high then I think it would look much better...

Its only 15cm high so not that high :) I will have seals on every connector including xt90 :) I don't make it so I can dive but some heavy rain should be alright :slight_smile:

Thought the idea here was to allow for further parallel cases? So I expected to see a 'slave' case besides that one for long range

Looks like it

i wanted to write something productive, but while writing i realized :rofl:

but jokes on the side. 15cm is still super huge for me. I don´t get how you can ride on that. I mean i see others with big boxes as well, but i just can´t imagine that it is comfortable to ride. I already cry when it´s over 10cm. 8cm is perfect for me.

Well, when you want power you have to sacrifice something :) I am riding the same stuff just in bag its only few cm higher :) These packs provide a lot of juice for my 80100 :) Btw after 2 years they not even puffed or etc considering I am not even balancing them :)

I opened up a 8085 and I really don’t see for what the 80mm size should be better. Also don’t see how they could take more power. I understand that the lipos need so much space and sure it’s always better to run them in multiple p groups, but everything needs to be in balance. I think it works for you well as you mainly use it on the road and not off road. My personal opinion is just that for off-road the lighter the better. Sure in balance with power but still as light as you get it. In this case a 8p LiIon would be rather the way to go for that. 8p means also low profile of 8-10cm max. Ok ok, not if to make a monster box like your dad, but for the average guy that wouldn’t need to be higher.

Well 8085 yes but 100 is whole 15mm longer :) I compared them to 8085 on my fathers board and yes they feel completely different :) 8085 reminds me 6384 but 80100 is different story.. I mean look at the size difference :D

8085 is from the copper mass close to the 6384. sure it’s more on the 80100, but still i‘m very disappointed about the copper fill. There is way more space on the stator. The 6384 is way more compact. Don’t really see a benefit in comparison 6384 to 8085 and even with the 80100 the stator length is maybe as long as the one from the 6384. I could imagine the 63100 could compare with the 80100 from the amount of copper on the stator.

That space for copper is for those super low KV motors like 30 and 50 as copper is almost 3x compared to 170kv

P.S. Copper and length is not only factor in torque the bigger radius bigger angle torque or etc something don't remember now

Not speed but torque :) My board goes max 58km/h but the torque at 130A/motor.... I am dragging some bikes at stoplight until they overtake my speed :D

P.S. Have no idea about the heat in summer with my current setup, but I guess with new enclosure with much bigger heatsink it should be a bliss

Also I saw new Graphene packs 12Ah 6S ones which are bit bigger than my current packs thinking of swapping they are 15C but still with 2S3P in 12S3P configuration I would get 36Ah and double range with 540A "constant" so not much difference and 2.5kg more weight but range man.... :D

😂 my current battery is not even that big 😂


But why not considering LiIon cells? You can get way more range out of the same weight, plus at that weight you speak of the discharge current shouldn’t be an issue as well

Maybe, don't know Li-ion you need to balance them because you have way too many cells in P groups compared to lipos where I only have 3...

For e.g. the space I have currently (220x250x150) / (40T volume in rectangle 30870mm^3) =  ~270 cells 270 / 12 = 22P which is nice and crazy range 88Ah weight is 17kg :D but then if build something similar to 36Ah 12S its around 12S 9P 40T which gives 7.1kg and 1/2.5 volume current is 270A charge current is 9 * 6 = 48A so no fast charging, then price 108 cells = 5.15 * 108 = 556€. So to put everything into table:

| | Turnigy Graphene (LiPo) | 40T |
|-|---|----|
|Configuration|12S 3P 36Ah (6 x 6S 12Ah 15C)|12S 9P 40T
|Current|540A (Constant) 900A (Burst) | 315A (Constant?) 405A (Burst?)
|Volume| 4,819,122mm^3 | 3,333,960mm^3 (Not Cylindrical volume)
|Weight| 9,660g | 7,560g
|Price| 930€ (looking into getting discount to get around 600€) | 556.2€

So Li-Ion looks like a cheaper and smaller and better alternative, now to consider how much extra you will need for LiIon: Nickel (Copper maybe), Spot Welder, BMS and etc things I don't think its really worth it...

It's just my thought train maybe I am incorrect or wrong, but I think lipos are easier to handle

Nickel (Copper maybe), Spot Welde
[/quote]

Nickel or copper is not that expensive and I assume that you or your dad already have a welder for the pack you/your dad made on the other board, so that’s not into my calculation.

Besides this a quality LiIon pack get only hard out of balance so I wouldn’t worry about that so much.

I think with 3p lipo, especially the graphens you probably get a good amount of charge cycles as well so I wouldn’t put that as advantage for LiIon cells.

If you can get the lipos for 600€ than why not. But for 950€ I’d rather go the LiIon way.

Was thinking last couple of days what if I switched to something like 40T :) I decided if I switch to 40T I would want each 1P to have pretty fast balancing so I could charge and balance board to rideable state in 1.5h maximum. Also considering maybe move all electronics I wanted to put to Mark 48 to this one :) Because that linux board is still running with uptime almost of year on the table... Tracking GPS data

![image|392x86](upload://uwzDBGmO67OlI5uQByzHzC9G9kg.png) 

Here is screenshoot of my idea how to make a pack, 9 modules of 12S1P modules with balancer on top: 

![image|491x500](upload://5ZI7X2kjARQo4GWueGk9yDe0PY3.jpeg) 

In total 9 modules which would make 12S9P 36Ah 1.8kWh
