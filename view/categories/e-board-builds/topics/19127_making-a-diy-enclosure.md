Ive never made an enclosure so I have decided to make it vs. purchasing one. I will be using fiberglass resin and cloth to cover a Styrofoam plug I will be making tomorrow. I have never used fiberglass before so this should be an adventure. Of course I will document the process with pictures as I go.

Before I begin, does anyone have any advise? Feel free to mention anything I may not have thought about.

```
Use epoxy resin. 
Polyester resin will likely dissolve the styrofoam.
wax paper works well to prevent the resin from sticking to the mold.

I had a long conversation with a local who has been building R/C boats for years. According to him as long as I cover everything with clear packing tape I should be good. For resin I will be using ZPoxy as it was suggested and I ordered it a while ago and already have it.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/5/75c0d17f8c950d3ac1f09559c5e6ce8e94914aaf.jpg" width="350" height="385">

Slight change in layout. I decided to turn the batteries sideways to allow for a more narrow enclosure.

Solid fiberglass construction with cutouts and seals for the USB ports, charging port, switch, and screen on the space pack.

Could you tell us how you made it ? I've worked with fiberglass before, but i'm curious to how you've tackled this one. I don't need a detailed explanation, but a brief work strategy would certainly be appreciated!

You'll all be sad to know I lost the file for the motor cover. My backup drive died and before I had the chance to replace it (literally a week later) my internal storage drive died as well. I didn't have time to pull the 3d model files off of it either. So I lost everything. I'm sure I could easily redesign it though and I probably will. I should mention that after a few miles of riding the abs plastic around the screw shatters against the grain.I even tried 100% infill and it still died. It just can't taking the beating that sidewalk dishes out.. So next time I'll be printing them in pla and investment casting them in aluminum.

As for how I tackled it. I measured each and every one of my components, my space pack, my vescs, my reciever, and my custom low profile fuse holder. Then layed them out in my mind. Drew up a small sketch of wire routing and component placement. Then I made a 3d model of the buck that would act as the stand in for the resin and printed out. I shaved off 10mm into the bottom of my deck to give a flat surface to sit everything against. Layed  fiberglass there to bring back the strength it lost on the bottom. Then I lightly super glued the buck in place and covered everything in green painters tape. You can use other tapes it's just easier to get glass to stick to masking tape. It'll leave a sticky residue after fiberglass but that's nothing you can't clean up. I put down 3 layers of woven fiberglass and let it cure. I chose woven because it would be easier to see through when I cut the holes for everything. Then once cured I trimmed the edges. Added foam seals for everything. 3d printed up some trim rings for the ports. Added some fiberglass reinforced bodyfiller. Then the usually finishing work. I had a logo I designed for the pan but never painted it on. Decided it look clean this way.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/e/ee019971178897edfa7de7b33bfdc7d0f1877720.jpg" width="374" height="500">

360 watt hours is a bigass battery for a 38 inch pintail however I built this deck and wheel combo just for this. So I made it work. This is the test fit.

Your going to need atleast 2 layers but I would shoot for 3. Also remember that pan has to have some way to bolt onto the deck so you might want to put some resin on the bottom edge to give it a lip.

First layer is dry and hard but it really didn't form as tightly as I hoped.

I've also used really soft high compression foam (like memory foam) and weights...  works surprisingly well and kept the corners "pretty tight"...

Or you can ghetto bag it like @ninja has mentioned a *few times*...

or you can bondo/sand/paint!

I'm certainly going to end up painting the enclosure so I'm sure I'll fix the blemishes with bondo.

Be very careful with that, bondo when layed to thick will just crack off. The only bondo that should ever be used for anything structural is fiberglass reinforced bondo also known as bondo glass or kitty hair filler. There is short strand or long strand even then its smart to keep it as thin as possible. Make sure to sand down the fiberglass before you try and add filler. Bondo brand fiberglass resin in particular develops a waxy surface once cured and if you don't sand through it not only will the paint adhere poorly but that bondo will flake off in a heartbeat. Make sure to prep in between steps. Sand it down while cleaning it off periodically with alcohol or a small amount of acetone. Then clean it once more before you apply any filler or paint. For paint you can get a tough surface out of something like rustoleum textured paint and an outdoor rated primer color combo. A one stage paint is a solid option in this case since you'll be touching it up every now and then. Its going to see a lot of rock chips and scuffs lol.

After three coats of cloth and resin my enclosure is finally made. Now to clean up the high spots and prep for paint. 

Ideas for paint that will hide flaws? Plastidip? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/2/6202137275b07871cf64af02ddab94c07b009c7d.jpg" width="666" height="500">

It builds up fast and if you can heat it, it will dry like a rock.

I found it kind of by accident.  Sprayed some on a piece of metal just to see how it sprayed and forgot about it for a couple of weeks.  Came back and it was so tough I couldnt scratch it with a screwdriver.  I spray metal parts with it now and bake it in a toaster oven, low heat for a 20 minutes.  It sets up rock hard.

If your going with something thick and rubberized just go with bedliner as paint. I chose textured outdoor furniture paint with my color being shot over that.

my question is if your doing three layers of the fiberglass do you do one layer let it dry before doing the next? or can you just do three layers at once?
