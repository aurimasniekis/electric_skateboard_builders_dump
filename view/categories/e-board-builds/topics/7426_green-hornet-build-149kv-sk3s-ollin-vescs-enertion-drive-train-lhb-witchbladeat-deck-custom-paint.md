I'm wrapping this one up very soon, just waiting on a few parts to show up. A customer wanted a commuter with a lot of torque for shit streets and gravel and packed dirt paths and possibly grass and cobblestone and various other bullshit that makes street wheels less than optimal but doesn't quite enter the realm of juice sucking pneumatics. We settled on these crazy MBS 100mm wheels that seem to have taken the world by storm, or at least they can't seem to keep them in stock. This is the first of three of these kinds of builds, but by far this one is the most unique as far as detailing. The decisions for color and detail were arrived at organically once we realized that these wheels only came in green at the time. We decided that yellow should probably go with green, then of course that reminded us of hornets and so then the whole bug thing happened, right down to the stinger like point on the tail of the WithcbladeAT deck shape i designed for these wheels. 

So without further ado, i present The Green Hornet. Which also has yellow in it. A lot of yellow. And green. 

First the deck shape. I know, me and my posterboard. I suck at cad and don't have my xcarve set up for cutting out complete decks yet anyway, so its pencils and jigsaws for now.

got the deck pressed and cut out and laid on top of the trucks to see what we had. There's a point on the tail. 36.5" from nose to stinger.

i put these packs together next, took all damn day to build these three, but we got it done. Dropped down to a smaller 60amp BMS because they just fit better in the box and i have a feeling noone was ever going to see a full 80 amps anyway, despite the pack being rated at 80 continuous.

Boxes from my box guy showed up so it was time to test placement and motor mount clearance before i fucked myself by drilling holes in the wrong places:

Ordered my robot minion to carve the channels for me...

... while i went back and chopped some trucks for those enertion pulleys.

Got the SK3s ready for motor pullleys with the dremel. I got myself a new reincorced cutting wheel so that the bowl in the "flat spot" had a nice radius to keep that grub screw in place but also deep enough so that the lip i left on the shaft would keep the pulley from flying off in the event that the grub backed out a little after a while of heavy use.

Then it was on to replacing those ugly phase leads with some nice yellow ones:

and then to get the drive trains assembled after stripping the blue anodize off of those mounts and replacing it with yellow enamel:

by now the minion had long since completed the channels so it was time to bring in the deck and start the detailing and lay in the wires:

aftr cetting the wires soldered in and building a tape wall and pouring in the resin, it was time to let that crap dry and go deal with the box. I cut the holes and took it out back to paint it. I gave it the old urban spray can treatment for that fade affect. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BIwhStZhikU/?taken-by=longhairedboy

while the paint was curing on the box i went to work sanding down the cured resin and with a pencil and paint brush i did this to it:

so now it looks like it has hornet scales and once the glass was on it with the clear urethane we have this:

Internals are not yet assembled as i'm still waiting on parts, but the detailing and assembly was done as far as aesthetics, so here's what we ended up with:

Its a mad beast. I'm going to swap out the wheels with some black ones i've designated for street testing so we'll see how it handles the bullshit. I have plenty of bullshit to test it on, too. Hopefully it will take the grass and bricks and gravel and shit pretty well, but i won't know for sure untill i get it out there.

You are an artist my man.  Kudos for another beautiful build.  Were you able to use Enertions drive wheel pulley on these wheels without any modification to the wheel or pulley ?  Do you think DIY's drive wheel pulley would work on these types of wheels also ?  These wheels look interesting and I might be tempted to pick up a set depending upon how your tests go.

I guess we'll find out. I've never done a dual diag before or even ridden one, this was done for two reasons: 1) i don't have 12" trucks to fit those 6374 SK3's next to each other and 2) the customer asked for it explicitly after doing some reading. I encourage people to do a little digging and make suggestions, but if they don't i decide things for them which is often appreciated as well. Some of my peeps like to be involved more than others.

Good to know.  Thanks.  On a side note, your crushed glass grip is also amazing, I would like to do something similar to my board but using lucids grip material as i don't have a good way of safely crushing glass myself.  They sell a kit and i think their material is also glass in a shaker.  What do you think of it and have you experimented with it before ?  Just curious on what your thoughts are on that, if its not too off topic here.

i have not tried that. I basically did some reading on reclaimed glass grip for skateboards and i did come across that. But after seeing what they used and how they used it, i just did some experimenting and found my own way. 

I should be wearing a mask in this but i'm not, mostly because i'm a dumbass. I usually do wear a paper mask.

after that i sift it through a couple of strainers i got at the grocery store that have different screen grades in them and take what's left after the chunks get caught in the first screen and the dust falls through the second one.

some of you may have been around in the community long enough to know that this whole thing started because i wanted to build decks and boxes for DIY esk8 builds. Unfinished decks and grey boxes with plenty of room for whatever that can be mounted and painted any way you want because you do it yourself, optionally with wire channeling.

i'd love to do a carvon build. I just wish their hub drive systems weren't quite so expensive, it makes working them into a price model almost pointless because people start to ask questions and ultimately decide on belts instead because of the price tag and torque availability. At least that's what has happened so far for me.

And yes, I am trying to kill my customers. Lord Skatan demands blood!

This board won't be so fast because of all the green and yellow. I tried to convey that to the customer, and even explained that you really don't even need batteries or motors if you can get it red enough because it will basically be constantly moving on its own. I have a particular shade of Minwax stain I mix called Superpositional Red that essentially puts you in every mathmatically conceivable location at once so that you're basically everywhere and then somewhere you need to be, sort of like Infinite Improbability drive, except more quantum and easily applied with a brush.  But that seemed to present a different set of issues for them, so here we are.

@longhairedboy whaddya mean by that? curious because these wheels look like they're a better option than the [ones I have already](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/STEADFAST-Offroad-Wheels-Set-113mm-80a-incl-Mounting-Riserpads-Longboard-/282068676284) because i could use an enertion pulley.. but those little round things just below the dremel look like you've chopped something!?

Enertion pulley has its own bearing so you have to cut about 7mm off the caliber trucks in order to get the axle nut on.

@longhairedboy would you mind sharing the vesc settings for this build? what size diameter are those all terraing wheels? 
been riding my esk8 (the cosmic dust) for about 3 weeks now im in love with it, when i first got my vesc i went with the preloaded recommended settings i would like  to adjust all the parameters to where the board is super reliable and still perform but i would like to understand why im changing those parameters not just change it cuz others did too and the amount of info to take is overwhelming 
basically my builds is 4 x 3s 8000mah 30c, vesc, 83mm wheels, 16/36 gearing/ 6374 149kv sk3

i just got my hands on a couple of those winning remotes. I'm not sure how i feel about them yet. They definitely feel good in the hand, but the throttle feels funny to me. 

Also if anyone switches from a steeze to a winning make sure the board's wheels are off the ground before you power it on and go into the VESC to adjust the PPM settings for the new remote. Steeze threshold settings are such that when used with a winning the board will want to launch as soon as the receiver fires up. Totally different beasts, that need totally different settings. That was my experience with the two i tried out anyway.

Here's a video of me chopping an enertion truck to fit an evolve pulley in a geniune ABEC 11 flywheel. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6V4nBUFeYk

the principle is the same, like @Jinra said you take off about 7mm of aluminum for the Enertion pulleys because the bearings in those sit flush with the bearings in your wheel, so the width of a bearing is what you remove, and maybe another 1mm for an extra speed ring if you want to give it some breathing room. 

I prefer insert pulleys with bearings because things just stay centered and belts last longer because of it. That being said, i've grown very comfortable with chopping trucks for my personal builds which require calibers in multiple colors. 

In fact if anyone wants their trucks chopped for insert pulleys let me know, it doesn't take long and i won't charge much for the service plus shipping back to you. all i need is the hanger, the pulleys, and the wheels you want to use them with so i can be 100% on fitment.

ok so i just wanted to report back after doing some late night street testing that i'm sure irritated my neighborhood in general. 

If anyone is interested in doing an MBS build with 149KV SK3s at 12S on a 14/36 ratio, let me tell you a something: Its a match made in heaven. 

These wheels are soft. I didn't think to look at the durometer, but damn. They absorb so much road rattle. the contact patch is kind of thin because of the domed profile of the wheel, which makes them kind of light on their toes while on the street, but they don't seem to lose traction or anything like that. They carve pretty hard. 

they give fuck-all about short grass, acorns, sticks, packed dirt, small grassy hills, super shitty sidewalks, cheese-grater streets, muddy crap transitions, packed gravel, dirt roads, or really anything of that nature. In my opinion they are ideal commuter wheels for all of those reasons. If you're lucky enough to have smooth pavement and clean sidewalks, obviously street wheels are better. but if you're in an urban environment with shit streets and connecting dirt pathways, these wheels are the bomb. 

They have almost no traction in wet grass, though. While this board had no issue going up an almost 30% grade packed grass hill, they spun out quite a lot becuase it was damp. 

This weekend i'll try to cap some video of this thing going from street to sidewalk to park lawn with no issue. Its just really hard to capture that kind of footage at one in the morning. 

The only issue is its kind of hard to stay on it while its rocketing through a bunch of bumps since it has no foot straps, but i think foot straps would be overkill for this kind of AT-Crossover type build. Its not limited to streets but its certainly not a pneumie mountain board build. 

my son was following me around on the rat board while i was doing this stuff.  I splashed through puddles and plowed through broken gravely pavement and over fallen sticks and palm fronds and crap in the mall parking lot, then it was time to go home. But Rat's battery died so we tucked his phase leads and i towed him home. 

It gave no shits about towing him all the way back home back accross all that shitty pavement and up a few decent hills. 

It has some top end but i'm not sure how much yet. I suspect somewhere between 25 and 30mph just based on the throttle response i was seeing last night. And the new Witchblade AT deck was carving deep and very pleasant to ride. 

So after all that i need to repaint the box after notching some "wheel wells" for the motor mounts. They come closer to the box than i would like, so i'm going to make some dips in the box flange to eliminate any potential contact. 

No moisture at all in the components. The bag like seal I've been using seems to work out very well to keep the water from spraying in, and once the box is on with clear silicone sealant there won't be anywhere for water to get into, so i think this beast might be light rain proof at that point, except for the remote.

The torque coming from those 149s man... its kind of ungodly. I was initially a little worried about running 36t pulleys on 100mm wheels.. but damn i feel silly now. 

We'll see how the enertion 190s do at the same ratio on the same wheels soon enough. I've got two.. possibly  three more builds similar to this coming up. 

one of them is gonna be loaded up with EL wire.

Hi, that's the kind of esk8 I need to ride around the place I live! That's the reason I'm not totally satisfied with my pre-built, I need an esk8 that can tackle other terrains besides smooth bike lanes or roads.

Your technique for getting off the esk8 is kind of particular. :grinning:

Either way, excellent work with this build. You're the man. :)

Would anybody happen to know how to reach speeds of 40 mph+ without sauntering? If so I would love to know.😁👍🏻😄

What if I was to use 12s, and a 240ish kv motor?

I like the build, the looks, and the idea of what it is made to handle.

Actually, thanks very much for the suggestion! I just read an article where some one suffered a traumatic brain injury going around 20.

Is a 50 mm 270 kv the same as a 63mm 270 kv?

63mm is the diameter of the motor. 50mm is a little smaller. Larger motors give more torque. 
Also please do some reading and look at other peoples' builds.

nice ending lmao.  That board is seriously sick, it's completely sunk in grass and still going!

That surpasses the VESC ERPM limit by 60kv. I would recommend 149kv-170kv at 12s. Anything higher is very dangerous.

Foot straps woulda save you from that fall at the end there :slight_smile:

Foot straps are a very bad idea lol.  It looks like it would give you more stability but it doesn't.  And it's way more dangerous, you want to be able to hop off and freely move your feet.

190 kV is the max I'd do, i have that set up and does great with Chaka VESCs.

Gonna have to disagree with you there my friend. I thought the same too until I tried on another esk8 with foot straps without the ankle strap during a meet up in ny. I was able to carve harder and going over cracks and potholes was easier since my feet was strap to the board. Problem with esk8 is that we're not going to run off the momentum if we go faster than 10mph, you're either going to trip or fall forward. Being strap to the board also gives you the option of breaking harder without worrying about falling off the board, then again leaning backward helps too. 

Not that I'm advocating for straps on all eboard, I can totally see the detrimental sides of it too, but the pros are too good not to consider them too.

I guess if that's your style.  I change my footing on my lhb like every 2 mins.  It's different for going fast and different for carving.  I would get so much fatigue too on long rides if I'm strapped in one position.

there were times when i wanted foot straps on this board. But then i decided that all things considered, these particular builds (i have two more coming just like it in black) aren't actual off road boards. Not like knobby tired pneumie based mountain boards, anyway. These are more of a different class, like the RAV4 is to the SUV  class. I'm calling these boards AT Crossovers because they've still got so much street in them (very fast) and they can really only do hard packed soil with grass seemingly irrelevant as long as the soil is hard enough. They lose traction easily in wet grass and ground cover on slopes, and in loose dirt they dig in and bury the wheels. 

but on packed trails, dirt transitions, train tracks, busted sidewalks, losse gravel on asphault, all stuff you would find on a real world commute, these boards give no shits. In this video, you can see very clearly see all of the shits it does not give where just regular grown-over stick and rock filled ground is concerned:

I'm curious about the vibration on these wheels. Looks like it would be worse than regular thanes.

on the street it seems like there's less vibration than the regular 83mm wheels i usually use. It feels a bit smoother. They look like they would sound funny but they don't really. Also they're kind of soft, 78a, so that helps a little. 

Hard to tell off road though. lol

Love the dismount!
