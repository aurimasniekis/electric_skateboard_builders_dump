I have basically the same motors on my riptide. 
I've got about 5 inches worth of room for motors. 
So width wise looks like you have enough room.

I literally just put loctite on all my pulleys and bolts yesterday or I'd measure bolt pattern for you. 
Im sure @dickyho knows the measurements.

I don't have time to look what information they have listed on their site but they're basically the same motors or at least the same bolt pattern as

So how did this go? I got lucky and my boosted motors are in working condition but theyre probably going to go eventually :man_shrugging:
