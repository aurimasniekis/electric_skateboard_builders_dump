Hi Guys,

I just built my first board using info I learned from this forum.  I love it!  Using the newest revision of parts from DIYEboard (faster, more reliable, better QC) , but was able to build it all for under $700.  I've hit 30-31 mph top speed on a flat ( I weigh 143lbs) and there was a bit more to go but I got scared.  The furthest I've gone is 18 miles and still had 43% battery left.  Here is the parts list

Bushings - Paris/Diyeboard Barrel to Barrel Mix
Bearings - BONES REDS
Wheels - Abec 11 flywheels 90mm 75a
Trucks - Paris Baseplates/Diyeboard Hangars
Deck - Bustin Robot 41"
Wheel Pulley - Diyeboard 35T/13T
Motor mount - DIYeboard Dual belt drive kit
Belt - Diyeboard 12mm
Motor Pulley - Diyeboard 35T/13T
Enclosure - Diyeboard 10s5p enclosure
Controller - 2.4Ghz V.2 Electric Remote control
ESC - Diyeboard V2.1 ESC
Motor - Dual 5055 270kv

Hi guys,

I wanted to share a video my friend and I took while cruising the boardwalk yesterday.  We were having fun with an e-biker.  Starting at about 2:00 minutes, I accelerate up a hill then do a long stretch top speed run up a small hill, shows you the power of this board.  Go pro footage of my tail wind and my friends front view.  

Board Reference:

Friend: Evolve Carbon GT 91mm ABEC 11 Top Speed 26mph
Me : DIYEboard 10S5P Belt Kit - 90MM Top Speed 30+

@Benihana Did you have to do any mods to get the ABEC 11 90mm on that kit from DIYEBoard?

No, they are a direct replacement and fit without any issue.

Still running good.  I just upgraded to the new 4 speed remote that I have yet to try out, but it will help with the speed disparity going from level 1 to level 2.

NIce build but what brought the price of this board to $695 dollars? Excluding the board itself, the same dual motor kit, 2 3000 mah 6s lipo batteries, and esc/ controller kit from diyeboards it came to about 325 shipped.

This is the kit that I purchased: http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-360wh-battery-esc-dual-motor-belt-drive-power-truck-kit-p-590.html .  

This is my cost breakdown:

Bearings - BONES REDS $20
Wheels - Abec 11 flywheels 90mm 75a $90
Trucks - Paris Baseplates/Diyeboard Hangars $25
Deck - Bustin Robot 41" $70
DIYeboard Dual belt drive kit $468

468+20+90+25+70 = $673 + I purchased extra belts and replacement drive shaft bearings.  i already replaced 3 belts since I purchased it.

@Benihana Thank you for the information! I recently bought the same kit from diyeboard and my question is if I can use the orangatang kegel wheels with the 10s5p kit from diyeboard? I was thinking about buying the kegel wheel pulleys
