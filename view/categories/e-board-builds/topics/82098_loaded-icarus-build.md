Dual 6355, FOCBOX, 10S4P Samsung 30Q, I also used 3D printed molds to make the fiberglass enclosures. There are 23 addressable LED's on the front and back risers, and I plan on programming them as brake lights and headlights so people can see me before then run me over at night lol. Let me know if yall have any questions or comments. I am using an ATTINY85 to control the LED's and a 5V SBEC to power the LED's.
