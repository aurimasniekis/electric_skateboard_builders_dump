I used only 17.76% of power because it's madness
Maximum power 5000W
Energy recovery during braking
Two inverters controlled by microprocessor (VESC Plate design by Benjamin Vedder)
Two brushless three-phase motors
Range depends on many factors 8 - 10 km but I have a pack of batteries in the backpack for change
