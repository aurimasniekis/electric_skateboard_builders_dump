First and foremost, I have @Gaz, a 'mate' of mine to 'thank' for getting me into this tangled web of eSk8 and for introducing me to yet another hobby that consumes a huge amount of time, money, patience, frustration, and most importantly, sheer enjoyment. This build has been nearly a year in the making, due to both my isolated location and spare time. I originally had a thread going over here (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/addicted-first-build-here-we-go/44387) but figured I'd tidy it up an little and put up a build thread to bring it all together. After a lot of deliberation, I opted to start the build with a Trampa Urban Carver board. My only intention for this board was to use it completely off-road so I needed a board with good clearance and big tyres. I was fortunate enough to be around when the group buy was offered by @scepterr for the Dark Matter motors and I picked up 2 of them. The natural progression was to then get one of the indestructible enclosed drive units from @Nowind. I love the fact that  they are a sealed drive and there is NO WAY of any sticks, rocks, etc getting in the way. I was also fortunate to be around with the group buy for the ESCapes, from @stewii and I picked up 2 of these and then put them into the dual enclosure from @LukePL. The battery pack (including BMS) was built for me by @Marsen and this went into the enclosure from @Eboosted. 
When I started the build I was a little pedantic with everything, but, towards the end, I got a little impatient and started to 'slap' things together as you'll see with the pics that show the mounting for the enclosure. This leads me to the name for this post..........Great Northern: I live up North, but I also drink a beer called Great Northern. Bush Pig: That's a term usually used for something rough and ugly and they also live around me (the real ones). I figured this board was an electronic version of a Bush Pig. Anyway, onto the pics........

_This box holds the dual ESCapes, remote Rx and bluetooth module. I have a flush mount LED battery meter on the side. The box was originally mounted to the deck with Duo Loc velcro, but it comes loose on the rough tracks so I use a zip tie to help hold it  as well. Just adds to the 'bush pig' look._

_Baby's got back!_


**_Note_**: This was my first build and if I were to do this again I would change a few things. Firstly, I'd go with a LaCroix deck from @Arch and I'd also be using the MBS trucks, especially now that @Nowind makes a drive system to suit those trucks.

Thanks man. Yep, the battery is back and I'm set to ride. Gotta say that the service from @Marsen is exceptional. He's a real knowledgeable guy and also has a passion for eSk8. So good to have someone like that here in Australia as trying to get a battery built here in Australia was probably one of the hardest parts of this build.

Glad to see the finished build bro :sunglasses:! Did you already ride it?

Also recognized the new ATB hanger in front, nice.

Just a question, is this your sensor wire?

![imageC|690x342](upload://bZCeOvzCGxLSd72nuvdO9hmY2k5.jpeg) 

Looks like it's too tight and you could damage it while turning. Also make sure the cables won't touch the motors.

If the wires are long enough you could route them at the hanger and route them up in the middle where the kingpin is, then you have almost no stress on the cables. The sensor wires you could extend or use extensions. And add wire mesh. I know it's a lot of work (especially when you have a running board) but maybe on the next update.

On my board I use threaded inserts with rubber washers between to hold my enclosures.

[/quote]

Yeah man, that's the sensor wire. Thanks for pointing this out, and also for the recommendations. I'll go over the wiring today and see if I can improve things a little. 
The board is running. I'm still playing with the settings for the ESCapes. Doesn't seem to have enough 'power' for even tiny hills. Batt max is 45 and if I increase that any more, then the ESC gets a little hot. Motor max currently 70. If I understand correctly, I can go up to 120 for the motor max, but I can't really go any higher with the batt max.
```

---
## \#19 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-11-03T21:22:56.633Z Reads: 83

```
Yes you are correct about the settings. Batt max can be increased as long as the battery/bms can handle it. Due to the lovely alu heatsink case I reckon 60a batt is possibly if the battery is capable. You can also just monitor the temp to see if it gets too hot. 

If that doesnâ€™t seem to fix the problem you could try motor max settings or changing the gear ratio a little.

Edit: just checked and I would be very careful as you are currently at the limits of your battery in terms of output. The 30q is rated for 20a and in 4p you can pull 80a max cont. Your set for 45a so I wouldnâ€™t personally go any higher as you run the risk of over current damage if you draw max current for a bit longer than expected (like in a hill or dirt track)
```

## \#20 Posted by: ArnhemAnt Posted at: 2018-11-03T21:54:10.881Z Reads: 76

```
Thanks for the advice. I'll drop the batt max back to 40 and then play with the numbers for the motor max to see if that helps with the hills. What has me baffled is that other similar builds claim to have no issues with hills and yet seem to run pretty similar numbers to my current settings. I'm only 67kg so it can't be my weight that is slowing me down.

Maybe it's the 1:4 gearing combined with 190kv motors (you could win top speed races). I'm no expert in motors but higher kv needs more ampere to get the same torque compared to lower kv motors.

Do you have a bluetooth module? Would be interesting to see some telemetry data.

I have about the same motor/batt max settings and get enough power with 1:5 gearing and 149kv motors. For 1:4 gearing on 8" wheels I would personally choose 120-130kv motors.

Definitely won't go up the hill from a standing start. With just a small incline (over stones/gravel) the board almost stops towards the top of the small incline.

I have a bluetooth module so I'll try and get some stats when I go for a decent ride.

Not sure if it is the gear ratio. I have run 97mm wheels with a 2:1 ratio on dual 6355s which is the equivalent to 200mm and 4:1 and not had any hill climbing issues.

I also think some telemetry data would be a good idea. 

@ArnhemAnt if itâ€™s already set to 15k thatâ€™s a bit high but I guess it canâ€™t be the main cause of the problem. Iâ€™d just set it back down to 2k anyway. I would also try upping motor max to 80a.

Finally also make sure wheels are at about 50psi

Thanks man, this has definitely improved things. I guess, as @rich said above, the higher Kv motors need more Amps to get the same amount of torque. I'll keep the motor max at 80A for the time being and then gradually work it up a little higher if I need to. 

Now, its time to go have a little more fun........

Those are the stock settings.
As they higher than what your motors can, this values donâ€™t restrict you.
You can change it but you donâ€™t need.
You set motor max and min value which will restrict your powe output too.
Just wanted to be sure itâ€™s not 1000watt or lower.

It is now set at 2000W max and -2000W min.

I've also just ordered a small micro USB adapter cable so that I don't have to keep opening the darn enclosure to connect the ESCapes to the laptop so that if I need to change settings like this again, it won't be such a PITA.

I have an app on my iPhone but it doesn't allow me to make a lot of changes - not like the ESC tool on the laptop.

Thought I'd give a quick update on this build. After ironing out a few things, this board is a monster. I've reached a top speed of 40klm with a lot more left in the controls, but that speed was enough for me. I've also changed dampas and moved from the yellow, to the green in both front and rear and have these screwed down pretty tight. This still allows me to carve with ease, yet feels a little more stable at speeds up to 40klm. I'm going to continue fiddling with the dampas and will probably end up with red in the rear and green in the front - not sure just yet.
The mounting for the enclosure has failed and the inserts have threaded. This is because some of the screws had worked themselves loose and moved 'up and down' within the insert. This has then sanded the thread so I can't use the screws anymore. No big problem. I just used bolts and nyloc nuts instead. Certainly not as 'pretty' as the original method, but the bolts and nuts have not come loose at all.
Oh, and this thing EATS hills. I've just come back from a family holiday on Magnetic Island, off the coast of Townsville and there are a lot of hills around the place. My board had absolutely no problems with any of the hills over there and I was actually accelerating up the hills. I've currently got the motor max at 70 and my brakes are also at 70 because I found I needed that extra brake when going back downhill.
I love this board and am so glad that I went through the frustrations to get it to this stage.

There will always be some small things to fiddle out or improve, but thatâ€™s just for fun ðŸ˜…
If you donâ€™t find a right dampa constellation you could try your luck with elastomer damper, but I guess red green or red yellow will already give you a good result! Keep on riding ðŸ˜œ
