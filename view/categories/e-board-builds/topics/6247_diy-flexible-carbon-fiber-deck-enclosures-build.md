Last project, I noticed some people are very interested in a flexible,Vanguard like CF deck. Also,I am very curious to see if it's even possible. 

Ideas.
1)No Concave/Curved edges: It gives only stiffness(0 flex before). It 'll be flat.
2)No Core materials: Adding air(Foam) possibly causes a stress inside over time from the flex.
3)Using only Carbon Fiber layers with Resin. It's going to be heavy,possibly more than a wood deck.

8 Layers of Non Crimp Carbon Fiber 24k 18oz/ 610gsm
4 Layers of Carbon Fiber Fabric Quadaxial 90/+45/-45/0 Degree 12k 815gsm
4 Layers of Carbon Fiber Cloth Fabric Veil Chopped Mat .20oz 7gsm

Pros:More durable, last longer. (Example: Trampa style) adding more layers as you desire for stiffness.
Cons:More cost and weight(expecting twice heavier than 5mm CF deck)

Goals.
9-10mm thickness to achieve Flex 2.  

I 'll start with the mold for the Deck.

Non Crimp Carbon Fiber 50" 24k 18oz/ 610gsm is a fabric essentially made of two layers of uni directional carbon fiber stitched together at 0°/90° The deck will bend in one direction most of time this will add stiffness effectively.

Possible problem:
The resin can flow over the top but the bottom laminate lags a long way behind due to the tight packing and slow wet out of the unidirectional carbon fiber.


Carbon Fiber Cloth Fabric Veil Chopped Mat 35.5" .20oz 7gsm

This will help resin flow to the bottom.

The mold is ready. This has slight compound curves.The clean finish will be on the road side.

PVA release agent applied. WAX works too. I was too lazy to apply 4-5 times. PVA should be good enough(just one apply)

wow, you are quick, everything done and sanded - really beautiful and looks quite like a vanguard! for a cruiser and the chamber its probably too stiff though - when you stand on the vanguard, the camber levels out and you wobble away around that point. its like negative travel on car/motorbike suspension!

Yeah, it's too stiff for my weight.   I didn't spend much time to polish,  I was little  anxious to check the flex. I think 7mm to 8mm should be ideal.

@MasterCho This is a fantastic thread, thank you for documenting your progress ... I'm learning a lot from it. I have a few questions, if you have the time ...

- How many plies did you end up doing? At the start you said you were thinking of doing 8 plies (4 Layers of Carbon Fiber Fabric Quadaxial 90/+45/-45/0 Degree 12k 815gsm, and 4 Layers of Carbon Fiber Cloth Fabric Veil Chopped Mat .20oz 7gsm). Is this what you ended up doing?

- How thick did the board end up being? Looks like it's close to you initial estimate of 9mm - 10mm. 

- Do you think it's heavier than an equivalent 8 ply wooden board? I guess most of the weight is the epoxy,  but it's hard to imagine it being heavier than a wooden board. 

Thanks again for sharing your experiments with us!

Yes, it went with the plan. It's 9mm thick 42 "long.

Yes, it's heavy as I expected, twice heavier than a wood deck. I wanted to try "The vacuum press(thin plastic bag)vs The machine press(Trampa)" to see if there is any weight difference, I suspect that the machine press might be squeezing more resin out to make it lighter but an adequate resin needs to be fed in order to achieve the strength and so on.

During the infusion process, I noticed that way more resin had been fed than I thought it would be, and thought the electric vacuum pump wasn't able to handle the thickness,but the outcome is rather satisfying.

CF 9mm  42"long deck stiff  weight 2.5kg(5.5lbs)
Tampa 35"long deck weight (2.2 to 2.5kg)

Curious to know how thick the trampa board is.

@onloop they are using some kind of fiber-reinforced cloth(possibly woven fiberglass cloth) but definitely not carbon otherwise it gets too expensive to make for the thickness.

Time to update.
I have been looking for an alternative materials to duplicate the flex that achieved with full/pure carbon materials but to reduce the cost and weight. I think I found the solution.

Thanks for the tip from@KMeyerson that going with Hybrid option using bamboo veneer.

So here it is.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/f/bf43461272857b5acc60bc479fa0f57f7a35280c.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Initially, I was little worried that wood could get wet with resin and becomes hard solid wood but once I got the piece, noticed that bamboo seems very high density wood so it shouldn't be a problem with one layer of clear coat to prevent it.

http://www.roarockit.com/skateboard-building/veneer/bamboo/bamboo-veneer-20-pack/#.V9G68ZgrJaQ
I used 2 layers of bamboo veneers as core then used carbon cloth on the top and bottom.

Yeah,I am about 150 lb. can't wait to ride on it :grinning:
The enclosures might be too long for the flex I hope NOT. I am planning to have 50 cells in it(10s5p) for the longer ride.

By the way, I picked up new tesseract. It's beautiful. I guess it will be a longboard for my Son. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/3/d35edbfa7485377c671c4a68dcb0e2571f3e7aff.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/c/2ce3e662225e9fdeaaff70b5c8e988f6f5d1f58c.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Not cheap, but the materials they used is very interesting to me.
 The board material is a fiberglass with epoxy skins. These are sandwiched between two layers of bamboo cores which are vertically laminated,It has some flex but stiff. 

The most interesting is the bottom of the board has been laminated with a nice cork layer. It is supposed to have shock damping capabilities. We will find out.

Mastercho I'm finally getting close to doing an infusion with divinycell80 core and am wondering how many layers of triaxial Carbon to use for top and bottom.  I forget the weight of what I have now but generally what would u recommend of what weight or do u have any other general advice? 

 I got 3m 77 spray to hold the fabric in place and will do it around the edges of the core with the carbon as apposed to how I always see people cutting the center of the mold out of overlayed fabric in generally in on plane

Or better yet how many layers of what weight is ur board made of?

I spent 2 months looking for a pot or pan big enough (40"x12") to thermoform the core and gave up and am doing multiple layers now of thinner stuff which will be able to bend in the mold.

Really like the bamboo core you did.  Can u cut each veneer with the exacto?

@Hummie
For the stiff deck.I would use

1 Layers of Carbon Fiber Cloth Fabric Twill 3k  as cosmetic purpose.
2-3 Layers of Carbon Fiber Fabric Quadaxial 90/+45/-45/0 Degree 12k 815gsm for top and bottom
Plus the core material. 

If you go with 18oz/ 610gsm I would use 3-4 layers each side.
[quote="Hummie, post:25, topic:6247"]
have any other general advice?
[/quote]

The challenge I have when I'm bagging is to make sure the bag is absolutely sealed. (I sometimes just can't find the leak) Otherwise, you will have tiny pinholes which will weaken the board. I would do the leak test before the infusion.   
[quote="Hummie, post:25, topic:6247"]

[/quote]

I do trim the accessed fabric as well so that the bagging film is flush with the edge of the mold as a barricade to slow the resin flow from reaching the spiral vacuum tube.

[quote="Hummie, post:25, topic:6247"]

4 lbs
*1 layer    Carbon/200gsm
*4 layers  Carbon18oz/ 610gsm 
*1 layer    Fiberglass DBM 1808 Knytex Biaxial 610.31gsm  sandwiched between two layers of bamboo veneer. 
* 2 layers  1/16 Bamboo veneers 

[quote="Hummie, post:25, topic:6247"]

 Yes.The bamboo is very fragile to handle until it is laminated so I was careful. There was another step I didn't mention (no picture)was that I sliced the bamboo veneer after the cut for the resin flow.
Looks like this.

Mad props sir. I was gonna make a CF deck, but i didn't know if it was possible to make one without a foam core. I have a Hi5ber deck with a foam core that I don't use. It's really stiff, and i don't like riding it. Your deck looks much nicer.

Thank you for the kind words. :slight_smile:

I tried using a foam /honeycomb core with CF, after 20 minutes of riding it,I missed my old wood deck for some reason. Since then I have been developing flexible CF deck. The bamboo veneers help get the flex you want without sacrificing so much expensive CF cloth and epoxy resin(weight) but not as strong as the pure/full carbon,though.

following the amazing idea of mastercho, I also made a plexiglas construction thats quite versatile and I modelled the loaded vanguard concave and camber quite like the original. :slight_smile:

not sure if I can actually press bamboo in this construction too or just mainly fibers. thought about making a tranlucent glas board for example. :scream: 

the glas surface is very sturdy - 5mm thick. I think Ill try to laminate a bamboo board with that under vacuum!

Probably not the CF deck, otherwise the price will be a sky rocket ship.  Fiberglass will be ideal just like Trampa board, the hardest part is to cut it in that size.    I am getting a 42 inch CNC Router soon, stay tuned.

Is there a particular reason why you would prefer 35 degrees?

yea, pressed the base deck for my long distance europe tourer! riding it manually since a few months, seems to work great, so in spring it will probably become my new 100km range 2WD tourer!

phone mixed up order, cba to copy paste sort the pictures .. ;)

Dude, that looks really great! I was under the impression that you were going to infuse cf cloth, which I am currently practicing. I'm starting by making battery supports, and when I think I've got the method down, I'm gonna attempt some decks

the cruiser will be all bamboo and glas only, the enclosures will be glass only - reason is reception and maintenance. i want to use the board for a really long tour all around europe in the summer and being able to actually see all wires/connections will help trouble shooting should anything happen!

I have a 4x8 ft cnc router that I could use to cut one out for you if you're willing to pay for shipping. If you send me the profile you want to cut, it would be fairly fast to clamp down n cut.

@MasterCho as I mentioned in my other thread, I am planning to infuse a deck and I am going for the level of flex in your bamboo hybrid. Do you think that this will be enough fabric?

5 layers of biaxial +/- 45 105gsm 
3 layers of 2x2 12k 192 gsm spread tow
1/4 oak strips as core, similar to the method in this easycomposits video 
https://youtu.be/s2aS1G6yp-4

With a slight compound curve, would you think that is sufficient for structural integrity? Maybe need more fabric?

That's about total 700 gsm plus 1/4 oak strips as a core.  It'll be around 7-8mm thick, it might be ok depending on the concave it has but I would suggest adding few more layers to be sure.

@MasterCho Quick question, would using a few layers of **CARBON FIBER FABRIC BIAXIAL +45/-45 DEGREE 24K 810GSM/23.89OZ 50"** work other than **CARBON FIBER FABRIC QUADAXIAL 90/+45/-45/0 DEGREE 12K 815GSM/24.04OZ 50"**. I wanted to ask because im planing on building a board but the Quadaxial has been out of stock for a while and I'm becoming impatient.

it gets too expensive with all CF,  you can use Fiberglass DBM 1808 Knytex Biaxial +/- 90 Degree Fabric instead.

I'm going to use lamination for ease, and I was thinking about using a [CF Polyester Resin](https://compositeenvisions.com/silmar-249a-carbon-fiber-polyester-resin-with-hardener-mekp-ddm-9-535.html), but I might change because I don't think I'll be using CF anymore. I'll put a like to what I was going to use though.

I used 2xLantor Soric(4mm) and 6 layers of Fiberglass DBM 1808 Knytex Biaxial +/- 90 Degree Fabric.

 I get the perfect result as the strength and flex wise.

I've never heard of Lantor Soric before. Looks like it would be an interesting material to work with.
