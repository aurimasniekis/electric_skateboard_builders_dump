Hello guys i almost finished my electric skate :smiley:

I have set the FOC for the vesc ... and build the insenssial for make a run, and work perfectly :smiley:
 
I just need put some paper fish and put some thermal adhesive tape, and change my BMS, all this stuff is coming, maybe 1 week, or 2 week.

Calm down, i just drive 10 meters, and I have Heat shrink for separate the batteries (provisory fisher paper)

some picturs:

II don't know why, but the most of people, prefer put the motor inside the board, but mine go outside, i can put more high, and this make, i have more distance between the floor and the motor

Nice build you've got and good that you have chosen a Vesc!
The motor mount that you are using has some records of breaking quickly so if that happens to you this motor mount I can recommend for you (im using it also)

i know, the mount is famous for break fast, but i buy before know that.but i have another one, the mount took more than two month for arrive,and i asked a refund, and paid a second, and 3 month after the first order arrive XD so i have 2 for a price at 1.

If break, i have to see a another mount.

looking good, but the round trucks seems to be a little harder to "clamp" onto for the motor mount. Might want to look into welding it to the trucks.

i think many people use the caliber styled trucks as it is easier to clamp as compared to round trucks like paris

Ya you are right, the caliber dont have this problem,i didn't buy caliber because, i didn't know if the mount will be to close to the board... I tightened hard, it looks very fixed, my problem is, this mount looks weak.

if you buy caliber trucks i think @dickyho do have some inexpensive mounts.
