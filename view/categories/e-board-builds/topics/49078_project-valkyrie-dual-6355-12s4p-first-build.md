Hey gang, working on my first build and I wanted to start recording progress (however slow it may be). 

Right now I have all to the below mocked up, need to start buying the actual electric parts now. ![image|375x500](upload://74nzY0zHHhOTBeAkMp908FXJORh.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://7AxNMFBMn6ZBbeXQXI3DVWHLU0R.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://8zptTecHkvTntt8yUmXlrlkS61L.jpeg)

*if anyone knows how to flip pictures on this forum please let me know. Every time I upload a pic it comes up like this.*

I’m a little torn on the electronics so any input the community has is more than welcome.

Battery wise I want a 12s4p and have talked to Ernesto (of Caly) about potentially building one for me. I’ve been reading up on how to spot weld the whole thing together but if I’m not confident in my abilities I don’t want to mess with a curtail component. 

*edit* just pre-ordered two FOCBOXs from longhairedboy 

For motors I’m looking at Maytechs too. I can fit 6355s so that’s the plan but I haven’t decided on the red 190kv units that look a little too open to the elements for my liking or the 170kv water proof units. Open to suggestions here. 

Gearing would be determined after I land on which kv (170 or 190) 

Right now it’s looking like I’m going to run a 12mm belt through the ideler set up on my mounts.

Remote will likely be a TB micro 

Haven’t decided on a BMS, Voltage meter, or On/Off switch yet

Goals for the board are to be able to do 12-15miles on a single charge and get up to around 30mph.

Open to all criticism and input as this is my first build.

Go with a bestech bms. I’m sure there is some group buy or someone u can buy from on the forum. 
I would personally go with 190kv if you are looking for 30mph. Check out @JLabs website. He has some nice motors that are pretty protected for good prices. If u are going with 190kv I would use a 36/16 ratio or 36/15. 12mm drivetrain is good for a dual setup but I am not sure if @JLabs motors would fit together on one truck. You would have to ask him.

I flip the pictures with gimp before uploading them.  Also, for some reason the forum cannot deal with portrait-oriented photos, they all have to be landscape orientation.

On off switch u could use an xt90 anti spark, verdders anti spark. I think @goldenHusky sells those. There are also the AN150 anti spark bullet connectors as well. If ur willing to spend $60 u could also buy an on off switch from @torqueboards

Not to ruin your hopes but I went the exact same build for my first time or had different iterations and let tell u having the middle not cleared leaving space for flex like a boosted board its no fun I went with lipos first having space for the middle it was fun just a all around fun commuter but once I put a 12s4p under it it was no fun the board had 0 to little flex and It weird , so if u want to put a 12s4p go with a stiff deck

He could double stack the batteries towards the front.  That would retain the flex.  I saw he had 107mm wheels.  Might need a slight rise is all.

Yeah my plan was to stack the cells for sure. And yes I’ll need risers, don’t currently have any in the pics.

Worse come to worse I got this deck used on eBay for $100 so if I need to scrap and go with a different set up it’s not the end of the world.

I used to have a dual Fattail with some hefty 8000mAh 10S lipos. One reccomendation I could make would be to reduce the weight mounted to the deck as much as possible, this would likely mean using a smaller battery pack. If you need the range then of course it's not the end of the world, but I found that using such heavy components on my deck got rid of a lot of what makes the Fattails "airy" flex so appealing.

Guys what do you think about this drivetrain? Assume I still do a 12S4P:

Motor: 2x 6355 170kv 
Wheel Gear: 40
Motor Gear: 14
wheel size: 107mm
Belt: HTD325-5M

My motor mounts have idlers

ok guys I've come to a crossroads I want to keep the fl(s)exy Fattail but all the negative hype around flexy eboards has me questioning it more than ever. 

So my current thoughts are:

-Keep Fattail, just build it and if its not working out just swap to different deck. I kind of like this idea as I was always planning on building something that could be swapped to another deck "easily"

-Buy Arbor Highground: https://www.ebay.com/itm/ARBOR-Longboard-Deck-HIGHGROUND-36-GT-ICON-DOWNHILL/362135163668?_trkparms=pageci%3Aed7c9a1a-2c4d-11e8-9789-74dbd1805a9d%7Cparentrq%3A43e32c611620ad4b37117aeefff5672f%7Ciid%3A1&_trksid=p2481888.c100675.m4236
Theres a sale right now on ebay so I can get one for only $70 

-buy DB coreflex crossbow (flex 3): https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/db-coreflex-crossbow-longboard-deck-flex-3
Seems like a nice in-between. I like the shape and the fact that it might still have a little mild flex to it.

For reference I have a boosted Dual+ with a modded drive gears and 97mm's to hit 25+ and love the feel of it. However, this board will be a little faster at 29+ mph

I have heard a lot of good things about the highground and I do like the asymmetricalness of it. I ride in NYC though how do you find it handles rougher pavement? I would still run the 107mm F1’s so that would probably soak up alot of it?

I'd probably run a 1/2'' shock pad too if I went the stiff downhill board route

## \#26 Posted by: mmaner Posted at: 2018-03-20T15:38:43.202Z Reads: 205

```
Im my experience it's not really the deck itself that mitigates the vibrations of rough pavement so much, but rather the wheels, shock pads and bushings.  Don't get me wrong, you will feel more vibration through a 10 ply rigid deck than 7 ply flex deck, but most 9 ply decks are pretty close.

I have some pretty rough pavement were I skate too, although not as bad as yours.  I mostly run either @psychotiller 6 shooters (numies) or 90mm 75a Abec 11 Flywheels.   Both doa  good job.  The Flywheels are better, in my opinion, with a rubber shock pads.

I run a 12s4p 30q cells with Dual 6374 107mm wheels and 16/36 gear ratio and I top out at 41mph with these gears and get 18-20 mile range riding hard most of the ride if I go easy I've gotten 30mile range and I'm a heavy guy. So I think you are under estimating your planned set up.

Small update. 

The new deck came in. So far I do like it, little worried about whet bite, already wana cut it or something. Also got the drive and wheel pulleys in, BKB pulleys are choice. Motors should be here within a week, cells show up Monday, FOCBOXs are probably less than 2 weeks away, and to try and combat the terrors of wheel bite a 1/2” rubber riser. Need to buy BMS, on/off switch, and decide if I’m spot welding this battery together or if I’m outsourcing. Also need to figure out the exact belt to run the htd325’s didn’t fit. Bought some htd375’s hope they workout. 

Where does everyone get this belts from? I found one site with a slew of 5m belts but their shipping is always $25 no matter how many you buy!

More updates and some questions:

Got motors mocked up:
![image|375x500](upload://oZGxnxdwwzforJGTzylchUiMms5.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://klPzFGhrB97fAVI6L2lvkiXeFZ6.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://jirWYLha3usbtV3moDcPgqYK4n3.jpeg)

To do so I needed to put 5 speed washers on the inside of each of the rear truck. So the question is, am I going to die because of that? I needed to for clearance reasons, the motors would touch if I didn’t. Pics of effects of 5 washers on the inside:
![image|375x500](upload://2SHUR2YO48JE3Ptp2GYF4UJENXW.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://hJRgRtSbCay15RNjj5RE5AFZm5I.jpeg)

Is that nut on there enough or are my wheels gunna fly off? 

pics of wheel pulley to motor mount clearance:
![image|375x500](upload://4h2LO4aF9rD8WICiwJOBoHd5Rn6.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://msTjHeRI2fcWUFlmZzozhgOBmJs.jpeg)

Also I got 1/2” rubber risers:
![image|666x500](upload://nKRR40BqIM415nxk5wksZ2JYdiZ.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://ikaeEoGWfTvWO04zdOCtNWyrmWj.jpeg)

All my tight clearance woes could be fixed with thinner mounts or wider trucks. I’d prefer wider trucks but the only trucks I could find wider than my 10” caliber II’s were those wide ass trampa trucks but I don’t think they’d work out for this as I think they work best with the trampa upturned front and rear mounting points. 

So to recap I’m hoping everyone could give me feedback on if I’m dumb for the 5 speed washer thing. If so what motor mounts or trucks should I get to fix it? Also where do you guys buy motor keys? The maytech motors didn’t come with any...

Other notes: I’ve got the Samsung cells, mini controller, and  dual focbox mount. The focboxs are currently in transit, as are some longer belts to go with the idler set up. 

Need to buy:
 BMS, charger, fuses, motor keys, power button and battery indicator.

It doesn’t look like the threads are making it to the nylon inside the nut. If not then that will come off with vibrations, either get slim nylon lock nuts or flip that nut around so it goes through the nylon first.

I still have one speed washer between the nut and bearing on the outside of the wheel. I 100% need that right? If it went straight bearing to nut that’d get me more treads but probably not the best for the life of the bearing.

Those are all really tight tolerances, well done with that. I’d ride it around for a bit to see what happens. Honestly, I think you’re good to go as long as the axle is getting into the nylon.

just a quick question, those motors are super tight, are the mounts custom?
  And if so can you counter sink the motor into the mount similar to the evolve mounts to give you a bit more room. unless you are supper tight all way around and have 0 flex on your mounts they are bound to hit.....
excellent build I really like the deck

They aren’t custom just some eBay specials, they’re pretty thick so I’m gunna try and run emm as is and hopefully there’s no flex. If it becomes an issue though I’ll probably just try and have them milled down, or just buy wider trucks lol

Thanks for the compliment to man, should be a beast compared to my boosted dual+ w/97mm’s

Guys, 

Is this single xt90 to dual xt60 a bad idea? I’d wrap in electrical tape. This is my first solder job so I want any feedback anyone would have.

This will be connecting my focboxs to my 12s4p batter and the BMS is a 60A/150A if that helps asses. ![image|375x500](upload://kaGTbvHjxXWLgerqjS31PxwLIUg.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://69bO0oDcfGi6bYphUT5sIC1IWKi.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://nlBJtrv04PZ3KFVTH72FpxPT3oi.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://rdI93t5nbeDBN0wkWei3HqlOa9t.jpeg)

It was 12 or 10 some online eskate stores will have the sizes posted. I went to miners, it's rigid as he'll though wish it had some flex

So I tried hooking everything up with that connector for shits and gigs and I think it’s def not working. As soon as I turn it on with everything hooked up everything comes on for a second and then the battery shuts off. I think it might be the BMS’s safety switch or something to turn the thing off if it has a janky connection or something. 

Do you think using the connector is the issue? It broke on one side but the other side that was still connected stayed on. But then when I turned it back off and on again that side that was still connected wouldn’t stay on again.

Could be that parallel connector you made. I know @scepterr used to make them, XT90 to dual XT60

Ya get a good connector or practise a bunch, I only say this because it's easy to destroy parts 😐

I'm gunna see if I can get some wire today and go from there. 

I know people have used this connector type without wire, now that I've rewatched some of the videos outlining how to do it, it appears I need to rotate the connectors so all the "humps" are facing out for more of a contact patch between the connectors, without doing this I'll have filled the "cups" with a bunch of solder but have not have ensured good connection between the gold pieces.

ok so I fried two focbox's but I've got two more and have done more research (likely not enough) on getting a dual motor board set up correctly in BLDC. However, I have a problem I've started out by hooking up one focbox but when I flick the battery on it'll power on but then blink red for error and my comp won't detect the focbox even though it stays on (blue light). Also while powering down the battery the red light will flash again. 

Any thoughts? or places to start looking? My connector reads a constant amount of volts coming through so I don't think its the battery to focbox's splitter. Not using the splitter above either.

@brently  I just bought the same board.  It's not here yet.  What do you think of the concave?  Lots of mixed opinions.  Super comfortable, totally uncomfortable, etc.

I’d know more about how comfortable it was if I could get it running....

But from the bit I’ve been on it I like the concave, feels comfy to me

Is anybody in the NYC Jersey City/Hoboken area able to help my troubleshoot a little? I'm currently at a loss and can't get my focbox to turn on without an error.

Scott should probably see this. Sounds like he’s set on set up regardless.

Fun times! 

Gunna finish setting it up to send power to both motors over the weekend. Then fine tuning the rest of the summer. 

Open to hearing recos on tuning? 12s4p, 170kv, 60/150A BMS, focboxs. Still pretty new to the BDLC tool.
