I decided i want to build an electric board. I have been looking at many different set ups. Looking to build my own battery thinking inboard L-ion without BMS, instead use a cell balancing charger. Below board Vescs, cell loggers, power switch, wiring..etc. I'm thinking if I can get my hands on a carbon GT deck I'd like to have the cell loggers pointing up through the top of the deck cover plate. Undecided of whether i will use a single motor or dual. 

Anybody know how many 18650 L-ions fit inside GT deck, or have measurements of battery/components compartment?

Anyone know where i can get some motors that will hold up to speeds in excess of (35-40mph+)?

Is their any motors holding up to 14S?

I don't think the vesc can handle more than 12s. For your speed requirements though I did a quick calc on the esk8 calc using a 170kv motor on 12s. This is using psychotillers 6" pneumatics and his 42t wheel pulley. It's crazy!!

Here is the same motor with 97mm wheels and 16/36 gearing

Do you have all the other parts you need? Might as well make this your build thread too :sunglasses:

Sorry I didn't really answer the question. You can buy quality motors from any of these people. The 14s thing isn't really going to work as far as I know unless you want to exceed motor and vesc limits and make magic smoke.

I'm not that familiar with anyone else in the EU

How does a buyer know how many pole pairs are in any particular motor without opening it? Excess rpm and erpm will have a negative impact on the motors none the less cook some components.

first step:
I guess I will now wait to see if i can get my hands on a CGT deck.

Leave a link to your motor, it should say it in the product description

I'll update this when I locate a deck and start building the battery. If anyone has any way to locate this particular deck any information would be appreciated.

If you are looking for mental fast [a pair of these](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/helicopter/motors_4/hk-45_1/hk-4540_400_8/) would be stupid :punch: :smiling_imp:

**12s-18s 10,000w/150amps cont.**

will need a _RC_ esc for 14s
work out the gearing/roll out...
but that said Jenso is getting almost 14s watt/amp numbers out of VESC6 and Leopard 80mm motors...
could be worth a look?

I'm drawing up a custom deck at the moment that will house a 12S12P L-ion battery. going to keep the range around 180-210kv.

with the battery I'm building 12P@81.6Ah=6800mAh/18650. is  81.6A in parallel to two motors 40.8A each too much?

will the vescs and motors hold up to that much current? seems like a lot for such small equipment.
