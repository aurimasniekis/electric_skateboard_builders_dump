Hey there!

I'm looking to sell my car and switch to public transport and an electric longboard in the summer. 
I already have an earthwing supermodel 3D which I want to use as the base of this build. It has paris v2 180mm Trucks and Cult classics 80a. I also have some abec 11 flywheels hich I could switch to. I am 1,80m tall and weigh 75 kg.

I would like a dual motor build because I live in Switzerland and we have a good amount of hills. 
I'm thinking of using 2 x 63mm Motors because of power.
First question would probably be if they would both fit on the 180mm paris?
If yes, which motors would be a good fit?

I've been thinking about 6s batterys - 2x ZIPPY Flightmax 8000mAh 3S1P 30C to get 6s.
Would they be powerfull enough for 2 Motors? 

I also need an esc. Because budget isn't the main factor and I want something good quality it is allowed to cost a bit more. Can you recommend a good one?

Sorry for asking so many questions - I'm a first time builder and have spent quite some time with reading but havn't quite understood everything yet... Thanks a lot for your help!

6s for dual is not enough i think, you should go at least 10s. and use a vesc!

You would want a VESC if you want the best quality ESC for esk8s

10S for your build

Get 2 x 6354/6355

Or diagonal drive 2 x 6374

Do I really need a dual 63mm motor setup?

Hello @capfirepants,  first of all: welcome to the forum.  There is a small number  of riders here from around Zurich.  Where are you based? 

If you have to climb longer hills you have to go dual.  A single motor might be strong enough ,  but you will overheat it or the esc going up long hills. 
There is a big debate wethter 63mm or  smaller motors are more efficient.  I think both work if you're running the proper gearing.  

As for VESCs,  I got mine from esk8.de and I am super happy!

Hey @PB1
Thanks for the warm welcome ;) 
Im based in Solothurn. Its nice to know Switzerland has a, albeit small, community. 

Yes, as I live in a village about 120 meters higher than the city I probably need 2 motors... 

Can you reccomend any Motors you would perhaps use for my build? There is so much gear out there... 
Which VESCs do you use? Would you reccomend them for my setup? 

Also I saw a video today of a guy running a dual motor setup with 6s... Is that logical? 

Sorry for all the questions. Im looking to learn a lot but its not the most simple topic to get into for me.

Using two motors (generaly) means you also use two ESC's, this means the load is better distributed so your motors and escs are both less prone to overheating. You will also have redundancy in case of snapping a belt, and increased grip for braking downhill. So I do advice a dual drive in your case.

If you are going for a VESC (in this case dual VESC) it is better to go 10S instead of 6S as this will also decrease the load going uphill (with more volts, you will generate the same amount of watts with fewer amps ). At 6S a single VESC can only provide about 1330 watts to the motor, and thats really pushing it already. The 63xx motors most of us use on this forum can generate  2500+ watts each, so if you use 6S on a VESC you will never get the full performance out of your motor. In a dual drive setup with dual VESC at 6S you will be able to generate 2660 watts which is a LOT for flat ground and may also be enough for hills, but then you are pushing the VESCs to the limit so its probably more reliable to just go 10S. 

Note that if you go for a different ESC, that will handle more current, then you will have less reason to go beyond 6S. In fact, many of the affordable RC ESC's are limited to 6S. Charging solutions are also cheaper at 6S.

Since you will use 180mm paris trucks, if you want both motors on the same truck and on the same side then you will need short motors, look up some dual drive builds with paris trucks and see what they used. You can always go dual diagonal or dual rear with the motors on opposite sides of the trucks. 

What range do you need? With 2x 3S 8000mah zippy you will normally get 18km's of range, probably much less in switzerland due to the hills. 

Choose your ESC first, then the other choices get much easier!

Hi @Stef
Thanks for your reply. I'm going to get 2x VESCs from esk8.de

 Im now looking at motors. 
Should I rather go for the [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-245kv](https://www.hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html), [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192kv](https://www.hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) or[ Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-149kv](https://www.hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-149kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)?

So I also need batterys - 10s or rather even 12s? I would like a range of about 15kms, more would be even better. 
Would 2 of these in series work as 1 10s? https://www.hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-5s1p-30c.html
or 3/4 of these: https://www.hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-30c.html ?

How will I be able to control both motors with 1 remote? Do I send 2 recievers?

Thanks for taking a look!

If you want to go dual, i would go with 2x190kv 6355, 10s battery.
If single go with the 6374 190kv

Esk8.de makes high quality vescs! 

You mentioned that you want to sell your car and use the Esk8,  so your board needs to be very reliable.  

As another thought : why not start with an inexpensive quick build, single drive.  10s is always good because there are chargers available,  balance and brick.  Maybe lipos 2x5s in a Tupperware box.  
Build,  ride and learn.  

Then after you know exactly what you are looking for build a second board and keep the first one for guests,  gf,  wife,  kids, ...  Or as a spare.  

Regarding your current board,  note that motor mount choice for Paris trucks is limited.

Then one word of caution,  this hobby is highly addictive...

I agree with that aswell. I think that might be the better way to start, as otherwise I will be spending a lot of money on a build and hobby that I may or may not like. I can always go bigger. 

So back to  the drawing board. Which of the batterys and motor should I get?

The SK3 motors that you linked are well suited ... if they are available :-) . 
Note of caution: the SK3s don't have a keyway, so in order to get a strong bond with the motor pulley you have to do some filing / dremeling. Maybe 1 hour work. 
Here my SK3 6364 213kv (I would not go with the 245kv). I went with 12s because I had the LiPos lying around, but the board is too fast ... 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/tf4m-fibretech-allround-fats-970-sk3-6364-213kv-12s-lipo/3308


So choose the motor that you like and is available. If the SK3s are not available and you don't want to wait pick an alternative. esk8.de, enertion, alien, ... 


Batteries. Personally I like the 10s and the 2x 5s setup. You can use a big 10S balance charger or you can charge the packs individually using a cheaper charger that goes up to 6s like the iMax B6. 

Once you have decided on the motor and the battery choose your gearing. There are a number of speed calculator around. 

Regarding your question above. You only need one transmitter / receiver for a dual setup. You can either split the servo wire (DIY by soldering or you buy an Y-Wire from hobby king) or you can connect two VESCs via Canbus in master / slave mode. Splitting the  servo wire is normally easier and is what I have done on two builds.

Alright, slowly getting there. I think I should be ready to order soon.

I will be buying:

1x Motor mount kit: http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/alien-drive-complete-kits/alien-drive-systems-electric-longboard-diy-kit-63mm-motor/

Still need a recommendation for a Remote. I saw the bad wolf casemod online but do not have access to a 3d Printer. Is there a way to buy one of these? Or do you have any other recommendations? Id like something that fits in my pocket.

why not, like i said the 6374 190kv - it will fit a 10s single drive much better!

if you want a gt2b remote and mod, order it online. The files you need are free available and even some guys here on the forum will print one for you.

Otherwise if you want something easy, take a look at the EU Market: https://eu.electric-skateboard.market/product/2-4ghz-mini-remote-receiver/
or talk directly to @ajaynagra
3. Option is hellray.de, because you already order a vesc from them. They will provide you with remotes too

the 190kv because of more torque?

Ok, I'll check for someone to print the remote for me or I might get another one. Is the something small and reliable that fits into a pocket? I've read about the winner remote that people seem to have more problems than remotes working well...

Ah, do I need spark protection for my e-board build?
Also which charger would be the best? It would be nice to be able to keep the batteries "in" the board and charge them from there, is that possible?

hey,

where are you in switzerland? i'm a basel-area based e-boarder and since 2016 we launched some custom made boards. i think we can find a good solution for your project. feel free to contact me - you can do a test ride with one of our boards if you like. 

i got few settings here.. for single-drive a 6374 with different kv from 130-190, for dual some 6354 with 170-200kv. usually batterys - or power-pack we use 10s4p, wich give enough power and very good range to. 

the "top-ride board" can claim massive hills, very fast like 40-50km/h and 30-40km range on single..  let's go try and find out what you like. cheers

Was going to mention that,  you also need wires  (10 or 12awg for batteries)  and connectors for the batteries and vesc and vesc and motors.  Preferably those connectors match :grinning:.  Out of the box they normally don't.  If you run 2*5s batteries you need a series harness, again with matching connectors.  
And some shrink wrap...  

Might as well make a little plan and order the stuff early (e. G. from hobby King  or hebushop.ch) 

 I use xt90s as anti spark. 

If you want to charge without removing your battery you need a 10s capable charger and/or clever wiring.  Or use the inexpensive one I mentioned and re-plug for charging.  
Maybe keep it simple at the beginning?

Yes, probably better to keep it simple... Im just so pumped and looking forward to my first board and want to make the build as cool as possible. 

Aren't XT90s just connector type? How do I wire them as an antispark connector? 
Where do I get the series harness from?

10 or 12 awg wire I should get from hobbykong as well? Or can I take it from for example some old ac cable?

Don't ... make it too cool ... remember, you want to be up and running before the first snow falls and you want to improve. 

XT90 are just connectors. XT90**S** are anti-spark connectors. They have a built in resistor when plugged-in half way. Think you can get them from hobby king or ebay. Order a handfull. 
You can use them as connectors or as loop them in somewhere. They should be plugged in last in order to work. 
Can you old ac cable handle up to 80 amps dc current? If yes, fine. 
If no, order some quality silicon wire. Hobby King, hebushop.ch (http://www.hebu-shop.ch/index.php?cat=c14964_Silikonkabel-AWG.html) or even Galaxus. 

Series harness? I soldered them myself. Think hobby king has them. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-battery-harness-10awg-for-2-packs-in-series.html

That looks good, nice and simple! Probably want some red wire as well ... 

On top you need:
- a transmitter / receiver (GT2B with mod or another)
- motor pulley, 8mm
- drive wheel pulley that fits your wheel (or new wheels)
- belt in the right length
- keyway for the motor pulley

Probably best buying the whole drivetrain from alien. 

- charger capable of charging 10s or 5s
- depending on the charger you need a powerful power supply and for convenience a parallel harness 

Sorry, nobody said it would be cheap ...

That's what I meant earlier, pick a motor that you like and that is available. The SK3s are known to be in high demand unfortunately ... 

I have no personal experience with the motors that you mentioned, but they do look good and I'm sure they are a good alternative. 
Pick the motor and then adjust your gearing. 

How to avoid import duty? It doesn't matter where your goods are coming from, you have to pay VAT plus sometimes import duty. Except the value is small and the goods are marked as present / gift. 
So the only difference should be the actual shipping (plus you pay tax for the shipping)
