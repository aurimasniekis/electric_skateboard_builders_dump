No, high demand lead to this. They just can't produce these enough.

Its the actual opposite. I had a chat with the owner of a big longboard shop here in Vancouver and he told me that they maybe sell 1 set of 107s a year, because the only market is esk8 or some very random people, since it doesn't really make a difference for regular longboarding.

I've asked a few people in China to do just that but I haven't seen any yet.  Considering real ones are nigh impossible to get, I want to see a boatload of clones show up.  Normally I'd never say that, but when a company consistently fails to deliver product FOR YEARS ON END, that's how I feel.  They don't deserve to still be in business

I've never heard of Electric Superflys.

Electric Flywheel - 107mm centerset core either 58mm or 62mm contact patch with inner bevel for railroad tracks etc

SuperFly wheel - 107mm offset core 55mm contact patch with no bevel

Most pulleys don't fit Electric Flywheels but some do.  The core is deep inside the wheel

Yep, got confused there, you are right haha

Well since Superfly's are more compatible with esk8's [here is a link](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/wheels/72661/107mm-abec-11-super-fly-longboard-skateboard-wheels) to Muir, they seem to have 14 in stock.

I think a lot of people get confused be cause of the word "electric" in the name of the wheel.

Use the word "better" very carefully.  SuperFly are "better" at being compatible with existing pulley systems.  Full stop.

I have both...  and the Electric Flywheels are better

I can get a few sets for you guys. Price is $135 for a set of four. Let me know if your interested, you would have to prepay and I can ship in two weeks. (Need to do this ASAP because stock is low).

I am talking about the 107mm 74a Reflex Super Fly with offset core.

Si, son diferentes. Starting with the inside, on the new F1 Superfly they shaved off about 10 mm of urethane to accommodate the wheel pulley and work in line with the motor pulley (belt alignment), otherwise if they used the older fattier Electric Flywheel it can not work due to the alignment issue. Will be offset

Had, itâ€™s confusing. There are no electric superfly wheels. Only electric (old centerset) and super (new offset).  Both good for different things, but superfly easier for working with traditional ABEC wheel pulleys for eSk8.  I have both versions working on eSk8, so not impossible if you like the larger contact patch (and corresponding weight) of the old electric flywheel.

Those aren't superflys.  The hubs are black and the graphics say flywheel.  Still great wheels but you'd need to lathe the inside off to fit pulleys.  Assuming it's not a scam

Yeah, I went to Boarder Labs in Vancouver and they had 3 or 4 sets of abec 107mm and only 1 set of the 97mm. He says the 107mm is so expensive that people rarely buy it versus the popular 97mm

I know. There were some peeps on the forum looking for Electric Flywheels specifically. They are extremely rare these days since they arent manufactured anymore.

The threads name is actually not about superfly.

I"m confused, because this listing says they are "Electric Superfly" 107's:
https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/abec-11-superfly-electric-flywheels-black-longboard-skateboard-wheels-107mm-74a-set-of-4
Do you think these would have an offset core making it easier for me to find a pulley that would fit?

That's the place I ordered "Electric Flywheels" from and had to return them because they shipped me SuperFly wheels instead.  I don't think they have any idea what's going on.  They apparently still don't know after having to process a return because of that.  I would avoid buying from Warehouse Skateboards.

But if I truly wanted 107 Superfly's (which I do) wouldn't $114 shipped be a good price? I think the others I've found have all been around $140 lately. But I keep getting confused w/ all the different labels on 107's (re, super, evolve, green, black, electric, etc) so maybe I just need to keep studying :slight_smile:

I just ordered some from warehouse skateboards. 

I know the thread is about electric flywheels, but I personally just want some superflys. I'll pass up on the electric flywheels potentially not fitting my pulleys (even though I could just 3d print some adapters probably...)    That 74a reflex thane, 107mm sounds like a great upgrade from my 81a 90mm flywheels.
