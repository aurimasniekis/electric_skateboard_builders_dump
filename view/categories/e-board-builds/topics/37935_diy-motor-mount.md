I am going to make my own motor mount. Is there anywhere I can get a template or outline for what the motor mount looks like?

That's useless they don't have anything that I can print out. I think @lox897 just posted a image of a enertion board mount. Also I don't have anything that can open .rar files. why can't people just use pdf of something more mainstream.

Randles are my trucks, but that doesn't really matter that much because I have the tools to MODIFY IT.

Enertion is not helpful. I have used the search however there isn't a template that I can print out and use.
