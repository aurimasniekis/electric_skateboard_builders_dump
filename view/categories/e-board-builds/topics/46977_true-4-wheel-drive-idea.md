Looking at my axles, I had the idea to make a live axle, pin both wheels to the axle. Pull with both wheels at once. 
Will tear it down and get more pictures, so I can get ideas from you guys.
If I pull the axle, machine for bearings on each end, as I said pin axles, let the whole thing run together.![20180218_223447|690x388](upload://vDYutotCvgOL5wuvlsvUqDPZB4J.jpg)

will likely introduce more under-steer on a sealed surfaces than loose...

i.e. might feel a bit funny on the road, especially at speed, off road or on grass less so...

I use it off road, grass, dirt, gravel, campground.
Very little pavement riding, it only goes 12 mph topped out, LOL
But very torquey, if it gets traction can climb huge hills.
