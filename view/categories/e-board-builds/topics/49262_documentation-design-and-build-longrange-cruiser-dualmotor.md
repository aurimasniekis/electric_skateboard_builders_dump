hey guys,

in this thread i like to share the complete build of my project.

I start with the things i considered first and i will finish if the board dont need further improvements (if this ever happens :P)


**Q**: Why are you doing this ?
**A**: I like to share my experience with other people  who are interested in thooth builds
   and maybe i aswell as you can learn from it.

**Q**: What parts do you use ?
**A**: **All parts will be named** in the certain updates, if they are important (i dont list every screw)
   (but feel free to ask if u think i have missed anything)

**Q**: Will there be any photos or videos ?
**A**: yes, i will try to **document every medium or big change** is the project

**Q**: But what the hell are you trying to build?
**A**: The plan is **based on an 104cm (40,9inch) Longboard** and will be a **dualmotor longrange-cruiser**.
   At least this is the plan :)





so, there is the base board:![_SL1001_|500x500](upload://chWqsA2yxyN9SBVebYUNAQMkMe2.jpg)

this is a **9 layers of maple wood** design with **70mm 80A wheels**and mach1 bearing (**ABEC-11** High Speed)
it has alu trucks with about **35Â° - 40Â°**

Those motors are probably to high of Kv.

Have you checked out the beginners guide or section to see a list of commonly used parts and how to?

i have also a funtomia. i would recommend you to drive the rolls well, because at the start they are slow. But after a while they a good. I like the deck, it has some flex, but its not too flexy. And if you like the print, seal it additional again, because it is sadly not a really water resistant coating. For the top remove the griptape and put a better coating on top, because my spacestripe are looking very messy, and i think only with sandpaper i get the a little bit cleaner.

I know theese are quite fast. 
But I have chosen them because their depth and because I'm able to create my own, customized pully system and gear ratio.

I hope this is going well, but only time can tell :slight_smile:

What voltage battery will you use? I personally wouldnâ€™t go higher than 8s or else you might lift off the ground

i like to use **10S8P**

i think this depends on a mix of weight, settings, and gear
weight will be like **12kg for the board and 80kg for me** .. 
**if i travel with backpack there will be more than 100 kg**

so if i calc the settings right this wouldnt be an issue ....
and 10S perfectly fit unter the board

**What do u guys think??**

Add a backspoiler ðŸ˜‚

Let me give you an advice: buy a focbox, escape or bbox instead! much better and maybe even cheaper

but i think this will work just fine, its designed for EV ... 
and if it doesnt .... i find a way so it does xD

Now finally the Li-Ion cells arrived ... (_picture on top_)
there is just one question ..
**8S10P** or **10S8P** for **260KV** at **1:4** gear ...

what are your thoughts ?

What size wheels do you plan on using? The 70mm wheels are too small for esk8, especially with that gearing.

Hi,
I am planning on using 90mm wheels :

What is your top speed goal? Even at a 90mm wheel, a 10s setup will only get you roughly 20mph with that gearing setup.

maybe it could be possible that this is actually  1:3,5  gear ratio ...
this is my first build so maybe its ok if it goes just 40km/h more or less?
could change gear-ratio maybe .. hmm

True but his motors are 260kv. Can potentially go very very fast.

Not with a 1:4 gearing setup. Take a look at an esk8 calculator, it will show you. Although it depends on your definition of fast

```
You could probably hit 40km/h going downhill or with a tailwind. I would go with 10s8p. I would argue anything above 3-5p is overkill for combating voltage sag, and either configuration should give you about 80km (which is insane by the way!). I would say go for speed with 10s8p.

I would suggest changing the great ratio, if it's your first board I would say dual 63mm motor is already a bit scary in terms of torque. Multiplying that torque by 4 is just terrifying in my opinion. I would say 2.5-3.5 is good, and will give you a great top speed for when you are more advanced.

@TheFluffiest @dg798 
so i finally figured out, that i have the possibility to build the setup also with a **1:3** gear ratio that i have sitting around



i am trying to build this setup by the motto "go big or go home" ..
so i will limit speed and adjust throttle curve for the fist rides until i get comfortable enough with the board
also i will be able to reduce the limits via app and maybe make different profiles for the focboxes for different scenarios.
```

## \#24 Posted by: TheFluffiest Posted at: 2018-05-08T15:31:43.477Z Reads: 61

```
Definitely use the 1:3.  That will get you a top speed of roughly 50km/h with 10s8p. If you want even faster, you can get 97mm wheels instead but it's not necessary at all. 

You are definitely meeting that motto :joy: 

I personally would go 10s8p. Once you are more experienced, finding a flat, strait road will be really fun! Make sure you have a good bushing setup for yourself, and have all your safety gear too.

You can double stack the batteries, it will take half the space on the board! Just a little less clearance on bottom.
