The reason for the name and what got me into e-sk8 is a funny story. I had a regular trick skateboard with big wheels and risers that I used to commute on so I didn't have to walk between public transport. At the end of a work party that was on a boat we where walking back down the pier and one of my co workers wanted to try my skateboard. I said sure, just don't launch it of the side of the pier. 5 seconds after I gave him the board it shot of the side and KA-PLONK. Hence the name Under The Sea. He was kind enough to offer to replace it, he gave me $200 which I used towards building an e-sk8. I don't think I would have got into it at the time as I didn't have the budget for one, but I had been thinking about building one for a while. 

I have been riding it now for about 6 months and now it's time for some upgrades, hence the V2 build log. I have been ridding this around 15km 2-3 days a week as part of my commute. It replaces my need for bus or taxi's. 

It was a tight budget build with total spend around $700 usd. Mostly chinese parts, one to keep a low budget and secondly being in Hong Kong shipping is much faster than from the US or Europe. I got the trucks, motors, mounts, belts, pulley, wheels and bearings as a kit of ebay $220. Questionable quality but all that stuff is still working. I have replaced the belts pulleys and bearings though. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now to the upgrades. I want better reliability as I was constantly shredding belts and wearing out motor pulleys. Running 12s with 270kv motors meant I had to use 4:1 (12-48) gear ratio that led to many downsides. The 12 tooth motor pulleys wear out really fast, once worn they slip under heavy breaking and shred belts. The 48 tooth wheel pulley is pretty close to ground so gets some rock damage over time. Luckily I designed and printed the wheel pulley myself so its an easy item for me to maintain. Also the power delivery was brutal and was difficult to tune out with the vesc settings. I eventually changed to 15-48 gearing and the 15 tooth pulleys are much more reliable and the smaller ratio has really smoothed out the power delivery. 

So I wanted to change the motors to a lower KV so that I could have a better drive ratio. Which would lead to better reliability. I found these [5065 140kv](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Arrival-Racerstar-5065-BR5065-140KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-With-Gear-For-RC-Motorcycle-Multicopter/32775150885.html) motors that would allow me to run a 2:1 (20-40) ratio. After receiving them I was bummed out to realize they where 70mm long and didnt fit my trucks. I needed longer trucks but didnt find any until torque boards made the [extra wide caliber II style trucks](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-218mm-trucks/). Which are on the way and should have on hand in a week or so. 

I will be making the motor mounts once they arrive, I will also be upgrading my battery mount design and esc lunchbox so its more water proof. Pics below of the current build state.

Yes, they have been perfectly reliable. I have not tried FOC though, they advised not to. Kept my battery wires as short as possible and being 12s the amp draw is lower so they don't get hot. I wish they had a bootloader though.

I think you can load a bootloadet on to those if you please, you just need to buy the cable and follow the guide here on the forum.

She's not pretty but she's fast, 43kph which is too fast for a skateboard and always scaring me. I hope to clean it up a bit as I upgrade. Notice how the battery is taped on but the tape is bolted down, I think that's funny. There is Velcro too under the aluminum plate. The tape wears out though and I have to re-strap it every week or two so this is one part I want to fix.

**Update:** Working on my motor mount design. I want to start cutting metal but I don't know the exact profile of the clamp area on the torque 218 trucks. I think I gotta wait till I have them in hand.

Theoretically there is 7mm between the motors. Dual 70mm long motors and 15mm belts.

Did you count in screws which u use to clamp motor plate to mounting piece? Or do you sunk them so it doesn't matter. 

Edit. Seems like those screw fit "inside of pulley"

There is space provided the heads are not too large. I may have to grind down some of the end of the hanger though.

Updates: I water proofed the battery, sunk it down into the deck and got rid of the tape hold down straps. Replaced the lunch box for a smaller one that I hoped would be water tight. De-cased the GT2B receiver as space was limited. 

Two batteries become one. They are double taped together in the middle, then glass fiber tape, then hot glue around the ends, then one layer of shrink wrap, some more hot glue, another layer of shrink wrap and some more hot glue. Finally some shaping with hot air gun on the ends and some more glass fiber tape. No water be getting inside.

Next step is to route out a hole so the battery can sit lower, the goal being so I can go over speed bumps without scraping.

I **do not** recommend using a dremill for this. This sucked, it took for ever and if you push too hard the router bit vibrated from flexing. At the end my dremill died, I think the brushes are toast.

The battery was used as a mold so it fits supper snugly. Like a tight tight glove.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/5/f59639d77b79bb395e9c567c762a2d798db27937.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Some double side tape and its pretty much stuck in there. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/0/c00b51adc8dd83ea2822a9b5ebd13e215f3a7df8.jpg" width="666" height="500">

But we need a bash plate and clamp for extra security.

Putting the two vesc's receiver and battery meter in this small lunchbox was much more challenging than I was expecting. I have the vesc's set at angle so that its easy to get to the USB plug for quick tuning changes. I had to decase the receiver and my first setup didn't work properly as it would cut out going up hills at full throttle. At first I thought it might be my BLDC settings but after I thought about it I came to the conclusion that the receiver was too close to the motor wires. In fact one of the PPM wires wrapped over a motor wire. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/0/a03b3bf8c31d6a61b8f83c31e130cbf05688053e.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/c/fcaeaf4803a9696bcf6ab40a66e90c64bb8412bd.jpg" width="666" height="500">

So I moved the receiver and its PPM wires away from the motor wires. Also I covered it in hot glue then glass tape then aluminum tape to hopefully block some RF noise and make it water proof. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/2/c2f94c3b57e7e20662cff982dfaae916baade47d.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/b/7bb2795513c6886bbc65ca5e112da207bde51d15.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/2/629eeaff8be2d0ac2c3517d1eb8f084163ff1eb8.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I need it to be 100% water proof as during the summer its wet season here and I have to commute in this. 

[https://youtu.be/Gi0xRELvFhE](https://youtu.be/Gi0xRELvFhE)

But the lunch box leaks a little bit still so I put in a decacent pack and add some extra tape. Keeps out 99% of the water. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/4/74f01701035b35979b78ceea87885b4a821d7664.jpg" width="666" height="500">

**Some updates:** The bolt holes one the deck where starting to crack apart due to the all the rain ridding and being a drop through. So I decided to fill the hole with a 3D printed part and some fiberglass and a little carbon toe I had on hand from building model planes. I think its about time I buy a new deck but I hope this can last a few more months. New grip tape is on the way and I might paint it black to hide the sins.

I tried to improve the water proofing with a RTV gasket. Which didn't really perform better than the old gasket. I think ridding through puddles at high speed is not that easy to seal against so Im looking into better sealing enclosures. The water killed one of my vesc's :tired_face: :sob: so now I'm ridding a single motor for a week or so. Its slooow. :sleeping:

The torque 218s arrived. The long axels mean you can run wider than 218mm, there is enough length for two spacers! I got it mocked up with 3D printed clamp and motor mounts.

Is it possible that the longer truck can fit two big 6374? Looks so attractive to me for a big power setup...

Yeah it will fit with 97mm wheels and 15mm belts. But not sure about other wheels. There is a thread here with some testing of setups. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-extended-diyes-218mm-caliber-ii-clones-what-will-fit-6374-dual-and-97mm-wheels/25099

Definitely fits dual 6374, 15mm, and 97s with ease,  as long as you space out the wheel properly. 

You can stack 13-15 speedrings or cut a spacer to that length.  I used some extra 8mm ID CF tube I had left over. 

I was able to fit dual 6374 w/ 107mm electric flywheels, with 12mm belts,  if you want to go monster wheels without pneumatics.

If you want waterproof electronics, get some CorrosionX and dip it in that, I can vouch for it.
Got caught in a downpour during a ride which filled my enclosure with water, nothing happened to the electronics, still alive and kicking a year later.

I would if it was available here. 

I was thinking of maybe using this silicone spray [conformal coating](http://hken.rs-online.com/web/p/conformal-coatings/0831141/)  But I wouldn't be able to coat the connectors and usb? It might be really hard to remove for repairs too but Im ok with that if it means I dont need to do repairs in the first place.

It's a conformal coating from RS Components. Silicon based in a spray can. The link is two posts up. Im trying for 100% water proof as it rains a lot here. I removed the connectors as I didn't want water to be able to get under them. 

Some tips if anyone gets this one, the nozzle blocks like instantly i had to drill it out to get it to work, also wear gloves as it's really hard to remove from finger nails. It's resistant to most solvents :worried:

Yeah I put blue tack inside the bullets and usb. I kinda wish I could get rid of the USB port because its the only element I can't 100% water proof.

Update, paint is done. I would have never gone with this color but it kinda matched the wheels. Now just need to re-wire all the electronics and install in the new lunch box. I got a larger one as the small one was a pain in the ar**s and this one is higher quality so I hope its water tightness is better. 

The vesc's now have two coats of conformal coating.

**Update on water proofing; had a week of heavy rain to test it.** :cloud_rain::cloud_lightning:It has been working good, the lunch box keeps out all water with light rain and wet roads but if there are  puddles everywhere then a small amount of water makes it past the seal. :sweat_drops: Hitting puddles at high speed does not help, but its so fun. :stuck_out_tongue: To prevent the small amount of water getting on the vesc's I put in some paper towel on heavy flow days :flushed: which absorbs it. 

While the conformal coating should give me good water proofing I decided to go an extra step and cover the vescs in a thick shrink wrap and hot glue the ends so they are totally sealed. Its very much **over kill** and I think I should be able to  run them under water with this setup. :ocean: It also protects them physically and makes them easier to mount. I can stick 3M velcro to them. 

One note that my wheel bearings started to be a bit noisier than normal so I took them out an repacked with grease. The motors are still smooth though so that's good.

The build is pretty much complete now I just need to make one more post with before and after pictures, I didn't take any photos of the under side yet. After that I will start a new thread as I have started to order more parts for a new build. I had to get a new deck as this drop through one has not taken the abuse well. Getting something higher quality, US made top mount down hill style deck. Should be way more durable. This seller has $20 international shipping which is awesome. *Edit; the shipping was better than expected, the last leg was shipped with fedex and it came in 10 days. Normally companies ship USPS International and it takes minimum 3 weeks and there is no tracking after it leaves the US, highly recommend this seller.

This rebuild all started because I wanted a more reasonable gear ratio , 4:1 with 270kv on 12s did work but the 12 tooth motor pulley would wear out super quickly, once worn it would strip belts. So I found some lower KV motors. Then discovered they didn't fit my truck, needed wider trucks. None where available until Torque boards released their 218's.  At this point I was like well I might as well put a bit more effort in and lower the battery and paint it so it looks decent.  The look is much improved but the drop through area started to crack from all the abuse and water running. So its reinforced with an aluminum plate so I can get a month or so more use out of it while I get a new deck. 

As for how it handles and performance. The wider trucks are more stable in tight turns :heart_eyes: but are more zig zaggy on uneven ground due to being more effected by bumps. If you have a ridden evolve its like that but much less obvious. The new motors are quieter and make a really nice sound I use BLDC. Being sensored they have smoother take off, much smoother braking to stand still. Maybe its the Kv but the breaks are also stronger even with 50% reduction in gear ratio. These motors also have much less drag.

So I went from 4:1 - 270kv to 2:1 140kv, motors being same size but different brands. Overall performance is very similar besides the above mentioned characteristics.

I actually don't ride that deck anymore due to the aggressive deep concave. It's definitely designed for aggressive riding and bends my toes up on my goofy ass clown feet. I'd honestly be willing to trade someone straight up for a different deck. It's a great deck with an enormous wheelbase/length ratio and mine only has holes drilled in it for a space cell 3 enclosure so if you have one it'll match right up. Any takers?
