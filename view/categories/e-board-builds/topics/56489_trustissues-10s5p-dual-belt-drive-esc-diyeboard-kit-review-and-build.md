I was afraid of I too! But I've had no problems actually! The motors are just as close to the ground as the enclosure

Hi, first of all nice video!

I just ordered the kit myself a few days ago and just want know what you think of it thus far?

I have heard that some people has had issues with the belts skipping, lipped bearings breaking etc and wonder if you have faced any of this or any other issues?

And by the way, when/if you need to create a belt-tensioner, it would be great to see the procedure on video, that would be super helpful for so many other diyeboard riders :slight_smile:

I went through the same process you did..I have my thread here..http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-kit-build-input/52623/11 I'm done with the build...it came out great..The only issue you didn't do i think is negotiate..you could of order the OT wheels and get the road for free..and just pay a little bit extra which it will be worth it..i'll post picture later..

Everything works good so far, when it comes to belt slipping I have some thoughts. First of all I'm a light guy, 70 kgs, this might make the load easier for the belts. Second I don't accelerate that hard, this prob. Also helps not getting belt slipping. I will make a vid if I need to make tensioners :)
