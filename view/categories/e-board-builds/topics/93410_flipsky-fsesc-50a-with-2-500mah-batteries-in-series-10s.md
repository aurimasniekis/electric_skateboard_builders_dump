Hello,

I am starting to put together my build finally. I have 2 x 5000 mAh Lipo's which I will be attaching in series. This will drive my Turnigy aerodrive 192 kv motor. **I am looking to see if the Flipsky FSESC 4.12 50A will be a good fit?**

I will be controlling the VESC through an Arduino and a homemade controller. So I would be connecting the receiver signal wire to my arduino output. Would I also need to attach the this receiver power to a 5v source and ground?

ANY tips or suggestions or warnings would be very helpful as this is my first build.

Thanks, it is greatly appreciated!

It will work fine. Use the search feature. Unless you have massive hills, 4.xx 50a hardware works
