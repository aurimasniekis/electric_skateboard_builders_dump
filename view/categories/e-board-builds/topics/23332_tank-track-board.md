Check out the render! 
Should be finished sometime next week.
Let us know what you think! 

Specs:
-6.3 Jigga Watts (kW)
-Tank-like Track
- Adjustable air suspension
- Oversized wheels / tires
- Custom composite Deck
- 30+ MPH... off-road

I was expecting a 4-track thing when I clicked on this but I now I'm just confused on how this will work.

In the render there is nothing outside of the tracks keeping up the board (as the track is one solid piece there can't be a supporting upright piece in the middle of the track) so how is the board pulled along?! Nice render though, amazing level of detail on the tracks and wheels!

yes there can - assume the belt (or whatever the name is) is a two part design with left and right halves split in the middle.

sure there is - there are even "grooves" that help guide the two halves around that obstacle
As you can see here these are not one solid piece

You may as well add a seat and handle bars and call it the trike tank.

EDIT: on second thought just handle bars since that deck is a tall enough to be a seat already :laughing:

What's the deal with the riding geometry? Looks like it cants downwards towards the wheels wondering if that is still WIP. 

Have you tried it with a massive riser on the front just to see how it would behave?

Ah right clearance for the rear track, maybe shorten the rear for that  and elongate the front...oops then balance is affected.

This is seriously cool with challenges

Sorry we haven't been up to date on this forum a lot of changes has been made on the board from out last post post in June. Including an entire redesign of the inner track chassis, new track pads, chromoly rib cages, optional handle bars etc.  Here are a some new photos of the new version!  Also we finally named this the Track1! We are pretty stoked to have been picked up by a bunch of websites like New Atlas, Yahoo Sports, Maxim, Digital Trends, Gear Junkie and a bunch of others.  This was the first forum we ever been on its time for more updates and content to come.
