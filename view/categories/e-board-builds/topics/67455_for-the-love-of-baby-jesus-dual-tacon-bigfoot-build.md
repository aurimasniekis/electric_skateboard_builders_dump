Initially I began this project wanting to build it completely from the bottom up, so I started by making a custom board - 
![image|375x500](upload://yzGHEGdzD2seKu0sbOj48FfLSYY.jpg)
![image|666x500](upload://aOUZqKo2bd0ifXUb6jQnnX1Ui1a.
Unfortunately the board split when I went off a curb lol 


Ill try to make this quick and to the point as this e-board has already consumed my consciousness for years now. I have tried to read every topic relating to my issues and still cant seem to get this thing right! So I thank anyone who may be able to shed some light!

Parts I've assembled thus far:

- (2) Tacon Bigfoot 245Kv motors
- (2) Motor mounts from DIY
- (2) 16T HTD5 Motor pulley from DIY
- (2) 36T KEGEL Drive Pulley Combo kit from DIY
- Orangatang Kegel wheels
- Caliber II Trucks

My friend gave me a new Yuneec ECU (ESC) from his E-Go board.. not sure if this is compatible but would amazing if I could utilize it.

Question 1 - WILL TWO TACON 63MM MOTORS EVEN FIT? If i have to I'm open to running them in a dual diagonal set-up.

![image|375x500](upload://fHncJK2Ll3iOkWRrlwxvkZ1mcEj.jpg)

Question 2 - IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO USE THE YUNEEC ECU (ESC)?  or am I better off just getting two new esc's. I anticipate problems connecting a diff remote control and compatibility with my tacon motors.

![image|375x500](upload://zYHY1aPdeD8EFvs6A4vEJhF3x1u.jpg)

Question 3 - I KNOW I KNOW THERE IS A MILLION TOPICS ON BATTERIES but what would be the best LIPO set-up for my build. I'm done dreaming about a 18650 custom pack, I just want to get this thing running.

Question 4 - HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE A KEYHOLE ON THESE MOTORS?

Hey man quite a bit to go through that.
Question 1.  Looks like you got the motors to fit although I'm not sure how. lol  Do they spin freely?  Usually you need 218s for 6374's
Question 2.  That yuneec esc is a factory programmed unit with its own built in receiver so you're better off with a pair of vescs that you can configure yourself.  With vesc you can use any remote receiver set up
Question 3. Use this tool to work out your best battery set http://calc.esk8.it/
and this build thread is from a lipo guru so once you have the size of the battery required you can adapt his techniques to assemble yours.  Bear in mind those tacon motors are a high kv so you would need to keep the voltage down to make sure you don't exceed the max erpm of the vescs but the esk8 calc tool will tell you the best config.
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014
Question 4. Hard lol.  your better off putting a flat area on the shaft.  If you do make sure you bag the motor up so no swarf gets in there of its goodbye motor.  Alternatively you could just use loctite.

Good luck and welcome to the money pit.

Hell they are!!

(the fact that you read 5335 on the can does not mean thats the class motor. In fact thats the stator dimension...that goes inside. These avocado devils are full fledge 6374 monsters! Thus their nick: Bigfoot) :sunglasses:

They're 63 diameter but not 74 in length apparently.
and judging by how much space you have between them on those 218s I fully agree.

Many motors are even the opposite, being 63mm x 82mm and that still fits the 6374 motor 
class

Exactly, many other brands do the same. They label the motors with the number of the stator dimension 5335, 5345, etc...but in reality they are 6374 class motors, either because both or at least one dimension fits the category.

You mean @WillieNelson ? Perhaps. I would like to see a closer look at his motors. But if the can says '160 Bigfoot', that means is the 6374 class of the Tacons

What is the “class”.  There’s so many sizes and that’s all I’ve heard them described by.  6374..I’m guessing it would have about a 5350 stator.  Longer than the Tacon.   Two of those is overkill to begin with in my mind anyway

@Hummie it has always been my understanding through rc that motors are measured by can size in the retail aspect.

Yes thats true. But in some cases companies like Tacon or T-Max like to label their motor with the stator size, although those motors are from a different (higher number) motor class. And I kinda understand why is that. Because in the case of the Tacon and the T-Max....they are originally build for the RC industry to move propelled driven RC aircraft. They (both motors) also come with these X mounts and a propeller shaft and nut to fit those aircraft.

I’ve never heard of any “class” and just motors described by size or supposed power output potential.  If it’s a certain size it’s lilely to put out close to the same power as others the same size.

Is us, Esk8ters who mess up with things, because we find these motors, created for a different market and a different porpuse, and adapt them for our Esk8 needs. In fact most Tacon motor line comes with these high kvs across the board. Only a few of their motors (which accidentally) come with less kvs, like the Bigfoot which is 245 Kv. still to high for most Esk8 applications, but we manage to go around this issue by increasing wheel pulley sizes to handle the high Kvs.
```

Imo motors should be measured on stator size tbh.  Then at least you'd be getting the actual size not the cover and if thats how tacon do it then good on them.  Do they do a 200kv?
```

If you go see their product line (Tacon) you'll see that almost all their motor come with super high Kvs. Thats because they are all made with the RC propeller driven aircraft in mind. Not for Esk8 application. The 160 Bigfoot is just about the only motor from their lineup that almost fit the bill for Esk8 application. The rest are all too high for us.

But the differences are minimal.  Wind some more wire wraps around it to make it a lower kv and done.  N get some better motor leads that won’t short or break n even better.

Very much like the sk3 hobby grade motor that seems to be the only thing worth putting on your board right now.  I imagine the tacon to be the same thing.  Tried tested and good at what it does.  With the right gearing.

No, I dont think so. The closest to our needs that Tacon produce is the 245Kv - 160 Bigfoot. But T-Max had a couple thats trespass the treashold (towards us), with a couple motors with 200Kv and 170 Kv respectively. I have a couple of their 200Kvs motors which are similar to the Tacons, and are also labeled by the stator denomination, not the can. Mine are called T-Max GT5335-10

Mine are 200Kv, but technically when being tested they come up 212Kv. Little higher on the spectrum. But just good enough for our needs.

Guys while this is very enlightening for us motor nerds poor old @WillieNelson  will be waking up from whatever country he's in and finding nothing useful.  He has the motors, he has the trucks he needs different info and we are probably not helping right now.  I on the other hand have found this to be very informative.  Lets wait till the man comes back on line before discussing the details.

If he has the Tacon 160 Bigfoot in fact, the best bet is to get the 218mm Torqueboards trucks and he'll get ample room to put those Tacons inside.

But u could drop the kv down going strand by strand with a multimeter and finding the starts and ends, solder all the ends together, and bam it’d be...about 150kv

Some other motors are opposite. For example the Turnigy SK3 is rated as a 6374 class motor, but their physical size goes opposite ways...is 59mm diameter x 82mm lenght. So both measures go out the boundaries a little bit, but still is a 6374 motor, true measures notwithstanding! (short in diameter by 4mm and big in lenght by 8mm)

I really don't think you can use HK as a bench mark.  They have no set pattern to how they measure motors.As you say the sk3 is 59x 84  the sk8 is 63x 82  Both classified as 6374 because the stators in both are the same size. Its the classification that I think is causing all the confusion.  The classification in motors is supposed to reflect the actual size of the unit so modellers/builders can use the info when putting together their projects.  If the physical size does not reflect the stated size then problems occur.  As now.

I've never heard of any "class" for motors. It's all usually based on (approximate) can size, or in Hobby King/Tacon cases, the stator size. Stator size is what really matters most though, and if we use SK3 stator/can sizes as reference, the Tacon 160 would be in the same "class" (stator size) as the 6364 SK3. Then there's the Torqueboards motors which throw some of that convention out the window by using larger stators, in 6355 sized motors, for example. From measuring with my own two hands:

**Motor / Stated can size / Actual stator length**
Tacon 160 /  6364 / 35mm stator
Turnigy SK3 / 6354 / 25mm stator
Turnigy SK3 / 6364 / 35mm stator
Turnigy SK3 / 6374 / 45mm stator
Torqueboards / 6355 / **30mm** stator 

Isn't this fun?! :crazy_face:

Not sure what to make of all the info. The motors "fit" during a quick mock up, but its real tight and not sure when everything gets tightened down if this will work. 

- I figured the Yuneec ECU wasn't going to work. Im totally fine with buying two  new ESC's. I'm jus concerned about having to program them? Im not the most computer savvy person. 

- I give all you credit! You guys are on top of the E-Board game. I appreciate all the info
