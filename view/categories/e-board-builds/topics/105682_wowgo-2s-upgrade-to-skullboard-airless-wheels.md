Hey guys,

Have been wondering if I can upgrade the Wowgo 2S with the Skullboard Airless motors/wheels (check pics below).

Any thoughts on that? Will the motors/esc work? Can I do it as a straight swap (motors and wheels only) or would I have to buy the complete kit? (last picture)

Thanks

They should both be 10s batteries so yeah, might have some trouble fitting a different ESC in, you should open your wowgo 2s first and measure the space

So I would definitely need to change the ESC, or? 
Read on another post that a guy simply added another layer of rubber to the wheels to make them a bit larger, but can't imagine how that would work...

If you have hub motors you can keep the esc

Mate. Do yourself a favour and avoid like the plague. These were slated when they came out a year ago. I had them as i needed a winter setup for my meepo build. They're slow and inefficient. They chewed through my Sanyo tesla battery in minutes. The tread pattern gives off a annoying vibration at slow speed. There's an new version which is better, you can get from boundmotor. Better tread pattern but like the 1st gen power hungry. Though they grip well on wet roads which is the sole reason i use them.

I really need something more "allroad" to handle the bumpy streets on my city, so if you guys have any suggestions, I would truly appreciate!

Hi,

I also have a set of sleeves for the Wowgo (90mm), but they are just standard as the pre-installed ones when new. They are okeyish, but as I said the streets on my city are pretty bumpy, so I'm searching for another solution for it. 

Read somewhere (reddit?) that someone installed (or simply recommended, can't recall on that) some rubber sleeves to the wheels, making it not only larger as more comfortable to ride. 
Any thoughts on that? 

Thanks

Just found these online, will it work on the 2S? Seem quite similar:

What about the idea of getting a rubber sleeve to cover the wheels/motors?

It does look great these Trampa setup, but how to adapt it (the wheels only) to my Wowgo 2S?
