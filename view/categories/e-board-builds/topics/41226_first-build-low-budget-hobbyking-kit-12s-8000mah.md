Hi everyone!

I think I finally got all of the parts narrowed down to start my first electric skateboard.
This is a budget build with a comfortable deck and long range in mind. Top speed of around 25-30 km/h is adequate for me.

I will be using the Turnigy Skateboard Electric Conversion Kit:

This is pretty much the cheapest combination of trucks, wheels, motor, mount, and vesc. Also I dont like buying things oversees cause of long shipping time and import taxes. 
I've read the trucks aren't the best but I can always upgrade those later.

This deck:

I like a deck that has a lot of flex, kinda like a boosted board. For the price this looks like the best option to me.

Two of these 6S 8000mAh Lipos in series:

Comes in at under 100 bucks for a 400Wh battery. I'll be charging these with a balance charger for now and get a bms later. Why no 18650's? Cause it looked like way too much work to assemble to me also I dont own a spot welder.

I'm wondering, at almost 5cm height are these too tall to put under my board? Will I need to put risers under my trucks?

Any suggestions are welcome!

Just a question do you plan to use this board often and do you want to spend more money later on or now?

When you get the trucks can you measure the hanger length and width for me

I'm using those batteries for testing right now. They work just fine.  They will sag voltage wise towards the end of the pack but they do have the ability to pull the amps close to their intended rating.  They are fairly thick though. I know they have the zippy 30c 8000 mAh 3s packs that are thinner.

That depends on how good I find it I guess. I've never rode an electric skateboard before.

I have one of these kits (3 weeks going strong). Have never ridden or built an electric skateboard before so I was super-worried that I hadn't got the parts list right while waiting 1.5months for it to turn up from AUS (I'm in New Zealand).

I am using two Turnigy 5S 5000mAH (20C?) batteries in series. Range is much better than I expected (3km commute). I'm not into speed (generally 22km/h). If I bail I want to be at a "comfortable crashing speed".

Thats exactly why I chose this battery :slight_smile:

 Skelstar, awesome! I'm gonna start slow but where I live it's like all flat long roads so some speed would be nice as  I get more experienced. Have you ever tried going top speed?

I haven't. It's early-mid summer at the moment so I'm not wearing anything resembling abrasion-resistant (I'm an ex-sports bike rider). I might have a go closer to winter.

I wear a lid all the time (even in the heat).

It's a great setup for commuting at 6am through the CBD. 10 mins door-to-door rather than 33mins power-walking. FUN.
