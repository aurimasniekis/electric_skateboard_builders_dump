I started off on this forum asking some questions about the battery of an off road E board i have however i am just going to leave that board how it is and attempt to build a different one :smiley:

So far here are the parts I have chose.
Motor - Turnigy Aerodrive sk3 6364 190kv
Battery - 2200mah 2s 3dc lipo's 5 wired in series
Speed controller - Unknown yet. (need to look more into Vesc)
Enertion motor mount (since this forum is amazing and has the 3d models for it i can have it machined)
Deck - standard longboard deck i have sitting at home with unknown brand trucks
Carbon fiber battery/esc case (luckily i have a friend who works with carbon fiber)
Enertion 12mm wide drive pulley kit
83mm enertion power wheels..

Am i missing anything? Should i go with V Esc or just stick to a regular esc for now?

If you have the budget for it, VESC is the way to go.
I doubt that the motor mount will fit your current trucks in it's current form. If you're having it machined maybe you need to change it to fit your truck. Otherwise, Caliber II trucks are a safe bet.

2200mah batteries is really weak. It'll work, but you will get no range from it. Minimum is around 4500-5000mah.

You will need two ESC's to be able to run dual motors.
Also, keep in mind this when buying things like that from ebay:

Changing the build up a little bit, I had a good amount of time to research and price out some parts here is the new list!

Wheels: 83mm Enertion power wheels
Trucks: Enertion Trucks
Belt/pulley: 12mm Enertion kit
Battery: 2 Turnigy 5000mah 5s 20c lipo's
Motor: Turnigy Aerodrive sk3 6364 213k
speed controller: Rotostar 120a HV brushless speed controller
Receiver: enertions nano x controller/receiver

The only thing im missing is a mount and a deck. The mount im going to have a friend fabricate and for the time being i will probably just use an old deck i have laying around.

Im pretty sure this is everything.. let me know if im missing anything!
