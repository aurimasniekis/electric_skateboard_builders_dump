Okay... so the time has come. 
This will be my first build.
I've Tried to do a fair amount of research and buy Quality Parts. I'm very mechanically inclined but I've always been intimidated by anything electrical.
So bear with me.
Let's get to the fun stuff I can talk more about me later.
Parts list.
‚Ä¢Two 6374 170kv motors from @mmaner 
‚Ä¢Two Focboxes from @Scoo_B_SK8
‚Ä¢Cnc focbox heatsink case from @Kug3lis

‚Ä¢Getting Custom Mandalorian "x-things" from @akhlut 
‚Ä¢Random bits from @ARetardedPillow @Wilsonliang777 and @mmaner 
Might pick up a Bluetooth mod... idk yet. Kinda broke now lol
Need to pick up new bearings and a charger still.

Luckily @monsterbuilder is local to me and has experience soldering. So hes gonna be helping me with my connections.
I plan on doing some @longhairedboy style grip with glass frit. But I may put patches of normal grip tape at first because I'm having a hard time getting a design I'm completely happy with.
Still waiting on half the parts but I thought it was time to write it all out.
Oh and i got a dope Pass helmet from @Mikenopolis 
I've been doing board sports my whole life. This is the first one that's gotten me into a helmet.

I'm really excited to try out these Precision trucks. I'm half tempted to throw them on one of my push boards just to try them out and ride them around. But the hills here are meh....and I haven't had time for much of anything lately.
I had originally planned to order all new bushings from Riptide but I figured it's probably a good idea to ride the board first and then figure out where I need to go from there.

My next step after I get the board running solid, I'm going to go through the process of making it as waterproof / resistant as I can. 
It rains a lot in the Pacific Northwest and I'd like to ride this thing year-round as much as possible.

I‚Äôm to try and get it water resistant out the gate but easier said than done for me probably.

Really good deal with your SRs. I might just grab a set of percision trucks later on but I think I can get close to percision with tweaks to the tb218s like the riptide bushings and pivot cups but I plan on riding them without the riptide bushings so I get an idea of how much they affect and improve the ride.

[quote="Deckoz, post:5, topic:66705"]
I run FOCBOX on 13s with 120A motor current. You see, the FETS are rated at 75v and upto 250A with proper cooling, if I‚Äôm not mistaken (need to check the data sheet again). The Focbox copper pours are rated for 50A @ 60V.

ESC are basically a buck converter. Varying the duty cycle. You can find lots of my posts on duty cycle. But the answer is simple.

Motor Max 120
Battery Max 50
Voltage 54.6

54.6V * 50A = 2730Watts
2730Watts / 120A = 22.75v
22.75V / 54.6V = 41% duty cycle.

So above 41% duty cycle the motor amperage will drop the meet the maximum battery amperage/wattage.

2730W / (54.6V * 42% Duty) = 119A
2730W / (54.6V * 43% Duty) = 116A

And below 41% the motor amperage can be upto 120A. Meaning more power to the ground during acceleration giving you your maximum output potential throughout the entire band. For example. Duty cycle comparison of actual output

Motor Max 60A
(54.6V * 10% Duty) * 60A = 327Watts
(54.6V * 20% Duty) * 60A = 655Watts
(54.6V * 30% Duty) * 60A = 982Watts

Motor Max 120A
(54.6V * 10% Duty) * 120A = 655Watts
(54.6V * 20% Duty) * 120A = 1310Watts
(54.6V * 30% Duty) * 120A = 1965Watts

As you can see, all examples are lower than the Battery Max 50A @ 54.6v (2730 watts) and also within the limits of the pours, 50A @ 60v (3000Watts), and the amperage is well under 75% of the rating on the FETs.

So with the right cooling for the ESC, a big battery and the capability of the ESC, why leave all that power on the table if you are within the limitations of the hardware‚Ä¶

Just saying

Edit: my point to this in the original topic of the thread, was sensored FOC helps the controllers accurately calculate motor angle, so no power is wasted from bad timing. The mixture of a clean phase timing, with lots of power, and traction control enabled so that the controllers can measure slip and not torque out makes the whole combo turn into :rocket:sauce.

It's more that I'm  mounting my focboxes up top above the rear truck in one of the @Kug3lis cnc cases. So I kind of want to extend the wires coming directly off the focfox anyways. Otherwise the adapters will kinda be bulging in my wiring harness right in view.....

Ugh! I asked you / @psychotiller for one last time I was over too, and I was even going to pay for it! WTF! What gives sir..... : :cry:

On a serious note though Dave, do you have any of the camo snapbacks left right now for me.....? And if not do you have any snapbacks at all left in any color I can swoop from ya? I can't wear a flexfit or any other hat beside a snapback or fitted (preferably New Era) since I have an abnormally Large head..... pretty please and thank you in advance! 

On another note @psychotiller Justin and I were actually talking today and I've been meaning to hit you up, just been busy till now, but we wanted to see if we can take you up on that offer of doing a battery clinic with ya at your shop (this weekend any time that works for you if possible) cause I have 40 cells I wanna turn into a 10s4p to make an extra set up for guest that don't have a board when they're at my pad since it happens daily. Cause I literally have all the spare parts from random builds / old setups and the only thing I am missing is a battery.... got a deck (either a brand new teseract or a very lightly used Bustin with the same shape I used for a short amount of time on my least set up), paris V2 truck, koowheel hub motor and ESC, plenty of bearings and hardware, fresh piece of the foam griptape from hammer, either abec clones or a new set of enertion 97mm wheels, the @psychotiller enclosure from you,  that one BMS already wired that i got from ya too, is there anything else that I'm not thinking of....

Anyway, lol, lmk if you're around and open for that this weekend at all Dave @psychotiller. Would be GREATLY appreciated and obviously the beers, lunch, and any materials I might not have and need to use are on me!!!!

Text me or hit me back here when you have a chance brotha.

Thanks so much in advance homie!

Was just doing some measuring in my head, mounting focboxs or even for my dual vesc, it will be so damn tight, if not won't fit if the enclosure is the arc v2. The v2 only provides about 16-17mm oh height clearance while the cutout is about 13mm deep. Total is about 30mm of height space. 60 cells will use up about 545mm of space in length if packed in two whole straight lines (in which the cutout is about 580mm) leaving about 35mm of space left. 

So if I maths, cells are about 18mm tall and VESCS are as tall as 15-16mm... there might be a slight 3mm issue... at least from a theoretical perspective. God I am anxious to get my own build running with my Hummie deck as well.

Im super happy with how they turned out.
They definitely look better from a few feet away (paint)
The brushes I bought were falling apart and made it really hard to do detail work.
It's just basic model car paint with a few light layers that clear.
At some point I may remove the paint and pull out my airbrush and liquid latex and try and do a more professional aged look.
But this gave me a project to do in my lap while I was sick with the flu.

Right now your board thinks the battery is too low so it protects it by slowing down your board.

I would have thought that it was your board going into limp mode and your battery monitor isn't true. Possibly set up for 10s. Best thing would be to get your hands on a multimeter or change the battery meter to voltage rather than percentage. then you can see what's going on.

If it does then you're good. If it comes up with another number then press the button until it cycles to 12 then turn the battery off again. It should then be set to 12s.

Just tell him what you've been up to. Looks like the battery monitor has escaped their attention on setup. So likely that the battery was shipped empty (but showing full) and you've taken it low. Should be fine but Dave will likely run you through a check or two with your multi meter to make sure all is well.
Then charge it and pee your pants.

The VESC tool default battery cutoff start for 12S is 40.80V.
So with a battery charged at 40V the moment you try and draw any serious current the voltage drops below that and the power is seriously limited.

The focboxes are each in the single cnc case Kug3lis makes. But they both have the holes on the left. So the cable has to go out the case, up and over the case than back in the other.
It just won't reach. 
I was going to use the dual cnc case but it wont fit in the enclosure

But it was bound to get scraped up so :man_shrugging:
It seems like a well-built loopkey is more reliable anyways.

I did get the board to full speed a few times before it blew.
So much fun. 
I Wanna go faster @dareno 

Also I'm slightly worried about my motor clearance.
I can't raise them up anymore without them hitting the deck during a turn but they're scraping more than i like. 

Option A) forget mounting drop through and just top mount that should give me more room to adjust the mounts.
Option B) take a file to the rear of the deck like I did for the hangers and make a little more room for the motors.

I also check motor pullys, wheel pullys and axles before each trips. (To and from the store is two trips)
Im still adjusting things, adding stuff .
And id kinda like to take it completely apart and not only paint but document the build properly .

That can make all the difference because it could create bad solder joints.  It doesnt have to be top of the line but as long as it heats reliably and has adjustable heat control as some solder heats at higher temps.  I got one years ago from Harbor Freight and it sucked but got the job done for the small project I needed it for.  If I need to use one now I have 2 nice soldering stations at work to play with.

Wheels are on. 
Install was a breeze even with only having one good hand.  Got the haggy pullys to work on surfrodz trucks pretty easy.  (Even for a noob like me)
Can't wait to road test them. 

Also. Thanks to _source code_ i can turn my board on and off without removing the enclosure.  Nice solid andy, i mean loopkey.

Tossed my maytech 6374 from @hyperIon1 on my board with the tkps & 107mm abec 11s. Took a ride around Portland with @SeanHacker and @DerelictRobot   

Damn this board rides nice. Longest ride I've gone on. And first time riding with anyone.  Great fucking time. 

Got back.  Put boards on chargers and ate some food. 
Decided to toss the haggywheels from @riverside.rider on there......
Wow.  Night and day. Completely different board. All three of us fell in love with these wheels.

So after putting about 35 miles on this board with tkp rather than rkp im torn.... 
Board was intended to be rkp on urethane.  Now its tkp on pneumatic. 
Had a top speed of 38mph from my metr pro.
Oh yeah lol. Installed a metr pro. Took seconds with @DerelictRobot help.
Finally running my motors with sensors too.
No canbus yet....
But still. 
Thing loves to carve.  I was carving pretty hard in the 30 mph range. Lots of fun.
Next step is installing my double stack enclosure from @bigben

Go with rkp and pneumatics.
We get older, we want more comfort.

Let the young guys rattle their tooth fillings out.

This thing rides like butter on tkp.
But the tkp will probably go on the Redember deck wity pneumatic.  This will go back to urethane and rkp in time. Probably idk anymore lol

Any wheel-bite with the bergmeisters + TKP + Hummie deck? Seems like a dream combo, why wouldn't you want to keep this setup? :smiley:

No wheel bite.  Almost have hanger bite but i removed some wood with a file to give it a bit of clearance.

I have a Redember shuggah deck on its way. It was intended to be my Carver and this was supposed to be a pure speed build.

Really just tossed this together so i had something to ride while in port. 
Like it way more than i thought i would.....

Ill have to play around with both decks and i guess we'll see what happens.

Dude that board just made a tangible dent in my future wallet. As if I need more builds on my plate this spring.

@Skunk and I went on a Mt. Tabor run this morning before he shipped back off to the war. Switching between my custom Channel/LaCroix & his TKP/Hummie was a lot of fun, and I was surprised at how similarly they handle. 

Mine still feels like a boat adrift at sea below 10mph though, where his has full carving capability from the start. I did feel more steady carving at 25+ on mine, but he seemed to have no issue with it so it's likely just a difference in board confidence/familiarity. 

I'll say this though, Kelly may be king of shitpost mountain but damn he can ride. Fuckin broken arm and he hit 38mph on a board that can do figure eights from a standstill. Crazy fuck.

Thanks for the comparison between the two. Really helpful, because I'm looking for a board that could easily carve even at low speeds, for when I need to make a turn across incoming traffic.

Tkp are extremely responsive.  
This is my first time using them on a board bigger than 31inchs. I was very impressed.  I see why @mmaner loves them. The surfrodz tkp are different than any tkp I've ridden before too. 
Im yet to play with the adjustable baseplate. im quite curious what that will affect.

It's also probably important to mention your drop through mounting of your TKPs. I do think keeping your deck so low is part of the secret sauce to why that board responded so well even at speed. I'm not sure I'd want them top mounted.

Low center of gravity is nice on a Carver for sure. 
Can't wait for you to try this thing on rkp.

Board going up for sale later tonight. 

Hate to do this but..... no choice. 


* Deck - hummie single cutout 
* Trucks- surfrodz tkp or rkp (you pic)
* Wheels- abec 107 or pneumatic (you pic)
* Vesc- focboxes
* Battery - psychotiller 12s4p
* Motors- maytech 190kv 6374
* Remote- mini trigger 
* Enclosure- psychotiller 

+ cnc case on both focboxes,  b264 loopkey, extra double stack enclosure from @bigben 

Motors have about 50 miles on them.  Whole board probably has no more than 75 miles on it. 
Battery has been charged a hand full of times.
