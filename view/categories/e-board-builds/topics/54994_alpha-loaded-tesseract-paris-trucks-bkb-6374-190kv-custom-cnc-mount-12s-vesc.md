Hey guys, just wanted to show you my first build here. I've been doing lots of research/buying/machining over the last few months, and the build is almost complete. I decided to try make things where I could (I'm an engineer and I'm fortunate enough to have access to some great tools and machines), and as a result the whole thing has taken a very long time... but I'm pretty happy with it so far, learned some new techniques and had good fun along the way!

The detailed specs are:

Board: Loaded Tesseract (used, bought off a local for cheap)
Trucks: Paris V2 180mm in silver
Wheels: 83mm Flywheel Clones
Battery: Torqueboards 12S3P 30Q @torqueboards 
ESC: Torqueboards VESC
Motor: Build Kit Boards 6374 190kv @JLabs 
Remote: Mini Remote & Receiver from eBay
Motor Mount: Custom CNC Milled Hub + Motor Mounting Plate + Belt Cover
Enclosure: Custom Carbon Fibre Enclosure (with inspiration from @MasterCho)

This is the CAD for the drive system. I got the files for the Paris trucks off a very helpful Grabcad member (https://grabcad.com/david.doluca-1)!

I then thought it'd be a good idea to make a carbon fibre enclosure from scratch. Ended up taking forever, working on it bit by bit after work. I used a 3D scanner to scan the bottom surface of the board, to get the enclosure to follow the contour of the board. Ended up with the full CAD of the board:
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_daf|690x415](upload://lFSsAwfSmTUWuaMneZSYYCC488n.jpg)

Then I got some 9mm MDF, laser cut into the layers that would form the mould. Laser cutting the sheets beforehand meant that I wouldn't have to rough out as much wood, for a quicker CNC job.
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_d9e|666x500](upload://jQQNW19wvpcHuDlqSal2KF9ckcw.jpg)

![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_da0|375x500](upload://uIVM1FwKtVA5kBWF7bI1J7FwOMb.jpg)

I then glued all the sheets together, and machined the mould on my buddy's CNC router (some of his cool stuff can be seen here: https://jeremyyoungdesign.com/)
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_dc4|666x500](upload://4IO6OwcqPa7K180lL0EkIlhILsx.jpg)

![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_dc9|375x500](upload://wigNU4u0WP3azwzCQTOKYLgVPHM.jpg)

Quite happy with the results! We didn't do too fine stepovers because we didn't have too much time, and I was going to have to sand the crap out of it anyway:
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_dca|375x500](upload://nPixMf2HMr03TZ02jmq5tfohi4j.jpg)

After much sanding, I used some polyester resin to seal the MDF mould... and sanded it some more after that. Some black spray paint was used to help identify the low spots, I think this is called a guide coat?
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_ddc|666x500](upload://fsEqzN9L18sKALqky4iietf3nIb.jpg)
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e22|666x500](upload://wQUqT9HONqTBCHgDAAjf3xuQ8tQ.jpg)

At this point I was seriously questioning the effort gone into making a mould for a one off part. Oh well. I used some of this stuff to wax the mould to help release the part:
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e23|375x500](upload://tuuLfJSWAsNJr61M9Lxm0yw8buo.jpg)
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e24|375x500](upload://jR7jSZnWWZfPd5pHQITwAiBmTQQ.jpg)
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e25|666x500](upload://awItGhTZmxciHawHnvgNZwcQQiQ.jpg)

And finally the mould was ready! I got some sheets of 200 gsm twill carbon fibre and 200 gsm plain weave fibreglass. The idea was to do 2 layers of carbon, followed by 4 layers of fibreglass. My buddy Max (check out some of his awesome work here: www.maxbetteridgedesign.com - amongst many things he has built a very unique electric longboard, and an absolutely jawdroppingly slick Ducati Monster Cafe Racer) showed me some parts he had made with a similar layup and we decided it was going to have the right thickness and strength.

Laying down the fibreglass, cutting out gussets to help reduce wrinkles:
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e39|666x500](upload://oC5XVsOHiLB85xn6KDyYiEjk3Y6.jpg)

I took a timelapse video of the layup for Instagram. Here's a gif of it: https://gfycat.com/HeavenlyJaggedBoaconstrictor

And this was the part fresh from the tool - some of the mould came off with the part! Woops. Nothing that can't be scraped off though:
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e3f|666x500](upload://clTpE27PTSHyqwPFaTIMfUYGpl6.jpg)
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e40|375x500](upload://8ON9jb0Lje7Wk32sY9NKwVM5KYM.jpg)

After scraping off the excess MDF and trimming the part with a Dremel, here is the enclosure laid up against the board.
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e41|375x500](upload://pSF0n3xjuJezQ5UgrxGrGPlCqUR.jpg)

I didn't want to polish bare carbon, so I gave the surface a coat of epoxy resin:
![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e42|375x500](upload://fb9S6KRAY5MgZrPPmvBjIgsqWBw.jpg)

And that's about where it is right now. There's still some bubbles and stuff on the surface of the enclosure, I might try sand and polish that if I get the time, but I'm not sure if I can be bothered because it's going to get scratched up eventually anyway. Next up is drilling the board and wiring it up, can't wait to actually take this out for a spin!

Cheers to @onloop for this great platform where we can discuss and share builds. I think 99% of my research regarding building an electric skateboard came from this site, it's been a huge help!

Feel free to ask questions and give some feedback!

Wow! I'm really impressed with the work. Thanks for the grabcad shout-out ;)

How did you lathe the trucks? I didn't have to for my first and second build with them, but I want to for my next. Since it's so off balance, what kind of speed did you turn it at?
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: ashe Posted at: 2018-05-10T13:54:50.969Z Reads: 355

```
no probs man, thanks for providing the files!

turning the trucks was definitely the scariest part of this build. i clamped one end of the truck axle on the chuck, and on the other end, i slid the axle into a cylindrical bushing with 8mm internal diameter, which was then clamped onto a drill chuck on the tailstock. i cant quite remember the speed i was turning at, it would have been between 80-200 rpm or so, luckily i found a good feed rate to achieve a good finish for the final pass.

when mounting the trucks i did find that the axles werent entirely concentric. when i clamped one end the other end needed some slight persuasion to align it inside the bushing. i used some lubricant to help with the spinning. i guess this means that the surfaces i turned arent exactly concentric to either end of the axle, but rather an average of the two ends. seems to be accurate enough though!

Yes, I've found that my axles aren't entirely colinear as well. Good to know that just forcing it is going to work :slight_smile:

Hopefully I'll be able to turn mine within the next few days.

this is the next level cnc diy stuff. Btw, how would you adjust your belt tension. Based on motor mount setup, I don't see a way to adjust tension unless u installed a belt pulley.

youre right, theres no way to adjust the tension. i used an online centre to centre distance calculator based on my pulleys and belt length and designed my motor mounting plate off that - the tension is pretty good, not too tight and not too slack

So I managed to put the whole board together and get it going! Here are some photos from when I left off. The thick resin layer was sanded back:
![IMG_0957|666x500](upload://sQglk9mGoai21YlIAfC8Y2ICjqV.jpg)

And UV resistant clear coat was applied to the enclosure. I was pretty new at all this so the finish isn't perfect, there's pinholes and such but I couldn't be bothered sanding and applying another layer of clear. Pretty happy with the results regardless. This is with the first pass of clear:
![IMG_0963|375x500](upload://iZQ6TlPtoe1p2K2EXKGe56jq2dl.jpg)

This is after sanding to 3000 grit and polishing:
![IMG_0971|374x499](upload://fGIiNdf1LaXQN2UQgbLKqrWv86j.jpg)

I thought it'd be a shame to hide the nice Loaded badge under the enclosure so I slapped it on top (and hid some voids in the clear coat finish haha)
![IMG_0981|374x500](upload://t7mscGztQrXg0EZ1aWDn7wqMrSz.jpg)

I didn't take any photos of the inside, but I used some velcro to hold the battery in position along with some foam padding for protection/vibration dampening. Here's the board fully assembled for the first time.
![IMG_0995b|387x500](upload://oMHteY9dZ2tLmFckP6SYAvqhKwZ.jpg)
![img_1006|375x500](upload://nDJrYGWrc3vreNYFrghkqG1TWxl.jpg)

Took it out for a spin in the carpark with a buddy, it was a blast! 
![IMG_1446|690x459](upload://vvJMajmKk3qFttTKTtDVLzVNz0i.jpg)

I still need to do some final bits and bobs before the build is complete. My friend noticed that when the board flexes the top and bottom lip of the enclosure actually gets exposed, even with 5mm foam, so I'm going to have to figure out how to seal that up properly. I'd like to cover up the power button hole/charging port hole with something. Also the grip tape now has a bunch of holes so I'd like to give it some fresh stuff to cover them up, maybe do a cool pattern with the laser cutter.

I measured the dimensions of the button/charging port/voltage display on the battery, drew it out on some paper, cut out the holes with scissors and made adjustments until it was perfect! Then I laid that template down on the enclosure and used a Dremel to cut the cutouts.
