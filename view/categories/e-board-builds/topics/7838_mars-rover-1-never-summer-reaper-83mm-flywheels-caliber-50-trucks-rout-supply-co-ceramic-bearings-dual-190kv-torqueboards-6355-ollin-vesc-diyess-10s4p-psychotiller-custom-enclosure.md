Hello everyone,

I have been lurking for a couple of weeks and researching like crazy. When I discovered the existence  of the boosted board, I decided I had to have an eboard. I put my 50cc scooter that I commute on up for sale immediately to get some start up money and started researching. Then I put it a pre-order for the Boosted (which I have yet to cancel, I am an indecisive person). After more reading I discovered the DIY community and the performance a DIY board can achieve. I like a good project and I suspect I want more speed than the boosted offers. 

As for longboarding experience, I was super into downhill for a good 5 years starting back in 2001. At the time it felt like I was part of the beginning of a sport and I got all of my friends started into longboards and downhill. I'm 30 now and these eboards have brought those feelings back of being in high school and seeking out the best ride and hills to bomb. And now there's brakes!?

Anyway, I'm going to post my shopping list and I would love to hear if any of my plans are wrong or misguided. I don't have a ton of money but I do have a wife. So spending money burning out parts isn't really an option. I need to get this pretty much right the first time. My budget is about $1500 (boosted price) and I am hoping to achieve boosted levels of reliability in my build. 

I've kind of given up on the idea of building my own battery (no experience, no tools, and installing buttons, BMS, lcd screens, etc all sound difficult. Maybe a good project down the road)

Wow, this is getting long. Sorry. My shopping list:

?cxecrt-retrieve-cart=5247

Deck: Looking at the Never Summer [Reaper](http://www.neversummer.com/longboards/reaper-1) ( I need to call a board shop and bug them about wheel size on this deck) 

Wheels: 83mm flywheels 75a

Bearings: Budget dependant, I want ceramic

Trucks: Calibur II 50 degree

Motor: Torqueboards 170kv sensored 6355
Mounts: TB Motor Mounts
Battery: TB 12s3p Battery Pack with 4a charger
ESC: VESC from DIYelectricskateboards
16/36 pulleys and belts from TB (might pick up a 13T to play with)
Enclosures: Unknown (I think the TB battery has its own?)

As a graphic designer, I have access to a large scale vinyl printer/plotter and will be applying my own deck graphics after everything is up and running. 

So, my questions:

Did I pick the right stuff? 
Is this a good or bad Idea?
Should I just wait 3 months for the boosted and live with 22mph top speed?
Is this the best dealer to buy from? Best source for a VESC? (Im scared of blowing it up upon motor detection)
I can't take that battery on a plane, suggestions for a cheap small one to switch out?
What do you think about that deck? Im concerned about wheel size on it.
Will a build like this last a long time or breakdown and be a pain in my ass?

Thank you for reading and you guys are awesome. Also, I used the chat feature on  and Dexter was very helpful and quick to respond. So far I am very impressed with those guys (aside from their product photos, not entirely clear)

Thanks!

Sounds like it'll be a nice build! Make sure to update on how the deck graphics go, I was thinking about maybe trying wood burning a design onto a few. Just so you know, for max speed the MEB 12s battery that @oriol360 sells has received outstanding reviews for power and reliability. Also, if you want speed over torque a higher Kv motor tends to go faster. Just thoughts, but your current plan looks good.

Originally I had selected the 190kv motor. While grilling Dexter at diyelectricboard.com, he recommended the 170kv over the 190kv "to be on the safe side for the current VESC version" when running a 12s pack. I definitely want to be on the safe side when it comes to building a robust board. Thanks for the battery recommendation, I'll check that out.

Hmm i think you should go with 190kv and 10s, i should buy the dual drive motor kit from.enertion, and 2 vescs from @chaka or enertion. Chaka's vesc are already checked so if ur worrying about blow things up, buy one from him. For a battery you can look for space cell pro 4 and for devk, arbor james kelly model or honey velocity v2

i'm interested in how you apply the graphics. I've been trying to think of ways to get printouts onto my boards for use iunder the clear grip that i do, so i'll be watching this thread with interest.

i found this cheap and easy way to do it but it looks very error prone:

I used to work in a sign shop and we did vehicle wraps. You can essentially print any image onto a high grade vehicle vinyl rated to last 7 years outdoors. Installation can be tricky over contours but a bit of head from a blow dryer would help soften the vinyl and allow it to contour. Beware applying vinyl to ABS plastic enclosures as the plastic material does not hold the adhesive. If you have a high res image file you can contact your local sign shop and get a printing and/or install quote usually based on size.

For me, that's the final step. Im far more concerned with building the best most reliable board that I can. Then I'll make it pretty :)

Hey @longhairedboy. I've been eying your scarlett deck to do my build on. That NW reaper, a landyatchz 10 to 4 and the LHB deck are the three I've been considering. The reaper has weird contours on the bottom and I see having problems mounting things to it. 

As far as laying a clear coat of grip tape over a vinyl graphic, I can't speak to weather that would hold or not.  

Something like [this](https://www.fellers.com/fellers-shopping/cat/white-inkjet-vinyls/sub/perforated-inkjet-window-films/set/3m-window-graphic-film-8170-p50-50-50-and-8170-p40-60-40) might work. Its perforated for use on windows so you can see the graphic but still get light through a window. The holes in the material should allow any adhesive over the top to reach the wood below.

Edit: Sublimation is also an option, but probably not cost effective on a small scale and I believe requires dies or molds to accomplish.

Is there a specific reason for going with enertion motors over the TB motors? Same question for the battery. 

I'd really like to go with a lifepo4 pack for safety and lifespan but I have yet to see a full featured one out there (power button, lcd screen, etc). I have little/no experience with wiring and soldering so a DIY battery scares me a bit. Especially when adding in peripheral features.

Yeah cause 190kv will give you more speed, and k think also 190kv 10s is safer than 170kv at 12s, i but i doesnt have to be the enrtion kit, but if you calculate everything, it will cost more than buying everything seperatly.

So far, I'm leaning toward using  because they're US based and so far I've had a good expeirence with their customer service. If enertion's motors are better quality, that would get me to go that route. Their bundles, however, don't include a VESC and based on what I've read VESC is the way to go. Also, most bundles I've seen include clones of trucks and wheels and I simply don't trust a clone wheel. Back in the day I rode all abec 11 and they were seriously good wheels. Plus I think I saw a video where a guy put 20 miles on some abec clones and they had huge chucks taken out of them. 

I'll look into 190kv with 10s though. For speed I'd like a real world top speed around 32 mph and plenty of torque. 

Also, thanks for all the replies everyone. Nice forum ya got here :)

Well, i think Enertion does have good quality trucks, but if you want another pair, you could. Oh and you could just buy the vesc apart. But in your case, go for it,  but keep in mind that 190kv at 10s goes also alot, like alot alot faster than a boosted board. I think there's no need for 12s, but yeah you decide what you wznt!

@Spek - I'm Dexter from DIYES. Our motors are high quality motors specifically our latest 6355 170KV and 6355 190KV motors as we have upgraded the stator added more durable retaining rings. These added features increased the price but they are still the same price they have always been which makes them much more affordable because we take a smaller margin.

Our VESCs are high quality and you get what's pictured. Each VESC is confirmed and tested twice to confirm that it is 100% working prior to shipping out.

One thing you should know is this is an Enertion forum so you have countless fanboys on here. No offense to anybody, just stating the obvious some of Enertion products are good quality.

As for our wheels, I haven't clunked any of my ABEC clones.

We also have our 10S4P 12S3P packs which will now also include enclosures with a 30amp cont/80amp peak rating.

Hey Dexter. I was reading yesterday about motor detection on the VESC and how they blow out the first time they receive power. Do you guys charge the capacitor before shipping so they're basically plug and play? The article or thread I was reading had guys buying these expensive lab power supplies just to turn on the VESC for the first time - and that is my concern. Thanks for chiming in

@Spek - I haven't had any issues with the VESC blowing up upon connection. I've tested well over 600 of our VESCs by hand. Not sure what you mean by the capacitor being charged, that's not really needed. It's easier if you have a flat pack that has an on/off switch. You can check our youtube for more info on VESC setup - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTvBTevjSrhrWIOTWkWKcgA. It's fairly easy.

Sounds like a great build!  I think your specs look great and the 170 vs 190kv motors is really going to depend on your needed top speed.  Not being a downhill guy (ever) - going 20+ on an esk8 is *plenty* fast for me.  I gear for a top speed of 25 and have seen 30mph once (tail wind?).  Usually probably cruise around 15-20 (22.6 says gps last weekend on Marbel).

Deck is preference.  Best part of DIY is ability to make an esk8 from your favorite deck or deck type that normally isn't offered.  Being a former DH guy - do you want super stiff, or want more like the boosted (definitely some flex)?  I've ridden my buddies Dual+ (v1) and my Marbel - very different ride quality.  The flex of the Vanguard is great for rough surfaces, and honestly it's a well dialed in setup.  My Marbel is good, but being stiffer it transmits a lot more vibration.  Looking forward to the 100mm wheels to help dampen.

If you want flex - the Vanguard deck is great (there's others too that flex well).  Otherwise you may be able to re-purpose an old DH deck if you want to too!

Your VESC won't blow up spontaneously (yes some fail - MTBF).  Mostly i try to use my VESC's a bit conservatively.  @Chaka had a great writeup detailing some recommended setups to stay below 60k ERPM.  Ultimately i usually stick around 8s and it works well for me.  But may do 9 or 12s on next build - just being a bit more gentle when pack is full and avoid beating up on them too much.

Wheel size is a great question.  I suggest the 83mm flywheel or clone to start.  If you can go larger - i'm a fan of monster wheels (97's my current favorite but trying to see if i can fit some e-fly 107mm's!).  They roll better over rough surfaces, but you need a big cutout symmetrical deck or similar to comfortably fit (without monster risers).

Definitely get some more motor pulleys.  I'm also looking forward to trying DIYes 40t (vs 36t) flywheel gears.  A thing i love about DIYes wheel gears is their quality construction and aluminum vs injection molded which seems to be more and more common (just more economical maybe?).  

What are you going to do for charging?  check out the iMax B6ACv2 - my favorite budget but quality charger.

Great questions and i'm looking forward to seeing your build!  hope to help more if you have other questions i can help with.

I actually owned a loaded back in... idk, 2004. Loved that deck but I wouldn't go faster than boosted's 22mph on it. That flex is great for bumps in the road and vibration. Also very fun for carving. The problem is that flex seems to also absorb your weight when making turns and steals traction from your wheels. Sliding is fun but only when you want it to slide. 

In my experience you want your deck to be as stiff and as low as possible. Adding risers to a board makes it feel less stable at speed. At one point I owned about 8 complete longboards, all with their different uses. They were all stollen one day and it still pisses me off haha. The decks I do have are not ideal for an eBoard build (landyachtz evo and some lanytachz flexy bamboo fiberglass pintail). 

As far as speed goes I used to have about a 30mph tolerance before the terror set in. A lot of that terror came from lack of brakes and bombing hills alongside cars. I don't want to find myself riding a boosted board and wanting more speed and my money back. And yea, that loaded deck is fun as hell, but not my choice for going fast.  

Monster wheels are nice for speed but they also get you higher off the ground which makes the ride feel more squirly at speed. My ideal size was always 70mm for an analog board but I think for the application 83mm sounds like the best of both worlds in terms of size.

One of the reasons I'm drawn to DIY's batteries is the included fast 4a charger so that's my current plan for charging. Right now I don't really want to deal with finding a separate battery and charger. For this first build I'm going to leave the batteries to the professionals and save building my own for when I've got some actual experience working with this stuff. My plan is to actually build a <100wh battery for air travel as a DIY project when the time is right. By then I'll have a better understanding of all the connectors and whatnot.

I think now I'm leaning toward their 10s4P pack but there's a note at the bottom of the description that the enclosure is still in development. Can anyone tell me what their enclosures are like? Is it something you can mount directly to the board or are they referring to a shrink wrap enclosure for protection only?

Also, thanks everyone for all the responses. Its helping me work out my thoughts and I'm getting even more pumped to build this beast.

The time it took to write my long winded response - all these others commented and i missed them!  (at work in meetings, so i have a decent excuse)  I would've been the first response otherwise.

Vedder recommended using a low amperage power supply - either a lab supply you can limit to just a few amps, or a smaller battery pack to power it the first time.  I'm not 100% certain why, but it's what i've done on mine ( have 5 VESCs now i think - most all older hw4.7/4.8 and one newer 4.11).  I take a small tired Traxxas 3s lipo and use it to power the VESC and program it the first time (do motor discovery, etc.).

Easy Peasy.  Don't need no lab power supply!

Can't go wrong with the li-ion 18650 packs!  BMS and plug and forget charging is nice!

Agree on big wheels and ride height - why i love a good drop deck.  Also not something you can find except DIY!  My favorite board was my custom subsonic e-GBomb w/ 97's:
[img]https://goo.gl/7l8ueL[/img]
Evening ride w/ my buddy and his Dual+

Unfortunately that board was stolen and i'm slowly rebuilding v2.  (bigger better faster stronger!)  I got a custom subsonic deck from Scott (they moved their shop on my commute home!) - a slightly different shape and thicker for enclosing the electronics!  

If you want to keep ride height lower - you can also use the Flywheel gears w/ the smaller 76mm flywheels!  They have the same hub and are super light compared to the larger 83mm wheels (190g vs 330g ea).

Some example setups and speed calculations.  I got an old xlsx from Beetbocks and his has been the closes real-world for me.  I have a newer one that also shows ERPM which is nice, but it typically shows about 2mph faster.

Adjusting just the motor pulley to 16 from 14 gets you 26.29359.

And if you want to go faster - also look at the 190kv motor DIYes has available - same setups now would get:

83mm w/ 190kv,  12s, 14/36 = 28mph
76mm w/ 190kv, 12s, 14/36 = 25.7
same 76mm w/ 16/36 = 29.4

That's a crazy deck. I've never seen metal drops like that. Is it custom? 

I just talked to an old friend who races downhill competitively and he said to go with kegels 100%. His words "wheels are way better now'days". I believe him. That's why I made the comment about the wheel clones above. Yeah theres the shape/design but Urethane isn't like cloning a truck where you pick a commonly used and trusted steel. It always seemed like they had their secret formulas. I remember my first set of abec 11 wheels after riding sector 9's house brand. Back then there were only a few longboard companies and sector 9 was the one you'd see everywhere. When abec 11 wheels were new on the scene it was an amazing difference. 

Also the wheel design plays a huge roll. The kegels have that sharp angle on the lip which provides a ton of traction as opposed to the flywheels' rounded corners. Good for cruising but they were not the best carvers. 

This leads to my next line of queationing: kegel wheel pulleys. I see that @torqueboards has some for sale but a 9mm belt sounds very small. What's the best option there?

I'm starting to look into doing enclosures in fibreglass. Looks easy to work with and fairly simple to form to the desired shape. It also can take vinyl graphics, unlike ABS. 

@longhairedboy When I was young I built crappy decks in my garage and encorporated fiberglass into them. I wanted graphics so I printed some designs on paper and put a layer of fiberglass resin over the paper. It looked really professional for how easy it was. Sort of formed a clear coat and saturated the fibrous paper just like it was intended to do. That would give you an effective, cheap and easy solution. You could even take your favorite tshirt and add some glass. Fiberglass! 

Sorry I tend to write my train of thought and it gets long and takes tangets

nope - [Gbomblongboards,com](http://www.gbomblongboards.com/index.html).  Great setups.  The brackets are awesome, and the deck was a Subsonic custom (for my weight CF reinforced).  They're known more for LDP.  Super cool setup and the aluminum does a good job absorbing some of the bumps as a bonus.
[img]https://goo.gl/c1xFhU[/img] 
great ride height - lower than my buddies Dual+ with 80's (and im on 97's here)  Didn't get to finish cleaning it up before stolen (phase wires and velcro was temp).

Wheels - Kegels *are* really nice, but 9mm is a little skinny on the gears.  If you are heavy i'd recommend 12 or 15mm for a single setup.  9mm only on a dual setup.

I also like the legit Flywheels in the softer duros.  

I'm playing around with GF and CF now.  A ton of fun.  I'm still a noob, but getting better.  Started out w/ simple deck reinforcement (and aesthetics)...

@Spek - Yeah, it will come with an enclosure but we need to re-work our mold a bit to make sure it's a better fit. Not sure on how long that will take just yet. I might be able to get some of the old enclosures but it won't fit as great.

I'll have an option with a rectangle cut out that will fit all the components for previous packs.

Doing some planning. The red outline under the board is based on dimensions of the TB's 10s4p pack. Not sure if they're giving enclosure dimensions or not. There are some grooves on the underside of the board. I'll probably cut rubber material or neoprene or something and fill that gap and pad the seals of whatever enclosure I end up going with. Images showing up okay? 

I haven't roughed in the VESCs yet. First deck is the Never Summer Reaper and the second is the Never Summer Avalanche. Starting to rethink graphics after seeing how much space that battery eats up. Maybe an enclosure graphic not a deck graphic anymore haha. 

This drawing should be fairly accurately scaled but I am guessing on motor mount dimensions completely. Motots, wheels, deck trucks, battery should all be correctly scaled based on website specs. And you'll just have to imagine that the trucks are facing the right way haha

Is there a disadvantage to mounting dual motors behind the rear trucks like anew evolve? Could I drop through mount by doing that? It looks like the tb mount would allow that configuration. Dies it leave your motors too exposed to rocks and stuff?

more debris/rocks will get kicked at the motors behind the trucks.  More exposed for impacts and even leaning the deck upright might have the motors resting on the ground.

imgur - nope.  I have 200GB storage i pay for each year and google photos (picasa previously) should f'ing work!  Just need to figure out what i'm doing wrong, or process to get it working.  I'll figure it out, just a PITA.

Enclosure for 10s4p is 655x150x28 it will also fit 2x VESCs.

You can mount on the rear but if you do. You can't pop your deck up either. Benefits would be setup much lower to the ground. More space for a bigger battery pack on a smaller deck.

202mm total width which includes the flange. Total length is 661mm for enclosure. The enclosure holes are about 120mm each and 5mm from the sides.

The standard is 16/36 and you can use 255mm length belt.

This sounds like it'll be a great build, solid parts list.  I too make cut vinyl stickers/decals and this is what I've done with my build so far - I've used clear grip tape on top @longhairedboy :slight_smile:  The deck is a Lush Longboards Machine 3D, made in Bristol here in the UK.

This was an early photo I took just after installing the clear grip tape, most of the air bubbles have now gone and it's more settled, making the stickers clearer...

It's totally worth cutting some stickers and applying them, whether it's part manufacturer logos, your company name or something else that relates to the board etc.  Very best of luck with the build @Spek :thumbsup:

@longhairedboy Thanks man. So far its the only part of my build that I have in person. It is gorgeous. The composite material they put on the bottom feels space-age. Too bad I have to completely cover it with ABS. 

I mounted some old trucks with old rags to protect the board (incase its too complex to build on, I might have to exchange it) and it rides great. 

The deck has really aggressive concave near the wheels and those grooves are probably 1/8 deep. My plan is to use a heat gun to soften spots of the flange of the enclosure and attempt to form it to the weird contours of the deck. Anyone try anything like that? I found a video of a guy using a heat gun and manually shoving it onto an object.

My rough mock up sort of gives me an idea of where the enclosure will meet those contours. 

Whats a good material to place between enclosure and deck to form more of a water barrier? Neoprene sheet?

edit: No idea how exactly big a VESC is. Tried scaling a picture using the wires. TB said the enclosure would fit 2 of em though.

The reaper is a gorgeous deck, but you are definitely making it more difficult w/ those bottom contours!  The trick with ABS/Kydex is *just enough* heat to get it to form for you.  Too much and it'll get shiny and burn and can become brittle.

@mrjonnyjones - great looking deck and setup.  Deck shape reminds me of Omen Sugar - super functional kicktail.
[img]https://goo.gl/TwF3Cf[/img] 

VESC dimensions (PCB) are about 40mm x 60mm.  Add on the 35mm caps on the end and it's probably 40mm x 95-100mm.

The fit is great. No rattle, usb looks clean and sits solid, the trigger has full motion, ambidextrous, pocketable. It has a rough texture. My only complaint is how open the inside is around the trigger, but it shouldn't be a problem.

Starting to play with some graphics ideas for the top. Looks like enclosure will probably consume the bottom so I am still looking into bottom graphics and vehicle vinyl that works for abs. What do you guys think of my quick rough draft for the top? Only about 15 minutes into this so far but I am liking it.

Just a simple decal in the middle and the rest is grip tape design. Maybe some colored grip tape on the flares at the back.

Thanks @torqueboards. Can't wait for the mail to come tomorrow. Just waiting on ollin vesc after that *cough* mail it dude *cough*

Tomorrow's the day of truth if this deck will be too small/too complex or not.

Has anyone tried boiling water to make minor bends in ABS? I googled the molding temp for ABS and the article said 212.. the same temperature as boiling water. I think I really only need to worry about the corners and some weather stripping should be able to contour to the rest (i hope). @sl33py thoughts?

I don't think 212 will be hot enough.  It might be soft and slightly pliable, but not moldable would be my guess.  I'd ask @psychotiller - he's the expert!  I know Kydex is around 300 F...

quick google search looks like 235-250 might be "slump" stage so lower temp than kydex for sure.  I'd see what psychotiller says and otherwise give it a test.

My plan with the heat gun was to heat one section at a time, like a corner, until it starts to sag. Then position it on the board that's marked with tape or something for quick placement. Take a spatula or piece of wood or some found tool to mash the corner into the contour and hold until it cools. Maybe some thin cloth to protect the deck. Ive never done this, that's just how I'm trying to envision the process going. I want to avoid applying heat directly to the deck, I have no idea how the composite layer would react. Otherwise I'd heat while its in place. 

One way I'm looking at it is that my battery comes with an enclosure. So its basically free... so its okay to mess it up.. for science... I really like this deck haha. Not married to it though.

Any experienced advice from @psychotiller would be much appreciated!

I'm not completely done cleaning this up but I'm exploring somehow doing a full color top graphic.

I pulled the image from a recent poster design that was published by NASA for mars mission recruiting. http://mars.nasa.gov/multimedia/resources/mars-posters-explorers-wanted/

Anyway, I loved the image so I transformed it a bit to fit a deck. If anyone knows a solid method of doing a full graphic with very clear grip tape on it, Id love to hear it. I might be able to do the image under some fiberglass but the reaper deck is already fiberglassed on top and adding more doesn't seem like the best plan. I might look into printing on a perforated window film and clear grip tape on top of that. Perforated so that the grip's adhesive would adhere to some of the deck, not just adhered to a sticker.

its still the best griptape, using it on all my boards. I just choose my stance and my feet will be in the same spot, even after a whole battery!

No wheel bite with only a tiny shock pad. My drive train arrived so I threw a motor on and no motor bite either. The motors will be close to the enclosure but should be a near exact fit.

@Spek For ABEC11 Flywheels specifically, you only need 3 bolts. Technically, you only need 3 bolts in total. 6 bolts is overkill and only doable on the Clone Flywheels. So your pretty much good there.

How's it look on the front? Are you just saying it doesn't have enough room? Typically, most people don't use ABEC 11 if it's too short. I can probably spend you some longer ones.

I have the same wheel pulley with three screws on clones and never had a problem. Loc-tight the crap out of them.
Board I made for my wife with @torqueboards wheel pulley and 12s3p battery...freakin hate those wheels, but she wanted pink...

I've also done the heat gun trick on my abs enclosures a couple times...bent corners down to match concave. Works OK, I wouldn't try for any aggressive bends and as @psychotiller said watch the temp because it will bubble if you leave it in one spot too long. I want to say I had my temps around 320ish on the gun, but my gun is kinda crappy, so maybe less. I'd also recommend @psychotiller if you want a custom abs enclosure.

Thanks for the tip. I'll first consider a thick weather strip. If that's not enough to fill the gaps I'll try rubber washers and molding sugru into the gap. If that's not feasible I'll bend with heat. If I break it I'll go custom or look for something else. 

Also for anyone interested, sugru is a pretty cool moldable silicon glue that is heat over and cold resistant, flexible, molds like play dough and cures into silicon rubber. Also insulates electricity and dampens vibration. Its not cheap but I could see a ton of uses in eboards. I'll probably use it to secure and insulate my plugs into the Vesc and possibly mount the vescs and battery to the deck. And I might use it to make a perfect seal to my enclosure, reinforced with rubber washers or some kind of  spacers on the enclosure bolts. I plan to put wax or something deckside so it will only bond to the enclosure. We'll see.

I use the crap out of Sugru, stuff is great, hate the smell though. Don't really need Sugru to connect phase wires to VESC, assuming you have 5.5mm billet connectors. Heat shrink and/or hot glue will be enough and its a lot easier to remove if you need to replace the VESC or motor. A lot of guys (myself included) use Velcro to secure VESC to enclosure...holds really well and provides some vibration protection. 

I use this to seal the enlousure edges. Highly recommend. Great adhesive, choice of single or double strip, can screw through it without binding screw or coming unstuck.

Quick question. With a .75 inch max flex at the center of a deck (when gently hopping up and down), do you think I'd have problems using a single 26" long enclosure? The battery is 20" in length. 

I just finished jumping on a board between two chairs in front of a tape measure and cell phone taking video from a tripod in the living room... good thing my wife went to bed.

Made me laugh.  Totally what i'd do too.

I think 1" (.75 = close enough) of flex repeatedly is a good way to break a long battery like space cell or similar.  repeatedly flexing it will eventually break something.  Likely solder joints.  And a board in motion will flex more w/ loading than just jumping on it (thinking G's vs simple impact).

You can try reinforcing the deck to further minimize flex.  GF/CF.  Or a segmented battery meant to flex?

Can anyone recommend a board with a 30-32 inch wheelbase? Super rigid, preferably similar in riding style to the two decks mentioned above in the thread - NS reaper and rayne killswitch.

This reaper is plenty rigid but components are going to be tight. Taking measurements with the motors on isn't promising. I don't have my enclosure but @Torqueboards provided a detailed blueprint. If its too small it'll be by an inch. 

I actually have both decks. I exchanged the reaper at the local shop for killswitch which was 30 bucks more at $200. Then went home and found it online for $85. Bought it! Then took the first one back - he would only do in store credit so I took the reaper back home. Anyway. I can still exchange the reaper and annoy the local shop owner again.

:tired_face: . 

The day after I solve the last recurring issue and the day before I put the final cosmetic touches on. The last week of hot weather. I'm so freaking sad.

I must have hit some pavement jutting up. I didn't feel any major impact and it drove me all the way home from work. I suspect a certain spot in my route where there is a jagged seem in the road. It's not very big but I could see maybe hitting it just right so my wheel went wide of a bump but the motor did not.

@Torqueboards was extremely helpfull, going as far as to troubleshoot the damage externally which lead to opening up the motor. It was jamming up as if a rock were inside. Through the live chat he stayed on and helped when I got stuck with disassembly. He was very kind in helping me replace the motor with a discount, as well. So far I'm very happy the products and support. 

Quick build update. Board has been running great with a few fitting isses. All those were solved. It gets up to 27mph and I'm getting roughly 20 miles per charge with me at 220lbs. Exactly what I wanted it to be. I had some problems with my calibur 2 trucks being less than exactly sized and the issue was solved using strips of soup can in place of heat shrink. The mounts really feel solid that way, didn't even budge when smashed into :,(

Anyway, custom enclosure is coming tomorrow. Graphics printed and grip tape design cut out. And I'm down a motor. I'll probably just try single motor for a few days as an experiment in the meantime. I'll be posting pictures when everything is "done"

Completed Build Update:

Well everything major is "done"! Just took the maiden voyage of the board in its completed form with zero problems on this first ride. 

I went with a @psychotiller custom enclosure and I can't be happier. Overall great experience. He had me send some photos and measurements of my setup and had a custom enclosure done and shipped out in under a week! The fit is great and he delivered exactly what I asked for. Its a very nice, thick material and should provide good protection while looking great. I used a roam weather stripping that can flex from 1" thick to 1/8" thick so I was able to have a flat enclosure fit and seal into wheel wells and odd contours.

@torqueboards was great about replacing the motor that I broke. He provided great support and helped me diagnose the issue and had a new one (discounted) to my door 4 days later over the weekend (I am only half a state away, but he always ships orders out quickly). 

Performance with 215 lb rider weight (and fairly conservative amp limits):
Top real world speed: roughly 27mph
Range (aggressive throttle): 16-20 miles
Range (economic throttle): untested
Hill climbing: yes

Thanks! I'm super happy with the deck! Both the looks and how it rides. It's very stable at speed and carves like a champ! I'm going to go up to 90mm abec 11's and move the trucks to the shorter wheel base position to utilize those big wheel wells more. I think I can pull it off without adding more than 1/8" riser (I hate tall risers).

The bottom of the deck has some crazy contours so sealing the enclosure was a bit of a challenge. I'm playing with proto putty to create a more water resistant seal between deck and enclosure. 
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7fwytA5r2Mw&ved=0ahUKEwjm6r6UtovQAhVCRiYKHXqxBIoQwqsBCCIwAg&usg=AFQjCNFWdxNfJFsgTyrrr621EQ0SdrkQ-g

I had originally used a foam weather stripping that was thick enough to close the larger gaps but compressed for the thin spots. It just wasn't giving me a ton of confidence over surprise wet patches on my commute.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/e/4e029ff057df03a5d02333b9b892af501ea9f5fe.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Here's the first attempt with silicone putty.

I'm going to redo this one more time and make it cleaner. It was a bit of a challenge to do as the stuff dries really quickly. I basically put an oversized snake of it down and squashed it to the desired thickness using the enclosure. Bolt down the enclosure and razor off the excess when dry. Unfortunately, the color is what I got using black food coloring so if anyone could recommend something to dye it truely black I'd appreciate the help. It's not adheisive like sugru so the result is a giant rubber gasket that can be removed.

Found this stuff, bro! Might work for you. 
Do you know if the foam that you are using is open or closed cell? Closed cell is going to have the water resistant properties that you are looking for without a coating. A lot of the automotive insulating foam strip is closed cell and should do a great job of keeping water out. It will come down to whether or not the "seal" between where the box and foam meet and where the board and foam meet. Under compression it seems like that would be pretty tight. You could always take some of the foam and throw together a test piece with a scrap or two of wood and see what happens when you hit it with water.  Does it go under the seal? Does it go through the foam? That ought to boost your confidence in the material you already have. IMO :v:

Hey man, I really appreciate the help, thanks! That material looks interesting. Would I spray that right on the foam weather stripping?

I plan on making one more attempt at the silicone putty and trying to get a perfectly clean looking seal. I made a number of mistakes and the drying time made me a bit frantic and messy the first time around. On top of that, I made about half as much as I needed. Did half with a second batch which caused some unevenness. Also, I still have just enough of that foam to revert back to my original solution if it doesn't work out.

I am using [this stuff](http://www.bestmaterials.com/detail.aspx?ID=20221) and I am pretty confident in its water resistance where it is compressed. The biggest gaps under my enclosure are the front corners, right behind the wheels where water sprays the most and the foam isn't tightly compressed. I did run some water over a scrap of the foam and it resisted for a moment but then the water did soak in and held like a sponge - so it is open cell foam.

It's a great deck. I'm getting about 27 mph top speed. It's very stable to the point where I would prefer to have an additional 5 mph. I might try 90 or 97mm wheels in the future for more top speed, but I really don't want to add risers. Right now, with 83mm wheels, I have only 1/8" shock pads. In my experience, risers reduce stability at speed and can really make the ride feel worse. I highly recommend it for eskate, except for the added complexity of mounting to the contoured underside.

I have access to a large format printer. The graphics are printed onto vinyl and I installed the print myself. Basically a giant sticker. 

I would recommend contacting your local sign shop. Tell them what you're making and provide the artwork (they'll tell you if the resolution is too low). They should be able to give you a quote and recommend specific vinyls. If you want it to last, I would ask them to use the same stuff they wrap cars with. 

One thing to note is that vinyl graphics wont hold well on ABS plastic. If you're putting it into a plastic enclosure, it might not stay for long. So far mine is holding up just fine and I put the grip tape right on top of the print.

The image itself is a NASA poster for recruiting Mars explorers which I thought was awesome. I had to do some photoshop work to extend the background and removed some text that wouldn't fit nicely.

Hope that helps!

Where do you source the vinyl? I have access to a large format printer, but am having a hard time sourcing a printable vinyl that isnt regular 8.5x11" sheets. I was thinking of priming the ABS beforehand to have a better surface to stick to.

I will look into local shops, I just don't want it to cost an arm and a leg. Last time I tried to get a custom wrap made for a skydiving helmet a local shop was quoting in the thousands

Well in my case the whole thing was free. I did get a quote from a local sign shop for laminated cast vinyl and it was around $60. You cant really wrap an object like a helmet in vinyl... too round. I'm guessing it was a different process. An entire vehicle costs thousands including install.

That came out amazing! Well done. That's some of the coolest art I've ever seen on top of a skateboard (electric or otherwise)

Hey man! 

The 97mm were good but had to use a couple os thin angled risers and there was no wheel bite at all, even forcing it

Is it for an electric or analog? Im curious to see some pics. I can't find authentic abec11's anywhere except one vendor has some overpriced 97mm's. Thanks

They purchased all the Abec 11 and left the market out of stock, now they can sell at whatever price they want

Yea that is the one place I can find an authentic flywheel of any size and they only have 97mm. Has Abec11 stopped making them?? 

I really want some 90mm 75a abec 11's but I pulled the trigger today on the evolve 83mm black wheels with the clone hubs. It looks like they put some effort into the urethane formula so I'm giving them a shot. I don't trust the clone flywheels because the quality of the urethane really matters for good traction, smooth ride, wheel longevity, etc.

Evolve people wanted more speed, so they started looking for bigger wheels. Evolve noticed it and bought a ton. In the evolve facebook group everybody is trying bigger wheels now

Hey, can you post some photos of your work with NS reapers in here? I was digging through your history and saw a few photos of a reaper build and some enclosure work. Do you have a thread to check that out in one place? Was my board the inspiration for that? Specifically, I'd love to see a few pictures of those wheels with the risers on the reaper.

I have always hated how risers make the turning and stability feel. I went with the 83mm to maintain the low-to-the-ground downhill properties of the reaper's ride. I am still super curious to buy a set of 97's for the top speed+

Hey @Spek of course your your build was an inspiration, I loved the Reaper since I saw it.

This is the thread for the enclosure:

If you move the rear trucks to the front position, the tail can be used to kick the board up
