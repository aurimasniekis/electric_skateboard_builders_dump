I Use Dual BLDC Motor Sine Wave FOC ESC Electronic Speed Controller 10S 36V for DIY Electric Skateboard
[http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-bldc-motor-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-for-diyeboard-p-522.html?zenid=ce05922ca0cc30e4b4222a754bae12d5](http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-bldc-motor-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-for-diyeboard-p-522.html?zenid=ce05922ca0cc30e4b4222a754bae12d5)
It works fantastic for building your own DIY Electric Skateboard. The Dual BLDC Motor Sine Wave FOC ESC allows you to use BLDC Unsensored or Sensorless HUB Motors / Belt-Drive Motors to achieve smooth start-up from a stop versus traditional ESC’s which have trouble starting from a complete stop. Sine Wave (FOC) Field Oriented Control allows your electric skateboard to run with barely any motor noise.

love the square profile of the tires, all the cnc work looks awesome. I just can't help but feel the tires are too low a profile for any real offroad work.
But once again, looks awesome, have you got any video of someone shreding on your gear? would love to see it in action!

I think there is a need, a opening for electric skateboard specific tires in a 8 inch size at the moment that will fit on peoples existing superstar or mbs hubs but have a more square profile. Something with the same profile, depth of rubber but with a wider contact patch and can take high pressure at least 75 psi or even say 100 psi.
At the moment the tires all have a round profile, like a bicycle tire, something with a more square profile like a car tire. Your initial pictures have this square profile tire but they are very skinny, the rubber is very this, so this will be very bumpy, good for smooth roads but not AT.
Do you get what I mean bro?

so far no better solution for tires, because of limited resources of square sources. that's the reason we keep those new items not open for sell yet, do you have any recommendations of square tires?
or do anyone have any recomends?
we have a square tire here but have size problem.

What size is the pictured tire, it look's small for a car but huge for a emtb. The problem with going that big will be weight and rolling resistance. How much do they weigh?

At this point, it is more useful as a camera dolly than a useful board to carry in hand. I probably bet it weights 30 lbs. Nice work, though.

we already customized many prototypes for extream riders, weight kept at 20-25lbs, and we are keeping to improve the suspension and losing the weight, also cutting down the cost so people can afford to buy one. thank you.
