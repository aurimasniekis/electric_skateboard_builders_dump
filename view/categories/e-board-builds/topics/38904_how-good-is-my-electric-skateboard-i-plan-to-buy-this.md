Hello, I want to buy my first electric skateboard and don't have that big of a budget. I have made a list of parts I want to buy for my skateboard. Can you please give my some tips for parts I need to replace or something? (I am the most insecure about the batteries) TY :)

That psu will get your batteries to only 4v per cell

Oh so I will need a 25,2v one you mean

Yeah like this.  It will get your batterty to 6x4.2v. 
Actually it won't get right up to 4.2. But I have a similar one and 4.17v is good enough

And about the batteries.  Go 45c better than 20c if you can

Ah I saw that one too, but is the amperage not to low? I saw a vid about modding a psu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxHQjlHv1y4&t=1s

You could go that way too.
The power brick I shared should be good enough to charge a 6s5000mAh battery in about 3 to 4 hours.  I wouldn't charge my battery daily at a much higher rate though

Oh okay thank you! I was planning to do that, charging them daily with higher rate like 5A, but I didn't know that is unsafe. I think Im going your route!!

Not exactly unsafe.  
It is safe  to charge a Lipo at 1C (5A for a 5amp battery)
But they will live longer if they are charged slower. Also gives more time for the bms to balance

Don't buy any batteries from a brand like ZOP. I bought one exactly like that and it puffed within 3 months of light use. I have heard very good things about the Zippy batteries.

i'd say buy a vesc from @torqueboards for $ 100 instead of the esc / program card .  At 6s with conservative values you should be fine and the Vesc is everything you want from an esk8 Esc.  Also you need a controller of some sort like the GT2B ($30) or something.

He said he is on a budget and he is in Europe so he will get an extra $40 shipping charge. That esc looks ok although a Fvt 120a one from banggood might be better since it has been used a lot more. Or a Xcar beast esc from Hobbyking. That's what I run and it's rock solid. What wheels will you be using?

I will use the trucks and wheels from a longboard I got a year ago, the diameter of the wheels is 6.5cm and they are solid, so I need to drill holes in it. Thank you for the ESC recommendations, I think I will still use the other ESC but if it breaks I know which ESC I will buy next.

65mm is pretty small wheels, so you will Get very little ground clearance. I would recommend you too just buy some 90/97 mm flywheel clones for like 30$. They will fit good with the pulley set you linked to

It's hard to get cheap clones outside US. I'm in Aus and for shipping its $50 plus $20 for the wheels that's $70 so I might as well get real wheels

€250, it's my first build and I want it to be a budget build. I also want to use another motor: https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-5065-BRH5065-200KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-With-Gear-For-Balancing-Scooter-p-1117658.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc_ods&utm_content=sophia&utm_campaign=Seachine-ds-pc-racerstar&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI57-f7MjP1wIVCWYbCh1MgQA9EAAYASAAEgIJkvD_BwE&cur_warehouse=CN
It has more torque and is less expensive

It won't actually give you much more torque because it is a smaller motor. You will also lose a lot of speed because it is a much lower kV motor

I really don't know. I use this one to program it:
https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-LED-Program-Card-For-25354560A-ESC-Motor-Set-p-1057127.html?cur_warehouse=CN
It's a little bit cheaper too

Okay.
How is this setup working for you?
Can you program the esc to be smooth on brakes and acceleration?
Does it make loud noise when braking?

I don't have that information yet, still have to put some things together. From static tests I can conclude that if you brake too hard, the motor makes loud noise. but the brake is so hard that you would fly off the board i think
