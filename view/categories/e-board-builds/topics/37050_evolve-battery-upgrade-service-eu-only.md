Hi guys,
After doing a few Evolve battery mods I've decided to offer my services to a wider audience...

I'm **only** going to cover EU though, so as not to step on @longhairedboy 's toes :thumbsup: besides, I don't offer a deck modifying service, just advice on how to do it and of course, supply of the actually replacement battery itself.

More information can be found in my blog post.

I'm sorry, I didn't know you were doing this too :confused: 

I don't have the BMS, but I do have the specific 11pin connector so people can use their existing BMS', they just pug it straight in.

How would any bms work? If i'm correct, the speed controller still needs input from the uart cable coming out of the existing stock bms. Unless you were able to trick the ESC somehow.

you cannot use any BMS. You must use Evolve BMS as there are UART and SW ports.

We definitely need to source this BMS. Drop in replacement packs for CGTs that just plug in? Are you kidding me i mean that needs to happen. The BGT/BGTX mod requires deck machining but the CGT doesn't need shit.  

And no competition here people i think its going to take all of us to effectively eviscerate Evolve on a global scale lmfao

I have one bamboo mod customer with a board that will blow your mind. I'll post pics later.

I'm pretty sure people are aware they'll lose their warranty! Lol. Most of the boards will be outside of warranty too which is why they need a replacement battery!

Because either their battery's have degraded by now, or they're feed up with terrible voltage sag, causing them to fall back in to eco mode towards the end of a charge...

My packs eradicate voltage sag until much later in the charge life and enable the rider to ride for much farther distances....

Nearly 30 miles approx.

Hey man, thanks for the info. 

Im not gonna lie, I have a GTx, owned it 2-3 months, only just grown the balls to ride it in Fast, as of yet I've not touched GT üòÇ.

Furthest ive ever ridden is is 12miles so I've never had to drop into Eco.

Should I worry about my battery?

The problem is the mega cheap batteries Evolve use in their boards...

Just a heads-up guys, if you order your #evolveBatteryUpgrade now, as I'm so swamped with orders and my wife is insisting I join in with the holiday festivities ( :( ), I won't have time to get it done before the new year so it'll be ready second week in January 2018 :thumbsup:

Is that an arduino module you are using to trick the evolve bms or is that just an older version of evolves stuff?

Kevin is super nice, he always responds quickly to your questions and he provided detailed instructions about how to connect the battery to the BMS, even he marketed the cables to know which one is which. He also sent the package very quickly and very well packed. About the battery itself, great work, he knows what is doing. The pack is unbelievable, seriously, I‚Äôm astonished. You can go uphill in full speed, don‚Äôt worry, the sag is almost non existent and the power is constant. The range is crazy too. The only thing that I‚Äôm a little bit sad is that I‚Äôve been riding the stock crappy battery for almost a year, I wish I would get this in day one. I‚Äôm so happy right now, I can go whatever I want without worrying about the range. I recommend to every one who has an Evolve to contact to Kevin an order a new one. Kevin is the man! Thank you very much!
