I think I wouldn't mind a board with a kick tail . . . . powered!

You'd need to push the trucks out to give yourself some breathing room for batteries and electronics...it's not impossible

Â£1519 !!!! You gotta be kiddin'? (How on earth can they charge that much for that?)

I mean, I might spring for hub motors but please? I could power it for Â£200! lol

I actually don't think you could power it for Â£200. VESC is Â£100, hub motor Â£150, batteries Â£50 (minimum), and controller Â£20. And that's not including misc. materials which add up quick

For this build, which would most likely be for my son, I wouldn't go VESC, I'd go for this setup

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/43-dollar-speed-conotroller-and-remote-ill-let-you-know-how-it-works-out-quick-review-now-posted/24914 Â£32.87

2 x 3s 5000mah Lipo (Hobbyking) Â£25.17 x 2

Turnigy SK3 either 6374 or 5065 (ditch the hub idea) Â£47

Mini Remote Â£18 (I already have this)

Enclosure Â£5

you need to kill the torque at start up to make it safer...needs to be a slow ramp...jerky throttle response will just get someone hurt ... don't want that to happen at all...maybe get it a little under control using @Ackmaniac program... maybe that is a way to manage the power

Well if you go with 6s someone's gonna fall for sure but using a lower voltage will help kill the start up torque that messes people up...I've tried 4s on a car esc on an esk8 ...I'd say it was good for kids...smooth throttle good braking ...worked really well at that voltage

Yeah could do 4s, that'd work.

He's 11. He features at the end of this build video: https://youtu.be/MVQUQ_srAIg?t=1883

He has his own non-powered deck with 70mm soft longboard wheels...

He also features in this video, he's basically got the hang of it by now: https://youtu.be/DQj69QsqdZA?t=32

Slightly lower KV than the SK3 5065 and a little cheaper, but I don't think that ESC takes sensored motors, although I guess I don't have to use the sensors...

a group of us users are communicating with them and improving the brakes...we are at version 4 now and the brakes are usable. However one person had their range drop from 10km to 2km...lot of weird things to work out....Mellow's price is also for extensive R&D. Landwheel seems to test their units in a smooth concrete factory floor.

As for the skateboard, why not just ride it. I miss analog boards, skated for years in my teens and early twenties best time ever with zero responsibilities

Definitely vote you give him a bit of the power - he'll get it sorted quickly it seems.

Also suggest you move the trucks out onto the kicks - increased wheel base not only for electronics but for longer wheelbase/stability.  It will wedge the angle though and be much more "turney" unless you de-wedge w/ angled risers.  

I'd give it to him as is and see how he does before you electrify - even moving trucks out before adding motors would be smart, then add power after he gets the hang of pushing it?

He does already have this deck which is essentially the same but with 70mm wheels... but putting the trucks on the kicks, even with angled risers would make for a much different ride, it might be worth doing that and letting him get used to riding that before electrifying it, you may be right there...

Yeah, if you add 83mm wheels you'll be raising the deck quite a bit too - it'll be considerably different feel, so probably best to play with it before adding power.

You could try standing on it with one leg and then pushing on the floor with the other. As you'll see, it will create momentum and you will actually start moving. After that you could try some basic riding and perhaps even tricks, I've heard people do that as well on their skateboards :grin:

I had contemplated setting it up like this, but I just tried it, non-powered and the wheel bite is a killer! I could grind out some arches for it but then it's very ~spritely~ like this with big wheels and short wheel base, so I've decided to move them to the kick tails. I have angled risers for it...

I had a metroboard shortboard that I ended up modifying to the point that it went ~27 mph on a standard wheelbase. I guess if you're used to longboards it might feel weird, but I've been bombing hills on a shortboard with 54mm wheels my whole life and have no issue with going 30+ on a setup like that. To each their own I guess...

Maybe you should have a look at the Xcar beast esc. It is great for anything lower than 6s. I have mine and the power and brakes are adjustable so they become quite smooth. You can also put a timing limit so that it won't deliver full power, they aren't too expensive either. Good luck with this build

They are long countersunk screws for the ligo batteries.


http://www.ebikes.ca/media/wysiwyg/LiGo/LiGoHeader2.jpg

The ligo batteries are made so they stack together like lego.

So to mount them I just flattened the bottom of the board with a belt sander, drilled holes and stacked them two high.

So to combat my killer wheel bite, I ground some wheel wells into the underside of the deck...

But it's still not enough! :frowning:

I really don't want to put mega high risers on this thing, it's already quite high off the ground... I think I'm going to cut the ends of the board to the shape of the vanguard/boosted noses...

Dont cut your deck like the one on the picture. I have done that to an old deck, it looks cool but hou can't ride it. Your feet touch the wheels when standing on it. Even when you bring the trucks out more. But maybe your suspension thing wil work.

I was only thinking of taking away **just** enough deck to stop the wheel bite and only Ch it the end similar to the vanguard... I'll check it again but I don't think my feet will touch the wheels.....

My advise with the suspension thing is the put a spring in the large open part and maybe have a hinge at the other end. Because eventually the metal will break due to it bending backwards and forwards

Little bit more has happened on this build. Been a while, been really busy! :confused:

Motor mount is HobbyKing mount, custom fit to a Pairs style cheap truck... 5065 racestar sensored motor, 6s lipos, VESC, sandwich/lunch box enclosure, screwed to the deck from underneath.

How is the racestar motor holding up? And what range are you getting on your setup?

The Racestar is actually really good! It's running FOC very well and has enough power, especially for my son anyway but even when I've used the board too...

I ran into a bump on the road.. I have everything ready to go but I noticed the sensor 5 pin plug on the racestar does not fit the FOCBOX 6 pin, was this the same for your VESC?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/5/6525010b0ab517e6aca664ad7904ccea49ef6590.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7d4177c59a83ac774d83831fc3c965b238e92525.jpg" width="375" height="500">

I think the extra pin is for the temp input on the Vesc. I'm not 100% sure but to me it looks like the t symbol is for the temp sensor which your motor doesn't have. So if you can split he red and blue wires and then plug it into the corresponding spots (black to gnd and so on the red to 5V) it should work. Some one just verify this first as I don't want to be responsible for braking anything

You need a new 6 pin JST connector, but just miss out one of the pins, (which is temperature), can't remember which one, I'll take a photo of my connector in a bit...

I bought a bunch of these for cheap and clipped the pins out of the one on the motor and this new one, then clipped them in the new 6 pin one in the right order...

no i think they are **Micro JST 2.0 PH 6-Pin** or that is at lest what fit on my vesc but i have a 4.12 but looks to be the same. 
Did the mistake of assuming it was regular Jst-xh already and they are to big  :disappointed:

btw what is the wheel size your using, seems hugh xD ? and your using a hobbyking Motor Mount? does it fit a 5065 well?

Hi, they're 97mm flywheel clones.

Only two of the motor holes line up with the Racestar 5065 motor, other 50mm motors have a different hole pattern though. I think it's made for 63mm motors.

@darkkevind would that race star motor work for a small mono drive for an adult sized human? Or should i go a bit bigger?

What's the riders weight? I've used this motor for a single motor drive. It works, but it's not very efficient, mine gets very hot. I would only use for bagel runs. 

If I were building a board for a lightweight pre-teen, this is a great motor.

 Thanks. 
Was planning on putting it on my build. I'm 185 lbs so I'm going to go anther route. It's a shorter range build, but hate to run the motor ragged. No need for undue stress, just liked the shape. Plan on mounting to indy 215's (tkp) which tend to sit lower to the ground and didn't want to reverse mount and impede the sweet kicktail. 
I'll just use a 6355 i have lying around.

Another budget motor option is the Keda 190kv. I've also used this on a single drive and it's much more efficient than the racerstar. Also its mounting holes are compatible with most mounts.
