I did not hit her, I did noooot. 
Oh hi Mark !

This is the build I dreamed for since I started esk8. And after many struggles/ problems it is now a reality. I have a few things left to do to perfect it as much as I can. I'm no LHB or OKP but I definitely wan't to achieve something sleeker and more refined. We'll come back on that later. 

First a few beauty snaps :

![IMG_1580 2|666x500](upload://4Y2wdgczCjrjAWPHNOZz6P1PV08.jpg)![IMG_1577 2|666x500](upload://2IEpeVBrSMPO9s7qVrT8WHzvxLc.jpg)![IMG_1583 2|666x500](upload://7NwFbHmEQ5a6hiyzKKZO2vUpfuZ.jpg)![IMG_1578 2|666x500](upload://e3GuyyWkpkY9WNYaK56ZNrVZQ6q.jpg)![IMG_1581 2|666x500](upload://2p4MF7JIWeUjv9bMineTncFCz2R.JPG)![IMG_1584 2|666x500](upload://sNSh3antWQ08xWw9v0we7gnNX4d.jpg)![IMG_1587 2|666x500](upload://mFqvGBjUNvdW4zu7WiYEYrixYjS.jpg)![IMG_1589 2|666x500](upload://oKjbjHjbuMpfppQShnESlIsnu0D.jpg)![IMG_1598 2|666x500](upload://fSTsaS4keA28vsVrSHIxh707dnq.jpg)![IMG_1596 2|666x500](upload://oTwSWWDuuqoiUXvE5fs5dnAIrrw.jpg)

So now let's talk a bit of the build itself. 
The first thing I had to do was wait (like always in this hobby) the carvon was delivered few month late but that's Okay 
when I recieved them I had no spare focbox or whatever so I replaced the drive of my Belt drive build with 10S3P so I could ride em and see how they perform : 
![IMG_0987|375x500](upload://a90r2F8lS2xQv4TQZa6HbKxBAKb.JPG)

They perform amazing. Great torque and the speed is insane. In foc it's just dead silence you can't even hear the motors with full throttle. However with 25R and 3P configuration the sag was awfull from 70% of battery. I used this set Up for 2 month the time I gather some monies for all the expensive parts I had to buy. 

So after a few purchase and some sweat I was at this point : 

 

![IMG_1354|375x500](upload://oLntk8ONWb8Ved7Fnwg9C3yvLlU.JPG)

 12S5P, FOCBOX, Photon Remote it's all there !!!! At this point I'm overwhelmed and just can't wait to finish the build and ride forever. 
DYED some wheels : 
![IMG_0779|375x500](upload://lPgu7ts6qvSaBEMcRkhgHxH7wD6.JPG) 

But I won't for at least a few months 
First it was the remote the problem, it would not bind and to this date ( almost 3 month later )
 still wont. I have yet to recieve replacement parts to make it work.
![IMG_7266|374x500](upload://ucaAbAcLT5dGGU2GYuTqjYHvTdM.JPG)

![IMG_1413|375x500](upload://oSSd7igfXSsiZFRWOod8MkL8PgY.JPG)

But it's not real problems there, I quickly hooked it up with a GT2B Mastercho mod and went riding in Paris : 
![IMG_1290|375x500](upload://eSftmgjovqR1o4uklHbCOKczBZQ.jpg)

later that night I went riding with Nono along the seine and tadaaaaaaaaam he tells me my board is smoking. I stop and smells some horrible smoke : 
Found out many mosfets of the BMS burnt : 

![IMG_1293|375x500](upload://e1yDwzwxNwiob46pmo8OorFdbmj.JPG)![IMG_1297|375x500](upload://iNw73bYSUyaXZSJEZfhuY5h5cUE.JPG)![IMG_1296|374x500](upload://yzglvfDTXfLl7XNnRSFaXBFLd6L.JPG)

So I replaced with the same model but brand new : 
![IMG_1353|375x500](upload://bRRkpbBJMgLFkWr8JARXjkuQiaj.JPG) 

This time the problem was different the discharge would work fine but I couldn't brake with the motors because I had an Undervoltage problem. 
so neeeeeeext step : 
![ad161eb5-57ea-4789-86a7-44c54e90f42e|377x500](upload://up7Yz1DOWCVcN2H1zUkFpNtoIRS.JPG)

Replaced with the Bestech 80A BMS and now it works flawlessly. 
![IMG_1350|666x500](upload://d5FPaAF6hO7vkBmlRgXNrP1gsFi.jpg)



**What's next ?**

Now I'm more than happy with the performance of the board. it's just great. Has more than 50 - 60 km range. The downhill deck is just all I love about longboarding. I just feel again on my old longboard. No noise, no rolling resistance. when i don't use the throttle I can't distinguish the two. it's crazy cool. 

**BUT**

I have a few plans left : 
Few little things that will make this build perfect to my eyes : 
Braided Cable Sleeving 
![_SY355_|355x355](upload://uOc8gBEdObNoAQoTMBIsggjgIO4.jpg)
I really want to integrate @Kug3lis Dual FocBOx BOX to the enclosure 
Right now i think i will basically cut the enclosure to the size and only stick out the Fins of the box and seal it around with silicone. That's my best option for now. I really wan't to integrate it. 
![3F06A6DA-15B2-4171-99E6-2A434242215F|375x500](upload://uBBJ2rt6hus7ndEnJVgoiFkBkJN.jpeg)![IMG_1516|375x500](upload://xPkTAmVFXqMVEiKzbC6UWIYVlZO.JPG)

if you have any question/ suggestion please do ! 
It was My first build thread after a very long time on the forum sorry for that

Update of the build :slight_smile:

While integrating the heatsink I did a silly mistake and created a weak point on my brand new enclosure see for yourself

Just clamps the enclosure back in shape then brush in 2 part epoxy on the inside and outside. The sand and paint if you want too. You could also use sugru but I think epoxy is stronger.

Amazing! It's sick! That enclosure is a masterpiece. THe noise from the belt motor is significant, there are 2 guys here in the city with a belt drive an you can hear them from far away :laughing:
I am also lazy to open the enclosure, I just did it yesterday evening to try it out the firefly remote adn never again! That's why just for the VESC setting I use a cheap bluetooth module either through the app directly or via TCP you can connect via WIFI and use the VESC tool as usual! Now with the new remote I will have to adjust the throttle/brake curve multiple times, no way I will open the enclosure all the time...lazy AF!

I still have to test on street. For the moment just tried ti out around the apartment. Really is not that difficult, I found the software upload the most annoying part due to the lack of information adn the difference version out there. But lucky for you I just did so if you need help no problem. I actually bought everything for 3 remotes, just in case I would have done some mistakes I didn't want to wait weeks for the pieces to come. So I will probably build few more. I used different antenna since with one suggested a lot of people had problem. Let's see...
Overall believe that it is not difficult, took me one night (5-6 hours). Now it would be faster I guess.![IMG_20180714_123757|690x388](upload://c2wqluU8fbJ49D06Ig3kwePkKWz.jpg)

I used a modify throttle curve so actually my hubs are not that strong at the beginning. Several times when I wanted to accelerate hard without think to much I was almost thrown off the board. So now they are still strong but smoother. The only things that I got too use is the top speed...I will probably need to put a 12s under it :laughing:

So you made that kydex enclosure yourself or did you have it built by someone else? How well does it compare to the fiberglass enclosures? Looking for a good enclosure for my build as well. Is it splash resistant? Concerned about the heat sinks taking a splash or hit from debris as well if i tried that on my build. Are you using a power switch or loop key?

All enclosure from ABS/fiberglass etc are water-resistant it's just a question of how you manage to place your gasket etc...
If the esc is tight there shouldn't be any issue with little debris I think 
I am using an antispark

@Pedrodemio He will reply, but he posted the second board because I asked for it. The first one and the main of this thread it was at the begging of the thread a dual belt but then he moved to V3. Now he upgraded to Carvon V4.
The second is a spud deck, with dual belt 6355 I believe. Focboxs and an eBoosted enclosure. Before he was using a Chinese hub motors and we were complaining about the riding quality due to bad routes (I also use them). I wanted to clarify since the confusion was due to one of my question :grin:

Except the damn heat :frowning:
400 meters of moderate hill and I'm in thermal throttling...
I can't really ride aggressively if I wan't to keep my temperature decent and get a decent acceleration. I will change the temperature limit to 110Â° like the raptor 2 so I have more headroom.

This is motor temperature right? Do you know what grade are the magnets? If the beta factor is wrong on the vesc it can read the temperature way higher than it really is, but if the magnets aren't high temp rated 110 you will already start demagnetize them

Yes motor temperature. I dont' really know maybe it's written on the Carvon V4 thread, I can only guess that yes since they heat up so easily they must have put high temp rated magnets inside.
I don't wan't to be at 110 degrees constant, I just wan't to have a bit of headroom when I take hills because very quickly I loose all my acceleration due to heat. 
What do you mean beta factor? I have tried the carvon on FOCBOX and ESCape and I have similar results

Damn your v4 sdr get hot from simple riding too?
Mine got over 80 easily just by braking twice from going fast or even from going slow and accelerating and braking a lot. This canâ€™t be right.  

I thought maybe I had wrong vesc settings and should start over but you are now the second person I know that has overheated sdrâ€™s. 
@chris.hunt 

There is just no way this is normal since that makes these motors unusable, essentially useless unless you donâ€™t mind going slow and donâ€™t brake with your speed drives.

Yup I m learning how to use the drive and manage the heat but I had never such problems with the V3 I had to shred the fuck out of them to make them throttling now it's just a matter of a little Hill and you are a turtle 
I think you would reach max temp only for going max speed ONCE

I have ordered a set of torque drives. They are on their way and should be here either today or next Monday I guess. 

They have 9 pin connectors so I will need to cut and solder them first. Why they did not change this themselves is because of time I suppose to ship them sooner. 
Not sure if they have a temp sensor though but probably they do otherwise I still canâ€™t check the heat from the metr pro. 

Note that I emailed carvon about overheating first and had no reply. Then I ordered the torque drives and asked them to respond to my overheating issue and had an email back from Jerry not much later. I responded to that email on the same day and I am still waiting for an answer back now. 
This is only the second day that I havenâ€™t heard back from him yet so take that how you want to.

Eager to know what you think and how they compare to your SDR experience! Looking to buy a TD off someone just waiting for someone to offer it up for sale haha

Is it true that they will only be selling completes and no longer just the drives separately?

Yeah I snagged the last one ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤ª. I am broke now. In more ways than one. 

They will sell completes after this and parts only. You wonâ€™t be able to buy a set of drives as they sell them now.

damn! only way to get the drives now is to take it from a complete? :frowning: I knew I should've taken that last one well there goes my build plan. someone please sell me one *not too desperate yet* lol 

As for the parts, can they be used on existing V4 TDs,SDRs,SDXLs?

or maybe a one last hurrah group buy for drives before they go flat out completes? :laughing:

I just feel again on my old longboard. No noise, no rolling resistance. when i donâ€™t use the throttle I canâ€™t distinguish the two. itâ€™s crazy cool.

very familiar feelings :relieved:

Have you taken off the thane yet with good results?

Iâ€™m actually waiting on escapes so I can leave my current torque drive build as is.

@sayekim I'm in Denmark visiting my family right now so I couldn't do anymore work on the build.
I'll be in Paris just 1 day before heading to Morocco so won't have time to do anything. I'll be back the 26th, it's the first thing i'll do when I get back for sure ! I really hope removing that urethane will solve the problem. If it does not I will just run sensorless because it's killing everything right now.

It said on the site it was the last one. Someone must have cancelled their exo order for you to get yours.

Unfortunately I won't be there. What a bummer. I'm not in Paris like 3 weeks per year and the event had to be during these 3 weeks.....

hehe shame man. I caught them by sheer chance this past weekend in Barcelona. Was riding and saw Moja and thought he looked familiar. He was super nice and came up to say hi.

The raptor 2 is a whole different experience to anything else i tried before.

I picked them up at the post office on the 26th and paid 43 euro of which I believe included 13 euro handling charges.
Iâ€™m sure it would have been more but luckily the invoice value was written as 145 $. 
Iâ€™ll see if I can still find it to double check. 
Even so with these numbers I should still have paid less since customs charges 21% tax.

Oh nice. I hope he put mine down as 145 too and not 500.

Letâ€™s wait and see
