Hi everyone,

I've got an eskating aluminium/carbon motor mount with a 20t motor pulley. Looking to out some AT wheels on. My friend has an evolve with AT wheels and the pulley doesn't slot on fully because it touches the 20t motor pulley. Just wondering what pulleys are available which are the same width as the evolve ones but slightly smaller teeth count. It needs to be the same width because my current pulley is an evolve orangatang. I had to modify my trucks to fit it.

Just looking for some advice.

Thanks,
Daniel
