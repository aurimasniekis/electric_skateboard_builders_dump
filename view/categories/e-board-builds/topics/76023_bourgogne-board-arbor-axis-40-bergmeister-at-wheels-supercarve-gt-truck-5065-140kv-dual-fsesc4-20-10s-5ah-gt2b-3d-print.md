Hey e-Rider,

So, I got some stuff laying around from my move to my natal city :hugs: ,
in _Burgundy_ (Bourgogne for the amateur, yes Chablis, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Beaujolais etc.) :yum:

Then, they are some parts that I want to reuse with some new one!
Here I just want a cool little all road cruiser :relaxed: I will remake an e-MTB to go shredding the vineyard, so this build should be more compact, but as fun and maybe even lightweight and somehow easy to use without binding and top-deck enclosure.

---

   - **The Deck :**

_I come out my old deck to put it forward again! The [**SWE**](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/swe-custom-33-integrated-enclosure-ronin-cast-modified-hub-motor-80kv-800w-90mm-10s5ah-x2-vescs/13412) :
Custom deck 7 wood plies + 2 CF + around 10 FG and CF layers for the integrated enclosure._

_Edit :_ 

Arbor Axis koa 40"
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/snapshot_28c.jpg

 - **The wheels :**

Brand new **Bergmeister** All-terrain pneumatic (precision CNC milled three-spoke hubs in mat grey/black finish ... beautiful :heart_eyes: ) by Haggyboard.
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_20112_1443.jpg
The tires is 145mm diameter (and 46/47mm widest), and the rims come with a 22mm bearing seat that can fit all standard longboard/skateboard trucks with 8mm or 10mm axles!
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/pic_01012l.jpg

 - **The trucks :**

Supercarve … Because I would profit to test my mount (would love the **Kahua trucks**,.. but also got the TB218 still laying somewhere around that should be a lot better).
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/pic_01119l.jpg

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/pic_01391l.jpg

 - **The motor mounts :**

**Custom** for Evolve Supercarve GT trucks, made from 5mm AL7075, for the front.
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC0102-3.jpg
Reversible in every directly (rotation and mirror), 50 and 63mm motors (made for the MAD SURFER AWD setup), and with a dual idler or reinforcement bars.
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_201107_1652.jpg

And standard Evolve one for the rear : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC005-3b.jpg

 - **The Drivers :**

DIY ISO **06B chain kit** 9 x 26T.
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/26t_drive.jpg

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/pic_0044-3b.jpg
I make a centered master from 3D print, to help me drill the sprocket approximatively well centered (only 3 holes to do ^^ ... x4!).

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PICc0294.jpg

 - **Motors :**

My fav since more a year, [**Overion 6374 130kV**](https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/dsc_0035l.jpg) from the old Darth Vapor.
Never failed, robust, always tonnes of torque.
But thinking more about this it could be 5065 again for lightweight.

_Edit :_ 

Finally, I go 5065, cause I will be an AWD : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC0113-2.jpg

 - **ESCs :**

_[Dual FSESC4.20](https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/img_20180903_184331l.jpg) from the Mad Surfer.. (perfect for my deck and it will force me cruising as I got a small battery)._

_Edit :_ 

For the quattro and this little motor low kV I choose the classic VESC 4.12 : 

[ insert photo] 

 - **Battery pack :**

_10s 5Ah 20c [slim pack (5 x2s)](https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/dsc_0249-2l.jpg), same as the original SWE setup (one day I would like to make a 10s 3p VTC6 pack if it feels good)._

_Edit :_ 

I will try this sweet little beat under 12s with the vesc ,.. I don't charge more than 50v and with the 140kV 30Amps batt max it should be fine ... I hope :blush:
So Lipo pack 12s 10Ah 40C ((3x4s)x2) 

[ insert photo] 

 - **Remote :**

GT2B as usual (since my 1st build, and on almost every setup I have made for me), MadMonkey mod with ch. 3 made by Pimousse.
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/dsc_0073l.jpg

 - **Modules :**

Metr.Pro PCB antenna, the best friends of my phone now I didn't get any issue with it (my phone!).

 - **Enclosure :**

to follow ...

Yes, be sure that me too ! :blush: the test that I had done last year was very brief, my deck + hub motors,.. it was not the perfect combination at all (vibration, plus effect crate reasoning).
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/img_light.jpg
Plus I never really finish it yet: I got some more send to make, paint, varnish, grip design, finish the top cover plate, the locking system, maybe an easy access to the switch etc...
:sweat_smile: it looks like I got some more work to do!

Hey e-riders !

Ok, so, after starting to collect the pieces, and putting them together : 
Evolve mount
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/pic_00052l1.jpg

Custom mount
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/pic_00071l.jpg

I now remember well why I test it just a short time - I couldn't protect and/or fix my lipo inside!

The lipo is at the right dimension (see last photo). But it is doable, it is editable with a bit more work ... ok, a looooot more :smile:
I have to add around 3 layers of wood on top and repeat all the step that I did last year to get access inside again. Plus I don't really know how I will pack the inside for the vacuum  ... short, I'm a bit disappointed atm :disappointed_relieved: 

Sound boring AF. RIP SWE ! I prefer to start a new one I guess, more exciting !! 
During this time, back with the cool and beautiful Arbor AXIS.

Plus, it will be even more fun, as I'm not cramped inside the SWE deck, I will upgrade my 4.20 for 4.12 :grin:
Maybe also 12s instead of 10s ... and maybe more Ah too.

:v:

Hey e-riders !

During the time the new deck with integrated enclosure will take to make... (it could be long with me hahaha) ...
I will make this build with the Arbor deck again, the Axis Koa one  :P (same as the one used at the end of the MAD SURFER) : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_201113_0911.jpg
So it could the brother of the [HagXis Board](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hagxis-board-arbor-axis-40-senor-pepe-90mm-wheels-kahua-trucks-haggy-street-kit-6364-190kv-vesc6-12s5ah-gt2b-3d-print/76683/16) :grin: (with the same deck but in the bamboo finish, and with the street setup).
hihihi so cool ! So perfect :hugs:

Also, I received my sprockets !!! **Finally !**

Can’t wait to see how the Bergmeisters perform on your chain driven rocket. Besides my old bike I have never run chains. How is the noise compared to belts?

Just my POV, from my experiences ... 
Its noisy (at speed), you can make yourself heard with ahah, quiet at low speed (between walkers or cyclist, but still not as belt), but I really like it.
Simple, strong, efficient,.. 
https://youtu.be/aFn9sO8AzGU
Sorry, not the best video with the background music ...
https://youtu.be/cYIV3bAmnbo

I have started with a belt on my 1st esk8, then my second was an emtb with chain (very small one H25, then I upgrade for the iso5 kit from etoxx, but I still have some derailed issue when the chain come a bit lose).
Now I have ridden those big chains (iso 06B) since summer 2017 and I so happy with the kit from Overion : 
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pic_0030bl.jpg

I have **really really good freewheel with it, never derailed, never stuck, never fail**, that I will try to make mine here with the Bergmeister for my AT ride (during the time to finish the GD) :blush: 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/untilnew_2018-nov-28_02-49-36pm-000_customizedview88406302l1.jpg

I don't know if the same diameter size here will work with this big chain, but I want to give a test :P Science..?!

_EDIT :_ rough video :laughing: I called it the **sulfateuse** !

bldc + chains too tight + full throttle doesn't help too ^^

it looks like this transmission will also, perhaps, be compatible with the standard Evolve mounts!

Then I will send them back to a machinist!
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/untilnew_2018_customizedview2055117082.jpg
The mini one looks cool, but I will go with the 63mm compatible (on the right, who also accept 50mm motors).

And I have started to draw the new integrated deck ... so exciting all these news projects!!!

HA, thanks for your highlight here Roman ;) 
Yes, just hope that the axle is long enough to could use the scrub-screw. I have a huge space between the mount and the wheel, this way allow me to center them and maybe enclose them after ... 
But I will make the test :+1:
I made this blank assembly just to see if it fit the Evolve mount (if not I have to make 2 new motor mount ASAP...).

Hey e-riders !

the holes are done! Well, I made a dual kit for now ... the same to do once again :sweat_smile: : 

The centering drilling helper works fine, for sure that's not of the greatest precision or CNC work, but it does the job : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/IMG_20171428.jpg
After the 1st drill, put a screw in place (to ensure the blocking rotation around the centering axis)
You could also repeat it for the second hole/drill
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/IMG_20171638.jpg
Done! 3 others to do :smile: 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PICc0243.jpg

Here is the Bergmeister spacer adapter for the wheel sprocket, with an integrated bearing seat.
It looks fine too : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/IMG_20111913.jpg
Here it is SurfRodz bearing for the test on the Supercarve truck...
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PICc0294.jpg
Then I have to drill the motor sprocket with an m4 threaded.

_To be continued .._ :v:

:smiley: They should arrived tomorow !!

I'm late on some welding now (with the 4 VESCs) ... I have to find time to work on that this WE.
Maybe just make the 1st test in dual again, then pass it to AWD to feel more the changing!

Also, I'm printing the enclosure mold,.. it takes so long ... I will make the surprise last a little longer.  :blush: 
After assembling the prints together I have to make the negative of it in one peace/shape, then bag it and vacuum with resin and fiber etc = rendez-vous in 2019 for this part !! Hahaa
I would love to make a vacuum press for plastic and abs enclosure on day.

Like I say in another topic :
[quote=&quot;Riako, post:44, topic:78504&quot;]
I will post an update of the gear drive prototype ready for e-blank-test soon :wink: (actually hand spin only…)

I was working on a GD for a long time now, and got the fkn silent etoxx one in hand for inspiration / also ready to rock on my next eMTB :blush: but here I mainly focused by **the locking system of the Haggyboard motor mount** and want to try to incorporate almost the same design adapted for my Gear Drive (after asking to Timo of curse), I have two sizes in test actually :
[ ![|690x401](https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/untilnew_2018_customizedview2055117082.jpg) ](https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/untilnew_2018_customizedview2055117082.jpg)
A small one for 50mm only (30 (Maytech/TB/etc and 38mm (Racerstar)), with 1.5m and a bit more compact.
And the bit bigger one, for 50 and 63mm motor, working with m2 and larger gear tooth.
And remixing a dual helical anti-sideload (and auto-centered if I can say, after my hand spinning blank tests) gear to test after the straight one.
[/quote]
it's just laid out for the photo (with the evolve trucks and mount ^^... but it should be for the Kahua truck).
Now my printer resurrects, I will start to 3D print and study the mount more detailed before to make the real one!

Also the 1st post is updated :v:

I feel like the Evolve mount are a bit too short (but I have to test it ^^ ) and the chain will work easier with the front drive (in this case I will make 2 others custom mounts ... but it take times) :

**I got all the mechanical stuff set together !**
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC_b0550.jpg

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC_b0514.jpg

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC_b0546.jpg

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC_b0537.jpg

I made the same on the front side : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC_b0559.jpg

I got my two pairs of chain done.
I drill and thread the 4 sprockets (not the best work, but it works) : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC_b0568.jpg

Now the biggest problem is that I have lost a VESC somewhere ... I hope that he did not leave accidentally in the trash, remained in a package :roll_eyes:

In the meantime, I will prepare it in dual rear, and maybe still do a little beauty below the board (because the top is absolutely beautiful, but then the bottom I'm absolutely not a fan ... unlike the bamboo axis).

**Good last Sunday 2018** :v:

Ok.., I'm sad about that loss, I don't know where did I put this fµ€k!ng VESC but I don't find it anymore aaah :sweat_smile:

So,.. ashamed super quick mounting to could finally make a 1st ride with this Bergmeister wheels in 2018 !
As I havn't change yet the rear motor connectors, I will put the sweety little tiny risky Mini VESC4.20 ready to go (always with the 10s 5Ah 45c Graphene). I make a quick motor detection cause I don't know if I have switched motor and thats all.

For the front, I put the standard hanger back :

This is looking good

I’m really curious how these motors will perform, hopefully runs cool, I was thinking today, my 5055’s have the same stator size as these and Evolve’s 5065, driving in grass for less than 100m was enough to reach 100°C

The Bergermeister wheel looks really good

Thanks Pedro !
 I run them cool since this summer on the [Mad Surfer](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mad-surfer-deck-custom-59-trucks-supercarve-5065-140kv-fsesc4-20-graphene-10s5ah45c-fw-107mm-metr-pro/67049).
I think in AWD it will be perfect :blush: 
I also make a/one ride  with 8", it smooth more hot than with 107mm for sure but I still could take it in hand so ... :) I'm really really happy with them, and for the price I can say anything I guess.

:blush: I have to test one ! Not sure it is the ideal setup for this (I also got a lowered/dropped downhill 9 plis, stiff, w concave, Madrid deck that could be better and more precise), but this duo looks so cool, I have to make a test : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PIC0093-3.jpg

Also like I said, this quattro setup of sprocket coast me around 15€, I got to test this during my GD prototyping, after I'm planning to sell this trucks or maybe keep them for my hub motor project : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/PICc0283.jpg
Just have to make this gear compatible and CNCs the mounts for really and the Gear drive is good to go :crossed_fingers::yum:

Hi everyone ! 

**Happy New Year 2019 everyone and everyone around you! my best wishes and best rides too!**

Hey @b264, it's a custom deck that I made years ago.
I started the original longboard deck here : 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/alienboard-v2-perso-36-aps-3-3kw-170kv-ads-10s5ah/12013
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_4303l.jpg
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/image58.jpeg
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/image32.jpeg

And then mod it again into the SWE deck : 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/swe-custom-33-integrated-enclosure-ronin-cast-modified-hub-motor-80kv-800w-90mm-10s5ah-x2-vescs/13412
Still raw and no-finish but sweet AF !

https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/img_20170613_215036.jpg

Edit : as it is not the best space-design for my lipo (I got 20mm hight inside), I will have to make another one when I finish the drawing and the 3D testing (wheelbite etc.).

Hey e-riders !

I'm waiting for another VESC :neutral_face: ... still doesn't find the 4th one ... 

But, finally, I got a little ride on a dry road :blush: 
https://youtu.be/LTIb__Et5Gw
I really need more power and safety than this dual4.20 for the quattro!

Not so much km done yet (<50), but this wheels are just what I would expect !
Road in bad condition, stony path, dirt road, grass, paved street, wet ... etc. 
![PIC_0770|690x460](upload://drXVFwAMCFOYdTC0qwVkpBKPkWX.jpeg) 

Also, I haven't started the enclosure yet, the print is finished but now I have to mod it as mold.
Hope to find time maybe next week, meanwhile, I can not help but ride :v:

Hey e-riders !

Always more witty, muddy and freezy roads ridden on Bgm !
I have not yet passed the 100kms but I get closer.
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_f800.jpg
I will maybe tighten the chain, normally I do it after the first ride (or 1 or 2 battery pack) but I just wanted to ride, if I touch it I will want to clean it :smile:

If you are patient enough and very brave, you will be able to admire (or rather glimpse) the athlete in a magnificent old schooool ski suit, speeding on trail, showing the overflowing capacity of the Dual FSESC 4.20 (well, the pedestrian walkway has a bow shape, it is very tiring to climb in walking - DAM! One more week I guess and I should get the last vesc),.. with incredible piloting attempt (burn, skid), and at the end I turn in a very tight circle on a small circle with a child's play... admire (or not) :rofl: Good luck : 
https://youtu.be/53LIxpL7JH4
In addition, there is no music this time but the sound shouting the sulfateuse!! 

I will come back to you when I have the last Vesc to pass the move to the Quattro, or for a new return on the Haggy Bergmeister (Bgm) once the first 100 kilometers traveled.

Good luck and good week to all  :v:

And yes Simon ;) directly designed from the [Haggy universal 60t adapter](https://haggyboard.com/products/universal-60t-adapter) to integrate a bearing at the right place for TB218mm 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/60t-universal-drive.jpg
[quote="riverside.rider, post:50, topic:76241"]
@Riako has done a great 60T pulley design for the Bergmeister to make it compatible with torqueboard’s sexy TB218. There are now some fine adjustments being made and I will update you once everything has been fully tested and is ready for download. I will also check to see if it is viable to have the TB218 compatible pulley CNC milled by the same company that does our heatsinks and Bergmeister rims.

Ok e-rider,

I can stop building different setups in my mind, and I find some interesting change to make according to my needs :

* Keep this little city build, lightweight and simple = **Stay on dual rear**
* Change Dual FSESC 4.20 > **dual ESCape** (I guess)
* Change the Racerstar 5065 140kV > my best motor, running since 2017 : **Overion 6374 130kV enclosed**
* 10s 5Ah > **12s ...Ah**
* Chain > **GD**
* Evolve Supercarve trucks > RKP trucks

Of curse, this means I will set the originally planned Quattro setup somewhere else ;) 

I'll update the title and the first post as soon as I start.
Can't wait !!! 

 :v: :yum:

:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: no mate ! You're perfectly right.
I was playing with the drive since last week, because of this : 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/24hr-super-sale-bergmeister-wheels/78504/166?u=riako

And since I do not have a Kegel style in 100mm or more (The TB 110mm seams great, but I don't know if I'm gonna reuse urethane wheel for my everyday board). I had to make it happened with this awesome combo !

So, like for the chain drive on the Bgm, I made an adaptater for FatBoy Nano Urethane Gear Drive 1:2.6 !!

As I plan a big update of this build, and there will only be wheels left :smile: I will start a new buildlog !!!

Hard to tell actually with the low temp. outside. Plus I mostly ride it an hour a day, not draining entirely the battery (and I have a hight cut off start on this Graphene pack, 3.7v/cell, working from almost 2 yrs now).
Around 10 and 18km, depending on how you play with throttle etc. :)

Another little vid of the 1st session, super exciting :blush: (nothing special to see, I especially want to keep memories of this).
https://youtu.be/yPd10fgsPzc

Since then I have done a second session before yesterday, with a time of 50 second I would say, and I was "racing" in cutt-off start (max speed around 25 / 30kmh, but I was able to maintain the speed almost anywhere and thus to cleanly roll each turn without too much braking at a small deceleration).

And since, I get a trill riding it like a mini mtb :smile:  
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_00425-2l.jpg
I have also set a brake light simple and easy (like Jenso), for the future GR.

Only on G-Bomb can you get the full radius afforded to LDP skating at a drop-through height for TB218s and Bergs. 

I did a quick mock-up (TB Freeflow CF deck) and it looks really, really strong with brackets (as Sofu has demonstrated on her Haya). 

Looking forward to showcasing a few builds on [](Https://)

Yes, it is really a nice and cool deck! Plus it looks good too.
Maybe also cause I fall in love riding it powerless 1st during a summer and I have already ridden it powered too (with Cronin and 90mm hubs) year ago.

I (personally) feel more comfortable on it than on my Icarus (my pusher).

But I would love more a bigger deck (longer and wilder) now, like the gorgeous **THE 44"** Redember :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
And it will be nice, to finally test an AWD now!.. Like initially planned... 

We will see ... :v: ;)

So, for a standard DT, yes it works (on this AXiS deck) !
