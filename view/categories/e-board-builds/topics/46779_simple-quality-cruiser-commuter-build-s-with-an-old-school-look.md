So I have been researching electric boards [prebuilt] for the past few weeks, and I can't seem to find exactly what I want. I decided to consider the DIY route, but I figured I should ask the pros if my vision is realistic. I am thinking of starting this process with just a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. This way I can kick it around town for a few weeks while I work out the details of the drivetrain, motor, ESC, battery/charger, and remote. This post may contain useless information, please forgive me I am a complete noob....

My girlfriend and I live 1 mile and 2.5 miles away from our offices. There are exactly ZERO hills along our routes. We are both between 140-150lbs. There is no need for us to travel any faster than 15MPH, but we would like to easily cruise at this speed without the motor being maxed out (for the sake of component lifespan). I have a few parts in mind so far for the "base" of the build (see below). 

ABEC 11 Flywheels 97mm
Bones Ceramic Reds Bearings
10 Inch Caliber Trucks (44 Degree)
Deck 9x30 to 10x32 with a subtle kicktail in the rear only with a very retro shape.

Can a board be built that tops out at 15mph without maxing out the motor to reach said speeds?
Will the components needed to reach 15mph with solid 6 mile range fit on a shorter deck?
Will an electric skateboard with a deck so short be stable on takoff/while riding at a 15MPH speed?

I want this thing to be solid, comfortable and practical.


Thank you in advance for the assistance.

Thanks for the 1 hour of "research", lack of looking for your own answers and wanting to be spoon fed info instead of just looking at the countless other builds that have been done and guides that have been posted on how to start.

Since you started this thread, you've still done zero research on your on on this forum and just waited for others to do it for you.

Don't be so aggro bruh. I asked logistical/hypothetical questions that are not going to be answered specifically in a build post. Trust that I have looked over multiple build posts and did not find satisfactory answers. I am definitely not here to argue with you, and if this posts makes you angry you can kindly remove yourself from it.

I even had a look at the post you linked, and didn't see anything resembling an answer to the three questions I asked. I am not looking to be spoon fed anything, I just wanted to know if this is a feasible project given my specific needs. I have no problem doing the legwork....

If you're doing a single motor build, (which you should probably do since there's no hills and you only need to cruise at 15 mph), consider a mount with idler pulleys, so you can use a lower gear ratio (13/36T as opposed to 16/36T) and not worry about the belt skipping on the motor pulley, especially when braking. 

Perhaps, take a look at mounts with idler pulleys by @marcmt88, I've got one and it works great. And I know that @Boardnamics also sells some nice idler mounts

Thanks for the reply and the suggestions, I will definitely investigate these parts later! What do you think about the the stability of a shorter board at the speeds I am looking for? Do you think quality components will fit in the space available on a shorter board?

Check out my build: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/popsicle-stick-of-death-concept/46152/11?u=clonkex (note that my build isn't the popsicle stick of death, that's just where I posted that information)

I haven't done a proper build thread but that's a pretty detailed description. It's super easy to ride and comfortably cruises at 25km/h (~15mph). 44Â° trucks would make it even easier to ride. There's several people on this forum that ride fairly short boards (I believe @b264 is one of them) and don't have any trouble. I'm on 6S currently so the acceleration is solid but won't try to throw you off (unless it's your first time riding and you pull the throttle more than halfway too quickly :stuck_out_tongue:). I highly recommend the 192kv SK3 motor from HobbyKing. It's unsensored but you don't _need_ sensored in any way, shape or form. It's just a nice-to-have.

My board will reach ~28km/h on flat when fully charged and feels totally stable (although with my loose, high-angle trucks it took me a few goes to learn to avoid speed wobbles when I was new to the board).

I tried a 12s setup on a penny board and it turned out terrible. Whenever I release the trigger, I get a jolt backwards due to the lack of momentum and sudden lose of acceleration. The board was just as heavy as the esk8 components and the fact that it was only 27 inches long didn't help with the balance. I would suggest a somewhat heavier or longer board.

Then why did you suggest 12S? That's a terrible idea. 12S is not necessary or a good idea in any way for a board like this (especially considering some VESCs aren't even safe on 12S). 10S would be the safe maximum, though personally I think 6S is pretty good for a short-range commuter.

I concur. If you want a bit more range you should go for a 10s2p(~11miles). I personally don't like 6s since it's slow and it gives off more heat which is why I suggested a higher voltage.

Not sure what the deal with 12s is. Some people are fine with it, some people say it's not good. :unamused:

Lou board apparently uses a 36v 2.2ah pack on their 1.3kw hub, hardly 2p.

Some VESCs are built using 50V components, which is not high enough for 12S. Even with 60V components that's not enough for safe use bearing in mind the 80% rule. Some people run at that voltage just fine but some people get thrown off when a cap explodes. I just never recommend it unless you're an experienced builder. Or maybe if you're in a YOLO kind of mood... :P

6S definitely does create more heat but I don't find it to be a problem. With a chunky motor like an SK3 192kv there's no issue with the motor's heat (it never gets hot enough to burn me, even on extended runs). I run at 60A battery max on my FOCBOX, and it never gets more than moderately hot, and the batteries never get hot at all. You'd be able to run 40A on a non-focbox VESC I think. Even the relatively slim phase wires I have never get more than luke warm.

However if you're looking for slightly more power and range without going overboard, 8S is a great midpoint.

I'm not sure of all the parts arcboards uses, but I've owned the penny more then a year now and it's proven very reliable. It's actually the only production board I own, everything else is diy. But like I said, just look to the board for inspiration. Didn't ask you to buy one. And I do agree that if you're going for li-on cells, go for at least 2p.

Gotcha. My short response was probably born from the little frustration caused by the first reply and a lot of people replying off topic initially. To be clear I am not looking to build a penny if you mean a tiny plastic board. Ideal dimensions are close to 10x31 with 10 inch trucks and 90+ mm wheels or so. A similar production board would be the Riptide. The OP was more to gauge if building a board of those dimensions with DIY components was viable and I believe my questions has been answered at this point. I appreciate your input, my apologies for the blunt response.

No problem man, perhaps the metro board built on the Spud would be better inspiration then? There are a few builds on the forums using the spud as well. I believe @JLabs has them for sale. I dislike single motor builds myself, but tbh single motor builds save quite a bit in weight, and even more in cost. Is your budget of 1.5 for both boards or is it 1.5 per board? At 1.5 per board you can make something very decent for your use case. and even splurge a bit on some parts. At 1.5 for both boards you may need to get a bit creative and  diy more then you might be comfortable with. My first board was overly complex and almost completely diy, and I regretted so many things about it. If this is your first time as well, and you don't have much experience building things, I would suggest looking to getting complete kits from diyelectricskateboard, or combining several complete kits.

I have had some thoughts on getting a custom enclosure made. Have you heard of a materiel called Kydex? It's commonly used for custom gun holsters. It can be heated to be pliable, and formed to any shape. It's lightweight and rigid when it cools. I suspect I can get one made easily to fit my needs in my corner of the world.

What about a prebuilt board, like from Genesis or Meepo? You could be riding in a few days. And when the hub motors fail, you can upgrade to a belt system and upgrade the esc to a vesc. And you can always swap the deck. I think their batteries are 10s2p, which should be fine for your short commute. For $300-$400, it's a solid starting platform.

Yep! I've never used it personally, but am planning to do so for an upcoming build. It does seem the most convenient option. the reason I haven't tried is because I tend to like enclosures in one single piece. And my builds so far have batteries too large for me to have a kydex enclosure in one piece. Plus I don't own a monster oven.

I would personally avoid buying a prebuilt with plans to upgrade. My first attempt at diy was to fix a benchwheel, then tried to upgrade it. The end product would have been the cost of a diy+the benchwheel itself. Might as well just go for the cost of the diy only.

I am not super familiar with ABS other than I know the skid plate on my moto is made from ABS. Can you vacuum mold ABS like Kydex? If so I suspect either option would be viable. Kydex is a little thinner and probably a little lighter, but you are right either would be a great option.

I believe you can work with ABS in much the same way as Kydex (heat in an oven then press over a mould, or just vacuum form). However I seem to remember someone saying that it was a bit more fiddly to get a clean result with ABS. @MysticalDork was that you that was telling me about enclosure materials? 

ABS is one of the most 3D-printed materials, incidentally.

Yes you can, and one of my enclosures was made that way. Problem is it's a very bad enclosure. It looks all right, but Its too thin and flimsy. I made two, and the first one is horribly cracked already. I could only get success with a relatively thin sheet. @psychotiller makes awesome enclosures tho. He might have something for you.

ABS and Kydex are about the same. Kydex is a little tougher, but it's more expensive. You can also use PVC, but it's less cooperative. Polystyrene is cheap but very brittle, not recommended for enclosures.

Ok so I found the a deck around the size I wanted. I went ahead and ordered it along with the trucks/wheels/bearings listed in my OP.

Length: 33.3â Width: 9.75â Wheelbase: 20â-20.75â

http://liqwoodboardsports.bigcartel.com/product/2017-swashbuckler

I spent the majority of my day researching batteries/motors. The batteries that look most attractive to me based on what I have read are these but I am going to wait to order until I have selected all of the remaining parts for the build. - https://voltaplex.com/6s3p-21.6v-7.5ah-li-ion-18650-battery-pack-lg-he4-cuboid  - It looks like I have a ton of options for connectors and battery safety that I also need to consider.

I am no closer to determining which motor I want yet as I have not been able to use RCcalc to figure out the kv rating/drivetrain specs I need to get to my desired speeds efficiently. I will get there....eventually.

That's where I am currently. I will add a pic once the base of my build arrives in a few days.

After spending 20 of the last 24 hours researching my brain is not operating at full capacity any longer. A small part of me wants to consider finding kit that has the VESC/Batteries already mounted to an enclosure, something more plug and play. I found something that looks to be for hub motors with an ESC but from what I can tell it would lack the ability to customize for my specific application. See - http://www.diyeboard.com/electric-skateboard-7s2p-44ah-battery-esc-power-kit-p-525.html - Does anyone have experience/familiarity with something like this?

Do you have a soldering iron? If so, grab it and have a go at soldering some random things. It's not difficult to learn to solder. Basically, you want to "tin" (put a layer of solder onto) the tip of your iron, then tin both things you want to solder together, then (usually using a "third hand" device) position the two wires against each other, apply the iron to one of the wires (and add a small amount of solder between the iron and wire if it's not heating the wire enough) and start attempting to melt solder into both pieces of wire. Of course if you're soldering two wires you can always twist the wires together first to make things easier ;)

The goal is to have just enough solder on the tip of the iron and the wires such that when you press the iron into the wire, the heat is transferred into the wire well enough that you can touch the solder to the other side of the wire and have the wire melt the solder, not the tip of the iron. You also want to have the iron hot enough that the solder becomes completely liquid and flows freely into the wire. If the solder doesn't melt enough you'll create a "cold" joint, which will be a physically weak joint with low current capacity.

If you feel like you're not achieving anything, we'll be happy to help you get there :slight_smile:

"better" is subjective.  What do you want?  The kit is "better" for optimising time spent to a minimum

There are lots of "betters" here.  Cheaper?  More performance?  More range?  Faster to build?  More failure-resistant? Looks nicer? Sells better? Lighter?  Lower profile?

I would think it would do what it says on the tin, but we can't know what cells they use and the ESC probably won't be customisable. I suspect the cost-cutting factor of that sort of kit would be quality.

I would like to achieve top speed without keeping the motor "pinned".
I would like to achieve the round trip without exhausting the batteries beyond 70% of their capacity.

The reason I would like to achieve these results is to avoid stressing the components, and to increase the lifespan of the build. This may not actually be necessary, but that is my thinking.

Is there a reason you want to build it, versus buy it?

This is a great tool to calculate what you need.  And with vesc you can control the maximum RPM therefore your speed

I believe what @b264 is saying is that the prebuilt kit might achieve your goals, as would a DIY setup. However each would be "better" than the other in different ways. You need to decide which "better" you care about more. You might achieve the same goals with the prebuilt kit and gain "quick, easy and cheap" but sacrifice "quality".

I would say that with your budget you could definitely do better than the prebuilt kit. And by that I mean achieve the same things, but you would have to put in time and effort, and it would cost more. However you would end up with a build that could potentially be more reliable (depending on your own skill in building it) and use higher quality parts that are less likely to break. Plus you could use VESCs and get the ultimate customisation ;)

A Metroboard Shortboard would perfectly meet your goals

The only production board that I actually liked the look of was the Riptide, and I couldn't bring myself to spend $800 on a board made in Shenzhen. I figured for around 1k I could make my own that was purpose built, and more reliable long term.

My daily commuter actually isn't one of my DIY boards, it's a Metroboard Shortboard on a Powell-Peralta Lance Mountain Reissue deck and honestly, everything you're describing is exactly this.  It's very high-quality as far as prebuilt ones go, definitely the top of the top.  It's built to not break down, unlike most other ones on the market.  They are made in the USA

Have you ever had cleanace issues? It looks from their website like itâs mounted on 1 inch risers and still has only about an inch of clearance between enclosure and ground.   

Battery must be massive in an enclosure that thick, probably gets great range, like 20-30 miles or so?

It's got 25.4mm riser in total, but some of it is lights.  Never had clearance issues, using 107mm wheels, I am 210lbs.  It has a 5Ah 12S LiFePO4 battery.

For OP's situation this seems better than the diyeboard kit unless there is some reason to build it that this doesn't offer

Cool this one looks way better than RCcalc!
