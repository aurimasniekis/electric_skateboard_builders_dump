Where did you get a pair of Carvon SD?  Are they V4 SD?

Hey man,

You mentioned you wanted a 12s5p pack-from what I've seen the best (thinnest) way to get there is to make a pack out of 18650 cells. I personally have never done that (not enough time), but you'll end up with a nice pack if its done right. 

For remotes, there are a bunch of different vendors that sell different styles/types of remotes. Enertion, Torqueboards, and I think even HobbyKing all sell remotes that would get you what you wanted.

As for enclosures, a lot of people here vacuum form their own. If you want to buy one and save yourself the trouble, I know @psychotiller makes and sells his designs online. I also know some people who 3D print enclosures, which could work if you've got access to one.

Use the search button here and don't be afraid to read ancient posts. There's a lot of good advice hidden, you just gotta look for it. Best of luck and can't wait to see the final product.
