Waiting on parts...Decided to build my own deck out of 1pc pine. It's still a work in progress. Gotta round off some edges and give her some contours. I have to make it look like a little more than a pop-sickle stick. LOL

Nice, how different is the single pine vs the ply with laminate.....i would think the board would want to split

That's the plan, my man!! Got some 3K twill

I live in Oregon, USA, so I can get my hands on some really nice yellow pine. No heartwood and well seasoned. This isn't framing lumber grade wood. This will become the bottom of the board. A second "hollowed out" layer will give it a little more thickness, but with room for the electronics, weight relief and some vibration damping options (possibly solid maple). Those layers will be carved and sanded together. That whole piece will then get a nice skinning of carbon on the bottom with overlap on the edges. The edges where the battery compartment sits will have carbon overlapping into a "D" shape for stiffness Then a piece will cover the top with a soft 21" radius. Haven't picked a material for the top. Maybe a veneer and clear grip? This is all still very experimental, but I have solid vision for where it's going.
 I'll keep up with the pics and stuff, so everyone can see what I'm cooking up. I have some unusual vibration dampening ideas that I'm kicking around. FUN STUFF!!

@Surfnerd This is only the bottom of the board and one of the layers. Carbon fiber will give me all of the added stiffness that I need. It's going to be a heavy duty board. 
@treenutter I'll be sure to let you know how it rides. All of the reference lines are built off of the golden ratio. 1.618. I was trying to see what it would look like if I could design something where almost all of the dimensions are "golden ratio". Really weird number patterns start emerging.

@Ulfberht that's cool concept! That theory seemingly applies to everything. This will look great with a CF layer, looking forward to seeing the result. [I applied a layer CF vinyl to my current eksk8](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carbon-fiber-vinyl-wrapping-a-deck/265), but my plan is to use real CF next time.

@treenutter Nice build man! I went to the link you posted and posted a link about 3M knifeless tape for super clean and easy vinyl cuts. I haven't personally used it, but it looks like an amazing solution! 
I am thinking about using some of this stuff on various projects not limited to ESK8.

@longhairedboy Thanks bro! Win or lose, its still worth it to get your hands dirty and have some fun with it. I still am waiting on parts and that is frustrating right now. I would like to have all of my parts, so that I can get an actual fitting of my parts to the deck. You were a big inspiration for me wanting to do this project instead of just bolting a box to a deck. Seeing your stuff made me want to step up my game. 
@treenutter This 3m Defender spray film looks like a great top coat for carbon fiber. I'm thinking right now...2 coats of epoxy, 3 coats of clear, 1 coat of 3M Defender. I know you are interested in doing CF.Check this video out. Very DOABLE!!!

This is good info. I have a roll of CF twill in my shop and i'm about to build a box with it as the top layer. I'm going to do a fiberglass box with two layers and sand it super smooth, paint it black, then finish it with a third layer of this stuff right here. ITs going to take a few days i guess, so i'm hoping to get started on it soon. 

Its going to be my first step into CF so i'm glad i'm good with fiberglass as a last minute backup plan. 

He's using Resin Research. I'll be using WS 105/207 which i need to do a little more reading on.

NICE!! Can't wait to see what you come up with! I already know it's going to be killer! The way your boards are concave, you could just cover them and not have to worry about flex or anything. You could probably even reduce the amount of veneer layers too. Let me know how that West Systems stuff works out. I'm using a 2 part from CJ Composites (good people). We'll see what happens. WS is supposed to be the shit!

thx @Ulfberht! I like your plan to use the defender spray as the top layer over CF... because I think it would be heartbreaking to scuff and destroy a well-polished CF top layer. It's cool that it could be removed and replaced if needed, like the screen protectors people use on their mobile phones.

WHat I also like about the Defender stuff is that you can wax over it with any automotive wax like Mother's Carnauba. Extra shine, water beading off and a layer that can be more easily maintained. Like you said, you can remove it too...I hope it pans out to be as user friendly as it appears.

A couple of pics I snapped today. Other parts are finally going to be shipping out!! YAY!!!:thumbsup:
It's definitely got a way to go, but it's starting to look more like a skateboard. All of those hard lines make me cringe. It's going to get a lot more sculpted after I get the actual dimensions. I need to get everything to fit nicely.

About 1.5", but I'll run it through the planer a couple of passes before I join the pieces to make sure they joint well. I'm going to wing it a little with the size, but maybe down to 1.25" and a little under 1.5" with the lid.

No matter what I can always make some adjustments. If the sizing doesn't work out, I"ll replace the middle layer with a slightly thicker piece. I think at 1.5" I'll be able to make it work, though. I'm giving .75" for battery thickness, to be on the safe side.. The bottom board is .75" thick and routed down .55" to fit the pack. The middle is straight hollow @.75", so we are looking at about 1.3" of gap before the top is added. Should leave me .55" wiggle room. .25" gap top and bottom + .05"
We'll see what works!!  [quote="Michaelinvegas, post:19, topic:2616, full:true"]

```
Thanks man! 
When it comes to clamps the main thing is to make sure that you have a very flat clamping force. Any wonky angles and it will dig into the wood. Otherwise, keep clamping pressure from being too extreme. You don't need to clamp it down with a huge amount of force. The glue will bond just fine as long as the mating surfaces are in solid contact. I do a dry fit first before I put the glue on. If there are any gaps or big voids then the surfaces need to be flattened more to seat. If you can get the surfaces to seat pretty good without clamps, then it will be easy and require much less clamping force. I use Tightbond 2 wood glue. Works better than anything I have tried to date. Including Tightbond 3. 
IF I do get some denting, I take a wet cloth and put it over the dent. Then I use a hotknife to push down and "steam" the dent out. Works like a charm. You can also use a wet cloth and a heat gun or hair dryer.

First, I make sure that I take the time to make a good, scale drawing. Then I make sure my pieces of wood are nice and flat, or run it through a planer if not. Then I drew an exact centerline on the wood pieces. From the centerline, you can find the true center of the board. Getting a piece flat with centerline and true center is half the battle. With those critical reference points layed out, I drew in the rest of my reference lines from my drawing. Once you start drawing things inm, frequently measure to make sure it all matches the drawing. The outside dimensions are not too critical because you will want to sand the pieces flush after they are glued up. 
I actually used chisels for most of the detailed work. An angle grinder for some of the heavier wood "carving" and an orbital sander to smooth it all out. I used a drill press to drill the truck bolt holes. Nothing high tech...
I'm sure you can make something like this. Just don't get frustrated when things don't work out like you thought. It happens. I made  a bunch of revisions to my drawing before I got something I could work with. Once you have that, you just keep it tight to the dimensions and keep going back to the drawing for reference. Measure 3X cut once! LOL Seriously..I make mistakes sometimes and it's usually because of some bad measurement I took because I was trying to rush or because I got frustrated...If you have any specific questions about woodworking or you get stuck on something PM me and I'll help you out.

It's all about the reference lines. Every spot where lines and edges meet. I drew the lines for the depth on the side of the piece. With all of the reference lines drawn in, I was able to use a chisel to "trace" the lines. I go over once with very little pressure to cut the line clean. Then I go over a couple more times with more pressure. Once you have a nice clean cut, you chisel one side leaving kind of a shelf. I keep making passes until I get to the depth I want. With a sharp chisel it goes faster than one would think. I got this done quicker than if I had set up a template for a router. To get those angles I cut a shelf then carved it down with a chisel and flattened it with a little sanding block I made out of a small 2x2" piece of maple with sandpaper glued to it. I just try to stay inside the lines and keep looking at the rest of the board to make sure that it's not getting out of whack and to make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in drawing in my lines.

@MidnightOne  Shoot! Sorry I took so long to get back to you! I haven't been getting my notifications on this forum lately. I get some, but not all...Weird...
To answer your question. NO...The one I already posted pics of is not done. I tested it and it had some issues with wheelbite with the 90mm ABEC 11s that I wanted to run on it. I'll come back to it and rework it later.
So.... I designed another version that would be more compact, yet have plenty of space inside for the electronics and a much better ram air intake style design to keep the electronics cooler. Here's some more recent pics. I'm not great at taking pics step by step. I usually just get lost in it and do chunks at a time. LOL Here's a few pics I snapped of the V2 design. Once I get some designs that work great and a "proof of concept" I'm going to make these out of better woods. Sort of like an electric guitar. There's no reason why we can't be rolling on something a little more refined. IMO. It's pine with figured maple sides and a dark walnut Danish oil finish. The upgraded V3 will have mahogany or walnut sides with a dye finished flame maple bottom. Just killer...That will allow me to do custom colors, sunburst finishes, and fades. The other's are in the works right now...I'm trying to get better at taking pics of my stuff. LOL

Yep, in the pics above you can see the pile is growing. I'm working out some designs, but not letting myself get too "Stuck" on one idea. Tech is changing all the time and I want my boards to be somewhat future proof. 
Initially the idea was to give this board a nice finish so that I could do a cool custom grip tape design. I am not sure If I want to clear grip or liquid grip it or what...I'm already working on the next prototype. I got the concept done in pine, but there are a lot of cool woods out there. How about Flame Maple...Like my electric guitars...I just love that wood and I have some from a couple of custom guitar builds I did last year. It should be much stronger and amazing to look at. Here's some of what I got lined up...Whatcha think?

Thanks @Ulfberht!  Yeah - think the e-Sugar is shaping up well.  Got the motor and trucks mounted - just need to sort out the electronics next.  It has the power (flat braided) on top like boosted.  This will be a guest board so my GF can ride hers when folks are over and we head out.

Ultimately this was my first practice run and I keep learning each time i do GF/CF epoxy to reinforce (or cosmetic) a board.  Worked on an Omen Chief last night and had to _**re-learn that CF is ITCHY**_ (sanding dust). 

I vote the flame maple for sure!  If you do it - you cannot cover it fully w/ grip tape - clear or otherwise.  Make sure to leave a stripe or some pattern to see the beautiful wood beneath!

I already have some of the 40t Abec gears on order from DIYes/Torque!  Can't wait for these!

[/quote]



You are right. That is a totally reasonable concern. No concave at this stage. Not a big deal. This is a prototype, so I opted to go with less labor steps for this one. Because the top piece is separate from the base and also much thinner (3ply), It is a lot easier to press a concave than trying to press a super thick piece. Using a flat piece also reveals how durable the top piece would be under load. If it's gonna crack, it would be a flat piece over a concave piece any day...NO cracking,  no sqeeking, and it has a nice responsive ride feel. I actually expected it to be a little more unstable than it actually was. Riptide Krank double barrel bushings and WTB pivot cups...(93A boardside, 87A roadside. 42° Buck trucks w/ 1/2" Luxe flat risers.)
   It would also be feasible to change tops out with different concave radii and profiles. The tops bolt to the support rails that go down the length of the board. This is designed to allow a lot of adjustment and testing for me and for a customer to experiment with without having to buy and change out a whole new deck!! I'm already working with a longboard maker out of Huntington Beach, CA to make me some prototype tops for testing. I want to have some options available. The standard profiles are already established, so why not just go with what already works and support a really cool family based company from Cali? Pressing decks is not difficult, but there are issues that can arise. For one thing, the cost of DIY pressing is MUCH more expensive than getting them made by a company that not only has years of expertise, but also the contract pricing set up with their wood dealers. Even after they tack on their premium it still comes out a lot cheaper than if I did it myself. Labor is a big factor....
   Who knows...I may try to make my own too, but It's looking like I'll be able to farm that work out and experiment with some other options later. If all works out, my next prototype will have optional tops in W-concave, 20" radial, progressive, and I want to develop a good asymmetric concave for goofy footers.. That is where I may want to try and do some DIY pressing, so I can really get in there and experiment.
 Prototyping is like jumping out of an airplane and then furioulsly trying to sew together a parachute before you hit the ground! LOL I look forward to seeing your designs too, bro! It's a lot of fun going out on a limb and doing something totally different! :sunglasses::thumbsup:

That prototype stage is good. You have a good design going. I've decided on a wood lid for my next board. 1/16 veneers have been time consuming to build with, but the results have been great. Curves fell better. Hummie doesn't like to go more than a 15 mph on my board cause it has no concave. So I've been pressing this deck from veneers and his deck. Cause of sanding, it's basically a slightly smaller version of his deck. You should check out veneers and pressing with them some time when you have the time. I'm starting to think this is he best way to make a solid deck

I was sliding that board I made without grip tape, so it's not too horrible. I did have some sketchy moments around tight turns on mild downhill sections. My front foot was trying to slide up the front of the board. I had to use my upper leg to resist. With no concave, I have found that as long as the ride height isn't too high, your bushings are appropriate for your weight and adjusted properly, It's not too bad. It has a bit of a "tippy" feel. The center of balance is still in the center of the board, it just feels weird. You have to have some curve. You can also build up areas to create curve or w. Some people take grip tape, dense foam, duct tape, or other stuff to build up sections to get the exact foot feel they are looking for. In theory you could build up a flat surface with raised edges and get a pretty good feel. Here's a cool write up on the topic. From the guys over at MotionBoardshop....

I though about that before. I tried to CNC mill concave, but the wood I used fell apart. It might work if you use the right wood. I might try it again some day, but I'm really into the pressing thing now.

I wish I could outsource this work, as I have some good designs. But I have yet to find a board manufaturer that I can work with.

I like your spirit! A true DIYer!! Awesome! It can be frustrating sometimes, as you already know, but man is it great when something works out. It's a good feeling to know that you are making something with your own hands. 
When it comes to farming out the work, just send an email or give a quick phone call to a company that you think could help you and see what they can do for you. You might find that they are easier too work with and more receptive than you may have previously thought. Another angle I have been exploring is furniture and cabinet makers in my area. What better sources for wood and industrial CNC woodworking machines. If you talk to them nice they often are eager to show off what they can do for you. I've met a few really cool shop owners in my town that taught me a lot just from phone conversations. I'd reach out to some local makers and let them know what you are doing and see what their response is. It's worth a shot and you get to meet some really cool people sometimes. People happy to share and help! :)

the old evolve carbons had no concave either. basically I started with that board into the electric longboard world and it felt ok after fiddling with the sidewinder bushings ... and then I build my landyachtz topspeed and from that point onwards I just couldnt ride my evolve anymore, cause I felt I had zero grip on that stupid flat surface - so guess its all a matter of what you are used to.  :smile:

I had a a great, working deck that I've been using for the last 6 months or so, but I got tired of having no concave. At the time, I told my self this won't affect me. I go ride hummies board, and I'm like, crap, this is how a deck should feel at high speed. So I used his deck and stole the shape to press a board with shape. I would love to see more people in the deck making industry. Too many enclosures, not enough decks :P

It's not hard honestly with the vacuum press from roar rocket, some titebond III, and a mold. From there, draw a pattern, cut it out or sand it down to that using a belt sander or dremel. Then you can finish up your touches with some good polycrylic. Simple as that really. I did this the hard route by cnc milling. I got a more symmetric board by cnc milling first, but it was a pain in the butt, as it always messed up when it did multiple sheets. So I had to cut them, 1 at a time, all the way now up to 17 layers. And each one takes about an hour to cut due to moving crazy amounts of clamps around between cuts.

Bottom line, anyone can do it, they just need 30-40 hours at least.

I totally agree. It's one of those things where it seems simple until you really dig in and see how much thought goes into the contours on some of these boards. What one person will like and what a different person will like are all based on a ton of variables. Foot size, board width, goofy vs. regular, what the person is used to riding, etc... They all play a part in the design considerations. Finding a board that feels right for the most number of riders is the tricky part. Just a subtle change in the concave can feel totally different. So on my "built in electronics" designs, I made it a two piece so that I could change out the tops with different concaves to find that right feel. I personally like the locked in feel of  a nice radial concave, but the more I look into the W, the more I see the potential for reduced flex and more support for the arch of the foot. It's the huge amount of options and variables that make the perfect design so elusive. Too much freedom. But that is both the joy and pain of testing. 
 It's like gourmet cooking...Sure all of the ingredients are pretty standard and everyone has access to them, but it takes a little something special to take those ingredients and create a dish that inspires! :fork_and_knife:

my favourite is also slight radial concave like with a micro drop or with medium wheel wells to put your foot against, very light onsetting W towards the center with some rocker and all that with medium flex! :smile:

its a cool idea with the changeable top, can do a lot of variations with that!
