Hi, Everyone after searching with no luck for MBS motor mounts and or E mountain board conversion parts of any kind "at least in the USA" i decided to design my own. The base of my build is the mbs core 94, i'm running dual sk3 6374 190kv motors powered by 2 torqueboards Vesc's and 2 pulse 10,000 mah 6s in series for 12s. My gearing is 10/62 and i'm running the mbs billet wheels with the vine 8' tires. Custom parts on the board include the battery corners and hold downs, esc enclosure and custom aluminum and carbon fiber motor mounts, i'm also working on my own 8" !  for feedback from anyone interested in purchasing mounts or any of the other components listed as well as fully built boards and just feedback in general, this hobby/sport is so incredible i feel it should be more easily supported through domestic aftermarket support so im throwing my hat in the ring. Thanks Guys and Gals look forward to hearing from you!!!![20190410_195609|690x418](upload://ce8iRrm0SilBn3p0SXUQhKnSwDT.jpeg) ![20190410_200507|690x436](upload://7Jsi6pKgVawjSMzXP5LaacCqVDC.jpeg) ![20190410_195916|666x500](upload://zKljq9vZbtu7mUhk2VfkIXYbpsa.jpeg) ![20190410_195802|690x388](upload://zgWJnRgvEaLBRYNesUAOZQbbKFL.jpeg) ![20190322_153146|666x500](upload://3pHJx2cywW51zL0t7zwPjk29AEM.jpeg) ![20190301_235509|690x388](upload://5DYLRklwqUkP8NetRM3IhSu9B13.jpeg)

it looks like those green mounts are 3d printed.

If so could you share the 3d model or stl? 
and since I'm asking already -- how did you attach the green motor mounts to the truck?

They are 3d printed prototypes the ones for sale will be carbon fiber. They have a keyway that matches the brake knotch on the truck and set screws to hold them in place. Ill be selling a motor mount kit aswell as full builds.

thanks for the Info! I'm into DIYing as much as possible, so I guess i need to play with my own 3d models more.

I designed some as well. They are pricey though, $60 each and thats not me making profit if I sold them.

Nice they look great do you have any problems with them moving side to side under torque with no cross supports?

No issues at all, i even went down pretty hard durring the k1 speed races hosted by evolve. Board landed square on the mounts, no misalignment issues or anything of the sort. They are solid.

Thank you! I put a lot of hard work into designing it. The deck is a skateshred maple double drop deck that I skinned with carbon fiber on both sides using a vacuum bag technique to ensure even and consistent spread of the resin. Originally it was a prototype to prove my concept and eventually move to selling them. Unfortunately my partner bailed out on me for personal reasons and I won't be able to bring it to market by myself. Money is tight after my initial investment and I lack the space to build them because I live on a sailboat. Not to mention the hit to my moral was pretty devastating so yeah... oh well atleast I got two sick DIY's, lol

I thought your work was a commercial board, designed by a professional product manager.  nice proportions on the grip too, commendable job.

Thank you, that really means a lot to me and your words have helped encouraged me not to give up on a possible production model. I was able to fit my laser cutter, 3d printer and battery construction equipment on my boat so im not totally out of the game.
