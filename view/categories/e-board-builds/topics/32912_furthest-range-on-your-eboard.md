Ok so Im using a custom lipo 16ah 10s2p battery pack with a 60amp bms and managed to ride 34 miles today with 16% battery remaining. Just curious what everyone else is managing because Im honestly blown away at this range! I was riding conservative in my mind averaging around 20 mph without hills and light wind

Now that all the bugs are worked out with my latest build I couldn't be more pleased with the results. Anyone else running extended range batteries for 30 plus mile rides?

I've done 5 miles on my 600wH battery going about 6mph avg on a single 6355 and unshaven MBS wheels. Only used 5% battery. I suspect that if I kept going at that rate I could get nearly 50 miles. It would probably be the most boring and long ride of my life. 

Realistically I've done closer to 35miles with my battery averaging about 16-18mph on flat land.

haha I find it hard riding slower than 20 mph so 6mph would be torture! 35 miles is impressive. What was the reason you built such a long range pack and did you account for how much range you would have?

It was brutally painful, but I was riding with my s/o, who was on my old acton blink lite. Shes also fairly new at skateboarding so she takes it reeeeally slow. 

I decided on the pack when I was riding a liftboard dual. IIRC, it has a 7s3p battery with 2200maH cells, around 170wH. At the time, I was riding in the upper end of its limits, 15-18mph. I was only getting around 7miles before the battery died. The board was advertised at 15 miles. At this time, I was not aware of calculations to calculate battery capacity, I was naive and assumed that I should calculate a 50% yield on any advertised claim of range. I found that a 550ish wH battery would give me an advertised range of 30 miles. I said great, 15 miles at 50% would be what I deem acceptable and pulled the trigger. 

Now I sit here with a huge battery that I'm never able to deplete (I charge it once a week and ride ~5miles a day), let alone ride with someone else who has that kind of range, and that takes nearly all night to charge with a 2A charger. But hey, I'm not complaining :)

What ?? 10s2p and 34miles range ??? how's that possible ..i have 10s4p LG HG2 - 430wh pack ...and max I could go 20-25 miles ..sometimes even less than 20miles If I hit 24-28mph too often with some hills. 

34miles on flats going 5mph ? :slight_smile:

My mistake was 10s4p ..I have it split in 5 modular packs so I can bring on flights with me ..but now I'd go with 12s5p with each pack being max 99wh, so 500wh in total. I found out that to ride comfortably ..you need around 12-14miles ..anything more is luxury ..but it is great luxury :slight_smile:

Dang that's a lot of range! I've only got 6S 5000mAh and my board is still very new and untested so I can't claim any particular range, but it'll be paltry compared to 30+ miles! Once my caliber trucks arrive and when I buy some 83 or 90mm wheels (63mm is waaay too tiny) I'll be able to do some proper range tests.

Anyway my current setup is dual 190kv  on 10s3p with LG HG2 packs. I average around 19-23miles depending on how fast I'm cruising. I'll get around 23 cruising about 15mph, and when I'm carving hard at 25-30 I get about 19miles.

Keep in mind I'm about 8.5 stones... Or 127lbs

Never did a range test but the build I had was a 10s4P with a single 6374. It used 30% battery after 8 miles averaging 21 mph (I only ride about 18mph to be safe). So that would be roughly 26 miles on mostly flats and a few slight inclines before depleting.

Not sure what kind of range I am going to get but i am running 12s 2p (16000mah) for a total of almost 700WH 

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-6s-16000mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html

these are the packs, I only bought them because they were Â£22 off else i would have got the 12000mah ones 
(I cannot deny 4ah more capacity for free)
the only problem that i face is probably trying to make them fit (i was original planning for a drift trike powered by an old car alternator "spoiler its a 3 phase permanent magnet generator AKA a BLDC motor with a 3 phase rectifier)
if anyone wants to see said drift trike let me know because i am still thinking about doing it but i just need the motivation :laughing:

I am gonna say that its a fair few miles on a Esk8 mostly cos i have no hills near me and i have a tiny motor

Yes. My standard packs now are a 12S5P Samsung INR18650-30Q packs that do 12S at 645 watt hours. That will get you about 35 miles on a fresh, fully charged pack while keeping it under 20mph. My pack is 6 months old and is still getting over 30 miles.

We regularly do a 25-ish mile loop and we don't do it slow. I'm usually hauling ass the entire time. Range isn't just determined by pack size, you can also maximize range by riding the board in its efficiency zone. Slow doesn't translate to good range, efficiency does. Sometimes maintaining a higher speed is more efficient. On my boards it certainly is. I believe the same holds true for the new Raptors as well.

Hi, welcome to the forums. First things first is that you're probably gonna want close to a day of read time before you start ordering anything, these boards are pretty easy to screw up and lose a lot of money with.

@Alex built his board with lithium-polymer cells which aren't usually recommended on this forum due to their higher volatility compared to lithium-ion. That being said, they offer excellent performance per dollar and great current output at the cost of long-term reliability and fire safety. I happen to use some myself, so it definitely can be done. Generally, you create a LiPo battery by buying other battery packs (usually 2s or 3s) and wiring a harness to connect them in the config you need. In this way, you can remove the battery packs individually and balance charge them (necessary for LiPos) or disassmble the pack for flight

if you have any questions feel free to hit me up and ask!

Had issues myself with the multi-star pack but could put it on user error with me setting the voltage cut offs too low for those cells.  That said I feel like there isn't much room for heat dissipation with so many big cells stacked up like that so could see how it would be more of an issue in hilly areas or with bigger people too.  I don't typically pull more than 10A from my battery since I'm in a pretty ideal scenario (small person on flat land).

I'm using (2) Multistar 6600mAh 6s lipo batteries wired in parallel (13,200mah total).  I'm averaging about 18 miles of range at the 80% consumption mark.  

With lipos, it can damage the longevity of the battery if you exceed 80% consumption, so I limit my rides to 12-18 mile runs to stay within that threshold.  Also, it should be noted that wiring your batteries in parallel doubles the c rating.  So a 10c battery becomes a 20c.

False. Itâ€™s still a 10c battery. You now just have double the capacity to draw from.

Sorry, I didn't intend to say that the single battery can now supply twice the c rating.  I agree that this is not true.  The first battery can only supply 10c and the second battery can also only supply 10c.  When they are placed in parallel it means the ESC can draw up to 20c from both batteries (as a system).

In general:
Parallel = double the amps
Series = double the voltage

I'm pretty sure it's still 10c... The capacity has doubled, so that 10c is now means you get 2x the current... but it's still 10c relative to the overall pack.

IE: samsung 30q = 3,000mah (3ah) with 15a discharge = 5c
10 samsung 30qs = 30,000mah (30ah) with 150a discharge = still 5c

c rating is relative to the capacity, c rating != amps

On my single motor board a 10s5000mah battery gets me about 16-18km with ease (could go further)

On my dual 12s5000mah I am currently at 3.7v after 17km and thatâ€™s with some pretty high speeds too

I have 12S5P samung 30Q. Dual 6355, I may get 40+ km in range. Has never gone so far that the battery level has become so low. Now, afterwards, I regret that I built such a large battery. It just gets clumsy and heavy. I think the 10S4P is good enough for my use!

Im about to have a 10s6p built for my board.
I might regret the weight but I'd like to be able to go on rides out around the lake and back

I'm running an 8S 25Ah (740wh) lipo pack on my EMTB and that only gives me about 18miles of range. I do tend to ride quite fast though, usually around 25-30mph and I also charge my lipos to 4.15V instead of 4.20. 
I'd say I get maybe 600wh of usable capacity out of my pack, which equates to about 32wh/mi considering a range of 18mi.

I built my pack with 10x zippy flightmax 4S 5000mAh lipos, and with a pack this large being rated at 20C continuous I hardly notice any voltage sag at all. I sometimes pull over 100 amps from the pack without issues. I love the acceleration!
