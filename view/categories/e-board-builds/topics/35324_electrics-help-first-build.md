Okay so.

I have a board, trucks, 83mm wheels all the mechanical stuff minus the cogs and belt (going with 15/36).

I'm wanting to go with a 245Kv motor, specifically this one https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-g160-brushless-outrunner-245kv-160-glow.html

with these battery's https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-2200mah-3s1p-30c.html?___store=en_us

however i'm not sure if they will match up. From what i've worked out that motor will burn out pretty quickly? I need some advice on the electrical side of things. Alternative solutions or options? Not wanting to spend a huge amount as it will probably only get used a few times a month.

Thanks in advance!

That will work if you run two of those 3s batteries in Series to make a 6s, because 3s is to low you don’t want that. And if your going to do anything above 6s you want a lower kv motor like 190 kv

I was hoping on running them in series but the total is 66A and the max for the motor is 60A? or have i missed something?!

Well here’s what I would recommend 
- switch your motor to a turnigy brushless outrunner sk3 (245kv)
- get 5000mah 3s lipos so you can have more range 

I run a 245kv motor with a 6s3p pack and have used for about 3 months and been fine

Motor ratings are best taken with a grain of salt. They're not like fuses, where if you go just a little bit over, they'll immediately die. For short periods, most motors can be run at 150-200% of their rating, and be just fine. That said, 6s 2200mah isn't much energy and will result in a pretty small range before you have to recharge them. I'd go with at least 4000mah, so either two 4000+mah 3s packs, or you could even get 4 of those ones you linked and make a 6s2p with a total of 4400mah.

right I've got the new motor and the closest batteries I could find are the "ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 20C" This works out with x 2 batteries at 24v 100A so will be more than i need!

Thank you!
