I've been running into overheating issues lately kicking in VESC's motor power limiting on longer trips during sunny days (UK, London).

As a first step designed a meshed motor end, but that had no observable affect on motor temperatures:

As a second step, designed motor fan, which seems to have solved all issues:

Appreciate that I've not done any rigorous testing, but sharing in case anyone else finds it useful: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2977003 and https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2977024

Higher gearing ratio should do the trick :slight_smile:
