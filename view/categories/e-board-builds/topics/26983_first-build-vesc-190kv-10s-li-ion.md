Build log:
After 1 day:

First I glued the li-ion together but soldering was not that easy. Then I saw @Viribus desing and I did this too. Because of the glue, I've damaged the cell's envelope, which I made with tape

Thats exactly how i did it with these battery holders ... u need to shrink wrap it and its done, batteries wouldnt loose connection caused by vibrations then.

Its way cheaper as a spot welder, and million times better as soldering cables directly on the cells.

Spotwelding by a guy of Nkon (netherlands) cost me +- 60euro
I chose those sleds because this makes it easier to replace a broken cell. 
Only the soldering and removing the insulation cost me very much time... I have also tested the connection between each cell...

Thats the problem with those cheap ebay mounts... Drill a bit into your truck, tap it and use longer grub screws to hold onto it. Be careful with those holders... Looks extremely dangerous to me.

What looks dangerous? The motor mount? I have drill a bit into the truck but i go use 2 component metal glue. But i have also ordered a hobbyking mount

I ended up buying some Caliber Trucks Cal II trucks and motor mount to go with it. I might try using some jb weld or some sort of epoxy to put it together as a side project for another board

I couldn't get my mount tight enough and even stripped the threads in the hole.  I got a slightly larger screw, made new threads, used a cheater bar on the allen wrench to tighten it, and JB Weld on the mount.  Hasn't moved since.

V2:
After using my longboard for a month, I came across some disadvantages. Of course it is my first board. A big disadvantage that I found was the weight of my board :confused:  (11kg). This is heavy for carrying. This weight was mainly due to the aluminum housing. I also found the housing too big. I also bought a cheap motor mount but it did not hold onto the trucks properly.

Because of this my decision was made: I am willing to spend money on my board again so that I have a perfect board to my wishes.

What have I done:
From the moment I saw the Hobbyking motor mounts, I immediately ordered one. I also had to change trucks for this mount. I chose the caliber trucks. This mount fits well on this.

For the housing I have chosen to draw a 3d housing and print it myself. My design is based on a boosted board, but a 10s4p pack fits in my case.
To build this pack I have purchased a spot welder myself. In the meantime, I make some advertising, I also build customized packs so if you want one. Let me know.
After I printed my economies, it was time to get started with my deck. I have the bottom of carbon tape. I would have preferred a real carbon deck, but unfortunately that did not allow my budget. In the top of my deck there are cables 10AWG provided for going from the battery side to the focbox.


I am almost at the end of my building process. I am currently waiting for my bolts and griptape and I still have to paint my battery casing.

I have taken very few pictures through the construction process.
Enjoy the photos from my work :wink:
