I'm currently doing research to begin my first eBoard build and I have a couple of questions. So I'm thinking of using two 3S 5200mAh 10C (20C Peak) 11.1V batteries and the r-spec motor from enertion. However I can't decide if I should put the batteries in series or in parallel. From what I understand, if I put the batteries in series, I would have an output voltage of 22.2V which would be enough to start the motor (14 - 44V Max) but would hinder its performance since the nominal output current for the battery is only 10C ( 10C x 5.2A = 52A and 2400W / 22.2V = 108A so the battery cannot output enough current). On the other hand, if I put them in parallel, I could output enough current ( 10C x 10.4A = 104A) but my output voltage (11.1V) would not be sufficient to start the motor (14 - 44V Max). The obvious solution to this problem would be to get more batteries and have two pairs of two batteries in series then connect them in parallel but that would increase the cost quite a bit so my main question is would it be possible to use this motor with just two batteries that I mentioned or do I HAVE to get more batteries to solve this issue. Thanks in advance.

Running 3s is a little low.  I'd recommend getting 3s 20c batteries an putting them in series.

Thanks for the reply, I have thought about that but when I went on hobbyking to look at batteries, I can't seem to find a 5000mAh 20C battery that has a TX60 connector which I need to use the VESC from enertion. Most of them come with 5.5mm bullet connectors but hobbyking doesn't sell 5.5mm bullet connector to TX60 adaptors. Is there a way to get around that or will I have to make my own adaptor? Thanks

No problem! Yes, you can just cut the connect off and solder on an XT60. I would not recommend this if you have never soldered before or have a small soldering iron.

Ok great, soldering is not really a problem for me so this solution should work out. I do have another question. What kind of range do you think putting two 5000mAh 20C batteries in series would give me ( I weigh 53 kg)? I want to be able to ride for at least 5km, would this setup be able to achieve this range? Thanks in advance.

I'm running 3x2s 5000mah in series to get 6s which is what you would be looking at minimum. I also run a 245kv single motor with 16-32t gearing which roughly I'm getting 9km out of a charge. This is mainly on flat ground with only a short up hill so depending on the terrain your running on will determine how far you will get.

Ok thanks for the suggestion. Would you say that 3x2s 5000mah is better than 2x3s 5000mah setup?

No wouldn't make any difference if they are same c rating. Just I run a drop through deck and needed to be as thin as I can. How much would two new 3s cost you as there are pre built options available.

From what I can see 2x3s 5000mah is going to be around 36 GBP and I will also have to buy TX60 connectors to solder them on which costs around 3 GBP. Can you link me to pre built options? Thank you

This is a prebuilt option but also double the mah with 10000mah so lot more but everything is done. Where in U.K. Are you.

I live in London. This looks really impressive but is considerably more expensive than what I had in mind. Thanks for the suggestion anyway. Speaking of which, what kind of charger do you use? I've been looking at this one http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__103697__HobbyKing_C3_50W_Charger_Discharger_AC_DC_UK_Plug_UK_Warehouse_.html which looks good enough but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Also are BMS necessary? If so will this one which seems to be both an indicator and a manager work ok ( http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=43590 ) ? Thanks in advance and sorry for the long question.

That charger seem OK similar to the bmax 6 ac that others use. As for bms it's not necessary if you are going to use one of these charger you just have to be carful with the voltage and not running them to low so my esc has a cutoff of 3.4v per cell so x6=20.4v and I now run a volt meter on my board. And as long as you balance charge them with that charger the levels should stay good.

Will get a link just on eBay 
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/331724469467 

The cutoff is what's been researched by a lot of people from Rc community, when the voltage drop to low they can get damaged and possibly catch fire which is why you need to take lots of care with lipo when discharging and charging.

I think you have some good suggestions and options already, but wanted to clarify the C rating of the batteries.  I wouldn't go below a 100a ability of the batteries (my minimum) as most are marketing from the company and totally unreliable and likely incorrect.  So an example is the 3s 5000mAh 20c (20c * 5Ah = 100a).  The better they can provide, or the more in parallel to lessen the load - the less voltage sag - and if you don't heavily draw (=heat) the batteries they will also last longer.

I also recommend DIY w/ two 3s for 6s.  I usually get the thinnest (C dimensions on HK) batteries i can find - and with only 3s you can get some super thin ones around 20-25mm.  Nice and stealthy!

Cutoff voltage - i set mine to 3.6v because with a little bit of sag you can pull them lower and i don't want to damage my cells.  Also get a lipo alarm to yell when you hit that voltage - vs just relying on the ESC to let you know, or by feel.

GL!

If you could get 30c is the ideal and what I run and have no issues but I am looking to upgrade and get that pre build 10000mah or find some decently prices 3s 10000mah to get more mileage as get 6 miles at the moment but would love more.

I read through the post quickly so I might have missed it but did anyone mention that you'll need some sort of anti spark solution?
And I would recommend that you get the highest C rating you can. It really makes a difference in performance and range using 60c packs over 20c
It might seem like over kill but really it's not. 
Even with a 300a battery, there will be some voltage drop under load.

I thought the C rating just determines highest discharge rate of the battery and it depends on the motor to pull the necessary current from the battery? I might be wrong since I'm new at this.

You are correct. The motor draws the current. 
If your using a standard RC Esc, the throttle controls the amount of voltage supplied to the motor and the amount of current will be determined by the amount of load placed on the motor.
If your using a Vesc in current control mode, full voltage is supplied constantly while the Vesc limits the amount of current the motor can draw. 
More throttle=more current. 
Now, you are also correct concerning the C rating of the battery. The C rating X mah = max constant discharge rate. 
There is however one other important factor. That is Voltage sag. The more current you draw from the battery and the closer you get to the max discharge rate, the more the voltage drops. Reducing power and range.
The reduction of range is a factor that I have just recently discovered testing various batteries on flat and hilly conditions. And the science to back it up is this. Voltage X Capacity /G = Range
The value of G was 22 with my 145kv hub motors
The value of G was 18 with my 230kv belt drive with 16/36 gears
So as your voltage drops, your range is decreased.
This is why you want your max discharge rate to be as high as you can get it.
There are two ways to achieve this.
Some have used multi rotor packs with very high capacity and low C rating.
I chose lower capacity with very high C rating. 5000mah X 60c for 300a discharge rate.
Higher C rated Lipos tend to have lower internal resistance which makes them more efficient and less prone to heat.

Great post @Namasaki!  @r0ymanesco - listen to what he's saying here.  If you look at some of the battery tests (mooch is amazing for these) you can see the voltage sag he mentions.

The big impact to range on sag is both heat and reduced battery capacity (you get less than the claimed xxxxmAh's).

here's a good example:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/dfXpV5Q.png[/img]
It's a LOT of squiggly lines... but the things to look at are the big "sag" on the far left as you try to pull more and more amps from this 18650 - and the corresponding poor capacity ( 1000mAh capacity @ 20a discharge of a 3100mAh cell!) when you pull too much amps from a cell.  This is an extreme example, but really illustrates performance at different discharge rates.  The heavier you draw a cell the more heat it generates - losing energy to heat is likely a huge reason for the poor capacity.

HTH!

I use these 2s packs in series. Its a simple setup and keeps the battery low profile.
For 6s you would only need 3 and you could charge them all at once with a 6s balance charger or put more in series and use an onboard BMS as I did and charge with a laptop charger.

If you want to run 6s it is recommended to not use a Vesc because of high current. This is what I've heard, I haven't personally tried a Vesc with less than 10s. 
As for the battery, get something that will handle high current and yield long range like this:
