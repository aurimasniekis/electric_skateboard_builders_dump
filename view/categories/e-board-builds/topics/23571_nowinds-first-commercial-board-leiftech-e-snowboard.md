Thought about a really long time...
Was not that happy to buy something RTR, normally building stuff by myself

Last impuls i needet was @okp last video from his progression on his Leif 
Awesome Bro, you got my biggest respect for this!

 Got my hands on a nearly brand new Leif, it was sold by a guy who dont get on with it/ short on time...
Anyways i shoot the bullet and it arrived on Thursday :sunglasses:

Dont mounted the Freeboard bindings actually, better for getting on with it... easier to jump off :wink:

Yeah what should i say... i expected that it gets hard to get on with it!
 But it was harder in the end that i thouht :kissing_closed_eyes:

The first Battery felt like balancing on a piece of soap...

After the third Battery i get an idea of it..
Man this thing ROCKZ as hell, totally felt in love with this multi directional drif and sliding machine :heart_eyes:

What i dont liked from beginning was the fact that the countersunk screws arent sitting in a countersunk :sweat: just screws flat on the Top, looking out of the Deck really ugly

The bigger ones on the left i already sunked at this point from mine... no big deal but dont know why it should be done by the customer ...

Battery Number 5 :

One bearing killed by driving... replaced fast with parts of my Fibretech longboard

Battery 7:
Got some bad noise from the Drivetrain... one of the tiny HTD3 Belt was dead

228mm length belt in this size are not available at my known sources in Germany....
Ordered some 225mm ones from "mädler" right now
Starting in my kitesurf holidays on the eastsea tomorrow, ordered the belts to the camping place :kissing_closed_eyes:

Hope for a direct fit of the slightly shorter Belts to get on this amazing board again really quick :yum:

Let me say again this Leiftech e-Snowboard brings a BIG FAT grine to your face :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Freebording is super tricky at first but you'll just suddenly "click", kinda like riding a bicycle. Having the bindings on will also make it much easier. You need them for fine edge control.

Here's a great intro tutorial that helped me a ton:

Nice review. I've wanted one of these since I first saw them. I'm surprised (and not surprised) that you broke things in such short order, but at least they're easily fixable mechanical items and not electrical. I'll be curious to see how this board holds up for you over the long term. 

I'm picking up a used Freebord this weekend, so starting slow and unpowered might be a good idea. I'm also toying with the idea of hooking up a tow rope to my drift trike and having my daughter tow me around.

Oh, and I'll start saving my money for the soon to be released
E-Toxx (LEif-Toxx™) "All-Terrain Motorized Caster"™ Drive System
aka,
"A-ToMiC Drive"™ System
aka,
"E.T.'s AToMiC Propulsion System"™
aka,
"E.T.'s AToMiC Power System"™

or whatever @nowind wants to call it. (I hope) :wink: 

I'm thinking tank treads or something like MBS AT 100mm wheels for the caster wheels and little pneumatic wheels (@psychotiller?) for the outrigger wheels. Would this even be possible?

Hey Guys, 
sorry for late reply.... chilling in my holidays and have really bad internet connection

Yeah i will do from now on more regulary.
What do you have modified? I saw you made an new and nice CF Lid, anything else?
Did you have a thread on your esk8.fr ?

HaHa great names buddy, but this shit is patented from Leiftech.... but great idea anyways!

In the meanwhile my replacement belts arrive on my campingplace :smile:

Its a direct fit without problems, the 3mm shorter length then stock is no problem.

Have to tighten the setscrew from the wheelpulley, this one is NOT metric its imperial :

No Wind (-;
No Hill 
No Problem :sunglasses:

Got some smaller issues with the Leiftech, recognized two cutoffs then the board dont power on anymore.
Demount the upper case, i really recoment any kind of mini ratchet tool for this because they are not good to reach : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/3/8319027bb2ac1e604b1305ec7da7600caad33204.JPG" width="690" height="388">

This is the main PCB : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/2/d21377f6f99a1f7a106f6f79a64ee7c125293195.JPG" width="281" height="500">

Here you see also the Batterie indicator and the switch : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/8/083eb59e6732435c98d17f530cc7772d8d22c296.JPG" width="690" height="388">

the reason for not powering on was a loose connector from the switch... all of theese connectors are on the loose side, used some ducttape for secure them

Here you see that the Battery cover startet to worn out really quick, the plastic is not tough : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/a/eab15ee0148bcf66c98add46cb308c06c5e0a455.JPG" width="281" height="500">

also here on the corners :

Next issue was the remote, had a wipeout and crashed the remote into ground (-;
The button gets damaged :

The little round metal piece on top is pressed by a plastic part wich was destroyed, take it apart and using now a 3mm Hexdriver for switching :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

But what i do if the next time i break the remote complete?
This is a problem with this "closed setups"... dont wanna spend 99$ on a new one ..
What you guys think, is there another BT remote which maybe work with the Leif ?

```
For you battery cover issue, you have to increase pressure between the battery cover clip and the bottom cover. Apply some heat with a hair dryer or something to avoid snapping the plastic.

Got u a spare enclosure, you would like to sell??? 
Love your work on this.

What for aluminium blocks you meant, the heatsinks?
Bulky ones for sure.

You know whats the problem that i cant change to 2.4GHZ, my remotes on the eMTB´s are like belts (-; something you have to replace regulary :smiling_imp: 
Thats all... if i can get the BT one for lower price then 99$ i would buy it... but for a little remote thats waaay to much IMO

After investing 3 batterys yesterday in mainly riding switch i mounted today the Bindings.

Man thats great after a week without to feel the more control through the Bindings.
I love this sliding stuff so much, really felt in love with my Leif :heart_eyes:

Also after heavy coning of the outer wheels i turned them around

Already orderd the Freebord dablues for replacement, thank @okp for pointing them out.

Little destroying on the Beltcover :

Be aware everything which is higher then aound 2cm will get in the way of the motors and drivesystem... you really have to take care !

Realized that the used setscrews on the motorpulley is to long ...

This will not be your belt longlife new friends (-;
Shitty imperial screws i got no driver for... will remove later and mounting new pulleys with metric treads

Battery is nearly full again, i have to go riding :imp:
Hang Loose

I'm loving the in depth reviews. I know the tech is patented by Leiftech, but now that you know its limitations, could you design a modified motor mount or direct drive system that uses larger caster wheels, like 100mm+ and provides more clearance? Maybe for some light, smooth dirty path riding? That's what I was proposing earlier. I wouldn't think upgraded, aftermarket motor mounts would infringe on their patent.

Haha yeah as you can imagine i´m thinking of alot of mods (-;
Really not know whats patented but as long as you dont sell it ... 

Next step is a upgrade to Vesc and Lipo Batteries and 2.4Ghz Remote

Would be very interrested in the possible Voltage for theese Sliprings ???
I think that a bit more voltage and a shorter gearing could increase the startup performance...

If i dont mentioned it : you have to do a push start, the cogging without is too bad

What i not know is if its possible to put more voltage and or amps through the slip rings
i dont got a clue

Haha is it possible to look into this info when u take a look at the patent? How other folks can possibly know then that they are not building same system if all details are not dialed in?

Im also very curious.about.their slip.ring system but as far as i know.other.companies are also.using it.elsewhere.not.just.for esk8 purposes

Yes that makes sense (-;
Where we can see this patent?

Have a closeup look to the sliprings :

Here the motorwires go into the sliprings, dont open it more for now... i guess you have to press out the rings to see the soldering of the phase wires... dont want to destroy anything, still in my holidays :

New Problems :confounded: 
Loosing BT connection often.... somethimes i can run only 30 seconds until the connection drops...
Looked for loose connection again on the main PCB but dont find anything...
BUT i found out that the "MainSwitch" can hit the FET´s :

What you see there are the heads of the phillips screws which hold the wires to the switch... see also the dust from this... WTF???

Removed the screws and soldered it direct... maybe i step on the enclosure by an bailout or anything ... but this should not be happen IMO... 

After swapping around the outer wheels after heavy coning the are now coned again in the opposite direction :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Do you see the cuts??? Not ride through glass... just normal concrete...

This is really fucking me up actually.... i need replacement parts from US from Leiftech... how could this happen after 10 Days riding this board??

Glued it with Loctide stuff... hope it holds up a bit :angry:

to be honest.. a lot of circuits look like they are completely made in china, for cheap :slight_smile:

Mh didnt find much text info, only a few schematics, one of them:

So does your motor system have tensioner too? Didnt see where it is located then mhh

at least i suspect it is a tensioner.

tbh, I never ever adjusted my belt tension - initially my belts run a little loose, at the end of a belts life its medium loose, either way Im not skipping teeth and not wasting much energy into the belt (doesnt get hot, if you tighten it too much, a belt will actually get quite hot).

Yes but at least if the belt skips, its to less tension.
In generall with a roller/tensioner you need less overall tension because more teeth are in mesh.

I would like to add a little tensioner and made some small mods to the mount itself. 
For example add some material in the area where the Motor sits... that way the motor would not look like this after 10 days :

Get the original Freebord DaBlues today... got not enough washers have to add some spacer
Love the look of them...

They perform very nice.
Happy that my glued centerwheels holds up good.

Btw the original outer wheels have lost 20mm in diameter, at this point they dont perform any good

Nice belt :) =)

Do you have a theory in which situations this happens?

The same thing happened to my belt actually.. some jackass to which I gave to try my board was punishing the drivetrain hard, when the motor could not start moving the board..

After a while I saw that a section of a belt teeth have separated from the main line of belt.. but it was still going for a while.. Only problem was 'clicking noise''.

Anyways - Do you experience teeth skipping on this ? It does look like the motor pulley is quite big in comparison but the htd3 profile teeth does not give much confidence :) especially, if belt happens to be a bit more loose.. Even though, you theoretically already installed shorter belt than original, right?

Hah ok sorry for the long text but im really enjoying that you show such technical details from which everyone can learn a bit

Well, I think there should be a "NoWind Approved" Seal for eSk8s. I doubt there would be many qualified.

Awesome to see how you ruin something and then make it better.
From the looks of the sliprings i dont think they can handle more Amps.
The Airgap looks large enough to up the Voltage a bit.

And if not, that will add to the burn theme you are going with lately.

I have encountered this type of belt failure. The motor has exceeded the power rating of the belt. Using 3M belts are fine but the gear ratio use is causing a lot of problems to have faster than normal belt wear. Even with the wider pulleys, I see.

I guess it starts in the middle where the grubscrew is exposed from the tooth profile on the Motorpulley.
Also the motorpulley teeth looking "roundet", seems they weared out.
In generall its a super small profile, that cant take much abuse.

Thanks for your thoughts.
I think this way too, more voltage ok but not too much amps.
Maybe i will try to reduce gearratio to 12/40 (14/40-original) and step to 8 or 9S Lipo.

Started to do first tests with standart Freebord Centerwheels.
More then one reason for it:
1- you have to order replacement in US
2- the PU quality is not the best IMO, have had lot of deep cuts i needet to glue
3- the used driveshaft is out of tolerances for a bearing seat : 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/5/652294e3fb266f9b28c115de7d32fa49ee757525.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Nearly 3/10mm under ? Serious ???

So this are the replaced  Centerwheels :

This are the Boro 72mm upgrade wheels from Freebord.
How i mount them excactly is no big deal, once it turned out that it hold up i will tell in detail!

Here you see that i also placed some spacers between the casters to prevent deforming by tighten down the screws... seen this on the Leiftech forum... thx to the unknown poster :relieved:

The original pulley had lost about 1.5mm in diameter ... totally fucked up
The new one is from Mädler.de ... little longer hub but i dont care

Just glued to Motorshaft with Loctide 638

Here we go with :slight_smile:
New Driveshaft
New Centerwheels 
Fresh bearings 
New Motorpulley
New Belts

Hey Guys,

Wanna show here a solution for using original Freeboard Centerwheels on the Leiftech.
This is kind of Beta testing which means that its no aproved mod for thousends of kilometers.
Done this 1 week ago, shred 20 batteries and it seems to work very nice in most details.

This is what i´m talking about :

The principle is simple, BUT it needs some good machines IMO to get the needet precision.
So i will sale this wheels for interrested people you cant DIJ ... Parts are ready and can shipped tomorrow (-:

Starting with cutting a Driveshaft from Silver Steel Material Nr. 1.2210 (115CrV3) :

Drilling a 3.1mm hole at 28mm in the middle of the shaft,
through this hole later a hardened steel bolt will go through and connect the hub and the shaft  :

Adding a milled slot for a Keyway to easier mounting a Wheelpulley.

Dont worry if you got no Keyway in your Pulley ... Loctide only with hold up by propper use... for sure
It can removed only with heat... but it is removable
Clean the parts before glueing with Brakecleaner, add the Loctide, turn the pulley around move for and back, let it sit several hours, best over night, make sure to remove remaining Loctide.

I got also some Loctide here which i can send with the Parts if you dont know where to buy.

Hi. This is my first post here, enchanted to meet you all. I've ridden my leiftech board for 15 days now and had to glue my center wheels yesterday night for the first time so I think i'm gonna be one of your first client for these, cheaper than buying all these tools an materials I figure... 
Just a few questions : 
- Do you notice the loss of rocker with the Boros? The board should be 3 mm lower with these than with the stock wheels I believe.
- How are the Labeda wheels vs the Boros? I've seen reviews claiming they are super durable and 76 mm should mean more rockers but how do they feel?
- What are these bearings you use? they are useless except to stabilize the axle, so any old dead bearing would do right? 
- Won't the hole in the urethane weaken the wheel? should we try to fill it with some hardening stuff?
- Will the stock wheel pulley work with these?
```

Thanks man, happy that you like it :kissing_smiling_eyes:

Hey @philvanzu 
Nice that you chime in.

Rocker is the same, i meassure my used Leif Centers with 71mm the Boros about 72mm

Dont tested the Labedas yet, yes they got more rocker, yes they are harder for sure so i guess they are less comfortable but will last longer

The Bearings are stock, what comes with the wheels, no bearing function as you said... only to center the driveshaft... you can use old ones of course

Yeah the hole will weaken it for sure, the question is if this will be noticable... it also weaken the driveshaft ... but it seems that its still ok... OK i dont jumping actually, but i´m also known not being lovely to my toys :relaxed:
On the protos i dont glued the shaft to the pin, dont addet any superglue... i screwed a Setscrew in the drilled hole... but this always tend to get loose and one time you hear a knocking noise you have to stamp it in again... was not so nice
Now i hope the glue will work, also the undersized bore in the hub will pressfit it ( dont done this on protos)

Yeah stock pulleys work. I got the old ones... do you got the newer "d-type" ones?

Cheers

Yes I think I have the D-type ones. the Board was ordered in february, delivered in march with a faulty battery pack, so I had to wait till april for the replacement to arrive, then I broke my wrist on day 2, had a cast for 2 months and now I can finally ride every day.

I haven't removed the wheel pulley yet and I hear it's hard work for which I'm not sure I have all the tools, so I won't be able to provide measurements right away.

I do have a 3/32" bondhus allen key (is that solid enough? no idea) and a cheap soldering Iron I bought decades ago, which might or might not be hot enough to melt the 3M TL42 thread locker but I wont know until I try, And I will only try when I have ample time to run to a shop to find the right tools if I need them.

@philvanzu
you can also use a torch to heat up the pulley for easier screw removing :wink:
About the tool size, they changed from imperial to metric on one point :anguished:
Dont know what you have, mine was 0.93 imperial

Some pictures and tips of mounting Parts : 

Remove the 2 M5 Srcews and take the Caster apart : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/3/339935244eccf1fa8e6e0b5e0f53c264bbed0918.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Take the new Centerwheel and add 5 Speedrings per side : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/1/1190c8c33fd7ed6cb639a9442eb2da8497fcccc9.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Add new Bearings on both sides, you also see the simple spacers to prevent deforming the mount by tighten down... Aluminium Tube about 28.5mm long 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/f/0fc01e394fbcc516c177e07fed764047c90bc32d.JPG" width="666" height="500">

For easy mounting i take other M5 screws and stick them in from the otherside, this way the spacers stay in place
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/e/1e5f762f54348fa6e0b7e99c6b59f5ab6de5e7a4.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Once you placed the Centerwheel you can place the normal M5 screws from the other side and tighten it down
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/0/304cca9456063047dc25878e589e0836b273e52d.JPG" width="666" height="500">
Check for free spinning of the centerwheels ! MAke sure you dont tighten them until they lock :confused:

Place a Key in the Slot and slide the wheelpulley on, should be around equal with the end of the Driveshaft : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/2/42f2f9556f43b612f3fbb34855803dd17abbc1b7.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Secure it with the grubscrew, use some medium Loctide to secure the screw.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/9/c9b73e2d2f5d6aaeb1a7ac23d47bf409bf78fa74.JPG" width="666" height="500">


Place Belt like this : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/c/dc7dd0df083603edf0ef986505ce45c2278a8b0b.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Turn the wheel until the belt is completly in place : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/b/0bcdf72975b08d2f9b69e3a4ad0694b9bdee7ab5.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Ready for Shredding

ONE MORE THING : 
Because this is a new project and i got no longtherm expierences i advice you to do the following : 
 
Take a 2mm Hexdriver or anything else which fits in the drilled hole of the new Centerwheel,
stick it in complete, mark with tape the depth : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/c/dc6b8d85916b8567289213e2f11d264f5000c28d.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Take this "meassure tool" with you and check from time to time if everything is still in place
I doubt that the pins will move, but this way you make sure that you will know about if they do

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/4/b44a2982db45799af0bd0dca3c02332e67a8c661.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Hope you know what i mean.

Some Updates :slight_smile:

Good : 
The new pulleys are really good for Belt lifetime.
About 20-25 batteries without one dead belt, before it was maybe 5-10 Batteries.
Running without Beltcovers seems not to be a problem too...

Bad : 
Got some really bad sound, sounds like bearings... only bearings left which where not replaced were the motorbearings... take them apart and see that the bearing is ok but the Motorshaft is "dead" :

Okay :kissing_smiling_eyes:
Got no replacement for it because the end of the shaft is thicker then 6mm... fast ghetto mod : 
Pushed the shaft more in about 5mm so that the shitty part dont sit where the bearing is :laughing:

I really need this one. The aluminium of my center wheel was broken, I have repaired it but now the rubber section too. I have order several replacement from Leif a month ago and they still did not process my order yet.

Can I use this one directly ? Just change the center wheel

.. if you got the normal old pulley style without D-Shaft it should be a direct fit.
Just glue your Pulley as descriped to the new driveshaft.

send me an email with your shipping adress and paypal adress, i will send you a request
jens@e-toxx.com

btw ... got now also new Motorpulley 38€ for the pair...

Hey I'm modding my Leif too. Do you know if the sensor connector coming out of the front slip ring could have any use in a dual VESC setup? This is not the same thing as sensored motors is it?

I'm also Junked by the idea of having a Leif-Style-Board.

Is there any alternative to the Leif system that you could buy in Parts ?
cause for me its clear that i wanna use my VESC's and Remotes and my Battery setup.

So i'd actually just need the two turnable Motor Drives ?

I'm considering buying a used V1 with a couple of batteries and a broken pulley cover. I'd like to work on it myself and was going to ask if 1.) you'd be making more of the wheels since I don't have access to a machine shop anymore and 2.) if the board has kept up in your rotation of esk8s. 

It sounds like #2 is answered and #1 would be a potential in the future. So now I want to ask: do you feel the work was worth it to improve upon the board? I'm curious if the folks at leiftech would send you a V2 to see how it mocks up but I'm kind of excited to make a few hands on improvements myself.

Hey
Fact is i love the Riding Expierence... Amazing 

For me V1 was okay because i can build most stuff by myself... i was not aware of all bugs ... what i saw on the Leif Forum was a lack of support for customers with same problems as mine... 

a regular customer run into serios problems when you dont get spares...

Read the whole thread here brother....  there where many problems 
I think Boro Wheels and Vesc Upgrade is biggest Improvement and best for fast progression

If you like to fix things by yourself take the V1... dont know what the V2 has fixxed... 

To be honest i think best would be someone offers this Slipring System with attached Casterwheels.... this way you could upgrade a regular Freebord direct....

This is really, really cool.  For one, the mayhem you've wrought on this board through sheer riding is impressive in it's own right.  The fact that you replaced virtually everything but the motors is pretty astonishing.

Knowing what you do now, would you have started with a freebord and figured out motors, or would you still have bought the leif as a base to work from?  I have zero electrical/engineering experience, but this looks like something I could dive into and would be a fun project.

If you're set to go that way, you need to combine a swivel plate / fork or whatever this thing is called

with a pancake 3 tracks slipring ready for adequate amperage of the motor phases.
https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/pancake-slip-ring.jpg

There's not much more to it; a bit of mechanical smarts to cnc a motor / caster wheel mount that you can attach to the fork and you're pretty much gold.

I got Leiftech board and I think I throw it off the driveway more then ride it now. Having gravel and uneven ground it’s no fun. 

I actually have Blink S2, Blink lite, boosted board 2, Quattro ACTON supposed to be here tomorrow and my kids have electric boards. The Leiftech is the only I bounced off ground. I have to push it like my longboard even though it has motor, it is horrible on any gravel just won’t go, will not go uphill and they sent me directions for previous board which only added to frustration with this. 

How are you guys actually using these boards? Maybe it’s my size but this will not climb hills. I’m 6’1 280lbs. Where are you guys riding this board? Sorry for frustration but this board is killing me. Love snowboarding so I got it.

Juice keep trying. It is very frustrating the first time. I just did my first mile today without bouncing off the board. 

I recommend to watch YouTube Videos where they teach how to ride regular freeboards without motors. 

My weight is about 200lbs and I’m 5.9ft. 

First I tried with very tied trucks, then I turned them soft. Also try to push the power button twice, to turn the miyagi mode on. 

That mode gives you more control and less speed.

Well for all the (poor) folks like me that dreams about Leiftech, I've had a really short chat with I suppose was Aaron (the inventor/CEO), and there's no way of producing the center wheel system, they won't allow it.
Because I'm like that, I've read all their patents (instead of studying, I know, bad bad dobby !), and they've seem like they covered pretty much all the possibility, which means there's no way someone could sell that, protecting himself by being in a juridical blur about the patent...

But, I will still go for it and try and do my DIY leiftech, but sadly we won't be able to have kits made by our community geniuses...

Here we go with this guys : 

1 set for : @DavidC @BigBrit @Balta_6 
2 sets for @RookieTwo @Lionzion

We have to discuss design and price.

First Batch i made without "D-Shape" uses Keyway instead , this requires new Wheelpulleys.
The reason for me was that i have had fist gen Leiftech without D-Shape!
If everyone have D-Shape Wheelpulleys its the better/cheaper way to made this second Batch with D-Shape so you can use your excisting leiftech wheelpulleys
If we wanna go this way one of you have to send me an d-shape wheelpulley for correct fitment!

D-Shape Driveshaft, on Boro Centerwheels, One PAIR for doing ONE complete Board 
80€ NON EU Price
95€ EU Price
Shipping : 
NON EU 38€
EU 18€
DE 7€

Time for production 4 Weeks after Payment.
my paypal : jens@e-toxx.com
please write your Username/ Alias and shipping adress in comment section.

Let me know what you think.

If i remember correct he told me that he needs to retro fit my D-Shape to fit his pulleys.
I would like to make sure that it fit straight out of the box....

I checked leiftech, dont see d-shape pulleys for sale !
If no one wanna give away their pulleys( i understand (-; ) 
But if you get parts wich dont fit you will not be happy

Hi everyone,

they do sell them for 20$ : https://leiftech.com/products/d-shaft-drive-wheel-pulleys. 
Shipping cost to Germany is $45.68 USD so all together 65,68 $.

I you guys agree, we could split the cost (maybe by giving Nowind another 10$ each) and that way making  sure of having a fitting set of wheels for V2

what do you say ?

If the parcel is more expensive, we could of course share the added cost.

Still in, will transfer you the money soon, winter break has come by...
We still have this pulley problem though, but is it really necessary ? We could send precise measuring, if we have different data to compare, we could make the fit near perfect, and the whole thing is not a precision object, doesn't need a low tolerance

Ok @Nowind I took my pulley apart and drew up some dimensions.  these were measured with a pair of digital calipers. The measurement is from the edge of the metal wheel housing to the edge of the shaft like this
![leiftech%20pulley|690x335](upload://1eHpQBpC5yzgPTqpzjy3S3p1jRf.jpeg) 

Here are the dimensions

![leiftech%20pulley%20shaft%20drawing|690x490](upload://sOMBPI8Mu6oRqU1VjGhQSVoxtDw.png)

I just realised I didnt reference the diameter of the shaft, which is obviously 8mm

Hey guys I just purchased my Leif but I’m in Australia so waiting for shipping. I’m interested in what battery upgrades people have done? I’ve read these run a 24volt AC system. I’m a bit of a noob when it comes to the battery side of things but can it be converted over to a dc system? Or has anyone been able to switch to LiPo batteries or would it require a full motor esc conversion?

7S LifePO4 equals to 6S LiPo

No need for changing the ESCs if you switch LifePO4 to Lipo, at the condition voltage remains the same

@BigBrit
Thank you Sir.
Great Technical Drawing my friend.
Perfect.

BUT :slight_smile:
This puncture where the clip sits cant produce by myself.
(I can ask for external manufactoring but this will rise the price IMO)
I was not aware that this is actually the version they sold.
Mine wheelpulley has a setscrew....

Mine also has a set screw as well as the circlip.  Perhaps the circlip notch is not required

Also no problems on the drawing, you need someting to go on

Hi @Nowinds ,
I think we had a little miscommunication in our emails:
-You sent me a quote for 2 pairs 
-I replied I wanted one pair( cf this thread i had changed my mind) and I have not made the payment yet.
I am waiting for the one pair paypal quote to send you the money.
Peace out bro!

For the technical point of view we dont need the circlips with loctite and grubscrew :slight_smile: )

I know nothing about working with VESC, but I came off my leiftech board on the weekend and it went over the edge of a small foot bridge and into the water. Scooped it out pretty quick but looks like it has cooked the pcb. How hard is it to swap over to a VESC system for an absolute rookie? I've heard people talking about programming the settings on them, what programs do I use, what are the rookie mistakes to avoid etc

Vesc are being talked about here a lot, so I would advice you to read a little, you're answer will soon arrive and you'll be able to see all the settings you want

What do you think about converting a freebord to a lieftech?

I found this cheap freeboard missing only the casters (that I would be replacing with my own belt drive ones anyway)
![Screenshot_20191023-161439_OfferUp|281x500](upload://mY7JENG2iBhH7YCpzlAJM6Cz4IM.jpeg) 

Might try to make my own slip rings... Or maybe just try to use the wind turbine ones and have them sticking up out of the deck 2" right in the way of my feet. :grimacing:
```

I really thought about that but at the end the hassle is not worth it
Small slipring made for turbine are too high, won't fit below the deck, you will need to make them poke out and that will make the ride impossible
and pancake slipring are not made to go at ~30A, and custom ones (I asked different company) fall under the price of 170/200 $ per piece... so not worth it when you can get the whole drive thing fr 150$ each at leiftech (they were selling some old stock), with motor and everything

Okay guies digging the subject, how much rocker do you recommend with @Nowind 's wheels ? 
I only have 1.5cm if I take the small freebord wheels (72mm)
And at what height does your bord sit ? from ground to top of the deck ? Mine's 12.5cm which is already huge for me, that's why I won't rise the center wheels anymore

Thanks for the reply! 
Cool to hear someone else gave this a thought, sad you hear you don't think it's feasible.

The surplus lieftech parts sounds really cool, I pulled the trigger on the used freebord. For $45 it was a steal.
