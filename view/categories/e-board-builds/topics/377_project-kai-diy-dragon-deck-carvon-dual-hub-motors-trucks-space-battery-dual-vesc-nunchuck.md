```
my first build of a longboard and e board. will update as i go.

So i started with high density foam for my mold and press with vacuum bag. i used 1/16 canadian maple veneers and a roarockit bag. i went with 6 plys.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/c686f4897813b239c79fe9b3cf2b220df9a42fde.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/c4873b0389ab2de23256b204680d7430a83768d6.jpg" width="690" height="388">

cut it out with a jigsaw and sanded the edges by hand with 90 grit sand paper. i should have followed my lines better cause it took forever to sand it down by hand.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/51540ad7b2ece55e17e1550223502c168d39fa23.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/e40abb68344934bd91a2ff4bb6664ae7a4b51f40.jpg" width="690" height="388">

drilling the holes right took me forever cause i don't have a printer to print out a template haha. so i measured it with centerline of the board and it took me like 30 min erasing and starting over but i did get it pretty good. it rolls straight. jumping up and down on it and it was way to flexible with 6 plys of maple. roll around the block and it was cool. had those extra set of paris trucks and venom wheels sitting around.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/61337c515928cac354c3264da534ffc8f9beaf59.jpg" width="690" height="388">

so i decided to add a design using fabric from the fabric store since i don't have a printer like i said earlier. found a pretty cool print and i also decided to add fiberglass since it was way to flexible. worried it might break or cause problems with mounting stuff underneath of it.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/5d343dfac15c7d39c1b2577bbcd19f4004e32f2c.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/b9bc293a8f8be006de80b9ed23821a58f996918b.jpg" width="690" height="388">

i thought it looked pretty sweet being my first attempt so i decided to do the top of the board the same way.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/b647abd94e4cdfa625ad48ad66ca2d39e5ed3fae.jpg" width="690" height="388">
so that is where i am at now. my plan for the electrical side is space cell and 2 vesc i have carvon dual hub motors ordered and i plan to build my own housing for all of it myself. i will hopefully order my vesc and battery within the next few days

continued.... so i started building the enclosure since i drank to much last night and skipped out on fishing today.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/42ef5cb0180cbc7b7d2efa2f31e5500537330011.jpg" width="690" height="388"> i used duck tape and foam to make a mold. i know i could have got a cleaner look if i built a reverse mold but i didnt have enough foam so oh wells.
cut the corners a little bit and it helped when i was glassing<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/26605973b1ff62f2b57fdac7c05751e9e8eb60a8.jpg" width="690" height="388"> not sure how this will turn out but we will see. if i cant get it to look right or fit right i will probably go with psychotiller's bad ass enclosures.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/11c3bb3cecce077a6e015ce8550820ccfae7603f.jpg" width="690" height="388">
I took the dragon deck out for a spin and it is still to flexible with 6 plys canadian maple and 5 sheets of fiber glass. Onloop said the space battery doesnt like flex so v1 is retired to a dancer/cruiser board.started on a second board this past week since i have too the end of nov or dec for my vesc. this new one is 8 ply canadian maple ... hopefully wont flex much. also put less concave, pushed my truck holes out further and shortened the kicks. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/dc1700ea482e0babb6d8a3e5f99e6967fd6a3e15.jpg" width="690" height="388"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/fae87b0b1cefc7b43aeb7ecda936814d33176882.jpg" width="690" height="388"> also ordered one of @psychotiller 's cases since i didnt like how my fiberglass one came out and i have lots of other things i rather spend my time on atm. will post a pic of the case later..after sanding it and painting first. 
waiting on fabric from joanns so i started messing with @psychotiller 's case. So my first attempt at sanding abs plastic... 100%bitch lol. i need to get a power sander i guess. doing it by hand took me hours. i did buy a dremel to cut holes in it though.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/0788e2dac74a7693bf5f450056a602aa7ec38256.jpg" width="690" height="388"> a pic without clear yet<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/44e174e537fdfb3b7aa44d51566220c1d29bb6d8.jpg" width="690" height="388">i think they look better smoothed out but that's just my opinion.
Got my cloth in the mail so time to finish board 2.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/2d14a6e4a8778b2881ee7c5a5b1e6beac219b73d.jpg" width="690" height="388">

MAN that fabric idea is killer... love that irezumi tattoo style heaps! you & @longhairedboy will get along great!

GREAT WORK SO FAR!... definitely make sure it doesn't flex, the space cell is fairly long and it doesn't like flexing

```
what lowguido said. normally i would use a thinner fiberglass cloth like 4 oz. to keep the board some what flexible. but because i am going electric on this i used a thicker fiberglass cloth to stiffen the board more. if you look on the last 3 pictures i posted you can see a white looking cloth around the board with the design on it. once you apply resin to the cloth it becomes transparent so the fabric under the fiberglass shows through. sorry if you knew that already but i figured i would explain the best i can just in case someone else doesn't know this.

And that is how a board is bagged. Great job on this all around @kai ! 

A black box would look pretty good on there I think. Also you have the option of putting a colored wrap on it or painting it. Maybe even etch a pattern design into it. 

How was the oder on the West Systems epoxy? I'm planning to start using that to fill my wire channels as soon as my current supply of 3m crap runs out.

Personally i didn't find the odor that powerful with west system epoxy but it is still epoxy and it still stinks. I suggest doing it outside The cheap stuff i got at the hardware store when i build my fiberglass subwoofer enclosure was worse though. The awesome thing about west system is the pump measuring system they have. Made life a lot easier but it is not cheap.
I may try adding some kind of design into the enclosure. Maybe the ricepaper varnish technique.

@kai In order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds i am asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.

Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as 
**"new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb"** this becomes hard to keep track of.

I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;
**Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC**

Example
**The Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks |  R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC**
```

Much better, thank you... 

Now when people search for these keywords in google they have a much better chance of finding the relevant info.

ALSO note, if it's too long it gets cut off when you enter the thread.. so any unnecessary words such as "and"  can be removed. just need keywords only. It doesn't really need to be a sentence.

ALSO: you don't need to have "in progress first build" people will be able to determine the progress based on the content of the thread.

Got my order in for the vesc and space cell. Now the wait. Hopefully i am on the end of november list. @onloop you can just send the vesc and space cell together when my batch for the vesc is ready. Does the space cell require ventilation?

I assume your order is after #1133

If so you will be receiving late November.

The space cell ships seperatley. You'll get that soon.

Doesn't need ventilation.

so a list of all the stuff i got ordered minus the carvon dual drive hub motors, enertian vesc ,@psychotiller case, and my custom deck. If you guys think i am missing anything let me know please.
 
multi color 26 awg wire
14 awg wire
shrink wrap
rubber grommets and plugs
soldering iron with heat gun
60//40 tin lead solder
helping hands without magnifier (cause that magnifier one seems like it would get in the way)
space cell w/ fast charger
nunchuck
xt60 connectors
jst 4 and 6 pin connectors and contacts. (going to try crimping my own jst connectors)
glue gun
nylon and metal thumb screws with plastic head( not sure it those nylon ones are strong enough so i got metal ones too)
brass wood inserts ( using to screw thumb screws into instead of t-nuts for enclosure)
also not sure how i am going to secure the battery to board yet so any suggestions would be awesome. thanks!

lookin good!

for securing things to your board, I love this stuff:

This was just putting everything on to see if it works, but It's slim, flexible, and easy to work with- it would definitely fit under @psychotiller's case no problem.  

The one thing I can't remember is it's name... I'll go try to find it now, and update this post...

**edit:** I have no clue what it is called..sorry

If you look at your local hardware store (that is where I got mine) I'm sure you can find some- I think it was near the plumbing section and was made to hold down pipes.

So i got a weird nyko kama like @disastorm . It isn't even the same as his. So i soldered more wire on and figured i would just mount the whole receiver case on the board. I also crimped female jst ph contacts to test if it works before soldering them on.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/9e34de9f8b5fba8a11797c26a68d009002a383ad.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/77a8e8f207704cc67bcd4c7baeb56d8bffa3829e.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/8fde9851ac54afac0dc823fb7065df4a7314d884.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/5ac4de676212c00339094aa2c4b440abb3626706.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/20994afc4053dbf5e80da49cc816cae8b7aed218.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Nice lol there are so many versions of that. I havn't actually tested mine so I'm hoping it works when I get my VESCs. I also planned to mount the receiver case on the board, although i broke part of it off so I'll have to maybe hotglue the pcb in it or something.

Still no word on my carvon hub motors or vesc yet. Still need to put down some grip on the top and finish the sides and bottom of board with varnish but i need to wait till tuesday for full cure of resin. oh and just for informations sake. both the charge port and power button has a nut to hold it on. only thing you need is 2-40 machine screws and nuts for the lcd. i couldnt find any where i am at so i drilled the holes bigger on lcd. bad idea... yeah i know.

```
I got the 14 gauge wire to extend some of the battery wires. I also used 22 gauge and 18 i think. If you look at my pictures of my psychotiller case i have my space cell taken apart. All the wires running to power button, charge port and lcd display needed to be extended to reach the front of the case. I used the smaller 26 gauge wire to extend the wires on my nunchuck dongle and i will also use it to slave one vesc. I also had planned to crimp my own jst connectors for nunchuck and slaving the vesc but i am going to try something different. If you look at the picture of my nunchuck dongle it has the contacts crimped on. I am going to try to shrink wrap them to the jst plug on the board for the test run first before soldering them on. Was also thinking of a y connector for the xt60 but its probably better to cut one off of the vesc and solder the wires to the other vesc xt60 plug to save space as onloop suggested. Also got some shrink wrap to cover my vesc since multiple people have shorted out theirs. Looks like you need to solder your vesc to to a single jst connector and you need a 4 pin jst and a 6 or 7 pin jst for your nunchuck. If you buy the jst plugs with wires then you dont need to buy any wire like i did.

this reminds me that i have everything i need to make slave cables for VESC but i don't yet have a pair of VESCs to test them on. I also have the makings for several servo Y connectors for dual non-VESC ESCs. 

When i do make them though i plan to sell them cheap, so we'll have have some around.

Had some time today so i installed my wood inserts to mount my psychotiller enclosure. It holds down the space cell really tight. I don't think i need to attach the spacecell to the board because it holds it on very tight. I cant move it once i screw the enclosure down. I put a little tightbond3 on each insert so they hopefully stay snug.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/18907251dc075b92e453aa5538ec4de4151b75f2.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d7aa768e35050c36633d5d307e6d09f924634888.jpg" width="690" height="388">
I also shortened the deck. And refinished the edge.

I think matte black looks cool but .... matte black paint cannot be polished. There isn't really a good way to take care of it so i wouldn't want it on anything i wanted to last. Painting a car matte black for example is very silly imo. So no matter how cool i think it looks i wouldn't want it on anything i own. I used to run a small detail shop so I may just be biased a little but just my opinion.

I checked out your site bro. Looks nice. I went with wood inserts instead of the t-nuts because i wanted the top of the board to look clean. I glued them in so hopefully they hold. It wouldn't be a problem if i was going to use grip tape but because i went with clear permanent grip i didn't want the t-nuts showing on the top of board. I also am running his 21 inch box because i wanted to fit 2 vesc's and space cell. 21 inches is definitely needed.

FOC is really exciting! Can't hear the motors anymore while driving. Just updated from 2.3 to 2.4 and adjusted the KI value in the advanced tab (on the speed side of it) to 0.0150, works great in cruise mode also.

Downside is, people are scared when you're approaching them, since they only hear the board. Need a horn now! 😂

Just a note... when i removed the shrink wrap on one of my vesc xt60 connectors half of the copper strands on one of the wires was cut off and not connected to the xt60 probably due to a bad wire stripping job. I don't think it would cause much of an issue but glad i found it And fixed it.

Ok thanks chaka. May be a bit before o send it so i will contact you about it later. Thanks cmatson t.t  @psychotiller yeah all three seemed to be loose from the connectors. I think 2 came completely out. I just did a crappy job on the individual connector shrink wrap before shrink wrapping all three wires together. The other motor wires seem solid. Learning experience though..... my first build. I did get it up to 25mph according to gps before the wires came loose! I then decided i needed to change my bushings.

What current limiting do you have set in the vesc?

I assume those hubs ask for lots of AMPS. This could be causing major voltage sag and then the VESC (or space cell) is shutting down because of low voltage.

You may want to limit motor current a bit more.

## \#99 Posted by: kai Posted at: 2015-12-31T12:41:17.253Z Reads: 166

Yeah. I used west system 105 resin and the 207 hardener. The 207 dries super clear so ideal for something like this but takes a full week for full cure. You dont need fiber glass. I added it to increase strength. All you need ti do is add resin to sanded wood. Put fabric on... stretch fabric flat over board and add more resin to saturate. Add fiberglass over that while it is still wet if you want to add more protection or decrease flex.
