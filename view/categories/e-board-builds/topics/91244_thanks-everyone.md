She's a beast, that haggy kit looks built for the evo. 

If you're taking constructive criticism that could help headaches:

The angle of those phase wires is worrying to me personally. Your bullets are obviously on the outside of the enclosure there and pointing down rigid. I could see them easily snagging on a curb or obstical and pulling out, wearing through and shorting on each other or just generally getting damaged.

This build is begging for some 110's, like Roman mentioned!

Where abouts are you in the UK?

Great lookin build, gucci grip is...unique. 

Only thing, I'd point those motors up a bit, you'll definitely scrape it along the ground.

Wait, seems they're not adjustable.

Haggy mounts are adjustable. They clamp over the rounded end of the hanger and can be positioned pretty easily. 

Cool build @Becksy21.

It came out really clean. Question which angles you use front and rear trucks?

What @rey8801 is asking is if you had to use angled risers or what angle the truck baseplates are.
Haggy's are 50' and with reverse mount motors you can keep the standard degrees that the evo was designed for.  Trust me its much better the way you have yours set up as the deck will work as intended and remain stable at high speed and that thing is capable of high speed.
I would be grateful if you can share some insight on the handling after a few set up rides so I can get an idea of how the haggy trucks work on the deck.

It really is my first build, I just asked loads of questions on the forums and probably drove everyone mad then I took the plunge and ordered the haggy dual setup from Timo and the support and service I got from him was absolutely fantastic it gave me the confidence to go forward and order the other parts which he recommended and the only thing I had to do was some soldering and some drilling and routing out of the enclosure for the heatsink, I struggled with getting the enclosure seal right it took 3 failed online purchases before I got one that fit the only mistake I made was the on off battery switch is exposed but Iâ€™m gonna fit a removable cap to cover it, Iâ€™d say the hardest thing was doing the setting up of the unity but only because Iâ€™ve no idea with a windows computer

what @dareno said. Basically EVO has asymmetrical front and rear angles and that's why I was wondering which angled raised did you end up using. Just out of curiosity since that is one of the reason why I am making the Hammock adjustable base plate. Anyhow sick build and as first one I think you have pretty much reached the top notch already. Well done!

You missed something my man :wink:
They are Paris, caliber II, TB compatible base plate. Kahua is caliber based that's why I thought abut it here. It should be compatible as well.

So for a 50 degree rkp would it work with surfrodz?  Sorry @Becksy21 but this is important earth shattering stuff lol

no since Surfrodz has it's own product I focused on the most common hanger out there. Since I ma full of Paris and Caliber trucks I didn't want to use plastic raisers. I tried but too ugly. We take care of all the details and then bam a 3cm plastic raiser :joy: Surfrodz has different pivot center distance so it won't fit. This one is for standard truck. Probably also Ronin will fit, since you can use it with caliber base plate.
