Okay, I never made a board before.

I sat down found some parts and now put together a list and started ordering the parts, I've ordered the Trucks and Deck and I already have the Wheels and Battery so they are what im using.

But would you guys mind telling me if the other parts are okay and worth the money?

Thanks.

Deck: Loaded Vanguard Flex 2. (240 USD) (https://goo.gl/iyCLRf)

Trucks: CALIBER II 50° 184MM (100 USD) (https://goo.gl/QwSDZk)

Vesc: TORQUE ESC VESC ® BLDC Electronic Speed Controller (99 USD) (https://goo.gl/7xU7bs)

Controller: Alien Power System 2.4Ghz Electric skateboard Remote control (61 USD) (https://goo.gl/kyM3V1)

Motor: Electric Skateboard Motor 6355 190KV (90 USD) (https://goo.gl/vo5fKc)

Mount kit: Single Bolt On Motor Mount W/ Drive Wheel Kit 16T/36T (107 USD) (https://goo.gl/EDeJt1)

Battery: Battery 10S2p 36V 4.4Ah Samsung 18650 5c (73 USD) (https://goo.gl/13NFsB)

On / Off Switch: On Off Power Switch Electric Skateboard (60USD) (https://goo.gl/4t9HaE)

Wheels: Abec11 Flywheels 90mm Wheels (130 USD) (https://goo.gl/2kXe1H)

Total: 960 USD


My goal with my board is just to get a board I can ride around with, no special needs other than okay good speed (At least 22mph) and 5miles of range would be fine and from the looks of it this should do it?

Thanks.

Looks like 30Q's still it's only 10s2p so not good for hill climbing or heavy acceleration but probably ok for flat cruising.
