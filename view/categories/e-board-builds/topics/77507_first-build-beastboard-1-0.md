Hey!

First post in this forum! I'm going to be covering my build here. I warn you that this is going to take some time. I'm currently doing 2 masters degrees and an internship and, although this project is in collaboration with my Uni, I prioritise the others. 

Let's start!

**Parts list:**
(Please take into account that the build is not completed, so although the majority of the parts I got were recommended by other users in different threads, I cannot yet say they are working properly, specially electric components.)

**Things I've done by today (09/12/2018)**

****1.** Board**
 I got the board about a month ago:
![YngJi4DiQquNudsWRQVCKQ_thumb_138|560x500](upload://q29e5t3cFICC0QZARS7bPrF1I7W.jpeg) 

****2.** Motor mounts/Transmission**
Next step was designing the motor mounts, for that I used Solidworks and a 3d printer to test prototypes. I ended with this thing inspired in many builds I've seen here:

![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_ac|666x500](upload://27DPJnVMbW82MqWGW866Gfb4Uy1.jpeg) 

![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_a7|666x500](upload://w9iGhDFnc550BEpoILxCtBQLQOx.jpeg) 

I've noticed that, because of the truck's curvature, once tightened, the mount wont stay perpendicular to the truck's axis. So I decided to machine the trucks to make them flat on that area.

I'm currently looking for a machining company here in Madrid that will do the job, because of the small nature of the project, most companies are not willing to do it or charge me a crazy amount for it.

For the mounts, I'm planning on making them out of 7075-T6 Aluminium. To machine them I can use the CNC machine in my university, but first I want the trucks done to test some 3d printed prototypes on them.

For anyone interested, I will post the details and measurements of the mount once done!

****3.** Batteries**
I'm waiting to do everything motor mount-related before getting the batteries.
To mount the batteries I contacted Igus and they were kind enough to sell me one of their cable chains. I've seen this idea on one of @Nowind 's threads. I thought it looked badass and so I decided to go with that:

![KivkeI3LRM20T0FVKZKuXQ_thumb_14b1|666x500](upload://trKzTcb2i4Dc7HTtM0BgpnZb2q9.jpeg)  

I will be designing and 3d-printing some end caps. 
My idea is store the ESC and BMS on the bottom cable-chain and use the top one to store more battery cells in case the bottom one runs out of space.

Any advice is appreciated!! 

Will update once I manage to find someone who can machine the trucks for me!

I haven't ordered the batteries yet, I want to wait until I have the whole transmission done.
I plan on spot-weld them myself yes, with a makeshift spot welder from a car battery and a solenoid. Hopefully I don't burn my house down!

Nice build. Seems like you read a lot before you started your build üòâ
If you add a crossbar to your motor mounts it probably will hold the mounts better in position.
 good enough that you don‚Äôt need to machine the hanger.

Yeah! I hate to be one of those people who asks but don't like to read! I made sure i knew every aspect of esk8's before buying anything!

I'm actually going to build a cage too, with 2 or 3 crossbars (top-bottom or top-botom-back), like many people do.

Still, if there's a chance I can make a really good design I'm taking it! (Plus I love that feeling when everything fits together so nicely). Right now a company has the hanger and they're going to get back to me this week once they've decided if it's worth it to do the job.

With 3 crossbars it should be sitting rock solid.
The thing with machine the hanger is, if you one day want to swap them to a other truck you need to machine that one too.
So a design without changing on the hanger makes you more independent.

I know you say yourself now it‚Äôs anyhow just for this board....buuut I see potential in you that your first build will not stay the last build üòú
It‚Äôs getting addicting very fast, believe me.
There is always a need for a second board and a third and and and ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But that's a really good point, I'm going to need to rethink my options :thinking:, thanks!!

You should look into how trampa is mounting there mount to the truck. Just copy the clamping mechanism and your golden. Or buy some mount premade

True, but still, as a project I would like to make the mount myself. It's something I've had decided from the beginning. I've also studied trampa's mount before, but I didn't trust the deviation I said the hanger caused on the mount.
Using the crossbars might help though, I'll wait for the company's response and then decide on that.

Thanks for the input!

merry Christmas to everyone. love what you're doing btw! you defiantly need to change out those 3D printed motor mounts. trust me I've tried using 3D prints for high toque applications like that, see if there are any maker labs around your area, i found one about a mile away from my house and they had a CNC machine. also I would get some sealed 6374 motors, it will help you out in the long run :slight_smile: 
where are you based? UK?

Merry Christmas!! Yeah, I wasn¬¥t planning on using those 3d printed mounts for actual use! I¬¥m requesting prices to different aluminium manufacturers around my city. I¬¥ve been searching and there is not one maker lab around that isn¬¥t my university, which, by the way, is full at the moment. I should have thought about that before buying these, but I have plans to partialy insulate them from road water and what not.

I¬¥m based in Madrid, Spain!

**UPDATE (25/12/2018)**
Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone! 2019 is aproaching fast and I couldn¬¥t be more excited!

I¬¥ve received almost everything I need at this point:

**Focbox Unity**
So pumped!! I didn¬¥t research enough about the connections though. I didn¬¥t think there were so many types of JST connectors! Motors use 1.5mm and Unity uses 2mm JST connectors. Oredered some adapters from aliexpress (added to the item list). The 3 banana connectors on each motor are 4.5mm while the Unity has 3.5mm, so I also ordered those connectors to make an adapter. 

I didn¬¥t want to cut the motor cables so I don¬¥t ruin the warranty, plus it¬¥s better future sales!

![IMG_3118|666x500](upload://41A4PMzj1GadpOuwD1jqxm6BfxK.jpeg) ![IMG_3123|666x500](upload://6DdCHmrVfT4XQXrTIZLieacLf3L.jpeg) 


**Samsung Batteries**

I changed my mind last second and decided to go full crazy-mode with 12S6P setup, 72 30Q cells in total!
![IMG_3122|666x500](upload://tOFsZfDJdEhhgt5PeLY5D9mreLN.jpeg)

I also decided to build my own spot-welder with an old microwave transformer and a relay. Got it working today. I just have to 3d-print some kind of levers to make it easier to use.

**Trucks and motor mount**

Finally got the hanger machined! Redesigned the mount so it has a snug fit while leaving a bit of room for movement. It will be fixed in place with M4 or M5 screws. 
![IMG_3165|666x500](upload://m5l5jZJcyHFR01iDomfPngMrsnG.jpeg) 

I¬¥ve learned this really usefull trick from Wintergatan (you have to see his videos on youtube he¬¥s amazing). Make small circled cut-outs on the corners so it fits without having to guess fillet size or tolerances!
![IMG_3166|666x500](upload://jTKcKESfiYM6cHRNa0qHwsgtkDh.jpeg)


And that¬¥s it for now! I¬¥m going to focus on finishing the motor mounts first before starting to make the batteries and test the motors. This way I won¬¥t go crazy wanting to ride the board but not having the mounts yet!

I have exams in January so I thing I¬¥m going to relax a bit till new years and then study for those exams, I won¬¥t be advancing much till the second week of January. 

Happy New Year everybody, see you in 2019!!

I have looked but they charge me like 500 euros for 2 mounts, It¬¥s just not worth it. Also, this aluminium manufacturer has water-cut machines with 0,1mm tolerance. This cutting process is so much cheaper than CNC machining. I don¬¥t think they¬¥re going to give me a price till new years though. 

If I go that route the only thing I would have to do is drill the holes in the mounts for the attachments to the hanger and the crossbars, which isn¬¥t that hard to do.

Hahaha yes! I¬¥ve calculated the space in the cable chain and, with the top portion, everything should fit fine. Honestly, I was more concerned about sagging than top speed. But it¬¥s a plus! I will always wear body-protection though and ride safely! I can¬¥t wait to finish it!

Well hello there fellow people!

First of all here are the reasons for my 10 month hiatus:

* 3 of my battery modules cought on fire after my impatient dumbass wanted to test-fit them inside the enclosure without insulating them:

![camphoto_342241519|666x500,50%](upload://laQsP0zkGTlWwir8sE1pAbPfynI.jpeg) ![IMG_4399|666x500,50%](upload://2AzvmLXqnu72G0ToRVEQduD21cB.jpeg) 

![IMG_4414|666x500,50%](upload://zGfTTSgglkgvO3xfSPRx9MMmVxV.jpeg) ![IMG_4415|666x500,50%](upload://wreXPGb1SWNSoKNRbfXbSRYRSY9.jpeg) 

* After that I ordered more batteries and more nickel strip which took a while to arrive. By the time it did I was already into my final exams.

* I spent the whole month of july developing a homemade spot welder with a microwave transformer and an arduino (I know):

![IMG_5934|375x500,50%](upload://5DOcnwp4mFWpI0K1kbQ4toZTPgG.jpeg) 


This brings us to October:

**BATTERY PACK:**

I finished welding all of the battery¬¥s modules. I discarted my initial idea of spot-welding 3 nickel strips on top of each other because, as you know, nickel to nickel doesn¬¥t really stick that well. So I left only one nickel strip and I welded cable on top of it just to be sure that conduction is good:

![IMG_7239|666x500,75%](upload://vUrKc7MxRi6joDu6gYjIBtnBU1f.jpeg) 

By the way, here¬¥s a tip for soldering on top of nickle, if you sand the nickle it will stick SO much better:

![IMG_7237|666x500,75%](upload://vYpvrYDFdc3LNSG0Lal6sKxbBkV.jpeg)

After soldering all of the modules I redisigned my battery insulators (and this time I used them). Sadly I was so pumped to build the battery that I didn¬¥t take pictures of how the modules look, but here¬¥s the CAD version (*I will leave all the CAD STL files at the end of the post in case you want to use them*):

![Assem1|591x499,50%](upload://mbHBOyK6kg9jIkEoG1acfJqigeB.jpeg) ![Assem11|591x499,50%](upload://rXZrXh6qQ8MyUHDkAeYr4ZTIkew.jpeg) 

All soldered, shrink tubbed (is that a word?) and assembled, including the BMS, looked like this:

![E4D4D6C4-962A-4F02-B94E-D8C925FFED58|690x388](upload://53Mct5BQmdINysEsaxulMlTmkmY.jpeg) 

There are 6 modules in total (12S).

Note that I couldn¬¥t fit the other 2 modules (4S more), so I put them on top of the board, you can see another enclosure in the image. Those 2 long black cables coming out of the center of the board are the connections for those 2 modules.

**MOTOR MOUNT:**

Redesigned the motormount.

![Motormount_izq|591x499](upload://qoxVNBBNcb77UZl9QtacseFCrhf.jpeg) 

![IMG_7414|375x500](upload://ojA2o3Mjj2iliL7Qo8Zhn8KuRmx.jpeg) 

Test fitting the new motor mount:

https://i.imgur.com/08aoxVV.mp4

Note that the trucks need to be machined from two sides so the section is 21.5 x 21.5 mm.

The plates of the motor mounts, as well as the crossbars, will be ordered in 7075-T6 aluminium.

Separators will be the same as the ones you see in the video, they are printed in PETG.

The motormount works as is, all 3D printed, but I don¬¥t like how much movement it has, so that¬¥s why I¬¥m going with aerospace grade aluminium, it wouldn¬¥t be a beastboard it if hadn¬¥t some of it!

**FUNCTIONAL (but not finished) BOARD!!**

![IMG_7425|666x500,75%](upload://jJmnLE7L1OqG4aLur9t2slYTZpw.jpeg) ![IMG_7427|666x500,75%](upload://mfjBjsMQ8vYYAEifdgGEt97v2O1.jpeg) ![IMG_7428|666x500,75%](upload://8DnZaWFvGBE54zg3Z3bgirecrLY.jpeg) 

So again, I was impatiend and I went for a stroll, I¬¥m surprised as how resistant the 3D printed parts are, they haven¬¥t bent at all but I¬¥ll be ordering some this week.

Here are some statistics of the ride, bare in mind that my area has some steep downhills and uphills.

![IMG1_7446|535x500,75%](upload://kaKWOADPl7kygMZtapkVWOZ9Emb.png) 

**Next steps:**

* Order the aluminium parts for the truck mount.

* 3D Print some end caps for the enclosure

* Waterproofing the enclosure as much as I can, although I don¬¥t plan on riding in rain.

* Make an emergency current cut-off loop on top of the borad.

* Add some cool head lights I have to the board.

Well that¬¥s it for now! Will try to finish the board by the end of the year (Hopefully won¬¥t be another 10 months).

**Troubleshooting:**

This is for anyone that can help me with some of the issues I¬¥m experiencing:

* With the board off the ground, I noticed that one of the motors would start before the other one and it feels like it has a bit more power. When I brought the board back to the workshop I undid the pulleys and moved the motors by hand. I noticed that the one that gives more torque has a more smooth rotation than the other one. I can feel the "magnet stops" a lot more on the other one.

While riding the board I can¬¥t tell one of the motors is pushing more than the other, everything seems smooth.

Here¬¥s a video, you can see that my hand shakes more while moving the right motor, making a kind of "stop stop stop" movement:
