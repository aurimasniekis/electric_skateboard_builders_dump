Here is my first exploration into the Eboard experience!  I have tried to build a fast, reliable single motor setup for commuting around SoCal. I have bought some components but the build is not yet finalized.  Nano-x is on order as well as the VESC-X! I just got Jlabs 6374 in and at the sight of it I was compelled to spend the rest of the money needed to get this board rolling. That motor looks so powerfull! It looked smaller in the pictures. I have to wait for VESC-x to ship.

I think 10s would work well but it's up to you also i believe that 10s is recommended for the v-esc.

Man, it is so hard to build a board right now with parts like the BMS and VESC being so close to having new iterations.
Should I  get the bestech 10s BMS? SUpower BMS? or wait for JTAG?

I chose the Franken Rodder deck and I have been pushing it around waiting for the VESC_X and a bunch of other parts.
I also chose the name M1 before the stinkin inboard came out.

Why did you go with hardcase? Aren't those more prone to breaking even though they are cheaper for some reason.

I have a bunch of rc trucks that use the same battery haha. So these packs can go in my rc cars for some weekend fun. Some 2wd SC10's and a XXX buggy. I went with a hardcase because I like the extra protection and simply availability. I don't know what you mean by the hardcase packs breaking. But if I didn't have RC cars, I would prefer an 18650 pack. Future build...

Hey brotha like your vision for your board.  I've also ordered my parts and am patiently waiting.  The only part I haven't ordered was my lipos and battery charger.  How is the 10s working for you?  Also, the B6 is a real popular charger but I'm looking st the Turnigy TT6080 AC Lipo charger.  Anyhow, hope you get back to me regarding the 10S lipo, looking for some perspective. üòÄ  Take care!

I craigslisted my hyperion eos charger and bought a charging board from Hobbyking. Ideally I would get the BMS from besttech or whoever and a 10s 18650 li-ion battery pack from @barajabali , diy, enertion or ??? or make my own. Since I had a charger already from rc cars, these lipos are a cheaper option for me and they are familiar for me to get started with. I am working on sourcing some sort of bms with an 18650 setup to enclose under the M2. As far as I know, 12s is the listed max for the Vesc and other parts so I dropped it to 10s for reliability. But I have an extra battery to try out 12s as well.:imp::rocket:
Also I wonder how a 15mm belt setup would work compared to this 12mm setup since I only plan on 1 big motor.

Thanks for the input!  I fly drones as well so I'm familiar with Lipos.  As for now üëåüèΩ I'm gunna stick to the (2) 5S or 3 3S 5000 mah.  I've been seeing more and more threads talking about  BMS' with there set-ups.  Is a BMS required or optional with running batteries in parallel ü§î?  Do you have any recommendations for YouTube tutorials or links from the thread about BMS'?  Thanks again. üëçüèΩ

those hard pack lipo's are overkill!
i've been using 12s with no problems but 190kv would put you at 67k erpm . above 60k is not recommended.

haha yes the packs are overkill. But they also go in my rc cars which makes this board even cheaper for me. Can you explain what makes them overkill for the eskate purpose? The C rating right?
Ah yes, I should not run 12s on this 190kV motor then. 170kV for 12s?

The BMS is 
1)a charger
2)possibly an anti spark switch replacing vedders
3)an extra safety feature for discharging/charging...I dont understand the BMS protections thoroughly.
4)not required 

You can use a hobby charger
and a Loop key/ 12s rc helicopter/plane anti spark switch/ vedders spark switch
and still have a working board

yea mostly the high C is more than you ever need at 10s/12s. and the cost.

170kv would work. i use 149kv.

If you want a 10s4p pack I'll give you a discount on the current price. I spotwelded one last week and the customer changed their mind on size. So I want to get rid of it. Comes with bms charger ollin board co switch percent display etc. 

I can also just charge you for the welded cells if you want to do it yourself

Ill get the spreadsheet of parts updated on here soon.
One change Id like to make is to get the bestech bms so I can avoid taking the batteries out to balance charge.
And get my Neopixels on.

I had 2 problems setting this board up right before use.
1. Nano-x  lost its bind and I couldnt get it to rebind by the youtube method of switching to the bind channel or by waiting with it on.

P1 Solution: was to wait for the caps to discharge fully by letting the RX and TX sit off for about a full minute, then repeat the autobind instructions.

2. BLDC tool wouldnt find the VESC X. I was opening BLDC tool, then plugging in VESC and it wouldn't find it. 

P2 Solution was that I needed to plug the vesc into the computer first with it on then open the BLDC tool. (Also  the first data cable was power only so I switched cables to another that I know transfers data.)

I put the motor heel side and now I am having major wheel spin. So I will be moving the motor to toe side.
I also have a problem with the gearing. I have major torque at low speeds and then at top speed the motor is barely working hard. It seems limited by erpm or something and it just stops pulling.

Regarding the motor postion swap:
Wheel spin on toe side is still prevalent but it is easier to load the inside wheel up when accelerating than the outside.

Nano X Issue:
Sometimes the nano x doesnt bind. 
I have to unscrew my container and wriggle the wire on the nano or move it bind and back to ch1 at least twice, before it binds,

Vesc Issue:
The big issue is
I am cruising at top speed, then the light in front of me turns red and sometimes when I go for the brakes, only like 10 percent of them are there and I end up blowing through the light. The braking force will stay minimal until 1) I release the brakes and re-engage them but i must be going at a low speed. 
At lower  and mid speeds the brakes are strong.

There seems to be 2 stages of the brakes. Low speed and high speed brakes. At about 3-5mph a new firmer stage of brakes set in.
I will be turning all brake settings down to see if the brakes engage consistently at top speed.
