Alright so, I want to build an electric board for under $300. I know everyone on this forum says I will end up with a piece of garbage, but I do have a few things to my advantage. I already have the complete board which is a Sector Nine Sprocket, I have built an MPCNC so I will be able to mill out aluminum motor mounts, I will scrap and airtronics remote controller from an RC car, and I have a 3d printer for any of the other things like enclosures and what not. 
These are the electronics I was planning on buying, I don't have a complete understanding of all the compatibility so I was hoping someone could check for that:

Hey I am almost finished with my under 300€ board and maybe you can save money on the esc:
https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-120A-ESC-Brushless-Waterproof-Sensorless-18-RC-Car-Part-p-1085232.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN
It has the same specs you need because it is rated for max 6s and 120amps but cheaper. You can buy a program card for ~€7 to change some settings.

The only downside is that you will need to wait 3weeks for it to arrive haha

I know exactly what it’s like to be like you, I started the exact same way but with an even lower budget. 

If I was you I’d scrap the balance charger and get a charge only bms and charger for about $20 on eBay. 

Another choice you have is for the esc, either get a 6s one like that or a Xcar beast. Or you can buy the eBay substitute esc which I am currently using in single drive and it performs very well.

Since you already have some things and can make a lot yourself you should end up with a fairly decent board. 

Oh and the Keda motors might also be good to have a look at for a cheap motor, I personally use 3.

Edit: have a look at my build thread, it might give you some ideas on low budget boards.

Thanks this looks like a great way to save some money. Also do you have a thread on your build that I could like because that cheap of a build would be very interesting to learn from.

This is great build and I learned a lot looking through it. Those Keda motors look like a great way to save some money. I am personally looking at the 6364 190Kv motor. It says that it runs on 10S, but I was wondering if I would be able to run it on a 6S because all the cheap ESC's typically run 6S from my findings.

I have been looking at ESC with a built remote. It seems to be working fine from the thread that I found it from and I was wondering if any of you would recommend it.

Also would it be a good idea to use this battery with this BMS.

Hi, I will make a thread about it and for now here is an instructable about it: 
https://www.instructables.com/id/My-Homemade-Electric-Skateboard/
It is not a realy good one, I made it in a rush and have modified some parts on my board so maybe not that useful.

I will give more indepth information in the future tho! 
Since yesterday I have finished the build and it is great for now it has just enough speed for me as topspeed (but it can be faster in my opinion). I can't say much more because I haven't ridden long distances etc.

Motors will run on whatever voltage you plug into them, just not too high. Those batteries aren’t very good, they tend to puff up and catch fire easily, the blue turnigy ones have been rock solid for me

What motors, esc, batteries, and charging system did you use? Do you have a thread to your build?

Question:

What if you use 2x 3s LiPo at whatever mAh you need, and connect them in series? That way you get a lower profile and can have a thinner enclosure.

It should work fine to discharge in series but will it work to charge it? Maybe someone can fill in?

I'm thinking if you cut the two balance plug cables and solder it up to 1x 6s balance plug?

Would it work for the charging? Of course without disconnecting anything, to have it easy

Btw the battery's work well for me but at around 3.8v per cell you will see it start slowing down. For me that's fine because I usually don't reach that low.

Is it very hilly or flat where you live?

Are you going to buy 1 or 2 batteries and will you run them in parallel or series?

I plan on using one battery. 

It is pretty hilly where I live.

How far can you ride it before it dips below 3.8v per cell?

I run 2 lipos in parallel (6s 10400mah) to get a distance of about 12km and my area is very hilly. Your going to want to run at least 2 in parallel to get get a semi decent amount of amps

Those batteries are out of stock I was wondering if it would be worthwhile to buy 4 of these and wire two pairs in series and then wire those in parallel. 

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-3s-5200mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html

Or should I just get one of these to make it easier

No, that chargers at 5a it doesn't mean there's a limit to capacity of batteries. Im horrible at explaining all this btw. I use that specific charger to charge my 6s 10.4a LiPo

On hills you can expect around 40A constant draw from your batteries. The ones you chose are 10C and 10Ah, so max 100A draw... should be good, but keep in mind that they might not last very long. 

A guy from my area was running the same batteries, they lost capacity rather quickly, in a few months I think, until he decided to get new ones. Truth be told he was rather hard on them.
