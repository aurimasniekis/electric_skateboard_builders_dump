Hello Leute!

There is enough text about pros/cons and overall excitement about DD in my previous topics #fliess.
Here I just wanted to put a bit more photos, so that hub fans may also try to build their own DD and finally start riding normal wheels haha.

By "bulletproof" in topic name I meant the reliability/durability of the motor protective cases, which are pretty heavy now, but should serve and shine (V4A stainless steel) forever. As my own experience shows, anything thinner than 2mm gonna be crashed by rocks or curbstones, which leads to broken magnets.
Anyway, I like to ride a lot/fast and I never care which surface. So if my motors gonna crash, it will happen pretty soon :crazy_face: If anybody can quickly calculate how strong should be a hit to bend V4A stainless steel tube > 5mm thick, I will appreciate :slightly_smiling_face:

I was naive to think that stainless steel is machinable by my basic tools

But with proper inserts even my cheap minilathe can deal with it

Haha, I was hoping to disassemble the motor by screwing these 4 bolts slowly and hence pushing the wheel mount out. Bad idea to screw against the magnets if mount fitting is very tight

Would it be an Good Idea to just put some urathane on the can and technically make one looong as wheel?

Traction would be killer

Urethane is a poor heat conductor, so then it would have the same issue as a normal hub motor

i love every thread you post, so well-photographed and informative. I want to someday try to make my own direct drive motor like you did. Bravo man

aren't you worried about clearance? it's looking pretty tight down there. Maybe with some 107s you'd have a little more breathing room?

@faithfulpuppy, thanks dude! Trying to be helpful.

I have described in details my thoughts about clearance and wheels, if you check other #fliess topics. In short: 
1. small clearance is not a problem as it looks in theory, if you have a good protection
2. riding 83mm normal wheels has much more fun than ugly 90mm+. I am talking from perspective of own experience and just because guys who can ride a board properly (at least downhillers) never go beyond 80mm

In other words, you are right if I wanted a board just to commute, but once you start riding a lot for fun and you try to learn something new, you realise what really matters.

As long as you manage the temeperature of the motors it should work.

@uigiroux, hard to say about speed, because I never used dedicated (read accurate) gps to measure it. I always use Endomondo though, and I tend to trust the measurements now, because I always hit 62-63kmh max exactly. It's on 83mm wheels. Don't remember how was it with 90mm Flywheels.
KV - sk3 149kv switched to star one motor. Another one rewound, so cannot say exactly.
Please check hobbyking for watts if you trust the data there :slightly_smiling_face:

Yeah about how much would these run?  I should have Working prototype in a month max and it's gonna be crazy powerful, and I'm planning on selling sets as well.  Curious what the cost will be around, though my stator will be really high quality with silver windings and one single wire so very thick and perfectly wound.  Can't wait!

Uuhm.. Do you have any idea of how expensive that silver windings would be? Silver cost around $0.5 per gram, and you’ll need around 75g of silver ( eqalient to 50g copper) if i remember right. 

And also you cant just have one strand of wire, thats not how it works. (Again not 100% sure)

Just made a short ride to see again how's battery performance when cold and measure a speed. Interesting thing - I was pushing to limits 50-60% of the time, so the battery itself was always slightly warm. Still, the range is ~20-30% less than usually.

You mean silver transfer heat 30% better than copper. Do you have a source for that?, cause its completely wrong. 

Silver windings is usually just used in small motors, where the weight/performance ratio is vert critical..

That's what it says on the motors that use it in their stators.  I have two screen shots, the first addresses the silver, and the next, though it talks about their copper in a different motor, it shows the winding of thick, 1 strand wire winds.

These motors are going to be very high quality.  The reason a lot of cheaper companies use many thin stands I couldn't really say why, other than it's easier to wind thin stands then to wind the equivalent weight in one stand.  Regardless, mine will be top of the line in every aspect...

Initially I didn't even plan to touch the magnets, but when I tried my 1st extractor idea, i.e. slowly turn 4 bolts and push the wheel mount out, then 2 magnets just dislocated:

For a similar belt drive performance you would in most cases end up paying more!
2 x 6374 ($260)

2 x motor pulleys ($30)
Precision truck ($30 if lucky)

Prices I indicated are obviously for the best parts there are in the market (obviously if you can make parts such as pulleys and mounts at home it'll be cheaper, but Carvon's are not home made, they are pretty damn polished).

I know Jerry uses SK3 motors however his are sensored and you can't get SK3 with sensors so price of $260 was for 2 Dark Matter motors from @scepterr Those are very high quality, black like carvons and sensored!

TB mounts are $60 each and seem to be **one of the** best available. 

For an equal quality I quoted what aluminium pulleys would cost, not plastic.

And precision trucks... yeah those are just another story : )

Durability is a factor, the major reason to get CNC precision milled trucks is predictability.  On cast trucks the hanger doesn't rotate exactly the same in both directions because of inconsistencies in length, width, weight, profile, etc.  You end up learning to compensate for those differences when riding for a awhile.  WIth precision trucks you can predict the radius of a turn, the amount of lean, the depth of the slide, etc. all based on the mathematics surrounding the precise profile of the truck.  

In all honesty its not much of a difference and most of us that have precision trucks are not nearly talented enough to make use of the very subtle differences.  That being said...they are fuckin cool :slight_smile:

@Sapphirinia, all is possible. I would first of all check if central hole in stator can be enlarged from 8mm to at least 10. I am using 12mm axle.

Hallo Leute.

Small update - **Fliess3 Stainless** has done it's first _illegal_ **1000km**. So far the motors don't seem to need any intervention for servicing. The 83mm wheels however are getting smaller and smaller due to some learning attempts to slide :crazy_face:

And today my wife's Evolve braked suddenly while she was riding, because pretty big piece of wood debris got stuck in between belt and pulley and could get lost because of belt protection. On the photo we have already rotated the wheel reverse in order to get rid of debris. The wheels was really dead blocked and couldn't rotate forward even with force :confused: Conclusion - **shitty belts**, better ride DD guys :wink:

Honestly i'm fine with pneumatics, though i've never had a lot of PU experience since i only rode my regular eboard for a few months before the ATB.

I don't get your logic, everything starts with a dozen of hobbyist. Esk8 started with a few guys. Now there's more than 13000 pple on the subreddit. Everything has to start at some point and evolve from there.
Carvon have sold at least 300 - 400 drives with the SD the XL and the torque drive, they have a partnership with Koowheel ( Chinese manufacturer that will only do something if it's scalable ) so I don't call this not enough demand but a Monopoly. It's clearly different.
If you don't Wana develop your masterpiece fair enough it's your call mate, but it's not true. There's demand for Direct Drive, and it's only growing. 
And if I may people's would say the same thing a few years back with hubs motor yet now see the market, almost every eboard has hubs.

The other issue here is effort vs return.

If @fliess was going to manufacture something, deal with that process, deal with QC problems, communication problems, logistical complications, initial investment for mass production, loss of personal income during set up and the list goes on and on...

He might want to pick a different product to develop in a more mature market, like ebikes or something similarly widely adopted.

Nice, I can only dream. With regards to stainless steel think twice what you want to achieve at the end. It's a perfect choice for super robust DD, but also heavy and not easy to machine. Aluminum may suffice for lighter and slower board. Especially if you plan bigger wheels.

Isn’t stainless about the same weight as all steel since they all roughly have same iron content?  

There’s a bunch of diff stainless n some non-magnetic. A ferromagnetic sleeve will reflect the magnet strength n make for a better motor.  Aluminum is light n could be strong enough but will make the motor even a bit worse w eddy current losses but minor.  If u want easy to cut steel get a mild steel w low carbon n no hardening or any alloys. Strong n the best magnetic retention and easiest steel to cut

I’m making my own direct drive at the moment and will most likely just use locktite 68X. I was a cheat and don’t have access to mills to make my own trucks so I got an old pair chopped out the axle and drilled it out to 12mm. Now it’s ready for an axle, I’m thinking mild steel to start will as it has a higher elongation rating meaning it will rather bend than snap which is obviously better.

Yes it will work. I also thought about it. The only thing that you add liek 5-8mm width that is not need it. If you plan to use big motors that will result in more than 34cm rear truck with wheels. Difficult to pair it. Plus you will need a hanger that can host the screws and being big enough to drill it. If you have 5o make your own truck then you have for sure the tool for make the key way. These are reasons thst moved me to the own truck choice.

Hi, I get the point that it's better reflect the magnetic field to retain it inside the motor as much as possible. What it's not clear to me is the distinction you do on the ferromagnetic materials. I mean ferromagnetic in my understanding means that it will be pulled by magnets but it is not magnetic buy itself. Meaning that it will be attracted by the magnets but won't reflect the magnetic field. So which steel is also magnetic? Thx :grin:

I do it all from elementary to principal and spend most of my time with the kids that are kicked out from the regular schools for bad behavior and the state still legally needs to educate them.  kids who break car windows and steal and carry guns and smoke weed in the halls.
 used to teach the GED.

if you have a college four year degree and you're interested in subbing...its a bunch of hoops you have to jump through but gives you a lot of freedom and beats a lot of other work

not related but theres not a kid in this class and that's typical.  They all left to go wander the city streets and left us three teachers to twiddle on the fancy computers.  its a pretty experimental school.  extremely permissive.  like 4 kids max in the class if they actually show and 3 teachers!

Why do you say that? It seems like tesla is certainly doing something right...

I think we are all way too stuck on this standard RC motor type. There's so many types of motors, surely there's some things we are missing, like hall beck array magnets.

"Benefits attributed to switched reluctance (also called variable-reluctance) motors include high motor-drive efficiency and reliability, low overall system cost, and increased performance."

Oh yeah, Tesla is for sure innovating like crazy. The reason I say "motors are fucking wack" is because as a 16 year old who loves learning about engineering (and is still very much a noob to it all), I am fascinated by the all of the incredibly different (and sometimes hard to understand) designs of motors. I guess before I looked into reluctance motors that I just assumed there was 1 type of 3 phase motor.
