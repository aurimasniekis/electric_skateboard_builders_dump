Your ESC isn't going to have brakes.  You want a car ESC.  Not sure why you have 2 different motors.  The kv's are way too high. Generally you don't want to go over 300 kv.  If you plan to run your batteries in series, you'll be running 12s and you don't want to go over 200 kv then (at least in the VESC's case).

Can't I fix that with a different gear reduction from what is normally used

It may have brakes, but they're meant for a boat or airplane.  If you read the forum, it is mentioned many times that if you're going to use an RC ESC, to use a car esc. For that kind of money, you should have gone with an ESC from @torqueboards. ( ).  I would cancel your order before it ships.

F3A brakes means instant brake from any speed to 0. Will throw you off board for sure.
I have this HV esc, it works fine on acceleration but braking is simply stupid to do.

Would it not be possible to get a higher gear reduction and still use the motors.

yes but you're still going to be straining those motors

The problem you will probably run into. is trying to find a pulley small enough to give you a higher ratio, while still fitting on the motor shaft, and having enough contact to transmit power.

just get the 149kv motor from hobbyking for 50 bucks
a 6s ezrun, fvt 120 amp or hobbyking x car 120amp or 150amp esc
You want an 8mm motor shaft because 6mm can sometimes break due to strain

his board kind of stuggled with that single if you look at when he rides and thats just on flat ground

You wont be able to get adequent reduction from 450+kv.. 

290kv is already stretching it for a 6s board- not to mention the motors are 42mm and 50mm, which are quite small for a 220lb person.

Everyone on the forum uses HTD5 as far as I know. That belt wouldn't work as well. I recommend you do a bit of reading on other peoples threads so you can learn a bit more about eboards.

1 decide on a motor
2 figure out the ratio you want/need
3 find the pulleys
4 find the belt

You cant really jump to step 4, without the other parts first

The way braking works with Flier ESC's is they begin to brake as soon as you let go of the speeder. So you can't really cruise with it and that makes it more battery consuming. It also feeels really odd to ride compared to the more normal RC car ESC. Your fingers have to be on high alert all the time if you don't want to face the asphalt.

You can't get enough reduction on the small area we need. I.e the wheels

I am trying to build a small, motorized vehicle for a little girl who has no function of her legs. I have been trying to base my design off of electric skateboard instructables. Right now I have a 100A ESC and a 5045 500 kv motor. I saw above in the comments to send the motor back unless you weigh 60 pounds - she really is like 60 pounds haha so I am trying not to send the motor back. I currently have a plane ESC and realized that that is not what I want, so I was looking into other ESCs and found that VESC is highly recommended. I could really use some help in determining if the VESC will work well with the motor I have and would love any tips or information that people have. This is for a little girl so we we are not concerned about speed - our target speed is about 3mph.
