##Hey eSk8!

Just making this post to show you guys some new products I'm testing out!

This is a New 12S Battery 5200mAh... [Pre-Order Today](http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/12s-stealth-battery)!
I'm getting about 15-16 miles on Dual motors and much higher on single drives!

I will but posting videos later once they render and upload!

## This is the build!

(Not the prettiest, but works for testing!)

Also "Future" Oriol Here:
I had to move the electronics over to the Bhangra as the Hub Motors Failed while riding. The Urethane just came off.

Not currently. It's my only test pack. I Don't want to take it all apart until I've finished testing or it fails during the testing.
Setup is 12S2P 18650 Cells. Slim BMS. Has a 50amp cut off built in to protect batteries as well as over/under charge protection.

Nope, your amp pull on 12S is not that high.

Average amp draw on most boards is about 5amps.
If your board is hitting 100+amps its only in burst for probably less than a second or two. anything longer would drain your battery too fast and your rides would one be seconds long.
And it's happening because you are probably not kicking off your board on un-sensored motors and trying to start from a dead stop, going up a very steep hill, or trying to break a world record speed. :sweat_smile:

Space Cell does have a 40amp fuse but it's rated for 60amps.
If you want you could add a 40amp fuse to this battery with that little fuse holder casing, but so far no issues while using the 50amp built in cut off.

@Bender The Pack is a great size and it's about 3lb

@delta_19 They are very similar to TB new Hub Motor. But I can't be certain. I talked to the company and they said these motors had an updated 30mm stator which I think is the the same as TB. However the thread lock used by the company is terrible if they even used any. the screws came off while riding causing the urethane to almost come off the wheel. I'm by new screws and using my own thread lock to test again eventually. 

@link5505 The mAh consumption is much lower on 12S so you can get some very long rides.

I kinda forgot about using 12S since everyone kinda started using 10S packs. I might as well do a 12S build since with more volts it draws less amps, if I am not mistaken.

12S 5.2Ah is just 225Wh (double boosted and they hit about 5miles under normal conditions). from my experience i always need 10Wh/kilometer minimum (last record run exactly 9Wh/km!!!),
usually more like 13Wh/km under normal riding conditions (with single motor) ... so with your battery thats max 20km range for all my builds under "cruise" conditions and more like 15km range under my "normal" conditions (heavy carving at 30kph+).

you might have found the holy grail of hubmotor+esc combos or had really helpful wind/slopes. :stuck_out_tongue:

advertising at 260Wh is not correct in my books - you multiply the nominal voltage with the capacity, not full loaded cell voltage. thats because on avg, a cell will have its nominal voltage, so its 12x 3.6V x 5.2Ah = 225Wh

I agree. The cells usually drop from 4.2v to 3.6 shortly after you start riding.

@Michaelinvegas Sorry about the late reply, I'm not getting notifications for this post and I'm not seeing it on the forum unless I search for it.. It's kinda weird. (Just found this topic got switches to muted on my profile and I didn't realize)
But anyway, I'm not really getting voltage sags on this battery. It's kinda crazy because I'm so used to it for Lipos I'm expecting this to just do a hard cut off when I accelerate to hard but it just slowly goes into the cut off.

@lowGuido I was nervous about grinding a flat spot on the actual axle, so I just tightened everything very tight!
worked great for the one on the right but the left one not so much! 
Now That I know you have a flat spot I'll go ahead and file a little spot for it. And yes loctite it all!
And motor is still working perfectly! 

@Michaelinvegas ETA on batteries are late July early August, So far first batch (which I ordered  few extras also) looks on track to be shipping before August!

I have around 34-36 cycles on this one. I've been testing for a month charging/discharging every day and some days twice a day! 
Going up and down parking garages as I do not have any hills in Miami :/ and going full throttle with hubs. I have yet to go full throttle with a satellite motors as I have 250kv geared pretty low and it's over 40mph which I'm too scared to hit.

I'm sure most liion 18650s can do 1000+ but their capacity drops below 50%. Hopefully you can get to around 300 cycles and then test the battery capacity. 

Pretty awesome using cells that are uncommon on esk8. Where did you buy them?

what makes you say that? Liion lasts for as long as you want if you treat the battery well. look at teslas 8year battery warranty ...

problem might be that people always use very small batteries that live on their limit. if you have flat charge/discharge cycles, leave & store the battery around its nominal voltage whenever possible and make sure it doesnt heat up to much, it will last forever. 

my first evolve battery 1 year ago probably saw 200 cycles and recently, the guy who bought the battery, sent me a gps log that showed that the battery basically had its first day capacity.

Most 18650 Li-ion cells have about 70% capacity after 250 cycles. They may work to 1000 cycles, as you've said capacity would be severely reduced, probably more so than 50%. However, the test environment Samsung tests with discharges to 2.5v which is a lot lower than what most people normally discharge to, so you can probably make 18650's last a very long time given proper care and treatment.

I wonder if there's been any tests done to cells like these that discharge to a safer voltage like 3.0-3.2

@appelton Might be clones. I got them from FreeRCHobby when I was looking for Hubs to test out. I have hubs from them, hobbytech and lofty. 

@ArmandR Hmmm I'll go there soon!


As for battery, BMS low voltage cut off occurs when a cell hits 2.9v
However, on the optional LCD that comes with battery, 0% is displayed when cells are around 3.2v
And moreover, I recommend if your ESC's have a Low voltage cut-off to set it at 3.5v.. That is the setting I ship all my ESC's with and will keep both li-ion and lipos healthy for a long time. My MultiStar Lipos have over 200 Cycles and they still give me the same range as first day!

noone in their right mind would charge a battery to 4.2 and discharge to 2.5V. these cycles and capacity drops are NOT what you can expect in a hobby environment where you probably try to keep your batteries happy. 

look at teslas 8year warranty is all Ill say here - they have a massive battery and use it within fairly flat charge % discharge states with low current per cell that keeps it nice and cool. and thats basically all there is to the "secret of eternal liion battery life".

and thats plain wrong in my eyes! I would argue that if your batterie isnt at least at 90%+ after 200 cycles, you probably didnt treat it very well.

always keep tesla in mind: _[...] the 85 kWh Model S, our most popular model by far, now has an 8 year, infinite mile warranty on both the battery pack and drive unit._

I think people are getting very efficient in reading things nowadays - so much to read, so little time - so they go for the essentials and what "sticked" of your post was "200 cycles, 70%, 1000 cycles 50%". Im pretty convinced that the yaddayadda about factory test cycles is something that wont reach many people when the skip through this thread, or, worst case, its stored as "200 cycles 70%, confirmed by manufacturer samsung".

I just wanted to make sure that the "soak things up in 10seconds bottom line is not 200cycles 70%", but that if you treat your battery well, it will last you a very long time! :sunglasses:

@appelton the freerc ones feel the best and I feel have the higher performance. lofty is a close second. the hobbytech get slightly hotter than the rest and are slower since the kv is lower but i don't feel too much torque benefits for the lower kv.

@willpark16 battery on single 250kv has crazy range! i've got over 20mile ride on a single charge. my feet were numb! *disclaimer* I kicked off ever time i had to start, and keep relatively low speeds around 15-20mph
I usually use dual though as I prefer the even power distribution when accelerating or stopping.

You shouldn't.
I've used the same ESC now for almost a year with different batteries and motors I have gotten.
I've used it for range and speed tests. The hottest my ESC has ever gotten is about 140F. That was none stop full throttle up parking garages and braking down with single hub motor.
I was intentionally trying to heat it up as much as possible as well as test regen, and it handled everything like a champ. 

I have also hit 40+ mph but only on the dual esc and that one does not heat up at all. nothing i have tried to do on it has made it my dual motor esc break a sweat. Also i can only go 40+ for about 2-3 seconds, i start to run out of straight road.

I do not like to go over 30 with single motors because of the uneven brake/acceleration, can cause nasty speed wobbles :/

@barajabali It's great! so far still getting the same range, Im at around 70ish cycles now. I try to send them out within a week. But It takes about 4-10 days to get delivered depending where you live because it has to go by ground. Normally it is 4-5 day delivery but I had a customer, and due to bad weather it took about 10 days for him to get it.

@Adam0311 That's an awesome box man! where did you get it? I would love something like that for the kit's I got on my site!

Talk to @psychotiller AKA Dave. His website is http://psychotiller.com/products/shop
I have two of his enclosures, high quality, tough, look clean. Dave is a great guy to deal with as well.

are you still using dervish or do you prefer the vanguard loaded deck?

I prefer the vanguard. It's a lot bouncier than the dervish. 
My next board is going to be on the new Loaded Icarus, hopefully it's a good blend of both

Ahh my favorite Loaded deck. I want to get one so bad but it is so expensive. I might get a used one for around $175 but that is still expensive.

Oh No I don't have an Icarus yet! I thought the Dervish was your favorite board! I will be getting one on new years and that is when I'll be starting the build :D

You would mount like this:

Battery on the Top, all other Electronics at the bottom. Cables running through the middle to allow Flex. 
This vanguard is the 38"... The 42" Would have a little more space.

When you sell with the switch and battery % is it installed into the shrink wrap? Or can it be installed with it?
