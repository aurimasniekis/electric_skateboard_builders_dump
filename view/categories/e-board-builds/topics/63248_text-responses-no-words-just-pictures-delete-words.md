It's the most popular thread on here:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992

But if you write anything in there you are promptly chastised and your post flagged for deletion.  So I thought maybe we could use this thread to discuss the images you people are posting.

As a loose rule, if you're responding to a specific post, please be sure to link to it in your response here:

![image|690x488](upload://dlld6eXl5h7g40Ecf7H7bPPi3Ho.jpg)

And maybe also call out the poster so they can see you're talking about their photo.

So I'll start.

If I had to guess, I would say they are battery pcbs.
Same as

Better yet,  Here they are

New PCB's are up.

the .zip files have the gerbers if you want your own made.  The ESK8SQUAD PCB's are single-sided, so should be less expensive to produce.

## \#19 Posted by: Kug3lis Posted at: 2018-07-30T09:13:59.768Z Reads: 789

You can do that, or you just solder the nickel to the tabs, and then join them by wire / wire mesh. On our version you can solder a small jumper and have ribbon cable joining all pcbs to make balance wire on one end. No need for single wires all around the pack (prevents wear cut balance wire shortening in the pack or etc many fires started because of this :) )

```
The traces are 15mm wide.  These are made with 1oz copper and can handle 20A with a 15C rise in temp.  As they handle more current they will get warmer.

The first set of PCB's I made were made with 2oz copper, and they were overkill.  Also way costlier - like double the price.

It's for 8S in a column, you can have 2 x 8 rows of those pcbs and you will have 16s ;) More than enough I guess. I didn't wanted people to run cable in between columns. So you run 6 rows in 1 column and then connect two 6s to one 12s balance connector :)

I made some of these months ago before I had seen anyone posting or sharing the files for the designs they had created.  I then shared the design with the forum with the idea that people could modify or create there own designs for there own boards and share it with everyone.

Honestly, credit where credit is due on this PCB suff.

Last summer I was in NYC for MakerFaire and had my esk8squad shirt on.  Ran into @JohnnyMeduse and @Blasto and then met up with the NYC crew after, including @kaly and @mikenyc .  Had an amazing ride and stopped off at a bar to talk all things esk8.  Talked about the battery PCB idea over whiskey and how to wire it up with cell level fusing, etc.

Props to @Blasto for the original idea!  I need to update the github readme to reflect the inspiration.

@Sender My Hybrid build caught on fire. it was a balance connector on one of the batteries. One of them wouldn't charge yesterday. So I ordered a new battery to take it's place. I felt it getting warm, that was when I should have taken it out. I didn't take heed. Actually the board was inside. I had a fire extinguisher. I was over looking it while eating lunch, and it exploded right in front of me. It was like it came alive. It shot flames like a breathing dragon. scared the shit out of me. I'm glad I was there. The only thing that got damaged was the batteries and the board. Everything else survived

After soldering the wires onto the pins, I applied a small amount of silicone in between the two inner black plastic bits that hold the connector in place and then used heatshrink with a glue lining instead of the outer plastic part. Should hopefully make it pretty watertight.

3p might work if you dont want to use cell fusing, then again depending on how you do the positive leads it may be possible.

Dimensions...im on the road, but a rough dim would be 65x54 for 3p 65x72 for 4p.

@kaly has build pics, and @chaka did a whole thread on cell fusing which is the same principle.

Oh shit.
This my jam, I've been waiting for someone to bitch to about how shit some Hermes are since my girlfriends only opinion is to stop buying so much stuff online.

I've been waiting 19 days for a package from Hermes, the worst most useless courier company in the all of Germany.
My package sat at the local distribution center for 10 days with no updates.

The only contact for support is an email that gets you an automated reply or a toll number that cost .20-.60c per minute.
I have called that number 4+ times getting told BS every time totaling close to an hour of tolls for something they have screwed up in the first place.  
Only the last person was any help saying it had no reason in the system why my package was still there and he would have it looked into.
Next day it's updates to being in the delivery stage and due for delivery.  
Someone was home all day waiting and at 4:30pm the tracking gets updated to "the recipient was not available".
This mofo didn't even try to deliver the package, just pissed off and said no one was home. 
So now I need to call them again and pay even more in tolls to remind them how to do there single job.

PS. Don't send anything with Hermes Germany

In the future it will be made out of aluminium since apparently CF will hasten the corrosion of the aluminium due to galvanic corrosion.

The large circular slots around the larger hole are for mounting this thing to the truck? 

I am not going to claim that the ammount of CF is too little around that area, since im not verifying this with calculations, which I hope you guys did, but was such a large adjustment angle really needed? If these slots really are for mounting to the truck

@Okami: The plan is to make a very simple battery monitor for individual cells with uncluttered graphics.

It's meant to be something like [this](https://hobbyking.com/cz_cz/battery-monitor-2-6s.html), but:
- it will support 12s
- it will have a better display where you can see all useful info on one screen
- it will give you the "percent left"
- it will hopefully be more accurate 

It will report the strongest and the weakest cell as well as the avg voltage across all cells. IMO that's the main thing you want to know when checking that your cells are not getting out of balance and/or that your weakest cell voltage isn't below the safe value. You don't really need (or even want) to see all 12 voltage values. So I came up with this display layout that should make it possible to keep an eye on the cells even while riding (the different lengths of the bars are easy to see even from distance though the display is really tiny).

I'll create a separate thread with details later when it's finished. Don't expect anything fancy. This is a learning project for me more than anything else. I'm pretty new to electronics and I imagine that people here will find my design rather naive. I'm sure I'll get a ton of helpful feedback though, which I'm looking forward to. The design and code will be open source.

@janpom Well I hope it works out for you. It does look rather nice. I wish i had time and ability to do something similar.

Ive tried 2 types of cheapo cell meters. Both of them had flaws, like discharged cells and background light dimming with use.

Havent tried the isdt brand discharger / meter yet, these seem to be only viable ones, though price might be a bit discouraging at first.

I think its worth it, only time will tell. Technically it costs $0.8 per piece, and you use less nickel. Less spot welding required but more soldering. I didn't have much trust in my spot welder and I couldn't be bothered to to improve it, so I decided this is a better solution anyway

It seems to be pretty easy when dealing with balance wires

I guess it's just an easier platform to solder to? You attach all the batteries onto the PCB and then you can solder whatever you want onto that PCB, right? Makes sense for joining the cells with a cable rather than nickel strips.

And maybe with at thick layer of copper on the pcb (the critical serie connection) it can take a higher current, than the regular 0.15mm 10mm nickel strips, people normally would use...

Yes it can take higher current than a couple layers of nickel I assume

[quote="akhlut, post:21, topic:63248, full:true"]
The traces are 15mm wide. These are made with 1oz copper and can handle 20A with a 15C rise in temp. As they handle more current they will get warmer.

The first set of PCB’s I made were made with 2oz copper, and they were overkill. Also way costlier - like double the price.

Yeah..... Eg. a 10s5p like i have, made out of Q30, can deliver 75 amp..... And that is 75amp in the hole serie connection of the battery. So maybe with like 30mm 2 OZ traces on the pcb, this is going to be a far less bottleneck, than with the typical nickel metal setup, and maybe also less voltage sag when accelerating in favour also

Kinda ruins the pricing but it's just something we need to suck up. 

I wish I could choose courier with all vendors, you pay more for ups over usps but in the UK usps hands over to parcelforce who are utterly ridiculous. They chuck extra "admin" fees on at a whim and hold your parcel for ages before sending out a letter to pay and then arranging a delivery. This got into the UK 9 days ago and in the end I just drove 30 mins to the depot and collected it. The extra charges, disruption and generally full week added on to every deliver make the added few dollars of ups delivery seem like nothing.

Well taking this particular situation into account. There's import duty to pay, which I expect when importing products, fair enough. But the delivery company has added £17 in fees on top which are non negotiable and mandatory. Other companies do not do this. They are the preferred partner for USPS deliveries coming in to the country.

As far as NHS goes, there's a separate tax for that out of our monthly pay and personally, coming from a non national health country with US style insurances and all the bullshit and dependency that comes from it, I'm super duper happy to pay it every month and know that whatever happens to me I'm covered, in the best care possible and valued as a human being and not a commodity.

Tldr: Delivery company sucks balls, NHS is the tits

someone posted a pic of blue orangatang caguama wheels, these are not available yet, supposed to be released next week or some crap.

so then someone was asking for source of these wheels via a counter strike image.

[quote="DeathCookies, post:276, topic:63248"]

[/quote]

Because the deck flexes and a 30° gets 35° once you step on the board. 
The old wooden boards had 15° and that caused poor steering. 
If you make wooden decks with low ply counts and cheap veneer you can't bend it to 30°. 

@skunk Experimenting with it is fine. I just would not put to much effort/money in it. Check if you can get replacement bushings for the trucks. Once they are worn you need to be able to get replacement parts. 
These hubs tend to brake sooner than later, so you need to be careful with them. The material is brittle.
I would try to get different hubs. Otherwise you end up with a pulley that you can't fit to new hubs once you need them. If the tires are as old as the board, the material has probably aged to much.

Thanks for that. I will.

I just finished it and realized I don’t have the right size heatshrink. The one I ordered was for a single layered cell which was what I was going for at first but changed my mind. 

So good you mentioned the fish paper for I probably would have forgotten to use that since my mind is with the heatshrink. Also first time I used balance nickel strips. Last battery I soldered on top of the cell and I wanted to avoid that this time since my soldering skills aren’t the best.

“Omg is @Kug3lis building a jet turbine?!”

Hmm, press to turn on, press and hold to turn off, push to start without any additional wires, 80V, 4 different price points 50-200A, alu heatsink 30x53 size and one mistery function for later reveal.:smiley:

Oh most important pre-charge via resistor so maximum 40A @ 80V not 1.5kA like typical turn on. You can use any amount of capacitance of capacitors as I am hardware limited inrush current. Not by delaying turn on by slowly rising voltage on Mosfet gate. So mosfets work in their normal condition not critical.

EDIT if not using PST u can use until maximum of mosfet voltage rating 100V but I doubt someone even need 80V apart me

Yes, and it still tests and modifies the gear drive

The drive is constantly evolving 
The changes are seemingly small, but I strive for the ideal

how you get such a long range out of your pack?
you use 21700 cells, or that´s because of the gear drive?
For me it sounds crazy good and very light too!

and one more question:
your gear drive for pneumatics, for which hanger you plan to create it?

Now builds gear drives for Evolve truck, maybe next year will build a drive for other trucks, Now I have other priorities

I hope that with the 10S10P package I will be able to drive a distance of 100km on pneumatic wheels 
, and a distance of 160km on urethane wheels

That is insane, your average Wh must be around 6Wh/km to achieve that distance. 

Great work!

Yes.

The large range is the effect of using a gear drive

Other board components are standard

Racestar 140kV Motors, (the cheapest engines I have found)
ESC Turnigy SK8 (VESC 4.12)
18650 10S4P Samsung 30Q batteries
Of course, I drove the distance of 70 km through at the low speed of 20-25 km

20-25km is still an easy cruise speed and the 70km with such a pack impressive as for me.
when you all sorted out, I hope you will give us an opportunity to get one or two of your drive trains ;)

My belt drive gets 8,3 Wh/km @ 25 km/h and 7,1 Wh/km @ 20km/h

Hope to beat your numbers with my geared drive :grin: , I may have to loose a little weight in the process

100 km range with 10S5P at a reasonable speed would be amazing, I could visit some nearby towns and get back in one charge

Deck is Landyacht Swith Owl 40. 
The wheels and hubmotors are 105mm from Skullboard. Little bit of Vibration absorption but the real improvement is the grip. Just as sticky as pneumatics. 
Dual Focbox via Canbus.
Firefly remote.

Yeah esk8 controller 1.1 which I bought last summer. 
I'm running 130kv motors in FOC without problems (FW3.38) and they stay cool. I think the secret is not to exceed 60A (motor + batt max), that's what Attila told me.

I set 55A motor max and 45A batt max each vesc (with 6355 motors). When applying full throttle there is a consumption of 100A motor and 50A battery (both vescs together). Amazing is that when constantly cruising at about 20-25km/h I only need 10A battery with Trampa Gummies.

long story short, I created UNiK 3 years ago to release this exact specific board with the deck hand made in south france, by a shaper, with my signature mounts with crossbar. Then I went to create all kind of stuff, test all kind of boards, supporting different brands and giving them exposure, not for money or special interest but mainly because I like to ride different things. 

I'm participating to a town fair soon and I prepared two UNiK boards and I rode them today. I was like... wow. That's really insane and was like... what did I do in 3 years. So I'm gonna focus more on these little jewels. The board is really a top ride and I forgot how good it is.

I'm also gonna work on the website to make it more product driven, too much confusion right now on the identity of products. So expect more footage with this dual crazy board soon.

6600 lumen each. They make the night a day. We connected them straight to the main battery using a suitable voltage step down converter to bring down the 50V from the battery to the input voltage of the LED light (8V). The cables are integrated into the deck on this built. 
Depending on the situation, you can switch on one or two headlights. Each of them has 3 brightness levels to choose from and a strobe. 
Sometimes we ride through the woods in the night, and good light helps....

We us ethis powerful light away from roads. It's to bright for road usage. Since these are LEDs, power consumption is very reasonable, so you can hook it up to the battery. I didn't measure the exact Amp draw.
Our step down converter can handle quite a few Amps and it doesn't get warm.

I've been working with my father this summer to build an integrated deck similar to what chaka does with his free ride decks. The aim is to offer something sleek and elegant but also a high quality product with a lot of flexibility when building. 

Its as thick as it needs to be +-25mm (+1.2mm lid) and as light as possible. The raw deck (without lid) weighs 1.95kg. 

The focus of this board are obviously builders like us so it can take up to 4 motors and has room for up to a 12s4p battery on a dual config. 

The pockets are 22.5mm deep and 76mm wide. This allows even NESE modules to be fitted in. 

The aim is to build it water resistant with a gasket that goes on the lid. 

The lid will be either alu or a industlial glass fiber composite and will be cut in 3 pieces (2 small ones at the ends and a big one in the centre). That will allow to service the board without having to unscrew the trucks. 


There are more details to come that I will put on a dedicated thread once we've got a finalised prototype in about 10 days...

Please keep it up for another couple years so that when I do finally have the additional expendable income I can do just that... Build a board with all your parts. Jeeeeee-berz!!!! It's all way WAY sexy! 

Regarding the riser in particular, exactly what you did is what *needed* to happen.

Well, it's for our test board as I will be coming back home to make test drive videos with both urethane and pnuemies so we wanted to just swap hanger for different drive version. So quick disconnect is required

I love this deck.  It's not the longest in my arsenal by any stretch but it's still 38 in, and I can still use the kicktail well. I'm really not a huge fan of kicktails, but I like this one. 

I really wanted the rum runner, but I got a great deal in the hooch (100 bucks off) so I took it. Glad I did.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/6964?u=skatardude10 

The white stuff on the wheel gear is Teflon. Both gears are heavily dry-lubed.

Today I took the PETG motor gear on PETG wheel gear out for some torture testing... paths with small sized gravel bits, soft and hard pack sand paths, soft and hard pack dirt paths, paths with medium to large size gravel chunks, short grass, tall grass, through tons of twigs, etc... I've not ridden my board this hard or taken it that much off-road ever. I always get little pebbles stuck in my belts or wedged in the pulley teeth after maybe 30 seconds anywhere offroad, but the gears held up great after a *lot longer* than 30 seconds. I also tried stopping and accelerating at a range of speeds as hard as I could. 

I would say, besides the thing being extremely dirty, it held up structurally better than I expected. It was printed with 6 walls and 100% infill. Despite hearing what sounded like cracking maybe twice, I can't see any structural integrity issues and I am guessing it was probably the set screws / insert hex nuts re-positioning against the plastic inside the pulley under heavy torque loads. 

Regardless, the PETG on PETG gears were **LOUD**, despite trying a range of backlash from tight to loose. So, I've re-printed the motor gears in nylon, and heavily teflon lubed both the motor and wheel pulleys. Now, its not very loud... at least not obnoxious- i'd say it's on par with other gear drives i've heard at this point, and the free-roll is GREAT! I was able to take the nylon on PETG gears out tonight and I can't see any negatives... the thing works *great* from what I can tell, sounds great, feels great, doesn't skip... and I trust the nylon will hold up as nylon has never failed me on anything, I beefed up the gear a bit to 26mm width, *and* added a tooth reinforcement ring on one side (so I can still slide the wheel on and off opposite to the reinforcement).  

Once the other tire/motors gears get setup (right now I am running one side belted and one side geared), I will have a total of 52mm in length of gear tooth in contact at any one time... should gears be this wide? I don't know, but I am assuming it's going to hold up just fine in the long run. 

Also, this is my first time riding geared... OMG! The feeling of instantaneous skip-free high torque transfer is *INSANE*... combined with an increase in gear ratio from my belt setup, it just feels supernatural being able to just stand on my board... hit the throttle and literally spin out the pneumatic tires under my feet on smooth concrete (or anywhere for that matter... watching dirt spit out 5 feet behind me... *creaaaammmmms pants*)... I am in love I tell you.

Oh, and I don't have $1K to spend on proper gear setups so, for $10 or so in materials/electricity this is for sure the next best thing.

 i wonder what has stopped others from doing the same.. do u have much higher tier printer and others just cant print nylon/ petg as well?

Anyways nice job.. durability test would probably be the ultimate test but maybe it is possible to get motor gear out of metal, if that is the case at all

Yes, regarding wheel hubs I lied a bit those models have different hole pattern. I asked to see if its possible to make them same as 3.75" wheel hubs it will fck up design a bit as bolts will be near center but will work out of the box for all superstar mounting options.

Regarding when probably in 2-4 weeks :)

Stability primarily. I wanted no vibration from them while riding. Also they have cleaning brush slots to prevent debris from getting in between the wheel and fender...

Glad the deck broke and not me after crashing into a rail in skatepark. Seems I'm the first who managed to brake it :laughing: and I get a replacement deck! The front truck is destroyed, too. Totaly my fault, lesson learned, don't ride in skateparks at night and wear more protectors than helmet and gloves only.

I noticed the mounts too but to be fair the guy in the second picture does need to take off the air monarchs and put on some skate shoes.  For all the cool shit that eskating is doing there is one guy in air monarchs bring it down and making eskating not cool

Thanks. At this point there are a few changes that still *need* to be made, but one thing I'd really like to change is to increase the clearance between the ground and the bottom of the assembly somehow, ideally without removing screws. We will see. It needs a few other improvements here and there.

Went to the doctors and yea turns out there’s a small visible bone in there 😂 she fixed it up also said although it looks bad nothing serious and I should heal up quickly. 
Tho this is the second time I mess up my hands. Helmet is a must but when these scars disables you seems like proper gloves are a must too. My threshold will be gloves knee pads and helmet from now on and may be elbow pads 😝

Being cool is not the point of Esk8. I don’t have skate shoes just for Esk8 since only the bottom touches the grip tape there isn’t much wear. 

Don’t get me wrong, those are some ugly shoes, but I’m guilty of being dirt cheap on wardrobe

Are the tabs going to be able to handle any flex to the deck? Can they be rotated to some degree to prevent bending from flex?
```

---
## \#630 Posted by: mishrasubhransu Posted at: 2018-09-26T02:43:31.242Z Reads: 229

Okay, so basically this is the plan. Once you have 10 modules in place, solder and join the tabs using a 10 gauge flexible silicone wire/ braided copper wire. Then you fold all the tabs into the form shown.

The flexible silicone wire should provide all the flex necessary.

So it is not going to be completely solderless in its present state.

Also, I forgot to put the standoffs and the bolts in the render

@b264

Is this yours? I think you should solder the balance lead on a nickle tab and then spot weld it on so that it sits on top of the pack and not in between the two rows or on the sides. that's asking for trouble

To be honest it does drive me nuts. I was just at a wedding this weekend and I think I was the only one who got videos horizontally. It got even worst when they tried to take a huge group photo with their phone and started backing up to get us in frame...vertically :man_facepalming:

I got kinda pissed when YouTube added an option to watch videos full screen vertically. Talk about being an enabler!

I'm using an Sk3 on my board now and it seems like they are one of the better motors out there, if they just came from HK with these mods already they would probably make a killing.

They really should do that lol

I wonder if the factory is good quality or if HK are just strict on what they sell and only sell the "good" motors and then just not sell the bad ones. There are very few complaints with these motors, considering how many people use them

[quote="moon, post:685, topic:63248"]
is the extended shaft needed?
[/quote]

I just got the sensorless 168kvs from HK.

As far as i know on a 20mm pulley, with thick chunky mounts it could do with a couple of mm, its short just under 4mm from being flush but its not critical as the pulley rim is one mm and the belt sits one mm in-ish from that.

Mobius Actioncam. It's setup for 1080p @30fps with a 135 degree fisheye lens (eBay sourced) right now. The housings are custom and 3D printed and there's about 15" of extension wire to the camera module from the PCB. Video is great in regular light but gets a little funny when it's dark. I'll see if I can load up a ride video in a bit.

It does come with an internal camera module, but it's very easily removable and extendable. I own the wide angle version "B" lens. There are both 8" and 2" - 26pin extension cables available for purchase the original Mobius Actioncam, though Mobius doesn't recommend more than 8" of extension as the signal can suffer.  I also purchased the bigger 820mah battery for the setup, and re-positioned the battery above the PCB housing on the back of the helmet to keep it low-profile.  I unfortunately didn't take any pre-build photos.  Someone made a pretty good SW replica of the camera assembly which I utilized and modified for my 3D printed housings. 

Edit, the wide angle lens I had to take measurements and rebuild from scratch.

It's really not that flexy, considering its short 19in wheelbase. Also there's a stiff version with 6mm (i think) of CF, coupled with the enclosure, you get a really stiff setup (especially when I only weigh 75kgs) :smile: 

The overall design of the deck is pretty amazing, i actually love it alot, been wanting to get it for 2 years and finally did it haha. The eboosted enclosures for the 12s4p vanguard works perfectly on it too. :slight_smile:

I designed them and had them machined in 7075 T6 Al. Had Titanium studs made, and fitted them with Ti Nylocs too. I had to get a few sets made to keep the price down. I've got a few left if interested. Let me know if you would like more photos.

I came up with these wheels for myself, to fit my Evolve CGT, I’ve yet to attempt a self-build, but love checking out what everyone else is up to, and one day I’ll probably have a crack.

I set myself the challenge of coming up with the best wheels possible, (and in a slightly bourgeois sense) money being no object, I didn’t want to compromise on anything.

To just do 1 set was a ridiculous price so I got a handful of each colour done, that way I could choose a few sets and release the rest to other like-minded Riders.

The wheels are CNC machined from 7075 T6 aluminium billet, (removing 78% of the stock in the process) media blasted and anodised. The Studs are Grade 2 Titanium along with the Nylocs being in the same material. The counterweights, (for the Valve) are 304 Grade Stainless Steel, and the bearings are Bones.

I’ve had the wheels sitting about since January, and thought I better do something about letting others enjoy them too.

Price wise I’d like to see my money back and cover the cost of the two sets I’m keeping, but they weren’t cheap to make, and numbers are limited. I doubt anyone will ever offer such a product again, as there was never any kind of financial justification to produce them, (I just wanted to).

So what will 8 pieces of highly machined aerospace alloy and titanium cost, AUD420 + Registered Postage, (and believe me this is cost + 2 sets)

Assembly is required, though all parts are included except the Loctite Bearing Retaining Compound.

It was a 3 part print. The connections were physical connections using two opposing bolt holes for a secure hold. I used acrylic cement to melt them together (mostly acetone) since it was made of E3d edge (Pet+).

After that the print was pretty rough. Lots of sanding (6 layer wall thickness, no concerns of breaking through). Lots of bondo, sanding, more bondo, etc...

Eventually it was silky smooth, no print lines, no seams. After that I used 2 coats of rust-oleum grey primer, and finished with a few coats of matte black, no sanding between layers.

It uas advanced avoidance protection AI.  It sees 3 seconds into the future and takes necessary evasive action based off of user skill level to arrive at the least injurious outcome.  Next level.

But seriously, when you get it in hand, it becomes quite apparent that it is definitely a step above... if not a few steps above.  I want to do some more testing now that I have it on my daily rider. I will write up a review soon.

Sorry @psychotiller, I kinda destroyed(aesthetics wise, functionally still awesome) your enclosure. I wish you had an enclosure for these kind of aggressive decks, but there are just too many boards out there and I realize you can't make moulds for all of them.  

Basically I made 3 mm holes at regular interval on the enclosure perimeter. Fix one of the ends of the board with wood screws. Take a heat gun, make the plastic pliable. Make it conform to the deck. Secure it with more wood screws. move on to the next section and so on.

@mmaner I think it’s an odd shape without actual feature. they should’ve made it a bit thinner, not with bamboo, move all the leds and buttons to the edges. Then add Velcro to the palm side to make this a sliding puck with the other half the shell replaceable as it wears down. Then a puck shaped remote would be awesome...I’d pay $150 for that.

I find it pretty comfortable. But being able to slide a remote would be undeniable cool.  But I still feel like they are bringing a cool new product to the table that is worth the price tag.

Is it for everyone? Of course not... but  on all these awesome builds people are coming out with, the extra expense of this top tier remote is worth it and will be noticed. 

 I mean hell, this is their round 1?!? 

Let's support them and see what else they can do!

But it's not protecting anything... a BMS is designed to do this from the start... all you're doing is making the BMS less efficient and eating up space on your board...

Sorry, I should have actually gave you a reason why im doing it.   Its because im merging lipo packs together without actually opening them up.   so to merge 2 6s batteries together into a 6s2p you need to merge the balance connectors together.  but if they are even slightly out of balance between the two cells being merged, then one cell will try to charge the other, which would definitely push more amps than the battery can take for charging.

Then you need to put those resistors between the cells being linked in parallel on the two packs, not to the BMS. 

Since you're using LiPos, charging the packs with the same balance charger will be sufficient when going to connect them in parallel. Just check the cell voltages with a meter and make sure they are +/- 0.05V and you shouldn't have any issues

Well that isn't going to do anything with the resistor... current is going to flow the path of least resistance...

![Screenshot_20181008-092303_Samsung%20Internet|690x337](upload://iQIId7KXyAsm8ZVv1q9Ens4vftQ.jpeg) 

I personally wouldn't use the resistor at all:

![Screenshot_20181008-092229_Samsung%20Internet|690x336](upload://v0UO0GmJftT9Rmj4FMtP2kp4w3l.jpeg) 

But if you feel you must use the resistors, dedicate one pack to be your "Master" where it has direct wiring to the BMS and then branch all "Slave" packs off of it in parallel using the resistors...

Keep in mind that these are first impressions.  I tossed on a half helmet and took it for a spin around the neighborhood for 30 minutes.  Not even gloves - stupid.  Anyway, the board itself feels great - completely locked-in with some flex for my fat ass.

First issue - I thought the board would be stiffer, a lot stiffer.  @treenutter how hard would it be to add an extra ply or two to a 44?  I'm fat (working on it), and wasn't anticipating the flex.  I bet I would flex a 44 like a CHAMP.  It's not a complaint - I like the flex, makes the board super comfy to ride.  But too much flex might be a problem.

Every time I twitch the enclosure creaks, LOUDLY.  

SUPER.

ANNOYING.

Honestly that's my only complaint.  Went and installed a foam gasket onto the bottom of the board. Hopefully this simple fix will eliminate the nearly constant creaking.  I won't know until next week as the board is packed for Vegas.

Trucks are fun.  The board is more maneuverable and responsive than I'm used to.  I need to deaden the rear a little more and tighten up the bushings on the front.  Riptide Krank FTW!  Shoutout to @Alphamail!  I might machine some aluminum washers to apply a more even force on the bushings instead of a hex-head bolt.

Need to cut a set of braces for the deck, and I also have to make a set of rubber risers for the adjustable TKP.  Got my hands on some 40A rubber - nice and soft.  I have a little bit of time, but I have some jobs that need to get done as well.  

Added some lucid grip to the deck.  Really like it.  I wish the frit was black, but maybe the next coat.  Shit wears off pretty quickly, but maybe it's just me.

Drive train feels solid.  @Jlabs modular pulleys are the best I've ever used.  Worth every penny.  They seem to be purpose-built for Surf Rodz.  Can't see myself using anything else from this point forward.  Need to grab some 40T and 36T pulleys for science.

The @torqueboards 6380's are so sweet I don't think I can go back to single drive after this.  It's almost too much.  The raw, unrestrained power is intoxicating and terrifying all at once.  I want to punch the accelerator and see how fast I can go, but that reptilian hindbrain makes me take my finger off the trigger.  Probably for the best until I get to know how it will react.  Also, the breaks.  Holy shit, the breaks are...insane.  They're no longer a safety feature.  It's like the board is thinking 'Don't tap the breaks asshole, I'm just gonna street your stupid face if you do.'  

I need to open it up and take pics to show how it was made (build thread at some point), but there's no real mystery here - it's just an eskate.

Side note: I've only ever ridden VESC's that I've built, and always used Vedder's FW.  Riding a FOCBOX with 
@Ackmaniac FW was...interesting.  6380's purred in BLDC instead of screaming.  Not better, not worse, but noticeably quieter.  I kinda miss the whine of the motor - maybe it will come back when I'm peeling the paint off my TSG at 40mph.

Some nylon washer between the fender washers and the enclosure may help too.  My Lacroix creaks too, but this does help.  I think it is the nature of flex.  Gonna be a little creaky. How is the enclosure holding up?

That's an interesting idea.  It's not the enclosure against the deck, but rather the washers rubbing.  I'll grab some washers from mcmaster and bring them with.  

Other than that the enclosure is GREAT!  It's stiff AF, but flexes and conforms to the deck  really nicely.  Totally lucked out with where I drilled the holes for the charge port and loop key.  

Also, I was marking the enclosure up to add a battery meter and i was using a sharpie.  didn't like where the line was and I couldn't get it off.  Figured I'd use the dry erase marker to go over it and remove the sharpie.  WRONG!  Dry erase marker ate the finish right off.  FML.  It's not a big spot, but I'm going to see it every damn time I look at the enclosure.

Hi guys,
I posted a photo of my Trampa with concave and I'd like to create a topic to show you how I did it but it looks like I'm not able to create a topic. Do you know why? Thx!

Evo deck, 10s4p 30q, racerstar 5065 200kv, evolve trucks and mounts, boardbumpers bearing adapter, trampa urban treads, 15T motor gear 66T wheel gear. Rides like a tank. IMO don't use the evolve trucks I have them wedged as if you don't the front truck will be slanted and lean down. They're super wobbly at speed and really high up with this setup. I have TB 218 trucks on order and plan to switch to dual 6374 190kv maytechs.

Looks good so far. Made something the same for my focboxes and wanted to design it for my Flipsky too. Just didn’t had a time yet.
So very cool that you made one 👌
To seal the heatsink with silicone works fine for my focboxes, so that‘s should work with yours too.
Did I understood it right, the pcb is fixed only with one of the three screws to the holder?
If you designed it for mtb‘s to be mounted on top than don’t forget there is a receiver and a Bluetooth module which need a space too.
Would be nice if that could be stored inside too.

Just as constructive feedback 😉
Ah and you forgot a H in the thingiverse titel.🤓

:relaxed: .... :laughing: ... :rofl:!!! older ... hahahha thanks a lot Andy for your time and the feedback !! I will make the correction ^^

In fact actually, the pcb isn't fixed at all ... I was thinking tight fit, but you right, I will need more precise modeling for this, I will try to take time this WE for that for sure with the 3 screws to old it properly. Hold it, sorry :smile:

But it is temporary, I will maybe make a new dual heatsink and go!

Nice build. Btw your 6 shooters are on backwards. The tread pattern is designed to scoop water from the center of the wheel and push it out the sides as it rolls. the way you have it, it will scoop up water from the sides and bring it towards the center of the tire and that's an accident waiting to happen. Just swap your wheels from left to right.

Hah just made an enclosure for strapping on batteries too.  Ones I had done previously to allow them to slide in and out were too hard to print and would break over time from use.  Using some backpack buckles/straps rated for 200lbs so I can pop the enclosed lipos off and throw a new set on more easily for extended trips or charging while riding.

Construction has its weaknesses, and vibrations will kill them in no time. 

However, I dissected them and soldered wires to the small pcbs behind the led, put two in series and connected to a 5v power bank. 

Lights are rated for a maximum of 3,7v each.

@Mikenopolis

I have not had any issues with dual mount old version of Marc’s mounts. Is it the older version? Believe marc updated his mounts to include a cross bar.

 I did have some issues with TB reverse mounts, not the fixed ones. The TB reverse mounts work good after torque and loctite.

 my Marc mounts were probably the old stuff, aluminum seems a bit soft, I use blue loctite, torqued it down and let it cure for two days...more like a week before my weekend test ride and it still shifted angles. I just sold it after the TB V5 with cross bars were out.

Dude not to be a dick but you built something incredibly dangerous.  Soldering high gauge wire directly to what I'm going to assume are salvaged cells has SEVERELY degraded the internal composition of the cells. If you ride that, understand there is an incredibly HIGH RISK those cells will COMBUST and EXPLODE. Do not ride that pack, you will get hurt.

@Grozniy @Sender firstly, thanks.... But secondly... It's just a cheap injection molded plastic enclosure from diyeboard. I vinyl wrapped it with matt grey so it looks metal, but that's about it.

@Sender indeed ! This whole build costs less than a couple of focboxs and a set of ABEC 107s, including a 10s3p battery and esc. I'm under no illusions about the performance of this thing, but should be fine for my 14yr old son as an introduction to esk8. No way am I letting him on my proper DIY at his age ! 

@Grozniy there's no real need as the enclosure doesn't form any part of the board structure. The deck is plenty stiff enough - plus now has the look of a carbon board for just a few $$ 😁

I wanted the enclosure to look like metal, and from a short distance it really does ! 😂👍

For the most part its not all that special as i still havent gotten around to making a custom lion pack.

but at the moment its a 12S 18'000Mah pack on the bottom, with the top third being all the electronics.
Including:

*  2x Vesc6
* 12S 300A BMS
* dual band failsafe w/ redundancy antenna
* 20A BEC w/ 2 usb ports for phone/dildo charging
* obvious inbuilt heatsink  13Kw Tdp
* Multi KV motors for unique torque acceleration profile (max effective geared speed 60mph)
* fully 3d printed enclosure, angle brackets, and motor mounts. (see [yin-yang](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/yin-yang-3d-printed-dual-mtb-motor-mounts-development/43438) mounts for more details)
* Headlights and rear break/indicators/turning signals

A decent bit of the electronics enclosure is wasted space in case I want to add more stuff, but also a decent bit is the heat sink to transfer heat from the bms and vesc's outwards.

Exactly.  one motor is wound to have a very low kv (something like 120 ish) and the other is wound to about 200Kv.  with gears matched for each motor, it lets both have the same max speed. but their torque profiles at those speeds are vastly different.   Im hoping it would mean amazing performance. I just haven't tested it yet ;/

Edit ;
My motors are different models, so kv differs a bit although both are officially 190kv. One is geared 15/40, other is 16/38. Top speed differs by 0,5 km/h. Can't notice any weirdness, but never tried dual (diagonal) with exact same motors, so I don't know what I'm missing.

Look for files called mk2_seg_part1.stl, mk2_seg_part2.stl and mk2_seg_part3.stl.

I can very easily modify the shape of the overlapping parts. Let me know if you want it with any other shape or enclosure length. I'll test and release a version soon that will have intermediate parts printed in flexible filament(TPU) to give it a lot more flex. BTW, I am printing the parts in PETG.

I got 4x HP CC09 laptop battery packs. I have found quite a few discarded, recycled laptop batteries that had good cells, but only about 50% were good enough to be usable. These were a different story...

These CC09 packs, every P group (3x per pack, 4 packs) was exactly 3.67v or so... it's almost like these were never used. 6A max charge, 6A max discharge... not the best for eskate but perfect to increase capacity on my range extender. They are 3S3P per pack, and I am just keeping the 3P spot welds in tact.

Either way, yeah... I found them in a discard pile somewhere. In general, i've just been keeping my eyes peeled for discarded battery packs. I have too many batteries now, not just these.

I’m thinking about recycling some laptop cells to make a range extended to put in my back pack. Only problem is the cost of buying new cells that are only gonna be used for 1-2c max, it just doesn’t make sense.

So far the best options are what you have done and recycle old packs or use hoverboard packs, they are $50 or about $2.50 AUD a cell here in Aus

Yep, true all that. The only brand new cells I have found that may be worth it (as in basically free/super cheap without finding recycled packs) is the 1.5AH kobalt 24v power tool battery pack... samsung 15Ls, which are rated for 15 amps- they come in a pack of 6 in series... and my local lowes has them listed for $10 on the shelf, but they always ring up $16.83 or something like that and I say *no no no, they were listed for $10*... hopefully that lasts until I can buy up a bunch of them for some project at some point. 

I tried the big backpack pack. I got my board all wired up for it to just plug in, I think my 6S bestech BMS discharge limit of 10A is not enough, because it eventually stops charging until I let it rest for a bit, thinking maybe it is getting too hot and it cuts off. The nice thing about the $10 kobalt packs is that, you get not only 6 new samsung 15A discharge cells, but also a nice case you can build off of and a BMS for charge/discharge built in. I will be soldering all these cells to one of those, the kobalt charger charges *fast*... in the end, a 6S4P battery with 10AH / 226wh for $10... I hope this works.

I made my battery out of broken e bike batteries that i got for free from my local bikeshop. They have pretty great discharge (around 10a) generally and one e bike battery contains about 40 18650 cells, but maybe this is only a viable option for areas with lots of e bikes (in the Netherlands their insanely popular) 

If you can pickup the bosch battery packs that’s the way to go. I got three of them and the bms was busted on all but the batteries were all great

Use 60t for regular 2wd use but I'm going to use the 42t with my 4wd build. 

16 motor and 42t pulley on the 6 shooter should get me about 50mph on 12s

@Michaelinvegas is Tishawn on the forum? He basically got me in to all of this on a roundabout route. I saw a video of him weaving around esk8 veterans who thought they were going fast while filming and looking like a badass 😁

I got myself a ks 16s to bomb around on for a couple of months but in the end the skate allure and diy scene got me hooked. 

Also, he has such a sweet style on his UC and I looked like a complete penis floating through life haha.

Tishawn if you read this, thanks bud. :call_me_hand:

I got pulled over and was handed a fine. Basically for driving a motorized vehicle without a licence plate. Which should be close to €400,- :zipper_mouth_face:

I was wearing a helmet, showed my shredlights, gave some arguments about leaving the car at home and German law. Which is like our bigger brother in the EU. But he just told me he was gone write me a ticket and had to call some fellow officers to ask what actual ticket he needed to write. I was polite during the entire encounter and answered all questions fairlyish (speed). To no avail as he happily continued to write the ticket.

Im not going to guess about how your legal system works, so take what I say with more salt than some gamers I know. but if you had previous encounters and they didn't mention it, you can get the charge dropped to a warning for this single time, as you were under the impression it was ok.

Sux so bad that the lazy regulators could not be bothered to make a new rule for these things so they are like, well that is just a car with no licence, we are going to inforce and punish to the full extent of the law anyone we find doing this. Even though in reality it's not even close to a car. So many countries have this approach its embarrassing to the whole human race!!!!

I believe it was in Den Haag. 

I was stopped once too on my commute from Rotterdam to Delft and well basically I had to stop for the cattle grate and a motorcycle cop was appearently chasing me and caught up when I stopped for it. 
I was surprised to see him. 
He said I was on an uninsured motor vehicle and asked if I made it. I explained to him that I use it for commute and follow the rules and told him bikers even go faster than 25 and they aren’t insured but it did not matter it was still illegal. 
He said he could confiscate the board but instead he will turn around and continue his traffic stop rounds and warned me that if I were stopped again that they could take the board. 

This guy luckily enough was chill to let me be and I thanked him and went ahead on the board to work. 

The cops are in their complete right and it is our own risk to continue.

Yep, basically I have it cadded up similar to this arrangement below. The render files are in a different computer, but I'll post it tomorrow. 

The discs and brake assembly are from ali-express. Basically the ones they put on scooters. I have plans to distribute the braking force between this and the motors using the receiver firmware. Eventually implement ABS as well.

do you really need a clutch?
why not just use a one direction bearing. I dont know the english term but in german it is like a freewheel with backspin lock (freilauf mit rücklaufsperre: http://www.aunds-vertrieb.de/ein-einblick-in-unser-portfolio/freilaeufe-ruecklaufsperren/) , looks like a bearing but only acts like a bearing in one direction. So the motor can only accelerate and is on freewheel if it would brake e.g. your car starter uses one of that.

next step is from Dr. @treenutter; I'm to take a nail and scratch a Falcon to see if it can be sanded and stained.  

if so, these will surely be the nicest-finished Flytraps ever made.

talking with a couple of artists now to create the vector that we can take to a graphics shop to screen the art (cannot do the logo).

I offered up $200 just to see what would happen; 37 replies, 2 look good, 1 real artist with product management experience whom I can have a conversation with (and he sent in a real PM quote to match haha).

![54%20PM|690x347](upload://infFWfhmhBpIkemlLp9s5cm6VA0.png)  

If the prototypes work out, they'll be on eBay at a starting bid of a penny, all proceeds to the charities above.  The art will be given to the community freely, just as we all talked about earlier.  

I put it in the contract, actually.  

The file to make a flytrap tat is our gift to the world :) 

I realize this isn't the electric-skateboard artists forum so apologies to any volt heads.  You guys inspired this idea, and I think with all the attention Loaded / Orangatang is getting for their business, some of that attention can be diverted towards a higher cause this holiday season.  

Thank you for your inspiration, as always bud.

I paid 105 USD unit cost for four of them, plus 53 in shipping (I was impatient) and 33 in paypal / conversion fees. So 506 overall.

Bulk orders are down to 88 USD per unit.

However, I'm gonna have to be in talks with these guys. They don't appear to be experienced in selling motor controllers, especially in this use case. Notice the lack of adhesive on the capacitors, yet it's on the phase wires.

The heat sink looks really weird too. The blue is VERY thin and the aluminum plate is kinda odd, considering that just sits on top of the main case with no additional interface material.

I'm, gonna have to request they use a thicker thermal pad that goes straight to the main case, and use glue on the caps. Unit price could go up or down, not sure. There's a few things they're wasting money on, like a champher on the backside of the aluminum case. I'll try and talk to them.. They haven't sold many of the vesc6, they don't really market it. They have however sold a 4.12 version with success, i'm guessing on Alibaba.

How well is that boost converter working out for you? I had that one before my current boost converter... I think I might have shorted it, but regardless it didn't work out for me too well. I probably fucked it up though doing something stupid.

I am in the process of making a pack out of 18650s for boosting to charge voltage on the go, and wiring up a low voltage alarm like you have instead of using my 10A BMS for discharge since it keeps cutting out on me during discharge (assuming because it's over 10A load when discharging to my boost converter). I'll be wiring up my BMS for charge only... But other packs going into my boost converter for charging on the go is *great*! Infinite range basically, as long as I take a few moments to rest periodically. Now you gotta find a way to mount that pack to your board and make it all hot-swappable with additional packs 😎

Are you boosting voltage with a boost converter or just building to the same voltage as your board? I can't wait to see the insides man, I'm in the process of fasioning a 400wh pack myself to boost up to 42v, enclosed in the same spot on the board as yours... Just waiting to see if any of the cells I've chosen are self discharging.

I’m not sure if you’ve tested the pack yet but I’m not sure if you will actually get 4a out of it. I have a similar set up and use a 22v power supply through a boost converter to charge my 12s pack and anything less than about 20v only lets me charge at around 2a. I’m not sure if that’s got something to do with physics or if maybe my psu just can’t handle the amps to be able to boost the voltage that much and supply high amps. Let me know how it goes this could be good for my 10s board

Any pointers as to how to get this out? I think I'll just use a new bolt every time I take one out. It had just pulled this bolt out to adjust after putting on a different pulley and belt, head broke off when I went to tighten it back up

Such a cool story here. I'm a field based account manager and I found this in one of my accounts basement this morning. Apparently it's been there for years, some guy was working on it and then abandoned it there and left.

I was talking to the manager about my board because we're always representing aaaay :call_me_hand: he said he had this thing downstairs did I want to have a look.

The quality of this thing is impressive and there isn't a spot of rust on it. Found the "batteries" nearby in a canvas sack and it was rough haha. Three scooter starter style lead acids. Whoever had that between their legs was brave. 

There's a seat, spare wheels and frame.

I'll knock up a battery, figure out that motor and throttle and whack an esc on it. Even the routed wiring is well done.

He's told me a few times that these are gonna be THE urethane wheel of choice over abec,boa,o-tangs when they finally come out.
Definitely get in on pre order.
From what I've heard they've worked really hard in R&D to get these made right.
@torqueboards  really seems to be pushing for better products for us.

I run skate bearings all the time in saltwater.  It snows and they throw salt all over the road, and that doesn't mean I can magically not need to work or go grocery shopping :smirk:  I can magically decide not to go to the bar or poker room, though

You just change them when they become shit

But cars drive through that all the time and their bearings don't squeak and get hard to turn.  So, we are behind on our game.

I'm at work and it's snowing right now, in fact... how do you think I will get home?  I will skate through it, of course

Not sure if these have been discussed much I got the 6374's in from @torqueboards today. I gave them grief about shipping (never shut down or move inventory when changing warehouses. Get a limited stock at the new place and leave the old operational until the new place is able to meet demand...) and now I feel bad (but super stoked)... I was between the APS motors and TB and I went with what I was expecting to be the 1st gen 6374... BUT NO... Gen 2 TB 6374S exist!!! 

@torqueboards I will pay you more money for silver cans with magnets installed. <3

Actually, I was highlighting the mini 685ZZ bearing.  (It's for an espresso machine)  Also, there is an Easter Egg in there for another forum member (you know who you are).  The thing on the left was a mistake I had made on one of my builds and making a new one was faster/better than fixing it.  Now I just use it to hold XT90S while I solder on them...it sucks the heat out of the pins and keeps them aligned while the plastic is hot

It was Open Streets Manatee https://www.openstreetsmanatee.com/

Managed to get a free booth and gave out over 100 demos all day. Kids loved it, adults were scarred. We pushed the idea of commuting and riding with your friends on a hot day. Which in Florida is very common.

Quite a few were interested in some Christmas riptides, and 1 or 2 in building a full custom.

Planning was pretty easy, grabbed all my boards, tent, table, chairs, made a sign one night. Got my friends to show up and help. Demo's seem to run in waves as a family would come through and all want a ride at once.

The onewheel got a little top off, but I was using it to move the tent and chairs from the parking lot. (And chasing people for day footage) Raptor 2 ended the day at 92%. Riptides were maybe 75%. Onewheel would have made it just fine with the two-x but the power was there, might as well charge.

No collateral, just good vibes and keeping an eye on where they were riding. If someone went too far we would go out and check if they were ok. We kept all the boards in low power mode for safety and easily catchable reasons.

New.  Loaded only made 500 Blood Slayer Unicorns to my knowledge, yet sometimes they can be found in local listings for a deal.  

Note the OG Unicorn isn't very esk8 friendly (drivetrain weight deforms the deck, it was never intended for it).  The bolt holes are reinforced in the new one.  Good hunting.

Well, the usual, dimensions of the decks, material used, flex, etc. 
And of course price. 

As you can see I am not the only one interested in what you showed us, there must be a way to go around the PayPal thing.

The size of the deck, I am looking for drawings, I forgot where to put them. The deck is maple and a layer of fiberglass. For 70kg people, it has no elasticity.

They'll have Kegel and ABEC Adapters but need to do some modifications to the ABEC Adapters. Kegel Adapters are good to go. Ideally, we'll be using our custom 110mm Kegel style wheels for our setups.

no to be honest , but there is little more, the aesthetic result without mold and machine for the vacuum was a shit then layered a thin layer of black epoxy putty and then sanded, more than satisfactory result for the means and budget.
But it works perfectly, the only thing is that obviously the invisible carbon fiber is so wasted.
Soon I hope to redo this enclosure this time also with the mold and with the vacuum machine that is coming from China, always useful for many projects. 
The form of the enclosure will also be particular and never seen on a trampa : P. In the meantime I graduated and ran with the kaly gear drive.
Soon I will also have to rearrange the deck because after a good shot that has bent the axis of the infinity some inserts has yielded and a little out of laziness is still so.
 If you want photos of the present I can do it :stuck_out_tongue:

Nah it's not defective, all of the antispark on the market have a design flaw where each on/off cycle slightly damages their FETs

Waiting for one with a precharge circuit.  Basically one FET that turns on first with a 5.6 ohm resister in series -- then a bank of 1 to 5 FETs that open up for the main power to flow through.  Sounds basically exactly like a loopkey being plugged-in, eh?  LoLz

Essentially, you shouldn't be operating any of them in linear mode because the inrush current WILL damage them slightly each time

Oh yeah, it does look like the newest 3D Servisas one has the precharge circuit. (but not the older one)  So, that's the only one I know of on the market that isn't taking at least a tiny bit of damage on each poweron cycle

These are the handiest things I ever made.  You can completely eliminate bluetooth and a battery gauge and everything, and just check the battery level (if you need to) using the charge port.  Less holes in the enclosure, less things to break, MOAR RELIABLE

I highly recommend making one.  They're cheap as dirt too.  Battery gauge + JB Weld + 5.5x2.1 Barrel plug

Most woman feature some kind of double convex shape within the thorax region. The Orrsom features a single mild concave. I can post a cross section. If @brenternet is kind enough to supply a drawing of KHs assumed cross section we can do a fair comparison.

It's generic, and also my first attempt. Pics show it printed at 25% scale, just so I could see it in the flesh. Sections are actually 15cm (ends) and 10cm mid. Therefore 60cm overall and 20cm wide.

Still making tweaks to design before printing full size prototype out...

Couple of weeks ago, on Old San Antonio Rd., I hit loose pavement (someone filled a pot hole with broken pieces of road) and fractured my wrist... the dog riding the scooter is an inside joke (at my expense) 😂 since now I can't build or ride for 5 weeks.

I'm so bored I'm just stacking enclosures on rare decks at this point lol

The Madrid Anvil (2017) Zak Maytum is for a Raptor 2 drivetrain.

I selected the 2017 Anvil because the wheelbase and relative dimensions match the stock R2 enclosure and deck more or less perfectly.

For big ESK8, the 2016 Formica Anvil is longer and has a more functional tail, if you can find one

Would make my day to see someone use it... :)

thank you.  My design for this one called for a custom jade colored carbon fiber, with an acid yellow border to match the TSG Pass and a glass hull to keep it watertight.

@Subsonic_Paul Paul Cameron got this deck very, very right.

That small blem in the CF pictured will be covered with a custom grip from @murdomeek - the vortex, second from right:

![image|690x389](upload://z6Gb0klvaqzRLB7ykNeH4VXkpuR.jpeg)  

The enclosure is @eboosted with a @Kug3lis heatsink.  Carbon fiber "I-Things" from my man @moon shall go up top to ensure a clean all-CF look:

![IMG_0508|500x500](upload://bxeV9ckmO4zukGmVmjfhQSqBVyc.jpeg)

Thanks. 

The screw holes are 6mm, and countersunk to take a flat pan head screw. I'd use M5 or M6 bolts and inserts on underside of deck. I designed it for a relatively stiff deck that I have here in workshop so flex is not a major concern. That said there should a little possible as it's a 5 piece segmented unit with 4 points equally spaced where flex could happen. I really need to print a full size version out and test it, so far it only exists in CAD.... :) 

Would make my day if someone actually used it lol

This will not turn at all ^^ (I know I try last year :smile:)

Edit : even with 15° riser on the Icarus (because of the shape and flex), on flat no flex you need I would say minimum 20° (maybe better on short board), 25/30° feels better.

What @StefanMe and I did yesterday was to integrate the antenna to a landyard. That way its far away from the power electronics witch could induce some interferences/signal strength losses.

Nifty! But i hope there is some additional support in the lanyard (like fishing string as there normally is) for the strength purposes of it. This is really smart though! And it opens the doors for so much in terms of case materials.

https://www.thoughtco.com/chemical-composition-of-road-salt-609168

could be worse - you could have build up of  cheese brine or  garlic salt! 

"Safer Alternatives to Road Salt

All forms of salt pose some environmental dangers, so many communities have searched for alternatives to keep ice off roads. In Wisconsin, cheese brine is used as a de-icer. The brine is a by-product that's normally thrown away, so it's free. Some towns have tried using molasses to reduce the corrosivity of salt. The molasses is mixed with saline solution, so freezing point depression is still active. The Canadian company EcoTraction makes granules from volcanic rock, which help melt ice because the dark color absorbs heat, plus it aids traction by embedding into ice and snow. The town of Ankeny, Iowa, experimented with excess garlic salt they had on hand. Another option, not yet in service, is to use solar power to help melt ice and snow so it wouldn't need to be plowed or chemically removed."

🙏 as min that’s the plan. Hope that will work out.

Thanks man ! I drew this up with the stiffer deck in mind. I guess it would have some flex due to the segment nature, and I also redesigned the connecting tabs (which were originally flush fitting squares) into round ends to allow them to move around I little without catching or fouling up inside the female part of the system.

Anyway, I've still yet to print out a full size version, but will this week at some point....

Looks sweet, just wondering how come the motors are mounted so low (almost parallel with the ground), I've see a few boards like this and don't get why. Is it a mount issue that restricts movement? Or hitting the deck?

Anyway looks great. I do have to say tho, I have a sweet spot for GTX's even tho the bad batt and remote they just look so cool

Thank @Grozniy!

This one is @Mikenopolis' Hummie deck.  Some reinforcement in the battery cutout and then this fucking sick fabric he picked out. 

It is just rough cut for now.  Still needs to trim the edges, a few rounds of sanding and epoxy and glass frit!  I love how you can just make out the "ghost carbon fiber" in the skulls!

Hey Pat so that's what the link thingies do...you learn something every day...lol
Its the way psychotiller likes to position them.

They look tough yes...:grinning:
They are adjusted up within a mm of hitting the deck at full turn.
If you raise the board up at the nose until the motor mounts hit 
its unlikely you will be going up a bump or transition that steep.

Me too a sweet spot for the GTX my first ride...I'll never forget that...lol
Even though I couldn't ride for shit....

It is actually pretty easy to do you are basically wetting out the fabric in the epoxy and it soaks through the fabric and adheres to the deck. Same principles as putting carbon fiber or fiberglass.

Yeah most are ordered from bestech. The 12s on the far right was an eBay find. I have used these micro 10s before on a 10S1P battery. It works but it gets pretty hot while balancing.

About three week old at this point.

Yeah, for me this is kind of an all-round deck i would say. Cannot tell enough how i love it next to my everyday baffle 37 deck which is also a nice, but the only thing what sucks is that there are no kicks on it(on the baffle), even though i had to create a tail from foam which is usually used by preppers to survive the forest grounds hahahaha...but it works fine, the "foam tail" sounds like a really nice add on and i think there is kind of potential in little things like that :mask:
...Thank you very much for the hint to find a nice enclosure for my planned build, and i can tell you, i keep an eye on @eboosted since i joined day one in this amazing community.He is one of the outstanding members in here and i like his work very, very much, for sure the enclosures,too:grinning: 
By now theres no need for an enclosure so far because I'm rookie and still reading and collecting my parts little by little, because electric skateboards let me run out of financial capacity the last two years and i think now it begins to get really expensive I guess hahahahaha so i have to focus on the parts that make my board move. for the first few runs(if they will ever happen) i decided to fix the batterie and so on with velcro fastener or something like everyone in this forum does.
The enclosure is the last and final part i need, so i can easily change things without enclosure trouble perhaps :joy:

Granted, the increased complexity is an issue.  I'm wondering about the dynamics of 4WD - does the push-pull behavior make the boards inherently unstable since pulling is more efficient than pushing, making the front motors slightly more powerful than the rears?  Does the act of turning impart a certain amount of torque-steer due to the nature of how a skateboard turns?  How does this affect speed wobble - I would think that it should be reduced with FWD, but does an uneven load on the rear impart it?
```

Good point. You will always have different torque levels/speed levels across different drive systems (motor and vesc) also there can be minimal delays. All of those factors will in my opinion increase the change of something going wrong because there's even more stress on the different parts :smile:

15 minute is a long time to be out. It's weird how the few people I know with these epic crashes have no memory of what happened. Its' like knocking on a hard drive while it's trying to save I guess.

4WD is intriguing you are literally adding something else to potentially go wrong

[quote="akhlut, post:1891, topic:63248, full:true"]
I am starting to think that 4WD is not a good idea. The incident rate seems very high compared to single or dual drives.
[/quote]

I was thinking this too. Not that its a bad idea, but maybe just more dangerous if something goes wrong. I was wanting 4wd for more torque and added redundancy. 

I think that it makes sense that it could be more dangerous as there is more torque, so if there is a malfunction it can more easily throw you off. And if the front wheels lock it's more likely to throw you off then rear wheels. If only one rear wheel locks it will just drag and slow you down.

I have no idea how this board can survive the abuse these guys put it though? 

Most hub boards will bend an axle if you fart while rolling off a gutter.  These guys 4 foot high air to flat no worries.

I think it always depends from which site you look on it.
with 4wd you also have less current pushing through each esc and through each motor. This means less heat, less changse you fry your esc or motor overheat or magnets get lose because of epoxy can´t stand the heat. You also have less stress on each belt and pulley so less changes of belt slipping etc.
you also have 4 motors, so 4 opportiunies to break.
if you build your board clever one side can totally fuck up and the other still bring you to a save stop etc.

the front wheel blocking is fatal, but if you drive a mountenboard with bindings than the blocking of the back wheels will bring you to fall down too.

Fell off the board due to inertia.  The board stopped in a large crack that I didn't see and I continued.  Fractured one bone in my right wrist.  And I'm right handed.
Grazed my left elbow, but the grazes happen pretty often it's not really worth mentioning.

I was riding to collecty car from the mechanics.
I was about 500m from home when it happened but it didn't hurt that much so I kept riding.  It wasn't painful till I went to bed so I just took some codeine and went to sleep.
Next morning drove myself to the doctors and was told I'm not allowed to drive for at least a week once getting the cast on for the bone to begin healing.
My wife is not happy at all.  But you only live once.

I think this is how you respond to the topic? But how do you like those allen wrenches? I just got a real cheap set today because I know I'll need them soon. I see yours have the special bottoms. I've also seen those with like a small rubber band around it, I guess for better grip? Are they worth it or is it just a small quality of life upgrade?

Lol, I see a resounding yes on that. Makes me feel bad that I wasted $7 on the set I got today. I mainly got it as a starter set to see if I really needed a whole set before I potentially upgrade later. That is generally what I try to do with all the new tools I buy because I can be pretty impulsive when buying things sometimes. Problem is, one of the sets I seen is pretty expensive and I dunno if I can buy that now. This one that I saw recommended might be overkill, I dunno.

The wera "hex plus" are basically the worlds best allen wrenches. Their claim to faim is a special geometry that can remove rounded bolts. And apply more torque to non rounded bolts. Also they are super high quality. 

I found that the BONDHUS are very good too and a  cheaper then wera. But they don't have that special geometry for stripped bolts. Mine have lasted years of regular use and still fit perfect.

There's a reason it's hella cheaper.  I reluctantly shelled out the money against my better judgement, based only on the recommendations of folks on this very forum, and bought these [Wera Hex Plus allen keys](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ODV0OE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00) and I have to say ***omfg I'm glad I bought them***.  They are SOO MUCH better, especially with grub screws and things like that.  If you hate stripping hex, then you NEED to buy these, do not accept imitations.

Thanks. 

That’s a double stack enclosure by @bigben and a 12s6p battery by myself. It can fit more than that. 
I don’t have a picture of the inside since it is not very pretty. It also fits a dual escape with the dual heatsink. 
I still have to make the inside pretty but it’s less important so it may never happen. 

I do still need to add a charge port but I don’t want to cut the enclosure so I’m going to put it in the hole by the truck and mount it with some bracket between the truck screws. 

Can anyone fabricate one for me to fit a 2.1mm input jack or actually preferably an xt60 female plug? Not sure if it should be metal or 3d printed. I’ll try both.

I don't expect this material to be super durable, but inspecting the part made so far it certainly feels like it is robust and up to light/medium use. The deck I'm using it on is more for display purposes, and proving a point that I can do this sort of thing. Very much a novice at CAD and printing :) Fun to learn though.

Yeah it works but only bench tested and butt tested. Also one of the temp sensors is fried on the motor from the reverse order on the escape.
Luckily that’s all that fried and hall sensor reading worked. 

I did get over current fault with 120 motor amps. I was surprised about that since I have absolute max set to 130 and it actually recorded 147 before the fault which should not be possible right?

https://metr.at/r/CgD1g

Settings are:
motor 120 -60 
batt 60 -30

I think I like this clearance but I won’t know for sure until I try the speed bumps in my street. Besides I like a low rider. 
I don’t think I’m going to try that routing. If I want more I’ll probably buy some 107’s or switch to the sixshooter’s when they arrive.

Lol, shaft and head (to an extent). The driver length is shorter, as the hex shape fades into round, but because the regular ones are hex from head to balls, and are presumably not as strong. Not really a decisive factor tho, unless you're going to be putting a lot of torque into them, and that's only gonna be 4mm+ drivers. The sparkle ones are cuter tho

I wish i had ordered these magic hex wands :mage: before i started my build, im sure they would have saved me some cash, dremel heads some bolts, and a lot of time sweat and anger, i think these could be added to this thread below, perhaps in a new section that concerns common used accessories such as good tools glues and so on....

as starting a build without such items will/can lead to problems. and unforeseen budget costs.

No injuries, thanks for asking! Being dumb, remote sent the beast full throttle into a garage door at a 30° angle. Front wheel took nearly all the impact, launched it in the air and flipped on its back. Despite the loss of a deck, it was a valuable lesson. Like a gun-safety lesson where no one gets hurt. And kinda cool to see. 

I actually rode 4 or 5 times afterwards but couldn't figure out the creaking noises. Lol, glad I didn't get hurt doing that!! Total freebie

@Namasaki thanks for that deck! It served me very well

trying.  The weather just got nice here as well.  I'm in Melbourne, Australia.  All the group rides i can actually attend due to some work holidays coming up have started and now I can't go.

hope you heal quick as well.

I'm working on putting some pneumatics on a board to reduce the impact of cracks and may buy some 97 or 110mm wheels (83mm is too small it seems but I love being lower to the ground).  just can't really work on the board with one hand.  so can't ride and can't build.  I'm losing it.

Phase wires and Sensor cable (without need to remove the JST Plug). Can trim the extension to suit so it meets up with enclosure.

This is a revised version of what I've have on my board all year. Works great and keeps everthing neat and tidy. Printed one for another member on here and it turned out the holes on his drop through deck were different to my top mount one, and I hadn't made provision for that on the design. Today I went back to the project and made some changes and improvements.

Can we get files for printing or buy from you? This would look great on my build.

I would suggest splitting the "main section" from the "tunnel section" so you can print one in petg and one in TPU. My deck has a curve the tunnel would have to wrap around.

I'm not a vendor, just a hobbyist :) The files for any of the stuff I've doodled are up on Thingiverse. Just search Toughook Riser, or Enclosure and it'll come up.

My deck also has a slight drop through and the 'tunnel' flexes easily because it's only a couple of mm thick. I could easily do a seperate file for just the riser next week if you wanted ?

It's a 2.5mm part. Printed vertically up. The parts are supposed to be glued together with epoxy in between. 

In my next enclosure, I am going to print the parts very thin and then reinforce it with fiberglass sheets and epoxy.

I am also thinking of creating a thread where people can seend me a cad model of their deck or just enclosure dimensions and I should be able to churn them out pretty fast because the models are  parametric.

@PatRocks this is sick!  I have been wanting to try this for so damn long on a deck.  It looks soo cool man.

I have seen some cool stuff too where you can pour paint/colored epoxy or whatever into the burned channel then sand it down. Gives a cool effect.

You can use a microwave transformer,  that is what I did. You have to wet the wood with some baking soda+water solution to conduct the electricity. You could try and spread the solution in the in the approximate shape you want the electricity to travel and put the electrodes a each ends. I don’t know how @patrocks did it but you probably have to sand the deck bare.

Yes it is a bit dangerous as you have one electrode in each hand unless you use nails and clamp connectors  like I do. I usually connect everything and than flip a switch from far away. I think it is in the tens ont thousand of volts or something like that.

yes, I believe that's accurate. The machine my friend Jed uses runs around 2K volts iirc. the microwave transformers method is brutal comparatively. The only thing that would concern me about that method (besides the elevated danger) is compromising the integrity of the deck. The transformers burn SO deep, so quickly, that I wonder how long you can burn before you end up with _just_ a piece of art. @sender to answer your question: LIGHTNING BOLTS!!!
Edit: @Tamatoa That looks rad! I had considered doing something similar in my build, but I figured that my burn channels were so shallow that it would be a pain in the ass and I'd just end up with glowing smudges all over my deck. lol. Nice work!!

Funny thing is that I let it burn for quite a while and was surprised that the breaker did not flip 😅. 

I wanted the channels to be deep enough for the dye to be visible so there was a lot of charcoal like areas I had to use metallic brush to clean it.

I have 10 lipos in the concrete area surrounding my pool and the footings at the last big project has another 5.  That reminds me must do a lipo puff check in the mancave.  Few down there have not been touched in a year.

Okay, but hurry. Do you heat your epoxy to expedite the cure? I recommend it!! Makes it stronger too. I use regular ass sunbeam heat pads and some release film or whatever. Cuts hours off the cure time and, again stronger result. Don't listen to those guys ☝️ I think it's beautiful, though I like your bludgeon more. Beauty is in the eye of the beer drinker

Thanks :+1:

The deck is actually from IKEA can you believe!? lol It's actually REALLY nice just as a manual board and the wheels and trucks you get with it are awesome too! It's only £60 complete.
The enclosure is a mepal sandwich/lunch box
The ESC is a Wowgo 2s ESC running a single hub motor.
The battery is my own... left over Sony VT6 cells in a 10s1p configuration to give around 5-6 miles of range.

God dammit!!! Wrong forum!!

It's actually just a led strip I will be mounting in some epoxy. And the other lamp will be headlight.

My enclosure is not high enough so I will be making an edge around the outline of my enclosure of epoxy to get it higher from the deck. @squishy654 said I'd be cool to have led lights in the epoxy so that's why.
And also just because it looks awesome

You know that proverbial 5-minute ride from home, where you think 🤔 I don't need pads, just a helmet is fine... I'm going under 20... it's just a burrito :skateboard: :running_man:  

Five minutes later, I nail the throttle, pick up momentum and then, ka-thunk.  

Board nosedives and literally pitches me into a superman, into the street.  Just imagine diving into the street hands first, like that.

I made my roll, incredibly, but on the first one my left wrist went wide and hit the street, like a flyswatter.  

apple's finest timepiece sheared off a piece of bone on one side of my wrist, and a different, longer bone in my forearm cracked like a toothpick, longways.

my biggest mistake was waiting it out with a splint; had to start over today. :bone:  

be careful friends :)

Looks fantastic. Will it actually be practical though?

From my year of riding now on skate wheels I’d say a suspension is only needed when I’d encounter unexplored terrain so I could be less fearful of tackling it, but even then I’d argue that since we don’t have a wheel to steer aka steering wheel, we wouldn’t want a suspension for our boards. 
We just don’t control these boards like other vehicles aka cars and motor bikes, where a suspension is actually a necessity to safely drive them.

I’d love to be wrong though and see some cool suspension drives come to fruition.

@Idea, I can't exactly tell from the geometry, but will this suspension system alter/increase the angle of the trucks when traveling throughout the suspension motion?  If not, I have a feeling these are going to be sick. 

And omfg. Just so pretty to look at!!!! I dream of riding something like this one day.

@sayekim
A few weeks ago I bought a Winboard GT M6 (Halo Board)
If you were riding on this board, you would definitely like to have a soft suspension :laughing:


But now seriously :neutral_face:
You're right .. suspension in the longboard can make the control worse. The second disadvantage is the increase in weight

However, I like non-standard solutions, so I want to try to build such a suspension. ... I will try to find a compromise ... I do not know if I will succeed.

@skatardude10
The suspension arm is long, (100 mm), so the geometry change will be small
 
@dareno
These are the first sketches ... the final design will probably change ...
In the project I used the G-Bomb Black Panther 26 deck

We went all out for them and basically they had WAY too many cameras.  Each car had 4 onboard cameras and then all the track cameras etc so the director was lost... He had nearly 100 cameras at his disposal.  Too much concentration on the attack zone thing and a few other things that need ironing out but it should be a good season.  I'm not in Morocco so my next one is Mexico

They are great for 8mm shafts, limitation on 10mm though, I'm going to have to drill them out but it'll work fine.

36t is ok isn't it? I'd prefer 38/40 but I'll survive. Perhaps this is the first run on the most popular size and there's more to come?

The feeling of control and feet is good.
Regarding ride comfort, the priority of the wheel and deck will be higher.
I used this deck tape to improve even the ride comfort of the hard deck and thin urethane wheel of this DIY board even a little.
Although the deck is sold at OWN BOARD, it fits perfectly with the EXWAY deck tape.

Because I used FOCBOX, building became difficult.
10S Battery, 10S Hub Motor, WOWGO ESC, It becomes easier if assembled with these.
Li-po can be constructed by soldering, so you can challenge even if you do not own a spot welding machine.
You can probably install a battery pack that exceeds 200 Wh.

No he's just holding it so the motor plates are flush so its making it look bent in a different spot. 
If he held the clamps flush it would look twisted on the other end.

i have 2 sk8 6374's at 192kv, 65a each motor, 16/36 on 90mm wheels with 15mm 300mm belts. They mounts are far too soft. i think because you got the longer mount they're a little bit stronger and on top of that they're anodised which is a bonus

A longer mount however will have a higher leverage multiplier due to being further away. So it is more likely to bend with the longer ones

@mynamesmatt 

I will go with SK3 6374s 168kV using absolute maximum my battery can provide (12s5p@peak 100A(50A each) or 12s6p@peak 120A(60A each)), 15/60 gearing on 6 inch wheels. It's gonna be more like a cruiser than a "fun board". :slight_smile: 

I will see how it works, I haven't seen any issues from others regarding this mount before you pointed it out.. :slight_smile:

I still don't get how tight the belts must be to twist the mounts..

I will put my trust into dickyho. I might just stuff a M8 cross member, but maybe I will not need it.

depending on which esc you have, with those sk3's I'd run 40a battery amps and 60-80a motor amps. that'll have shit loads of pull. Also my belts were fairly loose as I wanted more free roll but they were tensioned enough to not slip

you mean they don´t have a set screw, or they don´t have a bore at all?
so you drill it by your own?

i was suprised about the good grip, it was reasonably smooth, had some vibrations that were annoying at high speed. overall too early to judge, just did a few kilometers! first impression was good except for the wobble - something that really annoyed me with the valve of air tires too, so I was really hoping for a smooth balanced ride with these urethane rings. lets see what happens, frank said it should/might be gone after a bit ;)

I’m sorry but I can’t believe that you have ruined the battery so badly. How could you think that having the 4th set of spot welds orientated the wrong way could possibly work. That battery is now unsafe and a hazard to itself. Please dispose of it immediately.

Are you sure they are hub motors, they seem to have bearings on the inner part of the stator. Usually in DD’s it hubs the stator is stationary while the rotor/can spins being held by a bearing either side of the stator.

This reminds me of a sk3 motor with the under bearing for the fan

Yes Andy :D  it is !
I try to make my own diy hub motor, since I have tested the Maytech hub last year on my [SWE](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/swe-custom-33-integrated-enclosure-ronin-cast-modified-hub-motor-80kv-800w-90mm-10s5ah-x2-vescs/13412/43) board, and then Gummies are release, it seemed to me obvious :bulb: I have to put a big motor in a gummies wheel !!.. Just to make it and test it ! :smile: 

* Maytech 9055 hub motor doesn't get enough urethane at all > Gummies should be better than that ... 

* the little motor 80kV 800w at 10s eat up too much too fast ! (even with 25amps motor max and batt max) > a big 8072 65kV should help a bit here too. (Under 12s at double, triple, even quadruple times more Amps batt and motor Max, it should be much more fun! )

the [3d prototype looks](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/8644) ok but now I have to make the parts of the motor (the flanges and the over-bell).
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rps20180202_210014.jpg
(all this pic are old now from last year now, with the blue carpet)

But there is a bearing in the stator, that’s what made me think it wasn’t a hub motor.

Well see @pat.speed ! Yes it is like that the [8072](https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps8072s-sensored-bldc-motor-70kv-6000w/) is made, this bearing will be removed if I can too seat the stator of the motor directly on the aluminum of the hanger (not the axle).

:shushing_face: shuuuuuuush bro !!! ... :sweat_smile:
Sadly no, I just read (this summer I guess) all the issue people get with them (but at really high rpm, mine are 60kv, and I read issue on more than 200kV ...) and it's what I said, I should test them 1st. I hope it will work good as I also redesign and custom in some way the motor (like maybe resin the winding, reinforce magnet in place, bigger bearing support etc.

Now, I'm torturing myself to know if I stay in Gummies, or if I can integrate my hub with Stooge Wheels instead (letting the motor exceeds alf on one side) ... (or Bergmeister buf it look too much like Direct Drive with the motor completely exposed IMO).

Ja you probably right with it. Low kV and your custom modifications would solve th issues probably.
One thought: why you don’t try to get the motors into a hub. Like let’s say superstar hub. Than you could use gummies and pneumatics. Maybe there is a way to get some gummie style selves made for the bermeister wheels 🤔 that would be dope 😅

Edit: just realized that’s what you doing 🤦‍♂️

Pneumatics works only with direct drive style (like Carvon or Torqueboard) more exposed.
For hub-motor on pneumatic, the motor is not enough inside the hub because of the air valve ... :sweat_smile: (1st I made it I have forgotten that little point).
So only Gummies on a superstar like hub/rim.

I know there is stuff like this for bicycle tires that you can even drive over nails without to break them. With it you could cut the valve. Would maybe need some tube repair to cover the valve hole and maybe driving would be a bit harder, buuut who knows.

Damn dude, yea that is crazy. Fair enough though, I never broken a bone luckily. So I can't speak from experience. Though if it was broken near or at a joint like the elbow, I still think it would limit some motion? The bump does look odd and taller than I would expect from a swollen part, but still seem plausible.

As soon as I plugged the antispark in there was a large spark and I quickly tried to remove the plug but it would not move the plug instanty got hot enough to melt the solder so I broke the connection by pulling the wire off the plug.

What did I do wrong should I have put the antispark on the negative cable?

Could it have been a defective plug? I'm kind of worried if anything else got damaged.

I don't see an S on that male connector. Maybe you grabbed a plain xt90 male? Not sure if it has any effect but hey I did notice. ![Screenshot_20190104-174019_Amazon|281x500](upload://778jJF7GYcutnYykYhqIyo1k77q.jpeg)

@Battosaii the male doesn't matter but the female has to be an "S" variant.

Would you photograph your setup and how the battery is/was connected to everything else? 

Are you sure you weren't shorting the battery out?

I think the real question people should be discussing is how to prevent something like this from happening in the future; not only for you, but others as well. Was your cutoff voltage set too high? Or did you somehow have a massive voltage sag occur? When my board is about to run out of power I can't even go that fast (or fast at all), and when it does cut out it's in free-roll mode, so it doesn't suddenly lock up or anything.

I have everything taken apart right now. But I did test with my TB12s4p and it turned on like normal no shorts in the set up, the Master Focbox failed, I'm in the process of checking the fault code, it has a red light constant blinking. I'm hoping it was just the drv that blew. I don't smell any burned electronics. The other 3 Focbox don't have red lights but I can't test them till I hook them up to the PC one by one cause they are all set up as slaves. 

Kinda sad now cause single Focbox are no longer available. :frowning: I hope it's fixable.

Thanks @Surfer. 

First ride on the haya deck and it feels really good. Excellent surface area for you to have a nice wide stance for us 5ft9’ers and over. 
Deck has practically zero flex but the wood itself feels bouncy so even though the deck is stiff the ride is not. Also feels great due to them ronin trucks and looks really nice and stealthy due to them hub motors.

thanks my brother.  I have to admit, the COLAB genuinely surprised me under gravity power today (even with a broken arm, I could not resist a few moments in the rain today).  

The COLAB is not like Trampa or MBS, or Scrub; it's more like a heavy snowboard in that you ride it Bigfoot (wide stance), and you can ride it without heelstraps (feet sit flat, more like a LaCroix).

An all-UNIK drivetrain with @okp's motors & chain drive is on the way from France and I'm adding @Nowind axle extensions for MBS, front and rear, so I can go back to the 2.80/2.50-4 tires without having to trim the deck too much.

Better than what? 

You haven’t told me the specs of your motors yet?

I don’t know about all terrain wheels but at 75 kv like exodrives aka torque drives 😆 on 97mm skate wheels it starts slowly. You would need to go 4wd and even then I don’t know if it can compare to a couple of 6374 with 15/36 gearing. 

It must be really slow on at wheels I imagine. 

But I’ll give it a guess that for a decent torquey start from stand still on at wheels in a 2wd configuration for direct drives you’d need 60kv motors perhaps?

Yes it is. For some reason I misplaced all my micro usb charge ports and didnt feel like waiting for the mail for some more. Took apart a rechargable bicycle light and made the light board into a charger with a jst plug. Untested though

Fully admitting my fuck up after examining my loop key set up with a clear mind and beggining to make a new one I realized that I hooked up the antispark wrong and instead of jumping positive to positive I hooked up positive to ground. I take full responsibility for my fuck up and I'm actually relieved it was something I did and not an actual component failure. 

Just to make it clear I made a correct loopkey but I mixed the Vesc plug with the loop key plug and blew it up.

No only positive was connected to the Vesc no ground that's where the loopkey should plug in. I guess the giant spark from shorting the + and - with the loopkey killed the drv ships.

@b264 
I believe the insert part of their wheel pullys share the same bolt pattern. So it sould bolt right up with the insert part of the 40t pullys you ordered

My first book I read without doing it for class was fight club. My college had a lot of off the wall books like the exorcist, the rum diary, feat and loathing. Since it was a college the had a copy of mein kampf in the history department. I read it and it was interesting and had the rest of the world read it probably would have changed history and stopped a mad man before coming to power.

They probably charged $8000 and his insurance company talked them down to $1000 and then they paid $200 and stuck him with $800.  Because, you know, they "paid 90%"

There is no health care in the USA any more.

But, collectively, we keep voting for people who make it worse.  Oh well.  I've just accepted I will die early because I'm in the USA

Well I think it is time to put that cast to the test if you fall and you are hurt the cast didn’t work and they need to go back and try again and do it for free because they messed up the first time. As Ron Swanson says.

Apparently, it was on fire.  It smells strongly of fire and mold inside.  But shockingly, the connector fire did not cause the failure.  The failure was caused when the blue and green wire shorted through their melted insulation.  Plastic insulation.  This failure was directly caused because the prebuilt manufacturer did not use silicone-insulated wire and they did not use big enough wire.  Either one would have saved this from happening.

@darkkevind Do you want to chime in here and perhaps tell us the specs of the strip you use?

Even if the nickel isn’t what it should be I wonder what kind of force caused this to happen?

In a facebook group there were pictures of another KD battery. Don't want to post them up here as they weren't my pictures, but from what could be seen in those pics, that battery was a fire waiting to happen. 
Batteries with burn marks (shorted?), crappy insulation, loose welds, welds that had burnt holes in the nickel strip, sharp corners everywhere, nickel sticking out over the insulation on the positive cap, damaged shrink wrap (on cells) and so on. 

Looked really ugly. I just hope Kevin has stepped up his game since, or else we probably have quite a few ticking battery bombs out there.

Idk. All I've seen from him are these few less impressive batteries, plus the pictures he posted himself on here.

Maybe he took on too much work which affected quality? Maybe this was early work and quality has improved since? 

Whatever happened here there are no excuses for this. He's not a 16 yo hobby builder, and imo selling these batteries as a "professional battery builder" is borderline scam.

Nothing to do with the new motor BTW. It's as easy as using left over lipos from HK packs of various ages. Then despite using BMS to charge simply bypass that garbage for discharge. Don't monitor cell voltage at all and hope the VESC LVC will magically save the day. Go for a ride flat out to test range. Then when it LVC kicks in point a hill and send that bitch. When you hear a bubbling noise get busy undoing the screws and find a source of water.

Sand won't put out the fire contain it maybe. The main idea behind using water is taking away the heat. As far as I know being a chemical/electrical fire taking out oxygen doesn't work due to it being a thermal run away. You can't remove the fuel because the energy stored within the pack. The ignition source is..... Itself can't remove that either. So your left with the counter intuitive option of cooling and water works well.
I think Lipos have gotten safer than they were(I said safER). Once they heat and puff and the IR goes high yes they rapidly get hotter but the soft pack split the laminations separate and kind of break the circuit internally.

I guess I can understand your reasoning, but eith electrical fires and whatnot I dont think water is the way to go. Cooling the cell wont matter as theyre already going though thermal runoff(runaway? I cant remember the term.) 

I said sand because suffocating and snuffing the fire seems like the best option

(I am not a fire fighter) 
Seems like it. But once you exhaust the fire extinguisher there is a good chance (depending on how big the fire extinguisher was) the battery will still be hot and smuldering or laminations will touch again later on and flare up.
There are some vids showing people trying countless dry Chem and  CO2 extinguishers it just flares up again. Fire brigade rocks up and drowns it.
PS I'm not fire fighter. Just read stuff from the internet made my own small lipo fire in a safe well ventilated area to test the theory some time ago. Then this happened and I felt prepared and it worked out well.

This is a myth cause by the confusion about lithium metal reacting with water, but the cells only contain lithium ions suspended in a liquid electrolyte. They don't contain lithium metal. (More confusingly some other battery types do contain lithium metal)

I have read fire departments and cell manufactures recomending a shit load of water. As the only way to put them out is to reduce the temperature below thermal runaway. It also prevents it spreading to other flammable items or cells.

When you have several packs next to each other like in this situation, one burns, makes the one next to it hot and then it goes into thermal run away. You end up with a slowly moving fire from one end of the pack to the other. 

In this case he managed to save the other cells, with sand it probably would have been the entire pack. 

I think sand is good though for small packs that can be completely covered. Though it only contains the fire shooting out but does not put them out due to lack of oxygen. They still burn until all the fuel is used up.

Sand is a good option if you don't have a shit load of water and you just happen to have a big bucket of sand.

From batteryuniversity, they are pretty decent sorce. 

## What to Do When a Battery Overheats or Catches Fire

_If a Li-ion battery overheats, hisses or bulges, immediately move the device away from flammable materials and place it on a non-combustible surface. If at all possible, remove the battery and put it outdoors to burn out. Simply disconnecting the battery from charge may not stop its destructive path._

_A small Li-ion fire can be handled like any other combustible fire. For best result use a foam extinguisher, CO2, ABC dry chemical, powdered graphite, copper powder or soda (sodium carbonate). If the fire occurs in an airplane cabin, the FAA instructs flight attendants to use water or soda pop. Water-based products are most readily available and are appropriate since Li-ion contains very little lithium metal that reacts with water. Water also cools the adjacent area and prevents the fire from spreading. Research laboratories and factories also use water to extinguish Li-ion battery fires._

_Crew can’t access the cargo areas of a passenger aircraft during flight. To assure safety in case of a fire, planes rely on fire suppression systems. Halon is a common fire suppressant, but this agent may not be sufficient to extinguish a Li-ion fire in the cargo bay. FAA tests found that the anti-fire halon gas installed in airline cargo areas can’t extinguish a battery fire that combines with other highly flammable material, such as the gas in an aerosol can or cosmetics commonly carried by travelers. However, the system prevents the blaze from spreading to adjacent flammable material such as cardboard or clothing._

_A large Li-ion fire, such as in an EV, may need to burn out. Water with copper material can be used, but this may not be available and is costly for fire halls. Increasingly, experts advise using water even with large Li-ion fires. Water lowers combustion temperature but is not recommended for battery fires containing lithium-metal._

https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/safety_concerns_with_li_ion 

Its a hard situation when your skating around in public you cant carry a 50ltr of water or a huge extinguisher.

you should know, the UNIK COLAB has @okp's full eMountainboard setup - UNIK Polaris 130kv motors, UNIK mounts and _chain_ drive, inspired by you, my brother :) 

Very interested to see how the Enertion Unity performs side-by-side versus Trampa VESC6 in real-world, California hill country trail-bombing, with everything else being perfectly equal!

Hi Riako, please show respect. i was a bit tired this morning on my reply so let me rephrase that.

I'm using Maytech motors for more than 4 years now and UNiK sell the OEM Maytech motors for 3 years now. Started with 6355 190kv non sealed (which are coming from Jason in the early days), then 6355 sensored sealed, then 6374 150kv and for 6++ months 130kv. Anyone, including you can sell motors, there is 0 development or rocket science. I’s just about putting 2K euros on the table, choose the KV you want and put your logo on it.

## \#3113 Posted by: okp Posted at: 2019-01-15T13:56:14.812Z Reads: 132

To be honest, I don't care about the KV. I care about building consistent and powerful boards that I ride and enjoy. KV is just a factor for the smart brains and I'm not that smart. I'm using multiples KV from 105 to 245 and I'm happy with that. I may also have some 80 or 85 too. The point I was making is that no-one has really invented anything on what Maytech is selling as OEM apart Jason that spotted them back in the days and started the journey with his beautiful blue 6355 motors that I still got as a souvenir on my desk. 

Cheers

Added a FOCBOX switch with improvements. 
Can turn the power on / off and transport with one hand.
Also, it changed to a method to fix the light mount with screws.
The handle itself was redesigned to be robust.
Made a switch mounting tool with a 3D printer.

I prefer the "satin" fabric.  I recently got a sample pack of all the different types of fabric spoonflower offers and this seems like the best option to me.

It is really clean looking.  

None of the fabrics I tried bleed stain into the epoxy.

these wheels are truly terrible. they all wobble differently, some worse than others. they sent us a new batch ***which we specifically asked them to check on wobble.*** and guess what, they're just as bad.

even worse, people who deck down 1500 for a raptor 2.1 get the same bad-quality wheels! and don't even get me started on the hardness and urethane quality used.

Thats unfortunate, I was a Raptor 2 early adopter and the original front wheels were made in California and those are excellent wheels with excellent rebound. Now all the wheels are made in China and I'm sure the country can make great wheels but the Enertion wheels even if they don't woble are like comparing knock offs to real Abec 11s

@b264 @mmaner it's not the bearings i can ensure you. mounted it with zealous ceramics on precision truks to make sure it's not the bearings. **it's not the bearings.**  

enertion support keeps asking this as well, hence the emphasis.

it's absolutely the urethane as the wheel core spins true. i've checked this but i don't have a video of it.

I’m actually using a dresser drawer handle/ puller this one https://www.homedepot.com/p/Richelieu-Hardware-3-1-2-in-89-mm-Brushed-Nickel-Cabinet-Pull-BP33204195/205417429 along with some #8-32 x 1-5/8 inch eye bolts for proper angle attachment on the board the color is from blue electrical tape I wrapped it in & it also gives more comfort for carrying...between the 12s6p pack & the 6374 motors the board is pretty heavy so this was a must for me lol...

I'm just stating facts dude. Stop pulling an Enertion. Denying what you requested seems like a real scumbag move as per usual. You guys have given me broken shit for over a year now! I've only been able to put 40 miles on brand new boards that you guys have sent me!!! I even let your team "fix" my board with the same outcome! I ride every day if possible. This shit you guys have sent me has locked up at 30mph, or just doesn't work period. You asked me to teamviewer for irrelevant information. You have no clue how an electric skateboard works so I'm unsure why you need this. Its absolutely fucking ridiculous!!! Seriously dude. Do we have to go through this bullshit again? I'm pissed off because you guys stole over $2,000 from me at this point. I have a piece of shit sitting in my home for over a fucking year!!! Im not a storage facility and i didn't sign up to be a tester. Just give me money back already. Its that easy.

You guys get away with this shit because your CEO owns this forum. You guys delete relevant posts in order to keep your shitty products out of the firing line. Its fucked.

I'm specifically talking about the dangerous shit your company has sent me.

Yes! I was completely content that a solution has come, this may of course close the topic. But to unlist it is not normal and means that there is something to hide! 

I just placed a photo of this action. And @mmaner felt it necessary to do a personal sting towards me. I never personally attacked him and I think all my messages that I have posted are well argued. But he finds it necessary to avoid my questions. Personally, I am extremely stubborn, I also know about myself, but the way it went is absolutely not correct.

[quote="pjotr47, post:192, topic:81317"]

If something breaks, somebody place also a message. I know Enertion owns this forum but that is no reason to not spread out the problem with the wheels from the batch for the dutchirs. Here people also complain about the base plates of lacroix. The “shitty” evolve battery (oh wait I can’t say shitty because that give the company a bad name), some broken trucks and motor mounts from evolve. The APS motors that have broken magnet after some rides. Flipskys vesc that break after the first ride, antisparks that breaks and heat up.

Each company have sometimes a bad batch, there is no problem about sharing this problem with the community? Or is that also bashing?

And about this ^. If something is not true what do english guys say to that? Here in Belgium whe name that a lie, but in order to tell it on a better way, @meesie had been better used: that is not correct. I think (am almost sure that @meesie respect @CarlCollins, Carl is doining great job to solve this problem, I am extremely grateful to him for that).

You are correct, I don't like the way how you have have tried to solve the problem. And indeed I come after everything was done. I have also a normal life beyond this forum and esk8. Of course I have followed everything and have let you fight everything out personally.

[quote="mmaner, post:3322, topic:63248"]
I’m not interested in your opinion about lowness, you clearly have a double standard and are a hypocrite.
[/quote]
So? But maybe there are some guys who are interested in my opinion? Thank you for making it personal again. I accept criticism without a problem!

I see also that @SeanHacker has some problems with enertion. We all now enertion owns the forum, and want to give the community a good place to discuss and help each other out. But talking negatively about articles from other companies is no problem. But if that happens about articles of enertion, that is a bridge too far. I am very curious to know if @SeanHacker has also received a ban just like @meesie and @tricky-fpv.
Enertion is doing a great job; without them we were not at all so far in the DIY world. I respect everyone behind it fully. Their focbox has never let me down.


Btw: If somebody will give me a ban about all this, Please make first a list with the things I have done wrong, send me a pm about it, so I know it. Also know: I will come back and stonger then before.

From now on I will be silent again.... Peace out! Have a geat night everybody!

Your wrong. It's not about enertiin, I'm not affiliated with enertion, I'm just a mod. 

If you had just talked about the wheels and/or been respectful to Carl there wouldn't have been an issue. But you didn't, you were belligerent and argumentative. 

After the issue was solved you continued to be beligerent and insulting. Now you've gone so far as to create a new account so you can continue to be beligerent. 

Personally, I hope you and your friends are all banned and your IPs blocked. Your not here to help anyone but yourselves and have a temper tantrum when you don't get your way.

@BigBrit, 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/9111

Looks good mate! You're going to clock your motors at least 90 degrees toward the deck, so the phase wires aren't hanging in the breeze, right?

Hey cheers mate, unfortunately its pretty lame, my kids swingcar looked like it could carry a ton of batteries and I needed a project. Took a lot of inspiration from that pictures only post and thought I'd throw a couple up, still a ways off but getting close to nylon prints. At this stage its 3:1, drive cushions from 1:5 nitro models, 2x5045, unity, anrduino remote? batteries? Bms? Mums permission? Few details to work out yet

Haha it's 3D printed PLA+... Then bolted on via M4 inserts... 

I realised my paint was chipping every time I laid the board down or picked it up...

I tried other methods before, off the shelf slip on bashguards left a mucky mess, suguru didn't stay long, silicone looked like crap... 

In the end decided to print something out instead and bolt on.. if it gets scrapped up just remove and bolt on a new one..

Interestingly you are not the only one that noticed....

This design is much more ergonomic that the kayak handle. Another thing about the kayak handle was that it was constantly getting dirty from being so close to the ground.

Got a response from Flatland 3D on the full finger gloves. I'm not gonna manage a group buy. But they offered me a discount code and saving shipping if someone can do the bulk order.  Who's got the time and patience to collect funds and redistribute?! Depending on quantity they can offer more than the 10% initially offered on a single item.

They need to know how many are interested. Maybe Jared can do his usual "preorder" so we can post it up on FB groups as well to get maximum exposure and deeper discount?

@JLabs @thisguyhere? I can send details....

I agree as this is not THAT expensive. so option is, either wait for potential deeper discount as a group buy OR get the 10% now, which is basically like getting free shipping. I'll make a new post with the discount code in a bit

They did originally have labeda wheels, they must've either been too expensive or maybe operating from china was easier. I can see how costly it would be to have to ship wheel into China for assembly and then out. Shame cause i would love to be rolling in black 97mm ghost wheels by labeda

You need to replace that jack.  If you freeze-frame the video you can see the sparks are coming from the bottom of the jack and shooting out around the barrel plug.  Something in the jack is shorting-out.  Just snip the wires going to it (mark positive and negative) and get rid of that, drill it if you have to.  JB Weld a new jack in there with [a fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) on it and you should be good to go

Not all sparks are from shorts. I have a boost converter charger and when plugging that in it makes a big spark. However, if I power the charger on first and set it to the right voltage then plug it in there is no sparks at all, I think it is due to the capacitors on the charger. This sometimes happens with the small 10s charger I have too

I have never seen esk8 parts with 2.5mm pins.  So you have about the same chance of being correct by buying the 5.5x2.1, as you would have of finding a scratchers ticket that ***isn't*** a jackpot winner

TL;DR: buy 2.1

Test run done, washed all the dog poo off waiting for it to dry off totally before i check it all over,, im happy with how it feels/rides i lucked out with the set up, needs heel straps and better shocks on the  front thats all really, its quieter than i thought it would be, while on the concrete path cruising i did feel like Rose for a bit.... :ship::hearts::butterfly::skateboard:

Looks and feels very solid. Will definitely protect against cold weather and sharp wind. I have a 24.5 cm hand and bought a large. Fits like a “glove”. The fingertip sensing pads are shit though. Instead of placing them on the tips of the fingers they are in the middle of the finger so if you want to use your phone you have to press with the flat of your finger. Kinda awkward. 

The unidirectional flexible wrist plate feels strange but is easy to get used to and is easily removable. Feels very soft and comfy overall. I’m happy with my purchase :slight_smile:

Do you know how many amps that copper strip can handle?

This diagram says the max is 45A and that doesn't seem like that much for 8p.

That calculation is made per metre. Can't be interpreted as such for small strips on a battery. A nickel strip as wide is perfect for 60 amps, copper is almost X4 with better heat dissipation. I didn't test the exact amps that can deliver....way more than i need is the answer so i will not bother.

It's a never used prototype for boosted board remote.
It's neat AF so I'd really like to make one.
First I made a raw copy dummy to see how it feels in hand and have an idea if I can fit all electronics.
That part could be a rotary encoder or just potentiometer.

It feels weird in a hand and I think if just 3D printed, it may be very fragile.

Also there is space for electronics but then hardly any space for the cell, would need to use a very small one and so battery life would be very short 

That's probably why they didn't manufacture it...

Its def using potentiometers and not encoders, which means that it's limited in how far it can rotate.

I have built a remote using rotary encoder and it is pretty useful. Great for constant speed, but does require re-wiring you brain a bit (and a deadman-switch).

I just liked the form-factor of that remote you posted.

It’s got some gears on the side meaning that they probably drive the potentiometer. The reduction ratio can’t be seen fully but this could either help for it to rotate a further distance or shorten the distance

Yes but with SR the axle theads into the aluminium hanger, it doesn’t pass all the way through like other trucks. 

@mmaner I’m not worried about the axle bolt but the hanger where the bolt attaches as that is where all the force is taken. (Well assuming you are talking about the axle bolt)

There is a steel insert inside the hangervthat the axle threads in to. As long as there is no play, and loctite makes sure there won't be, the threads won't degrade. It's definitely more stress on the hanger but I'll keep an eye on it.

@Sender That's the most beautiful deck I think I've ever seen.  The integrated black reflective tape is the bomb diggity.

HI! No it's a 36 inch board, I do not like long board too much. It's my rendering skills that are not top notch :sweat_smile:. My favourite are the short boards, that why I have a spud. Now I am making new motors and I need a bigger battery for them. I thought 36inch is a good compromise :wink: That's why I am planning an integrated deck. I will try to make as cheap as possible, but I would need like 10 decks to make it happens. We'll see it!

Omfg, Blast from the past man! DH Race ftw.... 85mm 83a Kryptonics? 

I literally had this EXACT same setup when I first got into downhill... back when sliding was so cool, prior to DH culminating in hard lipped grippy wheels like centrax and coming back full circle to the freeride style downhill today... 

I need to find a youtube video for you...  

Edit: I am trying to find that one video from BC with the guy on the DH Race thats bombing down the highways to that song... edge of *something* I can't remember. Anyways, heres a video of me ripping my DH race back in the day

Its 290x115mm tires on a fairly regular trampa board. 
The wheels grip in snow is insane compared to the usual 8” tires from trampa. Its abit underpowered atm though, but that will change soon :sunglasses:

Those are Paris clone truck. Yes the axle is 8mm but I made an extension to 12mm... Plus the hubs has it's own 12mm pipe to hold so the all axles is held by the motor and adapter. Only like 10mm are 8mm, of course is the weaker point. We'll see it. I chose to do like thst to be a conversion kit. Otherwise you can drill the motor and go with a whole 12mm axle. Way easier...next DD would be like that. Now I have to finish this one. I learnt a lot by make it.

ehhe that's some of my stuff that I release for my personal riding as I like to test new things, over and over. It requires a bunch of dedication and prioritization in my personal money as two of these cost a billet. If I find time, I put that on my UNiK "hobby" shop for people to order. Lately, I've been missing time and hopefully in the future I'll get more time to put more products available for people to ride but that's a fight against time!

These are CNC AL7075 which include the baseplate with little funny details. I also got the mounts adapted to this hanger but they are also waiting on my closet.

I did these probably back in January 2018 and launch the prototypes for production in may. The video below is me riding these in July then Sept if I'm correct.

Looks like I will need to keep a bolt on option in mind!

 First priority is a slip on style for the Revolver drive. Not to hard to retro-fit almost any hanger to fit our bearing seat if you have access to a lath. A bolt on type might be difficult, I will need to check the clearances to see if there is enough space for holes and threads.

Jet Banshee 38"
Was debating between Rayne Otherside and this, the Rayne seems to have wheelbite even with 70mm so I went for the Jet. I need to protect the bottom side somehow the wheel wells are just bare cut wood.

Test driving them, and they are phenomenal. Precision craftmanship on Evolve hanger mounting plate. Just the exact mount width (equal to Evolve's own mounts tickness)

Those are (and will be) the only ones ever made like that. Is a 'mistake' that will not affect anything. The benefitial side effect will be that the motor mounting bolt heads will sit flush inside the recessed area. Next mounts of this model (63XX motor class) out of ATC will be ok in that regard.

A wonderful idea!
Only one doubt.
Does not the jack knife phenomenon be caused by sudden braking?
Does the trailer slide sideways when running downhill brake or weak grip road?
```

If the trailer is light enough to easily move the load, a jack knife phenomenon can occur. However, fishtail phenomenon caused by excessive speed is more problematic.

Wasn't me.

My business partner (who never has been on a board)  turned it all on turned the remote on (which was in my jacket).

I was gone literally 2 seconds getting my dog and he did all this and sent it into a wall in full speed in reverse.

Then his ass was fucking flippant and dismissive.  We fought.

I won.  Though I didn't close first him or anything, just dominated though.


It wasn't the board, it was the disrespect of taking someones shit you don't understand without permission, destroying it, then acting like "oh NBD, it's just the deck right"  

No it is not just the deck you dumb fuck.



The awesome part is I have way more money into the business so even if he "pays" for it, it is still really me who is "paying" for it.


Work is quite awkward at the moment.

Sorry to hear about that man.
How does being a business partner have anything to do with paying for the board? Unless he just opens a cash register, grabs a few hundreds and hands them to you.

PS So to get this right, he took the remote from your jacket, turned it on and then proceeded to slam on the brakes? All of that without permission? And then instead of admitting he royally fucked up, he was dismissive? The guy is an asshole. This is equivalent to getting the keys of his car from his coat, taking his car, crashing it and then saying why are you upset, it is just a scratch.

Exactly. All the forces the internal components went through is unreal.  Hard to trust now.

I am proceeding forward like everything is completely totaled.  Because it is.


I am going to do 12s6p on the new one.  Gotta get a little creative though.


I am going to see if I can make my 3d Servisas gear drive work.  We shall see.

I am really concerned about the @MoeStooge wheels.  Those thing are like pavement glue.  I went riding in the rain the other day and it had as good of grip as on dry ground.  Nothing like urethane.

This is a good idea I think I'd only trust the foc box in there even then still it's your life and you treat as your car ..I'd hang that bad boy on the wall of your skinning room and put your Co partner face beside it to let him know he won't be forgotten.. and put the bill of sale and all new cost of the new on for him to see what a deuch bag move costed

Be careful with the cells, it might not look like it but after some time vibrations my trigger a short of one of the cells. The winding of the cathode-anode layer are super compact ans susceptible to impacts like this one.

Dude, @Sender that sucks so bad. But at least you weren't on it when it happened and now we get to see what the Builder of the Year does to rebuild the Build of the Year. :smiling_imp:

And I nominate your business partner for the "Destroyer of the Year" award. It's like they say, "When the universe closes a door, it opens a window. Then you push your dumb ass business partner out that window and rebuild." I think that's how the saying goes. :thinking:

@mutantbass Use shoelace locks - but you have to get the big ones, not just any cheap china bullshit from online -  and put them on your remote straps/lanyards.  Not only do they hold the remote to your wrist, but you use a different color for each board.  I found them in-person at a New Balance store.  I also have ones I ordered online that are pieces of fucking trash and too small and they'd fall apart in 5 seconds anyway.  So these exact ones in this photo are what you want.

I am not even talking about the remote and board thing.  You don't know what you don't know.


It is the taking something that isn't yours without permission, destroying it, and acting like it is no big deal instead of being apologetic and attempting to rectify it.

What are your overall thoughts on the bindings? Are they comfortable? How tall are you? How far apart are your feet?

Im so so conficted between these: ![image|476x500](upload://kMLHcdPW6nTZBC0U58lhHlLfYjV.jpeg)

They're comfortable enough, my feet do start to fatigue after several miles and jumps. 
Those MBS look like the face some decent padding, but they won't be as easy to get out of if you need to bail. 
I've had to bail a few times and my feet slip right out. 

Best thing about having bindings to me is the added stability they seem to bring. As I said in an earlier post, going 27mph is really stable and then being able to turn on a dime, I haven't ridden another board that can do that so well. 

I'm 5'10" I do have longer than average legs, but having the brackets secured with the outside truck bolts seems to work great on the spud.

Oh yeah..no idea what happened yet, since I had to leave on travel ..so my board is disconnected at the house waiting for me to dissect. 

I assume it was a short.  But it was a horrible day as the back of my head bounced off the street.  

By far my helmet saved me... the impact was absorbed through my shoulder.  My body compacted..mainly ribs that absorbed that punishment...and finally flipped hard to my back and that's where my helmet was punished. Also my backpack saved me as well. 

At 30..almost 35mph. It was a nasty fall.  Thank goodness I wore a helmet. It easily saved me from serious injuries, possible death.  Now time for a new helmet.

Regarding those 5 inch tires. ( @mmaner @rey8801 @Skunk )  I have one quite bad quality sample because factory don't have more and it was the last bad one and I had to beg them to send it. There's quite high MOQ but it's a risk since I can't test this single one that I have. Now they have holiday so we can get back to this later. I'll start dedicated post about it and see how many people could be in for a group buy.

Yes. Waiting on some sixshooters and sr tkp. 
Still have to order a battery though. Thinking about 12s8p if it fits. 

The enclosure is very sturdy but als pretty forgiving so you can tighten it down flat to the deck without it breaking. I use a d shape rubber seal the kind they use for windows and doors.

Right, but this won't go into the board enclosure. This will be a part of an external BMS charger. The primary responsibility of the esp8266 is to show data on the TFT display. The Blynk part is just a bonus (it has wifi so I must use it! :smiley:) . I wouldn't bother with it if it wasn't so easy to setup with Blynk. It's still nice that I get a notification on the phone once the battery is charged... even if outside of home (not that I really plan to ever charge my battery unattended) or I can check how the charging is going without getting up from my sofa (cuz that's important :smiley:) .

Yup! It was close. Started on a group ride, 2 minutes later power stopped. Kicked back to my car, opened it up and found one or two of the bullet connectors that had been heat shrinked but nothing else had worked their way loose a bit. I honestly don't know how the XT-90 adapter melted, but I'm guessing the positive and negative bullets that connect everything contacted/shorted just enough to heat the wires, melting the connections out of the XT-90 adapter until coming loose completely, breaking the short. 

Got lucky it seems. I've since used some heavy duty electrical tape around everything in the battery enclosure that could have the potential to work loose and everything is back in working order.

I've got a couple of a few styles on order. I like the idea of individual motor ports personally.

About this it is okay, it is better to use fishpaper between it. But it is not a disaster if the cells can not move over each other.

As you are here for a long time and building some great stuff and also sell vescs and equipment, I guess he just expected a bit better looking battery pack from you.

As you said it’s just for testing and you will change the pack later, so all is good.

Sorry for it but the duck tape looks a bit getto.
This paired with no fishpaper between the p-groups, the so so welds and the routing of the balance wires, it’s just not a such a safe pack.

Don't even start that shit, because I can and will bust out a 30.5" kicktail board riding 150mm polyurethane.  I'm trying to figure out why the pulley is slightly off-center

Your 3:1 wheel gear also had 6 screws holes I guess ? But not sure if it's the same diameter as I'm with the Nano (2.6:1, I suppose Yes just yours are 14mm wild true ?)

But I think it will work even more perfectly ;)

Be careful with Hobbyking thread lockers. The TL-262 is high strength and needs a blow torch or heat gun to remove.

The TL-242 is medium strength (like Loctite 243) and should be removable with hand tools IN THEORY. I had to use a blow torch to remove the grub screws of the motor mount and pulleys.

I don't use this HK stuff anymore....

Thanks! My motor mount screws got stripped and I think it was because I used TL-262 without heating the screws.

The HobbyKing does the job but I would any day use the real over the copy. Haven't tried the real on roads yet, but seems like better quality than HK.

Maybe one of the belts has more tension than the other? I know that causes the wheels of my board to start up unevenly (or because 1 is lacking a hall sensor), but it's practically unnoticeable when riding.

@Ixf Can you go 30mph on that? It looks super-stable.

Bro. Just throw a channel truck on the bottom for easy peasy 140+mph.

But what if you had a triple-kingpin truck on each end of the channel truck?  Certainly that will be good for 317mph / 510km/h

Did you ever get your seismic trucks riding to where you loved them? I could never really get the feel for mine, but it may have just been the shit boards I put them on that didn't do them justice. I'd love to ride a well tuned seismic setup just to know that they can be as good as I always wanted them to be.

Not... Really. I tried to like them but maybe I just wasn't doing something right. I was given a set and had them on a pusher for a bit and they just never felt right to me, too spongey. I did end up throwing them on the front of a beater hub longboard I had, and they oddly seemed to respond better on a longer deck, but I don't think I've ever given them the proper time to dial them in.

Sounds like we may have had the same problem with just not doing them justice on a proper setup.

I'm curious, when you meant to the assembly do you mean the method of putting it together, or the actual plastic components? Because an injection molding rework is pricy! What prompted you to do that?

It's already a controversial topic. The default answer is always, "learn to skate". or "I can do it, I don't see why you/others have issues". 

Memes are for fun, Keep dreaming memes, even more fun, especially when responses are being said without giving any actual thought to the context laid before.

If someone say's use Okham's Razor, cutting everything else away, and says I'm so high(not drugs), but posts a picture of them standing on the ground, and states it as fact. How does Okham's razor prove that fact? You cut away everything that doesn't matter.

When no one understands how to cut away. You end up with, "he can't be high he's standing on ground". Then you have someone that did cut away, and says they must be high, because the altitude of the ground above sea level. "Really" being the variable by perception, as really high could mean 1ft or 3000ft.

See, but this seems silly to me. This is arguing over your favorite sportsball team level of discussion if there's controversy over a style of truck preference that clearly works fine for most people.

I followed your discussion points just fine. I don't disagree on your statements about castor. But I was looking for what the real world limitations translate to, as application & context of "instability" matter quite a bit here. 

Ultimately your statement of "10% board, 90% rider" absolutely holds true. My goal was to combat blatant, uninformed calls to authority from riders who clearly don't have the experience on the hardware they're discussing. People that are essentially claiming the opposite so they don't have to be wrong on the internet.

You were not one of those people.

We tried our best to make this piece of HW available at the best price possible. 
It's not designed to be cheap, it's designed for best possible performance. 
187,5 gbp plus tax if applicable is a nice price drop, considering that we added additional features. The SIX PLUS unlocks VESC 75/300 features in the VESC SIX package size. Extremly powerful but ultra smooth in power delivery, added robustness, IMU, (auto) adjustable voltage and current filters, three phase shunts, made to work seamless with Benjamin's latest software achievements. The SIX PLUS can spin pretty much any motor effortless, even inrunners with extreme low inductance.

Yes, it's my external BMS. It's a bit retro style. :slight_smile: I just used whatever I had lying around. I still kinda like how it came out, even with all the little glitches.

What can be adjusted:
- plus/minus sets the "charged voltage"; once reached an alarm is triggered
- alarm is both visual (red led) and acoustic (buzzer); you can switch off the buzzer with the toggle switch
- the LCD/BT toggle routes the RX/TX wires from the BMS either to the NodeMCU (which drives the LCD) or to the bluetooth module
- RST simply restarts the NodeMCU (I still have some glitches in the FW and it sometimes freezes)

The NodeMCU also connects to my local wifi and I can get voltage readings on my cellphone via Blynk. Plus, it can record and plot the voltage level during charging. It can also be used for setting the alarm and has push notifications. I might have slightly overdone this. :smiley:

that is the speed that you reach in like 50 meter from like 2-3 kmh. I didn't have the gut to keep it full throttle for longer. I have been to above 52 kmh with the same motors, but 130Kv at 10s. The difference that the 75kv ones kick you there so you need way more balance. Really fun

Nah, I was premed until I knocked up my then-girlfriend-now-wife so I took a quick Biomedical Engineer degree instead lol. Lots of anatomy and physiology. 

It's one of the weird breaks where it could be small enough to just need a cast (like a broken rib, can't really set it). They might just remove the piece if it's small enough that it won't affect you.

Great, here is the full report(Google translated)
Fracture of the glenoid. The previous survey of the present day showed the release of a fragment from the inferior extent of the glenoid as in bony Bankart injury. === 2019-02-16 kl. 17.22: There is an approximately 2 cm large released fragment from the glenoid's anteroferential range as in bony Bankart injury. Possibly there is a discrete impression in posterolateral caput humeri as in Hill-Sachs injury.

It did hurt alot, my shoulder got out of its positions three times and every time was a big pain. But now it's in position and it hurts less but still alot of pain, but i'l survive :stuck_out_tongue:

The 14500 I have doesnt have a nipple on the positive side so its ever so slightly too short to touch the contact in the battery holder. So you have t either put a tiny bit of solder on the contact or stick a nickel plate in between. I think the best would to get a 14500 button top or whatever they are called.

@goldenHusky That switch will fail if brine touches it.  I've had a few of them die.  They stay permanently "on"

edit: the black mechanical switch, not the electronic one

@mmaner To ride that board, you should get a proper [body armor](https://calimacil.com/collections/armor/products/briar-breastplate-brown). And a [helmet](https://calimacil.com/collections/armor/products/crusader-helmet)!

@nuttyjeff I understand, I've put enough capacitance on the board to keep the switch operational for a few hundred milliseconds without supply, so short disconnects because of really rough terrain should be bridged. But I plan to implement a momentary switch for the next run.

sensor wires
[/quote]

No sensor wires on this rebuild. As @Battosaii mentioned. The original setup didn't have sensors so it's not really missed since I always kick off anyway

Funny thing about the motor is that I ripped the tiny sensor wires when I had to remove a broken off bolt from the inside so I just pulled off all the wires 

No STL file I bought this off of someone here. I think it's from UNIK

You asswipes made me get out of bed for these pictures. 


Or @torqueboards make me adjustable baseplates and it will literally open up all sorts of potential.

Yeah for sure, 65 would be nice.

However, putting them on MTB decks you really only need 10-30 TBH.  But being able to fine tune to riding style is fucking awesome.

Alright y’all so I have a quick question
If a friend offered me this watch
https://www.invictawatch.com/watches/detail/26790-invicta-venom-men-537mm-stainless-steel-rose-gold-stainless-steel-rose-goldblue-dial-z60-quartz
In pristine condition for $2000 should I go for it? It’s sexy as fuck

It’s either that or save a bit more and grab a used Rolex oyster date so it’s pretty much a question of whether I should get the watch that looks better or the watch that’s holds value better

Ooooo talking about watches? I used to be a watch fanatic. Nothing crazy. Just a few Rolex, Omega, Tags and lots of cheap stuff. Then smart watches killed it. 

Before esk8 I used to be in a forum of people that made watchfaces for Android Wear. Literally have thousands of watch designs because of it. I miss drawing and putting these things together.

Invicta's are worth about $100 I have a few because I liked the look. Most use Ronda movements that are not terrible but a Casio is better in my opinion.

M3 better brakes and steering and handling. It’s German so safer too. I personally think every kids should start with a 1980’s Volvo station wagon not because the big open area in the back to have your girl.

@topcloud yes!  Coming together!

Are you guys going 13s4p or is that thin double stacked?

I just got a 3/8"  rubber gasket for my Lacroix so I can fit double stack in the two middle compartments.  Going 12s6p on this one.

Happy how the wheel guards came out finally. It keeps water sprayed from the wheel off the deck(below and above) and off my shoes and pants. Phew! I think I can call it done now. Maybe black grass frit, but that's about it. Although, because(maybe) of the double drop, I haven't felt the need for a grip tape.

Anyways, all files are [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392881). You can ask me to modify the files for your board. It's a lot of wasted effort if it's not used by multiple people.

@GarrettL nice. One of the most solid 3D printed mounts I have seen. I am a little skeptical about the idler though, they receive huge amount of torsional load when braking.  

I was thinking if you made the idler bolt hole symmetric so there is one on both sides, the second hole could be used to mount a support bar from one side to the other. This would really take some load of the mounts.

I prefer the stability of the RKPs because I am in the middle of the street and rarely going under 25/30 mph.

But while I am getting my Lacroix back up and running I have been riding on a Bludgeon with TKPs. The maneuverability is addicting.


It really just depends on where you are riding and at what speeds.

30-40mph fast/hard carving in streets= RKPs

Any thing lower speed/lower speed carving/maneuverability paramount= TKPs

What was the setup?

TKPs for esk8 definitely take some tuning to be viable IMO.  But when they are tuned for you are fucking awesome.


You should buy some from  SR.  Just get them, tune them, give them a real go. 

Worst case scenario, you aren't a big fan and you can turf them easily on the forum for like 40% loss if you don't mess em up.

Then you have something infinitely valuable.... more insight into what YOU prefer.

That is easily worth 100 bucks or less, right?



That's the way I see it anyway.






I want to try as many setups as possible so I am as well versed as possible.  This is what helps formulate an INFORMED opinion over mere fanboy status.


This is why I love getting @mmaner's opinion on pretty much everything I do.

Tell me another person in the entire world who has tried more setups.  There may be a couple, MAYBE.  But that fucker is on the short list.

I can say that both those boards at 25mph - the RKP is a lot more stable when it comes to wobbling and whatnot, or after you hit a huge bump, the RKP stabilizes wobbles much faster.  *But, the TKP is much more fun to ride.*

The bushing seat on SR TKPs is the difference. It lets the bushing sit in the cup and the outside forces push it equally, on most TKPs the bushing gets hit harder at the front than the back, so it sort of rolls instead of compressing. It's def worth 100 bucks.

@danile How long until these conversion kits are for-sale?

By the way, FYI I've been running a Mini Remote on straight 1S lipo for over a year with no issues.  3.3V is obviously better than 4.2V but in a pinch the regulator is probably unneeded.  Maybe even just a diode in series would be enough.

When these come in the smallest set I own will go out, at the moment that's a set of 83mm abecs. After that the 85mm kegels go and then we're into the 90's and I'm comfortable there.

](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc4-20-100a-plus-based-on-vesc-with-anodized-aluminum-heatsink)... not the VESC6 versions. A unity should fit in perfectly... the unity has a very nice footprint! 

But for what :grin: Its a shortboard... should be light and transportable... :smiley: even the 10S4P is too much. I ll go for 10S3P and let one slot empty in my battery boxes.

Yes I was thinking to the unity. Since you will also save the sapxe for the atisparks. For my short board (spud) I started with 10s3p and was fun then upgraded to 12s3p and now it's a little monster. 300g more in batteries, but 50-100g less 2ith unity instead of 2 Flipsky 6.6. Weight is almost the same but man... Range and power is on another level. 
Since with the unity the only telentry data that works is the metr. I used @Ackmaniac so far but with unity doesn't work. Do you use the pro one or the old one? Never read the whole thread and do not know if the old version is still worth it and can work with the recent updates.

I mean metr is for sure better. I just didn't want to spend 60 euro for a module. I am ok with paying the app for the develop ecc but it's just a bit too much. The HM10 module for the ackmaniac app you can build it yourself in 5 minutes for like 2$. My question is related to metr vs metr. Pro. Since the old one you can find it for a bit less but if it is not supported anymore then it is not worth it.

With the meepo hubs and Mad fury 75Kv close to 30km for sure. Never reached that far but tried 25 km once by not charging the board and still have left. Both the hubs are really efficient, while the mad hubs 130Kv drain a lot of energy, I guess due to the bad efficiency at low erpm (less then 15km with them).

Honestly I don't remember. While looking for magnetic connectors a couple of months ago, I had requested for samples from somewhere on Alibaba. I have to go through my emails. Along with it I had also ordered some bigger pogo pins to make my own high amp mag connector, they haven't arrived yet.

I also thought about the pogo connectors in the past, too many projects right now :smile:...

If you stumble across the place you ordered it it would be cool. I don't charge at high amp rating so changing my boards to this connector type would be quite cool.

So it worked. at 2A@40V, no heating. But, when I tried repeating on and off several times, there were micro shorts as the mating was happening and basically melted the inner connection. Pretty disappointed :frowning:. I guess I'll have to make my own.

Man, this would be so fun electrified. I used to buttboard and streetluge, that shit is such a rush compared to downhilling IMO, I don't know if it was my inexperience, or the fact that you average 20MPH faster down hills that average 65-70mph standup... FAST! 

These don't look as serious though, but still... I could imagine two handles, right for accelerate, left for brake... Feet to brake like normal as well to literally stop on a dime if you need to. I'd gear mine for 50mph at least, paired with some stable precision trucks... Do two front trucks like a lot of luge riders do...

Hell just electrify a legit 6 wheeled luge with a kWh of batteries and massive discharge, 4 wheel drive at least! 😎😎😎😎🤣

Someone do it! I don't have the cash to drop on a new electric luge right now or I would.

From http://taulman3d.com/how-to-choose.html. Apparently Taulman 910 is crazy good, but comes at a expensive tag of $36/lb. I got a spool though to checkout what the fuss is all about. Maybe I should have ordered Taulman bridge which is $25/lb and still sufficiently better than PETG. And oh, it prints at 245C just like PETG.

It really is that good.

But keep it sealed and with a bunch of those crunchy seasoning packets that come in beef jerky when it's not in use, or it'll take on water faster than the Titanic.

It's surprisingly easy to print with as well, just run your bed hot and make sure your extruder can handle a solid 245-250 steady

Thanks! In my early testing I did find that there was a crack that developed in the mount near the idler due to the forces you mentioned.  I redesigned it a bit and made some improvements which added quite a bit more material in that area, but the idler is totally optional.  I don't think you'd have any durability issues running it without an idler.    
I can upload a modified design with your suggestion if you're interested.

Yeah same here...ist so nice to skate rockered decks specially when There is no w concave. I like w concaves as well, but it feels much better without...if you like rockered decks take a look at the originals baffle 37! That is soooo awesome to skate. Xeah the mashine is nice, too.
I ordered the original arbiter 37 dk yesterday and im pretty excited

If you use a DROK charger you can "start" the charging process via a button so there shouldn't be shorts beforehand on connection.

Actually that's not the issue, I figured out later on. I was stupid to connect them wrongly. I connected the male part to charger and female part to BMS. As the mating is happening the +ve and -ve of male part can come in contact resulting in spark. If I just flip them, that won't happen. 

To reiterate, it's not the charging current that kill it, it's the shorting on the charging connector.

Poor trigger discipline, like guns, is a real thing with esk8s. 

Sadly, someone on an evolve passed away from falling off when he hit the trigger when not expecting it.  I can find source if you want it. 

Personally I caused about $400 of damage to my own board when it went flying when I wasn't expecting it. 

I always power off my remote when not in use as a reflex now.

Mine was caused by a remote calibration issue, after I turned off the remote I was taking my helmet off and putting that in my bag then suddenly the thing takes off like it was suddenly possessed by a demon.  I think the trim pot had been moved before I turned it on, which made the fail safe not right.  

Anyway now I always lean it against a wall just in case and have sorted out the remote issue.

I thought that was a sure thing too. But for some odd reason on one build I had, it would go full throttle after the remote turns off. Luckily I found out when the board was upside down on the wall rack. Fail safe checked so if remote is turned off whole throttle it would coast to a stop. I re-detected the motor and redid vesc settings and it didn't happen again. Still paranoid about it though

the weird thing was that this was already done. I had it on the bench, turned off the remote mid throttle and the motor slowed to a stop. I've been on rides where I turned off the remote and had the board on for 10+ minutes. But one day it just started doing that. I tired it a few more times and it seems like there was a 25-30 second delay after the remote turns off and the motor goes full throttle. I think it had to do with the remote trim settings. It's never happened again since. Now I just leave the board on and remote off for 10 minutes on the bench just to be sure.

I TRIED the Hoyt puck and just didn't like it that much. I got accustomed to the modded GT2B mods...it's not really a thumb vs index finger issue as I do like Boosted, and Backfire's thumb wheels. My issue is the massive puck that I need to grip. It's like a water bottle cap. I'm guess it would just be something to get used to. The build quality does feel very solid. I've said it before, they need to thin in down, make one side of it with the plastic they use to make slide pucks and velcro it to a glove then it would be function over form.

I'm just poking fun at a commonly thrown around 'factoid' that doesn't take into consideration real world conditions, _efficiency_, and the specific contextual application. It's like one of those fun things professors love to throw around like law when it doesn't take into account the application. It makes more sense when one understands the many different factors at play.

Yes, electric motors have a constant torque profile that is proportional to the amperage given. The statement you made is often used in comparison between electric motors and IC engines, and it's due to differences in how the torque/power profile presents, in turn due to the mechanical differences between electromagnetic rotation vs linear-rotational power generation. 

Now when we're talking real world, application and environment are king. In terms of our application in esk8, having constant torque would require a different control system than what we're currently using. The fact that we're using current based control mixed with duty-cycle/voltage variable input for speed makes the aforementioned assertion a bit less meaningful. We don't operate on a constant current (torque) control system, it would be hell to ride if so. 

This right here is exactly why I put together the soon to be released BDE Calculator, to give a bit better insight on the constant-power profile across any given duty cycle range.

Neeeeeeerrrrrrdfight me lover.

@PatRocks can I ask what you are using to secure everything to the deck? I'm at the point in my build where it's time to start mounting and finalizing things, and I am not quite sure what to use. I know some people mount to the deck, and some mount to the enclosure

Lol, a variety of things. Carbon fiber brackets hold the batteries, 3m VHB tape holds the dual focbox enclosure, and a velcro strap holds the capacitor pack and benchwheel receiver. The strap also secures the esc wires.

EDIT: just in case you wanted advice as to mounting to deck vs enclosure:

My batteries are so heavy, their "enclosure" **_is_** their mount. Nothing else would work for that. 

To answer the possible question, my thoughts are mount to DECK, protect with enclosure. @ryansinatra

@ryansinatra, are you going to route the cables through the holes on the bottom of the nese modules? That's where they are meant to go. I see that you have both ends crimped, that probably means that you have to remove the crimps from the balancing connector.

That's correct, and not mutually exclusive from my ramblings above.

The gist of what I'm saying is that quoting a single property of a semi-complex control system doesn't really add anything to the topic at hand. It's like quoting Ayn Rand out of context (haaay Brian!).

So I prodded for the statement to be expanded upon and in true Brian form he googled a graph which doesn't demonstrate any understanding of the property he was trying to quote. 

How electric motors work is only one piece of the puzzle, especially when we're operating on a variable power system.

At risk of oversimplifying this; in the context of a BLDC motor being controlled by a VESC-style ESC, voltage = rpm and amps = torque. Current control systems provide up to X amps (dependent upon how much the motor actually pulls based on load) and a linear duty cycle (voltage = rpm) from an input, to create a method to control our motors that doesn't just toss us off our boards recklessly. 

This is just how @b264 and I flirt with each other. :kissing_heart:

Anyone know where I can get phase wire extenders for Torqueboards 6374 motors? I'm trying to go dual 6374, but I think I don't have enough clearance to put both motors on my rear trucks, so I'm trying to put a motor on my front truck.

Raise the plastic flange with a exacto knife or something like that. With the flange lifted you should be able to pull the crimp out.

very nice to mount the motors underneath the tail like this. Maybe its a new area for a new kind of bumber (or tailbone) to protect the motors while leaving the sidewalk.
The best option for me to try out a belt driven board in the future is to mount the motors like you did.

Reverse mount is not the best. Especially with that kicktail I got there. Can't kick up the board like before because of the motor/mount, I just have to be extra extra careful. Only benefit here was the motor no longer rub the phase wires if I lean hard

Yeah it's a hummie, it would appear the factory did not degrease the release wax from the top carbon layer, and as a result the top lacquer coat simply peels off. I applied some masking tape, and as i removed it the lacquer came off too. So the lot has to come off ready for a frit session!

Annoying but hey, I'm just sitting here clicking refresh on my unity tracking anyway lol

Hey @Hummie its all good, Ill degrease it with some acetone and epoxy some frit on it, it peels off in sheets with a blade easily, so worth sorting with the factory for the next batch, mine were from the gloss batch, maybe the satin finish latest batch are better idk, cant wait to ride it though :slight_smile:

These would be Nylon printed prototypes of the upcoming Midnight Puck from Hoyt St. 

One of them started life like that and then became the modified FrankenPuck you see there. It's still mostly Hoyt on the inside but I dropped in one of the Milspec throttles I'm using on the OSRR along with copious amounts of potting silicone and JB Weld. It's got a good weight to it now, throttle response is amazing and has a higher amount of travel than the stock Puck.

Nice job! I have the same idea. Did you test this strip in salt water. Looks a bit like plated steel.
Here's a seller with strips in different widths when you use them without holders.

The strips are bought from nkon so they should be legit.

I have not tested them in salt water and if I wanted to check for sure I would just PMI them.

In any case nickel is a lot softer compared to steel and you can easily tell the difference when handling them (bending, cutting etc)

My experience is that no matter source anything is possible. I bought my first one from some known battery building company. Paid double the price as for pure nickel. It covered whole in rust after two days in salt water. They simply didn't check what they received from factory. After that I always check. 
You are right that steel i slightly stiffer. My pure strip has a bit different surface than yours and that's why I said that you could check it. I most likely different production process. On your pictures this surface is like satin (don't know how to describe it) which looks a bit like electrolytic plating. 
Any way you are probably good ;) just want to share my experience :)

Ok you got me here. I'm a biomed engineer so devices like this are my favorite. Without cheating or seeing how big the rest of the instrument is.... I'm thinking it's using ultrasonic or light reflective emitter/reader to quickly do the differential math and give you a static value that relates back to the material property. 

Second guess is 2 contact probes measuring an electrical current or heat difference.

Set me straight here before I'm forced to search it

Hey, I would like to order these pcbs for my 6p 30Q packs that need to handle 70A without getting too warm
They would be used in double stacked config so 2 pcbs for each series connection
Can you help me out with the layers since I can not find much info about the ampacity of pcbs and the layers
And I guess making the strips wider would be cheaper than to put more layers

@thisguyhere I guess you could help me as well?

not me, i just used @akhlut's pcb design...

but...i wouldn't rely on the thin copper layer on the pcb for that kind of amperage.  there's very little copper on the pcb.

i use copper strand or nickel on P group bus.

I'd tack weld a strip of nickel to the PCB.  Flow solder into the nickel-copper interface then weld to the nickel.

So you plan (2) 3p stacks back to back, connected with a braid buss?

It's a cool looking helmet. I like the removable chin protection. But that goggle is totally stupid for esk8. Without the goggle it's not bad, just got to turn my head a lot more. It wasn't until I saw that picture that I realized how insanely small the hole is!

Do you mind linking me the strip @thisguyhere ? 

But if the pcbs could carry the current that would be amazing as well :smiley:
I may even be considering running thin pure copper/aluminium bars and just soldering the strips to them  
Since one strip can handle 20A fine, there should not be any problems if the bars are properly secured to the fish paper under the cell

The 6p packs just needs just too many nickel strip layers to make the battery pack "fun" to make

That sucks dude. Glad it's just road rash because it could've been worse. With all the QC issues and lack of testing prior to shipping to the customer, I don't expect anything less than these types of things to happen. What's unfortunate is that failure on an eboard can be life or death. I don't trust Enertion's Raptor anymore because of all the issues I've had. The worst being the time when the motors instantly locked up at 30mph. I'm just waiting to snap an axle soon too. Shitty deal dude.

Extra insulation is needed between P groups. The shrink wrap that comes on the cells is not adequate for high vibration environment of esk8. Check the pic below.

I don't mind at all. That's what the open source is for. Thanks for the compliments.

What kind of screen is that? Also, why ESP32? Do you use the WiFi/Bluetooth for anything?

```
ESP32 is _fast_, lots of memory, has built in wifi/ble (as you know), has dual cores (which I'm not using the second core with this gadget).

The screen is a bit shit (128x128 1.44inch) but was on the ESP32 board that I bought ages ago (https://www.banggood.com/Wemos-TTGO-TS-V1_0-esp32-1_44-TFT-MicroSD-Card-Slot-Speakers-Bluetooth-Wifi-Module-p-1273383.html?rmmds=myorder). It has an ST7735 driver. I want to use one of the IL _something_ screens like what you are using and use the TFT-eSPI library so I can use sprites. At the moment whenever the screen changes it rewrites the whole screen (adafruit GFX lib).

This is a quick hack. Eventually I want to get one of these working as the client https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1GrcTKSzqK1RjSZFHq6z3CpXaS/New-Arrival-2019-M5StickC-1-of-Limited-Trial-Edition-ESP32-PICO-Mini-IoT-Development-Board-Finger.jpg_640x640.jpg

Also: I'm using BLE to send battery level notifications to my phone (using Blynk) on startup, and amphours used (and total) on power down. It's a work in progress. :slight_smile:

Thanks for the details and good luck with your developments.

I do like the esp32 a lot. I'm actually thinking of using it for the next generation of davega. It has enough memory to use micropython and that would speed up the development A LOT for me (I have a lot of professional experience with Python, unlike C++).

The only thing that worries me is the power consumption. I have read somewhere that it can can spike up to 1A, especially if you use wifi and bt simultaneously. AFAIK, that's more than VESCs can handle.

Ah interesting... hadn't thought of that. Although BLE is v-low power, and the power spike is very short... I thought it was more like 400ma but nvm.

I think micro-python is slowish on ESP32s (could be wrong) and I like to rely on libraries for a lot of my code (displays etc). Thanks again for the code help :)

It's just PETG. I was just showing the quality of the print.

If you make it thick enough it won't ever brake, but it would also consume a hell lot of filament. So, I guess it's just a matter of finding the sweet spot in between. I had to go through a few iterations to find the weak points and beef them up. It's been pretty good so far. Also I brush on a thin layer of epoxy to smooth the parts out for painting. It also provides additional stiffness and strength.

Yes,eboosted Evo39DS enclosure.
With the discharge bypass BMS, the enclosure becomes a large battery pack and the FOCBOX Unity is screwed to the deck side.
Inside the enclosure, BMS and FOCBOX unity face each other.
However, removing the enclosure separates the BMS from the FOCBOX unity and facilitates maintenance.
The 7S cells column had to arrange 10P in a rectangle.
Also, use a slightly thicker gasket to slightly increase the internal volume of the enclosure.

No, a lot of it has to do with perimeter coverage.  I mean, it might, but its hard to remove CF & Epoxy, so I would just do the entire deck.  If you wanna try adding some rigidity without adding layers I'd suggest cutting a piece of 3/16 aluminum stock to the size of your enclosure, epoxy it to the deck, then screw it to the deck, screw down the middle and the sides.  You can use inserts or coarse thread screws.  Then cover it with a thin sheet of rubber or neoprene.

There is absolutely no steering when tilting the board. The only way to steer is to lift the front foot and hop in the desired direction.

Took a while to learn it but now it's fun.

That's what happens when you make compromises. Still, the nice thing about DAVEga is that it's pretty rare. Imagine you would search for DAVEga enclosures in thingiverse. You would likely find [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:403110) if we named it Dave or [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:573548) if Vega, none of which is particularly useful if you're after an enclosure (though I admit the Dave minion is rather cute).

The ["DAVEga" search](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=davega), on the other hand, only gains one false positive, which happens to be the Proton case. :)

Are there any other changes to the trucks than this little doodad? Have they actually fixed the issues they had before? They sure look the same

@ryansinatra  recommend insulating the solder joint, they look a bit too close for comfort.

I'm not sure but the second parallel xt connector but it doesn't seem to have enough surface area/contact points with the silicon wires.

I will insulate everything with some liquid electrical tape for sure. 

The connections have just as much connected area as any other xt60 connection would have so it didn't seem like it would be an issue. 

I saw @mishrasubhransu do it this way so that's why I opted for it since it saves space

@ryansinatra, please strip a slightly bigger chunk of the insulation and keep the soldering iron on there for longer while pushing more  solder into it. I believe only a few strands are soldered now. 

Second, what kind of liquid tape are you going to use? You should, in addition, place couple of slices of fish paper in between.

I also think this angle is deceiving. It's a rather large chunk of strands that is soldered it's just more underneath the wire. I pulled on it and looked at it a lot and it's solid but I'll take a second look.

I genuinely believe in the potential of this motor design, and in the potential of Maytech as our go-to for esk8. Also, @hyperIon1 , I'd  like to thank you again for your efforts in coordinating with Maytech on this product. 

To those who are interested, I am very excited to do my part in documenting my experiences with these products. As I mentioned, I'm going on vacay, but I hope to publish my work by the end of the month.

This seems pretty excessive! But hell, I'm all for innovation and trying it out. How's it working for you? You should do a 3D printed case for the PCB. 

I use slide gloves too, but I just keep the controller more vertical in my grip so it nustles against the puck itself, and use retractable clips on my belt, and if I need to use both pucks I just let go of the remote- not ideal for having remote control wheel sliding, this would be better for that for sure.

I took a similar photo next to some deep water, so it would be 100% gone if it went in, at first I put the board near the edge and thought it should be fine then I got scared and pulled the loop key.

Hey Dudes! 
A friend asked me if i could build him a riptide with more range. 
I didn't know how to get more range for it except a bigger battery. So i designed a enclosore where i can place a 10s3p battery and a 2 focboxes. 
If you need the files for it, please send me a pm. ✌️
Soon ill upload some pictures of the finished 3d printed enclodure.

Most antisparks are unreliable and prone to failure unless they are the precharged type.

I know how you feel, even I was a bit nervous after tearing it apart 

The best thing is that the belts were extremely quiet even at full speed, couldn’t even hear them, just the sound of the wind and wheels rolling, now I want even more a direct drive board, the feeling is amazing

Upon tearing it apart I discovered why it was quiet

Now I have to restrain myself for at least a month before getting it dirt again

The truth is I desperately need a mountain board, with gear drives, completely sealed motors and everything made to be cleaned with a hose, it’s soo much fun riding on the mud

the very one yet my ultimate plan was foiled, however, when I discovered Stooge Street Wheels are not sympatico with the Haggy Kahua step-down axle. :) 

Incredibly, the Bergmeister wheels do not bite the 121cboards Aileron deck (my foot is another story) .  

Edit; I will manage the risk and install a front freebord s2 on it; the ability to always-ollie sounds useful and fun on pneumatics and this Aileron does have a little flex in it.

Last I checked, all the vendors were sold-out

I've ordered a bunch of them and they are hit-and-miss.  I don't feel like FOCing with them.  I'd rather buy them already working.  I know a lot of other folks would too.  @psychotiller and @JLabs sold them but last I checked they were out of stock.  

Ahh it looks like ['tiller has them in stock again](https://psychotiller.com/collections/frontpage/products/mccloeds-blue-tooth-modules) and [bkb has them](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/parts/products/vesc-bluetooth-adapter) again as well

Yeah very tight.

Lenght of that box is 220mm, width of the board is 220mm, max print area of my printer is 220x220...

Cells + fiberglass separators will take 200mm which leaves me with 10mm each side for mounting holes.

Havent't even checked if I will be able to fit unity + diebiems on the remaining space >.<

I don't know what you mean with hit or miss. I flashed like 20 of them and they all work. I have been using the same 2 across different vesc at 10s and 12s. To be honest I didn't know they could even fail due to the flashing.

I know what hit or miss means. I didn't understand whether you refer to the flashing process or the Hm clone working with latest Android firmwares. The one yuu buy from vendors are 90% clones. There are clones that work with oroeo ecc even if not flashed that is the "hit" others and more common won't work without flashing. If you need a clone module that works with Android ecc I will send you the link.

In general I hate the look of glass frit. 

These last few ones of yours, especially the Haya, are turning me on to it a bit. 

How is grip in the wet? How would you compare the grip to viscious grip tape? Does it wear down over time? Is it more functional aesthetic, or can an argument be made that it works better than coarse grip tape?

Personally I would think it would grip better than normal grip tape. Just because of the larger pieces that would jab into your shoes. However it’s know to ruin clothes and cut hands if not coated with enough epoxy on top

I tried to make a little story. Haha. Thanks for noticing :)

Torque is pretty good and that too at 5S(some random battery that I had, because my pack is not ready yet), and braking felt pretty good too. You get a sense of that  from the end of the video when I stop. But the brakes won't hold me when I am waiting at red light on slope. Ride feels very smooth maybe because it lacks the usual noise. 

Once I get an enclosure and proper battery, I'll post more videos, plots and opinion.

Thanks @b264 for the deck. Although it's temporary deck for these drives, it works great with the pneumatics in relation to wheel bite.

@KaramQ  This deck could be a good option for skaters who need smaller electric boards.
I got an eye on this company from the very first day, but this board turns out as crap.
Does a focbox fit into the case where the esc has been?
And do you know if there is a chance to get just the deck without any electrics?

I tried fitting two focboxes but it’s a little to small, the board is shit but I love the deck and it has brake lights and front lights you can attach to a vesc. It can fit a 10s3p battery in it. Only real problem I encountered is how stiff and small the deck is.

Oh yeah, when I got this thing, it got run over and it didn’t take any damage. The only electrics I have in it are the hubs. I broke the board within two weeks of getting it, battery drained so badly I couldn’t get a mile. The company is a rip off, they say it’s made in  Alhambra, but it’s made in China and there customer service is terrible. It does have this lcd screem on it, not sure how I can hook it up to a vesc

1. Any rubbing issues on deck or kingpin or motors hitting truck or anything at all out of curiosity?
2. Where did you get that front handle / shredlights holder thing? Looks 3D printed yeah? Do you have a link by chance? Would love to print one (find someone to print me one rather) if you don't mind.

Thanks! Any other info you think would be good to know since I'm setting up the same thing is welcome as well.

Hey @Jansen

I've literally only just finished the build today but didn't get to test it yet since it's looking cloudy out and I don't wanna risk the board getting wet during a test run.  I used a 1/2" riser and no motor bite issues to report.  The handle can be purchased [here.](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/esk8-3d-print-parts)  

This build was pretty straight forward and is my cleanest one to date.  Alot less moving parts to worry about since each component is self enclosed.  Battery houses both the charge port and antispark switch, Unity housing the bluetooth module, no extra canbus or split ppm cables to worry about and the pièce de résistance being the Torqueboards Direct Drives not having to deal with belts and pulleys.  This is all there is under the hood.

No Old school deck yet. I come from the 80s skate scene and skated as a semi professional a  while longer the popsicle decks took place in street skateboarding. I had about 130 street and pool decks so far(old school and new school), and started electric
skateboarding the first day on a dane burman 8,5 from Zero and it was awful with this Onan x2 i ride underneath. After a few lazy and uncomfortable rides i decided to do my homework on longboard decks to find the right thing for me. And finally I found a few very impressive decks I can ride safely with a kind of a bit aggressiveness.I need a larger wheelbase for electric skateboarding than i needed before without any power.
My interest in this shorter carbon fiber deck from enskate is because i think the ordinary street skate scene is asking for some sort of board like this. Street skaters do not have a sense of interest in longer boards(mostly not in the beginning) and that could be the reason for the boosted board mini.
For myself i am totally happy with my decks and my boards in general.Maybe i would try an old school deck, but with smaller sized wheels maybe 80mm or something.Now I'm on 93mm wheels and i ride very soft bushings(nobody can handle that hahahah)
and thats the reason why old school or popsicles would not work for me because i get massive wheelbites and risers make this kind of decks feel like skating a skyscraper hahaha

Yes you can charge and monitor voltage at the same time, that's why there is a charge port on the pocket voltmeter.  Here's the model and build instructions, you just solder the volt meter leads in the middle of the charge port and pigtail.

I read up on it. Found the thread on how to set that up. I initially thought that these were commercially available to purchase. I didn't realize you have to make them. 

I just placed an order to make it. This should help me see the volts and amps while I charge. Pretty sweet setup. I'm a minimalist. I only have the charge port and loopkey installed on my enclosure.

Kegel hub adapters for my gear drive or pulleys. Submitted the order like a month ago and during that time we discovered that tb wheels are flipped.

I only made these just to test the concept and probably sell most of them for really cheap

Can probably solve the flipped kegel problem. Ive asked them if I can make new shafts.

Those pillars you see are removable so it should be possible.

Also I want to make a single hub adapter that works for kegel and flywheel - but that wasn't really a thought a month ago

No rain, but unfortunately the battery I was sent by Torqueboards only charges to 46.2v which makes it a 11S4P instead of 12S. Will have to put the board test on hold until I can get a working 12S battery in abit.

56.2/4.2 is something like 13.5?

that cant be correct or else your over charging?

Tried with 2 different 12s chargers but no go.  Thought it was the battery indicator programmed for 11S but the Unity was showing 46V so something wrong with a P group or BMS connection.  Have to send it back for repairs, currently waiting on an RMA but ordered another battery in the meanwhile so I can get this board up and running.

the PU still sucks on the Raptor hubs. and yes I thought about it for a long time before ordering the 4wd TB DD. basically if I ever wants to build a 4WD it cannot be belt driven with reverse mounts sticking out at the front of the board, and I ride low so no motor under the board. the natural answer is DD or hubs but i already got all the good hubs.

You have a tendency to double post and generally over post in the picture thread. Like a lot.


You can put multiple pictures in one post.  Also, you can start a build thread and put more often picture updates there.

I tried to open it but couldn't :(. Might have to make a 3D printed part(that screws in into the 6 holes where the kegel adapter is mounted) to pull the can out.

[quote="mishrasubhransu, post:94, topic:77910"]
the stator size is 53*42mm as per Kenna’s reply to me through email.
[/quote]
Also has 18 magnets whereas the usual 63mm motors have 14 magnets. So that means a 28% increase in torque if magnets were of the same size.

yes and no. You can also just pull the motor can out from the side. That depends how the stator is fixed inside. If it just but the 12mm nut in front then this technique won't work because the stator will follow the magnets. If it is fixed then you will remove the motor can only. It's normal that is extremely hard, the magnetic field is really strong in brushless motors.
Otherwise yes you need a 3 harm puller. I got it from Ali https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Doersupp-75mm-3-Jaw-Bearing-Puller-Auto-Gear-Remover-Pulling-Extractor-Reversible-Legs-Car-Van-Wheel/32860163360.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dfvSYRK and works fine. You can also print it there are some on grab cad https://grabcad.com/library?page=1&amp;time=all_time&amp;sort=recent&amp;query=puller.

Anyway also in this case you need the initial gap from the motor can and the rear part, so you can only pull by hand.

I have those bearing pullers, but I have a feeling the stator is held on the shaft somehow. So If I pull the whole motor out, it will destroy those mounting points or even the stators. Do I make sense?

no you won't if the stator is fixed as I think it is, the front nut is to stop the motor can from sliding out, you will only remove the motor can and magnets and leave the stator. The motor can with magnets is not in contact with the stator, it's a sleeve.
So basically close ![image|690x388](upload://eu0vM4d97AqyIkbgvFJhus4HVIu.jpeg) 

when you pull the motor can out....watch out your fingers, never release the motor can while you are doing it.

Cool mate!
I'm also going to print entire enclosure.
Most of the things I have figured out, but I'm not sure how to seal it so it's water resistant, how are you going to do that?
Here's what I got currently:

Find a rubber strip and then add an indent to your enclosure and slot it in?

Yeah that was my 1st thought as well but then I realised that the board is flexing a lot(trampa) so I have nice seal but then step on it and there's no seal...

Until I find a better way I will just print a cover for it which will be sealing it, so print - print instead of print - board, but that adds to the thickness.

It seems the way you have mounted your stator is different from how elofty has. After removing the M12 nut, and all the tiny m2.5 bolts, I can't budge the can. Take a look and let me know what you think

I think is the same except that they have rear bolts attached to the rear stator pipe. So once you removed all the screws the resistance you feel is the electromagnetic field and probsbly because the rear stator pipe is press fit with the motor can.
To better understand I am pretty sure the motor Can can be removed and the rear balck plate stays there with the stator.

 Mine might not be super water resistant because I added a a kind of grille with a questionable water barrier. I only really want it to be reasonably splash-resistant tho. A bead of silicone around the perimeter makes a nice seal ![enclosure%20vent|690x348](upload://6h1vUHyTpRQCOhfxDftgrAuAfnm.png)

I was curious, and as Flipsky ask me to open the motor ^^ I open all I can around me :smile:

This is just the outrunner cage length, and width yes ;) 

Also because I would order some MTO6880 ... [spoiler](or 8085...)[/spoiler] and they are the same as the MTO6374 that I ride since summer 2017, really strong and well made. So I want to compare them with the FS6380 from the inside. And DAM! if it was made as well as the Maytech it will be really strong with the 53.5 magnets instead of 41 ^^  
What I like is the square size of the rotor 53x53.5mm... It sound like the gold number to me :laughing:

I'm lost, I think I would love to make my custom motor :rofl:

I'm still very happy with both of mine. I've kicked up the speed faster than I should (depending on part of course) and it prototypes well in addition to printing fine detail work. I can't recommend it enough.

I am thinking about soldering 3 x 10mm wide nickel strips.
Another option would be to remove the silicone sheath from the wires but I am not sure this would be enough.

I will tell you one thing though. It's a tight fit with a 12s3p even with the unity which has a small footprint.

Oh well, that is 1-2 hours setback at the most. I was hoping to test the board today but it is raining so no big deal.

It is. Unfortunately I do not have any available at the moment and it would still be a little thicker compared to nickel strips.

The good thing is that due to the pack's construction I will not loose flexibility in either direction.

That is the new Jet Killshot... tailored made for motha fuckin esk8!

It has an extended nose and tail to accomodate larger wheels (aka 6shooters) and has one of the most comfy pockets I have tried.


@psychotiller helped me secure some unpainted ones..

Prime for skinning and customs with CF or FG skinned emclosures.


Really comfy decks and I can't wait to get some of them knocked out!  If anyone is interested in a custom deck and enclosure with that killshot, shoot me a pm!

@lrdesigns I have found flashing works better.  If you set that board down and step back 50 meters, it just looks like a solid light.  Won't grab your attention at night.  Now turn it to blinking and step back 50 meters.  It's so visible now....

Thanks a lot :blush: 

It always seems higher than it is, when I jump 3 feet it feels like 9 feet :laughing:. I think it is important to increase the height/airtime in very small steps to minimize the risk and get used to it. Almost eveytime when I took two steps at once I crashed and it hurted. Between my first time in dirt park and this pictures are 2 years so I had time to practice but I still can't jump all kickers there and also crash sometimes so good protectors are a must. Also only jump when you are in the right mood, there are days where it's better just to ride.

![165601|690x388](upload://9sYaZRliC16nCk7IlHBRjd4Ypuu.jpeg) 

Personally I prefer plastic hard shells everywhere because you can slide on gravel or stones without hurting yourself or damaging the protectors.  But I got several grazes after harder falls underneath the protectors maybe because they can shift a bit. But at least you get a clean and not a dirty graze :ok_hand:

Made in germany is a trademark that offers a lot more then from other countries and in my opinion the only country which can do technology like the americans can. The only problem i realize here in germany is that it feels a bit a like camping behind the moon hahahaha. What i mean is that they are a bit after(slower) in realizing which things already work.

So all good man, i would buy and ride yours on another board:wink:
and im talking out of the blue, because i don't own hummies or mad storm yet :joy::joy:

Of course I am just mining but anyhow I am not taking about mad Fury, but mad storm. I know I should have gone for a different name. Since everyone got confused about it. For them I used 5he bigger stator I could find out there suitable for DD. I am just curious to see how they will do. No matter other drives.

Ahahaha no it's just because I consider hub motor and DD the same thing. I mean still direct drive. The ratio is 1:1 so direct drive

ahh okey, yeah i read a hummie thread where guys are talking about the discription of them "two motor styles".
Ok now i know that its the gear ratio for you what makes them similar, like jenso calls his gear drive, direct drive.

To me that makes more sense. Then the community had to find names to recognize them but both are direct drive. So same ratio motors are subjected to the same rules. For instance my mad Fury use mad hubs motors. They don't change performance between hub motor configuration and DD style one. Ame principle applied. Although the motors run way cooler due to them not be in the wheels anymore

@Mikaelj just to update you on how the the mounts fit:

1. Fit tighter than a nuns you know what! 
2. Can only fit 1 cross bar as it hits the hummie deck
3. Had to use 110 shoulder bolts to marry motor pully with wheel pully on street wheel and AT wheels. 
4 Snapped a bolt while trying to undo a truck mount :/ (can you hook me up with another nut and bolt please)

These mounts are a dream, easy to instal and look the part.... can’t wait to get this think on the tarmac :)

They have "no motors" written on every page of the website but it's brand new and too epic to not check out. So far I've only been going on school days when it's least likely to be busy. 

I've only been twice:

Once, nobody was there. The other time, one older guy was there and I politely asked if it bothered him if I rode it. He was cool. 

I think if I went on a weekend, I'd get some hate from hardcore bikers but who knows. BMX is cool so I hope they'd be cool too. :man_shrugging:

Yeah onboard. It’s rather low profile for a boost converter, so long as you keep the amps low I think it won’t get too hot. Will have to see.

Finally! That's fantastic. I also made a DIY vacuum. Waiting the ABS 3mm to come. I ended up connect 2 vacuum cleaner just to be sure the suction will be enough. May I ask e you how you heate it up the bigger sheet and the if yuu know temperature? Also what did you use for suction? 
I will use a garden heater for heat it up the ABS sheet since it won't fit inside my oven. 

Btw crazy nice build
I love low ride board!

You have to update if the bigger and less hole work or not and also if  the seal on the edges of the vacuum box is needed or not.   My biggest frustrating is in drilling all the holes. 

  My big sheet was 12x24 and I was able to fit it in my oven top shelf.  For some reason the top shelf was about 1/4 inch wider then the lower shelves.    Because the sheet was all the way on top I had 2 over cooked spots on each end of the kydex sheets.  I used .08 kydex sheets.   I used a old shop vac as suction for suction.
I cooked my kydex to about 365 to 370degrees.  
I also used a heat gun and small blocks of wood to shape the enclosure edges and details.   
My next project is to build a heat box. I also need to redo the vacuum box because some of the holes that I drilled was too big and it left some round suction marks on the flange of the enclosure.   I don't have any old heaters so I might use 2 burners ($15) or just used a heat gun.  I am a little paranoid about cooking abs and kydex in my kitchen.   

What does your mold look like?

My sheets are 60x40cm, so slightly bigger then yours. The holes are not a problem as long your mold includes lateral flanges. Moreover Is good habit to lift a bit the mold to allow better suction, since the contact patch between mold and the vacuum table is where looses details. Here is the mold I am gonna use it. It's based on the deck I design it. So everything after the flanges will be removed. It also allows you to give the right concave.
I am going to make it 3D printed or out of wood. Depends how much time I have.

The mold looks great.   I thought about using rised up flanges but decided not to because it was my first time using the big vacuum box and i only had one large kydex sheet on hand. 

I see now.  Rise up flange will let you mold to the board better and you don't have to care about vacuum marks on the side if the enclosure.  

Heats from the  heated abs and kydex will not melt 3d printed mold?

Yes the 3d printed mold will be good only for 1 or maybe 2-3 tries. Then it's over. If I have time I will make it out of wood. I have a small router so I would need to CNC it in 2 parts at least.

I plan on using the auto pulse feature on the welder so that each system is completely isolated.

Yes because of the big bearing I thought it's the 6880.

The stator length e.g. on SK8 or similar 6374 is 46mm. How does the 8085 feel compared to 6374? Never tried a bigger motor than 6374 so I'm curious.

Honestly, I can’t really tell. I had them just for a short test ride out today. Wasn’t quite confident with the board setup, so was just cruising around. For now I would say it’s not worth the extra weight and less range compared with a 6384, but that might change after I modified them and had some more time on the road.

Thanks. It's funny when 18650 start to look tiny. I'm really impressed about Samsung 30T and 40T when looking at discharge diagrams. Here a 30T (because of same capacity) and VTC6 @20A

![VTC6_20A|690x378](upload://o86hQoncQLTGTZiwA7Vi7o0UBUv.png) 

Not real life draw but even more dramatic difference in voltage sag and capacity @30A.

![VTC6_30A|690x393](upload://uGM34CXXEf0NRbgtWt1eQqaK39F.png) 

The Samsung cells keep almost the 3Ah (or 4Ah) no matter how hard they get discharged. Definitely on my future list.

Also, all those components are a really tight fit, so the mounts will ship precision aligned preinstalled on the hanger.

Thank you! I've spent a lot of time on the aesthetic design of them. Lots of iterations later this is what I got to.

It's inherently a little more pricy from a manufacturing standpoint compared to others, due to a higher part count, but I think it looks nicer.

@rich let’s give you a small comparison between the aps 6384 stator and 8085. even if the weight can’t be compared completely it’s non the less interesting for me to see.

![image|600x500](upload://aGj3k2le6FVSSzBfURjtwdAG1LI.jpeg) ![image|597x500](upload://tD84X6DzLGTnVIT0iQ0P7Jlwxpc.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://iyZw2d3GcGFBM599WfKs7HKo2q7.jpeg) ![image|378x500](upload://nu1vdzlu3aMkKV65QZdU2doyncE.jpeg) 

There is so much unused space in the 8085 stator. Could be filled up way better.

As i have the motor apart i now also started to battle harden the motor with epoxy.

@mishrasubhransu what an amazing idea, I will have to scan both the Hummie deck and the bigben enclosure to make my custom end cover

My initial plan was to buy some colorful wrap, but this looks way better

In my experience using Meshroom your model looks rough, good enough for use, but still 

You will probably get a better result by making a more regular pattern, a bunch of lines , and then another bunch of lines 90° from the first set

Meshroom captures details really well, even a really shallow wood grain In lighter wood works really well

Did ou tried without any marking?

Yeah, I tried without the marker and it didn't work well. Got surface roughness of like 2cm. Randomly scribbling them made them better. You know what the wall was captured so well. while the while table wasn't mapped at all. So it all comes down to fine texture. 

I don't think regular pattern will work well because it will have a hard time finding matches because the algorithm will reject points that matches too many other points. 

The next time I do it, I'll
1. Put finer texture on the deck using marker again or wrapping it with some newspaper/wallpaper.
2. Give it a background(put down newspaper on the table) so that it's easier for the SFM(structure from motion) algorithm to get good estimates of the relative transformation between different camera poses. 
 I also should have put a textured background. 
3. Play with smoothing node of meshroom, which I didn't do yet. 

I would be absolutely lovely if I can make a parametric model for a deck and some optimizer can modify the parameter to best fit the scanned model.

Yes, true, I see what you mean ;)   
This little size proto is just for fun, I like the surf style deck. It will be my second one (made DIY). And the 1st one got a wider front (shape/design) like you're advising (but also 45cm wide ^^ 150cm long), I will maybe make the little one :smile:.  
About the previous big one, it turn really easy (thanks to DKP and 30/40mm of riser). The bad thing, is its fully flat ...

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_201010_194550.jpg

Right now, about the proto, if I decide to ride it duck style (where I guess I need/use the most of space on deck) it should look like this : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/dropbord-v6-v25b.png

I think making exactly the same in 35" could be fun ;) :+1: thanks for your feedback! 
 
I also have to think about wheel bite
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/dropbord-v6-v25d.png

With a shape (concave, camber, tail etc), it's really not my taste ...   
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/surfboard_enc-v3ax.jpg

It's why I make it flat cheap and easy, and I reserve for a version with a worked shape :

Looks very cool! I don't know the exact battery size, but would this fit the lifepo 123a (or something like that) cells from a boosted board? Or is it primarily for 18650s or 21700s? 🤔

E: come to look at it again, it looks more like 18650s.... Do you think it could be modified size wise if I wanted to fit some 21700s in there? 🤔 

I'm already thinking about a battery upgrade for my Spud.... 😂

## \#6161 Posted by: TowerCrisis Posted at: 2019-05-04T03:45:11.220Z Reads: 152

It is 21700!

Whole idea is about modularity. Likely gonna offer a 30T, a 40T, and a 50E model, although that's wayyyy out. So 201 or 268 Wh. Current should be really good considering it should do 60A sustained.

The pins are for a few things. Power in, power out, analog switch, and UART. The analog is more of a dead-mans switch for detecting if the battery is docked at all. The UART is for some more complex data and a power switch between the battery and other electronics I'm designing.

However, the UART isn't necessary. Even if communication can't be established the final production board can still run, it'll just throw an error on the remote and should operate normally.

E: BTW overall dimensions are 33mm x 240mm x 195mm.

Do Boosted and Lofty have the same wheel manufacturer now? Or are solid core wheels the new trend? Seems like an absolutely useless core option. Won't fit Abec, won't fit kegel, can't be swapped to the back drive wheels, won't support 4wd. Maybe stronger, but probably heavier too. I don't get it.

For the 63xx only the bell, plus a drop on the sensors as well as the hole where the phase wires come out. In my opinion this place of the stator can cut the isolation of the phase wires over time due to vibration. Epoxy fix the phase wires and with it also minimize the risk that your phase wires short. On the 8085 motors i now started to epoxy the stator as well as the windings and the epoxy used there looks shit. It’s not all ready yet, so can’t tell how it works out in the long term.

As long as you don’t have lose windings I don’t see an actual need to epoxy the stator as well.

I don’t know about this epoxy in specific, but I tried with clear epoxy first and it was a bit too fluent. It’s not bad, but you need to make every gap by its own than wait till it starts dry out before you can go over to the next which will take a bit longer to do the whole can. @sender bought some thickener you could mix in which allows you to do more gaps in one run. Don’t know the exact English word for it, sorry. But maybe @sender can link you to the product.

Yes I think the clear epoxy is a bit thinner than a regular 2 part mix. I bought some glass microspheres to mix into the epoxy to thicken it up a bit. I may need to add a lot with this particular type but I have a lot to spare so I’ll see how it goes

I’ve used something similar to that in the past. It might end up being more difficult to clean up than the liquid epoxy since you have to smooth it over with isopropyl alcohol afterwards. It would definitely be stronger tho. I take it this is different than what @b264 was saying not to use?

I didn’t took of heat shrink of the single wire, but the one for all three. I anyhow didn’t liked the one they came with. I first covered the outer part with tape than applied some epoxy from inside. After that I removed the tape and filled up the open spots with epoxy from the outside.

@lrdesigns in the jb weld @b264 mention had metal parts inside of the glue. That doesn’t work out well with magnets as it run around the magnet and on top as long as it’s fluent.

That is kinda funny. So what do you use then, just regular clear epoxy? 

I have used 90min clear you can get at a hardware store in the past. It seems to work but I am sure it gets soft when hot.

@lrdesigns get some 5min epoxy. With the 90min it take ages as you probably can do only 2-3 gaps and than need to wait till the epoxy cures before you can turn the bell to do the next gaps.

It’s worth a try. Probably a bit problematic if the bell doesn’t have a retaining ring on one site. Also not sure if really all epoxy run off the magnets than. You would definitely have to find the right amount of epoxy you place in the gaps before spinning up everything. And still 90min spinning is a lot 😅

Any reason not to use the putty epoxy I listed above? Seems convenient at least. I guess it does not wick into the tiny gaps but would provide some mechanical reinforcement.

I‘m not so familiar with jb weld products. But if there are no metal parts inside (which looks like) it’s worth at try. The 1h cure time is what would hold me from using it, but if you have enough time it shouldn’t be an issue.

This is a putty not a liquid which would have the consistency of firm playdough. So cure time is not really an issue. But it might have metal particles not sure.

I've got 2, the first one is what came with a Nuff board, so Onan x1. I bought a replacement x2 battery and it is supposed to be higher capacity option of what is available for the x2 and not flight safe.

![image|690x453](upload://3Oq2eHc9HmKoKCE5i5nZWpO8yQS.jpeg) 

The x1 battery is probably something like the 90WH battery based on performance.

As long as you stay at 10s I don't think the kind of cell you have will matter. The question is the BMS, the one in the pack is pretty weak, it's possible to trip it's own current protection if it's fully charged sometimes.
I think about changing the cells too.

EDIT: This is where I bought the extra battery from if you are curious https://www.ebay.com/itm/Onan-Extra-Battery-BP-20-X2-X3/303026163293?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649

yeah i know about the difference between the BP-10 and BP-20 battery pack. I think its a good thing with that 90wh pack if you travel a lot. 
...and yeah for my first battery build i would stay at 10s for sure, the question for me is now if I'm using another better bms if it would fit? Second option is to skip bms to get more cells in there. its tight but I saw a guy in here @faust who replaced the batteries in 10s 3p configuration by skipping the bms. that would be nice if i could do it the same way.

```
If you had the lower pack and wanted a bigger one I think it is probably worth it to rebuild with better cells if you wanted to get some experience building battery packs. I think if you cut out a lot of the internal walls you can fit a lot in there. You can get BMS that are small, I'd probably just stay 10s2p with better cells. If you have a higher volume pack, I don't think upgrading the cells will get a significant improvement. 20% at most, but that is a lot of work when you can just buy a second battery which is kind of the point of a replaceable battery.

Although, if you have the x1 like me, you are kind of screwed because the x2 has a different pin, so I had to hack my own connector, which adds to the fact you should probably just give up and make a different board.

That said, after building my own board, I prefer some things about the Nuff that is the weight is less and all in the back, makes carving so much sweeter.

I got the X2 4WD, and 4 battery packs. ordered 3 more yesterday directly from Onan china. One pack broke and i will use it for my first experience of building my own.
Like I said, I will stay at the original 10s2p configuration at first and if I do it right and it works, I will take the next step for more cells maybe later on because Im pretty happy with the power and the range in general. Its just for science

Depends how you ride. No one of my motors show any oxidation even after year, but I do not ride in the wet. Sometime happened that I rode in wet condition because I could not avoid it but I really try to do not do it. The PU wheels are just too slippery in wet conditions, fun for sliding but scary for the rest. 
Anyhow the gun colour you see is due to the fact that the steel has been oxidate to protect it from rust. Same for the inside. The stator can still rust but again water has to ge tin and I sealed them quite well.

I find that the Boas don't slide on wet floors like the black Abecs, then again its two completely different drives since the Boas are on a dual belt drive and the Abecs are on a single gear drive. 

Both are stiff decks and ride quality wise, i find the Boas absorb bumps better.

Also, thanks to @Andy87 for the vertical rack inspiration! I had to build one of my own after having too many boards lying around on the floor. Made an unintentional storage space at the base too.

I have found the opposite, my boas tend to slide in the wet more than ABEC 107 FlyWheels, but I agree they roll over stuff better.  Both of mine are dual drive, but my ABEC FlyWheels are on a Carvon v4 drive system while my Boa's are on a dual belt drive system.

I see the issue that it will just fit than for a specific mount length. As there is no standard in here for any motor mounts, it will be not so easy.
Maybe with open end instead of closed circle. Also what about people started using 6880 motors. Ok thats the smallest issue 😅 but just some thoughts on it.

What if to use like a 5 hole pattern and two parts so that you can adjust the length? It‘s not that smooth than but would work for multiple mounts. Last thing I think about other the mounting angle. They should be the same as well. Unfortunately that varies on different mounts as well.

sexy as hell, wide as fk, not that super nice to work with in  terms of motorguard like the MBS one

the TKP Hex 10mm is only 177mm , but have super modular design, this is the one you suggested in beginning of discussion !?!

This is the hypridzs, does this means it can use  as rkp or tkp ???

One last thing and than I promise I stop 😂

This guard will probably also only work for people who mount the motors back facing. Front facing I see clearance issues with either the enclosure or the ground on most builds.

Probably it’s more easy to just make a motor mount with integrated protection like on the good old etoxx mounts for the leopard motors and encoder? 🤔

Does anyone use studs instead of the shoulder bolts? Do they exist? I know haggy have their custom studs for their trucks but I’ve not seen anything on surfrodz.  I’m nearly done on building my new tkp drivetrain and the only thing that I can see pissing me off is the shoulder bolts when I get a puncture or snap a belt. 

Might try and decapitate a shoulder bolt and put a thread on it... they are as hard as nails so it’ll probably prove impossible....

I made a tool with a dome nut and a central pin to drive on the end of the stud. 

@Skunk it’s not that I don’t like shoulder bolts, it’s the taking them in and out of the helicoil and the fact that the grub screw is ending up under my mounts. I want quick and easy puncture repairs  and belt swaps.... 

If there’s a reason that this is a dumb idea feel free to let me know! (I will use a nyloc for the axle nut).

Hes a silly person.  12s4p does not sag with my 200lbs on it till under 20% and I ride it like the throttle is a switch. Then again my pack was built properly.  Not by me :sunglasses:

@Linny I'm sorry im a noob, i cant tell you about those specific trucks, but i can compare them to my other build which has calibre 2 base plates and fatboy 230 hangers with riptide bushings which are stable speed machines but lack in the turning circle dept. I just took this build for a test spin around the block and i now see why everyone raves about sr tkp trucks, they are real stable if you want them to be (only hit 24mph so far) but also carve nice and surfy too if you want.

More testing required!

It changes the motor Kv by weakening the magnetic field applied from the rotor, allowing it to spin up faster by decreasing torque.

Its matter of opinion. I like Seans build a lot, but there is no need for fake CF.
If you ask me, without vinyl wrap his build would be much more awesome to me.
Covering the deck in paint would look much more shiny and would have a much more high quality look.
Edit: I come from the street skating scene and we don't care about the look of our boards anyways:wink:

Definitely agree the process is where the fun's at. I love tweaking on these boards or seeing what kinda shit I can break and fix. The wrap was just my way of staying in budget (it's super cheap) and making the board look different from how I got it. If I had the time or a place, I would've gone the Sender skin route.

Like mentioned by @sender  you did a beautiful job with the wrap and it looks super clean, i like that. Im also jackin off senders artwork all the time because it  always looks awesome. Cant wait to see you doing stuff like that...
Something else: Good idea to mount those brackets on your green deck(looks like an hosoi  to me but not sure)this way. Massive brackets imo and very nice. im curios how this will turn out in the end. Where did you get those big, stable brackets from, Sean?

I didn't fall on the knee. I hit foot first into the ground and rolled. Pavement is hard. ER physician told me the initial impact milkshaked my meniscus. High velocity impact and torsion. That's why I didn't break anything and just have a locked knee now.

It actually feels really nice set up like this,  but its not what i want.  Need to find a regular skate deck i can mount on and maybe trim the deck a bit.

Dual 6374 168kV motors, 6inch pneumatics, 4:1 gearing, 12S, Unity. Unity decided it would be fun to lock my wheels when I was doing 55km/h. The rest follows. I hope I can at least drop the crutches soon. I will get a cane if I need it and engrave it with "Fuck Enertion" (just like fuckpushing, wish this was a joke). I managed to injure myself before I even created a build thread.

Idk.... i think something needs to be there.  Alot of leverage is being made with the extensions. 
Originally i wanted to do freeboard bindings on top of the plates. So i asked to have to top plates made larger than normal because i would be standing on them.

maybe you can use rubber foam for all over the deck except the raised mounts and then grip it. so you got some kind of shockpadgrip like exway and the height of the mounts is no more. And the benefit of the foam is it is still lightweight.
I mean this sort of foam which is used for camping to sleep on(don't know the english word for that)

Well it could have been sudden loss acceleration, but maybe with 4:1 gearing and 6 inch pneumos it felt like instant lock. I literally "ran away" from the board in a split second, leaving the board stationary. For that moment I was faster than Usain Bolt, against my own will ofc. Had to walk back quite a bit to get the board, so I assume it locked. It didn't ride afterwards too. Started cogging no matter what I did. My friend reconnected the battery next day and it worked fine again. Battery wasn't discharged, 46.7V of 12S.

The cogging part was interesting tho. It cogged both motors even if I held the motors by hand or didn't with the board upside down, no matter the throttle amount. Cogging was more intense at 100% of throttle. Then I headed to the ER, wasn't feeling like making a video of the cogging for some reason.

@murloc992 @Powadangaboards  wow I had heard of something similar happen to raptors but I think that was motor related, never heard about it with unity. 

Has anyone else seen this?

There needs to be some investigation to see if its firmware or some bad QC hardware issue that you guys got un lucky with.  I would think with all the high power boards on here running unities there would be more reports of this kind of issue. Its really scary. 

@Powadangaboards what is your drivetrain setup? And in what scenario did it happen?

Heads up ENDER 3 users… They use shit knockoff xt60 connectors and crimped instead of soldered the wires to them. Couldn’t handle the current while printing petg I’m guessing and got bottlenecked by the shit crimp connection.

Not my pic but have an answer :grin:

You find them on Aliexpress e.g.

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32803681278.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dqavcPA

Pay attention that you order one which looks like this on the back side

![PNG|443x390](upload://3FvpOgAfGPdBPdcWrWKYrvNUUxF.jpeg) 

and not like this (it takes much more space for the wires)

![02|470x253](upload://kjkVtA2CB48gmHErhwT2wnQvFlB.png) 

Also there are versions with 2 buttons

![03|393x439](upload://npsT0fIEYTPluQcpQPsBvEaAqmO.png) 

I don't post a link because I've ordered 3 and got 2 with 1 button only. Furthermore the left button has no function. It should be the power button and on the right button you switch between percentage and voltmeter. Percentage is useless IMO if you can't program it that e.g 3.5V is 0%.
```

Usually I wire this meter before the antispark switch or loopkey. I can monitor the battery while charging or anytime I want without switching the board on. The stand by consumption is very low. With the button you cycle between ON / PERCENTAGE / VOLTAGE / OFF
```

---
## \#6584 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2019-05-18T20:00:29.323Z Reads: 135

The left button works, you have to hold it in before you power it up.  You can choose the battery chemistry and series count.
```

## \#6585 Posted by: rich Posted at: 2019-05-18T20:14:04.638Z Reads: 137

:rofl:

That makes no sense to me. I can change settings with the cycle button when holding it before power up. The only reason why I ordered the 2 button version was because a forum member who use it told me the left is for swiching on/off and the right button for cycling between percentage and voltage. It would be nicer to have an additional on/off button instead of pressing it twice to read voltage.

I have 5 of them and they are different. Some have 1 small button on the rear, others not. Furthermore they have solder pads for 5 different modes (like switching off backlight after 10 seconds). I soldered 2 together which should be expert mode where 3.2V is 0%. Unfortunately it doesn't work.

It's too early for accurate feedback but the test welds are strong AF. The welding current is 1300A with nano-tech 3s 5Ah 65c-130C lipo. It's well made and the tips are huge compared to some other welders. I'll let you know how it performed after welding the first 12s6p. For now you can take a look at [pics from test welding](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dirt-machine-trampa-holypro-16-ply-vertigo-trucks-superstar-hubs-unik-polaris-6374-150kv-e-toxx-black-direct-drive-vesc-6-12s/45377/805?u=rich)

@janpom, Thanks :blush: Basically, you just plug the splitter into the ESC, plug 2 other devices into the splitter, and voila, they can communicate without issue :smiley: I'll be making a post about it very soon.

Great stuff. Looking forward to more developments.

I'm curious how the synchronization work. It seems non-trivial. Given the setup with DAVEga, Metr, and VESC, if DAVEga and Metr both send a request at the same time, will the splitter first relay one request and hold back the other one until it receives a response from the VESC, and only then it relays the other request? Or is it somehow more clever than that?

I will say though, that you are close in your guess but it is a little more clever :wink:

Wouldn't it work to make the DAVE read only by just connecting the RX and GND?
So Metr works like it is the only device and sends the getValue request, DAVE reads (by UART interrupt) whenever the ESC answers?!

And why are you using a fake name? You are the guy that spam Facebook group with how awesome your DIY board is and how easy it is to build.  But you can’t drill 4 holes in your deck.

If I were to guess, he is maintaining a mirror copy of all variables and paramters on the splitter by sending requests to VESC at regular interval. When either metr pro or DAVEga needs them, the splitter sends them that information. 

When a device sends write command it forwards it to VESC, updates the splitter copy of parameters/variables and sends a suitable response back to the device.
```

Yeah, something like that would make sense. It's obviously not possible to make a generic UART splitter that would work with any 3 devices so I guess it's tailored to be used with the VESC.

I wonder how well it works with Metr's TCP/IP bridging. That one allows some advanced stuff, including updating the VESC FW. I'm not sure how exactly that's communicated to the VESC. I imagine that it could involve sending multiple messages. If the other device (DAVEga) jumps in while that's in progress, that could very well brick the VESC.

@Ricco Is this something you have considered in the design? Will the splitter be safe to use for writing into the VESC?

Perhaps there's the implementation of priority read/write, where in the theoretical situation that you provided, the splitter would prioritise the signals from one of the UART device (the metr), and as such would prevent bricking?
```

## \#6634 Posted by: janpom Posted at: 2019-05-21T08:54:51.695Z Reads: 153

```
I'm just theorizing here. I don't know the details of the VESC communication protocol. I only use a few of the read commands. I imagine a scenario like this can be problematic:

```
1
METR -> VESC: write X1
VESC -> METR: ack write X1

2
METR -> VESC: write X2
VESC -> METR: ack write X2

3
DAVEGA -> VESC: read Y
VESC -> DAVEGA: Y value
```

IMO, the splitter has no chance to do the synchronization such that the following cannot happen instead:

```
1
METR -> VESC: write X1
VESC -> METR: ack write X1

2
DAVEGA -> VESC: read Y
VESC -> DAVEGA: Y value

3
METR -> VESC: write X2
VESC -> METR: ack write X2
```

Unless the splitter understands all the details of the communication protocol, it wouldn't know that after the `write X1` the `write X2` will follow, so it wouldn't know that it should delay the interleaving DAVEGA read request.
```

I see what you mean. Unless there's some clever metr control integrated, I don't see how it can be done without Sacraficing the capabilities of one or both of the connected devices. (Like one can write to vesc, the other can't).

But I would love to be proven wrong!

The very simple way to do the splitter:
```
thread1:
  // parse commands from Metr Pro and DAVEga 
  // and put [command,source] into FIFO queue

thread2:
  loop:
    // take the next command from the queue
    // send it to VESC
    // wait for reply
    // send reply to [source]
```
```

Right. Makes sense. What I'm questioning is whether all request/response pairs are independent. Maybe there are two request/responses from Metr that must be consecutive and if a DAVEga request/response happens inbetween them it will cause trouble. Can that ever be a problem?

I can think of about three different ways to multiplex or otherwise split a UART off the top of my head. None of which are special enough to merit being a "secret" as these are all basic commodity technologies. Maybe don't kill yourself too much here.

Yep. Most importantly it can step up/down based on voltage input dynamically. It's intended for solar but that's substituted with a battery input in this case.

Basically the thought is a mobile backpack charger. Any board with a BMS that can handle load sharing could "charge and ride" to extend range.

Impact safety sensor? Does that mean that if i drop the remote while riding by accident or on purpose the board will brake on its own? Sounds a bit dangerous i hope this feature can be disabled. Maybe a demonstration video would qualm my fears.

 " **SAFETY &amp; GESTURE Control:**  What is really exciting is the IMU unit inside this remote…The IMU knows the exact orientation of the WAND in space, whislt gathering acceleration values of all space axies at the same time. Benjamin has been able to code some really useful safety features &amp; playful things. For instance, the remote will know when you have a crash &amp; can therefore stop your board safely. It knows when it rests upside down on a surface, refusing to accidentally send a signal to the board. It knows when you pick it up &amp; it knows when its resting in a steady state for a while, going to sleep after some minutes to save battery. This remote is even a water spirit level, helping you to align things perfectly."

I'll start by stating that its an unnecessarily ridiculous pursuit that I'm playing with out of shear curiosity.
atm, it has a pixhack and rpi, with gps, power monitoring and stuff, mainly for data logging. AGAIN, I'm aware that there are more lightweight and easy to implement ways to do what i'm doing, its just what i want to do lol. I was super into drones and uavs and whatnot before getting into esk8, so i have a lot of parts laying around that ive decided to repurpose.
at the moment, im still playing around with apm control of the vescs, and the different protocols available. UAVCAN, TBS CRSF, a ground control station 'suit', wifi, ble, mavproxy, traditional ppm or uart, and different combinations thereof. 
once I settle in on a path/protocol, further integration and features.  

I know, I know.... but I'm having fun with it lol

well for example, it logs gps data, accel data, imu data, log all inputs and outputs, power state and usage, and other stuff. Likewise, it can accept a wide range of input types, as i'd like to play around with a few different systems.... standard pwm/ppm, sbus, tbs crossfire, ground control station.
Pretty much, i just have a lot of data logging, input/output options (not limited to a 2-3 input pwm channels or vesc uart data telem). I also have a raspberry pi in there to talk to the flight controller, which can act on the fc with python or whatever. 
I'm still tuning the whole thing out, finding which path works best for me. But i have the ability to very easily implement a number of control schemes, some simultaneously. 
If i were good at programming or circuit design, i'd just go about designing my own shit. I'm mediocre at best in both fields,  but I'm rich in parts, imagination and curiosity, so this has been my passion project lol <3

well i was going for a basketball and my friend decided to punt my the ball, missed and hit my finger. It fractured in two places and the nail went into my growth plate. Long story short the took off my nail and it was shredded in the nail bed, the removed it from the nail bed, put a pin in, and casted it for 3 months.

not as bad as ur injuries, but bad

Never get old you heal up so much slower. I had a fall a year ago on my board and a week later laying in bed I sneezed and felt my rib brake. 

Getting old sucks you just have to stay in some what shape so when you are 70 you don’t just fall to shit. I probably won’t make it to that age.

Those are hubs metasurf are developing.  Last I heard they are still working on final adjustments.  the pictures are engineering samples.  They work with Abec pullies.

My clunky Landy Evo build with pneumatics is not something I can really take with me when I go to places (ie. downtown with friends for a coffee, shopping), so I decided I'll build a tiny 22" pennyboard. 
In theory, it's supposed to fit 10s2p (double stacked) with a tiny BMS and a dual motor VESC. Mocked it up in Fusion360 and plan on 3D Printing it. Not yet decided if I'll vacuum form it with Kydex or use the 3D print as is. I'll release the STLs once I'm done with it. :slight_smile:

Hail him.


Also im a short board fan so im always interested in small enclosure options.  It looks good.  Would be cool to scale it up a bit to fit a 4p possibly on a different deck.
Everyone needs a light weight build.

Yes, It's modified on my cnc to eliminate wheel bite.

I have the top link on the front for lots of turn ability and the bottom link on the back for stability.  Its wicked stable at 32 mph but you can still do donuts in a small street with cars parked on both sides.

Hello Linny

they are not perfectly suited to the torqueboard 6380 but do the job anyway.

(make some changes)
the drillings at the bottom of the engines are not identical and must be modified.


in action it sucks hard extraction and prevents impurities inside the engine and cools properly despite the design not expected for this engine


ideally it would be better to create a specific 3D file to this engine

have a nice day:slightly_smiling_face:

The very first moment the brake disk hits a curb/rock/branch the disk will bend, wheel will block, sends you flying in consequence.  Offroad boards and exposed brake discs are no good friends. To close to ground....
