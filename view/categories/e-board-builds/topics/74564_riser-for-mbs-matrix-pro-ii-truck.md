For example, the set from Alien power systems look good, it would mount, but it doesn't quite look wide enough.

Any ideas where I can source risers wide enough?

Could be reasonably easy to design and laser cut a piece of delrin if you have the dimensions of the truck. I've 3d printed a few risers from ninjaflex (100% infill) that work nicely as well. You'd obviously need the dimensions of the truck though.

thanks @Deodand, what material did you use for your 3d printed riser?

Check out the E-Toxx website. They have wedges specifically for these trucks and I bet Jens @Nowind could make some flat risers for you.

@Nowind 

Just ordered the r5 (5mm flat, no angle) risers from you. Thanks, looking forward to adding them to my build.
