So I have completed my electric longboard and everything work fine (when board is upside down), wheels turn fine. When I put board on its wheels motors cant turn. When board is upside down and wheels turn i can stop it with my hand. I tried to stand on it and ride but same problem. If motors cant carry weight of the board leave alone  carrying me. I have dual motor set up. Motors are from Alien Power Systems 5065 Sensored Outrunner brushless motor 220KV 2200W. It runs from 8S4P battery.  I am using dual VESC as well
Anyone have any idea what can be wrong? Link to the video is attached

are you using a vesc?  if so, please post screenshots (not smartphone photos of your screen) of your motor, bldc, ppm tabs

Yes, I am using dual VESC. I will post pictures and video. As soon as i will find out how to attach it

your trucks are backwards but that's a different problem.

Yeah, i know they are backwards. i just put them on without thinking which way to put them on. Just wanted to see if it works

```
Your battery cutoff is set for 10S config
Your start is set at 33v
Your full charge is 33.6

If you want the start to be at 3.4 per cell it's 27.2v

Try pushing the board manually then push the throttle. Maybe that would work. Looks like you didn't plug in sensor wires. Are you running sensored or sensorless

I see. the voltage limits settings. so what should i type in there? for max input voltage is voltage of my 8S battery. how about min input voltage?and battery cut oof start and end, wtf is that?

Try 24v on battery cutoff start and 22.4v for battery cutoff end. Donâ€™t need to change voltage limits

did you do motor detection?

I also suspect the same thing, the battery cut off was set too high for 8s.
So when throttle is being slammed, the voltage dropped. That voltage dropped being knocked off completely by the battery cut off, hence no power distribution.

That's too low ,3.3-3.4 per cell is normal cut start
3.1-3.2 cut end

3.3 is 26.4
3.4 is 27.2

At 24-22v it's likely the BMS shut-off will kick in before vesc shuts off and no bueno

Yea this seems healthier for the batteries, but how much would it affect his range?
```

Yes it healthier, range will not be affected at all, there's no usable capacity at that voltage range, like a couple of feet

I was agreeing with your cut off values but ok

Hmm? A little confusion it seems

There will be no loss in range using 3.3-3.4v as the cut start vs 3v

My bad man I should have been more clear. Anyway if there isnâ€™t any difference in range op should definitely change his values

So everything worked fine when i had when i had 24 v cut off start and 22.4 v cut off end. Now as you suggested i changed it to 26.4 and 27.2 and one of the motors turn fine and i can't stop it with my hand but the other one can be stopped by hand. some weird shit going on

Did you change the cut off settings on both vescs?

8 x 2 cells per layer, but no telling how many layers.. might as well be 8s30p

I did not know i had to change it on both vesc bc one vesc is like a master so i thought it will apply to both of them. besides, when i changed settings first time to 24 and 22.4 i also did it only once and both motors were turning strong and i was not able to stop any of them by hand. now i can stop one of them. how do i change it on both vesc anyway?

Everything has to be changed on both vescs. You can plug the usb cable to the slave vesc or connect via master to ID 1 (usually the master is 0). Just to get sure, you did motor detection and settings on both vescs before use?

yes, i did motor detection and everything before use. i did it a while ago but it was done. ok, cool, so i will see what happens if i change settings on both vesc. thanks again!!!

You are welcome :grin:
As long as you have the same settings on both vescs everything should run flawlessly
