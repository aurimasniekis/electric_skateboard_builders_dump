I love McMaster-Carr but the site is overwhelming at times because they have so much.  What are some of your favorite McMaster-Carr parts you like to buy?

@stimm At work we have a physical catalog from them, and it's about two or three good-size phonebooks thick, I'd guess ~3800 pages.

If they don't have it, you don't need it. 

It's easier to start with an idea of what you want and then go looking for it on there, rather than browsing forever and constantly asking yourself if you want this or that thing.

They don't have electric skateboards, and I can't live without those.  Though, admitted, they probably have everything to make one.

They may not have the motor or battery, but they do have just about every other mechanical piece.

It's a fun rabbit hole to go down every now and then, trying to fix d the most obscure thing they have to offer.
