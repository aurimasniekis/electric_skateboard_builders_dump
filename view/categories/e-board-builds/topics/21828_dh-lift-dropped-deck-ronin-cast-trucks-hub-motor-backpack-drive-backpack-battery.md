Hi guys,

As a DownHill rider, I am looking for a solution to bring me back to the top of the hill once I have ended my DH run.
The DH tracks here in the alps are 5 to 15 km long depending on the hills with an average steepness of 8% +/- 4%, and a typical session is 4 to 6 runs for a rider with a "basic" pair of legs like me :wink:.
My DH dropped board, including trucks and wheels, is specific for DH and weights 5.2 kg which is already too heavy
as one needs manoeuvrability for precise sliding, drifting and foot braking at high speed (60 km/h +/-).
I have discussed by email with people from Eon : http://www.unlimited.engineering/
They make a pluggable drive where you don't need to change neither the deck nor the truck, just replace the pair of wheels of the rear truck, yet their drive does not fit below a dropped board and would anyway add at least 1.5 kg to the board.
So they suggested me to look for solution on the web where the battery is in a backpack, connected (by wire) to one (or two) hub motor wheel, that I just have to replace by the DH wheels to ride down the hill and do the reverse to come back. A kind of "lift for DH rider"...with a top speed of at least 20 km/h...
I don't know if I've come to the good place for such a topic and appologize if not.
Below are the pics of my board :

No matter what you do, torque is going to be the big issue.  An 8 to 12 deg slope for 15km is enough to tax any setup.  If tt were me, I'd do something like this to make easy cheap and be done with it...

Thanks for your answer.
But carrying a drill during a DH run is not actually possible, even in the backpack for safety reasons (even with a back protector).
Here is an introduction to this sport by a famous rider :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJpgQztjQ
Regarding safety, the battery has to be less stronger than my back (+ the back protector), sothat in case of crash on the back, the battery will break and not my back (only one crash on the back after 12 years of DH but still one !).
Concerning the 15 km range, I though that replacable batteries could be an option (let's say maximum 3 kg in the backpack).
And finaly, if a setup enables 20 km uphill at 20 km/h, which means 4 runs of 5 km), it's already an ultimate tool for such a sport as it enables a daily training basis.

Nice! what's the space (height) of the deck in the middle?
Until now I made 3 battery packs (6S2P) which are only 10mm thick, maybe there will be no problem to get it under your deck :slight_smile:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/3/53d4f34a7817a1f974c109b5a70fbc4c35a048f9.jpg" width="375" height="500"> 
What voltage would you like to use? 6S, 8S, 10S, 12S? if you gear the speed for about 30kmh max there will be enough torque to get on these hills but it depends on the motor-esc-battery setup you're planning.
Do you have some plans if you wanna use esc or vesc? I guess an esc is better for this

The space in the middle is 640 mm (I suppose you talk about the space where you can put your feet: so the total height of the deck minus the dropped head and tail).

Here is a basic scheme with all the dimensions : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/c/4c9ada50d80aef4bd8d89bb23b7613509d2abc07.png" width="690" height="487">

But adding weight to the board is a problem as my board is already too heavy for DH (5.2 kg). That is why I'm looking for a backpack solution, unless one put the battery (and motor) inside the board as on your photo.
But this depends on the battery weight : can you tell me the weight of your battery packs ?
For the motor it seems that vesc is best but more complexe to setup...
I have no experience here so I would say that the most reliable over time at this speed (30 km/h) is the best...

@jmasta : good idea ! some people have tried it, but it's not reliable enough :wink:
@Surfer : according to my personal dh experience and ride instinct, these "superpower boards" I see on the web are still a little bit too heavy today to develop the same skill level (and fun) as in dh : to have a good "gliding feeling" in a pendulum slide or corner drift together with precision on a narrow road, a setup of maximum 5 kg below your feet and a minimum top speed of 45 km/h is a good starting point for me. But as e-boards evolve quickly today thanks you guys, "dh" and "e" riders will probably develop and share common skills in the near future.
...my snowboard also weights +/- 5 kg, and maybe surfers that need manoeuvrability are also in this weight range...

My pack has 12cells (6S2P) so the same as a 12S pack, the weight is 1,5kg and the dimensions are 500mm x 140mm x 12mm.

12S pack
[/quote]

Great ! it should fit below my board (Landyachtz Evo 2005 version).
So the solution I see now, yet actually not sure it's possible is :
  - to go up hill : "plug your battery below my board" and "connect it to a vesc motor controller" connected to a single/dual hub motor wheel (like in eon kit).
  - to go down hill : unplug and put your battery and the hub wheel(s) in my backpack and go down hill with the dh wheel.

I've read that esc is not reliable to carry my weight (180 lbs) uphill and that for such a weight I also need a battery around 300wh capacity. Is it ok ?
I have also looked at this hub motor wheel : 
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torque-single-hub-motor/
But they say "Recommend Rider Weight Uphill â€“ 180lbs".

Good idea! That should be awesome if you can make the parts so you can take them of.
A 12S 5Ah Lipo pack has 222Wh.
The only thing is if you have 12S with that single 75Kv 83mm hubmotor, the max speed will be like 45km/h!
It should be better if you could find lower Kv hubmotors (around 50Kv) to give you more torque and lower topspeed.
If you go for a dual motor setup it should be fine with the 75Kv but lower should be better because you're only going uphill with your esk8.
Btw Miami hubmotors seems to be more powerful and better for your application, 3000W each instead of 1800W like the torqueboard.

@bartroosen12 : Thanks for this 3000W hubs (I suppose you still suggest a dual motor with your battery as it is 76kv motors). I see also that they have a VESC :
https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/vesc
And it is pre-configured for this motor (good point !), but it is sold out...
@jebe : yes, I have discussed with them by email and it would be my choice for commuting as I have a 15 km straight and flat bicycle path from my job. I'm sure this e-Evo could get me their on time, but for DH it's clearly too heavy for me. But it's just for me...

There's a problem in the market of hub motors: they get very, very hot. Especially in the situation you need them, going uphill. I think carvons are the only ones that van get you the power needed. I mean, everything about this has big  problems: a battery that can fit under your board won't give you much power/range, but that may work. A normal vesc will probably fry in a couple of months, if not before. You need a very high quality one, like vesc x or ollin's with direct fets and heatsink, or wait for the vesc 6.

Thank's for this feedback, I may buy this vesc x if it is available : 
http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-x-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/
But I fear I will have to configure it myself...
Concerning the power/range, as I said before, if speed can be only 20 km/h for a range of only 5 km, it's already not so bad... ok not a "premium DH lift" but still a kind of dh lift...I'll purchase more batteries...
I mean it is anyway much more reliable than going back up the hill by feet, or hitchiking, or by car with your GF when she's ok, or with your dh buddies when they are available...
Tracks are most of the time 8%, never more than 12%, and at least I can walk on the parts above 8% if they are too much for the motor...

Configuring the vesc is the easiest part, you just set parameters on the app, ask for some experts on the forum, they will gladly help you :) 
Constant 8% on hubs is gonna heat up a lot, we usually don't go uphill constantly. If I was you, I would buy some carvon motors, get a custom lipo slim pack and double vesc x. It's gonna cost some money, but it should get the job done

But actually why would you go for vesc (with about 60A max) and not for a higher amp esc like a 12S 120A: diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-12s-120a-car-esc-opto-hv/
2 x ESC for 250â‚¬
I'm sure these can handle much more than vesc and the thing is vesc is very good for cruising and has better brakes and... so better in places like the city.
You only need to go uphill and need a lot of power.
Why not going for a belt drive? and just remove the belt if you go down the hill?
But yeah carvon has a really nice new design of hubmotors :slight_smile:

@bartroosen12 : After a survey from your link of these ESC I understand that I have to build  the solution from kits like these : 
  - diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/63mm-5300w-dual-motor-electrical-skateboard-kit/
  - diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-dual-motor-mechanical-kit/

It seems dedicated to "big hill climbing" so great !
Yet, I have to ask the guys of this site if I can mount such a kit on my dh ronin cast trucks.
Then, to go down hill with my dh wheels, I suppose I have to remove at least :  
    - the e-Wheel(s)
    - the belt ,
    - the pulleys,
Last, I don't know the weight of such kit and put it on the rear truck is just hell for dh, why not put it on the front truck !
Ok I discuss al that with these guys and tell you...

Thanks !

@LaCha : I would say because : 
  - I'm just the opposite of an expert as the guys from Mellow are,
  - you cannot use the mellow drive with your own dh trucks,
  - riding up hill during 5 km at 8% may not be a reliable program of the mellow drive.

Of course it's also possible to put it on the front truck if it's better for you.
The kits are looking awesome and so damn powerful :smile:
Believe me with 2 of those motor's you won't have any problems with climbing hills.
- The 12S 120A ESC is just perfect
- The motors are 190Kv, hobbyking has 149kV (SK3) which would be better for torque and lower topspeed (around 40km/h with 149kv motor)
- I should use the 36T wheelpulley they sell and the 13T motor pulley to get the lowest speed (40km/h)
- Motormount should be nice if they fit on your trucks.
- All 83mm Flywheels/ clones will fit on the wheelpulley so also perfect (I recently bought them if you need a link or you can buy them on the diyesk8 site)

And yep no mellow drive that will be a disaster I guess.

Hi, If I should suggest you a setup with parts I should use these parts:

- SK3 149Kv 2250W (https://hobbyking.com/nl_nl/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-149kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=nl_nl)
- 12S 120A ESC (diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-12s-120a-car-esc-opto-hv/)
- Custom 12S 5Ah 20C battery pack (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-1s-20c-lipoly-single-cell.html)
- Wheel pulley 40T (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/europe-15mm-steel-motor-pulley-40t-abec-flywheel-mbs-all-terrain-pulley/21733)
- Motor pulley 15T (http://www.benl.ebay.be/itm/322328974649?_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649&var=511233084902&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)

This will give you a max speed of 35km/h by 4500W max power.

If you find a suitable motor mount you can choose the belts and stuff, I know @whitepony has a motor mount for Ronin trucks on his awesome build.
But there's one major problem, I don't think you got enough space to put 2 of these motors on one truck. maybe with smaller belts...
Or you can just buy a kit from DIY and just unscrew the trucks every time you go uphill :smiley:

No, the solution is basically :
  - climbing uphill (5 km / 8%) with a motor drive mounted on my Ronin cast trucks (at minimum 20 km/h ), 
  - then remove the battery and e-wheels and put them in my backpack,
  - then ride downhill with my dh wheels (DTC Ray SETAE 72 mm) and the motor disconnected (in other words : just pure  gravity based acceleration/braking and no motor based accelaration/braking),
  - no trucks or any objects harder than my back + back protector in the backpack for safety reason in case of dh crash on the back.

Custom 12S 5Ah 20C battery pack
[/quote]

I read this dimensions/weight for this battery pack : 
Cell Weight: 114g
Cell Size: 128 x 42 x 10mm

According to their weight, if we put only 5 cells below the deck it increases the board of 500g and it's a good compromise to avoid the backpack...
Do you have an expectation of the "very min and max range" that can be done at 20 km/h and 8% with 5 cells ? maybe the only answer is "let's try !" :wink:

Wait you wanne make a 5S battery pack instead of a 12S pack? Because if you do that the max power will decrease sooo much like max 2000W instead of 4500W.
If you wanna go for less cells under your deck 6S is a lot used. it will have not as much power as a 12S pack because it's half the voltage but the weight will be less that's true.
But them you can chose other ESC which are a lot cheaper and the max topspeed will be lower which is better.
I will make a list if you want ;;

oh no forget it ! as a newbie I misconfused the packs and cells sorry...
But yes comparing the two version 6S and 12S is interesting.
Basically, if less powerful (6S) means less speed, less range but also less heat so more chance that nothing burns, I'd prefer...
By the way, I've asked to the DIY for their mechanical mounts vs my Ronin trucks but no answer yet...

If I'm not wrong the smaller battery will produce more heat. The motors will pull more current due to the lower voltage. I don't think anyone has any mounts for ronins yet. There are some guys who have modified their ronins to fit a mount though.

Yeah a 6S battery will no problem to use.
Because right now the build is getting a bit too extreme.
A dual motor setup on 6S batterie will stil give you like max 4000W and with a max speed of 30kmh that will really be no problem ;)
You could use these:
- 6S 150A car ESC https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tm-x-car-beast-series-esc-1-8-scale-150a.html
- NTM 270Kv motor https://hobbyking.com/en_us/ntm-prop-drive-50-60-270kv-2400w-1.html
- 40T wheelpulley and 15T motorpulley
speed will be around max 30kmh so perfect.
2 of these motors will be possible with a 15mm wide belt.

You need a pusher that can attach to the back of the board. Probably around the truck. Maybe a quick release to attach it. No changing wheels / trucks. The batt/esc is in the pusher. 1 motor geared for torque. Might be a bit heavy in the backpack, but the battery could be protected.  I dunno ðŸ˜ž  -  just thinking.

my advice would be to use your downhill board for down hill and get a separate electric board for flat ground.

there is no way you can have the best of both worlds. there is always a compromise.

Why not trying to mix : 
  - the pusher ideas of @SageTX and @LaCha with the [SK8-Booster](http://sk8boosterelectricskateboard.blogspot.fr/) dedicated e-wheel/truck concept, but with the e-wheel that could be put down to the ground to climb up the hill, and moved up, may be through the deck (in the middle) to go dh,
  - with a pluggable/unpluggable battery packs.
  - and that respect in a way the advice of @lowGuido : don't try to integrate the dh and "e" setups !

OMG, the phone will ring and I will wake up soon :wink:

To avoid carry the battery pack in a backpack to save weight in the board while dh and preserve safety and damage in case of crash, one can purchase for several lower range packs (5 km each) store them down the hill, and leave them up the hill. After 4/5 dh runs : take your car, go up the hill and bring back the packs down the hill, and redo 4/5 runs...
Ok : one need a car, but dh people are used to use their car up and down all the time...they just will do it less with such a dh lift which is good for the planet,and much more cool as being (only) 5 big guys in a small car in leather suits with protections and your big board is not always so fun, especially for the owner of the car (or his/her parents) ;)
I fear I still haven't wake up ;)

@LaCha : the KickStick could have been a solution, but the project seems not live anymore. Some times ago, I also looked for [this one](http://www.epaddle.net), but no commercial version yet.

It looks like something you can make though! Probably less to worry about compared to an eskate.

Get a drone that will follow and video your downhill runs and also carry your batteries to the bottom of the hill. Then strap the batteries to your board and the drone to your back for the ride back up to conserve it's battery, rinse and repeat. Sure, you might need a ridiculously large and expensive drone that could accomplish this, and sure it might be seen by some as a potential flying bomb, but that's the price of progress, I guess.

i would either make an eboard that is quick enough to be proper fast up AND downhill (that would require a really strong setup though), or Id have a small electric board in my backpack to have an undiluted downhill experience. if its just a lift for you, it could be a tiny single motor board with short gearing for 20kph max and an enduring liion battery (best energy / weight). a board like that weights about 5-6kg with 350ish Wh and small wheels!

my and other builders small jet spud might be the one: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carbon-jet-spud-freebord-bindings-single-vesc-10s3p-lg-hg2/5805

Thank's for your feedback and your "reference" built !
Yet, having a board in my backpack is not possible for safety reason.

After reading again on esc vs vesc and discussing with Dexter from http:// about their upcoming hub motor version,
the target of 5 km at 8% for my 180 lbs seems ok for him.
I will still have to machine a little bit my Ronin cast trucks sothat these hub wheels fit...I'm looking at that for now and will post the part list he suggests in cas you've got any feedbacks.

Thank's for this link, it's a quiet good alternative (the "pusher" one as @SageTX suggested [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dh-lift-dropped-deck-ronin-cast-trucks-hub-motor-backpack-drive-backpack-battery/21828/35?u=frameto) ).
I've looked at [this review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwY28Ut-89w) of this device and the truck drive seems quiet heavy when the guy takes it in his hand (1:40).
I've looked also at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt_stbpsVdY) of the people making this device and they are dh riders, yet they never use it as a "dh lift" for their dh session, which is exactly what I want to do...
So I fear climbing hill is not really in the target program of this device (too heavy to dh with it at the rear, too risky to have it in your backpack...).
But for a lighter "third power truck" solution, one could try to replace this "not light enough" adaptative truck by a composition of lighter [gbomb drop bracket](http://www.shop.gbomblongboards.com/GBomb-10mm-SD-R-Standard-Drop-Bracket-0008.htm) and [torsion tail](http://www.shop.gbomblongboards.com/Torsion-Tail-TT-A-TT-A.htm).
One still need to tighten the drop bracket to the rear of the deck (at the top), but it should not be a big party.
And to go dh, removing the power wheels should be the only action to do : leaving the bracket asis without the wheels should not cause any problem during the dh run as they are light enough and won't touch the ground.
