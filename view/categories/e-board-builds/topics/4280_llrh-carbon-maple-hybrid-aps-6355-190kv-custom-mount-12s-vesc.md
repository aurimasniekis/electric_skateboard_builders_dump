Greetings from Finland! I have taken only couple first steps with my built but wanted to share these with you! The LLRH comes from Light Long Range Hybrid which state my goals. It's my first built so let's hope that I will meet these goals. 

Parts for my board are:
Ram Lokz complete
74mm OJ wheels
APS 6355 190kv sensored motor
Custom mount
9mm XL belt + wheels
2x Multistar 6s 8000mAh
Wireless WiiMote

I have everything else but VESC. It will hopefully arrive next week.

I started with the mount. It's milled 10mm aluminium welded to truck. Btw it was my first aluminium TIG weld!

And drivetrain installed.

It's some old manual machine at work, haven't even bothered to check brand. Pulley is bolted thru the wheel and has 3d printed spacers to align with the wheel.

I'd say the deck by itself is fine but if you are going to mill then you need extra layers

Been following for while and felt so bad when I saw that pic. Sorry dude. Indeed some extra bottom carbon layers or just some strips on the sides could do the trick.

Gonna glue it or start over? If you can peel off the carbon, it might still be gluable.

owh, just saw your broken deck :disappointed_relieved:

I did something similar a while ago with my topspeed, which was a 9ply thick board that just allows a little more routing I think:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f18d491389d8acda8df9d4f8332d80d477acf85d.jpg" width="690" height="237">

I gave it a flex test back then and it held up, but I didnt have a good feeling about it to be honest :stuck_out_tongue: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Usq1IDlvpk


you probably routed wire channels on the wefunk to connect the 2 boxes? think thats much less critical, because the top of the board is compressed while the roadside is extended. be careful not to screw everything up with resin when you fill these channels. I did that somewhat on my topspeed and after that experience I was extra careful with my vanguard and used some hot glue to "resin-proof" the cable exits before I filled the wire channels + wires with epoxy and 2 gfk layers to cover the "wounds" on the board.

looking forward to your progress :slight_smile:

I just looked at your first deck again and this time i noticed the design which i thought could be a ram deck, and... it is.

My flatmate odered a ram deck two weeks ago.
It snapped the moment i started to push a little harder. So don't get discouraged by your first snapping board.
Just don't trust ram it seems to be cheap bulllshit.

Yeah that routing is for power cables. I'm not sure if I will even apply any resin there. Cables are quite press fit to the channel and grip tape will hold them there.

Wow! I have now ridden my test setup about 30 - 35 km's and it's fun! Can't wait to wire up the 12s config!

Sorry that it's been such a long time since my last update. Been waiting for the EMF hubs. Since they havent progressed anywhere I decided to change to Hummie Hubz. Got the Hummies and here's where I'm now.

Just when I was going for first test!  I did test it back home that both VESCs do have the same settings and everything is fine. It was running fine with 6s and no load. I did also test briefly with 12s that it runs. But now that I went outside switched power on and just looked it I heard PUFF and it was gone.

Don't know, Everything looks OK besides that current sensing resistor. Only things that comes to my mind are that it had bad soldering or there was something mysterious hapening in the software. And now that I was too eager to test my board I went to test with only one motor and burned that motors coils and the other vescs DRV chip...

Check if the hall pins that the red wire is resting on is poking through the insulation. If it is then it got shorted out and burnt.

The hall pins are on the top left of the picture, so check there. Just fyi you may not see the hole if there is one, try bending the wire back to check for holes.

Thanks! There is definetly some marks on the cable but seems like they aren't thru the insulation. The processor is working and DRV doesn't give any errors so I hope that it's only the resistor that is broken.

If you do revive it make sure you sand down those pins it insulate with hot glue or something similar, they can and will short the VESC.

Hi guys!

I started to revive my board and got some Maytech hub motors. Since the truck of Maytech motors is narrower than what came with hummie hubs I had to make the tail narrower.
![37|281x500](upload://1AJZEjvYl4OSMzqitPqcjjdusQt.jpeg) 

Also I made a heatsink for vescs.
![photo5906798098066288759|281x500](upload://iCM8BK614kELcFgctr8TIc7D9zT.jpeg) 

And painted it black.
![photo5915643935399719144|690x388](upload://iOxNDs8DcMNghTFbBvoGXfBUPrG.jpeg) 

And fitted it to my electronics case.
