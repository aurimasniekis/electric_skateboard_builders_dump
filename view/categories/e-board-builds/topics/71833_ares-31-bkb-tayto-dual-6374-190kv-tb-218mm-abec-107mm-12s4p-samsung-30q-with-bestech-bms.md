Hi guys, this is my first post so I hope I'm doing it right. Anyways, I've been planning on my first build for quite some time now but just decided to finally go for it.

I plan to use this board as a daily commuter to my university and around town. After using the WowGo2s for about 6 months, I've decided that I need a smaller deck so that it's easier to carry around campus. The area I live in has a bunch of hills, so torque is pretty important too. 

* Deck: [31'' BKB Tayto](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/decks/products/bkb-tayto-31-deck)
* Trucks: [TB 218mm](products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks?variant=712802992151)
* Wheels: ABEC 107mm Superfly
* Bearings: [Zealous](https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/zealous-bearings)
* Bushings :[Orangatang Nipples Purple](https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/orangatang-nipples)
* Risers: 1/2'' (also got a 1/4'', will have to see which works better)
* Motors: [Dual TB 6374 190KV](products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv?variant=712609955863)
* Motor Mount: [DickyHo's Caliber mounts with idler bearings](https://www.ebay.com/itm/CNC-motor-mount-for-50-63-motors-for-DIY-eskate-electric-skateboard/302775190943?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=601716797808&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649)
* Wheel pulley: [DickyHo's 40T wheel pulley](https://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-eletric-skateboard-5M-36T-40T-pulley-kit-for-for-ABEC-flywheels/302678192585?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=601570381919&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649)
* Motor Pulley: [DickyHo's 15T motor pulley](https://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-eletric-skateboard-5M-36T-40T-pulley-kit-for-for-ABEC-flywheels/302678192585?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=601570381919&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649)
* Belts: [DickyHo's 305 11mm](https://www.ebay.com/itm/5M-290-295-300-305-310-11mm-wide-or-15mm-width-trim-drive-belts/302885208449?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=601795012604&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649) (also got 15mm to try out without the idlers)
* VESC: [Dual Flipsky 6.6](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc6-6-based-upon-vesc6-with-aluminum-heatsink)
* Battery: [12s4p Samsung 30Q](https://ru.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html) (Might go with 10s if the board is too heavy)
* BMS: [Bestech D140 Charge-only](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/batteries/products/bestech-d140-charge-only-bms?variant=12511076909150)
* Enclosure: [Eboosted Spud/Tayto DS](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/decks/products/enclosure-for-jet-spud-29)
* Remote: Would like to DIY a Firefly remote, but might get the trigger remote in the meantime

So that's what I've planned for now, what do you guys think ? Am I missing anything ? I'm also a bit torn between the FOCBOX unity and the Flipsky dual 6.6; The unity is a very new product so of course there is the risk in that but it is cheaper than the Flipsky, considering the additional items I will need to get if I went with Flipsky: antispark and bluetooth module. 

Cheers!

-Contact @Alphamail for riptide bushings opinion 
-wait for better metal and new design from @dickyho. Also Alan's Enclosure needs short mounts, tb mounts. If you get longer mounts, you'll need to reverse mount them
-how about maytech motors?

Unfortunately I've already ordered the mounts haha, will give it a shot first, fingers crossed! I ordered the shorter version of dickyho's mounts, shouldn't that fit ? 
Hmm I would get maytech, but I am trying to cut a bit of cost wherever I can :sweat_smile:

You can run 15mm belts with idler bearings if you get a longer bolt and put a normal bearing in between the 2 flanged ones. That's what I did for my board. I also used 15T/40T pulleys but with a 300mm belt so the motor was all the way forward on the mount. 305mm will probably work too but be looser/motor will be farther back.

Hey @prev

If you havnt bought the wheels, motors and motor mounts I would be happy to sell mine to ya :) They arent 6374s(theyre 6354s from flipsky)

But otherwise Ive got the 107mm evolve abecs as well as macmm88s janux mounts ^^

I was taking my board apart and misplaced the other crossbar.... I know its in my dorm somewhere :)

edit: pics and pricing, I had it mixed up :)

pictures 4 and 5 are the most damaged parts of the mount, and im positive that even 5 minutes of sloppy work(sandpaper etc) would look much better :sweat_smile:

That board will be heavy with dual 6374s and a 12s.  I guarantee that.

It is funny to see so many people getting their Tayto builds ready.  I mean I am one of them at the moment, just waiting on the deck.  Should be some fun projects to see come from this deck.

I like the way you think!  

I am now reconsidering my build on the Tayto.  With all these new DD setups coming to the market has me second guessing this build.  Since I really wanted this build to be a commuter build, and be more minimalistic, the DD setup might be the way to go.  Anyway with the deck taking a minute to get to Jlabs it really isn't that much of an issue to wait on this build.  Winter is right around the corner and getting another deck to put my hardware on for my 6355 dual setup might be a better plan for me.

The nut on the truck holding the wheels looks a bit weird to me, its right at the edge of the axle and can't be tighten anymore. The wheels are nicely in place, but I am not too sure. Is this wrong ? If so, then I might need to change how my motors are currently placed:

![IMG_20181118_001013|375x500](upload://1HEu8KZjxm6kYZOiTpdjkTmN1CR.jpeg) 

I would prefer if they could look like that but those motors are really huge (my fault, should have anticipated that lol). I needed to, then I will have to go diagonal :confused:

My wheels on the front trucks have way too much space to work with, and I need them to be all the way at the end of the axles like the wheels at the back. Sorry if this is a super noob question (electric aside, this is my first longboard build as well hahha), but since earlier you mentioned about adding bearings, so should I add bearings onto the axle, and then the wheels ? :smile:

You would only add bearings into the pulley. To push the front wheel outward, use a combination of spacers and speed rings

Are your wheels limited by the motors touching? Because your motor mounts are backwards. The flat side should be towards the pulleys and stepped side has the motor. This way the motor sits “inside” the mounts. 

Here’s a picture of my dickyho mounts for reference. ![IMG_0952|666x500](upload://6tjXwRAt0JOqbFkmZIHyhpCPRil.jpeg)

Duddeee thanks a bunch man! You are right, I can't believe I overlooked that lmaoo. Seriously, I was so bumped thinking it was the motors hahahha. After flipping the motor mounts around, the wheels/pulley are able to pass through the threads.

Basically the drivetrain is almost done, I think.  
I still need to file the left side of the hanger a bit more, since there is still a bit too much resistance on the left wheel/pulley. Also need to add some loctite to the screws, and align everything a little bit. :laughing:

Edit: Only after posting this update, I realized I've been reverse-mounting my motors lol, so yea I just rotated the mounts to the front :sweat_smile:

Yes there are some updates! 

1) I've worked a bit on my drivetrain. Dickyho sent me some replacements clamps for my mounts because I accidentally broke one of them while trying to get it to fit the TB218mm trucks with a plyer lol. The replacement works but one of them ended up being slightly smaller (could be the due to shipping) than the other so I had to extend that a little with a plyer (I was more careful this time haha).  Then, I spray painted the hangers and baseplate to give it some "personality"

![IMG_20181221_150042|374x500](upload://fVK7QuRSLgIPnxMHifhBfKIlGIZ.jpeg) 

2. Dem batteries arrived!!! (customs tho $$$$ 💸)

![IMG_20181222_003615|666x500](upload://mBvHzyAeDujR7O3NjxALqOZjBe.jpeg) 

3. My BKB order (which has the tayto, bms and other stuff) was shipped before Christmas but it only arrived in KL yesterday morning; it was probably delayed due to the holidays, but anyways should expect it by end of this week!! 🎉

Has there been any further "real world" testing of the malleability of Dickyho's mount?  There was some issues with one of his recent batches and haven't heard if that has been resolved.  I'm concerned that the weight and torque of your TB 6380 motors are going to destroy those motor mounts.'

Have you built a battery before?  I'm considering making that journey myself soon but am a bit intimidated... :slight_smile:

I am comcerned about the amount of space you have between the motors.

I had a rig that was close like that and the motors would kiss eachother often and would make the most annoying fucking noise.  

Maybe you won't run into this, but I did and hated it.

Those black hubs on the 107s look so dope.  I like it much better than the orange

Yeah I've heard about those and am a bit worried as well, unfortunately I've yet to test mine out yet so only time can tell! I'm hoping it will be fine of course 😂

No, I have not build a battery before though I do plan on doing that in the future; but at the moment I couldn't really justify getting a spot welder, and this being my first DIY board, I didn't want to risk it all with the batteries hahah 🔥There is also the N.E.S.E modules (and I think I saw someone on here creating an alternative) which seems a lot less intimidating than using a spot welder

Looks as tho the motor gear needs to move much closer to the motor mount

Never used a idla pulley don’t see the advantage.

Run the wheel repeatedly one way see it the belt walks acros the wheel or motor a gear to one side and/or rubs then do it in reverse. See if dose it again. If it doesn’t stay in the middle it will cause extra wear.

I had a similar problem when using wide belts. I ended up buying longer bolts and another set of skate bearings (same size as original) and putting another bearing in there to make it 3 wide. Others have used non-flanged bearings. The bearings are the same size as skate bearings so you might have some extras lying around to try out.

@Sender ya man, was super bumped but anyways I just paid dem taxes 💸 and got my deck/enclosure so it's all good now! 
@Darkie02 @Jellybean After looking at the diagrams for dickyho's mounts on his product page again, I realised I have been mounting the motors wrongly all these while hhahahaha. I was mounting it in the angle designated for 50xx motors, and the screws were preventing my motor pulley from going all the way in 😂

Here is a test fit of everything together

All that's left is to get my battery pack built, and connecting everything together. Hoping to get all that done in the next couple of weeks!

hi im planning on doing a similar spec build and i was wondering what the total weight of the board would end up being?

The belt and pully doesn’t look right.

I’d move the motor gear closer to the motor and/or space the pully out so the belt sits in between the bearings flanges depending on what you can make work.

Are thay 9mm belts? thats a lot of tork from big motors it might be ok but watch for belt skipping it might be ok.

@ausm I'm not too sure about the exact weight but for now, it's almost as heavy as my wowgo which is like 17lbs, but this is without the batteries haha

@Darkie02 oops I took that pic before making the fix. Anyways I also added some speed washers to the wheel bearings to make it a bit more aligned and this is what I got:

Is this okay ? And I'm using 15mm belts

```
15mm belts you will need another bearing between the 2 flange bearings. The belt should runs between the 2 flanges of the bearings not the flange running on top of the belt.

It will work you just were out the belts quicker as there destorting were the flange is pushing on the belt unevenly.

Stolen from google See how these put a even pressure acros all of the belt. If the bearing has a flange it’s best to have the flange on the side of the belt

So the batteries are all done so it was time to put everything together. But I ran into some weird issue, every few times when I push full throttle, the motors behave very weirdly; here's a video:

That all silver drive train looks gorgeous, well done

Looking forward to see if that the power is manageable on that short board

Edit: strange issue with the motors, are you running sensored and did the detection? Or did you change the order of the phase wires after doing the sensor detection?

Thanks dude! And yeah it had to do with my stupid ass not plugging the sensor cable into the vesc xD I am not sure if this one is an issue, but when I try to push the throttle down just a very tiny bit, it seems only one motor starts to spin while the other does not; but as soon as I push the throttle down a bit more, both spins normally :/

That's perfectly normal

The dual VESC talks to each other via CAN right? if so even at full throttle one of yours motors will slow down, it's a bug in the software, but only happens when testing with wheels in the air
