Hi all 

Long time lurker here, 40+ yr old ex skateboarder, DIY everything and rooted knees led me to Esk8!

I'm a complete novice so I have written this for people just starting out that will come across these things like I did, building from OZ with little or no experience. I have actually built this already and tested it over the last few months. What a blast the thing is to ride! First ever ESk8 and build for me. Was challenging getting parts together from Oz and will talk about that later. This is my version of the Skatemetric Foosted Copy you can find [here](http://skatemetric.com/index.php/2018/07/03/ultimate-accessible-foosted-build-tutorial/). Its a good starting point. Skatemetrics Tutorial is awesome but a little hard to follow if your like me and learn visually.
 

Went to my local skateshop here in Melb (In Richmond) called TwelveBoardstore [https://twelveboardstore.com.au/](https://twelveboardstore.com.au/). They are actually the Australian Rep for Boosted Boards (funnily enough) and do lots of downhill stuff as well. Great shop. Boards and gear here in Oz are eye wateringly expensive$$$$$.

I originally wanted a deck with a tail as a have a skateboarding background 👍 

That quickly went out the door when I walked in the shop and saw this gleaming Powell Kevin Reimer Downhill Deck and instantly fell in love. Got some funny looks from the Boosted Rep when I explained that I was building a better esk8 than the Boosted with it😂. Walked out with Abec 11's in 83mm and Caliber two trucks and bearings about 600 bucks poorer.

Now after much research I began ordering parts for my build from Torqueboards (Diyelectricskateboards), MBoards and Flipsky.

**Torqueboards**
2 x 4.12 VESC's
2 x Abec Pulley Kits (not kegel like skatemetics copy)
2 x 6355 190kv motors
1 x Nano Remote
1 x 2.4ghz receiver
Canbus cable
Servo wires (didn't need these)
XT90 parallel connectors.

**Mboards**
ESC Enclosure (absolutely useless and thrown in bin)
Battery enclosure 
10s5p Battery (this is huge!)
Premium Clamp Mounts (good but an effort to keep tight)
36 tooth Pulley Kit (never arrived and ended up ordering second set from TB)

**Flipsky**
Anti Spark Switch 280amp Pro
Bullet connectors 

So after many weeks of waiting I finally got some parts to place on the board and mock up something resembling an ESk8. 

For those Aussies reading this, **_be VERY careful who you order from_** and read these forums closely for other users experience. 
_Flipsky_ is actually the fastest postage wise to Oz (Singapore I believe) 
_DIYelectric skateboards_ (Torqueboards) was 3-4 weeks to my door. I like how you can see if they have stock on the site and I recommend using the chat to ask if they have stock before ordering, very helpful.  
_MBoards_ I won't talk about too much, except to say the postage and communication I received was horrendous. I actually gave up on the pulley kit and ordered from Torque Boards which still arrived BEFORE Mboards.  Long discussions about MBoards here [https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/is-mboards-legit/47112/71](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/is-mboards-legit/47112/71)

![IMG_7807|666x500](upload://j5rl7r7vhNqDd1aIpUlawhR9e3j.jpeg) 

Bad photo but you get the general idea. For people just starting out with a DIY project here are the things I quickly learnt the hard way

**enclosures**
Measure carefully your Esc and preferred enclosure before buying. The MBoards one I got was useless and would hardly fit one esc. I went to my local JAYCAR store and found these circuit boxes that come in a million sizes ( yes that ugly grey thing in the photo) $20 and so far bullet proof.

![IMG_8312|500x500](upload://cFEK6JcEiNa7zM9OLgJT859cja0.jpeg) 

**Wiring**
Note that everything you buy from the states is measured using their backwards AWG (American Wire Gauge). Everything here is in KV or mm. I just got some 0.6KV stuff in a similar size and seems to be holding up just fine. Get extra wire from the states when you order your gear if you want to keep everything the same.

**Connectors**
Order more than you need, you will wreck some especially if you haven't soldered before. Get double.

**Soldering**
Learn to do it, but buy a decent iron, my first one melted before my eyes! You will be definitely shortening wires and soldering connectors. YouTube is full of good videos👍 I had to shorten all my VESC outgoing wires to my motors considerably. Plug and play is BS. i actually melted down some connectors and reused them a number of times.

**AntiSpark Switches**
The one I got from Flipsky which has a sensor wire that you have to solder into one of the phases on your VESC. This is so you can turn the system on without the button by just spinning the wheels a bit. Thought this was a massive wank to start with but now I realise just placing the board down and taking one push is so much easier. The blue wire is the one you need to solder into the system. 

I threw away the switch that came built into the MBoards enclosure and installed the Flipsky button into the same spot. Sexy. For some reason they have a switch on everything they send you, useless.

**Supplies locally**
Don't get Velcro, adhesive foam etc from overseas if your in Oz go to **Bunnings** they have a plentiful supply of this stuff. **JAYCAR** has limited supplies of bullet connectors and BEWARE they are in Millimetres and won't fit the ones you bought overseas. I got extra wire from there and heatshrink kits. Good and cheap.

**Thread Locker**
I clearly did not understand the vibration that goes through these things. I used locktight Blue threadlocker on everything. First ride around the block one motor dragged on the ground! When you think you have it tight enough, tighten some more. The bolts for motor mounts and truck mounts are hardened, and you will bend the Allen key before you bend the bolt. After three or four 12km + rides I almost have it right. **Expect** everything to come loose the first few rides. You need to make sure you tighten the main bolt on the truck, THEN the for Allen Screws holding the motor in place in that order. I think this gives the one bolt secondary support.

![PNG|349x500](upload://pc2XphPtLYcsxMRlov8Y2FXgqPK.jpeg) 

This is how's my wiring ended up. It looks terrible in real life, but phase two should clean it up a little. I need to add in easier ways to dismantle, and attach the battery to the board with velcro instead of to the enclosure. Fitting in XT90 parallel connectors is an absolute head f$ck. Mine is ugly but works. I used XT60 connectors at the battery and antispark end.

![image001|690x337](upload://87kE9YccKM7Y0VX3T4gzEStt2CT.png) 

I got a battery capacity gauge from EBay which seems to be working just dandy. Make sure you wire into correct side of your switch or it will be on permanently. I hot glued mine into the side of my MBoards enclosure.

![PNG|504x499](upload://6AYqYl9n4D5Rrx5qwqw6e1EiRhx.jpeg) 

this is how the board looks now, note my motor with a little less paint than it began with ;-)

![IMG_7851|500x500](upload://zj6emlHV6g6lZptGjx94672Cqdl.jpeg) 

I have done a few decent rides to work (32mins each way) along rough footpaths, roads and bike path.This was along Maribynong river from Brunswick to Port Melb.  I haven't  yet even come close to flattening the battery. I went 45km per hr down the hill behind the Zoo in Parkville and it was soooooooo stable at speed with this stiff board.  It turns beautifully. I can carve easily on wide flat roads at full speed. I found I do still feel it after a while through my feet, especially raised concrete kickers in footpaths.

![IMG_7978|281x499](upload://eBVXmw0Q7kIwotgnGR2O55sUjMc.png) 

One thing I learnt is I could do with some more ground clearance from the motor mounts to the ground. It catches big rocks and debris. One mount has taken a massive hit, didn't even feel it. I actually have a small piece of metal missing from the corresponding pulley that embedded itself in the belt. You can kind of see it in the photo. I am hoping an extra 14mm of wheel will help with this.

![IMG_8303|666x500](upload://cWPVZNtxMLpqZDAKYDFHJi267y0.jpeg) 

**PHASE 2.1 BEGINS :metal:**

So this is where I am today, I have purchased a new Byron Essert Downhill board from Powell Peralta (with a tail). Yes it was expensive, but being a skateboarder, I hate the feeling of not being able to lift the front wheels to get around things. I want to be able to move the board with my foot instead of having to pick it up if I find a turn that is too narrow.

This board is _DROOOL WORTHY_, its a thing of beauty.

![IMG_8289|500x500](upload://7LwyXnEGpxldxU8eWPtmHsihgrL.jpeg) 



So I need to clean up this mess of wiring, still undecided but might make my own ESC enclosure to replace the Jaycar box. I hate the direction of the incoming phase wires where they go into the VESC's. I am too scared to cut them and solder them the correct direction towards the battery so I have tried making some 2 into 1 connectors out of 5mm bullets. Not sure if I will go down that path. You can see how much room is taken up by that horrible XT90 parallel connector

![IMG_8302|666x500](upload://ghLAKEwqH8FP3IFtI87TYOPX1n6.jpeg) 

Also have gone up to Abec 11, 97mm wheels and adding half inch risers for more clearance. They arent in this pic but you get the idea. Drilling into this board to mount everything is going to be hard to deal with...its soooooo nice.

![IMG_8308|500x500](upload://iXE1GUsIfDvqIzYM9KwMiRemG8d.jpeg) 


Also need to fix up the way the battery enclosure seals to the deck surface, need to find some thicker adhesive mounting that i can trim to shape. 

i think I might make some sort of handle to carry the thing around with. 

give me a yell if you have any questions, or if I have misquoted something! :wink:

Stay tuned

Great looking build man :) I'm in the process of waiting/ ordering parts. 

Still hadn't decided on motor/ esc combos.

Love the deck choices, they do look cool.

Starting Phase two, have been collecting bits and pieces to build some carbon fiber Enclosures for the new deck... got inspiration from @ninja on his build [https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/rebuild-my-build/18778](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/rebuild-my-build/18778)
Decided to try some ghetto carbon whilst I was waiting

Built an esc enclosure out of plywood, I made it way too big, but hopefully will work. Taped up the deck and hot glued it down so it won't move

Tried to make my small vacuum pump fit the bags you get from Bunnings for clothes storage, couldn't get it too seal properly..
![IMG_8438|666x500](upload://1ly5UkI44FsqAmjkGnvGQ9I1GcZ.jpeg) ![IMG_8454|666x500]
Ended up with a mix of Vac and pump ![IMG_8452|666x500](upload://dab9llmYp4zQ5sAPBtzW04TOQI9.jpeg) ![IMG_8453|666x500](upload://hps7297PXMgokNQnNAwexFvrijo.jpeg) 

Ended up putting some peel ply inside the bag and vacuumed it late last night. First try at this so looking forward to seeing how it turns out

Nice build and great first effort!  There is absolutely nothing to say that would be constructive on what is something you will have your own opinion on after some serious riding.  The only thing I will comment on is supplies.  Can be an issue but for me fast turnaround is key not price.  I get my consumables from hobbyking (aus stock 3 to 5 days)  Belts and small electronic connectors etc RS components (aus stock next day)  Jaycar for random shit that can take weeks from china and fucking Clarke rubber for all that vibration proofing.  Vibration is the killer of all things esk8 and your local clarke rubber can sort that shit out.  Great stuff my aussie friend and good luck.  Keep us posted on updates and new found wisdom.

Wasn't a total failure...
![IMG_8458|375x500](upload://3D6o2LO4qA5QQu2FSTLlnVvFyWb.jpeg) 

Few things I learnt were the wood putty just pulls out, need to epoxy my wood mould or give it some sort of coating, the mould wax worked well

I think I didn't have enough volume in my first coat or not enough hardener it never went off properly, you can see how wet it is.

I think I'm going to rejig the mould and try again once I get the non-ghetto bags 😉👌

I'd agree with that antispark. My friend purchased one and we needed to rewire the latching switch to normally closes as it would unlatch on big bumps in the road. Even then it died about a month later.

I'd go for a @Kug3lis antispark or a loopkey if it dies on you.

So I just rode to work this morning about 13km and left motor was making some funky noises.

Lucky I have a big workshop at work so I had a closer look and found this

😵😵😵😵😳😳😳😳😳


So glad I had a look! And so glad one of the magnets didn't break at 40km per hr...
Pulled it all apart and glued them back down and glued the retainer ring back in.. got home ok but don't think I can trust it now

Wimd resistance pays a massive part in battery consumption too. A headwind can easily cause you to be chewing more than double that of a tailwind. 

Also I don't know how old the motor is but mention it to Dexter and he should be able to sort you out.

Damn. I haven't been here for very long... But it seems like TB motors have a lot of loose magnet issues. I don't really understand why tho, isn't everybody ordering from the same motor supplier and just slapping labels on? Do they have like different levels of slave-labor quality control conveyor belts you choose when placing your order?

@Guz - Contact us and we'll see how we can help.

@s5300 - Our motors are customized. When we come across issues such as this. We make changes to prevent these issues from re-occurring.

There have been some motors that seem to be having an epoxy fail issue.  To prevent this issue in the future, we have added a few upgrades to prevent this issue from happening again even if the epoxy fails.

With the new upgrades we've lengthened the teeth on our retainer rings (frontend and backend) that add extra structure to the magnets. We've also added an additional ring on the frontside of the motor can to prevent the retainer ring from shifting or moving if the epoxy fails.

Any issues in relation to this will be warrantied. Just let us know.

Thanks man have emailed you guys👍 pS all I'm not knocking Torque Boards everything I have got from them has been excellent, as well as there customer service👌 Part of this could be some of the rough footpaths I have been riding on as well, we have a lot of sectional concrete here that gives the thing some hardcore vibrations. The motor never stopped mind you! Just made a bit of a high pitched noise, probably would of kept going for a lot longer

IPulled the other motor apart and at first look the magnets looked ok but once I pulled the retaining ring out and gently pushed one it moved... I give up

Also in the rush to fix the first motor I didn’t even know the magnets have a particular way they face inside the can..🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️😳👊🏿

Anyone know how you can check which way the magnets sit, I’ve tried to find some info but not much out there... I did find some tiny red marks on the outside of every second magnet which will help I guess if it’s an indication of polarity

Will need to check yourself if they are suitable but some of the Turnigy Sk3 & Sk8 motors are stocked by hobbyking in their Australia warehouse so could potentially get one to keep you going if the one you got working packs it up as it looks like you got a bit of a wait to get replacement parts.

You cant beat the sk3 6374's. I'm in Brisbane and am running a dual and single with them and have done hundreds of km's with zero problems. Got them on sale for $84 aud. Cheapest and best motors you can get in Australia. You just need to cover protect all openings to the motor using mesh or 3d printed covers. The problem you have experienced with the torqueboards motors is well documented and not uncommon unfortunately.

Oh no the mesh isn't to keep out the dust but rather the rocks and debris. I ran them for a little while without it and got little rocks in between the stator and magnets. The TB motors are closed so rocks cant get in but the sk3's have big openings thus the need for the mesh. I am in Clayfield so northside too but skate from there to Mt Gravatt for my commute to work. 17-20km one way 40km round trip. Its a good way to start and finish the workday :grinning:

@Boxer86 i got a 6374 Sk3 but got the stupid aero drive one without a key-way :slight_smile:
Gonna modify it to work and have ordered another one. I might run one motor backwards and one forwards until i get enough bits together to build a new setup with SurfRods Trucks and Psychotiller mounts.. I want a board with a tail i hate standing in the middle of a board. Plan is to use the board above and build a carbon enclosure. Not sure what Im going to do battery wise yet. i have a mate down here building stupidly huge batteries for his mates, putting them in 100km per hr scooters etc..:confused:

@psychotiller Dave i sent you a message on your website about your SurfRods TKPS and mounts just wanted to make sure i can run the mounts forward if i want to ? I am positive I can , but over $400 plus 4 weeks to get here so just wanna make sure! Insert noob grin here

PS Guys what gearing are you using?
I have seen a lot of 41 tooth setups with wheels over 100mm...I have 97mm Abecs, so wondering if I gear up from 15-36 on the new setup..gonna run dual 6374's in 190KV...Wondering if I should go down to 170KV to haul my fat ass better, oh yeah gonna keep running 10S5P for now..

Love guz :slight_smile:

i got a 6374 Sk3
[/quote]


That is a funny looking Sk3... just be mindful with the Sk8 I think they were designed to have the pulley lock the shaft and stop it from coming out the back of the motor where as most others use a circlip against the front bearing. They use a brass tube as per the product pic

![](https://cdn-global-hk.hobbyking.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/660x415/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/1/8/188909-189049_2_11.jpg)

If you don't use it or any other way to retain the shaft you may end up getting bell float and unlikely that will end well.

Do a test Guz

Motor is mounted on the board as per your pic, grab the motor can and see if you can pull it away from the mount plate. My guess if that it will move however much space there is from your pulley to the front bearing.

Most outrunners seem to use a circlip on the output shaft just infront of the front bearing, if I'm right and the sk8 don't use one isn't not the end of the world, just need to make sure you use something to retain it. Your local hobby store should be able to hook you up with a retaining collar (only good if small enough to contact the front bearing inner race), or you can just use a crush tube or similar like what came with the kit

Great thread Guz, I just finished my 1st esk8 build (I'm in Torquay)  with a 4. 12 vesc on 8s and the same antispark, with the hobbyking keda 6364 190kv motor. 
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html

2nd motor to be fitted when I can be bothered but having too much fun even with a single motor cruising, and with the esc dialled right back to top speed of 18kps. 

Fyi I run 15/38 gearing on my 100mm boa's and Tb trucks.

About to order surf rods TKP’s and @psychotiller mounts.. just trying to decide on pulley and belt configuration so I can order at the same time.. anyone else running psychos mounts particularly 66 mounts on TKPS? Need to decide on belt length if I run 15/36 looks like 250 or 255 will work for me...that’s if I have put the centre distance in correctly at 60mm???? 🤷‍♂️💆🏼🤦‍♀️

Finally got these in the mail they are sexy as f$ck took 6 weeks to finally arrive. Will take some getting used to these weird hangers that tighten from the outside. First problem is my maytech motors have only 26mm of axle but should be able to make it work. May need to turn down some spacers a bit more to get the pulley in as close to the truck mount as I can. 

These mounts look bullet proof

![image|375x500](upload://fxkUncK74Y4PLGdzEKbEAynQyn2.jpeg) 

Have started ordering some stuff to reterm my Maytechs to 5.5mm bullets to suit the TB Vesc’s

Found a good eBay supplier in oz if you guys here need these 

https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F323648416493

https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F163087440349

Can’t say enough about torque boards they are awesome 👏 although I have run into one snag the 55mm cans have grown somewhat to the originals 😱😱😱😱😱😱😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😤😤😤😤😤😤😭😭😭😭😭😭

The can now rubs on the inside it’s about 2mm too long now...will have to work out a spacer for them

Don't take too much out of the deck.  I would, if it were me, be popping down to clarke rubber and getting some hard 10mm sheet and cutting a gasket.  Go bolt through on the mounting hardware and torque it down.  Its the metal ownboard enclosure is it?  Can't be arsed to scroll up and I can't remember lol.  If it is you can get that thing to squeeze down fine.  Bolt through though.  If you try that with inserts they will pop out.  Its been a while dude you need to get that thing on the road!!

Gonna stick the battery to the deck eventually with Velcro. It’s hardcore thick so it won’t effect the strength of it, plus I’m gonna add this enclosure with 8 bolts which will stiffen it right back up 🤷‍♂️👌

First shake down. Finally got some time to loosely get everything together. It’s been a mission . I don’t really rate surf rods yet. The axles feel horrible to tighten up like it’s a matter of time before a thread strips.

These mounts arent really “reversible” it greatly depends on how big your wheel is, what trucks you have and the risers you use.

I’ve added another riser and I still don’t really have enough room for my wires to sit in there. I’m going to have to work out another route here.

I feel like I’ve been sold a dud with these surf rod heaps of shit. The axle setup is horrendous, I’m just waiting for the thread to f$ck up. Mind you I thought the mounts were a pressed on system but they just hang off the end of the truck and rely on you tightening the f$ck out of this horrible shoulder bolt to hold them all on the truck. One mount came lose after 120m ride down the driveway.

I gotta try and make this all work, I might have to spin the whole lot around but will make having a tail(the whole point of this expensive f$cking exercise) redundant.

I had a similar issue with cable management.  Do you have any room on the axles to to move the motors/mounts further out?  That's what I did and then routed the phase wires in between the motors as tightly together as possible.  I used lots of zipties because I'm more about function that aesthetic atm but maybe you could try a prettier version
