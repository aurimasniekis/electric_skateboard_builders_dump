Been thinking about this fun build for a while and finally got the time to do it. It was really fun planning, collecting parts, building. Relaxing really, was my modern day, easier version of ship in a bottle build because of the tiny parts, steady hand and precision needed. 

Most of the pictures are in the post but [here is a link to the full album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/fFanqP4fWtCC6FKk1).

First, list of parts.

	‚Ä¢ 4" Deck
	‚Ä¢ Cast Trucks w/ Rubber Bushings
	‚Ä¢ 7.5mm Rubber Wheels w/ Bearings
	‚Ä¢ Foam Grip Tape w/ LEGO addon

[USB connector for scale]

	‚Ä¢ Dual 0408 23KV  Motors
	‚Ä¢ 3A Brushed ESC
	‚Ä¢ 1S1P 260mAh Li-Po Battery
	‚Ä¢ FrSky Micro 8ch RX

And now, the build process. 

First, mounting the Direct Drive system, wheels and motors to trucks :)

Aaaaand, we have some lights there! Seems like the white smoke hasn't escaped yet.

Trying out the board‚Ä¶ Woah, this thing is SICK!!!

[Massive torque, no need for push start!](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPyKkt1qMKIuUyWiafEipOZgOeXHPhyi5M0aScdM2svDggzbR-3DZdl919Ss5JjUA/photo/AF1QipOkqfow4motZZ4o_YR3othh2Ux2VQV4GPnFjmAR?key=b05MdEtNNUV3ckZMUEZ1WkxTTGEzdTJnck1ET0xn) :)

I have also invited some of the forum members for exclusive beta testing of the board.

haha :joy: I can't agree with your more.  That picture is legit me half of the time on bike trails. :peach: I loved your creativity on the electric setup and drivetrain. Does it work? :upside_down_face: You need to post a video of it working on youtube. :money_mouth_face::movie_camera:

I fully endorse these as the best boards of 2018. 

I'm going to need 15 of these for the racks this spring. I've invited The Littles to a performance day.

The best part about my mini fig is that i actually have a green hoodie i skate in all the time, its a green Attack On Titan hoodie with Scouting Legion logos on it.

I actually made a mix on the transmitter to make left / right motors rotate more or less depending on the left stick position and it is working wonderfully. But physics don't agree with that (otherwise all of us with single motor boards would constantly be steering). It still does turn some but not as much to be able to do sharp and controllable turns :)

Of course, I think 1Wh is good for all airliners! But I really need replacable battery for v2 :D

I still need to test the range LOL. But not in miles, hours/days :)

Should mail that guy around to each other(s) for a weekly ride along vid;
‚Ä¢Receive in mail...

‚Ä¢Take some vids (1 min total length) with it in "frame of view" i.e. (Ride along, reenact an incident).
Uplaod to "little big curvy weekly grind"  tread

‚Ä¢Mail to next person in line or back to @SilentException 
Fabulous job... cheers!

Edit: although I do like the stick figure rendering in, "after accident analysis"
