Hello guys, although I'm here for a long time, I've never did a build thread and since I may canibalize this board soon I decided to share it in details

This is my third board and I wanted something more compact to take to class, way more powerful and with dual drive for better traction since the a significant portion on the roads here are crap and there is lot of hills, on a few of them i couldn't climb because of that

The idea started when I found a cheap and nice looking shape on the eBay equivalent from here. First thing I did when it arrived was to measure it and draw in CAD so I could print the enclosure with a perfect fit

![IMG_0355|690x388](upload://9QMZHMLsWSuxSppEAwW4qEeo8WV.JPG)

I spent more than a year just mocking things up in CAD until I arrived in something that I liked

![Projeto%20sem%20t%C3%ADtulo%206|690x388](upload://3BsItg7VDPy9SApHlWrhkcVmRjR.jpg)![Projeto%20sem%20t%C3%ADtulo%2015|690x388](upload://sZJfsmYsRsUvkEG8RgqzYWFnEgV.jpg)![Projeto%20sem%20t%C3%ADtulo%2012|690x388](upload://iddB9n44s666b5Nl53JanpnDYVy.jpg)![Projeto%20sem%20t%C3%ADtulo%2016|690x388](upload://9HBwjtt91WrGLZ5iO4j73zCnvSa.jpg)![Projeto%20sem%20t%C3%ADtulo%207|690x388](upload://bzmRn4nbqVKokgRwFiz9vdrOKKj.jpg)![Projeto%20sem%20t%C3%ADtulo|690x388](upload://phn7pJEJqHQVWYY2Mf2pdQ13wDv.jpg)![Projeto%20sem%20t%C3%ADtulo%2024|690x388](upload://ngXXJQjl9TG9CSq4Lmw7NtK1wc2.jpg) 


After that it was a matter of fabricating everything

But this is the final result, tomorrow I will continue posting the rest of the build

By the way this board has probably more than 600 Km on it so far, but there are a big issue that I will discuss later. This shows that even when you plan each part for a long time things will go wrong when trying something new. If you notice in two of the pictures I'm running a single 6355, that has to do with the big problem

Thanks guys

For the enclosure I wanted something sleek and with a not DIY look, 3D printing was the obvious choice since I have a printer

The main problem was how to print, since my print bed is only 180x190 mm, so I made a few interlocks to glue everything together

Unfortunately all pieces warped like crazy due to the lack of a enclosed printer

![IMG_3368|690x388](upload://rTbMwCMkYanmDtRd3LbVg5QDU84.JPG)

In this picture you can easily see the tabs warped, this was after a lot of time with a hair dryer straightening things up

![IMG_3916|666x500](upload://gIuQ8v1C0zP2lbAxBWpIQmIbChk.JPG)

And after lots of sanding it was ready to prime, sand a lot more and finally paint

And the final result

**_EDIT: for some reason none of my uploads are working, will add latter_**

No as thin as I hopped since my deck has a pretty big concave, so even if the enclosure is thin, it looks bigger

The main problem was lack of space for washers, each time I open and close the plastic wears down, a few o-rings helped slow it down, but the damage is already done

Thanks, all done in Solidworks, most of the time I don't even bother to sketch things by hand since i'm pretty bad at it, but in CAD you can do 2D sketches just to see how things fit together

Here's the final, not a great picture, but the best I have

For the drive train I went with something totally custom, first because nothing available was ideal, and second where is the fun in buying something ready to use?

I always liked to use a bearing inside the pulley, everything stays in place and you lower the load on the wheel core. a 17mm bearing was used and the truck machined to achieve a perfect fit

For the mount it was a challenge since even on the 195mm Paris hanger there was almost no space for dual motors with 15mm belts

![1A1892E4-C945-4396-9E99-8C075D0119D9|666x500](upload://4rreLhZQa3sFzG30SqMTX0y1Rp0.jpeg)

![IMG_4144|666x500](upload://szMkWiGVR22xD0Q7hWImUFrTQWf.JPG)

The space between the motors is just enough for the motors don't touch

![IMG_4139|666x500](upload://tmxWTK81pqzx2Bw1Jo6xBErx3ZI.JPG)

Also I made covers for the pulley and a inside cover that route the wire to the back

![728AED3D-4625-4686-B0C7-B8E895C8CB72|657x500](upload://m8P30uymvvrz6ptPWdrwOwdAZdi.jpeg)

But them we arrive at the problem, 17mm was too much material removed from the axle or I got lucky and got a bad hanger. After the 500 km or so I noticed that the motors were close to each by a good amount and them realized that the entire hanger had bent

I'm glad I caught this early or I thing one of the wheels may have snapped and I kissed the road Boosted V2 style

I already made a way to leave more material using a bigger bearing and a spacer, but I will not implement since I'm parting out this build to make a new one

Donâ€™t get me wrong, itâ€™s a joy to ride it, but not where I live

The short deck means I ride with the foots right on top of the trucks, so no dampening from the wood, also the small wheels doesnâ€™t help in rougher roads. There some streets that I canâ€™t see if going anything faster than 5 km/h, the eyes start to vibrate and everything gets blurry 

But when the roads is smooth is amazing, exactly by being short and light is super responsive

I will keep the basic structure of it, only removing the trucks and eletronics for the new board, this may become the test plataform for the hub motors Iâ€™m developing, but thereâ€™s a long way to go

The electronics are pretty straight forward

* Dual VESC 6
* ArduÃ­no based remote controller with UART comunication
* Custom remote
* DC-DC converter for powering the front lights that I've never installed :grin: 
* Metr Bluetooth module
* Vedder anti-spark switch
* Battery charge indicator Boosted style
* No BMS ( Previously Battman BMS, shame that the project was abandoned)
* 10S3P NCR18650GA semi flexible and spot welded
* Motor wires embedded in the deck

I think that's it for this build

Just some comment's, I have managed to get 44km of range with the top speed limited to 25 km/h. I use it limited to 33 km/h, faster than that is not that stable, you can ride, I got it to 44 km/h once, but you have to be focused

And for last two videos that I did using Metr.at and the overlay from @rpasichnyk

Hey nice build one question though

those kegel pronges here:

![image|666x500](upload://523XdPKpiPBXY3PNgnYyEgtq0RV.jpg)

How did you make them? Whats the diameter?

I think the diameter on the pulley I design before was 5.3mm, but I was wondering if you did something different
```

I buy them in my local fasteners store, they go by ground pins, I don't know the exactly nomenclature in english, they are made to aligne two parts of equipment with precision before fastening

**EDIT: found, they should be called guide pin I think**

This ones are 6mm diameter by 25mm length, the fit is really tight, you need a press or something similar to put them on, and a big hammer to take them off

First time I was afraid to crack the core, but it worked
```

Why not take a 6mm drill and make the holes in the core fit perfectly?

```
The pins also hold the pulley in place, thereâ€™s nothing else securing it, so it need to be a inteferent fit

I donâ€™t if this would work without the support bearing on the pulley since the belt would generate a moment that would try to pull the pins out of the core
```

No, the bearing is free to move on the hanger, it doesnâ€™t touch the motor mount, this way you donâ€™t over constrains it and allow for thermal expansion without putting a axial load on it

Cool little board. You said it gets a little sketchy at high speeds. (I didn't know you could get those speeds outta 5055 motors) 
Do you have other boards that go that fast or faster?
I ask because at higher speeds  (at least with downhill, I'm very new to esk8) changing your stance is really important.

I think this was my fast board, but yeah, charging the stance I could go up to 45 km/h, but not a way that id like to commute 

About the 5055 is just about finding a balance, you could even do that with a single, but the hill climb would suck. Currently the limitation is the battery that max out at 30 A, so anything above 17 km/h the VESC lower the motor current to keep the battery current under that

Thank you for explaining that. 
The board has duels but it's only running a 6S.
I  have a hummie deck ordered. It's getting 2 6374 190kv at 12s.

Update:

Installed the TB 218 trucks while my Hummie deck doesnâ€™t arrive so I can ride dual motors again

What a difference, I can go 40 km/h using the same bushings that I used on the Paris 195mm, on it 33 was about the limit of stability

The mounts turned out a little bit lower than the CAD drawing, donâ€™t really know why, but the gummies it wonâ€™t be a problem

Enough talking

Rocks always got inside the motors, but since I mounted them to the back it become a nightmare, you clean and sometimes immediately another one get inside and start grinder

Cleaning the motors before sealing them, the one that was making noise was a mess inside, I have no idea what got inside and completely disintegrated, looks like a black goo that coated the entire stator but not the magnets

Today was the first day that I thought I would not make home, arrived with the board barely moving on flat ground

Left my home at 14:30 and rode almost non stop until 5:30, when I felt that the LVC was starting to engage I was at the other side of town

Was a good ride
