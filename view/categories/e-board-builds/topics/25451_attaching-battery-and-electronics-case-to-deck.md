How do attach battery and electronics case to deck without damaging it? Is drilling holes and attaching case with screws safe for wood (bamboo deck)? If so what screws should I use? 
PS. case is made of plywood

drilling holes wont damage it. remember decks already have 8 holes and they hold up fine ;)

You can use threaded inserts, lots of people do...I even have in the past.  Normally I use a 5/8's sheet metal screw now.  They are pan head and have wide threads so they grab well.
