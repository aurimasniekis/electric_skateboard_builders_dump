New to these whole electric skateboards, I kept seeing Boosted boards and then my friend bought one. Searched the internet and found Endless Sphere and eSk8. Wow, the information and awesome builds. Lurked and read, lurked and read some more. Found all the info need to start my build. Special thanks to @SteveS  for sharing his VESC settings for the same motor, saved hours of tuning. So here is my build with all that I wanted and enough power for my hills around me in Georiga.

 Arbor Axis Deck
 Caliber II Trucks
 Bones Ceramics
 Orangatang Kegel 80mm Wheels
 TorqueBoards V3 Mount w/ 16t/36t
 SK3 6374 192kv
 VESC
 12s Lipo (4 x 3s 5000mah)
 Bicycle Headlight &  LEDs For Night Riding

Still working on placement of all the components before an enclosure can be made. I charge the lipos with 4 individual chargers for now so I would like the enclosure to be easily removed. I liked the magnet idea that @barajabali did, and possible hinged enclosure that I saw. 

Let me know what you guys think.

I got some new modular enclosures. I'm working on. :smile:

I was thinking of a simple way which we can mount our components yet still remove the enclosure easily.

- **Universal electronics enclosure** - Single ESC, Dual ESC, Receiver, Y connectors, etc..Only 12S ESC's due to 1" in height.
- **Battery enclosures** for 2x3s, 2x6s, EPOWER 6s2p, EPOWER 10s3p, EPOWER 12S3P. EPower packs are for my 18650 packs but you can most definitely fit 4x3s packs or what not in them. The EPOWER Packs and Electronics enclosure are only 1" in height.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a412448720184c59ce8ad17ae1d0f58c830c6612.png" width="690" height="374">

They are all similar to this one above. I'll post a better photo in the near future. You can see that you can easily use a #6 or M4 bolt. Push the enclosure a few mm's over to the bigger hole and pop it up. It will be a bit shorter. I'll be removing the flange on the front right side to allow for less of a wheelbase.

What would be nice is a weather proofing strip around the flange area but that tends to be fairly annoying due to the bolt holes in the way.

I like the 3D printed parts.. How's the back foot stop? Does it help? I enjoy riding with a front foot stop. Especially, going downhill I can just ride carelessly lol.

I have the same board too and it's pretty nice.. Does flex a bit but nice none the less. Although, I noticed the grip tape is wearing off. I'll probably put some clear griptape I have just on the foot area.

@torqueboards That is a good designed way of taking those enclosures off. Loosen it up slide it back remove, slide them back on and tighten them up again.

Thanks, I love designing things. Honestly I haven't touched it yet... I ride forward on mine more than back there. Maybe me being 5'8" means I won't reach back there. Knowing its there though if my foot ever gets back there it should be nice. :smile:

It also has my switch for turning on my LEDs and has My XT90 anti-spark loop key in it. 

I am 160lbs and its definitely a flexy board. Although I don't mind the flex rolling over some of the huge speed humps in the park area at speed. After putting in some different venom bushings though, 36mph is a little more comfortable. I am slowly noticing that grip tape wearing. :frowning: I guess I will be patching mine soon enough.

Thanks, its easier that finding the plug on the bottom for the Xt90. I am getting motor mount impressions in the board with it the motor there. I tightened it a little then leaned on the board to let it move where it needed, then tightened it down all the way. Maybe I can move it up some, I will check again tonight. How close is your mount to the deck?

I am running the 4x3 lipo packs on one of my builds and use clevis pins to quickly secure/remove the enclosure. Here is the build link: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carbon-python-hi5ber-python-caliber-ii-s-single-6374-hi-output-vesc-12s-lipo/2208

Thanks, I have been really happy with that system. I will likely convert my other build to something similar when I have time. 

Yes, I used a little bit of epoxy just to keep them in place. You technically don't even need glue since the compression of the seal pulls the pins down. I ran it without glue for a week just to make sure it was what I wanted.

Of course, just make sure you open it up and hot glue the coil to the board. I broke the first one quickly with the vibrations. I opened it before I sent it back and the coil had broken off inside it. The coil has no support and will break due to heavy vibrations from the board. The second one I got in exchange I opened up and hot glued the coil in place. Problem solved as of now.

I printed 2 wall mounts, one printed perfectly, the other didn't complete and I printed just the top part that was missing but it's not perfect. Anyway, I have not hung the parts on the wall yet.

As for other parts, I printed one wheel pulley from thingiverse and it printed really well and strong. I'd totally use it. I wont use it since I ordered parts from @torqueboards and I'm waiting for them to arrive.

Other things that I see as easy to print: enclosure (I have a thread here), truck hole covers, bumpers, LED holders, etc.

I'm currently working on a very similar build, same deck, motor, and very similar batteries. What was the final configuration of your batteries on your finished build? I'm trying to design an enclosure right now and can't decide if I should arrange them vertically like yours or horizontally across the board. Also, what are you using to attach them to the deck, I'm guessing velcro?

the batteries are still vertical but I haven't built a case for them. Industrial velcro but try not to take them off once you stick them.

Does this board flex? I recently bought an Enertion battery so I can't have a flexible deck but i really love the shape and size of this.

I love the volt meter and loop key placement!  Beautiful and clean design.  By looking at your board I would have never thought you were new to the community, (no duct tape, LOL 😂).  How did you make the inserts in the front and the back?  I'd honestly be willing to purchase them! How do you like your motor?  I purchase an Enertion motor which I have no complaints at all, but it was a bit on the pricey side.  As for enclosures, I'm finding that to be kind of a pain.  I want to vacuum form an enclosure but don't have the time.  In the meantime I used an IKEA drawer insert which looks awesome.  However, it is a pain to get in and out of when I charge my (2) 5s 5000mah Lipos.  Check out my build to get an idea of my enclosure  Anyhow, mad props on the build my friend. I really like the clean and simplistic design!

This board does flex, but this one is bamboo. I believe they make three other ones with different woods. This one has the most flex of the Axis.

I power my LEDs with the 12v side of the BEC and my front light with the 5v side.

Thank you @nmagz3, the inserts are 3d printed. 

There are many people on here that can make you a nice vacuum formed enclosure. If you can make some extensions that either glue into the IKEA drawer insert or just hang out a hole for charging them without removing them.

I still charge mine with a separate Lipo charger. Nothing is finished on this board. 

Thank you, It rides nice being bamboo and has tons of power.

The main important thing is that the orange makes it faster. Anyway I think I'm gonna be building a sort of carbon fibre low rider, trucks mounted similarly to trampas style, on an angle but not a big angle, but drop through, of course even with 107mm wheels I think itll be too low to mount the motors inwards so facing outwards for meee

Of course the orange makes it faster. Sounds like a sweet build you are going to build.

If I need it, I'm mean I'd love to implement it on my build, would you consider selling the truck caps with space for the charger, power switch and battery indicator?

Hey there, love the cleanliness of the 3d printed parts! I just printed the loop key cover myself, and noticed that it doesn't actually fit in the hole of my board. Would you happen to still have the source files for it? I have the same board, so I'm not sure why it doesn't fit. Also, are the trucks top mounted or through mounted? Thanks!

Thinking about using that exact same deck, how is the flex on it and is there any way to get the files for the top patches but without the holes made for the electronics not really wanting to have much uncovered wiring.

I am about 165lbs and love the flex, I'd say medium to stiff. I can adjust a file and upload if you need it. Just a blank cover is all you want?

Mine was a tight fit. The more I think about it the more the part that drops into the dropout doesn't need to be there. I don't think...

yeah the front and back blank would be great still like the style on the back just I  don't want the holes as that just creates more weak points and dirt collection

how did you build that battery setup is it all the way series or 2 series 1 parallel or 2 parallel 1 series? i’ve (4)3s 3000mah 20-25c and i’m trying to connect them to (2)60A escs (it’s wired in parallel or should I have connected them by series or not at all) to dual motor (2) 270kv motors
