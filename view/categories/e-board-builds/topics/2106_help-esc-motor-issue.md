Don't think it's recognizing the wiiceiver ... Did you try using a different hand controller? Or plugged incorrectly

I'm also using the K-force 120A, if the beeps are once every 1.5 seconds, you have no signal from the Tx/Rx. If the beeps are 4 beeps per second, its' asking for your throttle range. It should be as simple as pulling the throttle to max and then brake to max. I've always used the GT2B so nunchucks are outside my experience.

thanks for replaying.
i also tried with 12S freind ESC and it worked.
i have 2 nuncheks , and as mentioned i have tried with 6S esc and also with 12S freind ESC both worked.
whitch means wiicive battery pack, remte and motor are good and well functioning.
i think it beeps every 1.5 seconds.

any more ideas?

I'd go over the whole ESC very carefully and look for wires with shorts or anything that might be a problem. With electronics it could be something as simple as a shorted wire. Also look for signs of burning or heat damage. Give it a good sniff to see if it smells like it's been too hot for too long.

So you're saying swapping out the reciver made it work?

For some reason sometimes the wiiceiver has a hard time working with different ESCs and doesn't recognize it...dunno why..never bothered to find out

I am using similar esc with yours. It seems that your esc doesnt detect any RX / TX module and or connections, 90% this is the cause of the 1.5s motor / esc beeps.

First you have to test your nunchuck if it works (easy if you have wii) or find friends who have. If it doesnt work then you know your nunchuck doesnt work and might return it for warranty. If it works fine, than the wiiceiver is the one that doesnt work. As it appears that you get this from diyelectricskateboard (I hope I am right), you can contact @torqueboards for help.

Are you able to post a picture of your wiring and your UBEC (The thing that powers the receiver)?

@shaohad - As I mentioned to you. I can refund you for the Wiiceiver and you can keep it. We test these prior to shipping them out. Not sure, why yours would not work. Contact me. Hopefully, you get it working however.

Are you able to try a different 5v power source? I had the same problem of beeping and it was because my UBEC was broken. It may also be the connection between the esc and receiver.

Usually beeping noise is the ESC can't find the remote.

Have you tried switching the two cables of the 5v battery pack and the esc? Are you sure they are in the correct order?
