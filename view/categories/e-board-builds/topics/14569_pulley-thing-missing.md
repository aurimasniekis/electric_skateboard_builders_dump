Where can I find that little piece that fits in the pulley thats helps locking the shaft? 
I have order this pulley from alien power systems but it did not come with that piece, just the pulley itself, so now I cannot lock it and I have the esk8 on hold because of this little piece that is missing... <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/8/086ecc37b89526bebe82e3d06e3d95d6e4d10eb8.png" width="251" height="267">

It is called a keyway, and can be found almost anywhere online and cost less than a few dollars. You don't need it, if you put flat spots on the shaft and secure the Pulley with set acres then you would be fine.

[The pulley](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/htd-5-motor-pulley/) doesn't come with anything other than the pulley itself, the details on the product page are simply there to show what the pulley is compatible with, etc.  If you contact Bruno @ Alien he should be able to sort you out a keyway to fit, along with the tiny allen key piece that locks the pulley into place on the motor shaft (if the pulley didn't come with that as well).  Hope this helps!
