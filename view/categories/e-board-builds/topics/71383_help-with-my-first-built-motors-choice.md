Hi,
i'm making my first DIY.
I have doubts about the motor-battery for my board.
I'm looking 3 options:
A- Maytech hub motors (800w, 100kv) with 10s4p battery 30q.
B- Metasurf direct drive (future 70kv, 80A) with 12s4p battery 30q.
C- Other brand hub motor with 12s4p battery 30q.

For vesc I will use a dual vesc4.12 or 4.20.

Ho is better combination?
I'm looking fast board, about 45-50km/h max.speed.

Thanks very much.

Miguel.

can´t say much about the motors but the dual 4.20 does not run well on 12s, keep that in mind

And its spotty @ 10s if you don't go conservative on vesc settings. I have one myself and plan on an 8s dual belt build. If you want reliability @ 12s, go for the 6.6 You won't be disappointed

They are both very good vesc. I have a single focbox and love it. Ive heard good things about the flipsky as well. Flipsky is cheaper.

If you don't mind waiting the unity is a similar price to the flipsky 6.6 dual. Both are good options but the unity has a smaller footprint.

and the unity has more features...
just watched the latest enertion youtube video about the unity.
Didn´t know about a lot of things which implemented in the SW and HW which definitly are a nice to have.
