Who will die first :joy:
Maybe all survive, but i dont think that this would be funny :laughing:

Starting here a new tread with known and also new parts in different combination...

More then one reason for it :slight_smile:
1) Looking for hard testing of the new Vesc-6 
2) Also wanna really try to kill one of my drivegears... dont managed that until now
3) Got more then one request for 80mm Motors on Direct Drive, so checking for clearence btw
4) wanna use the 80mm Leopards agian, always loved this shiny red big bad MTF

So here we go with a slightly used Direct Drive (its one from the CNC machined Premium ones... but dont matters... in the end if it here fits we will be fine with the Laser Cutted ones too because they are little narrower....

shiny new Vesc6, hooked up for a short test with 12S Lipo and Dymond 63mm Outrunners... they work so we can start to push the limits :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Can you take full advantage of 80mm motors w/ VESCs?  I would have thought the amps would be a bottleneck.

Its Vesc6 Dude, we will screw the amps up to new Limits ... hopefully
I think with 120a this things starts to breath heavily... on a continious level you will never extend that 80A limit IMO, only burst for short periods of time
Super interrested if we get it on a brutal Roxxy level with better control and all the nice Vesc features...

```
if the vesc6 really delivers 60 constant Amps that would be 2700Watt@12s so >50000Watt in Dual with 10 000Watt possible MaxAmp bursts.
And tons of torque from the Leo 8072 I guess thats more than enough, otherwise @Nowind will be Highway-Ready then.

Just following roughly the form of the Leopard...

No its actually a Elastomere Damping Element ... 
All honor is @Duffman... he testet this a year or longer ago... their is a tread on German forum

Maybe he will translate in english anytime.... i know he is really busy...  

Will check also with just springs added if their is any clearence conflict

I shortened the Shafts with a angle grinder, fresh cutter and one fast cut... easy
This is what needet to remove on the normal E-Toxx Direct Drive, about 33mm free shaft length... about 11mm on the Leo´s

Glued the new spurs to the shaft, use brake cleaner first, aply fresh Loctide 603 or 638 ...

Turn the shaft and make sure that you reach most of the contact area
let it sit, make sure that nothing ran into the bearing/motors (-;

So the cutoff in the adapter is also need for clearence to the truck clamping part @Cobber 
Not only for venting :kissing_closed_eyes:

The mount use see here is a prototyp, was testing if it make sense to machine some pockets for wheight reduction in the stainless mount... laying around and just use it for checking clearence now

I mount it on one of the full machined aluminium ones, here the clearence to the Baseplate is about 7mm per side smaller then on the regular Direct Drive... will now mount the stuff for max tilt clearence check 

:imp: come back later :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

the motors probably stick past it. on my drive setup with 6374's the motors just barely clear. about 3-5mm inside 8" street tires. those beasts are way bigger. cant wait for the video jens:smiling_imp:

or is it your thought to get more torque from the Leos ?

looks awesome and dangerous anyway.

To get full advantage of VESC 6 I'd add hall sensors to those leos, I think burnouts from stand still would not be an issue then :D It's pretty simple, you just may need to mill small slots between stator ribs and then glue halls with soldered cables :sunglasses: 

Just my two cents, as always Jenso, You keep pushing boundaries further and further!

Why would sensors keep this thing from burnouts?
If the wheel slips the hall sensor does not know that.
Sensors only help cogging issues and to get the motor going - they are not used for traction control AFAIK

I do not know the leos from inside, but with some motors you could just glue them between the starot teeth. Sure then they are perpendicular tu the rotormagnets but that does not seem to matter.
At least in my sk3 that worked if there is enough space above the windings

That's why I put "may" in that sentence ;) I had to in my emax GT5345, gaps were to narrow but assuming Leo's are 80mm outrunners it indeed may be possible to simply glue sensors in stator gaps 😎

You are absolutely right... i wished i have done this before glueing the spurpulleys to the shaft...
so we will go with a NON sensored test first

_Sick_ one Jenso, cool box. Wonder what it would cost me to get a 2d cnc for the shed? lol

5:1 so your using the "mini" drive BigBoy, not the emtb drive (6:1, but with wider axel)? ...rhetorical question
Be interesting how much abuse it will take with less teeth, good test of the pom gear with those big motors, that said 4wd should help spread the load :) Have you got any idea on weight @BigBoyToys? gota be 1-1.2kg ea?

The motors are 1490g so roughly 1.5kg!

U actually brought up a detail Im not sure about. @Nowind  are u able to supply a 5:1 on the full size vertigos? If its only 6:1 I might need to bump that KV up some haha. Also, are u guys calculating speed based on a very high efficiency? Ive found mynreal world top speeds to be at 70% over multiple builds now.

Hmm, my 4wd hub board has 7200 watts, when u reach topspeed is pretty abrupt, definitely not a power limited speed. It only did 1mph faster top speed in foc as it did as a 2wd on bldc. Same with my jacobs hubs, with and without the ralphy mod, my trampa and a pair of chinese 70lv hubs i have. Always 70% of predicted top speed.

[Seems like quite a few people do better than 70% of their theoretical vmax](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/top-speed-and-efficiency/5024/19) @BigBoyToys. Some are only a couple kph away...
There must be a reason? A lot of the cheaper Chinese motors on the RC forums test in the mid 80's while higher quality motors test in the mid 90's. But that's power output and what you seem to be talking about is running out of gear? I guess something to consider is _kv_ ratings are not perfect and even high end motor manufacturers will quote a manufacturing variance of _X%_. LMT quote 4% for example. Maybe it is a weight and air resistance thing too but then we start talking about power...

With 6kg of copper I think you could push a bit more, those motors are double the size of what most people think of as big (6374) :joy:

Hmm, besides "Torcman" i actually do not know (m)any "not-Chinese" Motor Manufacturer.
But comparing my Torcman-ebike Motor o a compareable 8085 from China (Freerchobby [https://german.alibaba.com/supplier_wc4BAAK3T0PYJYq9tF15IYrFrh0-/search/product?_csrf_token_=135g8y20fpzw&SearchText=8085](https://german.alibaba.com/supplier_wc4BAAK3T0PYJYq9tF15IYrFrh0-/search/product?_csrf_token_=135g8y20fpzw&SearchText=8085)) i see alot of difference in Quality and exactness. After measuring my chinese Motor with the Power-Drill-rpm-measure methode i found out that its around 20Kv of from what i ordered. Torcmans Motor is maybe 1% off the predicted KV.

One Theory i made up is that they might just have a Stock of Motors lets say 30KV-60KV-90KV-120KV......210KV
And if you order "custom-KV" you get whats close to your wish. Cause i was surprised how fast those Motors arrived from Chian with my Custom Wishes ?!

But hey that just critisim on myself for abusing Chinese-Slave-Industry....cause you get what you pay, and sometimes i would love, but cannot pay ("Deutsche-Qualität").
I really hope that Freerchobby is not a Slave-driving Factory (:pray:) cause when i ordered some Motors there 6374 and 8085 it was like communicating with an European company, so they really made custom KV Motors for me and according to my wishes (and what makes me sceptic, that they did that really cheap).   
Maybe thats no secret anyway, but i think freerchobby also produces the APS Motos, cause they look exactly similar just without the APS-logo. But probably there are hundres of Motor-Clone-Factories in China ?

Check the ERPM settings if you use a VESC, thats how you could lower a High-KV Motor.
But 70% is alot, so you rather have a really shitty Motor here or its far away from labeled KV.
Does it Produce alot of Heat ? Than you know where the missing Energy went.

Are you serious, thats 80km/h. I mean people are always pushing to some (guiness-record-levels) but with a Trampa under your feet,....I think thats just a bone-cracking machine at 80km/h.

Most of my builds come nowhere near my erpm settings. Heat, makes sense. Ive always just assumed overstated efficiency ratings. We should start a new topic about this and see if we can find a trend between different motors/setups and % theoretical topspeed.[quote="notger, post:56, topic:30822"]

Yeah my current trampa gets squirmy about 30mph. Should be a fun project to try some different things on to improve highspeed stability (wedges under baseplate to change truck angle, rigid enclousure to stiffen deck, custom spring inserts/dampas).

Am I the only that feels the Trampa is pretty stable at high speed? No matter how fast I go I feel the wheels and longer trucks helps so much in stabilizing the whole set up. 

Regular skates on the other hands feels awkward and non forgiving. It requires more.......skills and strength so to speak. Idk, it's hard to go back to regular trucks after using the Trampa for so long.

First of all nice build.:+1: 
I think there is already a firmware file coming with VESC Tool without any software limits. After flashing it, it should be possible to set 120A motor current. I haven't the time to test that, so on your own responsibility. What battery current do you set? 
It would be great if you could use a logging tool like the [https://metr.at](https://metr.at) bluetooth module or any other logger to know what currents you really reach. Would love to see a log of your ride.

EDIT : Battery current is 80A i think... if i get it right its influenced more the high rpm area?
There is plenty of thrust ...

I've been playing with both. I need to try out FOC again now that I've turned up the amperage.

I think the noise is the motor, I have 4 of them so I could swap them out and check it out. But it is much quieter on FOC. I'll setup FOC tonight with it and do another quick vid for you. I was waiting on the cases I want to use before finishing the settings xD

If you're using VESC6 be careful using BT module as I think someone bricked their VESC using incorrect codes, there's more info on the forum related to VESC6

I'm with @Nowind it sounds like your _backlash_ or play in the gears is set too tight, I do not know the engineering specs of Jenso's gear box but their needs to be a certain amount of play between the gears for proper meshing. For example in this catalog the stipulate from .1 to .5mm backlash for module 1.5-2 spur gears. Maybe Jenso could tell us how he sets the play?

No Pics , No Vids ... only pure emotions after 20mins of torque rush 

# BÄÄÄÄÄÄÄMMM

This machine is an absoultely beast, maybe needet 2-3 Batterys to get on with it : 

I´m used to Rc Type Esc´s like Max6 and Roxxy... with the Vesc6 i have had to realize that i should pull the trigger FULL for full PUNCH :heart_eyes:

Really impressive this System, you get an 
-perfect startup, smooth as hell
-nice brakes, full proportional over whole triggerway 
-stays actually cool as an pinguin , 
lowest is for sure the VESC, dont feel any temp on the bottom of my case(direct connection)
Motors are barely warm, and it was no cold day in Germany today

HOTTEST is actually one "parallel-connector" i think their is a bad solder... will check before next run
Generall i think i have to invest in some new Batterys, this ones are really well tortured...
Best Performance is always a complete system...

Get a Beer now, stay tuned (-:

Being a bigger rider, an 80mm torque monster is very attractive/interesting, but it looks like (unconfirmed) trampa may be phasing out their infinity/vertigo trucks (based on website updates/stock levels and [I think] a bump in price to the ultimate trucks).

@Nowind: you should be able to increase the current limit way further, as I'm riding my VESC 4 boards with c6364 motors at 100A motor and battery current limit. Also tried 120A which ran fine for some time until a motor started smoking... :imp:

According to a post from Ben the VESC 6 can measure up to +-165A, so you should not exceed 150A for motor/battery max and 160A absolute max to keep some safety margin.

(for beta users: http://www.vesc-project.com/comment/377#comment-377)

So what do you think I told you in this post? :confused:
[quote="hexakopter, post:65, topic:30822"]
I think there is already a firmware file coming with VESC Tool without any software limits. After flashing it, it should be possible to set 120A motor current.
[/quote]

I mean exactly what @Duffman is talking about. When I remember correct Benjamin said that you shouldn't set the motor current higher than 140A on the VESC 6 and already that could fail because he has never tried it himself. (He has no motor that is able to handle it) So everything on your own risk.

[quote="Nowind, post:74, topic:30822"]
Thanks Dude.

If I were you, I would accept @rpasichnyk's offer to send you the module. I know that his metr app works with VESC 6 like a charm, because I use it myself and that not matched apps to the new VESC communication protocol could fry your VESC 6.

Should work. My last ride was with 1.45 as well.

To sum up :
- You have VESC 6 with FW3.26
- You wired correctly Rx HM10 to Tx VESC6, Tx HM10 to Rx VESC6 (+Vcc and GND)
- You selected PPM + UART and 9600 baudrate in VESC Tool
- You use VESC Monitor (by Ackmaniac), version 1.45.
and
- It does not work

Well, that doesn't make sense. :confused:
Double-check wiring maybe, but I don't have ideas anymore to troubleshoot your issue.
Can you try another HM-10 module ?
(one of mine stopped working after an update of Ackmaniac app, don't know why)

That's what I think, too. My HM-10's working on HW 4.12 with FW 2.18 or 2.54 but not with FW 3.26. After downgrading they work again. But i use FOC with FW 3.26 so i can't use the app :sweat:

Maybe @Ackmaniac has some identifier to switch between protocols for v4 and v6 hardware.
If that is the case maybe the "no-limits" firmware does not respond in a way that lets the app decide that it is a v6.
@Nowind does the app work with @Pimousse's instructions when using the normal firmware for the v6?
```

---
## \#118 Posted by: Pimousse Posted at: 2017-08-23T13:11:50.143Z Reads: 393

AFAIK, Ackmaniac uses first the COMM_FW_VERSION to determine wheter it's the old or new firmware.
I didn't updated my VESC 6 since I received them (very first of them in the beta program), maybe it's a old one that still works.
I'll check the version this evening.

Maybe VESC Monitor is checking the exact version, so updating a new one results to a bad selection of the protocol ?
Just guessing.

Be careful with to high Amp settings! The no limits FW has no limit and that can be fatal for the hardware. 
120-130 is probably the most you should use. Did you also screw up the battery Amps to that level?
Reliance really depends on the time you actually draw these amps. I bet its quite a short period in your case and that might be fine. Have a close look at the temp. 
We do not recommend to use the unlimited FW, unless you know exactly what you do. It's experimental!
This is why I wanted to ask Benjamin for a 120-130A limited FW for your setup. 
Obviously you are experimenting.....

Good that you now got it.:slight_smile: Hopefully next time I will describe things more clearly. Was thinking you as a VESC expert understand what I was talking about. :smiley:
By the way your parallel connector looks not that safe to push 100A through. Not just because the XT90 was designed for 90A, but more because of the little solder contact. Adding some copper/wire there for a bigger contact area would be a good idea.

Do you know that the UART (TX and RX) pins are switched between HW4.12 and HW6.X? When you already switched them and it is still not working than its most likely @Ackmaniac's App that is not updated for the newest firmware. I could just mention @rpasichnyk metr app again that is working fine for me and with its design, functions like video overlays and other extras I prefer it over Ackmaniacs app.

[/quote]
It should be no problem to climb the Mont Blanc with these settings, because the VESC decrease the current output when a temperature limit is reached. So it is not possible to pull 100A when the VESC is to hot. For example my cutoff starts at 80°C. I have reached that limit quite often, but no problem at all because of the automatic cutoff limit.

@TarzanHBK I can tell you that the current VESC 6 in a eBike with a big motor is already a lot of fun. :slight_smile: So I wouldn't call it really low amperage for that stuff. Its more that other controllers can handle more than 12s. That is the bigger constraint I think.

it WORK... but anytime you close the app, or shut down the vesc you have to do the following :

If you are used to, pressing the brake on stillstand to enter or leave the board.... you will get an nice surprice when the board start acccelerating backward :wink:

Also its possible on loose surface to brake so hard that the wheel short comes to stop and then start spinning backward... funny going 15mph forward with one wheel spinning backward ....

would your 6374 Motor alo have such strong regen-brake ? or is it because of the Leo ?

It is a little disappointing hearing about reverse actually. All the time Benjamin has spent "banging" on the vesc tool. Well in ackmaniacs bldc firmware you can program reverse like hobbywing where you have to double tap the brake but in addition you can program the speed for direction change so you cannot have one wheel spinning in reverse at 15mph (as easily.)

So I wonder if anything has changed in duty cycle from the previous version where there was no neutral. If you have a chance can you test this mode.

You can set the PCB to take 3.3V. Read the AMS PCB manual! Some smd soldering is required.
Set the VESC to supply 3.3V on the sensor port. This will reduce the noise and worked better when testing the AMS5047P.

just add some slots for the Encoder in the 1mm thick Stainless Lid...

It didnt worked out.... the space is so limited... not possible to adjust proberly

More room for mounting, no grease, better adjusting automaticly with motor....

@squad:
But the AS5047 is technically the better solution, especially for FOC. It enables the VESC to read the EXACT rotor position and to calculate the EXACT current value for every 0.1° of a revolution.

Switching from hall to encoder ist just about the same evolution as changing from BLDC to FOC.

It's not easy to adapt to an existing motorholder, but quite easy to incorporate into new future designs, where it sits on the side of the motor shaft, protected protected by the gearbox housing.

there is not much info on AS5047 setups and principles.
? could someone explain how it actually works. is there any magic in the round magnet that you add to the shaft ? (i guess its not just a magnet cause how would the sensor measure the postion then)

does the AS5047 sensor have to be super sturdy an axact positioned like @Nowind did it or could a 3d-printed holder also work (cause 3d printed ones might have some shaking and bending and so slightly position changing to it) 

does AS5047 work with 4...Vescs too ?

@squad;
Of course halls do fine in this application, I'm also running most of my boards with them. But that phase switching every 30° always gives a current spike which limits the power you can pull out of a VESC before it fries. With FOC+encoder the switching get much cleaner. This all is just important for low rpms. At higher rpms the VESC relies on its observer and runs sensorless, so you may only feel a difference when pulling high currents at low speeds.

@notger:
The AS5047 has internally 4 analog hall sensors which measure the direction of the diametric magnet and uses this to calculate the angular position. It has to be centered quite good above the magnet and should not move under operation.
A 3d printed housing would work fine and yes, the magnet can be glued to the shaft. The manual says it should not be connected to ferromagnetic material but it works nevertheless.

I tried also coasting backwards on a hill when I received the VESC 6 and like you I was astonished how smooth the VESC 6 managed to brake then go forward.

Not sure how metr.at calculates amps.
On Ackmaniac, motor and battery amps are multiplied by the number of motor (set in the settings tab).
Maybe you drew 110A. That case, I'm not dsappointed anymore. :slight_smile:

Yes, all the data is for the single VESC. @Nowind 55A is battery current (constant current flow), 119A is motor current (short pulses, that's why it's higher). I plan to collect data over CAN for both VESCs in the future, this is on my TODO list.

Crazy is the stored energy compared to size and wheight : 
Lipo :  545 wH with 3800 gram
18650 : 1056 wH with 4800 gram 
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Okay on the new pack they are missing the seriel connections and battery wires/plug and heatshrink

Actually have connected the parallel taps with my Sunko.... 5 taps a 7mm X 0.15mm... should be good for about 80A continiuos current maybe 100A .... hope that will be enough :fearful:

Could add more... but its really a boring work .... would like to prefer some screw terminals like seen on ebikes

"labeled", but, if I remember correctly, testing showed they should have been rated closer to 15A.
...or did you mean 80-100A... per motor :)?

For  7mm X 0.15mm, I think the rule of thumb is ~7A per strip (but closer to 5a being ideal):

I have quite some Experience with the sony VTC series, they are used in Makita Packs too.
the Problem with rising AmpHours was rising Heatproduction.
So on the Specs of teh VTC6 its 15A without BMS and Heat-control everything above heat should be monitored. Same for VTC5
here is some really good test of the VTC6
[http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Sony%20US18650VTC6%203000mAh%20%28Green%29%20UK.html](http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Sony%20US18650VTC6%203000mAh%20%28Green%29%20UK.html)
you see that with 20A and 30A the VTC6 never reaches the maximum dicharge Ah cause of overheating above 80°C

VTC5A acts alittle different (less heat production) and VTC4 really takes 40Amps easily wihout crazy heat production

So Jenso please be gentle on them in the beginning or monitor the heat of the Pack. otherwise it could happen that you harm the cells.
But you have to test it in real world, the Problem with YOU is that you are probably very similar to those discharge tests above High-Amps and that continiously without cooldown breaks inbetween ;-)

I even feels the difference with my Mykita Power tools, the VTC4Packs take tons of big wood-screws without problems the VTC6 Pack needs a few rests to cool down (controlled by the internal Pack-BMS, it just cuts out)

Thanks for the input.
Okay lets take the 15A @8P for 120A cont.
Thats more then enough, you will not pull this continiuos, no way IMO...
Ant take this super low 5-7A per 7x0.15 and lets double it just for now.... so 10A per layer dividet through 120A is 12 layers ... WTF 
If we calculate with the 5A its 24 layer.. :smile:

Adding copper is maybe better solution....

I think one 7mm X 0.15mm nickelstrip for the parallel connections would also be sufficient. The current should flow through the series connections and not between the individual cells on the same voltage level. Did I oversee something? Because I see a lot of 18650 builds using also thick connections between the parallel cells and from my electrical point of view that is not useful at all, because the currents should be low between parallel cells. Just little balancing currents flowing. 
The thickness is important for the series connection, because all the current is flowing through these connections and the cells.
When the 5-7A are a valid value (haven't checked that) I would calculate for a 120A continuous battery like this:
Max battery current for example 160A (the +40A just as a safety margin. Adjust that so your current spikes are under this max limit)
That means 160A/8(number of parallel cells)=20A through every individual 18650 cell.
20A/5A(current one stripe could handle from the infos posted above)=4.
So that would result to 4 layered stripes between each cell in the series connection. (Maybe crossing would be a good idea also, but it looks like your cell holders could be a problem there)

I hope you get from the picture what I mean. 

I haven't build such a battery myself so all thoughts are just based on theory. Maybe someone with battery building experience can confirm that or tell me where I am wrong.

Holy sh*t. 30mm² is bigger than an AWG3 wire. You definitely don't need that for parallel connections.... :joy: What is your plan on how to connect the copper with your battery? In my imagination that copper would suck the heat that bad when soldering, that your 18650er would already be dad before the pack is ready.

keep in mind that your battery will just very rarely truly see the max per cell current. the calculations on the ES forum were meant for continuous current in a strip.

I really think I have been among the first to reinforce serial connections because of that post, but in the end so many batteries with just a single nickel strip still work. why? because for normal riders under normal conditions your board usually pulls around 200watt, which is just 5-10A on a 10S battery.

I ended up with a simple rule of thumb: one pure nickel 10x0.15mm layer per "P". its gives you some headroom for accelerating/braking a lot, but is definitely over engineered for the majority of riding time. the upside of stacked nickel layers: you get a structurally very stable battery.

sounds like your backlash is set too tight MrRobot (@gogomrrobot) 
The gears should not be pushed tightly together
There needs to be a small amount of play for proper meshing of the gears

Try setting them a bit looser, if you hold the motor you need to get a small amount of play at the wheel. Do you get what I mean? At the spur gears it might be a fraction of a mm, but at the increased diameter of the wheel it will be seen as mm's of movement.

edit: your motor wires not being connected, make sure they are not touching ;)

OK... let me try that. I did what was in the instructions... folded a piece of paper in half, put it between the gears and pushed them close as possible before tightening the motor spur.

EDIT: the wires aren't touching wrapped in electric tape until the vescs are installed. Let me try the gears more apart

I would ask what gsm was the paper? Was it snug or tight before the paper was removed? Did you use a lubricant? But if you have followed Jenso's instructions might be best we wait for him ;)

It was just a standard piece of printer paper... 75 gsm the label says. They don't have that 'Total Power Grease' in the US that he uses. I tried Amazon but it's impossible to get.

I used White Lithium Grease. Yes i want to hear what Jenso says. Maybe there is a little back pressure from thr gears that's normal?

I want to see another set of wheels like mine spin... do they spin faster or about the same. Mine went around about 4 times on a spin. Lol i know this isn't very scientific but i don't know how else to compare.

Yap its easy with the papertrick but you will be still able to push the gears to close eachother... you need for sure some backlash as @Cobber said.... no problem with a bit more.... better then none

Edit
Checked your video.... you need more distance for sure!!! I would say you got absolutely no backlash actually....

Haha unicorn tears must taste bloody beautiful! I gotta say I'm loving my MBS F5 bindings but just feel like I need a bit more. The problem for me is when you edge hard your heel lifts so you loose your ability to dig in - obviously on a snowboard the board contorts and the heel stays on the board to help you push that edge away. You almost need the calf brace that a SB binding has to help you stay in control. 

It's funny, mountainboarding has been around for a while now - you'd think those guys would have the same issues? Maybe being able to accelerate at different points (like around corners) adds a new dynamic? Or maybe I'm just a shit mountainboarder :joy:

Aha! Yeah I've tried the Motos out - a really good boot for the money! They weren't stiff enough for my snowboard but would be great for an emtb. Be really interested to know how you get on. My current snowboard boots are way too bulky and they felt ridiculous on my emtb so might have to keep an eye out for a slimmer pair. My Vans Sk8 will have to do in the meantime - zero padding though!

That Snowboard Stuff really nice, still 
-> Wintertime is snowboarding Time
-> Summertime is E-Mtb Time

i personally do not want to ride around with -20Boots with +40°C in High Summer.

So i Guess a Good Solution is still some Nice Rigid - Mountain-Hicking-Boot + some Binding Updates

My personal Combination is the Following
MBS F5 Binding
plus the Flame Hell Strap wich ist about twice as Big as the Trampa Heel Strap
or also the MBS F5 Heels Strap are Quite good and big compared to little Trampas
Updateing that is really different Driving compared to the Trampa Bindings.

@trampa You could/should look into some more stable Binding Option like the Flame or MBS Bindings/HeelStraps in my Opinion, Those freaking e-Mtb Riders are getting more and more, and we need quite some Stability

Yeah I gotta agree - Trampa make AMAZING boards, but the straps, whilst they would probably last 100x longer than the MBS padded ones, do lack comfort and stability.  I guess there's a bit of trade off there.  I own the F5 toe straps but use Trampa heels - I'll likely grab the F5 healstraps too to complete the combo...

Try the Flame Heels-Straps, the are quite stiff/rigid, so you get even more Heels support that with the Padded F5 MBS Heel-Straps,
..... the Flame Straps are actually the cheapes, but best Heel straps i know until now (! only downside is that they come without Ratchet but all other Ratchets Trampa/MBS are compatible to the Flames)

[APS website](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/c80100-bldc-motor-150kv-7000w/) shows a 150kv motor rated to 18s and 7000w,
rpm = watts so less rpm will equal less watts but huge torque, but maybe Jenso has a diff kv with a diff. rating, so it comes down to the two, one being his volts.

https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-80100-130KV-DC-brushless-motor_60366808170.html

Would a higher KV really make that much of a difference in supported voltage? Other factor could be higher temp magnets + copper.

I think APS let's them produce by "Freerchobby" a Chinese Motor Factory
[https://frchobby.en.alibaba.com/?spm=a2700.8443308.0.0.61m3J6](https://frchobby.en.alibaba.com/?spm=a2700.8443308.0.0.61m3J6)

I did order several custom Motors from them for e-bike builts.
You can order Custom KV and also Custom Motor-length exmpl 80100 = 80mm Diameter ~100mm length,   
i ordered a custom Hallsensored 100KV 8070 (was ~90mm length at the end 80100 is ~110mm in real, so be careful there)  
Freerchobby finnished and shipped them within 2 weeks and they look absolutely similar to APS-Motors just without the Alien pinted on the Motors.

I think for Dual MTB two 8085 would be totally enough even 8060 if that is possible, and we might not get troubles with the space inbetween the motor-Mounts

I Usa a custom sensored 6374 135KV also from Freerchobby (similar but not the same as sk3).
Sure my setup just has a endspeed of 35km/h, but enormous Torque at low RPM (i do not have comparission to Leos, but i would not know why i would need more torque), 
ans 35km/h is plenty enough for the Alpine-Single-Trails i ride here in Austria.

...So i guess your assumption is right the 192KV Motors might be Lame at low RPMS

KV is always just depending on your Gearing, BatteryVolts and aimed Top-Speed.
So this can be not really get standardiced. I guess Jenso is using something between 150 and 190 KV

Wealth of information. Dang, at times it is hard to figure out where stuff actually comes from.
I have the SK3 149KV, but currently only have it set to 25A max battery per motor. Looking forward to trying it at 50 once I have received new lipos.

If that does not get me up the hills around here I have to order something bigger. Looking forward to your experience Nowind.

P.S. I believe you can still save that Leopard with the right kind of glue. ASI HP 4000 for example.

Like i said,.. i use two APS/Freerchobby 6374 130KV in the Alps (I guess compareable to sk3)
Now in Autum i can climb any steep Hill (possible traction-wise) without getting the Motors to their limit or to more than "Handwarm". (Haven't had or tried them in Summertime)

But to be honest I'm satisfied with 2 X 2000Watts (Focbox/EtoxxDirectrive5:1/Trampa9"Wheels)

Thats why i think 8085 (95mm in Real-length)  or even smaller are more than enough for ? maybe 2 X >4KW, (But isn't that just crazy and worthless ?)

Sure, true that,...I mean the Motor KV you are choosing is dependent on Gearing-Wheeldiameter-Voltage-Motorefficiency and the aimed Top-Speed.
In my expereinces Reality was Minus 15-20% of the Perfect "Mathematically" calculated Top Speed (Trough all Power losses by Motor, Drag,......)

Bindings are a very big point of happy riding and board control for sure.
I personally need at least some highback boots for ankle support... tryed differnt shoes/bindings/straps... now the Moto18 Boots... not easy to find the point where you get enough suppot and control without getting to restricted....

The 80100 is 130kv, i´m running 12S on 9Inch wheels...its calculated at 30mph / 50kmh...

Will be using the Vesc6 yes, as @BigBoyToys mentioned the way back to RC controllers is not really possible... its true that the motor could take alot more amps but hey i guess it will be strong enough...

Was really happy with the Leopards, but its damaged.. and i saw on Dereks APS8072 that the copper fillment is lower then on the Leopard so i go with 80100... btw i got the wider truck that suit the 100mm length ... just will cut the extendet rear shaft of course

Its just for fun, frustrated kids needs overpriced toys :joy:

Oh so you are using a custom hangar to fit the dual 80100? 

Is the nothing less than 5” a clearance issue or just a trampa hub compatibility issue? Seems like if so you could make an adapter to mount a 107mm :o

Also I just realized the APS motors are loosing what looks to be 20mm because of the adapters. Looks like the 80100 could fit on the regular MTB hangar if the DD housing bolt hole pattern could be changes to accept 80mm mounting

Ähm, sorry but i tink you missunderstand that.

what i read is that jenso does not use 80100APS he uses 8072APS
and he speakt about the standard MTB Hangers wich will fit the 8072 no custom longer hnagers.

inbetwenn my Dual Direct Drive (MTB not Mini) there is 230mm,.... so minus ~15mm for Mounting adapter ther is maximum 200mm=2X100mm Space inbetween it might tightly fit two 80100 but without encoder and just if APS 80100 means real 100mm (like i told in my experience 100, 80, 74,....is just a rough naming for the actual real Motorlength, not the real length in mm expl. sk3 6374 is more like 82mm in real)

so @Ackmaniac is 8072 real 72mm Motor length ?

APS 80mm motor's come in 8085 amd 80100 sizes. The leopards are the 8072's. The 80mm motors require an adaptor plate to mate them with the direct drive system due to the difference in the bolt pattern of the 63 vs 80mm bolt pattern.  The adaptor plate Takes up some space which is why the 80100's wont fit. I believe he is using a longer hanger to make it work.

Are you already riding 63mm Dual MTB setup ?
Cause the difference might be hard to describe if you have no reference.

like i told i use 2X ~135KV 6374 Motors and I'm totally happy in the Austrian Alps.
If i push those motors to 2X 2,5KW i cannot stand the Acceleration without adjusting the throttle curve.
Otherwise the Board would just overtake/pass my Body.
You should take in Count, the bigger motor the more Watts the more torque the less Distance you can go with your batteries.

But dont take me wrong, you might ge a torque freak like Jenso that there is no way around bigger Motors.

Thanks Bro.
Yeah i think its still a compromise but with the given circumstances of a top located spring adjuster its the best i thought about... no drilling, passive cooling, modular design : 

Middle Part,POM, 21mm height, 2 cable entrys on long, 1 on short side

Upper Part , POM, 10mm extra inner height,

Will not call it waterproof in no case! But maybe splashproof

The Middle Part gets mountet first with 2 screws from bottom, so its stay in place if you take away the upper LID :

@Nowind   From here it looks like the steering-Damper could hit the motor ? But I'm sure you made sure this will not happen, still does it actually give you more steering radius in the end  ?

Do i see it right you use Spring without Dampers inside now ?

I'm relly curious how the steering Dampers perform.

This Things comes to "Perfectness" in my opinion.
The only thing i still would change are the "stick-catching-loops" created by teh phase and hall-wires.

It happened several Times to me (when i was riding really offroar cross-country trough the woods)  that those loops cought a Stick. My hall Wires ripped several Times until i left them and go sensoreless for now.

I was Thinking about turning my Motors 90 degrees milling around abit and guiding the Wires along the Hanger,

It dont hit the Motor, tight as **** but it free moving until full tilt
Yap i would say you get more steering because their is no dampa anymore.
So yes only springs actually.

First ride was nice, of course you have to play with settings and get on with it.
No Dampas and the extendet Hanger is really agressive BUT its so NICE that you can now try to find the best compromise of steering and stability with one click... okay about 20 clicks on each damper :heart_eyes:

You are absolutely right about the loops of wires.
I dont like it and it should be improved ... TRUE

I think the 90degree option dont work out for me because of a lack of space between motor and hanger.
But if the wires are all long enough it should be possible to manage them better.

Haha no nothing calculated :innocent: i even not know how to :laughing:
still designing in 2D... oldschool :smirk:

Just addet some pockets where it was possible, for me it looks not that bad balanced... 

have to say that this design is from beginning a compromise : 
Because it fits to the boltpattern thats in the standart direct drive wheelspur, and this is a 5-star design from the superstar hub... now with 6-star of CRYPTIC and HYPA and 3-star from PRIMO it gets complicated...

Also you loose the nice feature to change the inflated tire with attached Hubadapter, because the 6-spoke will not allow the full access to 5-star screws :confounded:

Best in real function is to go with one pattern.... but actually i want this 9inch stuff and this dont work with the Superstar unfortunaly... 
So for perfect design i have to change the Bolting circle on the wheelspur also...

We could share the costs. I buy him without bindings and board for 2 weeks to finish my MTB and for cruising around. After that I can send him with bindings and board overseas. I'm afraid the shipping costs by air would be too expensive, maybe send him by boat?

Also isnt it better to make a L shape bracket and attach the the truck screws on the deck rather than drilling holes in the truck?

Not that easy to answer.
In generell i like it but it will not take away all unstable/speedwobbling from the board.
Not sure what comes from the extendet spurwidth, i think its less stable as with regular trucks.
Without Dampas the Springs can jump out of position.
You can really lock the truck in seconds or have it loose like without dampas... but in the end you have to find a good setting with all this adjustable parameters...

@okp
thanks Bro
Its really a beast, you can do wheelies from standstill !
Biggest Problem is to gain some grip, the wheels are start to spin so fast... 
Thinking of bigger wheels actually

@benjammin
thanks Bro
you really have to try a sensored setup with loads of torque like this... awesome  
See above for my first thoughts on the damper

Thanks

I'm working on a HS11 deck with Ultimate hangers but I don't want to use bindings or foot straps do I needed to soften steering to be able to make close turns. My idea was to use inside holes for the springs such as in the mini Vertigo trucks but is impossible to do it on the ultimate hanger, there's no way to drill inner position springs. 

Is there a solution you could suggest?, you seem to have an answer for every challenge about building eboards! 😁

I could imagine that it will be okay with outer position. On the Mini Trucks @ my Street Carver i prefer the inner position in the front, BUT you have the longer Trucks which will add more steering force, thats my expierence with the extendet Mtb Trucks i use here in this build. 
AND they could be a simple solution for your problem, not sure if it really workout because it could be hard to insert both spring at the same time but think about : 
Some kind of a Adapterplate about 6mm thick , with 2 countersunked holes in the inner position and two threadet holes in the outer position, so you could mount it with outer screws but use inner position ?!?
It will only add 6mm compresion to the springs...

Your videos are always mesmerizing!

I guess you've decreased the spring tension in order to reduce steering pressure and adjusted the steering damper to avoid wobbles, so do you feel more comfortable now with the steering damper with loose trucks at high speeds does it turns easier than an ultimate with no damper? 

If I add the a 6mm plate to the hanger the spring will definitely be super tight, 6mm is a lot, on those springs, how about making a supporting plate with the truck shape to fill the holes where the inner spring retainer will be, bolted by the sides? I'll test the outter position first, maybe inner position won't be needed.

I accept your offer to buy the lipo checker, just let me know the price to ship it to Miami Florida and I'll send you a paypal payment. I really appreciate the gesture!

If you are not going totally crazy, the hanger will survive.

What kind of wheels will you ride? Pneumatics create little Vibrations, while street wheels on rough roads might be problematic. 
You could also make an adaptor plate from 5mm aluminium (as Jens suggested), since the springs need pre-tension anyway. Assembly is still possible, using a clamp to lean the baseplate.

Personally I would prefer the adaptor plate.

At least in German Language there are dozends of Forums about that Topic.
Pretty sure same for English speaking Persons.

A Friend of mine recently built a cnc-mill. His mill was around 5K materials and is (rarely) able to mill big solid aluminium Parts but at the End it was a 10+K machine cause it took nearly all the leisure Time of his last two years to build this thing. And at the End its still a Hobby-mill and not a Professional 10+K Mill.

I stick to my good old Emcomat 8.6 Mill from the 70's cause adding CNC'ing into my list of Hobbys would not let any Time left for Family.

Hey Dude,

haha yeah thanks always great fun...
you will be not surprised but i already tested some 10Inch wheels ...
but i getted big problems with unbalanced wobbling,
heavy as hell
in the end they dont hold up... maybe the hub was to small or the Tirepressure not enough
anyway they just turned off the valve ... hahaha

I got a video, need to upload it

The tyres I’ve got don’t have much of a smell, the hubs are off a old 800w brushed Chinese board. Shouldn’t be to hard to make them fit, just extended axels and a drive adapter... heavy tho

Hi, I have a Trampa with 136Kv motors, 6200 mah 40C 6S zippy (4 of them, two per motor, so 12S).  What settings would you recommend for motor max current and battery max current.  Also, where did you get your two bags that you have your batteries in.  And finally, where did you get the case for your VESC6's?  I wished I saw the direct drive before buying the trampa belt drive!

I think its thick heat shrink rubber and heavy duty velcro around the batteries but i aint sure, the vesc6 case is available here.

Hey Nowind,

Can you give us an update on the complete parts list?

I'm looking to do the exact similar setup minus the damper and wider trucks.

Thank you, your setup is my dream!

When I first reached 50 in my trampa, i thougt  "this is too much", and it is hard to control.. after a couple of months I needed more speed, made some mods and reached the same feeling again, now i'm using motocross protection but my limit is how much I want to spend and my wife... I agree with @Nate good balanced wheels, a holypro and the right dampass i still feel it can go faster.
