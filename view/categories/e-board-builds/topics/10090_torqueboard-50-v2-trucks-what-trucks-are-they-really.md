I am trying to upgrade my bushings and pivot cups. I bought some amazing riptide bushings. Went with wfb boardside and aps roadside. Let me say no speed wobbles and way better carving and tighter turning radius. Better overall control....This matters. Anyway I bought caliber II pivot cups and they do not fit. Can someone inform me what cups will fit,  maybe @torqueboards. I want them from riptide and they have a wide choice of molds.

Can you give me the dimensions of the pivot that came out of the Torqueboard 50 degree V2 trucks?  I am the President of RipTide.  I just joined the froum, sorry for the late reply.

The trucks are very very similar to caliber 2 50s.

Welcome to the forum, please enlighten us on some better bushing/pivot combos for esk8!

Thanks, when you say they do not fit, can you explain?

Awesome! Welcome, brutha! :v: I love RIptide stuff!! I use the Krank bushings and WFB pivot cups. The WFB pivots are an absolute MUST HAVE on all boards. IMO

I'm pretty sure the TB trucks are Caliber clones. 
I may be off. What's the word, Dex?  @torqueboards

We make two different sizes for Caliber RKP trucks, Caliber I and Caliber II.  Caliber II is slightly shorter than Caliber I.  If someone could provide the OD, ID depth and length of the Stock pivots, I can tell you what should work.

This is wrong information about torqueboards being caliber clones. They won't even fit two barrels on them without binding and they were still better than stock bushings. Best thing I did was get aps and wfb barrels and put them on Caliber II trucks after they did not fit proper on torqueboards. Dexter could not give me a definite answer what was up. So this is my suggestion to you. I would ask dexter to send you some trucks so you can check the bushing fit and pivot cup fit. I'm sure he would do that....

Caliber II wfb pivot cups did not fit torqueboard trucks fyi....they were too long and too tight diameter wise

The hangers are simply Caliber style hangers. Pivot cups might be different.
I'll send riptide a truck to test fitment.

Exactly...they look like caliber but dimensions are significantly different. I think it's a great idea to send them your trucks to test fitment for bushings and cups. Especially since there are many types of bushings. You could just measure the cups that came out of the truck but the bushing would be another story. It's a decent truck and would be better if you had these options....

Awesome, I hope you test bushing fitment as this turned out to be more crucial than the cups....

No worries, dude! We are talking with the president of Riptide. If anyone know his stuff...He's the guy. This is exciting news. Riptide rocks!!

I received the truck from Dexter and I will tear into it tomorrow to see what I find.  Thanks for the truck torqueboards, I will be gentle with it and get it back to you this weekend!  I would have gotten to this earlier but I have been swamped, sorry!

OK, here is what I found about the Torqueboard 50 degree V2 trucks and what RipTide fits where for upgrade purposes.  The pivot cup that fits is our Indy 96a WFB pivot.  It is dimensionally very close to the stock pivot and goes into the base plate a little easier than we like to see but it is tighter on the hanger pivot nose so it does make for a functionally good tight fit when assembled.  As for bushings, the trucks will accept our standard longboard bushings both boardside and roadside.  The hanger will take the following shapes that we make:  Cone, Barrel, Canon, and FatCone.  The tightest fit in the hanger is the Canon bushing which is slightly larger diameter than our Barrel.  Additionally, the king pin length does not leave much room so you may elect to not use a boardside bushing at all when using two .6" tall bushings or you can run our Street series bushings in the roadside position since they are .5" tall compared to the longboard series which is .6" tall



Attached is a picture with our Indy Pivot cup installed:  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/47bbfd35dd9f01615cc4ccf624490a33cdb27f3a.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Good morning Dexter, do I send the truck back to the address it came from?  I will send you a pair of our Indy Pivots with the trucks as a thank you!

@Alphamail - Awesome! Thanks for the info. I'll pass it on :slight_smile:

 Yeah, sure. You can send it back if you like. No biggie though :)

 I have an important update regarding Torqueboard 180mm 50 degree V2 trucks.  There appears to be two different versions of these trucks out there and the V2 I received above has changed without an official announcement of what might be called V3.  **The pivot cup hole in the V2 is around .630 or just over 16mm, the V3 version as about .700" or 17.8mm.**

**V2 pivot cup is our Indy**
**V3, we do not have a pivot cup to fit this**

**Please do not order unless you can confirm with calipers the diameter of the hole in your base plate!!!**
