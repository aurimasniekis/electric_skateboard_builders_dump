Hey guys, 

this'll be my 2nd build. I was close to doing the finishing touches on my Vanguard build(check out my other thread). I stopped midway because I fell in love with the Icarus Deck :blush:
The Vanguard will be on the back burner. Most of the stuff will be transferred to this build.
 
**Build:**

**Deck**: Loaded Icarus Flex 1 - THIS THING IS BEATIFUL :heart_eyes:
**ESC**: VESC 4.12
**Motor(s)**: Single 6374 190kV - will eventually update to dual motors.
**Trucks:** Caliber II 50°
**Wheels**: Orangatang 80A
**Battery**: 10S4P 25R Samsung 
**Enclosure**: Custom designed 3D Printed (PETG)
**Remote**: GT2B Sparkle Mod

Everything is there except the VESC which is still undergoing repair and I'll have to design a new enclosure for it.

I can only compare the deck to my Vanguard Flex 2. Flex is not too much different. I can see the Flex 2 would be much bouncier and more fun to carve. But I opted for the Flex 1 since it'll be easier to build an enclosure for it. 



----------


I will keep this top post updated: 

**16.05.17**: Deck arrived, test ride, measurements & comparison

This is how I've solved the top mounting part. There was not enough clearance for the motor when going drop through. I've top mounted the trucks and made myself an "shock" pad to even out the stress on the holes and the thin walls.

Comparision between the Vanguard & Icarus. I also put the finished Vanguard enclosures on the Icarus. As you can see they would fit. But the design is so inefficient in terms of space usage. 
I've made a new one from scratch which will give me more space between both enclosures.

New enclosure design - 4x M5 screws holding it down. Its splitted in 2 parts to handle the flex. There will be a foam mat underneath to give protection to the electronics and to tighten down the enclosure onto the mat. This design sits just right up to the baseplate of the trucks.

**18.05.2017:** I nailed down the enclosure design. First half is printed. Used the heatgun to adjust it to the concave :) I designed it not to sit on the wheel flares as it is impossible to align the shape of the enclosure to those sexy curves. As you can see I made 2 slits to get the cable through. I don't want to route wire channels into this deck. I want to be as less invasive as possible haha...
I'll use glass fiber spatula on the inside to reinforce it. Afterwards it'll be sanded and spray painted.

From the drawing board to printing :) Aligns nicely to the concave.

FAIL ! I had this part on the printer for 7 hours and then just noticed that it was the wrong model.

@keegancdr
I'll have them on thingiverse without logo up tomorrow :) Curious how your method will turn out !

Other half is done. Whats left is to glass fiber reinforce it and sand it. I cut out the mat and it looks pretty neat.

Sad news is that I think it'll be impossible to have that much free space underneath... The bottom space is just too small to fit 10s4p comfortably. I guess it'd work out if I have the motor(s) face to the rear Ala evolve style. But that would eliminate the kick tails existence...

She'll be running for the first time soon ! :heart_eyes: 

This is still just about halfway done ! I've just used screws I had lying around for mounting the enclosure so I can give her a maidens ride. :blush:  I have ordered some decent screws and washers(rosettes). Credits to @whitepony. 

Also tried @High-roller's idea to include an air scoop in the enclosure. :wink: 

I am actually redoing the enclosures at the moment. 
Its all trial and error ! I've gone through several spools and enclosures until now... :triumph:

A quick notice I can give everyone who wants to 3d design and print their own enclosures is that you shouldn't add screw holes at all. You will never get them to fit spot on. Rather do sth like this. Use decent washers to not put too much strain on the screw hole points.

As you can see the space between both enclosures is not that wide. 40cells are really hard to fit under this deck.. The flex shouldn't be affected because I used a 4mm foam mat underneath the enclosures and will use rubber washers. I'll find out when riding. There was no problem with me jumping on it.

Okay might need help here :wave:

I keep losing connection. Or its rather the VESC keeps rebooting. When testing BLDC on the bench it does just fine. When driving and having weight on the board whenever I hit the throttle a bit it just stops the connection. I get a weird crack sound from the motor. 

On FOC I can set up everything but when doing full acceleration on the bench I get these weird cracking noises from the motor. I think it might be a short in the motor. Anyone have a clue ?

I don't think there is anything wrong with it. I just ordered another motor to rule this one out. I redid cables and everything the last time so I don't think it could be loose cables. :/

your Batt max is way to high for a 10S4P 25R, 

Batt max: 25 to 30A
Batt min: -20 to -15A

I thought I'd try doing FOC. The motor cracking still remains. Whenever I accelerate and it makes the cracking noise I get the fault code ABS_OVER_CURRENT. I guess it really is a short ? Weirdly it doesn't behave that way when I use BLDC.

[/quote]

I appologize, didn't want to start a controversy. 

On a new build i would always recommend lower values... hell it's new, give it a chance. Up the values if needed.

The abs over current can occur with bad sensors, does this happen when running unsensored?

Hey man :) No biggie. I've used the same setup on the other build with the same batt max. Worked just fine. 

I've tried FOC uncensored now and when accelerating I still get the crackling noise and motor jiggering. Then I get the over current code. It just happens when I push the trigger past an specific point.

Update due :) ....

Board is finished as for now. Enclosure done, screws blackened.
The board is running in FOC, with the FOCBOX its running without problems for the last couple weeks. I'm quite pleased of how the board is running. Its super carvy and has enough power for any hills. I've found the perfect bushings setup for my weight :smile: 
The 6374 is enough for any hills here. 

I've added the vesc port on the enclosure. And its just super neat to just plug it in during the ride to change settings or read the fault codes.

I'll leave the board as it is for now. This build will get continued once I get my hands on some Carbon V3's :blush:

@BenTheBarre
Doesn't affect it at all. And if it does you can't tell :smile: It still has that super carvy feeling :blush:
I would say that the flex 2 is way too bouncy to electrify. 

I'll upload the final files for the enclosures later this week.

Time for a little update :) I swapped the wheels out for ABEC11 90mm 75a and damn ! What a difference ! I've ridden them for about 50km now and these are fu*king smooth :blush:. 
The board has a really nice overall flexy carvy feeling. I've ridden a CarbonGT and another stiff DIY board. I can't wrap my head around why people go for stiff boards :/ ... 

Anyway, whats next is to update this beast to dual drive. A single 6374 is more than enough to get me everywhere with decent speed and torque and I get all hills in this area but I'll start an internship later this year and the work way is just perfect for riding an eBoard.

1. I'll update my enclosure to fit a 10s4p in the front and have space for a dual vesc and dual 6355 in the back. Might take away the sleek look since it'll add 2cm on the front enclosure.

2. Get Carvon V3/V4 and keep the enclosure style. Change the back one to fit dual vesc since there is more space because there is no motor in the way. I think the Carvon V3/V4 are the epitome of DIY building :heart_eyes: 

Going the first route will save me some money but damn... That direct drive approach is looking so sleek...

and do you think that if i do you enclosure can i fit lipo batteries? where i live buying lion is waaaay more expensive i think like 3x what you guys pay (because of the shipping i live in chile) so that becausee i`m going with lipo a configuration of 10s1p (5x 2s1p 5Ah) each is 19mm thick.... do you think that i could manage with your enclouser?

With 90mm wheel do you think there is some wheelbite risks ?

Are you able to share your 3D print model of the riserpad for Icarus ?

it has stronger concave, less camber, somehwat of flares towards the wheels and its a drop through. the flex doesnt feel as natural as the vanguards flex because of the stronger concave (gives a weird ef. shorter wheelbase too, feels amore agile than the vanguard. weird hybrid overall - mold/ features of a downhill board with a lot of flex and drop through ;p
