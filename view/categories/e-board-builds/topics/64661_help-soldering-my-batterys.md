hello, im soldering right now, is my first time soldering, i saw a lot videos... but do is more hard than watch. this is my first cells, and i think is a shit... i don't know if i will have problems... or you thing is good. if the wire was less thickness it should be more easy soldering

Be sure to scuff/scratch up the nikel strip where you want to solder

Use Flux

Pretin both the wires and the now scuffed up nickel strip

Put dab of solder on soldering iron

Marry the pre tinned nickel strip and wire

Make sure you get good solder "flow" between them




What kind of soldering Iron are you using?

Those tabs will definitely bottleneck your performance. 
What thickness are those tabs? Are they pure nickle? How much power are you planning on delivering?
Also, use more insulation on your cells since their plastic coverings are very thin and the tabs may easily cut into them shorting your connection.

So you bought the strips separately?

This thread is giving me some serious red flags about this build. You should not be having to solder every single tab, the cells should be spot welded to eachother. So two cells should share one tab.

The current construction seems very very weak. Vibrations are likely going to break those tabs eventually as the cells are not securely held together and the wires will be able to shake around. I'm concerned that it won't be safe.

This construction method is also taking a lot more effort than necessary and is making the pack significantly larger than it needs to be.

You are taking a huge risk RIGHT NOW just by having those cells where they are.

![jpeg_1534100537952|690x377](upload://a0aluMMTt0q9yMBIqeUlYE5eqGM.jpeg)

The part I have circled has ZERO insulation between the wires and if the slightest bump occurs and those touch you're going to spark the hell out of it and possibly start a fire if it welds and you aren't able to pull everything apart because it gets too hot.

You need to disassemble this VERY carefully before you set things on fire. This is urgent.

No, it doesn't matter if this was just for a picture. That never should have happened. This is reckless and I highly recommend you do more research into how 18650 packs are constructed and kept safe. You do NOT want thermal runaway when things start to go wrong.

There‚Äôs nothing like a big lithium spark/short to jolt some caution into your work. I made all the mistakes when I rushed into my first battery build and it‚Äôs made me extra careful when going forward. It would be good practice to wrap exposed wire tips with electrical tape when they aren‚Äôt going to be worked with for a while. Theres a lot of unexpected things that can go wrong when your building these batteries.

Man that looks crazy.
You definitely need to take care when you take the cells out of the tray again. If you short something you need to be fast to get the cells away from each other, if not you will have a lot of smoke in your room...
Use more isolation, like fish paper on the cells and on the + pole.
Get a spotwelder with 60-100watt plus all the things the other guys recommend

@pedro when you purchased from nkon you chose the battery with tab option, you would have been much better off buying strips and welding them yourself but that's obviously hindsight now. I think you're going to need another nickle strip to double this up but I'll leave that advice to the more experienced builders.

Please do not ride this, it's not safe. You could burn your house down 

Use fish paper between packs, between balance wires and cells, isolate the soldered leads, add more n√≠quel between cells, use fish paper rings on positive terminals.

If you want to go with those nickel strips without getting a spot welder, I would suggest getting these (or similar)

I think with it you want to ask about what @TowerCrisis suggested.
The question still is, you spotweldet the nickel strips by your own or ordered them from nkon with that strips?
If you have a spoweder than you could make a pack without soldering.
I guess you don‚Äôt have so in this case please take the time and look through the links which @Sebike shared. That concept should work for you also easily.
In fact it‚Äôs an easy thing. 
Get fishpaper
Get fishpaper rings for the + terminals 
Add the rings to the positive terminal 
Add the fishpaper on one side of your pack
Solder the nickel strips you already have on a copper bar or layer of nickel and bend it over the edges so that it lays on the fishpaper your added before( make that on both sides)....well done one p pack is done...make all p packs like this than connect them and add your balance leads.
To get a nice finish, put you packs in heat shrink or cover the open parts with electric tape...better more isolation than less‚òùÔ∏è
If you install the pack, try somehow to fix it with velcron or neoprene. The less vibration the better for your batteries and the longer your solder joint will last.

If this really is your first time soldering, a diy battery pack is probably the worst first project you could have chosen.

Please secure your battery, put it in a safe place, and do some more research/soldering practice before you try again. Right now you are literally playing with fire. Every picture is giving me anxiety.

Exactly, do more practice soldering and gain a little more experience before you burn your house down. I really don't like the joints, not only because they are soldered badly but also because they have sharp edges which need to be protected not penetrating into the cells.

When I build my pack 12s4p, I welded 4 cells in parallel together in one strip and I quick soldered the bridge between cells onto a 10 awg wire If that helps

Somewhere along the line you're gonna solder on tabs that connection to a cell.

Bottom line is your trying to save money in a task where you can‚Äôt cut corners. Just spend a little extra and get the spot welder or buy a prebuilt battery. You may lose a little money in the learning process but it‚Äôs far better than loosing your entire build or home. Look at some of the shit that has happened when batteries go wrong and scare some sense into yourself.

And then read some battery build threads. Please.

If you can't see the difference between what you're doing and what other builders are doing then just throw all of it in a steel can and set it on fire already.

Yeh if i were u @pedro I would isolate / wrap every part of battery to avoid any shorts..

Also these long strips doesnt look good at all, cut all corners u can and probably glue everything in place, if u really plan on riding with this battery.

The vibrations and road impacts are immerse. If u wont protect your pack (also extra padding material in between / around cells) it wont turn out well.. it might either short or just disconnect during a ride.

U could have soldered a bit differently. Making a '>' shape of nickel on top of cell, then folding it flat afterwards and glue or solder in place.

Also 14awg wire would have been easier to solder than 12awg, basically u need fat wire for serial connections and smaller wire can be used on parallel ones (unless current goes through them anyway)

Vibration is really a much bigger issue then people think. Any tiny movement can crack metal or wear through insulations.

At that time I thought my batteries were well built however I missed so many things, I didn't use fish paper between P-groups, additional fish paper on positive terminals, didn't secured my batteries to the enclosure with heavy-duty double sided tape, used only one layer of 0.15mm nickel, strip, used a bad nickel strip material which rusted over time, didn't used kapton, didn't use enough isolation on bare wires, used a bad technique to build flexible batteries, lack of isolation on charging port, used bullet connectors instad of XT connectrors, so many things I do now and after all this gained knowledge the risk of fire is still be there.

I'm not runing any bms on my Pho3nix, I'll install a Bestech d122 for charging as soon as I receive it. 

Here's how you should wire the BMS using my improoved technique

That strip is 25mm wide and your cells are only 18mm wide.

if stacking 2 layers of cells and using one strip on both layers, 25mm would work with no cutting. @longhairedboy  did it if I recall correctly

And always check the nickel from AliExpress by put them into salt water and look if they become rusty after one day.
They write it‚Äôs 99% nickel but often it‚Äôs not

BTW your solder lead must be 63/37 not 60/40
[/quote]

why? I use 60/40 all the time. As long as its not that lead free bullshit we're good.

I have no idea what i am using. It's cheap therefore the numbers are fake. Probably 80/20

What exactly is so bad about lead free solder? I've done some reading and really with the right tools it should work just as well, or at least that's what I thought.

I use lead free, and it has seemed to work well enough, almost no cold joints.

Small PCB work is normally fine with just the rosin core. For soldering large things like XT90's and 5.5mm bullets, I will use a liquid flux. This gives great results for me and the solder wets very well.

I'm aware leaded solder is easier to use especially with just a heat stick, but with the right equipment lead free should be fine right?

I just want to make sure I'm not taking any unnecessary 
unforseen risk.

in my experience, lead free is more trouble than its worth if you're working with it every day.

Fair enough. The only reason I use it is I tend to get messy when cleaning my tips, sending small solder balls to the floor.
