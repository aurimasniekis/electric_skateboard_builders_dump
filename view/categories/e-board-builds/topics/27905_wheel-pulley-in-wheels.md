I have 70mm orangatang 4presidents and was wondering if a 12mm wheel pulley would fit?

width of the pulley isn't the issue.

Your likely problem (besides drilling wheel to fit pulley), is how many teeth on the gear so you still clear the ground.

you might be able to fit 32t or 36 at the largest.  I'd look at some measurements of those gears - regardless of which - you aren't going to have much spare space under the wheel gear (rocks and such can be an issue)

GL!

This is the pulley http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/36t-12mm-enertion-drive-hub/ and he clearance from the trucks to the bottom is 2 inches

The max you'd want to do is 32T, I have 76mm wheels and the gear has some clearance but not a lot. 

It's probably easier to buy either kegels or flywheel as the hubs already have holes in them for the bolts to go through.

The gear linked (36t Enertion one for Flywhee/Clones) will not fit 4presidents.  You need the flywheel's hub to press into for it to fit.  Some generic gears you can drill/bolt to a regular wheel through the thane... but i don't think this one will work.  

Why don't you get a set of clones and call it done?  You can try to hack something together, trashing great $60 wheels, or get some $25-30 clones and that gear and be set.

You will need to cut your axle hanger to fit that gear mounted though - it moves the bearing further in.  There are some videos and directions on how much you need to cut off.

Has anyone fit a pulley on these 103mm off road wheels?
