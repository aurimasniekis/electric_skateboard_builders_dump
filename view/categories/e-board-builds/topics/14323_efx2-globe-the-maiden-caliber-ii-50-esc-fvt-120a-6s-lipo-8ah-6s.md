Hi

This morning I presented Mountainboard with electric drive.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/efx3-trampa-holypro-35-esc-fvt-120a-tunigy-sk3-6374-149kv-lipo-16ah-8s/14305

Earlier also I built several electric longboards

I present the last version, a simple construction without a BMS, using conventional LiPo batteries.

Looks very nice. What's the belt width on the one with the two SK3 6354? And do you have drawings for the motor mount one could get? :)

Single engine belt with a width of 15mm
Two engine belt with a width of 10 mm (but I want to do on 2x15mm)
I'm sorry but I do not share the drawings because it sells the motorholder, will soon be a newer version of the front of the stainless steel

Durability pulley made of ABS + is the distance 400-500km
In the previous longboard I drove 450km on the pulleys made of ABS

Soon (for 3 days) I will show PHOTOS pulleys after driving distance 200 km. I drove about 200km both the Longboard and Mountainboard

Im gonna need those STL files for SCIENCCCCCCCCEEEEEE! :slight_smile:.

I have a freeboard deck, enclosure and x2 VESC's Ive been looking to use for a new project, this is looking like the one.  I'm thinking black carbon fiber vinyl on the deck bottom, black stained top with red racing stripes cut out of grip, 3d printed wheels pulleys/inserts and motor mount in red, paint the aluminum parts black and assemble...add some rgb lights, in red of course, to the bottom of the the deck and call it KIT 2.0.

@mmaner
Thank you for your suggestions, but I have another idea for modifications:
1. Changing the motor mounts to new  made of stainless steel and aluminum
2. Changing one motor to two

and in the near future :)
3. Changing ESC FVT 6S to Dual FVT 12S
4. Changing the battery pack from 6S to 9S

I do not recommend because ESC Dual was not used yet.
I have to test this ESC, I do not know if it is OK.

I tested ESC on my desk only

In the longboard I do not have Sleep Lion, just a new dual ESC.
This is quite a new product, for 2 days I have driven 40km (too early on reliable evaluation) but it works perfectly.
The motors work exceptionally smoothly, the brakes are excellent.

ESC has a small startup delay, but during the ride the acceleration is okay.
