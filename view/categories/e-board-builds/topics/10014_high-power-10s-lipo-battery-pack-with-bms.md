Looking for more hill climbing power than I could get from my 10s2p with 26650 Lions(it works great on flat ground)
This new project is a 10s1p using Turnigy 2s/5000mah/60c hard packs from Hobby King
5 Packs wired in series is smaller and 2lb lighter than the Lion pack!

I used these jst extension wires to extent the balance wires to the bms:
omitting the black ground wire and using only the pos wires from cell 1 and 2 of each pack.
I did this instead of hard wiring to allow for easier testing and replacement of individual cells

I attached the packs to the deck with servo tape.

Hard wired the packs in series for better power transfer and to reduce bulk.
Using adhesive lined shrink tube and squeezed the ends to close it up.

I decided to keep the balance lead connectors for easier testing and replacement of individual packs.

I took it for a quick test ride with only 38v on the pack. Powering up a 12% grade the voltage sag was no more than 1 volt.
More test results to follow...

These are very reasonably priced. Only around $60
Or you could use a less expensive charge only bms. Just be careful, some cheap bms's are unreliable.

Wait sorry if I misunderstood, but the lipos are 10S 5000mah? And they're in series? Wouldn't that mean they are 50S 5000mah? I obviously don't think that's what you are trying to do so I just kinda assumed it's 10S 25a?

```
There are 5 packs in series. Each pack is a 2s/5000mah/60c
So its a 10s1p 5ah 300a discharge.
You may ask, Why in the world would anyone need a battery with 300a discharge?
Point is, very little or no voltage sag when accelerating or climbing hills.
When voltage sag is greatly reduced, You can take the pack lower without tripping the low voltage protection.
And less capacity is needed.

**UPDATE**
The true discharge capability of this battery is more like 90a, NOT 300a.

If you conecting battery in series the discharge is  counting same as Ah? Only voltage doubles.
5x 2s 5000mah 60c in series = 10s 5000mah 60c?
Max amps at 10s (36v) :
60c x 5000mah รท1000= 300a
Or in paralles capacity and discharge doubles?
5x 2s 5000mah 60c in parallel= 2s 250mah 300c?
Max amps at 2s (7.4v) :
300c x 5000mah รท1000= 1500a
Am I wrong?

In parallel it would be

The C rating doesn't change.

Some right some wrong.

Series = multiply voltage

Hey, really cool build. Very inspired and wantt to do something similar. Is it possible that you could make a diagram of what you did? I recently joined the community and have been reading a lot to figure out how the BMS works and what not but can't quite understand how you set this up. (I understand the series connections but not the BMS part)

I highly recommend you get the 60C packs, not 20C. 
With 20c you will have less range because of increased voltage sag.

I used the 2s 5000 60c because they offer high current capability 
while having a very compact footprint.
If space is not an issue, you could use Zippy flight max 8000 30c
I haven't had time to do a full on range test with this setup yet but I have logged about 13 miles without using up a full charge.

Hey man, 

I don't know how to send a private message so i'm just gonna ask my question here, okay? 

I regularly see people with motors that can pull a max om 80A.
Online once read that the max ampere output of a battery is Ah * C 
So for a lot of people i've seen its 5 * 30 = 150A

What am i missing? 

Thanks, Bram

I have (2) 5S 5000 mah Lipos in series and it's such a bitch to charge which I do seperstely for each lipo.  I don't really understand the logistics of a BMS but understand what it does generically.  After more research to come would you mind if I DM you when I feel confident to start the project?  Again, great work here!

```
The KV specs of the motor or motors is dictated by the the Vesc and the voltage. 
You want to keep the Erpm at 60k or less. 
60k/7pole pairs =  8571 RPM
When calculating, use full charge voltage, not nominal voltage. 
Example:
10s = 42volts 8571 rpm / 42volts = 204 max motor KV

I've found that 10s and 190kv makes for a very dependable setup with a good balance of torque and speed.

@Namasaki > 60k/7pole pairs = 8571 RPM
How do you know how many poles a motor has?  Specifically I am curious if a [TB 6355 260kv](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/6355-260kv-epower-motor/) is to high of a KV to use on 10s3p.  And if x2 [TB 6355 260kv](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/6355-260kv-epower-motor/) is too high KV to use n 10s3p. 

The reason I am so confused is that my kids board has a x2 5055 280KV motors and 10s3p.

Thanks for the expertise :slight_smile:

260kv with 10s is over the limit when using a Vesc. 
7 pole pairs or 14 poles is common for the motors we use including TB's motors. (Although, I'm speaking of 60mm motors and I don't know about 55mm motors.) You may be able overcome this limitation by setting the erpm limit in the bldc tool to 60k. 
And as long as your not going full out at full throttle, you may be ok. 
Is your kids board setup with Vescs?
If yes, then maybe they aren't riding fast enough to exceed the limit.
@chaka may be able to address this question better seeing that he is the expert on this topic and all I know is what I've read in his posts.

Hey there!  I can't stop looking at this diagram and your pictures!  I have (2) 5S 5000 mah Lipos.  If I was to keep my balance leads for the same reason (testing) would you recommend I get a balance lead to connect from the Lipo balance and then take the individual wires (minus the ground) from both Lipos into the BMS?  In my head this is starting to make sense but in practice I feel like their would be some fires :fearful: in my case.  Thanks in advance.

The switch is useless but the charge port works fine.
This charge port is the small version and fits the cheaper 42v chargers that are sold on eBay
http://www.ebay.com/itm/222029867724?_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT

I used these extensions to connect the balance wires to the bms:

They're  really nice because I can quickly disconnect each battery pack from the BMS balance circuit for individual testing, charging or replacement if necessary, although I hard soldered each packs main wires for minimum resistance.

Open the motor and count the magnets in the shell.
This motor has 14 magnets (poles) or 7 pole pairs
multiply voltage x KV rating to get RPM
multiply pole pairs x RPM to get ERPM

Your very welcome, 
About the TB 260kv motors, I used to run those. They are good motors with a good torque and speed.
Their shafts are long enough to accommodate the wider pulleys and belts. They also are well made and come with quality NSK bearings.
I ran them at 12s with Hobby ESC's on 90mm wheels and got 28mph going uphill.(just a slight grade)
When I upgraded to Vesc's I switched to 190kv motors and 10s because I was afraid of causing DRV fault in the Vesc.
But, I think that you could possibly run them at 10s with the Vesc if you turn the max erpm limit down from 100k to 60k in the bldc tool. 
This is only speculation by me for I have not tried it and I am by no means an expert concerning the Vesc.

Mine is allready at 60k MAX ERPM, I thought that was the most it should be because of DRV issue?

I am running a 6355 190kv right now until my replacement gets here, if I raise it to100k will I get better performance?  It's slllloooooowwwwwww right now :slight_smile:.

Ideally, I would like to run dual 6355's, but I am still waiting on my 10s pack and DIY is out of stock on VESC's for a couple of weeks and I need to get another motor, so Ill probably go with 190kv at that point.

I don't think upping the erpm limit will help performance. However, your other settings will. Post screen shots of your other settings in bldc tool and lets have a look.

I am currently running 6s (x2 zippy 8000mah 30c Lipo packs), but I am going to 10s when my new pack gets here.

I am really confused by the math regarding the VESC and Motor KV values, mostly because I'm missing so much of the math for a full understanding.  So if I have this right...

8600 / MAX Voltage = MAX KV
then
8600 / 42.0v (10s) = 204kv
so 204kv would be a theoretical maximum that can be used on the VESC.  But that is dependent on the MAX ERPM limit being at 100k?
```

## \#49 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-01-24T23:02:20.515Z Reads: 798

```
motor kv means rpm per volt.
So, 200kv means 200 rpm per volt.
So, 200kv x 42v = 8400 rpm
or, 190kv x 42v = 7980 rpm
The max safe erpm for the vesc is 60k
8400 rpm x 7 pole pairs = 58800 erpm
You could safely run 200kv motor at 10s without having to worry about erpm limit.
```

## \#50 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-01-24T23:07:11.152Z Reads: 834

```
6s voltage is minimum for e-skate and is probably the reason for the lack luster performance.
especially acceleration. Upping the voltage to 10s will make a big difference.
Your motor max (60a) and batt max (60) are plenty high enough.
The only thing, you might try switching from watt control to current control in the PPM settings.

More on voltage,
I have run 6s, 10s and 12s.
Even the difference between 10s and 12s is very noticeable concerning acceleration.
10s is smooth and manageable.
12s is very snappy and requires much more caution when squeezing the trigger.
6s is the most controllable and is good for crowded sidewalks like the boardwalk at the beach where speed and acceleration is not needed.

What setting would I change and how to define the value for that setting if I wanted to run 260kv motor or motors at 10s?  Or is that even possible?  Is there a method of including the ERPM limit into the formula **KV * MAX Voltage * 7 = ERPM**?

I have always run 6s up to this point but my range is not great, that's why I wanted to go to 10s on my everyday board.  Eventually I want to run dual motors, but I have some product to buy first.

When we were talking about 260kv on 10s.

I am trying to figure out if its possible to run the 260kv motors on 10s by adjusting the ERPM limit.  IF so, whats the math to define what the ERPM limit should be?  If that is possible.

Sorry if Im not being clear, it may not be the ERPM limit that is critical but that's the limit that I am trying to avoid passing so as to not burn up the DRV on the VESC.

the erpm limit should be 60k because thats what the vesc can handle.
theres no way to adjust the erpm of the motor except by lowering or raising the voltage supply.
the KV of the motor is set and can't be changed unless you re-wind the motor.
What I was suggesting is that setting the erpm limit in the vesc via the bldc tool to 60k which you have already done might be enough to keep the 260kv motor with 10s voltage from overloading the DRV chip. But I am not sure about this. I haven't tried it so it's only speculation on my part.
I would ask someone like Chaka about this before trying it.

Hey,

Just had a quick question. I know battery max output is C * mAh. I ordered the BMS that you suggested and was going to order the batteries you used but then saw a sale for 2S2P 30C 5000mAh batteries. Therefore this means its 10000mAh (I think). Will this affect the BMS I bought at all?

Those batteries are each made up of two sets of two cells in parallel then together in series for 2s. The output is still the same 2s 5000mah.

## \#69 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-02-05T04:53:12.304Z Reads: 697

I recommend using 2s1p Lipos. that way you are balancing every cell individually.
With a 2s2p Lipo, you would be balancing 2 cell groups as 1cell.
The 2s2p Lipo is made of 4 2500mah cells in parallel and in series. (personally, I would not recommend these for any application)
$125 for 5 2s1p 5000/60-120c packs might seem a little pricey but you get what you pay for. They are high quality packs with low internal resistance. Because of this and their high amp capability, they will be less prone to overheating like some cheaper lipos.
To answer your question, higher mah would not affect the bms as long as you wind up with 10s voltage

Hey there!  I can't stop looking at this diagram and your pictures!  I have (2) 5S 5000 mah Lipos.  If I was to keep my balance leads for the same reason (testing) would you recommend I get a balance lead to connect from the Lipo balance and then take the individual wires (minus the ground) from both Lipos into the BMS?  In my head this is starting to make sense but in practice I feel like their would be some fires :fearful: in my case.  Thanks in advance.
[/quote]

This setup will work with five 2s lipos or two 5s Lipos. It's basically the same thing though because you have more balance wires coming for each pack, you need to be all the more careful and find out using a volt meter which cell each of the colored balance wires goes to. Red is always the last cell in each pack. The black balance wire is ground and is not needed with the Bestech BMS. As you can see by the diagram, The pack that supplies the Black power wire to the system is pack 1 Cells 1,2,3,4,5 and the pack that supplies the Red power wire is pack 2 Cells 6,7,8,9,10
Just connect everything correctly and double check it before turning the power on and it will be fine.

Drawn up a wiring scheme, hope you can help out what to do with the e switch wires and if everything is in the correct place.

Might want to add some leds as well, what's the best place to connect those?

The built in E-switch has to be on during discharge and charge as well. 
The E- switch is also needed to reset the BMS in the event that one of its protection circuits is activated and shuts the system down. 
There is no easy way to bypass using the built in switch. 
You can use an anti spark switch in addition if you want, you'll have to have 2 switches then. 
I really wouldn't recomend it. Because adding the anti spark switch means more connections which means more resistance across the system and those external anti spark switches are prone to failure and could leave you stranded. 
The built in E-switch eliminates the spark issue anyway and it has been very reliable for me since last summer when I started using it.

I would also recommend getting a couple 5s extension cables, plug those into your batteries, cut the plug off the other end of the extension and wire that to your BMS balance cables. 
Then you can quickly disconnect your batteries from the BMS for inspection and maintenance. 
Keep your hobby balance charger for maintenance in case you ever need to replace a pack because you'll  need to manually balance it with the existing pack.
The BMS will keep your packs in balance during charge and discharge cycles but they need to be balanced manually at first because the BMS won't be able to balance them if they are too far out of balance.

One more thing. 
When using five 2s packs, the balance wiring is very simple but when using two 5s packs, it can be easy to make a mistake with the balance wires and their correct order. If you get it wrong, you will fry the BMS. So use a voltage meter to determine which cell each wire comes from and double check to make sure it's wired correctly before connecting the main power wires from the battery and powering up the system.

No need to apologize for being a noob.  All of us where noobs starting out.
that's a really nice JST-XH chart. It looks correct but I would still double check my balance wires with a voltage meter.
This BMS does not use the Black ground balance wire from the Lipos as illustrated in my diagram.
The BMS balance jack is numbered on the bottom side of the PCB.
My updated diagram show the bms layout as it is on the real thing.

There is one more important point that I almost forgot to mention:
These modules are static sensitive so you need to have some type of static protection before you open the bag and remove them.

Those are pretty good, I have one similar that I got from Battery Supports. It charges the pack fairly quick but cant quite charge the pack fully to 42v. It does get the pack up to 41.8 or 41.9 before getting the green light.
The only other option is to use an Adjustable CC/CV  lab power supply. Which is what I use.
I like to get my pack fully charged for maximum performance and range and I am less concerned about their longevity.

Well, If you buy quality Lipos with high C rating then Li-ions can not compare is performance per pound.
Example:
My packs are 10s 5000mah 60/120c  Thats a rating of  300a continuous and 600a peak
A li-ion 10s3p is only 60a continuous  a 10s4p is only 80a continous
So, some may ask why would you need a 300a battery?
The answer is VOLTAGE SAG.
With a 300a battery, there minimum voltage sag under demanding conditions.
With a 60-80a battery you will see much more sag under the same conditions.
On top of that, the 300a Lipo pack is smaller and lighter than the 80a Li-ion pack.
Some feel that Lipos are too hazardous and I for one have said as much.
But recently I am finding that Li-ion cells can be just as hazardous.

Yes you can but the bms will not power the light. 
You will need a volt/ohm meter to test continuity and find the 2 poles that connect when the button is on and connect the E-switch wires to those 2 poles.
then find the 2 poles that energize the light when the switch is on and connect those to pos and neg 5v source.
I used an open channel on my receiver to power the light on my switch. It is ultimately powered by the 5v coming for the Vesc.

Adding to @Namasaki here,
Performance is relative.
Are you measuring performance with range, power output, efficiency, or something else???

If we talk about range, the 10S4P is better as you have more energy. 360Wh vs 185Wh in the LiPo
If we talk about power output, the 10S 5000mAh LiPo is better as they are designed to run at high power conditions, you'll see this in the power ratings. (18650 cells rated between 1.5C-10C, while LiPos are rated between 25C-120C)
The LiPo is smaller (8.4% smaller in volume) and lighter (17.2% in weight), but that is only because it has about half the energy than the 10S4P pack. If you compare two packs with identical energy the LiPo will be much heavier and bigger.

25R cells are pretty terrible cells in my opinion, the only good thing about them is that they're cheap and really they're not that cheap...

I suggest you use 30Q cells.

* They have 3000mAh which means a 10S4P pack will have 432Wh, which is 20% more than the 25R and 134% more than LiPo.
* They have much lower voltage sag than 25Rs which means you can push your board as much as you want without it cutting out on you.
* Can be found under $4 per cell.

When I said performance I am referring to power and the ability to deliver high current without excessive voltage sag.
I refer to range as range not as performance.
So, theoretically, a 10s4p li-ion pack will have more range especially with 30q cells capable of 30a per cell.
I did recently built a Li-ion pack using 26650 cells that 4500mah and capable of 30a per cell.
My pack was a 10s2p so 9000mah or 324WH vs my 185wh Lipo pack.
The Lipo pack is smaller and 1 pound lighter than the Li-ion pack.
In demanding conditions with lots of hills, the range of the Li-ion pack was the same or less that the Lipo pack because voltage sag robbed the Li-ion pack of its range.
Granted, on flat ground at moderate speeds the Li-ion pack had much more range. Unfortunately for me, most of my riding is up and down hills.

Performance can be measured based on need. I won't argue how you decide to measure it.

A 30Q 10S4P pack can deliver 1680W of power throughout 91% of it's capacity and 2000W through 83% of it's capacity. I'm using 2.8V as the cutoff when they can really go down to 2.5V. 
The 25Rs on the other hand can only do this for about 50% of their capacity.
So I believe that a 25R pack in a high power environment only had as much range as your LiPo Pack (this is why I think they are crap), the 30Q pack on the other hand would still have twice as much range if you constantly ran it at these power conditions.

My 10S4P pack weighs 4.375lbs including all wires and connectors, according to the link in your first post 5 of your cells weigh 3.46lbs, so lets assume 3.5lbs once all is done. That is 20% lighter than the Li-ion, so 3% off of my initial estimate.

Liions should be ridden with a VESC cutoff at 3V while Lipos typically are only used until 3.4V.
There is a lot of Energy left if you keep your Lipo settings and just switch to a Liion battery.

I have not, as I said it is just an impression that I have and feels weird even to me but what Namakasi said can be true... Liion have a huge voltage sag on high demand of power and that can cut drastically its range

I had that problem - the right VESC cut off values will solve it though. Liions definitely need the proper cut-offs - otherwise you will sag down too far and the VESC takes away power. A good thing is to look at actual logs - I rode my battery (the one you know about) to 3.5V and already thought that it is at its end since this is below 3.6V and they go down fast at this point. However the log showed only 150Wh used from a potential 270Wh - so quite some juice left. At home I checked with http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Samsung%20INR18650-25R%202500mAh%20%28Green%29%20UK.html and saw that 3.5V has still plenty left. If my cut-off would have been at 3.4V I surely would have thought it is empty.

Boo, I couldn't find discharge curves for those cells...
Based on a similar cell the bestfire inr26650, you should be able to pull 30A per cell sagging 18% up to 3Ah. That means 3600W...

What were your voltage limits set to?
Do you have any of the logging apps?

Voltage limits where set lower for my Li-ion pack than for my Lipo pack. The problem was that my Li-ion pack sagged so much and depleted so quickly under high load conditions. 
My first build was with Lipos, charging them with a hobby charger. 
Then I switched to Li-ion thinking they would be safer and more convenient with a BMS and expecting the same or better performance as the Lipos. 
But I was terribly disappointed with there lack luster power and ridiculous voltage sag under load. 
So I went back to Lipos but this time with a BMS. 
Now I have power and convenience. 
And the only time that my Li-ion pack had more range was when cruising the flat boardwalk at no more than 10mph. 
Even though the Li-ion pack had more watt hours, 
It depleted so much faster than my Lipo pack under more challenging conditions  that they even out in range with the Lipo pack delivering more power throughout that range.

Unles your efficiency changed your statement makes no sense.
Energy is energy - it can't just disappear.
So there must be more to this story: You either used only mediocre cells or had wrong cut-offs.
5000mAh from a Liion HAS to get you as far as 5000mAh from a Lipo (at the same voltage obviously).

Voltage drop is an issue yes - but that would just mean you did not use up all the energy in your liion pack.
How much did you actually charge it?

The problem is that your voltage should not sag 30-40% ever unless you were drawing like 5kW which is highly unlikely.
That is super weird... Maybe you got bad cells? That's kind of why I only buy Samsung, LG, Sony or Panasonic cells. They got way more to lose if they produce crap cells since they're used in industrial applications.

Do you still have this pack?
Would you like to fix the issues with it? I could probably help you with troubleshooting if you can log data.
If you don't really care for it then, no worries.

5000mah from Liion SHOULD get you as far as 5000mah from Lipo

But in practice you don't get 5000mah of any of them. Part of the energy disipates in heat and a lot of energy is just wasted on drivetrain and so on. When you have a big sag you are wasting more energy. (For example, full throttle for 1km, sag of 1v in one battery and 3v on another battery, the first will be using less energy than the second)

So that is why I said that in practice, Liion seems to be making a lot less range than it should when compared to LiPo, and Namakasi is not the only person having this, there are a couple of threads with a lot of people telling their ranges and people with 6s5000mah lipo are getting unbelievable long ranges.

Kind of agree but not really.
The issue with @Namasaki's pack is that it's sagging way more than what it should be.
The issue with most others that have this issue is that they use 25R cells which as I explained are not great.

Here is a good comparison from another thread:
[quote="radium, post:23, topic:17296"]
I'll throw my 2c into the ring. I built a 12S5P lithium ion pack using Samsung 18650 30Q for about $300 it could be cheaper depending on 18650 cell and supplier. It's a lot of cells, but it allowed me to configure and arrange them how I wanted and needed to make them fit. The pack has a capacity of 15Ah and 75A continuous discharge rate.

I also have 2 6S Multistar 16Ah batteries that are supposedly 10C max discharge. Realistically for our use, they're about 5C, otherwise the voltage sag is too great. They were about $150 shipped. They are bulky batteries, I had to make a second enclosure just for when I run the Multistars because of their height. I could break them apart and a rebuild the packs, but that negates one of their supposed benefits of out of the box simplicity. They're also heavy.
[/quote]

[quote="radium, post:26, topic:17296, full:true"]
Mine doesn't slow down on a 10-15% grade, and I get over 30 miles on a single charge. My total of $300 included a BMS and an appropriate charger. To get a comparable lipo config outside of the Multistar lineup would probably cost around $300 with a charger that could balance charge the batteries simultaneously.

I haven't had my board working for too long, but in my limited testing I've never pulled more than 107A with 2 6355 motors. It was measured with that in line Turnigy power meter. How many amps are you pulling with Li Ion where you start to notice a slow down going up hills?

Another consideration is that I could probably add another 10-20 cells into my 18650 config if I put it into an enclosure the size of the one required for the Multistar batteries.

Either way, both are definitely useable, my only experience is with Multistar because it offered the most capacity for the right price. I imagine other lower capacity packs don't get as hot.

That is why I said that unless his efficiency changed this is impossible.
voltage drop has nothing to do with this - sure we could assume that the heat generated by the Liion is higher than Lipo but I highly doubt that this happens in meaningful amounts. If we would have to dissipate an additional 100Wh via the battery our enclosures would be HOT and the VESC would shut off due to overheating. Ever touched a traditional 60W light bulb while on?

Very interesting reading @PXSS, it's a pity that they are not showing real range 

I guess it all depends on the quality of the cells and lipos.

One thing that I know for a fact after years in rc cars and multirotors is that C rating is bullshit in lipos, so if it is in 18650 too we can only trust real tests

So I went back to my lipos.  I am now trying another 10s3p, if I can get the damned thing to fit.  I also have a 30q 10s3p pack in the works.

Namasaki 26650 cells aren't as good as name brand 18650 cells. A lot more R&D was put into 18650's since they were heavily used in laptops for a long time. 18650 was the only size battery that had enough manufacturing infrastructure already built around it for use in electric vehicles. This is why Tesla chose this size cell. They had the best specific energy, and could be manufactured in larger quantities with tighter manufacturing tolerances more quickly than any other size cell.

The other issue is name brand cells from reputable suppliers vs off brand Chinese or recycled cells. A lot of chinese suppliers take old Samsung, LG, Panasonic etc... cells and clean them up re-wrap them and cell them as new cells. A lot of chinese suppliers also buy cheap knock off 18650 cells from Chinese factories and sell them as legit name brand cells.

The vape community has done extensive testing around 18650 batteries and how much a single cell can handle in terms of current draw and voltage sag. This information is all out there publicly. If you're interested search for posts by "battery_mooch" or maybe "battery_m00ch" on reddit his name is something like that. He's put out a wealth of information about 18650 cells some of which are of interest to us.

The TLDR of my post, 18650 cells produced by Samsung, LG and other name brand companies have spec sheets which are accurate. These figures may be inflated by resellers, but go look at the manufacturing spec sheet for real info. If you buy cells made by someone other than Samsung, Panasonic, LG and Sanyo you can expect the specs to be inflated.

If you buy cells from a disreputable reseller, you can expect there is a good chance they will be re-wrapped chinese or recycled cells not the real cells.

18650's are great for our purposes, but there are a TON of fake resellers of cells. Be careful and know your supplier.

Ya, I'm thinking that the Basen 26650 cells where overrated. I went with those because of the 4500mah in an attempt to build a compact battery with good range. And its range was exceptional under very mild conditions but not under more demanding conditions. 

 It's my understanding that Tesla doesn't use just any 18650 but theirs are special.
 From what @PXSS has stated, it sounds like those 30Q cells may be the best available option for A Li-ion battery.
As for me, I'm happy with what I'm getting from my Lipo packs so I'm not looking for other options at this time.

The other thing with these batteries is as capacity increases, current draw decreases. Typically a good 2500mAh cell from the same generation as a 3000mAh cell will be able to handle more load with less heat and voltage sag.

I don't know as much about 26650 cells as I do about 18650 cells, but the current generation 18650's absolute top of the line cells for capacity are 3500mAh. Those aren't suitable for our uses though. They might be in something like a 10P config, but realistically for us 3000mAh cells like the Samsung 30Q and LG HG2 are about the best we'll get in terms of capacity.

I'm thinking about either reconfiguring my 12S5P pack or building another 10S6P pack with cells from the same supplier to see if I get more torque because my only experience so far is with my 12S5P pack and 16AH Multistar batteries. People have said the Multistar batteries are lackluster in terms of voltage sag under load and don't give enough torque. Both seem fine to me, I get comparable range and speed from both. The 18650 pack sags slightly less under load.

I've yet to top out either pack. I cruise around at probably 18-22mph top speed. I didn't realize how fast 25+mph would feel on a board when it is that high up. Most of my longboarding experience was on drop throughs or dropped boards. I owned one top mount which I turned into the esk8 and with the angled risers, it's very high up from the road. I might try putting stiffer bushings on it but I like the carvy feeling I have now.

I would not even consider building a10s6p or 12s5p battery out of 18650 cells because of the size and weight of it. I mean 60 cells, that's gonna be over 22" long in a low profile configuration. We have tall speed bumps where I live so ground clearance matters. 
What I needed was plenty of power in a compact low profile light weight battery and since my rides are usually 10mi or less, range is not my main concern.

I'm building @mmaner's pack. Hopefully it'll only be a weekend or two until I can get to it.

Kinda sucks that your safe got stolen, hopefully it caught fire before they could take anything from it...

Tessa uses Panasonic NCR18650B cells, they're the old gen of the NCR18650GA cell which used to be made by Sanyo (who got bought out by Panasonic who is partly owned by Tesla, I hope you seethe connection now). There is really nothing special about their cell except that they use 7800 of them lol. The secret sauce is their temperature control algorithm and system. 

The 30Q cells are not the best, VTC6's by Sony are, but these cost $6 a cell. I can source 30Q at $3 a cell for like 10% more sag. 

@radium is correct, a lot of research has gone into 18650, other size cells are not nearly as optimized.

The problem is that there are few options in terms switches that can withstand the amp loads of esk8 with voltages higher than 6s...check around...pretty much anti-spark loop key or some type of antispark switch are the only choices...regular switches like a light switch can handle 120v, but not the amps a 12s (50.4v) would produce for example.

Quick Q. Sold my batteries (the 2S2P ones, shouldn't lose much if not any money so that's good). I am looking at new ones and can't decide between 2S 5000mAh 30C and 2S 5000mAh 40C. I know that you say the higher the C the lower the sag, and the packs max outputs are 150A v 200A, but the second one is about $3 more (x5 = $15). Is it worth it to get the 40C ones?

do you have a hobby charger?
If yes, it's a good idea to balance charge the packs before putting them together.
If no, check each packs voltage and balance. All cells should be close to same voltage when you put them together.

On almost all BMS's the switch wires are either open or closed.  There is no NEG or POS, its simply an open loop for OFF or a closed loop for ON.  Obviously this is for BMS's tat have a switch, some do not.

Exactly as @mmaner said. The Bestech E-switch has 2 white wires. When there connected together, the bms turns on.
When there disconnected, it turns off.
All you need is a simple 2-pole automotive switch connected to the wires.

Thx @mmaner and @Namasaki, was a just to be save question hehe.
Atm I'm mostly using 12AWG wire and 14AWG from the charge port to the BMS. Is this gonna be a problem? Using XT150 for connectors, so that'll be save enough.

VESC came with 12AWG, so thought that would be save enough.

Wiring finally coming together thanks to your diagram and tips @Namasaki. Thanks again!

12/14 AWG to a charge port is fairly beefy. Since chargers typically charge around 4 amps you can use a thinner cable than that. I think mine is 18/20 awg.

I would like to duplicate this approach, but ideally would like to keep the possibility of going to 12S open, if it turns out my build is underpowered on 10S is there a 12S version of the bestech BMS you used? 

if I wired a 12S BMS to a 10S battery initially would you expect that to work?

Thanks, think i found the 12s version, but also found this one

http://bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D328.html

Looks like it has a lot of extra features and is programmable for different numbers of cells, worried it might be overly complicated to configure tho' done a few searches and nobody seems to be using it.

I'm new to esk8 and skating in general so 10s seems like a more sensible place to start than 12S, but like the idea if just being able to buy 1 extra cell if i do decide i need the extra volts. Could this BMS be a sensible choice?

Those look interesting with their software adjustability. I'm not positive but I think they are rather pricey.
And you will have to buy the optional computer adapter to connect it.

If your just staring out, 10s is probably a better choice seeing that it is easier to manage the power than 12s.
One benefit with the bms that I use is that it has a built in E-switch saving you at least $45 that you would spend on an external E-switch.
And some of it's  parameters are adjustable as well. Only you have to request them when you order it and they are set at the factory.

Also i was wondering if i could get secure enough and high enough amp connectors that i could plug all the cells together, was thinking i could then unclip to replace cells or make plane legal.

There was a long thread on here about plane legal cells and my understanding is, if they are standard off the shelf cells, correctly rated and under 100kw they are fine, so thinking 5 of these cells once separated would be okay.

do you think bullet connectors of the type used on the battery work for this?

I would trust the 5.5mm bullet connectors for an application like that. They are heavy duty and fit together tightly and they don't come apart with vibration. 
They work well with heavy gauge silicone wire like 12ga and 10ga
And they do not add a lot of bulk to your wiring as other connectors will.

Except, you need to monitor battery level while riding. How you gonna do that with LED's on the bms that you can't see.
Better to have an inline meter mounted through the top of your deck so you can just look down to check the battery.

Bestech sales are done through email.
Send an email to lucy@bestechpower.com requesting to purchase the bms module.
The minimum purchase is for 2 modules.
The cost is $49 ea. plus shipping and PayPal fee.
If you don't want to keep the extra module, they are easily sold on this forum.
Some of the parameters are adjustable at the factory and you will need to specify your preferences during the order process.
I recommend these settings for Lipo batteries,  for Li-ion you could lower the over discharge voltage detection to 2.8v

Hey @Namasaki, love your battery pack design!
I also was thinking several times about such a way to make a pack but there's always 2 questions i have.

Isn't it a problem with one short and one long battery lead (in your case the positive lead is long)?
Read often all leads must be the same length and even the distance from one side to the other of your pack is about 23cm, so the positive lead to the controller incl. BMS is min. 30cm, maybe more..... (In my case the positive lead would be 40cm and the negative 15cm). That's why i never did it.

About the BMS, your bestec has over-discharge protection at 2.9V which is quite high but still 2,9V would damage the Lipo cells i think. Most BMS have even lower over-discharge (i have one with 2,5V) because they are maninly made for Li-ion so i don't know why to use a BMS when e.g. one cell is drifting and the BMS starts working when the weak cell reached 2,5-2,9V when it's too late. 

Are there any advantages to use a BMS compared to fuse only and cheap BMS for charging?
I would like to use a BMS for dischgarge in the future, too but i'm not sure if it can really save the lipos......
```

---
## \#208 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-07-19T17:58:57.874Z Reads: 358

```
I'm currently using the same bms with the over discharge detection set at 3.0V which is the highest option.
If one cell drifts down to 3.0v the bms shuts everything down. Some Lipos may handle 3.0v without damage others might not. Normally I try not to run my battery lower than 36v and much of the time I don't go below 38v. 
The other advantages of discharging through the bms are short circuit protection.( if a short anywhere in the system occurs, the bms will instantly shut down the entire system.) This happened to me once when I accidentally  shorted the charge port. The bms shut power down so fast that nothing was damaged not even the battery.
People have complained about having problems with Regen braking downhill on a full battery with their vesc shutting down because of over voltage and then being suddenly without any brakes.
I have tested braking down steep hills with a full battery whiled monitoring my battery voltage. The bms would not let the voltage climb higher than 42.8v on my 10s battery and as soon as I stopped braking, the bms quickly pulled the voltage back down to 42v while I was just coasting.
So it seems safe to say that the bms protects against overcharging though regen braking.

DC current moves in one direction from negative to positive. Therefore I can't see why the positive wire being longer than the negative wire would make any difference at all except that the longer your power wires are, the more resistance you have.
 But it's not a matter of balancing the positive and negative wires.

Sorry for this stupid question (i'm no electician) but shouldn't a fuse with the same amount of ampere as BMS max doing the same job (beside the fact that the fuse has to be changed afterwards)?
But maybe the BMS is much faster...

I don't have bestec, i have other brand 10s 60A cont./120A max. But this is charging/discharging on different ports where i'm afraid to use it because of regenerative braking. That's why i ordered the same BMS with charging/discharging at the same port which i'll use for my Li-ion pack (build not finished).

I have a second build just finished (MTB with 10s 10Ah Lipo) and you make me wanna use BMS now :wink:

bms protects against overcharging though regen braking
[/quote]

well that's a good point

Right now i have a cheap bypassed BMS for charging only.
I'm afraid to use my "proper" BMS and send energy back to the discharge port...

I try not to run my battery lower than 36v

I try it too but when i ride i always forget to watch the voltage. Some days ago i was riding my MTB in the middle of nowhere in the night when my vescs let me know that i've reached 0% (32V) :joy: It was a long way back.....

Do the bms needs to be turned on via E-switch, when charging or ?

And oh, what charger are you using ?

Yes, the bms E-switch has to be on during charging.
I have a Battery Supports 5a brick charger for mobile charging and at home I use a CC/CV Lab Power supply to charge.

The Bestech bms also has a separate C- (charge only) pad. Still it handles Regen charging coming in through the P-(output) pad.

I recommend locating your voltage meter on top of your board or through the deck so you can monitor your battery while riding.
The BMS over discharge protection should be used as a protection against extreme cell drift and not as a first line defense  or as a fuel gauge.
I also recommend using a voltage readout instead of a percentage readout since that can be deceiving and the voltage is what really matters.

```
The vesc's are on while charging. I don't have a problem with that although a loop key would solve it.
The power supply starts out giving 5a with a voltage a little higher than the battery's current voltage and slowly raises the voltage as the battery charges. This is CC mode and it prevents heating of the cells during charge.
Once the voltage reaches the finish voltage that is set, say 42v the power supply automatically switches to CV mode and the current starts reducing as the battery fills. Theoretically, the current will drop to zero when the battery is full.
I usually stop charging when it gets down around 50ma but since the bms trims the high cells at the rate of 126ma, it seems feasible to let the power supply trickle charge at 50ma and continue to fill low cells while the bms trims the higher cells.

That makes me hope, i think i'll give it a try. But in this case i gonna use the BMS with different ports for Li-ion pack (10s4p charging max. 16A) and the BMS with same ports and charging max. of 60A for my Lipo pack (10s charging max 50A) where i need stronger brakes anyway (MTB).

Do you think an additional fuse is needed when using BMS for discharge as safety?

Many thanks for your help! :grinning:

How many cycles do you think you have put on the pack so far? 
I'm building one similar but 12s and wondering if its worth getting the more expensive packs like nanotech or graphene? They advertise higher charge rates upto 15c and I like to run high regen battery amps. Currently I am running 25 amps on regen but I dont have a logger to know how many amps the system is actually generating during braking. But I wonder if it really matters as its only for a few seconds, its not like your charging the pack from empty at 5c which you would expect it to get warm if you did that?

You don't need a fuse when discharging through the bms because:

2. The Vesc controls current.

For parallel charging the lipos the best and most effective way is to use a nice charger and a good, beefy PSU.
I use the ISDT SC620, 20A charger and a ex-server 500W PSU (small, light and around 40A@12V charging capabilities).
I can charge 2x 4S 5000 mAh in under 30 minutes from like 3.7V per cell to full charge at 4.2V - that's in parallel @ 10A. In case of 3x 4S 5000 mAh setup I'll just ramp the amps up to 15A and get the same charging time.

Charging at 1C is not fast charging it's the proper way of charging lipos. 1C for 5000 mAh is 5A while for 2x 5000mAh lipos in parallel is 10A.

I have some experience in FPV and drone racing so I'm quite familiar with proper lipo care and maintainence.
Oscar did a great writeup on parallel charging here: https://oscarliang.com/parallel-charging-multiple-lipo/
Also: https://rogershobbycenter.com/lipoguide/

I've never discharge them below 3.6V per cell. You could feel the difference with drones when the cell voltage fell below 3.8V almost instanly. Between 3.6 and 3.7 they were getting really sluggish. That was a clear sign for a battery change. 
I'm holding to the same habits here in the esk8 hobby as well. 3.7V is preferably the lowest point one should go, 3.6V being a rare exception. Going lower will degrade the performance and can cause bigger risks of damaging the cell...which will over time inflate or even be prone to catch fire. I store my lipos @3.8V per cell.

I used to charge my 3S drone packs with 2C without any issues whatsoever. Then I f*ed up (2 times actually) and did a deep discharge to around 2.8-3V. The cells started to puff right after that.

It was similar with my first esk8 build where I was foolish enough to count on the ESC to do a cut-off. But I never even had a chance to charge those (brand new) batteries more than once. The board stopped but it wasn't the ESC. The batteries were at 2V :scream: I've managed to recover the packs but they are quite puffed now and had to remove 2 cells after few more charges because they died.

In my experience, it is the discharge that kills it.  Fast charge away, ain't noone got the time to wait for a ride :) I only slow charge at night.

Exactly ;)
I look at the charging situation like this: we're in a year 2017 and we utilize 2-5A chargers for BMS to fully charge our esk8 in like 3-4 hours? Even electric cars can be charged up quicker...and have times bigger batteries.
Because "it's more convenient" to hook up the board to a charger and then wait 3 hours. I disconnect the batteries in series, connect them in parallel and hook it up to my charger. 1-2 min of work tops. 28 minutes later I'm riding again. 
And if I for example keep another two packs of 2x4S 5000mAh charged (1 hour of charging time for both together) I drop them in my lipo safe bag and then in my backpack and off I go. And when my Drok shows around 65% of charge after like 12km I know I'm close to 3.7 - 3.8 V per cell. I swap the lipos and that way I can theoretically ride for 3x12km and I'm being very, very conservative with my batteries on a single motor setup. That's almost 40 km of range @ around 15km/h average (we have below average quality of asphalt on the city bike trails).

Somewhere in this forum @Namasaki talks about this. Saying that it's unwise to go for a 2p pack since balancing the cells of such battery is not completely accurate.
Why?
Because the cells are packed as groups of 2, meaning the balancer sees two cells as one cell.

Hi @Namasaki
Just to have an understanding of how to use lipos with a BMS.
When you buy 5 fresh 2s lipos for your 10s build. Do you first have to balance every battery individually using a lipo balancing charger?
Or can you just install all 5 and hook them up to the BMS and let him do the job?

@Namasaki My 10S BMS from Bestech has overcharge protection of 4.28V - as you have same model do you think I can let it charge to this number or keep an eye on voltage meter and disconnect it at around 4.1V? In specs it's says Balance charge 4.2V - does it mean it will start balancing at this voltage only ?

You can use any on/off switch. 
Although the bms will not light a lighted switch

You could always connect the LED on the switch using different ways:

- connect LED pins to the BMS outputs with a resistor in series. Calculate resistor value like this:
R=Vin-2V/I, where Vin is your battery voltage, I is 0.02A
And use closest resistor you can find to the calculated value. You don't have to be extra accurate about it. For example, using 10S pack it would be like R=40-2/0.02=1900Ohm which means 1.8kOhm or 2.2kOhm resistor.

- connect LED to the ESC or receiver 5V outputs. Calculate resistor values using same formula, but use 5V as Vin. Depending on the LED type, it might not light up on 5V. Test it on the bench :)

```
The overcharge protection is set at 4.28 by default to allow some headroom.  Balancing starts at 4.2v
If your cells drift during discharge and then if you undercharge them, the bms will not balance them. 
If you continue this way so that your cells drift too far out of balance, your battery could reach a point where it will not fully charge and the bms will not be able to balance the cells. 
How the bms works is like this:
When your pack reaches 42v and the charger stops charging (green light) the bms will then trim down the highest cells to balance them with the lowest cells ending up with a total voltage below 42v
How much under will depend on how well matched your cells are and how evenly they charge and discharge.
The more balanced and matched(internal resistance) your cells are, the closer you will be to 42v

Chargers do what is called constant current / constant voltage charge.
If empty battery is connected it will start charging using pre set constant current. The battery voltage will slowly rise as the battery charges. When the charger voltage level is reached, it will slowly reduce current and it will go into the constant voltage mode meaning it is charged.

I'm glad you asked. 
Voltage is like pressure
Current is like flow 
If the voltage (pressure)  from your charger is greater than the voltage (pressure)in your battery.
The voltage will continue to flow into the battery. 
Once the voltage in the battery is equal to the voltage from the charger then the flow stops because the pressure is equal. 
The the flow stops the green light comes on

Yes but best to remove the charger, let the cells balance down and then put the charger back on to fill it up again. 
Better yet though is to leave it below 42v
Bestech designed it that way to help prolong battery life

So lets say i have a 10s setup. Then when i connect my Charger , it can feel that the voltage is under 42v ? So when it starts to charge , it's start with lower voltage than 42v ? Or starts in 42v, and can feel when the battery level is the same ?

So I can also leave it on and it will do the magic? I guess it wouldn't damage cells - current will be very low at the stage of trimming and balancing. I was under impression BMS is a full package and won't have to be disconnected and connected again after full charge. 

How would I know when cells are balanced ( BMS doesn't have any LEDs) since charge will have green light on even before balancing is finished?

I use a lab power supply to charge my batteries. 
It starts in CC mode and continues to raise the voltage keeping it just enough above the battery's voltage for the electrons to flow into the battery. 
Once the power supply reaches the max voltage that I set (42v) it then switches to CV mode. At this point the battery is usually around 41.5v
Then as the voltage in the battery becomes more and more equal to the voltage from the power supply the flow of electrons (current) gradually decreases until the voltage (pressure) in the battery is equal to the voltage(pressure) coming from the power supply. 
I can't say if a $12 charger works the same way or not. 
It would be easy to find out with a volt meter on the output of the charger while charging the battery

Yes, it can "feel" it, if you want to put it like that. During CC mode, the voltage will rise as the battery voltage rises, linearly.

How can I tell it is balanced by using "Brick" 42V 5A charger with LED? It doesn't display voltage ... Well I have voltage meter attached to the board ... but I guess I would have to look at it for some time so catch voltage drop. I guess I can't just rely on Green LED on the brick right?

I have latching LED switch which I would like to disconnect it from Vedder anti spark and connect it to built in Bestech BMS switch to save on space in my enclosure. Here are the schematics of this model.

Based on above is my below connection diagram correct? Switch is rated for 6/12/24 V and max of 3A so might be slightly dimmer than at 6V ( I will bench test it later). I want it to light up when pressed.

Yes but you don't want that. Why? Well let's say one parallel group or cell in the series pack is "bad" and it is out of balance. Example of 3S pack:
4.0V 3.8V 4.0V
Charger will charge until pack gets at 12.6V and at this point the pack will be something like:
4.3V 4.0V 4.3V = 12.6V
Some of the cells will be overcharged, not a good idea.

Just to have an understanding of how to use lipos with a BMS.
When you buy 5 fresh 2s lipos for your 10s build. Do you first have to balance every battery individually using a lipo balancing charger?
Or can you just install all 5 and hook them up to the BMS and let him do the job?
[/quote]

Sorry for the late reply.
It would be best to balance the packs before assembling them but if you don't have a hobby charger, then you can get around that as long as all packs are close to the same charge.
I once experienced a problem when I had to replace a pack who's main power cable came loose inside the case.
the new battery was at storage charge and the rest of the pack was somewhere over 4.0v per cell.
In that case the charger stopped before the total pack voltage could reach 42v so the bms balancing was not triggered.
I had to go in and charge the new pack separately to equalize it with the rest of the battery. After that everything was fine.
Frankly, I don't know of any BMS that can balance cells as well as  a good hobby charger can.

The electronics for the E-switch are built into the bms. There are 2 wires coming from the bms that have to be connected to a physical on/off switch.

The switch that comes with the charge port is useless because it is a momentary switch, not an on/off switch.

I connected the BMS to the charger, this way I didn't need to fit it into my board. Connected the C- to the charger -. And the B- is going out the the charger port, so to the - of the lipo. Got the eswitch connected to a simple on/off switch, the one with just two poles, to be able to switch it on and off.
I just need to connect the balance wires, but that something that's always necessary.
There is an anti-spark and switch between the VESC and the lipo's so in theory with the board off there will be no power from the charger that goes to the VESC. Which should make it extra save for the VESC.

This should work, but I haven't seen this before so I just wanted to check. I might have missed something important that ill blow everything up :joy:

In short it's like the image. Only thing missing from the image to keep it simple is the charger port and socket. And the part where the wire from the lipo goes to the anti-spark. (which are coming from the same connector as the wires the charge port uses)

When looking at the diagram I noticed there is nothing different from wiring it directly to the lipo except for the P- not being used. Which in this case is not needed.

They were flagged by someone as being a crazy price, what do you reckon? I think they're going to make a pretty usable pack.

All lithium multi cell batteries need balance charging.
A bms will not even work if you don't connect the balance wires.
this is how you connect them.
On the graphenes, the center socket is for the cell one balance wire.
Cell 2 balance wire connects to the main positive output.

Thanks buddy. It all makes sense now. Very helpful schematic too. I'm sooo close to buying a handful of those batteries, since they're down to $22.22/ea now. :scream: 

$111 for 185wh @ 10s with 450A cont./675A burst output + ~$40 BMS sounds pretty sweet. Even if the specs are overinflated.

Although Lipo specs are over inflated, when you get them in the 60-90C range, they absolutely Rock!

My 10s 5ah pack with 60C Turnigy Lipos only sags 1/2v when accelerating on slight grades and only 1v when charging up a 10%grade and I'm 195 pounds. They don't swell, they don't overheat.

So imagine how those Graphene 90C packs will perform!!!!
Especially since Graphenes are Turnigy's most high performance battery.
The sale price is crazy. I would buy an extra set just to save for backup.

I get about 14 miles out if my setup, which is essentially like the @Namasaki hi-powered 10s pack other than mine are 30c cells.  I still never sag below 1v, even on pretty large grades.  

I just wanna say I wouldn't have thought of constructing a pack like that without @Namasaki doing all the leg work, and I have 2 now, so good on you brother.

I will just ask here since people might want to ask the same questions.
I might go a LITTLE bit above 10 characters lol. 
So, I am purchasing a BMS from bestech, but I still got few questions that I did not get an exact answer from the Bestech representative. 

1. http://www.ebay.com/itm/262359346829?_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT
For these charging ports do you have to solder the wires on to the BMS or you just plug it in?

2. I got three 3s1p 5000mah 40C LiPo, will these balance lead work for them?
NEW 12&#034; JST 2S LIPO BALANCE LEAD EXTENSION SILICONE 22awg WIRE ADAPTER...

3. For me to solder something means to let them stay on FOREVER lol. If I solder the batteries together will they be able to charge balancely with the BMS or do I have to uninstall them periodically to balance charge them?

I feel bad to ask about these dumb questions, but I went through your post twice and could not wrap my head around this. You have my gratitude.

1: The charge port has to be soldered. The negative wire goes to the bms and the positive wire goes to the main positive of the battery.

2: 2s balance extensions will not work with 3s batteries because they have a different connector.
   2s has a 3 pin connector and 3s has a 4 pin connector

3: The bms will balance the batteries after they are fully charged by trimming the highest cells down to match the lowest cells.
If you ever needed to charge one of the 3s packs individually, you can by connecting the positive and negative charge leads of a hobby charger to the positive and negative wires of the pack you want to charge and connect the balance wires of that pack to the balance port on the hobby charger and use balance charge function. The pack your charging will be electrically isolated from the rest as far as the charge circuit is concerned. You would want to disconnect the balance leads from the bms before performing this operation. And be sure the bms is turned off.

Your diagram needs more detail concerning the balance wires. Namely, you need to show the numbers of the bms balance socket and 3s batteries will have 4 balance wires. 
Bottom line. Your main connections look good but I can't tell anything about the balance wires and if you get those wrong, you'll fry the bms

You can not use a charger with higher voltage than the voltage of a 9s Lipo pack at full charge.
Lipo cells at full charge will be 4.2v
4.2 x 9 = 37.8

Just search eBay for  " 37.8v charger"
I ran the search and found at least three 37.8v 2a chargers

Nominal voltage is 3.7v per cell or 33.3v for 9s

You want the charger to match your battery's voltage at full charge or else it will not fully charge the battery.

Holy shit @Namasaki since the last time I visited this thread in January you've really had your work cut out for you answering questions!  Thanks so much for your insightful contribution!  I've recently ordered some of my parts now that I've gotten around to some extra cash.

Anyhow, I'm running a single 6375 R-Spec on 10s 8000mah and it works great.  This new battery setup will be used with the R-Spec but will be switched to the new Carvon v4s as soon as I receive it!  My question to you is: would it be better to go with the 12s over this 10s with the Carvon v4's or is that overkill?  Any pros or cons you can kindly point out?  Thanks again brotha!  I owe you a beer :)

hi @Namasaki

Do you know if a BMS is supposed to close off a circuit once cells reach a certain voltage? I left my loop key plugged in for a couple days and came back to 1 LiPo completely unbalanced with one of the lowest cells being 1.4v. My other LiPo seems fine since all cells are at my vesc cutoff voltage. 

I was under the impression that this was what they meant by over-discharge protection

All of your wiring looks correct. However, the over discharge detection for the Supower BMS is too low for Lipo batteries. Once a Lipo cell Falls below 3.0 V it can drop off very quickly. 
 However, the BMS should have shut down when that cell reached 2.9 V

That's not exactly how it works. The Bms should shut down if even just one cell drops to 2.9 V. 
For example, if you have one cell that falls out of balance and goes lower than the rest. You could have nine cells at 3.0v+ and one cell at 2.9v. 
 At that point the BMS should shut down. 
You could possibly have a faulty BMS.

Hey @Namasaki, finally I order my 12s BMS form bestech and have a question about overcharge settings. Your BMS has 4.28V detection voltage and 4.08V release voltage. Would it be possible to set the release voltage to 4.2V or ist it only possible with 0.2V difference? Because if the BMS would shut off due to regenerative braking with full battery the BMS stays off until the battery reaches 4.08V, or am I wrong?
```

```
You can request a different overcharge detection at the time you order the bms.
I just went with the default setting.
I did a full battery down hill braking test.
The results where:
As I was braking downhill with a full battery, the battery voltage climbed steadily until it reached 42.8 volts.
At that point the voltage stopped climbing and held at 42.8v 
Apparently the bms blocks the charge current at that point.
When I reached the bottom of the hill and released the brakes, the bms trimmed the voltage back down to 42v
The bms did not shut down even at 42.8v, it just blocked the charge current. 
It may be possible that if braking down a very long hill with a full battery so that 42.8v is maintained for a long duration that the bms may overheat and shut down.
When I ran my test, I was only at 42.8 for a very short duration. Probably 1 min or less.
I am running dual vescs with min bat current set at -10a so thats -20 total regen. At that setting, the voltage climb is still not too fast.
I assumed that since 4.28v overcharge detection was the factory default setting, that if was an acceptable amount.
After running my test, there was no noticeable damage to the battery.
I mean we are only talking about less than 1/10 of a volt per cell.

That makes sense, I like the fact that it didn't shut off. But that would mean that even a overcharge setting of 4.2V would be better if the BMS just stops the charge and doesn't power off. But I read  threads about problem with BMS which shut off above overcharge limit. I think I go with 4.25V for safety :sunglasses:

The thing to remember is that if the bms stops the charge current, It most likely is going to cause heat. And if the heat goes too high, the bms will shut off. Although the Bestech bms is less likely to overheat than others.
Most other bms's do not have heatsinks on the FET's. The Bestech does.
The Bestech has a balancing discharge current of 126ma
Most other bms's balancing discharge current is only around 60ma. Including the Battery Supports brand.

30Q's are good batteries and a 12s4p pack with a good bms would probably do well especially in terms of range.
The drawback to using Li-ion cells, besides the size and weight of a 12s4p is that building such a battery requires more equipment and expertise because a poorly built Li-ion battery will not only be problematic but can be down right dangerous.
There have been at least 2 cases that I know of where boards using Li-ion packs have caught fire and burnt to the ground.
Several builders are using more advanced construction techniques such as cell lever fusing to improve safety and dependability.

The performance will only depend on the total number of cells, the capacity and the C rating.
It is always recommended to get batteries with the highest C rating possible regardless of capacity however a combination of high C rating and high capacity is best.
Be aware that C ratings are a not a reliable measure of actual discharge current capability.
That is to say that a 5ah battery with 60C rating cannot really handle 300a
The Idea of multiplying capacity and C rating to determine actual discharge current is simply false.
As far as I know, there is only one distributor of Lipo batteries that states real discharge current capability for their packs.

True, though I was just looking at their inventory, and I think getting four of these would be a better idea than the 2s, and they're in stock, and they would be just $60 roughly more than the ones you linked.

I read this threat many times and I am ready to connect my 3s 7000 mAh into a 10s lipo back.   I just want to made sure I got it right before I begin.  I have 3x 3s lipo packs and salveraged another broken 3s pack to get a 1s 7000mah battery.   So.  3x 3s + 1x 1s= 10s 7000mah lipo.      Any advice and suggestion would be appreciated because I don't want to burn my house down or damage $120 of  lipo.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/70af4a1aa1e2c115c51f3d48f1302d1746d184ae.jpg" width="375" height="500">

The graphene is basically a Lipo battery. You can use a hobby charger.
If you are thinking of making an E-board with 3s voltage, forget it. You need at least 6s voltage.
I recommend the Bestech bms. the Model that I use and is featured in this thread is available for 6s to 12s

Your wiring diagram checks out.
There is very little chance of your batteries catching fire with this type of setup. 
The situations that would make your batteries catch fire would be
1. shorting them out long enough to make them ignite.
2. trying to charge them with too high voltage. ( example: using a 48v charger on a 10s pack with no bms.)
3. exposing the internals of the cell pouches to air or water while they are fully charged can cause explosive fire.

NOTE:
I would highly recommend that you consider batteries with higher C rating because they will suffer less voltage sag and will last longer.
7ah batteries with 25C will work if that's what you have already.

Hi guys,

Having a 'little' problem here
I was recently working on my battery because the negative end had come loose of the BMS.

Now I managed to create some sparks from shorting by letting the negative battery lead touch one of the 'thingies' on the BMS. (see picture) the middle lug of the 'thingy' has the most 'damage'.

This caused some colouring on the solder, but worse is probably that it seems to be the cause of my BMS not fully charge the battery anymore (stops around 68%)...

Could this easily be fixed? Or could it be the case that more hardware is affected?
I don't have a voltmeter yet to test things, but maybe you can give some direction in the matter!

Thanks

EDIT: I created a new topic on the matter but thought it would be good for people to have a sense of where to go to if they face the same problem as me

@MattHarder This is a question that is not directly related to the topic. I would suggest you to create a new topic.
This can be done on the homepage in the upper right corner you find a button 'create new topic'.

To answer you're question nonetheless;
Money vs. quality is your factor now. Cheaping out on batteries is not the best thing though, I would advise to get a 30C rated battery as a minimum to not stress the batteries as much. A BMS is something you need to consider as well
A bestech bms will help prolong the life of your batteries, keeping them balanced while discharging (lipos tend to go out of balance).
But a cheap bms can also be used albeit only for charging (NB not 'discharging') and could go for like 10 bucks, 1/8th of the price for a Bestech BMS.
I would suggest the Bestech BMS and see it as an investment that you'll be glad for making

Rule of thumb for 2s Lipo balance wires. 
Black wire on edge of connector is ground
Red wire on opposite edge is cell 2
Wire in middle of connector is cell 1
On Lipos that are 3s to 6s, the balance wires are always in succession and cell 1 is always next to the black ground wire. 
The red wire on the edge is always the last cell in the pack. 
The black wire on the edge is always ground.

Normally, I just buy batteries pre-packed, or pre-made.  Cause I'm one of those guys you call lazy, sadly.
This is my 1st attempt to make my own.  Starting the the least expensive ones, the LiPo's.

Learned from some articles and videos that LiPo's are some scary sh!t.  One of the most dangerous batteries around.
No wonder hard packs are nice, for extra battery protection. With BMS (assuming in good working condition), will, somehow, eliminate over charging and make it safer.  But still, it does not mean you will let your battery charging unattended.

Anyway, I just got my 4 pack of 10 (2s/5000mah/7.4v 60c LiPo) from hobbyking and will start solder them in series.
So I used my multi-meter to test the balance wires (for curiosity sake).
The cell #1 reads 3.7v, while cell # 2 reads 7.5v. 
So the conclusion is, the lowest voltage reading is the cell #1, and adds up till you reach 37v, which is cell #10.
Since I'm doing the parallel, I'll just match-up the balance wire with the same voltage reading.
Thanks to @mmaner 's crystal clear diagram, I know now where to connect the volt meter, and charger.
Thank you too @Namasaki.

It's a really good idea to balance charge each pack before soldering them together. Especially if your connecting them in parallel.
anytime you connect multiple cells or packs in parallel, they will auto balance themselves quickly with high current transfer that can damage the cells involved.

I have been using Lipos for years, first in helicopters and now in Eboards. I have never had a problem with them catching fire or exploding.
Just use quality Lipos and balance charge them either with a good hobby charger designed for Lipos or a bms and brick charger with the correct voltage output.
Since I've been into Eboarding, I have not seen anyones lipo build catch fire but I have seen 2 builds with Li-ion batteries burn to the ground.
When you stop and think about it, the Lipo build is somewhat flexible.
The welded Li-ion pack is more rigid and consequently, more susceptible to vibration and road shock.
The pics below are both Li-ion builds that just caught fire. The top one for no apparent reason. The bottom one ignited after riding over a very rough road.

Before I did so, I measured all cells, and later the total for the pack which was 41.6v (I actually screwed up the batteries a little bit from charging carelessly, and now 41.6v is the maximum it charges) at any rate... All cells are balanced...

When I check the voltage THROUGH the BMS it reads 40.8v, that's 0.8 less volts. 

Is it normal for the BMS to "eat" up some voltage?

I've never known the bms to eat any voltage. 
Where are you measuring the voltage?
Try waiting about 5 seconds after turning it on before measuring. 
If your batteries are balanced but not charging to full 42v then the problem most likely is with the charger your using.
That is, if your using the BMS and settings featured in this thread

Hey, I was measuring the voltage without turning the BMS on.

Once I turned it on it gave the proper reading.

Side note, I installed the charge port to the -C on the BMS and the positive to the positive that comes out of my battery. As it was charging I turned on the BMS and the charger blew up.

Smoke... Fear... Fun.

So, I advise not to do that to future builders.

Your charger did not blow up because you turned the bms on. 
The bms is supposed to be on while charging per the manufacture's instructions.
I usually turn my charger on first and then turn the bms on immediately and nothing has ever blown up.

Oh crap...

I remember I plugged in the charger to the charging port, and the charger seemed to be making some sort of sound (which I can't recall) then I turned on BMS and just smoke everywhere. I nearly soiled myself.

Anybody know what it can be due to? I'm not sure I should plug another charger in...

BTW used the same batteries, same BMS, a 24 euro 42v 2a charger, and I think even the same charging port for segways, and the connections I'm 99.9% sure they are right.

Double check the polarity of the charger and your charge socket on the board. 
It sounds like you got the polarity wrong.

It was indeed a polarity problem. Everything seems to be connected properly now, except...

This is the charger connected only to the plug in my house <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/7/37803550f0897a55a35753f447418dbee9ed8bb2.jpg" width="281" height="500">
As you can see the light on the charger turns green.

And this is what happens when I connect the other end to the board <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/f/af18c2f098d8e6c36583d0c91950cebb84bf9c9e.jpg" width="281" height="500">

You can bearly tell, but it powers up my focbox, and the light on the charger goes from green to red, and that's with the bms off.

I'm afraid to turn it on, and there aren't any instructions that come with these chargers. Should I just switch on the bms?

Sorry for the shit pictures.

Quick update, I left the charger on without turning on the BMS and saw that the voltage was going up... Meaning the battery was being charged, so I manned up and turned on the BMS.

Battery is fully charged. The joy is unexplainable... It only charges to 41.6v, but still... I'm happy as hell.

Thanks for enduring my constant noobness @Namasaki.

Will open up a thread with my build and pictures when I get the chance!

Thanks again!!

Your Bestech BMS should automatically turn on when you plug in the charger. If this is not the case than I think something is wrong with your wiring.
I can confirm this since I have a battery indicator connected between the pos and neg ports coming out of the BMS
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-monodrive-6374-10s-bamboo-eboard/33460/31?u=gunnark

As to the 41.6v of charge: just because your charger says 42v on the enclosure doesn't mean it will actually charge to 42.0v
A charger or higher quality might, but a 24 bucks charger almost certainly won't.

Cheers

None of my BesTech BMS's automatically turn on when I connect the charger, I have to turn them on to charge.  That's one of the characteristics of the BEsTech BMS that it does not allow any traversal unless the ON/OFF circuit is completed.  I haven't bought one in about 3 months, so it might be different now, but of the 4 that I own none auto turn on.

Mine also turns automatically off as soon as the charging has completed, or so it seems.
Probably the charger that stopped charging resulting in the BMS turning off

Nope haha
I really mean my BMS automatically turns on the moment I plug in my charger. I don't have to touch my e-switch at all!

Then, when I unplug the charger I can see the voltage dropping because of the indicator wired in between and the whole systems turns off.

Before I bought the BMS I read I had to switch on the board before plugging in the charger. Forgot that once and my board magically turned on!

Really like it this way. Now I can spot across the room if it is done charging ๐

The bms only appears to turn on when you plug in the charger because the charger supplies power to the output side of the bms. 
This is why your Vesc turns on and your meter lights up. 
You still need to manually turn the bms on to charge or it will not work correctly.

Hi Namasaki,

What about this BMS?
http://www.bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D336.html
Heard from from a guy from Belgium this one costs around 30 euros a piece while the D223v1 costs about 50 euros.

Would love your opinion or maybe you can shine some light on why this BMS isn't as expensive as the D223V1.
That 10amp discharge difference does not bother me

Exactly!
I was a little stunned because of the price difference and the little specs difference there is.
Only main differences are:
-size
-max discharge

All others are adjustable.

Only reason for this price difference I could think of is the manufacturing since it is not a "sandwich bms" and the slightly lower discharge level

I have not personally used Gens Ace but I have read that they are good quality.
A 60a bms should be fine for discharge.
Other important factors are short circuit protection and balance current. Some bms's offer up to 126ma balance current while others can be as low as 42ma
Also important to know that most bms's have an over discharge detection of 2.8v per cell which is fine for Li-ions but too low for Lipos.

With Lipos, the less you drain them the better. 
This is probably true for Li-ions as well although they can go lower than Lipos. 
The thing is that unless every cell is perfectly matched including internal resistance, they will not discharge evenly. So if your monitoring total pack voltage instead of individual cell voltage while discharging, you should allow a margin of safety.

The batteries you choose will have pros and cons, and in many cases, the deciding factor is cost (don't make that mistake). For me, as well as @Namasaki the decision to go LiPo is discharge capability. As you may already know @Lospalaz the C-rating of a lipo is the manufacturer's claimed max. sustained-current output without causing damage to a cell's chemistry. Depending on how you ride, you may very easily exceed 78 Amps at times, but probably not often. If you are planning on smaller capacity packs, GO HIGH C-RATING, or wish you had later. 

A capacitor pack will not mitigate voltage-sag, at least not for any sustained period. They are more for smoothing out the current spikes associated with switched DC motors (brushless motors). The Cap-pack you linked above is the one I bought, and it's awesome. It will increase performance, but not necessarily in a way that you will feel. What it WILL do is increase the life-span of your ESC, clarify your RF signal, look awesome, and give you more instant-power! 

So my opinion: Capacitors? - get some! 5200mAh 15c LiPos? you should reconsider, but they may be suitable for you...

True,
With dual drive, each motor/vesc handles 1/2 the wattage needed however the maximum wattage potential is theoretically doubled.
This allows you to climb steeper hills with dual motors.
@Lospalaz 
If you fear that your battery can't handle the potential maximum then all you have to do is reduce the battery max amps setting in the Vesc tool.

@Namasaki or anyone:
 
Does bestech BMS 223V1 tend to lose about 0.8V in overall efficiency? Have the spec sheet.

Battery should be 50.3 but instead oscillating between 49.4 and 49.5V

Did you check the battery voltage where the battery connects to B- on the bms?
You know the bms e-switch wires have to be connected and the bms on when charging or testing voltage right?

Hello All
Many Thanks Namasaki for this BMS project 10s1p using Turnigy 2s/5000mah/60c.
As far as I understand you reach 16 miles range with 2 motors ?

I am curious to know How evolve board can reach 50 km range... and I would like to build an 30km range board.
My eskate is 1 motor 6374 3.2kW (from alien) 1 Vesc and 15*36 gear ratio.
With 2 batteries Zippy 5S 8000mAh in serial I get around 16km range.

Does anybody ever build battery system to get 30km range ?
I am thinking to build such Namasaki battery system with 10s2p (4batteries 5S 8000mAh) connected to bestech ?

```
My actual tested range is 14 mile max on flat ground. 
Thatโs running my pack down to 33v and running dual 6355s. 
Mileage will vary depending on rider weight, wind conditions and riding style. 
Stop and go vs constant cruising. 
I also have a build with same batteries and with dual 6374s. It gets less mileage because the larger higher torque motors draw more current. 
I donโt have a single drive for actual comparison but my theory is that mileage will be similar with a single or dual because the load is the same. 
Your just working a single Vesc and motor twice as hard as each Vesc and motor with a dual drive. 
Unless you increase the load beyond the limits of a single Vesc and motor.  Like climbing hills that are too steep for your single drive.

Thanks for info, for sure range depend on weight, flat ground, wheel, wind, straigh road ..

1 or 2 motor should be sligtly the same, I think you even get more range with 1 motor because of electrical switching lose, thermal and coupling lose. 
As example Buffalo board seems to switch long range mode by deactiving one motor.

Hi! This thread has been the inspiration for my own battery build, 4 x 3s 8000 mah 30C Lipos with a 12s 80A Bestech BMS. Everything has arrived at my house, and after a lot of reading Im quite sure about what to do next. I used your wiring diagram and converted it to 12s (the male/female part are 5.5mm bullet connectors). 

![12s Bestech BMS Wiring|690x459](upload://rhRQguPkABN16LW8CZu0vJBjdhM.png)


Having done this, I do still have a couple concerns. I read trough the whole thread and these are the questions I still wonder about. I would really appretiate if you could help me out! :slight_smile:

1. Should I configure my Focbox before connecting the BMS? 

2. At what voltage should the individual batteries be at when connecting to the BMS? At the moment, they are charged to "storage voltage" = 3.8V

3. How do I check the voltage of each individual cell, in the best way? Do I simply unconnect one lead at a time from the balance lead connector (after having connected the batteries in series) and use a voltmeter?

4. In what order should the components be connected to the BMS? Should the battery positive and negative be connected before the balance leads? Should the focbox be connected before the battery? 

Thanks a lot! 

/Alex

Nice diagram!
**1.Should I configure my Focbox before connecting the BMS?**
It doesn't really matter.

**2.At what voltage should the individual batteries be at when connecting to the BMS? At the moment, they are charged to โstorage voltageโ = 3.8V**
3.8v is fine, 4.2v is fine, the important thing is that they are all the same voltage. But that should be done before putting the battery pack together.

**4.In what order should the components be connected to the BMS? Should the battery positive and negative be connected before the balance leads? Should the focbox be connected before the battery?**
First make sure the bms is turned off at the on/off switch connected to the E-switch wires.
Then connect the balance wires from the battery to the bms.
Then you can connect the Battery neg to B- pad and the Focbox neg to the P- pad and the charge port neg to the C- pad
Then connect the battery pos to the focbox positive and the charge port positive.
Once everything is connected, double check your wiring and make sure it's right.
Then turn the bms on to power up the Focbox for an initial test.
After the focbox finishes booting up, turn the bms off and connect the usb cable to the vesc and your PC and then turn the bms on again.
After the focbox boots up, open your Vesc tool or BLDC tool which ever you have and program the vesc.
Remember to turn the bms on when charging.

**Oops, I missed number 3.**

**3.How do I check the voltage of each individual cell, in the best way? Do I simply unconnect one lead at a time from the balance lead connector (after having connected the batteries in series) and use a voltmeter?**
You could first Turn the bms off, then unplug the balance wire connectors from the bms and check the battery voltage at the pins of the balance wire connector coming from the battery.

neg probe on battery neg main and pos probe on pin for bal wire 1 to measure cell 1
neg probe on pin for bal wire 1 and pos probe on pin for bal wire 2 to measure cell 2
neg probe on pin for bal wire 2 and pos probe on pin for bal wire 3 to measure cell 3
follow this pattern all the way to cell 12.
This is one way that you can check individual cell voltages with a multimeter. 
The pins are very close together so be very carful no to touch the neg and pos probes together while testing or you will cause a short.

I'm looking at building a MTB board with dual drive (190 kv 6364 motors) and I was going to use Li-on batteries but I'm now thinking of using Lipos.  I'm going to be using the board in a non-conventional way, on a golf course.  So I don't need speed (10-15 mph) and distance 10-15 miles should be plenty.  The course is rather flat a few good sized hills I would have to go up.  Do you think this setup with get me what I'm looking for?  I'm about 215 lbs and maybe another 15 lbs for my gear.

This thread has actually been inspiration for my first build. Thanks heaps Namasaki for putting the details up here - and an even bigger thanks for staying active in the thread! 

I originally had selected 5x Zippy 2s 8000mah 30c batteries, but seriously considering the 60c 5000mah even with the hit ill take to range. Would it make that much noticable difference to sag or general punch? 60c batteries would be up to 300a discharge, 30c would be 150a. In the real world on mostly flat ground, would this make much of a difference to the feel of the board to a 115kg skater? What would you choose? 5000mah 60c  (theoretical 16km range) vs 8000mah 30c (theoretical 27km range) 

Are the hardcase batteries physically strong enough to provide protection if they were not covered by an additional enclosure?  My gut is telling me dont even risk it, but I need to ask the question.
```

8ah x 30C is 240a but neither that or the 300a for my packs is truly accurate. They are overrated as are all Lipo packs on the market.

Still, My 60C packs work really well on hills and even better on flat ground and though I have not used the Zippy flight max, they should work well especially if your just riding on flats.
The Flightmax are a lot larger than the Turnigy 5000/60C which is why I didn't use them on my builds. I considered them but they where just too big.
The Turnigy's are very compact and the hard case is very strong. I tried to break one open once and had a hard time doing it. 
You may get a substantial increase in range with the Zippy 8000's especially on flats so if you need more range and have room for them, I would give them a try.

Forgive my ignorance: 

In my setup, I have two 4C 5000mah batteries in series. Basically, instead of connecting my  main + & - to the VESC , those will go into the BMS , and then go to the VESC, and my balance ports will (or can) go independently into the BMS, depending on the model...? or am I going to have to determine a certain pin out from there? I have these in an XT90 connection setup currently, but the batteries are barrel - XT90 converted (if that matters)

I don't know if anyone straighten this up yet (I haven't gone through all thread) but I believe this is not correct. You're using 2s battery so serial connecting 5 of them does not make it capable of putting 5 times the current through one of them. Only the voltage goes up. Current limits stay the same.

It has been my experience using the metr Bluetooth module and app that it does not report accurate battery voltage. 
I contacted the seller and app creator about this and he said that the Vesc 4.12 does not report voltage to the module correctly. 
My module and app usually reports voltage about one half volt higher than actual voltage. 
So  you can use the remote to monitor but compare with a multimeter for a reference

[/quote]


Yes, just make a charge cord to plug into the Power supply and your charge port.
Two other points of interest.
1: use a multimeter to check the output of the Lab power supply. Just to insure the accuracy of charge voltage.
2: I have found that when charging with the power supply and the Bestech HCX-223V1 bms it works better when you follow these steps.
1. Plug the power supply in and turn on the main power.
2. Adjust the voltage and current on the Power supply, check it with a multimeter.
3. Connect the charge cord from the power supply to the charge port.
4. Turn on the output of the power supply then immediately turn on the bms.
The power supply will begin in CC mode with the voltage staying just a little above the pack voltage.( this reduces battery heat during the charge process).
Once the battery gets close to the set voltage, the power supply will automatically switch to CV mode and stay at set voltage while the current will steadily drop until the battery is fully charged.
Note: The power supply will not shut off when the battery is fully charged but it's output will decrease to about 50ma. At that time you simply turn off the power supply output (NOT THE POWER BUTTON)
Then turn the bms off and disconnect the charge cord.
Note: If you turn the bms on before the power supply, it has a tendency to confuse the power supply.

I've actually spent about 4 hours reading various post about BMS and lipos together. Tried a couple of different ways that I thought I understood to be correct. Turns out that I'd misunderstood because my BMS started to get pretty hot for a split second. That's what lead me to post. I'm not asking for anyone to do work for me.

Our friend Lucy @bestech came back on the BMS I was going to order one i had found many people in forum have used before and she said that one is no longer available but she has an upgraded one. hcx-d528v1 It has e-switch as well and spec sheet seems to be ok outside the short circuit protection at 480a.  Does anyone have experience with this BMS? Regardless of what i order I will most most likely have an extra one due to the min 2 order. so will post if folks are interested.  hcx-d528v1 ![hcx-d528v1|690x335](upload://1gDhwHacjxg5YOeISxvvIo1eFg5.png)

Well, I just read through this thread... great stuff!! Right now I am just doing some research to see if it would be feasible to setup a 12S2P setup with lipo batteries. 

First, there aren't many posts on doing 2P with BMS... what would be the best way to do this? Can you really only truly balance 1P setups? Would a 12S2P lipo setup be (WAY) too bulky? I don't mind having quite a bit of bulk if it means more range and more available power.

Second question... with an 80A discharge BMS, this limits me to 40A on each vesc, correct? What if I wanted to run each VESC at 60A, would I need a 120A BMS? Or do I have this wrong, and I could use a 12S 80A BMS?

I run my Vescs at 50a batt max in a dual setup and have never had a problem.
The Bestech 80a can handle 80a continuous and  peaks up to 240a.
On a street board with 90mm wheels, it's doubtful that you would every pull even 80a total with a dual drive regardless of what you set the batt max at.
On a EMTB with large off road wheels and tires, it might be a different story.

I ran a test once with12s going uphill at 1/2 throttle using an inline watt meter in between the batteries and the ESC's and I was pulling only 18a from the batteries. That was total current draw with a dual drive.

Then I switched my batteries from series to parallel and ran the sane test on 6s at full throttle and pulled only 36a total.

According to my logs, when I had my battery max set to 40 on each vesc, I would pull 60+A continuous (75A total when full acceleration dropping to 60-65A continuous) very often due to my gearing, all the time accelerating really. I love the power, but my lions sag a bit too much pulling 80A total. Limited to 60, they sag muuuuuch less, but still I pull 60A pretty much all the time accelerating.

I'd love to be able to up my settings to 60A each vesc. I think the amp draw has to do with the fact that I go full throttle often, weight 90+ kg, board weighs quite a bit (numbs my hand after a minute of holding it, lol), and it's geared for 38mph... But 30A per vesc doesn't get me there *ultra quick*. 40A per vesc is a bit quicker, but I'd love to accelerate faster than 40Ax2 does. I tried a few other gear ratio setups, and acceleration wasn't immensely better and top speed was reduced drastically. 

If I can keep my gearing or even lower it more and let loose with the extra amps lipos can provide for all the more power, I'd be in love.

Batteries balance themselves parallely so donโt worry about it. BMS is used for series balancing as this doesnโt occur by itself.

Hi all,

had a couple quick Q:

1) I assume the eswitch wiring doesnt matter (no + or -) as you are just creating loop?

2) Balance cable wiring- I noticed on primary battery pack (+) you start off the balance cable wiring with the red wire in slot 12 for a 12s set up.  I noticed on my diagram and @Namasaki on the last battery the red wire is going to BMS (while ignoring all the grounds) on other set ups i see people skipping the last battery red wire and then using the last ground to run to BMS?  A little confused by this.

thx.

Answers 

1.  That is correct

2. The first cell in series provides the negative main. 
The last cell in series provides the positive main. 

The balance wires start at the first cell and count up to the last cell.

Also since jst ext is 5s i would skip the last two black wires and then start the next battery red wire in b8 same thing to b5 then last battery red wire b4 and same thing down to b1.

The red wire is always the last cell in series of a pack.
So the cells count down from the red wire but the last wire or the wire furthest from the red wire is always ground.

Thanks @Namasaki. I think I have it now, sorry my description wasn't too great.  I am skipping all the grounds on the lipo (furthest from red) as well as the 6th cable on jst ext.  Red (+) wires will be on b4, b8, b12.  Last question (sorry appreciate the help don't want to screw this up) I don't need the final ground to go to b- on bms right?  Just the negative of battery to bms not both.  I saw mixed ways of doing on youtube.

It depends on what bms your using.

Ok, I see your using the same bestech that I used.
With that bms, you don't need to use any of the balance ground wires.
Just run the main ground cable from the first battery pack in series to the B- pad
as shown in my diagram.
That bms uses the main ground instead of the balance ground wires.

remove the charger, let the cells balance down and then put the charger back on
[/quote]

So am I right to conclude that if I leave my board on with the charger unplugged it will balance the battery at a lower voltage than 42V? (for example also at 39V for a 10s setup?) 
If yes, how long do you leave the board on?
You said ''let the cells balance down'', does that mean the voltage of the whole pack will drop slightly when the BMS balances the cells?

And another question: do you trust the switch to turn off the board completely or do you still plug out the battery over night?

Your batteries really should be balanced before connecting them in series to the bms.
The bms trims high cells down to match the lower cells when balancing.
From my experience it appears to do this even when the bms is off.
As far as balancing the cells when the total voltage is below 4.2v per cell, I have not done a conclusive test to prove it however it does appear to do so.

The built in E-switch is adequate for turning the whole board on and off.
I have left my board's sitting in the closet with the battery connected and the E-switch off for more than a week without adding charge to the battery but checking them periodically  and they are holding their charge very well.

This is an awesome thread and just wanted to thank @Namasaki for all his help both in this forum and directly through PM. I have one last issue i am trying to resolve been talking to jens @Nowind as well. Dont see a great forum for this and too many new topics started so figured i would ask here. Hoping someone can help. I will share a video want to get your thoughts of what noise could be. In bench test it seems to be coming through both motors so I am not thinking defective but maybe you can lead me in right direction. Noise happens about 1/2 throttle or more and also when coasting from time to time. 

Set up:
12s1p
Dual vesc 6 in bldc hybrid mode
Settings are well below what motor can output
Checked for loose screws etc

Nothing so far.

thanks Frank but FOC wont work at all...i have tried to configure at least 10 times (no exaggeration)  each time wiping vesc w firmware update and starting from scratch... the behavior is bizarre.  Sometimes, only master vesc will work and inverts direction of wheel, other times both wheels spin in right direction but just go full throttle and lose connection.  ThenI  have to wipe vesc and go to BLDC hybrid to get to work again.  If it try to go back without wiping vesc crazy stuff happens in BLDC mode as well.  FOC seems totally unstable for some reason. Just talked to my motor head friend who works on motorcycles he suggests 

Chain too tight causing lateral torque
check bushings/inner motor for vibration/markings
check motor mount and cog/gear alignment using laser
balance tires on a spindle

so guess i will try that.  If anyone can explain the FOC madness happy to listen and try again.

It inverts direction because one motor is pointed to the left and one to the right. There is option in vesc tool to invert it so both go the same way. Try to go FOC one more time, invert one motor, configure CAN, properly configure remote and tell us what happened.

Problem is when i connect them either both spin in right direction at full speed then dies out or only master spins i can usually control for a few brakes/revs then that revs up and dies out.

I would do the detection with very loos chain. I would compare the values the same VESC measures for both motors. Then do the same with the other VESC. Especially the resistance and Lambda are of interest.

This way you can see if one motor or VESC has a problem. 
Bench tests do not give a lot of feedback, since VESC use current control.

Are you doing detection with drive train on?
If yes, try disconnecting the drive train.
too much load on motors might cause detection fail.
You also might try replacing the bearings in the motors. They can cause a lot of noise.

what voltage are you using to do motor detection?
if your using 12s, that might be the problem with failing detections.

Yep 12s. It worked everytime before today who knows though i have an old lipo lying around i can try. 5.5hrs and im in a worse spot then before. I can get foc to recognize now by changing detection values. Same prob as before though once its all hooked up one push of remote and it goes haywire and cuts out thats with or without sensors. Now when i try to go back to bldc even with clearing firmware and changing to same values that works with foc i get bad detection error. Give up for today. Thanks for help everyone.

Hey everyone. 20 hours later there were two issues that i think may be solved. The first was setting up master on one vesc and then changing master to other vesc and despite using vesc tool to clear it, it never really forgets setting @trampa said to use stlinkv2 to flash and seemed to fix the software issue. (Thanks Frank) Next issue photon remote receiver. Even after flash it would rev up and shut off. Was about to lose hope but my man @namasaki sent me a mini rc remote and it paired and worked for 20 min flipping power to board on and off many times. No issues. Have to take a test run to declare it fixed but looking good for anyone who gave a sh*t. Thank you everyone who helped me through this certainly some really good trouble shooting tips for future sufferers. Cracking beer to celebrate what seems to be fixed.

Hi,

I know this is a year later but I'm making my board now. I have a similar 10S set-up however, I was planning to buy a BMS from ebay with 60A over discharge. There is no e-switch though. My plan was that I connect the balance cables to the BMS. Then the negative wire of the charging port to the C or CH port on the BMS. Then this guy I saw on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yrYG5skwvs&t=1043s --- 9 minutes in) has some "extension cable" which has +/- wires connected to xt90s (apparently used to be JSTs). One end of the xt90 goes into the series adapter xt90 from the 2 batteries (2x 5s) and the other end of the xt90 goes into a ON/OFF switch (then VESC).

As for the added +/- wires on this "extension cable", as said before the positive wire connects to the positive of the charger port and the negative goes to the B- port of the BMS. 

I also wanted a monitor so if i connect the negative lead of the monitor to the B- port and the positive lead to where the positive wire of the charger port and "extension cable" positive wire had joined. 

I would really appreciate your comments on this. I would be very grateful.

thanks
```

The Supower 60a bms is a good choice and can be used with an external E-switch or a Loop Key to turn your board on and off.
I personally would not use a low amp bypass bms like the one shown in the video you posted.
My reason is that when you bypass the bms during discharge, you cancel it's ability to protect the battery from over discharging and from short circuiting.
Sure you can use the vesc to protect against over discharge but the Vesc can only monitor the battery as a whole.  A bms monitors each and every cell or cell group individually.

I also believe that the fewer high current connections you have, the better.
I solder my packs together in series and the main ground from the battery is also soldered to the B- pad on the bms with no connector in between.

Thanks for the help. I saw the diagram you posted about connections with the BMS. It may have been on a different thread. I'll follow that too but what I said in my previous comment about the connections, does that seem fine in terms of proper connections. I think negative "extension cable" that goes to the VESC should go to the P- port but is everything else seem good?

Iโm having a little trouble visualizing your description. 
Better if you draw a diagram and post that. 

Bottom line, my advice is to keep the wiring as simple as possible with as few connectors as possible.

And Iโm not sure if your aware of this but you canโt just use any old switch on the high current circuit. 
Youโll need an antispark loop key or an antispark E-switch

Note:
You can leave the balance ground wire on Battery 2 disconnected. It is not necessary to connect it anywhere.
Clip it short and make sure the end is insulated.
Another important point is to make sure you cut balance wires one at a time or else you will short the battery.

**WARNING**
Be very careful with this type of setup at least until the characteristics of this bms are known.
For example, braking on a full battery especially down hill.
Or durning hard acceleration.
The bms could shut off leaving you with a sudden loss of power and no brakes.

Thanks so much.

I've seen on other videos that they connect Battery 1's balance cable positive first (at the bottom of your diagram in this case) and they cut the positive wire on Battery 2. 
However, I assume its different for every BMS right? I've seen my BMS's diagram and see how it relates to yours. 

If i do have a separate port for charging, I just connect the negative of the charge port to the C- right?

Lastly, If I were to have a monitor for the battery percentage where would I connect that.

Cheers man,

I named the batteries 1 and 2 in relation to the sequence of cells 1-10. 

Itโs not really necessary to name them at all. 
What is important is that the pack supplying the main black cable is cells 1-5
And the pack supplying the main red cable is cells 6-10
It is critical that the balance wires are connected in this sequence because if they are not correct, the bms will smoke.

There doesnโt appear to be a C- pad. 
When there is no C- pad, the charge neg hos to P-

I will add a meter to the diagram when I get home from work. 
It should go like this
Meter red between loop key and Vesc 
Meter black between bms P- and Vesc 
Then the meter will only be on when the loop key is connected

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=658&v=wIbHLacozFo

In a perfect world, cells in parallel will automatically balance each other. The bms will see how ever many cells you have in parallel as one cell.
If the cells in parallel are not matched in terms of true capacity and internal resistance, then they will probably  not charge and discharge evenly.

It is my opinion that a 1p battery is the best scenario for balancing.
This is one of the reasons that I prefer Lipos to Li-ions.

I'm ok with with medium range of 10-12 miles so a 10s 5ah battery works for me.
People who build for maximum range usually use Li-ion cells.

I believe it is better to use Li-ion cells for a multiple P battery because with Li-ion cells, all the the Parallel connections are made before the Series connections. This simplifies the balancing process because all cells in parallel automatically balance themselves and the bms will see each group as one cell.
And each P group will automatically and continuously balance itself even when the board is off.

With four 6s Lipos, the series connections are made before the parallel connections. 
This rather complicates things. 
You can parallel the low current balance wires.
But you can not parallel the high current connections between each and every cell.
There have been some who have done this but I'm not sure how well it worked out over time.

Gens Ace Tattu makes some high capacity Lipos that are very good but not cheap.

Canโt say for sure. Theoretically, itโs supposed to start balancing when the pack is fully charged. 
However from what Iโve seen, it appears to balance all the time, even when turned off. 
I have not done any tests to confirm this.
The balancing current on bmsโs is minimal and varies depending on brand and model. 
Some balance at 126ma some only 60ma
These are the top brands. Bestech and Supower. 
 Cheaper brands could be even less.

Whats your opinion on the batteries? Thinking about going 12S (4x3S), ZIPPY Compact 5800mAh 3s 60c (70C burst) to be specific. Maybe a 10s setup with the batteries linked by @Namasaki is better because of the higher burst (120C)?

In theory (Im aware of the fact that manufactures overestimate C number ALOT) my suggested 12S setup would be able to deliver 348A cont. and 406A burst. Can't really compare this directly to the 10s setup as 12S wont need as much current draw for the same power delivery...

You can use connectors. 
Hard wiring just makes a cleaner setup and a more sure connection for maximum dependability and minimum resistance. 
Note: that it is still possible to check and even charge packs individually while they are connected in series. 
I have done this with mine. I disconnect the bms when testing and charging individual packs using a hobby balance charger with charge cables that have alligator clamps.

rated for 150 amps.  With bullet connectors we used to use male on one battery wire and female on the other to prevent accidentally plugging them in wrong and heat shrink on the females to prevent accidental shorting.  That was 10-15 years ago - not sure if that is still best practice.

I plan on making a similar setting using either 5 or 6 of these in series with a bestech bms.

I plan on running one of torque boards' 6380 motors and an Ollin vesc. It is my first time building an esk8, and I think I might need the power from a 12s setup because I live in a very hilly area, but I'm not sure if one motor would be able to handle it. Should I go with the 10s or the 12s?

```
The difference between 12s and 10s is mainly going to be a voltage difference. Voltage is more like "horse power"

The second numbers (3p, 4p, 5p, etc.) is your capacity. Think more of "gas tank".

I know this isn't the exact definitions for both of these, but thats the easiest way to get what changing around your batteries will do.

So if you went from 10s4p to a 12s4p, you may see a bit of range increase, but if you went from a 10s4p to a 10s5p you would actually see a much larger increase.

The main reason you'd see an increase in range going from 10s to 12s is that you have more voltage "headroom" to play with. The sag that you will inevitably see won't hit you as fast as a 10s battery would.

[/quote]


Running 12s will increase power and can also increase range because range is determined by voltage and capacity.
For example:
6s/10ah will theoretically  have about the same range as 12s/5ah.

Although as @Itsmedant mentioned, going from 10s to 12s is not likely to make a big difference in range but will supply more power for hill climbing.
Keep in mind however that higher voltage can be harder on electronics. Make sure you run heat sinks on your vescs.
And really if your planning on building a hill climber, better plan on a dual drive. A couple of 6374s will supply plenty of torque.

They should come with all cells at 3.7-3.8v
Check every cell before putting them together.
If any pack has a very low voltage, it is suspect as defective

five 2s vs one 10s

Size constraint is the main factor however there is also the matter of maintaining the overall battery.
So if you have five 2s packs and one cell goes bad, you have to replace two cells.
If you have two 5s packs and one cell goes bad, you have to replace five cells.
If you have one 10s pack and one cell goes bad, you have to replace ten cells.
Because when one cell goes bad in a Lipo pack, the whole pack is done.

My roads are pretty rough. They paved them cheaply (by putting down gravel and pouring tar over it) so there are a lot of loose pebbles. As you can see in the picture, the drive wheel has worn down a lot from only 3 hours of riding. I was able to climb a 35% grade hill today, but wasn't able to get down without skidding. Yesterday I wasn't able to get up the same hill. I think the bigger contact patch from the worn down wheel and front wheel drive helped. Also, this is my first board, so it took some time to get used to riding  it. The more I rode the board, the less it skidded.

Graphene's have a reputation for being good but I have never used them.
I doubt that there is a Lipo battery in existence that will deliver what it's C rating suggests.
I also doubt that you can eliminate voltage sag completely  with a battery that will have a reasonable size and weight for an Esk8.
The only thing you can do is try to reduce voltage sag as much as possible.
Lipos are good for short to medium range with maximum power and minimum sag in a relatively small package.
Li-ions are the usual choice for long range batteries.

5s packs are thick and using 6 of them for a 10s3p is gonna be a very bulky and heavy battery.
My very first build used 2 6s packs for 12s1p 5ah which got me about 10 miles.
I had an enclosure that I could open to swap batteries out quickly.
So I carried extra batteries in my back pack and had a total range of 30 miles.
I used a hobby charger to charge my packs outside the board.
That's just another option if you don't have the resources to build a Li-ion battery.

When you buy them, they will come at 3.7-3.8 per cell for shipping.
When you get them, you need to check the voltage of each cell individually.
It is possible to get a battery with one or more cells that are under minimum voltage.
It happened to me twice buying zippy lipos.
If you get a battery like that, the seller should replace the pack.

Iยดm on my first build and would like to get the wiring confirmed. 

![IMG_5643|666x500](upload://qTZ5sfiL61m6SW4qvqKaljsVjrH.jpeg) 

My batteries and balance wires are a bit different. I will put 5x 2S2P in series to get 10S. Iยดm confused with the balance wires, the batterie has one more connection in the middle, what is it?

![IMG_5642|666x500](upload://gi421m298ofuy7eIxNKDBguM28k.jpeg) 

Also my 10S BMS has 11 wires, one is black. Iยดm not 100% sure where it goes. Is it right to have it on the negative of the first batterie? All the other negatives are not connected, right?

![IMG_5644|375x500](upload://wsBZisCFSOLrZOqbjMd9mYfyKy9.jpeg) 

Would be very appreciated if someone can have a look and confirm, that it is right like that. Thanks a lot.

Three more questions:
1) Does I have to disconnect the loop key while charging?
2) The BMS doesnยดt have a on/off switch, will it drain the batteries over time? Should I place the loop key somewhere else?
3) Does I need a inline fuse somewhere or is it enough to have overcurrent protection in the BMS

The orientation of your balance wires and main wires is correct.
Removing the loop key during charge cycle will stop the esc from powering on and is not a bad idea.
I'm not familiar with your BMS or the amount of drain it will impose on your battery.
You could put a 2nd loop key on the battery negative main and run a jumper from the B- pad to pin 0 of the balance socket if the the 2 are not already connected in the PCB.
Then you could disconnect the bms by removing the key.

Awesome, thank you very much for your time.
What do you mean with "run a jumper from the B- pad to pin 0 of the balance socket"? Pin 0 is the black one on right? With jumper do you mean to connect them? What is it doing if I connect it? Maybe instead of the Loop Key I could just pull the main negative out of the battery if I wanna store it for a longer period of time.

Like this (added green wire)?:

Yes, Like that.
That way you can stop all current flow through the bms when you pull the key.
Now I can't say for sure that the jumper is necessary. It depends if there is continuity between the B- pad and pin 0 through the pcb.
It may be that pin 0 is an optional ground used when bypassing the bms for discharge so that you wouldn't have to use the B- pad at all.

You could (with all battery wires disconnected) test for continuity between the B- pad and pin 0 with a multimeter.
If the meter beeps then they are on the same ground and you can omit the jumper.

Thanks a lot for a clarification @Namasaki,  now I'm tempted to go all out with 16s but it sound ridiculus...
Not sure if I'd ever need that and How I'd charge it. Plus I have to buy two and have no clue about what to do with another BMS, electrify a bike?

I have one more question, do you know of any other way or source of purchasing that particular type of BMS in 12S config? Or is Alibaba my best shot and I should just stay patient and wait?

You can order directly from Bestech or create 
a thread in the items wanted category to see if there is one available from a forum member

Just a heads up, bestech arent answering emails... i must have tried 5 or 6 times over the past couple of weeks, from different email acounts, and to their info@ and sales@ accounts = nothing :roll_eyes:

If anybody has any ideas on how to get them that would be great

Try http://litechpower.com/BMS/ it's a little longer ship time but there is no minimum qty required. 

Bestech and litech are the same company.

Hi, I've got one more question. Is this BMS: 
http://litechpower.com/product-detail/HCX-D596LF12S.html

going to work fine with a pair of these:
https://www.rcdetails.info/en/details/11204

also is it possible to receive guidance on how to connect it to vesc6 and BMS

The simplicity and bang for buck of this setup is really amazing. I was able to use this setup with the 8000 Flight max to make a highly flexible build with range well beyond what I would generically use in one session.

Gearing up towards my second build and I still come back to this setup as the only one easily made flexible and essentially as thin as a 18650 battery pack. Thinking about LiPo's at 2200 for an ultralight commuter.

can someone explain to me what will happen when i connect 5 X 2s 3700mah Lipos in series. I know that it will create a 10s battery but what i don't understand is what will happen to the current. Will i end up with a 18.5Ah battery so therefore pretty good range, like what will happen?

```
Series increases voltage

Parallel increases current/capacity

In series youโll have a 10s 3.7ah battery

With Lipos  the C rating is very important 

A 10s 5ah battery can deliver decent range and power if the C rating is high enough. 
I run 10s 5ah 60/120 C and it delivers good power and 10-14 miles depending on many factors.
