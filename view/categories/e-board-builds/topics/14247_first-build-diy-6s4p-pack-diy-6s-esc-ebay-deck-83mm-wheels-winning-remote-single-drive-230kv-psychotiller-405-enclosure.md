I finally built my first board! Man is it fasthat and extremely fun. Max speed of 21mph which is way more then I need or want to go. I climbed a 20% grade hill with no effort on the boards side. I already want to jump to 97mm wheels for more ride quality. Do I need a 40t wheel pulley for that size wheel? Also when I charge the board it kicks on the esc even with the switch off. Is that normal @torqueboards do I need to install a loop key?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/d/fdea42ee18e56962a605df2224c90c53ec6e90eb.jpg" width="690" height="388"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/1/f1fda86685c2e718f73d3de7e80ae8f65172fd33.jpg" width="690" height="388">  [Uploading...]()

How much do you weigh? A single 6355 doesnt have the most power I would think.

I am 220lbs rider weight and climb big hills on my commutes, so 12S is a must! 

Great build! I have a friend on a similar build path! Well done. 

What deck is that?

It's a ebay deck. I actually got impatient and was riding last night and caught a hole in the side walk and snapped the deck right at the front wheels so I will be buying a good deck

I like the shape of that deck. How wide are you making it?

That looks like a great shape! 10 ply should give a really stable ride quality at speed.

I hope so! I was thinking about going with some 97mm wheels. You think I would be ok keeping the 36t wheel pulley if I have massive amount of torque now with 83

With the same wheels as yours I'm going with a 40 to start with. I have some fairly sustained kill climbing from Denver to Lakewood. Not very steep hills but constant.
