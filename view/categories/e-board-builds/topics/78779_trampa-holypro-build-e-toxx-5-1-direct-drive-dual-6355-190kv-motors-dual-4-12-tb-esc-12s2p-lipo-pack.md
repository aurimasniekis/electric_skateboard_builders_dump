Hello all,

I am new to this but have had a lot of help from the local DIYers in Sydney.
This is my build.

- Trampa holypro 35 deck
- Infinity hangers with superstar hubs and 8inch all terrain tyres 
- 2x TB ESC 4.12 HW
- 2x 6355 190kv 2500w TB sensored Brushless motors
- e-toxx Direct drive 5:1 Ratio (Thank you @Nowind)
- 12s2p lipo battery, 10 000mah (turnigy)
- TB nano 2.4ghz remote with reciever
- Flipsky anti spark switch 

This build has a crazy amount of torque and no battery sag. I am unsure of the top speed and range but it has successfully done 15km without issues. 
Currently setup with a canbus connection for communication between esc's.

I wanted to share my build with the other DIYers in the forum as I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did putting it together.

Oh yea=P
I saw the Youtube videos that E-toxx put up about a year ago and I said I want one. A year later I built my own with his Direct Drive setup
