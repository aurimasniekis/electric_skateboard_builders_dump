Hi guys,

I have been reading the forum for a while and trying to figure out what my build will consist of but I have made little if any progress.

To avoid assaulting you with a wall of text Ill try presenting information in a structured way.

# CuriousSavage's build

## purpose
<br>

mostly cruising around for fun, maybe for commuting from the subway to work/home.

## rider
  ~170lbs

## location
  SF bay area (east bay) - Its kind of hilly here but its mostly flat where I live. There is one place I might like to use it to get to that is up a hill.

## wishlist 
_in order of importance:_

* **easy to maintain** - I would love a board with a charging port/bms so I can Just plug into a laptop charger.
* **range** - rethinking this, I originally wanted really long range (15-20 miles) but to be honest I doubt I will be going on really long rides
* **speed** - maybe **15-20mph** top speed (not totally sure how fast I will be comfortable with ). Not really a daredevil so going really fast is not a priority.


## Budget

~$400-$500

the lower the better (to keep the wife happy). But I understand that quality has a cost so willing to bite the bullet a little.

## parts I have

* [the deck](http://www.ebay.com/itm/172466124794?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)
* [caliber trucks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NY42714/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Orangatang Kegel wheels](http://www.ebay.com/itm/332077791599?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)

as of 1-27-16. i have ordered:
* vesc from axle (mentioned below)
* (motor from electric-skateboard.market](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/)
* ordered the batteries mentioned below too
## parts I'm looking at

* [motor mount](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Electric-Skateboard-Motor-Mount-63mm-DIY-Aluminum-Caliber-Truck-Compatible-Kit/152399972223?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D2220071%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D40778%26meid%3D96922202a7934af8a70eed41f32f7e98%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D6%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D112235240870)
* [possible batteries ](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-2s-7-4v-60c-hardcase-pack.html) (thinking of copying @Namasaki with his battery solution [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014))
* [bms](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html) ( again for if I follow the above mentioned battery build )
* [GT2B controller](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html) ( I hear this one is reliable, and I can put it in a smaller case)
* [vesc]( http://www.ebay.com/itm/112235240870 ) where is better to buy? (from the US)
* [m&e2k^281a^lKZpotor] (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) got this from the [enertion guys youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yBgsT65UPg) was almost going to just jump and buy what he says to in the video - before deciding to come here and consult you guys.


I'm not really set on any of these parts. To be honest I kind of got lost while trying to research this. 
I know the battery I'm thinking of building only sort of matches my wishlist so I'm willing to consider other options. I looked at the space cell and the 6s4p epower pack. If I have complete plans I wouldn't mind building my own pack. I'm just not sure if that's a great idea. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who drops in here.

I agree with @Charster10. 
Ollin Vescs are top quality and they come with a warranty. 
I've been running a pair of them for some time now and they have been very dependable. 
I highly recommend getting the optional heatsink package. 
It's pretty easy to get 20-25 mph and 10-15 mile range at 10s voltage and 5000mah capacity using Lipos with a high C rating.

As long as you know what you're doing and read a lot before messing with your vesc you should not need a warranty. I say save some money and buy from DIY, axle or vanda. I have a DIY VESC and wasn't very happy with the quality but after replacing a few connectors that were mishaped by too much heat, trimming a few through hole legs that were poking into the main leads and reflowing a few components that had cold joints, it looked solid. If I had no experience with electronic, I would have 100% returned it as it was just a matter of time before something in it burned or shorted. 

If you don't want to deal with this kind of stuff. I recommend you buy from ollinboards. I would still do a very thorough inspection of it though. 

I would get my motor from @JLabs. Only thing is it doesn't come with any hardware but i see your mount does. 

You're still missing a pulley system too.

thanks everyone for your advice.

One thing I'm still a little unsure about is some motor mounts say they only work with certain motor sizes. The Turnigy motor I listed says the diameter is 59mm but the mount says it only works for 63mm motors. 

No idea where to buy pulleys or how to choose too..

@Namasaki will I have enough space with a 26" wheelbase for that battery?

## \#8 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-01-24T07:42:50.420Z Reads: 294

```
my shortest wheelbase is 32"
I'm sure 26" is doable but you will need to use either A123 26650 cells or Lipos in order to get enough power with a small enough footprint.
The problem with that 12s2p 18650 li-ion pack that your looking at is  it will only deliver 40-50 amps max.
I tried running 12s when I started. Yes, its noticeably more powerful than 10s but it was not very dependable for me.
I've been running 10s for a while now and it's plenty fast enough and very dependable. Everything runs cooler on 10s, motors and electronics.
With your budget, you would probably be better off with Lipos. 
The 5 lipo packs I used on my build only cost around $130. The BMS I'm using was only around $60
I would highly recommend getting e-skate motor from one of the vendors in this forum.
63mm is the standard. The Hobby King motors will work but I just think the motors sold by e-skate vendors are better quality and they're not that much more money.
Diyelectric is a good source in the USA fro 63mm motors
Allienpower if your in the UK or EU
Enertion if your in Australia 
I'm currently using motors from Allienpower.
They're shipping to USA was pretty fast.
I have also used Diyelectric's 63mm motors and they are good as well and have 8mm long shafts which give more options for pulleys.

the round thing is the power switch. the red square circuit board is the meter.
Alien Power systems used to sell Bestech BMS's. Don't know if they still do or have any in stock.
You can order directly from Bestech but they have a minimum 2 per order. The good news is that their delivery time is good and they accept PayPal.
Here is an example of total cost:

I don't think it's really necessary if your just building a battery for your own use.
It's a good idea if your building batteries to sell as a business.
Are you gonna build a Li-ion pack or a Lipo system like what I have?
I've built and used both and in my opinion the Lipo system is easier to build and maintain and delivers a lot more power than Li-ions pound for pound.

Or I can give you the email for my sales contact if you would like to order direct. The minimum order qty is 2 modules.

Below is the spec sheet showing the adjustable values.
When you order, you will need to specify the values you want for those.
They are only adjustable at the factory.
Lucy will send you a spec sheet with recommended settings and you will need to request the over discharge voltage set at the max 3.0v for use with Lipos.
The maximum for over current detection current is 240a
Apparently, this module can easily handle 80a continuously and up to 240a peak.
It is probably the most robust BMS currently available to us.

For a controller, I recommend this one. It's every bit as dependable as the gt2b and is very compact.
the trigger action is precise and smooth. It runs on AA batteries. If you put AA lithiums in it, they will last for up to 1 year depending on how much you ride.
I like the fact that i don't have to keep charging it all the time or worry about the battery going down.
And the steering knob is removable making it more compact.

@Namasaki I got my batteries in the mail! They have a sticker on them that says to charge them back to storage charge asap. Since the bms is not going to be here for a while do I need to get a lipo charger to make sure the batteries aren't harmed?

I wouldn't be surprised if we got the Bms's in a week or week and a half. Bestech is fairly quick on delivery. And this is my 3rd order with the same sales rep. and she has been very good to work with. I sent her a couple emails this evening and she answered them within minutes.
I'll let you know as soon as they arrive.
As for the batteries, did you check them with a volt meter? HK doesn't usually send batteries with full charge.
3.7-3.8v per cell is good for storage voltage.
It is a good idea to have a hobby charger though. You want all the cells to be the same within 1 or 2 tenths of a volt when you connect them to the bms. Because if any of the cells is way off then the bms will not be able to balance them.
I experience this once when one of my packs got a loose power wire and I had to replace it with a new pack.
the new pack was at storage voltage while the rest where around 4.0v and the bms would not fully charge.
I had to hook my hobby charger up the the new pack and charge it up by itself.

well, I have my controller and a pulley kit coming from https://electric-skateboard.market/

I am trying to figure out the best layout right now since my board is on the shorter side. I think the bms should fit length wise right beside the vesc since its about 3x5 inches. It will be a little tight with the other boards like the remote receiver but it should all fit!

Next thing to figure out is the wiring. Looks I'm going to have to get a bunch of connectors. Not sure what kind is best. The vesc has 5.5 bullet connectors going to the motor and a XT60 connector. So I think I will just need a female XT60  and a few more bullet connectors also something to split the wire where it goes to the bms.

Well I tried real hard to get all of the soldering done today but I was too slow. On the bright side my dad told me to get some flux which made it way easier. Just need to solder the jst connectors to the bms balance port wires.

I'm tempted to add bullet connectors to make it easier to disconnect the whole battery pack. Almost started to put them in between each battery but I decided that was overkill. Its probably pretty rare that they get unbalanced right?

Also noticed that in the picture above you don't have the charge port connected. Did you just splice it in where the wires branch off to the VESCs ?

```
The pos wire from the charge port splices into the pos wire from the battery. 
The neg wire from the charge port goes to the C- solder pad on the BMS. 
Take your time especially when connecting the balance wires. If you get the cell order wrong, it might fry the circuit. 
Double and triple check.

[quote="curioussavage, post:47, topic:16474, full:true"]
well, I have my controller and a pulley kit coming from https://electric-skateboard.market/

I am trying to figure out the best layout right now since my board is on the shorter side. I think the bms should fit length wise right beside the vesc since its about 3x5 inches. It will be a little tight with the other boards like the remote receiver but it should all fit!

Next thing to figure out is the wiring. Looks I'm going to have to get a bunch of connectors. Not sure what kind is best. The vesc has 5.5 bullet connectors going to the motor and a XT60 connector. So I think I will just need a female XT60  and a few more bullet connectors also something to split the wire where it goes to the bms.

It might be too late, but don't need to solder your battery cables to put them in series. Just modify the HXT connector by carefully cutting the thin plastic between the two leads.  The HXT then becomes a male/female 4mm bullet connector with protective housing. You can directly connect the positive of battery 1 into the negative of battery 2, and so on. Very little bulk

I tried that option and it was more bulky and didn't leave a clear space for the balance wires. When using a low profile enclosure every mm counts. Besides, less connectors=less resistance.

Ok I ordered a voltage meter, should come in 2 days. I think I have the VESC configured. Not totally sure about that though. The motor page on the motor tab where you set limits is where I didn't know what to do. just followed the torqueboards guy's video, but he kind of breezes through that part. hall sensor detection failed but I think that's not really needed?

tempted to go for a little test ride but I haven't secured the bms. Not sure how I will too. I have the batteries secured with industrial velcro. Not sure if that is a bad idea for the bms.

You need to secure the bms. You can use servo tape or electronics grade velcro strips.
I used velcro strips for easy removal if necessary.
hal sensor detection is only if your using a sensored motor and connecting the sensor cable to the vesc. If you run sensored motor, you have to connect the 3 phase motor wires in exactly the correct order or you will fry the motor and possibly the vesc.
My advise is forget about running sensored.
It is not advisable to go for a ride outside without an enclosure to protect the batteries and electronics from flying rocks and sticks.
For vesc settings, I run my motor amp max at 80a and battery max amps at 50a
Also, you will need to get some automotive weather stripping to make a gasket for your enclosure to seal it otherwise it will get a lot of dirt inside.

Ok good to hear. I'm surprised it has so much go even though I didn't charge it past 38. I have to be careful with the throttle when I'm already up to speed or it almost throws me off! 

I'm assuming there is a way to limit the throttle in the vesc software. I would definitely need a longer deck to push it to its top speed too.

It did just fine going up a pretty steep hill near my house, even at 36 ish volts 


Another issue I had was when I got to the cutt off voltage set (around 34) when it just cuts out it's really jarring. Then as I was pushing it home I accidentally pulled on the throttle and it threw me off. Haha

I just did a range test and got 13.5 miles on flat ground. Top speed 20 mph. 
That brought my battery from full charge to 35v at rest. Still didn't trip any low voltage protection 
I went another .6 miles to try to hit 14 even and brought the pack down to 33v. At that point the Vesc started cutting power. 
Still I'm really stoked to get over 10 mi on a 10s/5000
I think 35 or 36 is a good stopping point. 
I believe draining lithiums too low is much worse than charging them to full.
When I get home I'm gonna pop the hood and check each cell to see if they stayed in balance

@jmasta @Namasaki I've run 10s3p 7500mah li-ion 25R's and 6s2p 5000mah lipo's in the same board and I get identical range, within half a mile or so.

The lipo pack provides a lot more torque, so I assume I'm loosing watts on the li-ion because it hit the throttle heavier on hills. 

I'm going to test with the 30Q cells too.  But if I had to decide today I would sell the li-ion pack and build me a lipo pack with x4 8000mah 5s lipo packs (10s @ 16000mah).

It's really hard to guess what your maximum mileage will be. I did not expect to get 14 miles out of my battery even on a flat run.
On a run with lots of  hills I only got around 10 miles.
My Li-ion pack was 10s/9000mah it got me 28 miles on flat run going 10mph or less but it got no more than 10 miles on that run with lots of hills.

I think the issue is voltage sag. Because Li-ions have such a low C rating it takes a lot of them to eliminate the sag.
Some have said that the 30Q cells are better but they are only rated for 15a per cell. So a 4p pack is only 60a.

When I drew very little current from my Li-ion pack it did fine but when I tried to draw more current, it did very poorly.
It was supposedly a 60a pack.
The 25R's are suppose to be 20a cells but maybe they are overstated
I'm am looking forward to see what your results are with the 30Q cells.
How big a pack are you making?

30Q cells are rated to 15A due to life cycle. This is straight from the data sheet.

And remember this is continuous. We do not run continuously at these power settings so temps won't be nearly that high. They also charge at 4A per cell, on a 4P pack that would be 16A so you're going to gain some cycles by charging slower

This is real world data... tested independently by Henrik and I've confirmed his data with my own on several different battery chemistries including Samsung 30Q and 35E LG HG2 and MJ1, Sony VTC6, and Panasonic/Sanyo B and GA cells

The voltage sag in the graph above is the voltage difference at a specific used capacity. For example, if you used 1.5Ah/cell and then went from no-load to 10A/cell, your voltage sag on 25Rs would be 0.4V per cell and your voltage would be ~3.6v per cell at no load and ~3.2V per cell at 10A per cell. 

On the 30Q at the same discharge of 1.5Ah per cell, there is a voltage sag of 0.25V per cell when drawing 10A per cell. Voltage drops from ~3.7V per cell at no load to ~3.45V per cell at 10A. 

IF your voltage limits are set at 3.2 and 3.0, this means that you would hit this limit with your 25R pack regardless of having 1Ah left in them while your 30Q would still be going strong.

I don't get how this is not real life application data...

If you're using the same motor. The lower voltage will have a lower max speed limit. The higher current will mean more losses across wires etc, although it should be able to produce more torque since your current availability is higher. 

You can also tweak this in your VESC settings by increasing your max motor and absolute current settings. Power in = power out. So you can accelerate at ridiculous power by messing with your motor current settings. 

For example, you have 36v and 60A available from the get go, that's 2kW. If you set your motor current limit low (40A) then at 10% throttle, you will hit that limit and won't be able to use all the power available from your battery. If you set it high at like 150A, you will get more power at the low end. I forget what the math was. Just search for devin's threads... it'll be the equation posted about 50 times per post and 1000 times per thread

Unfortunately after a quick ride I found out I broke the part of the motor that attaches to the mount. So now I have a nice fully charged battery pack and a no motor :( looks repairable but I might just go for a new motor and try to sell this one for parts.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/7/37147933738abc1ccbce0ec8fcdf40bcd0249cd1.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Thats's a bummer.
Did the motor run into something?

I wish I could say that, but I was dumb enough to use a screwdriver as leverage between the motor and the mount a few times and that is the result.

What did you need leverage for?

Couldn't really get it as tight as I thought it needed to be with one hand while tightening the belt. Maybe I just have weak hands from years of carpal tunnel  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Ok, I'm pretty sure the belt doesn't need to be that tight. Snug should be plenty tight enough.
I don't even run mine snug and they only skip if I brake extra hard.
9mm belts dual drive.
If you run it too tight, it will put a lot of stress on your motor bearings and likely cause you to have a decrease in performance.

Looks like you still have 3 good mounting holes on your motor. 4 are not required.  It might work just fine as is. Worth a shot! 

If not, you should discharge your battery pack to storage voltage. You don't want it sitting a full voltage for long

Tightening a belt so it plays like a guitar string?
That is just too tight for any belt.
All that's gonna do is cause your belts and motor bearings to wear out quicker. 
Or cause your motor casing to break.

I played bass a little, I mostly played a 5-string banjo (bluegrass).
I play a little ukulele as well.
When I said "like a guitar string" I meant that he is using the same method.
But still, your e-board belt doesn't need to be that tight.
That is gonna create more stress on your system than you want.
You should be able to squeeze your belt with your fingers and have it move at least 1/8" on top and bottom.

The real test will be how long your belt and bearings last. or if the mounting end of your motor breaks.
Just think of the side load that guy is putting on the motor shaft tightening his belt like that.
