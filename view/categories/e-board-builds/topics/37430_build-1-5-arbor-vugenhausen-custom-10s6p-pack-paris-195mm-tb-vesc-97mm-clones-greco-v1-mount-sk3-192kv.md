Nothing has even been done with this yet and nothing will be done on this until 2018 because...
#I Have Made My Last Esk8 Purchase of 2017!

Anyways, I already have most of the parts for the build, mostly upgrading the normal longboard and aesthetics side of things here since my current build has all the performance I need/want at the moment, just looks fugly as **HELL.** I'll take some pictures in a few minutes.
Heres the google doc with all the parts on it:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1amhYvhid_SuIjAOaVGBnaJNP5bvntsCThP2JYfVHzBo/edit?usp=sharing

any advice is welcome!

Anyways, ive decided to swap out the blank deck for something a little more substantial, the Arbor Vugenhausen. Mostly because the shipping on the blank deck was half the price of the board. Oh yea, @mmaner also had an extra one laying around :wink:

Pro tip-Use washers on the three mount screws. Your bolt heads are eating up the mount.

it‚Äôs a bit of an optical illusion. they are eating the mount, but I also drilled it out for m6 + nylock so that‚Äôs why it looks so much bigger

It's not coming loose but the likelyhood of it snapping is rather high I would say.

Because chewing into the mount isn't good. It's going to break. If you'd like, I can show pics of about 15 boards. None of the mounts move. and all of them have smooth surfaces. If you use washers, Loc-tite, and apply proper torque the first time they wont move even if you hit stuff. (curbs) 

That type of damage consistently occurs from over tightening bolts without the use of washers and loc-tite. 

Not trying to bash you (like my mount there), Trying to help. Your shit doesn't have to look like shit.

i was asking about the motor screws.

I am aware of the risks of doing it my way and if it does break, I will make sure to publicly announce that it was not because of bad mount design. I tried everything with the stock threads, blue loctite, red loctite, still came loose after 15-20 miles. i haven‚Äôt had a problem with m6 and nylock yet.

you know that i‚Äôm bad at doing stuff the right way (hence the entire installation process üòâ). I now have access to (or will very soon) my own mounts. so I won‚Äôt be begging for another one if this does end up breaking

the 10s6p MF1 came out of balance. 3p 25r has the same discharge in a battery that weighs a quarter of the size.  30q was gonna be a bit more expensive.  if i decide that I don‚Äôt like the 25rs i‚Äôll sell and grab some 30qs

25R are great batteries. I'm sure you'll like them. I have both a 10s4p 25R pack that @barajabali built me  over a year ago now and it still works perfectly. I also have a 30Q 10s4p pack in my Raptor 2. What's weird is that I get more miles out of my 25R pack. Probably just a difference in efficiency of the motors or something. I actually haven't figured out which pack I like best.

You just need to pass by the place you're heading to, take a few turns, and then keep on going. Then at some point later, just turn around and go back. lol. :)
