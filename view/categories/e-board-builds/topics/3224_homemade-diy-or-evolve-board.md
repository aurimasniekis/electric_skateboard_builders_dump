Hi guys just sold my motorbike as I really want a decent board. Was looking at the evolve bamboo boards that I really like as well as the raptor but so expensive. Can someone please give me some ideas of what to do for a diy build, parts list etc. Ideally I would like 25mph and as long a range as possible. 

Thanks in advance

How much time and learning are you feeling up for?  Convenience comes at a cost.  Building it yourself is fun and rewarding if you are up for the challenge, but there is a lot to learn and lots of tinkering.  What are your mechanical abilities?

Realistic budget?

Yeh I quite fancy having a go at building my own and I'm not bad with my hands. I just don't really know what parts I need for my requirements. Budget is about Â£800 but the less the better. 
Quite like the idea of having all terrain wheels also but depends on cost etc. 

Thanks :slight_smile:

Look through the builds on here.  Staying single drive will save a lot of money.  Order a VESC now cause it will take at least a few weeks if not longer.

Basic Parts list:
Deck
Trucks (ones you can get a motor mount for)
Wheels (80mm Kegel or 83mm Flywheels or clones, wheel drive pulley needs to match these)
Motor
Motor mount
Pulleys (Motor and wheel)
Belts
ESC (VESC)
Batteries (10S or 12S)
Control Solution (GT2B, Wii nunchuck.....)
Various bits of 10 and 12 gauge wire
XT60 or similar connectors
XT90 Anti spark for loop key

That should get you started.  I put a few of the popular choices, but there are many ways to come to a solution.

You are going around posting the same battery in multiple threads.  Make your own thread if you want to talk about a battery that is no different than what is currently available.

You are obviously promoting your own business.  That is considered spam.

helping how? the "best battery" statement is your opinion, and opinions are like certain holes, everyone has one... opening an account to promote your stuff is spamming.

Enertion has a bunch on order, but might be another month or more.  I am still waiting since February.  There might be somewhere closer to you, but I got one from Ollin Board Co recently and it is working great.

If you need batteries, buy Hobbyking Multistar LiPos, they work great, are light and cheap. No need for yet another middleman.

There are other options on the market.  From my research and use the VESC is very popular and has a lot of features.  I personally got a VESC from Ollin and love it.

@akira People don't go spamming their products everywhere throughout the forum. Just make a thread. Thats what everyone else does.

that battery you sell on your site is the sanyo NCR18650GA that you just rewrapped and gave your own specs,

ok on to the specs

**evergy**
**3.5AH and 4.2V - 2.5V**

this is true now the false claims

 **weight**
**51g** 
no the max for this cell is 48g anymore and its fake

**charge**
**1.6A**

no max is 1.45A

**dicharge**
**20A max constant**
**10A cruse**
**and 35A burst**

no 10A is the max it can do anymore is its burst and running at 20A for more then 10 seconds will put you in to thermal run-away


so we have one of two problems here either the cell you listed is not right or you are fluffing the specs to make it look good

either way this is bad because this puts people in danger.

and on that note

@barajabali or @treenutter could you ban this person for pushing a product on our forum that puts people in danger?
