Hi guys, this is my second post.
I'm trying to build my own carbon fiber mountainboard (electric 6.5kW)

this my configuration
(starting from the top of the board):

* 1x plain carbon-kevlar 188 gsm 0°/90°
* 1x twill carbon fiber 200 gsm +45°/-45°
* 2 x ud carbon fiber 200 gsm 0°
* 1x twill carbon fiber 200 gsm +45°/-45°
* 1x ud carbon fiber 400 gsm 90°
* 1x twill carbon fiber 200 gsm +45/-45° (#)
* Core (3D core PET 5mm)
* 1x twill carbon fiber 200 gsm +45/°-45° (/)
* 1x ud carbon fiber 400 gsm 90°
* 1x twill carbon fiber 200 gsm +45/°-45°
* 2 x ud carbon fiber 200 gsm 0°
* 2x plain carbon-kevlar 188 gsm 0°/90°

Plus the reinforcement on the two bends (starting from the top, each side) the pieces to reinforce are about 250mm (to cover the bends):
* here starts the '#' layer
* 1 x ud carbon fiber 200 gsm 0°
* 1x ud carbon fiber 400 gsm 90°
* 1x twill carbon fiber 200 gsm +45°/-45°
* Core (3D core PET 5mm)
* 1x twill carbon fiber 200 gsm +45°/-45°
* 1x ud carbon fiber 400 gsm 90°
* 1 x ud carbon fiber 200 gsm 0°
* here starts the '/' layer



it would be maybe 9 - 9.5 mm

(0° means fiber aligned with the long side of the board)

what do you think about that?  Too stiff? Too flex (I don't think so)?
the shape is really like the Trampa board and since it has to go at around 60 Km/h it must be strong enough

here some pics, the mold is made up of MDF covered with epoxy and it's really smooth (in the pics the release agent it was not dry).

Looks like a great project, join us on the more active forum for some real feedback. I'd start this topic there with a bit more info about your deck manufacturing experience, tools, etc.
