I think most people would recommend dual 6355 190kv motors with dual vescs and 10s as the best all around solution.

You will need 1 more VESC, 1 motor, 1 motor mount, and 2 pulleys/belt, CAN bus / servo splitter cable, and an XT90 power splitter. 

For motors you can run another 6374 and mount it on the opposite side of the trucks or get a smaller 6354 and mount is next to your current motor. 

I am currently running a launch sale and you can get $5 off a 6354 or $10 off a 6374 when you subscribe to our mailing list.

With 9mm or 12mm belts it should! If you have 15mm belts it will be too much.
