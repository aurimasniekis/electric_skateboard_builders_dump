making a board that will be 33" loaded tesseract truncated on calibers with a 10s 3p with s2 bindings fitted for jumping and stuff. which is better 9abec 90s or kegel 80s?
want to be able comute on the board too but wanna keep the weight down. anyone know the weights each tried searchin google no luck

Pick the softest urethane as possible...abec11 has you covered in that aspect, very smooth, grippy and comfortable. Kegels are nice too but don't offer as smooth ride as the abec11 counterparts. Also, the diameter is as important. I'm using 97mm Abec11 atm and I'm very very happy with them. I'll probably get the 107mm wheels next year, 74A urethane should be even more comfy and smooth.

I would think that they are close to the same weight as the hub in the fly wheels was specifically done to take the weight off the core.

Kegels run really smooth. They are offset so the outer lip deflects and absorbs vibration a bit better than the flywheel. The kegel core is also a "house" core so we are going to see a lot of eskate specific wheels hitting the market very soon at a much better price than the flywheel line. Take our Ollin Popoca for example, it is uses the same hub as a kegel but is a centerset 90mm 78a wheel. A lot of other companies will soon follow our lead and offer other wheels using this core. You will have many more options if you start off using kegel type pulley adapters.

Thanks for the explanation.

But all things considered (that is local pavement, streets in general) I find a much smoother ride with bigger and softer wheels. I just run over basically everything. 

I'm more intrigued with going the 107mm route than 90mm route. And 78A won't ever feel as soft as the 74A anyway.

Nevertheless, those Popocas look really dope and they would make my board look so much better than the green/orange Abecs, that's a fact really. ;)

my board is 33" long with s2 bindings for doing ollies/180s/jumping curbs etc.. 97 or 107 would look strange and definetly weigh more 107s are like a kg

true also have enertion bringing out the street and crossover wheels which are gunna be based off the kegel core as i emailed them yesterday and they said along with justin when i asked on the faebook live chat that kegel wheel pulleys will work.

Durometer between wheel manufactures is always a little different. Our 78a wheel feels similar to a 75a flywheel. @bigben to me our popocas feel softer, what do you think? Might feel softer due to the wider lip?

They feel sticky, soft and very good! 
Absolutely nothing like a set of abec clones I crossed paths with.
Thanks for sending these out, I was crucified with import taxes but the kids will thank me with their new boards. One has kegels and the other lucky one will have the popocas!

Popopca, Kegel, Abec

Just a shot for comparing contact patches. Kegel and Popoca are almost identical width, there's just a lip on the Popoca and the lip is rounder than the Abec's. 

For commuting over 3 miles I personally would go with 90mm -- the extra size helps a lot with comfort and surviving bad conditions.

What @chaka said. I'm hoping to have a wheel similar to the popoca but much wider sometime in 2018. I'm in agreement for the standardization of a core type, and i prefer the Kegel style cores. I'm hoping to have a 6cm or wider wheels with an offset core in 90mm at 76a or about that. 

i've been riding around on the popocas for a few weeks now and i love them. Crazy awesome wheels.

i may need wells though. At first i didn't have any bite but then i leaned really hard at some point and it bit.

I'll have some finished later this week. This is the version we will use with our drive but we are making a bolt on version too.

Alien also sells a nice adapter/pulley set. Fits the Popoca perfectly!

Keep in mind a rounded edge like on the 107's is much better for electric cruising because it sheds rocks to the sides instead of being impacted or changing directions when a rock hits the edge of a sharp lip wheel like the kegal...I personally really like the 90mm flywheels in classic thane for longer efficient rides with a lot of hills and I love my new 107's in 74 reflex thane, I hope they won't chunk as easily and the sides are nice and rounded...I put on over 60 miles and they still have skin, that's nuts..bigger is always better on eskates, for terrain and safety alone, I mosh over railroad crossings with my 107's without a care now, the longer my rides the smaller the wheels seem to get in my head and harder, the 107's after 40 miles seem small, trust me, you want the biggest wheel you can afford or fit on your board..90mm flywheels is where I would start, making the square lipped kegal at 85mm only useful for speed runs or unique applications, like sliding..commuting and comfort, go for the abex11 reflex thane in the largest size you can find..for those DIY guys looking for something new or innovative, we need some Siesmic Speedvent wheel pullies please, get them made and modeled, the Speedvent in Defcon thane is what the long distance ultra skaters use and they are even faster and more efficient than abec11 in those large sizes...also, we can use lathes to round the edges of all wheels used in electric skateboarding, so someone take a set of kegals to the lathe yo..downhill guys have wheel lathes and mod wheels all the time for the rain or whatnot..

Also, the diameter is as important
[/quote]

Width is often overlooked.  With the F1 SuperFly I can sail right over railroad tracks for example, not because of the 107mm diameter, but because of the super-wide contact patch.  Going over them at 45 degrees, my wheels never fall into the grooves.

I personally prefer a narrower contact patch on my eskates and a wider on my regular skateboards, the narrower patch reduces rolling resistance and extends the range of your battery at the expense of traction or cornering..depends on what you are doing or building for..

Thanks @chaka

http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/orangatang-kegel-and-similar-hub-adaptor/ 
This looks really nice: $38

http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/htd-5-hub-drive-pulley/ 
swappable pulley: $30.15 available in 32T or 36T, 9mm or 15mm belt width.

Shipping to California: $28.84

So, around $100 more or less total. I really want 44T though. I will be patient and wait. :)

What is the diameter os the pins that go into the core? Since the hole is not constant diameter Iâ€™m having a hard time in what dimension to use to have a solid fit but not crack the core

Siesmic Speedvent wheel pullies please, get them made and modeled, the Speedvent in Defcon thane is what the long distance ultra skaters use and they are even faster and more efficient

I'm using 3d printed pulley to use these wheels. 85mm bubblegum. Like them over others in similar size.

The holes are .25" in diameter but you need to make your pins a little smaller. 

.23" should still give a bit of a friction fit.

Thanks, I always used my 3D printed pulleys with pass through screws and I plate on the other side, in my new board I will press in the pulleys stell pins that goes in the wheel, pretty much what you do on your setup to have a cleaner look

On a printer you may need to sand the pins to get them to fit or scale the pin diameter down until it fits. Really depends on how well your printer holds calibration. If your z-axis induces any ringing in your print you will probably need to drop the diameter down to .21 or .22 inch.

Yeah, the holes always came smaller, but i'm pretty used to my printer to include the compensation on the drawing. The pulley bearing will be moved to the center of the belt path and will be a spacer between it and the mount

Yes, that is how we do it. Takes all the "play/flex" out of a bolt on pulley.
