I‚Äôm ordering
Loaded Fattail deck
Kegal 80mm wheels
Revenge torsion trucks

I‚Äôm going to start with those components and ride it before I order the esk8 components.
I‚Äôm thinking:
Maytek v2 remote
Torquebords VEC‚Äôs
Racerstar 140kv motors
10s 2-3p depending

Let us know how it rides! Maybe if you find it too shallow, put a long distance fixed truck on the rear?

I wrote a post about it. Its really my main reason for this build.  I‚Äôve used torsion trucks and kick tails exclusively on esk8 until recently when I got a boosted board. I hate the lack of manuverability. Revenge seems to be the only reputable company still making these type of torsion trucks.  I‚Äôm going to build it and put it up against other configurations to prove to the world or maybe just myself that torsion trucks can outperform standard trucks in certain applications.  Or maybe they will suck..  üòÇ Stay tuned..  LMAO..

You need to check out these then, popular in rear traction trucks for LDP skating..torsion trucks are only as good as their bushings, sort of like all trucks, but you cannot go out and order a super high quality bushing like I can for standard rkp trucks, these Rohas I hear have a great bushing.. http://bradenboards.com/products/trucks/<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/6/06c62e335f472bb7d251fc08bffd376efaa17037.jpg" width="690" height="460">

I‚Äôve got issues..  I set out to order racerstar 140kv‚Äôs knowing that the 200kv were not suited for my needs. As I‚Äôm looking at the motors an extra dose of testosterone must have entered my system and I compulsively order the 200kv...   
 I just tried to cansel the order but it already shipped. I‚Äôm 45 I never want to go faster then 25mph on a skateboard. The extra 60KV is going to do nothing but chew up my battery and screw up my breaking... üòñ

I just kicked it around with the Revenge trucks..  First impressions are not good.  I‚Äôve cranked down on them way tighter then I expected and they are still too loose.  They are not like my Exkate trucks.

The Rojas Axle flexes and doesn‚Äôt look ideal for a motor bracket with its small diameter.  The Dr tongues look the same as Revenge and I expect same characteristics.  Not sure there are other torsion options on the market.  I have exkate trucks but why bother riding trucks that I can‚Äôt get bushings for.  
  When the weather permits I‚Äôm going to experiment with standard rear trucks and the revenge trucks on front..  However I think I‚Äôm also going to order a set of double kingpin trucks.  I haven‚Äôt given them much thought because they look bulky and kinda silly but they may be exactly what I‚Äôm looking for..

Try a rkp with tall bushing maybe, the arsenal, bolzen, roque and so on..they provide alot more movement than a standard longboard barrel without all the slop that comes with doubling the kingpin..

I can buy new old stock exkate boards on Ebay for $60 bucks shipped and throw out everything but the trucks.  I‚Äôm not going to do that though.  I‚Äôm not going to be stuck in the past. If there wasn‚Äôt a better option they would still be making them.  I‚Äôm reserching and looking into the trucks the others guys here are recomending.  Right now I‚Äôm taking a second look at original brand trucks and gullwing double trucks.  My budget is limited so unfortunately I can‚Äôt try them all..

Gull wing sidewinders are meant to be pretty good same with evolve super carve trucks. They just aren't very stable at high speeds because of the double king pin

I‚Äôve got the revenge trucks on just the front of the boosted and the meepo.  For me its an improvement. Way more maneuverable but its not great and bad for beginners so I‚Äôm taking it off the boosted so my friends can ride it safely.

Hey did you try ronins? For me are the best trucks out there with difference, also they are not crazy expensive. I did use revenge for carving a lot and I love them, but is true, first time I rode them i was like WTF! It took me some time to know how they worked, I think to carving and pumping are good, but absolutely not for esk8. The good about the Ronin is great manoeuvre at low speeds and really stable going fast!

I agree with the Revenge trucks. I‚Äôve looked into ronins and they seem to be a great truck but I‚Äôm specificly looking for a very tight turning radious.  From what I see in videos neither ronins or surfrods are going to do what I want.

Tight turning radius equals a high truck angle nothing more, maybe take a look at the Carver cx trucks and learn how to wedge bennet vector trucks, Don't trip makes variable angle baseplates for very turny trucks as well, a torson trucks doesn't allow for more angle than any other type of truck..a 50 degree rkp with tall bushings will turn a lot more than you think.

Can an rkp at 50 degrees with a high bushing really make an 8 foot circle or less in the street on a 38‚Äù deck?  I‚Äôm not saying its not possible but I‚Äôll be surprised when I see that happen.

Its been bellow freezing and It will be a wile before I collect enough parts to start building so I‚Äôm taking some time to learn ‚ÄúAutoCad Fusion 360‚Äù.  I‚Äôve been wanting to model and 3d print parts for a long time.  Just finished loosely modeling the Fattail.

I‚Äôve been looking at Carvers.  I wouldn‚Äôt call them a conventional RKP truck. The C7 has a different front truck. Looks like it pivots on a stack of washers.   I‚Äôm riding on unmatched trucks now.  Front and rear turn a different radius.  I prefer they were symmetrical but they do the job.  Rear RKP for stability and front torsion for maneuvering.  

Carver C7 front truck

That's actually a spring in there not a stack of washers.

The Carvers C7 is a tkp, meaning TKP is the pivot configuration, but the baseplate has an extra spring loaded pivot to provide more carve.

the Carver CX truck is what I was referring to, which is a rkp truck, the pivot is in the reversed configuration and it's typically paired with a tkp rear truck with a low angle like the Tracker RTS

Carvers are an entire different breed of truck designed for a surf feel above all else, the CX and C7 on any board will make it turn in a tight circle, the tightest I have seen on any skateboard. They are made for a short wheelbase in order to provide a surfy feel but they can be used on longer wheel bases without an issue. You are limited in width options though.

I have ridden both trucks a lot and use to commute on the CX to work, the CX is more stable and better for longer wheels-bases and more conventional skating and the C7 is a pure surf machine, perfect for the completes they put together with short wheel base...

you wouldn't happen to be located in the boston area would you? I'm currently witnessing a blizzard that will probably mean another week without being able to ride. bummer haha. I actually have a loaded fattail that I mounted the newest Landwheel drive to. it's a ton of fun to ride- the flex absorbs shocks super well and the kicktail is a must for getting around the city as well as quickly picking up the board for getting on trains and such. Good luck with shoveling!

The extra 60KV is going to do nothing but chew up my battery and screw up my breaking
[/quote]

You can fix this issue with gear ratio to end up with the same top speed and torque. Though that solution has its own issues, large wheel pulleys get too close to the ground and small motor pulleys are more prone to belt skip and wear out faster. So lower KV is still the best way.

All in all the board is great. It beats the Boosted in torque speed and range but.. there are a few adjustments I still need to make.  
1. The board does close to 30mph. Thats faster then I want to go.  I‚Äôd rather have more starting torque so I‚Äôm going from a 34 tooth to a 36 tooth pully.  The motor is 13 teeth. 
2. There‚Äôs alot of that cogging thing going on if you try and transition from forward to reverse at slow speed. I‚Äôve made adjustments but I‚Äôd like to do a bit better.  Ultimately I want it to preform as good as the Boosted,  however I realize that may be to much to ask from sensorless motors. 
3. I wasn‚Äôt able to find 12mm belts so I‚Äôm using 9mm.  I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll hold up as long.

In my opinion what makes my build unique compared to other builds is my choice of batteries.  I‚Äôve built several DC motor boards with drill batteries but this is my first modern VESC BLDC build.  I‚Äôve built several 18650 packs for other things and I‚Äôm always dissapointed with the BMS‚Äôs I don‚Äôt know of any that are capable of charging a battery as well as a real balance charger. The BMS‚Äôs I‚Äôve used have had lots of glitches.  
I‚Äôd love a space cell but on my budget it just doesn‚Äôt make sence to make that invesment on one board that I will almost never need more then 5ah at a time.  
Advantages of using Makita batteries
I can build a bunch of boards and use the same batteries to power them all.
The batteries are premium, inexpencive and available everywhere.
I can carry extra batteries for long hauls.
I can use batteries for many purposes (work) and justify buying many
I don‚Äôt have to deal with BMS issues and premature battery failure
I can take my board on a plane

I've experimented with Dewalt, Milwaukee, Ryobi, Makita and a bunch of others, and Makita is the best option for a bunch of reason .  great cells (SONY VTC 30a discharge,  quick charge,  great build quality and customer service) ...but the best part for DIY is that Makita sells their Terminal part:

(https://www.ereplacementparts.com/terminal-p-719473.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwhLHaBRAGEiwAHCgG3nPdTSd634D7i5GSnwxY08WgW_wzdrJ-6PZGG1OuaGWjQtrFk26E7hoCPk8QAvD_BwE) . 

separate so it's easy to add to a 3d printed part.  much more sturdy than having to glue in small terminals ends like some of the dewalt ones...  just be sure when running in series that you start with both at equal charge, otherwise the low voltage cutoff won't take affect and there's a chance of overdischarging one of the packs
