Pretty stoked how my build turned out.  Craigslist board for about $40, various leftover parts, and some used parts bought from the parts market here, 3d printed parts, and a rebuilt broken Boosted XR battery.  Took about 4 months compiling parts etc.

Boosted XR batt I traded another batt for it.  Originally all I wanted was a non-functioning Boosted XR for the case only to use for my version of a Foosted Build.  This XR had some blinking red light error code so it wasn't worth anything to the owner.  After I pulled it apart the cells were out of balance but in good shape.  I think the BMS was fried.  I installed a d140 charge only BMS.   I think this was the biggest success of the build as I haven't seen this done.  Boosted uses 18650's in the XR in a 13s 2p format and charges to about 54 volts.

I made channels for the grounding strap under the grip tape to supply the vesc.

I think I'm a single motor convert now.  More speed then I need, with less of a power draw.  This is fast AF with the Torqueboard 16t motor gear and the big motor delivers plenty of torque.  I love the flex of the deck for carving.

Awesome build man, glad to see some mono drive advocates. I like them best for the reasons you pointed out. Suit my needs better being cheaper, lighter, less power draining. Also really like the dervish. Was the longboard back in 08 that made me want to buy a new skateboard again.

This is my first single motor with the motor mount tightened to the Caliber truck .  Man, the tolerances to have the motor gear aligned with the wheel gear is super tight.  Any miss alignment and the belt will rub the wheel, or the mount.  There must be a better way then this...   Aren't vibrations from the road going to constantly shake this mount?   I may try a cheap Ebay chain drive.

After a few km the belt sort of naturally gets worn down by the wheel I think. On my setup when I switch belts it almost always ends up sliding a bit against the wheel, but after a ride or two it no longer does :man_shrugging:
