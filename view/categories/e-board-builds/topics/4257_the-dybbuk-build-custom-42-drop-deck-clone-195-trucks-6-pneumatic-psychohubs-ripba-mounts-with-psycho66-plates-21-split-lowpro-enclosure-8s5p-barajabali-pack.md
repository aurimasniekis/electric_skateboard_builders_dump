Work in progress:

Running two Winchester 12s 120A Sensored Esc's

Running a custom 18650 25r pack from @barajabali 

Still haven't decided if I'm doing dual rear or dual diagonal.

Still haven't decided if I'm using Ollin's sensored 5065 motors or my sensored 6374's which should be here soon...

Wow, looks fantastic. Btw on the decision for 18650 pack vs Lipo flat, I say go with the custom.. That seems to be what u accel at.
Also if u go Ezrun, the series now has an attachment that u can get to show stats on ur phone: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/phone-monitoring-for-motor-battery/4198/1

That is a great looking deck, and it's great to see the hubs in action! Really cool build.

Would you use dual 6374's? Do it!

Www.psychotiller.com

Time depends on interest. We have 3 sets pre sold already, I need a few more sets to make the machining worth it.  And so you all know, this isn't a money grab. I made under a dollar per set on the last group buy.  Then, I included extra stuff so I actually spent money.

@psychotiller

Are most people rocking these with single or dual motors?

I'm assuming the dual setup gets you faster acceleration and stronger braking.  Is that right?

How fast have you taken this beast?  How does it handle at higher speeds compared to a regular setup?

Any videos??

I'm only guessing that most people are going to go dual for the torque..still waiting on build threads from everyone that bought them the first and second round. @mccloed is running a single tacon with success. I'm still building the dybbuk . Maybe by months end it will be done.  😱

Have you ever thought about making a bigger amount of those awesome wheel hubs so that it's cheaper? I'd absolutely love to get some, but 350 bucks on wheel hubs isn't something I can afford (and I imagine a lot of others are in the same boat)

Yes I have. I know exactly how much it would cost me in overhead to order and store 500 sets of wheels all so a few people could get a set for 100 dollars cheaper. But I'm not going to take out a second mortgage to do it. Do you have 20 grand sitting around and want to partner up? Seriously, this is as cheap as its going to get.  How about this? You make billet 6" wheels and sell me a set at a reasonable price. Let me know! I'm interested.

You get what you pay for...
Just the setup and tooling costs alone had to be pretty hefty. Is that cost already amortized into the selling price? Hopefully you got to recoup that $$$ from the last batch. Reorder should be a little cheaper. You deserve to have some skin in the game though. There's nothing wrong with making some profit on a solid design. No one sees the time and thought that you put in, but that may be the most valuable part of the whole deal. Who else is doing this? NOBODY....
These are easily the most high end ESK8 wheels that I have ever seen. No shit...

I wasn't trying to tell you how to run your business, just asking if it was a possibility. Unfortunately I don't have 20K lying around and I don't have experience machining metal parts, but I do respect the effort that I know you put in the work that you do.

Transparency...it costs 23.80 for one piece of my hub. There are 2 pieces in every wheel. That's 8 pieces in every set. Add tires 70, tubes 10, bearings 10, pulleys 12 and all of the stainless hardware to hold it all together 5. The time spent dealing with machinists, logistics 35, pressing bearings, assembly, packing and shipping everything by myself $$. $350 is a deal.

The only reason I do this is because I love board sports. Some stuff I make I'll make a few bucks on. Some I make because I like the feed back I get. I love our community.

It won't get cheaper from me for two reasons. I'm not here to mass produce and saturate the market.

And I'm making my parts in the u.s. at all costs.

We made an abs mount clamp for the lights and a mini enclosure for the batteries.

My personal experience with those trucks is they only turn a tighter radius than other trucks. In every other aspect the cheapest off the shelf trucks out perform them. And seriously?  Randals with nice bushings Waaay better.  Then there's Surfrodz and there's no comparison!

The "super carve" trucks are really good for fine tuning the carve with so many options for bushings and adjusting. The bushings last for a long time, I just put lithium grease on them every few months to keep them responsive. They come greased when new. I can understand people like the std truck because that's all they know. I have many long boards with all different trucks. These are by far my favourite for carve and feel and adjustability.

You should stick with them if you like them! I've been boarding since 78 and have tried lots of different truck ideas. Those trucks are just cloned gullwing sidewinders.  Nobody liked them before evolve marketed them because they felt like they were washing out in turns and wobbled like crazy at medium speed. 
No need to copy them again...
