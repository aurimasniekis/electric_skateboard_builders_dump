I love how low profile and fitting the eboosted enclosure is! Feels very durable as well.

I havnt thought of a name yet.... maybe it doesnt need one :man_shrugging: 

more posts coming when my ideas need fine tuning

also yes im well aware that wheel is on backwards, I just wanted a quick shot for a little more meat on my post :V
