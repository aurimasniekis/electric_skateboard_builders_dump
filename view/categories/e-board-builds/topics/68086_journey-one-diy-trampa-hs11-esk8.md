First of all I would have never been able to make this happen without the help of a handful of very generous users:

@Eboosted
@dg798  
@Idea
@stewii
@mmaner
@Namasaki
@JLabs
@Andy87

The board was heavily inspired by eboostedâ€™s Phoenix. Very similar setup.  It took me exactly 5 months to build from start to finish.

This ended up being a serious beast to figure out how to build and heavily exceeded my expectations on the skill level needed to make it happen. I have a small background in electronics and I learned A LOT from this project. I chose Journey One as the name represents the journey of the knowledge and frustrations I went through to complete the build.

Trampa HS11 deck 16 ply (Iâ€™m 205lbs and the flex is perfect)

Dual BKB 6374 3200W motors with sensor wires

12s4p 18650 Samsung 30Q built by @Eboosted 

Dual ESCapes

D596 Bestech BMS

Torqueboards Nano remote (love it) 

Board with only @Idea â€˜s motor mounts and @JLabs â€˜ motors

Made my own hall sensor extension wires, used these on my first test run and they were fine but ended up making some other/longer ones when I changed the location of my ESCapes from bottomside to topside

Soldering together some XT-90s; connecting the ESCapes to the battery. @dg798 made me an extension but I ended up needing another cable length so I figured out how to do it.

Opened up the ESCape housing to wire in the battery meter

First time I got power (after burning through a BMS, literally, it caught on fire after wiring incorrectly)

Carved out a slot for the battery meter

Originally had the ESCapes underside, this was a bad idea, I went off a curb and the box was smashed, no damage to ESCapes though.  I ended up switching to the seahorse SE56 housing topside which you will see later

My charger; a customizable voltage limit protector that I set to 49.9 volts. I soldered the whole thing together after checking eboosteds YouTube channel

SE56 seahorse housing. Love this thing.

And some pretty shots. Wow what a difference hall sensors make. I didnâ€™t have them on my first test run and then got them going afterwards and the throttle AND release are sooooo much smoother.

I donâ€™t have top speed or distance but I took it 1 mike up a 9% grade and it was going so fast I wasnâ€™t even half way on the throttle. When I came back down the battery regenerated 15% ish.
