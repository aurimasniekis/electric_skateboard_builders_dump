First build done! Only took 7 months to figure how :stuck_out_tongue: Without this place this never would have been possible. Big thanks to everyone that helpped. ![0319190037_HDR|281x500](upload://pMucRKYPRlRvizz1BFEYg7q1rDa.jpeg) ![0319190037a_HDR|281x500](upload://6qm55RPJbe7U1mUYGy3V9PyG6C4.jpeg)  10 minutes after finishing the board I crashed it while testing. Fitting that the board is named kamikazi ![0313192322_HDR|690x388](upload://6gvEJHQ5t5V4ITBkWaEArS5ox5i.jpeg) Cant wait for the weather to warm up a bit to give it a real test.

Odd, I thought those kind of glass panes had that chicken wire inside of them? How'd the glass just fall out?

It didnt fall out. It exploded out. It was a costly durability and accidental speed test.
