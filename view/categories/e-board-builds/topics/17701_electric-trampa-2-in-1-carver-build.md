So I think I am far enough along to actually start a new thread for my build.

I fell in love with the versatility of the new evolve GT 2 in 1 and decided I would see if I could do something similar/ better. After some research on the site I discovered trampa urban carver and the Evolve GT killer project  began. I had originally settled for a top mount battery setup with 2 5s lipos but before I ordered I stumbled across kaly's street carver and decided that would be a much cleaner, although maybe more difficult route, to mount the battery on the bottom, just as he did.

Timing was perfect as @Kaly just started offering the same components the he used in his street carver build.

So far I have
1. Complete urban carver board from trampa
2. 2x 6355 230kv sensors motors
3. Full dual mount mechanical setup
4. Bottom mount battery enclosure

Still need to purchase
1. 2x vesc
2. 40x 18650 (25r)
3. Gt2b remote
4. Bearings and wheels for the street setup ( so it can be a true 2 in 1).

Imo i would get kali to make the battery and enclosure.
It's not only functional but looks stealthy.
I myself have a battery and enclosure from him

Great advice! I was planning on building a similar design but it ended up being cheaper for me to buy directly from him. Quality is great, and it honestly looks like a OEM component<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/8/a85937449fd76d036a320f4f0d195d088325f331.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Looks nice. Did you buy the batteries from Kaly as well, or are you building your own pack? Also, are you going 10s4p or 12s4p?

Just the enclosure and mounting hardware from kaly. I have a local supplier for the batteries where I can get a good deal on 25r, so I will be building my own 10s4p pack.

Sweet. I was debating on doing the same. Purchasing some components from Kaly, Trampa, and DIY and building myself...or just letting him build me a complete. I chose to let him build one.

Curious what the final cost difference will be.

Beautiful man. You should have positioned the individual cells on a vertical position instead of horizontal because I'd be easier to solder the flexible cables between each pack without stressing the nickel strips

Thanks! And yeah it's from @kaly, most of my components on this build have been purchased through him and everything has been top notch quality. The cells orientation is dictated by the enclosure. The middle 2 enclosures aren't wide enough for the cells to sit the other direction.  
I actually did have some issues with my nickel strip. My issues were caused by my spot welder though and have already been fixed by making all of my series connections with flat braided wire.

Are you 100% positive about the cells orientation? 

Check this layout, it has Kaly enclosure as well with the cells oriented in a direction easier to solder the flexible cable

Yeah that definitely works the other way on that setup. Not sure if mine was a little different as it was one of the earlier sets, I think I purchased them back in February. But now you have me questioning myself I'll double check when I get home. Also what kind of tape is that connecting the compartments?

That's too bad, the connection of the flat cables on the cells when they are placed horizontaly have a spot when it's going to be rubbing constantly and could cause a short on the long run.

I'm talking about this part:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/475c5dce495fd5d9b87e93d674be5afbf0b5ab40.png" width="690" height="462">

The flat cable could wear the plastic cover of the battery and cause a short, of course this could also be avoided by just isolating that area pretty good.

If you place them verically, it'd be easier and safer to just run a very short flat cable between negative and positive poles of each individual pack.

I wonder if @kaly has a new wider enclosure design that would allow to place 8 cells vertically as this picture:

Hi 
On the cell orientation, you have build the pack on the correct orientation for that enclosure, It's a zig zag pattern. 

On the air gap between the enclosure compartments, here is how you go about it. 

First Check if it's not cut yet, by placing the compartment upside down like on this pic. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/1/418b15925dcdb611b6080343bfe0faaf339da080.JPG" width="666" height="500">

If is not there then you will need to make it by cutting along the edge just 2.5-3 mm or the thickness of the material, just not all the way, to leave a small edge of plastic. 

Start here 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/4/e44a0777987c756ab54e0bed138536ccf6568f43.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Cut alongside the bottom of the edge. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0e079ba1493af2e798658e2b51adbf04995b5349.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Make sure to leave a thin edge of the material at the edge. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/5/c58f992fba7682d58291840beb7f7a40a73f0eee.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Now you should have an air gap of about 3-4 mm to pas the flat wire.

So Ive been playing around with the vescs a bit in the bldc tool. Tried sensored foc and It was pretty cool how quiet it was but I ended up switching it back to sensored bldc mode cause I like the whine lol. Also not sure if it's just in my head but I feel like I get better acceleration while in bldc mode. This thing is an absolute blast!! I did a little speed run today today and hit 30mph at about 2/3 throttle with a half dead battery. Probably has enough juice to hit 40mph ish but I doubt I will have the nerve to get there üò¨

[quote="Kaly, post:60, topic:17701"]
On the cell orientation, you have build the pack on the correct orientation for that enclosure, It's a zig zag pattern.

Can you explain a little bit more what you mean by zigzag pattern?

@PartyPoison sensored foc worked pretty well, I think for this build I just prefer sensored bldc. And I probably should run them with a can bus master/slave setup, but currently the signal wires are just spliced together. I am not sure on the branding for the vescs. I bought them from kaly a few months back, and he said they were basically the same ones that scramboards sells. I have been very happy with them.

Can you put a pic on the part of the motor wire going in the enclosure?  Is it waterproof?

It's nothing special just drilled slightly larger holes than the bullet connector then hot glued the female bullet connector about halfway through the wall of the enclosure. I'll put a pic up tonight. I wouldn't say it is waterproof, but It should deal with splashes easily.

Hi Garrett42, nice job! I can see that you didn't reverse the hanger to MTB position. 
We recommend to ride the pneumatics with the hangers in MTB position to prevent wheel bite and to get a wider wheel base.
If your motor mounts do not allow that, you can still reverse the front hanger.

I hadn't even considered switching the hangars to the regular position. Yes the rear hangars are stuck they way they are because of the mounts, but I will definitely switch around the front just to check it out. Only problem would be when I throw some urethanes on I would have to switch it back.

Watt are you saying: Your wife is making you selling the board? 
Make her sell some shoes and dresses in return. That would be fair (-;
There is so much love in your board. You are selling a piece of your heart.

Lol that would seem fair. Full story is I have to sell the board before I can get motorcycle which is more practical for my commuting... Although not nearly as fun I'm sure üòâ

Yeah I actually tried wiring it up using the BMS as well as bypassing it, didn't notice a difference between the two as far as performance.

Huh alright, good to know.  I'm still trying to figure out if it's worth buying a bestec one with the correct discharge amount or just getting an ebay one for charging.  How much did yours cost?  The ebay charging one is only 40

Yeah honestly it probably would be fine with a cheaper one just for charging, I think I paid about 40 or 45. Honestly can't really remember though.
