So thanks to this forum just about half of my college application is about electric skateboarding (I literally wrote my essay on it). I‚Äôm in the process of applying and all of the colleges that I‚Äôm looking at have a pretty vibrant skate culture. 

When I actually get shipped off to school, it‚Äôs not likely that I‚Äôll be able to bring my beautiful Atom Camper with me, so I‚Äôll leave that at home for summer fun. In the meantime though, I‚Äôve gathered many spare parts around my garage and found that I have enough to put together a really nice beater board for getting from class to class.

Here‚Äôs progress so far:

I‚Äôll get some nicer pictures later when I‚Äôm done slow charging my old Chiboards 6s batteries back to life.

In the meantime, go support me here so I can get some nice stickers for this thing :laughing:

If you wanna build a dual I have some used motor mounts you can have.

Thanks for the offer! I actually want to keep this one light for easy carrying, so I‚Äôll stick with single. 

I‚Äôd say send those motor mounts towards @chris.hunt

If the cells where not below 2.5v before you charged them, then maybe they can be saved with a manual ballance.

They might have bit lower capacity then the rest but should still be usable if you know that.

Yes I know, they've been balance charging for a few hours now but it seems that my charger likes to stop when it deems the total battery average to be acceptable rather than all of them completely balanced. Either way I could just remove the last cell for two 5 cell batteries if need be.

Do you have anyway to charge just the low cells individually? That's what I would do. With like a hobby charger that can do 1s, or just a usb lithium 1s charger.

Well they're all in the individual shrink-wrap which I don't really want to take off unless I have to. I guess I'll do that as last resort.

Well I tried to hop on the wood insert bandwagon... I guess Skatan and Home Depot didn‚Äôt like me last night because the first two inserts I tried broke when I grabbed them out of the bag...
![image|375x500](upload://99q5BIAgOSpquiLZdZkRtNQ1neL.jpeg) !
So... I ended up drilling, my least favorite part of esk8. It didn‚Äôt turn out too bad, and since my wheels are blue on the back and black in the front I actually managed to do the same with the locknuts of the enclosure (kind of proud of that).

Board is finished! It‚Äôs by far the lightest I‚Äôve ever built, just one 6S1P 4500mah battery and no BMS, Torqueboards 12S Controller and 6350 motor. It doesn‚Äôt go fast, but it climbs medium hills and it‚Äôs super easy to stop and unplug the key in a second when I need to. Also the voltage meter I ordered was smaller and brighter than I expected, the pictures reflect that. I‚Äôm using an old VGA port adapter for balance charging that I bought from Miamielectric quite a while ago. Also the battery revived itself back to health, all cells within 0.05 volts (which makes me happy!!)

Awesome. :sunglasses: Quite simple and neat build. Not everything needs to be a rocket ship with 50 mile range.

Can this be called spam if it's on my own threads? 
Sorry - I just really want to win.

Reviving this a bit... I‚Äôll be using this for the next two weeks in a San Francisco commute, so I‚Äôve hooked it up to be able to run on external batteries. I‚Äôve limited the system at 50 Amps to be safe with the 5ft cable on 10 gauge. The plan now is to use some of those 10s2p blocks from the EMTB in a backpack for extra power. Anyone totally against this for a reason other than safety concerns if I fall?

Is there any concern of the backpack battery disconnecting during riding? Not sure what would happen to the other electronics of the pack, let alone you :o 

Maybe those black xt90 s that have almost no chance of coming free from one another? Or just a bit of electrical tape :rofl:
