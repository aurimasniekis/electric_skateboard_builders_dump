the new prototype has been built, settings are being tested, and the final adjustments are being made to the shit that does the shit and that other thing. Excuse all the technical jargon, I'm a genius and forget i need to talk on a certain level. So here's some pictures that even i can understand. 

i mocked up a new form to hold my burrito in place. IT worked out well. IT not only held my burrito, it looked sick as hell with the deck shape and would have plenty of room for aftermarket mods. Also, flangeless.

Then we had a hurricane and i got distracted for a month or so, and the motors were way out still anyway.

Then i finally got a sample for the fiberglass people and had to rework some things.

Then the REAL part came and i took a picture of it on one of the fuckup decks i did while fucking up everything trying to sequence the right mistakes into the desired success.

We're still waiting on all the parts, the first batch of boxes has been ordered and i'm ironing out the kinks to reduce the number of fuck-ups when cutting the decks. They end up something like this, but keep in mind, this is still a fuckup deck.

I went ahead and prototyped on the fuckup deck so as not to waste any more of Jerry's cash on Evo decks. Secretly i want to fuck more decks up so i can have a bunch of Evos to experiment with but don't tell Carvon that. Shhhhhhhh!

but the results... are inarguable.

That speed test was done in BLDC mode using Sensored Hybrid settings. That won't be production, i just wanted to see how loud they would get and how much they burped on startup. They indeed belch a fair amount of joice when starting from a standstill in BLDC mode.

We then loaded FOC on there, tweaked a couple of things in the motor tab and viola. FOC is almost or just as fast as BLDC Hybrid on the top end. And its dead ass quiet, like ludicrous quiet. I don't even have silicone gaskets on the board yet and the 74a Flywheels are just silencing the shit like a boss. Without the silicone seal, the box creaks a little against the wood but that will not be an issue in the production boards as they will all be sealed. 

I'm using standard pan head bolts throuout the build, for botht he trucks and the box. these will be hacker freindly, i mean shit, a hacker is building them, so of course there's room to add your own flavor after the sale. For example, my giant 5P fits in here, so you can do that immediately. 

I'll add more later. 

Enjoy!

Any updates on this?

I pledged an EVO on Kickstarter. I am backer number 62.

I just read that your 12S5P pack fits in the enclosure. Of course I will need that. Is the standard pack a 12S3P of 30Q cells?

When you get around to building mine, I would appreciate discussing this upgrade with you.

They will be mass produced. 

In my garage. 

By me. 

And my mass of board building flesh. 

Also, I'm getting Jake to help me test these damned things and get all the bolts in. He is quickly graduating from enthusiast to developer. Some of his designs and ideas are already in customer's boards as well as a lot of his mechanical sweat. We make a good team. 

I keep telling him to get on here. He keeps telling me forums are time sucks. I'm not sure which one of us is the old man anymore.

Any possibility once you start shipping that you do a brief video or two showing performance on the flat and on hills, with different wheel sizes, and comparisons between the different models if you offer different models, and a comparison to other common electric skate boards with some tech specs included. There are no good reviews on Carvon motors that review techniqual aspects of motor performance.
Thanks.

```
@Yecrtz I have one set and its on the EXO prototype, which had a temporary 3D printed drive insert which is now broken. I'm still waiting on a metal replacement for that but the manufacturing delays are real. 

@Tim7 Once i get parts and get the prototype running again, which is exactly how they will be built, not some experimental mutant, I will do exactly that. However, 12S3P 30Q is a known quantity, so we know what to expect in general on these things. When was testing to begin with, the range was decent and the speed was definitely on par with my own boards. 30-35mph easy,  and that was with conservative settings. When i say conservative, that means i maxed them out then backed them off to eliminate issues, and when the issues stopped, i left them where they landed. 

Lots of people are buying these, so initial settings will be more sane than some of us are used to. However, they're using VESCs so obviously you can tune them. 

VESC. I said it. VESC. VESC VESC VESC. VESC.

I do have a day job and a family. 

Once the parts arrive and I have an order sheet, the other stuff i'm doing, such as evolve mods, custom completes, and battery stuff will grind to a halt and we'll be focused on building these. 

Basically the only reason i'm still taking orders on other things is because i haven't seen any parts yet other than what i received to build the prototype. From what i understand, this is due to manufacturing delays for parts. I can't stop this bread from flowing until i see the other bread flowing. 

Also, if things continue as they have over the last few quarters, which is to say growth has been happening, then i won't need the day job much longer anyway.

It has been beyond a hobby for me going on three years now. It has been paying some of the bills in addition to paying for itself, but it has not quite arrived at the omelette stage. 

the omelette stage is when the "chicken and egg situation" arrives at critical mass and things start breaking, meaning its time to shit or get off the pot. Emotionally I've been there for over a year now, but the reality is that more growth needs to happen. Then eggs break and chickens get fried and we start making omelettes.

You know this because you came to my shop and calculated the time it most likely took me to set up the jigs and come up with deck cutting patterns and shape an enclosure for the EVO from nothing and get it to a composits fabricator and send Jerry the bills and repeatedly test settings on the prototype.. after building a prototype... and then ordering the mounting hardware and sitting on it... nevermind the loss of income due to trying to keep ready for this shit to happen at any minute, meaning not taking a fuckload of customs orders... 

I may as well have ordered a few of them for myself.

I just spoke to Jerry. Basically, he's just really overworked and fucking tired. He sounded like somebody just finished beating him with a sock full of ABECs. 

I was told i would start to see parts coming in about a week or so, beginning with parts for the first five builds, along with names and addresses for shipping them. 

Also the sleeves for the XLs are still being made in case anyone was wondering. 

That is all i can say at the moment. 

I have a few more customs to finish up and then i'm replacing my customs page with a semi-custom 12S Witchblade with your choice of wheels page. 

I will not give up on this. Even if he is swallowed by the night, i will build EVOs anyway. 

The squeaky wheels can go oil themselves now.

word of advice even if you cant ride. Hook it up and just make sure the motors and sensor works. both my sensors were not detecting and were sent back to CarvOn. Turns out the wires were touching.

@mikenyc just saw your picture of your two drives. You guys are definitely getting a much better urethane sleeves on the motor cans.

So you're telling me usps will get a package all the way to Amsterdam and update tracking, but leave my package in "pre-shipment" for almost 2 months? And i'm getting high on my heels? Please don't try and be condescending, you're not talking to a 15 year old.

You'll have to forgive Miguel, he's not the best at communication or explaination.

My speculation is that the "pre-shipment" tracking info you received two months ago was just from a label that was purchased and printed. Maybe CarvOn was optimistic that the drive would go out very soon and just prepped the boxes. The mistake was sending the tracking number to customers. Because for whatever reason the drives did not get finished.

Miguel/Jerry's update would mean that the drive are finally in those boxes and would be dropped off at the post office.

USPS is not the best at tracking updates, so there can still be a delay in data. I have gotten packages deliverer, in my hands and the tracking still says in another state and not show as delivered for another day. I hope you'll get your drive soon.

Correct me if i'm wrong, but I think the flux ring is actually a layer over the "motor can" that the magnets are epoxied to...or you can epoxy the magnets directly onto the flux ring where it serves both purposes?

Flux rings is made of ferrous metal, so having this ring around the motor can keeps the magnetic field within the motor which increase efficiency and something else I don't remember.

When you work on your drives, have you ever had your tool pulled to your motor? those motors don't have a flux ring, my enertion 6355 and Dark Matter 6374s both pulled on my tools, annoying as hell. The CarvOn's do not attract metal.

@Mikenopolis I think you're right.  I just tested it with a Dark Matter Motor and a v4 SpeedDrive R and you're correct, the regular motors leak tons of flux and the SpeedDrive, you can almost barely notice any attraction at all.  That means maybe they won't pick up brake pad dust from the street either...

Its going to take a little more time than the rest will because its the first one and i have to get all the jigs back out and dust everything off and those packs are big and i'm getting a new welder and 25mm wide nickel for these massive packs, but we're about to light the fire in this board forge. The drive systems are on their way for this one as are the wheels. 

We're about to start ironing kinks out again after a long pause so bear with us.

Carvon has the adapters and you just buy the pneumatic wheels. With 4WD they even say that on their Kickstarter, not sure about 2WD how that would cope with pneumatics... But yeah :) that is so awesome to have pneumatic wheels and no chains or belts... The very first board to have that... Tax should be 20 percent plus 1-3 percent of the price of the board. 1000 dollars for a truck with two motors is crazy... Though I still want it :smiley:

That's all i can offer.

I could have sworn it started in 2016 because I was looking at one thinking I can't afford 3k for a board so I ordered a Raptor 1 then later in 2017 I ordered a Raptor 2

G'day all, Greetings from Sydney Australia. 
Can anyone @here tell me if it's normal to have been waiting for the EVO 2wd to ship since December 2017? I've had little to no response to emails I'm trying to remain optimistic but due to the lack of comms from @carvon and @LEVer i've almost given up all hope of anything arriving and want to pull the refund pin. It's been so long I've manged to have a Kid while I wait :) 
My Wife felt so bad for me she bought me the Boosted board for. For my birthday which is a great, all be it a slow and generic. 

Anyway just thought I'd see if I'm alone or this is standard from Carvon.![IMG_20180831_182331_126|629x500](upload://76Gb5wOZsECHt0neP5kx2DvC6vM.jpeg)

pretty "normal" by CarvOn standards...

The newest update I heard was that one of our fellow enclosure makers just finished up 5 more CarvOn EVO enclosures that will be shipped out to Jerry (or LHB?)

Congrats on the child. You won't have much time to ride anytime soon with a needy child so if you can financially take it, keep waiting. He sucks at communicating, but the product isn't being abandoned.

I build what i'm paid to build at roughly the rate i'm paid to build them and receive parts. 

I just got parts for the third build that i was paid for yesterday and the target ship date on that is Thursday.

I don't see the actual orders, so i can't tell you who or what. 

Hopefully these vagaries makes somebody, somewhere feel better.

No, you’re not alone.  I’ve been waiting just a _little_bit longer than that for the EVO 2WD as well.  It is encouraging to hear such good reports, such as from Chris Dallas.  Would be more encouraging to hear from KS backers who have been rewarded for their patience and early support.  I’ll certainly let you all know when my order has been fulfilled.  D.

That's crazy. One time I waited over a year for a production board and I was dissapointed after all the hype. Just.build it your self you will have exactly what you want much much faster instead of waiting for an unknown.

I really don't get it. Why is parts being shipped to LHB piece by piece, one by one and as he gets paid to build one by one to build??? Why haven't parts been shipped in mass quantity??? This is insane method of doing things. To the dude with the new born, your kid will graduate college before you get your board from carvon.

Don't forget to ask your doctor to promote  your "LHB Danger manual" in the book he's writing.
Things you and his other patients say are priceless it's the least he can do.

None of my business really, but do you use the NFC on your phone?

I turned mine off and noticed significantly better battery life(10-12%+). I just have no use for it... :joy:

Haha. When you swipe from the top of your screen to look at notifications, a little tray will show up for you to toggle options on and off, you should probably turn it off if youre not using it :P 

NFC is near field communications, like ID cards that people tap on the readers to enter specific (generally)  locked rooms

In the case of your phone its used when doing samsung pay, or something like samsung link (when you tap two phones together to share files)

I just mention it to everyone who has it just incase they can be getting more battery life out of their phone. Phones suck today with battery life, any extra juice is :+1:

@longhairedboy what was battery that was used in this board?

I don’t buy the 10kw claim in the video above @HI-DEF-DEPOT

10000w / 50v = 200a / 20a per cell = 12s10p. That doesn’t account for sag, so really, you need more p’s and higher ampnswttings, like 60a per motor.
