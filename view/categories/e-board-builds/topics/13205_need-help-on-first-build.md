I was wondering what parts I would need to put the battery in series, and the best way to put a power button and charging port on the board.

Everything looks good. You can buy a series connector (I think from Hobbyking). Your best bet for the power button is an XT90S loop key, simple and cheap. You can also use that as a charge port if wired correctly.

Check out the MEB Simple Charging Port @ http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/ez.  For a cheap switch, you can use a 100a Breaker like this https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01HDX3YXG/ref=sxts1?ie=UTF8&qid=1479346380&sr=1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65.

Hey, older post but does this 100A breaker still hold up? Seems like a great on/off switch.

I know a few builders that use DC circuit breakers as switches.  That particular one is unavailable so I'm guessing its been superseded judging by the age of the thread.  Search it up and let us know how you get on.  Electrical retailers is your best bet.

Thanks! I found one and i really feel like this switch should be more popular. Loop keys are just a pain in the ass to plug and unplug each time

Good stuff.  The only thing I don't like with that particular design is the way to access it via the enclosure.  I can't see a nice clean way of achieving that but I'm sure some clever chap has got a solution.
