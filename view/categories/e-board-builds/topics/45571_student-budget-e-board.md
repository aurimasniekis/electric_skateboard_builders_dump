I'm think I'm addicted to Casey Neistat's Vlogs, so it must have happened sometime! I want my own Boosted Board.But its price is a bit too high for my student budget. Whats more, even recommended DIY board parts are also a bit too expensive, so my plan is to build the cheapest board I can and replace parts one by one in the future.
I used to build rc planes and drones, so my workshop is rather good. I've also have little 3D printer.

So, parts list that I found by reading a bit on the internet:
Board - the cheapest I can get (maybe second-hand?) to replace in the future
Motor - Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5055-280KV
ESC - FVT 120A
Control - ExcellwayÂ® 2.4GHz Radio Remote Controller Receiver Transmitter from Banggood
Power -  2x 5000mAh 3S - 18650 in far future
Cover and gears - 3dprinted ;)

As I said I don't have to much money, but I don't know if I didn't overdue it with saving ;x
What do you think about my list of parts?

Lmao, safe up a little more and read a lot more. Trust me if you go cheap your going to end up wasting twice as much or even more , going that extremely cheap will not be fun, unreliable and not worth it. My budget build was 600 ended up wasting 1300$ till I was content with it to.

DonÂ´t let you knock down from these guys.
A build like that is totally fine!

Take a look at @lowGuido Â´s cheap build and videos about it!

To your parts:

Board - find a cheap one without much flex
Motor - SK3 is good, but get the 245 kv 6364 for more power (one single 5055 is too weak)
ESC - FVT is a good one!
Remote - Excellway (didnÂ´t not it with this name) is a mini remote and really good
Batteries - 2x 3s is good for a 6s, just make sure you grab these with a high enough C rating, like 35C or something to get enough power. 5000 mah or up is ok.
Printed parts: all good, but take a steel motor pulley! Printed will only last for wheel pulleys.

Have fun building!

You can get by with an aluminum motor pulley but not a printed one.  It won't last long but it will work fine.

You know your right, but here's the kicker am sure @lowGuido read the forum for awhile and read about the what works and what doesn't and things not to do on  topics and knowledge etc. And then decided to weigh his opinions and what he can and Cannot do on his budget he didn't come 3 days in and without knowledge wanting to go the cheapest. Am not discouraging him from going cheap just given the senerio 3 days in new dude I wouldn't not recommend that off the bat.
Just my two cents

He has the right components on his list.

Better start with the cheap components and fuck something up, then being a noob, buy expensive stuff, because the pros do it like that, and then fuck up.

Actually when I built mine this forum didnt exist and there was no vast amount of information on what works and what doesnt. So I had to try it and see.
I made some good choices and some bad choices. And it cost me a little more than expected because I blew up the first ESC which was a helli ESC. But i xompiled all the stuff that DID work and was cheap so that every one after me didnt have to make the same mistakes.

@balipl, we understand your anxiety for 1st esk8 and know about going cheap on parts. But hear the advice from experienced builders, they spent far more than 400$ and built more than 1 board. 
There is a way on going cheap on some parts. Here's my opinion on what you could get:

1. [Turnigy Kit](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/skateboard-conversion-kit.html). There are people that used it and liked it. The only concern is the VESC. If you're careful and don't go over it's limits, it will serve you very well. The motor in this kit is very punchy. The motor mount is solid on these trucks. The wheels are a bit small but enough for what you want. Talk to @Alphamail for bushing setup, don't go cheap on them, because stock bushings are rubbish. 
2. [Batteries](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-3000mah-5s1p-40c.html). Get 2 of these and connect in series. 3Ah is not huge range but for your budget is OK. You can always buy 2 more and connect in parallel for 6Ah.
3.[Series harness](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-series-1pc.html)
4. [Anti-spark loop key](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-s-anti-spark-connector-2pairs-bag.html)
5. [Charger](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6ac-v2-professional-balance-charger-discharger.html)
6. [Wire](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-high-quality-12awg-silicone-wire-1m-black.html)
7. [Loctite](https://www.amazon.com/Loctite-1330799-Resistant-Threadlocker-6-milliliter/dp/B004L439FE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1517824667&sr=8-2&keywords=loctite+243&dpID=51FLPRKt%252BjL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)
You will only need a deck, enclosure, grip tape and keep your remote that you listed. And safety gear always.

Hope it helps.

Pro tips for a cheap build: 
Cheap out on wheels, trucks, deck and enclosure. Not so cheap they break but you know what I mean.

Go single drive

Use a fvt 120amp or xcar 120amp esc

6s 20c 5000mah lipos work fine

Don't buy a cheap belt drive kit from eBay. The chain kit is decent after a little modification but you should get a 10/12 tooth pulley for it

The hobbyking kit is a good idea at this budget. I lean toward agreeing with the others on expanding your budget a little bit (my initial budget was $700 and I'm well north of $1000 right now)

If you're intent on building it for $400 then use kits where/when ever possible to save money and reduce chances of incompatibilities. hobbyking kit is solid. You get a vesc (even though it's not the most recent revision it should perform the same) and a torquey motor. Your experience with drones means you should know your way around lipo batteries and balance charging so stick with those to save some bucks. eBay is a really good resource for cheap decks that work pretty well, I can send you the link to the decently flexible drop through I bought on there.

You might also want to check out the offerings on diyeboard.com which is basically a retail site for the parts used in most low to medium cost Chinese prebuilts, which are actually pretty solid.

Hey!
Thank you for all your input! I did not think that I would get so many answers!

To clarify - I want to spent 400$ for 'hard' parts i.e. motor, esc, controller, batteries and board. All other parts like enclousures, cable management, mounts etc. are out of this amount (I already have some cables, connectors and charger as well).

But... After all of your comments I think I have to consider everything again. For all those who advise me to save a little more - what is the minimum price to start with e-sk8?

I think that parts like Sk3 Motor and FVT Esc are not bad. The thing I want to save most is board (but I am not convinced of this solution. Actually, I know that this is a bad solution, but I don't want to spend more money).

Thank you for list of budget parts, and mostly for HobbyKing kit - I need to read some about it.

And for stats - it is not that I spent an hour reading and immediately assume the topic. I spent some time looking for different solutions (mainly last summer) and sign up when I already had my part-list;) I was also following squad and some other guys with his builds at local, Polish forum.

If you're good with soldering, you could buy a broken VESC that needs a DRV replacement for cheap, since VESCs offer so much more flexibility and config options.

Have you considered the $40 eBay Esc thatâ€™s been on several posts on this forum. For the $43 you get an Esc and a remote, which is a good deal imo. 
I have it on a cruiser board. Itâ€™s not the most powerful and a VESC will Be way better, but for a first build, itâ€™ll work and seems to be pretty reliable, and you can upgrade it later

Meepoboard top speed 36km/h range up to 18km (more like 15km) 
https://meepoboard.com/products/meepo-board?variant=4538537345051

This would come with normal battery just plug in charge and ride!
there will be much less risk factor too.

but if you really want to invest time into Diy increase your budget and spend time learning  under 400$  budgets most  of the time costs more than premade

Hey! I've rethought my plans, and read some about trends.

My parts list now:
1. Cheap longboard $45- like that: 
![ZY-LB2-1_seite_vorschau|500x500](upload://aCeQ1bqSUWFiH6TOcxMY2ZaqGlt.jpg)!
2.Radio -  ExcellwayÂ® 2.4GHz Radio Remote Controller Receiver Transmitter from Banggood   $23 - as before
3. Motor - Turnigy D5035-125KV Sensored Brushless Motor - $82
4. ESC - VESC from HobbyKing $71
5. Motor mount - from hobbyking $7
6. Batteries - 4 x 2200mAh 3S batteries from my rc models to make 6S 4400mAh $0
7. Enclousures pulley, and other stuff - from my workshop $0

Sum: $228 + my own LiPo's

What do you think about this set?

you need to buy big wheels because the smaller ones will be more bumpy,give less clearance for motor and electronics and Get ruined by torque quickly. Also 125kv on 6s will be slow Heres a budget motor for like 40%-
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html

Main drawback its uncensored so you have to do small kickstart but HEY starting from still takes a lot of energy and your batteries are small.

You will also need wheels and trucks, for the trucks you could use the HobbyKing trucks to make fitting the mount really easy. 

Like @Blitz said I would change the motor to the keda 190kV. I use it on one of my builds with 6s and can hit 30kmh+ with 83mm wheels and 2:1 gear ratio

If you don't align the mount with truck and pulley correctly, your belt will rub against the wheel, will create more drag, will consume more power and will last less time.
if you're not buying the HK kit, choose another motor with higher kv. I have that KEDA and i like it. But when i tried it on 10S and 20:36 ratio, it didn't climb any hills whatsoever. so keep this in mind.
As you might know 6S 4400mah and 12s 2200mah have the same range but 12s is faster and better for the motor. Unless you're going 6s because of small C rating of your batteries...

Fvt is good but not that powerful

I would get a xcar beast 120 or 150 or trackstar 150
Basically these are rebranded ZTW or SkyRC ESCs which are good quality ones in the RC field and they support sensored operation without any mod
With these you should run a racerstar BRH5065 200kv or BRH6368 280kv ( not BRD they have no sensors) 
Search on aliexpress as banggood recently got more expensive 

Otherwise the turnigy VESC works well, especially with the hobbyking esk8 motor 

I suggest you get lipos from hobbyking, used dozens of them for RC and FPV, they work great and so cheap ( sometimes less than 20cts/Wh, like a 6s12ah for 50 bucks) 

You can't use the stock wheels of your Longboard  as you need a pulley in the wheel
Get some 97mm wheels from aliexpress, costs 25
Print two 36t flywheel pulleys from thingiverse
Mount them on hobbyking trucks and motor mounts, these are really solid even if I recommend you to buy 4 higher quality 5x20mm screws. 

For your radio get a gt2b, far more reliable and easy mods available. 

Also, Best way to run dual for cheap, get a 3â‚¬ 8mm 30cm shaft from banggood, along with 2 racerstar red pulleys, Htd5m 265 belts from aliexpress 
Remove the motor shaft and replace it by the longer one, use a dremel to cut and make flat spots on the shaft. 
Use spacers between the pulley and motor to prevent motor to slide and you get a dual drive!

i have been using the turnigy kitsince december last year.
it is just OK.
why am i saying this?

1)MOTOR: The motor is too weak. running at 6s (which i am right now) it only take 16KMH. is a good speed for beginners, but in two/three day yoy will realize that isnt enough, althought they recommen run in 10s. i borrow a motor from a friend of mine, KEDA 190. running 6s you can reach 32KMH, i am still waiting shipping my pair of 5s to test on the original turnigy motor that comes with the kit

2)BEARINGS: i replace the original bearings to a RED BONES, the speed increase 2kmh and a much more smoother run.


about the vesc. so far so good.

yeah this is actually my GF's everyday board, and mine works just the same ;)  
We're talking longboard, not cars so it's not supposed to turn that much, and as you turn your weight is getting off the outter wheel which allows it to make for the speed difference.
Anyway there is also a bearing on the other side to help with the belt tension, inside the black 3d printed piece that holds with two screws

OK, so you paired a new battery with an old one aren't the IR (internal resistance) different, 
I don't know much But what I know is old batteries have less range meaning that 1 battery can drift below the safe Cutoff while the other is going strong risking ruining your lipo cells!
Maybe get a lipo voltage monitor and set safe cutoff voltages like 3.75v or more.
