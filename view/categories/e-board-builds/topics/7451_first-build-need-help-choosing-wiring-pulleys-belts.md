I have a few questions that I am desperately in need of help for.

1. [Edit: Solved]
  

2. Am I missing anything necessary? Any wires, connectors, BMS, or anything necessary for the board? 

3. Do I need a programming card or is the ESC sufficient?

4. Will [this switch](http://www.digikey.be/product-search/en?keywords=360-1931-ND) work for my setup?

5. Anyone have any idea where I can get the batteries I mentioned but at a cheaper shipping cost? Or an alternative battery setup that can provide at least 10,000 mAh 6S, at a similar price range?

Thanks!!!

I have to move my surfboards out of the way to work at my bench.

The Vesc is expensive, complicated, easy to break and it takes more than a month to get it after you order it.  I wouldn't recomend it on your first build especially if your only gonna run 6s voltage. 
Just go with one of the 6s Esc's on the list and get the programming card for it. The Car Esc's are much more simple and safe. 
With the Vesc, If you do one setting wrong, it's fried.

The FVT 120 is very inexpensive and should do the job nicely.
The program card will allow you to fine tune the throttle, brakes and performance

you will also need wheel and motor pulleys. 
And you will need wheels that match the pulley
Diyelectric skateboard.com has complete pulley and belt kit on sale.

```
I personally recomend using a motor designed for Eboards because they are well built and have a key slot that matches the pulley to keep it from slipping. 
Hobby motors don't because their not designed for eboards. 
50mm 280kv motor for 6s

Don't get me wrong, I think the Vesc is by far the best controller. And I have 2 on order myself. 
But I just don't think it's always a good idea for a newbie on his first build. Just trying to steer him away from possible disaster. Let him gets some experience and some reading time on the forum before jumping into the deep end.

I have already seen the light. Just better for a new builder to keep it simple. And not wind up with a pile of scrap pcb
