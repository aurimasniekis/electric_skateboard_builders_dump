Hello, 

semi-noob here

I would like to build a single hub motor e-board that tops out at 15mph and has the longest range and most torque possible... im a skinny dude and dont do any sliding or downhill fancy stuff... just 15mph is good for me... 

the battery must have some kind of system where i can plug it directly into a wall

i need to buy a hub motor with the maytech style square hole mounting style... NOT THE EWHEELIN


![42 PM|504x500](upload://zTleX3p3dhVmjwD1GUkI327u7J0.jpg)



what would the specs for this system be

TBH... just including links to the esc and battery that i should buy on aliexpress or ebay or something would be AWESOME...  im also not sure if the motor above would fit the specs i need... so including a link for one of those as well would be great.... but as long as it has the square insert style for mounting to the truck...

YOU tell us what the specs should be! what are your ideas? what have you seen in recent builds that inspire you? what about those builds don't you understand? why do you think your system works? why doesn't it? do you need help picking out a battery configuration to settle on? or if your motor is any good? 
a lot of research goes a very long way.

Unless you don't have any hills at all, I wouldn't recommend going single hub...maybe single belt instead?

One hub for a lot of torque? Don't think that's possible

Its been a while since ive done a diy board and i ve forgotten a lot of the lingo and math behind it... 

am i correct in saying that if it get a certain strength of esc and battery... and all that i want is 15mph... i can trade off some speed for torque and get a lower kv... 

im pretty sure i want 10s...  and not sure if theres any reason why NOT to do that since its apparently most common..

the maytech style motors on ali express are 36v...

i know absolutely nothing about what esc to get... (or even what a vesc even is)...

 i have no idea conceptually what amount of  amps to chose..... given that im pretty much going with 36v...

am i correct in saying that like most electronics....  if a battery is 36v... then the motor must also be 36 volts no less... but the amps are basically the fuel tank... are motors rated for amps??? or watts or something like that?

i havent really been able to find a beginners guide to spec-ing out hub motors... only random old school articles from 3 years ago with pictures of enertion belt drives...

the reason i am going with single hub is 
A: im only needing 15mph so if i get a typical 20mph system and then just trade off speed for torque in a lower kv motor (probably made no sense there)

B: its already widely done such as on the acton boards... not saying these are amazing boards but they certainly work for my needs... and just sayin... dont act like its not "a thing" to use one hub motor... its rather robust for what its intended for...

C:  i am using a pair of extremely rare custom trucks that are smaller and narrower than usual trucks and dont stick out from underneath the board... they only fit one hub motor... with the square insert thingy on the hanger

the deck i am using is smaller than a penny board (extremely mini) i have already been able to fit other electronics setups on it and if i run into problems can always just sacrifice kicktail space and move the trucks farther apart.......

I have a pair of super rare trucks that are extremely narrow and fit completely under the deck... unlike ANY other hub motor trucks i have seen that jut out very wide and completely defeat the purpose of a small portable deck.. (also i have no problems going high speed with my feet basically scrunched onto a tiny board and hanging off the sides etc... im used to it... even without griptape i have done many times... slightly drunk... etc... its all about portability for me... and maybe even the ability to slide into a backpack but i plan on figuring out some kind of hook system to just have it attatched to the side... i know for damn sure with those giant hub motor trucks commonly available it wont fit inside anything much less a backpack... so i am using these very rare mini hub motor trucks... they only fit the maytech style mount not the ewheelin......)

im prepared to drop a couple hundred bucks on a motor, batteries, esc, remote... etc.. i dont really have time to fuck around and have a lot of responsibilities going on right with work... and just want to buy parts that are compatible and match and wont explode on me... and will meet my STATED needs... much appreciated..

Maybe best to start off by doing a bit more research then show us a list of parts which you think will work best for you. Then everyone can give input on what will work well or what might need changing etc to meet your requirements

Motor options:

not concerned about the small diameter because i dont mind changing the outer rubber sleeve every so often and arent going to be doing much intense stuff... just cruising at decent speed... and i weight 130 lbs... 

im wondering if the $50 one will be any good vs some others that are $100

VESC: i have no idea where to start.... do i need to use a vesc or can i use an esc??

Battery:

i want something i can charge with a wall charger NOT the imax B6... i have only made skateboards that require an imax to charge... can someone inform me what these new style of batteries are that dont require the imax... do they have some sort of "BMS" attatched...  i dont want to solder anything and im generally terrified of lithium ions.... just want something premade with the BMS...

like i said before... im leaning towards 10s1p...  based on... nothing at all just the fact that the motors are 36v... 

not sure how "big" of a battery i would need in order to get 10-20 miles distance... or is that more to do with the vesc... 

does the range have to do with amps? etc... one thing at a time... what types of battery packs can be charged with a wall outlet without an IMAX b6... and that i dont have to diy solder anything..

If you're wanting a reasonable amount of torque you're almost certainly going to have to go dual hub motors, particularly if you want to be able to climb anything more than small hills. You're probably also going to struggle to fit a battery big enough to give you as much range as you want if your deck is smaller than a penny

Hi, i have tried different hub drives and amongst them are the Maytech hubs. Firstly i would advise against a single setup. Secondly the only good esc match ups are vesc's or the proprietary maytech dual hub esc. I tried the Maytech's 90mm hubs with the e-bay, meepo style esc and i can tell you it's a terrible match up. At the moment @PredatorBoards is doing a hub and esc group buy for hubs which I consider better than the Maytech's. But in this case you have to use the proprietary rear truck. And buy the way all the cheap hubs are already quite low in the kv department 60-70 kv- ish. You can always lower your speed in using beginner mode.
```

For hubs you'll probably want 10s3p minimum with 18650 cells if you want a decent amount of torque as well otherwise you won't be able to push much current to your motors, chances are a battery that size isn't going to fit on your deck though. 

You could do with a smaller lipo pack which could push more current then an equivalently sized 18650 pack but you still won't have amazing range and I don't know how practical it is to use an integrated BMS with lipos.

[/quote]
so wait.. you mean 18650 arent lipo packs?... gotcha.. so i need an 18650 pack with an "integrated BMS"


i dont need that much torque... i only meant to say that since i only want 15mph... i would opt for lower kv in a toss up.... does this mean 10s1p could work? ... hills arent a huge priority... 

i also hear higher than 10s is dangerous? is this unfounded?

to solve space issues im willing to go bigger on the deck as long as its still reasonably portable...

but to be honest i dont need more than 7 miles range.. so i guess i could live with a smaller battery...  how does this exactly transfer to the specs of a battery... what exactly is at play here... the s or the p (lol)...  

ultimately the pressing question is  what kind of setup would work with ONE of the above linked motors... for at least 7 miles range... 

is the 50 dollar motor linked above any good vs the 100 dollar

if you use lipo instead of 18650s you can use a smaller battery that will have more power.  

you say you only want a little power and small range now...

I think you really need to do a lot more research before you do anything else. All I'll say is I wouldn't recommend a single small hub or 10S1P regardless of the top speed or range you're after.

sorry to change it up.. but i just want something that will WORK with a single maytech style hub... THATS IT... and a battery that can be easily charged with a AC outlet cable... to be clear... whether it can climb hills or travel far is a question of what kind of setup would achieve that... and if it exists for single hub... Im not pigeon holing to one specific spec of hub motor... or one specific esc etc... just that theres one single hub motor..

I used to use two motors that were 4725 stators, so 47 diameter and 25mm long, but now I have single motors that are 4752 so over double the size of a single, little bit more than a double, and with lower resistance being hand wound.  yea a single will work with what he wants for sure

No...they're constantly broken and generally just disposable junk...i had a single Acton hub that lasted 2 rides and I'm 175lbs...if you're so set on a single drive a belt would be much more reliable...

problem with belt drive is that the motor pulley constantly loosens and i simply dont have time to be traveling around the middle of manhattan with an allen key in case my diy board needs an adjustment... secondly belt drive needs reasonably wide trucks... i would do dual hub but my trucks wont fit it... 

also.. wouldnt dual hub mean less range? or require bigger battery... more maintainance... more to go wrong... more complicated ESC... 


i guess i could file down a square section on my truck hanger and use 2 hub motors... but im sitting here asking you humbly...how!?!? what kind of esc to use... battery etc... give me something to go on... im not an electrical engineer...

get a vesc that will run foc and (4) 3s lipo packs 5000mah and at least 30c

and a hub motor.   a big hub motor.

but two motors gives better efficiency than one so bit more range with two.  same size battery needed for one or two motors assuming the same power to the road

I recently posted a dual hub motor build in the used esk8 market. it's dual 90mm meepo hubs, a chinese ESC and remote, and a 10s 2p battery that charges using the laptop style charger that you're looking for. I have it all installed on a fairly small deck with a kicktail and it gets pretty good range (I have personally gone just over 8 miles) and it has carried me up pretty decent hills. you should consider a setup like this as it seems to fit most of your parameters- if you want to go ahead and buy it, i'm letting it go for pretty cheap (230 ish probably) which I think is a pretty good deal considering it hasn't been ridden all that much. i'll include the link: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gold-coast-hub-motor-cruiser/50325

ever heard of the quickwheel serpent C? 

i bought one... it arrived a few days ago and only goes wheelchair speed... I WAS PISSED... but at least it wasnt a total waste because i got these super rare hub motor trucks out of it... the concept was good... if it had the performance or slightly better than an acton it would have been perfect for my needs... 

and what i dont get is that the lower performance cant be blamed on the smallness of the deck because they made the electronics compartment extremely fat and close to the ground... 

i can only assume the company was either trying to cut costs or is retarded and out of touch with what people actually need... missed a crazy opportunity...

yes, the larger the hubs, the larger the motor- this is important for several reasons. The first is that a larger motor means you have large Stators (magnets) and more copper, which directly translates with more power (more specifically more torque, which you want). There is also an entire thread on here called "why small hub motors fail" which details why you don't want small hub motors- 83mm is the bare minimum size for hub motors, and I personally would never go with those and would choose 90mm any day simply because larger wheels mean that cracks in the pavement (riding on sidewalks too) and small gravel are not as much of an issue whereas those can easily land you on the ground if you are using small wheels. As others have mentioned, I think you should do some more research. If you want my honest opinion, I would just try to sell the Kuickwheel (not on here, you'll never sell it- try facebook groups or ebay) for as close to retail as you can, and then invest your time and money either in a dual hub motor build with larger hub motors if you're really stuck on using them, or a single belt drive (6355 or 6374). If you want the best possible price to performance, with good speed and serious torque, I would get 6374 with a 15mm 5m belt- it's what i'm running now and its great. I know you said you don't want to adjust belts, but I have only had to adjust my belt 3 times in the 9 or so months that I have had my board- trust me, it's not a big deal.

I know that those hub motors mount to the truck with the long shaft thing that is inserted inside the truck and bolted down...

would there be any way i could chop the truck hanger down shorter to only have one bolt holding the motor in on each side... this combined with as small a deck as possible would be NIIICE...

No…they’re constantly broken and generally just disposable junk…i had a single Acton hub that lasted 2 rides and I’m 175lbs…if you’re so set on a single drive a belt would be much more reliable…

This isn’t like…just my opinion dude…these are experiences
[/quote]

so are there really all these reports of the acton blink board v2 and chinese maytechs and what not... breaking down after 2 rides... or in actuality do they last 6 months with OK performance not as good with hills as belt drive... and randomly die.. NOT SAYING THATS NECESSARILY A GOOD THING... but i havent been hearing any buzz about "acton blink single hub boards go up one hill and never work again" ... 

im going to post on the official acton community forum and ask for people's experiences if the blink board v2 hub version is so bad that its boarderline useless... 

OR

 if its just NOT AS GOOD but still did the job for a good couple of months before breaking... and how this couple of months might be stretched by... 

A. not being a total eboard snob and just cruising at 12mph on average (i would say 10mph is bare minimum where it becomes worthit to not just ride a regular board or jog or something lol) 

B. riding mostly on flat ground

C. happening to be a skinny fuck like me... 

this compared to.... say... the dual hub newer products like s2 etc.. 

it is honestly news to me to hear that these single hub boards just work for 2 rides and fall apart and ever run again after that... 

i was more under the impression that they worked  OKAY and struggle for 6 months before not turning on one day... and doing things such as having 2 of them and being more chill in your riding style helped alleviate this slightly...

Why do you want hub motors they aren't some magic Budget super Motors, 
They have a lot of drawbacks like unreplaceable urathine Crappy uphill performance etc, 
And Unless your buying expensive Hubs or should or Direct drive motors expect all of that.

Meepo is a good prebuilt board Go online watch reviews see what people say about it
OR Research what are belt drive motors Look, at other peoples builds etc.

Hummies or
Carvon if theyre truly better

if i buy the parts seperately...  im definitely doing it myself... if i buy a board complete... i will swap decks and trucks or little things like that...

my budget is 500 if necessary... and i dont need a deck or trucks... etc... depending on the design... 

my main question is... 

since it was immediately recommended to me to do dual hub motors when i started this thread... 

would dual maytechs actually be shooting myself in the foot compared to these super esoteric "large" hubs  mentioned previously and in the "why small hubs fail" thread  

 R-Spec hubs 
Hummies NEW double wide hub motors
Carvon v3 or v4

wow... ok... but i dont think i can go with those because my goal is PORTABILITY and to INNOVATE in TRUCK WIDTH... ....


i say this because now im getting somewhere because i would at least be willing to go with dual maytech or something NOT SO WIDE... and im hoping this changes things in terms of not having the board fail...  or perhaps theres larger diameter maytechs that alleviate some of the issues... wheel diameter isnt really a concern i can go in the 90mm range if necessary its just the truck width i want to prototype...

so assuming im going with 2 hubs... is there any of the same problems???

@admiralackbar my sincere advice Is on your 500$ budget Buy a meepo board It only costs 400$ and if you're worried about the uratine Getting ruined buy additional hubs from the website so that would cost you 400 + 100 
That fits the budget and you get your clean looking hubmotors. Or Learn everything about Diy esk8 and wait till someones selling a motor on sale a Vesc etc.

i consider those wide... i have hub motor trucks that are not wide... they only fit maytech style mounts... not the flange bolt thingies... or the style on the meepo... also if any further modifications are necessary ill do it myself with the necessary tools... grinders drill presses etc... 

im looking to take the trucks skinnier than the standard... its a goal of mine... but thats my entire point... CAN I JUST DO A DIY KIT THE SAME AS THE MEEPO SPECS WITH 2 MAYTECH hubs??? 

definitely getting somewhere with this!

basically any hub motor that has the cone shape that sticks out of the side wont work... i would happily just do a meepo style build with the hub motors of the same spec that will mount on my custom trucks... 

to reiterate what i said before... the trucks are such a way that the wheels dont stick out wide from underneath the skinniest of decks... ... they only fit maytech style mounts... I would happily go dual hub... just trying to figure out if two maytechs and the compatible vesc and battery would be as good as the meepo

OR if theres another board similar to meepo that uses the maytech style hub trucks without the bolts and what not... ... and all would have to do is transfer deck and trucks...

YES... 

i just took a look at the koowheel (anyone heard anything bad about those?).... the hub motors on the koowheel look like this... 

![s-l500|500x375](upload://gDOoINmVTsu8fjzcjanbq4FiS2T.jpg)

i think i would definitely be interested in buying one of these and just swapping the deck for something smaller and sliding the hub motors onto my custom tiny trucks!

somebody on another forum said "sounds like what you want is an electric penny board"..

no actually ive already done that... i have made multiple... im trying to innovate further with TINY TRUCKS... that dont stick out the sides... and I ALREADY HAVE THE TRUCKS... dont even gotta source them or ask a manufacturer to build something... from the start ive been saying the problem is THEY DONT FIT MEEPO STYLE / Ewheelin style/ bolted on style hub motors... only the ones that slide onto the square shaped hanger and  on and lock into place 

thoughts??? are you gonna tell me that the koowheel is bad?? serious question.....  is it?

the only concern i have is the size of the battery compartment wont fit on as small of a deck as i would like...(acton blink/ penny board size or smaller)  but im definitely open to sacrificing the kick tail to move the trucks farther apart... it could end up just making it in between there

I have the Maytech Hubs and they are getting considerably hotter on a 10S battery then the meepo style one's and they are less efficient. The heat makes the Urethane wearing out pretty quickly, my front wheels are showing slightly to no wearing and the hubs are cracking and tearing apart after only three months of use. This will even be worth with a single setup since one motor has to pull everything. Certainly you can make it work, Maytech is even selling them in 80mm. But the point i want to make is don't make the same mistake as i did, i feel they were not worth the money.
*Edit. I know everyone's mileage vary, but that is my individual opinion.

Please listen. We arent trying to hate or anything, just trying to help. 

You are trying to do too much with too little knowledge and a $500 budget. If you want to "innovate", you must First LEARN EVERYTHING about esk8. You're basically trying to innovate an F1 car without knowing all the principles of a normal one.

Hey, I have a board that uses this specific motor. It was a dual motor setup but i water damaged the part of the esc that controls the left motor so all i have is the right one. That being said, that single motor is still able to get me up to the esc's rated top speed 18mph but torque is pretty damn bad. Is it usable? Yes and no. its abolutely usable in NYC where the terrain is flat and you have all the space to accelerate. Its not viable in areas like san Francisco where torque in your setup is an absolute must (hills). The durability of these motors are pretty damn bad. I had board for nearly 8 months now and the hub motor cap that keeps the motor centered has chipped off a large piece from normal use. That being said, I have ridden these motors in all sorts of weather conditions and while the outside of its bearings (silver ring) are rusting a little, the motors are spinning just as well as they were on day 1. I have an extra 1 of these motors in green if youre interested. lmk if you want to know anything else on my experiences on this motor.
Edit: Forgot to mention, im using a 10s2p pack and it will barely get up the steepest hill in my park (the kind that will leave you absolutely winded if you tried to sprint up), i dont think a 10s1p pack will provide the needed amps to get this motor up a similar hill unless you get the absolute best cells. that being said, i just bought some LG HG2 cells for dirt cheap $24.29 for 10. Do what you will with that info

so you say that it does ok on the steepest hill you could find... with one motor or both??

or are you just talking about a different diy board with the 10s1p... im not really clear how 2p is stronger or better... (i should probably read more on my own but care to enlighten?) 

do you know what kind of maytechs could replace the koowheel motors if necessary

im also looking at blitzart... maybe buying the dual one... they sell replacement motors.. and have the right motor mount... i would mount them to my deck and mini trucks... and it would basically be the worlds smallest eboard ever built... but not suck like the serpent C (the chasis im using that only takes maytech/koowheel style hubs) it literally goes speed walking speed... the way i would describe it is... the worst boards on the market... single hub boards... cheap chinese boards... acton... stuff that people on this forum would scoff at... bare minimum ... when you press the throttle... they JOLT... and cause you to have to actually be careful/ lean forward.. take precautions to not fly backwards and crack your head open.... the serpent C none of that jolt... and not because of some complex acceleration pattern... just because it sucks... period... doesnt get the job done... and hopefully soon i will be posting a thread about the REAL smallest board ever made that actually works... basically with koowheel motors and battery (or some other premade board) transferred onto the chassis

With both motors, this thing will get up steep hills with no problem. On 1 motor, it'll get up a hill the same pace a bike can (or cant) provided that it sometimes slows down to jogging or walking pace. On flats, the single motor setup still hits the normal top speed .![20180329_200021|281x500](upload://cEihv0ropGFP2dACkff8c69vlpV.jpg)
I don't know if you can see it, I replaced my broken motor with a normal wheel and used 4 bearings as spacers in order to keep the wheel from shifting around on the wider motor mount.
A 10s2p battery allows the battery pack to have twice the mAH and Amp output. 2p is the multiplication of mAH and amps while 10s is the multiplication of voltage (3.6v x 10 = 36v battery pack). By using a 10s2p pack, it is able to provide the motor with double the amps that a normal 10s1p battery pack will provide. 
     Example) My Maxfind C 10s1p battery specs are 36v, 2000mah, 10A max draw. What this translates to in performance is voltage sag after the 50% mark and extreme voltage sag on hills (even on full charge). If the battery pack can't provide the motor with enough volts, the motor can't perform and the battery cycle life will be shortened.
I don't have any knowledge on maytech and koowheels comparability.
I have a blitzart hurracane gt and honestly if you want something that will last you more than 9 months, id suggest you to get something else like Ownboard. That being said, if you're only buying the blitzart for it's motor and motor mounts, it'll last you a good while provided that you don't take on cracks and debris at it's top speed like I do. (These specific motors have weak motor caps and large pieces break off if you aren't careful)
You're planning on moving blitzart motors and motor mounts onto a separate smaller deck? Make sure you won't get wheel bite because the motors are measured 90mm. Also, the esc & battery enclosure won't fit anything shorter than the original deck it comes with so be prepared to do some serious diy work on the battery and a new enclosure

actually i was thinking the same thing... about doing some diy rearranging the blitzard dual hub battery pack into more of a square shape rather than a long rectangle... 

i wonder if there is any way to cnc or diy some kind of stronger hub motor cap for the blitzart... 

also... the "kuickwheel serpent C" i was very excited to get.... and when it arrived it goes a SLOW CRAWL... so even the single hub motor blitzard with the tiny battery pack would be much better than what i have... and it could be an nice novelty board basically the smallest skateboard ever made... but with acton level performance (which is a good metric for me because i have owned one and it served me well)... instead of being completely useless... ill hang it on my wall next to the more powerful boards.... 

tbh if the original company (kuickwheel) just made the thing with that level of performance to begin with (acton blink, blitzart, 10-15mph, 7m range single hub struggling on  hills)  we wouldnt be having this conversation... instead its a literal toy

considering my goal is super skinny trucks and dual hubs... perhaps i could do what others on this forum have done which is take an angle grinder to and cut out the square shape from some normal trucks... but i would make the square shapes much much closer to the king pin than what they were doing... 

my conern is that the threads on the axle wont go down far enough to actually hold the hub in place... 


so im thinking about cutting the axle shorter and then tapping it with a thread down the top of it... and then bolting down a washer or something to hold the wheel on... this is how my current single hub trucks work so in theory it should be pretty safe? 

im worried the metal would be so thin that this section of the axle might crack off at some point from stress...

I wouldn't recommend on trying to replace these motor caps. I tried to take the screws out and stripped every one of them despite using the right size screw driver. They bathed those things in picture. Even so  there are some videos on youtube of people who have done it so it's possible. Just pretty damn difficult. I was really on the verge of getting the serpent C last year but didn't have the money. I'm glad my poorness saved me from getting it lol. If probably use it to get around the house and that's it.

not even good for that... and there was serious charging issues.. and the company is awol in terms of warranties and support... i doubt they would replace faulty boards after it just took 6 months to ship instead of their promised november ship date... its so dissapointing i cant even put words to it... like no one in their right mind would sign off on this thing... or with any experience of electric skateboards... i would call it...

Theres plenty of battery building guides. Most use hot glue to keep en together and them use heat shrink to keep em together. I go through the extra step to tightly wrap all the cells together with electrical tape so theres no room for it to budge. I dont know the answer to the 1 battery pack on top of another question though. typically most enclosures are purposely made to be a tight fit for the battery pack so that the cells wont come apart inside. If you could somehow make an enclosure that can fit 2 battery packs stacked on top of each other, go ahead.
Be warned that you never want any room for movement for the battery pack in the enclosure or you will find that you're battery will malfunction in pretty short order.

is 10s2p basically in a sense just doubling the amount of batteries as 10s1p... as opposed to say 9s2p... or somethign like that.????

or is it more to do with taking the same amount or slightly more batteries and hooking them together in a different way???

what are the most important specs for these extremely high performance diy boards such as hummy's stuff... or the arguably less robust raptor 2???

like what do i look for in a setup?? max amp draw?? is max amp draw supposed to be worse for range... but better for speed (or is it torque not speed?) 

does amps have to do with torque or speed... how is a motor rated?? is it based much amps it draws for a given level of throttle? 

how do you select a vesc and battery to match a motor (actually dual) assuming the motor has already been selected... or vice versa... vesc is already selected how does one match the motor to that... same for battery... 


assuming i was going to build a diy dual motor board... what would be the best system possible (spec wise) what would be decent/medium system's specs (meepo level) and WHY... what would you go with on a DIY dual hub board... 

Im talking in terms of specs... not in terms of build quality... because im not going to use the hummies or r-specs... 









why is voltage important... why not just go with 5s 2p or something like that... is 36 volts hub motors considered good? or ok for a dual hub motor setup... 

why is amp hours only ever measured in mAh>>>

10S is the multiplication of the voltage in a single cell. 10 x 3.6v = 36v

2p is the multiplication of the cell mAH and Amp output. 2200 mAH x 2 = 4400mAH  and  15Amps x 2 = 30 Amps

The amount of cells in a battery pack can be calculated simply by multiplying the S and the P values.

ex) In a 10s2p pack, 10 x 2 = 20 cells. 10s x 3.6v = 36v. 2p x 2200mAH = 4400mAH
ex 2) In a 5s4p pack. 5 x 4 = 20 cells. 5s x 3.6v = 18v. 4p x 2200mAH = 8800mAH

There are a lot of important specs. The important specs are determined on what exactly you want from the board. If you live in a hilly area and require a lot of torque, you need a high wattage motor, an esc that can pump enough current into the motor, and a battery that has a high enough amp rating to supply the current needed. If a battery cant supply enough amps to the motor, you'll find that voltage sag sets in pretty quick, worse hill climbing ability, and shortened cycle life of the battery pack from being overworked. Example of high amperage batteries are: Sony vtc 5 & vtc6, sanyo 20700A
 If you're looking for maximum range, you're more focused on batteries that have higher mAH and some way to limit the current that the motor is drawing (VESC). examples of high mAH batterys are: LG HG2, Sanyo 20700B.
Important to note that the higher the mAH battery, the lower Amps they can put out.

Sorry, I dont know enough about vesc to answer this question. I forget how to calculate the amount of amps a motor draws. Most high end setups dont draw more than 40Amps.

Cant answer this question, part searching is extremely time consuming. I can tell you that building a meepo style diyeboard is quite easy and provides great performance.

Voltage is important because electronics are rated to only work with certain voltages. If a flashlight is rated for 7.2v and you use 3.6v with it, the light will barely turn on or not at all. If you use a 11.1v battery on a 7.2v flashlight, you'll most likely burn out the bulb. Voltages are like certain size train tracks. 
36v motors are standard

I should basically cahnge this thread name to DUAL HUB MOTOR BUILD... because i have been convinced by the pros responding telling me to do this...

I know the style of mount for the hub motors i need... im honestly curious if all the of the maytech style hub motors are the same... such as the ones on the koowheel... blitzart... etc... if they actually are the same motor... or if the factories are just copying eachother and continueally designing them and using different materials or skimping on copper winding quality etc... or if its literally just the same motor all produced in one factory...

they all seem to use the same cap on the wheel, the same mount style... and everything... 


more questions on specs but let me collect my thoughts after that big info bomb

They get these motors in bulk from a chinese factory. They are all the same

Just buy a Meepo or similar... Ive had mine for over 6mo as a starter board (1.0meepo) and for commuting. For the price its paid for.itself.and.has been great... I coulndt imagine a single hub unless it was 500w min.... And I just upgraded my hubs recently to 500 x 2 which is a bit nicer but now im saving for a belt.drive. 

I also commute in from CT and ride manhattan all the time. From a time/cost/hassle view u might be able to save a few buck doing a.diy Meepo type board and doing assembly yourself.... Or just order one and open the box and get to riding in less time.

I'm only 140# and it rides great but once you get to caving on the streets (when these a holes decide to.clean up the winter mess) youre gonna want.more =)

edit:
actually this is what i woulda done in retrospect... youll have plenty of juice for range OR to ride hard (but less range) before it really starts to sag and 100w total... blank deck off skateshred for 40-50 and done (beside minimal hardware)
