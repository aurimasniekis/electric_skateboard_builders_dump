Hey everyone, recently i got interested in this exciting new concept of esk8, and as a result I plan and want to make my own electric skateboard. I have been researching a bunch about various components an electric skateboard builds in general however i am by no means ab expert so I created an account on this forum to help out with my first build! I already ordered my basic board and trucks a wheels but i needed help with the electronics specifically.

This [remote+reciever](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Electric-Skateboard-2-4GHz-Remote-Controller-Transmitter-Receiver-Binding-Plug-/272733085845?hash=item3f8028a095:g:tPoAAOSwIjJZTgjO) is good choice :slight_smile:

For the on/off switch make a loop key, it will be easier then plugin and unpluging the battery every time...(you didnt mention how you plan using it)

For  a motor mount you can use the cheap one from hobby king together with their trucks or calibers :)

these are reliable trucks? Most of the people on this forums said that cheap components will break and lead to false aconomy.

one more question, what do you recommend ,the Electric Skateboard Motor 6355 190KV with your motor mount or buying a motor mount from supplier on this forum?

@obstriker they are not tested yet, because they are out for about week or two, but I think there should not be a problem to get money back if they break...i dont think HK would want unsatisfied costumers...and you can always use calibers :) Somone already posted a pick, that the HK mount fits them :)
