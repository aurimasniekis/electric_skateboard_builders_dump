Question for anyone who is willing to weigh in on this. I have 2 Prop Drive V2 5060, 270KV motors. and i am thinking of running them at 10s. The hobbyking page says they are good for 6s-8s. thoughs on how big of a fire am i going to have to put out? and also how much bigger of a fire would i have to put out if i ran them on 12s?

none -- until the voltage gets high enough that it arcs through the coil wire's coating or so low there's not enough torque to move you're good to go. 

Depending on load it could have some overheating, but that would be wide-open throttle for extended periods. an unlikely scenario. Planning on full throttle hills for more than a couple minutes?

No probably not hills, but for sure planning on going full throttle if it gets me to 35mph on some bike lanes and around town

Well if you're using a vesc, good luck. You'll blow it before you even get up the first hill because your rpm is going to be too high for most escs

If you are, you'll need to lower the kv of your motors, as using a 10s setup is 'optimal'

you can use them, but make sure to limit your ERPM to 60k and gear for the topspeed you want. 

they're useabe but not optimal for esk8

the limit is often for the the bearings. 10s should be fine as long as you are not running at top speed for long periods of time, and just to be safe limit your current a bit below its max since you can now run higher watts with more voltage. from experience, ive run a 190kv 12s motor on 16s for a scooter. it did just fine as long as i limited my speed
