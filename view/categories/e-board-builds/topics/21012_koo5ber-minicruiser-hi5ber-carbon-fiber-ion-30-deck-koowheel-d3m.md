I had some spare parts lying around so I decided to call this Frankenstein build the Koo5ber - Koowheel + Hi5ber Ion 30. A small lightweight, beater board to tool around town. Uhm...yeah that's all I got to say about this lol :grin:

Oh no comparison, the Carvon v2.5 is in a whole other league. This is really for simple up and down the block tooling around.
