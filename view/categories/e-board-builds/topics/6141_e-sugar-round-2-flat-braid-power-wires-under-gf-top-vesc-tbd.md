Alrighty... resurrecting an old project that was sitting on the bench frustrating me.

(this is how it looked minus the breather fabric - collecting dust on my bench in garage)

Here's the start, channels, and wires installed.

(lesson learned here - i would now scuff/sand the paint to give it a bit extra grip, and use epoxy instead of poly)

Really like the result *except for the lumps at the 90* connectors...

So now we are pretty much caught up to today.  I didn't feel like the FG/GF was really sticking... and it peeled off easily with just my hands...(that's not good).

So i re-sanded the top and sides, then used some epoxy this time with the last piece/section of this blue GF.  I did not use the vacuum pump, merely wanted to get this functional and usable.  I have almost everything to have a 3rd deck for guests - so time to get it done!

I'm cutting some corners and did not pull the 90* wires to fix the lumps.  Good enough.

here's the partially finished results:

Want to repaint the edges black, and the bottom needs some cleanup, and re-drill the holes as they are nicely clogged with epoxy now.  Some grip and ready for electronics next.  I might leave a stripe of the blue bare to give it some color on top besides grip.

Going to go a single motor setup - trying to pick which.

Tacon Bigfoot 160 - 245kv
SK3 6374 192kv
SK3 6374 149kv

Single older VESC, BLDC @6/8s or possibly as high as 10s.

I have one of psychotiller's mounts i might try, or get another Enertion or DIYes.  

Will update more when i get the next pieces figured out and installed.

Thanks for reading and any questions/comments.

I remember the first time you said that this build got stolen. Looking good! Go 10S 192kv. More powa!

that blue GF looks extremely cool :open_mouth:

how will the enclosure/battery layout be? wondering because you used these incredibly long wires ontop of the board!

No, unfortunately my complete e-GBomb got nabbed from my car.  At work in the locked garage (with no cameras apparently).  Super lame, but a reminder to not leave anything valuable in the car...  
I left the window cracked maybe 1/4-1/2 in...  Old subaru not much challenge as they didn't even bust the window.

My e-GBomb (RIP):

A couple projects down the road i'll re-build it.  I have the new custom subsonic deck in hand now, and these next couple are practice on GF/CF laminating and vacuum before messing with it.

HA!  Thanks man.  It's a bit rough.  I could sand it smoother and take the time, but it's going to be under grip...  If i wanted it perfect i'd have fixed the wire bumps...  I think we'll re-name those "foot placement learning aids..." yeah!

Appreciate it - i'll hopefully be getting better and the next ones will be a bit more polished.  I have at least 2 more builds to go.  (until i use up my motors and VESCs).  I have a pair of the Tacons and 149's.  So either dual motor setups or twice as many boards!

I waaay overbuilt the wires - they are probably 10 or 8g equivalent.  I want to enclose the batteries at the front, and VESC in the back - leaving the middle nice and clean.  

Same here on a few edits before done...  no worries.  Definitely 1st world problems!  I put up a small quiver rack in the garage and last time i checked i'm around 9 or 10 boards...  I did lend a couple and not get them back... but no less than 8.  Only 2 besides Marbel are electric (DIY).

Got some progress tonight!  a little blood, some cussing, and progress!

Drilled out the epoxy filled truck placement holes.  Not a flat deck so kinda a PITA but it wanted to follow the previous through soft epoxy vs harder wood.

definitely not perfect, but definitely not going to peel off like the polyester resin before...

I sanded the excess epoxy off the sides and tried to cleanly do the same on the bottom w/o ruining the graphics.  Moderately successful.  Sampson (our pup) was hanging out and supervising.

Finally something i'm good at ('ish!):

Viscious grip tape!  I always have to re-learn this lesson:

Gripped and ready!

I got the trucks mounted already and still am tinkering with which motor and wheels.  Right now i have the 83mm flywheels and SK3 149kv mounted.  

Love a kick-tail for maneuverability!  so functional.  Going to be a great setup.
