Hey guys ive been in the esk8 game about 2 years and now im at the point where i just need more power partly because i am a heavy dude. 

My last build the Nimbus was very fast it was a dual 6374 12s build that can be found here. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-nimbus-lanyachtz-evo-build-dual-6374-12s/41903

Well this is the next evolution, im going to make a stupid fast board for me and with left over parts im going to make an Evo Falcon for my girl. lets start with my quad build and see what parts i have what i have on order and what i need to buy.

What i have:
- 2017 Landyachtz Evo deck
- TB 218mm trucks
- Miur Skate Almost precision kit 
- @psychotiller 6 shooters

What i have on order.
- Firefly Remote + receiver 
- Custom enclosure

What i have left to order:
- 100 samsung 30q 18650 cells

lmk if you think im missing something but i think this will be my most beastly board yet!

as for my girl she will be getting all my left over parts the only thing i need to buy her is a deck and trucks i have everything else.

Girlfriend build.

thanks man i appreciate that, but for the price i want to buy it cause i do plan to make more batteries in the future, i love the idea that i can create pretty much any powered vehicle. Like my buddy has these old electric scooters that use lead acid batteries we want to make Li on batteries for those too lol.

@mmaner, let's have a battery build party! It is the best! This weekend?  Next?!?  

Sorry, back on topic.

This thing sounds monstrous!  

It is a blast learning about building batteries, definitely grab a spot welder so you always have it around..... lurking.... begging you to start your next project....

I never regret buying tools. Ever.  This is an AMAZING tool.  I have spent way more on things that have delivered way less, and still was happy with the purchase.  If you build ONE solid battery, it pays for itself.

Or you could burn your house down.  Or your entire building in my case (old, early 1900s loft building).

But sooooo worth it.

Been trying to find a good bms but cant really find one that does 120amp continuous plus I'm not 100% sure on my size constraints until I have my enclosure made, should I bypass bms and use for charge only? I really wanted to use a bms with a built in switch.

So I'll post more pics when I get home but left focbox stopped working while trying to set up sensored hybrid mode, it smells burnt but other than that all the lights work like normal it just wont turn the motor and fails motor detection. 

I ran into another issue the front of the evo deck may be too shallow to run the motors behind the truck I'll test when i get home but I really dont want to run the motors on the outside they would be the first thing to hit something and unprotected. Dilemma dilemma.

The motor mount is at max extension for tensioning it may be okay if I get rid of the wedge and add a spacer but I'm not sure how the ride will change. I have large spacers I may have to try it

I already have new mounts  from @oriol360 they are great my favorite mounts I want to make them work so I may go with the spacer idea.

I just tried the wheels in single motor set up since one of my old focboxes blew up and it's pretty torquey with one motor I cant imagine how 4 motor will feel and the rolling resistance on the 6 shooters arnt too bad I pumped the wheels to 60psi and I was rolling pretty nicely. 

It feels so nice riding on air omg I cant even feel the blind bumps when I go over them

So I rode the 6 shooters and wow they are amazing. So much confidence it rolls over anything! My friends couldn't keep up with my on a bridge cause I'd fly over the expansion gaps and they would have to slow down lol

The rolling resistance is high compared to a urethane wheel but the stability is insane. We also went through some rough asphalt and everyone was complaining except me haha 

If you are looking for pnumatic wheels then look no further @psychotiller 6 shooters are the way to go!

I was going to get the 6.5" trampa wheel but I've heard of people saying the tire only last about 100 miles before wearing out really badly also their business tactics are the biggest thing keeping me away from them. 


I cant wait to see what @torqueboards is going to make.

Good golly that road dust son! 

But yea poof drv.

Regarding the front. Your only option may be forward facing motors. Or trying TB motor mounts with adjustable rotation. Remember you can run the motors dropped a little lower then normal because of pneumatics :)

I've got 2 sets of 6 shooters, my kids set makes 3.  I tried to borrow my kids the other day for some testing as he had his board torn down for maintenance anyways...I think the little shit was ready to fight me over them :slight_smile:. 

I mean...is there a better testimonial to the desirability of a product than a 15 year old willing to fight his old man, who used to box competitively, over it.  @psychotiller...the maker of the best numies ever and the cause of a mans son getting a beat down  :smile:

For the front motors should I extend the battery wires and install 2 Focbox upfront with a few extra capacitors or should I keep all 4 focbox together and extend the phase wires? Not sure what would be a better result.

never extend phase wires what you will have to do is from your battery cable get a parrell connector and parrel that for 2 focbox and the other 2 use 10awg wire so the distance doesnt make a resistance

@Deckoz what do you mean by desync?

I always saw that its better to have long phase wires than long battery wires due to the voltage spikes the esc sees from induction in the long cables.

I will have my battery and esc in a box in the middle of a board, the phase wires are going to be hella long, like 600mm with all the turns. Am I screwed from the get go? I am running 1 motor btw.

[quote="xilw3r, post:45, topic:57192"]
what do you mean by desync
[/quote]

Desynchronization happens when there is a large Delta time over long phase wires, which causes the ESC to miscalculate the phase bemf, offsetting the timing of firing and the ESC looses sync with the position of the motor causing a stall. It's sometimes referred to as cogging, desync, bldc communication fall out.

Regardless of the name you chose, the rotor/bell stalls which can cause avalanche current, that causes the ESC to further lock the rotor and toss you off.

Im waiting on parts so no board updates today but I spent some time at my buddies house working on some boards, he has a Sunnko 709a spot welder and honestly it's not a bad little welder.

I Fixed an issue with his Raptor 2 had to rewire the hall sensor pin then just ran the motor detection in FOC and it's good as new(admittedly the hall sensor mishap was his fault). 

Also here I am fixing his modded evolve battery.
![IMG955228|360x480](upload://9e7UBTcVeaVS3GNtckWfwesDjS.jpg)

He lost power after a bump on the last ride and we looked at the battery and entire p group got disconnected, also there were 4 other spot welds that came loose. The work on this battery was very low quality so I had to go over it and make proper spot welds. 

Didnt have any heat shrink so I taped it up good and now it's good as new, lucky it didnt even become unbalanced. 
![20180608_152425|690x335](upload://yXxsG8t4zE62Yt6hS7SnHQniUqg.jpg)

We also tore apart an old 2012 model Yuneek ego and started to make a new 30q battery for it, 7s3p
![20180608_152418|690x335](upload://zZq4xtGNurCJRXIp20oZ7bG10P6.jpg)![20180608_152406|690x335](upload://h1EQk3pesYFvgYLabPCcpVA1YuX.jpg)

So I took off the wedge and added a spacer on the front for testing and now I have way more room, motors dont touch the deck even under hard turning. Now testing the front i realize my rear motors touch the deck under hard turning so matching the rear with the same spacer will also fix that.

I'm really heavy but last ride I got 15miles on my 12s4p duel 6374 maybe if I put a little more air I'd get less resistance. 

But that's why I'm building the 12s8p, after I get my enclosure I'll start making the battery. If I can I'll make it bigger.

No but I only rise in asphalt with them. I also carves pretty hard on them, they are by far the best number to tires around. But even if you shred one a set of tires and tunes is only $55.

Carving doesn't seem to matter much, it's mostly when I get into the throttle heavy or bomb up a lot of hills. I've gotten as little as 12 miles when I'm really tearing up hills. As much as 22 when I'm cruising and talking.

How is the confidence level with your EVO boards with the six shooters riding near top speed?? I know with trampas I don't have any confidence when I'm nearing 30mph. Granted I rode a friend's like twice, but learned to stay around 20mph for my safety.

Lol, @Battosaii is a frikkin demon...he rides fast. I average 15mph, I'll but 30 every once in a while. 6 shooters are as stable at high speeds as good thane, even more so as you can ride over larger  debris.

I fell last night in the group ride, tired legs do not respond the same are rested legs. I had done a 12 hour shift and then went on a night ride..

Good thing is since my last fall I've been wearing a motorcycle jacket with a back protector and it felt like falling on a pillow :slight_smile: I may do it on purpose next time cause I was kind of fun to slide across the street and not have a scratch on you.

Edit I was riding my Raptor 2 not my DIY ( out of commission till parts come in this week.

![20180616_165130|690x335](upload://8F0uOzX7noJHOf5OwoNJ6jqCnBQ.jpg)

30 feet of pure nickel strip, I also put a small piece in a hydrogen peroxide/vinegar solution and this is what it looked like after an hour. 
![20180616_164918|243x500](upload://1SlLTYVkpiPdWM5JaDZzCwJXVUI.jpg)

I also got another set of old enertion stock of 36t gears so I can run my awd set up on 107s if I feel like it.
![20180616_165138|690x335](upload://mGEMzsp8vSeByjC6GcDZQXqaE5V.jpg)

And I got some parallel connectors and some reciever connectors.
![20180616_165144|690x335](upload://weVve4FESf7GgIkyJnClooQObo1.jpg)

And I'm not going to use antispark switch since they are unreliable with high powered set ups so I got this loop key from @torqueboards not sure if I'll use it but it's an option.

So I'm having trouble running my set up in sensored mode, I had the same issue before with my old vesc x but me thinking hey I have new focboxs and new motors so it should work right? Nope same problem it passes motor detection fine but when I try to accelerate  it just cogs and dosnt move. I'm using the TB sensor wire so I'm thinking the sensor wire from TB is not wired correctly for the focbox? It's the only thing that has stayed the same in the set up.  I have to run sensorless for my board to work properly. Anyone know what's going on.

My awd has just about cleared a 40mph mark a couple of times. @caustin gave it a pretty good test the other night! 

We have a street luge we are setting up to test speeds on the six shooters. Can't give more detail than that but we're aiming for 70mph.

There is little question that the six shooters are good to go over 40mph minimum.  Also clear that @psychotiller awd is most terrifying on the way up to 40mph (beast torque) than cruising over 40mph once attained.  Also clear is the street luge and his secret sauce will be a rocket to watch(out for).

Anyway, that reminds me I wanted to pull back out my sixshooters and try them on carvons. I have the TD adaptor but will that also work on the SD and XL?  Can’t rememvwr which was ABEC vs clone vs OK to try anyway haha

Just read this entire thread start to finish. What a machine you have built there. (Insert multiple praise words here, then repeat)! 

Love the attention to detail, and the shear power that thing develops. I'm on my second build now, with similar wheels - not SS but definitely 6" and same tires. Considering the same deck as it happens so interested to know where that enclosure is from, and do they do a single stack, lower profile, version for a 10s5p flat pack?

50mph is too fast for me, but I love seeing builds from people pushing the limits. Well done, it's an awesome board 👍

Edit: found it on eboosted ! Might get one!

The enclosure is made by @Eboosted he originally only sold the single stack version.  I asked him yo make me.a double stack and this is it.  

You can find it here. https://www.eboardsperu.com

@Deckoz fit a 13s5p in his flat pack enclosure. 

Thank you for all the praise. Now I'll be taking it to the group ride Tuesday let's see how it handles.

Great build! I still have yet to figure out why I won't let myself build anything not 4wd. But I agree on the motors roaring all around you.

You feel a more even pull also, it's easier to predict how much power is where and it's harder to swing your tail out.

I hope to see this at a renegade event soon!

Took her out for a night ride with 107s to test out the board with a familiar wheel set up and holy crap it's stupid fast. I was flying by a light weight guy on a Raptor 2.  I have not worked my self up to full throttle the board I can't describe the power. 

We rode 22miles and I had to tow a guy on a koowheel the last mile back I still had 61% at the end I LOVE this board.

So I burned up 2 Focboxes because my dumb ass shorted out the Vesc so I purchased 2 Unitys I have one already 
![20190111_195907|666x500](upload://3dRNHor007Aruyrg4VXpwEiSZkJ.jpeg) 

And I have the second one ordered already. I went on a group ride on 2wd mode and im honestly considering leaving it 2wd. Not 100% sure yet so I'll be riding 4wd for a little bit more to see if it's something I really want. I went on a 12mile group ride and I still had 97% battery left when I was done like 48.8v left so I kinda like this insane range in 2wd mode lol

If I decide to keep it 2wd then I have a complete drive train less the battery for another build.

yeah i use the 25mm width on my packs. atm i'm using .2mm thickness but i'm probably going to drop to .15 because at that width there's no issue with having enough metal to deal with the power. its also takes a lot less time welding a single piece to multiple cells than it does welding multiple pieces to multiple cells.

@Battosaii Have you nailed down the range of the 12s8p in 2wd with AT tires(6-9 inches)?

If you have, can you let me know what the numbers are as well as your batt amp settings? Im getting a 12s7p 30q and Im just curious as to what the real world range will be....

(are gear drives more efficient than a belt drive? Im running the etoxx 1:5 helacials if that makes a difference :thinking: )

Haven't messed with my 6 shooters since the accident but I may put them on for the next ride to try it out. 

I assume 6 shooters on 2wd will give me somewhere around 30ish miles range.

any updated realistic values with range/full range test? interested in a 12s8p dual 6374, wondering if its worth it or if I should just go with 12s4p, "range closer to 60-65 with 2wd" seems too good to be true tbh but if it's true that is actually insane

Let me tell you buddy it's actually true lol. It's a 1KWh battery. I don't charge my board for 2-3 group rides and I ride fast and our rides are 15-20 miles distance on average. 

Don't get my wrong a 12s4p is great I've done 30 miles on a single charge with mine but I was really pushing it.

That is actually insane, I've gotta get as much range as possible since im going the DIY route, would go larger than a 12s8p if there were any larger bottom mounted enclosures that could fit more on a trampa for higher speed cruising for longer distances but I suppose 60 miles should be enough even at bursts of high speeds lmao. 10p would probably be overkill.

This build is very very dirty and sloppy atm I will soon do a rebuild thread I just got my second unity in. I don't know how much I spent in total kinda afraid to actually calculate it lol I'm guessing it's well over $3k

Thinking of renaming it the GT-R since it's the fastest thing I've ridden and it's awd lol

Was thinking of naming my next 2wd the GT-S maybe I'll keep up the Nissan theme I love my Nissan's
