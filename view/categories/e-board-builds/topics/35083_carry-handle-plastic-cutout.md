I saw somewhere a picture of a plastic cutout that can fit inside the carry handle of a board to help protect your hand from grip tape burn. Does anyone know somwhere I could buy something like this?

Pretty sure that's just a wider form of this but cut to shape...

Although, of you just router a nice edge on the inside of your grab slot you won't need any of this stuff...
