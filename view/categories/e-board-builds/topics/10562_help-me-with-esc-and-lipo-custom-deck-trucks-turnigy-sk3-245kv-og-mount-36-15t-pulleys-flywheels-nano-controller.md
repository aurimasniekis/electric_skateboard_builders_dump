Ok so a bit of background - first build here, trying to make a relatively budget board as a proof of concept, before upgrading in future/doing more builds etc. Already bought motor, drive system, and wheels.

I have my trusty pintail longboard which I will be using, and upgrading to flywheels. Physcotillers mount *should* fit my trucks, but worst case i'll either **_make_** it fit with encouragement or just get some appropriately shaped new trucks :laughing:

I'll be using the nano controller but not stressed here, any problems and I'll pick up a GT2B on the cheap.

I'll have 15/36T pulleys and a 9mm belt, which I think should be fine but might experiment with 16/17/18T :yum: (Im ~85kg ( ~185lbs for you yanks) )

**Questions I have are regarding ESC and batteries**: According to the esk8 calc a 6s battery puts me somewhere in the 20mph range. So in theory if I wanted to stay cheap I could pick up a ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 6S 30C for about £35, or even 2 3s's, and  an X-Car 120A ESC for £30, and that would work, all good.

However Im a 'there's always more' type of person, and I know in future i'll want to bump up the battery cells. Is it possible to get an ESC which can handle more, or is a vesc my only choice? Am i better off just having the 120a ESC for now to have a blast, and then when VESC's are more freely available in future upgrade? I'd like to finish this build sooner rather than later. 

In addition (sorry for the huge post) I've put a good bit of time into research for this, since I have 0 electronics background, historically not a maker type. My girlfriends actually gonna help on the solder front since she's more experienced than I (I know, shame on me)  so my last question is:

Can someone explain charging to me please? Is a BMS essential? Whats the cheapest/simplest way to go about charging batteries and what connectors etc will i need? Any form of diagram would be ideal.

Thanks in advance guys, this is a great community :relaxed:

I was almost in the exact spot you were when starting out with this hobby. When I started out VESC's, dual motors and a nice Lion battery pack was not relevant due to the cost so I went for 2x 3s 5000mAh, 6s ESC, hobby king motor and some cheap parts. It worked like a charm for about 6 months. However not having a bms, using some parts I had laying around the board is starting to show it's flaws. Motor mout almost snapping, batteries lost some capacity and it doesn't look too nice.

[Here's my build.](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/karma-v1-apex-40-single-turnigy-sk3-245kv-2x-6s-lipo-tb-6s-120a-esc-tb-mount-83mm-flywheels-nyko-kama-wiiciever/6773/24)

## My Thoughts
If I knew how much I would love this hobby, I would have put more money on a nice battery, VESC and BMS from the start to ensure that my board can keep me going for a couple of years instead of having to build a new board after 8 months.
However if this is just something you want to try out and see what you think. Go for single motor, 6s, a ESC from torqueboards and some Lipo batteries and it'll be 1/4 of the cost and you will still have a blast and learn alot.
