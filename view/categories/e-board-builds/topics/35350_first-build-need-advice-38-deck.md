So basically I'm  looking for a reasonable set up probably rated to 12s ?  I want to future  proof my self and figure i can alway just run a smaller battery if its to at first. Any suggestions on kits mounts ect ?

Welcome to the wonderful world of esk8. Sorry to be short with you, there are always people asking the same questions and it gets a little old after a while.

Yea i can imagine. I'm coming from a racing drone background. though that would help but this is a completely different world.

Similar components, different requirements.

Yea basically. At least the batteries don't change so i can cross that off the list of things to learn

Well not necessarily, we have li ion cells which are a bit better than lipos in my opinion

Looks like you have Paris trucks, its a little difficult to find motor mounts for them.  Look the RIPBA motor mounts from @psychotiller, they are great with a little work. 

https://psychotiller.com/product/ripba-mount

I would suggest 10s instead of 12s, its safer (regarding the ERPM limit on VESC's) and cheaper.  You could go with series connected 5s (x2) or 2s (x5) lipos for a cheap but well performing battery pack.  

The key is going to be the builds category like @MysticalDork pointed out.  There are literally shopping lists for builds and you can see results as well.

Sorry to hijack... Iâ€™m in the final hours of a build (from laminating the deck to making a motor mount etc, just vac forming ABS enclosures now...) and Iâ€™m running 12s with a 190kv keda motor... I though under 200kv was safe with the VESC at 12s???

It is, unless your fully charged and ride the breaks downhill.  Then the over charge can cause issues.

Iâ€™ve got lithium hv batts (4.35vat full) will that make things worse?  should I limit my charger to 4.2v?

Im not really sure, I would ask @Namasaki.  He's the king of Lipos :slight_smile:

Thanks @Namasaki itâ€™s 3.8v per cell (45.6v for the pack)....

Are you planning to use a hobby charger or a bms and  brick charger?

Iâ€™m parallel charging my 3 4s 8000mah lihv using a hobby charger that can do 4.2v end or 4.35v for lihv. Will charging the pack to full put more strain on the VESC? I thought that I was within limits....

You should be fine fully charging them at 4.35v for a total of 52.2v
The Vesc is rated to 60 volt. 
I would recommend investing in a 4 bank charger to charge them separately  simultaneously. 
That way you can monitor the health of each cell individually when charging

I will definitely be using lipo batteries just because i have a lot on hand and no point buying something i already have.

90% if my packs are 4s that's why i was thinking 12s. Will definitely look at that mount thanks
