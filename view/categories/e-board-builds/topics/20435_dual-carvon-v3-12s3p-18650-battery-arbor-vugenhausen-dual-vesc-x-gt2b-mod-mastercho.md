Hey there,

It's my third build ! This is the problem with esk8 you can't stop build boards !

So my plan for this one is a High speed beast with a long range for some long sunday rides , I don't plan to use it for commuting. I have better boards for that purpose. 

Speed : 50 km/h 30 mp/h with V3's

Weight : don't care much since I don't plan to carry it I think i'll be around 9 or 10 KG 
Range : 12S3P 18650 Battery Pack with LG HE2 18650 cells from DIY electirc Skateboard ( don't trust myself on building one) dunno what to hope but maybe around 40 km range ?

Deck : Still don't know between the   VÜGENHAUSEN or the Backlash ( the vugenhausen seems the best for High speeds and lots of space for my big battery ) <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/2/f2a97b933db30deb869328e2fded7ac03f2bc46e.png" width="303" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/3/b3b41b15939397b2fc847d48c6858500a87d4367.png" width="303" height="500">

Enclosure : I think MasterCho is the besrt choice right now for me, I don't know really what to do with the enclosure any help appreciated !

I can attest the [arbor vugenhausen](http://arborcollective.com/?s=Vugenhausen) is a lush deck.  I love mine.  I kind of like the [landyachtz top speed](http://landyachtz.com/us/top-speed) better, but that's because the W concave is new to me :).

goldmine
[/quote]

My goldmine is parisians Techno Raver :) but half of my budget is from my raptor 1 mono that i've sold; Because I hated so much carbon fiber I didn't rode it that much. and afterall around 1 . 5 k for such a board is fairly cheap when you see boosted sells the D+ for the same price...

My plan is to build with a dual Carvon V3 as well so let me know how your setup performs. I'm looking for a good battery that would work well with this motor. Also, what wheels did you put on the V3?
