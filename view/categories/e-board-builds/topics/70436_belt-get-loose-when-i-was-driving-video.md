So I was in my official test drive, for see the max range, and I have a shit mount and I thought the way I fix the motor is enough.....and it's not.  
I was making a recording a video and you can see what happened to me.
The motor slides, and the belt get loose

I trying understand why the board get faster than me, because the board run way from me.

And for the last, my remote control was with low battery, after the accident, i check my remote an d the battery die, I don't know if the accident is related with the remote.
