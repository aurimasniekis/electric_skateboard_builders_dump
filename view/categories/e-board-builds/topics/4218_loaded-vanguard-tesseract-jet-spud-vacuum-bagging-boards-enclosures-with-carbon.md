since I dropped some pictures every now and then of my last Tesseract build and my current Vanguard build in the "Just pictures, no words" thread, I had to answer a lot of pms lately, mostly regarding my carbon work, so maybe its not a bad idea to leave my build threads here with a few teasers since quite a few members here didnt go the endless sphere route, but arrived here directly. :open_mouth:

Im still undecided if I want to invest more time on "enertion forums" - I feel that my home is endless sphere, but clearly the community here is much more active and alive, the forum structure is much better and I like the whole community stuff like badges, likes, etc. but its still the "enertion forum" for me. in that regard, maybe its a good move that jason pulled out of the forum business to make this more like a diy community and less of a business extension of enertion. :neutral_face:

anyway, vacuum bagging with GFK and carbon is something that okp of the french community has inspired me to do. one of the biggest obstacles for me has been a proper enclosure, the rest is pretty much fire and forget with the "DIY" products on the market. most enclosures look quirky in some way or another, require extremely stiff boards or try desperately to cover the sometimes complicated 3D shapes of boards. vacuum bagging is an extremely accessible method that requires very compact tools (mainly a vacuum pump), is nearly foolproof in its execution and overcomes all problems of adding a box to a 3D shape in one go. I hope to inspire more people to try the same, because even as a rookie, the technique yielded great results from the first attempt for me! :slight_smile: 

some teasers, for more details on the building process, please read through the added endless sphere links!

dont be jealous, just do it yourself! Im at best an average skilled craftsman. all i got is patience and dedication. if stuff doesnt work out Ill do it again! particularly boards and laminating is very forgiving, because you can sand it so well. you wouldnt believe how much I sanded in the last few months :stuck_out_tongue:

[/quote]

hey man, my tools are few and also not very expensive - its what most people have at my age somewhere in their garage I guess:

* a spring steel angle tool + 60cm+ ruler - best simple tool I bought for buiding eboards, has helped me soo much with halfway accurate 3D surface measurements

* a fine pen that will easily draw on wood with a millimeter accuracy

* vibration sander

* drill press for halfway accurate holes with drill bits in good condition - my granddad died 4 years ago and thats my heritage :)

* a dremel for all the small stuff and cutting 

* vacuum pump & supplies

[/quote]

so far it has always been for the structural support. when I removed up to 5mm from the tesseract, it became pretty flexy, too flexy for my stiff battery + enclosure concept, so I had to reinforce the board again. same for the topspeed, since I carved deep into the board for the battery pouches.

the vanguard will probably stay without carbon, since I want it flexy and I think the structure isnt majorly affected.

doesnt take too long to do - proper sanding with vibration sander max 1hour, prepartion of vacuum bagging (cutting carbon, breather and bleeder, mixing resin) probably 30min, the laminating process is 30min max, then in the bag and 24hours curing.

after curing the real work begins: cutting out the edges, drilling holes for mounting points and sanding sanding sanding until it looks cool.

so far I have always left the carbon as it is, most people finish it with clear coat. I didnt see the point yet, the raw carbon surface looked pretty great to me so far. :)

[/quote]

for the small batteries with 40 cells Im using LG HG2, which I think is an unrivaled middleground of current (20A continuous) and capacity (3000mAh). my 10S4P batteries have continuous 80A @ 12Ah, which lasts about 40km!

http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/Battery_AddingStrandedCopper.jpg

http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/Battery_PreFoldingOuter.jpg

for my larger projects of 60cells (evolve, trampa), I used Sanyo NCR18650GA, Samsung 35E or LG MJ1 (they are all very similar). they deliver less current (10A continuous), but have a higher capacity of up to 3500mAh.

my latest batteries all have protection cardbord stickers for battery plus-poles and they are reinforced with hot glue (randyc1 was the first who manufactured his battery in that proper fashion!).

```
problem with small batteries is: usually your current demands stay the same, lets say 60-80A for starting your board, possibly similar for running high speed, i.e. youll have to use cells that support larger currents per cell, since the load isnt shared by many. the high current chemistries usually have small capacity, so with a small battery you get double punished -> high drain low capacity cells.

on the contrary, if you go big, you get the double benefit: many cells and these cells can afford smaller discharge ratings since so many share the load -> low drain high capacity cells!

I am planning to build a flexible deck again and enclosure . I really like your slim design for vanguard and battery layout.  The simplicity  is the best. 

How are the enclosures holding up from the flex? Looks good in the video. What would you do differently if you do it again?

the vanguard is perfect in my eyes, board choice (flex2), enclosures, battery (10s4p), vesc foc mode, gearing & motor choice (16/36, 168kv), not a single mistake made and everything is holding up just great! im just riding riding riding, even really hard to be honest! its by far my most favourite board :heart:

even though its the longest board I got, its the easiest to carry, because of the split enclosure! :wink:

How many carbon layers did you use for the enclosures ? I guess it shouldn't be too stiff. Are they same size?

go wild! :smile:

I used 1 layer gfk for insulation and then 3 layers 200g/m^2 carbon twill. mostly for the screws so that it wouldnt tear. you can also go with 2 layers carbon and add a few cfk stripes around the lid! the enclosures dont seem to be under any stress though, I can tell from the way the drilled holes for the screws look. was very different on my tesseract!

and yea, both are exactly the same, 100% symmetric! think space is a little tight for 2 vescs though, so if you plan tongo dual, make the rear one a little larger!

@longhairedboy sank in cables on top of the board - until then I only did that roadside which is a lot more complicated and also not optimal cause thats the vulnerable stretch load side of a board!

for the rest, check a few posts above: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-vanguard-tesseract-jet-spud-vacuum-bagging-boards-enclosures-with-carbon/4218/12?u=whitepony

costs are moderate/low if you already have a vacuum pump. carbon twill is 20-30€ in total, resin a lot less, foam costs nothing and the few required films are cheap too!

Also which loaded deck do you recommend because there are a couple Vanguards on my local craiglist ranging from the flex 2, 3, 4, and 5. I am 6'2" and weigh about 150lbs thanks :) I also previously owned the boosted and loved it so maybe something similar.

Hey @whitepony, awwwesome build !! Looks gorgeous ...

I did a similar battery enclosure for 2lipo batteries+ VESC (a lot thicker and uglier) with carbon/kevlar,
but when I cutted the edges I couldn't manage to have a clean edge, without some fiber residue !

So I was really wondering how did you manage to end up with such clean edges ?!

Also, when sanding did you sand until there was almost no (shiny) epoxy left on top of the last carbon layer ?

ah, nono, thats a misunderstanding. it was longhairedboy who first sank in wires on a boards topside - on my boards I did that myself with a handheld router!

my weight is 180lbs and Im using the vanguard flex2. that one probably also works well for you ...  big fan of the 42" vanguards. flex3+ are shorter boards but if you liked your boosted: boosted are using vanguard flex 3.

hm, I dont know, did you also use a vacuum? think without a vacuum, the fiber/epoxy matrix is a lot less dense & perfect, air bubbles and excess resin in there which weakens the structure and probably makes ugly things while sanding.

I just sanded my edges, did nothing special. initial 120grit, then 280 wet, then 600 wet.

I never had shiny epoxy on my carbon, because all excess resin is soaked off with the breather layer. when I sand boards & enclosures, its mostly just to get rid of the few breather layer pimples that remain. if I dont have to shape anything like for example an enclosure, I just use 280grit wet then 600grit wet by hand.

thats how a board looks directly after peeling off the bleeder film:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_27.jpg

and thats after my very minimal wet hand sanding - basically just the white pimples gone:

Thanks man for all the advice I just dont think this is realistically possible for me to do I really love the results and looks its just I dont even know how to do at least half of the stuff you did on making the board. From rotaring the channels for the cables, making your own battery pack, making a carbon fiber enclosure. 

If you ever dont want that board or decide on selling it or making another one and are gonna be selling it I would be interested. Well cheers mate on your beautiful board.

Thanks for your answer man!

No I didn't use vacuum bags, just found a way with plastic food film (which is not reacting with epoxy) to try to put some kind of uniform pressure but without breather so no pumping of excess resin. Looks so clean just after removing the vacuum stuff !

Another problem maybe related to not doing it in vacuum is that there was some fiber that was still not soaked with resin even though I put some inbetween all layers, and that's why I wasn't able to cut straight to the composite (there is some soft fiber at the edges, and those are impossible to sand)

I would advice other people to directly start with vacuum bagging even though it requires more material, my finish is no way near whitepony's !
