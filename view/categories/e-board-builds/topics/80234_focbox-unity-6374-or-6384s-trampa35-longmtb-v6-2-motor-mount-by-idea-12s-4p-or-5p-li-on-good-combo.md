Hi I have been doin some research and I came up with this setup:

- [Turnigy SK8 6374-149KV Sensored Brushless Motor (14P)](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-149kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html)

- Selfmade/welded 12S4P or 12S5P battery pack or whatever 12S out of **Samsung INR18650-30Q** or **Panasonic/Sanyo NCR18650GA** if I would go over **5P**, enclosed in a 3D printed enclosure that will mostl likely look like the one from Lacroix where around 8-10 cells are enclosed in a separate section to get some flexibility


About the motors, would better go for the one from Alien but I've heard there were some quality issues and so this questions the choice and makes me go back to the 6374 from hobbyking.
Or could go for 6384S from Alien, take it apart and glue whatever typically comes loose.

So what do you think about it guys?
Any better recommendations?
Thanks!

I would go with sk8 motors from hobby king.
I battle harden my 6384 motors after two of them had broken magnets. I‘ll have a look on the weekend how they perform and if it really helps to add extra epoxy to the magnets.
