I been building electric skateboards for awhile and believe this to be my best build and would like to share it with fellow esk8ers. I started this build about one and a half years ago. ![image|374x500](upload://jL2WhGxtrBI6bLfPlN8ccBOMbI.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://qs0lPILFF8hqqt3vM7kBzPNBX8O.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://grZw8KCMVhyftOAr1m2BQHvGSbJ.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://1rRBRH8xokNoXrsNnuZEoMy3YP6.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://2wAIjTLDCC2Elk60shdMN2aDI88.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://l4fRRi6JvO1IKr3GU2pIJrB2Hd5.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://kfFhAQNf0xId6dsjJOPGwYhTFGy.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://k5F13PbioLZJqvP5v6wwX7BY2nf.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://5JUbbOtOra9xrzJuHhQuSoOvwj5.jpeg) ![image|690x387](upload://iOYI6hSLykeVq1SB86iSnPK5LM1.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://t4JBGgIiDyvSGSBo5ltDMU5WASN.jpeg) ![image|690x387](upload://ecDLnYKnUaA7Sg8oTEh49F9G7nu.jpeg) ![image|690x387](upload://6mFpJals39vkozI1yx96Ecuszi5.jpeg) ![image|690x387](upload://gToI4OqF43hf7bAlww6zLhfYExm.jpeg) ![image|690x387](upload://hErqqeFwdqYWg4NY4RNB1zU48WD.jpeg) ![image|690x387](upload://n9SH5C5i4QrZskPJ2sHOnVdh84k.jpeg)

I used my sector 9 board and cut out the openings for the focbox and batteries(10s 3p) then as you can see I replaced the openings with foam board to shape the compartment for the battery and focbox to fit in. I like the duel openings for easy access to the speed controller. I put 1 layer of fiberglass and 4 layers of carbon fiber.

Super sleek looking build, very nice! How much does it weigh in total?

Dude that's amazing! 

Are you worried about structural rigidity after cutting out so much of the board or is that single layer of carbon strong enough? 

I'm still waiting on my unity to arrive but I'm also building one with a CF board from hi fiber.

Are you sure that deck is going to hold?

That should be ok. I did something similar and needed 5 layers of carbon on the weak spots to make it bulletproof. Great work :)

It came out very strong but still flexible. It also has an amazing ride. The torqueboard duel motor set up has unbelievable power.

Not sure havenâ€™t weighed it yet. It was super light until I put the torque board duel motors on.
