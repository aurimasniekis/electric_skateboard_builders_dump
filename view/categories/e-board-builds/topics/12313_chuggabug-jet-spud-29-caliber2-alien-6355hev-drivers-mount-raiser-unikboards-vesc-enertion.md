I realized that my supplier sent me caliber 44 instead of 50. The board will be more stable, but will be less maneuverable. I'll test in the state and I'll see if I change thereafter (the motor is quite ready the deck).

The concave is quite hard on the spud to the battery it will not facilitate the task of making a slim case. I may be having to sand the deck for a flat area below (ca learn from me too fast without thinking on achieving the project in its entirety)

I received my biddings freeboard. I think making a mix of spud whitepony and "bad idea" of adam0311 (which has lots of good ideas) about design.

A dedication to my fellow French OKP is a real source of insipiration and advice for the construction of this project.

Working on the grip tape :slight_smile:
I've recently a new little joiner in our family, less time for building eskate.:grin:
I had a problem with my DIY battery (OKP had to repair it, now i have to catch him to get it back).

I've decided few changes: i'll put kegel instead FW (will use them form my next build), i've to change the driver.
I'll put an 6574 instead the actual one (again i'll use it for my next build, dual). 

next update soon

change a few things in my setup:
alien 6374 to replace the 6355 (which will be use in a another dual setup)
Kegel to replace the flywhell (i prefer green color for the wheels, but i will use the unikbard FW driver for a dual setup too)

@Toleg what did you use to paint the board? And did you finish it with varnish or anything? 

Will be sanding my potato tomorrow and would love a finish like yours (maybe a bit more cherry like tho). Did you sand it by hand or used a machine?

Thanks for the help!

hi,
No paint, just regular varnish for furniture.
i will add 2K varnish to protect the border of the deck
I used a machine to sand the most of the deck, than do the finish by hand (job done in 1 hour)

Not 100% sure about the varnish I got to finish it hope it's though enough.
