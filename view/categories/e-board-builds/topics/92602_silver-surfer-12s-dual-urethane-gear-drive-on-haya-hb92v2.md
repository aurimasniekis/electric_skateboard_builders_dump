This is very early in the process of my third build and first build thread. I'm starting this thread to help me keep track of what I have ordered, what I have, and what I still need along with documenting and sharing the process.

Inspired by the Silver Surfer from The Fantastic Four, this build will be as "silver" colored as I can make it. 

Starting off we have the Haya HB92 v2 deck. (On list for this coming batch)

[quote="RedBaron, post:1, topic:92602"]
Efest purple 3700mah cells
[/quote]

Interesting choice of cell, any reason for choosing these as i know they are marketed at 35A but tests they are suitable for 30A.

At 12s5p that wont matter in the slightest, they could be 15c and it would be ok

In a 5p config I run them at 20a each for best range, power curve and heat efficiency through its discharge curve. Sometimes I'll push them to 25a each during races. From my personal experience with them, they self discharge at an unusually low rate and stay cool while providing more mah and amp discharge than most other cells excluding thew new 30 and 40t's from samsung. They've been steady performers for me so im happy to keep using them.

Yh true which is why I'm wondering if a rebranded cell of 21700 form factor for such a large pack is the best option

My build will be very similar, haya, Davega, double g-bomb, and I‚Äôm using the 6380 tb silver motors. The gbomb brackets I‚Äôm using are different tho and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going with silver or black theme

Nice, are you using the adjustable gbomg brackets? They looked a little heavy for me. Let me know how you like those motors. I hope to find a set in the future.

Tb110's are in. They look way bigger than i thought. (Not a bad thing) I haven't ridden urethane for longer than a few hundred feet on esk8 before. That was on 107's and I really liked the more traditional feel. The only reason I didn't end up sticking with it was because of the chunking. That shit looks ugly AF to me. When i saw that the 110's didn't have that issue, I was immediately sold.

From my knowledge, the evolve 107mm urethane was really prone to chunking. The 107 I have will probably never chunk, as they are the best formula of urethane in my own opinion. Need to try some tb110

Version two of the flipsky Dual 6.6 fsesc Enclosure. Still some refinements to go. Need to add emergency shut off slot for xt90 loopkey, motor sensor wire slot, main battery lead slots, and make final adjustments upon receiving the haya.

Already updated the look. Didn't like how pointy it was.
3d model colors are different just to help me see.

Assembling the gear drives today! I was surprised by the level of quality from 3d servisas. I hope they work and perform as well as they look. The assembly is pretty straight forward but the only thing I'm having a little trouble understanding is the gear meshing part with the piece of paper. I'll do some more research before closing everything up.

Beautiful.  The paper trick is just to stop you over meshing the gears.  Over meshing can cause all kinds of drama with the electronics.  It can cause your esc's to go poof so the paper is just to ensure that you have the proper tolerances.  Old rc car trick.
