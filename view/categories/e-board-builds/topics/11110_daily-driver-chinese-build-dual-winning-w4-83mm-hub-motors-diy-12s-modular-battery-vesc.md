#Hi everyone, 

I am planning on building this fairly light board which would I would use for my daily commutes to the office or the factory (<5km, very very flat). Oh, and I currently live in mainland China (near Shenzhen).

Playing with Chinese pre made boards is cool, especially when you can get them for 400$, but I am a heavy guy who likes to go FAST, and they weren't up to the task. 

The parts I choose will come from Chinese manufacturers and Chinese retailers, not because of the price, but because nothing else is really available here, plus the delivery times are blazing fast on Taobao (less than 2 days)... (Okay, maybe also because of the price).

Moreover I thought that it would be a good occasion to debunk the myth about "Cheap Chinese crap" and show that like anywhere, somethings are good, others are bad, some are too cheap to be true, some are overpriced... Even though I agree, the sellers mostly don't know anything about the product or its utilisation. 

**Motors : Winning W4 1800W dual Hub motors kit (with truck)**

I just liked the price, and the way the urethane looks (doesn't look like a motor from the ouutside). I never heard about anyone using these, so if you guys would like a full review, please let me know how I should test them.

**Battery : 12s2p** 
Made out of free 185650 cells from my company
12S ince I don't really know what the C rating of cells I'll get, I opted for 12s over 10s (increasing the voltage reduces the current draw right ?), and **2P** because I don't think I'll be able to go lower than that in regards to current draw.

**BMS** : I really don't know which one to use right now, if anyone knows any good one that supports 12s and would be available in china please let me know. (This one looks weird and overkill : http://goo.gl/Zkgt9S)

I could also add it later and deal with a balancing charger for now

**ESC : VESCs** 
Because of the opensource-ness and ... well... it seems to be only really programmable one on the market anyway right ? 
I've set my mind on Maytech VESCs, because, again... nothing else is available here :expressionless:
I am planning on buying those ones : [goo.gl/NPHkvH](http://goo.gl/NPHkvH)

Board : **Benchwheel B Board** 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/7/57c19ff8b1d0bf4f92e0c19cafdb7eecc5eadced.png" width="374" height="125">
As I destroyed my Benchwheel Dual with south China monsoon rain thrice, I decided that I would let the excellent customer service alone (they already changed the battery twice and the motor mount once). So i'll be reusing the board and the Front trucks for this build. I might reshape it differently but I still have to figure out what I want to to with the electronics.

**Battery and electronics enclosure :** I would love the board to keep the very little flex it has, so centering the electronics around the rear truck would be awesome. I have an something in mind for this but I suck at drawing, really...

**Remote : Benchwheel remote**

I got it, it stil works, its very low profile, and I love the handling


#I think that's it ! 
I probably forgot some important things as it is my first build, but feel free to correct me if I am wrong, or give any suggestions.

**About Chinese parts** : I know a lot of you guys don't trust fully Chinese products, you probably have your reasons. I live in china, and even though I could try to import everything from reputable sellers in the West, I will try to stay local for convenience and also for the sake of trying new products.

I am very  impressed by you guys on this forum, trying to make things happen in the eSkate community, helping each other, ordering in bulk, starting buisnesses, developping useful products... Keep the good work !

# UPDATES :
**UPDATE 26/10/2016**
- Received my motor kit and VESCs
- Ordered a new Board for the final build, I will still do the test runs with the benchwheel board, because... you know... fire and stuff.

I didn't start anything, except unpacking, and cleaning the board, still waiting on my factory for the Battery cells. 

I am still struggling to find a good BMS here, the sellers on Taobao don't really know their products, and there is no documentation in English. 
I've found one with an Android APP and an integrated screen that can take up to 24S/100A, but I don't really know anything about BMSs, so I don't know what bulk charger I would need to buy with this. 

Does the BMS need a specific voltage input ( depending on which BMS you choose) and then converts it to charge the individual cells no matter how many there are ? 
Or is the BMS input linked to the number of battery cells the user choose ?(Charges them bulk and them balance them by discharging).

Yeah thanks for the advice,

The thing is, most of the Chinese brands only sell outside China, I can't find Suppower BMS on Taobao, or anything that look like their products... I'll have to contact them directly and see if they can sell inside china, or if they have a rebrand of some sort on Taobao.

I have several questions : 

1- I see a lot of brands that have an overcharge threshold of 4.25V, which is, from what I read, too high. Even Suppower BMS have 4.2V ( https://goo.gl/D8ZXVG ). Don't you need 4.1V overcharge threshold for maximum durability ?

2- Can a 13S BMS handle a 12S battery ? 

3- If so, should my power supply be 50.4V (12S @4.2V), 49.2 (12S @4.2V), 54.6 (13S @4.2V) or 53.3(13S @4.1V) ?

Thanks for the help guys !

1. It will be fine
2. No, you need a 12S BMS for a 12S battery
3. This one will work: http://www.batterysupports.com/432v-44v-504v-4a-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-charger-12s-12x-36v-p-167.html

@lox897  Thanks a lot ! 

The sellers here told me that the 13S BMS would work for a 12S battery if I used a 12S bulk charger, but that seemed odd.

I'll buy suppower if they sell in China, and I'll start the build as soon as I can.

By the way I received the VESC today :

You would have to wire the balance leads a specific way, but why not just get the 12s bms? It will be much easier
```

## \#21 Posted by: JullianS Posted at: 2016-10-26T15:33:00.972Z Reads: 320

Mostly because Chinese vendors sell either 11S either 13S BMS... no 12S option... or only a 12S36V option, which they say is not compatible with a 12S 44.4V Li ion, even though the board seems pretty similar

But anyway, I prefer a Suppower BMS that you guys know, to a random one with incomplete specs sold by very incompetent vendors, so I'll follow your advice and get the Suppower 12S !

Still waiting for Suppower's answer... I'll keep you updated.

Little updates yes,

- I nearly set my office on fire by dissassembling cells from an old pack (no actual fire, just a few sparks), I'll be more careful from now on and will avoid soldering lithium cells on the 14th floor of an office building that is not equipped for lithium fires...

- I tried to make a slot in the Benchwheel board for the electronic enclosure and ended up ruining it (Glad I ordered another board) :

- Suppower has answered and yes, they deliver in China : I am going to order the 100A BMS as my motors are rated at 1800W each, which at 44.4V would be 40.5A, so just over 80A for the 2 motors. I don't really know if that logic is even right so feel free to correct me.

- Received different project boxes, I'll see what will work as an electronic enclosure, and see what space I would need for a 12S2P + BMS + 2 VESCs

- Cells arrived from the factory and... wait, this packaging method can't be safe... right ?

- Finally, the new board arrived, and wow, I love love the old school look on the top (transparent griptape), the little kicktail is exactly what I was searching for (i miss manuals). The wheel base is very short compared to the 2 previous boards I had, closer to a trickboard than a longboard. It is thick and stiff, can't wait to ride it, can't wait to ride it... (feel free to make any comment about that sentence...)

UPDATES : 

- The battery will now be a 12S3P, as I was scared of voltage sag as the Samsung 30Q that I got are rated at 15A and not 20 like the 25Rs... I am halfway there, right now it is a 6S3P

- Bigger Battery means bigger Enclosure ! Also, I didn't realize that the VESC were that big, those capacitors take some space ! So I bought some tools, wood, and High density foam as I'll be now thermoforming an enclosure out of 2mm Kydex (discovered this lovely material on this forum). The whole cost ended up being 200 Yuan, plus 300 Yuan of tools (that will be re used for future projects).

- I now plan on charging having the BMS packed with the charger and not on the board itself, it'll reduce the size of the enclosure while saving a few bucks as I won't need to buy a 80A one, a 10A/20A will be enough for just charging and balancing.

- Soldered some proper bullet connectors on the motors, the original ones weren't standard size, either too smell either to big for any size that I could find in the factory

# Updates  !

**Bad News :**
The enclosure was a total fail, my oven was to small, the Kydex sheets too ( had to make it a 2 part box), the mold had to much sharp edges that I couldn't get the plastic to wrap around them correctly. Also... I didn't use a press, I was too excited and didn't take the time to gather the materials to build it. I'll see it it's possible to re-use the piece of Kydex later when I build a press (which is basically just wood and yoga mats, I know...)... Trying the Epoxy Resin + Fiberglass technique this weekend. 

**Good news :**
The battery is now finished, got a bunch of XT90 connectors from the company and soldered them to the VESCs, I also made a XT90s Loop Key (thanks @sl33py for the Idea !) and hooked it up to the battery. I will try the first VESC + Motor tests this week.

Here are some pics... with a Hipster filter of course :wink: : 

#The battery : 12S3P Samsung 30Q (44.4V / 9Ah / 45A)

Hey guys so i've been looking at e-skate parts on aliexpress. I came across with this truck set with dual motor configuration. It is oddly cheap ($180) so im quite suspicious about this product. Has anyone used this brands' products or heard anything about it?

Hi man, searh for benchwheel and you'll find everything you need.

I've been using them on a Benchwheel complete board. They're reasonably powerful, you might want to change the gear ratio though, at 85Kg I was getting good torque but poor max speed (24km/h). Also, the motor mount design doesn't allow for bigger motors apparently

Hi guys, still alive :  I've been figuring out some problems with the VESCs, enclosure, and motors.

#Here is what happened :

1. Tried to configure the motors in BLDC,
     --> Too much step skipping, even without load.

2. Tried FOC, didn't work for some reason, so I modded C18 Capacitor on both VESCs
     --> Worked like a charm on one of the VESCs, caused more DRV faults on the other, even on BLDC

3. Changed DRV 8302 on the faulty VESC with a very skilled workmate, but t didn't solve anything
     --> Ordered a new VESC, its on the way

4. Did some test runs with 1 Motor/VESC in FOC, electronics taped under the board
     --> So silent, I mean no audible noise except the wheels rubbing on the ground, factory workers thought I was a magician.
     --> Very low torque at the beginning with 1 motor, but decent torque at 20km/h (didn't go faster than that)
     --> Braking is very weak, but it was expected.
     --> Yes, HOOOOT, the trucks are barely touchable after the 5mn Start/Stop test run that I did, I really understant the   truck design of the raptor 2 now. I will lower the max amps from 60 to 40, and try not to start from standstill next time.

5. Tried a Kydex enclosure, didn't work, used polysterene for the mold, that thing doesn't really like hot plastic + Heat gun over it...

6. Tried a Fiberglass epoxy enclosure, failed too, because I didn't know that I used epoxy ADHESIVE, and not RESIN... It woks, but it is so ugly... 



#SOOOooo... 
It is still a work in progress, the epoxy adhesive enclosure is really ugly right now, but I'll make a new one with either a 3D printer or a CNC in the factory.

So yes, the motors are hot, but that was to be expected with a 130kv motor at 12S 60A trying to start from standstill. I am sure that 2 motors will reduce the stress thus the temperature of the motors while boosting the torque a little. 
Definitely going to research ways to dissipate heat from the trucks and the motors. Right now I am thinking about small radiators everywhere...

But damn, FOC is such a pain to configure, I am sure that the motor detection is just a start, it can work with very good motors, but needs more tweaking with lesser quality motors.
With VESC 6 on the way, I hope that we can understand more about those DRV errors, so that even VESC4 users can use the newly acquired knowledge of the chip to configure FOC better.

Soo... not giving up on FOC ! 

About the VESC's, I really don't know if the first one was faulty, if it is Maytech's fault or not, but I definitely broke it trying to repair it, and there was no refund after that. Aniway they are only 66 dollars here, I'll let you know how it goes with the new one...

Received the VESC yesterday, proceeded to mod C18, and to configure it in BLDC Tool today.

#1ST Test run : 

(+++) **So much SPEED !!!** I was used to a good torque with my Benchwheel, but it "Torque sensation" would stop after reaching 17-18km/h. On this one IT'S NEVERENDING, I can't reach top speed in the limited area I had in the factory, but the faster I go, the more torque I feel. I love it.

(+++) Braking feels solid at -40A/-20A, but 50A should be better.

(- - -) No start from standstill, gotta go give a tiny push (the speed you get from stepping on the board is enough). 

(- - -) Motors are still a little warmer than expected a 50A (Nothing crazy), I'll turn it down to 45A to be safe

#Here are my VESC settings :

# RANDOM UPDATE

It's been a loooooong time...

I paused this project because of, you know... Chinese crazy life... But I am back on track ! 

I had a problem with the motors as the urethane got away randomly on the the left motor (kinda scary, i must admit), sent it back to the seller, he told me their new version has a safer way to attach the urethane, and that they would update it to the new version (See the black metal ring under the screws ? it wasn't there on the version I bought) :
 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/a/2a0a865c94f7155397e429f9775eb07bf465a9fd.jpg" width="300" height="250"> 
Even though I had to pay for postage both ways, I was happy to see that they fixed the problem...
Oh wait... They did update it to the new version, but the same motor keeps losing its screws, thus the urethane... I am currently talking with them for more fixing...

So, yeah, lucky me to live in China, postage is easy,cheap and fast here.

What else ? 

- The VESC's hold their own pretty well, but if i put full throttle while the board is off the ground, they get a DRV_Error.
I also Limited the RPM to 26000 as I remember, choose this value while listening to the motor without load, started at 40000 and went down until it wasn't scary anymore...

- The Battery is really really long range, I need to do some range tests, but it seems like more than 10km (3 round trips to work) at 40-70% throttle , which is already too wobbly for such a small wheelbase.

- Still don't have an enclosure, everything is taped to the board, it is UGLY, finally found one that could fit the 12S3P pack, and the VESCs.
- The Wheelbase is really to small for the speeds those motor reach. I wonder if I could extend the wheelbase by drilling new truck holes in the front (there is like 12cm), does someone knows how to do that right ?

Hi great build, how are the motors holding?

One of them is holding fine, but the other one keeps losing its urethane, I opened it since the seller wouldn't repair it for less than half the price of the motor : One magnet came loose and was hitting the rotor... glad I did open it and prevented further damage.

I don't recommend them at all... they're powerful but really to dangerous. I am trying to fix the faulty one myself now... takes a loooong time.

But good news, my company is working on 100mm hub motors, the first prototype is set to next month so i'll tell you guys how it goes.

If your batteries are rated at 15A with 3P aren't hot cutting it real close to the motors 45A draw?

I am not sure I understand, but if you mean that 3P is a little short for the 45A use, yeah you're right. I limit the battery current in the VESC though, the motor current is higher. I am not sure how they are related but it seems to work fine.

Besides the rubber problem, are there any more problems? What is the top speed? Is FOC working ok now? Is it worth it?
If the seller made a new version of these motors, with no more issues, would you recommend them for VESC with FOC?

As i mentioned in another topic, I would never recommend those motors, they're too powerful to be that unsafely assembled.

I mean its like having the fastest car in town and having it loose parts randomly at anytime... Even with their "Updated" version, the urethane didn't hold. And if your motor fails, they wont help you with anything... (They only "helped" me because I lived a few kilometers from their factory).

I would say, find better offers...
