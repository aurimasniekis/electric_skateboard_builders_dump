I've got a Loaded Vanguard with 180mm Paris trucks that I would like to convert to electric.  I'm about 175 pounds and would like to end up with a board that can get a 15+ mile range, speed of 20-25mph, in an area that has some hills although nothing too steep.  I'd also like to go with some kind of AT/pneumatic wheel/tire setup since the roads aren't that good in my area.  I also don't want to build a battery.  Ideally something that's ready to go off the shelf with BMS, on/off switch, and charge indicator.  As plug and play as possible.  I'd like to keep the budget around $800 if possible.

Would anyone be able to help with putting together a parts list?  I've been researching but find all of this to be really overwhelming and could use some direction.

Thank you in advance.

You are gonna have a hard time fitting pneumatics to paris 180s and getting enough wheel clearance.  I have a set of 195's and they work with a deck that has large cutouts but they couldn't be any smaller.  @psychotiller mounts are they way to go with Paris trucks, check them out here...

You will have to do a little sanding to make the hanger profile rounder, but its not hard.

Look at @torqueboards battery packs, they have built in charge ports and switches...

Or, talk to @willpark16 and/or @barajabali.  They make custom batteries. 

The most important thing you can do is look through the builds category, its a virtual shopping list, just find a build similar to what you want to build and then check the components list (most have them) and ask questions of the builder.

 Hey @SlayBO, i feel your pain man. 
When i first caught wind of the possibility of never having to kick again i got ridiculously excited. Then found this forum. It was at the start of the summer (in Canada and they're pretty short), and i wanted to have my build done yesterday! What i found though, is with patience, learning to do this from reading content on the forum was fascinating. And within about 2 months, i had pretty much everything i needed to do my build, and most importantly, the knowledge to put it together properly! 
I could give you a list. Many people on here could. But You'll be lacking the most important thing; all the knowledge required to make your dream build properly, and first try! 
What i did, was start in the **esk8 builds** category. Check out a bunch of machines that are already built. See what they did. The parts they used. Ask them questions. Everybody here is super helpful. Also, keep your eye on the **esk8 parts market** and the **used items for sale** categories. Those will help you keep your budget while ensuring you're putting quality parts on your whip. Hell, when you have a few spare moments, read some threads on the electronics category and the mechanics category. You'll see fascinating discussions on issues you're most likely having. From this input you're gathering, you'll now have context which will allow you to use the search icon effectively. Once you kind of know what you're looking for, it's an amazing tool. 
Bottom line. If you're a DIY kinda guy, that'd be a good way to get into this. If that just seems like way too much work, I'd consider buying a pre-built esk8 to start and keep your existing setup as a cruiser. 
Good luck my man, enjoy the journey!!!

Thank you.  This was great.  

I was looking at that battery and the 12s.  If I went with the 10s and wanted to upgrade, is it a simple swap?  Or would I also have to swap the motor to one that was 12s friendly?  Or am I missing the boat entirely?

And what about a wheel setup like this:

Are there measurements that tie to the truck size, or is it just trial and error?

The motor and battery pack are determined by each other because of the ERPM barrier of the standard VESC.  You don't want to go over 60k ERPM or you kill the VESC.  A motor with too high KV for the Battery Pack voltage will pass the ERPM barrier and then boom, dead vesc.  I don't use 12s packs because there is little room for movement regarding the ERPM barrier.  A 10s battery and 190KV is the accepted standard.  I'm not saying don't use a 12, just saying its safer for your equipment.
