I'm working on my first build so still waiting for parts. How to check if it fits a 63mm motor ?

That does look pretty sturdy. Any idea if it's going to hit your deck without using risers? How does it look as far as motor spacing to the ground? I ask because it can't be adjusted.  Also looks like you mounted it upside down.

How about a side view with the wheels on the ground? The way it looks now, is that the motor will be closer to the ground than the truck hanger? If so, no bueno... or maybe it should be flipped???

How is it not very adjustable? Looks to me like you can just loosen those bolts and spin it on the axle of the truck as little or as much as you want, then tighten up again? Is that not the case? I thought those 'teeth' of the clamp just bit in to the truck...

Assuming these are aluminum or stainless, they might be ok.  My concerns are the material & usability with 63mm motors.  If the construction is well done, you can fit 63mm motors and they don't crack/break I will be surprised.  If all that is good then they are a hell of a deal for 8 bucks.

While talking about clamp on motor mounts, I feel obliged to say I think a 2 piece is the best option, at least I've see less slide and trueing issues with 2 piece clamps.  That being said, the @psychotiller  [RIPBA](https://psychotiller.com/product/ripba-mount) motor mounts are unbeatable.  The cup (for lack of a better word) slides on the hanger, placement is always correct and always straight.  The 4 grub screws are solid, you just need to pre-drill the hanger and use locktite.  I had to mill my Paris 195's to make them round, but I imagine you could do the same with Caliber II's.

Thanks for the review Mr. Maner!! 

For the record, Any truck can be used with my mounts as long as it can be milled round to 18mm. The easiest fits are obviously my trucks, randal r2's and r3's, seismic aeons, santa cruz road riders, Buck 195 Trucks, Paris, liquid attacks and even the gullwing sidewinders! 

A little elbow grease and these are straight, solid, reverseable and fully adjustable.

fits very nicely, sturdy. I used a twine and estimated the belt length, looks like at 265 mm belt. And yes I went and got some m4 16mm fits perfectly, needed some extra length for the spacer for the  cring to spin freely

Clip will rotate with the shaft, you'll need a washer larger diameter than the clip, just measure how much it is sticking out of the shaft, add few mm and get a washer. Mine is in the post already.

ok mind posting dimensions for the washer? since @twan already testing and know it works I can just replicate and order everything at once, 

so between the screws and motor there is no washer needed? just air, and you tighten until you hit the washer around the shaft? just for clarification

I received mine today! Fits perfectly to my completely round cheapy trucks. The 'teeth' on the clamp part clamp to the aluminium and dig in to keep it in place.

I'm milling a slightly larger centre hole though, but only part way through the mount to accommodate the circlip on the shaft.

Well i have to admit that i had 2 mounts in my hobbyking basket just for fun.....
Before check out i read all posts in this topic and i have to say: Jesus christ! 

This mount is so stupid designed and very dangerous in my eyes! 

[quote="twan, post:45, topic:27472"]
I'll just add some washers below the mount so the C ring spin freely
[/quote]
What? i would never do that.... also the m4 threads might bend, mounting the motor this way won't last long i think.


[quote="darkkevind, post:72, topic:27472"]
I'm milling a slightly larger centre hole though
[/quote]
:scream: lion-hearted!

Eboards are serious not fun, especially when you go fast downhill and your mount brakes :wink:
Sorry for disturbing but i definitely don't recommend this hobbyking toy!
Get a better mount, you save money on the wrong end.... also cheap gets expensive in the end...

stay safe!

My guess is they originally made them for 6mm shaft motors, then realized nobody was using 6mm shafts accept for Toy Store boards. There is no mystery here. You get what you pay for. You don't get well thought out designs for pennies on the dollar. 

Look at it...everyones mounting it upside down because it's not meant for caliber trucks. If it works well enough for 8 bucks who cares? If you have to enlarge the motor hole or use washers who cares? It was 8 bucks. If it bothers you and you want something well made. There are plenty of venders here on the forum that actually put in the time and money to design better mounts. Buy one of those.

But don't cheap out and then complain.

Yeah I understand,
It's nice to know the motormount also fits nicely on caliber trucks an not only on the hobbyking shit trucks.
But the 125kV motor looks like a very nice build turnigy motor. Tested it once on my other esk8 and it feels very powerfull and actually very silent. If you haven't yet a motor and are looking for a mount with motor these are just perfect.
The motor has sensors, there are no big gaps in the motor like in the Sk3 motors.

@lowGuido, for the motor shaft to fit (clearance for the circlip), you need only mill/drill it out half way, or even only a few mm in to the mounts depth. Thus keeping the integrity for half of the mount, which is actually quite thick indeed.

Oh thanks, yeah I will just give it a try if it works pretty well because we don't have big hills.
The motor looks very well built and runs super quiet! Also sealed so no small stones and stuff can damage the inside and sensors is awesome but I haven't be able to test them. The esc has 5 pins while the motor has 6, the motor has temperature protection I guess which the esc doesn't have. So I'm gonna make an little adapter to make it possible to plug it into the ESC.

In the video you can hear it much louder than in reality, I have also switched it with my other motor on my finished board and felt very powerfull and also very silent :slight_smile: 
I have also a small test video were I did a quick test for people who likes it to watch.

This is my opinion on this mount. Don't want to create a new topic to clog up this forum.

Hardware: caliber II 50°.
CTC distances: 57&82mm.
Width: clamp 15mm, arm 8mm
Bolts: M6x16,5mm allen
Mounting holes: 44mm
Shaft hole: 10mm

15mm of clearance

Of all 4 sides of the clamp, only 3 contact the hanger.

This is the only direction and the only side that can mount it.

Verdict: this mount doesn't work on caliber II. It requires either a shim or file the clamp.  The mount looks and feels sturdy.  I haven't tried to use it and to see if it holds only with 3 contact points under motor torque.

Any questions feel free to ask.
Hope this helps

If you get the hobbyking trucks, they come with a portion of the truck that's filed flat to make the mount clamp. It should make all four sides of contact.

To be perfectly honest and unbiased as possible, I love these mounts, they are the best cheap mounts on the market, they adapt to HK trucks, Caliber's and even Paris with some work. It's made from a strong alloy and I have yet to break or even slightly bend one after thousands of miles on them. It's the perfect size for most motor and gearing combos for both 50 and 63 motors. 

This is the mount I was able to adapt to Avenue precision trucks very easily. The motor, VESC and mount are all great, and the HK pulleys are the easiest I have used yet, the way they center into a flywheel core makes it foolproof for beginners. They are 5m 15mm wide 36 tooth wheel and 15 tooth motor with a KEY!! yes with a KEY!! The motor is a 50mm internally, but seems like a larger motor so it handles heat and beginner mistakes with ease, it's sealed and at 125kv perfect for any beginner over a wide range of wheels. I have used it with the HK wheel's, 90mm abex11 classic thane, 97mm clones off amazon and the abec11 107mm's...the 107mm requires different gearing I have discovered or dual drive systems, but the 97's worked perfectly and ran at 22mph on 36v, and like I said, thousands of miles on 2 motors, and 5 running motors without any issues yet.

I'm willing to bet that mount is going to be a hit if they can keep them in stock, it will be on many 1st time builds, it's a quality piece for a fair price. I have more than a few and just bought 2 more from a member here in the forums, and I'm sponsored by HK but I'll keep it real with you guys, I use HK stuff because I believe in it and was already using it.

 Ian is here on these forums in fact, the guy in charge of the HK skateboard stuff. I have more than a few requests in for different sized pulleys and more motor options from them (can you say 107mm?), stay tuned, I think they have some surprises in store for us and I'm glad to be a part of it. They can bring a lot of manufacturing muscle to this industry and that can help bring the prices down for all of us while getting some quality stuff.

Running perfect for hundreds of miles on a 180mm CaliberII 50...

The little shield I have tried on and off and it does seen to help keep those little rocks from going between your pulleys and belt so I leave it on. It has a smaller bearing at the end of the motor's longer-longer-than-normal shaft and it make a world of difference in keeping the pulleys aligned properly..These are the little things which you guys have all learned through trial and error being put into valuable products, it needs an idler pulley option next eh?

You say they are good for 50 and 63 motors, but the hole spacing is only good for 63 mm ones, as they are 44mm apart. Also I have the problem with it that the shaft space is only 10 mm wide and I have bought motors with 10 mm  shaft, so I will need to buy another mount because I cannot use those. 

Apart from that they seem very good option for cheap, waiting for them to be in stock to buy two to try even with that.

I have mounted the SK3 63mm motors on it without issue, but I do realize they are really 59mm, lol. Yes there is only one hole pattern though, correct. The thickness of the mount is what lends to it's strength but your right, it requires a longer shaft to get through it, and the HK shaft is even longer still to enter the bearing in the cover on the other side. If your using any motor from HK appropriate for an electric skateboard, it will fit. I haven't tried other motors because I don't have them and everyone wants a hundred bucks to play..

imo, the wheel pulley works better than all the others I've messed with, it's also lighter (less hardware). I didn't have to mod anything it was plug-n-play bit it did fit legit abec11 flywheel cores better than clones..the wheel pulley has a cone shape interface where it meets the wheel, in the inside so it's like it self center when mounting, pretty good design.

Extended motor shaft with key-way and bearing in the dust cover to support the motor shaft. there's also two brass bushing tubes to space the system perfectly and holding the wheel pulley in place on the shaft and prevent it from moving, in theory, you could lose both set screws on the motor pulley, and the key and brass bushings would keep the belts aligned and working perfectly to limp home, it gives some extra robustness other systems don't have, another feature perfect for beginners and their mistakes.

The mount is thick, but should leave you with enough room to mount the pulley. Overhang is not a problem, just make sure the grub screws are making solid contact. 

Some motors have an extruded c-clip that needs room to spin. I used washers to space the motor from the mount to clear the c-clip.

After seeing these photos and squishy's comment, I now regret my decision and wish I had gone with the Hobby King skate motor...

How long is the shaft on those motors? Since you mounted both mounts the same way it would have to be quite a long one for the belt to get over the thicker part of the mount (clamp part). I was looking to dual mount these but since my motors only have 25mm shaft I either have to replace the shaft or mount one mount upside down (if even possible, still playing) :slight_smile:

Length w/ hubs B w/o shaft (mm):71
Total Length E with shaft (mm) 108.50
so maybe 108.50 - 71 = 37.5mm?

I'll measure for you when I get home to check, but my guess is 37.5mm based on published specs.

Yes, HK. 

The thick part is supposed to be facing towards the middle right, so for the mount to be mounted at an ok angle you can either mount it on the left side with motor reverse mounted, or on the right side mounted under the board with significant clearance issues. Neither would work for me..

This is true for caliber IIs.

I just ran into the problem as well. Looks like there is some serious sided-ness to this mount, and it is fairly difficult to get it to sit well on the left side (which is the side most users would/should be using it on) for standard caliber II mounts without a fair bit of filing down. Overall for the price they are a great deal but they are not as seamless of a fit onto Caliber IIs as I was hoping (even for a right side mount, they don't sit flush: a lot of force is going to be going through those tiny M4 bolts.

By no means am I trying to do a dual motor set up - even for a single motor set up, it doesn't work well on the left side (where most right handed people will end up putting their motors) because their motor attachment section is biased in the wrong direction, meaning you need a motor with a very long shaft to get your motor pulley to seat properly. I'll take a photo when I get home to show you what I mean. This mount was clearly a) meant to work well only on the right side and b) is absolutely not a drop in solution to caliber ii trucks - only the 'caliber style' trucks that hobbyking sells.

The shaft of the Turnigy SK3 63mm motors is too short to get full motor pulley seating on the shaft with a normally positioned wheel. The only way you can get the pulley to fully sit on the shaft is if you can get your wheel pulley to complete clear the mount and have the mount 'nest' inside of your wheel pulleys cavity

Its because it's made to work with a particular motor, specifically the Turnigy skateboard motor with longer shaft for this reason..look through the threads I've posted pictures of the kit, I have several complete kits...for the kit, it works beautifully...but if you are taking it and using it for something it's not made for, then make sure you know that and take it into account if doing a review..If you use the correct motor and the rest of the parts, you'll see that the longer shaft goes into a bearing in the cover that is suppose to be bolted to the mount as well.. this is how it is suppose to work, so if you use the wrong motor yeah, it won't work well or how it is support to or designed.. `![20171217_132314|375x500](upload://yue1MKeUoqg1vTLHpyijkwFruhP.jpg)

this motor is the motor that mount is made for..not the sk3's...

I absolutely agree that if you are using it with the Turnigy skateboard motor then it is a more fool proof solution - in fact I agree with that sentiment so much that I never even bothered trying to mountmy SK3 motor, and just ordered a Turnigy Skateboard motor (should be delivered tomorrow!)

You'll like how it fits together, it's pretty robust..I think some people don't like the lower kv of that motor, but I personally love it due to the torque it has..

But please note that I said more fool proof, not fool proof - even when mounted on the right side of caliber iis, the two clamping plates halves of these mounts do not sit flush (meaning that a lot of stress is going through the bolts, which is a noted point of failure for these mounts), and on the left side, the thing essentially does not sit normally at all without filing down one of the four sides to a significant degree.

This thread has gotten a bit long, so I'm going to do a quick summary for any future newcomers that are browsing it... hopefully they'll see this random 219th post.

***DOES THE HOBBY KING MOTOR MOUNT WORK WITH CALIBER II TRUCKS?*** 

Answer: They only 'work' with genuine Caliber II trucks when mounted on the right side, which is generally only suitable for left handed people/people who ride with their body facing to the left. Work is in quotes because the two halves of the mount still do not sit flush with each other, even when mounted on the right. 

To get these motors to mount of the left side (for right handed people), you will 

1) have to file one of the 4 truck clamp faces down a significant amount
2) be OK with the mount plates not sitting flush (means the bolts have more stress going through them - buy quality bolts!) 
3) either use the Turnigy Skateboard motor that has a longer than normal shaft, or be OK with your motor pulley not sitting fully on your motor shaft (tested with a 15mm motor pulley on a SK3, and it doesn't sit flush)

Note: these points assume that you are installing the motor facing inwards. If you are OK with your motor facing outwards (behind the trucks), then other mounting directions/options become available. Caliber II trucks have a weird symmetry to them though so even the left-sided, outward configurations will have some unique challenges of its own.  

My personal recommendation is that if you are cash strapped, they are a great option (but will take some modification and are not a drop in fit as others have claimed in this thread for Caliber IIs). If you want a fool proof solution for caliber iis, splurging on the [wildly overpriced!] DIYE motor mount is your best option. Or, even better, just buy the actual Hobby King trucks that these were built to fit.

Good info! 

I think it may be worth it to use the Hobbyking trucks with this mount. Saves the time of filing and adapting the Calibers, and for $30 plus new bushings, they're roughly the same price. 

I have the Hobbyking mount on the Hobbyking trucks, but haven't tested yet. 
Does @squishy654 have any experience with the Hobbyking trucks?

I have a few pairs and I'm sorry to say I haven't put much time on them. the bushing seat looked a little weak with the cutouts and I quickly adapted the mount to Avenue trucks, and then to Calibers I already had...if anyone is near Sacramento and wants to try them, you can have a pair, but I have no time right now for shipping..I have 3 sets and I could part with 2 of them..

I'm using the hobbyking trucks and mount on my nickel board setup. Very simple to attach. I did modify the motor mount. I had to file down the plate so that my motor pulley had enough clearance to not rub against the plate.

 I am using an old evolve motor so the motor shaft is quite short. I also modified the truck to fit the enertion 12mm pulley. I milled it down with a dremel by 7mm.

After playing with these mounts a bit more, i would say I do not recommend them for Caliber IIs. Even with modification I'm still having issues with them. The crucial thing is that when you are filing them down, you have to make sure to file perfectly level, otherwise the mounts will try and bow/bend to one direction and sit off axis on the trucks, which throws everything off. Mine are doing this by maybe 2 degrees, and while not a huge deal, i know it is cause extra wear on my belts.

Another thing: if you put any major tension on the belt, then these mounts will actually bow inwards. Odd, because they look like they are pretty beefy, even though they are 'just' aluminum. 

Unless you are really strapped for cash, I'd just drop the 50 bucks it takes to go for one of the purpose-made mounts for Calibers. I ended up placing an order from one of the user-made options on this site yesterday and I think it'll be a pretty major upgrade.

yea I second this... these mounts are straight garbage. i spent a good 3 hours with a file, t square and a level to file my trucks to the correct shape, tightened up the screws, put on the belt, everything looked good. but I could push the mount so far that the motor pulley started rubbing on the wheel. it then can loose after about 2 minutes of gentle riding

Motor pulley on one side has to be set further out to account for the mounts thicker base. It's not out of the question, just no ideal, you'd usually want the motor gear as close to the motor body as possible.

I had success.   Though not the best fit and might not work with some applications. just need to off center one of the mounts and adjust with washers.   I would use a different! bolt method so you make sure you dont strip it if so use nut and bolt

Hi @yannik, Yes they do. Those are the trucks I have and I use the HK motor mounts also. The only issue I've had is that the Paris V2 hangers are so round and smooth that under heavy acceleration or braking they sometimes want to spin a little on the hangers. Simple effective fix: I tapped a hole in each mount (You can drill a hole and use a tap or simply use a self tapping screw as its fairly easy to tap the aluminum alloy mounts) in an easily accessible spot then made a small divot in the hanger right below where the tapped hole sits then drove a set screw through the mount and into the hanger divot. Quick, easy, and solid as a rock. I also live in Oregon so HK shipping very quick and at $8 a piece they simply can't be beat. Ps only other "issue" I can think of is that they don't make mounts for both sides, they just make one mount but all you have to do is flip one around so that the fat part of the mount base is facing the trucks not the wheels. This also allows the mount to get very close to the wheels and does not diminish their effectiveness at all. Hope this helps. Getcha Roll On!

@JonathanLau1983, All you have to do is flip the mount around so the fat part of the base faces the trucks not the wheels. Yes one mount faces up and the other faces down because they only make one style mount. It really doesn't look that odd when everything is put together, and it does not diminish their effectiveness. Problem solved.

@squishy654, Not true. Yes they will! I have had them mounted with dual rear 5065BR 140kv motors on Paris V2 Trucks for months now. You just flip one mount around so both the fat parts of the bases face the trucks not the wheels. As I've previously stated, due to the fact they only make one style mount, yes one mount faces up and one faces down but it really doesn't look that odd when everything is together. It also does not diminish their effectiveness whatsoever. Also, while it's true that this mount may work "better"with their kit or on some particular setups, with minimal effort they can be effectively adapted to just about any style setup. I realize some people simply lack ingenuity and are not very handy, but the vast majority of DIYers will have little or no issue in adapting these mounts to many different applications as a GOOD DIYer doesn't necessarily need everything to work perfectly straight out of the box and most would rather pay with a little time and effort rather than with their wallet. It's a whole nother level of satisfaction & pride when you build your own shit and make it work rather than paying through the nose for some other fool to do it for you. Getcha Roll On!
