Looks great dude. What's it like riding? Speed?
Did you need risers for the trucks? Cool touches. Love the graphic!

@cryo whoops i posted the wrong after pic lol, i dyed both sets of wheels that dayüòÖ  @Lionpuncher, it is much smoother than my evolve gt, gets over 20 mph no problem, goes up hills well and feels really nice with the vicious grip! I just added the bluetooth module last night as well (havent got to see my top speed yet) üòÜ and yes i had to use 1/2" risers but dont mind the carviness they added

@stormboard1 i used a blank deck from skateshred.com for about $40 and sprayed black flex seal on the bottom after drilling out my enclosure mounts

 Yea really like having the module installed. Using @Ackmaniac 's  app. Didn't even bother with a volt meter to keep it more stealth. The app is amazing. Even without the firmware (struggled loading it, will be revisiting in the spring), its so convenient to have access to all the metrics. Love how this community pushes with passionate innovators.

@stormboard1, just buy polyester dye from the fabric store, get a pot big enough for 4 wheels, bring solution to a boil then remove from heat. Wait a few minutes for pot bottom to cool down and stir continuosly. Drop in wheels and wait 45 minutes. Clean with soap n water and finish with an isopropyl wipe ‚ò∫
@joeadams101, i havent got to test the range just yet cuz work and seattle weather üò£

@joeadams101, im guessing around 14-16 mile range with mostly flats. It accelerates quite nice for a single motor! @stormboard1, yes it has lasted very nicely.

A couple of changes to the board with TB 218 trucks, much thinner risers and a dual idler mount from @marcmt88üòÅ. The clamp on the mount feels waay more secure than the TB motor mount, great work!!Just waiting on the belts and the weather to take it for a ride!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/8/a89bc8014ab89393300e82bcfc3e1ae40860142e.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/f/7f87187d9b816d930c07aa6db15f240eafd173fa.jpg" width="281" height="500">

@stormboard1, the flexseal holds up perfectly. No primer, no clear coat üòä

Yours was sealed tho right.. mine sanded down to the wood so thinking the primer and clear coat will help seal it..hopefullyü§û

At least primer then, i dont think a topcoat of clear would be helpful. It may interfere with the flexy nature of the main coat. Either way i believe itll hold well.
