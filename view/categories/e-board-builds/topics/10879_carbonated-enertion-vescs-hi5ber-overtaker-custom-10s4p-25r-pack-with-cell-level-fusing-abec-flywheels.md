Just a quick, slightly off topic question (don't mean to hijack), but can that voltage meter be used directly on lipos?

@Titoxd10001 I got the wheels on now, but working on solving the wheel bite issue with 97mm wheels. I think I'll just have to tighten the bushings. Even with 1" risers, it'll bite with these loose trucks.

I was wondering how the wheelbite situation was. I had similar build idea but calibers shortened wheelbase to much and also had to get a board with cutouts and now no chance of wheelbite with 97mm abecs.

UPDATES:
Finished up the drive train tonight and everything's pretty much set. Just have to wait for the wood glue holding the cells down to dry. If this doesn't secure it to the enclosure i'll probably end up velcroing it down instead. My BMS was also DOA, so I'll be using the pack without one until i get a replacement. Hopefully Raphael's battman bms will be for sale soon :)

Done!

Some notes:

* Reverse mounting with the TB v4 mount is inadvisable (Keep in mind it's not even possible unless you chop your mounts like me). Even with 97mm wheels, the mount is less than inch from the floor and will definitely hit when going off driveway sidewalk lips. I've brought it as high as I possibly can on 280mm belts. Any higher and the 63mm motors would be hitting the trucks.
* 26" wheelbase is not enough for the space cell enclosure. I'd very much rather inward mount the motors, but space limitations prohibit me from doing so. I could've moved the enclosure forward to leave room for the motors, but this would mean my from 2 screws wouldn't be screwed in on the enclosure due to the way the board is shaped.
* One of the motors fails to detect the hall sensors properly when spinning the correct direction. Oddly enough, it detects the sensors when spinning the wrong direction. I've tried changing the phase/sensor wire order around but no dice. Always works in the wrong direction, but never in the right.
* My BMS was faulty so this thing is running without balancing for now. I'll minimize risk by charging to 90% max and discharging to 20% min.
* Wood glue oddly is good (so far) for holding the cells down to the enclosure. If it breaks I may swap in some industrial strength dual lock.
* I haven't ridden it outside yet due to rain, but I'm really worried the motors will get a beating from dropping down slight heights or hitting holes/speed bumps.

Yea i'm not entirely happy with how low they are either. I can think of a couple ways to fix this though. The most preferable way is to obtain longer trucks (best bet is to get salvaged Boosted trucks since they're also Caliber). Another way is to get an angled riser to bring the mount up just a bit more, or chop my current 1" risers to be angled. Lastly, and least preferable, is to get 2 longer mounts, but 280mm belt is the longest I'd want to go.

I'm not so much worried about the mounts hitting the floor as I am the motors.

Installed angled risers to get the motors further from the ground, chopped some screws so they don't hit the motor, and replaced a faulty motor (thanks @JLabs) . Sensored now runs perfectly! I can't say I'm in love with the nano-x though since the throttle travel is tiny (just like the winning), but I haven't had any cut outs so far. I also don't like the position of the throttle when you're gripping it. It's wayyy too far back and leaves your thumb in an uncomfortable position. Riding just a couple miles made my hand start cramping up. Hoping to pass this thing off to @evoheyax soon and use my benchwheel remote again!

33+ mph. Range is really situational since I live in an area with a ton of hills, but I get about 20~ miles here. I imagine you'd get 25+ miles without these hills. No need to PM cost, it was about $1400 all-in-all, but I haven't kept track very well.

Would you say any of your builds would outspec any board out there for the sake price? 

Considering the cost of all these builds I can't discard the idea of getting a Raptor 2, better specs, lower budget. The only benefit going DIY is the immediate availability of parts for a shorter ETA,  that great learning process and the self fixing knowledge in case something needs to be fixed.

Any commercial board? Yea, but commercial boards have their perks too. In terms of raw performance, I'd say it's better than the top commercial choices out there (Evolve GT, Boosted 2, etc).

The Raptor 2 has yet to be a proven product so I can't say it's better or worse than it. So far, there's no hub drive board that can outspec belt drives.

well each cell can deliver 30a peak so i definitely don't want 10a rated wire. The fuses are only there in case of a catastrophic cell failure, thus the 40a rated wire.

That makes sense cause for 4p to out put 40 amps, it would be 10 amps from each cells. But the cells are rates for 20 amps continuous.

The reason I highlighted was cause Jinra used copper 22awg wire for the fuse. 

I think the cells can output over 40 amps when they fail.

## \#31 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-11-22T03:06:30.977Z Reads: 388

Yea current output is based on voltage and resistance. If they fail or short, you can see VERY high amps (in the hundreds from a single cell). It can also blow before 40 amps if the wire gets hot enough, but it'd normally be high current that causes it to heat up that much.

While the pack can output 80a continous, you'll want to be further away from 80a in order to prolong battery and cycle life.

Did you ever measure the KV on the Polar motors?, I'm guessing they are 170KV actual.

Small update:

Found out my BMS doesn't actually balance my pack, but only provides overcharge protection. I thought my cells were going out of balance as my voltages were all over the place. Discovered that a bunch of cell fuses broke (could be vibration, could've just blown, my guess is vibration). So I repaired all the fuses with double fusing now since it's so much of a headache to re-fuse the modules.

At least what I've learned from this is how to measure individual cell voltage in a parallel pack. When I measured voltage from the fuse wire, I got similar readings throughout each cell in each pack. This was my ultimate mistake. While the cells *seem* to be the same voltage, I should have probed on the actually contact terminal of the cell to get the individual cells voltage. Straying too far from the cell terminal will instead get me a reading of the parallel pack voltage.

Now that all fuses have been repaired, just have to wait for my Bestech BMS, then I'll most likely have to repair even more fuses in the future.. In hindsight, I should've just soldered the buss bar straight to the cells.

@jinra Concerning cell level fusing with fuse wire...

Two things: 1) I love the professionalism of that build, looks great. 2) Please don't take the following as the rather grumpy message people often try to send on forums to disrespect others, I'm genuinely likely to copy your battery design very closely, so just questioning for my own peace of mind, not in an attempt to rubbish your design!!

The fuse wire... My understanding of fuse wire from uni is that it melts at a given Amperage and that is normally within or related to the ambient temperature. The temperature gain is not necessarily linear, i.e. if 0 degrees above ambient at 0A and T degrees above ambient at 25A, (where T is melting temp, say 400 degrees), then the wire will not get to 200 at 12.5A, or 300 at 18.75A, that would be a linear behavior and unusable!

However, they DO go up in temperature as they approach the current limit, and when they do blow the molten metal can splatter about a bit and is still conductive. The higher temp when near the current limit and the splattering of liquid conducting material on breakdown are why fuses are ideally contained in things, like translucent plastic (cars) or little glass tubes (domestic plugs).

- have you ever measured the temp under load of those fuse wires?
- Have you checked their conductivity (/resistance) at nominal temps?

Both of these may be published by the manufacturer, electrical components are rarely supplied these days without details. I'm sure you've had them in play for some time so now trust them...

- have you ever had one tested, i.e. had a cell fail and the wire blow?
```

Thanks dannyboy, that means a lot.

To answer your questions, I have no measured temperature. I don't have an IR temperature reader and the setup is in an enclosure for which I cannot hastily get access to see the cells. I have no tested resistance

The fuses that have blown always blow dry. There's no spattering of anything, it just simply breaks, which likely means that it's not getting "molten metal" hot. However, I'm slowly, but surely replacing all the fuses with double the fusing and non of those have broken yet. 

I have not had a cell thermally runaway and fail, but then again I'm not 100% sure since I dont' have a temperature reader. I imagine my double fusing would blow as well in thise case anyway.

To be honest I decided to go this route as an alternative to spot welding my pack since I dont' have access to a welder. My soldering station does get hot enough to easily fuse these cells, however.

If I had to do the pack over again, I'd probably go with 20awg wire instead.

[/quote]

Just to avoid spot welding? (lack of a welder is definitely a good reason for that! I'm going completely nuts and making my own for fun out an unnecessary amount of components and effort!) Or are you sticking to thin wire because that gauge is known to fail at 20/25/30A or whatever your chosen max current is and effectively give you per-cell fusing?

I guess the losses will be very low because they are very short runs (1.5cm?, so x10 x4 = 60cm in total for your pack there?) at 20A that would be 8W total, so utterly negligible as compared to the 720W your board would be pulling at 20A.

Yea I originally thought my wire would be able to take 25a continuous. Since thats obviously not the case, I think 20awg wire would be a better choice (at least from my provider). My battery max is set to 20a per cell so you're right on the money. Each wire is about 2-2.5 cm

If the screw head can go into the hole, using a washer won't work. The washer is too weak to hold the trucks together with that force. Plus the screws are countersunk and will be above the hole.

Recovered from my concussion and ready to try again. My accident was, I suspect, from a shorted motor. Replaced my motors with @JLabs motors and setup FOC again. With both the previous (@Kaly's) motors and my new motors I have to double the observer gain to avoid constantly hitting over current faults when I throttle too fast.

Hopefully this doesn't lead to another concussion

No fuses this time around, spot welded with solder wick reinforcement.

Nice. I my fuses were also falling off and breaking. I think I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and get a spot-welder.

Thanks. For some reason they looked wider than half an inch to me in the pic. So I guess you bought 6 in length strips and cut them to the sizes you needed with a dremel or something?
