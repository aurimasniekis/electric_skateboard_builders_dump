Is there's someone with the enclosure skills to create an enclosure that fits the dual escape heatsink?

It would be cool if there was an enclosure specifically made for this so the integration can be flush and easy

Most flat bottomed enclosures should accommodate this?
I may be getting a dual escape enclosure from @stewii so Iâ€™ll stick it in a build and see how it goes.

Yeah most flat enclosure would no but at the screw lids there's some kind of rounded lips that needs good precision cut
