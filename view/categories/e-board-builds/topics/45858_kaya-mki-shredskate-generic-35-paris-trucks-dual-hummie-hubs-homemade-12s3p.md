This is my first build, Been on here for a bit but have been doing research in to boards (Buying or building) for almost a year so it has been a long time coming! I really do think electric skateboards/bikes/scooters are a means to a better future and eventually I am sure everyone will be zipping around most cities with one or another.

So Basically where I'm from (The great New Zealand) public transport sucks arse and is expensive, it costs me around 5 NZD per day (3.6 USD) to get to Uni and back and thats with the concession card, also a large amount of days there are full buses so they wont let you on or they're just straight up late.

**Parts**
- SkateShred 35" Dark wood Base 
- Dual Hummie Hubs 
- Dual FOCBOXs bought on the cyber sale
- Winning Mini Remote
- Black Paris trucks with stock bushings
- 83mm Abec front wheels
- Homemade 12s3p Samsung 30Q Pack with cell level fuses
- 12s 80A Supower BMS For charging and discharge
- Homemade Kydex enclosure

This is an In progress build and I will update this thread when I've competed more.

**Build**
![image|690x388](upload://3WCVGVNiqlturz7My52Epqzs1Vi.jpg)
I Started by siliconing the individual cells together in groups of three (After checking individual cell voltage) and then wrapping them in a layer of electrical tape followed by a layer of kapton tape. I soldered straight to the cell with a 80w Iron that has a fat tip and it took maybe 2 seconds of contact to create a really good joint, I know there is a lot of debate over soldering vs welding but to me soldering works and I guess time will tell. The busbars are made from a 2mm pure copper sheet which I cut into 8mm wide bars, The fuse wire is 22AWG tinned copper wire from Remmington Industries.

Then I attached the Balance wires checking voltages always and heatshrank the pack. The exposed copper got some neutral cure silicone to slow down corrosion.

The patch you see is waiting on the uni labs to be open again so I can laser cut 'Kaya MKI' into the grip tape then stick it on.

**From Here**
I need to build and form the kydex enclosure, I also need a way to secure the battery and FOCBOXs to the board as the enclosure will act more as a protector (I was thinking some kind of velcro) am open to suggestions. Also waiting on the Hubs to be finished and sent, If anyone is headed to NZ from the US and doesnt mind being a mule for the hubs let me know as shipping is going to tear me a new one.

Big shout out to @Hummie who has already helped me so much with this build, true champ.

Nice work on the batteries but the wires seems too thin to handle 15a.

I think he will be fine. I would worry wether the fuses will melt at the intended current.

We are using 0.5 mm^2 nickel wires for fuses and they hold up to about 30 amps each. 22 awg is ~0.3mm^2 and copper is i think 4x (?) more conductive.

According to this -
https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wire-gauges-d_419.html
22awg will not be able to carry 15a, not even close.

hundreds of feet of 22awg house wiring is very different than 1cm of it in a battery ðŸ¤£

Of course the resistance grows with the cable length. 
I couldn't find a single table says 22awg copper cable can handle 15 amps.
I'd wish to be corrected wrong because it will save me a lot of trouble with my next battery.

go read through chakas thread about cell level fusing.

Yup, When using fuse wires the gauge differs.
The right table for fuse wires -

Thanks!

On the first look in tge engineering toolbox page i was also slightly confused at first :)

Yeah It is confusing you get random values from different sources always but this video helped me clear up any confusion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWZKIr5BcU0 it shows a 0.4" length of 30awg tinned copper wire from the same people blowing at 19.6A so I knew 22awg would be fine

I finished the build a while a go, but forgot to upload videos.

So here they are! If you have any questions let me know.
