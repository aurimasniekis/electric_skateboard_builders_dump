First, this build was only possible because of @psychotiller and @chaka so huge thanks to both of them.  This baby has gone through a lot of changes. It was formerly known as the “Red Rover” but it’s no longer red 😂
Anyways, everything is on a DIY deck that will be getting replaced relatively soon.  I’ve got the Torqueboards 6s2p pack and I have to say, I don’t really like it, It sags a ton (almost 40%) when going up long hills, it is great and well made, just not what I needed.  I’ve got Paris clones for trucks with the @psychotiller mount on them that he donated.  On that mount is the Tacon 245kv 6364 motor donates by @chaka.  All that is sitting on top of some monster 1 inch cable risers that were made by me with a block of wood and a router. Anyways, here are some pics:
