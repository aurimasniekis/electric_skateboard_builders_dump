Hey, the time has come to ditch the old thread and make a proper one. This is my first build at a V.1,4 stage or something. The board was running months ago, but I had an enormous amount of trouble regarding TB Vesc's.
![DSC09045|690x363](upload://iLzIFw2rwMrRAh5WvxHum1aP48T.jpeg) 
at the moment the board's setup is this:
Slick revolution deck with nose guard, the back end is trimmed.
I had to dremel the **** out of the truck mounting sides so they would move freely. Also I made it a drop through deck.
Dual TB 6374 190kv motors
@
70a per motor,
40a battery draw,
Flipsky 6,6 based vesc,
Tb trucks with Caliber base plates,
Slick revolution wheels, 14/38 gearing with 15mm belts.
My bushings change on a daily basis.
12s5b battery from 25r cells.
I'm not running a BMS at the moment but have one incoming.
The board has a push to start switch, that sometimes works, and sometimes does not.

What I like, the power, the speed, this thing is surreal, coming from a Koowheel, this is an amazing step up.
What I don't like, still fuzzing around the Bluetooth module that I can't make it work. These wheels are fine on a rough track and they really do give confindence riding on small rocks and so on, but they suck a lot on anything, that is not buterly smooth, it's basicaly like riding on plastic, for this, I'm thinking of 97mm 76a duro eskating wheels. My enclousure sucks the most, 60 cells take up too much space for this deck, and side tolerances are a joke. ATM I'm looking at a wider/longer deck, and I have some a3 2mm kydex sheets coming for another enclousure. So here's my ride guys!

nicely done. Its hard to imagine how you got the 60 cells in there without top mounting. how were they laid out? two rows along the deck and double/stagger stacked? the colors blend well together too

I believe that RX and TX have to be switched on VESC for module to work. EX: Connect the RX port on the BT Module to the TX port on the vesc,

So the joy did not last long.
![image|690x371](upload://93lsLWmwc9d8Nsopu6GPjfmL8Wx.jpeg) ![DSC09082|690x388](upload://9YArFCRS8TrUTjeYXo77mXdDslu.jpeg) 
I was tideing the board with enclosure left a side and heard a pop.
Good thing the other side still works!

![IMG_20180923_142636|375x500](upload://wLCqgnK7uSgqOWEP4OAzYwcfk5A.jpeg) 
![IMG_20180923_143958|375x500](upload://maGW7Gib20rd5WBMvzk11FUnn38.jpeg) 
And since one motor is off, I have started the V.2.0 Of the board, one of the things being striping the paint of the motor cans since they don't hold all that well. Replacing bearings and resoldering new wires, just need to pull out the statorr somehow.

I have some 2mm ABS coming, so I have made a new box for forming it and making a decent enclosure. All other bits and pieces like gromets, bolts, washers and so on are also coming.
I should have a new, bigger deck any time soon. The only thing still bugging me are the wheels, I find there duro way too hard. So I have a question regarding them.
SR AT wheels come in 110mm diameter, I do like the bigger size wheels and with out dropping a fortune on 107 abecs, my best bet would be 97mm Eskating wheels, that have a 73a duro.

I got really used to going over things safely, would a 13mm smaller wheel take that away?

I run 14/38 - 2.71:1 gearing. It gives a lot torque, and I would like to gear up a bit with those smaller wheels.

I have these options: 16/38 - 2.38:1 wich should leave the top speed about the same and still maintain a good amount of torque.

Or 18/38 - 2.11, wich increases top speed, and should have a much smoother acceleration, but I think 2.11:1 is way too low for 190kv motors? 

My concern is not actually acceleration itself, but decalaration going at 40 and letting the trigger off, the board jerks my to the front a bit, and I do find it extremely dangerous. So I think gearing a bit more for speed would reduce that?

BTW the new deck came in as I was writing this post.
![IMG_20180924_135548|666x500](upload://9n9AJyn9Hk3Xa84vzeAf5xhiddy.jpeg) ![IMG_20180924_135627|666x500](upload://yC8arQAec8NhIqelO12WKKDQ3jZ.jpeg) 
It's a Jet Invasion Transporter deck, coming at 39 long and 10 wide.
This will solve all of my issues regarding the enclosure.

I really didn't mind that SR deck, it felt good flex and concave wise. I think they sell it with 8s4p haha. You managed to squeeze an extra 28 cells on the bottom üòÅ

I went from rough stuff wheels to 97mm clones to 97mm evolve stone ground to 7inch pneumatic. Using 107mm superflys now and then are a dream. Next board will have six shooters. Rough stuff were definitely the worst of the lot comfort wise

Honestly I struggle to see the purpose of them. They are hard as plastic, give you a tiny grip surface on the flats and don't make much of indifference on grass or anything like that.

Mbs wheels that have been run over a belt sander are way better. Failing that 97 plus bug fat thanes- the difference between real abecs and clones is night and day however.

Gave the deck a red, a bit fading coat of paint, and I'm halfway way through rebuilding the first motor.
Edit, I'm definitely keeping the Slayer theme going.

The new enclosure is done, shaping 2mm abs by hand was not fun and tolerances are not perfect, but with a rubber gasket everything should be just fine.

I made the end piece from different material or order to be able to switch it in the future, if I decide to change my bullet connectors since I kinda like mt60 ones. Now I only need to finish griping it, sort out the LED lamps wiring, rebuild the second motor and swap my vesc.

I still have to get the final 3 orders of fsecs 6.6, ubec and longer mounts.
While rebuilding the second motor, I have found a broken winding, so it's either single motor riding or searching for a second 6374 TB and using the stator only.![IMG_20181026_183518|666x500](upload://z8FAGVgNTXs33v3sK1Pfpx7j3Ez.jpeg)

I prepare for those torque moments when accelerating past 20 mph full throttle and anticipate the jerky moment when letting go at full throttle. I believe some of that is inherent in esk8? Is there a way to curb this?

Since the issue is basically just the drag, increasing the size of the motor pulleys should help the wheels spin the motor easier, thus reducing the drag.
And here we go again!

Soooo...the fsec and ubec are installed, the only things left are to wire the light switch, put a resistor for a back light and solder some connectors. So at this point I could put on one mount with a motor and start riding her.![IMG_20181102_182925|375x500](upload://baAvpJAlJPgQKZmB1YW82timnBt.jpeg) ![IMG_20181102_183357|374x500](upload://8MDaJHei0zUPkbdNCnnbkAhIfQ5.jpeg)

So the last steps are being taken.
The LEDs wiring needs to be finished.
I have used one of the older mounts, butchering a slot in it, in order not to have remove the pulley from the motor, once my other mounts come in. At the moment I have like 7mm of clearance only. Also shorted the switch on the push to start, since it broke, and did some cleaning on the electronics. If everything is good, tomorrow I should start using it, it really sucks a lot since I found one of my motors is kaput. So to the final build I'll still be needing one motor, and probably even longer mounts than Dickey's makes.![IMG_20181105_181313|666x500](upload://eNdAz03JlY7JjNssvio5iA8nCfj.jpeg) ![IMG_20181105_181431|666x500](upload://m842YgnLw7IFjk2uqYCFUeWDYlz.jpeg) ![IMG_20181105_181349|374x500](upload://49S305cBwl29DLuepHRBM8Ks309.jpeg)

Not the happy completion post yet, but I'll do an update. The board is up and running greatly, all the changes I've made from the V.1,4 build really stands out, especially the enclosure and the wheels.
![IMG_20181112_171058|666x500](upload://uS7YTsudQOXPsLMALPAqbHmIZUD.jpeg) ![IMG_20181112_171035|666x500](upload://tpHNe8EYauUamGRhRUI5sC94nF5.jpeg) !
I already have the mounts from @dickyho but  I still need to get another TB motor. Also the front led gave up after first 50 meters, so  a new chip led was bought.
The board is already beaten a bit. One thing I really don't get is the gearing, I went from 14t pulley, to 16t one, but my wheels went from 110mm to 97, I can really feel the difference in torque drop, even then the last used single motor settings were 70A motor, 40bat, and now I'm using 75a motor and 60a bat.

Happy new year everyone!

I will try to keep this thread alive in some sort a way and do a small update!
![IMG_20190105_132909|666x500](upload://hWckbn8zxUHdr9FSPXkVHnkpkJV.jpeg) 
![IMG_20190105_132851|666x500](upload://rHNAEV2wf1S6Kz5NpLpMy783rMT.jpeg) 
I have been riding it with a single motor with dickyho mount wich slips about 5mm down but holds strong from where.
I have pulled the trigger on alien hev 170kv motors and pulleys for them, I did not found a logical solution of buying only 1tb motor, I really hope they will pull and keep strong.
At the moment I'M tinkering with the led lights, changing the led chips, placement of the rear light and maybe I'll add a small led strip, if I will find some space in the enclosure for another voltage convertor.![IMG_20190105_134114|375x500](upload://ts6NulJeWidWbC6iRxFwJ7eC77M.jpeg) 
I'm really surprised how clean the electronics department looks after riding, compared to the last board, a major improvement!
![IMG_20190105_133114|666x500](upload://9ZD08nLl0kAw1ZYllP2oLlslXfT.jpeg) 
So sum it up, I will install new motors, modify the second motor mount a bit, will need to make a spacer for the idler pulley, reposition the rear light, make the front light work again, re do the lights conections, I'm still looking  for a shorter switch than the one i have, but can't seem to find any. The deck needs re griping in a few places, and i should spend some time choosing the bushings for this thing.
For the very future plans, i'm really thinking about gummies and maybe surfrodz, but the truck choice will be determined by plans on keeping this deck or not.

Resolder new rear light connectors to small jst plugs.
Put another convertor, from the existing turnigy one, to get a 3.6v output for the front light. I have some flashlight stuff coming from China, that I'll play around with.
Set the new motors via bldc toll and she will be rolling!
Well I still want to clean up my enclosure wiring a bit tho.
Have some skateboard cash left, so I'm deciding between the two: Photon, or gummies, I will mock a 125mm plate up, to see if wheelbitee would happen or not.

Boom![DSC00466|690x388](upload://yZ6HPOyKKQmoVOZ63x23lHsVjJQ.jpeg) 
So everything is tightened and loctited.![DSC00483|293x500](upload://uw2u4esax5yZF4XavZM9QjnhIrp.jpeg) 
The only test run done was inside, since we have loads of snow.![DSC00489|690x388](upload://lR3a66zh1LUPVeqg9n9oT8FVzFG.jpeg) 
I finished up sleeving the motors this morning.![DSC00492|690x330](upload://bRLk9a7icCXih8ybnTJP863w9DV.jpeg) 
I would say I'm 99% done with the board, one plug for the rear light and a new for the front is needed.![DSC00503|690x388](upload://cIgLw0mG6cAXquezOx4QPWtXvJ5.jpeg)
I will probably take the board to an underground garage to test it.
I did these settings:
Motor 70, brake 60, battery 40 and regen 15.
Now somewhat interesting part of this build. I do feel that the board is complete, besides new remote and gummies upgrade.
In total I went through, bought and used these parts.
2 decks
2 sets of trucks
3 sets of wheels
4 motors
2x TB vescs
2x 6.6 dual fsecs
3 remotes
10+ pairs of bushings
10+ pairs of riser pads
3 sets of motor pulleys
2 sets of wheel pulleys
15+ pairs of belts
3 pairs of motor mounts
Honestly 1000+ pieces of nuts, bolts, washers, spacers and so on
2 front bumpers
3 bmses
I think with all the tools and bits and pieces, this board costed atleast 2x the price of only raw things standing here. Still worth it tho, the process was fun!

Finally I have a working light! This intricacy took 3 hours to make, including 2 re-dos, small BMS touch up, and push to start wires redone.
![IMG_20190128_181931|666x500](upload://jHZyNyYoiJVAsEIfTn8CM9WRdWS.jpeg) 
So I made a sandwich from 2 converters.
![IMG_20190128_181914|666x500](upload://th9yVmuWHt9tzKLMZYhNKUj8l61.jpeg) 
The big one is the main one, small one only for the front lights, so that I could easily swap lights and always have a desired voltage from 2 to 18v at 2amps max.
![IMG_20190128_181759|375x500](upload://5Q5iPYVdxGY66GetWcL46mmJXrS.jpeg) ![IMG_20190128_182217|374x500](upload://leYRHleK0Tj9rAVAXA2Uev5rMrX.jpeg) ![IMG_20190128_182106|375x500](upload://6sFVDlr8dNaKOsYigpn3BVTLWrY.jpeg) 
I made both lights easy to connect-disconnect for enclosure removals. A few front light parts came to the country, so some future updates will be here soon.

Now a side question, I'm already thinking about the next future board uptade, and came to this idea, 13s3p 40t pack? For ~6e a piece I would not mind pulling the trigger, this pack checks a lot of marks in what I need in my future build, but I did noticed that the cell is not very popular, so what do you guys think? Semi light, 12ah battery pack with 100a discharge for 350 with BMS? thanks

So I might be adding a third voltage convertor for this led strip and maybe I'll add some blinking to it, space is so tight, that I will have to find a shorter button. Also will rewrap the Vesc and redo resiver wires.

Hence the post above I will have more spare parts from the Slayer. I had a koowheel once, that was run over by a car twice. So I came up with this contraption.
![IMG_20190204_174312|375x500](upload://ivaebSQFLQN5YjZoJ43cfp49Zmh.jpeg) 
Size wise I hope to use the TB Vesc, if It will contact ƒçia USB. But I have a spare dual Flipsky 6.6 with only one side working.
I guess the battery will be a joke, but it's something for now.
I will make a fast and dirty kydex enclosure, straight up spark plugs and buy some kind of cheap Rc remote locally.
So much for now!

I ordered a cheap eBay remote, if things turn around the way it looks, I will be buying the Arduino based spot welder, and see, maybe this quick and dirty, resurrected koowheel project will get a new deck and battery upgrade! I think I would leave the original case and put a fresh set of 20 30q.

Oh, the trampa order is almost here, pulleys are on the way, and I am in for the surfrodz push on mount order, so things can get very pretty for my Slayer, also these are also the parts for my next project, a more exotic and premium build :slight_smile:

Funny thing, I have not ridden this board for around 3 months I think, and before that, I have only ridden this deck with single TB 73 and 97mm eskating wheels and an old Vesc, this is my second 6.6. For absolutely unknown reasons, slave side burnd while on stand by, just sitting on the table. I only got it because they offered like 60% off, of a new one, but when charged like 40 for shipping and I also got customs taxes. All in all it performed well while it did worked. I would just buy the unity :D 
The weather here is like this.

Whether sucks too in Belgium but you can stsrt to see some few moments of dried roads. Also in my case the slave side burned, but was during riding. Not sure what to do.

So the happy 100% completion post.
I have a few voltage converters installed.
![IMG_20190213_190250|375x500](upload://8JwCmxBYKnSnNfHxf9jqCYB1Pz9.jpeg) 
They all connect nicely to the board, that has wires integrated from now on.
![IMG_20190213_190250|375x500](upload://8JwCmxBYKnSnNfHxf9jqCYB1Pz9.jpeg) 
 The rear light has a fixed output, front light and truck led have each a separated adjustable voltage converters, so I could easily swap them around and always have a desired voltage.
![IMG_20190213_190219|666x500](upload://A3xS2g8RNZibKXebmvYthbzlwSt.jpeg)

![IMG_20190213_193133|666x500](upload://xSQU9Zb3WSk2RnLl49v38FDFI0M.jpeg) 
I call it complete, as I have nothing more diy wise to do.
But it's not rideable, atleast not with gummies, who are missing pulleys. They are on the way. Also photon remote and surfrodz will be added to this setup in the very near future.

I went to the post office 3 times today, already got the pulleys, and the belts are just perfect. I wonder what's the actual top speed on this thing is, even in eco mode it pulls a lot. Sad to say, gummies are not coping well with slightly moist roads and cold temperatures. Not the config builder for speed runs now. But OMG they really do roll over everything, the difference from 97mm wheels is just huge.

Riding update, the board is treating my nicely, kept swaping bushings until today,  maxed her out at 44km/h safely. Gummies are insane, atleast for me, eating everything up, my terrain possibilities really widened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nFzXm8PTSo&list=UU5z4ymcbXaZYSJncBkPSGzw&index=1

the battery sag is pretty big, i can feel it after 20km. Expected a bit more from this battery. What else, the front light gave up again, photon got sent, still waiting for trucks from @psychotiller 
I really do like the board, besides the range factor, it seems to be build up well, absolutly no rattle or any sound, bearings roll great. Just one more upgrade before the building of this board will stop for some time, and a few new projects will arise, canibalasing the current board.

So I took an old 3d printed light case from eskating and dremeled some material from the inside.

![IMG_20190312_160919|375x500](upload://5ZWiH0lRpyMGyS5KoLMRvdoQo3N.jpeg) 

Used this cone reflector from a cheap flashlight and replaced with a led I had.

![IMG_20190312_161346|375x500](upload://ru49fLzyV5dtGGwwXrSiMYXMAFp.jpeg) 

I also filed the case a bit and glued in a jst 2 connector for an easy plug and play and a bit better looks. The whole case was shrink wraped.

Got the photon remote hooked up yesterday, it did had a few connectivity issues while riding, BUT at one point the board kept acelarating and did not slow down then pulling back the trigger, so I had to bail. This is the aftermath.

My next Urban Slayer build is not due until auttum, so I just bought the same Jet invasion deck again and hopefully will rebuild it this weekend. I now have the abillaty to fix the mistakes I made with this version.

I ordered some leds specifically to fit this enclosure style.
Things left to be done:
Shape it one last time.
Fine cut it sand it and drill it.
Spray some black mat plasti dip.
Lay in all the foams.
Instal the electronics back.
Take a look at the photon remote  again.
Ans also surfrodz cleared customs! 
She should be born again some time next week I hope!

And she is rebuilt, I'm literally waiting for the battery to charge up.
I could not say that she's complete, but should be rideable. 
I have some dampening sheets and seals coming from eBay some time next week, when all the electronics Will be cleaned up.
I'll take a moment tomorrow to check the photon.
If all goes well, this build will only need that surfrodz geardrive from @moon  and that's it, well and lemps. Enjoy

Standart outside diameter with 10mm inside, you need exact number @moon ?

I took it out for a few longer runs, the board is a bit on a noisy side with out the proper pading and sealing.
I love surfrodz, i now understand how higher speeds become more common. Board with the enclousure is really really stiff, I now think of it as a turbo charged limo. Hopefully next week the inside will be re done. Unfortunatly Photon still refuses to work. Over all this is mind blowing, the second build on this deck really came out a lot better, I feel much more safer, stable and over all more solid with the board under my feet.

This must be the longest I have used this board with basically zero issues. But a few came around. All of the suden the board stoped charging. No particular reason as to why, since not a finger was put on anything. One of the motor shafts came loose from the can. And with not all the bolts beeing of best quolity, with loctite, dust and what not, I had to invest in these. It's not really easy to reach the screws holding the shaft.
![IMG_20190428_103336|666x500](upload://8Cr4jfMhdOKbCRvSTUpah2F5SAg.jpeg) ![IMG_20190427_120136|374x500](upload://1yFHOEoVpgdkzDcX2IgriQO700A.jpeg) ![IMG_20190428_103321|375x500](upload://vlJPH3O3D2vlpwozFtT4WNFrTnt.jpeg) ![IMG_20190428_103256|666x500](upload://AkzM8MyMjQoHpCEwF2OEHLNsWm7.jpeg) 
I'm pretty sure I f****d the motor bearing taking the can out, since eventually I managed to only remove 2 screws holding the motor to the mount. If all goes well, today will be spent finishing disassembling the rear end, cleaning everything up and making her able to charge again. Tommorow I will assemble everything back again, put a new bearing in and loctite for good. I'm pretty sure it should hold just fine until I get the geardrive.

On a side note, I have started 2 new projects. 
A landyacht dinghy, wich will be a 10s3p hub cruiser. I have already bought the complete longboard.
A second build is way more ambitious. An urban hummie. It's already at Senders place beeing worked on.
I will reuse my Vesc, trucks and rims, but will go pnaumatics route and build a new 12s4p battery for it. Hence these two upcoming builds, I have bought a Mini spot welder, lipo for it and a whole bunch of 10-18g silicone wire.
More on these later!

Edit:
I still can't get the photon to work, I have made a video of the issues I:m having. The signal is inconsistent, the actual remote freezes. A bunch of problems, maybe someone would know something? https://youtu.be/pnZQzGx-xmw

![IMG_20190430_143554|375x500](upload://n5P0tve9qJHyMbbE7yaweM5TDV8.jpeg)

I do ride the board fairly hard, for it beeing so low and only having gummies on. The plastidip is gone and scratches are appearing fast. Eventually I will make a new one and maybe use raptor coating on it. Don't have any alu washers on hand, so the ugly ones at the moment.
![IMG_20190430_160330|666x500](upload://yRrDmRpaUKSwOemEXlDqhxu8A6m.jpeg)

Small weekend update, the enclosure is going really slow this time, but should be done by next weekend.

![IMG_20190525_200750|666x500](upload://4QW09KiaqIWinhYr6tLVi48ctCQ.jpeg) 

My mini A spot welder apearantly was damaged during shipping, the + connection to the board was, fixed that and tried some welding.

![FB_IMG_15588042884663309|375x500](upload://bDGfXEk5ziP68KYXFUruHScoh6d.jpeg) 


Also soldered all the plugs to the flipsky 4.2, but I really don't think I will be able to change out the resistors.

Hey guys, random update time!

So finally the enclosure is of the mold and is being sanded.
Will probably just paint it plain black, until I'll gather some money for some kind epoxy bedliner spray.

![IMG_20190529_130100|666x500](upload://kkBLaGSkfSFfxICaf7xmvSm3qzS.jpeg) ![IMG_20190529_130124|666x500](upload://5ZhazmCCPAPFbBItj75L6Nk3IGT.jpeg) 

The board is a mess, the motors wires are being resleved for the new enclosure, I have sanded and started to apply lacquer on the exposed wheel wells. Also will do a fresh wrap on the bottom after I'll add a few inserts. Photon got an industrial sanding, since a new FW is up I will try once again to make it work.
![FB_IMG_15591240360732315|666x500](upload://oLudJSXSZ8x8DxikzRoea6OD9iA.jpeg) ![IMG_20190529_130211|375x500](upload://hMorqL3IjQQDynemwZS3Q6SzZ2u.jpeg)

And a small make over on the hub motors for the dinghy.
![IMG_20190529_130159|375x500](upload://vql2wHYSP5UBLXAJzbiclcXpq9G.jpeg) 

Trying to sort out a battery for the dinghy,  a 10s3p will not really fit in a single stack, so atm thinking of going 10s2p with 30t or 40t cells. 

Should have a hummie and a dinghy in a months time, so a lot of things to do and figure out.

Quick progress update!
Managed to match all of the inserts with a new enclosure, added a few more, aplyied fresh vinyl wrap on the bottom. Made a simple LED light mount in the rear and re-done the motor wire sleeving.
![IMG_20190530_174308|666x500](upload://dQla2vmH5yOJyncP49vDsu6zXRN.jpeg) ![IMG_20190530_173746|666x500](upload://yFD3jRrL3O5HT0WrROw9uTUsb9f.jpeg)

On a side note, the dinghys drive is setup.
![IMG_20190529_195059|666x500](upload://cJWdVmqTZdiUkF9dUytdOuc2rqn.jpeg) 

So this should be a final update, once the enclosure will be sanded and painted. I still have a few things to do, like resolder bullets, change the back bearings, a few screws here and there, but pretty soon I should be able to throw in a trampa dongle, loctite enclosure bolts and focus on a hummie and a dinghy.

@rey8801 yes I did, I just have a bit of patience, I was personally quoite surprised by how easy you can mold it by hand, once you find the right patern.
Sunday update guys, I'm trying this light set up:
![IMG_20190602_134109|666x500](upload://ebv18YTd428FJIM3IolgcksbIlb.jpeg) ![IMG_20190602_134144|666x500](upload://kU7AhhW45BD8fuq37XhJZJbYqhw.jpeg) 
It's not deep of a cut, should I be woried?

And and I'm still sanding btw.

@nuttyjeff
I don't have a lot more pictures than in this thread, but I can try, this is fairly easy to do.
 
Since you have all the freedom to do what you want, I first made a rough sketch, of the shape that I want, where I would like to put a charge plug, lights, cables and so on. Mind you the sketch is really rough:
![IMG_20190502_183925|375x500](upload://epsfoOrL398F7qPn6yLDrgGZUdp.jpeg) 

When I glue a mechanical drawing paper on the deck and draw all the edges of my components, well basically the perimeter of all electronics:
![IMG_20190502_183939|375x500](upload://2rJwx1Qe4jaFA6hXkiXJwDhiOx5.jpeg) 

Once I have all the lines, I just screw on some small wood logs straight to the deck (I do have 2 of the same decks, so I butcher one)  this is the not so detailed part, but I just keep going adding wood and making the shapes that I want:

![IMG_20190502_193900|375x500](upload://octpX6p0GvS3jCdpBHWiKSLZUly.jpeg) 

Once done you end up with something like this:
![IMG_20190508_101946|666x500](upload://pRRBEC1nxs58EjPM2ORW2ZepgiH.jpeg) 

When I screw one end of abs to the deck and just start heating it and shaping by hand, really the trick is to work in small areas, heating them to a really pliable state. It takes some time tho, the first one took me something like 5 evenings to shape, the last one I done in a few days, depending on how smooth the mold is, and how long do you want to sand it, the end result can be very nice.

Quick update!
So the enclosure is done and test fited.
![IMG_20190604_202333|666x500](upload://rXrkSeDcsC3fzeLycGt58cB0egM.jpeg) 

Test fited all the electronics in a 5mm neoprene.
![IMG_20190604_193728|666x500](upload://s69zVSzym1l4VU2i6IySmR2pRyo.jpeg) 
![IMG_20190604_201300|375x500](upload://mckHnnvGUPTh5OxdbksAd0XQXnz.jpeg) ![IMG_20190604_201324|666x500](upload://yy8YdC7UkY7OGV8HorSeP3RK7Bd.jpeg) ![IMG_20190604_201337|666x500](upload://pOyuEegGmblk4ed8eyfO5HZvgjK.jpeg) 

And as for my light solution..
![IMG_20190604_201417|666x500](upload://wboPXMqCi4vHE5E9oqiByEWDNdK.jpeg) ![IMG_20190604_202315|375x500](upload://eQS3laP08Rp2uVcZV51twRTIupZ.jpeg) 

These are great! At 5v and 300ma I think, produce a huge amount of light for the size, 3‚Ç¨ for the pack of 5, easy to replace, no reflectors to deal and so on. O was looking for a short but wide throw LEDs and these just fit the bill perfectly.

In theory I just need to resolder a new P group connection and the board is up and running. In real life still need to finish the inside, like the antispark, voltage converter and few cable reroutings, also I really need some new belts. And even with these fancy inserts I'm having trouble with a few and still need to sort those out.

So I never do get to do a proper final update, this time the voltage converter had a short condensator, wich somewhat destroyed my push to start, one enclosure bolt is cheated, I had to put a cheap Chinese insert from the top, cuz the fancy one doesn't holds in any more. So waiting for a new push to start, also will need to buy a new voltage converter and sort out the front lights and a switch for them, enjoy.
