Hello all, 
This is my 1st post here so hope its in the right place..
My battery size is 30L*20W*4H (CM) and I cant find the right enclosure to close it.
Does anyone can recommend something?
Tnx in advance.

20cm is pretty wide. What is the battery configuration?

More normal width for a battery like that is 140mm wide. That's why you may find trouble sourcing an enclosure.
I've made one enclosure that is wide like that but it's very deck specific for the Earthwing Supermodel.
