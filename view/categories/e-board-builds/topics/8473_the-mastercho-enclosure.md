After talking to @lox897 I remembered I forgot to post about my enclosure I got from MasterCho. 

So after lots of talk between @MasterCho and I a few months ago, my enclosure was finally made and delivered to me. It's a fiberglass (planning to buy a carbon fiber one later on) enclosure, and it's fairly solid and stiff, a little flex when twisting it, but not much at all. I requested matte black, and it looks great in that colour. It's one of the final pieces in my build, and I couldn't be more happy with how it turned out. Thanks MasterCho!

No it is composite fiberglass polymers on the stiff side.

Nice! Look forward to your future designs.  When I got the enclosure I was amazed, but I've never worked with something like it. How might I go mounting it to my board? Will using a normal hand drill do just fine? What screws would you recommend?

Yes,the hand drill should work and I would use T-nuts with M4 screws and rubber washers.

tight fit, just checking are the dimensions for enclosure include the flange, so external measurements?  Also, can you do anything in white or white carbon fiber (which I did not know was a thing <g>)?

Yes, that's external measurement. If anything shorter than that 10S4P with other electronics won't fit in.

I know there is Silver Barracuda Fabric – 3k, Aluminized Glass which is the closest you can get for the color you are looking for. But it's going to be a special order.

That is nice stuff!  Hate to try and evaluate color and texture with pictures, but this looks like it is too silvery.  Need it to disappear into existing deck white fiber composite more than pop.  Still experimenting with sizes and shapes, may have to go with custom to get it right.  Maybe able to use one of psychotiller's standard enclosures for the immediate need and then swap out.  Right now its tupperware lol!  Pix below are outline of 23x8"

Is Carbon fiber conductive? It is not as good a gold, copper, silver.Yes,has some resistivity depending on the density of the carbon.

I use one layer(0.2mm)of CF and Glass Fiber. :thumbsup:

Hi MasterCho, your enclosures are all so beautiful and I am looking forward to your new board with built in enclosure that you are working on too. I'm wondering though what gives your enclosures strength.  Is it safe to assume that the enclosures are layered this way ?

epoxy
fiberglass mat
epoxy
carbon fiber
epoxy

Is there still flex after all of this or have i missed something ?  Just wondering how rigid or flexible these enclosures are.  Once again great work, and i look forward to buying either an enclosure or Board from you in the future.

It's stiff, you can't bend it by hand and a little flex when twisting it.

Plus you might want to use a dampener under the enclosure. Probably, it gives another 2-3 mm at least.

I don't know if this is helpful, but I'm going to be utillizing a material called Dynamat to reduce vibration and resonant frequency. https://www.amazon.com/Dynamat-10415-Self-Adhesive-Deadener-Speaker/dp/B00020CATC/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1477534988&sr=8-6&keywords=dynamat
Any box will have some level of acoustic resonance that will rattle, squeek, or just amplify road noise with an annoying tone. This material is used primarily for high-end car audio applications, but I have used it on my guitar and bass speaker boxes, kick drums, and cymbals. It's easy to apply and it really kills a surprising amount of vibration without adding a lot of thickness. There are also some cheaper options on ebay that are still pretty decent, but Dynamat is the industry standard. 
@MasterCho  My overall point is that I think this material would work very nicely with these killer CF/Hybrid enclosures! IMO :grinning:

I can answer that.
It's not flat; it's curved just like most of the decks.
I added some extra 3mm lip. Battery packs up to 29mm thick should fit fine.
I suggest using a half inch thick dampener around the lip to seal the gap.

Amazing job, yet again! Your enclosures and carbon work are beautiful!

If I got one of these, first thing I would do would be to hit it with a thick layer of clear plasti dip, to give it some extra protection against the  world. These enclosures are so pretty, I would hate for them to get all scratched and dinged up.

Good idea!   Yeah, It will be scuffed up in a matter of time. 
The resin is more scratch resistant than Auto clear coat.  If it gets scratches, you can apply another coat of resin and polish after a light sanding. It will be as good as new.

The board switches to hover mode and encases you in a carbon fiber Iron man style suit once you hit 40mph. After that, I heard the Redstripe propulsion mechanism kicks in that derives it's power directly from the wrath of Satan. 

So yeah, I think the board can handle two stripes. The real question is what happens if you add a third.

Thanks! It's really Master Cho's enclosure that did it. It's a work of art. I couldn't throw it on my old board and do it justice. So I got a new deck for it and took a little more time on the paint job.  I thought a nice semi-gloss black would be a nice match for the CF enclosure. 

I'll finish it up after the holidays and post a pic of the final version.

Any chance you could make a "medium" size? 18"x7-8"x29mm.

I can't find a suitable short deck to fit your large enclosure and your short enclosure is too small to fit a large pack. 

A medium would be about perfect for 10S3P dual or 10S4P single 63.

For your 10s4p, you need one on the right.

I pulled one out last night as a prototype without polishing the mold for the matte finish look. The problem was, it was quite stubborn to be de molded, so I am planning to polish it as I usually do.

It has a nice amount of flex, it's like a firm feeling since I used two layers of 200g plus 600g of CF.

Update.
I think it looks better now after trimming the edges. :slight_smile:
The only thing that I would improve at this point is the edges should be thicker where the screws go in so that it has more support from the stress.

I've seen both torqueboard enclosures as well as Space cell enclosures (first hand experience) crack at the mounting screw due to thin plastic content on those spots. Definitely worth reinforcing.

Glad to hear this actually I made my big ass lipo enclosure have big honking plastic nubs on the side of it to hold nuts onto the bolts I drive through the board to hold all my stuff on.  I had a few 3d printed plastic straps break at the screw attachment so I just went way over kill with it, but makes me feel (a little) less dumb that the guys actually manufacturing stuff have some shared problems with us little guys :).

@MasterCho would one of your enclosures work with the Custom Skateboards freeride deck?  It's a loaded vanguard clone.  

http://www.customskateboards.com/blank-longboards/Blank-Freeride

I need either a single or dual enclosures that will hold a MEB 12s2p battery (21*140*300mm flat or 35*140*220mm folded) and a TB VESC.  This is for a single motor 6355 build.  I'd also be interested in your GT2B mod if you're still selling them.  Please PM me when you get a chance.

Hi,  I am building up a Hi5ber Wasp soon (only ordered board and Carvon V4 speed drive).  I am interested in your enclosure.  It has a wheel base that says 18.25" - 20" on their website.

I am figuring I will need a 16 inch enclosure just to give myself room? What do you think? Can you do custom size like this or do you only have the 13 and 23 inch ones? Also can you go thick enough to fit (2) layers of 18650's ?

Yes, only 13 and 23 inches are available. 
 If you want, I can make the lips thicker(3-5mm) of the 13 inches one to fit 2 layers of 18650's, it might look slightly bulky.

Also, in the picture of the board, I noticed that there is an indentation in the middle of the board I am not sure how the enclosure is going to sit on it.
