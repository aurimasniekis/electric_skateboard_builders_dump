I bought them separate because i didn't want the wheels and I was going to use the deck with MBS Matrix II trucks but Ted Orr from @trampa informed me of the 35° bend in the board that works perfectly with their trucks.

Looks awesome man! I'm curious to know if those wheels can go offroad effectively. I've kind of been wanting an offroad board, but I like the stealthiness of a regular board.

Nope. The MBS can't go full off road. I run them on both of my boards and they kill everything my ruff city streets throw at them.

I'm currently rethinking how all the components are mounted underneath the board and instead put it all in a box on the back end or between my legs

I'll be exploring other battery types for the reconfiguration.

Hali, you should work on lithium ion pack and a segmented enclosure, the build looks great but the electronics at too thick. Don't do the box on the back you will loose the coolness. Just my opinion.

I have to sacrifice something for better range, at the moment I'm getting 4.3 miles.  Note, I'm a heavy rider 280lbs so I'm using more power that i'm carrying underneath the board.

Are you getting 4.3miles for all four batteries. If so I think your cut off voltages maybe​ to high, id expect at least 10miles minimum. How are your batteries wired up, 8s? What's your top speed?

4 batteries, Turnigy 5000mAh 4S 25C
first config, 2 (5000mAh 4s) in parallel to a vesc = 4.3miles total
second config, 2 (5000mAh 4s) in series to a vesc = 1.8miles total
3rd config occuring this weekend 2s1p with a splitter feeding both vesc

I should get what @Titoxd10001 expect, I'll report back later.

Looking around to buy a battery pack from either Kaly or Barajabali depending on price.

Check your cut off voltage on the vesc's and check capacity if you're​ charger has that option. Something is not adding up, you should be getting decent range

Took her out for a ride this morning using Current mode, coasting when i got at speed which got me to 3.38 miles before reaching 3.4v per cell.
I got fed up and rode the board till the LIPO battery voltage tester stopped chirping.
Also noticed that the batteries weren't being charged to end voltage level on the Imax B6ac 16.8V(4s)

@Titoxd10001
battery cut off start: 10
battery cut off end: 8

Ordering a custom 10s7p

Maybe one of the lipos is defective, but either way with you're new battery you'll never have worry about range again lol

check if your belts are getting hot. maybe they arent loose enough! you can burn a LOT of power on belts if they arent set up properly!

even though, nvm, can see in that picture that the belts are rather on the loose side :slight_smile:

for dual motor and urethane wheels, I think you can get as low as 11-12Wh/km, single drive down to 9Wh/km, pneumatics single 15Wh/km+, pneumatics dual 20Wh/km+. thats my experience at least!

Thanks, so i think its the batteries weren't charging to 4.2v per cell and me 280lb rider weight.
I'm looking at 3weeks of downtime to get the battery pack from **Barajabali.**
What to do in that time? - Sell my Kitesurfing gear to pay for the battery pack.

How tight are your axle nuts? If they are cranked down too hard, that could create extra rolling resistance you'd have to overcome. Also, on the flip side, it's hard to tell from the pics, but are your axle nuts screwed on all the way? To me, it looks like the nylon part of the lock nut is not fully engaged, like the axle is to short or something. And with almost 300wh of energy, you should definitely be getting closer to 10 miles of range, unless you're constantly braking and accelerating hard during your ride.

Axle nuts are a 1/4 turn off from tight, all the wheels roll smoothly, they sway back and forth like a pendulum to a stop and the nylons are engaging on the axle.
I'll post my vesc settings for inspection later tonight, belts have a nice tension.
I bought new lipos - while I wait like a kid on Christmas for @barajabali battery pack - to keep the board on the road.
But yeah, I should be getting better miles than a Boosted board, then there is my weight.

Hi halifax21, I currently build a Street Carver with battery below the deck and 11S4P. I'll open up a build thread, so you can see how we do the build nice and clean.
