Seems like a decent list of parts :slight_smile: What enclosure are you going to use? Are you sure the 38" has enough space for all your components?

Decent list. First get the enclosure and after that start making the battery

I was worried about that so I'm redrilling the front truck mounting holes on the forward most parts of the board they can go it should get me a couple of inches not sure on which enclosure yet

Hmm, that might mean the wheel wells won't match up, but we'll see. Apparently there's also a 40" Ethos deck, maybe you want to switch to that.

They're discontinued Ill make sure they line up. this isn't my first rodeo I grew up in Ventura ,ca all I did as a kid was bomb hills and street skate.  Ive modified a lot of longboards. Im very aware that this is a different animal üòÅü§ô

Edit: I fat fingered the above paragraph had to fix the typos

guess Keda is 190kv right?....Good gear ratio, as you are big guy....you will have plenty of torque, but top-speed will suffer. In the future, you can tweak it to get a little bit more  of the two worlds. For me, a fun board reaches 50km/h (31mph)...not that i always go that fast....but sometimes. I am also 165lbs, so i can always decrease torque to gain top speed.

Good luck on your build!

Updated im tearing down my diyeboard .  the xt connector melted together . also my diy eboard trucks broke when taking off the mounts they tapped holes for the grub screed and drilled through the hanger all the way to the axle. Im glad it didnt snap while i wss riding. So far today is full of suprises.
