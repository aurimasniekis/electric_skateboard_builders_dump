Hello guys, this electric skateboard building addiction is getting out of hand so in order to be able to sleep at nights I decided I neeeded to make another e-board :pensive:

I just finished today and I'm in love. I already had several boards an eMTB (The Pho3nix), a grab-mall board (The Biohazard) ,a brand board with hubs (Raptor 2), a fast board (The Darth Maul), so this one is the kicktail board (The Colateral) because "cola" means kicktail in spanish :hushed:

I wanted a very fast board, with a deck which is stable at high speeds, shorter than the Raptor, comfortable to ride anywhere, not as heavy as 37" board and with a kicktail, so everything came down to this Colateral.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/VYpKNm2.jpg[/img]

Now that I've just ridden it for the first time I know these are the next upgrades:

1. Change the motor pullies from 15T to 18T, the speed was lame
2. Upgrade my batteries from 10s4p to12s4p, need to finish the DS enclosure
3. Paint the green border on the deck to black
4. Change the color of the led power button switch to a blue

These is my current top speed calculation, not a good combination, I need more speed, at least 32MPH.

So after the upgrade I should be getting this:
![image|429x500](upload://gCkY6BOXc5F11BvoOT4Ou7Wc8rA.jpeg) 

Here are some pictures of the build process hope you guys like it, I went through so many issues, so this might help anyone looking for a kicktail board:

The first challenge was to look for 35" kicktail deck with acceptable wheelbase, nothing came close to the Moonshine Sidekick, so I placed the order on Muir:

![95b29ab7-9ec2-4ce0-9186-0f7ba5e69b11|666x500](upload://jkv9OJdAjFd2HBuN1HRVIXzveCD.jpeg) 
![89b187d4-2bae-4485-acf7-1af0f7befe04|666x500](upload://2YeAhhvGbUQQALWzTqY1iwZbVRf.jpeg) 

Then, manufacture an enclosure that could hold a 10S4P battery, 2 Focboxes a BMS with room for wires:

![6874b513-c36c-4b03-99dd-4e11f222bed3|666x500](upload://3sfrJuwUJ8fbxeCFPa75632s23d.jpeg) 
![image|690x425](upload://otQo63ItGqBVBwHi2tbole5xvIr.jpeg) 

However, when I test fitted the enclosure I ran into another issue, the motor mounts were too close to the ground and if I turned them towards the deck, they will hit the enclosure wire covers on full leans:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/ktc0jkN.jpg[/img]

So I had to completely redesign the enclosure and moving it towards the nose, I'm happy I did that, the look is more sleek and there is no clearance issues anymore:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/JB7BEJK.jpg[/img]

The battery was another challenge, I used this method to creat 1S4P safe packs:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/IpZe6uw.jpg[/img]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/Czp9qh9.jpg[/img]

I had to get creative and came up with these two 1S4Ps

[img]https://i.imgur.com/JZfZIce.jpg[/img]

Here is the final 10S4P battery:

I wanted the Boa Hatchlings pretty bad but they are still very difficult to get, so I was offered to upgrade to 100mm constrictors, nevertheless, this was a mistake, they were too big for this deck it, I didn't like the look of them:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/0XXuy8T.jpg[/img]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/XnHxsVk.jpg[/img]

I already had the Biohazard with 85mm caguamas, they were a bit hard, not very comfortable to ride them on rough pavement, so as soon as I knew software Caguamas were out I jumped and placed the order directly from Orangatang, they gave me a much better look:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/YrVEvND.jpg[/img]

For this esk8 I wanted to have really nice trucks with some rake so I went with Surfrodz 176mm, the problem was fit them with motor mounts and keep hanger as short as possible, just enough to fit 2 6355 motors, so I had to addapt @torqueboards mounts and put the hangers in the lathe and use grub screws to hold them in place:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/KDDNoTB.jpg[/img]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/FJkkXyd.jpg[/img]

I always liked the look and convenience of having a switch on the top, I hate everytime I need to turn my Raptor upside down just to turn on/off the board off, soil my hands, so I placed the switch on the nose just over thw center of the baseplate:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/cJsmD9D.jpg[/img]

I ran the wires through the deck and the Riptide tunnel risers:

![1dafce9b-c8c3-424c-83d1-72322ddda50f|690x388](upload://i8NJaLQIOfEDhM6SxstXMm75Oxb.jpeg)

[img]https://i.imgur.com/gRzpEPr.jpg[/img]

So after everything was installed, I regripped the deck with Vicious, best griptape ever:

Nice build 👌👌👌
One question to the battery pack.
Why you connected the positive terminals first on the taps and a second time on the top of the cells?
Wouldn’t it be enough just to bend the nickel strip up the cell and than connect all of them?
```

## \#4 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2018-09-26T05:22:16.124Z Reads: 364

```
I had bad experiences with bent nickel strips to connect P-Groups, they tend to brake due road vibrations, besides you need 4 nickel strips to withstand the current flow, restriction between P-Groups could cause cell drifting and heat accumulation, so it's much better to use silicone wire.

The enclosure is meant to be scratched :fork_and_knife: , it's just pretty before the first ride for the picture. You can always detail it with sand paper and spray paint

Sorry I think I wrote it maybe a bit unclear.
I was referring to the nickel connection in one of your p-packs.
There is a nickel to connect the positive terminals directly on the terminals and one on the top of your cells.
![image|359x500](upload://lzHqn7Y9mVYegp0wEL3GGZmjiF9.jpeg) 

Wouldn’t be the top nickel strip enough?

In fact, yes it is enough, it's even better for cell level fusing but I don't think they will represent any harm, it might even help with current flow between paralleled cells.

The two decks aren't really comparable in construction, and I've heard a lot of good things about the Sidekick.

Sidekick is vertically laminated with what looks like an improved version of the urethane rail from the Loaded Unicorn series, and I know Moonshine says that line is water resistant.  I can say from experience with the Unicorn that the urethane rail does 100% diminish normal road vibration, and I would expect the same from the Sidekick.

Tayto is a traditional, lightweight maple, 7-ply deck - which is why I bought the Tayto to use with my UNIK boards kit and blue Kegels.  

The Tayto is exactly what I am looking for in a ten-mile board (and I have a Mini X, aka the most over-hyped board since the Acton Qu4tro).

All that being said; if I had to have _one_ board, and _only_ one... it might be Alan's Sidekick. 

This one looks like a production prototype; I have no higher praise to give. :)  

Good hunting

Nice build. I’ve had my eye on this deck for awhile. I’m a huge fan of shorter kicktail decks that are stable at speed. I usually route my phase wires through the deck LHB style, do you see any issues doing that on this deck?

Place it on top of the enclosure near the nose, it's always rewarding to kick tail your board up and plug the charger without bending yourself down for once.

Hey amazing work, so sick. Got a favor / question.... I just got the outlaw last week and wanted to see if you could / would be open to making me the enclosure I need for it..... I’m thinking it should basically be the same as on your build here since it’s the same shape and just the bigger brother to your board as they say on their website... so an extra 2 inches longer is all from what I can tell.... right? I needed the bigger version since I’m a taller dude at 6’3” 200 lbs but not sure how to make it as clean & waterproof as possible with the grab rails / curves on the deck....? Pretty please and thank you in advance. Not sure if it matters but I have a 12s3p from Miami electric I can use on it, or, I have a spare r2 battery coming this week too.

I can do it, but I'll need the deck here to make the enclosure edges to follow the shape of the deck.

Unfortunately, shipping the deck back and forth would cost a little bit more. DHL is like US$ 50 to Lima and US$ 50 to ship it back.

Maybe a wiser option would be to buy a new deck and keep it here

Great looking board and nice battery. 

I'd put some individual strips of tape over the solder spots and over the nickel welds just to lower the risk of wires/nickel vibrating loose or moving around causing shorts IF they'd get loose.

I have both decks ..I was gonna pick up his sidkick in a week or two and I'll test fot it on the outlaw to see if I wanted two..I'm sure it will fit the decks are very similar in every way but the middle is longer by 2 inch each side..so the pocket the rocker drop in the deck will be a bit longer but I bet lil bit of love with sand paper and grip tape on the bottom side ..lil bit of love and a foam gasket it will fit..but if he make one longer a couple inch would save that 12s4p issue he had with the sidkick..but I'm probably interested in this also

Ok cool @sk8l8r  if you guys can wait a week or so I'll get back to you on it ..I've been pumped big time for these enclosures..these decks are so fun..it would be awesome if it fits both decks ..I'm sure it will be very close I'll line them up again tonight when I get home and snap a pic of them side by side..but I know for a fact the bottom shape is identical just longer by couple inch ..be interesting to see..if not I'm in for sending @Eboosted what ever he needs to get it done..the outlaw length is the same as hooch @mmaner  and the elixer I want to get and build a mini trumpa urban carver off of I think still thinking  ..all these boards are very similar core shape just tail and nose shape are different..so would be nice to get a longer one going ..if possible..how about this what I can do is when I get the enclosure I'll be test fitting it on a bunch of moonshine decks at my friend's DH shop in Toronto so I'll keep you updated on it ..I'll have to see what they have left for inventory I'll be stopping by there this week

word @sk8l8r  and hells yeah @Frenchy that all sounds super good and glad a couple others are liking these decks and want to try them out as an esk8. Super fun (and really well made) decks. Those were my thoughts exactly though is just extending the middle section by a couple inches (whatever the difference in size is) since it's the same shape and just a bigger version of the sidekick @Eboosted just did. I have no issue with a little sanding and using some extra foam gasket it should be just fine! And like you mentioned it will probably solve the space for battery creativeness issue. Why griptape on the bottom @Frenchy or are you just saying use that instead of sandpaper?

Yes @Jansen you can use sand paper too..just tape it down ..but if you put grip tape ..not aggressive grip ..just some jessup.. on the bottom of the board it will stay on there nice and you can move the enclosure from side to side to get a good shape of the deck ..Als enclosure are fiberglass and Bondo basically it's a Corvette shaped as a sweet ass bath tub..lol..lil bit of love does wonders..

ahhhhhhhhhhh i get what you're saying and thats a super good idea bro! Will def be using that trick in the future on this build and others too. Hells yeah! You cant use a heat gun on fiberglass to mold any spots like you can with a psycho enclosure can you? I did actually just hit psycho up too cause he lives close by me and last time I was at his house a month or two ago he was in the middle of doing a build for someone with the outlaw deck I have so I just text him to ask what he did on that and if he might have a mold for us that's already done and made for the sexy ass curves this deck has, Keep you posted once I hear from him.

I'm using 2 x 16awg wires between P groups, that's more than enough to handle 80A, 40A for each motor.

Btw I changed the 15T motor pulley by a 18T and now the board is addictive to ride, smooth as butter, I haven't got anything even close to a speed wooble, it turns more than a really loose truck, it rides like a dream, even with the 10s4p it pushes more than the Raptor 2.

These are the next steps:

1. Finish Sidekick DS enclosure
2. Upgrade the battery to 12s5p
3. Paint the deck in matte black with car paint
4. Make a nice grip tape design
5. Upgrade the bushings of my surfrodz

You'd upsell laser-cut grip tapes with all your enclosures, my friend.

I mean, I'm having one made right now to match your cutouts on the Evo Falcon enclosure for the Carvon.

Grip tape is very high margin and no drying time.. :slight_smile:

Thanks man! I purchased this deck thanks to your find, so glad I did. It's the most fun deck to ride I ever had, I don't know if it's because the extreme turn ability or high speed stability of the surfrodz trucks, or the comfort and grip of the blue Caguamas, or the perfect size of the deck so I don't need to move my rear foot to use the kicktail, or the fact I don't need to get down the board to jump over curbs, or just kicktail it if I need to charge it or turn it on/off instead of bending over, or how easy is to mall grab it from the trucks, or the awesome shape of the deck, I don't know but there is some magic around it... :mage:

@Eboosted where were you able to get a 18t 15mm motor pulley? I’m looking for myself!

So after some weeks I decided I wanted to try a double stack enclosure in order to fit a crazy big battery for this short kicktail. 

I was able to fit a 12s5p on it. 

![20190104_161521|690x388](upload://woL9G6r8IXbI6T3XPDb7kIIBy5k.jpeg)

There was a lot more room left so I connected a full BMS for charge and discharge, I chose the Bestech HCX-D596 80A, I'll try it at 100A though hope it can cope with the battery.

![20190105_164058|690x388](upload://owCmp7Wis3tabXerjdUZqq3exZF.jpeg)

Here is the final board, as I upgraded only the electronics and not the trucks or wheels you will see some wear on them, so it's not going to be posters shots.

Then I went for a test ride. 

OMG I'm never going back to 10s4p, this esk8 has given me new feelings, the stability at high speeds with loose trucks, the turning ratio and the acceleration are freaking addictive, I get to 55km/hr as soon as I push the throttle to the max, I have to apply a lot more force on my legs to keep on balance. 

But what I like the most is the feeling of compactness, nothing on the board rattles, feels like a tank, a one piece mechanic part.

The wheels are soft and the sound of FOC are making my commute so so short.

Straight up my favorite deck by far ..beside the lack of power and boring speeds of 35kmh of this blink s2 build compared from my diy.. I still grab it for mid size rips all the time. Because I can shred this deck hard.
it's my girlfriend gonto board now she loves it
So I'll be buying the single for the sleeker look and route the deck out like i did here on the blinks2. Some pic of it complete once again I can't break it any more warranty is gone now lol..

Dude, I agree with you guys and have nothing but good things to say about this decks older brother too and I absolutely love the outlaw! It's honestly crazy how much more comfortable and stable this deck makes riding, boggles my mind! I actually did a swap with my raptor 2 set up and used a TB 218 front truck to give it that much more cleaeance/stability with 97's and it's definitely my go to everyday board. Almost want to get this deck you @Eboosted has to make another build that's just a little smaller as I still have the psycho enclosure that fits either deck perfectly .  ![IMG_9792|375x500](upload://wyGrYxoMNEeuQZ4EYNMIdIXCuYd.jpeg) ![IMG_9793|375x500](upload://lYCxq2108ZOMQonWvSyfLHdvsBL.jpeg) ![IMG_9835|666x500](upload://tI3aZoTZGmvCou6UAmuIkyASo07.jpeg)

The riding is completely different, I never felt such smooth and soft wheels on any board not even the Abec 107mm superflys. So bigger wheels not always give you better shock absorbing.

Have you tried orange caguamas as well by any chance? I have the orange ones, and am contemplating if it's worth spending 90€ just to upgrade them to the softer blue ones. I find it hard to believe that these feel better than superflys... 

Also, have you tried Olllin's Popoca wheels? Just want to know how they all compare, since I'm about to order parts for a new board too :)

I have orange caguamas on my spud, they are really hard compared to blue Caguamas, however, take my advice with a grain of salt as the spud is stiff, seems like the sidekick fiberglass sandwiched inside helps a lot too with vibrations. I will have to test the spud with the blue Caguamas and the Sudekucj with orange to have a final verdict.

Yes it does but there is more secrets in there as I routed mine out for the blink s2  bamboo top layer and something real soft foam or cork not sure tho and there is polyurethane rails in the deck where the truck mounting points are these all in combination make vibration even less. I love this board so much.. worth every penny ..my outlaw that is the original big brother 38.5 feels even smoother as it has lil bit more flex in the middle longer wheel base

The love you gave in we can see on the pictures of your building process.
Just the battery pack is a piece of art and everything else is so clean.

Alan's being nice; orange Caguamas are the worst of all worlds; the compound is best for freestyle which we don't do in esk8.

Lofty 90mm's are in fact, my favorite.

![fullsizeoutput_229c|375x500](upload://47OL73T0XPCeXZK60XWrXoHO7MX.jpeg) ![fullsizeoutput_229e|500x500](upload://rJTTzQWc67s1CXkI8jAzTqe6oI2.jpeg) 

Be advised that the inner edge on the Lofty is not radiused, and since it is so soft, it will likely find a piece of glass and tear under torque.  Worth it to me. :) 

Boosted Gen 1 wheels are the best wheel I've found for the Tayto.  Orangatang In-Heats also now come in 77a, too.

Could that inner edge be easily changed on a lathe? I have lots of lathe experience, though I know PU is tricky and I have no actual experience with it.

Second to that... if you knew exactly what you were doing, could you radius it with a sharp utility knife? Or would that cause micro-tearing lead to faster failure

Seismics are better longboarding wheels better than Orangatangs or Loftys, in my opinion.

LDP / commuters, like the excellent Pantheon series of decks or G-Bombs, I would go with SSV Mangos.

esk8 is totally different on wheels, in my opinion.  

Everything is extra in esk8; extra load, extra speed, extra stress on parts.

I would suggest bubblegum SSV 85s, which are the same duro as the blue Cags, are 'better' than blue Cags only because Orangatang blue wheels get so sticky that they bring home a lot of debris.

Blue cags attract a layer of grime that makes a 'skin' on that light blue thane; then they seem perfect, just fugly.

Bubblegum SSVs are normal and do not seem to pick up half as much grease or broken glass from the road, but then again, I've not had them on an esk8.

Hope this helps!

I eventually ordered some blue Caguamas since it is easier for me to print kegel pulleys whereas with the Venom wheels I would have to go with a CNCd option.
