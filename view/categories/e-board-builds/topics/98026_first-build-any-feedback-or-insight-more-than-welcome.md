Hello, I am newish to the electric skateboard scene and already own a Yuneec E-GO 2 but realized I definitely want something more and decided I might try to build my own. So I have done research and have come up with a board which I believe to be compatible and reliable. I am planning on using this for much of my commuting. Any feedback is greatly appreciated and if you know of any place I can get a similar part for less price that would be excellent. Thank you.

Board: ($150)

I will also be getting 1/4" risers as long as I stick with the board to prevent battery being literally on the ground. I am not in love with the overall cost of the board but do want it to be reliable with long range and good top speed. Once again any input is fantastic. Thanks

What’s your budget and goal for the build? There’s some just as good parts for better prices

Hey, thanks for the response, I am basically just trying to get the board as cheap as possible while still maintaining reliability. My main goal is to have more than 20 miles range and more than 20 mph top speed.

Gotcha. How about the budget and where are you located? Maybe I can try to point to some other vendors for different options

If I could keep the budget under $800 that'd be awesome, but that is not including the board because I do really like bustin boards. I am located in New York City though.

Is this a single or dual?

Here’s my recommendations:
- Motor Mounts from: Boardnamics, high quality parts at a killer price.
- Motor + Wheel Pulley: you can grab the set from TB/Build Kit Boards. or DickyHo (bit cheaper but from China)
- Remote: Flipsky VX1 if you like thumb remotes at that price. Relatively inexpensive
- VESC: The 4.12 (same one listed) is sold by Flipsky on eBay for $50. There are better ones out for a bit more. Ex. The FSESC dual 4.2+ has had glowing reviews. 


Just a heads up, the battery is quite thick.

It is a single, thank you for the alternate options to cut costs. Would you have any recommendations for a different battery supplier? I would like a thinner one I just like the set they are offering.

In that case grab a single focbox off one of the members on the forum. Try the new forum: esk8 news. I think I saw one or two the other day. There was a nice sale the other day for Flipsky. The 6.6 and 4.20s are solid too. Do some more reading and make a decision :smiley: 

There isn’t really a vendor that sells prebuilt flat packs. Usually they’re built by members of the forum. I’d suggest @Dirt_Bag who makes packs at a great price or @RedBaron who made mine. Then top it off with a nice psychotiller or eboosted enclosure. Hopefully that deck isn’t flexy... long packs and flexy decks don’t pair well.

I would love to build you a pack. I try and offer the cheapest price around. Link me a cheaper one and ill do my best to beat it.

Okay, thanks. Right now I’m looking at a couple of 12s4p li-ion 3000mAh 30Q that are around $300-$350
