Trampa mtb with superstar hubs, ultimate trucks and 8” wheels.

So I’m used to tightening bolts down on my truck based off torque specs via the vehicle manual. If I tighten the nuts down too tight on my board the wheel won’t spin, if I go too loose I’m worried that it’ll fall off during the ride. What I ended up doing was going tight, then slowly loosening until I felt the wheel was free spinning on its own.

I know this is kind of a trivial question but I think it’s important to address it. Anybody have advice?

Ideally, if you are using correctly sized spacers or bearings that have built in spacers, and the wheel hubs are sized properly, you should be able to tighten your nuts down all the way (extremely tight), and still have your wheels spin freely with little to 0 horizontal play between the hubs and bearings.

As this isn't always the case, I have found a good middle ground for me is to tighten your nuts all the way and back off just until the wheels spin freely as you mention you do.

My cheapo board has spacers between the bearings too.

I destroyed a bones ceramic bearing due to shitty evolve AT hubs not being very precise in measurement. 

I just threw a speed ring in with the spacer to fill the gap and all good!

@Taliesin 
Nuts used on skate trucks have a nyloc (nylon?) ring inside the nut, this locks the nut on, not the torque you tightened it with. After you take them on/off a bunch of times they no longer lock as well so replace them periodically if you are regularly taking the wheels on/off.

Past that tighten them as much as you can to eliminate any lateral play but still allows them to spin freely.

Standard skate bearing spacers are not the best so I get my spacers from here:

The thicker wall with 1/2" OD fits perfectly on the inner bearing race and they work very well.
I can lock my Abec11's down tight and they spin like crazy.

@namasaki do you know if the ones you linked will fit on the trampa ultimate truck axles? (Trampa Abec 5s and superstar hubs)

Thanks @Namasaki :+1:! Followed your advice. I just ordered two sets .405 for my builds from [Aluminum Spacers](http://www.aluminumspacers.com/spacers-by-hole-size/hole-for-5-16-inch-bolts/as50-16-405)

.405 works on Abec11 flywheels. 
To make sure, add speed washers to your spacer in between the bearings until you can tighten it down tight and still spin the wheel freely. 
Then take the spacer and washers out and measure them together with calipers and order the closest size available, rounding up.
For example, if you measure.400. 
Get .405 not .395
