How did you find the rails for a longer x axis on your x-carve?

I thought originally I would use my ecarve to cut decks, but I find it's hard because you need to adjust to the heights of the drop down for the decks I use. Kinda a bummer. But I do still like the idea...

i bought new maker rails and made the Y axis longer to fit my decks. Then i took some length off of the X axis that i no longer needed. The original kit was the 1000x1000 size. 

Then i reinforced the center of the Y axis with steel brackets after adding my own wasteboard.

Also i cut some embty space on the tail, so you may have to do that with your drop downs. that's a downside of not knowing how to use proper CAM software and instead working only in 2.5D

ha! that's a Phat Matson. @cmatson commisioned that shape in late 2015.  I only sold a couple of them, but i still have the template. I used the template to spray the floor. 

I suppose i could bring it back. Its a simple shape. 

Here's a customer's board that had it on there:

Have you done anything to strengthen the Z-axis? I bought their upgrade kit recently, and the new x-cotrol makes a huge difference, same with the new x-axis. I do the same on my y, which makes a huge difference, but the Z is still moving... I get 3mm of movement on cuts, which is just too much when I need accuracy.

and this fucking thing... That's @onloops first kit! 6S 10Ah dual drive system. i broke 27MPH on that board. The battery was held up in Hong Kong for 2 months because of bird smugglers. I suspect smuggling birds is how Jsson got his seed money.

and that time i went around looking like Snake Plisskin because i had bell's palsy and couldn't close my eye all the way due to not having any control of that side of my face whatsoever for weeks on end. The patch kept the bugs and wind out of my eye so i could concentrate on breaking my arm.

i sent this to @ChrisChaput along with a few similar shots. this is unfiltered raw and from my phone. i use a paper roll to turn my bench into a lightbox. Its not wide enough though so these boards often have to be shopped. White boards present a big problem obviously in PS and i end up having to airbrush manually to get the "product whiteout" that you always see online. If i'm going to keep doing these white based boards i need a black backdrop.

heavy wooden frame, two 6 ton jacks and a custom CNCed wooden mold. It's about as simple as it can get. And dead reliable.
