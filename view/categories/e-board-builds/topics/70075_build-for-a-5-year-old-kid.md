Well, since my kid is obsessed with my eskate and snowboard (we are riding together on my board every single day), I have come to idea to make one for him. He already can ride my bamboo GT by himself, but it is simply too long/wide and heavy for him, and with 13kg of his weight he does not have enough weight to make it turn, so basically he can only ride it in a straight line. Other issue is that it is way too powerful for his age.

So what I am looking for is a short, light deck with super soft trucks that he could steer with.

I have some 5065 collecting dust, so that would be the motor of choice for this build.

Is it possible to make a board with single motor, with 6s1p battery and limited motor current to limit top speed at somewhere around 10km/s?

What are the softest trucks you have ridden?

This deck looks tempting:

I I recommend an Land Yachtz Dinghy.  My son loves having the kick tail, he is 5 too.

I put on the smaller calibers with the softest bushings I could find. Double cone up front, barrel/cone in the rear.

I did 6s3p with a Focbox. There is a giant 6374 on there now, but I will be changing it to a 6355.  Anything really.  They weigh nothing (5yos that is).

I made the battery myself and made the enclosure out of fiber glass.  And skinned the deck in some cool Star Wars fabric. 

22 motor max 
-18 motor min
25 batt max
-8 batt min.

These settings are great for him, and a Nano x remote fits his little hand nicely.

10km/s

:scream: 22,369mph. Why does he need to go that fast? That is above orbital speed. Your going to need a much larger motor for that. 

Maybe try one of these.

My guys board goes up to 18 mph (of course I have set the bushings and motor settings for myself sometimes üòÅ) but limit the the speed to about 13/14 via duty cycle.

I heart this post.  My 10 year old son just asked me to build him an ESK8 and we finally have all the parts we need.  I'm strongly considering starting a thread for his extreme budget build, and this post convinced me to do it :)

I would use a 10s1p instead of a 6s just for the fact that it will have a longer range and you can up the speed through the settings as he progresses and gets older

My kid is about to turn 16, we started skating together when he was 12, started building esk8s together when he was 13. 

He scares the shit out if me sometimes, but it so much fun building and tiding together.   Plus when he gets cocky, I lower his duty cycle via Bluetooth so he can't keep up üòÄ.

One option is to get a regular double kick skateboard deck and mount some longboard trucks (calliber2) on the kicks. This gives them a steeper steering angle to make it easier to turn for a lightweight. Double kick decks are super cheap. The only downside is low ground clearance for batteries and you loose the kicks.

Thats a good point, actually I have Bamboo GT battery that I dont use anymore, it's 10s1p if I am not wrong.

Maybe I could use that one. The only thing i need to check is the size...

It is a Landyatchz Dinghy that I skinned with Star Wars fabric and epoxy

@Blacksheep it is 28.5" IIRC

This is great! I'm working on a [build for my 9 y/o son](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-cheap-1st-build-for-and-with-my-9-yo-son/68675).
There is a cheap (~20$) maple board from aliexpress down there somewhere in the thread that some people said looks ok.

@Sender and others: one question I can't get an answer to, is what is a reasonable "Avg. Energy Use" - set as default to 18W-hr per mile in [this calculation](http://calc.esk8.today/config/?type=3.7&scells=6&pcells=1&cc=2.25&da=65&mda=65&kv=170&poles=14&eff=90&wheel=80&mp=15&wp=36&wpm=18). I assume I can lower it significantly for a small 30kg rider, but I'm not sure how much.

I wouldn't worry much about range on a kids board. Anything really.  I went 6s3p on his and could have done 6s2p or 10s1p TBH.  He rides it for days before needing a charge.
```

## \#23 Posted by: Sender Posted at: 2018-10-04T15:39:44.346Z Reads: 101

```
Also the reason I went 6s is solely because i had a 5065 220kv motor Inwas planning to use, then realized my mount was only for 63mm motors (it was early on in my building career) and the kv on 10s would have been too high.

It worked out though because 190kv on 6s gives a nice little 18mph top end which is perfect for him to grow into.

Doing a 10s battery would be fine, but as most readily available motors are 170-200 kv, that is a bit fast for what I wanted him to be able to do anyway.  Of course ypu could lower it with Vesc settings, but still.

I do need to grab one of those $75 vescs from flipsky in there as the Focbox in there now is way overkill.  And I want it for other shit, like always.  Same for the 6374 motor.  6355 for his little ass is more than enough.

I will swap out that cheaper vesc and put in a 190kv 6355 and do some single build with the reclaimed Focbox and 6374 most likely.

It is very easy to reduce speed/torque by configuring the VESC.  I agree with the 10s sentiment, overbuild the board because the little ones grow quickly, both in skill and weight.  You can always limit the erpm and motor current in software to cut down on speed and torque for safety.

Also, you might consider LiFePo cells for safety reasons, perhaps the same A123 ANR26650M1B cells that Boosted uses.

My son is 1 year old and I've build him like 3 boards already, but I ended up using them because he just learned to walk

I need something light, short, without idelers and all that stuff. 

Thanks.

TB are great but a bit steep with price 66$ plus shipping to Europe. 

@dickyho are great but I think too long for this short deck to be mounted under not reversed. 

BKB are for 63mm motors not 50mm. I was thrilled for a moment and then @moon broke my happiness pointing out that it won't fit 50mm

So the search continues.

Well I am not 100% sure but they are suitable for motors with 44mm mounting space

So unless if you want to modify mounting points it probs wont work
