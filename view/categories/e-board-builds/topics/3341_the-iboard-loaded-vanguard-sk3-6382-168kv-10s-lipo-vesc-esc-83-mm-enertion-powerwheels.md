That vanguard is the 42inch right? Flex 2 doesn't come in the shorter board

Correct, however I'm not sure if I'm going for flex 2 yet. Will the 42" get too long?

Hey @fraannk, I have the 42" vanguard and it is a good length for me (but I am 6'5").

I posted my vanguard build on here a while back. Mounting enclosures is definitely more difficult on a flexy board but it can be done.

@RunPlayBack and I are working on some enclosures for the vanguard that I plan to mount using adjustable clevis pins. I am excited to see how your 3D printed housing turns out. Do you have a design in mind yet?

Sounds good! I have moved away from using 3D printed parts on my boards. The constant vibration always seems to crack them.

Here is a preview of what @RunPlayBack and I are experimenting with for an enclosure. After we narrow it down a bit, I plan on putting one on the front and one on the back. It should be able to hold a lot of battery capacity.

We have separate spaces for stuff just like this on my university. Excellent equipment. 

Battery connectors and charging connectors done! 
VESC 12 AWG wire replaced with 10 AWG wire done! Now I just need new shrink tubing because the 45mm was not big enough.. 
Motor soldered to the VESC done! Motor detection worked like a charm.

From my experience, if you buy from enertion, the key is included.  If you buy from DIY, the key is not included unless you ask.

@PB1  That's awesome.  It's like a flatspot keyway hybrid.

I then wanted to take it out and it cut in half.... How am I supposed to get it out? Besides that, trying to pull this satan out, everything is now scratched and looks like crap :(

today I set up my sk3 6374 for my vanguard build and instead of a keyway, I just drilled 2 small dimples where the grub screws are located in the pulley. the pulley snaps right into the correct place and it feels pretty solid (2 grub screws in 180° layout). maybe try that next time, seems less invasive and a key isnt REALLY needed - was running my trampa also without one.

just a fairly good metal drill. I was using the drill press of my granddad and it took me a while to figure out the trick: if you go super slow and careful, the drill will dance around the point where you want your dimple - what youll have to do instead is aim well with the press, and then lower the drill fairly quickly and with some force - youll get the initial scratch that keeps the drill in one place. :relaxed:

a punch can really help with this.  All you need is a small divot to start - also starting with a smaller drill bit then going larger might help.

try one of these first next time and it should help:

Got it all sorted out! Belt drive now works perfectly. Took the board out for a spin, and it worked great! - for a while at least. I rode the board for about 5 minutes, not even hard because I'm still new to long boarding, and boom, DRV8302 error. It just silently cut off while cruising. Took it home and hooked it up to BLDC tool, and it says DRV8302 error :sob: Why did this happen? I set everything up with care.. And I haven't touched FOC.. @elkick I shot you an e-mail as well, and I hope you can help. :)

Sorry to hear that! I'm load testing all the VESCs before sending them out, so it also might be a configuration issue. DRV fault doesn't mean that the DRV is blown automatically, but of course it can be an indication. 

Can you please post a picture of the motor config, the BLDC tab and the VESC (if possible) please? Also, what BLDC Tool version are you using, where did you download it and when? I'm asking this because there have been faulty versions of the BLDC tool 2.17 and 2.18 around for a few days which can cause troubles as well.

Wasn't this myth busted by Jacob? He said he does not experience any issues and it looks like only people that don't even know what VESC version they are using are having trouble - so it's most probably user related.

No, the first versions uploaded around 25th May were containing bugs which were causing different problems. There als were some customers from @chaka who had issues and failing VESCs based on this! 

@fraannk, those values seem to be realistic and the VESC is not showing damages (those marks at the FETs are normal due to the shrinking of the tube, so no problem). Can you please check all the soldering connections again, they might have come loose due to vibrations. You can remove the shrink wrap for this, no problem. Also please check all the cables going to the battery and to the motor. If possible test with another motor too (just doing the motor detection). It also could be a motor related issue, shorting cables or so. 

In any case, we will solve this - I want to see you riding on your board! :slight_smile:

Your settings might have caused your DRV to fail. Your motor current max and min should be 80A and -80A (as per SK3 6374 data) and your max ERPM should be limited to max 70 000.

The VESC draws a curve with the motor max-min, and limits the output with the batt max. It is very important that the VESC has as much good information about the motor as possible, including motor detection. Bad setting can result in a voltage spike that can be fatal to the DRV

Limiting the amps to the motor, would that not just make it even safer? And just sacrifice performance?

no, this is not limiting the amps, the BATT max limits the amps. the vesc uses the motor max-min to draw a current throttle curve, it stays within this curve with batt max-min. if these values are off, this is when damage can occur.

@Blasto does these two ERPM limit settings actually do anything in this config? aren't they basically set to infinit as I understand it, my 190kv motor is doing a max of around 7000 rpm on 10S. Still trying to figure out all these VESC settings.

```
I believe you should multiply your RPM with your motor "T" number/2. Like my motor is a 168kv 16T motor, so with 10s my max RPM would be 42V · 168kv = 7.056 RPM, and then to get ERPM: 7056 · 16/2 = 56.448 ERPM. You set it to 70.000 ERPM because I read that is the max the VESC will operate 100% stable at. I'm not entirely sure though, this is also very new to me. :)

A small update:
New day, still DRV8302 error. (Thought i might have to cool down or something) 
A new, better picture of the VESC itself:

Looks ok, you could try it with the small outrunner motor to check if it's the VESC or maybe the other motor. And please apply "read default config" to reset the values completely before doing the motor detection. Also, when switching back reading the default config values is always a good idea prior to detection and configuration.

Okay, tried with new motor, still the same error. I'm not **entirely** sure this little motor is 100% functional since it it a long time since I last used it, but it really should be working. I don't have any others to test with, but I don't think both my motors are broken at least. So I believe it is the VESC that is the problem unfortunately. :sob:

DRV8302 errors are not uncommon and not always due to rider misuse.  They fail.  I know Ben has changed some layout and other things to help with some voltage surging (which does a great job frying DRV - i know i did it twice).  I found a sure fire way of killing mine while bench testing - hard start/stops a few times too many and too quickly.  (don't do that)

Regardless of what lead up to it - you almost certainly need to replace the DRV chip.  About $5-6 for the chip, and a hot air setup to remove/replace.  I had help doing mine and it took about 10-15min ea with me asking dumb questions along the way (slowing it down).  Realistically it probably could take about 5 min if you know what you are doing.

HTH -GL!

Fantastic news! @elkick sent me a new VESC, and this one seems to work perfectly! I rode it around the city, and DAMN the speed of this thing! Holy moly it goes fast. I got up to 35km/h and chickened out. I really dare giving it full throttle... I can feel that there's a lot of power left when already running at high speeds. 

This is the temporary setup so far! Enclosures are on the way, and I can't wait to complete it!

A small update on the app I'm controlling the board with. Design still not finalized, but I think I know which direction to go design wise. The app now shows real time speed, and this is a screenshot I took while riding:

P.S. Personal record is now 41 km/h. Damn this thing goes fast

EDIT: 
Another small update:
Took a trip through city, 11,73 km.
Went home and charged the batteries, to discover that I'd only use 3900 mAh out of the 5000 :D 
If I push the usage to 4700 mAh, that gives me a range of approx. 14km. DAMN!

14KM with a 10S 5Ah setup is not much though. I get the same with just 6S 5Ah.
You have 3.7*10*5=185Wh while I have only 111Wh. Either your drivetrain is very ineffcient (belt too tight for example), your route is tough on the batteries (a lot of hills?) or you are just riding it with lots of braking and accelerating.

On that route, I had a couple of full stops where I took a little break (without pausing runkeeper.) Otherwise it was almost at max speed or hills. Lots of stop and gos as well, since the roads aren't very long here. 14km is more than enough for me, as I only need 12km on flat roads at most. :) 

@nordle No, the app shows no remaining capacity. I plan on making a distance tracker so that I'm able to approximately see how much juice I have left.

## Update!
Holy smokes I love this board. I've ridden it a lot, and I just can't stop. It is true what people say about it being addicting...

**Unfortunately though,** the Arduino controlling the VESC, crashed while I was riding at top speed. (41 km/h) This means that it kept sending a signal to the VESC about giving max throttle. I had no way of braking the board as it just kept going. "I thought to my self, WTF" and had to find some way to not crash on asphalt as it would have been really bad... I found a grass area, steered the board towards that, and tried to stay as long as possible on the board since it would slow down on grass. I wasn't able to stand on the board for very long, and fell off, and landed on my shoulder pretty hard. This led to a broken collar bone, and minor scratches here and there. Luckily I had a helmet on. I had to get surgery to fit the bone where it should be, and I'm now equipped with titanium reinforcement on the collar bone :sunglasses: 2 weeks of only being able to use one arm because of a collar'n'cuff, and 6 weeks before I'm able to lift 1 liter of milk again :laughing: And as ironic as it is, I was on the way to the workshop to make a kill-switch in case this would happen........

**On another note:** I'm soon able to ride the board again, and to prevent this from happening, I've ordered a 2.4GHz remote, and abandoning my app. To read speeds, I will however be creating an Apple Watch app speedometer! 

I also got enclosures to the board from the fantastic @Dunkirk, and I'm currently in the process of mounting them to the board. (Might take a little long because of one hand.)

It was not a bluetooth dropout. I never had those, even in crowded areas. My connection was very solid, it was just the Arduino or the program running on the Arduino that crashed. The code was a little too complicated with too many features for the processor to keep up. I did too many requests from the BT board as well. I guess I could just re-code it, but I would not know if it could happen again. Therefore I ordered a 2.4GHz remote. :)

Baddabing!!! Enclosure mounted. Looks nice and compact. :D 

Next up: Figuring out where to place button as well as charging connectors

really great enclosure, its crazy close to the motor though, are you sure its not touching when you fully lean into the truck? :open_mouth:

I measured that on beforehand. The pictures make it look closer than it really is. There's plenty of space even when fully turning :)

## This project has been completed!! (For now at least) 
Switch mounted, everything fitted in to the enclosure. There's not even space for a straw of hair left in that box. Overall I'm very happy with how it turned out! Also, this new remote is great, and hopefully it won't send my flying :P The reason I'm writing "for now" is that eventually I'll probably do a smart charging solution. But right now I just charge the batteries individually. Thanks for following along :D More pics:

How did you make that enclouser box?
Has that controller cruise control?

Thanks :D The enclosure was made by @Dunkirk, and he used 3mm ABS sheets, and vacuum around a base to form them. The controller does not have cruise control, but I do not see the need for this as the throttle slider is very soft and comfortable to hold. :)

Hi @fraannk  awesome build. It freak out me when i read the post that u had an accident then a operation then titanium reenforce in ur colar. Wow 

Quick question? How can u place the battery box under without any holes ?

There's holes, but they're not all the way through. I used wood inserts like this: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c32c0d193b2f8ec358509f5e071b2ffab659eb39.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I like your attitude talking about "the situation" with emojis and calmness! Get completely well soon.
Interestingly, though, I'm now planning the board I'll be doing in a couple of months and I REALLY want to make my own remote and board-controller with all the original features based on arduinos. And that kind of risk was the first thing to pop in my head, now that it's proven real, I have to be really confident in my design and software if I still want to be custom about it.

It's going through the hole, but the hole itself isn't going through the whole thickness of the board.

Great build, reminds me of my own (still in work). 2x5S 5000 / 190 6355 / VESC / 14-36

I guess the scratches on your batterys are from the first testride with the batterys on top of the griptape? :slight_smile: Mine look exactly the same.

## Board Update!! (Almost 6 months anniversary ;)) 

**I LOVE IT!** MAN do I use this board a lot, and MAN is it fast. I've done some modifications along the way, which I thought I would post here. :) 

First of all, I've ridden it so much that my Enertion Powerwheels wore down. (especially the wheel with the pulley)
That's where the first modification comes in. I painted my trucks black and mounted Orangatang Kegels instead. Got my new 34T wheel pulley from @elkick and it works (and looks) fantastic. I opted for the 34T pulley to compensate for the smaller wheels, which makes this board now top out at 42km/h (previously 41km/h)

Second, I've mounted head- and taillights! Since it is getting dark pretty quickly, I want others to see me when riding in the evening/nights. They are pretty bright.

For those interested, [these are the LED modules I used. ](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/2812-1-bit-full-color-5050-rgb-led-module.html) Four in the front, four in the back. I soldered them together on a small PCB and wrapped them in shrink-tubing:

Last but not least. I 3D printed the wall-hangers by @FLATLINEcustoms and added a hanger for the controller on one of them. Now everyone who enters my apartment will see the "Boosted Board killer".

Next up is a BMS for easy charging. Starting to get pretty tired of taking it apart every time.. 
Thanks for reading! :D

I was just reading through and had some questions about the wood inserts. What size did you use? How much space is between the inserts and the top of the of the board? Have they loosened at all due to the board flexing? And finally, do you have any idea of where to buy these or something similar in Nyc?
Thanks!

@zepton I'd get a Flex 3. I think it fits most people. I weigh 70kg (155 pounds) and I use a Flex 3 and it's great. 

@WawiKirsinger Sorry for the late reply! I rebuilt my board: [The Frankenboard](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-frankenboard-loaded-vanguard-dual-6355-dual-vesc-8s-10000mah-orangatang-kegels/20510) and found a way to charge without a BMS!
