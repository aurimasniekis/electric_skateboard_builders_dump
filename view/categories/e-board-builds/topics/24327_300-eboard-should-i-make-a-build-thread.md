I have finally completed my first eboard. I've been riding around and testing for the last couple of days. I will take it for a proper test tomorrow and ride for a few kilometres. The total price of the board comes to around $300 AUD. Would there be any intrest in me starting a build thread with all the parts listed? 

Thanks to everyone on here and all the help you guys have given me

So 300$ including the board itself? That's extremely cheap!

This is a build I did for a guy at work five or so months ago. Marine150a ESC 2500kva  inrunner gear drive, 8:1 ratio on 70 mm wheel, 4s. Under 300.00 usd. Still going strong. 26 mph and just did 7 mile santa Clarita run and kept up fine with his 200 lb of man on it. He decided to upgrade ESC to 200a 1/5 trackstar for better brakes after the Clarita run. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/63f0353b0bf27c2e57ec51dd8a4e0648bc397936.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/2/428614af0d3c433f78373e4c3b71558cfe2dd2a7.jpg" width="690" height="388">

[/quote]

Surely he meant 250 KV

2500kv at 4s would be 42,000 rpm

We were trying for bare bones cheap cheap cheap.      Goolrc 2650kv 1/8 inrunner $28.00 (the 2000kv is a better fit).   flycolor 150a esc waterproof 38.00 (very hearty esc 10ga wire and does not overheat, no brakes) gt2b radio $27.00.   multistar 4s 10000mah $65.00 b6ac charger. $15.50 hot racing pinion 5mm 9t 32p $10.00 Robinson racing spur 72t 32p $15.50   used longboard 50.00. hand fabricated motor mount misc hardware $35.00.  Total $284.00   setup still working well and yes the gear drive works, use 70mm wheels.  I highly recommend getting an ESC with brakes.

I test drove a board 2 days ago with 
dual Carvon V2s, 6s and a pair of FVT ESC's and I was amazed at how smooth and linear the brakes where!

So for everyone asking for me to post a build thread, I will next week sometime. At the moment I'm waiting for a new esc because the one I was using blew up the other day (it was a $12 40 amp heli esc for testing). I am ordering a 120amp X car beast esc tonight. Can't wait to get riding again soon. The build is now around $350 AUD or $260 USD which is still cheap as chips

I'm riding the x-car beast 150 on a 6s system without any problems. The only reason I would like to have another ESC it vesc is that it is quiet big. Instead of 2.5 cm my housing needs to to have a height of around 5 cm. Other than this I have no complaints.

Ok thanks. It's nice to know that they are good for eboards. That's the same problem I have, as the enclosure must be quite tall. I think I will just cut a hole in the top of the enclosure though so that it will also get good air flow to the esc. The other thing is I might be able to take the esc out of its original case and put it in a smaller slimmer one.


Thanks and I'll let you know how it goes

Broke down the spur gear on a build thread. "Spur gear approach"
