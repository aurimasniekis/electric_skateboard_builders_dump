For my second build, inspired by Skatemetric, I'm going to be making a Foosted Board. The reason for this "Dual+" part is for it's upgrades in the VESC, battery, remote (@solidgeek). I made a doc and if you guys could talk about things I could improve pls say something.

I'm building my Firefly remote right now, but need to shorten my wires as I made them **way to long.** Any suggestions or ways to cut down the cost, im right here!

Just a quick one, on your form it says you are buying two unities. You'll only need the one for your build.

Also don't buy anything, even small parts from Mboards. He's a clown and his business is a joke. He'll make you wait months for those little parts. Might as well just get them from a reputable seller.

Not sure if your spreadsheet is a work in progress but your amounts don't add up :smiley: Put some sums on that badboy.

=sum(D3:D22,G3:G22) for your total

=SUM(C3*B3) on your motor totals and drag it down to replicate the formula
