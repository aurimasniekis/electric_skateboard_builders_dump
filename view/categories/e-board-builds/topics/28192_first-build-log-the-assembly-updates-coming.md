**My first build**
More than one year in the making because of school and lack of motivation during the winter(stupid).

Finally i recieved all of my parts and can know start the assembling process. (Almost)
First some info of my build.
Motor: [SK3 - 6374-192kv](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us)
Batteries: [4x 5000mAh 3S](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-3s-20c-lipo-pack.html)
Vesc: [Proto-boards.com](http://www.proto-boards.com) (turned out that this was a maytech vesc) 
BMS: [12s](http://bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html) (Help needed with wiring)
Pulleys: 15/36
Wheels: 70mm

Unfortunately i've had some problem with my motor mount from ebay wich did not fit the motor as stated in the describtion.
I've startede to mod the motor mount and this should work. Not quite done yet. And some modifications to my truck.

**Remote**
I've made the remote my self from a wii nunchuck and put in a transmitter battery a chip to put on some code so it is possible to use.

The last picture is the recieving part and is going to be place on the board and connected to the vesc.

The batteries was quite simple just wiring 2 in series to make a 6s and with at harness or what people call them put the 2x 6s in series to a 12s

**BMS**
The bms was ordered from bestech with lovely dude from the forum since you need a order of two.

My only question is how i know wich is wich on the battery <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/2/72d5a0d75ff9930ddb71d8abd64f751bd0e97a57.jpg" width="690" height="271">

What im understandning is that is start from the negative side of the battery does is mean i use the red wire aswell as one of the cells?

**Is this right?**

More pictures will be posted as progress is made :slight_smile:

Okay ive done some research and think this is rigth can anyone confirm?

**BMS Update**
I have now soddered all my balance connectors to the connectors i recieved with my bms. The black lead on the balance connectors i folded and put some heat shrink tube on so that they are still there if needed later. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/3/5331a2981a9b412ea1a17b51db83cbd348f5e988.png" width="375" height="500">

And my soddering should be correct if i follow with a volt meter i can see that the first pin is 1 cell and so on. 

**Update**

Was putting everything together for at test and vesc setup. Turns out the vesc uses a larger bullet connector than the motor. Back to the soddering.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/5/353f525c151d629a63968a8e8847357af18a372e.png" width="231" height="25">

Should i update the firmware or stay with 2.18?

**Today's Update**
I managed to drill some new holes in the motor mount. I think it should be fine with only 3 screws. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/8/d851a0fb5969f849933c44daadd4e7ebc7d2748d.png" width="375" height="500">

Could have had the last screw if my precision was better. But this should do the job. 

Unfortunatly my remote got some problems.. Im getting a flickering signal which means that the motor spins sometimes without me pushing the trigger..
And i saw that i need some screws and bolts to put the wheel and drive wheel together...

**Update**
Managede to get my signal more stable but somethings wrong in the kode i put on there.. 
Stil not any further with the drivewheel

Yeah, my motor couldn't spin as well, I just used that default motor mount for airplanes that comes with the turnigy motor to create small space and that was enough. Still waiting for some parts tho. Good luck with your build

**This update is coming in the comment dont really know why.**
Finally i wrote some new code and got the controller to work properly. Put on an antenna on the transmitting end too which made the signal stable. Wrote some new code to make it do what i wanted. The code i had before is if i wanted to do is without all the options that the vesc got. Safety button is working and even my cruise control too. So im happy. Heading for some m3/m4 bolts and knots tomorrow and ordered a new belt.

When i went for some m3/m4 bolts the only ones i found was far too short. So i ended up getting some m4 rods and knots to make it work. The pulley isnt the best spinning one but it's working. Went for a test buuuuut the belt is not tight at all soo waiting for the new one...

Sooooo.....
I got the new belts... bought both 265mm and 270mm
Buuut it turns out i probaly should have bought a 275mm or maybe 280mm. It was really hard to get on even when i loosend the motor first. I managed to get it on. But offcourse theres more problems with my remote. Thinking about buying one now.. 
I'll come with an update when i have tested the system and finished and so on.

Also these mounts come loose after a few miles, so they need to be epoxied in place once you are happy with the placement. Its the only way to stop them from keep coming loose.

Hi, @darkkevind. 
No unfortunatly i dont have one, would have been a lot easier. I used a normal file. I just kept testing and turning. Even some sandpaper is nice to make it a little rounder. 
It takes quite some time but it turned out great.

I have a suggestion for the mount. I have a very similar mount from eBay and I had the same problem so what I did is drill 3 holes into the truck then I bought some m6 bolts and put them so they lined up with the holes in the truck and loctited them in place

@darkkevind thanks. Probably easier and quicker with a lathe .

@pat.speed It seems like a good idea. But im allready afraid of making the truck leds sturdy from filing.

I've got some baaaad news!..
I hooked up a small Battery Capacity tester and everything worked fine. When i sat there impressed by my work and how i was able to see the battery percentage something happend and smoke and a little fire accured from my BMS...
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/6/268f22d4d917070665f5cfaf5aa520de75b6b489.png" width="375" height="500">
That's the aftermatch of the burn. The only damage that i'm able to find is that the E-Swtich dont have any use anymore. It's all ways on. And my Battery Capacity tester, but that's pretty cheap so i dont really care about that one. Hard to say if anything else is damaged when i haven't connected the charging port yet. But luckily im in contact with Bestech and i'm going to find out what's next. 

So be careful folks. It's alot of volts we are dealing with here. And matter of seconds things can change. Luckily im fine and so is my table.

No update for quite awhile now. Sorry about that. 
The person at bestech finally understood what i ment when i bought it together with anouter guy(one each). So maybe someday something is going to happen with that one. 

But the failure hasnt stopped med yet. I've just worked alittle with just making my own DIY antispark plug(worked first time without a spark not anymore tho) and my remote is fucked up. So im going to investigate into making a 2.4Ghz remote.
And probaly either drilling some new holes in the motor mount or making a new one myself.

Hallo @Migro

I have problems with my bestech BMS as well. Can you look at something on yours for me ? On the backside off the bms, it says "SW" and "Fuse" Is your two E-switch wires, soldered to SW or FUSE on the pcb ?? Thanks..
```

Hi @Silverline
It looks like it is soldered to SW. 
Have you tried emailing them?

Thanks. 
My E switch was soldered to "fuse" and the thermostat to SW. I tried to switch them round, but my BMS will still not turn on. Thanks for you help.

Okay i know i havent been updating recently, but thats because im waiting on shipment. I found that my homemade controller sucks. It is too unstable so sometimes it would just accelerate or dont even respond at all. And it's hard to figure out what is happening with my bms. I know i could finish without and maybe i will but for now i got the time to wait bad wether and waiting for the remote. 

And on the same time im looking in to 3d printing a mount i've made my idea in fusion 360 but i dont know how solid a 3d printed mount would be, it is mostly for the right size at the moment. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/f/ef5e2d852d32875fbb21f9cf38e1164f38849b8c.jpg" width="690" height="361">

The black part is the mount with groves so it is possible to slide the motor nothing really new to this mount but just a challenge to my self aswell. but i may have this printed just for a test fit this week or next.

Okay finally managed to 3d the mount. The cover is being printed at the moment. I have not had the time to test if the size is right yet but will do as soon as i get home. Im using my schools 3d printer because i have not bought one myself yet.

Unfortunatly yellow was allready in the printer so nothing to do there. But it's only to make a test fist so probaly okay. Heres some pictures of the other print in the making.

```
That design won't survive more than a couple of metres on a rough asphalt terrain with diletations. Especially in the part from motor mount to truck mount where it rises at 90 degrees upward. It will break right through.
It would be better to design it in two parts or two reinforce it with some screws which should improve the rigidity. 

Also use CF reinforced filament (PETG etc) it's the most suitable atm.

Yea your right. The print is mostly just to test and see if i made the diamensions and all the holes right. Later im going to see if it is possible for me to cnc or i need to figure out if it is possible to put some metel struts inside the mount. I have seen other people do so but i dont know how well it turned out

As promised the update..
The motor mount was a all good but the cover was not.. I've made some very f**ked measurements. So the cover is not wide enough and interfering with the small gear (the width) and the ends is interfering with the belt as us can see in my two pictures.

So i had the time to make the improvements that hopefully should do the job.

I still need a way to put in some support struts or something and a way to mount the 3d printed mount to the truck.

**EDIT**
Theres actually made some holes for bolts as mentioned above and a little edge in the inner cirkel on the right part(motormount)

GREAT NEWS!!!
After i bought some new transmitter/reciever modules and thinking of making my own. I ended up still buying the gt2b mini or whatever it is called. I recieved the modules yesterday. And did not have that much time playing with em but winter is coming. Lot's of time probaly not riding.
BUT today finaly. First ride. I've been waiting for this for so long. The first ride was so amazing. Pretty much drained the battery. But my batterty indicator says 0% which i dont understand but it's on 34.6V so pretty much drained. If i remember last time i checked the batttery indicator it was on 50 or something percentage. But i could be wrong. 
The other thing i need to get improved is still my drive train and probaly buy a waterproof case or make something. Im using the top of and ipad box and lots of tape when testing. 

Still waiting for the new BMS aswell so i can charge again and get some of the sunny hours.

**FINALLY!!!**
The time has come and i have recieved my new BMS. It is charging as im writing this. 
Unfortunatly it is almost 8pm where i am but i may go for a little spin when finished charging. I got a few pictures just of the bms charging. Nothing much. But it is exciting for me. Last piece to the puzzle is the box.
