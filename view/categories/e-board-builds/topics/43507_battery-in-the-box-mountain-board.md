fix as in install/place?
Id suggest getting some foam and pad the sides and top/bottom. Cut a small hole for the wires.

In all honesty, you may need to re-build your battery to make it fit well inside of whatever enclosure you buy.

I would add foam so that its wedged in with some pressure on all sides. Additionally you can use 3M foam tape if you want it permanently fixed.
