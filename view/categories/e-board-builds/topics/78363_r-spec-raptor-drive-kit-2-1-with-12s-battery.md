Hi ! i am building my second build, i choose to go with some heavy duty stuff for this build, i want to use 
-12S4P samsung 30Q Battery from (with the enclosure)
-focbox Unity from enertion
-R spec drive kit 2.1 
i can't find someone who done this build or something similar, do  you think its safe to run 12S Battery on those motor? what spec should i get ??

thanks you !

Yes it is safe to run the raptor hubs on 12s. By spec do you mean battery size or something else? No one has made boards with this set up because they just came out and no one has them yet, I think they are shipping this week.

well congrats on getting some dope hardware that young, haha

prepare to be broke if you continue this hobby :joy:

It sounds silly but I would encourage someone to build a 'crappy' board as their first, and ride it for a month or two, figure out what you do and dont like, and then start fresh on a second board. Its what I did, and when I brought it to where I work, people thought that I had purchased a board from someone on the forums, it was a total transformation from my first. 

Unless you have both a right and left hand.... I was gifted with two left hands(metaphorically, of course)... so building isnt my stong suit


yeah sorry epss4, ill buzz off now :P

Raptor 2 set up on a spud will be a bit much unless you run lower settings. Don't underestimate the drive it has more than double the torque of the meepo clones.

The R2 settings are 80 motor amps per motor and 30a battery amps

The battery can output 40 battery amps per focbox but the R2 antispark can't handle it, I went through 3 or 4 antisparks.

30q are 15a cells (more towards 20a) 15x4=60A

Motor and battery amps are different. 

The 30q can out put 20a safely and alot of us do it so 10s4p could out out 80a total battery amps that's 40 per focbox.

Motor amps don't have to do with battery capacity.

Never blew the 70a fuse, always floated the fets

You see 70a fuse is rated for 70a constant so it can handle short burst of higher amps. The fuse was never the problem lol

## \#53 Posted by: FredrikHems Posted at: 2018-12-19T15:35:48.235Z Reads: 148

In theory you could pull unlimited amps, you just need to keep the temperatur down.. Heat is really the only thing that limits the current output.
```

---
## \#54 Posted by: Battosaii Posted at: 2018-12-19T15:36:15.586Z Reads: 146

```
Speed is determined by battery voltage, motor kv and wheel size, amps don't affect speed unless you don't have enough to push through wind resistance. 

More amps is more torque basicly. Motor amps are low end torque and battery amps is high end torque.

Actually not true because I believe that hardware has it's limits like if you push 1000a though you might instantly blow some components no matter the temp
```

## \#57 Posted by: AlanZhou Posted at: 2018-12-19T16:04:13.566Z Reads: 140

And also 22a should be enough for any motor to reach max speed anything more than that is just extra acceleration
```

---
## \#58 Posted by: FredrikHems Posted at: 2018-12-19T16:42:01.970Z Reads: 142

```
No. Heat is the only factor that limits amps. Its not like voltage, where there is a hard limit of 60V for example. 
At 1000amps you would blow the esc in a matter of milliseconds. Again, due to heat.
```

---
## \#59 Posted by: AlanZhou Posted at: 2018-12-19T16:52:52.822Z Reads: 142

Excatally and there would be no heatsink large enough meaning that it's a hardware limit, the esc would blow so fast the fets to not even heat up much
```

---
## \#60 Posted by: FredrikHems Posted at: 2018-12-19T18:48:34.679Z Reads: 136

```
Again, its not a hard limit, but a heat problem. The fets wouldnt just blow by themselves even if the current is 1000 amps. They would blow due to extreme heating, therefore not a hardware limit, but a heat problem.
```

---
## \#61 Posted by: AlanZhou Posted at: 2018-12-20T03:07:48.429Z Reads: 127

and yet if you get some bigger fets (not only fets) it would solve the problem see its a hardware issue not a software

the fets would again heat up so fast and blow it would not even be hot if you touch it.

## \#62 Posted by: FredrikHems Posted at: 2018-12-20T10:38:52.652Z Reads: 114

Never stated it was a software limit. I said its a soft limit, which means that its only limited by heat. If you where to cool it enought (submerge it in liquid nitrogen as an example) you could run extreme amounts of amps. 60V however is an hardware limit, as there is no way to come around that problem.

for sure @Esk88  no problem , but just feeling the r spec kit in my hand and testing it quickly with the unity , MAN i can tell you this kit is the way to go if you  want to be safe and go fast 
. Really amazing build quality , i never seen that quality in electric skateboard that for sure !
That being said , they cost a lot !Way more than hummies i think !
 but with  the bundle with the unity at 200$ , i think its totally worth it ,
 like someone once said,
 it better to pay more than less, if you pay too much you will  loose a little bit of money , no big deal 
but if you pay less and you are not happy with your kit , well you loose all your money....
i will make review with 10s5p battery and after that review with 12s4p ! just need to wait because ther eis a lot of snow here, in montreal!

Not 100% sure but it should be the same or less heat on 12S if you're running the same Amps. I assume you're talking about the drive kit and not the battery/esc.
