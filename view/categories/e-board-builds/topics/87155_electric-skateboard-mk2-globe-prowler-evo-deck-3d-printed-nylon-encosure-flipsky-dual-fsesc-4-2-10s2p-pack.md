Hello thanks for having a look at my build thread! This is my second attempt at an electric skateboard build this time with dual motors and a vesc. My motors and truck kit was from DIYEboard (I'm aware there's been some more discussion about this recently but it's what I've got for now). The board is holding up well so far and rides quite nice. Here's my parts list and some photos, any comments or feedback would be appreciated :)

My enclosure was sls 3d printed in nylon and mounted to the deck using m4 threaded inserts. 

Heres a short video of my build with some testing at the end
