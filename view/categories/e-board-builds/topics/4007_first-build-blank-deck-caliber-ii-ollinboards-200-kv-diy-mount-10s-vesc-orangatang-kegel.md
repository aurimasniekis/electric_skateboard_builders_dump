Wanted some advice from more experienced builders before I order parts for my first board. 

Deck: 36" blank bamboo drop through 
Trucks: caliber ii
Wheels: orangatang kegel 80 mm
Bearings: bones reds
Motor: ollinboards 200kv 
Mount: DIY motor mount
Gears: DIY 16/36
ESC: DIY vesc
Transmitter: nyko nunchuck plugged into vesc
Battery: 2x 5s wired to 10s (https://www.commonsenserc.com/product_info.php?products_id=101)
Charger: need help here. Not sure I want to buy a 10s charger (too expensive)

Does this look like a solid build? Is an sk3 recommend over the ollinboards? Do those batteries look like a good choice (they are on sale and a very good deal)

do a 6s and charge in parallel- otherwise looks like a good build

@jespers101 could you pls rename your thread according to the instructions below?

[quote="onloop, post:22, topic:292, full:true"]
In order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds i am asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.

Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as "new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb" this becomes hard to keep track of.

I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC

ExampleThe Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks |  R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC

I have had nothing but trouble with the nyko Kama. Just get a tb mini remote and be done with it

I second the TB mini from @torqueboards, also I'd recommend the Imax b6ac v2 with a paralell charging board.
