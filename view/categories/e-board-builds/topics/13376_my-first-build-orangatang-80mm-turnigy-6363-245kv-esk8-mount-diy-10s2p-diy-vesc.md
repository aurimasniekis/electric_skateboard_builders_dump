Build your case! I like what you have going on so far, it's cool! but what are you going to use for a remote?

I was thinking about a carbon fiber custom case but first I want to get everything working ;)
Oh forgot about including that: [a RF nunchuk but not the Kama because it was sold out everywhere](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B002BPNY6O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

And what kind of charger should I use ? The BMS does the balancing according to the aliexpress listing so what charger is the cheapest? :D

245kv x 42v = 10290 rpm
10290 x 7= 72030 erpm 
The Vesc has an erpm limit of 60k
This motor/voltage combination could cause the Vesc's drv chip to fail.

o.O anyway around that?
IÂ´m pretty sure I saw a 245kv / 10S setup on here before

You'll have to limit the erpm in Vesc settings but there's a trick way to do it so that you don't get sudden shut down while accelerating. 
I don't know how to do it but someone on this forum has done it.

So the first upgrade would be a 190kv motor? :D

Yeah go for a 190kv with a 10s on vesc. People have done it with a 245kv, just not paired with a vesc

```
190kv + 10s + Vesc = performance and dependability
```

So this guy is using the same motor with 10S and apparently there seems to be not problem...
