Looking for an enclosure that'll fit a Bamboo GT deck nicely with space for a 10s4p 18650 pack with Focbox Unity (Don't think Evolve would sell me one and don't wanna rep their brand with this build anyway)

Absolute legend! Exactly what I wanted going to basically the edges of the deck too. Thank you!
