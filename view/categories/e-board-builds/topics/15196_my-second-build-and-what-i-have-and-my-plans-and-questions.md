```
this post is three parts-

1. List of stuff sitting at my house
2. List of stuff I think I will get 
3. **!And Questions I Have!**
You can skip to section 3 :slight_smile:
 
I already made one but I think I want to make another. On the last one I just switched for 12s to 6s if someone else wanted to try it. I have some stuff laying around my house from my last build and just brainstorming here and would be grateful for any experience you could add to help me from learning the hard way.

--------List of Stuff sitting at my house  -
[* VESC and all the cables to go with it ](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/) 
[* Programming Card](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-esc-programming-card/) Since the last one I made I didnt use the VESC
[* ABEC 97mm Flywheels](https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/products/abec-11-flywheels-97mm-75a) - These will be 20mm bigger than last build
[* Drop Deck Longboard](https://www.google.com/search?q=drop+deck+longboard&rlz=1C1AVNE_enUS649US649&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=638&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqjYX9mJDRAhXFjlQKHQgsDFAQ_AUIBygC) (99% sure this is not what I will use and will end up getting a different deck since nothing fits under there lol but I do need to find a deck that is stable at high speeds since my last one could go pretty fast and this one will probably go faster considering the larger motor/gearing ratio/wheels)
[* Freeboard](https://www.youtube.com/user/FreebordMfg)  (seen some posts here with them put together but also 99% sure this will not be what I use... brainstorming)
[* I have 2 - 12s 5000mah 50c lipos](http://www.thunderpowerrc.com/Products/Elite-Series-55C)  or in reality 4 6s totaling 10000 or more mah - plenty of energy to get me from my commute home to work and back. but they are long and BIG! but not too big i think aprox. 2.5"x2.5"x12"  
[* HiTec x4 ac Plus](https://www.hobbytown.com/x4-ac-plus-fourchannel-ac-dc-multicharger-6s-6a-50w-x-4-by-hitec-hrc44167/p214203) - This may not be relevant but maybe for someone really new or something
[* .080 Kydex](https://www.amazon.com/Kydex-Plastic-Sheets-Black-080/dp/B00HFDNMN2/ref=sr_1_1?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1482701489&sr=1-1&keywords=12+x+12+kydex) for making an enclosure like  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KA2P95bOPY) ... I still cant find the _exact_ brass screws though ... the ones I have are cheaper looking thumb screws. and his are are 10-24 and mine are all 6-32 ... hopefully being one size smaller they will still work as well.

---------List of Things I think I may be getting for this one- 
[* Pulley kit](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/12mm-wide-pulley-drive-hub-kit/) - the Motor pulley is the same amount of teeth as the last one I made but the wheel pulley will be 36t instead of 39... not sure how much of a difference that will make but I have also considered getting more teeth on the motor pulley.
[* 6374 190kv Motor](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/motor-6374-190kv-3150w/)  - on my last board I went from a high kv small motor that didnt have very much torque to a bigger motor with lower 190kv - so this is the same kv as the last just a hair longer though
[* Transmitter&Receiver](http://psychotiller.com/product/24ghz-remote-controller) - I tried 3 transmitters last time
[* ESC](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-12s-120a-car-esc-opto-hv/?attribute_type=Single+12S+120A+Unsensored+ESC) - Maybe I wont use my VESC that I have laying around... I will need to be spoon fed on getting the VESC to work because I am not good with those kind of things. 
[* UBEC](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/12s-ubec/) - it came already hooked up last time i ordered it with with the esc which was nice

**_First off thank you to everyone who helped me with my first board whether you know you helped me or not from direct information or from what you have posted!_** @torqueboards, @onloop @chaka, @psychotiller, @stealth71, @evoheyax, @ChuckhobbytownUSA, @lox897, @Mikeomania12, @laurnts 
 ---------- Questions I have - First three Questions are all kind of the same question really
1.Suggested mount-  I have read a dozen posts on the motor mount and I don't want any of that headache. The loosening,Welding, Cracking, Breaking and everything else. I will buy whatever trucks/entire deck that will help me avoid motor mount problems. Every time I think i decided on a mount I read one more review or post that makes me reconsider. if I had to choose this very second it would maybe be @psychotiller 's but I wanted to ask for input on this first since I have a Big Battery and a Big Motor.
2. Suggested Trucks - for the mount
3. or suggested complete board with trucks and everything - for the mount 
3. there is not a 6374 with a higher kv value on DIY site and although I probably wont use all the speed on flat or downhill my favorite thing is **being able to carve UPHILL!!!**! I LOVE IT! suggestions? 
4. I have had several people ask me to build them one or one for their kid- any legal issues I should be worried about or anything/advice? 
5. as you can tell I am wasting some money here with my lack of knowledge  - what would you suggest to make my build better... and I am going to edit this soon after i start getting some feedback so the whole world doesn't know how big of a n00b i am... unless you can talk me out of editing it ...

THANK YOU ALL in advance :)

1. IMO enertion's is bullet proof and the best one out there.
2. Caliber 2
3. 190kv on 10s should be plenty of speed.
4. Google the laws for your area. I'd limit it to 20-25kph, that's like 15mph. It is safer that way.

I have enertion mount with calliber 2 trucks works great, no complaints. However I believe all other motor mounts are pretty much reliable. 190KV is my motor selection, speed and insane torque. 25kph is a general safety speed limit rule in which you will easily get over with 190kv 10s setup. I could also reach 25kph with 190kv 6s, so please be ware with speed limit.

Trucks- White pony and others have been touting and working on DIY Ronin truck they say head and shoulders above caliber and Paris if you are looking for DIY type stuff. 

Motor - 63__ 190kv is becoming an unofficial standard plenty of power and with the right power source plenty of umpf for 25+ mph which is carving cruising limit

Nice - looks like you have a lot of good stuff for this and future builds!

If you are in vegas - why don't you hook up with @Michaelinvegas?  He can show you some of his setups and you can see exactly what you like?

I personally:
1. DIYes, Enertion, other's (DIYes most flexibility and still rock solid, Enertion second and great, but less flexibility on deck choice and angles/clearance)
2. Caliber II's for sure or Ronin if you fab an adapter for the motor mount.
3. 190kv or maybe 170kv (few out there).  Even 149 is great - i like lower kv motors w/ higher voltages.
4. - same w/ Lox.  Cool person - maybe sign a simple release of liability as extra CYA.
5. - just parts for future builds, or guest boards, or sell them to someone starting out later...  Nothing wrong w/ being a noob...  All good questions and good for others to learn along with you.

Best of luck!

Lox! You Are seriously the coolest! thanks for all of your help and all of it being fast help too! :)  so I am guessing [**these ones**](http://www.enertionboards.com/buy-build-your-own-electric-skateboard-parts/enertion-50-degree-longboard-skate-electric-trucks/) since they are the only ones that I could find on the enertion site... it doesnt say anything about one side being different than the other or if they can do dual (even though I am doing single for now) I just want to confirm with you on these. 

I am thinking about asking for a customized[ mono kit](http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/mono-drive-mechanical-kit) since I wont need the [83mm Wheels](http://www.enertionboards.com/buy-build-your-own-electric-skateboard-parts/83mm-enertion-power-wheels/)

I would have got [DIYs kit](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-single-motor-mechanical-kit/) for 50 cheaper but I want the Enertion mount.
AND I feel like I owe onloop something for having this amazing forum!

sl33py! Thank you for the thorough response and ya I did pm Michael about meeting up we just havent got to it yet :) ... so did you end up sawing your caliber 2's? I know there is about 20 bucks to be saved there if you do it yourself to get your drive gear to fit.
 and I am going to have to look up this adapter? for the mount?

At the bottom of Torqboards website it says **_"We noticed many of our customers are looking for a pre-welded motor mount solution. I’m proud to now announce that we will start having pre-welded single and dual motor mount kits available for purchase."_**

So since these are not out yet has anyone seen any other options and how much they cost???

or would anyone recommend against it?

I could be wrong, but I think that part of the website is outdated. I haven't heard any mention of weld on mounts for a long while. I'm sure it's been mentioned somewhere that welding weakens the trucks as well. Maybe @torqueboards can clear this up for you.

@KlethBane - Yeah, no welded trucks anymore. The bolt on setups allow for more convenience and adjustment.

You can try our bolt on motor mounts. We've since added 2x Set Screws on our truck clamps which make them rock solid. Rock solid or your money back. :)

OK so here are my problems so far - For some reason when I use the brake sometimes I will find that i cant throttle all the way back up to full speed until i turn the board off and then back on again. - **_actually that is my biggest problem for now and the others seem real minor._**
 I would just like to be able to brake since I have such big wheels on here now and it goes so much faster than my last build that it really becomes a lot more of process to get the thing to stop rolling.

I was going to ask torque boards about what I ordered last time compared to this time.... since last time I had two power cables coming out and now I only have one coming out of the SBEC/UBEC or whatever i got this time. Not a real big deal because I am sure I can figure something else out for my lights that I haven't ordered yet.(**still looking at what options i have**)

also not a big deal but I can only thread three of the screws through my drive wheel and the other three don't line up.

(Its just velcro that is holding it on - i have the kydex - just haven't made an oven for it yet) Hopefully someone on here has had the same problem with the braking though - also when I brake I noticed that if I am just coasting before I brake that I have to give it a little bit of throttle because it wont brake from coasting... I was thinking maybe if i turned the drag on then maybe that would help solve the problem... I have been playing with the programming card a bunch and changing all the settings - but I don't really want to have to reset the board every time after I use the brake

What you need to do is plug that long wire from the esc into channel 2 on receiver and the ubec wire into any other channel, making sure that the VCC and GND are in the right spot

@KlethBane - Your saying you apply brakes and you can't reach top speed again? I wouldn't use drag brake as that means as soon as you coast it will apply brakes.

If you throttle before you brake you'll have much better stopping power. You shouldn't need too unless your at crawling/slow speeds. Have you tried increasing the braking %? What firmware version do you have on the current ESC?

I love the 6374 190!  It has some crazy torque for a single motor.  I ended up with 90mm wheels and they are real nice for speed.  I believe the larger radius = faster top speeds but reduces torque a bit.  It looks like you're looking for a lot of torque for going up hills.  I think the 12s is gunna be nice for your commute.  I just finished my build with 10s2p with (2) 5000 mah Turnegy lipos.  I'd love to see your process with making the kydex enclosure.  I wouldn't mind splitting the costs with you to build a vacume form.  From what I saw in the comments, are you from Vegas?  I am too and would love to meet up to just shoot the shit, brainstorm, or just ride!  Just PM me and lets sync up :slight_smile:  Good luck bro!

@KlethBane I've.been testing out some walkie talkies .... I haven't had some in a while, last one was Motorola....but I think I found a winner for Esk8....

It's not a helmet mic setup but I don't think we need it unless you ride only with another person all the time...I think we'd need something a little more universal and cheap...

 Baofeng BF-888S Plus UHF Walkie Talkie Long Distance Range Communication Two-Way Radios (Black 2Pcs) Upgrade Version Of BF-888S 


https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EHIAWUI/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apip_jgfKv8liQU6To

These are cheap...and they work....comes with a PTT ear piece...and charging base.  If we all had the same kind...meeting up and communicating would be zero hassles.  It's a simple radio works for what we need it for...loud speaker...and headset works well....
This is the most economical solution....and it's so cheap...we don't need a group buy....

And ...these of course these can be used for other things...like...leave one in bathroom ....and the other in main area ....so when you run out of toilet paper....you can call rather than holler lol

Also...the Bluetooth radios are limited to certain amount sets it can speak to...with walkies don't have that problem.....again super simple with the walkies...it has audible channel selection so don't need to look at what channel ur on...so basically no button mashing

PS. I do own a pair of the ones I linked ...

Very nice fit and finish ... radio quality it spot on...does feel cheap at all

Yeah we use these but they only work with either a fullface TSG or a helmet with ear padding like my Giro Snowboard helmet.

This is the model, kind of a generic BT motorcycle headset but they actually work really well.

http://www.ebay.com/itm/2x-BT-Bluetooth-Motorcycle-Helmet-Interphone-Intercom-Headset-V6-1200M-6-Riders-/111981687812

They were really helpful at last year's Maker Faire Detroit, when we needed to communicate with each other across a huge venue at The Henry Ford

@RunPlayBack

The reviews on that Ebay link are pretty bad - even the one that gave it five stars seemed like maybe he meant to give it different stars.

Sure that's the same one as yours?

Yup it's the same one, but there's probably different versions floating around or probably an upgraded version. Like I said it's kind of a generic brand made for motorcycles which are inherently faster and louder than riding an eboard so results may vary. In my particular case they worked fine. But it's definitely not an expensive name brand, might be worth to research some more.

Well if you have walkie talkies ... we just need to be on the same channel

As for the Bluetooth....when it come to the cheaper brands ... it's hit or miss...like in your video...would need to pony up for the good ones that would last..... 

Most of those would only work for motorcycle helmets because of how they are positioned in the helmet....using a helmet without ear covers wouldn't work .... and you'd need a mic boom as well...

And as mentioned you are limited to the number people that you can speak to at one time....can't hoot and holler like you can with walkie talkies and lastly compatibility issues....not all brands work together

@Michaelinvegas is this [board](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/drop-deck-for-an-electric-board-setup/4355/5?u=klethbane) yours? 

I read all 21 posts on that one and am still not sure what I think but if that one is yours maybe I could give it a couple pushes before I make mine like that. Just to make sure thats what I want while the parts to the rest of it are on the way.
