Anyone else drooling over these photos?
Trying to figure out what he has going on there but it looks awesome!

I think I read somewhere there's a 12s6p battery packed into that thing!

I guess he uses his standard deck and Trampa trucks with angled risers.
Looks like the perfect city commuter: short and (hopefully) not too heavy while giving you the smooth ride only pneumatics can do.

Tell us more @unik

i bought some freebord bindings to try them on a trampa mountainboard, i will publish my opinion when i will receive them :))

I already have a set of freebord bindings attached to my short ride. Its tricky and doesn't let me bail as fast or clean as I would like to. With pnuematics though I think I would feel soooo much better and smooth. Motivation for sure.

I think psychotillers new 6" billet roadie wheels, or perhaps limited edition Enertion 5" pnuematics would look great on that. Simply because it looks strange being a short board that's that high off the ground.
I think trampa only do 7 ~ 9" wheels (but they're working on a 6" tyre and a 125mm skate type rubber one which'll also look awesome)

hehe ! thanks guys / okp here.

I did that for fun. Got this project for like one year in my mind but didn't have time to work on it.

It's a 12S6P / 66T / 15T / 168kv / Dual VESC

3D printed enclosure / Carbon Fiber blue 

Custom AL7075 risers, custom short mounts for Trampa Vertigo (will be making a few also on MBS Matrix II if there's any interest in a group buy) 

Sorry for the (genuine) hooks, been riding that for several years and I see that it has inspired some people here and there; these are freebord, but also got custom 3D printed mounts that were not finished.

That's just insanity ! thanks for the love. Did a quick edit yesterday 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAkpsMPtV5g

I will be pulling some 7 trampa slick wheels on it too. Got some on my bench. Just ordered two 148kv to see if any difference.

as said on the chat, if there's any interest I will probably do a group buy on the AL7075 short mounts for Trampa and  35Â° riser + short mounts for MBS Matrix PRO trucks ... and also the 66T wheel pulleys.

that's the 3D printed enclosure. It's quick and dirty but does the job.

Hey okp,

Big fan of your builds...can't tell you how many times I watched your videos jumping the unik board...so much that I ended up building my own. I'm also interested in the 3D printed bindings...there is definitely room for design improvements over the freeboard which I'm using now.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/b/8b219e46a2c8fdfdcd9ddb4e62aa8d817de17064.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I have not produced them yet, so that's only for my personal use/prototyping; happy to see more and more people putting binding on their electric decks; Really proud to be the "inventor" of this riding style ! Freebord bindings are cheap; so going into production of these may cost more than anything else at this time

thanks :) your stance is really short mate. Once the mountain series is released, I'll see how to move forward on this; especially on the weight of the stainless steel part to make this lighter :slight_smile:

The weight of the stainless steel really bugs me...looking forward to see what you come up with.

I'm riding in Paris with the board that I've designed leveraging some specs of the Jet Spud. It's hand made in France by a shaper and has a good flat area to get the battery pack flat. Been riding it for several years, and then created UNIKBOARDS to make this reality.

yeah it worth ! I went 12S6P and did that build pretty quickly. I'll post a build thread soon; just need to get all my prototypes parts coming cause I don't want to put this one apart ! I ride it so often.

Hi!!!

This post is a year old but it is what made me sign up for an account.  I'm new to eboarding (3 months) and am in NYC.  I own an Evolve GTX but it is a bit awkward here in the city.  This Short All Terrain is my dream board!!

I want to take a stab at building it, but am finding it VERY hard to research how to obtain all the necessary parts. I feel confident that I can actually build it once I have all the parts, I am handy and technical in other ways despite never building an eboard before.

I am wondering if you can help point me in the direction of where you got everything!  I NEED this board (or similar) in my life!!  

Do you think I can building this for $1,000 USD or less?   Would you ever entertain the idea of being paid to build an identical one for someone?

Please, any help would be much appreciated! Thanks!

The biggest issue with building this board is the risers. They are very difficult to source. @okp might have some. It took me a year to get some. 

You could always use surf rodz with extended axles and 6 shooter pnumatics. Talk to @psychotiller about both.   

Other than those issues, it's difficult to fit a decent size battery on such a short board, but a 10s2p double stacked is doable. 

I would suggest you srart but building a parts list an experiment with different combinations, then ask the community what they think. Good luck.

I'm currently building a hybrid like this, and I'm kinda worried about the leverage that the risers would put on the deck because the wheels are not directly under the risers. Especially if the deck is not carbon fiber reinforced.

If it makes you feel better, I've been using a wood drop-down deck for almost half a year with a similar setup, haven't had a single problem with it, never used carbon fiber. Just occasionally check to make sure your mounting screws are tight, you should be fine.
