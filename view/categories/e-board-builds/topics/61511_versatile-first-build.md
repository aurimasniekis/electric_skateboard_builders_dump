Hi Everyone!

After a long while of research and discussion with other builders here on the forum and some digging on the Sub reddit as well. I've finally committed to starting my first build! I've gone through different phases before arriving with this decision but I want to be determined to build a board that rides and performs just the way I like as while there are many great builds out there like Kaly and Lacroix, I can't find the right features and performance that I feel are going to work for me the most.

I have no experience with building anything like this and don’t have any experience with soldering or any of that sort but I have friends and family who I can get help from for those. I'll slowly be building the log over the course of the build and will keep it up to date as parts arrive and changes (which I think are expected) occur.You're welcome to pitch in and critique on my parts list and vision for this build. Now, Onward to the actual build details!

What I'm hoping my Build to Achieve:

1. Versatility - I want to be able to swap out other components as needed but generally build around the motors or the deck depending on how well I like the feel for my deck of choice.

2. Good Carving Ability - I enjoy carving as much as you guys do!

3. Stability at speed - While I enjoy feeling that wind while cruising down a flatland I don't really need to go very fast. If it can hit 28-31mph then that is already plenty fast for me. Given those speeds I want to be able to worry less about speed wobbles, I know technique plays a huge portion but if I can maximize the performance of hardware to reduce the speed wobbles then I'm all for it!

4. Dancing - Now I know that popping up a expensive and hard earned board is the last thing others would do I would agree. The most I'd like to do is dancing but I'm willing to dance on a shorter board as I know dancer boards usually go for 43"+ but I wouldn't want a board with that kind of length.

5. Distance - Being able to hit 30km of range would be enough for me but if I can stretch it further then by all means lol.

6. Hill Climbing - There aren't any steep rolling hills that I plan on using it on but if it can do 25% gradients then I believe those should meet my usage needs just fine.

Also want to add I'd prefer it stealthy that I can kick push as I wouldn't want to attract attention when using it if possible. I'm planning for this to be my all in build as I don't want to have to put together a build from the ground up again as this will likely burn a big hole in my wallet not to mention any parts that I'll need to maintain it in the long run. Basically my all around, Go-to build for everyday use is what I'm after

You are on the right track. 

I would not bet my money on the unity to be out soon. If you want your build finished sooner you should get focboxes. 

Torque drives should just work with your desired speeds. You won’t be able to go faster though. If you want decent torque and a bit more speed you’ll need to go for xl drives in 4wd which are sold out.

Thanks @sayekim! I realized now that I hadn’t added in the remotes and bluetooth modules yet though I may end up putting in the nano v2 as its well regarded in the forum! 

I don’t think my budget would allow a 4WD on the speed drive XL’s plus I don’t intend to go that fast. I’m more open to a 4WD on the v4 torque drives right now as I think I’ll need torque to get me over some inclines as I’m also on the heavier side(220lbs) plus It’ll help me keep the budget from rocketing too high lol I figured the torque drives offered more torque at a lower KV? Or does the XL provide significantly more due to it being larger at 2250W vs the 400W per motor?
```

Hmm the torque drives are only 400w? That’s surprising as you would assume it would be much higher considering it’s advertised as “torque drive”. Even some China brand hubs are rated at 500w per hub. 

Or are the torque drives larger motors?

Yup that’s what’s advertised on the carvon site though still more than twice than what I’ve got on my China board(Ownboard W1 Pro) lol also it says its 75kv but doesnt really give size or dimensions of the motors

Sounds like you are on the right track if you go with the tesseract @Eboosted mayb have a enclosure that is already fitted to that board.  I would go the surfrodz for the second truck if your budget allows it.  I would go with the 2 focboxes.  I would go with the 10s5p just to be safe for your range you want and you will get less sag

Thanks @briman05! Appreciate it. Also are you referring to a different surfrodz truck? Also 2 focboxes for a 2WD Torque drive? 

I’ll send @Eboosted a PM though I’m aware he does have enclosures for other Loaded boards so He would understand their overall dimensions. Now that you mention the distance and voltage sag, I’ve yet to use the esk8 calculator given what I want so far

If you have 2 motors on the which I believe the carvon system has you will need 2 focboxs.  I was refurring to the same surfrodz 200mm rkp but as the one thread about speed wobble on here suggests you can use different base plates angles to help reduce speed wobble.  Surfrodz sells a 35* baseplate.

If it’s anything above 349 watts rated motors then all I’m interested for speed and torque is the kv rating. 

My 350 watt meepo/wowgo hubs rated 75 kv can take on hills just fine. Not super fast but they can take them. 
They do get very hot though on 12s.

I gotta read up more on how the kv and watts correlate haha. My Ownboard does get quite hot as well when going up an incline, I do hope the carvons heat up much less because of the design of the motors

Ok I was overwhelmed with all the info, basically rule of thumb is to keep the front truck angle to 35 deg? It continues to mention the TB 218mm or Caliber2 trucks. I think the TB218 would make the front wheels wider than the Carvon TD's on the rear?
```

Correct because most people use caliber style trucks but the same principles of it can be applied here

Thanks. Not sure about what angle the rear trucks have to be. I checked the carvon site for the TD v4's but it doesn't indicate the degree of the trucks so I'll probably need an extra surfrodz 35deg baseplate for it if I'm not mistaken?
```

## \#21 Posted by: Wraith Posted at: 2018-07-12T03:28:25.563Z Reads: 155

I realized that based on Carvon's page for the TD V4's that they recommend only using VESCs. Does it matter all that much to use a VESC over the FocBox for the TD's?
```

---
## \#22 Posted by: Wraith Posted at: 2018-07-12T04:01:29.206Z Reads: 164

```
so the V4 torque drives are only 50W difference with the same Kv. wonder how much of a difference it will be in terms of the torque and the temperature when going up hills.

is there any reason also not to go Focbox over VESC besides what Carvon states on their site?
```

---
## \#23 Posted by: sayekim Posted at: 2018-07-12T06:57:07.118Z Reads: 170

```
On 10s they got less hot and carvon recommends 10s. I think it is mostly for this reason they recommend 10s. 
I can’t say if they will have more torque but my guess is it will have slightly more torque. 

I had to check the vesc recommendation. It states “Use only Vedder's ESCs.” 
Either they state it like this for legal reasons or to include esc that support vesc tool software. 

You can just use focboxes. I would if I wasn’t able to score some ESCapes.

They are based on vesc6 specs and they are hard to come by. stewii is the person that makes them and I believe he recently closed his round 2 sale. 
He is not a company which is why there have now only been two sale runs.

I just skimmed through it on mobile while I'm away from my computer. It’s got the performance of 3 Vescs in parallel? Not sure if @stewii was referring to the single or dual version for that tho I’m guessing its the dual.  Sounds like it can handle all  the Amps you’d need and having a heat sink plus enclosure sounds really good! I hope to get the chance and order one. So I’m guessing it uses the same VESC BLDC?
```

I am not a vesc expert and not very familiar with what the specs are for the vescs. I just know that the version 6 based ones are the latest versions which is all I need to know. 

The thing is that “vesc” has been trademarked which is why it is al so confusing. 

Trampa are the only ones that are officially allowed to use the word vesc to refer to their esc which is why now when you search for vesc you’ll end up there. 

It used to not be trademarked and then when anyone referred to a vesc we would know that we are talking about an esc that runs on vesc tool software which used to be called bldc tool software. 

To come back to where you can purchase one, if you want an official vesc 6 then you can only purchase it from trampa since they are the only one that make them. 
As an alternative vesc 6 based esc you can get:

* Flipsky fsesc 6 but it is still unfamiliar and untested

* ESCape tested by members of the forum and wildly popular but only very little are available if at all (and the only other vesc 6 based esc that is almost the same as the trampa vesc 6 minus an nrf chip and something else I can’t remember that doesn’t matter to me)

* B-box also tested by members here and actually a derivative of the ESCape made by an ex member bimmer to be sold USA side territory

You can forget about the Bbox though since he stopped and seems to have not even forfilled outstanding orders and taken peoples money. 

There is one more vesc 6 based esc to be released but only in dual form which is called the Focbox Unity. Members are testing this right now and it is supposed to be a step forward in the way that it will do motor detection. All new Enertion Raptor 2.1 will be released with this esc. 

Fyi this forum is owned by Enertion as well as the electric-skateboard.club forum. Member onloop is Jason the owner of Enertion.

Thanks for the info, yes I’m aware that enertion owns the forum and that there’s another esk8 forum endless sphere but the esk8 builder appears to have more active members for whatever reason. Also didnt know that Jason’s handle on the forum was actually onloop lol I was always wondering who he was on here.

Also I contacted the builder who produces the ESCapes so hopefully I do get a chance to get in on the next GB for a dual ESCape.

Interesting how the unity is VESC 6 based and not based on the original VESC-X before they rebranded to Foxbox. Or does the difference really boild down to the BLDC tool they use?

Also looking for a BMS that would work well with a 10a6p but I’m still going through the forum search results for BMS.

While canvassing for good fitting enclosures, I've found some that should fit alright with a tesseract, Psychotiller's Argonaut, Master Cho CF enclosure and an enclosure from Bigben. Still getting feedback from them but hopefully find one that will fit just right for my needs. Also checking if I can source a battery from Tinniesinker for the 10s5p or 10s6p. 

Ervinelin also suggested going with a spud as not to put a bigger risk of messing up the tesseract on the first go at it sop I'll weight that in as well.

sounds like a really good build!  Everything you have specced and been advised to use is spot on.  One thing though and this is from experience, go for the maytech remote,  the new small version, it is so much better than the nano (I have both) and the maytech just feels smoother in its delivery with a longer throttle travel which smooths things out.  Batteries from @tinniesinker look good too,  mine is under construction soon. :grinning:

Thanks! I'll take the maytech remote into consideration although I had only remembered now that I got in on the Firefly Group buy by @SeeTheBridges. I forgot I ordered one last May lol so I have yet to compare the two remotes. What's the name of they maytech remote? or would you happen to have a link to ?

Also still trying to decide on the Bestech BMS for a 10s. Also reading up on the forum if I can go for an 11s if that will allow me to use a 10s now and upgrade to an 11s later but I still have to research about that.

Hoping that @tinniesinker can manage an overseas shipping for the pack as many of us know that shipping packs like that is quite difficult(I'm based in the Philippines)

Does the Maytech remote feel ok in the hand? it looks kinda weird. I have a nano-x and its ok i guess

@Wraith preliminary search has found ~$100 with Pack and Send but I'll have to visit in-store(with a battery pack?) for an exact price. FedEx wanted like $250 or some nonsense

I love the maytech compared to my nano,  it fits in your hand really snug and as I said the throttle has more physical travel so its less snatchy on the c section board (dual 6374)  I found the nano was a bit touchy and with the torque it was a bit hairy going from downhill rolling to power on.  The maytech just allows a bit more delicate feed in.  @longhairedboy uses it too I think and that was a good enough endorsement for me  Great news on the battery, looking forward to all that lovely power!
Better order the charger, any recommendations?

On a serious note,  If you are using 4.12 vescs of any manufacturer on a dual build, be very aware of linking them together with canbus.  Never power them up individually while connected by the can bus cable.. By that I mean disconnecting one without first turning off the board or disconnecting the battery. If you have a problem with one vesc disconnect the can bus cable before powering it up on its own or you will fry both of your expensive controllers.  Trust me on this, 2 focboxes later......
There are many threads on the safety and protection of your speed controllers and read every one of them because no manufacturer provides even the basic set up instructions or warnings apart from hobbyking and that still doesn't mention the can bus pitfalls.  Can bus is probably the best way of linking two vescs together but also the most dangerous.  check out ppm or canbus in the search window and you will be enlightened.  In fact do a search before posting or creating a thread because 9 times out of 10 its here.
Nice talking to you mate.

Lol yeah I’m surprised that they released that at around the same time I started checking for the appropriate drive for my build. Only bad feedback I had from them was their motor mounts coming loose but besides that everything good from them not to mention their great customer service even just answering my questions on their site chat! 

Given that it’s gonna be awhile for me to get all the parts together things might just work out if they release it in time!

Adding in the TB On Off Power switch but still have to look for a battery display as well. Is the TB power switch of good quality? It says it can handle anywhere from 6s to 12s which does sound good.

Would a 200mm rkp surfordz truck be well suited for good carves and no wobbles at high speeds? I hear the surfrodz tkp sold by @psychotiller are great but I don’t need the hangers that go with them

Not sure which of the two, surfrodz 200mm and TB 218mm would fit better on the CarvonV4 TDs

Thing is I wont be needing the mounts that go with it but I’ve read similar on their carvability. Would having a TKP in front and an RKP in the rear be fine? I think the carvons use RKPs

If you use a TB 218 for the front, and if you want then to be the same length as the carvons, you will have to trim some axle.  I do t remember exactly how much. I cut off both sides and rethreaded the axle. It was pretty easy.

Oh alright I'm getting abit confused as to how long the trucks should be so that they line up with the carvons just fine. I saw a post by @psychotiller on one of his customer builds and he used the Psycho 273mm RKP which based on the photos looked like they lined up fine. 

I'm checking the carvon site and it says axle end to end is 280mm while the Pyscho trucks show 273mm. not sure if they're both referring to the total width. Is that what I should be looking at to get that aligned look?

After lots of reading up on the forum and asking around, I've decided to switch over to gear drive. I've got @Kug3lis TB218 pneumatic Fatboy Mini gear drives to go with my @Hummie deck which I've already ordered.
I do plan on running 6.5" Trampa tires on the drives and downsizing to a 12s4p 30Q pack instead to keep the weight more manageable :laughing:

I also realized that I may not get the torque I need if I go up hills on the Carvons which was one of the reasons why I opted for gear drives

I used a Dremel with a good cutting wheel. Took about a minute to do both Motors.
I left my pulley on and used it as a guide of where I wanted to cut.
But I'm very confident with a dremel. If you're not, I would take the time to mark it and take the pulley off so there's no mistakes.

Okay so quick update cause it felt like everything went by so quickly but here it is!
I just went and grabbed a set of the famed SR 200mm RKPs for the build which was something I’ve been eyeing for a while but never could pull the trigger on because of the price and compatibility with @Kug3lis Fatboy Mini 1:3 gear drives but after looking up the threads, looks like im getting the custom Fatboy Hangars compatible with SR baseplate!

Got them from @Colson003 for $130 thanks for these man! 
 https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landyatchz-evo-sz-200mm-rkp-tb-218-lunacycle-antispark-switch/66886?u=wraith

Going to have them sent over to @psychotiller so he can sell me more stuff. Particularly 80mm SR axles lol 

I should be able to use the riptide canon bushings from Riptide which @alphamail originally suggested for me to use with the TB218s but SRs would make all the difference. Good thing I got 2 sets of these and a single magnum+ caliber pivots(which I need to find a set of trucks for) will need to get a set of riptide pivot cups as well though but I’ll stick to stock SR pivots for now
Thanks @skunk for helping influence me on grabbing these lol

I typically run harder bushings board side and a harder conbo in the rear. But a lot of it depends in your weight and riding style, eether your looking for comfort or performance. 

If your iver 180 I'd start with 93/96a combos and cupped/flat washers.

@Skunk  I do not recall saying "say it’s hard to improve upon the SR set ups" What I am saying about SR is they could use improvement in the Bushing seat design for the TKP's since they cannot accept either the Magnum or Chubby.  I modified the seats on a set of Hybridz and it transformed the trucks in a great way!

I'm expecting to have to take the board apart and do adjustments multiple times in the first few weeks
I'm like that with my normal skateboards I don't see why it be any different with an electric one

Now thats got me abit worried. Gonna go over that now. They seem nice though and look much like the sealed ones I’ve got.

Though recently with the motors failing(magnets, bearings) I wanna play it safe

I've got a set atm.
I didn't see some of the problems people were having with them when I bought them.
But from what I can tell most people who had problems with them was when they are being sold as dark matter motors.
I talked to a few people who've gotten them more recently and they seem to be running them reliably.

Has anyone had any experience with these?

I know I said I'd prefer to keep the Hummie deck CF look but it looks so soft and nice :drooling_face: 
then maybe do the glass frit over it but then not sure if it will adhere to it the same way standard grip does as it was originally intended to be used with

Since I wanted to do some updates to my log only to find out that I can no longer update the OP due to it "expiring" even though I'm the OP.. :man_shrugging:

I'll just post a couple more updates here before starting a clean slate for the build once its actually ready for assembly just to keep it all in order I suppose.

so for the updates!

Got my hands on a DieBieMS from @samau18's  2nd batch(don't worry I'm still keen on my order on the 3rd batch :wink:) which I purchased brand new from @colson003. It's second part coming from him that goes to this build now :smile: aand finally paid @psychotiller for his vital hand in this build's completion! can't thank this guy enough for helping this build actually come together!

$107 DieBieMS 2nd Batch (totalled to $115 after all the fees and conversion rates)
$271 Psychotiller parts and labor(especially labor :joy:)
$25 Psychotiller hat :sunglasses:

I'll be patiently waiting on @winfly's compression packs in the coming weeks and hoping to do a 12s5p 
More to come as the other parts finally arrive, that being the hummie deck,DieBieMS, X-things, 6.6 flipskys currently headed for Tiller! :grin:

So I just ordered a pair of 
https://www.sickboards.nl/en/washers/12205-valkyrie-cupped-washers.html
and a single 44 deg Caliber Baseplate also from sickboards. they're the only ones selling single baseplates individually so that much made it a easier decision as for the washers I kinda jumped at them without really looking that hard around for other washers but these cupped washers should suit just fine.
X-Things from @akhult have also arrived with Dave so looking forward to seeing those mounted up. Thanks again Matt!

All that's left to complete the rear truck is a FB240 Precision truck once the GB goes live in a week or two!

Just ordered my 6.5" Trampa tires and tubes. got 5 pieces and cost me alot more after shipping and conversion rates :sweat: I figured better to get a spare as well and just order another one if I ever get a single flat. Shipping is around $40 and I don't want to pay that again for a single spare :neutral_face:

Total cost is $165 with shipping and all. one more off the checklist!
Just need waiting for @Kug3lis'  Fb240 Hangar and that should do it for all the mechanical parts :smile:

A few. I’ll try to get it up soon after I get past a few hurdles with the build at present. Sorry for missing on updates, I’m unable to edit the original post now because of the post age. 

Quick text update as I’m about to call it a day. 
Majority of parts have arrived and I’m focusing my attention in wiring and electricals. Specifically the compression packs from @winfly as I’m part of the Beta test batch. I’m hooking it up to the DieBieMS from batch 2 of @Samau18 but its missing the 16p connector for the balance wires and I’m still trying to get my hands on 22 awg wires for balance. Thats because I got it almost brand new but it wasn’t in the packaging for some reason

I need to get the battery and bms connections sorted out before i can worry about connecting them to the vescs and finally configuring the escs.

Later than i though i would be able to update.

Bigger problems as I only found out now thag I’m not using a high enough strand count of 10 and 12 awg wire. Had to order more and a set of M5 crimps for the diebiems as I’ve wasted the ones that go with the bms on the solders I’ve used with the wrong wires.

![image|375x500](upload://7LFfTaEumH4lGSQpfYWgSMyW4wr.jpeg) 

This is what I was able to order in physical stores so far
![image|375x500](upload://j8B9wKAWl4kVRMbhid35kdBrbIq.jpeg) 

This is what I thought I was getting and what everyone uses

![image|375x500](upload://oEq3lg4hxSwOTxEiH6XD65Nxw8f.jpeg) 
More setbacks unfortunately but its good that I caught it before I started hooking it all up together and dealing with more headaches down the line. 

USPS from @psychotiller which has the Fast Edd 10mm bearings should arrive in a few days along with the 5.5 bullets, 10 awg flexible silicone high strand(the right one this time hopefully) which I ordered earlier on before finding out about the incorrect strands 

Have to still figure out how I’m going to squeeze the motor bullets right at the tunnel riser or maybe inside it and run extended wires through the phase wire channel

![image|666x500](upload://jc0iwNGt50T0P9v6iReL4Qxivnp.jpeg) 

One more thing I’m unsure of in terms of fitting are the stock 10mm bearing spacers for the SR trucks. I do hipe they are long enough to fit the Fatboy hubs 

![image|375x500](upload://swPdfdCJDmSniKmCeUJw78Y1eux.jpeg) 

Hipefully it does and i can mount all wheels. Also ordered extra braid as im all out now after soldering and de-soldering the ones I’ve got. More positive updates to come hopefully
