Hello everyone. I’m Roman, 26 and I’m Russian. I have lived in Ukraine, Portugal, Brazil and currently UK.
My skate experience is using a penny board for 1 year daily.

I was introduced to esk8 through a YouTube video and fell in love with it. But when I saw the price, I gave up. But then I discovered this forum and thought that it’s possible to build one cheaper. So I literally saw every diy video on YT to learn and get inspired. All started in April 2017. I gathered info until October and started buying the parts.

My initial option was to build the cheapest but reliable board available, around 300£. But I was buying parts separately so I spent a little more and got a little better quality parts.

First was the deck, Loaded Dervish. I bought it used on ebay, it came with Adam Colton Paris Trucks and Otang Durian wheels. But it was in bad shape so I sanded it, applied varnish and put a custom griptape. I put 3 coats of varnish and sanded between each cote. Had to wait 2h between each cote to dry.  Then I sprayed a 4th cote just on the bottom.  I took @lox897 idea and printed a Dervish deck template with hexagons that I made in Photoshop. It took me 6h to cut and apply the tape.

Then I bought the trucks, Caliber II 50º. Got them cheaper because of a fellow forum member tip @shawnyp

 But when I saw that @Brakeboard  was selling longboard kit again, I immediately bought them. And why you might ask? Because I don’t trust electronic brakes. I prefer having a manual option. But why don’t I learn to slide? Because there is no one to teach me. I know how to foot brake but I don’t think it’s enough.

Before Brakeboard, I bought 1 caliber mount from taobao but it doesn’t work. Then I bought a HobbyKing mount but wasn’t happy with it. So I decided to ask @marcmt88 if he could make a custom mount for me and he delivered. I still had to file the clamp a little but it was easy.

After that, I bought a @dickyho ESC and a little heatsink as another member recommended. It works ok. But suddenly @Yecrtz was selling a TB VESC and it was cheap, so I got it. He was patient and answered all my questions.

The 2x 5s 3Ah batteries that I bought for ESC, worked with VESC, obviously. I had some issues with the vesc but after using “search button” on the forum, somethings were fixed. I still need someone to approve my configurations.

Anti-spark XT90 loop key. Even though ebay esc doesn't need a antispark loop, when connecting the lipos, there is a spark.

After buying everything, I realized that what takes a big chunk of money, is little things like bolts, bearings, wires, connectors, solder, sandpaper, etc.

The motor is KEDA 6364. It came with stiff wires so I made a silicone wire mod and added 5.5mm bullet connectors. I also grinded two flat spots for pulley grub screws. Tip: before soldering and after striping the wires, heat them so that the coating melts. After that, use flux, tin them and solder.

Wheel pulley is cheap from ebay but it doesn’t fit caliber hanger by 2mm in diameter. But my brakeboard truck fits ok. It’s sturdy but ugly. Motor pulley is useless. So I bought another cheap pulley but this one is great.

Wheels are ABEC11 clones and they are not 78A like advertized. Probably they are harder than 86A. But the pulley and bolts work fine with them.

Enclosure is just cheap plastic box. I fixed it with gopro adhesive pads like @lowGuido did. If they brake, I’ll drill the deck.

I also had to buy Antex 100W soldering iron, forum member tip @mrjonnyjones, and it works very good.

I still have to tweak minor adjustments and loctite everything. So for now i don't have ride stats. In total i spent around **750£** but if i hadn't bought double parts and brakeboard brakes, it would be around **450£**.

fantastic build. Using brakeboard trucks was a really smart move. Do those work with any wheels or did you match your wheels to the brakeboard ones?

@Jg33, haven't tried yet because i'm still adjusting the vesc. but i'll tell you when i finish
@Jedi, will do
@faithfulpuppy, you need to do [this](https://youtu.be/B-nWyg_YpMA) or to buy brakeboard wheels

Looks mostly good to me. I noticed 2 things:

- PPM settings, looks like it's all defaults? At minimum you want to test with your remote, and make sure that with throttle neutral, you're in the "deadband" (near zero).
- battery low cutoff start/end look like they're for lithium ion (18650). You may want them higher for lipo. lipo basically has no energy below 3.7v per cell, and lose cycle life if you go much below this. With 20C zippies you may have significant voltage sag under load, so there's some fudge factor.

BTW love your build and those trucks!! Did you consider putting caliber on rear to make the mount situation simpler?

Thank you for the help.
The motor is on the front truck because breaks are on the rear. And I chose brakeboard truck because is wider, looks better and my pulley fits. But I still have calibers sitting in a box waiting

Nice build, happy I could help with the soldering iron! :-)  Never seen those Brakeboard trucks before, interesting! :D

Ah wasn't paying enough attention. Have you considered reversing the setup? Usually for weight distribution reasons, the powered wheels go in the rear (weight shifts backwards during acceleration) and braking wheels go in the front (weight shifts to front when braking).

By doing it in reverse you give up traction in all speed changes.

Well, you need some force to make the board stop, that's why it's easier to brake with your heel instead of toes. But I'm waiting on pedal extension and upgraded brake linings. So I'll try reversing. At least the deck is symmetrical so I just need to switch the phase wires ;)

They are fiction brakes. You attach a brake lining with carbon ceramic compound to the wheel then when you apply pressure to the pedal, the rotors make contact with the linings and the wheel stops.

2-3 weeks to UK. If you don't mind the waiting time, get it from ebay. If you do, spend double or more and get it faster.

@Jg33, @Jedi
As i'm using 20T pulley, i can't really climb decent hills, so i'm waiting for new 15T pulley.
This is what i managed to shoot today. Not perfect but you get an idea. I'll try to film better next time.

Little update: 
Got 15t pulley from China(2,5gbp and 7 days shipping 😲) very good quality and a new belt also cheap and fast.
Also tuned VESC settings for remote.
Assembled and went for a test ride. Got 24km/h max speed and had more available but i got scared and without helmet. Can't test range because of weather but the ground is wet and during my glorious 1km ride, nothing shorted on electrical side. 
I prefer using mechanical braking, feels more secure

Got to 28,5km/h still without helmet 😐
Changed front truck to TB218 from @BoostedBuilder.
But on Drop through my nose is 1cm lower than tail. Is that a problem? 
Ordered 93a wfb canon and fat cones like @Alphamail recommended.
Also is there a problem having front truck wider than back truck? Or is it better to have wider truck in the back?

shouldnt be a problem, some decks actually do that on purpose to promote leaning your weight forward to make the board more stable at higher speeds.

Update of drivetrain:
-TB218
-40T wheel pulley
-Enertion clone mount

Managed to reach 35km/h, no more,  with 60A motor, 40A battery settings.
Did climb 13°/ 23%, voltage sag was huge.
Range was 6km, 38v start and 37v end, like @Deckoz suggested. 
@Jg33 Nothing got warm, though it's 5°C.
GoPro adhesive didn't work for me. Duct tape came to the rescue.
I had to mount everything top mounted because of clearance of the motor plus a 1/4' or 6mm hard riser.
Running FOC with 3.34FW

I followed this guide https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/a-beginner-guide-to-diy-an-esk8/46844/16?u=grozniy, in FOC
And I used 38v start and 37v cut off voltage, 60a motor max, 40a bat max and 35a regen.

well, If blowing 1 vesc won't Bankrupt your build sure but If you don't want to risk losing money then don't do it.
10s is safer than 12s running foc on cheap vescs but the risk is still there.
