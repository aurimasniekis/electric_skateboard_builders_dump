Just a quick one showing my first build;
![new%20build%20018|666x500](upload://8bFDTWsNROgvDaRh2BXZteXkoOH.JPG)

finished product but i just need to do the grippy properly.  Ideas?

I bought an all terrain e sk8 thinking it would be what i wanted and guess what it wasn't.  
The deck was cool though so I thought i'd modify it a bit and then things just got out of hand.
![carbon|690x417](upload://b2Ewfyin316GyLgURm5r7ZIx05G.JPG)

I originally wanted a go anywhere type board but it kind of evolved.;)

![new%20build%20003|666x500](upload://dl9rwzaAb1Om8xQeOFstiQmZAOj.JPG)

Starting point with all the old nonsense out and ready for the new.
Purchased some 218 trucks from torque boards as they are kind of the only place you can get 218 trucks as far as i know.( feel free to enlighten me people). Then got some 6374 motors from hk of all places but hey they are good so far,  SK8, 194 kv and run cool as.
I first cut out the deck so it was drop through for that low and less distance to fall type feeling and then got carried away.
![new%20build%20004|666x500](upload://quXmRPl9WQdGZuHpfp5WMG02gWq.JPG)

enertion provided the dual vescs and the battery is a 10s 3p lg 18650 with bms  and is the only saving grace of the original unit.
![new%20build%20010|666x500](upload://gBKjesmoSS8wS2wytFNUVDtttHB.JPG)

Wiring is yet to be finalised as i'm waiting for a power switch...dont you think that in this day and age that vesc's should be switched.  Just saying...

![new%20build%20008|666x500](upload://pUFiZSKzPKD4qUBwP7fMPzQjr6k.JPG)![new%20build%20007|666x500](upload://rlkDskos0hDqCEtS7UuliqmjoGJ.JPG)![new%20build%20009|666x500](upload://pgvy9NQNNwKf23cIVNiKQ3NDQKJ.JPG)![new%20build%20010|666x500](upload://gBKjesmoSS8wS2wytFNUVDtttHB.JPG)

So here it is;

vescs   $475
Motors  $240
mechanicals - wheels/trucks etc - $400
Deck/battery/bms      - $500

So $1605 bucks aus.   wow pricey but not really when you compare the specs   
18k range   tested
55kmh on 10s tested with my 110 kg fat arse on it
torque enough to pull me up anything round here and i live in Australia's version of san fran

The base plates are not standard, they are 80 mm square and pull evenly across the diagonal   should be ok but doesnt hurt to reinforce.  The carbon is 5mm then 8mm foam then 5mm carbon it is very high in tensile strength.   Not the lightest carbon deck but probably the strongest.

True carbon is extremely strong but prone to stress cracking around mounting points. Given the drop deck mounting that would exert a lot of force around the area around the bolt nuts.

Even penny washers there would save a lot of crying down the road

Nice!!! I built my first DIY because I started modding that same china board lol Was going to shave down the inner tab to fit a longer pack as well but ended up using the battery for a completely different build. I had raised the escs to give me the full compartment to fit a 10S5P, but made it modular so I could re-fit with focboxes when they came in. Those got taken over by the DIY build too though

![01|281x500](upload://xtzgPGdDKQnb36vaXGESYgdVZ3P.jpg)

When you cut out the dropthrough did you have to change the truck hole pattern? I forget exactly but I thought this deck had a square hole pattern vs normal trucks. You did a really good job building this looks great man :)

Thanks for the heads up, I do have washers on the bolts but i think a plate will be a better bet especially as I'm heavy and the thing moves!

Griptape a bit more substantial now.  
I've just been riding it for a solid hour with no discernible voltage sag and the motors were just warm even with all the hill climbing around here but i did notice that the brakes can be a bit twitchy. They bite quickly and then fade off.  Is there something i can do in the programming?  I would prefer them to be the other way round as I'm sure I'll get caught out sooner or later

Hey man I'm using 16/36 and 330 belts 5m 15mm that i bought from RS components as quality belts are a must have.  Gives great torque and still tops out above 50ks on 10s!  I'm 110kgs too

@SuperBen
Thanks man,  that board shouldn't be sold at the price point to be honest.  Massive rip off.  I got mine for next to nothing so all good but shit two grand for that!  Hell no.  I had to modify the existing baseplates to fit the tb hangers as I didn't realise they weren't standard. I'd already dropped them through.

My bad,  brakes were twitchy because one of the mounts was loose and was binding the motor against the other.  :blush:
Tightened it up and now sweet as again.

Love the look of this build. I'm surprised after all the talk that you got those SK8 motors on there too...  You say 1mm to spare...  Did you do anything to make space savings, or did it just fit?

@Randyc1 yeah man 15mm,
@bloke900 the motor mounts are adjustable on the truck hanger, you have to position them so that they dont bind on each other while still leaving enough axle to fully engage the lock nut.  It is very tight though with the SK8 motors as they have the rear bearing outside of the can so they are a little bigger than 74mm

Hey guys just a bit of advice needed,  I want to upgrade the battery to either a 10s4p or 12s3p
both will fit without much modification but the question is will the 12s draw less amps than the 10s and therefore keep everything more efficient?
```

12s will give you more speed but less range.. id stick with the 10s..

I thought watthour is big decide factor for range? if u go 10s with same battery amount, u can get more amp out. but range should be same. u can get much more benefit than just speed. for example heat or wire thick ness and stress on components.

```
Volts an amps is exactly like hp vs torque. I guess the decision to go with 10s or 12s is upto you. I personally have 10s on dual 6374s and i cant even use more than half trigger on the remote... 12s would be out of control.. unless running phuematics tyres then 12s would be the go as you need more power to run them...

Thanks for the feedback man yeah I'm running 10s 3p atm and getting over 50kmh so speed is not really an issue but somewhere in my memory is something I read regarding higher voltage reducing the draw on the escs and keeping everything cooler.  Maybe I dreamt it lol
More research i fear.

Um the only reason he would have less range on the 12s3p is because it has less cells, meaning less watt hours. Watt hours are calculated by nominal voltage x ah.

@dareno Dude I hear ya I would never have paid $2k for that rebranded board. I bought mine direct on Alibaba for 1/4 of the cost before I knew anything about diy

How did you have to modify the baseplate to fit the TB 218mm hangar? You got my wheels spinning on this board again, I already have a set of 107's with pulleys fitted not on a board right now, and will have a spare set of focboxes once my escapes come to replace them on my current build, so might as well pick it back up :)

@SuperBen  Man, modify is too strong a term really lol 
they fit as is but the distance between the bushing bolt and the pivot stud on the tb hanger is shorter so i cut the tb pivot bushing and used it as a packer so the hanger couldn't move.  Takes five minutes. I also used all the tb bushings as they are just better quality 
If I was to use this deck again though (watch this space) I would just drop the tb base plates through as the footprint of them is narrower and would leave more board.

Whats ur current settings? 
 You can go upto 100 amp motor max, i run mine at 60 but even at that there more than enough... if you think you need more then bump yours upto 80amp..
And 40-45 amp batt max.. some guys run them higher..
Regen is upto you.. i run my dual setup at -30 amp
How do you go with speed wobbles at over 40km? I changed my rear bushings to a harder compound..

Thanks man I'll mess around with it and see how I go,  Speed wobbles were a problem at first but once I dialed it all in its fine now.  A bit on the tight side for me but stable.  The deck is super stiff and the whole thing is low down with drop throughs and that all helps.

Those are the stock motors it came with on mine. Honestly not sure if it's the speed controllers, the motors, or the 8ah pack, but I was getting pretty terrible range on them. Maybe 5 solid miles before voltage sag on the 6" tires, 10 miles on the street wheels. They were nice and torquey, had no problems chewing most hills especially compared to my hub motor board, but left a lot to be desired. I love my SK3's on my DIY though. If I end up swapping the trucks I think I'll see if I can fit two BKB 190kv's on a TB 218mm hangar. 

As for the remote, I liked the feel of it, and the integrated flashlight was handy, but I have GOT to change that throttle curve that board always wants to shoot out from under me. It's not bad once I was used to it but switching between boards the first couple throttle pulls still surprise me a bit. Honestly swapping to focboxes was probably the best upgrade you could have done to start with
