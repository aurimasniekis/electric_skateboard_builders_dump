Me either. Figured small wheels, small motors, small battery should make a nice little board.

have you ridden Purple orangatang kegels (non Harfang)? Interested to see how different they perform compared to regular Kegels 

And why 83A instead of 80A? 

Have you considered going 13S2P? Higher Voltage = Less amps = better on a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù pack. 

I too started with a small cruiser: Quinboards mini me. 13S1P Single Hub (Push assist is the goal thoug) 

Good luck on the building progress!

I haven't considered 13s as my 13s boards are rockets and this one is more so gonna be a slow cruiser for laziness

I want the 83a so I can have some low speed slide check fun between buildings, but also have a bit of traction if it has been raining. :)

I have a Jet spud with 12s2p battery and single 6355 that weighs 14lbs with the bindings and about 11lbs without. The 12s2p battery with 15mm wheel and motor pulleys on a 170kv 6355 motor give me about 8 mikes of range with hills and about 10 miles without. I weigh about 215lbs.![image|666x500](upload://z166q12NJNcURqJorVMDv7K5V7O.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://l9yKDSPSmQLD7fU7UHhLhMdHQRu.jpeg)

Sounds about right then as 5055s are a couple hundred grams lighter then 6355s, I won't be using bindings. And likely a smaller battery. :)

Bindings make a very convenient carrying handle and make jumping up curbs pretty easy.

In light of trying to think of a color scheme...and this board does not come with grip..

I already had TB180mm on hand...but I ordered a set of Caliber II 44 Blue trucks before I ordered this board - as I was going to steal the base plates for the Evo(as they're currently 50's). Which leaves me with a 

- black baseplate(from the Evo) 
- blue hangar
- purple kegels
- blue deck

Think I'll be getting some purple dress up washers for the enclosure.

And printing a purple potato decal to go under clear grip

Just gonna add this here since I've said it in other threads in the past.

If your looking for longboard gear that's hard to find... Sickboards normally always has it. This was my 11th order from them in the past couple years. I'm US based, and they ship UPS international. All my orders have come on the 2nd or 3rd day after ordering.

Anyway I ordered yesterday. Shipped out from Hague Netherlands... Already out for delivery this morning in NC USA ;). 

Sorry just had to rant about my favorite board shop haha..

So haven't gotten the kegels yet.

So threw the trucks and some 83 flywheel clones on to push around a bit and feel out the deck. It has the slightest amount of bite. I think with an 1/8" riser and the 80mm it'll be just fine, but we'll see


![received_10160085683810521|690x414](upload://psnzibf8o1EhqnezPKFamWHoAKi.jpeg)![received_10160085674070521|690x414](upload://wxsrknnoXOsl9TooR2x7oQHWWfS.jpeg)

Deck came with grip...I'll be swapping it for clear. 

Also need to start rebuilding this into a flat pack, retired modular vanguard battery.
![1521507327124982435735|375x500](upload://o655oMKZvfWMhrcHjWZz71Ty6Sa.jpg)

Also need to cut the calibers so I can fit the pulleys from LHB...

Did you set up FOC yet? I'm researching a bit about 200kv 10s FOC, since that's pretty much on the ERPM limit. Don't wanna fry my new focboxes...

No waiting on motors. But there is no ERPM in FOC.... Erpm is for bldc... @fraannk 

But I run 13s FOC 190kv on my Evo and it's fine. 
13s
54.6 * 190 * 7 = 72618

10s 
42 * 200 * 7 = 58800

why do you plan on removing sensors from those racerstar motors ?
Are they causing issues ?

```
No I just plan on skating in the rain with this and would rather remove the sensors or not connect them before hand to remove likelihood of shorts while riding. Sensors that are preinstalled in motors are hard to conformal coat as they are typically epoxied in so covering both sides for water sealant isn't easy.

I have 120k set on my focboxes on ack 3.100 firmware on the 13s Evo. But it doesn't do anything.

So tiny update

- my motors got lost in shipping, so waiting on a new set. 
- @Eboosted has his hands on the Jet Spud so likely we will be seeing an enclosure in the coming weeks/months

For now... I've been using this board as a short freeride deck with some 84a flashbacks laying around... It somehow magically has fancied my favor as one of my favorite decks, and I may have to pick up an actual spud to complete this build..  because its almost too good by itself. üòÇ

I will. I know your enclosure and I really like them. I just finished a spud build. My only concern is about the size. My enclosure is quite big compare to other I have seen. Dual vescs plus bms, heat sink, 10s3p take space. I hope it will be good for me.
