First, thanks to everyone on this forum and in the NYC Eboarding crew for all their help and support thus far.  I jumped on my first boosted board back in May (only 4-5 months ago) and loved it.  Same as many other builders, the ride was fantastic, but the range and speed left much to be desired.  I also picked up a Wowgo Mini for the sole purpose of having a cheap board to modify and play around with to see if I was comfortable taking something like this apart and "building".  The Wowgo mini is now a weird Frankenstein that sits on a 121c Aileron CF deck and Skullboard hubs.  It was a fun build, but nowhere near what has been required for this build.  However, it did give me some confidence to go ahead and start ordering parts for this build.

Note to all n00bz:  THIS SHIT GETS WAY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN YOU THINK.

I haven't yet generated a cost breakdown of this board, and will not do so until it's running satisfactorily and most of the kinks are worked out (this might be a while).

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

![01|374x500](upload://hZy8t2WvI8GbK9tPp3KNVt6HYW6.jpg)
![02|374x500](upload://1Fwvh16J8GtPS7a1CDzSUP83si9.jpg)
^ Boa wheels are like candy.  I was hoping for black but I've decided to highlight the red in this build.  Janux wheel pulleys -- I can now see why people want push in Kegel-style pulleys.

![03|375x500](upload://sa6BJHcxv1qnVdD30vchbD1VlNe.jpg)![04|375x500](upload://9ASY2uXkSUKnnfqmigpmRAF4c6W.jpg)
^ The shaft is too long (that's what she said) and there is not flat spot/keyway.  I bought a rotary tool just for this one job alone with hopes that I'll find use for it later.  The pulley cover is also shallow, so I decided to drill a hole so that the shaft can go through (hur hur hur).

![05|374x500](upload://zWK147tB3FoCrjTLSh5izeptKa.jpg)
^ Test fitting, aligning pulleys, testing mount alignment, etc.  The Janux mounts are thick but a little raw.  It was a pain in the ass to mount them due to the screw/nut angles.

![06|375x500](upload://6pc0kNzhHrmQDxxEnu2p4J4ZHi6.jpg)
^ Marked the location where the grub screw needs to bite.  Placed the motors plastic bags to suffocate and kill them.  Just kidding.  Saw that some folks were doing this to keep metal bits out of the motors.

![07|374x500](upload://8KETFoootibty7F1J7xtwHhJalS.jpg)
^ Not the best, but functional.  I probably should have worn a mask and eye protection, but YOLO or something like that.  I used a standard Dremel cutting disc and went nice and slow... was easier than anticipated and cut like butter.

![08|374x500](upload://bCQq8T5YhHXTq1T4qc5qxXCwKXb.jpg)
![09|666x500](upload://f8S08eaVaOd9UeE7Ol8aS2yWaTR.jpg)
^ Drilled a hole for the shaft to go through, ended up being pretty nice and flush.  You can see the idler pulleys and the alignment was finally right with both mounts.  I'm gonna have to work on the idler pulleys a little since it feels like they're increasing the level of resistance quite a bit.  Note: This shit is heavy as fuck.

![10|374x500](upload://tF6M0JpoDhHCfLxygp9lStj9A7x.jpg)
![11|374x500](upload://9L3lupFhxIYEhfPu0dPJ9gAt012.jpg)
^ This board is freaking massive with the Evolve trucks.  I'm note sure if I like the motors potruding that much from the deck but It might work out if I add AT wheels later on.  Grip tape design has yet to be decided, and I don't want to do that until the end so I don't tear up my hands and furniture during the build process.  Also, a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan is a terrible place for a workshop.

![12|375x500](upload://6TayqxZIycl52NHX1jEaQaGyFSO.jpg)
^ Chopped off the sensor plug from the Hobbysky motor as it wasn't the right pinout for the FOCBOX.  Bought a ton of JST pigtails and soldered the correct ones on both (didn't take pictures of the soldering).

![13|374x500](upload://y8sUjUTDEoHxHFGkrRs0csqbqh3.JPG)
^ Electronics mocked up.  This is gonna be a tight fit and I might have to do some wire chopping to squeeze all the wires in properly.  Decided to do CAN instead of split PPM so I can adjust with the METR.pro.  

https://streamable.com/5zeme
^ ITS ALIIIIIIVEEEEEEE


One thing I need to figure out is programming the FOCBOX.  Here is how I have it currently set:
**Motor max: 60**
**Motor min: -60**
**Battery max: 30**
**Battery min: -8**
**Absolute max: 130**

**Minimum input voltage: 8**
**Maximum input voltage: 57**
**Battery cutoff start: 36 (3 volts per cell)**
**Battery cutoff end: 33.6 (2.8 volts per cell)**

Any tips or red flags here please let me know so I don't a) die or b) die on fire or c) burn down my building.

Of course the Metr.pro as well as the Xmatic app allow for changing speed/riding profiles so I'd like to have a good grasp of what the settings mean.  More reading for me!!

I'm still waiting for threaded inserts to arrive then need to figure out weatherproofing, etc.  I have some industrial velcro and some hot glue ready to secure stuff down along with a lot of foam products.

Now to sleep for a bit.

Yeah looks like it.  I have a 1st gen Hummies deck (lol, I'm expecting @Hummie to have like 10 different models by next year) and the Psychotiller battery fits it nicely.  I didn't have to do any cutting or routing.

The challenge will be mounting the components and fitting all the wiring.

I'm also dreading trying threaded inserts but I gotta learn.

Yeah I was afraid of the mounting too. Good thing @psychotiller is awesome and agreed to mount and route it out for me too. Can’t beat that kind of service.
Okay cool just wondering what the options are for placing a battery in there as I can’t get a pacl from Dave as much as I’d want to cause shipping won’t allow it :sob:

I was actually referring to @skunk :laughing: but if i had to guess for you then about $1500 give or take $100?

Great first build man. really  good stuff.  The way you went about the process is spot on.  Get a prebuilt......get something else, change it, upgrade it then build what you now know you want.   Best way for people to get into building period.

^Inserts came in from Amazon.. these are just "ok".  Recommended drill hole diameter was 1/4", but that was too small and I lost the knife threads on one of the inserts.  In another one the bolt got stuck.  But I just needed 8 anyway.

![image|666x500](upload://gGSb5pDrqKJfc9bA8ZakGSqe9m1.jpeg)
^The painter's tape helped keep the deck from splitting/splintering too much.  It also helped keep me visualize where the enclosure was supposed to be when I drilled each hole.

![image|375x500](upload://jWgE3JpZV7eC962AaaGTPbdl1ro.jpeg)
^Used a Sharpie to mark the outlines of the enclosure.  Took a while since this was my first time.  I'm sure next time this will be much easier.

![image|375x500](upload://mxrUBAvzdTCKU9CZlES1qQtFkC9.jpeg)
^Red hardware just like everyone else.

![image|375x500](upload://94CIc8yN8II44TfrElbJJ5ugYnI.jpeg)
^Happy with the result.  Next time I might try to add wood glue or epoxy, but this seems like it's pretty decent.

![image|375x500](upload://3r4myGvkfF4TUrlzhvOIyrXeSzV.jpeg)
^Was gonna mount the components to the deck, however I got the wrong fucking velcro.  Ordering off Amazon and going to bed.


Ugh. So close.  Gotta reprogram the Focboxes (motor detection) since I keep disconnecting everything.  I better disconnect the CAN cable before I blow something up.

Initial ride.

Still trying to figure out what all this data means.

Also, I'm not used to trigger remotes and didn't modulate the brakes correctly going 19mph.  See that long pause above? Yeah I fell. Lol.

This board flies.  Like.... Scary.   What have I done?  What am I doing?  As I was falling I think I had a come to Jesus moment and I'm not even religious.

Still need some tweaking.  Might change remotes.  I'll post pictures tomorrow since I need to sleep.

^Velcro came in.  Stuck the coarse side and lined up most of the bottom of the deck.

 ![15|375x500](upload://c3RQUHeFm27uCW44A1QaXraov9X.jpeg)
^Lots of velcro at the bottom of the battery.  This sticks quite well.

 ![16|375x500](upload://cc5goXX6Rp4VmZsgzdJ7x707Ror.jpeg)
^Items fit.  Not as pretty as I'd like, but it work. Will add some foam on top as well as a foam gasket to weatherproof this.  Will also hot glue the components after I'm done with major testing and tinkering.

 ![17|375x500](upload://aAwKk8PEg85SZblUnFrbTXLL8sL.jpeg)
^Nice ass.  Added some nice square tail lights with built in accelerometers that turn solid red when I slow down or brake.  Rechargeable via USB.  Used some old Koowheel light brackets I had laying around, hopefully they don't break as they're cheap metal.

 ![18|375x500](upload://RtRx7EWoTk6khec4xG6DLaRehy.jpeg)

^the "nearly" finished look, gonna trim down the grip a bit.

 ![21|375x500](upload://f1DQru9rDKmDElZjm4x8G2ejqhn.jpeg)
^Size comparison to my Boosted V2 Dual+.  This board is massive.  I don't think this will be my daily driver.

 ![22|666x500](upload://mWCTuixm7p9AgZ46SU3qSPzsRvx.jpeg) 
^ Motor mounts "Sagging" down after a ride.  Disappointing.  They were torqued very well.  I did, however, use the stock evolve mounting screws that came with the trucks, so I'll try to change them to the ones sent by Janux and test again later.  Also debating removing one side of the idlers since it increases resistance.  Should I remove the top or bottom?

 ![20|375x500](upload://pLIsNzYkumQzCA7WAPn8pZ3a0F2.jpeg)
^Changed out the bolts on the Janux Evolve Mounts to the ones included in the kit (not the stock evolve screws).  Hopefully this solves the problem where the mounts sag down after a ride.

Buying another one locally this week, but I have to open up the board and plug it in or unplug the xt60's to turn it on and off at the moment.

Mounts continue to sag, possibly due to torque and/or vibrations.

Added blue loctite and jammed some Sugru as a secondary level of prevention.  Torqued the shit out of the bolts this time, will test when the weather clears.

A longer distance ride.  Some notes:

* Was a dual idler setup, removed top idler on each side and left slack side single idlers in place.  Now there is much less rolling resistance and it's also reflected in my efficiency.  I think I like a looser setup.
* Mounts finally stayed in place this ride after adding loctite and torquing the shit out of them as well as the sugru plugs as seen in the previous post.
* Alien remote is okay, but I only have Boosted and Wowgo/Skullboard/Ownboard thumbwheels to compare to.  Feels good in hand but still getting used to using a trigger.  So far no cutouts.
* Thanks to all the info on this forum I don't have any faults or major issues with the build.  Amazing.  I'm sure there will be issues that will pop up but it would be so much worse without all this info.
* Battery range as expected.  Par for course, I now want a 12s5p.
* Evolve trucks are nice and carvy, even more so than my boosted board.  So far not much speed wobble at 29-30mph but I'm not used to those speeds period.  I had no idea that the diff between 24mph to 30mph would be so drastic.
* The feeling of "omg I built this" finally set in as I carved through NYC traffic.
* If you're on the fence about buying a bluetooth or Metr module, it's totally worth it.
* If you want to use your Metr module with Xmatic (iOS), make sure you change the VESC settings under UART to 9600 baud.
* 100mm Boa's are nice.  Like really nice.
* @Kug3lis noticed that my ESC temp climbed a little, so when warmer weather rolls back around I may need to look at heatsinking or other methods of cooling.

Amazing board, almost what mine will hopefully look like soon, and the efficiency is also great, running belts as loose as possible makes a lot of difference 
The temperature looks fine for now, but as you get used to it you will run harder and harder

If the mounts continue to move you can try to apply bearing retaining fluid between the surfaces, not on the screws, continue to use thread lock on them and it’s a must to let everything dry at least 24h before riding

I seriously considered dropping some loctite green between the mount and evolve trucks, but I'll see how this holds up for now.

I'd rather not have to torch my trucks to remove my mounts, lol.

About 75 miles on them so far with no issues.  When I ordered them on Amazon I messaged the seller to customize then with 8mm shafts.  You can also request custom Kv.  So far so good, but I'm worried that I'll encounter the same issues others have been dealing with loose magnets.  Time will tell.

I paid about $90 for each though.

Remove bottom idlers. I have near exact same set up. Same wheels, trucks, mounts, deck. Great taste in esk8 bits. 👍

This way you will loose idler tension benefit only on hard acceleration. This is preferable to loosing tension under hard breaking. Right? For those oh shit moments when you really really really need to slow down, the top idler helps prevent pulleys from skipping teeth in these circumstances.
