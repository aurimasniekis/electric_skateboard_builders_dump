Hi everybody,

I'll document my upcoming build here as soon as the deck (MOV-E by @LukePL)  arrives.

Some specs:

Name: Green Star
(I know, not really creative but it follows my previous build "Red Star" https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/building-stealthy-eskateboards-from-regular-skateboard-decks-n-e-s-e-cf-integrated-enclosure-different-hub-motors/59906/70?u=visnu777)
Deck: @LukePL MOV-E without kicktail
Motors: @Hummie Hubs V4 
Battery: 12s3p VTC6 in 6x slighty modified (1mm less height) 2s3p N.E.S.E. modules
ESC: 2xFOCBOX
I'll put both of them plus the arduino for the Firefly plus whatever will fit in a custom NESE-Style (but different) case. This case will dock onto two nese bus connectors placed on plus and minus and will be locked from the inside with screws. With that I can swap whole batterys in a minute ;)

Before assembly I'll add a carbon fiber layer on the lower (street) side mostly for decoration, Luke used a car to test the strength so it should be fine without but I like the looks ;) 

I'll add some pictures when the upload works again :slight_smile: and edit other stuff so don't be surprised when this first post will change over time ;)

Michael

Lets see how it turns out :) I think its too sophisticated for a Hulk :D Currently I'm thinking of a heatpipe for the Focboxes leading the heat to the outside without cutting too much of the board ;)

Thats a great one, mine will contain a wild mixture of greens. It will be hard to balance them out but I'm optimistic :D

Btw, I already ordered a 20cm heatpipe :D Not sure if it will work but its worth a try.

You are building almost the exact same build as me! Looking forward to watching you finish this one!
I can't wait for my MOV-E deck to arrive @LukePL! :smiley:

Very excited about how this one will turn out.
@visnu777 Which wheels for your front truck are these? It looks like the match perfectly to the size of Hummies hubs.

These come bundled together, Abec11 centrax. I just dyed them darker (wanted black but it didn't work out that well this time. It's still green which actually made me choose green for the base color of the build this time üòè)

Sehr geil...It is indispensable for me to have all samme diameter at all 4 wheels. That is the only thing at the moment i don't like and don't understand about the R2. Even the boards that wins the R2 contest has different wheel size in the front. I just don't get it, but its just me :wink:
Very good that Hummie does it the right way.

![IMG_20190327_191850|690x426](upload://mWkk2w945QHAGf5taKxoDgpp96H.jpeg)
These arrived today :) I'll use the QS-8 for connecting a battery expansion pack (also 12s3p) to double the range when I want to. I will put two XT90 males in the MOV-E for the antispark plug, one connects the integrated battery and the other the expansion. I just have to put the XT90s into the corresponding port to switch :)

@banjaxxed I hope Enertion won't sue me :D
@LukePL Jap, I'll put it in the middle like the usual MTB case when needed :)![IMG_20190327_192822|666x500](upload://3bNVtLqW9q13MNylDVxGR0vkc5R.jpeg)

I use the qs8 to prevent accidental mixup with the antispark which is unlikely to happen but you never know üòé
The heatpipe is overkill but I like overkill üòÅ  I'll try to use the front truck as outer heatsink because of the missing ventilation. I went fine without till now but I want to stress test the hummie with 12s6p (both packs in parallel at the exact same voltage) ü§£
