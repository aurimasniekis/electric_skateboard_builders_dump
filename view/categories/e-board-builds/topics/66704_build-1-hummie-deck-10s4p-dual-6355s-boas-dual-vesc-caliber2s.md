So I've been lurking here for around 6 months and am finally going to get a build started over winter ready for next year (and hopefully a bit of sun!).  I don't have the biggest budget so will be sticking with single motor for now.  Deck is to be decided, possibly will be making my own as I have a friend who is a decent woodworker.  I have a 10s4p 25r pack with charge only BMS waiting to be built.

This is what I am thinking of so far (Updated with what I have!)

Really? That's a shame. The pavements etc around where I live are not the smoothest hence me wanting a bigger wheel. Suppose I could do the flywheel thing but they are rather expensive ü§î

If you want rough stuff wheels then try the mbs option.  As far as I know that and slick is it for semi urethane.   Could go trampa gummies but shit pricey as 
As for motors I like to build in some space.  Go for something that rates higher than  10s and it‚Äôs not going to be running at its max the whole time.  Sk3 work if you‚Äôre on a budget.  Sk8 if you want sensored. The VESC is cool. I have 4. Seem to be strong so far. There are better products out there but I haven‚Äôt had any issues with them yet so for the money all good.  
Make sure you post the pictures.  We love pictures.

So things have changed a little ;)

I should have a hummie deck on the way with a single stack enclosure.  Got a Sk3 motor coming also and have almost decided to go dual motor from the off so will probably end up getting another.

I'm still totally stuck on what wheels to get though, i'm running so many ideas round in my head right now I'm confusing myself.  I don't need atb type wheels however the roads/pavements around where I live are not the best.  I'm open to suggestions that will run on caliber 2 trucks (these are bought).

Don‚Äôt forget to have slightly flexible battery for the hummie deck.
I have a used set of mbs wheels if you‚Äôre in a budget. 
Not bad for a large wheel. Abecs are king or pneumatics even better.

I'm not sure on the pneumatic thing if I'm honest, quite pricey for decent ones plus I'm not sure I like the look.  Those boa's look the part - anyone actually ridden on them?

theres a thread somewhere where alot of high rep riders (@b264, @longhairedboy, etc) who have ridden them / are riding them and the general answer is that theyre quality and have outstanding grip

Yeah I did; they are great wheels.  100mm is too small for me, though

I think, realistically and within a sensible budget (lol), 100mm is probably the biggest I will get no?

Pack in process, rewrapped all the cells as they came from different manufacturers so the different colours triggered me a bit lol.

She's not wrong, be careful.

Did you check these cells before you popped them together? All the same spec?

Ordered a set of Boa's for wheels, reasonable price and sickboards had them so I wont have to wait. 

Just need to decide on pulleys now, will be 40t with 190ish kv motors but do i go with press fit ones or bolt on?  I've got stock caliber 2 trucks so I'm guessing bolt on as I dont like the idea of turning the nuts around that the press fits seem to need.

Bolt on would likely be these

Any advice on belt width?  I'll be using idlers on the belt with dickyho mounts.

I'm tempted but I think I'll have to remove some material from the trucks to get them on.  They do look rather nice though :slight_smile:

Any thoughts on the SK8 motors?

you have normal 10 inch caliber, those motors will not fit, i had to push out with spacers to get my 6355 motors onto the axle. you could get yourself some eskate Caliber, they are basicly the same but have 47mm axle shafts instead of 37mm.

So got some motors off @bigben which will be perfect however the @dickyho mounts I've got are gonna be too short and he's no stock of the long ones üòë

Seems I have 3 choices at the moment.

Move the trucks under
Modify the mounts (either remove some material on the top, where one of the idler mounts or get a bit of flat bar welded in to extend them) 
Wait out for longer mounts

Got a friend with a TIG so he's gonna try and add 20mm to the length. Alot depends on how good the aluminum (or chineseium!) is I guess :)

Dickyho got his mounts back in stock so I've ordered some longer ones, might have a go at extending what I have but I'm not sure how well Chinese aluminium will take the welding.

Got the board running the motors at least though on a 12v power supply for now just to get it set up. Configured my dual flipsky vesc with @Ackmaniac firmware and all seems OK on the bench. Next job is to wire in the BT module, mount the power switch from the @Martinsp anti spark and then find a way of securing everything in there. I've got some high density foam that I'm gonna pad the battery a bit with and I'll probably print some sort of equipment sled to fix the rest of the kit too.

Minor progress as I've been on a run of night shifts.

Something is a bit odd with that flipsky dual 4.2 aside from the usual problems. One side will not run bldc in sensored mode. Detects OK but the motor instantly cogs up when you try and run it and hits abs max. Other side is fine. I've swapped the motors around and it seems to be one side of the controller causing it. Been careful to not have can active when doing the motor config and have done so on both sides. 

The biggest odd thing is it will run foc sensored OK so I guess that's what I'll go with. 

Longer mounts arrive from @dickyho üëç so I can make a bit more progress. Think I'm going to wait for my diebms before I do a final put together though.
