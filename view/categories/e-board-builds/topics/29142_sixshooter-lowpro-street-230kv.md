@psychotiller genius to use wedges on top w drop-through mounting!

It took a little trimming of the drop thru holes, but it's pretty nice!!! I hated the squishy, reboundless turn in of those 218 trucks, ultimately that's what the wedges fixed. The back is 42¬∞ now and the front 47¬∞.  This is going to be a fast, fun, low, stable street board.

So, tell us about your test ride! @DaviDjembe  I know with less than a mm of clearance everywhere it had you thinking about wheelbite haha! But being that it didn't have any issues with said wheelbite what did you think?

@psychotiller dude, I was a little skeptical when I stood in the board and saw that the pneumie wheels almost touch the deck when you lean hard :sweat_smile: but it was an optical illusion and there never was any wheelbite even when I  carved hard and tried to get it to bite. My overall impressions were great... If you couldn't tell in the video I was having a lot of fun ripping psycho's new board!!  The pneumatic boards that I have ridden are an evolve Gen2 (single motor in the back) and the newer Evolve Carbon GT. In comparison to those 2 boards, Psychotiller's wheels had virtually NO "wobble". That's a thing that I've experienced with a lot of pneumatic boards. Psychotiller did a good job of balancing everything so you didn't feel all wobbly at higher speeds. Another comment about this board is how great the acceleration curve is. This thing accelerates smooth and gets going fast. That's my main gripe about the Evolve board is the acceleration is very jerky and not smooth. After this riding experience I am sold on @psychotiller hubs and tires. I'm waiting patiently to get Carvon's V4 motors that are being developed for pneumatic tires. Thank you, Dave for letting me rip your new baby!! I was impressed to say the least ü§ò

I'm not really sure. At the moment I only have one belt so I just edited @Maxid's file a little bit to work with that I have (props to him and @psychotiller for the massive contributions to our community). Although now that I think about it...

Yea I'm gonna need some more safety gear. Also not planning to max out on 3d-printed hubs...

My driveway is the biggest incline I usually ride on... mostly flats, but crappy roads. I don't need much torque either (145lbs). I do plan to print a larger gear later though, so I can join in comfortably on group rides in San Francisco

You could use a lower teeth motor pulley - 16t is quite high for a pneumatic setup - there are plenty of 14t or even 12t pulleys out there for cheap

True.. but for some reason taking a shit in the back of a bus at any speed isn't really fun.

Do you guys hit busses all the time when you go fast? I don't.

I did overshoot a 40' tabletop (snowboarding) one time and pancake on the other side of the landing. When I hit the ground it made me shit a little.

No..  was just chiming in with something completely unrelated except for speed. Just a silly rhetorical statement..that taking a shit at any speed other then still is not pleasant. Busses and planes are even worse.


PS I mean literal shit.  Not eating shit/going down/crashing

agreed.   Though its all relative, sidewalk or racetrack., its about as fas as t I feel the need to go..:)  maybe even too much.      I was just saying if someone's feeling wobbly on an evolve, somethings not right...  How fast are your boards getting up to?? curios...
