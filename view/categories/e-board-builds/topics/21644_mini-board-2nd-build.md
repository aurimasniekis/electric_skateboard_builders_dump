Yeah i was expecting the motor mount to be here by now but every thing else has arrived. I have changed up a few things though I put the trucks from another build on it (8s) and i was flying and was to scared to go full speed on such a short board so i downgraded to a 6s because i did not want to kill my self and because of simpler charging with only one port.

This is quite odd he has not been on the forum for 6days

Yeah... I emailed him today asking about inactivity. I doubt he skipped town because he actually designed this mount and showed pics from the manufacturer. Life probably got in the way.
