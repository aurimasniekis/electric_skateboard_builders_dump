Started ordering the goods already but need some guidance.

Blank board -ordered
218mm torque trucks and motor mount
90mm 78a Wheels-ordered
Still deciding on a 3D printed enclosure from someone on here.
15/36 gearing (not set in stone)
Focbox 
Undecided on remote benchwheel or mini
12s2p battery pack Miami w/on off switch 
6374 190kv

My question is what KV would be optimal cause I know there is concern with the rpm's with that big of a battery?
