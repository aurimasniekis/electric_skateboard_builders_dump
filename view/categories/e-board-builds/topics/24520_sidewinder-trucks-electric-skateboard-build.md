I have a very similar Sector 9 deck and trucks. Lovely ride. Not motorised it yet though.
Interested to see how you get on. How are you going to mount to the trucks as the mount you have is for calibers? 
I think I found I was going to have to change the trucks from drop through to regular to get the clearance for my mounts.

If I'm not mistaken, you probably paid a lot more for the remote controller.

Let me know if those DIY mounts don't work out on your sidewinders. My ripba mounts fit with about 2 seconds of filing.

I don't want to steal any thunder from your build, but it's not the world's first sidewinder eskate. Evolve uses sidewinder clones and @mccloed set up a set of sidewinders with my ripba mounts a couple of months ago. Keepin' it real :grin:

@psychotiller mounts are great...you should buy some...i was going to do the gull wing mod he told me about but ended up going with GT trux for the extra wide track and moded some TB mounts to fit....<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/1/3102a73a79cc1d7f8be011e243c35a0737140a4d.jpg" width="666" height="500">

How did you go about modding the torque board mount to the truck?  How extensive was the modding process?
