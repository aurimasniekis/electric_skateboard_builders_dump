I don't even know where to start. So many mods still have to happen here. For now though, rest assured that my customer will be on a theoretical 65mph board shaped like an ancient electro-mystical mega-power-sword that would traditionally be used to defend the galaxy by an ancient and powerful giant robot. 

Looks like i'm building the fastest skateboards in the world again.And they're shaped like swords bitches! I'll let that soak in while i get the party poppin' in the shop an bitches panties droppin cuz i aint stoppin i'm weavin and bobbin like a hob goblin slobbin a knobbin what?

Cool to see you working with NGV hardware. They've been posting teasers about their "Nextboards" on FB but have been pretty vague with the specs

they probably haven't settled on a pack size/chemistry yet. The rail they sent me was only big enough to hold maybe two 2.5ah, maybe 5ah 6S lipos. That's not a lot of watt hours for a next generation vehicle.  This deck pictured here looks like it was designed around the same concepts but could hold much more lithium. I'm having to do something similar by combining aspects of their mounting/cooling system in with my own enclosure system. The end result i'm sure will be reminiscent of engines poking out of hoods while thier polished end result will likely look like an over budget government bomber project. 

That's what i love about esk8 building. So many takes on speed and riding in general.

I don't care about all the electrical part : your custom made deck stole the show. Sick as hell ! 

Since @onepunchboard got me inspired on weird deck ideas I've been preparing stupid stuff but it will look cool. And have kicktails, because tails are cool.

over the course of the week i'm going to try and find exact specs on everything. I'm not even sure what the KV is on the motors. Basicaly my customer was in touch with Tone over there at NGV and sent me everything, my contact with them was minimal, but i do have info on this stuff in an email buried deep in the bowels of gmail. 

The motors won't spin up from a dead stop, so no launching from a stand still. Startup torque? basically zero if you look at it that way.  The ESCs won't even kick them in until you're moving at around 1.5mph. You have to push start it. I was able to get them spinning on the bench by just twisting the wheels with the throttle down. 

This is a very interesting build to say the least. i'll be working on it more this week so i'll post some pics as i get to different stages.

## \#14 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2017-10-04T12:38:21.029Z Reads: 409

```
i got the specs from Tone:

* motors are 180kv, 24 stators, 28 magnets on rotor.
* They are specially build for NGV, they are sensored, but in high speed setups they don't use sensors, so the sensor leads can be cut off. Fascinating, but .. its hard to bring myself to cut them. Maybe i'll bundle them instead. 
* The controllers are programmed so, that motors will not start until the deck is pushed to 1.5mph. That's for safety reasons. I assume at 180KV they could get stuttery and unpredictable from an unsensored standstill. 
* Esc's are 12S 100A with their own firmware. They are not VESC based. They look closer to what i've seen in things like Evolves and other boards with other ESCs. Except for the giant aluminum block heat sink that bolts to your truck. 
* Wheels are specially made for us, hardness is 80 shore A
* remote is from Maytech - a basic one. the same I'm going to be using moving forward. They're more ergonomic and pocket friendly than the Steeze and they look less like a sex toy, and have a more user friendly layout. 
* Trucks: we can mount our drive on any available trucks on the market. The customer chose Bear trucks.
"We like Liquid fyre - but we cannot get them, Chris Chaput is so busy man." lol

Lol...Liquid Fyres are awesome but your customer has a point...it's a 3+ month wait to get the Fyres. His team is busy pushing out trucks for Jerry at CARVon.

This build is going to be interesting, to say the least.
Maybe make a video when you are doing test runs :smiley:? When the build is finished, of course!

It looks to me like the trucks were machined a little, so i have to asume they mean any trucks can be machined to fit, which seems obvious now that i think about it.

oh man.. oh man oh man oh man....

this weekend wasn't kind to NGV. 

So this board came back for some mods, some of which are to eliminate the eswitches and make the twin 6S 10ah Tatuu cells removable for standard charging to eliminate the BMS. At some point, the pack i made from the other tatuu prismatics had failed, so i bought some more and we decided not to unpack them and instead make them removable. I cut a pretty sweet hole in the box and had the removable cells all figured out when i went to address the other problem. He mentioned that one of the motors was't spinning up. I figured a cable came loose of a finicky wire or solder joint, so i didn't check on it until last. 

It turns out the phase leads shorted inside the motor assembly somewhere. The shitty pvc insulation they use on every motor out there was used here too, and at a very thin guage, probably 14 or higher, and its winding wire all the way out which is a damned fool move for a "performance board". 

Because i was a fool and figured they knew what they were doing, i folded up the phase leads inside the wire bundle before slipping on the nylon sheathing. The insulation melted all the wires together, burned the copper into a short, and melted the nylon to the copper. I suppose that the safest way to use these motors is to allow the shitty wires to breath by letting them just all hang out somewhere ready to snag something and rip off. 

also that antispark plug they're using on the Nextboard instead of a solid state relay or whatever? it blew up. After sparking every goddamned time i plugged it in. They went on and on about how eswitches blow up. They do on occasion, which is why i keep shit under 60 amps and under 45mph.  But this is hilarious. Fastest skateboard you can buy, huh?

looks like i still have that title if they can't sell any without them blowing up and getting recalled or killing somebody when their motors short out at 50mph or whatever. 

Anyone else want to send me their drive systems for my customers to test? 

before anyone demands pics, i have plenty. I'm just going to show the damning evidence to the parties involved before i post it here and ruin all of the Nextbard's hopes and dreams.

I forgot to mention that this happened to three of their motors, only one is spinning up correctly. 

also he never got to 65mph on this thing, he was still working his way up when we decided to do these mods. Last i heard he got up past forty somewhere and apparently that was enough to melt phase leads. Lots of people do more than 40 around here, myself included, on a semi-regular basis and this doesn't happen to us. 

High strand count silicone wire, people. If you see a board without it and it clams to be a speed demon,  then it is only full of terrible lies. Lies to children even, and those are the worst kind.

Most of my boards come back now and then for a tweak or two. They're basically cars and need attention now and then. 

But this thing... I hope NGV does the right thing here. I just finished up an email write up to everyone with a full report of what happened. All we need are new motors and an antispark plug and we're good i think.

i just spent $105 sending 13 pounds of components back to Slovenia. 

Remember these things when somebody vaguely suggests they may have possibly one day had a bad customer service experience with me once. 

it was suggested that the current buildup necessary to melt the wires could have come from hard braking at speed, which to me is quite fascinating. That probably wouldn't' have occurred to me.

The 45mph speed run at SPD1 had just over 200m ( 650') total to get up to speed and shut it down. I was hard on the brakes when a motor melted. There are considerations with motor braking we need to improve on..🏁

Dear longhairedboy... you stated a lot of facts here that are not accurate and influenced from your point of view that I'll not interfere with. But I have to clarify some things for all the guys that follow this post..
We sent you the motors, wheels, trucks and esc's, all connected with wiring harness and mounted on a aluminium rail which could also hold two Tattu 6S 9000mAh Lipo batteries. The exactly the same setup was used when setting the World speed record here in Portoroz, Slovenia. We are using exactly the same setups for three years now and we never had a problem. But you dismantled everything and connected components back in your swordboard together with lights, switches and other funny stuff. No problem, if everything is done correctly.. but it seems that it was not as all other our boards are working fine, only swordboard is not.. I'll wait until components are back here in Slovenia, then I'll try to find out what went wrong and post here what I'll find out. You also mentioned the anti spark connector we are using: it is a 7mm gold plated connector that is used in drones worth 5000USD and more. We have plenty of them, installed everywhere and all of them are working fine, still after 3 years of usage! Another thing is phase cables insulation: as you should know, electric motors are wound with copper wire insulated only with thin polymer film insulation - so the pvc insulation that phase cables are covered when exiting motor internals is just add on - but not if damaged of course!
Our board is still World's fastest, nobody broke our record for more than two years, but you must have some feeling to cooperate with her with pleasure - it's just like a Ferrari and you should  be aware of!

Hey NGV. 59mph is only cool if the wheels stay on and the rider doesn't street face. Guinness Book should be ashamed for having such low low standards for excellence. You should take your 60mph board and do it for real instead of bragging about your failed attempt over the last two years.

Does it explicitly say it has to be flat, if it is all the same may mock up a wannabe build and thrown down on the next downhill event, maybe I can break it. 

Next one has a 22% drop, enough for any resistance to reach that speed. :)

You can dream of it like a Ferrari, but it's not a Ferrari. I respect your dedication to getting things right, but your components are in a metal tube... Even beginners on this forum build better looking boards...

Power wise, curious how many watts you pull at high speed. But also, please try the board at high speed with someone who weighs more than 120 lb. I think at least 1/3rd of the male population that weights between 185-210 lb and at least 1/10th of males are heavier than that. 120 lb rider is not a very high standard of testing in my book.

Also, Ferraris are actually fast accelerating cars. i don't think I need to say anything about how fast NGV boards accelerate...

Also, why would you have the motor wire coming out of your motors? Your asking for problems... Terminate it inside and use motor winding epoxy to set everything in place...

Setting a Guinness Book of Records is just a matter of adhering to the stipulation of two prior runs both certified beating the current record. These need to be signed and documented runs certified with video by an attending member of authority.. a police officer etc. Once this has been done you can then follow the links on the GBWR site for the attendance of an GBWR official to attend and certify the new record. 
The guy that still holds the record actually also holds the official WR for the fastest downhill long boarding speed as well. 
The fact the record still stands says something in itself.
The speed and acceleration I get from my Nextboard is beyond comprehension and couldn't be happier.
Happy riding guys and be safe 👍

Great, just give 10,000 of funding and I'll break the current world record. Could probably even get to 100mph if I wanted to. That doesn't mean it would make a good board, or a reliable board. Land Speed record vehicles typically are not marketed for sale for this exact reason, they're only designed with the consideration in mind that they'll last for 2 or maybe 3 runs.

I just don't think touting a board as the "world record board" should be a major selling point

Did you ever try to brake hard on e board from let say 30mph? It's much more difficult to learn how to break then any other discipline.. We used to have brakes enabled on all 4 wheels, but then decided to enable brakes only on rear two wheels because braking power on all 4 wheels was too strong..

yes I have I 'get it' that is the reason I asked I've blown up a 'china ESC' turning too hard while too breaking hard down hill over 25mph (with dual hubs).

I own a bajaboard, my plan was always: NGV for street and Baja for offroad - and the 2+ years I've used eboards I feel confident breaking at 35 on my bajaboard (sensor-ed with 4x belts) but I don't think I would feel so confident with 2 hubs at 60mph 

P.S. if ngv price included battery you would already have my pre-order

Moe's board is more powerful than the NGV, you'all watch!
There are bigger motors NGV could have used with longer stators, why they did not use them I do not know.

On one hand you have a world class downhill skater, the other a can do dude with engineering smarts who loves the rush of competing and the thrill of pushing himself. He only started in this discipline a year ago... Standing up on his board catching all that air on his chest he is a few mph from the record and his board is still pulling away...
Once he gets it dialed in for that sort of speed with the help of people like Brad (riptide) with bushings he will blow past the prior record.
I know the specs of the scorpion motors and esc's NGV are using I have scorpion kit on one of my decks. I know what kit Moe is using, he has more power and more adjust-ability + is more reliable ;)

Hell sign me up, i'd buy one!

Great that you learn how to brake! Not great that you fried the ESC. But this is only about firmware flashed in ESC. Our firmware is tailored made for our motors and ESC and wheel size, so when everything is ok (and braking from steep hill definitely is) there should be no issues. About batteries in our board: we cannot post these batteries - or the postage would be enormous. We contacted Fedex, Dhl UPS and many others but nobody wanted to transport those batteries. But you could buy let say these: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-5s1p-30c-xt90.html

on Hobby king - they are not the best batteries, but are cheap  and will fit perfectly in our board. You can get 90-100km/h on those batteries!

@ngv-nextboards

1) i built what the customer wanted, regardless of how silly you think it is. 

2) Please don't blame things that have nothing to do with it. Phase leads melting together have nothing to do with underlights or the shape of the deck or the material the box is made out of, and i'm perfectly willing to accept that the antispark plug was simply defective, just as i was willing to accept that repacking tatuu cells was a bad idea and have reverted to the original idea of removable packs installed in series. Also, yes, the eswitches i used in parrallel was also somethign that didn't work out but i had to try it anyway. The box has nothing to do with it. 

3) thank you for being kind enough to work with us on this.

Here is my thought process. I've got a "NGV world record setting" board. Guinness hands me the title but all I have to show for it is a disaster video that's been seen 1m times. Me, if I fixed the problem and wanted to sell my product as a reputable 60+mph vessel I would hope to have some documentation to prove my claims. 2 years of no failures of doing what. No speed testing, no high speed brake testing nothing from NGV. Brother if this was my product I would be transparent as hell when I went to market with this. A successful 0 to 60 to 0 video at the very least. Two years of 0 failures from NGV I believe. You guys never ran it up after your boy street faced..

Believe it. I am a fan of what NGV is doing.  The idea of marketing their setup as a raceboard is a fantastic nich.  The problem is what NGV's expectations are from their customers. I think it's reckless to take to market a product and expect their representatives (customers) to do their real world testing for them. I can only hope that NGV steps up, proves their system and properly documents it. Not just for customer confidence but for Esk8 racing in general. Honestly I am hopeful they make good on their motor failure, own it and make it better.

Too many things have happened this last year to think it's a good idea to bring 60mph boards to the public. There are only a handful of guys in our community that can or should be going that fast. And I sure as hell hope that the boards they choose to reach those speeds can handle it. 0-60-0 or it has never happened.

Did you ever try to brake hard on e board from let say 30mph? It’s much more difficult to learn how to break then any other discipline… We used to have brakes enabled on all 4 wheels, but then decided to enable brakes only on rear two wheels because braking power on all 4 wheels was too strong…

i was just typing that same sentiment. 

I honestly don't think the general public is ready to break the esk8 light barrier (60mph) when most people can't handle past 40 (mach barrier), and most boards, DIY included, can't maintain 40mph speeds on a regular basis without regular checkups and occasionally blowing parts. 

in 2016 a film group from Holland came over and i told them and the world that i built the most powerful boards you can buy. At the time is was unquestionably true. At the moment, that's still mostly true. Noone else is selling 40mph boards, or boards that can take a 300 pound man damn near 40mph, and selling them with a warranty and whatever you want painted on the deck. 

On one hand i don't want to lose that title, but on the other hand, i don't want to focus on ludicrous speeds when 90% of my customers just want to go somewhere north of 30mph on occasion when they feel frisky and the rest of the time want to cruise casual or just get to work on time. 

Instead of pursuing the warp barrier, i decided to harden my approach to the mach barrier which is, quite frankly, just as challenging yet far more practical. 

You see, at the moment, a 40mph board can actually take you to work reliably, plug in a wall to charge easily, not melt the eswitches, start from a standstill, look amazing, be weather tight and be relatively low maintenance for a skateboard. 

60mph boards cannot accomplish any of that and belong only on the track or salt flats, which would reduce my customer base by a factor of 10. I actually have to sell working boards to stay in business because i have zero investors, zero venture capital, have done zero fundraising, and do not have a silent money partner. It's all me and all my credit card debt which is beginning to drop because i'm actually starting to pay for more than just my re-ups and labor costs. Thank you evolve mods. 

All of that being said, I want NGV to succeed. I want the Nextboard to be a good steward of the next big speed target.

But last year we went to California and do an uphill run at Mesa Grande with Louis Pilloni from Sector9. Did you see this video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EgbZITYVRE

dont know how the brakes work really but regardless of if it's 4 or 2 wheels doign the braking the energy from the momentum has to go somewhere.  if all the energy being created into electricity  when braking happens through 2 or 4 motors and esc...I'd think distributing it over more would be safer.    Do they use a resistor or something to dissipate the energy from braking or what?
and I like front wheel braking as sometimes I'll slide on a downhill if it's rear

I agree with you, longhairedboy! Customer satisfaction is our first goal , and we will do everything we can, to make your customer happy again. But it is mandatory for us, to find out why this happened. Melted phase cables is effect and not cause of the problem. And of course we will work with you on this - your customer is also our customer - we will repair the e-drive, no problem, but we must prevent that such a failure happens again!

i suppose i was referring to the choice between melting a couple of motors vs over-charging the battery as a good choice. But now that i'm thinking about it... maybe it would be better if the battery overcharged... at least the wheels wouldn't have a risk of locking up... the heat build up would likely blow some traces since if you used a heavier silicone phase lead it could transmit and sink more heat from the motor, and you could also sink more heat from the motors by htermally coupling them to the truck hanger... shit enertion has fins in thier truck hangers.

i don't know man... it's really a game of pick your favorite failure at this point.

i'd actually like to see a resistor sunk into the hanger to dump the braking current to, anything over 10 amps gets shunted over and dissipated as heat. Say we did that, what negative side effects could be expected aside from cooking bugs?

its a side topic but can someone quickly explain how the vesc or other escs get rid of all the energy when braking?  the vesc will get maybe 40% regen so where's the rest of the energy going other than the battery?  that's a lot of energy.

Amen. 
Do 60mp//h on a normal gravity set up.
Realise how much windforce you have to account for and counter. 

Then starts the fun part, can you stop at 60? Can you controle your line?  Do you have savety precautions (walkies with people spotting the street).

60Mph is no joke. Rarely you get the opportuity and the state of mind to do it, in my case anyway.

I mean this is a little over 50 and not many I know enjoy or even dare that speed. 

So building 60mp/h boards sure if you got leathers, full face and years of propper downhill experience.

The breaking in e-boards is regenerative breaking, basically you are charging battery - so breaking harder means transfering more energi to the battery. How much energy is regenerated is controlled by PWM on esc.
The problem that we noticed was that small movement of brake trigger on remote actually engaged the brakes too much, they were very difficult to control, so we decided to only brake on rear wheels..

Hope to see Jeremy Bowers get track racing started in Australia as we hope to see grow here in the US. NGV you should really consider sending @michichopf a demo board for you guys in Europe. Not only is he capable, he is well respected both in the DH ranks and the E-sk8 community. His group has the safety gear and awareness to properly qualify your board as well as give solid feedback which is more valuable than any engineering team. Sorry  @michichopf  if I have overstepped but that is what Regionally makes the most sense for NGV.

Sweet leathers. Does it have integrated hardshell protectors? Otherwise use some g-form underneath. Fell hard with my leathers years ago, hurt like a bitch since the little foam in there did nothing (black and blue all over) Since then hardshell knee caps, hips and propper backprotector for me.

Ps: I really hope you have plenty of experience on a board, doesn't matter how anyone feels about anyone. The last thing that should happen is for another rider to get seriously hurt.

Thanks man !
Really appreciate the positive response and advice.
Kelcey did an amazing job on the leathers and couldn't be happier. I will take your advice with the foam as there is no hard shell, I did ask to drop it as I wanted more flexibility etc but she did reinforce the back, hip and knees with extra foam and double breasted the leather with kevlar lining. 
I've had a few falls over the years as I only compete against myself, that way I ride within my ability. I think when you challenge other peoples best is when you step outside of the comfort zone and open yourself up to fault. 
I am using some Astar ankle nipper boots for feet protection but still deciding on hand protection. Obviously want a clean connection to the remote and was wondering if the downhill gloves would be to restrictive, but like the idea of pucks if a change of direction is required in a slide.

I skated since 13 , followed by big wave surfing, motorcycle racing taught me how to fall. 15 years ago I was doing the same speed I am chasing here except I would tie a surfboard leg rope to my mates cars towballs and get towed as some pretty insane speeds, it's very similar to Eboarding and the twang of the leggy is like water skiing. Eboarder for over three years and love the high speed carving. I think its fair to say you learn from every fall but never fall the same way twice.

Slide pucks stay on, cut the puck according to your remotes design. @Deckoz put a picture of that up. 

Yeah on the old leather I worn g-form knees underneath. New leather are hard shell for the days I am really sending it. If its your first time in leather get used to it first. It is surprisingly different in feel
 especially getting up from a squad /slide takes more effort before its worn in. 

And you mever leave 30mp/h without pucks. Those things save your ass and your leathers. Most stable way to controle your fall.

This is aroun 100km/h falling
 Propper technique, pucks and smiles is the only lasting effect. (as to why pucks for life ;))

that fall around 3mins looks so well controlled it almost looks fun! very impressive!

Its one of the first things you need to learn. The amount of time you would lose in the summer injured or in pain from massive road rash would mean less events, less practise.

I've skated long enough to know this but knowing it and actually training to fall is another thing altogether, I considered training via falling on purpose to test myself and kit - after seeing that fall I actually want to go out in the rain and try falling starting slow and building up. 

I had my first real ek8 injury recently, relatively slow but way under protected but since I've 'pop'ed that cherry' I want to get serious about falling and this vid. makes me think the process might just be a little more fun than expected :)

Yeah, rain is fun as long as it is safe (not heavy traffic).  "training" falling is basically generating muscle memory. It does require good uber body strenght as well as a stable core. So you dont faceplant because you cannot hold your weight on your arms or the slide out under you.

Go out there an explore ;) beautiful scenery helps with motivation.
My motivation is to conquer this spot next ;)

Tha video is gold!  
Full protectors but no helmets, the "good" ood days.

To your question. It is sensible to test if your knee pads actually stay on. And also to realise how much work it is to catch and drift out a fall on your palms in a push up position.

But dont go nuts and "train" falling at 50 or something ;)

Mayby get into a hands down toeside pedulum and stepp off the board and try holding it. So you got feet first down. Then go into a coleman and stepp of the board. 
Lastly tuck, reach infront of your board and sort of dolphin dive onto your palms. Simulating a highsider.

When teaching my kid to skate a regular deck, before I put him on a lightning powered murder board, I stuck him in a driveway that had grass at the end (in full gear of course) and told him to skate into it and showed him how to roll and slide and NOT land on his hands.

My kid is 15, been on an e-skate for well over a year now and has had some spills that my sphincter tighten up enough to make diamonds, but muscle memory and training have saved him from anything serious.

i'm actually pretty decent at getting weird action angles now. Turning like that is pretty easy, but my concave helps a lot because of how i can put my feet in the channels. staying low lets me hang my ass way into the turns on lefts and lean pretty far forward on rights, in fact its difficult NOT to go into a slide like that sometimes when i'm on kegels. I think the best wheels so far for the cam is the popocas for me on that deck, but anything bigger sort of interferes with the feedback my body needs. 

I think the biggest challenge is just letting go and allowing your body to do what it needs to to maintain balance and stay on the line while your more conscious mind tries to keep the target in frame.

Ive probably had it for 7 days all together but man riding it was such a dam blast nothing compares to it, not only dors it go fast but ive never had a better breaking feeling from a board before its strong yet soft at the same time and doesnt jerk you in anyway

Oh man..pardon me but USPS is literally shit. Ordered a package from US and it was sent 11th January and HOPEFULLY it will show up at my doorstep next week. The tracking they show their customer is not always true, often it’s the way the package SHOULD take but it didn’t because some other higher priority parcels took its place in plane, and your package is waiting... and waiting... for the next flight. 

Just my two cents 😂 had to spit it out.

Harass their ass and maybe it will finally move.

i haven't heard anything since i sent a letter to them on the customer's behalf asking them to please reconsider making him pay for half of the cost of replacement on parts that shouldn't have burned up that easily. I'm well into loss territory on this build and i'm not asking him for anything. this isn't that kind of thing. NGV needs to step up and contribute to this project. 

I feel like i just have to constantly teach people how to customer service. 

nobody knows how to customer service. Not a damn non-community centric vendor knows how to customer service. Its like we all live in this little pocket of space where we actually give a fuck, and anyone tangetial to the pocket only mostly gives some kind of shit, while literally noone else does.

I applaud your desire to do right by the customer.  I would suggest that when custom orders are made, specifically when the customer specs the hardware, its the customers responsibility to make sure the hardware is compatible.  I would further suggest that if there is someone, other than the customer, to blame it would be NGV.

I feel the same way. It seems like so many careless about their customers and more about their bottom line.

If NGV wants you to pay half, their are STILL profiting on the replacement... That's shameful. You sell a product, it fails, and you offer a replacement with a profit margin for yourself still?

My dad taught me one thing (and only one thing, lol) as a kid, and thats "The customer is always right. Even when they are wrong". It's time for the industry to learn.

Jake does it all the time. I build boards regularly that will do 40 with no issue provided the gearing is set up right. I prefer not to recommend those speeds, however. they're not really that practical in every day commuting or derping, and it takes longer to stop and increases the risk of over current while braking. 

I'm tempted to offer the customer an all wheel drive belted system with larger motor pulleys if they keep fucking around. Hitting 60 is just math. there's no reason a belted system can't do it. You just need to manage expectations for launch and use the right ratio and wheel height.

That's what I've been saying. Their system is based on bad math. They project insane top speeds but forgo proper gearing for low end torque.  

Then there's also the the shit choice on wheel design (I mean compromise) so that they can have the aesthetics even though their wheels fall apart at the speeds they want to do.

It's been a joke from the beginning.

I don’t understand the reasoning for using hub motors for high speeds. If I really wanted to hit 60 mph, I think the most reliable option would be 4wd, with 6-7 inch pneumatics using a 16/36T gear ratio. That way when I wanted to just ride normally, it’s as simple as swapping the wheel pulleys.

On that note, @psychotiller if you want to break the top speed record with one of your boards, I’ll jockey it for you 😆

Nope, they hold.

Generally abec is allways a safe bet with speed. Their centrax are loved just for that reason, to go fast ;)

lol

AWD superfly build on a 23/33 motor to wheel pulley ratio at 12S on my motors and focboxes on li-ion will do it theoretically in a full tuck using a 130 pound rider or thereabouts. 

But manage your expectations for launch and braking. I'd also probably go with ceramic bearings, and refresh them with every speed record attempt. Probably do new wheels as well. 

I have no interest in doing any of this, its not what i'm after. But If any of you want to, that's the approach i would likely take.

Had my Centrax over 45mph. They are quite lovely.  Think I would set-up superflys for 70mph and spin em up on the bench and look for growth and distortion. That is a chunk of urethane right there. I'd rather be on a proven purpose built  wheel.

Well the only hub motor designed around the centrax (and comes paired with the centrax for front wheels) is hummie's hubs. Excited as motor assembly is well under way! Had a few kinks to work through with the assembly, but all motor assembly bugs have been worked out, span the first of many assembled motors a few days ago!

I agree, the centrax have a great grip to and riding feel!
