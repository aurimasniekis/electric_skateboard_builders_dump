Hello All, at long last, my build thread! I've been working on this build for the past 4 months, and I have many of you to thank for all of the advice and encouragement you've provided. Thanks so much to @longhairedboy @onloop @sl33py @psychotiller @lox897 @lowGuido @King1017 @torqueboards and everyone else that provided their insight!        

Specs: 245Kv motor, 8s battery, Vesc from Enertion, wheels and pulleys from Alien Drive Systems, and motor mount from DIY ElectricSkateboard, Gearing is 60T 14T. 

And now a ton of pics:

Here you can see the battery alarms inside the enclosure, I left some windows so that I coudl see them without opening the enclosure

I wrapped the motor wire in techwrap. The enclosure is a screw case that I spaypainted.

I'm really enjoying the pneumatic tires... they are great here in my suburban riding situation!

The underside of the board; I used 3M carbon fiber vinyl

I'm using the nunchuck implementation available for VESC for controls, it seems very solid! I used some velcro to attach my arming switch plug onto it so it doesn't get lost when I'm not riding.

Inside the enclosure; I used Deans connectors and so far they are performing very well, and their size allowed me to keep this enclosure small! 12AWG wire throughout, and a battery arming switch with a resistor serves as my on-off and antispark. VESC takes up almost no room in there!

Sweet board! The 195mm Paris trucks has two barrel bushings which made it harder to get a better turning radius.

I swapped the top barrel for a cone and got a better turning radius. Just some advice if you wanted more turning radius.

Looks really good! My 5" pneumatics arrived at O'hare today, according to tracking. Sounds like it's going to be a while for some Enertion parts, though. What's your experience with effect on battery life so far?

I've been trying to decide if I should order Paris trucks for the pneumatics board or another set of Caliber IIs. Any thoughts? Is the extra 15mm for wheel clearance needed on that board?

@emotiva I rode for an hour and still had plenty of battery life left, but I can't comment on the impact of the pneumatics because I've never ridden urethane on this setup. The tires are at 100 psi which is high, the drag is probably pretty minimal. There's less surface in contact with the road when compare to urethane. I will say that the ride is amazingly smooth. 

With the kingpin bolt set as loose as possible, I can move though the full range of motion without wheelbite. In think that 195mm trucks contributes to that, because it's close. I definitely recommend a deck with wheel cutouts.

@treenutter, Thanks for the feedback - it's hard to find information on what boards/hardware will accommodate those or other pneumatic wheels. The most concrete piece of info I've found to date is a post on ES by Richard that 70mm is required between the inner truck mount holes and..widening of the deck: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=55843&p=1051385&hilit=beetbocks#p1003334. Of course, that depends on the shape of the board, truck width, etc., so your reply is very helpful. Is that a 345mm belt? I somehow feel like I'm going to finally get all my parts and then have issues with the belt fitting. 

Also, your CF vinyl looks very well applied - did you use something like wrapcut or were you able to achieve those edges without? Great looking board!

Sure thing @emotiva, glad to help! Yes, I agree that it's daunting to try to find parts that work together without being able to physically see them. There are lots of variables that factor in; I'll admit that I purchased a handful of pieces that turned out to be incompatible in the process. In this build I'm using a 345mm belt.

I wrote a [thread about using the carbon fiber vinyl.][1] Hope it helps! I used wrap cut the 2nd time and I highly recommend it unless you are already skilled at cutting vinyl.

Just a suggestion: it might be an idea to heatshrink the VESC to avoid shorts. 

And I definitely like your build, should think about those wheels too. But if I start my 5th build my wife will kill me....! ðŸ‘¼

Thanks @joren the calculated top speed is around 18 mph, assuming 70% efficiency. I haven't pushed to that speed on a ride yet, nor done a real-time speed test. Honestly, this build goes faster than I'm comfortable riding, and acceleration feels very fast when I push on the throttle.

In terms of gearing, I'm extremely happy with it! Using VESC, it starts from a dead stop with no problems (with a non-sensored motor), and I can climb all the hills in my neighborhood. As @onloop has said before, it's an incredible feeling to bomb *up* hills!

This is my first build, and my first ride on it was my very first esk8 ride. From the moment I stepped on it, I was hooked! I laughed with delight for about half of the ride, because the experience is so thrilling and enjoyable!

Great suggestion @elkick! When I ride, I have foam padding that I wrap around the VESC and a separate piece around the nunchuck receiver, to avoid shorts and to reduce vibration, but heatshrink would be a  good addition as well.  I took the foam out for the photo, to give VESC its chance to shine!

I love these wheels! The ride is really smooth, they eat road debris, and I don't notice an increase in rolling resistance.

Have you tried the new bushings? Thoughts? I've never skateboarded before, so I know nothing about the effects different bushings provide. Anyone have suggestions for, say, 3 different (preferably economical) models or ratings to buy in order to be able to get a feel for the range of possibility? Does tightening the trucks have a similar effect to using stiffer bushings?

@treenutter, how's everything holding up? Still happy with the nunchuck? Did you solder or plug the receiver into the vesc? Are the edges of the vinyl staying adhered?  Also, I'm glad that I went with the 195 Paris trucks, so thanks again for your input on that!

Yeah, depends on rider weight and ride comfortableness. I prefer a somewhat rigid setup so bushings and kingpin nut are tight to prevent random flex or easy flex when riding. Can go at higher speeds without a small adjustment throwing me off when I'm not paying attention.

In order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds i am asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.

Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as 
**"new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb"** this becomes hard to keep track of.

I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;
**Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC**

Example
**The Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks |  R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC**

[quote="emotiva, post:20, topic:292"]

[/quote] 

@emotiva I tried out a few different bushing configurations for this build. Right now I'm using Venom 83a barrels on the boardside and Venom 90a cones on the roadside. They are tightened about midway. This increased the turning radius, gives very precise steering, and seems pretty stable at mid-level speed. I wouldn't push this config to the max speed of my build for fear of speed wobble. If you've never skated before, I'd say to try out the default bushings for a while, at different settings, to see what you like. Start with the bushings fairly tight and see how it goes; as you loosen them you sacrifice stability at higher speeds.

Thanks @emotiva all is well in eks9ville! I love riding, it is an incredible feeling and enhanced further by the fact that I built the board and know how to modify/repair it if needed!

I have a GTB2 and a nunchuck, and I still vastly prefer the nunchuck (I've considered selling the GTB2 because I don't think I'll ever us it). The nunchuck is smaller and feels more natural to me, and the cruise and reverse functions are awesome. I know that some have had trouble with the wiiceiver and dropping signals, but that has never happened to me using the native nunchuck app for VESC. I soldered the Nyko Kama receiver wires to a JST plug and plugged that into the port on VESC. I've had no issues with this setup so far. Vinyl still looks great and has not peeled.

I'd suggest [looking at this page][1] for recommendations on durometer (hardness) based on your weight, and bushing shape based on how you think you'll ride. Try a few shapes and durometers to get a feel for them. I've liked @longhairedboy 's suggestion to use Venoms, but there are lots of other good brands. 

Tightening the kingpin nut increases the amount of force needed to turn, but tightening too much also limits turning radius and control at low speeds. It's best to find a durometer and shape that works for you rather than tightening the kingpin nut too much. If you find that you really need to wrench it down to get the desired stiffness, you should consider a harder bushing.

yup. Got me some venom double barrels. If you keep them not-so-tight you'll still get a good turning radius and you'll still get that snap back to center that helps keep down the wobbles at speed.

@emotiva this weekend I discovered that with these wheels I can traverse rock-and-gravel trails! I wasn't expecting this, but it was actually very smooth and I had plenty of ground clearance. I wouldn't make this a staple of my riding, but for 20 minutes I was legitimately "offroad" and it was no problem. Was waiting for a flat tire but lucked out!

A few updates to this build. 

I stopped using the nunchuck and started using a GT2B modded [first with Badwolf](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/badwolf-mod-v2-for-the-village-build/1565/35) and then with a mod I found on Ebay, made by @MasterCho . I didn't like the badwolf print that I got from Shapeways, it felt thin and cheap. I'm much happier with the new one. The new [Mad Munkey mod](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gt2b-mad-munkey-v1-enclosure/2814) that @FLATLINEcustoms made looks great as well, that will be my next enclosure mod! 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BD8v5uMwdDe/

I got about 120 miles on my drive wheel before the tire gave out. It's been replaced since.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BEhGIWQwdJf/

I updated my VESC.[ Installed a bootloader,](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-installing-a-bootloader/752) [added a cap to C18](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-braking-release/1550/70), and I run in FOC mode.

Hi there my fellow New Englander,

I have 3 builds in the work and my pneumatic is heavily inspired by your build.
Thanks for posting all the info. I do have a couple of questions. What size are your wheels (including the rubber)? And how far from the deck to tha axel?
The top of my wheels are above the deck and I'm trying to figure out if I want that or not.

I also fried a drv chip and am going to do my first attempt with hot air to replacing it, any tips? (Read the other thread where you replaced yours)

Thanks!

Hey @Bender wow 3 builds that's great! These wheels are 127mm (5") I used Paris 195s so I suppose it would be 97.5mm from the center of the truck to the tip of the axel. As long as you're not getting wheelbite, I don't think it's a problem to have the wheels higher than the deck.

Sorry to hear about the DRV chip. My advice: go slowly and use a lot of kapton tape to protect the other components on the VESC. Make sure you have solder wick and liquid flux on hand to take off any shorts that exist after your connect the chip. Get good lighting and a magnifier, or a jeweler's loupe so you can actually see what's going on. 

I got one of those stands for PCBs and it helps to keep the board from moving while you work on it. Have fun!

@s00cl0se you don't need to worry about that. You do not have to apply the max amperage that your motor can manage. Do plenty of reading about VESC here on the forum as you're setting it up. Key things are setting max ERPM, Setting voltage cuttof limits, configuring your controller, and doing motor detection.

@cliofreak Having used these for a long time, I'd no longer recommend them because the tires have a lot of quality control issues and they don't last very long. I got around 120 miles on the drive wheel. The nylon hubs were not meant for esk8, and they are prone to flex and wobble. Using these was a cool idea when there weren't better options. 

I'd recommend a set of @psychotiller 's awesome sixshooter wheels, which I use now. If 6" feels too large, abec11 has a excellent thane 107mms.

Its the only option. I sell them with a complimentary dual set of pulleys. Just choose your size and only use one.

$300
