Hi guys,

I have to thank the community a lot for what I have learned and for all the help I got building my board, with a special mention for @darkkevind, @egzplicit and @okp . You guys rock!

I have a more detailed parts list, but this is the main stuff:

- Evolve Carbon Gen1 deck
- Evolve Supercarve trucks
- UniK motor mounts
- 15x58T setup from BoardBumpers
- Trampa Superstar hubs
- Trampa UrbanThreads tyres
- Trampa Gummies
- Zealous bearings
- Gates HTD 345 5M belts
- Alien APS 100Amp
- TheBatteryGuy 10s7p Samsung 30Q battery
- Enertion Focbox (x2)
- Maytech 6355, 170kV motors (x2)
- Photon remote

Here's a link for a quick video (photon remote not yet calibrated then): https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp_rP_kALpy/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet

It's a sweet sweet build, which can both function as a smooth carver or (for me at least!) a speed demon.
:-)

I'm not actually sure, I got the battery+BMS from @darkkevind, so he'll have a better answer for you.

@b264 it's just a tiny little 10s BMS from decent seller I know on AliExpress... It's charge only, discharge is bypassed.

A similar build...

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi7r4RngWD5/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=14o5031fxn773

As you can see, the battery fits quite nicely... Would be even more space of used with a focbox unity.

that's an awesome build you have. I would be great to have them side by side to compare the rides.. I prefer the wider trucks...

Come to Perth, Western Australia and we can test. Weather is lovely.

I have no idea if the wider trucks are better or worth the effort to learn how to weld, but it was certainly fun. I'm considering changing to the 175mm tires now. They are supposedly better. I will lose top speed but I have enough.

Ahhh, it's only on the other side of the world! :smiley:

I'm using the 165mm  urban threads from trampa and I feel it's a good compromise between PUs and 200mm ATs...!

Thank you mate. I've been riding it quite a bit these last few days and still haven't been able to get to top speed... max I've done is 49.1 kph. Must tighten the trucks a bit more, as I'm aware that speed wobbles are a thing on gullwing type trucks! Eeek!!

Drilling new holes, as the UNiK mounts don't line up well with the Gen2 deck...

Yeah! Thats why I asked. Also i wanted to ask, what would be the largest battery you can acomodate on the Carbon internal enclosure if you were to print a heat sink riser to put down cabling, BMS and VESCs? I see there is still some space left that you could use for a larger battery thru all its lenght.

Hey Ricardo thanks for sharing the link to your thread. I’m just about to begin a dual motor upgrade using the same Gen2 Carbon deck. If you could please share the detailed parts list and purchase links, that’d awesome. Cheers dude.

If it was today, i would have used the metr module and have a more basic remote. I'd also use the unity (then I could possibly do away with the antispark switch?)

The unity smart switch fits the existing stock charge port perfectly. No external loopkeys needed. 

I played around with 10s7p pack ideas, really want to cram those big EV bus lipos in it.

Lol, I open the whole damn thing to balance charge a 12s pack made of 6 2s hardcase lipos. 

It’s a temp solution. And it’s stupid, I know.

I experimented with aviation connectors to balance charge externally, but A) should not charge at high amps when enclosed, B) smart charger didn’t like it after awhile (loose leads ?) C) asking for a short with the setup as pictured.
