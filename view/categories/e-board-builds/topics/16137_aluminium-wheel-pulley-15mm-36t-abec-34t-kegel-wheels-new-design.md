I think the 34T for the Kegel was better 
36T was to big, it was 56,16mm diameter 
Kegel was 80mm and when you stand on the Board
i think you lose1-2mm, so you have only 8mm 
between the belt and the street.

heh, the perfect kegel pulley from germany! I know that you guys have actually measured the wheels with a precision 3D laser system for a perfect fit - just couldnt use your pulley until now because I needed the big bore for my diy ronin adapters. very nice, you guys are putting in a lot of hours lately for new improved parts :smiley:

Sorry Randyc,

but where you asked was that related to them ABEC Pulley
and I also lowered the price by the Kegel at the same Time.
From 58,50 to 54.- by the 32T 
Before, they were more expensive al Kegel Pulleys
but they are more costly to manufacture as the ABEC
And the Kegel have another diameters.
