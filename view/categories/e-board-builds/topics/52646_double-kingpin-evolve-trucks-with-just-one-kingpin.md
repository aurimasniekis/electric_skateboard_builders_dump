Hi there,

I'm planing to build a Landyachtz Evo with Evolve trucks, but it looks like the double kingpin design does not play well with (de-)wedge of the board, because it angles the board forward (the angle of the rear truck makes it stand significantly taller in the back). It is also unclear if the changed truck angles affect the trucks negatively in any way in the long term.

Is it a good idea to remove the second kingpin (i.e. the truck arm in the middle)? What are your thoughts?

Thanks!

Its fine to do so, i used to run sidewinders with the arm removed, the evolve trucks are based of them and the parts works together so i dont see why it wouldnt be the same as the experience i had

@rickyd  Did you end up doing this? was the truck more stable or less?

There wasn't enough clearance for the motors, unfortunately.
