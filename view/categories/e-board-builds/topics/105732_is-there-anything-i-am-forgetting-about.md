I am about to build an electric longboard, and I’m not really shure if I’m forgetting about something, of if there would be better options

Still debating about what longboard I’m going to use
Thinking about the rayne demonseed, the rayne Amazon or to buy an other board
I do want to be able to put pneumatic wheels on there (smallest size possible)

Already ordered the torqueboards kit 
218mm trucks 
15mm belts 
reverse mount
190kv 6355 motors
Pully for wheels and motors

What I still need to order is 
Focbox unity or the flipsky 6.6 plus but I’m pretty shure it’s going to be the focbox
Battery pre build 12s5p Samsung 30q with enclosure on eskate.eu
And a flipsky vx2 remote

If the e build gods on this forum have and or know any better options, please let me know
