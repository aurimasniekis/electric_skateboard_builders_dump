**June 9th**
 
This is the parts list for my build some already ordered much of it is to be ordered but im hoping to have it all together by end of this month.

It will be my first DIY after riding my wowgo 2s daily to work
![](https://esk8-news-objects.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/2X/f/f3d55d042a7e25e3f9d0829c7640295cad9242fd.jpeg)

I most probably would of brought the Carbon GTR if they had released it 2 weeks earlier and i hadnt already paid for my Fatboy Nano Gear Drive, Heat sink, Bergmeister wheel adaptors and FOCbox Unity (which i now have somehow even though people who ordered years before me dont???)

![image|690x388](upload://rK1lIdB0YldDNtvkKGzAE7Oy1xc.jpeg) 

Now for the rest of the parts list…

The battery will be built by @tinp123 still to be ordered also but it will be a 12s4p of samsung 30Q cells
so im hoping for a nice powerful stable board to replace my trusty wowgo

![image.png](https://esk8-news-objects.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/2X/7/7b1322bb5c50608b7bdd8a5fa9f9e9a30b63271b.png)

Feel free to point out anything i have missed or overlooked but im very hopful to have the exact board speed and range i need from my esk8.


**June 16th**

coming along nicely hoping to have get the remote, trucks, deck and motors , all this week. :slight_smile:

![image.png](https://esk8-news-objects.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/2X/6/6f4d29a70ce52cfe5632abe60a0add66d5976edb.png)

(I changed to @mackann bioboard 150kv motors) this does up the top speed to about 38mph :crazy_face::crazy_face::crazy_face:

The 12s4p Battery from @tinp123 is well in hand too.

![image.jpg](https://esk8-news-objects.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/2X/d/db463cd979636ab2a2407a60b212debcdc9260a8.jpeg)

Id like to shout out to @BigBen on his enclosure i really feel its a super quality product and under-priced. £50 is too cheap for the workmanship and finish on this enclosure

.

**July 22nd** 

Received battery finished much better than i could of done but took a lot longer than i hoped originally.

started puttig them together but had to STOP!!!
need the Bergmeister wheels still which Customs in the UK has seized :frowning:

even have my puncher prevention measures in place

Im hoping this gets finished this week if i get the wheels sorted.

Really need advice on how to setup the Unity do i align everything then plug in my unity and configure or do i need to do that first? A little advice on how to do this would be helpful.

.

**July 29th**

So this was the day it finally came together.
After rebuilding the gear drives about 5 times finally got things all lined up and working right. 

 I had to purchase a drill from argos just to do a lot of the work but no bother it worked a treat fot the enclosure holes and power switch.
![20190727_030453|690x388](upload://flELgx1DKxLu1UpqfZxV3FYK61F.jpeg) 

But as usual in esk8 there were many problems to overcome.

![20190727_203513|690x388](upload://1anN3p08l1X77JoYYTMoUfhIrUO.jpeg) 
fitting the case was hard and requires technique and them making sure everything inside is not going to move around becuase i never want to remove the enclosure how hard it was getting everything right and not rattling and just fitting.

![20190727_190557|281x500](upload://4od2kN9ccoMMiRbntRyNeBCwxJs.jpeg) 

and then once assembled there are more problems

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beYZeKoMyBg

luckily it was me causing the issues, using a spacer(only on 1 side) that came with the gear drive and flywheel adaptors so now all running sweet.

![20190728_175143|690x388](upload://pLSz04CNrRjxsV0nDVMdTxEUpMe.jpeg) 
Big issue with the wiring and how to secure it.I decided to do a bit of a bodge for now and used nylon cord and some industrial staples.

![20190728_154150|690x388](upload://yQqLXlSQCU4ZJVO5zXjjr3ZKVng.jpeg) 


I will say for anyone wanting to build a DIY ESK8 that goes 30MPH plus first read this...
http:///building-a-lightning-powered-murder-board-part-1/

Id also recommend watching this guys video as i think what he has done for the money spent is incredible.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8n8ceZM9qY

I cant echo the sentiment and accuracy of everything that has been said and the time you will save reading this is well worth the time before you start.

**IS it worth it?**
**YOU better believe it is, not everyone can ride a skateboard and even fewer have the ability to build them from scratch and be able to use it daily.**

**So its a choice do you want to be driving a ford KA or a Ferrari everyday?**

.

.

As you all have probably gathered from the boards name Im from Birmingham UK but the better bit is we have a WhatsApp esk8 group of 24 members now so if you have a board and riding is your prefered method of transport come join us. We even have members with a onewheel and Gotway Moster Unicycle, ESK8 is growing so much its amaizing to be a part of

Any Questions about anything please ask, There have been many who i need to thank for the help and advice along the way the community **(apart from enirtion)** have been amaizing and so helpful in every aspect of advice and sharing of knowledge so if i can give back by sharing this i hope someone finds it useful.

Like many who set out on this sort of venture there were times i just got fed up and wanted to sell the parts, BUT im so glad i didnt.

Im also very glad i took the photos at the start so if i crash it i always have something to remember when it was all shiny and new.

It took 4 times longer than i planned through no fault but simply not being able to get things, getting the wrong things, Customs, Import fees, useless companies but my god riding it is something differnt.

The hours and hours of reading other build guides and deciding what you want from the start really feels worth it once your gliding over rough paths and cutting onto grass and back to tarmac.

Gear drive is great and is very noisy but so are the motors when you put that many amps through them. You can hear how loud everything is in the multiople videos i posted.
i got approx 15miles driving like i stole it, prob more like 20-25miles if i rode like Jay Boston and turned the power down and rode sensible

I have been 26mph so far but its about the 0-20 time and hard accellerating and braking not the absolute top speed.

you need to have a word with yourself bro that's not a solution, that's an abomination!!!!!!! saved only for life and death situations.

**Im sure theres a better simple solution out there....**
i saw some guy attach the bunch of cables in a bundle with something plastic that connected to the truck bolt and then a rubber or plastic strip cover over the wires like my nylon cord but no idea when that was or what it used

Using some small cable glands would be the proper way, water proof with strain relief. Even i use them on my bodge board. 
The problem with the arrow valley park is its full of ppl and dogs, the circumference of the lake is only 1.25 miles too. The north and south paths kind of lead to nowhere. Draycote water is better. 5 mile laps.

Hey, if you've got any solutions I'm all oars.  I agree, this is a suboptimal abomination; however theres really is no way I can see to route these wires around the motors with forward mounting.  I've got copper braid to guard the phases already, but let's be real the motors will eat through those in 2 seconds.  Throw me something 3D printable and I'll fix it, until then it's an abominable (yet functioning) mess.
