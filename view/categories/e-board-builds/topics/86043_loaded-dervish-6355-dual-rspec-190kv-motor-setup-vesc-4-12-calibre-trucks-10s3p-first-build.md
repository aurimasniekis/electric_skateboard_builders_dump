Hey guys, I'm totally new to this DIY esk8 thing. Here is my list, might need some advise from you guys on my build :stuck_out_tongue:

1. Loaded Dervish FLEX 2
2.  [10s3p Samsung 30Q 40A from their latest board W2](https://www.ownboard.net/collections/parts-accessories-for-electric-skateboard)
3. [ESC and Battery enclosure of W2](https://www.ownboard.net/collections/parts-accessories-for-electric-skateboard)
4. mini-remote 2.4ghz from banggood
5. vesc 4.12 x2
6. 6355 RSPEC 190kv motors from enertion x2
7. Calibre 44 trucks
8. Anti-spark switch from mboard

Is my battery compatible with my board?![53552201_293763107963390_3600299800941035520_n|499x500](upload://4RNrK9YW12tD59QWiE0VlQMfAsm.jpeg)

All should work without problems. Make sure to setup correctly your escs & remote & motors
But don't get the antispark, make a simple & reliable xt90s loop key

You might run into some clearance issues with the 44deg baseplate on a drop through deck with the motors mounted towards the middle of the deck. 
You defo have the right idea with the split enclosure though. Either way, I think youâ€™ll be able to find a way to make it work. ðŸ˜€

Haha, I think I do have an idea what I'm doing :joy:. I'm using an angle riser pad with![20190305_081834|500x500](upload://oVFJGI9lRrHm3ovDosM4dmoixqm.jpeg)  Unik riser. I should have enough clearance from the board.

Is the loop key better?

I love my loopkey. Never failed on me.
Anti spark switches are 1. expensive and 2. prone to fail. 

In my opinion they're just a hassle and waste of money.
