Since reading is for pussies, I'll try to keep the text short and pictures plenty.

Main parts list:
- @Hummie deck
- Haggy Drive System (trucks, drive train, Bergmeister wheels) from @riverside.rider
- @bigben enclosure
-  10S4P 30Q battery (spot welded "modules" provided by @Tinp123, rest done by yours truly)
- Focbox Unity
- Custom Maytech 6374 motors, kindly sold to me by Timo
- A bunch of other stuff that nobody cares about

Credits:\
Timo (@riverside.rider) can't be praised enough. His products and customer service are fantastic. Thank you for sharing both with us.\
Also @bigben and @Tinp123 are awesome guys to do business with. Thank you both.

Now to the interesting stuff:

Damn the insides of that board look nice and professional, great job!

What makes those motors "custom" exactly? Non-standard KV, or just a different branding on the can?

Thank you!
The motor shaft is D shape and a little longer to better fit existing Haggy components. Also the sensor wire connector is different but it's under the cable sleeving in all my photos. KV and everything else is as usual I believe.

Thanks! I would have preferred that but couldn't fit them there. Not without modifying the enclosure or doing something else to the motor cables than using extensions with 5.5mm bullet connectors. This way it was just simply easier.

The space is quite tight down there if you look at this picture.\
However I have an idea that I might go through with at some point to change the motor cable routing.

I think the belt cover turned out pretty nice. Still need to order some better (color) filament.\
If anyone wants the stl let me know and I'll upload somewhere.

A bit hard to explain without any pictures or anything but I was thinking of making sort of a wire terminal that bolts on top of the wire shroud portion of the enclosure. It would then house female bullets to easily connect the motor cables.

Probably not so helpful to you at all, sorry about that :smiley:\
Anyway it would still require some modification for the enclosure so not my first priority at the moment.

It rides wonderfully. The deck, the trucks, the wheels, the power, all working very nicely. No complaints whatsoever.

@Legacy23 I will try to share the file by tomorrow.

I have a kahua+hummie build. Group hug. Are you running stock bushings? I'm still in the getting to know the board stage but with the width of the truck I wish it was a bit firmer. My pile of riptide stuff is a bit too tall.

I was able to fit a Blood Orange insert bushing in the truck so now I'm running one of those insert bushings and one original bushing per truck. Haven't tested Riptide bushings. Although the pivot cup (Caliber) fits fine.

@jaatis: Very Nice build!

Collecting everything to build something very similar.

How much clearance do you have left with drop through? Because I want to use the DS enclosure.

Did you use a diebms? What’s the advantage?

Thanks!

Thanks! I think there's enough room for the DS enclosure but also a high change it will get scratched.
I'm using a small Bestech charge only BMS, nothing too fancy. Works fine for me.

The DS enclosure is about 12mm deeper, there’s quite a few running it this way. @sayekim has a couple and one of them is on thane.

Awesome build man. Saw your ad on Tori, you got me thinking for a while there ;) but wasn't fast enough I guess.
May I ask where you pulleys come from? I'd love to explore 3D print options around the Helsinki area, but don't know where to start.
```

---
## \#38 Posted by: jaatis Posted at: 2019-09-05T13:21:23.910Z Reads: 56

Thanks! The whole drive including all pulleys train is coming from Haggyboard. I would suggest to avoid 3D printed pulleys as they tend to break quite easily.

You should've come and tried the board while it was still in Finland :wink:\
If you want some information about 3D printing in general I'd be happy to help, just shoot me a PM.

Already planning my next build once I get over this temporary financial situation.
