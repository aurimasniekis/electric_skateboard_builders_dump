**Hello!** 

This will be my first electric longboard build so be nice :slight_smile:. I have done some research for about a month now and I have already ordered all the parts that i need (I think :smiley:) . I wanted a build that would be quite easy to put together so i went with these parts.

**Sector 9 Carbon Flight** Longboard deck 36:

**"Mono drive r-spec pro+"** Enertion: http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/single-motor-mount-pro-kit-plus/

**Vesc**  Enertion:

**TorqueBoards 2.4ghz Nano** Remote Controller:

**Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C** x 3, connecting them in series to get a 9S 5000mah lipo pack:

This is where I'm at right now:

I will also try to make a loop key using a xt90s connector. I will be uploading more pictures when i get all the parts that i need.

I made this sketchy diagram quickly to plan out how everything is going to be connected:

What do you guys think? Any feedback or comments are appreciated.

What kind of top speed where you looking for? 6s with 190kv might be a little slow. Check out this calculator: http://toddy616.blogspot.com/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html

Tbh I'm not really sure about what kind of speeds i want yet... I have been skating almost whole my life so I'm quite comfortable with speed. I might just test out these parts at first and then add/or replace the batteries later. The calculator gave me these speeds: Top Speed 17.09 mph / 27.50 kph, Weighted Top Speed 11.96 mph / 19.25 kph. So yeah these speeds seem kinda slow? I'm also quite a heavy guy (about 93kg)

Go with a 245 KV motor. Same bolt hole pattern, but you'll get quite a bit more speed.

Hmm, I don't think I will be changing the motor as it's already ordered... Would it be stupid to get another 3s to make it a 9s battery? I haven't really seen 9s setups before...

Nothing wrong with 9s. I'd recommend doing it as a cheaper alternative to getting a 10s battery. You'll probably be happier with the speed.

Quick update: I got my remote from  today. I orderd  2 more batteries from Hobbyking so i will go for 9S or 12S probably. The parts from Enertion haven't been shipped yet even though they said they will probably ship them this week... :confused:

So I just got my kit from enertion. It came pre-assembled. The motor doesn't seem to spin when I spin the wheel. Is this normal? @enertionsupport

I'll get some better pictures tomorrow. Could it be that the belt is so loose so the motor doesn't spin?

No. Does it spin if the belt isn't on?

If it still doesn't, take the whole motor off and try it.

I mean the motor does spin but when I spin the wheel with the belt on the motor sometimes spins and sometimes it doesn't.

? weird. It's hard to get a good idea just hearing it. It may have to do with the magnets. I'm not sure tho.

No clue, it came pre-assembled so i assumed it would be properly installed. I don't have the tools at this location but I will get my hands on tools tomorrow. I have to check it then.

My only guess is tht there is no shaft key in place so the motor pulley just free spins
```

I second the key missing in the key way. Looks like both components are spinning freely individually of each other. The key is supposed to lock the pulley in place with the motor shaft so the two parts spin together.

You guys were right. Apparently Jason at enertion is training new staff and somebody forgot to put the key in the keyhole... I dissassembled it and the hole was empty... I'm talking with @onloop about it and he has been really cool about it. I hope I get the parts I need so I get to ride this thing before winter is coming xD(I live in Finland). 

Does somebody know if I could put something "diy" in the keyhole?

This is how I got it. No key for the motor and no female 5.5mm bullet connectors.

I took a pic so you could get an idea of how it will look when finished.

Hello guys, Today I got my esk8 somewhat finished. First I used the dremel on this fishing supplies box to make it fit my 3 batteries and vesc.

 I put some velcro on my batteries and inside the box to make them secure. Then I bolted the box on the deck using some old skate hardware.

Tomorrow I will have time to test the setup a little bit better. And I might add some better quality pictures and possibly a video if people are interested about this project.

First test ride today. Oh Boy it's fun and crazy fast :grin:. I've had my conflicts with enertion but all I can say right now is that @onloop really knows his stuff. This thing is amazing :slight_smile:.

Hey guys, I need some help. I had a really bad fall today, when I was accelerating my motor suddenly hit the brakes and I flew like superman and had to go to the hospital. (No major injuries only a few stitches and some bruises).

Now my problem is that when I try to accelerate with the remote, the motor only stutters a little bit and doesn't go full throttle. Has anyone had a similar experience? Or does anyone know what the problem might be and how I could fix this? I have read that stuttering may be caused by phase wires shorting out but that shouldn't be the problem I think... <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/2/223408a1ea4063c4f6392f47c12f9984f710f661.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I had the same thing happen, it was the ESC in my case.  Since I've replaced it I haven't had it happen again.  Sorry to hear about your injury, back on the horse though brother :).

Check the motor connections. One time my motor stuttered and it was from a loose wire in the connector.

EDIT: What T&R are you using? The winning remote/tb nano is dangerous.

I'm using the winning remote, but I don't think that's the issue, not sure though. Seems like it would be a motor/vesc issue to me?

I'm gonna check all the motor/vesc connections when I feel better (in a few days). If that doesn't work I have another vesc that I can test out.

I have also read that some guys have had problems with r-spec motorwires shorting on them self inside the motor? Any advice on how I can check this?

You have to pull apart the motor to look at the wires. I would do that as a last resort.
