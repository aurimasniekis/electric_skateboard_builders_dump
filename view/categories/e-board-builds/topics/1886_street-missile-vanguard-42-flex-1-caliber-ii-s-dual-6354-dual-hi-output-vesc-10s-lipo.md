Hey Everyone!

@RunPlayBack pushed me to share my Vanguard build, so here it is!

I started this build 2 years ago and have learned a ton from it. This board is responsible for destroying many components (2 Flier ESCs, 2 VESCs, original APS mounts) but it is finally at a robust & reliable state.

Top speed = unknown

I start getting nervous at ~30 mph and back off, still has a bunch of torque & throttle remaining though.

I ride some rough pavement at times and fatigued the original stainless steel mounting bolts causing one to break in half. Fun fact, stainless steel fasteners are typically only half the strength of other non-stainless steel fasteners. Replaced the bolts with high-strength alloy steel and covered in silicone to prevent corrosion.

Enclosure is held on with a 2-part silicone. This allows for flex in the deck without placing stress on the enclosure.

dual high output VESCs from @chaka. These things are amazing and really bring the board to life. I have never once had a cut-out (knock on wood).

simple charging setup. Red wire has an anti-spark built in. I like to keep things simple so there are less failure points.

I use a velcro strap to store the remote

After riding it today, I can attest that this board is a BEAST! What motors/mounts do you have on their @Jeff

Motors are here: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18127__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6354_260kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor.html

Geared down 12/32 so theoretical top speed of around 40 mph.

Mounts are 2-year old Alien Drive System mounts.

Your board looks good, that box is pretty solid, though mine looks like crap now and it houses my batteries as well.

Took about a half hour to edit that. I'd say we shot about a half hour of footage all together between all the cameras. I also like to edit and upload the same day to capitalize off the energy/euphoria of the ride. Unless it's a spec testing video, I shoot everything at 48fps and pick only the interesting moments or cool camera move/angles. I'll also try to direct a little while we're skating, like having the riders do S pattern carving, getting into a low stance, full throttle past the camera, etc. With the drone stuff, I fly FPV and do smooth follow moves like a video game. I also have a spotter with me watching the drone through line of sight to ensure that I'm above any trees or obstacles. I'm still experimenting with other cool ways to shoot eboarding. Watching a lot of action movie chase scenes with motorcycles is helpful too :smile:

You are definitely getting it down man! The videos look great. I haven't seen any other videographers out there who have captured the ride like you do. It actually makes it look fun instead of like some jumbled, rumbling mess. You're build and videos have me so excited to finish my dual Carvon build. Definitely appreciate the art and inspiration!

Here is a quick update to the Vanguard build.

Shout-out to @RunPlayBack for help with the custom enclosures. We may have gone a bit overkill on volume but there is a ton of room to pack pretty much anything in them. I think they will protect the motors since they tuck in nicely.

Also thanks to @psychotiller for the motor mount shims. It is amazing how a little piece of aluminum straightens the motor mounts right out.

Upgraded everything to 15mm belts so the system can handle the torque, works awesome.

Drive pulley is from DIY. I 3D printed a ring to help the drive pulley stick out from the wheel so I can utilize the entire width of it. Only using three bolts to reduce the rotating mass, works great.

Don't have to remove any hangar. The drive wheel pulley has a large enough ID to clear it.

Are you limiting the ERPM? Since you're running 10s and 260KV :) I'm asking because I'm planning to do the same, but I would rather not limit anything. :)

No, 18T as in 9 pole pairs I think. I'm not sure about these because I don't know what it means. It just says 18T in the specifications of the motor where most is 14T :)
EDIT: T for "Turns"

Decided to upgrade the board with 100mm MBS wheels, can't recommend them enough!

The swap out was fairly straightforward due to @JuniorPotato93's awesome wheel pulleys. Went with the 15mm wide 42T version and 3D printed them out of nylon at 100% infill.

Motors are now too wide so I had to do a front/back approach.

The ride is noticebly better comming from 83mm flywheels, especially on rough michigan streets.

I don't have any pictures but I can tell you that it is just a tiny rectangle  about .35 x .75 x .03". You can pretty easily cut them out of a soda can or some thin aluminum sheeting.

These ones seem to. Apparently they are from Japan. I balance charge each time and rarely run them down too far. I'm sure they have lost a little bit of range but I can still take them over 8 miles which is enough for me.
