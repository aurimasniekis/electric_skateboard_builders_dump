Hi there! I am currently on a mission to build an esk8... for 180$

Don't worry! I already have a longboard, LiPo charger and other miscellaneous items. I'm planning on buying the parts listed below:

Battery - 4000mAh 6S 30C (two in parallel for 8000mAh)
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-4000mah-6s-30c-lipo-pack-xt-60.html
Motor - 63-64 190KV
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html
ESC - 70A plane ESC I had laying around

No longer sold on hobbyking?

Controller - Standard RC car controller
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/quanum-2-4ghz-3ch-pistol-grip-tx-rx-system.html
Motor Mount - cheap, sold on HK
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html


I need the board to get to my high school. its 11km away and I can only take transit for the first 5-6km

My plan for the future is to upgrade my ESC so i can run 12s and get to school faster, be late less frequently hehe.


Now for my questions (Yes I did do research before asking but i really don't want to mess this up).

Has anyone used hobbykings motor mount, is it any good?

Since hobbyking doesn't have it's "pulley set with belt" in stock

What do you recommend i get (I'm situated in the EU) and from where. I'm looking for the most budget option that isnt complete crap.
My last question (for now :stuck_out_tongue: ) Can i run my standard 70mm longboard wheels or do I need 83mm+ flywheels/flywheel clones. I have roughly 80mm clearance under my board, is that enough.

Thank you for reading this, I'm really desperate to make this work first try.

If i were you i would have waited until i got a bit more money to spend, as $180 is very little.. You will then be able to afford a better esc than that crappy 70A fly esc who doesnt even have brakes.. I would say about $300 is a minimum If you want a somewhat quality board.

Hey! Thanks for the help it is greatly appreciated :wink:  
I have a 3d printer at hand so the cases wont be necessary. I've seen people 3d print the gears/mount/pulley system as well so I will try that before purchasing them. (using Nylon (PA))

You could get racerstar motors they are smaller then the keda but are a few bucks cheaper and are sensored.
