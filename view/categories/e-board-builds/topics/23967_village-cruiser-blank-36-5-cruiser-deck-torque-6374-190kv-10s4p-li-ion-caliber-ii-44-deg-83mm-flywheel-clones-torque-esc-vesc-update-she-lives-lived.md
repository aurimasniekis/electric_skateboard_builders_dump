Hello hello.  

I've been lurking around the boards for a few months procrastinating about diving in and embarking on my first build.  Well here it goes.  

**Background:** I grew up skating and still you a standard kick-push skate deck as a commuter in NYC about 50% of the time.  After discovering eSkates, I decided to back a board on kickstarter.  After months and months of delays, I said "fuck this, I'm gonna build my own".  

**Goals:** To build a fast, reliable board that has good range.  You know, just the trifecta of a perfect board... hah.  Honestly though, I just want something that will be fun to zip around on long joyrides mostly.  I will likely use the smaller mass produced board as my daily commuter if it ever arrives.  

**Sidenote:**  This is my first build.  I would love any feedback at all-- especially if something looks wrong.  Below is the general plan.  I still haven't thought about all the wiring needs in terms of what connections and what gauge wire (if anything needs to be changed?).  

**The Plan:**

I really want something with a kicktail, but also with a decent wheelbase.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far.  I will be sure to keep this thread up to date as a means to share my build, keep myself accountable, and ask some questions along the way.  So far I only have the battery, so I'm holding off on ordering my parts for a few days to see if I can kick up some feedback.

Looks good so far to me, the only problem I see is the remote. I have heard that that remote is just a re-skin of the original nano remote which is known to be unreliable. I use the GT2B with a 3d printed case and that works great for me. If your mind is set on a small form factor, the mini remote is good if you don't mind a trigger style. A third option would be the bench wheel remote for a thumb control and reliability.

+1 for the GT2B, if you don't have access to a 3D printer you can try to find someone that will print a new case for you at 3dhubs.com, or you could buy a mastercho mod cause their awesome.

For the belt lenght you generally want the pulleys as close together as possible so 255 or 265 would be ideal.

A while ago I made a thread with a few enclosure suggestions that might help out, I have one from pfc and another from elephant cases. The elephant case is better looking and definitely thicker/more protective though.

The build looks solid.  I will warn you that white flywheel clones get fuggin ugly quick, mine are kind of a light brown color with only 59 miles on them.  

As far as remotes are concerned... If you like a thumb trigger you can't beet the Benchwheel and Nano-X remotes.  If you want an index finger trigger look at the GT2B and the ton of mods available.

@Smorto -- Thanks for the advice about the remote.  Since I am already in for the group buy, maybe I will look into benchweel remote as well.  Something tells me this won't be my last board, so having two isn't the worst problem in the world.

@NickTheDude -- Pulleys as close as possible.  Got it.  I'll shoot for the 255mm belt. Great enclousure thread also-- thanks!

@mmaner -- I was up in the air on white wheels anyway.  I think i'm going to rethink it.  59 miles is nothing to be getting all fugly.

Do not use clone wheels, they are too hard, get abec 11 flywheels. 

Do not use that remote get the mini 2.4ghz remote, it's cheaper and more reliable

Forget about the carbon fiber vinyl, it won't last a week, as soon as it start to tear apart you will regret it, besides the enclosure will cover most of the deck underneath and the grip tape will cover everything on the top. 

Everything else is perfect

The components are rolling in.. I should start putting some thought into wiring, how I'm going to secure components to the deck (I'm thinking Velcro?), and an enclosure.

I think I'm just about set on the wiring diagram.  Should I insert an anti spark switch where the battery connects to the VESC?  My battery came with an on/off switch, but from what I've read it might be safer with an anti spark.  If so, I would have to turn on the power switch then plug in the anti spark to make use out of it, right?  Or leave the switch on all the time and only use the anti-spark key?  Or just pull the on/off switch?

@JLabs-- Do you have any input here?

Slight change of plans-- I'm tired of waiting for Enertion to restock their VESC so I'm going to go with the Torque VESC from diyelectricskateboard with the added male to male servo connector for receiver.  

I'm still waiting on the 6374 190Kv motor, which is out of stock.  The 6355 190Kv motor is in stock.  How much of a performance difference would there be if I went with the 6355 instead of the 6374?

Already ran into two situations. Firstly, the key for the keyshaft was too long and slightly too wide. I had to use my dremel to grind it down slightly. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/e/2ec45fb110c18c1a0468e1f9d6938f560a1bce97.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Now onto an issue I'm not so sure on... as I understand, you typically be want the motor wires to exit from the rear in order to allow for some play in the wires.  When I mount it this way on my torqueboard mount it seem so _very_ tight. Not only could the wires get crushed, but I could also see them touching the motor and shredding them.

The other option would be roc run them in front like this:

Hasn't anyone been through this with the torque mount?

Don't mind the tape-- Taking measurements for the enclosure. I think if I kick the wires straight out and have them loop around like the picture below, it should allow for enough slack in the wires to avoid getting pulled. Curious to hear thoughts tho. This is my first rodeo

I'm working through VESC setup. I got motor detection done and adjusted my settings. I'm able to control the motor with my keyboard, however, I can't get my receiver to control it. I feel like I'm probably overlooking something pretty simple... 

Any thoughts?

I don't have a VESC in front of me to verify but from the markings it looks like the servo connector is backwards. You have it correct on the receiver. Also did you set the min/max ppm values in the PPM tab? The values look standard. The auto wizard works quite well to set these values.

Also of your using Nico's firmware why not watt control no reverse with brake?

Basically click and play. You can then go to the throttle control tab and adjust the acceleration and brakes. Nico has good tutorials in the thread:

So I finally (almost) completed this build today. I got her out for a test ride, but it was short lived. Before final assembly and test ride I somehow fried my charging port while I was trying to put it in place. Decent pop and spark. I think I'm Gonna have to order another one.

I too kind her out for a quick test ride and it was great...until it wasn't. One of the motor wires got pulled into the motor and got ~50% shredded.

It still functions, however, I don't know how safe it is. Is it possible to solder over the strands, heat shrink and run like that?  Or will I need to re-wire or replace the motor?

Can you?
Yes totally. soldering and taping will work.

Should you?
No, not really. it would be better to replace it. 


In the Long run, I say fix the wire properly. if you're just trying to ride today, id say fuck it, solder and tape it up, then hit the road. Also, I'd recommend tying/taping your wires to your deck, so it doesn't happen again.

Might work:
