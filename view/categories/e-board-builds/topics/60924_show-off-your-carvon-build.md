I‚Äôd like to start this thread for all the new Carvon builds and specifically would like to see mostly pictures of it with some descriptions about the setup. 

There should be quite a few speed drive r‚Äôs out there now. Any other Carvon build is welcome too. 

Mine will be paired with surfrodz rkp 200mm trucks with 10mm to 8mm conversion kit. They match perfectly for size with the carvon truck. 
It will have the ESCapes and a 12s6p 30q battery pack which I will build myself. 
The deck might still change but with a modification for wheelbite clearance I would like to use this 46 inch dancer deck.

For testing purposes I will first mount them on the old deck with focboxes and a 12s2p 20700b battery pack. 

Looking forward to seeing all the new Carvon builds.

Are you using the dual ESCapes that have just been rolling out? How heavy does it weigh? Using a dancer deck encourages me to go for longer lengths as well

Yeah I‚Äôll be using the ESCapes as soon as I get them. stewii recently mentioned he had a problem sourcing some parts but that‚Äôs covered now. 
I don‚Äôt know what the dancer deck with just the wheels and motors weigh. The version one weighs 10.3kg with 107mm and a 12s2p sanyo battery. 

Yeah I wanted to use the dancer deck but I‚Äôm having doubts now. I really like the length but it seems like too much sanding is needed to avoid wheelbite with these 107‚Äôs. 
I could try 97mm but the other thing I notice is that I‚Äôm not so sure I‚Äôm liking top mount. 
With 107mm I‚Äôm pretty high off the ground which feels weird to me. Again trying 97mm might be better. 

I say go dancer anyway. I‚Äôd love to see more dancer builds myself. 

If it doesn‚Äôt work out I‚Äôll have a hummie deck with bigben enclosure on order. This way I‚Äôll have a nice low center of gravity with a drop through drop down deck and no hassle with wheelbite mods. It will look nice and clean but I‚Äôll have to of course give up the length and wider stance I was going after since it‚Äôs only a 40 inch deck.

Yeah I‚Äôd say to still go dancer. Nice I was actually asking bigben for his tesseract enclosure and forwarded @TinnieSinker the dimensions. The stance the dancer provides could be a deal breaker

how well do the front trucks line up with the carvons in the rear? do they come out alittler longer/wider? I've read it could be shortened down abit so they match up nicely but I'd prefer not to have to do that

They're close enough for me...haha haven't measured as they perform really well. I will say i put the spacer outside of the wheel to make it about 2 spacers lengths narrower.

It seems a lot of Carvon builds are in hiding. Why is that?
I‚Äôd like to see more v4 speed drives or are like me a lot of them disappointed due to overheating and low torque?

Mine is sitting on my work bench waiting for me to have time to pull it apart again. One side has a small amount of play in the stator, so I need to pull it apart and see whats causing it.
They are rebuilt from Exiledd_Top though, not from Carvon.

Once that is done I need to get a new 12s battery built, waiting for my DieBieMS to arrive.
Then need to wait for the new ESCapes to arrive to replace the Focboxs.
Then I need to wait for the hummie board to get delivered to bigben and sent out with a new enclosure to replace the Never summer deck I have now.

So a lot of waiting ...

I don't see why you couldn't. I don't though because I'm not trying to hurt myself even more than I already do.

alright thanks, Im asking because I like to do some sliding tricks but with my koowheel big wide rubber wheels is impossible, so Im looking for something that I could do a controllable slide on it

Never slid any board but my cutting board and a snowboard.

Cutting boards make for terrible snowboards.

Only thing I can see holding you back are that most wheels that fit the ABEC style core the Carvon mounts to are very grippy and harder to slide.

I see, that is what I wanted to know, thanks. Anyway I will go for it because it must be way more comfortable than regular build-in hub motor
