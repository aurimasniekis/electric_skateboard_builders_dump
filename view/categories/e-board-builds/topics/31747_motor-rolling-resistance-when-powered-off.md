I have just rode my current build and I am having what feels like increased motor drag than I'm used to. When the board is powered on or off and I turn the rear wheels manually it feels like the motors are slightly braking. I am running FOC on @Ackmaniac FW and used auto wizard on controller setup so I'm not sure it would be the beak engaging.

could be a shorted motor. Try unplugging all the phase leads (and make sure they're not touching) and see if it's still providing resistance.

Have you calibrated your controller in BLDC Tool? Could be applying a small amount of brake.

I did, I used the auto wizard.

That was my first thought but both motors are doing itvtge same amount.

So, both motors are slightly braking even when unplugged?

Unplugged no, connected to FOCBOX and powered on or off, yes.

i certainly hope not!! They are brand new. @Ackmaniac could I need to manual set the controller values instead of the wizard?

I can't imagine software has anything to do with it as it happens when your board is off as well.

You should check in bldc-tool what the ppm display shows. It should be in the area of 50%. With the deadband parameter you can adjust the sensitivity.

The ppm display is at 50% so I thought it would be correct. Thanks for the reply.

Could be the beginnings of a mosfet issue. It has happened to me. Where the mosfets phased out.

True that is odd. Try switching out for one fresh vesc, use the same settings and see if its the same.

If it is, it's a setting, if it's not it's a hardware issue

Which leads back to the mosfets.

Motors unplugged, no phase wires touching. No resistence
Motors plugged in, resistance  

Mosfets

I had that issue 2 weeks ago, it's posted somewhere in one of my threads. 

The issue was a shorted Focbox, you can easily tell if the Focbox is bad by unplugging a single phase wire at a time, when you unplug the shorted wire from the braked motor with the battery off and the motor disengages and spin freely then your Focbox needs to be replaced.

Mine was also brand new, I got it 2 months ago from Kaly batch 

I wonder if the newer ones had these issues resolved. 

Not sure if I should ship it to @johnnymeduse or try to fix it myself

I have removed my tension pulleys and the resistance is considerably less. Pretty sure that was the issue.

Seems odd to me being that the whole point of the idler/tensioner pulley is so that you can maintain tooth contact and run your belt tension looser. When I've used them I always got that result.

My belt tension is pretty loose. Not sure why it's happening. All I know is when I removed the tensioner the resistance decreases.

did you check the rolling resistance of the idler itself? Perhaps the bearing needs a cleaning

does the tensioner bend or pinch the belt? maybe too close to one of the pulleys?

Why not try to eliminate the whole wheel belt situation by removing the motor or popping off the belt and trying to test the motor without any load on it? That is what I would do anyway.. :D

@Jinra they are new bearings and nice and clean.

@psychotiller the idler may be to close to the motor pulley. That's the only place they would fit but do disrupt the path of the belt about 15mm.

@Martinsp I have already ruled out motor and FOCBOX issues.

Oh sorry, overlooked that probably.

It looks like the bearings then.. check wheels without load on them like the belt etc.

Have a picture with the idler on?

 These aren't the best pics put it's all I have right now. The idler is on the side in which the belt is pushed by the Idler pulley, not pulled.

It is hard to tell from the angle of your pictures Griff, Looks like we are talking about your mountain board w/ the motors mounted behind the rear axel?

If that is the case the jockey wheel or idler bearing should be on the upper/sky side of the mount. Is that how you have it? :neutral_face:
Is the first pic upside down?

Going by the coke bottle in the background it's right side up so idler is ground facing :hushed:
Also upward trajectory of splashes on mount in second pic indicate orientation :spy:

@scepterr These look like a nice solution.

They are linear bearings for 3d printers meant to move back and forth on a shaft, not spin around, so in this case it would not work for an islet Pulley.

@JLabs  Oh that sucks, totally overlooked them being linear lol, the dimensions caught my eye
@Cobber it's 8mm bore, 15mm OD, 24mm width

15mm is pretty small, it will increase belt wear/ resistance... :frowning:
It is just due to the angle the belt is bent around the roller.

_bigger roller = less angle_

I don't believe any one is wrapping the belt at an extreme distance with an idler. I don't see the few mm out of line these bearings are to cause a drastic reaction.

Read up on some engineering sites Griff, I'm also not the first to mention it. It has also been mentioned in the _I love idlers_ thread...
It is not a will it work, or won't it work thing. But it will play in to long term reliability and the efficiency of the system. That said in a industrial setting _0%_ failure is often the object. With DIY most are not so demanding the odd failure is accepted and reduced life span is often the norm.

What would you say is the ideal distance from both pulleys to the idler? 20-25mm on each side??

I am very familiar with the principals of engineering and the effects of a fixed location of stress applied to the belts by the idler. My reply was referring to the fact that we only use about 15% of the bearings circumference. If the belts were wrapping around the idlers and contacting 50% or more of the circumstance then I agree the stress applied to the belts in a small area would cause much more concern.
