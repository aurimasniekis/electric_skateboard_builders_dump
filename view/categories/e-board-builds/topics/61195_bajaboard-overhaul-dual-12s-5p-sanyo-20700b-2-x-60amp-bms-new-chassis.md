Hi everyone 

It‚Äôs been a minute since I posted a build, so here we GO. 

My friend has a BajaBoard and wanted to upgrade it, the board has a lot of power but the delivery of this power it is just untamable so he decide to give to me to bring it into the Kaly.nyc family :smiling_imp:  

Here is the BEAST 

![received_2225041134173537|422x500](upload://agWYUSSQalATvMJ6tUHDb77za75.jpeg)

This Board was discussed back in a post [Here ](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/baja-board-owners/49131)

The first major problem is the Battery, since he had already spot welded a 12S-10P Sanyo 20700B battery and that is a HUGE!!!  Pack, also super stiff and not safe, it was made in the conventional method. 
Check the review on Cells by [Mooch ](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/sanyo-20700b-4000mah-20700-bench-test-results-a-peek-at-the-future.775809/) 

![image|257x500](upload://ySqsj9lpbJMx3C2Ji1URnmt5UZv.jpeg)


I opted for a more manageable configuration Dual 12S-5P running as parallel Packs. this is 120 Cells :scream: and there is no way I don‚Äôt take extra measures to make this baby monster as safe as it can be. It is an 1800 Watts/hr :exploding_head:


First step taking apart  the BIG pack 
:face_with_symbols_over_mouth: after a few hours.

![image|375x500](upload://cDKpoUdnsAddpcjBBb12E4NAncl.jpeg)

 Now the only way to be safe, is to put a fuse on each Cell, so after another few hours :flushed:

![image|375x500](upload://rBG9U6WP0cKJU9sXSLcT9o5eu1e.jpeg)

![image|375x500](upload://zlKMggsxWH9BuFmwFQ7LMsalVYn.jpeg)

For the packs I use heavy duty hot glue and strips of [3M](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-VHB-Structural-Glazing-Tape-B23F/?N=5002385+3291242888&rt=rud) structural glazing tape to keep the packs bonded to each other next just wrap around with good old Gorilla tape :wink: for structural stability.

![image|666x500](upload://pCjaFaITj7W18jvB9QVVPsHdJl1.jpeg)

Once the battery  is out of the way, I was free to focus on the other major issue on this model of the Bajaboard, The CHASSIS :grimacing: 

![image|374x500](upload://eNMPv5Umn08LqHyQWEZnJPvGpWn.jpeg)

I don‚Äôt know why this chassis is lacking any resemblance of rigidity whatsoever. 

There is no way I‚Äôm putting those huge packs in that twisted thing. It has to GO!!!!

New chasis :grin::heart_eyes::sunglasses:

![image|666x500](upload://mW8eUtX8xHUpLLnEldeOZcuvFTw.jpeg)

Measured the Original ‚Äúchassis‚Äù and went with a thicker aluminum gauge, after bending it to proper shape, it came out GREAT !!! 

![image|375x500](upload://sSq30hmm87a3C3xkBFNqysxErO4.jpeg)

 Now with a more structurally sound foundation, I feel much better to put that 1800 Watts/hr pack :innocent:

RIGID :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
![image|374x500](upload://qvrMdvqNVs80QEyK0AkZu7SAnyY.jpeg)

The mounting holes for the rivets are a pain to properly align but after some measuring is all good.

Next
Will be to equipped it with new brains :panda_face::panda_face::panda_face:
We are using the SKYfly VESC6.4 since this are waterproof :crossed_fingers::crossed_fingers::crossed_fingers: Also a great price and good way to test this bad boys. 

I‚Äôll continue in the next few days since this is my progress so far.

I see you are using smaller width nickel stipa as fuses. At what current will they melt? Did you do calculations for your setup and choose the fuses after that?

The fuses will fail at 30 Amps after 5-8 seconds
Perfect for this application, since is a worse case scenario prevention solution. 

Cells after test

Only shrink wrap burned, isolator still intact. 

Need to make sure your pack is structurally braced without using the nickel strips for that purpose.

That seems like a good amount for the fuse. Do you have any measurements on heat on high discharge, 10-20A?
How thick and wide are the nickel strips for this? (I assume you are using pure nickel strips)

There will be an update on this coming up soon but I have decided to go with the alloy wheels for this to eliminate any unnecessary movement between the original plastic wheels. Im also thinking upgrading Into their new shocks system , its more durable and it can be lock down for stiffness... Lastly maybe creating different plate and putting in 200 KV motors,  there is plenty of torque but while Ernesto is 200 lbs I'm 250. Also new sets of lights and LEDs will be put in. Dual 4000 lumens bike lights for riding off road üêºü§ò

So i stay off this topic because it was more painful than anything to have a board that is such a beast and yet.. kinda sad to own

let me describe the differences where I started and where I ended
So I got the Bajaboard from Joseph who bought it like 4 months before me from someone in NYC.. the cost was about 2700 for 2016 board that was sitting somewhere for about a year.. I told Joseph if he is going to sell to keep me posted because I like to be the first in line, since I talk to Bajaboard back in 2015 or so about special version then in 2016 and 2017 but never pulled the plug on buying one directly from them due to half year wait time.. I always thought this board is right for me and while Joseph and he is like 160 lbs very fit he knew there was one problem. The 8s Battery in the Baja was done for for.. I told Joseph about Kevin Dark, Damon and Ernesto in case these guys wanted to make him a battery. He contacted Kevin and paid him for a battery I calculated he could easily fit 10s8p in of 20700b and that was the plan but Kevin took his sweet time and after nearly 2 months of nothing happening, 

Joseph told me he requested money back. Even before all of this he asked me if I would make battery for him but I told him I don't make batteries every day hence I don't want the responsibilities.. I build batteries since 2017 but doing it for someone when you know it might bite you in the ass so I said no.. I told Joseph to go to NYC and meet up with us and talk to Ernesto to have a look at it.  One and probably bigger reason was me trying to convince Joseph get a @Kaly board   with extended battery so he can keep riding with me. (Didn't know back then he was stationed in Virginia for very short period of time and moved back to Seattle in July) So we made plans and met up in Bronx at the shop Kaly to look at the board and also try one of the Kaly's  it didn't take a while and he decided on Carver 2 in 1 with extra battery that Ernesto made for him So while still having his Bajaboard and waiting for his Kaly board I was almost certain he will not let it go as he was posting videos of him riding on trails and beaches.. but kept saying I can't pass 10 miles on it etc.. then He brought it back to NYC and we went for another ride and I tried it.. on full power in  Central park, original ESC, original remote the board was pure maddens.. I didn't have problem handling the power of it but I go cut out after about 300 yards while climbing minor hill.. the battery
so Month after this Joseph now with his board called me and ask me if I still want the Baja and I said yes.. he said he will let it go for same price and include some extra tires for burnout and I told him I give him 200 more for him to drive up and meet in NYC for a ride.. that was me appreciating  his gesture.. (he got into accident because he felt a sleep while driving up, damaged his car a bit) he hit a van that was some undocumented driver and he felt really bad so he was not reporting anything as there was no damage to the van and dind't want to ruin the life of the guy driving the van.. we met, I got the board and we went for a ride.  On our Kaly's...

Two days after I rode the Baja for first time since I bought from him and while tried to turn as I expected normal skateboard.. the board wouldn't act like that and I felt.. felt on the remote and broke it.. it would still work but I had no display.. so called Baja and got new remote, new battery and new spare LCD screen then i Sat down and realized that there is something big that has to change .. I need to put new cells in but I need to put a lot of cells to be able to haul around 250 LBS fat Panda.. so I ordered 100 cells of 20700B from my source and waited for them to come .. since the baja is 8s I needed 10s BMS .. so I bought 2 huge 10s BMS each for 150AMPS.. so huge that they couldn't possibly fit in.... then the process started.. I made one solid 10s10p pack of 20700b cells, pure 42AMH of blasting energy.. took the old battery out, put in it.. put the BMS in and turned it on.. They are using 4 10 AWG cables 2- and 2+ running from the huge pack they had in so I did the same thing.. but plugged only  one pair.. turn the board on.. got blue blue light on it's ECU (yes it has ECU) that is connected via relay to battery and power and 4 Kelly ESC's  and it clicked and then I went to turn the remote on and then it clicked again and the ECU was fried.. I called Baja and they said the possibly all 4 of the wires have to be connected but since I was not aware of that.. supposedly this was the cause.. so now came the question what to do.. wait for another ECU and trying to squeeze this giant pack into the frame or take all out and put my own Stewii's in and and redo it.. 

Since I'm not the most handy man.. and sort of not too detail oriented when working with hands.. I decided to dump this onto Ernesto but before I ordered extra cells, made 12s10p out of it in one piece and was ready to put in but noticed there is no room.. there is also major flex of the think chassis they are using because I removed 2 of the brackets that fit the smaller original battery but also work as support beams.. basically this battery was a ticking time bomb so I hit the road and dump all this on Ernesto.. told him to take time and he told me he has FVESC 6.6 4 of them which was too big for his application. the good thing on those is they are in waterproof housing and hence can be mounted outside.. Ernesto agreed that the chassis is too thin and too flexi and hit up his contact and made the chassis for me, put the bajaboard together with 4 Flipsky 6.6 and remade my pack from one 12s10p into 2x12s5p using 2x 60 A BMS.. 2 months in or so and the board was ready to leave the shop.. or was it.. so I got the board back.. noticed one wheel had flat tire.. so I fixed that.. that same night I came from NYC i rode and nearly face landed on concrete because the plastic wheel spun out of the axle.. the wheel and axles move together and the plastic was not able to withstand my weight or the torque.. I traveled about 60 yards from my car since this happened.. so called Baja again ordered new wheels Alloy but it took them about 3 months to make it so they send me also plastic wheels 4 of them.. I put them on and during first 3 ride all 4 wheels were gone..  then Baja sent me some extra 4 wheels free of charge ..I tried to adjust the arms and toes and camber so it won't damage the wheels but again 2 of the wheels wore off..  they use tiny one inch or so pentagon that is moving 10 inch wheel which is too much force centered on one spot.. the plastic gets deformed and then totally melts while the axle and pentagon spin creating heat to the point the wheel completely falls of the axles.. .. after I got the alloy wheels I also got new shocks, new arms, new axles, new bearings.. .. cost.. I can't even describe.. if I wouldn't be so driven in the believe that this board was something I believed in to be the coolest shit.. yeah for about half a mile before another things break.. too many moving parts, I'm clearly too heavy for it.. I took it of road and broke the frame, part made of soft Aluminum.. I fixed that but I won't take it off roading again..not till I lose at least 50 LBS.. 

if  and only if you are thinking of spending money on this board and it's your dream and you really want it, buy it because you would regret  that you didn't but when you buy it and you own it .. you will also regret buying it! If you could have access to free parts for life it's fun board but if you truly take it off road, it will slowly fall apart..  if I say I could buy 2 brand new Kaly's for what I paid for this.. I wouldn't be lying.. then there is the photo of the go card wheels you can put on it.. more parts needed and extra 1000 but that image you riding on the beach in the sunset on your baja.. for about 20 yards before it breaks..  Thanks for reading.. Archee - Esk8riders

Readable version:

[quote="Nanorider, post:18, topic:61195, full:true"]
I stay off this topic because it is super painful to have such a beast of a board that is sad to own.

Here's the basic story:

I got the Bajaboard from Joseph who bought it 4 months before me from someone in NYC. The cost was about 2700 for 2016 board that was sitting somewhere for about a year. I told Joseph that he should keep me posted because I like to be the first in line. I had been talking to Bajaboard since 2015 about a special version  but never pulled the plug on buying one directly from them due to half year wait time. I always thought "this board is right for me". The issue was, Joseph is only 160lbs. 

The 8s Battery in the Baja was done for for, so I told Joseph about Kevin Dark, Damon, and Ernesto in case these guys wanted to make him a battery. He contacted Kevin and paid for a battery. I had calculated that he could easily fit 10s8p in of 20700b and that was the plan. Unfortunately, Kevin took his sweet time and after nearly 2 months of nothing happening, Joseph told me he requested money back. 

Even before all of this he asked me if I would make battery for him but I told him I don‚Äôt make batteries every day hence I don‚Äôt want the responsibilities. I've built batteries since 2017, but doing it for someone when you know it might bite you in the ass later.

I told Joseph to go to NYC and meet up with us and talk to Ernesto to have a look at it. This was mostly me trying to convince Joseph get a @Kaly board with extended battery so he can keep riding with me. 

What I didn't know at the time was that he was stationed in Virginia for a very short period of time and moved back to Seattle in July. So, we made plans and met up in Bronx at the shop to have Kaly take a look at the board. This also allowed for the opportunity to try one of the Kaly‚Äôs, and it didn‚Äôt take a while for him to decide on a Carver 2 in 1 with the extra battery that Ernesto made for him. 

While still having his Bajaboard and waiting for his Kaly board I was almost certain he wouldn't let it go as he was posting videos of him riding on trails and beaches, but he kept saying I can‚Äôt get more than 10 miles out of it. 

He brought it back to NYC and we went for another ride and I tried it. On full power in Central park, the original ESC, original remote the board was all pure madness. I didn‚Äôt have a problem handling the power of it but it cut out after about 300 yards while climbing a minor hill.

One month after this, Joseph, now with his board, called me and asked if I still wanted the Baja and I said yes. He said he would let it go for same price and include some extra tires for burnout. I told him I'd give him 200 more for him to drive up and meet in NYC for a ride. We met, I got the board, and we went for a ride. 

Two days after I rode the Baja for first time since I bought from him I fell on the remote and broke it. I called Baja and got new remote, new battery and new spare LCD screen. I then sat down and realized that there is something big that has to change... 

I ordered 100 cells of 20700B from my source and waited for them to come. I bought 2 huge 10s BMS at 150AMPS each, both way too big. I made one solid 10s10p pack of 20700b cells, pure 42AMH of blasting energy. Same thing happened. Turns out the ECU was fried‚Ä¶ I called Baja and  ended up with two options:

1) wait for another ECU and trying to squeeze this giant pack into the frame 
or 
2) take it all out and put my own Stewii‚Äôs in and and redo it

Since I‚Äôm not the most handy man, I decided to dump this onto Ernesto. But, before I ordered extra cells, I  made a 12s10p out of it. Unfortunately though, there was no room. There was also major flex of the chassis  because I removed 2 of the brackets that fit the smaller original battery. This was a time bomb so I just sent it to Ernesto and told him to take his time. He told me that he had 4 FVESC 6.6, but they were too big for his application. The good thing was the waterproof housing so they could mounted outside. Ernesto agreed that the chassis is too thin and too flexi and hit up his contact to make the chassis for me. They put it all together, and I got the board back. 

The same night I got it back, I streeted my face on concrete because the plastic wheel spun out of the axle. I called Baja again and ordered new wheels, but it took them about 3 months to make it so they sent me 4 plastic wheels. I put them on and after 3 rides all 4 wheels were gone, so I got more. I tried to adjust the arms and toes and camber so it wouldn't damage the wheels, but it didn't help. 

After I got the alloy wheels I also got new shocks, new arms, new axles, new bearings. The cost was INSANE. The issue is it just has too many moving parts, and I‚Äôm clearly too heavy for it. I took it off road and broke the frame. I fixed that but I won‚Äôt take it off roading again unless I lose 50lbs. 

Please, only buy this board if you're willing to put up with it and the insane cost. If you had free parts for life it‚Äôs fun, but it will slowly fall apart. I could've bought 2 Kaly's for what I spent on this.

More parts are always needed. Imagine this: you're riding on the beach into the sunset on your baja‚Ä¶ for about 20 yards before it breaks.

 Thanks for reading.

Hi everyone,

I am new on this site‚Ä¶ I have a GX4 2018.08 Bajaboard. I got it 2nd hand with 17miles on it. Unfortunately about 2 weeks ago I decided to tinker with it and take a look under the ‚Äúhood‚Äù so to speak. I had just finished cleaning out the battery compartment and was putting the 900Wh 30Q battery pack back when it happened‚Ä¶ I did not pay to much attention to this little white & frayed wire coming out from the pack‚Ä¶ I should have known better (I am an Aerospace Engineer so I am a perfectionist with OCD). so as I was putting the batter back into the bay, the little white wire touched the ‚Äúcontactor‚Äù.

so now I am not 100% sure if my battery pack is still any good or where the this little white wire is to be attached to, but it seems like it is a loop that was not suppose to be out side the battery pack‚Ä¶ Nor do I know if the mother board is working properly since it seems to keep vibrating on me when I power it on.

So at this point I am giving up and looking to upgrade the mother board to the 2019 MB w/ Tank mode. buying the 1.1KWh battery pack, I am also looking to get the 110A controllers, the 16T pulley. I am not sure if I want to go with their motors just yet. does anyone here have any suggestions on motor upgrades? I want to stay with 6374, but I am not sure which motor would be an upgrade to what Baja is offering since they have not revealed the specs to their motor. I have asked, but they are staying silent‚Ä¶

my playground is sunny silicon valley CA where the weather is always nice. and I am looking for more top speed. I use my board to commute to work and everywhere in Santa Clara county.

YES I am used to speeds in the high 30mps to low 40mph. I first started speeding with a VISA Dirtsurfer about 15years ago when only gas was available.

All suggestions on upgrading the motors would be welcomed.

Thanks
```

Baja has proprietary motors because of the mounts they are using.. 
the relay and mobo needs to have both wires from battery connected otherwise it would short the mobo.. happened to me and hence I went with different ESC what so ever .. Since Baja models change back and forth with different gearing etc etc.. it's hard to say which would be ideal for you.. if you put more powerful motors and meaning more AMPS you will lose range also the battery output has to support it. My rebuild is different.. is it ideal.. definitely not.. it's more for speed than off road The issue with Baja setup is that they have grounding running through the entire board.. so anything you touch is conductive there.. .. if you see the Mobo light up and your remote connects.. and hear click on the relay you should be ok..  just that entire concept is stupid..

Thank you Nanorider,

I have been in contact with Baja.
They might give me access to the schematic to their Motherboard as long as I am willing to take the risk of damaging it.  (I am more than happy to sign a non-disclosure agreement with them for this access)

In fact Baja has been really good about getting back to me on repairs and upgrading my current GX4 into a full blown Pantera.. 
Although the Panterea has been optimized, they did limit it and it can be unlocked even further.

I should be getting my upgrade parts around May 20th... looking forward to my build.

I will post.

well I'm not sure what pantera is running in terms of ESC but if they use 12s 190kv motors 1:4 gearing.. at 4wd you are looking easily at 50+ mph at those 10" tires.. the question is if the mechanical parts will support it.. Alessandro is really cool about it.. I think he designed that ECU as it has his signature on it.. thought the Kelly ESC are known to support more amps but limit to 10s only  There is also a rumor of completely new Baja coming out soon

I spotted a 'g5 entry level' on a pre-order form somewhere on the site

I also have to thank you for your long post, you saved me serious cost and pain on my planned g3x mod...

no longer 'ignore the cost' 80xx motor, 13s quad focbox' now 'sort cut outs on stock'

yeah  13s won't do much good on FB because of the limit  57V and with 4wd there is a lot of current coming back in especially if fully charged.. I love the board for its madness but I do prefer my Kaly's because you know shit won't break..  best Archee
