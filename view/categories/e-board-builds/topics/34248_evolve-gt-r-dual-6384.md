New board from Evolve?

6384? Now that sounds more my style. Where did you find this?

Meh. it looks like they have "evolved" to 63mm motors and reverse kingpin trucks, - the DIY standard. Looks like they want to copy the enertion style precision trucks - with the cutouts in the truck hanger. 

Unless they are doing something new with their batteries/speed controllers, there does not seem to be anything new in this design. 

If this design is indeed for a new product, they need to lift their game - or better yet, put a representative on the forum, so we can help them build a better board!

Ha!

They've taken the R designation. That can only mean one thing: capitalization on the recent increase in interest in racing. 

Won't mean shit if they keep using those awful prismatic packs they've been using. Good news is it looks like they're still using the same deck and box configuration, which means i can still mod these. And with any luck they're using a standard bolt hole pattern which could mean motor upgrades if they have a bad run on their motors. 

Expect braking issues of some flavor. Could be a new unexpected flavor but i'll bet there is some kind of issue.

If it isn't dual diagonal then how in the goddamn hell do they fit dual 80mm+ cans on the same truck?  Is it still those 300mm trucks?

what cells though? if they're using shit laptop cells i'll still be fixing thier boards. IF they're using 30Qs then Enertion might be in a bit of trouble since there would be some kind of actual competition on performance here in this 10S space for once. 

I'll get the popcorn.

Ugly board. Looks like one of the dozen or more chinese models out there. Look at those trucks. Seems that the only reason they've surfed these forums is to imitate eboarders trends. First Trampa jumped over the VESC proprietary camp, now Evolve is bedding ABEC 11, and judging by this trucks, it will be the turn for Ronin to become their new mistress soon.

They'll need to develop wider precision trucks to mount dual 6384s.  Ronins no less.  Not going to be cheap at all... 

Will be interesting to see if anything comes of this.

pretty sure they would be doing their own trucks, they have the scale where they don't need to source from others.

faster board huh.. so now we get gold plated 200kv racerstar motors? because that's the most logical progression if you study their patterns. 

don't hold your breath people. a faster Evolve means minimum mechanical upgrades and more battery sag.

Surely they are not that stupid. I would expect them to switch to 18650s with their next board. Faster speeds won’t do much, I have their trucks on 6355 190kv and once you pass 27mph it becomes scary. Sure, you can tighten the hell out of those trucks but then what’s the point of a double kingpin setup if you can’t carve like a boss because you made them so stiff to go really fast..

Apparently, 18650 cells, wider trucks and a stiffer deck than the bamboo GT.

I've made an entire business out of putting better packs in their boards. 

The GTX is a bamboo with a 10ah prismatic and gold plated motors. They've already been that stupid. 

THE GT-R will be a GTX with 18650s, provided they listened when the entire world told them their fear of 18650s was nothing more than a stunt to justify cheaper, shittier packs to increase their margins. It would be a magical work of magic if they went with a 10S4P and boosted the ESC and put 200kv motors on there to finally.. after all this time... hit that coveted 2014 standard of 27mph. 

its a carver, so yeah, i don't know wtf they are doing unless they are trying to come into raptor territory with a standard RKP on 220mm+ trucks, which i doubt, because that would mean using something other than thier $7 generic hanger. 

a faster carver. That alone is stupid unless they plan to ship stronger ankles out with their boards.

i don't even know wtf they are doing anymore. I'm so confused by them...

I'm a goddamned psychic. 

But its worse than even i imagined. they went with the Samsung 35E over the 30Q which was a stupid choice for what basically amounts to a ~45 amp board.  In a 4P config the 35E is only stated to comfortably put out 8 amps, which would be 32 amps total. that's "comfortable" output, mind you, so assuming the cells will happily exceed their nominal stated output like a lot of cells will, you're going to still see sag. Maybe even as bad as it was with the pop-tart pouches. But then they go on to talk up all the amps their board draws when climbing hills and shit? I mean how can they climb a hill on that cell and talk about "feeling the difference" with a straight face?

I have to assume that they walked into Samsung's cell show room and got confused with all the mellon-berry flavored cells in there. Even the aging 25R (sour apple) would have been a better choice. Oh how about the good old HE2 (root beer) from LG?

Yes, all of my cells are referred to by flavor. It's just a thing i'm doing.

I think it's a fair assessment that Evolve think the 35E is better in their case. With their own bms and ESC and this specific dual 5065 140kv setup aimed at 24mph and slower than DIY acceleration, it doesn't need much current to ride comfortably. Problem arise for those who wants to upgrade their GTR. It basically is the same situation as the GTX, battery swap + unity + bypass +motor swap. So no consideration for DIYer at all.

I like the bamboo GTR a lot. The only thing that blows was the speed.

it's not even about the DIYers. I'm rage typing all about them right now because in spite of the mountain of evidence i (and a lot of others by this point) have provided both them and the world that the 30Q is the absolute best option (performance for price) for their power level, they have gone with something that belongs in a rechargeable screwdriver. I wouldn't even put that cell in a vape pen.  It was money. They got a deal on some shitty utility cell, and went with that. Their videos for the GTX were similar in mind-set, a guy holding up the bamboo cell vs the GTX cell and was like "this one is bigger".  

Those cells are going to run pretty warm on hills, and I'll bet the new packs have similar life spans to their old ones.

Two questions for you... One that 30Q is the best, what are your thoughts on the VTC5A if cost is $3.50/cell shipped compared to 30Q? 

Secondly, I think it would be cool if they offered their flex PCB that we could spot weld our P groups and solder directly to a variety of flex PCBs if they would make them, with breakouts on the end to connect up any BMS. Is this something you would be interested in if they offered it?

so you can make one battery instead of two, or the three they've been making.

At evolve's scale the per cell difference would likely be negligible, but i guess every cent counts for bonuses.

Thier system is set up for 10S 4P in a flat pack design. I'd probably need to have my own printed for 12S in a trapezoidal (5P) or rombus (6P) stacking pattern. I'm curious how much it would cost to have a bunch of these copper ribbons made though. I mean i'd do it if the cost of entry isn't stupid.
