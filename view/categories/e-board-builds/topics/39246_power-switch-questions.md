Hi guys! I am starting my first build and I just ordered my encloser and the only way I will be able to turn on my board is using a power switch. I saw power switches like this one products/on-off-power-switch-electric-skateboard , but its just to expensive. People also told me to make a anti spark loop key which is also still a option. But I was wondering if I could use one like this, https://www.ebay.com/itm/5x-SPST-Toggle-Switch-Wires-On-Off-Metal-Mini-Small-Automotive-Boat-Car-Truck/182233493777?hash=item2a6df67111:g:NZIAAOSwpuFaFABB or this, https://www.ebay.com/itm/POWER-BUTTON-SWITCH-FOR-SELF-BALANCE-WHEEL-BOARD-SCOOTER-HOVERBOARD-M-BWP11/231812255122?hash=item35f9164d92:g:2t8AAOSwKtlWla5R, Please leave your thoughts if it will work in the comments. Thanks!

Hi @Caleb1 welcome! You need to read more because this question is regularly addressed around here... 

We run high voltage and voltage likes eating connectors. Short story, you **need** either a loop key XT90S or an anti spark switch. Or fuse and relay system, I've seen it work but it is big and bulky. 

So the switch linked works but don't cut to the job alone.

@Caleb1 or better yet get a BMS with an e-switch, or a battery pack that has a BMS with an e-switch

I believe @goldenHusky has some very nice anti spark switches for sale and for cheap compared to the  DIYelectric skateboard ones

This switch circuit works very well. I use it with my both boards and no problems at all.

@Caleb1 that switch is rated for just 6A!! You'll be pulling like 60A+ so it'll melt that switch :thumbsup:
