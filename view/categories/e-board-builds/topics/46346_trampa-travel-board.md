I just wrapped up my second build a (hopefully) air-travel safe board based of the trampa carver.
This originally started as a "I need to scratch my trampa itch while waiting for my @Kaly build board" and morphed into a board that I hope I can take with me when I fly.

Being that its a travel board I was looking for decent performance and range but nothing record breaking and settled for 4 x 5S 5000mAH Lipo which I thought are under the 100 wHR limit -_-.. I will be swapping them out for smaller cells before flying

Loving the build.  The thing is faster, has longer range, carves better then my BGT.  Until Kaly's board arrives its probably going to stay my primary board.

I'd like to thank the community, tons of information and lots of helpful folks here.  Wouldn't had been possible without the group.  I'd like to also call a few individuals that really made this build experience great.

Big thanks to @torqueboards for backing up their warranty after the VESC failed on a different build.  Although it took a while Dexter had been great on making sure things were made right.  The Vesc are running on foc now with no issues

Shout out the @trampa, Frank had been quick to answer all the questions I had and boy are their stuff high quality and man do that ship fast

Also a big thank you to @psychotiller He helped me with my first built and had been really helpful and patient with all my questions. Oh he also supplied the antispark switches for this built.

Lastly @Ackmaniac whos firmware seemed to have zapped all my vesc issues.  I blew through 2 vesc and 1 focboxs running sensored BLDC.  Now I am running 2 dual builds on focs 12s and 10s with zero issues.

Sweet build, only suggestion I would have is to cut away the shrink around the fets to let em breathe more in the box.

good point!
I'll probably do that when i get myself some sugru to better water proof the box.
Also I am in Boston so heat really isn't an issue right now :stuck_out_tongue:

Quick-ish method, cut a chunk of bicycle tube, epoxy it the inside of the box to seal the cut holes, poke a small hole in the tube for each wire and pull them through. I think I saw this on a @trampa build somewhere here ðŸ˜‹

Interesting.... originally i was going to use wire glands, these are actually rated for waterproofing
I already built the box.  
Even got your XT90 mounting plate on it.
These will fit focboxes no problem.
BUT..... no last time I checked still no focboxes from black friday sale in my mailbox :frowning:

Quick update.  
This board had gone through many iteration but have recently made the hop from US to Taiwan.
I didn't have any issues carry 4 x 4500mah 6s lipo cells.
HK was the only custom that actually did the math to figure out it was under 100whr
The deck was checked the trucks and battery were carry on.
Takes about an hour to break apart \ put back together.
