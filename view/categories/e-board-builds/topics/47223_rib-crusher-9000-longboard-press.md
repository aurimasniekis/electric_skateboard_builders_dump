The rib mold is made of wood, not MDF like in the rendering. 

Thoughts? Open to suggestions :slight_smile:

Nice press :) It will take lot of work to make it, but it is deffinitey doable :) I have made one few years ago, but it was much easier, i didnt use the Bottle Jacks...

Make sure that the frame will endure :)

I was about to say that :).  I was thinking x2 pieces of 1in thick wall conduit.  Use a pipe bender to make an angle on each piece so they meat in the middle, then drill and bolt in 3 or 4 places on the handle, maybe wrap in tennis racket grip for comfort.

Are you planning to make a one-off deck or to manufacture?  Have you already made your mold?

Years ago, I used to manufacture snowboards.  At the time, there were only a handful of companies using converted snow ski presses.  I developed several processes including a press similar to the configuration you posted.

The process that worked the best for me was a pressure bag system.  On a snowboard, the bottom surface, that rides against the snow, is the most critical.  I used my bottom molds as before, except the top molds were no longer critical.  I made new top molds to incorporate clearance for an air bag.  Then a polished piece of 22 gage aluminum was placed between the air bag and the snowboard.  The actual mold surface in contact with the resin/fiber matrix was the polished aluminum.

You can make the air bag out of waterbed mattress material.  I incorporated a schrader valve into my air bag so that it could be pressurized.  Initially I used a tire chuck to arrive at my ideal pressure of 12PSI.

Too much pressure and too much resin was pushed out causing a dry laminate.  Not enough pressure results voids and a resin-rich laminate.

You will need a substantial structure to support the force of the air bag pushing the mold open.  12PSI  doesn't sound like much, but assuming an 8" deck width for your 36" deck, that's 3,456 pounds of force that your press structure needs to support (Force=Pressure*Area).

Cheers,

Joe

It's actually 11" wide which puts me at 21,183N of force (~4765lb) or 2.38 tons. Tension calculators & stress analysis in Fusion 360 say the 6 pieces of 2x6 themselves can hold up to ~7613lb but I have no idea how much the wood screws will take. 

This will by no means produce a perfect fiberglass composite material which isn't even needed for any kind of longboard. The press I made with one of my teachers a few years ago had less support material and still withstood enough pressure to produce a high-quality deck. The decks which that press produced were still extremely strong.

*by the way, I really appreciate your input. Expect me to ask questions, you're the exact kinda guy I need ;)

Just trying to present options.  I also try to do things better every time I do them.

With that being said...

I'm not a fan of wood screws.  I would through-bolt it.

What I think is important in building a structure like pictured:

The horizontal beams will experience a purely bending load, supported by whatever fasteners used to connect the horizontal beams to the vertical beams.  The load is transmitted from the horizontal beams to the vertical beams through the fasteners.  In the case of the horizontal beams, this load is perpendicular to the wood grain.

The vertical beams beams will be in tension, but will experience a bending force  as the horizontal beams start to deflect.  The deflection of the vertical beams doesn't concern me as much as the loads transferred from the fasteners into vertical beams.  This load is parallel to the wood grain.  My concern is that the wood will split.

The composites will take the form of any shape in which they are supported in during the curing process.  Any distortion of the press will allow distortion of the mold.  All the time spent building accuracy into your molds will be lost if everything flexes and distorts in use.  Ultimately, maintaining the shape of the mold is most important to me.

Accuracy of the bottom of a snowboards is the  most critical.  I wanted the bottom mold to not distort at all.  Ultimately, the shape of the top of a snowboard is irrelevant and was dictated by the shape of the core, which was dictated by the flex pattern.

Wood is cheap, I see three vertical beams on each side and two horizontal beams.  I would add three more shorter horizontal beams to fill the voids between the existing two horizontal beams on both the top and bottom.   This is not for load bearing purposes, it is solely to prevent flexing of the press, which is translated into the mold.

For assembly, I would glue and bolt everything together.  Use a lot of Titebond III wood glue on every joint that doesn't need to move.  Make sure that the entire surface is covered with glue.  After the joint is made, the excess glue is easily cleaned up with a wet towel.  It is better to have excess glue squeeze out than it is to have voids.  Lightly clamp everything together so you don't squeeze out too much of the wood glue.

I believe it would work best to drill and install the fasteners after the glue has cured.  I would use 1/2" (12mm) minimum, 5/8" (16mm) preferred, bolts with a shoulder long enough to pass almost all the way through all five beams.  I wouldn't be the least bit upset if you opted for 3/4" (20mm) bolts.  I'm suggesting these large sizes, not for load bearing purposes, but for support against the inside of the hole drilled through the beams.  Surface area is the key here.  The smaller the fasteners, the easier the wood will split.

Try to drill the holes to achieve as tight a fit with the bolts as possible.  Lastly, I would apply ample amount of wood glue or even resin inside the bolt holes upon assembly of the fasteners.  This is to provide maximum surface contact between the wood and fasteners.  Apply multiple coats to account for absorption.

I would try to avoid using fully-threaded bolts or all-thread,  threads do not make a good load bearing surface.  If that is all that is available, you can install steel tubing as the load bearing surface and pass the fasteners through the tube to provide clamping force only.

Good luck with your build, let me know if I can help.

Cheers,

Joe

Thank you so much for the advice. I'll be sure to use lug nuts instead of screws. The only problem is that I don't have an 8" drill to drill through 5 layers of 2x6.

Suggestion: 

If any two ribs share a profile, you can cut just one out. Temporarily screw the rib you just cut out to the next one and use a router with a follower bit to ensure that they are exactly the same. This works really well with decent plywood, hardwood, or MDF. If you use plywood and it has voids, then I would not use this method as the follower bearing could go into a void.
This is how I constructed the ribs for my press and it held up really well for ~60-70 decks.

Unfortunately, there are zero ribs that share the same profile. The whole deck has 3 dimensional curves (rocker, wheelflares, w-concave, single tail).

Sounds like a challenge!

I don't know how much this will be needed, but I do have another thought:
When building a canoe using the cedar strip method, you have to spend time smoothing each of the ribs of the form to make sure that the strips follow the intended curve. If you cut with a jig-saw for all of your ribs, the profile will be perpendicular to the face that you cut from. Getting a smooth path going down the length of the press will be a bit of a challenge that I am not quite certain how you would solve. With the canoe, I used a block plane, but that was easy enough since all the curves were convex. 

I am not exactly sure how much of a concern this will be for you, but I thought that I'd throw it out there...

Yes! I am aware of that. That's why each rib is only .75" thick. Once everything is cut and mounted on the boards, ill go to town with a dowel wrapped with 60 grit sand paper and level everything out.

Yeah i think it will be. Because the first one broke twice before i rebuilt it. 

Eventually i'll build a steel one. Part of the reason i build wooden ones is because i sort of hope i can come up with an idiot proof long-lasting design for DIYers for under $500 total in cost to build. 

my press was under $400 all in i believe, but it's already cracking. I think this time i'm going to plane the lumber for better lamination. But that will require a planer which a lot of people don't have.

used 2x8 pressure treated lumber, laminated 8 layers in an alternating pattern to get a big box on legs that can take a 47" max mold. Outer dimensions are 62.5" x 48", you can infer cost of lumber from that, then 2 dozen 4" screws per layer, then 2 dozen carriage bolts through the whole thing. Then 2 six ton jacks.

and it still cracked. 

so my next step is to plane it and laminate it proper with tightbond III

47" is damn long. But if you need long ass decks like that, I see why you need a john-cena press and two 6 ton jacks. With an 11" wide blank, that's 8,442kg (9.3 tons) of pressure at 12psi.

Found a nice little spot I can use to press my decks. Thinking of using the two walls as the frame for my press. One side is brick with soil behind it so that will be no problem, but the other side is just a thick wall. 
This way I don't need to build such an expensive and bulky press. 
But I also don't want to blow up my wall.

@longhairedboy @Apolo  
Why not use 2 or 3 of these? It is more expensive, but you could easily still swap out deck profiles and adjust lengths. 
If you only use 1 profile, you could easily make a concrete form and make a kick ass press. 
They also have smaller models, but this is the first one I found. My friend and I wanted to make completes in college and looked into this method for a press.

Make a mold of the deck profile from foam and use melanine to make a box surrounding it and under it. Caulk and seams and corners. Pour concrete in the mold. It is the same concept as making concrete sinks. 
I made a table using a similar process.

I might actually just copy that design and make my own. Looks pretty simple, no welds, just bolts. And it's basically 100% steel extrusions

Or just use the steel extrusions for the higher stressed parts of the frame. @longhairedboy where was the point of failure on your broken press? Need to know so that I know where to place the steel

because they cost 20 tons more than my wooden one which i built for $300 and i can still swap molds all day. 48" molds, at that. In case you're about to reply "its only $189": Its also only 24" in capacity. price one with a 48" capacity. If you can find one. IF you can, I will take an honest look at it. 

If i was going to buy a press frame i'd probably need to have it custom made to fit in my shop and still work with what i have. In fact it would be less of an H and more of a rectangle as it would sit close to the floor and have a work bench floating over the top of it.

If you used 2 of them, they have a 12 ton model for 130, and used the 14" dimension as the width. You could also press multiple decks at the same time and stack your molds.  
Since it would be modular, you could also push them together when not in use to save space.
