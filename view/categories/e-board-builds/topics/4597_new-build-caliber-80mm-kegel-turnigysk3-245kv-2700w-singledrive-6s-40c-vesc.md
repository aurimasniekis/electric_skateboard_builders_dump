Good Day :smiley:

 

 New builder here, Anyways I would want to create an electric longboard mainly to get to and from school, the road here is not smooth, there are lots of cracks and bumps so just wanted to keep that in mind. Im going for a boosted inspired look. Im still a student so I would greatly appreciate any if you guys can recommend/adjust parts specially to help with the price.Anyways, forgive me if the components I list are wrong, I don't have any experience yet, we all start somewhere right hahaha

Anyways, here is my plan:

 

**_HARDWARE_**

**Board**; Ill be making my own board using plywood, I found a Loaded Vanguard Template so I decided to go for that.

 

**Trucks**: Caliber II Fifty Caliber 10"/50 Degrees Blackout Skateboard Longboard Trucks ($35)

Other Longboard Hardware: ($4)

 

**Wheels**: Orangatang Kegel 80mm ($60)


Motor Mount: Single Bolt On Motor Mount w/ Drive Wheel Kit From  ($127)

I choose the 14T/36T Kegel Drive Wheel kit. I decided to go for this kit, since I do not have readily accessible drills and welding machine, And I might want to adjust the motor mount for future purposes.

 

**_ELECTRONICS_**

**Battery**:

2x Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack from Hobby King ($50)

Connected in series w/

HXT 4mm Series Connector with 12awg Wire from Amazon ($10)

Skyrc Imax B6 Professional Rapid Lipro Balance Charger/discharger ($36)

HobbyKing‚Ñ¢ Lipo Voltage Checker (2S~8S) ($2)

 

**Remote**: (UPDATED)
[Quanum 2.4Ghz 3ch Pistol Grip Tx & Rx System]  

 ($21.85)

**Motor**: T[urnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-236kv Brushless Outrunner Motor](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18126__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_5065_236kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor.html) ($57)

I would appreciate if you guys could recommend a better motor, I am fairly light around 130lbs including backpack already.

 

**ESC**:
(UPDATED) VESC From   ($100)

 
**Other stuff**: Xt60 Male and Female,  5 pairs from Amazon ($2)

3.5mm Male Female Banana Plug Bullet Connector Replacements 20 Pairs Amazon ($3.42)

I still need to get a soldering Iron

 

Total: As of now ~$507

 

Of course I have not ordered anything yet, Ill be glad to cut down the price and adjust accordingly

With that, Would I need to change/reconsider/get anything else?

 
Thanks for reading and Have a great day :D

I made my remote with my phone and a bluetooth module +arduino. 
But it's really not that easy to drive with because when braking you really need to look at your screen. 
Investing in a good controller is not a bad idea ! 

If you want to cut the price, those orangatang kegels are pretty expensive, you can find flywheel clones for 25$

Since Ill be alotting an older phone itself as the controller, maybe those stuff called "mini fling" you clip on the screen can help, since the joystick pad automatically flings back in neutral position.

I dont have much background with Arduino, but Ill research more on that if it can save more.
I'm also checking out the Gt2b controller but I think you'd have to buy an additional charger it. And 3d print an enclosure just to make it more compact.

For the wheels would this be a good alternative?
83mm Longboard Flywheels Wheels + ABEC 7 Bearings Spacers ($28)
Link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IO5D604/ref=twister_B00IO5D5VO?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

And for the "Single Bolt On Motor Mount w/ Drive Wheel Kit" you can get from , there are options for you to pick

Will I still go for the 14T/36T 9mm "Kegel Drive Wheel Kit", cause the kegel wheel is 80mm while this clone is 83mm, or will the "ABEC Drive Wheel Kit" be a better option/fit?

Thanks Again :slight_smile:

Welcome to the forum! Looking good man! A few things I see could be changed..

ESC: For the price, why not just go VESC? I got mine for $99 and it seems to be far superior for electric skates than a plain old ESC. 

Remote: Also, the remote you are looking into is phone controlled? I would highly advise just getting a Gt2B or making your own little mod. Not much more $ either way and much safer/more reliable. If you want a smaller controller just buy the mini gt2b from @torqueboards. That joystick thing may work but I wouldn't risk it. Probably would end up spending the same as Dexter's GT2b and throwing it away, but worse you may end up cracking your head if it cuts out or doesn't deliver signal well. 

Batteries: I would look into the nano tech if you are going the Lipo route. Great discharge, super reliable and about $20 more total for 5000mah 4s packs. This would power it better, longer and more reliably for a very small price increase. 

Wheels: Definitely go with real wheels whether that's the tangs or the ABEC's. Personally I love me ABEC 90mm wheels, super smooth and handle bumps excellently.

For the motor and the rest of it I am sure someone else can chime in and offer advice. I went with hubs so never got into researching proper KV, gearing, belts or compatability with certain battery packs etc..

If you have any specific questions on my advice feel free to ask here or PM me! 

P.S. Take my advice with a grain of salt, I am just learning as well. Someone else may be able to and likely will chime in and refine my advice even further...or completely dismiss it :P Hope this helps a bit! Good luck and welcome!

Thanks AbrownMN, also very helpful :slight_smile:

Im going to consider VESC, Controller, Wheel and Battery Upgrade then, definitely more expensive but  hope it would definitely be worth it.

I think Ill go with a regular gt2b then do a BadWolf's 3d printed enclosure to make it compact, in the future. 

Btw I did a quick search of the Nano-Tech and found this: http://youtu.be/fucFhqx-hHw
Basically he said the Regular Turnigy are much better than the Nano-tech, What do you think?
Anyways can you link me to the Nano-Tech that you use? Thanks :smiley:

Sounds like he has more experience than I do with batteries, he has a lot of product reviews and clearly uses them a lot. I chose them based on reviews, power output to price ratio but a major factor was the size. They are slimmer than any other pack out there with that discharge and mah that I have found, hence the nano. A slim design was crucial for the setup I was originally planning to use them on. I believe @Haimindo is using them on his build so you could check with him on performance. He seems rather pleased with them, but he also has only had his board put together for a little while now. This guy seems to be doing reviewing based on short and long term performance and actually doing voltage tests. I am sure you could find ten videos that say the opposite, but that's just the crazy world of options and opinions we live in. The small additional cost to each component I mentioned will definitely give you a better experience in the long run, keep doing research on the batteries and eventually you will settle on a clear winner.

Yup, I use nanotechs on my Carvon V2 dual build. The reason I got the nanotechs was because they were on sale and the cheapest 4S 6Ah lipos in EU warehouse. First 5 rides with the nanotechs were fine, but after that I have felt the voltage sag is getting worse. I have to test some other lipos to do some kind of conclusion but at the moment I would not recommend getting nanotechs unless they are in sale

Ok thanks @Haimindo :smiley: , Ill be going with  2x Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack from Hobby King ($50), connected in series as for now, I can easily upgrade it to 4 packs in the future.

Anyways I'll go with this VESC from  ($99)
product/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/
Instead of the $80 

For the GT2B, I'll go with the Quanum 2.4 ghz because it is more compact, Ill just have to make do with batteries

Also has anyone tried the Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-236kv Brushless Outrunner Motor ($57)
Would this be enough or is there a better motor I can get? 

Thanks for reading and have a great day! :slight_smile:

Just need some advice for charging the batteries, 
I will get 2x Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack from Hobby King and connect it in series, with that what I'll need to charge the 2 LiPo's are:

SkyRc ImaxB6 ($37)
60W 12V 5A Adapter Charger ($6.65)
Xt60 charge cable ($4.80)
6s Balance Charging Cable ($4.26) Or do i not need this extension?

A bit unexpected expense there lol

Anyways here's what the cart looks like:

[IMAX B6AC V2 Professional Balance Charger/Discharger ($41)](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__58285__IMAX_B6AC_V2_Professional_Balance_Charger_Discharger.html)

Would be cheaper, because it already has a built in power supply and a XT60 Charge Lead, so I would not have to buy those 2, here are the specs:

This should be enough to charge the 2x Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack right?

If ur trying to be cheap I'd get a simple 6s bulk charger (powe source) and charge everything in series on the board while connecting some batter-medic-like devices on the balance leads to balance and monitor cells.


Or maybe not cheaper and just get those parts u wrote.

Thanks for pointing out the Motor, 

 What motor do you use? I've been looking around but most of the good ones in HobbyKing are sold out. I found this tho:

 [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-190kv Brushless Outrunner Motor ($70)](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18181__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6364_190kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor.html?strSearch=SK3%2063)

Or would you recommend a something else

What do you think?



Theres this [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-245kv Brushless Outrunner Motor](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18128__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6364_245kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor.html) 
at the same price but 245kv
Can go 4mph faster based on [this calculator](http://217.118.128.188/tests/ev_calc.html).

Trust me, you will get very bored on a setup like this. That is pretty much my setup now and it doesn't feel fast but it has decent torque. I would go with a 245kv motor or maybe up your battery voltage.

Yes. Your best option would probably be going to 10S and 190kv (more expensive though). @torqueboards has used 245kv. I wonder what he thinks about the hill climbing ability of 245kv with 6s.

I would be carfully with this "power supply". I had a similiar one which got very very hot at 4A.... So i just charged at 1A....
Maybe you better try a PSU like [this](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0191H4VF2/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=17BENO76NCTU&coliid=I1V22A0RH07SO5&psc=1). I would select about 100W to go safe.
