After much help from this group and another sites my build finally begins (kind of) I am still waiting on my electrical components. 

I initially was going use a set of 90mm wheels but they didn't match my build so I decided to get a set of 83mm wheels that matched my deck. They are flywheel knock offs. I have a set of ceramic bearings that I am going to install in them. For trucks I went with a set of caliber 2. The deck is something I have been eyeballing for a while. It is a Hi5ber all carbon Zenith deck. It is amazing in person.

I used some 3M strong tape.. Maybe, I didn't let it cure long enough but it eventually came off.. I since swapped the deck.

The bottom end of the board got mashed up too from the concrete since I kick it up.

Great boards though.

I'm interested in seeing what you come up with :)

Gorgeous deck!  Look for Torque's setup as he has an identical (or extremely similar Hi5ber deck) one he built.

You going to do a Badwolf v2 enclosure for your GT2B?  What mounts and gears are you planning?

The BadWolf enclosure is a "hack" you can do to your FlySky GT2B or KobbyKing GT2B (transmitters aka remotes) to put it in a smaller 3D printed enclosure.

I have those same wheels on my current build and I really like the way they feel on the road but they aren't as precision as flywheels by any stretch. One thing to look out for is that bearings will be hard to press in on one wheel and practically fall out of the next. Of course once they're bolted on that doesn't matter. I have heard stories about them being unbalanced, and upon closer inspection i found that i do have an extremely slight wobble in one wheel but it certainly isn't enough to affect anything. 

Of course all of this is why those wheels are like $30 or $40 less than proper ABEC 11 flywheels. But at the end of the day, I'm happy with the clones and they're a lot less expensive.

@torqueboards I noticed on your build that you have flush mount hardware. Did you countersink the deck yourself or did yours come counter sunk? If you did do it yourself did you have any issues with fraying?

Not a huge fan of "hack" describing a simple how-to step by step process. (my own personal issue being an IT guy and everyone "hacking" *anything* when in reality they are copy/paste someone else who actually knows what they are doing...)

I'm also using those wheels on my current (and first ever) build. One of them has the slightest possible wobble but it's not perceptible when riding the board. (kicking - no esc yet) 

One thing I noticed though is that pulleys that are made for real Flywheels don't quite line up with the spaces in the hubs on these knockoffs. I was able to get three of the six screws from the Enertion pulley into the hub and it looks like I could easily get a fourth screw through if I drilled a new hole into the carbon backing washer on the outside of the wheel. 

Otherwise, they are quite a deal for $25.

Yeah... they had an old style core that was exact to ABEC but I think it wasn't holding up so they made it thicker.

For ABEC, you would need to use 3 bolts with our style of drive wheels.

onloop changed to just to HACK:...  so i changed it back to how-to but left hack.  it's my own issue.

back on topic - i've used the clone and genuine flywheels - i too noticed the clones were inconsistent - super tight bearings and not tight...  No biggie.  I also had folks complain about the 'thane quality and feel.  When brand new they were a bit slick w/ release agent, but after a few miles they've broken in just fine.  Not as sticky as flywheels, not quite as soft duro as flywheel - but totally doable.

Something else i noticed is that the enertion pulleys want to sit slightly deeper into the clones than they do the ABEC 11s. Again, its barely noticeable, but i'm wondering if a thin plate behind the pulley would help keep alignment from ever becoming an issue due to this.

So while I am still waiting for my order from Enertion to ship I figured I would try to do something a little custom with my grip tape. *the red looks a lot redder in person. 
I was going to (and still might) inlay red grip tape on the rest of the cut outs. But I really like seeing that carbon fiber through the tape.

In order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds i am asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.

Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as 
**"new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb"** this becomes hard to keep track of.

I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;
**Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC**

Example
**The Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks |  R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC**

So all the parts are here. At least for now. I bought a single motor kit but decided after they came that the parts are to amazing not to go with a double set up. So more parts to come. 

So far it is going slow, just because I don't have much time. Everything is going toget her real nice. The motor is mounted up and looks like the belt is dialed in. I spent alot of time on that, just making sure it was perfect. 

Tomorrow I plan to solider the bullet connectors to the vesc, get everything connected and hopefully get a bench test. Then Sunday I am going to make a temporary enclosure for everything so I can ride it until winter gets here.

In the winter my plan is to set this up as a dual motor setup when the parts come in. I also plan on cutting into that awesome deck, reinforcing it with cf, and sinking the battery into it. Then I will make the permanent enclosure with a mix of carbon fiber and 3d printed parts. 
Stay tuned.

Build update. Everything is going together really good. I have everything connected. Ran the bldc, with no problems except having to change it from 261 to 301, which wasn't really a problem. The motor sounds so much cooler in person. My only regret is not ordering the dual setup right away. 

Today if I have time I am going to mount everything and rig up an enclosure, then test ride.

Ok, so my temporary enclosure is a little embarrassing, especially since the rest of the build is so nice but at least I was able to get a nice test ride in.

I was honestly suprised how well the single motor moved me. By the time I was done I was shaking from all the adrenaline. I can't wait to get a nice long ride in. 

On a side note can anyone tell me if I should let the spacecell drain to 0 for the first charge?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/f0e2e308c6f725d52e3476e6cadb284672c077a8.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/d48a4062c0a1e56bc28eb7c27769face738bb3c9.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/f0e2e308c6f725d52e3476e6cadb284672c077a8.jpg" width="281" height="500">

You are referring to "Motor Max" under the current limits correct? I think min is already set at 80.00. so does that mean for full speed i need to bump it up to 100?

## \#53 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2015-11-19T22:45:39.745Z Reads: 295

```
that setting controls the amount of current at the motor, 80amps is what is shown in that picture. I don't recommend setting this any higher.

when you say "turn down the power" what do you mean exactly? do you want to limit the power (just max watts?) or limit the speed? or acceleration rate? Or everything combined?

In terms of top speed you can limit max ERPM, to prevent the board from reaching an out-of-control moment

ERPM=Mechanical RPM*Pole pairs.

The R-SPEC has 14 magnets, so it has 7 pole pairs. (7 north & 7 south)

So if you want to have a max speed of around 20km the mechanical RPM of the R-SPEC needs to be limited to about 3000RPM (this is based on space cell, 14/36 gearing, 83mm wheel)

So MAX ERPM for max speed of approx 20km is: 7 x 3000 = 21000 eRPM

Combine this with really low motor current, maybe 10 or 20Amp should ensure a fairly timid electric skateboard...

I don't know if it is possible to limit the rate of acceleration, I think this would be nice since so many people are using big powerful motors, I will email vedder to find out.

I suggest testing these settings first as I have never done it and don't know how it will perform in the real world.

## \#55 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-03-07T06:00:16.459Z Reads: 248

```
technically speaking no you don't, but there has been some cases of the BMS low voltage cutting in when a rider is not ready for it, say if you are riding up a steep hill and your battery is very low, If the BMS shuts down due to low voltage the acceleration of the board will instantly go away, which is nearly the same as hitting the brake which often means you go flying.

So now we always use the VESC Soft LVC, this ensures that the board will gradually die at the end of the battery capacity instead of turning off rapidly.
