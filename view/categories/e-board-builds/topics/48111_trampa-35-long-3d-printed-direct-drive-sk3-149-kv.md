Don't want to pollute @Der6FingerJo's thread, thus starting my own. I am heavily inspired by him and others (Jens & Kug3lis) pioneering direct drives, where I try to make it affordable for personal use with the tools at my disposal. I will not release the CAD files out of respect for those who came up with the original designs, neither will I sell the drive. 

**Board ordered. Should arrive next week:**
* 35 long, 17 ply
* Camlock bindings
* Superstar hubs
* Infinity Trucks

**Other Hardware:**
Transferred from my first build
* dual focbox
* sk3 149 kv
* 206 ultrabox
* 4x 8000mah zippy 30C

![14|690x372](upload://fR5qROep575qgUyCuah75Aiiory.jpg)

Direct drive, two V-Ring seals and in the end a custom TPU seal to close off the other side of the hangar/motor mount. Still have to determine the distance between the wheels and the drive, thus distance bolts and truck clamp might change.

Motor gear will be metal. Wheel gear at first 3D printed, later most likely POM (stock spur gear needs to be milled and adjusted slightly).

1:5 gear ratio

Progress as I go once I receive the board.

Yeah this design is stunning - incredible that you're able to make your own version, and I love your ethos of being inspired and creating a like design without trying to produce it outside of your own use.  With these guys in mind, I'd have to say if you're going dual FOCBOX I'd grab one of @Kug3lis dual CNC encolsures and save the money on the 206 ultrabox.  Unless you need it to be completely waterproof then stick with the plan.

:open_mouth:Interesting. I may leave it out then. Did you press it very firmly to the enclosure, or with light pressure? What is typically your average speed?

Looks great! I like the combination of additive and subtractive manufacturing on this one :smiley:
Definitely interesting to see more people with 3d printed gears and how they will hold up!

Thx. Thought about using that enclosure, but I'd have to move a few components elsewhere and would have to find a way or making it waterproof. It does look a heck of allot cleaner through.

I only used them on the bench, 40km/h calculatet. I leave them out afterwards, not much pressure. Next time i put a thin metal cylinder over the pom part, should fix that.

Yes, that should do the trick. That at least means I have to think about CNC cutting the side that is in direct contact with the v-ring, since the glass temperature of the 3D printed material is most likely lower than that of POM.

Indeed. Ordered some Ninjatek Armadillo, as I can't print ABS.
Supposedly a very hard TPU variety. Marketing blabla:
► Shore Hardness = 75D
► Excellent bridging capabilities and virtually no warping
► Abrasion resistance 84% better than PLA and 60% better than ABS
► Chemical resistance to many materials, including naphtha, ASTM Oils #1-3, petroleum and freon
► Consistent diameter and material properties providing reliable, high quality prints
► No heated bed required. Build platform requires same prep as PLA

Good thing, it can be lubed with a fair amount of stuff due to its chemical resistance. Success will depend on how stiff it is. With only 1 or two teeth grabbing, that needs to be good.

Just received my new Trampa 35 long.
The deck is scratched up/scuffed in a variety of places. One dent...nice :confused:
At least the bearings all fit.

Could anyone with a Trampa tell me if these scruff marks are normal? Found only one review with a mention of this.

If this is common, I won't send the deck in for exchange.

I didn't notice any marks on my Holypro deck straight after unboxing..
They won't affect the board in any meaningful way but it's a bummer this happened. Guess it's your call wether you can wait for a replacement.

Doesn't affect the board, but normally the price. It looks like a board that has been used for demo purposes or has been thrown around in storage.

OK, so they hardly ever arrive flawless. Not that much of an issue/decided to double check everything else. 

Am I completely nuts or should these not be identical? As far as I can see, one should be pointing left, the other right.. Mirrored so to speak. 

@trampa or someone else?

For anyone else who wants to check their bindings.
Apparently, this is something that will easily mess up during packaging.

Sending the board and bindings back, keeping the trucks so that I can continue working on the drive.

Older design of the motor mount side compared to 3d model, but dimensions are the same otherwise/good enough for test fitting. 

Printing with cheap PLA for now until I move closer toward the final design.

How much clearance do you have between the ground and the drive ?

It ended up being identical to Kug3lis' inner drive to give it sufficient clearance from the gears and enough material, but it has a bit more clearance compared to the 72t belt drive I was previously using.

Edit: I must have more clearance (about 1 cm) as kugl3lsis' drive is lining up with the upper line of the tire where mine is lining up almost with the rim border. 

Looks like there will not be a smaller direct/inner drive version, unless you work with multiple gears or a different gear ratio.

No post processing.

Cheap and old Wanhao i3, 0.4 nozzle.
The filament came with the printer/creativetools.se.

Actually need more retraction, but haven't bothered to fine tune that setting.
Printing temp relatively high at 230, cooling fan at 60% starting at layer 1.

Printing speed of armadillo filament so far has to be super slow (50% of pla), otherwise it starts stringing like crazy and drags perimeters around. 230 degree, higher and the surface becomes rough. 

Print came out nice though. The stuff is sturdy and slippery feeling like nylon. Just need to sand down the elephants foot.

What kind of tooth profile is that?
How do you generate the gears? I can do quite some things in cad but gears i'm little bit struggling. any tips?

I download the CAD files from the manufacturer. In case the 3D print fails, I can just buy the stock part and have it machined to my liking. 

The module 2 spur gear was downloaded from
https://www.tracepartsonline.net

Many parts can be found there.

Regarding gear printing. I recommend a bevel at the top and bottom to prevent differences in width. Both the bottom and top are slightly wider than the middle. Smaller is less of an issue.

Thanks Riako. Just allot of patience and slow printing involved.

Moving closer toward the final design.

Connection of spur gear and wheel is a bigger challenge without aluminum parts. Possible to use 75mm m4 screws which would hold the hubs and the spur gear parts together, but I'd also have to remove those screws to take off the wheels. 

Preferred solution...sadly, another alu part. I believe plastic would strip too easily with the forces applied.
![10|544x500](upload://gjOnwdMd9GLaFIEoN3ogQgiYr7j.jpg)

Test fitting what I have so far. Deck can have full motion, barely misses the motor mount when fully compressing the springs.

I made something similar, but i had not enough balls to try printed gears, some other parts are (also mechanical ones). Did you test the printed gear already?

```
The drive has been designed in such a way as to allow for the incorporation of adjusted stock parts. If all fits, the gears will be made out of an adjusted stock POM gear.

I will give the printed gears a shot, but I am often speeding around at around 45 km/h. I don't think I will ever trust printed gears enough to go that fast, but who knows. They might surpass my expectations.

postponed until I have put together my own CNC.

I have printed two different wheel spur gears and both are wobbly. The distance from the hub to where the actual gear is located is rather large, so any error in print bed leveling or the printer frame will make the issue worse the longer the object becomes. The same will be true for any CNC equipment. 

Involute direct drive has smaller distances, thus that is most certainly the way to go to reduce such errors.

I never needed such precision before, but with these type of projects...you do.

Oh man i never considered that, i should test my gears somehow independently from the wheel. On the wheel they are a bit wobbly but only sideways and not up and down if that make sense. Still trying to figure out why, i even counted the individual rotiations on each screw while attaching the gear to the wheel.

Might be because a 350€ 3D Printer isn't as precise as a professional CNC machine but oh well :smile:

Might even be that the superstar hub is not 100% straight. Can't tell with a printed gear, but holding my finger against the rim I also noticed a small deviation.

Having a support bearing in the gear like Jens has might help resolve some of that.

Yes, I bought an e-toxx drive ;)
The design worked, but my printer is just not up to the task. Too inaccurate.I asked someone else to print the gears, but his results were even worse. 

I figured my safety is worth the cash and I opted for something that is reliable.

If I had a CNC machine, things would be different. The ones precise enough to do this are too expensive at the moment (6000 EUR).

No, I haven't published the file. A few people here are selling similar drives. I do not want to interfere in their business in any way, mainly because they play a big role in ESK8 innovation.

This project was for education purposes so to speak (learning more about drive trains, cad modeling, limitations of 3D printing).
