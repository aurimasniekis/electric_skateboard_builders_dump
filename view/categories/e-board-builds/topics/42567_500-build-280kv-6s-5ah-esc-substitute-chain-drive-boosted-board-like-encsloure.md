That sprocket and chain setup is a 14:27 gearing, or a 1:1.91. This will result in a low torque/high speed board. Since you only have 1 motor, the motor will be running very inefficient and heat up quickly.
On top of that your motor is a 280kv one, so it doesnt really have alot of torque from before, compared to a 190kv one for example

The controller works, but obviously not as good as a Vesc. Its the same controller that is in all of the china boards. There is a big thread about it here on the forum

The max speed is about 20km/h
I got 10s battery and the rpm with 280kv motor should be around 11000 but the esc is limited to 6400rpm
My solution is to get a lover kv motor (190kv) to increase the torq and the rpm should be around 7000, but with 90mm wheels and 14:27 ratio i hope I'll get at least 30km/h
