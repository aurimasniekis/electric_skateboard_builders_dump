My goal from the start was simple. What is THE best value board you can build for under $650?

Behold...

Most of you would have seen Baz_L's [CHINESE build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/chinese-build-10s3p-maytech-vesc-maytech-6374-190kv-mono-drive-boosted-board-deck-97mm-wheels-winning-remote/14040) by now. If not, have a look since it sheds some light on how versatile and misunderstood the DIY chinese market is. 

Now best value may be subjective to some. But for me I wanted a flexible deck, dual motor setup and a 10S4P pack. Most would think that this is simply not achievable for under $650. But whats more is the $650 price tag (USD by the way) includes all the carbon fibre materials and resin to make vacuum formed CF enclosures! 

In terms of aesthetic goals I plan to lay carbon fibre on roadside @mastercho style and make CF enclosures to match. Combined with black trucks, black 90mm flywheel (clones) and black vicious grip tape it will hopefully yield really cool results!

The heart of this budget build and the reason it can be done for $650 comes down to the choice of deck and the dual motor mechanical kit. The deck is a clone of the Vanguard and for only 30 bucks it's definitely not a full bamboo deck but it is still an amazing deck considering the price.

The second piece to the puzzle is the dual motor mechanical kit. For $84 you get an entire dual motor mechanical kit which includes everything you need; motor mounts, pulleys, belts, trucks and wheels!!! This is the main price breakthrough, how they can possibly sell something like this and make money is beyond me :fearful:

https://gd3.alicdn.com/bao/uploaded/i3/736292005/TB2giR.rVXXXXcUXXXXXXXXXXXX_!!736292005.jpg_600x600.jpg

What the price tag doesn't include is a spot welder. So for some that might be an additional cost if you don't already have one. 

Enough of the intro. Here's the breakdown of cost and links for parts where applicable. What you'll notice is that most of these parts are the same parts used in @Baz_L's build. 

**Boosted board clone deck $30USD:** [https://world.taobao.com/item/536855694383.htm?fromsite=main&spm=a312a.7700824.w4004-14838118875.2.l7tyh8](https://world.taobao.com/item/536855694383.htm?fromsite=main&spm=a312a.7700824.w4004-14838118875.2.l7tyh8)

**Dual motor mechanical kit $85USD:**[https://world.taobao.com/item/528942351980.htm?fromsite=main&spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-8431072093.46.pxndcc](https://world.taobao.com/item/528942351980.htm?fromsite=main&spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-8431072093.46.pxndcc)

**40XSamsung 25R Li-ion BEST price $2.62USD each:** [https://ru.nkon.nl/samsung-18650-inr18650-25r.html](https://ru.nkon.nl/samsung-18650-inr18650-25r.html)

**GT2B remote $23USD:** [https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html) 

**Maytech VESC $75USD each:** [https://world.taobao.com/item/536720652464.htm?spm=a312a.7700714.0.0.skowvc#detail](https://world.taobao.com/item/536720652464.htm?spm=a312a.7700714.0.0.skowvc#detail)

**JLabs Sealed, Sensored 6355 motors $75USD each:** [https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sealed-motor/](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sealed-motor/)

**Carbon fibre cloth, fibre glass, resin, vacuum bags ~$80USD:** Prices may vary. I bought mine locally on ebay since they were all reasonably priced and hard to find overseas.

**Wire, XT90's, Battery Display ect ~$20USD:** prices may vary. I bought mine locally on ebay since they were relatively cheap

Now the obvious question is how can I buy from Taobao. It's actually very easy. You don't need an agent and you can buy directly and most sellers will ship directly to your address. You can also pay with a credit card. Now in my case I actually used an agent (superbuy) for the simple fact that I could pay via paypal. 

So far I've ordered everything and will now have to endure a very painful waiting game...

Will update when things start arriving!

How much did they charge you on shipping for the deck? Or did I read somewhere that you bought it through superbuy?

I would also warn that the trucks are most likely not genuine, along with poor quality motor mounts and wheels. 

I do understand your pain with being in Australia and not having easy access to parts.

```
The seller on Taobao charged Â¥15 which is about 4 bucks for shipping to Superbuy's warehouse. From there the warehouse said that shipping to Australia shouldn't be any more than $20AUD. 

True I doubt that the trucks are genuine and if it weren't for Baz_L's thread where he discusses his impressions on these parts I would never even consider buying them. His impressions were fairly positive regarding the mechanical kit as well as the deck so I'm mostly trusting in his judgement. Obviously chinese sellers can be unpredictable and quality may vary considerably. It certainly is a gamble and if it doesn't work out then it will cost me much more in the long rung. But I am certainly hopeful :) 

If I wanted to use genuine paris, caliber or ronin trucks then the price would be considerably more and I would certainly have to make my own motor mounts to keep costs similar. In my case I simply don't have the tools nor the space to make motor mounts. Living in college presents significant restraints on space for projects :( 

@Alextech Nickel is not included with the batteries from Nkon although they certainly have that option. The nickel I bought was around 5 bucks for 3m of pure nickel strips 10mm wide 0.15mm thick.

@Alextech I haven't tried out these parts in person of course. In the thread I linked to in this thread you can find @Baz_L's impression on the parts I've purchased.

@benwong Yep making two separated enclosures :) Ideally I'll make them @whitepony style as shown in his latest build!

[Re-building Loaded Vanguard with Bamboo/Fibreglass/Carbon](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/re-building-loaded-vanguard-with-bamboo-fibreglass-carbon/10460/71)

Using the electrical components themselves as a mould should ensure a better fit and eliminates the step of making a mould for the enclosures! Simon also shows you the exact layers of GFK and CF used along with the weight per m^2 for each layer! 

I'm so grateful for him for showing us such detailed steps about his builds, members like him who are coming up with new ideas, pushing the envelope and sharing their findings and knowledge really sets this forum at the forefront of innovation! Innovation at the hobbyists end! :D

Really looking forward to seeing how this plays out! So far the cheap drive kit is doing me really well. I upgraded the motor pulley from 12T to 15T. Since you're running dual motors, I don't know if that's necessary. Anybody with some more experience on this willing to shed some light? ;)

That's a crazy price for a dual mechanical kit

But the real steal here is the skateboard batarang, for just 14Â¢ (?)

Dual motors will obviously provide plenty of torque, which means switching to a higher gear motor pulley makes even more sense. I'm already pretty light at only 63kg so lack of torque certainly won't be an issue. Ideally I'll switch both motor pulleys to 16T for a higher top speed.

I'll preface by saying that I'm sorry for the lack of updates. First year uni has proven to be extremely busy especially these past two weeks! Most of the parts I ordered have arrived.

The entire process through the taobao agent was reasonably speedy. It took approximately two days to ship from the seller to the superbuy agent and then a few days to sort out packaging, Once sent the items took about a week to arrive in Australia! The only thing I wasn't expecting was how high the shipping costs were... It's calculated by weight so some of the packages where easily 35USD for shipping. All up shipping was about $100 AUD for everything from Taobao.

So the verdict on parts: 

Pictures are way better then words but those will have to wait until I have more time to upload them.

**The Deck:** The vanguard clone is very good considering the price. As Baz and others have noted only the top and bottom layers are bamboo. The flex is very substantial, almost too much (I only weigh 63kg). It should be noted that the board has no concave at all, so it's a bit like standing on a flat plank of wood... Although I've never ridden a real Vanguard so my impressions so far of pushing on it for a few weeks are very positive!

**The dual motor mechanical kit:** Even though the motor mounts are quite thin they are both made of steel so I think they will have no issues at all in terms of durability. Be mindful that the mechanical kit doesn't come with risers or bearings so you'll need to buy them separately. I ordered yellow 90mm flywheels but they turned out to be 97's instead. 

**Maytech VESC's:** Can't see any visibly cold solder joints and all the wires and connections look solid. They both came with USB cables and CAN bus cables. Haven't bench tested them yet since I'm still waiting for batteries.

All the parts have arrived except the batteries. Once they get here I'll begin the whole build.

So far the parts from Taobao look really solid and after pushing the Vanguard clone with the 97's for a few weeks it feels really carvy and easy to control at high speeds without speed wobbles, even with the stock bushings. Can't wait to start electrifying it :slight_smile:

really great to you get all the part smoothly from taobao. 
if the clone deck have concave, i will be wonderful to me. 

looking forward your build. 

BTW, how was your enclosure style?  front back light boosted or make it one compartment under the deck?

Well for the amount of money it was for shipping it better be fast.

Enclosure will be boosted style, with two separated enclosures. The flex of the deck dictates that fact.

A few pics from yesterdays ride, been pumping this for a few weeks and can say it feels great under the feet! Even without grip tape :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 

Since I only weigh 63kg with the amount of flex this has I'd say that it would be too much for the majority of people. Something to keep in mind if you're considering this deck.

Well all the main components have arrived and have just been sitting here for weeks. Instead of the GT2B I've opted for the much cheaper and smaller form factor mini remote, purchased on ebay for $17 [2.4GHz Radio Remote Controller Receiver ](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2-4GHz-Radio-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Binding-Plug-For-Electric-Skateboard-/262779892776?hash=item3d2ee6f428:g:G2kAAOSw9GhYYjLd) :) 

Just waiting on the copper wire and copper braid to show up in order to finish the battery pack. I've decided to forego the spot welder, mainly due to the fact that I can't justify spending $100+ on a piece of equipment that I don't expect to use more than once. Following @Norco's [build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/pork-chop-express-comet-loki-motor-6374-vesc-10s4p-diy-18650-pack-benchwheel/13106) I'll hand solder the connections using either 12AWG equivalent copper rod or 11mm copper braid, still unsure which one is more suitable :sleepy: Any ideas?

Hey man - your build sounds good. Will be interesting to see how the parts hold up. I'm going to do a total at the end so will be interesting to see how that match up.

Just a quick note. While I still think that soldering a pack is a good way connect them up I have plans to break my 10s4p down in the near future to 2 x 5s4p. The main reason for this is that I think I have a cold solder joint in one parallel pack which is causing a slight drift. Not a huge amount and certainly not enough for me to worry about battery damage (esp due to reserved battery cut offs on the vesc). But by doing this I will be able to occasionally balance charge the pack using my iMax 6b - cheaper and easier to fit in than a BMS.

Then when in the board I can just use the 41v cutoff brick charger. Just a thought.

Thanks for the inspiration Norco! Interesting point about splitting the packs in two. Ideally I'd like to build the battery pack to be travel safe by splitting the cells into five groups of 2S4P cells. This way you'd have 72Whr per group of cells which can be joined and separated by 5.5mm bullet connectors. Of course this is all determined by how much space there is to work with, which inevitably isn't much with a 10S4P pack and separated enclosures :sweat_smile: Just waiting on the braided wire and I can start soldering!

For charging I've got a 42V 2A brick charger that I can travel with when necessary and when faster charging is desired I'll be using the DPS5015 DC-DC buck converter coupled with a 48V power supply. This way you can precisely set the cutoff voltage to any range you desire 41V, 41.1V, 41.15V etc, additionally one can set the charge current to 2A or 6A or anything in between for fast charging!

It looks kinda flimsy and basic compared to a dedicated bench top PSU, but it's been well tested on the flashlight forums, with a few members testing it well above 10A and it's really great value for the price! I've used it for a number of months already for other use cases and its held up quite well. Though charging batteries is a slightly more critical task compared to powering LED's, one which obviously requires better regulation and better CCCV characteristics... We'll see how it goes.

Well from here on, it's basically just a waiting game until everything else gets here. Until then I've attempted to take a few glam shots and hopefully I'll put up a video soon of me riding it. 

From the way the mounts are constructed to the way they are screwed onto the trucks they seem very solid and I have nothing bad to say about them after dry fitting them without loctite. Interesting to note that the belts aren't 9mm but more like 11mm, close to 12mm in width.

My thoughts after pushing the vanguard clone for a few more weeks is that the general feel with the 97's make it totally impractical to push due to how high the deck is from the ground. When carving hard I feel the high ground clearance these wheels have in combination with the top mount deck don't inspire a lot of confidence in terms of stability and overall dynamic connection with the road, the comfort of the large flywheels almost feel like pneumatics, completely disconnected from the road... I'll most likely be trying out a set of smaller wheels or even switching to a drop-through deck. But for now I'm happy to postpone changes until after I finish this build!

Ordered some 3mm neoprene sheet, upon initial inspection I feel as though 3mm may be a bit too thick, although I'm sure once the enclosures are screwed on the pressure will flatten it out significantly. Also just received my 2.1, 5.5mm DC jacks for charging. I know most people are using Xt60's for charging ports but I didn't like the aesthetics of them, others are using 5.5mm bullet connectors but that provides no polarity protection. I like the simplicity of a one port charge system although the laptop style ports are significantly more flimsy than an xt60, we'll see how it goes. 

Also received my 42V 2A brick charger I bought for 10 bucks (AUD). That price begs the question regarding reliability and safety. I cracked it open and took a few photos. What do you guys think?

Hey @will_manners I'm a huge fan of your build, and am interested in going the TaoBao route as well.  I see that you used Superbuy as an agent.  How would you rate that experience?

Hey man! Thanks for the love ;) I never want to take away from the quality of local providers and manufacturers of esk8 parts, they all do a fantastic job in providing the community with beautifully crafted products. However Taobao does provide a lot of options. And its always good to have more options! 

In terms of the buying experience it was pretty hassle free. You can use paypal and they take photos when the parcel arrives at their warehouse, so I do recommend them. The only thing I am unsure about is the difference in shipping prices. I'm not sure how much of a difference in cost it would make ordering directly from taobao.

How does the referral code work?

absolutely no clue about the benefit.  I assume that they would give you some free shipping on future items if you referred someone?  

As for shipping, the Mayfair VESC seller said that for international buyers to go through their aliexpres site, which bumps the price to 109 ea w/ free shipping.  So I think if I did a larger order from taobao incl most stuff, it would probably be less to do mass shipment from Superbuy

Well I've hit a significant road block, the clone vanguard breathed its last and has been broken in action... :frowning: 

I can already hear the premptive cries of "I told you so" :stuck_out_tongue: It is very disappointing since I had high hopes for this board but I guess its a good $75 lesson to not put your trust in cheap chinese decks. The split occured whilst I was testing the flex on flat ground and I hear this sickening crack straight through the middle...

The only thing to do now is to move onto bigger and better things :smiley:

The way it's looking, this build is no longer a budget build since I'd like to splurge on a new Loaded deck to replace the crummy clone which is now in the bin.

I'm currently looking to buy either a flex 3 vanguard or a flex 2 dervish sama. I'm leaning more towards the dervish Sama since it's cheaper than the vanguard, with a longer wheelbase, larger width for better stance and being a drop-through the center of gravity is lower. On the clone deck I always felt that it was way too high from the ground, especially with the 97's and that was without risers.

Price is in aud incl. shipping

Have received most of the wiring and solder I'll need to start the battery pack so I thought I'd get the VESC's configured using a PSU in the meantime. What do we call them now after the TM fiasco? Maytech drv cooker? Maytech funner outrunner runner? Credit to @longhairedboy :) I've taken some closeups of the maytech drv cookers on my phone but will post some proper photos as well.

Still undecided on which loaded deck to purchase. The vanguard is the best candidate but also more expensive than most of Loaded's other offerings. The Icarus, Dervish Sama and Tan tien are all roughly 20 bucks cheaper than a Vanguard flex 2 :frowning:

I've also updated the title to more accurately represent this build and the contents of this thread.

It doesn't have to be a Loaded deck :) Anything that catches my eye really, practicalities are considered but aesthetics are very important to me as well. That DB coreflex you linked to looks really good! They are cheaper than loaded decks but no one sells them locally, which means shipping alone came to almost $90 when I tried to check out, so it ends up being more expensive. I have looked at other popular offerings from brands like jet, landyachtz, DB, but a lot of them are either out of stock or shipping to Australia is unreasonably expensive. It does severly limit the available alternarives and due to Loaded's presence and size as a company, they have established a larger market and customer base in Australia compared to others.

Changed the 4mm bullet conectors on the phase wires to 5.5mm connectors with a few layers of extra shrink tube to try and minimise phase wires shorting as much as possible. The stock male bullet connectors seemed a bit inadequate and the maytech drv cookers have 5.5mm female connectors already :slight_smile:

Configured both of the Maytech vescs through BLDC-tool and everything went very smoothly. As a complete noob to the VESC it was surprisingly easy, everything's working fine on the bench so far. 

The only thing which is really concerning is when I switch off the mini remote the VESC goes full throttle! When the vesc is on and I turn off the remote the pulsewidth percentage display goes to 70%, hence why the motor starts accelerating when the signal is lost. How do I fix this?

There is also an rpm difference between the two motors when controlling both vescs through ppm splitter. I've double and triple checked that all my values are identical across each vesc, especially the ppm pulsewidth settings and even after rectifying 1 or 2 ms in pulsewidth the rpm difference continues. Here's a video, you can see that one motor always starts before the other, at 100% throttle each motor then reaches the same rpm.

https://youtu.be/LVo4z0DGI_4

Here are my vesc settings for both vescs, they're identical across both

You have to rebind to reset neutral PPM, at least for the winning controller. I imagine this is similar since the behavior is the same.

@benwong I'm using ppm splitter. So each vesc is setup independently then connected to the same receiver.

@JLabs Sweet, yep I'll see if the issue is present when I finally road test it.

@Jinra The link you gave gives instructions which solve a binding issue, but my issue isn't a binding issue, but a difference in rpm when applying the throttle. Side-note the remote connection and automatic binding is awesome on the mini remote. It binds instantly every time and the range is ridiculous!

I only used ppm splitter since many said that it's a much more reliable means of controlling a dual setup compared to can bus. With can bus if one vesc gets cooked then the other enters the shadow realm as well i.e. dead :dizzy_face: ppm splitter is much easier to implement as well.

Maybe someone can clarify all that?

Well I've mostly finished this build but I only got to ride this board for a few days and you'll see why. But firstly here's a few pics of the build process for the battery pack.

I hand soldered the 10S4P pack using 12awg equivalent solid copper wire and 11mm wide copper braid with a 60W watt iron I got for $22 from ebay. It held up extremely well even after 4 hours of continuous use on max setting.

Here's my setup of organised chaos! Living in college does present challenges in terms of available space but itâ€™s easily overcomeable.

I've used duct tape as opposed to hot glue to secure the cells since I wanted each individual cell to be easily replaceable. Each cell is pre-tinned with solder, making sure to minimise heat transfer to the cell, with each cell only needing a max of a few seconds for a good bond to form.

11mm wide copper braid is used for the serial connections. Not sure what AWG equivalent this would be but it's very wide!

The separated packs are joined with 10AWG wire.

I'm currently using the DPS5015 coupled with a 48v 360W led array power supply which easily delivers 6 amps or more for quick charging and with adjustable cutoff voltage.

If I had the opportunity to do it again I don't think I would hand solder a pack of this size... It took me at least 6 hours, bear in mind I've obviously never done something like this before and I'm sure I could get better at it but I don't think it's worth practicing something like this. Just buy a spot welder and if you're really short on money sell it once you're done!

Now comes the sad part. Unfortunately I didn't take any photos of the finished setup for this build before I rode it but essentially it ended with the motor mounts giving up all together after a few days of riding :( 

Now I'm going to be perfectly honest, once the build was finished I rode it and beat the hell out of it for 2 days straight. After waiting in anticipation for over 3 months all I wanted to do was ride into the sunset and all through the night. Well that's exactly what I did and holy shit balls it was fucking amazing!! It was honestly the most fun I've had in ages. Way more fun than the Bajaboard that I rode sometime ago. I rode it up and down 25% gradient hills continuously, I rode it on the beach, in the rain, on the footy ovals, basically whatever the terrain and whatever the weather I rode through it :) 

So here is my verdict on some of the parts after abusing the crap out of it the past two days:

**The motor mounts:** Well obviously as I said they failed only after a short time of use. No they didn't snap in half or anything drastic but the screws that hold the mount in place came loose and dropped the motors on the ground. I made sure to use loctite on all screws and let it cure for 48 hours. The reason the mounts loosened is simply a design flaw. The point of contact is only on the screws themselves since the plate doesn't sit flush on the truck hanger. Additionally the position and orientation of the screws is such that there is not enough clamping force exerted on the mount onto the hanger. Just take a look at the photo and you'll see what I mean. From a design perspective the mount offers no where near the amount of structural bondage to the hanger that other mounts would provide. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/2/52494997629a8f7e07e62fd18ecc553e1ef81984.jpg" width="656" height="500">

**Maytech vescs:** These were the parts I almost expected to fail. But after doing consecutive hill climb after hill climb they held up just fine and performed beautifully. I have the end cutoff temperature set at 90 degrees C and never once did it hit that. The brakes are way too strong at the moment so I'll have to reduce max brake amps. 

Note that I only weigh 60kg or so, That definitely plays a part in the amount of stress put on the electronics. Thus at a max of 30 amps each they aren't really under very high loads especially in a dual configuration. Thus the outcome will most likely be very different if these vescs are used in a single drive config with a more moderately sized user, decide carefully and buy according to your use case scenario. Even though these have performed fine so far, just spend the extra cash on a more reliable vesc.

**Jlabs sealed motors:** Even though they don't look so good after being scraped along the ground they are awesome. Great protection with the sealed  design and they never got remotely warm, even after extremely steep hill climbs consecutively, obviously me only weighing 65kg plays a part. 

**Trucks:** the trucks were fine during my testing. They look like Paris clones I guess. The bushings on these make them super carvy and not really suitable for speeds over 30km/h. 

**Deck:** Well as you already know the deck snapped in the middle. So I duct taped the shit out of it and rode it anyway! You may think that this was the dumbest thing I could possibly do and I agree with you! But it did hold up after my abuse and I will no longer ride it ever again. Already ordered a brand new flex 2 vanguard ;)

**So should you buy from Chinese vendors?** I think the short answer is no. I was really hoping I could save a significant amount of money but in the end I could've saved a lot more  if I had just bought quality parts to begin with. Sure the maytech vescs are holding up for now but I cannot recommend the deck or any of the mechanical kits that sell on taobao. In the end whatever you build you want it to last. By buying quality components or making your own quality parts you end up saving money in the long run since you're not constantly replacing things. Nor should you be putting your safety in the hands of inferior components. 

**So what now?** I'll be replacing mostly everything I think needs upgrading with better more quality components. This starts with the deck which I'll be replacing with a flex 4 vanguard. The trucks are going to be replaced with 44degree midnight satin red caliber II's with enertion style dual motor mounts. I've also purchase genuine 90mm 75A ABEC flywheels. This build will be on hold until everything arrives, eta for the mounts is probably another month :sweat: In the meantime I might pull the battery apart, add a bit more reinforcement and insulation and measure each parallel pack. Until then, stay tuned ;)

Went out for my first long distance ride. After epoxying the mounts in place they are rock solid :) Rode all the way to bondi and back which I guess is around 15km or so. After that ride the first thing I feel should be changed is top speed. At 37km/h it simply isn't fast enough for keeping up in traffic. I thought speed wobbles would be an issue with the flexy deck and super carvy trucks but after practising speed tucks it seems much easier.

But of course every ride so far has ended with something breaking, but this time the ride ended abruptly after an SUV ran straight over my board... The trigger got caught in my pocket and the board flew off into the oncoming traffic :scream: I shouted out for them to stop but to no avail... 

I assumed the worse of course but was relieved to find that only the 2.4Ghz receiver and a few cells had suffered damaged.

Yep I'm positive, I used these ports for charging a number of times and didn't have any issues until today, plugged it in and kaboom...

So just today I ditched the old chinese deck and bought a second hand flex 4 Vanguard from gumtree! We met up and it turns out that the seller is on the forums! Thanks to @overint for the Vanguard! More pics to come ;)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/3/83d9e950fd062acf912d5e16cffbf60a0127ff29.jpg" width="614" height="500">

@benwong you should be able to get a good deal on a second hand deck!

My abec flywheels finally arrived in all their juicy 90mm 75A goodness!

I'll be honest my biggest motivation for upgrading was mainly for aesthetic reasons. Wasn't really a fan of the big ass yellow flywheels and these came up for a "good" price. But really these are super expensive even 2nd hand, the flywheels alone cost more than the vanguard I bought ðŸ˜¦

Just got a new receiver after the previous one was smashed after being run over by a car. 

Downloaded the speedtracker app and top speed was pretty much bang on with the esk8 calculator. Max shown was slightly downhill. After a few days of riding 40kmh begins to feel really slow. The desire for more speed is real!

I brought the vanguard clone through taobao. Good experience getting it etc, shipping price was killer. I agree with every single point you said about the board feel disconnected etc. I rode it twice and just said nah, don't like it. Literally will give it away to you if you wanted a spare. I'm in Melbourne

Yeah definitely. The 2nd hand vanguard that I bought is really a night and day difference compared to the crummy clone.

@will_manners, is it possible to use this kit with 6355 motors?

I'm asking only because I saw on the item page that this kit fits 5055/5065 motors. I contacted the seller if a 63xx motor will fit as well, and his answer was yes. I can see that you and also @Baz_L are using 63xx motors, I just want to clarify this before placing my order. How can it be that it supports two diefferent sizes?

Many thanks.

It depends on what type of 63xx motor you use. If you have two sets of holes yes. Check your specs.

Thanks! It makes more sense now.

I am going to be using Maytech motor, which has 8 sets of holes.
Assuming 4 sets for 50xx mounts and the other 4 for 63xx mounts, am I correct?

Yep you'll be fine with dual 6355, there's plenty of clearance between each motor, maybe 4mm or more. Just be aware about the shortcomings of this system. Getting the alignment of the wheel pulley and motor mount is not easy.

Once you're happy with the alignment you should epoxy the mounts in place, loctite alone is not sufficient in my experience with this kit.

Yeah I read about that, I would do it. Thanks!

Do you know what is the width of the wheel puelly by any chance?
