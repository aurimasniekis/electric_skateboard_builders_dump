 This build is to sell. It's going to be for my first "showroom" complete, and since I have a thread already for the press I built to make this deck, I thought it fitting that we all see where it goes from there. 

- LHB Scarlet deck with inlaid motor phase wires on 5.5mm bullet connectors.

- those nasty 63mm R-SPECs from Enertion in a dual drive configuration on 180mm Caliber II blackouts stacked on red half inch risers with red bolts and nuts. 

- bones reds bearings in 83mm flywheel clones

- enertion pulleys and belts, will let you know when I settle on a ratio as I got two different motor pulley sets with my order

- SPACE CELL 270 wh power pack

- dual VESC

- custom box (this thread may include me creating the box form as well since it will be used to make the boxes I use with these decks from now on and will be included as an option in my shop when buying the decks)

- venom double barrels (half set as I'm keeping the stock caliber barrels and tossing the cones) 

To wrap up this initial post, here is the requisite skate porn:

Your mounts are definitely going on my future builds. I have to unload these first though because I've been sitting on them for months now. I'm also using the VESCs from enertion this time around as well, but I think I'll have to make fewer mods if I get them from @chaka next time, so that's probably what I'll do moving forward. 

It's hard having to do so much of this on paper instead of just having a ton of parts laying around to try out. lol

Sculpting the box form from a shaped peice of lumber and a section of one of my deck blanks. 

It's looking like I'm going to have to glass this one. My ABS sheets are too short by only about 4 inches, and these  sheets only come in 24" increments best I can tell.  blargh

Yeah, I think it would make for some really torquey rigs. 
Look up versahub pulleys. They have 42 and 60t pulleys that bolt right up to my wheels. They are glass reinforced plastic and are proven as durable as metal.
 Was also thinking about testing chain and sprocket setups soon too. I think if we used sealed roller chain and stainless sprockets it would sound cool.

no there isn't. It started out as a vac mold form and then i realized i didn't
t have enough play in the plastic so i decided to glass it at the last minute and now my porch is stinky and i hate the box i ended up with. So i'm just going to finish the form up as i was going to originally and find some larger sheets of abs to work with.

lol yeah i'm using red hardware. That way i can get 20% more performance out of my bolts over regular bolts. 

i didn't paint them though, i got them from amazon. 


This whole box thing has me ready for 10 more beers but i drank all my beer last night while posting utter nonsense in the lounge. Like I said I was originally going to vac form this and as soon as I posted the blue-taped form talking about how i was going to glass it instead some dude on instagram was like "hey you should have vac formed that it would have taken five minutes once your set up" and i'm like "yeah i know, i hate myself enough already, thanks." but he was right, @treenutter  is right, and i was right to begin with. And i already know what @psychotiller is thinking too. lol 

vac molding is the only way to go with these boxes and I wasted my only free day this weekend trying to take a shortcut on this one board at the last minute. There's no way in hell i'm going to be able to glass boxes for boards on a regular basis. I just won't have the time. I have to stop all this follishness and just set up to do it right. So now i have to get another 10 beers form the store. 

i'm going to box this form in for vaccing and drill some micro holes in all the right places. Then set up a conical vertical cooker using a toaster oven and some plywood and foil. Basically i'll build a station just for boxes in one corner of my garage. If i can find a corner. 

so this could take a while with all the other shit i'm juggling

Using another deck as the form worked really well once I minimized all of the hard angles on the form. That's what was giving me the bunches and bullshit. Once I got two nice slopes on either end and rounded all the corners, the fabric behaved itself. 

then i moved on to those Enertion mounts. I don't like blue. So i stripped it off with some Greased Lightning. Did you guys know that trick?

just let that anodized aluminum sit around in it for a while, occasionally stirring things around. Take them out, rinse them off, and...

@longhairedboy nice design, what weight glass are you using there and how many layers? I've lot of extra 2oz fiberglass that I use for reinforcing plywood kitchen floors and 2 yards of carbon I was thinking of making a custom box with f-glass inside for strength & single carbon fiber outer layer for looks for my planned E-MTB.

It's three layers of fabric and one layer of just resin on top. I'm not sure of the weight honestly. This is all 3M stuff. I was originally going to use this up and move onto West Systems because there's something very zen about glassing but it makes more sense in my situation to set up a vacuum forming station and switch to making ABS enclosures, so that's my plan moving forward. I may glass one or two more boxes between now and then depending on how things fall but this is definitely one of the last FG boxes I make. 

I've been approached on Instagram about some CF options. After the holidays I'm going to explore the possibility of having my decks laminated in CF including an enclosure with a lid instead of just making boxes. It will be interesting to see what comes of it because my decks are great push / downhill boards too, so i'm definitely keeping some  around for that.

We stripped down the space cell to break out the meter, button, and port, then wrapped it all back up. Planning on using silicone to suspend the components and help mitigate vibration related issues.

```
After spending a fair amount of time riding around on this deck as a downhill/push board I've decided to alter the shape a little to reduce the amount of flex even more. Unfortunately I'm going to have to lose the sexy waistline for this build. Flavor will be retained however in the tail shape and also I have plans for the front shape as well that will allow this deck to stay edgy. 

The waistline provided a clear flex point right in the center of the box that didn't show up until I had someone heavier block test and ride it around for a while. In a split box configuration (separate battery and esc boxes) this would be ideal as you could have the flex you want while knowing exactly where the flex is pivoting, so to speak. The space cell doesn't really allow for a split box design of that nature, so this specific build will be a little different in shape. 

The good news is I can do this kind of thing pretty much whenever I want because I have my own press and still have three or four uncut blanks laying around. 

All of that being said I'm considering creating boxes for this deck for a split box configuration and using the new deck shape with single box configurations. 

Some people like flex, some don't or can't have it for various reasons. I say both are valid choices and I want to offer both. 

@cmatson I'd recommend your deck shape for a lipo build due to the space constraints of the non flex regions. It would be possible to completely repack the space cell into a taller,shorter config,  of course, but I don't think most people want to do that.

I pressed all of my veneer already for this round, but I'm thinking of moving to a 9 layer process when I get my next batch of veneer. An extra core and cross would stiffen it up significantly. But in the meantime I have uncut blanks I can try a slightly different shape on which would allow me to finish up this build, and I also have this deck and two others I can use in a split box config. 

So I have options I suppose. Being such a small op really allows for flexibility and experimentation.

i needed 8 layer plus a layer of fiberglass on the top and bottom before it was stiff enough. still has slight flex. it increased the weight a lot compared to my first build so i shortened the deck and wheel base but it is still a bit heavy. that is for me at 160lbs i think 9 ply for people heavier then me would be good. or 7 or 8 with carbon fiber or those plastic sheets roarockit sells.

I haven't really figured out what I am going to do with my second space cell... still need a low KV motor and other parts before I can do anything with it.

On the other hand, I have all the parts to make a solid 6s build, so I guess that's what I'll do.

Have you looked at some of the open builds?
[/quote]

Yep, I checked out some openbuilds, most of which were pretty sweet. I'd love to be able to make my own size and everything, but I just don't see myself pulling it off..

I think I could build the frame and get everything mechanically set up, but I'd start to fall off the deep end when it comes to software and connecting all the electronics: I really just don't see myself buying all the right parts, and being able to get it all together and working properly. 

The Xcarve does require you to put it together, but it comes with everything you need and it a relatively simple package. I've seen a couple people in the RC world get them, and they were by no means experts in building CNC machines. 

All that said, I am still a couple months out from placing any sort of order, so alot could change! 

also, do you have any openbuilds that you particularly like, or have really good detailed explanations of everything? Thanks!

```
regarding the flex in my decks, last night as an experiment i added some fiberglass to the bottom of one of my decks to see if that would stiffen it up some more. We'll see where that gets us when the resin is cured. if it works, i can continue with this build as is and one-off it. If not i basically trashed a deck for science. 

I have also spoken with a guy i met on instagram who is not too far from me about carbon fiber layer options on the bottom of my decks as well as carbon fiber boxes, so that might happen as well depending on what he can do for me. That's kind of blue-sky at this point though. 

Lastly, i'm in the process of getting a quote from my veneer supplier about 9 and 11 layer kits. This will probably be the route that i go, but every option is worth exploring. 9 or 11 layers and vac formed boxes is the most likely candidate for what i do moving forward. It's probably the easiest and most flexible set up and would allow me to do more rapid prototyping. 

All of this is to say that i'm taking a multi-pronged approach to stiffening the deck (or working around the flex) so that heavier riders don't destroy their box. I like the monolithic box design because it's the most flexible as far as what components go into it. A split box design would allow the deck to flex but would require some serious hacking to get a space cell to work with it, but that's probably my second option if the quote for 9 layers doesn't pan out how i want.

```
looks like the quotes for 9 and 11 ply are not as ridiculous as i imagined. As soon as i hear back about how much the freight will be (they forgot to include that in the estimate) i'll probably just order the 11 ply kit today and start ordering those moving forward so that i'll have the flexibility to press any thickness i want. 

That being said, i'll likely be offering 7, 9, and 11 ply variations of Scarlet at different price points and box configurations. Something for everybody! thinner flexy decks in twin box configs, and 9 and 11 layer decks for monolithic box configs. Hopefully my mold can handle the extra thickness without doing something retarded. 

yes i still have the box thing to work out. I have everything i need to build a vac forming set up, so i'll probably be doing that while i wait for the veneer to show up.

He'll yeah! bounce testing has revealed a significant drop in deck flex with the added patch of fiber glass. Now I just have to sand it down cleanly and paint it.

I tested by standing on both my black metal push board and the recently fiber glassed scarlet I'm using for this build. Jumping up and down on both has revealed that the red one is no longer flexing any significant amount (for me anyway) so I'm going to finish up this build. Maybe I'll test a split box config on the black one next.

God that black deck is just so sick- I especially love the border around the griptape.. and the red splattered logo... and the coke griptape... 

I need to build something on your deck but I just haven't figured out what...

Thanks! Black metal scarlet did turn out to be a pretty fierce looking beast. Was on it in my bare feet and that coke bottle grip felt great. 


given the flex if you want to go with one long box i would do a wooden box and maybe glue it to the deck and clamp it, then use some sort of lid. The one you did on that arbor was absolutely gorgeous. otherwise, you can get away with an ultralight ultrathin fiberglass box if you also fill that w-cave channel on the bottom with about 10-15 layers of fabric and resin. I already forgot how many layers i used in this one. 

i just did a stand and jump block test with the box bolted on and it didn't crack after repeated jumping, so i think we're good. I'm out in the garage right now re-staining the wood i sanded and am planning on painting the fiberglass after taping it off. its getting coke bottle grip as well.

I think I will do a split enclosure 6s build.. similar to my pocket rocket, but with wood enclosures and styling more like my arbor. Plus I will incorporate a better charging port, xt90 anti spark loop key, volt meter, etc. 

But first, I'm going to buy an X-carve :smiley: I'm so close to being able to afford one, and right now I'm in the process of building a board to sell to someone who has wanted me to make them one for a long time.. hopefully after making their board, I will buy the X-carve, and then whip up some sweet wood enclosures matched perfectly to your deck's w-concave!

I imagine the build to be a good cruising board for when I don't want the power of the space cell, and when I want to let others ride my board. The one problem with the space cell is that if you aren't expecting it, the trigger sensitivity is a bit much- especially for someone who is riding an eboard for the first time and have no clue about how fast it can actually go...

ok so i finally got the vescs configged and enough of he flex out of the deck to put this beast together. She's 19.8 pounds of spit and venom and once i got the box on it was time for the trigger test. So i grabbed up my Chief Trials & Engineering Inspector so he wouldn't get run over and we did this thing.

I don't know the clearance you have, but a panel mount usb would make a clean solution. In my book, square holes are a pita, i like sticking to round holes.

Like this for example

I have a question @longhairedboy.
If you are ruining dual vesc's, but not using canbus and instead just splitting receiver signal. Can you program your vesc's one at a time? My concern is that they will both be powered up while I update one.
```

---
## \#58 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-01-09T17:16:01.532Z Reads: 195

I think one at a time is the only way to program them. its ok to have them both on and only one plugged into the PC. 

Unless i'm mistaken, you just give them identical setups and tell them to both use PPM. Since they are each independently receiving an analogically split signal they must each act as if they are the only vesc at play. 

Which is kind of a shame really because you're using more wiring to do less amazingness. using the CAN bus allows them each to understand what the other is doing at any given point. Not to mention traction control which can only be a good thing, even if most people don't use it. 

i'm telling you this despite the fact that i sell analog signal splitters on my site. lol

I just want both to do the same thing.  Personally I don't believe anyone will ever prove traction control does anything on a longboard. And a little "loose" is a good thing on a longboard.

agreed- the wheels bounce around enough on pavement as it is; I just don't see traction control changing anything. 

It's a pretty good marketing point though to say your board has traction control :smile:

So i did some street testing today.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BAVOi20hBgT/?taken-by=longhairedboy

Holy shit this board is awesome! The way it handles carves into turns at speed is amazingness. Between the VESC doing its thing and the w-concave constantly putting grip on my feet where i need it most, this board is the sweetest ride. 

I didn't bother to double-barrel the trucks, i just left the cones in and tightened the nuts down to about 4-5 threads. No problem with wheel bite at all, but i think i'm going to wedge the rear wings where the wheels would hit if they ever did anyway. It carves deeper than i'm used to but i didn't seem to catch any hint of wobble, the thrucks stayed snappy at speed and still alowed me to whip around sticks and shit. 

I'm going to adjust the trigger sensitivity a little, but not too much. I was able to get used to the way it accelerates rather quickly. 

Oh and the singing.. its real. I LOVE the singing its so beautiful to my geek ears.

made this 9 mile run and still had 30% battery left. I'll do a full range and a full speed test later.

hit 22mph without even trying, totally unintentional. *cough*

i was looking at those, but i don't have room in my box. With these i can craft my own little panel and the exterior will be smooth and flush once filled with epoxy. I have to epoxy the fuel gauge still anyway and refinish the box. 

Street testing VESC settings is getting the board dirty, so i'm going to have to tear everything down to re-polish anyway.

How about some real world, sane speed commuter class range testing? 

So i took Scarlet out onto the trails this weekend and kept the speed down for the most part and just tried to get an idea of what maximum range i could get out of her when not trying to kill myself in warp drive. 

I took it from 100% to 4% battery and this is what it looked like:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BAnfLy1hBgg/?taken-by=longhairedboy

Those split averages include stops to check voltages, check for things clogged in the belts, slowing down around people, street crossings, etc. those are not averages from continuous speeds, but they do give you an idea. For the most part i was trying to keep the trigger around 15mph. 

Also, i added USB port access to the box so i could update and tweak VESC settings without tearing into it every time.

yeah im not sure what i was expecting either on dual 6355s, but there were some slopes involved, this wasn't all flat. over all its not too bad. 

i'm going to cram as many 18650s in there as I can one of these days.

I went on a ride going at least 90% throttle most of the time and ran until my Arbor pocket rocket was completely dead (3.3v per cell actually). 

My bro and I went 7.1 miles total and the space cell *claimed* that it still had 89% charge when my little board died... and I am using a single 6355 R-Spec. 

Also, if you remember @onloop said his single raptors were much more efficient than the dual motor ones.

I'd like to see how many amps I am pulling cruising around at 15-20mph compared to what LHB is pulling at those same speeds: it'd be an interesting and beneficial comparison for those of us that don't have hills to worry about, and simply need a longer range.

and just to show the ride I was talking about, here's a video I whipped up:

Do you have low voltage cut-off set in the ESC? if so i suggest you disable it. The SPACE cell has built-in LVC its best to let it manage the end point.

might be able to get that from a single drive running on fewer elevation changes and limiting to about 12mph. 

honestly though.. 15 miles and my feet were dying, even with my arches being cradled with that w-concave. and i did this twice in one day. We've already hit a solid commuter-class range landmark here, but why not? maybe i'll drop one of the motors and see how she does on just one.

Sorry for the confusion @onloop

My little arbor (with lipo batteries) ran out after 7.1 miles, and the space cell (on my other board, which my brother was riding) still had 89% charge at that point.  

So the space cell board could've gone so much further, but my pocket rocket ran outa steam...

@longhairedboy This upcoming weekend I have *nothing* to do because it's the weekend after midterms, so I'll probably go on some insane 20+ mile ride to test the range of a single motor setup.

dropped the second motor and told the VESC what was happening with a quick config update.
