Wow, there is heat sinks then there is this thing. HUGE! Does the sink ever get warm or even kinda hot?

Really nice build, wish I had one in my stable.

Thanks! The big heat sink that I started with got a little warm. The smaller one im using now gets a bit hotter but not hot enough to burn you or anything. It definitely makes a huge difference on long hill climbs

Quick question- are you 100% satisfied with the Trampa motor mounts? I've burned through my second set of Scram "light weight engineered" mounts on my mountain board and want to upgrade to something much more durable. Debating between belt or chain. Thoughts?

yep i am satisfied. The Trampa mounts are solid. Crashed at all sorts of speeds broken bones etc but the mounts are still going strong. I like the belts, though i have never used chain to compare them to. I think if i do change it will be to the direct drive form www.e-toxx.com
