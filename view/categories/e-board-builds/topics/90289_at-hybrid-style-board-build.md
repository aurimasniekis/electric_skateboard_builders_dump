For this board i wanted an hybrid AT style board that looked simular to an evolve  performed better and dident break the bank.

Deck:
For this build i used a bamboo maple deck from skateshred it has a bit of flex but not much.

I've just fitted ones of those motors on a single motor street build, seller on aliexpress was doing it for ¬£20 ($26) shipped - bargain

Looks great, and thanks again for using my enclosure design. You've really proved my concept in a spectacular fashion. Can't tell you how stoked i am that you spent the time and effort to print those parts out, especially since there are myriad other options out there.

I'll sleep happy this evening üòÅ

Well one of it. The at deck should be fine since is made for that. Although I would like to try AT wheels also on the BullyDeck but I was afraid of wheel bite. I should get it in the next 10 days finally.

Update: I've been riding this board for a little over a week now and it's been amazing! This was my first time useing pneumatics on a board and i absolutely love it to the point where i now go over bumps on purpose!
I finally did a proper range test and i got an incredible 17.5 miles out of the board's battery - going full throttle 90-95 percent of the time with no noticeable voltage sag until I hit my vesc's low voltage cutoff! Below is a pic of the log from my range test ride. The reason it only shows 16.9 miles is because by mistake i dident have the tracker running for the first half a mile.

This has gotta be one of the best affordable AT builds I've seen. What do you have your low voltage cut-off set to? And what temps did the battery get to during your range test ride?
```

---
## \#16 Posted by: M.Hboards Posted at: 2019-04-19T13:22:20.425Z Reads: 132

```
My low voltage cut off is as follows-

Start- 34v

End- 31v

I dident check the temperature of the battery at the end of the ride but i do have the ability to as i have a Bluetooth bms on my battery that has 2 temp sensors that go into the pack but i don't know how accurate it is. However i did feel the motors and like i expected they were a bit warm but not alarmingly hot.

Cool. What do you have your motor and battery max/min currents set to?
```

## \#18 Posted by: M.Hboards Posted at: 2019-04-19T13:50:42.473Z Reads: 126

```
I believe i set both my motor and battery currents at 30,-25 i know it sounds weak but start up/ acceleration/ breaking is strong & super smooth and i never feel that I'm lacking power! I may raise my currents up to 60,-25 or -30 but currently I don't see the need for it as there's plenty of power!

```
Just did another long ride and my battery temperature ranged from 90-98 degrees  Fahrenheit throughout the ride but keep in mined it was 88 degrees outside and the  temperature sensors are within the enclosure which is probably hot inside.

It's currently very tight in there as you can see in the pic below from a test fit i did but if you use a much smaller bms( and maybe even a smaller speed controller like a dual v4 flipsky or a unity) you may be able to  squeeze a 12s4p but it would be tight.

Do you mean a bestech bms? If yes which one? If it's a larger one you defiantly need to top mount the focboxes.

sorry its actually this one here https://buildkitboards.com/collections/batteries/products/bestech-d140-charge-only-bms?variant=12511076974686

Quite small in size

I don't think that bms and focboxes would fit in the enclosure the only way i see it fitting without top mounting is if you have a longer deck you can print another piece of the enclosure.

 @Eboosted and @Kaly make enclosures for that deck that will work.

i seen these a while ago, but they are quite expensive for enclosures. since i got to convert it to AUD its almost as much as the cells for the battery, so thats why i opted into the 3D printing method to try and bring the cost of my build down since its almost hit 4k. considering a roll of petg is only $37 i would use about 2 rolls to make 1 enclosure and i need 2

Loved the design of this enclosure but wasnt sure if it was going to work with that deck.

There are a few designs for trampa enclosures on thingiverse however for the amount of flex you have in a trampa deck and if you plan on doing a lot of heavy offroading i wouldn't recommend 3d printing an enclosure. 


This is starting to take this thread off topic, maybe you can start a new topic for this thanks.
