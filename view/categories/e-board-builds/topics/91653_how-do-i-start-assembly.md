I have all my parts, not sure where to actually start building, never done one before. I was just going to copy a youtube video? 

Are there any step by step by guides on the forum?

I was going to
attack trucks
assemble motor mount (not sure all the steps for doing this)
line up everything else for enclosure assembly
waterproof bms / vesc

install battery and connect everything and drill in enclosure
```

My advice: look for other people builds. They usually put all the steps and pics

I feel your pain so much. I accumulated so many parts and I legit had nervous shakes when going to assemble everything.

Tell me about your setup

I dont take any particular order i just do what i can with the time i have for the day. Id say start simple with the deck trucks and motors and pullies then do the electeonics.

Battery, enclosure, deck, trucks, wires, ESCs, motor mounts, motors & mechanicals, wheels, remote, programming, test ride, disassembly, water sealing, loctite

Always look 3 steps ahead of where you currently are

:slight_smile:
6374 single motor
caliber 2 trucks
100mm flywheel clones
all the parts for a drive train
bms
acryllic for waterproofing
 kydex sheet for enclosure
and stuff to make the battery, which I will deal with later I want to assemble the mechanical parts first

All of them that don't have nyloc nuts.  Every one.  Including the grub screws on the motor pullies and everything.  But only after a test ride.  And stop multiple times during the ride to make sure bolts aren't backing-out.

Set up your mechanical parts to where you can stand on the board with wheels to note where possible bite might occur. Lay electronics out and make sure you're set on everything before finalizing connections and enclosure

You literally use loctite on every bolt that doesn't have a nyloc nut.  If you show me a photo of a certain bolt, I can answer more in-depth.

Couldn't help it.  It is always hard to know where to start but I always start with what I least like doing.  Thats fitting the enclosure on your beautiful new unblemished deck.  
That motor mount is not attached there my friend.  Get it hooked up and put the wheels on.  Loosen the trucks and see whether the motors hit the deck when you lean over.  A lot of this is try and see.

I didn't receive any screws small enough to fit this, but it seems like it's locked once I twist it, is that normal?

Take off the roadside bushing.  Then you can push the trucks side-to-side and make sure the mounts and motors clear the deck.  Put the motor as high as possible but without hitting anything.  Leave 5mm gap.

There isn't enough space to put the wheel on

Can the mounts slide together more without the motors touching?

You might need a longer axle

Turns out the wheel pulley doesn't fit on my caliber 2 so that's wrong.

Yeah there isn't enough axle on a standard caliber truck to make those style of wheel pulleys work. Couple options, either E-caliber trucks torqueboards 218mm or grind off some of the hanger on your current truck. All are valid options.

There should be plenty of info on the forum here on how to grind down a truck.

Okay, im going to grind off a little of the end of the trucks, and use a rubber mallet to get the motor mount farther back.

Which part of the truck should I grind off?
