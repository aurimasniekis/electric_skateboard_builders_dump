Hey.
I haven't made build threads before. But I have gotten so much from this forum so I thought I would share too. 
I'm a cnc machinist. I designed some parts and cut them at work. 
I'm happy to share any files, just ask. 
Build is already complete, so this is not a build thread. More like documentation. 

Build specifics : 

Trampa Holypro. 

MBS Matrix II Pro trucks. 

E-toxx matrix 2 baseplates. 

Dual APS 6384 130 kv motors. 

Flipsky dual 6.6 /w custom cnc heatsink/enclosure. 

My own cnc motormounts. 

Trampa superstar hubs. 

Trampa 200mm/8" soft threads tyres for offroad. 

Innova 200mm/8" slick cut tyres for asphalt. 

Trampa 125mm gummies for nice asphalt. 

Metr.at Pro module

16/66 gearing for 200mm wheels - 450 htd5

16/40 for 125mm gummies - 375 htd5

The reason for this gearing is then I don't have to worry about belt tension when changing wheels and belts of chosen length. 

200mm calculated pulley distance is 115.58 mm. 

125mm calculated pulley distance is 115.92 mm

This small difference doesn't really matter when swapping wheels. 

Difference in speed is less than 1 km/h. üòÅ

Comments and suggestions are always welcome üòä

First a shot of the complete build on its maiden ride. 

![IMG_20190405_184220|250x500](upload://byV8f6iwCjXEcYy2wIytTLefyfx.jpeg) 

First package arrived from trampa. I bought a full mtb. Heelstraps and all. 

![IMG_20180906_144054|250x500](upload://lJcxtNNGvl1vfJQ4EslOsxD4yOn.jpeg)

I didn't like the way the springs on the trampa trucks felt. And the top spring adjusters would interfere with my vesc housing on top of the rear. So I sold the trucks and opted for the full urethane bushing on the matrix II trucks. Adjustable from the underside too. Felt much better. 

![IMG_20180907_191638|690x345](upload://fCFGuugohV6cwJSi6TijZsWhAO0.jpeg)

But then I found the thread about weak injection molded baseplates. And I don't go slow. So the obvious solution was of course some jenso love!

![IMG_20190118_123109|250x500](upload://qqs1Pb7pCG6HGJgxQGgya5xsjGV.jpeg)

Reverse enginerding the mbs channel truck geometry is an iterative process. 3d printing is nice for this.

![IMG_20180911_210056|250x500](upload://jPvYqprcZdZaYbYNtemhAxaQUtk.jpeg)

I designed some motor mounts and made them at work. 7075.

My attempt at some form of water proofing the sensors in the motors

![IMG_20190214_134238|250x500](upload://3pTeQlO6UVn8CbcQEoyeyVmy11r.jpeg) 

And loctite 648 the steel pulleys to the motors shafts at the correct spacing.

I think they're supposed to be. Mine weren't exactly the same. The plastic baseplates were a little easier to fit. The E-toxx didn't fit exactly. They won't bend like the mbs did. drilled the holes in the trampa bigger to accommodate this discrepancy, I think 5.8 mm was enough. I don't know how the new mbs metal baseplates fit the hole pattern on trampa. Let me know?

So I used the flipsky dual fsesc 6.6. I wanted to make a different mounting option. And somewhat inspired by kug3lis I wanted to integrate a heatsink.
Designing in solidworks. 

![IMG_20190114_222124|250x500](upload://dLzZlRWNyhNsbx976RHuIvXXMfL.jpeg)

And machining the heatsink/bottom of enclosure.

The fsesc 6.6 dual fits nicely.

The lid is fixed to the bottom with an oring between two countersunk bolts. 

![IMG_20190414_114936|250x500](upload://eY2aavOTyk2SvHWFgkvNNODj9e7.jpeg)

Lights and reflectors are mandatory by law in Denmark, so. 
I 3d printed a mount for an ebay front light.

Pla cracked very fast. First run

![FB_IMG_1555235648897|265x500](upload://lHiwZmJ9E4oHVY3pe7QB7DuaKMh.jpeg)

So I printed it in petg instead. This has held up so far. It was a little rattly so I put a thin silicone sheet in between. 

![IMG_20190407_230400|250x500](upload://9HWZOV7Q2Bz8w4mHyWYWZOQwrtO.jpeg)

Rear lights. And reflective tape on the motors.

Hey brother that board I sick!  Being a machinist helped quite a bit I'm sure! lol
How much did parts cost approximately w/o labor and would you be willing to at least machine the same parts that I can't purchase myself and sell them to me?
Or even sell the entire board or build me one??! Give me price if interested, please.
I live in Orlando, Florida.

@RadleyBradley
I have spent around 2400$ on this just in purchasing. then account for hours spent designing in cad. programming in cam. and actually machining. I pay nothing for parts or material when making it myself. i like my boss :D..  I would however need to pay for 3rd party services e.g. anodising.or other surface treatment
The deal with my boss is, i can make parts for me, its not okay to machine stuff to sell. 
I' m afraid i cant and wont help you with your request. 

what i can do is share my files. and you can see if its worth it to you to have it machined locally..
however. everything is metric. just fyi.

@Gaza65 
so cool :smile: . I would love to try a 4x4 to see if the steep gravel climbs im having trouble with would get much easier. but cost just adds up quickly. e-toxx gears drives are so nice. also a little prohibitive pricewise. esp for 2 :D

you prefer mbs F5 bindings ? i have thought about buying them. see if its better than the trampa ones.

```
Don¬¥t get it wrong, I¬¥m happy with my Trampa bindings as well, but as soon as it comes to comfort and fitment the F5 are just golden. My personal opinion, they sit way better on the foot. Especially if you drive without heel straps it¬¥s more likely to slip out with the Trampa bindings. They also more soft, so, for the softies in our rows that is perfect.

The heel strap is better as well. Again, that¬¥s just my opinion. Different people might see that different, but the because of the bigger straps they not moving as much as the slim trampa straps. So less adjustment during riding, jumping etc.

So far I didn¬¥t have had any issues. I was a bit sceptic about that part as well in the beginning.

Hmmm... my 8Ah Graphenes are almost done after 1 year (puffed, less capacity, getting warm). The 10Ah Graphenes from 2 years ago died last year, personally I won't buy them again. Li-ion is much cheaper in long term IMO.

I'm afraid for jumping you need a second 2WD board :laughing:

[quote="pjotr47, post:19, topic:90346"]

[/quote]

Try them and you'll recommend them, too :wink:

Every foot is different but with Trampa bindings my feet always slipped in toeside direction even with vicious griptape. The heelstraps are too small and always move down which is a problem especially when jumping, always re-adjusting after 1-3 jumps.

Trampa bindings look much better but are sturdy, MBS F5 are like a cloud. Due to the cushioning the foot is a bit more loose compared to Trampa bindings where you have more direct feel.

[quote="wapkoen, post:20, topic:90346"]

[/quote]

I was afraid, too but there is an aluminium plate above and now I trust them because they didn't break so far. I saw only once a video where a rider broke the plastic bracket but it was a sick guy doing backflips in skate park and it broke when he crashed hard on concrete after a backflip fail.

[quote="Andy87, post:21, topic:90346"]
Might even work to use the Trampa L-brackets for the MBS straps
[/quote]

Maybe on older bindings because on F5 the L-bracket and ladder strap are one piece.

I think the same ;) 

Ho shit your lipos die quick !.. But you're also a sick rider :smile: It's maybe why I'm lucky with them. 
(About lipo graphene, I ride them mostly since summer 2017 12Ah, and the 8Ah a bit after...
One pack (6s 12ah) get a bit fat, but because of me.  
I really like them, work perfectly, can charge in 1hour, cool discharge capacity (for my need), way cheaper than a 18650 pack (for me). Also, use them in a 2x series and 2x // for 12s 16 and 24Ah. (Or some time for a long trip, get a pack in the backpack is so cool and useful !)
I use a very safe parameter for them cut off start at 3.7v/cell cut off end (a bit too quick to...) 3.6v/cell.  
I know I maybe will have to change one day, but for now if I have to it will be for LiFePo4 I guess. )

My first hill was a little difficult. Really steep, and very loose gravel top layer. So traction was an issue. It pulls like a train though üòâ.. I think a lot of it is balance and keeping weight on the rear wheels. Also I needed to go from dead stop. But I got up. I've had one of my other boards cut out on the brakes going down a steep hill also. Don't know what happened. Too high current or temp. But that was scary. So I kinda fear this board might do it. It has held up so far. üòä

Was in the woods with a mountainbike friend. Also tried some trails. Lots of fun. Must've fallen like 8 times. Protection gear rules. I enjoyed the kid track the most. I could get up all the hills and the track is a little wider. Most these trails have tight turns. I will get better at them though. Maybe I can get half as badass as @rich. Really enjoy your bike park vids. Thanks for sharing üòä. Was lots of fun. Maybe I'll get some video of the track next time I visit.

Tall grass on uneven ground takes a surprising amount of throttle. Slick cuts don't help either.

Hi. @Toby-Aus  
Thanks. It's a ton of power. I cannot full throttle it from standstill. I would get hurt. It just takes off. Insane acceleration. I have climbed every hill I could maintain traction on. I Dont get off to measure incline. But pretty fucking steep hills. üòä

If you think 1 motor is alright. 2 is going to be much better. For acceleration and braking. You're gonna love it. But maybe you'd like upgrades later on. We'll see üòÅ

Have fun üòä
