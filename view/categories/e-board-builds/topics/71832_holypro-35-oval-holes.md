Hey guys I am waiting on my battery, enclosure and kaly gears etc..  to show up and wanted to know if anyone has filled in the 8 oval shaped holes on the top of the  Holypro 35 board.  The reason I am asking is I am placing the battery and electronics on the bottom of the board and I obviously can't habe the open holes.  
If any of you have pictures of your solution plus a product suggestion it would be greatly appreciated.

I'm also interested in this. I thought it would be neat to put some ws2812 LED's into the holes with some epoxy and a bit of fiberglass mat for strength.

Lol Daren! :chipmunk:

Yeah man, I ride a HolyPro 35 with holes covered. You can just stick duct tape on the bottom and complete with epoxy, flexible body filler or even hot glue and shave down the excess to make it look flushed.
