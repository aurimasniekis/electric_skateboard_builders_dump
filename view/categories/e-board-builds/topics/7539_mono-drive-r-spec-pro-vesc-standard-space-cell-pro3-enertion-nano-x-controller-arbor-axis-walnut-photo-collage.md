Hey guys, 

Im building my first eboard and have been doing research for the past 3 months. I'm 15 and i live in belgium. 

**Parts:**

The mono drive r spec pro+ (6374 190kv motor)
Enertions vesc (i really hope it will work. I'm really sceared since ive read al the topics about failing enertion vescs)
Enertion nano x controller
Space cell pro3 (this because it has a excellent range, good inbuild protection and room for the vesc so i dont need to buy another enclosure)
Arbor axis walnut photo collage deck. It has 8 plys of maple wich should be enough. it doesnt have much flex, because i am only 64 kg.

Here are some picturs, there is only one truck cause the second one still needs to arrive together with wheels and motor pulley! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/cfed73eca1cdd80a2679b12c6b7492af84ebb5a7.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7f115a3d782a3cc109e9afe8cf9db4948adb6f8b.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fa1729f439db1c8aa70a32308f6a1e126189280a.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c504906a9a93e8f0c007017aad5e94966635a213.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0cc51b80e0e4b60b6c6abfe54065f835d353796e.jpeg" width="375" height="499">

Don't be scared with Enertion VESC. For me it always worked just perfectly.
