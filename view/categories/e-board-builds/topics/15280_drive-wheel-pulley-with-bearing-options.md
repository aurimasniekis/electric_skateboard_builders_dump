I found only two options for these kind of pulley, Enertion and Evolve.

Are there any other brands that work with these design currently available in USA?

Do you have the drive pulley for Abec 11 wheels? 

I don't want to use the ring and bolts through the Wheels setup, I'd like to use the same design of Evolve or Enertion

sure; it will look ultra sleek ! it's in pre order as these cost a LOT to produce in small quantities . They are monobloc AL7075.

So is there any new pulleys out there that use bearings that people have come acros?  Going thro old and older threads trying to fined some more options not finding much so time to ask.

#Okp
Unik don’t have Abec11 any more.

#Enloop
Enertion seem to only sell VESC or RTR boards.

Evolve are plastics with out bearings now.

#riverside.rider I got some E caliber on the way so should have the space for a extra bearing in the pully on the next build.
