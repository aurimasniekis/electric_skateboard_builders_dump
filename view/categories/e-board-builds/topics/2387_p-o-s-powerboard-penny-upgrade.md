So ... Picked up a P.O.S. New 12v Powerboard with key fob remote for $15 bucks...What I really want is to make use of is the drive train

I wanna slap on a NTM 5060 on this...with a 6s pack ... If it works...should be a Widow Maker of a penny board...

Has anyone seen this board? 

I know I'll have to switch out the esc and the battery compartment could carry a 6s lipo .... If it don't fit...I guess I'll just make my own enclosure üëçüèª and I'll have to switch the remote as well...

Any other ideas abt how to approach this modification?

So if it allows me to over volt it....how can I switch out the on/off action with a trigger remote? I'll prob have to switch the esc?

that would be cool if it worked, but you won't get much range without a jumbo battery that might not even fit under the board. Either way, its a steal for $15. That drive chain looks like it should work well.

It's a 12v battery in there which I plan to switch to 6s lipo...that should give it some legs...and depending on the size of the box I'm hoping to get a 5000mah battery in its place...and depending on the gearing ... Maybe squeeze out 5 miles!.....and that's good enough to take anywhere especially if the board it's self is as small as it looks...which I'm hoping ... 

If this does work...ill put my stroller mod on it and see if I can give the kids a ride and burn out the motor lol

well in order for cruise control to work it needs a feedback loop from the motor to check your speed and make throttle adjustments. I don't know of any ESC other than VESC that does this.

so just incase you missed the memo, I'll fill you in.
cruise control, takes the speed that you are doing and maintains that SPEED. so if you start going up or down a hill it will accelerate or decelerate to maintain that SPEED. VESC has **Cruise control**

**perpetual steez** is what you get on a wiiceiver where the wiiceiver will maintain the THROTTLE. so if you are 50% throttle it will stay the same THROTTLE perpetually. If you start going down hill it will speed up and if you go uphill you will slow down.

for push assist you cant really use perpetual steez because you need to make throttle adjustments as you ride, the VESC cruise control is ideal for push assist.

I'm not saying you couldnt use some sort of sensored motor and program some kind of feedback into the wiiciever code.... but out the box no.

But yeah get what you mean...but again... Don't have a vesc I can play with...so......prob gonna use a heli esc.... I don't plan on going fast....so if I use a hand controler with a trigger...gonna put a stopper on it so you can't take off

either way, it still wont work they way I did it because it still needs that feedback from the motor to know what speed the board is traveling when you engage.

maybe you could make something new? foot control? magnet control? mind control?

Well got my POS in the FedEx today
 
The 12v battery is currently 8v at the moment ... The battery enclosure is broken at the places that attach it to the board (but I knew that...guess why it was $15bucks)

It has a key fob remote...not really sure what that's abt

It's at 28 inch penny board deck...

It's got this wacky truck system the Chinese like to use and 80mm wheels

Other than that ....looks brand new.... 

So the plan is...

Get that enclosure back on... 

Try it at 12v.....

Then try it with a 6s lipo....till something blows 

Once that happens.... Figure out how to mount a 270kv motor on .... 

Then put a new ESC and hand controller....

Let's see if I can mod the drive train to accept a 50/60 ntm

The wheels are bigger than I thought they would be....from first looks it seems that any of those 80mm clone wheels will do the job...

I just need to open up the motor housing and see if a 50mm motor will fit ... If that does ... Hope the shaft is long enough to hold the pulley and wheel in alignment

Looking good so far- I also think you could make the NTM work with an aluminum conversion plate. Let me know if you want me to make you one, as I have access to a CNC machine.. if you're interested, just shoot me the dimensions and we'll work it all out.

Haha not trying to sell you crap, just letting you know if you're interested and don't want to get a 63mm motor for fit ment issues. 

Otherwise, you can always go full DIY spirit and make you own plate for cheap!

Lol lets just sent the board around the world ... People could take turns tweeking it lol...The People's Board! Lol

Thanks my brother @cmatson ... I'll let you know...lets see what I can do without dragging people down with me ... Lol 

I fear that if I put that ntm on there...it may rip the belt, break the teeth of the wheel pulley or....shear the screws off wheel pulley...

I would say the weakest link here are the wheels... I did try 80mm .... Don't fit.... Looks like a proprietary skateboard wheel...so better not do any power slides on this thing

Also looks like I'll need to machine the inside where the original motor was....they have ridges which stop me from putting the ntm flush against the motor mount...plus the hole for the shat is very large which prevents me from just using a 50mm motor....

What to do? The motor mount is just bolted in...I could fashion a new bracket...? What would that cost @cmatson?

Does the motor have to be perfectly flat against your mount? if not, then the waviness could stay, and you could just add a bracket. 

I guess the only problem you may run into is not having the NTM shaft be long enough, but the motor pulley can hang off the shaft a little without any problems- I just don't know how far out it may have to go..

I'm assuming it's aluminum, so be sure to use sandpaper/flap wheel, not a grinding wheel. The aluminum can fill the pores of the wheel and it can explode. If it is steel then obviously a grinding wheel will be fine

Humm...looks like this truck by exkate CAN hold an 80mm wheel with a cog....and the molded ring with holes in the truck make it possible to attach a custom motor mount...

What to do? 
Grind the mount (use the existing mount)
...Make a mount (some sort of metal plate)
 .... Or find a mount (will @torqueboards DIY mount fit)

I'll give you my old ADS mount. Use a really big steel washer cut into a C shape and flattened out for the mount, and put the ads motor plate right in line with the truck's flange. If your pulley is 9mm then that mounting flange looks to be about 7mm ish.

Been slacking on this project.....

We are gonna try using the prop adapter to help mount the motor and see if that aligns the motor.

A soft fit seems to show the correct spacing between the wheel pulley and the motor pulley.

I will not be using the Orginal wheels...I don't think the wheels and the plastic pully will hold up and could be dagerous if they break.

Ok well the prop adapter didn't work due to spacing...

So, picked up a piece of galvanized steel and made a mount!

I've got to do the wiring and missing freaking washers!!! Ugh! Now I gotta go to the store....

But I'll try wire it up tonight and get an enclosure happening ... But we will see!

I've come back from Home Depot and have attached the 83mm wheels....

I took a glide with the wheels on...(I didn't try it before).....the stance is feet over wheels...I'll need to put a foot stop in the back so I don't bust my ass because I placed my rear foot too far back...

Well, it's a penny board...I'm going 6s @270kv 14/36 on 83mm wheels

...... I'm gonna need more band aids ü§ï Or take it down to 4s lol

In keeping with the budget nature of this build....
I'll recycle this box and re-purpose it as the enclosure....Ill need to reenforce the box, but its the perfect size to cram in a 6s battery and all the electronics

looks decent so far, but I do have a couple of friendly suggestions that I think would be cool 

1) I'm assuming that your reasoning for a "Penny" board is to make it more portable right? If so, depending on the thickness of the deck, why not drill into it a bit? You could then take apart the cells in your battery, spread them out, and fully enclose them and a VESC inside the deck

2) Voltage meter through the deck

3) carbon fiber renforcement layer (it would help with the battery modification and it would look epic at the same time)
```

Wow you really want me to put some effort in my $15 dollar score off eBay?

Lol...thank you bud... For sure I could... But this is just a fun project... At some point I'll need to switch it out to a bigger deck ... It's just too dangerous to ride this deck...a novice would street their face first time around the block lol...

The original board was made by Exkate...the trucks are those ones with a big black ball as a bushing....I've tried to tighten them to provide some stability....only a longer board will help....the Orginal design only allowed this to have a 8mph give or take...

I'm a bit worried that anything above 12mph will cause this board to have the case of the wiggles ....

Why don't you drill out some new holes toward the front and rear to lengthen the wheelbase? And use some wedges to fix the mounting angle at the kicktail.

I'll probably ride it around for a little, but I really wouldn't want anyone else to get on it for fear of them getting hurt... It's pretty wobbly ....

I was thinking that a longer deck to match the width of the wheels will provide a better platform for these types of trucks...and I was thinking of making my own deck out of a solid piece of wood...this way I can route the board to place the electronics inside ... So many voices in my head telling me to do different things...I feel like Sybil!

Well, if I were in Vegas, and also named Michael, I'd remove the tail skid, drill out new mounting holes as far out to the ends of the deck as I could, then swap the front/rear trucks, and see how it rides with the front truck mounted at an angle on the kicknose. My guess is that it would be super carvy, and you'd max out the longest possible wheelbase on that deck, making it slightly less likely to kill you. Or maybe more likely? Either way, kind of like this:

Lol. Probably. But seriously though, imo, I think that 12s + sk3 would be crazy overkill, and totally unnecessary. I took my 20+ year old Santa Cruz,  extended the wheelbase to 18", and even on 6s, it was borderline sketchy accelerating or braking too fast, and getting close to 20mph was slightly unnerving. I say get that thing running as a low key mini cruiser, and go nuts on that 55" beast. Now you got me thinking about putting my short board back together again. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2bdfb5074c2fb3b9c88e4c357be50637cc9debb7.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I think you should go with the bigger motor. but maybe not up the voltage, that way you may not end up with less un broken bones and more crushed spirits..

Ok....done (for now)

The üêí Monkey is off my back.

Below is my EXKATE POS (piece of üí©) Electric Penny Board Upgrade....

It looked too plain un-lit so I added red LEDs to the bottom for ground effect and two 15w LED lights .... so I don't bust my arse on a huge crack...

Basics: 83mm Clone wheels, Enertion 36t Aluminum pulley with 14t on the motor. 270kv Deck is 28x8 penny board the trucks are what came with it...motor mount I made with galvanized steel.

I just finished it...and haven't rode it...ill try to post up videoüìπ

Ok...Here's the first ride video 

https://youtu.be/skPi_4YEsqU


Well...it was interesting to say the least...I'm definitely one to throw caution into the wind....but Tell you....I couldn't bring myself to go faster than 10mph...lol

This thing is so squirrelly once it starts moving...You hint of going in that direction and the damn thing goes...super fast!...I'm sure the super üí© Trucks have something to do with it...

Anyhooo...the short deck form factor is best suited for sidewalk riding...need a motor with nice torque and low top speed...this would definitely be a great in a town where U can ride sidewalks or by the beach town....definitely portable and maybe a great 3rd board not a second board...

Not really an exciting build but it was good to try out for a laugh....

The next move ... Is probably get this set up on a bigger deck... It should help counter act some of the twitches.  

Thanks for watching ü§òüèª
