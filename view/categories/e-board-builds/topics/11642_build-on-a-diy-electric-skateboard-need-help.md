Hi.
I'm a 14 year old boy. My weight is about 55-60 kg (121 - 132 lbs). I'm about to soon start making my own DIY Electric Skateboard.
It would help a lot if you could give me some advice about these things. And also please help me if there are a cheaper but still as good way as this is. I'm not quite sure if i need something that i haven't found, or another thing is better (or cheaper) than the thing i showed. And say if you recommend something over another. Please leave some links:) It would be a fantastic help.

I need a deck. And i just can't find a bit cheapy one, that looks smart. If you could find one, that would be great. But it's a _Must_ there isn't death heads or something crazy on the board.

Always nice to see new builders! I started with these things at the same age as you with nearly the exact same parts. My only recommendation as a change to your list is the batteries. LiPos have caused nothing but problems for me, and they don't last nearly as long as Lithium ions. I would recommend buying a custom battery from @barajabali, it'll save you a lot of pain and he offers 1 plug charging with BMS as well

Looks good to me! I am also 14 and buying/starting my first build as well! The only thing I see is that the motor you are looking to buy is **never** in stock. I wanted to use that motor as well but I couldn't get it in stock even after months of waiting. I decided to go with a 190kv sensored motor from @JLabs for less than or around the same price. That motor is also nice because it has a keyway and cir clips spots built into the shaft so no modification is necessary, you can find them on his website http://www.electric-skateboard.market. I made my deck out of some pine I picked up from a local lumber yard for $10. I wouldn't recommend pine as it is a soft wood and chips easily. Birch, maple, or even baltic birch laminated would be the best if you can access those materials. Other than that, looks good and good luck with your build!

Ty @Smorto. Maybe i will go with that motor instead. There's just one problem: I live in Denmark:/ But i will look at it anyway.
Do you have any idea of a website that sells that kind of decks? it sounds interesting:)

I am fairly sure that @JLabs would ship to denmark but I am not 100% sure. I don't know of a website but it would be fairly simple to do yourself if you have the time and resources.

Do you have the motor on your board right now? If you have, how is it? the wires, are they too stiff or are they made of silicon? Does it get hots? Do you recommend it? Can't find out which motor to go with. It would be nice if you could help me.

I've read for like 4 hours today in this forum. I've learned a lot, but i just can't figure out a good setup for about $600. Can you pls help me with finding all the things i will need. And so it's a good setup. I think i want a 190kv motor, but the rest is hard for me to find.
And maybe leave the links and why it's a good setup.
On forehand, thanks:)

I'm trying to do the same thing, a good board under 500 euros. I spent 175 on wheels (90mm flywheels clones), pulley+belt kit, motor (sensored 6374) and remote (torqueboards trigger one) from @ajaynagra, best prices in Europe,  25 on a motor mount from a group buy here on the forum, 125 for a custom 7s2p li-ion battery pack with bms, switch and charger, i'm waiting for a 100 dollar vesc from another member of the forum and will probably buy some caliber trucks on eBay for 30 bucks. That keeps me under 500, I can probably buy some custom enclosures and stay under the budget limit

Ty, @ajaynagra.
But what with a VESC? which one is good to this setup? And which charger is best for the Lipo's? Will i need to buy a ON/OFF switch, or is it with? Do you have a good website that sells the mechanical kit to EU?

Sry that i have so many questions. But you are fantastic to help:)

Im trying to work  with @onloop with VESCx in Europe. Maybe a potential group buy. 

It might be too expensive for your budget maybe look at this if you want to wait

Hi Joakim!

I'm using the exact same parts for V2 of my build, except I'm going with li-on batteries and a BMS which gives me a one plug charging solution. For my first build I went with four 5000mah 3S batteries which was a hassle to charge. Go with li-on batteries from start and you'll be happy that you did! My lipos went puffy after only 20 charges each.

I'm in the process of building my own pack and since I'm located in Sweden I could put yours together too while I'm at it. I've already got a spotwelder and I'm just waiting for my BMS and shrink wrap to arrive. PM if you're interested.

 I bought 24 of [18650](http://www.ebay.com/itm/182247886368?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) batteries to make a 6S4P battery. Then I'm going to pair it with [this BMS](http://www.ebay.com/itm/321790732770?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) and charge it using a regular laptop charger.

The batteries+BMS+laptop charger+water resistant ports cost me about $213/1900SEK/1457DKK.

Lipos might seem like cheaper solution but eventually(for me it didn't take very long) they will break.

@UniqueSnowflakeN27 I think a lower kv motor with an 8s3p pack would work better, 6s 245 kv is only recommended if you have no hills and a low budget, as it doesn't give much torque!
@ajaynagra he had a couple lying around and he sold both now :confused:
