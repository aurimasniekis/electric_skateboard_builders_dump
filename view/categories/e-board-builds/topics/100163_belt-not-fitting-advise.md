Has anyone else had a hard time put their 265-5m-15 belt onto the torque motor mounts. I have the 63 motor mounts with orangoutang 85m tire 15m pulley. should order 280-5m-15. thanks in advance.

This is my first build, so don't kill me.

Do you have some pictures of what you mean so we can help you better?

I have the TB motor mounts as well and no problem fitting 265mm belt with a 16T-36T setup.

I'd recommend measuring the distance between the pulleys (center to center) and then going to [https://bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/](https://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/), plugging in your numbers, and see what it comes up with. I'd do that measurement with the motor halfway in the slots, so you have some adjustment in both directions.
