Hi there. I've been lurking on this forum for a while and I've recently created an account. This will be my first E Board and I'm not sure if all of these parts will work together.

So far, here is my list:



Board: DIY

Motor Mount: DIY

Trucks and Wheels (90mm 
flywheels and 180mm Paris trucks):

I'd say the higher C rating the better so the compact 6s 40c look pretty nice, you would be able to use a slimmer enclosure with 2 3s packs in series though.

How would you charge the 2 3s. That's my dilemma, would you have to charge both individually or could you charge both at once?

@Smorto would this motor be better than the turnigy motor

You could easily charge both at once, you would need a balance port adaptor like this one. Then you would need to make a charging port.

Depends on rider weight, gearing ratio, riding style, motor, voltage and a number of other things. A safe estimate would be around 6-7 miles I would say.

It's mostly your choice. The turnigy motor is slightly bigger and I think it would have a little more power. However, the DIYES motor will fit your motor pulley much easier. It's up to you in the end though, they will both work.

[/quote]

I totally agree with @Smorto Get the highest C rating you can.
Going with the 40C over the 25C batteries should substantially reduce voltage sag that would rob you of power and range. 

And speaking of range, with 5000mah at 6s your only going to see somewhere around 5-7 miles range. Depending on your weight and riding conditions.

you would do well to get 2 of the 40C 6s packs and run them in parallel for 10K mah That would get you around 10-14 miles depending on your weight and riding conditions. And it would reduce voltage sag even more.

Thanks @Smorto @Namasaki  for all the help

Would I plug the splitter adapter into the imax? Would i need a bms.
```

Yes you would plug the splitter into your charger.

No, you won't need a Bms if your using a hobby balance charger. 
Just be careful when riding that you don't over discharge your batteries. 
Mounting your voltage meter on or through the top of your deck so you can see battery voltage while riding or using low voltage alarms is a good idea.

I feel I were to get two 6s batteries and wire them in series to make a 12s battery, would I need a different charger. If so, which one

If I were to stick with 6s, would I hit 20 mph?

There is no charger that would do 12s to my knowledge  you would have to have them series then take them out and charge them separately with a six 6s charger. The highest charger I could find is a 8s and I am selling one on the forum. Or get a 12 bms.

The belt is included in that kit. A HTD5 265mm should work though.

Hi again :grinning:
Can someone explain how I can incorporate a on/off switch. Should I buy a pre made one or just use an xt90.

Xt90s loop key all you do is cut into the red wire and wire each end to ethier side of the xt90 to turn it on and off when it is in it makes the current go though off makes the positive current go away make sure to buy anti spark
