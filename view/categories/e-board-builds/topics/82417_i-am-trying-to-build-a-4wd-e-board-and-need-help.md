Hi just built a 4wd e board
I have had a lot of people saying that it would not work and I have been scammed before I bought the board however I have got the pieces and have tried it out and it is an amazing board really happy with purchase

Here is how I did it

![image|300x300](upload://AjDbWBUBS4r8YHMXMCaRZ3PxDTd.jpeg) ![15057591450|500x500](upload://o77sD4Qjts4ZqFaZIeSCZj6nHuw.jpeg) ![15427231520|500x500](upload://xVw0Q0aIQIhExzLpSUET9fmzMFw.jpeg)

Bought the 4wd esc from diyeboard
2 motors from diyeboard
Board from keeps
I bought the casing from IKEA and coated it in waterproof tape

Everything about it is perfect except has very fast acceleration and very hard brakes
If anyone know some how to sort that out please reply

I'm not sure you can program those escs. Less brake and acceleration -> swap a set of hub motors for regular wheels..

Hey dude.  Just a word of warning,  Diye is a banned company on here because of very shady operations.  Glad you got your gear without any problems but when anyone mentions them then backs are raised.  Looks like fun though and you weren't to know.  As for the harsh acceleration and brakes well thats just something you will have to get used to because it is not programmable in any way bar the remote.

Its a fully proprietary system that can't be adjusted.  The only way to change anything is to use different esc's.  Couple of unities in there or 4 vesc 4.12's and then use whatever remote you want.  Lots more investment though

Idk look for sales

Cheapest and non shittest 4wd diagonal board I can think of (buying stuff during the sales)

* 4x 4.12 VESCs - £40*4
* 4x Boardnamics mounts - $20 * 4
* 4x 6364 SK3 - £120 for 4 pieces - Hobbyking November prices, no bullshit
* Battery - Idk someone can fill that out
* Calibers - 30$?
* Deck - Whatever you can get your hands on, I just bought my dream deck for £17 posted
* Wheels - Also depends what you like, I have seen Kegels go for cheap on ebay

But 4wd is overkill, I wonder how this performs vs 2x 6880 motors (well I know which one I'd rather have)

The new versions of those esc's are pretty much bullet proof and the motors last too.  They had big issues with the 1st generation of both but now not so much.  Its still the cheapest way to get a 30mph build and the new trucks are strong as.  Talking just the hubs tho.  Not the crappy belt drive as you well know @Skunk lol
Find a vendor that will stand by the product like ownboard or wowgo.  Even meepo sell kits now and are a much better vendor.  Anything goes wrong with the kit you have now then do not expect any back up from diye.  Bunch of wankers

Those trucks broke after 7 weeks of riding. 
Was sent Replacements that started bending in 4 weeks after waiting 5 weeks for The Replacements.

Do you have lots of hills to climb? Is 4wd necessary?

Why do you want to upgrade it?  You have only just built it.  Ride it around and have some fun.  Find out what you want to change and then do some research.  Easiest way to get some more controllable input is the motor controllers but minimum spend there is $450 once you factor in the cabling and remote, shipping etc. Board will be a different animal entirely though.

Batterys and good vesc are the hardest thing to find "cheap". Batterys at least you can build yourself and save money.   But the cost of getting into that doesn't really save you money unless you're building a few batterys.

If I can count correctly you need a whopping 4 parts to make this work and about 20 mins of research

4wd esc
battery
motors
deck

I must say, your ineptitude somewhat angers me.
Your only purpose here appears to be finding someone who will gratify your purchase decisions or boast that a board with relatively shitty parts is actually awesome. 

You simply ignore answers that don't suit you. 
You put zero effort into researching basic things that have been explained many times over already. 

Wasting space and time. Yes, I'm grumpy today.
Take care. Don't street your face.

You mean the vibrations you feel in your feet or vibrations for electronics? Only way to reduce vibrations for your feet is get bigger wheels. Those hub motors don't have a lot Thane on them so you will feel everything when you ride

There are several ways to minimize vibrations.

1. Choose where you skate carefully. Only minty roads :grin:

2. Get a pair of these

3. Go flexy

4. Go pneumatic

5. Put vibration damping pads under the grip tape if the recommendations above don't satisfy you :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Hey buddy, sorry you have had rough time. This forum does not tolerate DIYeboard's business, understandably. Many will never touch Chinese parts and deride those who chose to use them, again understandable to a point. There is an etiquette to the forum which you have not followed so again it is understandable for people to be displease. Regardless of all of this, I would like to offer some advice and answer some of your questions.

Those esc's are the Version 1 and are quite poor relative to the V2 and incomparable to VESC. Shame that the 4wd kit does not use the v2 esc's. A VESC is a fully customizable ESC based on Benjamin Vedder's work, hence (V)ESC.

As for a new remote you have the RC6 currently. There is a RC7 remote which has a _marginal_ improvement that I can personally recommend.

As for vibrations, you have to ditch the hub motors or get flexible deck or wear thick shoes and get some massive rubber risers. For electronics vibration, I recommend velcroing the ESC and battery to the deck.

Trivial improvements you could do and again I could personally recommend are bushing swaps and/or truck swaps. Those trucks are the old version. Meepo sells "Shredder Trucks" that have larger bushings and I believe a more refined/reliable design. 

Assuming you are based in the US here are some alternative sites to DIYeboard

https://www.mboards.co/

https://www.meepoboard.com/accessories/ 

And here are some general purpose stores

No, you aren't.

My process goes like this:

Research > buy > research > build > enjoy for a long time

Your process goes like this:

Buy > Ask questions that search will answer > make 3 threads about the same parts looking for justification of your poor purchases > ask more questions that the tiniest bit of research would answer > whine when someone tells you that you're being silly.

We're not building the same, no. That's ok though, that board will die in under 300 miles and you can do it properly the next time.

I don't know if the PU-sleeves are swappable to bigger ones? probably not. Everything damping that is put between the wheels and your feet will remove some control of your ride, so it's really up to you to decide if you can live with the vibrations or not. 

I myself have 97mm flywheels, and as long as I don't ride on cobblestone they're fine.

All we are asking him to do is to do some research before posting questions.

Simple example. There are elaborate topics about vibration going as far back as 2016 (1 minute search).

A general attitude of "others will answer everything in life" will not just be detrimental to his experience here, but to his life in general. Now if he were 14 years or younger I may understand to a degree.

Shock absorbing risers really don't do much, if anything at all. The compression from tightening them down between trucks and deck kinda undoes the rebound ability of the material.
Hubs especially low end hubs are not known for super smooth ride quality. 
Great for low profile builds on places with decent roads.
But its a well known down side of hubs.
With the exception of hummie hubs. Hear they are smooth.

They need to be built for it.
That's why when you see lots of pre-built Hub motor boards you'll notice there's two enclosures on the deck, one on each end.
They're keeping the battery away from the most flexible part of the deck.

I don't know if this is the answer you are looking for :slight_smile:


But I'm pretty sure (By looking at the picture) That the red/black wires connected between them give the power from the left (master) ESC to the right (Slave) ESC.
And the five black wires let the Master ESC control the Slave ESC

Building a 4wd isn't hard it's just cost alot of money to build a good one.

No, you can't since the firmware is locked. The master and slave behavior is pre-programmed /no way for a customer to change it. 

That means you can't buy the single equivalents of these escs and turn them into 4wd. Also means that if one esc dies, you are out of luck/no replacement.

@telnoi is right about those ESCs. They are locked down. 

Performance wise, the 2.1 version of the sensorless FOC capable escs are pretty good. If hadn’t worked on a buddies board that had them and watched him ride the board harder and faster than anyone else short of Moestooge, I would not believe it. 

they pulled enough amps to melt an xt60 connector plug straight out of its jacket. It still lived on. Ultimately, I broke off an SMD component trying remove the melted goo that dripped near the main ICU. I killed it by accident.. trying to help. 

Seems like vibrations are still an issue for you. Try a flexible deck or buy a satillite version (non-hub) and do pneumatic tires. As warned above, 4wd pneumo setups get expensive real fast. 

As far as the wiring connections between controllers, if you can get 1 remote to pair to two or more ESCs, you can skip the canbus or wired connection. How to do this? There is a pairing procedure for these ESCs. you will have to search for this, possibly through the vendors documentation.

Are these 2.1 though? The versions I am familiar with output 50a max/25a per motor. That's just 100a for a 4wd. That includes the double stacked version with alu heatsink. 

My dual focbox outputs 120A, so in itself 100 is not bad, but for a 4wd a total waste.

I worked with the double stacked ones in 2wd satillite config. The xt60 anecdote still doesn’t make sense to me. Yeah, same amp limits to mention. 

The OPs do not look like the 2.1s. 

True about 4wd and those settings.  Thought I should chime in bc, I too can’t be convinced off 4wd. I like it and efficiency isn’t  a problem or concern for me. Some men just want to ride stupid boards 🤷‍♂️.

[quote="Halbj613, post:147, topic:82417"]
is it worth getting 2 used flipsky vesc
[/quote]

Matter of opinion.  For me.... absolutely not. 
I did my first build with focboxes. Because after doing even the smallest amount of research i learned that they are very reliable and don't limit my build drastically. 

For a cheap board sure i guess.  

But for just a bit more you can get better.

I think you can build a decent 2wd for nearly same price as budget 4wd and have better performance. (And then later when you have more $$ , you can go 4wd)

So, you got calculus in school right?
What's your budget. 
How much would 2x dual flipsky cost (or 1x, if you want 2wd) and can you even afford them (for your info, only the dual 6.6 makes sense and will provide the least amount of issues, both in 2wd and 4wd configuration).

"is it worth it" is only something you can answer yourself. No idea if you are busting your balls delivering news papers or if you're a rich kid.

So I see you did zero research. The unity just came out recently, they're still on the second batch. Plus there's a whole thread about wanted items and for sale items. Or maybe you can't find the search? It's the weird looking Q at the top of the screen that looks kinda like a magnifying glass. 

You're going to get a lot of resentment from this DIY community by not doing it yourself.

This is a very helpful community as long as you can help yourself even a tiny bit.

Most people on here avoid threads like this like the plague.
So unless one of the five people that are trying to help you by telling you to start doing research and searching have the item for sale that you want.  you're not going to find it posting about it in here.
I'm pretty sure there's more than a few flipsky for sale at the moment. 
There's a whole website with a lot of features and a lot of things to help you.
Use it.
Members here regularly like to hook each other up because we're part of the community.
You seriously need to take the advice you've been told to do at least a dozen times in this thread by pretty much every single person who's posted in it.
Search.... just fucking use search.

Because I guarantee you if you spend your money on a vesc,  you're going to have no idea what to do with it. it's not Plug and Play like your shity diyeboard esc. 
Search, read, learn. Stop being a spoiled kid

Try slowcharging the battery. 0,15 A overnight. It might get some of the cells back to life. 

Deck and wiring are probably still fine. You might have to get new bearings though, and I'd def retighten all nuts and add new thread locker. 

Did you catch any fault codes before board turned into flames? 

Report back tomorrow.

For a dual you don't need canbus though, easier to setup without. You'd miss out on things like traction control. Split ppm for your receiver.

It was all on topic. 
Nutritional value was a metaphor for the amp draw required to reach the max watt of your hub motors at a particular voltage.

White balance referred to getting a pack that can meet those requirements with a margin as to not surpass its limits. By deduction, you can figure out if those Chinese packs are sufficient to reach max. performance.

It's not nothing. It's a starting point for your journey. The next step **needs** to be researching your planned upgrades and not just asking everyone to review things you're considering buying. Lipos, escs, remotes, etc have all been discussed to death here and you're obviously getting negative flack for asking asked questions. We're a shitty bunch here but we can be helpful sometimes :man_shrugging:

I don't get it. 

I never understood in the first place why you wanted to upgrade if you were happy with your board.

No one ever told you it's "nothing". Maybe a diyeboard isn't considered a beast among the beasts that are built here, but you're definitely not the only one here building with those parts, and if you're happy with your ride, everyone's happy for you.

My advice is keep riding your board until it fails or until you have outgrown it. 

There's no guarantee of non-failure no matter what parts you use. 

Vibration is real, especially with hub motors, but as was mentioned before, a lot of things contribute to this phenomenon.. Upgrading your battery and escs are definitely not going to help you here :grin:

Don't start spending and upgrading now. Letting time pass is often a good thing. You'll have plenty time for researching and riding.

I agree with the others. Finish this thing, despite it being a somewhat inefficient build when looking at the performance. 

If we go by the specs known to us, the esc will require a battery pack that delivers 100a total max. Each esc outputs 50a for two motors (25 per motor). That means most if not all Chinese 10s3p packs will be out, most likely also the 10s5p depending on the cells used.

Your esc is presoldered to be anything from 8 to 10 or 12s. Before you proceed, you have to figure out what you bought.

another thing to consider,,,,,,

a few months ago - roughly - or say a year ago, only a handful of ppl on this forum had built / were riding 4wd boards. It was considered extreme, not necessarily in a good way. There were serious discussions about the point of building 4wd boards because of efficiency, having unnecessary amounts of power aso. Definitely not for everyone. And those considering getting 4wd's were /often/ built on the heavier side of the scale and/or were riding in demanding (very hilly) areas. 

For most people, a dual 6374 was considered a beast with crazy performance. 

You're 14. And maybe you're 350 lbs and live in downtown SF, what do I know?

I'm just leaving this here and slowly walking away.

You're not going to get notice an acceleration difference between the 2 unless you're accelerating up a steep incline. I highly recommend sticking to dual drive. You will have plenty of power, more money to invest in better parts, and always have the ability to upgrade in the future (though I doubt you will at your weight)

As you should. Think of it this way. Do you see 4wd race cars going down a drag strip? No, you see 2wd. You see 4wd cars offroading in bad terrain. 4wd isn't going to give you an acceleration boost. It'll drain your battery and get you through the woods.

I may be confused about what you are trying to achieve now. This post is super long and extremely convoluted.
But here are my suggestions.

.

1. Go with Two wheel drive. There is nothing you will be doing that requires four wheel drive.
[quote="Halbj613, post:301, topic:82417"]
also 4wd just sounds much cooler
[/quote]
4wd sounds like more Money. More Work. And more cheap pieces that can Break, Fail, Lock Up, or Burn Down.
That is NOT "more cool".

[quote="Halbj613, post:301, topic:82417"]
still i do some off road stuff as live right next to a woods which i use as a shortcut
[/quote]
Forgive me if I am wrong, but with HuB WhEeLs?? :face_with_raised_eyebrow: 
You are going to need 8wd if you want to use those hubs 'offroad'
If offroad is your game, you have gone down the wrong path long ago. Please do not consider offroading.
Hubs are for roads. You cannot gear them up/down for different terrain, and winding motors is something you likely have not even heard of. Plus you will strain your bottom-of-the-barrel parts and probably break or burn something out.
NO. Offroading.

.

2. Everyone has said this, and I will say this again... 
QUALITY parts are something you want to build with. NOT cheap parts!! Trust me, I was there 5 years ago. Young, and with hardly any money. I ended up burning out my ESC TWICE (80 bucks each time) because I didn't buy the $120 (at the time) VESC. I spent at least $40 more then I had to because of my low budget. **Not only did I spend more then I had to, but I didn't have access to fancy VESC settings, and I LOST ride time because I could not ride my board when the ESC was burned out!**
Plus, cheap parts give an experience that is not underwelming, but certainly less fun as quality parts. Why go 20mph with terrible parts that fail often when you could go 30 with parts you do not have to deal with problems with?

Do NOT buy cheap.
However, if you want to read about a cheap build, follow my very CLEAR and CONCISE and extremely informative 24-step-long Instructables.  It has everything from a detailed parts list, to step-by-step pictures, to 2D/3D files you can print out and trace over.
You easily learn about motor Kv.
About Lipo batteries and outputs
And how voltage works in Series and Parallel. 
Plus plenty of terminology that will help you read forums such as eSk8 (and others) as well as motor and battery specs.
**(But use it as a guide. Get bigger, lower kv motor, and a VESC)**
https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Electric-Longboard/

.

3. So far I have seen **NO VISION** from you at all. Aside from wanting to "Offroad" in your forest.
**ALL builds MUST start with a vision**. Whether that is a max speed **(Speed)**, a grade you want to over come **(torque)**, or the minimal distance you are shooting for **(range)**
**Speed**
**Torque**
**Range**
PREFERABLY all three of those.
If you do not have any idea what speed, torque, or range you want, then you will probably also not be factoring in variables such as
Your **weight** (and weight of a backpack, briefcase, or whatever else you might be taking on your rides)
**The grades** (steepness) you must over come where you live
**How far you must go** to get to where you will usually be going (work, school, ect)
**How quick** you want to get there.
**Weather**
**Terrain**
And many more. Everything that affects you on your ride you must plan to overcome! 
That is how a VISION starts.

You then take that vision, you look at what speed range and torque you might want, and base your build off that. Generally **(Speed = cell count/gearing. Torque = Motor kv/gearing/Battery discharge. Range = Batteries/wheel size)**
Of course everything intertwines somehow, but that is your basics.

**If you don't know what you want to do with your board, you likely will not build it to do what you want it to do, and will have no idea what you want to achieve!!**
A dream without vision is just that. A dream.

.

4. You have shown multiple times that you have done hardly any research.
**In 19 days you have done 8 hours of reading on this forum**
8 hours sounds like a lot, but infact it is hardly anything.
I have been stalking the e-board community for a while (about 5 years, not straight)
I like to think I know a fair bit about e-boards!
I only JUST joined this forum **8 days** ago. I already have **19 hours**, read **217 seperate topics**, and have read **5.7k posts**! That is more then double your reading time, more then double your topic reads, and more then 5x your post reads.
**And I have been watching this community for at least 4 years!**
Of course I am just a tiny miniscule fish in the ocean. Many of the guys who are trying to help you in this very topic have double my years of e-board community time. 50x my hands on experience, and so much reading time that they could have, well, I dont know. Taken a world-wide vacation in that time? :joy:
Anyway. My point.  
There is ALWAYS something to learn. When you start out, yes, questions are good. There are amazingly knowledgeable people here that are super willing to help. But it's always best you read and watch and get a good understanding beforehand so you can come to them with meaningful and well-thought-out questions.
I would be personally embarrassed if I had to ask what kv was. I would rather learn what it was and how it would affect my board, BEFORE coming and asking for real-world experience with that motor/kv from someone.
Don't waste your time, dont hog their time. Do your research **so you can keep your questions short** (so you can get to more research) **so they can keep their answers reasonable lengths** (so they can go on to do more building, and helping others who may have questions) Everyone saves time. And you look smarter and more like someone who may contribute to OTHERS in the community in the future.
 
.

5. After reading this entire topic, I am ready to give you my ULTIMATE advice.
**Drop the idea of building a board for now**
You clearly have not done enough research. **You will hardly know how the different parts you are working with will WORK.** That is dangerous and expensive and just opening a huge can of worms.
How much longboard/skateboard/snowboard/mountainboard history do you have again?
I highly recommend **buying a pre-built, or commercial board**. Even just for cheap. It will save you time and money, and you instantly get a board that works.
I appreciate you trying to figure things out, but it just doesn't seem to be working for you with this budget and your current knowledge :slight_smile:

**Give people here your attention and high consideration.**
I have seen multiple 'big dogs' give you TONS of advice. Much of which you seem to not want to take.
**They know what they are talking about.**
**They are NOT here to see you fail.**
**You can trust them and what they have to say** :slight_smile:
They may all be complete strangers that you will never-ever-ever see ever. But it is safe to say that their suggestions will be the right way to go. They know your money, time, and safety is at stake. Give them advise your highest consideration and listen to what they have to say. In return you will save money, time, and likely be more safe with your e-board adventures :slight_smile:

And hey

I spent probably an hour writing this whole thing (and bolding it and structuring it and such)
Make my time (and their time) worth it, and heed the good advice these lovely people have to offer. It's the least you can do! :slight_smile:

[quote="Halbj613, post:308, topic:82417"]
nice speed with a nice range
[/quote]

Nice isn't a a measurement of speed or distance.  Lol

But really what does that mean to you?
To me nice speed is mid 30s with the ability to go faster. 
Then again there's alot of people on here who would say 25 is plenty. 

Same thing for range.
I have a 10mile range board i really like.  But wanna build a 30+ mile range board as well. Both are "nice".

How far do you honestly see yourself ever riding? 
Big batteries are great for long rides but they're a pain to carry around if needed.

Most likely junk batteries for 2 reasons:

- they don't tell you what cells. If they were quality cells, they'd be gloating about it by name (samsung 30q 18650 cells are the current "standard" here for ion packs

- real samsung 30qs are 3 ah per cell. The 1p pack listed is 2500 mah I.e. 2.5 ah.

@hyperIon1 and @hyperIon2 sell quality batteries made from really good Samsung 30q cells at a solid price. Check out [their website](https://hyper-ion-systems.myshopify.com) or shoot them a private message on the forum. I have bought 2 packs from them now and plan on buying again in the future.

read couple of posts about the batteries
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-terminology-formulae-and-physical-assembly-of-lipo-batteries-or-wtf-does-c-mean/33162

i think i will go for a 10s3p which if they use samsung 30q batteries should (i think) have a 9ah maximum and 37 volts 
how do i find out c rating though so that i can find out the amps looked for thread about it but couldnt find any

please say if these calculations are right and if this would be sufficient for a 2wd hub driven board i will probably use either a flipsky or focbox dual vesc and already have motors

U think? I guess ur not sure what u want to do. They’re typically viewed as capable of 20 amp discharge and ion cells mostly don’t use a c rating.  So with 3 in parallel u should be good for 60 amps, but typically people do 4p for a rating of 80 amps so then less voltage sag under load and the cells will also stay cooler and last longer.

Honestly dude, it seems like you have a small budget and you want to build another board, when you already have a board to ride. If I were you, I would keep your current board, but:
1. Ditch the diyeboard escs and buy a flipsky dual 4.20 vesc
2. Purchase a 10s4p 30q battery from a reliable battery builder on the forum
3. Use a mini remote (trigger style)
4. Bigben enclosure (cause your in the UK)
5. sell those hub motors for like $50 or just hold onto them
```

problem is that after doing all that may as well keep that and do that to a half assembled board which is already nearly set up just needs vesc and battery

That makes sense, but the problem is you have minimal knownledge about building electric skateboards, and so if you do as you say, you will have two incomplete boards and no money left. Focus on ONE BOARD at a time, and if you have left over parts, then use them for a future build or sell them to fund future projects.

Ok I'm out. You have started a thread where you ask basic questions and there are 400 replies. Some of them are people telling you to search, but alot of the replies are people trying to help you. There are many people here including me who have tried to help you, and you insist on going to complete other way. Do what you want, but stop asking other people what to do then because to me it seems like you have a hard time retaining knownledge or you are just a jackass waisting everybody's time. And also, I'm 16 so stop playing the little kid card

You can.  Just figure out 100% what you want. (Out of your board)
Then figure out how to make that happen. 
But more importantly understand how these parts work and go together.
Otherwise you may break parts before they ever see the road

Doesn't seem like it.

If you've done any research you will realize that the people in this thread have been trying to steer you in the right direction. But you call them useless and ignore them and then ask the same question.

There are alot of amazing people on this forum, alot have tired to help you but you ignore it just because they haven't given you the answer you want. No one is going to tell you you are making the right choice here, because you aren't.

But go ahead, ignore the people who have the knowledge, and who have created the threads and tutorials you SHOULD be searching and reading.

OP, your perseverance, in the face of regular member sarcasm/“read the rules!”/emotion gifs is impressive. That some people are still responding with helpful comments, should inform your (and our) willingness to answer a new guy’s question in the future when you know the answers. 

At one point, I gave up and had Longhairedboy fix my poor electronic decisions instead of brave the forums.

Oh geez this thread. Someone said C is charge rate, that's not true. C stands for Capacity. A 20C battery is shorthand for a battery that can discharge at 20 * Capacity. So if the pack has a capacity of 5Ah, that's 20 * 5 = 100A discharge rate. The standard safe charge rate for most batteries is 1C, but you can generally go as high as 2C without a special pack. Some packs might be rated at a higher charge rate but I wouldn't risk sacrificing battery life for slightly faster charging.

The C rating for a battery will be listed on the website (or perhaps in a datasheet) when you're buying it, since it's a critically important piece of information. To determine the required C rate, work out how many amps you're going to push through your motors. That's partly determined by the current rating of the motors and partly by the current rating of the ESCs.

I've done my bit, I'm out.

Kinda like he is flat lining on an emotional level due to Xanax or something.

Ignores all criticism. 
Thinks everybody else is to blame. 
Screams fake esk8 advice when it does not suit him. 

I just realized something. Trumpism is starting to affect the youth in the UK. Brexit damages brain cells.

wow.. didn't seem to be on the slow side that board!! What's it like having both wheels driven by the same motor though? There's been a lot of speculations and theories on why this wouldn't be very rideable, ie it would interfere with turning as it wouldn't allow the wheels to roll at different speeds aso.. What's you experience?
