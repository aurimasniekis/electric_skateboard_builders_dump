Hello everybody, i am new to this forum, but have been lurking for a while.

I've decided to get myself an electric loangboard of some sort.

Now i have spent quiet a while reading around on the interwebs, trying to find what is up and down
in this interesting form of transportation and fun.

And i have come to the decision to diy a board, but must admit i need some assistance with this.


My needs/specifications is as follow:

 1) I want a good range since i want to use the board for commuting and a bit of joy riding.
Will be riding between 5-20 km per trip, and usually got somewhere to charge the board in the mean time, should the need arise. The roads got lots of small and medium sized hills, and lots of starts and stops. 

2) The place i live is fairly cold, wet and rainy most of the year.

3) I am pretty tall and heavy, just above 100 kg / 220 lbs. This is without all the shit i usually haul around with me. so more like 115 kg / 250 lbs.

4) Speed isn't of the essence, but somewhere around 40 kmh / 25 mph would be nice.

5) Will mostly be driving on asphalt/pavement but might occasionally hit patches of gravel.


Some questions regarding my specific needs/wants have arisen that i have quiet a hard time find satisfying answers for:

 Due to the weather conditions, is it even possible to drive around all year/most of the year?

Is my weight a big issue?

Is it possible to make a setup that is mostly "street/cruiser" and less mountain board? (Got experience riding ordinary longboards, but not offroad).


I am thinking about making a dual motor (was thinking 6374's, haven't decided on the brand), beltdriven setup. 
Do i need two ESC's or one that can run dual setups? In either case, any recommandations?  

My understanding is that the batteries got a lot to say about the speed and range, so i was thinking about big ol' pack of 10S's of some sort. 


Any help will be much appreciated, and in advance, thank you all!

Best regards, RobinRubin

You can make a street setup which is exactly what my build is.  
I live in London so also half the year raining    
Once you have decided that you like your setup you can bung up all the holes and with a professionally built enclosure waterproof it

Wheel might be a problem as urethane is really slippery when wet and you get a lot of slipping

Your weight is fine and many riders are of that weight

Dual 6374s will get you way faster then 25mph with tons off torque to pull even a heavier guy up a steep hill

You can use a dual vesc or 2 singles.         
  If you are planning on using singles search up split ppm vs can us and you will learn about that.  
 
Some recommendations are:
(Dual) Focbox unity (if you are willing to wait for one to come or you could buy on forum) it’s not a standard vesc as it uses a different vesc tool but recently has proven to be a decent esc.  

TRAMPA vesc expensive but the original and are completely bulletproof

Flipsky/maytech 6.6/4.12 the 6.6 is cheaper then a TRAMPA and is good for a high powered build and is a pretty solid vesc while the 4.12 are good for a small low powered commuter build

With the vesc it is really up to you about what battery you use and how much you are willing to spend on your own guarantee of safety

Regarding battery 10s4p - 10s5p should be fine using Samsung’s 30q cells based on areas we can recommend a builder

....

Sorry for making this so long winded but hope it helps

Lastly if you want some more better info go to esk8 news forum
Which is the newer community run forum

Hope this helps a lot

No need to apology for the long reply, it is much appreciated!

So if the 6374's are overkill, what would be better suited for my needs? Only sat my eyes on the 6374's because of the hugh amount of power.

And spending wise, i would rather spend what is needed to get a board (that theoretically) could last me a long time and be reliable (I might change my mind on this later on, but i have no illusions about this is gonna be cheap).

The performance of 6374 vs 6355 at say 200kv are quite similar. What's different is heat dissipation. I believe all the big guys who ride hard struggle a bit with heat, in the motors and the escs. I think you're okay looking at 2x6374.

If you intend to ride in wet, consider pneumatic wheels for improved traction. Waterproofing a board is a long and difficult path, probably with many failures.

You probably want to start your pack research at about 60 cells (10s6p or 12s5p). A very rough starting estimate is 20wh/mile. 

You can probably budget around $1500 +- 500 (big variance because of wet conditions).

What @Halbj613 said is a good starting point.

I think 20wh/mile is quite a high consumption rate also don’t larger motors produce more torque

Plus @RobinRubin within riding that board for a month you will want higher speed and power so if you start out jog you won’t have to change later on

Yeah just was thinking in km and got confused either way a 10s5p with 30q is    
15ah x 42v = 450wh which means 22km from that battery you don’t need to go 12s to get that range

Now i have been looking around a bit for an ESC, which i assume is one of the most, if not the most important part. 
The FocBox Unity seems very nice, but would it be worth it for a dual motor setup, over dual Flipsky FSESC 4.12's or dual FSESC 6.6? 

And for either of these setups, would it be possible to make more than one speed setting? Or does that depend on the controller/remote? (As in lets say, first lvl 15km/h, second lvl 20 km/h. third lvl unlimited/max km/h?)
```

The speed settings you could do via a phone if you have a metr module
Search up what a metr is if you need

A flipsky 4.12 is good if you are on a strict budget but it isn’t the top quality stuff. It would work for a,low power small build but not for anything above that

A 6.6 is already getting into the same category as a focbox unity and is a pretty solid vesc 

For a first build I wouldn’t go dual esc such as a unity as when you screw something up both will go not one

You can get 2 single flipsky 6.6 or original focboxes which can be connected via split ppm or cnabus

What is the disadvantage of using a dual ESC? I thought it would be "easier" for a first time builder like me, since it is all in one package. 

If i end up buying two ESC's, i think i will try the PPM split.
But is that possible with the 4.12's?

Else https://flipsky.net/products/fs-esc-6-6 these two could also be fine (and waterproof, atleast they claim they are)

Generally skateboard escs have a high failure rate. If I were you I'd try to get a Unity. Good quality and very easy for beginners. Just be careful about buying direct from Enertion -- they've been plagued with delays.

If going flipsky or other 2nd tier brands, I'd not buy a dual (if one side fails you replace the whole thing). Especially being a big guy, which demands more power.

Tampa vesc are very expensive but are worth the investment as rather then buying a unity which will probably break in a year or two these are solid and pretty much you never have to touch them

If you are willing to spend the money 100% worth buying them even a used pair

If you're saying Unities are likely to break in a year or two, that's not what I'm seeing at all. You'll need to back up statements like this with facts.

Yeah they are getting better but still no where near as solid as a trampa

These statements have nothing to do with the point I objected to, which is your assertions that all Unities fail within one to two years. You're broadcasting this information to the internet, and it's bogus.

The unities locking brakes, there were maybe 2-3 cases total, that were not attributable to something else. They had the full throttle issue but that was a firmware bug that was quickly fixed. Horrible things, but very different from every Unity breaking in 1-2 years.

K your right maybe that statement was incorrect

Rephrasing now: there are a number of unities which have failed and often even caused major harm to their riders which has never happened with trampa vesc

I am about the same weight as you. Used 5 x 2s1p 8000mah lipo batteries. 
I wanted max range and thought the extra weight wouldn't be too annoying. 

I was wrong, the weight is super annoying when trying to lug around a longboard on a train. In hindsight, the battery I put in was much bigger than I realistically needed.

How much did it weigh? And what range did you get? Part of the idea, would be to not take the train. Used to bike or take a regular longboard, but the damn bikes keep getting stolen, and the board aint viable ifi a min a hurry or its far.

All up my build is 10.5kg. My odd motor mounting and the length of the deck I used also made it slightly cumbersome on a train.

I have taken it on a 10km round trip with an indicated 82% battery remaining (started full). That was relatively flat and flowing. 
I have started on my way up an extremely inclined hill with an indicated 65% battery. The hill start + the hill killed the board in less than 200m.

So i'll have to backslide a bit on my idea of a no budget build, and need to change the plan for a budget build... 

Either buying cheaper parts or go for a single motor setup, if it is possible with the goals i had for the build.

Am considering buying dual Flipsky 4.12 ESC's a couple of 6354 190KV 8mm shaft motors and either 8s or 10s batteries. Would this at all be adviceable?

Alright, so now i have started ordering stuff. 

- 2 x FSESC 6.6 in alu cases
- 1 x VX1 remote
- Assorted cables and connectors

I have ordered some plywood for a deck too, and gonna attempt to DIY it, which will be interesting.

Now comes the trucks and stuff. I am looking at Caliber II 50 trucks, 12 mm belts and orangatang caguama wheels. Are the trucks wide enough for that? And suppose it will be a very tight fit with 6374's, so maybe 6355's?
