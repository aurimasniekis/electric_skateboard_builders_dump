If you have seen my [other rolling fortress build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/rolling-fortress-lacroix-prototipo-dual-focbox-6374-diy-mbs-geared-drive-12s4p/59021) and feel a sense of d√©j√† vu, don't worry it's because I decided to build a mini version of my LaCroix. The LaCroix is a great ride, but it's also very heavy and very bulky. I'll still use it for longer runs but for shorter ones I contemplated for months to build a mini AT board. I also happened to have some parts lying around which I have been tinkering in my head on how best to re-use them.

Just to give some context, this is not meant to be a long distance/mountain conquering board, it's just meant to give me a comfortable ride to the grocery store or on small errands. Light enough to lug up and down stairs but tall enough to go over cracks and bumps. I also typically don't ride very fast (speed limit is 25km/h in my country, some places 10km/h), so I'm fine with the durability issues associated with 3D printed parts.

Anyway back to the build. Specs of the Mini Rolling Fortress/Poor Man's LaCroix are as follows:

![DSC00478|690x460](upload://1ApyZBI9XKHT9GgW1I2LGb5lS6p.jpeg) 

Here are more details about the build:

**The Deck**
This is not the first time I've used this deck as an esk8 platform (you'll notice older holes in the deck), the previous iteration of this was not fantastic, I didn't have risers set to the proper angle, wheels were too small so the enclosure would get scraped, waterproofing was bad, etc etc etc... So I left the deck alone for a while with the intention of re-purposing it in future. Anyway, I decided to give this deck a new life but I had to modify it to be able to accomodate the wheel bite of the 6x2 tires.

![IMG20180902120012|281x500](upload://a87GoSztYolNng8B3R1YiFqXSkS.jpeg) 
I drilled extra holes at the tails, mounted the trucks with custom risers (see below), tilted the board, worked out how much I needed to remove and then jigsawed away.

![20degRiser|690x383](upload://jGjAr3uupDq68FKOxMYGhS1XZ7C.jpeg) 
I designed and printed a 20deg riser to correct the angle of the truck, this also meant that the ride was a little higher than I had hoped even though I mounted the truck as far off to the tips as possible. This is currently still in PLA+ awaiting a better material.

![IMG20180902122759|690x388](upload://AjQm4z6W6UYu705R7ljZAJtlWUp.jpeg) 
The end result looked almost like a mountain board, and the board even flexes quite nicely. The original wheel wells also create a nice feedback for feet placement and the truck placement and cutouts ensures there is no chance of wheel or shoe bite.

**The Drive**
I had a pair of Torqueboards 50mm motor mounts left over for when I upgraded another deck to geared drives. Because geared drives require shorter motor mounts, i did some measurements and was pleasantly surprised that this can be repurposed for my Mini LaCroix. Other than that the drive is put together very similarly to all my other drives.

![IMG20180909112843|690x388](upload://2TWmBjD7ej8n8fpmQZQO1OWofjO.jpeg) 
This would consist of the wheel/hub, an adapter to the hub, a 67T gear bolted to the adapter, and a 6806 bearing with an adapter to fit it around the 218mm truck.

![IMG20180909113359|281x500](upload://3z98OS5JxmOt1jD8cZGkvm1d2a9.jpeg) 
These are currently printed in PLA2.0 (or PLA+) but I'm getting them printed in HP Fusion Nylon PA12 for added durability.

![IMG20180912215630|690x388](upload://hchEHZcoNiGPjEuVl3SRGTBxsVq.jpeg) 
A casing to reduce debris getting gummed up in the gears goes over the entire assembly, seen here is a 20T pinion but I have since dropped this to a 15T.

![IMG20180906170700|281x500](upload://7ojNUQVypJEvdoluAAJtbOp8QVO.jpeg) 
One point to note about the 6x2 wheels, I did not like the bearings that came with them. Some were a little rusty and they rolled terribly. I hammered out the stock bearing and tried to replace them with a better SKF one, however when I hammered the bearings back in, I realised the hubs were so tight that bearings would not roll properly. So I ground the bearing seat just enough so that the bearings were now push fit as opposed to hammer fit. This seemed to work for me but I am not 100% sure if I introduced imbalance in the hub as a result. I did have to check every wheel and added the necessary weights to try to balance the hubs as best as I could.

![IMG20180901075654|690x388](upload://aq0bLna5fIvU5qmhD3DDDdcLmZL.jpg) 
Despite free-rolling on the bench pretty effortlessly, these wheels are absolutely impossible to manual skate with. The rolling resistance is insanely bad, one kick gives me only a few meters even on smooth concrete. I would assume this would also translate to losses in efficiency once I go electric.

**The Electronics**
I can't comment about the reliability of the Flipsky Dual FSEC4.20 yet as I haven't ridden this enough, but these make it so much easier and more compact to run dual setups!!!! 

![IMG20180916015829|690x388](upload://p9W5JCs2w49PGn4ShX0KMcxG97.jpeg)  
One less set of power leads, no CANBUS wire, inbuilt heatsink, it's just awesome... Seen here next to my 10S2P cells. Why only 10S2P (seen here with 16A charge only IP67 rated BMS)? This is meant to be a mini, didn't need anything more than 20km range nor was I going mountain climbing.

**The Enclosure**
To be honest, enclosures for me are the hardest thing to get right. This is my 5th ot 6th DIY enclosure and I decided to go with a segmented 3D printed (PETG for its hydrophobic nature) version to accommodate for some flex in the deck.
![Enclosure|690x383](upload://vbbTMhFmiOuBl4iu0iZe07rN68E.jpeg)  
The enclosure segments had lips which were then attached to each other using silicone (again for flex). Holes in the side were meant for the anti-spark switch and charge port. No voltage display needed because I run my remote with telemetry.

![IMG20180915171955|281x500](upload://v4HvSrDijU6bqrnPJAtCfTJPGMK.jpeg) 
I even went to spread a layer of silicone on the inside of the enclosure as a safety precaution. Connectors allow me to completely remove the enclosure, leaving the electronics on the underbelly of the deck (attached by industrial strength velcro).

![IMG20180912190344|690x388](upload://4tJtB2WclXvIYh3bvE0HCWQ4CrN.jpeg) 
A natural rubber (oh my god the smell....) gasket sits between the enclosure and deck. M4 bolts then hold the enclosure down via inserts in the deck.

**The Ride**
Unfortunately I haven't had the change to give it a good ride yet, but I'll update more once I do. For now it rides a little taller than I had hoped but the flex + pneumatic tires provide for a comfortable ride. The concave of the deck provides for a nice platform to perform much tighter turns than my LaCroix (also slightly shorter wheelbase).

Again, I'll update more soon.

To finish, here's a look at the two rolling fortresses next to each other...
![IMG20180901075602|281x500](upload://htbvfCMu0ZouPCakhdKyd90T7vP.jpeg) 

Now to wait for good weather and fast asleep babies to know more about how this performs.

So I did a quick, but very wet, 10km ride. Here's my findings thus far.

The Good:
* Goes over cobble stone, twigs, puddles, leaves just fine
* Noise from geared drive is acceptable and didn't alarm any pedestrians, in fact it served as a good indicator of my presence
* Turning radius is much smaller than the LaCroix

The Bad:
* One of my tires was completely deflated, not sure if it's leaking because I managed to pump it back up. Others retained their pressure just fine.
* Rolling resistance is bad... It's almost as if the brakes engage as I go downhill. Seemed to be requiring 6 to 8A just go keep it at cruising speed (15km/h)
* Range as a result is much reduced, current estimate puts it at a pathetic 15km only. Will need to test again after making sure tire isn't leaking
* Wheel position throws water all over my legs and deck, I rode the LaCroix last night in similar wet conditions and was surprised how clean it came out
* Antispark switch got stuck due to the muck, had to knock it loose

Will update more soon...

I think it‚Äôs a good board overall. Do you think the rolling resistance is high due to wider contact patch of the tyre. I ve had very good experience and minimal wear with standard evolve tires I wonder if they can be installed on those rims

Talking about these ones and they also come in black color

Not sure honestly... But it's something someone else in the forum realised... He swapped to these and immediately lost like 20-30% range...

I forgot what he was comparing it to though...

I don't think the evolves will fit. They fit a 7" hub I think..

Great build and inspirational for me as i'm currently planning a mini mountainboard for my 10 yo.  Don't mean to preach to the converted but have you correctly meshed your gears? Over tight gear mesh will cause drag and can blow the vesc.

Great that you can have some reference to build yours for you kid. Will be an awesome project! Also the smaller skateboard decks will fit their tinier feet better than a regular mountain board.

Good advice about the meshing. My gears have some backlash provided for, definitely not too tightly meshed. This is my 4th DIY geared drive (everything from single drive 90mms to dual drive 8") so it's definitely not the gears. 

Also the noise when they are improperly meshed especially when too tightly is very loud, you will know it immediately.

Anyone knows if I change from 15/67 to 20/67 will I be drawing less amps at the same speed? 

I know I will get a higher top speed but I am not interested in that, I also know I will get less torque but with dual drives I think I should be fine. I just want to know if I get more efficiency at low to moderate speeds.

Okay so I made it 20km exactly and my board cut out at the set 30V.... Average speed was 17-18kmh. Max I think I only dared to go 23 or 24kmh. Last few kms I was going super slow to try to get back home. But alas I had to do the walk of shame. Luckily the board trollies very well.

I noticed with the tube replaced the amp draw was more acceptable, 4-5v for maintaining cruise.

All in all... I am quite pleased. Range is just enough for my usual routes and I can get a wee bit more by dropping the cut off voltage down to 28V..

I figured out how to counter the errors, it's by using sensors or using FOC. The VESC's can't handle those over current faults so if you just increase the efficiency it will work flawlessly. I have been on a 50km test and it's working fine on hybrid for now. I plan on using FOC when I get my Hummie deck.

I run it 10s like they recommend me to do.
I could run them fine if I'm cruising cool and not stressing the trigger ... but there is not fun or power :persevere:

first of all, love your work.  Great design concept with the gear drive using 3D printed parts.

I really hope you can share the files when you have completed the testing!

Just wondering what the minimum distance from the centre of the truck to the centre of the motor mount is to see what other motor mounts would work with your design?  Such as the well priced @dickyho mounts.

I assume as the mounts are quite short they wouldn't work pointing out the back to the board?

I wish I was as good at designing as you.  Hopefully over time I can learn these programs a bit better.

Hi there, unfortunately I am not in town so I can't measure it.

I actually wanted the mounts to point inwards in this case to keep them out of sight. I think it might be possible to point backwards but I am not 100% sure.

Hi Mate,

no worries.  Are you able to give it a measure when you are back.  Just want to see if the cheaper mounts could work.

I can understand why you wanted them to point inward as it does keep them out of site.  I'll have to do some of my own testing once I have the measurements to see if they will work outward as it gives a bit more room for batteries and if possible get the motors a bit further away from the ground.

amazing design work on all of it.

It's a tricky balance, if your motor is mounted further from the axle you will need a much bigger gear which changes your gearing ratio but also makes it closer to the ground too.

Only thing is the 20km range is a real bummer... Must plan my routes carefully...

Upgraded to some sexy AF Bergmeister wheels from Haggy... Designed and printed a new adapter for the hubs and used back the rest of the old drive... 

Will need more time to evaluate the difference but so far it seems to have less rolling resistance... 

The wheels themselves are super nicely made, bearing sits perfectly in, super nice finish and did I mention they come in red???

They are a bit smaller than the AliExpress 6x2 wheels though... About 160mm vs 145mm... This means I might not get enough clearance off the ground for the old drive... Next plan is to redo one for Haggy trucks instead...

Took it out for a quick joy ride and some photos... Overall I am very happy with the new wheels. 

I think I gained a few more km on my range because of the lower rolling resistance too!

I am estimating an increase of about 20% range just by swapping to the Haggy penumies... I attribute this to lower rolling resistance both as a result of the smaller contact patch and better bearings...

Very happy I decided to bite the bullet on these wheels...

Since Last time, I installed the aliexpress wheels and tried to kick push it in the alley and man it does just a couple of meters free rolling and stops. I‚Äôd probably order Haggy boards tires for now and maybe the hubs when I get the cash.
You mentioned swapping the bearings was not easy, I‚Äôd probably need to find a guy with a lathe. 
Thanks for the review.

You need to either hammer out the old bearing or extract it with a bearing extracting tool.

After that you need to check if the bearing seat is too tight. For me it was so tight the new bearing seized up. If so then the best is to lathe it until the bearing can fit nicely.

Also note that the hub does not take skate bearings, the OD is different. So you can't use any fancy skate bearings.

![IMG20181215222603|281x500](upload://t0B7V3Bwh42CJFgDmslDQKDwKhf.jpeg)

Lubed up...

![IMG20181216004244|690x388](upload://rTOLTf8jn5v6RSM4UEhHVoklqFj.jpeg)

![IMG20181216012702|375x500](upload://1WSykw8DdCXuRnmGSC46ELIbgWc.jpeg) 

Swapped to shred lights instead...

![IMG20181216012716|375x500](upload://QRqg3R6f5JMbECqBXfGGACyoUT.jpeg) 

Printed a rear bumper/stand to allow it to stand upright... Super useful!

Made some minor mistakes along the way but managed to work around everything... Unfortunately the drive is super duper noisy now... Spent hours debugging it bit by bit... I think it's the left pinion gear that's giving me all that trouble... Will need to figure it out another time.. need to crash..

So I figured out what was causing the aweful noise from my drive train... It was the wheel gear, some teeth had imperfections which for some reason resulted in absolutely awful noise... 

Being desperate I used a butane torch, heated up these teeth then ran them through the pinion in hope of reshaping the teeth... It worked well enough that the noise is now acceptable!!

Now if it could stop raining...

Yeah after building a LaCroix I realised it's really not meant for city riding... Too heavy and too hard to turn sharp corners... That's why I built this actually, light enough to carry with one hand. Yet still can roll over cobble stone and cracks without fear of flying off the board... 

It's surprisingly nimble too considering it's pneumatics...

Hi. Thanks again for your Pulley model. I am definetely planning a build inspired by yours. Sick of the bad rodes and feel vibrations. I will get a blank uncut deck that I will shape it as I like it. I was wondering, I guess the deck you used is like 32-33 inch standard skateboard deck and do you know feet stand width? I would like to keep it short but the drop down removes a lot of length.
```

Get the biggest possible skateboard you can get. Unfortunately mine is still a wee bit smaller than I had hoped. 9" skateboards I think are the largest (they go by width).

Not only is the stance shorter but the area to put electronics and lipo is also rather tight... You need to optimise the space as much as possible.
```

I will get an uncut skate mould so the width can be up to 11 I think which is too much. For the electronics I want to transfer what I have under a 29 inch spud so should be feasible. 
If you will have the occasion please measure the feet stand base. Thanks for the info

Verry nice/beautiful build.

I am also in the process of building a Board with these pneumatic tires.

But I don't know which board style should I use because I have no experiences regarding the pros/cons of Drop-Through, Drop-Down and the angled Decks which you have used in your build. Would you say that it is comfy to ride your board or would you prefer a different Deck-Shape/Style?

Need to figure out which would be good/optimal for such a build.

And do you consider your angeled "risers" stable/rigid enough to ride with them?

Thanks in advance for your input. Really nice build!

Thanks for the compliment.

I have a few friends who went with a drop deck instead and it works well without the need to use the angled riser. You also can do without the need to saw off a deck, drill new holes. Etc.

My angled riser works but yes it is a point of potential concern. But then again I don't ride it hard or fast in comparison to some folks here. So for me it's fine.

At that time I was also just making use of the spare deck I had lying around so it was more of a fun build to see if it would even work. Thankfully it works quite well and is a very nice ride.
