Hi everyone,

i'm building a new board for commuting: streets, around 10 km real range, train, subway...
I already have the deck, a VX1 remote and i build a 10s2p battery pack using Sony / Murata US18650VTC5A
I don't need speed, but enough torque to move my 90kg/200lb around the city and a "as light.as possible board"
I did this list for the missing parts, what do you think ?

Round trucks are a big no-no. Get calibers or something else that will hold your mount better. Check out the other forum, there will be more people to help you.
