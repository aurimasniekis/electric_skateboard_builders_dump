Hi guys Manny here 🙋🏽‍♂️  Nervous about my first build I need this to commute to work on a daily because I have no cars and calling a uber back home from work is starting to hurt my pocket. My job is 7miles away & I live in the outskirts of my town so this will help me out soooooo much !!! If I successfully build a eboard that works if feel like it'll be a life changing thing in my life for commuting lol 
But anyways I got the vesc speed controller & 6374 190kv motor from the DIY electric skateboard website.Can you please tell me if I got everything too build a correct electric longboard I'll show the links

Whoooa that took a lot of finger pressing lol 😂 but let me know if I missed anything or any advice for me would be much appreciated

Update: Ended up buying a 3rd battery so I can run 9s 
& also bought another pulley system from DIY electric skateboard website. Because the motor pulley that I had now only has 10T I  calculate it & the speed for it was 13mph-18mph. The DIY motor pulley system has 16T with that my mph should be now 22mph-29mph. I forsure wanted more speed

Those Acid Mellon Caliber IIs look fabulous. BRB, gotta add something to my amazon cart...

I suggest you build an 18650 battery. LiPos can and have caught fire in my experience due to rough riding causing impact damage to the pouches.

The pullley you've listed is pretty standard and good. However they will  collide with the caliber II trucks. you'll need to bore them out a bit for them to fit properly.



For the price of that battery configuration you want to build (comes in around $180), you might as well buy the DIYEBOARD battery 10S5P kit for $200. It offers WAY more bang for the buck. 10S vs 6S, still has battery voltage display, 360WH (versus your current battery's 111WH), comes with BMS already wired up and a laptop styled charger, so you don't have to disassemble the board when you want to charge it.

Edit: Oh, and get this remote https://www.ebay.com/itm/Nano-2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-for-electric-longbaord-skateboard/302546264092?hash=item467129a01c:g:t18AAOSwOyZZcJDv

That remote is a death trap. Had multiple cutouts when I tried a friends one and I remember when they first started showing up on these forums a lot of people had similar complaints. Even when they work, they're still very twitchy with minimal travel in comparison. I've done 1000's of km with my GT2B and never had a cutout

In order to get 14 miles round trip you are probably looking at 10s4p or 5p depending on the battery or go 12s4p and that should get you more then 14 miles. Plus I don’t see a board on this set up

To be fair, I think I would have preferred taking his approach when I built my first board. 

I initially had a generic deck with 10S3P battery and a single 6374 motor/VESC and the original plan was to add another 6374/VESC down the track. 

After everything I learnt over the process of building my first board, I basically decided it was going to make more sense to use what I'd learnt (not just about good combinations of parts, but also tooling and component layout/design etc) and start from scratch on a new build. 

Apart from one of my original VESCs, none of the parts on my new build have been carried over from my first build, and I expect that most people that really get into this hobby are never really going to be truly happy with their first build unless they come from a background of designing/building similar things :)

Can't argue with your second sentence though :p

Can confirm, I used this pulley and had to do this. This pulley set really only makes sense if you buy direct from china and pay $15. If you're already paying $30, I'd say pay $14 more and get the one from Torqueboards. Or check out some of the ones other members are selling on this site, there's good quality ones for good prices.

I don't see what's wrong with lipos. They're great for high discharge, and they'll last for several years if you treat them right. 

@MannyM0E 6 of these https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5800mah-2s1p-30c.html
Either in 12s1p or 6s2p configuration should get you 14 miles round trip, and as long as you get a BMS, or set up some type of 1-port charging, you should be good to go. Charging them individually on the charger could take 8+ hours

I keep seeing this and its simply not true.  You can build a lipo pack with the same mAh and more amp delivery for half the cost of a liion pack, that includes a BMS so you can use a brick charger.  The downside is the charge cycles are drastically reduced, but when you calc the cost per mile it's actually pretty close to that of a liion pack.  If you need a cheap pack lipo is definitely something to consider.

Well said @mmaner 
Lipo packs are also easier to build and require less expensive equipment to build. 
Recent unfortunate events have also proven that Li-ion packs can be problematic and even dangerous due to improper construction.

I don't know why there is such a prejudiced opinion against lipos.  Its been proven over and over again that lipos are as safe as li-ion's if you care for the pack correctly...the same applies to liion pack.  I think a lot of it is that retailers want to sell li-ion packs so the pros get evangelized and the cons do not get discussed.

## \#30 Posted by: pennyboard Posted at: 2018-01-19T19:57:16.214Z Reads: 247

I think a lot of prejuice against Lipos comes from the fact that they are cheaper and easier to build.

For example, a new builder, who doesn't want to spend much money, would choose to use lipos. Since he's a new builder, he has less experience and is more likely to set them up wrong and damage them, start a fire, etc. This as opposed to an experienced builder who is more likely to shell out for a lion pack, and because he is experienced, he will know how to correctly build the pack and there will be much less chance of damage, fire, etc.

This could explain why so many people are wary of lipos, because those who used lipos are more likely to be inexperienced, and hence more likely to blow them up.

Yeah they use crappy low-discharge lipos that suffer from voltage sag, and because they are crappy, have to be replaced every year. Using quality, high discharge lipos would solve their problem. 

Lipos and lions both have advantages and disadvantages. Lions last longer, but lipos are capable of a lot higher discharge rate.

Great arguments on lipos and lions, i started with lipos and now im using lith ions, every 2 or 3 months one of my lipos (Zippy Flightmax) would start to puff up, so i changed to 18650's, no more puffy batteries.

Hmm, every 2-3 months seems really excessive. I've got 2 boards running lipos for over a year. The only time the lipos have puffed is when I ran the boards into a curb and ruptured one of the cells. Other than that, they've been running fine. And this is without a BMS (I know, I'm being risky and stupid), and charging them in series directly with a 50.4 Volt charger.

I would recommend trying these instead of Zippy compact.
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-3s1p-30c-lipo-pack-xt90.html

And I would recommend the Mini RC remote over a Gt2e. It's much more compact and very reliable.
It uses 2 AA batteries. I use 2 Lithium AA's and they last a long time

So totally forgot about the anti spark connection and I'm assuming that's a very important thing to have because it could fry my vesc if I don't have one correct ? So I would have too get (4) tx90, two connect to a serial connector with one on the closure, one xt90 to connect to the vesc and the last xt90 too make the loop anti spark ? Let me know if I'm wrong

You won't fry the VESC by not having an antispark it will fry the connectors, the spark happens where there is a small gap as the connection is made between the batteries and the VESC but it comes from inrush current filling the capacitors on the VESC from the battery.  If you are running 12S it can damage the connectors charring them, at 10S it just makes an unnerving noise but haven't had it fry the connectors entirely, still good to have it, also in my case the anti-spark is my loop key, only requirement for the loop key is it's a part of the circuit you can remove but makes sense to use the antispark there and have it be the first/last connection.

So you put the antispark connector on there and the connector itself doesn't spark when hooking batteries to the VESC, you really only *need* one anti spark plug and could just use one pair of xt-90 for between the battery and the VESC but typically want to use XT-90s to be able to attach/detach other things so it's good to get 1 antispark and a box of regular ones so you have a few extra around (also good to have some spare 12AWG silicone coated wire around)

My closure that I had too cut some stuff off. The mistake I made is that Idk if the height of this will fit my lipo batteries 😬 My batteries should come by later next week so I'll know later. Also the 3 bullet connectors from motor won't go straight since no room. If anything Ima have to put them on the side of the closure or something & motor won't get here til Monday. Even the LCD screen look like it's gonna be a problem. Wanted it on the side but don't think it'll fit so I'm guessing the top is the only way it seems. Ether way I refuse to let this be a problem & be creative. Time too brain storm 🤔

Yea coloring of wires doesn't matter but convention is to keep positive off a battery red and negative black (that said always best to test with a multimeter instead of assuming anything if you're taking things apart).  You'll have black wires going into red here from battery to battery.

If you start at the "negative" or better to think of it as "common/ground" somewhere there is no charge difference (voltage)  between the VESC itself and the lead coming off the battery.  Each cell in series adds to the voltage so 1 cell is 4.2V fully charged if you have 2 in series you have 8.4V between the "negative" or common and the positive side, when you hook batteries positive to negative it's just as though you're stacking more cells positive to negative so you're just adding voltage (2 3S in series is the same as 6S).  So if you measure the voltage between the "common/gnd" by the VESC and after your first battery (set of cells in series) you'll see the full voltage (12.6V) of that battery.  If you check the voltage after the second battery you should see the added voltage of all the cells in both batteries (25.2V).

This is probably the best visual explanation I've seen of how it all works to help you think about the flow of electricity:

Long story short your diagram looks fine to me and what patspeed said is right but the + is a different voltage depending on where you measure along the chain there (so the diagram is still correct but slightly oversimplified since the value itself changes there depending on which + you measure at).

Also regarding the xt-90s, for sure can never have too many.

Got the motor/mount/flywheel/belt on 
Now just waiting on some 5.5mm bullet plugs for my batteries since I got the wrong size 😒 (my fault should of read specs more careful)

I see that we have the same issues.
In my current build, I spent more time waiting for connectors, replacing connectors and making adapters than anything else.
Good news is, I always buy a dozen of the connectors I need so I'm sure to have any for futures builds :sweat_smile:

Is that ok where it says 11.54v ?  
On the balance charge setting I put: 5.0Amp 11.1V 
Running 5000mah 3s 25C

Yep, it will end at 12.6v

Famous last words that most of us have said. Next thing you know you spent a few thousand and are trying to sell used parts.
