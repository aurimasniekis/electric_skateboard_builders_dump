Test ride went . well. Ran the motors at 50a not sure what there rated for.  A lot slower than im used to.  But its chill enough for a corner store cruise.

Those motors will take way more amps than the urethane will handle. I don't know if those motors have some upgraded urethane, or if it even matters, but I have the exact same ones and on the second ride, when they got good and warm, the urethane started slipping and it was pretty much over for them at that point. There was a guy on here @ralphy that made some custom 100mm tires that for sure did do not slip.

Yeah I don't see that he's been here for a while. I'm not sure where else you could get these, but I could take some dimensions of the ones I have and maybe you can talk @danile into using his free water jet cutter?

A quicker and easier solution that may hold up, is to 3D print the little nubs that fit between the inner and outer plate screw holes to fill in the gap between the tire nubs, if that makes sense. I was running those for a little while, just taped to the hubs and it seemed to be holding up before I move to the bigger tires oh, so it might be worth a try. I may even have some extra ones somewhere, so if you're thane starts slipping, I'll see if I can find them. It's unfortunate, because these Hub seemed like they were pretty strong, but the urethane slipping was a major bummer.

The much maligned Kevin Dark used a drill press to bore out some abecs for hubs.  Clever little trick.  I have a set of jacobs and ran them on 12s and 80 motor amps for a bit.  No drama at all.  Powerful little hubs but the thane is a bit on the thin side.  Watch the little grub screw on the hanger.  Tends to back out and then spin your phase wires to oblivion.  Bit of 680 on there and its all good.  I'm actually looking for another set right now for a 4wd project I have had on the bench forever.  Nice back to basics build that btw  love it.

They can take it.  Just keep your eye on the heat on hill climbs.  I would also spin them up and lightly sand down the edges to create a small bevel.  Help with the chunking.  Saying that though the thane does seem to be good quality and mine didn't chunk at all before I did the mod its just really thin so does make the board a bit of a bone shaker. 

Completely forgot we already spoke on this.  Getting old mate.  lol
