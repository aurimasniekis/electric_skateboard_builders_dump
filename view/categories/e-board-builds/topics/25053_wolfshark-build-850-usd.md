Check my build out. Finally completed it. Also included prices of what I paid for each part. Been riding it for about a month. Goes pretty fast ~35km/h which is plenty good for me. Crushes hills up and down pretty good too. Just got it into FOC mode and it rides pretty juicy. 

2013 Wolfshark Deck: $50. Came with trucks and wheels too but no good for my build. Got a sweet deal from someone off kijiji (craigslist).

83mm Abec 11 Flywheels: $90 - Longboarderlabs
1/2" Risers: $5 - Longboarderlabs

Thought I would post if people were wondering about doing a similar build because I know I looked for one like this.
