Hi guys,

Please tell me what you think. Would care to hear your opinions and suggestions.

I am more thinking of the board on the right side. The board is 39.5" and 9.75" width.

I've also redesigned my current bolt on to be with M6 bolts.. However, in the process of re-designing a complete carbon fiber board I decided to build from the ground up. I realize for the motor mounts that I never planned on using a belt cover, motor pulley cover or any motor protective plate. In the end, for myself they just add to more complication, more weight, more cost. Very simple and easy to build is a better option. Here is picture of the dual rear with 12mm pulleys.

<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fe6577f1918c37b8f12c669c8f345fd7c294b5a2.jpg'>

Here is a photo of the top of the deck with the battery pack. It's a 10S3P pack. I may change to 12S3P but it tends to run bigger but I think 10S is ok since it's cheaper, flatter and not as long.

<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/12c15b049e477e3bdd5cce5322abf3afd55d5855.jpg'>

For the height of the deck, I wanted a drop through so it's real low to the ground.

<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/db8acf67b359e0a1fc21d54f033dfc7689bd25a3.jpg'>

Personally, I also want a mini deck.. This one is 30" long.

Mini - Style 1
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/636f2f7dc204d50dff67953bce2033c092a78b1a.jpg'>
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7a36986b68425639004da81e2db81510b964dfb5.jpg'>

Mini - Style 2 (Jet Board)
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6a938154c2258736547655895de88004183b28db.jpg'>

What do you guy's think?

The idea for the build is 10S3P, Dual VESC, 6355 230KV (I like the faster motors, they go 20-25% inclines much easier), 12mm belt setup. I also find the faster motors better to ride. You can always ease off the throttle if you don't want to go faster.

Looking good!  Price Point Price Point Price Point!  Any idea what they're gonna cost?  I like the first one but like already mentioned, a kicktail would be perfect.  I prefer a shorter board as long as it has a kicktail.

Just my .02 worth.

simply AWESOME !

now we have several options to choose from !

a longboard companies are producing carbon fibre decks and did a bullet proof test

But with a motor mount under the board it will hit when you turn if the deck is dropped through.   I like them all

I have the same concern. I was under the impression that drop thru decks need reverse mounted motor mounts.

I love it @torqueboards! the 39.5" on the right looks great. I would probably top-mount it, but if drop-through works I'd try it!  It looks like there there is no drop on either tail, could you add a little? I like my feet to lock in. Nonetheless, excited to see how this turns out!

Also, is that a new DIYES battery in the drawing? I would love a complete battery solution but smaller than the current market offerings, and less expensive. Maybe 5-7mAh?

Looks great @torqueboards

IMO: For the long deck the one on the right is the best. For short deck I like option 1, jet spud is kind of a boring shape to me.

Drop through works great if your choice of mount is adjustable enough.

Yeah, I like the dropthough. With SurfRodz Hex TKP Trucks the setup will be pretty sweet.

I've recently tried better CNC Precision Trucks and they are a world of a difference. I can't believe, I didn't switch before. You can get SurfRodz Hex TKP Trucks for $99 bucks.

I'm most likely looking into the dropthrough and Style 1. I did think of a kicktail option but the kicktail option would have to be about 32" could possibly make it smaller but 32" might be a better size.

ETA for the board is within the next few months. Finializing on the design first.

The motor mount is angled so you'll be able to adjust the plate. The lean is fine and won't touch. It's doable. You can angle the motors to the backside if you wanted as well. For the motor mount to be inward it just has to be very minimal.

@treenutter - The top enclosure is a flat piece of carbon fiber so the lock might be a bit more difficult. I'll try and take a look into that though.

The battery pack is new. The downside to a 5mah vs 7mah isn't much of a difference. The main cost for the battery pack is in shipping. The added cells isn't too much. It's probably better off going for a 7.5ah setup.

I was looking into a 6s3p setup vs a 10s3p and the price difference is like $50 bucks when in reality the 10s3p is a much better option.

Hub motors would be awesome on these decks most definitely :)

something with raised wheel wells would be awesome! When I am commuting and get caught in some wet areas, it is nice to not get sprayed with water.

Maybe something like the Python. If you went drop through you could even go more exagerated on the wheel wells.

Hahah! man.. tell me about it.. I always ride my board even if it's raining out because I'd prefer not to walk..The days when it's raining I always wear black pants because I'll wear khakis and end up with black spots everywhere on my pant legs.

It's possible but I think if I was to make the long deck it would be a similar style to the 1st option, unfortunately. Would be awesome to eventually have all the different deck styles.

I'd implore you to ride the Spud. The shape actually makes a lot of practical sense when going full throttle on a 29" board.

Yes it may be practical I agree. But the shape just looks like an oval and that's not the most appealing shape to me. IMO 

Maybe if I rode one it would change my mind?

I agree, it looks like a giant concave potato chip on first glance. But with the mileage I've put on it, I've come to appreciate how the shape and deep concave allows tight maneuvers and cornering. I don't think I'd feel safe without that extra real estate on the width.

"giant concave potato chip"  also looks like a cowboy's hat .

speaking of carbon fibre . i noticed almost many companies are making their own .
and whats all the hype about carbon fibre ? 

i know its harder and lighter than steel . but when it breaks upon high impact it is rendered useless . cannot be fixed with screws & nuts , melted down , weld or bend back to original form . to me its like the strongest plastic . honestly for me i prefer wood for the decks .
also honestly if i could , i would make me 200mm longboard trucks out of carbon fibre . because the heaviest item in a longboard is the trucks . 
complete carbon fibre 200mm trucks with dual rear motor mounts ?
THAT would be a game changer .


this one says "specially engineered carbon flex" i dont know if its carbon fibre . just says "carbon flex"  . aaaaaaand it says there "Out Of Stock"

Here's a new update...

Here's  a few new photos of what I'm thinking about...

I plan on making a wider truck as well. Looking at perhaps 200mm with extended axles.
15mm pulleys/belts. Dual Rear 6355. Pulleys will sit on a bearing.

It will be pretty low to the ground about 3.90" from the ground on 90mm wheels.

mock-up is nice looking but... i dont like the sound of it. is this gonna mean if in the future we want to make a board with your stuff we have to buy your custom trucks and cant use normal calibers?

@delta_19 - Custom trucks will be the same cut out as Caliber. I was originally thinking of making it different as to not copy Caliber directly.. But have been thinking of keeping it the same but if you were to purchase a new truck bracket it would be affordable around $25-$30 if I was to go a different truck hanger design.

If you want 15mm width belts, you would need the custom trucks to fit the motors.

These trucks won't be expensive. They would be $50 for a pair.

Let me know what your suggestions or opinions are.. I would be interested to know.

i already knew your new mount was going to fit calibers and wouldnt need a new truck, its more the pulleys that i dont like. adding the bearing means im kinda forced in to buying your trucks which makes it more of a ikea kit then a diy build.

IDK i just like the way we have been doing it for the last few years of just driving a bolt through the wheel and calling it a day.

well as long as the old wheel pulley stays and the new mount doesnt get in the way im happy, then i can continue to use normal calibers. you could also just make two versions of the new pulley, one with a bearing and one with out.

This is really really nice just is there's a way for you to include a little camber to the deck will be perfect , just love the camber look. 

about the pulleys with bearing I think that's the way to go. It will reduce the torsional stress in the wheels bearing.  

The 15mm wide belt it's so much better than the 9mm. With this 15mm I can brake as hard I I want and give rides to my kid or the wife even up hill.

because the the electronics are inside the board, can't a drop down be facilitated? It's not like anything extra is going underneath. Additional motor space before/after the drop down would make the board clearly targeted to the electric skateboard community and for those who would like a drop-down board (for more control and comfortable ride). Is it just me or have a lot of people been wanting a drop down with enough motor space to prevent wheel bite?

@delta I think the issue that it isn't optimal to use a 15mm belt without a bearing and without cutting away some of the truck hangar. I believe this is why the new Enertion trucks are also custom. @longhairedboy has already shown us, though, that it's possible to chop away some of the hangar on a regular caliber truck to make it all fit. 

@torqueboards I agree with @delta_19 that having both options would be great. Thanks for seeking input from us!

my ideal solution would involve an injection molded pulley bonded directly with the wheel somehow and didn't require inserts or bearings or bolts or whathave you... maybe the pully is actually part of the wheel core... a whole new wheel would have to be designed for this. but until then, yeah. Chopped trucks.

@longhaired... Yes! a flywheel-style drive wheel with an integrated 15mm pulley. I guess the only drawback would be that you couldn't replace worn urethane without getting a whole new wheel.

clones are $30/set, but good wheels are over $60/set a lot of the times. I feel like they could be made for somewhere in between there for a set, but maybe i'm just dreaming. 

Something else that may be possible is a bearing free insert for flywheel clones that can be epoxied to the core maybe.

Currently there is no drop down board with an enlarged motor well and electonic enclosure. Ppl like the drop down because they dont want straps but they want to feel "secured" on their board when moving and especially braking. You might be offering a community first and perhaps a big hit. Maybe take a poll?

Now that I think about it, all it takes to increase the motor well space before the drop is to have a sort of strong aluminum plate which sits in-between the trucks and the board's tail. Kinda like [g bombs bracket](http://www.gbomblongboards.com/pump-bracket.html) but perhaps shorter and without the bend. This would let any drop-down board become an electric skateboard. can probably be cheap too.
