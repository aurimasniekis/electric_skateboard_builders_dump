Hello! I am wondering if someone can help me. I have a Meepo V2p board and i bought a 12s2p battery from torque boards. But after installation the board turns on but thats it. The transmitter turns on and it seems to pair, but does not do anything when i oush or pull of the scroll wheel. I am wondering if i am missing something or if the ESC is programmed a certain way that does not allow it to send 12s voltage to the motors. Any helo would be much appriciated![20190316_195037|375x500](upload://x5o7DxkqN0LVGZKzYWKZpqBLDWO.jpeg)

I don't think the meepo controller can do 12s. I think you killed it lol

No after i plugged the old battery back in, it works fine.

Meepo ESC not suited for 12s. Suggest you get a 6.6 dual, Unity, or a pair of Focbox.

ESC could only run 10s, 7s, and 6s. Gotta get a VESC

I think ppl that did the 12s upgrade did it with the old meepo esc.    I might be wrong.   The eac you have is the v2 eac that came with an enclosure.

Yes, its the ESC that came with the enclosure. And yeah i just realized the people that did this swap did it with the old ESC. Just ordered a flipsky dual 4.20 VESC

Sorry to be the breaker of bad news but the flipsky 4.20 dual are known not to be reliable at 12s also your going to need a remote with a reciver to use with a vesc.

## \#11 Posted by: M.Hboards Posted at: 2019-03-17T04:02:05.468Z Reads: 129

Focbox Unity or flipsky 6.6. i would recommend a unity in your case  as it has an antispark built in. Or u can wait for the flipsky dual 4.20 plus to come back in stock as it is much more reliable at 12s and has a built in antispark.

It's no longer a simple battery upgrade anymore.  Battery, vesc and remote why not change hub motors to regular out runner belt gear system while you at it.

If you are looking for a remote.  I just designed to and built a very dependable rc remote with built in LED light.   I am taking orders now.   ![IMG_20190315_215055|375x500](upload://q1d9GmTfQkJdUfjioG1C4je5GGT.jpeg)

Is the battery fully charged? You might have some luck draining the battery to less than 50v. 

Otherwise get the unity or two focboxes and antispark and build a loop key in there too.

I haven‚Äôt tried it myself but others have had success with it. Same goes for the 4.12 single. 

I tried the 4.20 dual and that‚Äôs a no go if you want to pull anything more than 29amps on foc.

Great, all you need to do is just some soldering and you‚Äôll have a full working board, remember to configure it with the vesc tool

You should just buy one and learn. It's kinda 101 of board upkeep  .
You'll eventually need to.  Or you'll have to find help every time somthing comes up that could take you minutes to fix yourself.

Also i wouldn't trust crimp on Connectors with the vibrations our boards go through.

Soldering is key in esk8, it‚Äôs pretty easy but you can get hurt real easily if your not cautious. I would recommend getting one off amazon, it‚Äôs like 20$. Also simply go on YouTube and you‚Äôll find thousands of videos on how to solder. Good luck

Thanks guys, is there a good place to purchase the various connectors and soldering things i need? For example what will i need to get in order to connect my motors to the Vesc i ordered. I beliave the motor leads are #14 wires maaaybe #16 and the vesc likely comes with #12 motor wires. Also there are sensor wires coming off my motors, i didnt check this ahead of time but does the flipsky dual fsesc have a spot for those to land on? If so will i need diffrent connectros? Or will the meepo stock ones that are one there work ok. Thanks for all your help.

The meepo esc has one built in but in short it is a high voltage switch that turns on and off your board.

There are alternatives to an antisparks: loop keys, but I won't tell you what that is. You'll have to search for it :)

The wiring is the cruicial part, and I'll give you a hint, as I don't want you to burn your house or board down... Don't bother with the regular xt90 for the plug in bit of the loopkey. You'll need the xt90s, Amass is a favorite manufacturer for legitimate ones.

This is indeed an antispark. 

Please use the search function like Mich provided. I've got unlimited time, but my poor young thumbs just can't type all day.... 


Or can they ;)

Also, if it's not associated with @torqueboards / Dexter, and it has a DIYE / @diyeboard in the seller name, stay the fuck away üòÇüòÇ

Once upon a Time ago, a name named Jason Volan (if that's his real name :roll_eyes:) was a giant piece of shit and leaked critical customer information into the public, as well as selling parts that fail as frequently as a trucker curses. 

Stay away. stay smart.

I know you are already getting a VESC of sorts but the V2 meepo ESC has a high voltage cutoff of 48volts.

The original V1 ESC could do 12s but is locked at 22mph but you would have very little sag compared to 10s. I use 11s on the V2 ESC.

II would have just sticked to the Sanyo battery meepo has to offer. It doesn‚Äôt seem like your ready to build and mod this board. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt but it is a huge upgrade that will take some time to do. Here‚Äôs a list of what you really need to do this upgrade:

Loop key, preferably xt90, as @Sn4pz said, or a antispark switch as @Mich21050 mentioned, definitively not a diye board one 

Knowledge on soldering, and buy a soldering kit off amazon

Fsesc 6.6, which you already have in possession 

Bullet connectors, preferably 5.5mm male and female 6x

Don‚Äôt forget a remote, buy the mini remote that you can find on amazon, @torqueboards sells it 

That‚Äôs about it, but you really have to do some thorough research on here to be able to do this.

So i came up with this temporary fix for my meepo range problems. I had a soare meepo battery laying around and a battery from a one wheel. Hooked em up in parralel. Works great! Untill i get the rest of the parts i ordered this will have to do. Also regarding the video posted here. I checked the voltage on my battery it was like 47.8 i dont know...il try again and see what happens. But in case anyone is still reading this i have a question about charging. So![15528837580916450849466084764665|375x500](upload://9QefrseulEhfnNloCJHH5hVIn1h.jpeg)  my two meepo batteries have charge leads that hook up to my meepo charger...however the one wheel battety does not. Since i have them hooked up in parralel...will all 3 of my batteties charge sumultaniusly? And just take longer? Or am i playing with fire here?

Probably feels closer to a extra pep in it's step :smile: I like to cruise in the 24-26 mph range so it's worth it for my needs. I wonder what my top speed will be when I switch to the Unity and 100mm hubs :thinking:
