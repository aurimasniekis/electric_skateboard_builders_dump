Hi i am building this board with a 10S5P configuration.

I need a enclosure. and i found this. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2252464

I firstly though it would not be strong enough. But then i found this https://hobbyking.com/en_us/glass-fiber-cloth-450x1000mm-48g-m2-ultra-thin.html

And my question is. If i coat the 3d print with the glass fiber. Would the build be strong enough to place under my board?

I could also use this. But its much more expensive. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/3k-carbon-fiber-and-kevlar-29-cloth-180g-m2-1mtr.html

funny, this is actualy my cover ^^
did you print it in the right orientation?

if you print it flat on the bed it wont work because you are putting all the tention on the layers.

if you print it like in the picture, its tough as nails. printing it flat on the bed wont work. wasted quite alot of PETG on that life lesson :D

So just to make sure i see the picture correctly. Is it facing upwards?
 If you print it flat it wont come of right? and what material did you use? ABS?

yep, picture is right (even though its a failed print because it came of the bed).

I used PETG. ABS will probably work too. not so sure about PLA though

Great thanks. Have you tried coating it with carbonfiber? and do you know what the surface area of the models are? Like the underside and top side?

no coating or anything.

1 center piece is roughly 53x160x30mm

i made it to fit 3x  these beside each other

How many km have you burnt on your board?

and how did you attach it to your board ? screw, tape, glue?

screws, thats what the screwholes are for ;)

did like 100km so far. still kinda in the prototyping phase because i was trying to buld a printed motor mount as well which didnt went to well so i gave up on that idea.

IMO fibreglass enclosure is much better, it is thinner, stronger and if you spend enought time with it, it can be more beautiful...I had an enclosure from PETG and it broke after 3 rides...

no doubt fiberglass is better, but if you print PETG right you get a pretty flexible part like this

Well then the 3d printing will be cheaper...my 3D printed enclosure costed me about 30$, the glass fibre enclosure about 35$ (5 layers of 200gsm firbreglass cloth, catalyst, polyester resin, gelcoat, PVA seperator and gypsum to make the mold)

Ahh okay. What do you think of building it in a 3d printer and then coating it with this https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-Carbon-Fiber-3K-200g-m2-Fabric-Carbon-Yarn-0-28mm-Thick-Plain-Weave-Cloth/32309112929.html?spm=2114.13010208.99999999.262.JibQDP

with epoxy resin

So the enclosure would have 2 layers? It is certainly possible but it just doesnt make a sense for me...why would you make that, when you can put 2 more layers and have much better carbon fibre enclosure? If you want it to be cheap, then use just he 3d printed, adding carbon fibre will add costs...if you want a nice carbon fibre finish, than buy thinner fabric or the lookalike stickers, if you want an enclosure that will last, use just carbon fibre (you can make mold with a 3D printer)

using both material makes no sense to me, because making a carbon fibre enclosure wont be more expensive...
```

The idea was to make the enclosure with ABS 3d print. Then coat it in carbon fiber on both sides sealing it off completly. My worry is that with just 3dprint the middle could crack do to the flexibility of the board. But it wont with carbon fiber.

Im interested in the idea of only using carbon fiber. How did you accheive that? and what is needed?

I have never made one from carbon fibre, the fibre glass is more affordable, if you want a carbon fibre enclosure you will probably need just: Mold (with rounded edges), Crabon fibre cloth, Epoxy resin, gelcoat, catalyst, Separator...
To make the enclosure clean and nice like in the posts below you would probablyneed a vacuum pump...It can be done with a simple hand lay up, but i wouldnt do that with carbon...Maybe someone more experienced might help you more...

That is great. But i think i will make it with 3d print 100% infill and then add carbon layer on top. The items are really expensive in Denmark where i live.

you can check my build. I've designed and printed dozen of enclosures in PETG. I've used a layer of glass fiber on the inside to reinforce them. Never go for 100% infill. Not even 50%. It'll take up all the flex and structure to keep it rigid and tough... Post finish it with a heat gun to get the layer adhesion done.(kinda like annealing). I'd also go for min. 4mm wall thickness to get some infill in the wall too.

lay a straight edge across the top of the deck, measure from the bottom of the straight edge to the top of the deck.  Example, a 3/8's measurement means you have a 3.8's concave.

For folks thinking of 3d print and then adding CF/GF layer on top - just make sure it'll stick.  Most epoxy won't stick to plastic.  I can see using a 3d printer to make a mold, then using the 3d mold to layup your CF with vacuum for nice finish...  but sticking directly to most plastics - i think it'll separate too easily.

@MasterCho - the CF guru - can you confirm?

If you want to do CF/GF - don't use epoxy glue - instead use a real epoxy intended for CF/GF.  Thinner to "wet out" the fabric - not glue.  My favorite (but most expensive) is West Systems 105 epoxy, and 206 slow hardener.  I'd look for less expensive epoxy options in your area, but these are the top notch ones IMO.

All epoxy resin aren't manufactured equally but one that I used sticks really well to PLA. Please make sure to clean the surface well before applying and I recommend using vacuum bagging which removes trapped air, compacts the fiber layers and reduces humidity.

glue won't work well.  Can you get it to stick - maybe...  but it won't "wet out" correctly - saturate the cloth and get the fabric to stick together into one solid piece.  You'll likely have a thicker consistency w/ the glue and it'll be "splotchy" with bubbles or voids which will make it weak/fragile or simply not work at all.

There are a ton of epoxies online - I don't see where you are located to recommend one close to you (nothing noted in your profile Oliver).  [Jamestown Dist/Totalboats has a less expensive option](https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/show_product.do?pid=64343).

I'd also look on amazon for a small amount that is intended for CF.  I see some 6/12oz "kits" that are about $20-25 shipped for me in the US.

Thanks MasterCho!  I didn't know PLA would stick - that's great to know.  What epoxy do you use?

As it seems like @nikoli280 is on a budget - i'm betting vacuum is out of the equation due to cost.  I've done both and found for a simple shape - some foam and weights can do a good job compressing the layers to help instead of vacuum.

fiberglas might not stick to the 3d enclosure you might need a primer but you could use the 3d printed enclosure as a mould for the fiberglas enclosure,

Hi thanks all for replies. I liv in Denmark so some items is hard to get. I will look at the guide without vacuum. I'm on a budget. I really like the boosted board look and would like to rein act that. But it's also hard to Ger good models. I have ordered both carbon fiber and glass fiber with 200gsm. 

But as I can read, it can be difficult to use the 3d and carbon fiber together. If I can do the molding techniques then I think I will. But glue is difficult to find. Do any one know some good resin in Europe?

Denmark and boats - any marine supply should have 2 part epoxy resin for fiberglass and carbonfiber repair!

it'll be more $ than buying online, but with your 25% tax added on, perhaps not as bad!

What about printing Nylon? I think it might be a good option. 

Adding fiberglass makes the process unnecessary complex to my opinion. I would rather ad some protection material in the inside of the enclosure if required.

Also baking PLA after printing ?

The thing is nylon is so hard to dial in... Its a lot harder to print then ABS. 
My PETG one is holding up just fine. Its also up the design of the enclosure. Avoid design flaws to minimize the risk of cracks coming up.
