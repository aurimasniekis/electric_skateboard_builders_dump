I have a slight issue. I have everything for my first build. However I have a loaded vanguard and switched up and ordered a 10s3p battery from @JLabs which sizing is suppose to spec out to a similar size of a space cell 3. Now I need a stiff deck with me being 225lbs and wide enough to fit this battery.
