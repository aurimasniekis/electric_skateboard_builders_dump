Hey all,

So it's finally finished (almost). It only took all of 3 months, but I've got a fully operational electron-powered longboard. I finally rode it today and man, does she move. I owe you all something for the help you've given me, so I hope this shows you what I've been cooking up.

As you can tell by the pictures, I'm still trying to figure out the enclosure situation, so if anyone has any tips/ tricks that would be appreciated. I'm currently planning on 3D-printing one once I have access to a printer (hopefully next week), but for now, the Tupperware is adequate for the few short rides I've done. 

I suppose a little bit of background is necessary- I've been wanting to build one of these for months now, but I didn't begin buying parts until about August/September. I'm currently a university student, so I didn't have too much time to sit down and assemble the thing until this week (Thanksgiving break here in the States). I've been longboarding for a long time (at least 6-7 years) so I figured I'd jump in and see how it goes. Allow me to walk you through this build and let me know if you have any questions.

For starters, I purchased the deck off of Craigslist from an older gentleman who has been woodworking his whole life. I'm hoping the pictures do the deck justice, because it is a work of art. It's a 9-ply birch deck with a single ply of African blackwood. There's no camber on this particular deck, but I'm sure he'd be able to build some in if requested. I don't mind the flat deck, as all of the boards I've spent considerable time on have had minimal camber. If any of you are interested in getting a custom deck please let me know, as I've been thoroughly impressed with this man's work so far.

The grip tape was done by yours truly. I bought a large role of normal tape and then cut out the tape into the design you see in the photos. I wanted to display the grain of the wood, as well as find a design that complemented the shape of the deck. It took me a solid 3 hours, but I'm pleased with the results.  

I bought a fair number of these components from Torqueboards mainly so I didn't have to spend time filing down trucks to make mounts fit or messing around with connector types. I've been impressed so far, but if you're new to this and attempting to really save money, I probably could've parted out each component and cut down on cost a little bit.

I purchased the 6374 190 kv motor from Torqueboards because I wanted the hall sensors. I know VESC can run sensorless (I'm actually using it like that right now) but I want to run it in hybrid mode at some point for a smoother start-up.

I know lithium ion cells are way better in the long run than lipos, but I didn't have the expertise and time to mess around with assembling my own battery pack. Instead, I bought 4 5s,3Ah, 20C batteries and hooked them up to get a 10S2P battery pack. I haven't done a true range test yet but I'm expecting to get around 10 miles/16 km with a conservative rate of speed. I have done a max speed test today and I hit around 26mph/41kmh and I still had throttle left. I want to try to max this board out, but I'm going to have to really plan for that kind of run.

I also bought my VESC from Torqueboards. It doesn't have heatsinks like some of the other vendors offer, but I figured since I'm running a relatively cool set-up I wouldn't worry too much about it.

I wanted a small remote, so I went with the Nano 2.4 GHz remote from Torqueboards as well (anyone else seeing a theme?). Haven't tested it in a busy city setting yet, but so far no complaints.

The wheels I have are the 83mm flywheel clones sold by Torqueboards. They certainly get the job done, although the bearings that come with them are less than stellar. I picked up some Bones Reds and haven't had any problems. 

I did all of the wiring and soldering myself, which is part of the reason this build took so far to get off the ground. I went with an XT90 loop key over an anti-spark switch, because 60 USD seemed a little much when I could achieve the same effect with some wire and solder. True, it's nothing flashy, but I like functional.

I also purchased a battery display/voltmeter from Amazon, linked [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VUUKIMY/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza). I know some of you have used it before, but I can't figure out how to get it to display voltage and not percent battery capacity. If anyone has any guidance, I'd really appreciate it.

All in, I'd say the board weighs around 16-18 lbs/8-9 kg. I haven't put it on a scale yet so that's just an eyeball estimate. If anyone wants to know the exact mass, I'd be happy to weight it for you.

Linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nFkXK3hGuUf1B3RMgAA0y_9g8v0J6Cg9XMkwt4nVf9M/edit?usp=sharing) is my total cost document. Green-filled cells mean I've bought the part, yellow means I haven't yet. In my cost analysis, I also included things like soldering irons and other tools that I didn't have laying around.

I've also been thinking through some improvements I could make to this board (aside from the obvious enclosure issue).
*Headlights/taillights- I found these mounts [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:49238) and [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2018698) on thingiverse that could be easily adapted to make my board visible at night, for relatively low cost. 
*Improved wheels- I've heard that there's a big difference between flywheel clones and true ABEC flywheels, so I may look into that.
*A more elegant charging solution- I currently don't have a BMS, so that would be a HUGE upgrade over having to charge each lipo individually.
*I might use some El wire to light up the underside/make a design. Could look real cool if done properly.

And now for the real reason you all are here: photos. Enjoy, and as always let me know if you have any comments, questions, concerns, etc.

TLDR; I made a board, it goes fast, I took some photos.

The board right after I gripped the deck, before anything else went on.

I mocked up the look of the wheels and grip tape before I put anything else on.

Spent most of my Sunday soldering. Threw together a third-hand contraption out of some old alligator clips and heavy-duty wire.

Everything on the board is attached via double-sided velcro. This makes it so the enclosure doesn't have to be load bearing. Plus, I can always move stuff around if I want.

Assembling the motor, putting threadlocker on all the bolts, etc.

The guts of the board. She's not much of a looker right now, but hopefully a nice enclosure can change that.
