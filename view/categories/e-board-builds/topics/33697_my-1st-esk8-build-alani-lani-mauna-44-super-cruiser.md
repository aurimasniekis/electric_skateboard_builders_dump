Well guys, my first dive inside the hobby! I jumped into a shark infested tank with one hand tied to my back, but...what the heck!!

**Dream**: all I know is that I wanted a big longboard with lots of real state and ample room to move my feet. Also needed space to fit all the batteries and electronics below deck, thats why I chose a stiff board (Alani Lani - Mauna 44") with slightly 10 mm of flex -if I step over with all my weight at the very center- (which in practice rarely happen). Hope this slack will not affect the overall position of the battery. 

**Platform**: the Mauna 44" is a spectacular board. Shaped cores laid up with 22 Carbon reinforcements + epoxy resin around a Baltic birch wooden deck; It is super light (1,6 Kgs), long, sleek, and strong as a rifle barrel. 

**Trucks**: because I wanted wider and sleeker trucks I chose the Evolves 12" trucks. Now my pockets are suffering the burden but 'am just barely starting with the shopping list. 

**Skills**: I don't have engineer knowledge, I'm not CAD savvy, know nothing of 3D printing, but 'am just learning a lot from everybody here at the forum. I only have the sheer will and a strong desire to build the esk8 of my dreams. 

**Wish**: hopefully I will meet people at the forum willing to help me out with the things I ignore and to get that ideal eboard that all of us desire. 

**Next items in the list**: to find a motor mount that will fit the rear Evolve truck; suitable motors for those mounts (because the original Evolve motors are a pain and suck); and to find out if wheather or not the Evolves will accept those dreamed MBS 100 mm all-terrain wheels without major mechanical changes to the trucks axles.

Tell me what are you thinking? Any suggestions? 

Cheers boys!

I measured the trucks there at the shop because I read somewhere they were 306 mm... and yes, they were 12" inches (306 mm or 30 centimeters) according with the clerk's tape measure.

This was one of my main interest in these trucks because I always wanted a wide truck, the widest I can get. Because I was also looking for stability while riding (no shorter trucks for me) and for the boards stance. This is the idea of what my future board should look and I believe is one of the facts why Evolve eboards are so appealing to people. Their aggressive look is a result of being so low on the ground and seem to be so wide over the tarmac.

I'm new to this, so in a way a bit ignorant. Some times when you are new and ignorant about certain aspects of your hobby you easily get things others still consider difficult. Case in point, I walked in to the local eboard store here in San Fran (Calikytes) just to check their new Evolves, and just there, sitting on the shelve, they had this pair of Evolve trucks as spare parts inventory. So what 'am saying is, everybody thinks is super difficult to get parts from Evolve thru their web page because they won't sell you things if 'you are not a previous Evolve owner'. Well skip that, my suggestion, simply go to any other Evolve distributor around the country (US) they should have large inventories about anything related to Evolve. Money talks. Forget about their website.

Yes you can order the trucks of one of the evovle web sites.  you can order everything but the motor and vesc   you can use other DIY site for parts   here is a list for reference:

Hobby King good for motors electronic
Scram boards full kits just add skateboard
Evolve good for most parts
Enercia   good for mostly parts and info has kits too
DIY    skate boards has most parts 
ebay    hit or miss mostly low quality
Kali NYC     only esk8 mechanic and board builder I know for hire.
Trampa      long board and mountain has some of the best parts on the market very expensive
Etoxx      Great CNC and machine parts and fabricating
DIY esk8  site    has full kits
Torque:
Alien power systems has most everything

There are a lot more I just cant remember off the top of my head

Turning ability of the evolve truck.  In case anyone didn't notice this evolve  truck is a double king pin truck,  which means it has double turning radius of most trucks.  watch the video jed board vs evolve.  Both are great boards but the evolve kills it in the turn.  You can watch beginners jump on the the board first time and ride it in 5 min. no offence to jed boards but evolve is killing it in many areas.  many are now saying bamboo is the way to go over carbon for deck ass well.

The 306mm truck is awesome until you try to kick-push your board and you keep hitting the back wheel with your paw.  Everything else about them is awesome.  It'd be killer if the front ones were 350mm and the back ones were 250mm, especially with the SuperFly wheels about to drop on the scene

No If you install them on this 44" deck, you wont hit a thing, specially with sidecuts like those (this board was made with Long Distance Push in mind)....

Ok boys, this esk8 Mauna its taking shape. I believe is the first one ever sporting Evolve trucks and MBS 100 mms. I'm so excited. Parts been sitting there eating dust for couple of weeks because I was waiting for a minuscule ítem to finally start the assembly... $ 4 dollar thin shock pads!

I went double set with those for each cutout. The Evolve trucks beign drop-thru requiered doubble safety padding in my personal opinion, above, between the truck plate and the deck, and below, between the deck and the holding nuts.

All because in order to achieve this project I choose the stiff Mauna 44" (they come in just two simple flexes, soft or stiff) because I need to store all the batteries and electronics below deck. This brought a different challenge... I needed more cushioning.

This is an awesome project. I think I might build on this deck one day. It fits my Big Kahuna style lol. 

How do you plan on fastening the enclousure to the deck? Looks tricky with the uneven surfaves and CFbconstructuon.

What will u use for an enclousure? Id think a CF enclousure would be ideal, Master cho enclosure? What have u got planned?

Alani Lani, built in Hawaii, offices in Evergreen, Colorado. Talk to Bill Adams, nice guy. He will be surprise if you call him because I told him the deck is just perfect to start a dreamed esk8 project. It was originally designed for LDP in mind (that is Long Distance Push, and is clear when you see the narrow side cuts that it provides a comfortable gap for the longboarder's leg push below the shoulders). This deck is regarded as a thoroughbred in the world of long distance longboarding. A specialized board. Exotic as exotic could be.

The Mauna is made with precise machined wood, Baltic birch stripes side canted, sandwiched and glued together; cut to shaped form, reinforced with 22 layers of carbon fiber and designed with cruciform beams below for added strength. In all, just 1.6 kilograms (mere 3.5 pounds) of feather weight carbon Kahuna super cruiser.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/f/0f7c4cc6c518c63380268a1d1070f3522c6ad6c9.jpg" width="500" height="500">

Surprisingly, the Mauna 44" also offers a beneficial side effect... it's the perfect platform to start your dreamed esk8 project. Comes with wheel cutouts which handles any size wheel and drop through mounting. In fact, the designer (who never in his wildest dreams thought about esk8) conceived the Mauna to carry the largest wheels available today, ABEC 11 107mm Flywheels and Ronin trucks. So if you are considering a longboard for your next project, I think the Mauna comes as a natural choice if you ask me.

This is my dream. Hope you guys enjoy this assembly evolution.

I'm thinking a 3d print enclosure (which will be segmented in parts off course). As for attaching the enclosure I've been thinking either, Velcro or some type of super stick black automotive silicone, no drilling holes for this one.

Hmm, velcro might work if the weight of the battery isnt on the enclousure. Im dealing with a similar situation on my trampa build at the moment. Im using 4 inch wide, double sided velcro straps fastened to the board that then overlap on top of the battery to hold it onto the bottom of the deck, so the enclosure doesnt have to support any of the battery weight. Ill still need at least a few holes in the board to fasten the velcro straps to the board.  The 10S5P battery you're using weighs like 6lbs or so, but industrial velcro is pretty strong. Im interested to see how it holds up for you.

I considered just using velcro between the deck and batteries as well but I dont feel confident it wont work its way free and crack my enclousure over time.

Should ride like a flying carpet. It was originally designed for long distance push. As it is now, both trucks and wheels weight more than double as the carbon deck itself. It was also intended for use with the largest wheels on the market: ABEC 107 mm Electric Flywheels - 62 CP. So imagine the possibilities with this platform on the hands of avid e-boarders?

This is what I have in mind for the battery installation underneath the deck. This is where my inspiration comes from (combat aircraft stores), the mechanics of the concept I got in my head. (never mind the bombs you see there) just the racks and pilons installation and configuration that matter to me for the task at hand...

That's right. Off the shelf! :thumbsup: Go look out there what items you need, I bet there are hundreds that fit your taste. Pick them up, gather the whole enchilada and start assembling your dreamed esk8. That's what I did. Before starting I searched all websites on the planet. Few months of digesting information, picking here and there, reaching dead ends (like when I was looking for a dreamed alluminum deck, and learned that Dave's Cindrich will no longer manufacture his Silverfish). Changed direction and followed other paths. Finally I found what I liked, got a nice Hawaiian longboard (Alani Lani) and started from there on.

* What is the witdh of middle hanger's cross section hexagonal looking edge?

is this the angle you where looking for? if not, could you use a picture to describe it? 

i didn't understand the second question. a picture would help.

I'm thinking a 3d print enclosure (which will be segmented in parts off course). As for attaching the enclosure I've been thinking either, Velcro or some type of super stick black automotive silicone, no drilling holes for this one.

If you still thinking of using velcro you should should consider 3M Dual Lock, it's a turbocharged velcro.

Also why not use a Evolve front trucks as a rear one with a normal clamp and mount instead of using the rear truck? May be it works. I'm asking bc I also am interested in building my future board with Evolve super carve trucks.

Me too I considered that at the begining. But when I had the chance to get the pair of trucks (front & rear) exibited at the local Evolve distributor I didn't thinked twice and forgot all about getting two front trucks.

I think the image needs to turn 90 degrees to the left (counter clockwise), the plane horizontal is the blue line, right? and right side of the image is the hanger's top?

If that so, then yes, that was the angle we needed. :thumbsup:

After much consideration and searching troughout the forum and the esk8 Universe for weeks, I finally decided which wheel pulleys I wanted to use on my build.

Considered lots of alternatives, 3D printed pulleys, ABS, Nylon, Carbon-Nylon, 100% infill, with 3 screws, with 6 screws, with retainers, with no retainers, with sprockets, with half sprockets, with no sprockets, generics, dedicated, aluminum, with nut inserts, etc, etc, etc...

Finally I came to my senses and decided that the best option for me, since I was using an Evolve truck and MBS 100 mm wheels, was to use the same proven Evolve (own 97mm, ABEC 97 & 107mm) wheel pulley and simply shaved the nylon sprockets to a reduced size to fit in to the small MBS hub openings, and that's what I did with amazing results.

The Evolve wheel pulley is designed specifically for the Evolve truck, so why go elsewhere to get this Generic-Frankenstein bolted-retainer nightmare-plastic pulleys from hell, when you just may adapt an existing dedicated wheel pulley (with sprockets) from the same brand to use in this not-so generic MBS 100's wheel hub (??)

To the right the original unshaved Evolve 38T wheel pulley; on the left the same wheel pulley almost completely shaved to a reduced sprocket size and ready to fit into the MBS wheel hub.

* (Observe how left wheel pulley sprockets are proportionaly down in size, perfect to fit into the MBS 100 mm wheel hub)

Pulleys shaved to reduced proportional size by simply using an X-Acto knive. It was Barber time!

[/quote]


this is how i make my enclosures (and other things i need for prop work and castings...) so this is the part where u take the most time, the least amount of creases the less sanding and bondo u need.... from here u wrap the tape in cellophane and make sure to keep it tight and keep your profile... from here you can get fiberglass matt or chunks and resin and start applying the glass and resin layer by layer until the desired thickness is reached, from there you let it cure and monitor it for warpage. You can take extra steps such as vacuum bagging but that is a process in itself and early on i didnt have a vacuum pump nor the supplies to do so... but i was still able to make my props w/o vacuum bagging
