Hello,

I've been designing and planning a custom motor mount for penny board trucks and I'm almost completely done on the design. The concept behind this is to have a truly compact electric Penny board without making it wider from larger trucks such as hub motors or caliber trucks. I'm hoping to be able to ride to school and between classes.


The base is a 22" penny Board with a single belt driven motor and a custom 3d printed motor mount which will be reinforced with a sheet of carbon fiber. The pulleys will also be 3d printed. I plan to get everything cnc milled from aluminum later once i have access at work during my coop job in september.

Im not too sure about the motor, vesc, and battery as id like to keep the price pretty low, but i was thinking of buying the FSESC 4.12 from Flipsky along and maybe one of their motors. Im still considering between building a li-ion battery or buying a lipo pack.

For the remote i plan to 3d print and build the "Simple 3d Printed NRF Remote" by @solidgeek

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543?u=rice
 
The motor mount is in its final stages and fits very snugly and securely to the truck and still allows movement, although the motor may have to be moved a little closer to the ground for clearance with the board. The bolts holes and motor bolt holes will be finalized once i get a motor and belt.

Any help and tips are appreciated towards the electronics and the remote as i'm quite new with all of this.

i wanted to post this and get some help before buying all the electronics i will need for this build.

Thanks, 
Dan

Well the Fsesc 4.12 is OK for this build but I wouldn't recommend their motors. I would go with Racerstar 5065 140kv
https://banggood.app.link/1tjopq6RCW
For battery:

Samsung 40T or 30T in the max configuration that you can fit under. But you'll need a spot welder or get 1 Nese (if they make for 40T) or @Winfly module

Thanks for the reply @Grozniy 

Is there a better place to get a motor then banggood. Would getting an sk3 or sk8 motor from hobby king ship faster to Canada and be better? (maybe a 6354 sk8)

Also does anyone know a place to source cells in Canada.

My friend is using samsung 30q cells, i will ask where he got his cells.

Thanks,
Dan

Here's my Penny (long) board but it's got the width to run calibers

If i cant find a supplier for cells, would a lipo pack from hobby king be sufficient for approximately 10 km, as it may be easier to mount.

something like this:

[Lipo Battery](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-professional-8000mah-6s-15c-lipo-pack-w-xt90.html?wrh_pdp=2)

That Lipo you linked is definitely enough to get you more than 10 km, probably about 15km (176 Wh battery, I guess you would use about 10 Wh per km, but might be worse) It might be worth using 2 lipos in series instead of one single one to get a more suitable form factor. If you want to use 6S (which i guess is decent choice for a small 22" board), you could use 2x 3S batteries side by side.

Going the lipo route for a lightweight board makes sense if you want the power but don't have the space for enough Li-ion to provide said power. 2 of those lipos you linked should give you around 30km as @Vykku said.

@Vykku 
Yeah i was also considering 2 lipos in series, im not sure what form factor would allow to keep the middle of the board open to allow for some flex still.

@rusins 
Because its just the 22" penny board i dont think i could fit 2 lipos, also my school is only quite close so 10-15 km range is more then plenty. i appreciate the input.

Thanks,
Dan

Nice, how wide is the board and how wider are the trucks, also what batteries are you using?

I really don't think you would be able to get free space in the middle on a 22" penny board, and also be able to fit a battery and a esc, especially since you're mounting the motor forward. Even with no free space left in the middle, it would be a pretty tight fit. 

But at the same time, it is a 22" board with a kicktail, do you even feel any flex on it at all, since the location where you usually rest your feet are pretty much on top of the trucks.

penny plastic has a good amount of flex if you jump in the middle

Oh sorry, i was too lazy to take off the rear wheel to mock the motor mount. The motor will be mounted in the rear. I will try and get more pictures tonight. 
Hopefully i can have the battery not stick out the sides by placing them near the front where the board is a little wider.

and @AlanZhou is right, the penny boards plastic is incredibly flexible. I can get the board to almost touch the ground when i jump in the center 

Thanks, 
Dan

I guess then you could make separate enclosures for battery and esc, and mount them only in their middles so when you bend the deck, they won't affect the flex at all. 
![image|568x453](upload://e4AnaacdYmW37EJOWY8Ea7QV5jv.png) 

Since you're 3d printing parts, you could 3d print these enclosures as well

Yeah that‚Äôs the plan, hopefully a small flexible enclosure for the esc in the middles and a larger one for the battery near the front trucks

Here is the update on the motor mount with my 5055 sk3 motor. I‚Äôve added coverings around the motor to stiffen the print, for the final design I will also be epoxying carbon fibre sheet over the motor as a skid plate just in case. 
I have some 14 layer 0.155‚Äù thick carbon fibre. 

I also got the 2 batteries, which looks like there‚Äôll plenty of room for the FSESC and to be able to keep some flexibility.

What width belts are you going to use? There does not seem to be an awful lot of space for it.

Also this part of the mount seems way too thin, even if you'll add carbon fiber sheet to it it might bend: 
![image|682x500](upload://61t3ATtcDMbZf23K6rNdbFlWT92.jpeg) 

Have you considered making it a bit thicker, as there is nothing on the other side of the motor that restricts moving it to the left.

haha didnt think anyone would notice, theres .450" so barely enough room for a 12 mm belt but its really tight. i will probably thin down the carbon fibre to for more clearance

Also that thin part is 0.100", but in the other picture you can see i reinforced by the  cover for the motor and the thin part will be replaced with 155 thou carbon fiber sheet. both sides will be carbon fiber to sandwich the printed mount with an epoxied skid plate for the motor.

I cant just move the mount over as its actually clamping the penny truck to stay together.

i may 3d print or buy some spacers for a tiny bit of extra room for the belt.

Going with a 9mm belt might help save so room also.

hey, ill probably switching to a 9mm belt like you said. ill definitely need the extra room to fit some flanges on the pulleys.

Ive been working on the remote and waiting for all the parts from china.
Once im done the remote i will finish designing the motor mount and make a carbon fibre mount and i have to design the enclosure which will be 3D printed with a carbon fibre skidplate for now.

I did get to test out the motor, ill add pictures soon.
