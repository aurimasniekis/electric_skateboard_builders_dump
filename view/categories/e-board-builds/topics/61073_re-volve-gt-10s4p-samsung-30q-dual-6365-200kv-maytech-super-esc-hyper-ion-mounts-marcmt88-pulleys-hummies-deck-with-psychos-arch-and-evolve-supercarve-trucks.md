So last summer i bought myself a bamboo gt and it didnt take long for me to find this forum afterwards and get me thinkin of that diy route. Built a 12s single drive and was getting similar range and better performance with a 2p battery and a single 6374. When the evolve remote had an issue i quickly parted it out here to fund its replacement. Learned to make battery pack via cell-level fusing and began putting together this upgraded gt ðŸ˜Ž

@thiswasandy, the trucks are the best component from evolve ðŸ¤£ they can be good at speed if you take the time to get proper bushings and pivot cups ðŸ˜‰
