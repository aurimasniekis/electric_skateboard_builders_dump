Width wise they look like Moe's 150mm gravity trucks. Some people like e'm narrow. Ronin's...
Turn in is faster, but not less stable as many think, deffo more grip but easier to lift a wheel, often need softer bushings to dial in set-up in my experience.

Wait and see how this one pans out ;)

Narrow is good it's grippier. I'm just curious how Drivetrain goes on that narrow, with the links right against the inner tire? Unless the rear is wider? I'm guessing it's on the ground upside down in the pictures? Or is this just super low?

Bringing some experience into this build..  Working with a pro Downhiller who knows 90+mph and incorperating his expertise. Testing will start in five weeks. This will be a front drive venture to start with, a narrow rear creats less fulcrum input from the axel to the board.. taking the drive off the rear also removes that dynamic. Keeping it simple as possible on the rear we both agreed will be the best setup for success..

So what are the biggest hurdles here?

There are skate setups that go incredibly fast, and have been for a really long time.
So it terms of a setup that can reach a particular speed you could just emulate whats out there, but clearly you haven't.

For now the 10400w 8s deleviry system is ample for 75mph..   I'm happy with it's performance and reliability.. if we run into problems testing it will be addressed. Changing the drive to mod 1.5 gears.. It moves the motor far enough away from the Axel that it can be narrowed 2". Still like the Castle Mamba XL X

Don't know about esk8 or 75mp/h +. 
65+ on a gravity set up feels like the closest thing to flying honestly. The wind and its force is present at all times, feeling like a wall you are leaning against. Even though you fly by like a car your movements are slow, gracious and very mind full. You behave like in trance or a sloth waking up. Usually I am 100% in the moment. Not thinking, fully relying on instincts and muscle memory. Especially in wide corners you can fully grip it feels like your are riding with the wind. 
10 minutes of that calmness in mind is more relaxing for everday stress than a weeks worth of holidays to me. 

Afterwards the tingling and blood rush is a good indicator as well. Your just not quite sure if its the road vibrations or the adrenalin.

[/quote]

I bet it's a copper pipe cut down as a sleeve over the axle. For temp transfer like you said(keep the bearings cooler?)

My guess is  he will cover the copper in everbrite or acylic to prevent a patina. And will likely polish it before he's done.

Either that or it's flamed titanium past the üåà

Ordered 50' 8ga wire.  Went to wire up the harness and the joke was on me.. CCA aka copper clad aluminum.  Joke was on me, 50' of junk.. Live and learn.

Where all things that are too good to be true come from. China if course. They would probably wind motors with this if they could get solder to stick to it. Took the WR board for a short up & back ride last night. Mod 1.5 gears are quieter than I thought. The reduced steering ratio will need some ride time to get used to. Overall it's rolls smooth and straight.  Today will find some smooth asphalt and stretch it out a bit.   ![IMG_20180603_112135|575x500](upload://3gY6YFVwBwkTAz8jvwZfsaUw5GS.jpg)

i would advise against that for this specific build.  aerodynamics, wouldn't want to create any kind of unwanted lift or drag plus i cant imagine a rider moving around a lot at these speeds.

examples...
-added weight
-more options put on something, more things can go wrong.

My 2 cents :wink:

Current world record skateboard speeds have been increased from adding more weight, not less..

Aerodynamics of this attempt will be crucial and the devilish details will be in the rider's tuck. Some DH pros practice in wind tunnels if they can afford it and tune their tuck using science for their body. I would find one of those guys for this attempt, adding some drag to the board itself is minimal effect where-as finding the rider with the lowest drag coefficient is extremely important..

A foot stop or fender to protect the wheels from impact with the rider, isn't something that can go wrong, but it's a device to prevent something from going wrong...frankly I'm the last guy you will find adding anything unnecessary to a setup, but in this case, I would recommend it because I have hit my feet on wheels before and it ain't fun or pretty..and if the design of the fenders took into account aerodynamics it's an opportunity to actually reduce drag. I know it's may sound and even look funny when implemented, but the LDP guys use them for a few reasons (mostly rain) and DH has used them for aerodynamics in the past..

If you want to get nuts you just go straight to luge or skatecar...the luge guys are breaking 100mph without motors and blowing up Flywheels from centrifugal force..![34396130_1908913192472323_8699881305191481344_n|640x500](upload://3GOeMVmILle8xz96O3xT03p6Y0K.jpg)

I'm pretty confident this is not out of development/testing yet, having spoken to Moe about the final deck and Aero I think he is still testing & a way away from handing this over to his jockey. He did announce previously he had a PRO from his local DH scene he was talking to about getting on and pulling the trigger :gun:

This doesn't give me the "jello" feel.  This looks more like an old GoPro before they added stabilization.  If it is a GoPro, it is also possible that it is slightly loose in the case.  Sending the footage through Adobe Premier Pro Warp Stabilization would it improve it a bit.  Just holding the camera in hand would also improve the footage quite a bit.

On a motorbike laying it over is better than getting high-sided: you don't have as far to fall & you meet the ground in a more controlled way.
Same goes for a skating: I'd rather ice out with a hand down than lose control while standing upright.

Up to maybe 20mph you can run/roll out of something if you are lucky, past that it is nasty, you don't want to be cartwheeling down the road at 60mph :fried_egg:

I'm not necessarily talking about for the ultimate speed record run, but more for comparison purposes to see what could be achieved in an optimized pneumatic setup. It would be interesting to have a category for top speed on a solid wheel board, and a category for top speed on pneumatics.

Pnumatics are totally doable. Not sure the tire quality on small pnumatics is ready for 70mph. With a stack of engineering cash and development thrown at it I think pnumatics could be a fantastic option for speedo.

i get 11773w wind watts (78.9lbs wind drag force) @ 75mph if we assume 0.85 drag coefficient, 0.6m^2 frontal area & 1.225kg/m^3 fluid density of air.

top speed looks to be 85mph w/ 101lbs thrust, 17138w wind watts, 587a system battery current, 300a motor current, 19505w electrical watts assuming:

33.2v battery, (2) 850kv motors, 0.0135ohm, 120mm tire, 4:1 gear ratio, 300a motor current limit, 300a battery current limit

Ok, so I lowered the drag coefficient from 0.85 to 0.75 and lowered the motor current limit from 300a to 145a, which gives 6393w electrical watts and 5826w mechanical watts while accelerating through 60mph to reach a top speed of ~63mph.

Using these same assumptions, reaching 75mph top speed involves increasing the motor current limit to 210a, which @ 75mph gives 11737w electrical watts, 10547w mechanical watts, 353.5a system battery amps & 70.7lbs thrust.

I'm glad your posting up a #.  When we posted the projected # for 65mph then we damn near nailed it the nay-sayers stopped arguing about the method we used to find it. I still believe the tools we use will continue to be ZIP code accurate. If not we will should hit our mark with the available 5000w in the bank.   https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wr-board-build-75mph/53283/121?u=moestooge  https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-fast-is-too-fast/39104/118?u=moestooge

just curious why the max rpm in that link says 3312rpm... wouldn't 60mph with a 120mm tire be ~4268.9 wheel rpm?

also the gear ratio says 8.44:1, and the max current 111.1a... my calculator suggests 5.5:1 ratio would be necessary for 63mph top speed with 800kv, 120mm tire and 111a motor current limit....

ok so when I use 15/62 4.13:1 gear ratio, 29.6v battery, (2) 800kv, 0.0135ohm, 160a motor current limit, 111a battery current limit per motor, 0.75 drag coefficient & 0.6m^2 frontal area, i get almost exactly 63mph top speed & 111a battery current per motor, 137.4a motor current, 6061w mechanical watts & 5318w wind watts @ 60mph.

Using the same gear ratio, I then increased the motor current limit to 210a, and the battery current limit to 200a per motor, in an attempt to reach 75mph... but I found that 100% duty cycle is reached below 75mph, resulting in max battery current of only 150.36a per motor @ 75mph... resulting in only 8291w mechanical watts @ 75mph, not enough to overcome the predicted wind 10388w resistance.

By changing the gear ratio from 15/62 4.13:1 to 16/62 3.875:1, 100% duty cycle wasn't reached until above 75mph, enabling the necessary 200a battery current per motor, 206.7a motor current & 10686w mechanical watts to overcome the 10388w predicted wind resistance at 75mph...

if i put the same 0.6 coefficient of drag and 5sq/ft into the same calculator for 60mph instead of 75mph we get 60mph (3631w) vs 75mph (6860w), in other words, regardless of which calculator & variables are used, the mechanical wattage required for 75mph is nearly double that required for 60mph... so are we saying it takes 6000w mechanical or 3631w mechanical to sustain 60mph?

(for comparison 0.75 drag coefficient and 6.46ft^2 (0.6m^2) frontal area gives 5318w wind watts at 60mph & 10388w wind watts @ 75mph)

if the battery doesn't sag below 31v with 15/62 4.13:1, then my predictions are--

60mph-- 122a motor current, 93a battery current per motor | 5783w electrical & 5381w mechanical combined (2) motors

65mph-- 143a motor current, 119a battery current per motor | 7385w electrical & 6834w mechanical combined (2) motors

70mph-- 165a motor current, 148a battery current per motor | 9226w electrical & 8492w mechanical combined (2) motors

75mph-- 190a motor current, 184a battery current per motor | 11451w electrical & 10477w mechanical combined (2) motors

@MoeStooge do you think those motors might be closer to 893kv?

from your data:

max wheel rpm 3312rpm * 8.444:1 programmed gear ratio = **27966.52rpm actual peak motor rpm**

27966.52rpm actual peak motor rpm / 31.3v max voltage = **893kv**

right, because you told it the gear ratio is 8.444:1...

so if it thinks the gear ratio is 8.444:1, and it thinks the max wheel rpm is 3312rpm based on that ratio and the actual motor rpm, wouldn't that mean by extension that the actual peak motor rpm is: 

3312rpm * 8.444:1 programmed gear ratio = 27966.52rpm actual peak motor rpm

and if the actual peak motor rpm was 27966.52rpm, and the actual peak voltage was 31.3v, and assuming you did an unloaded full rpm test at some point in the data log:

27966.52rpm actual peak motor rpm / 31.3v max voltage = 893kv

no?
