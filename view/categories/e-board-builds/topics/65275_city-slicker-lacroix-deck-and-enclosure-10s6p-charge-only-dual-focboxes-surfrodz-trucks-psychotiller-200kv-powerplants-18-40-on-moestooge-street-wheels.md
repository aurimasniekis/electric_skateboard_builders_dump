Hey guys!  I really want to get the build thread on my latest project out, because it is SICK!

I haven't had a chance yet, because every spare minute I have, I've been on this rig!

So here it goes, here is "City Slicker,"  and she is very happy to meet you!

So a couple of months ago, a buddy and I hopped on the Lacroix group buy https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lacroix-board-co-wood-and-cf-deck-segmented-flex-carbon-fiber-enclosure-group-buy-completed/49051?u=sender

I wanted to do something a little different than just assembling essentially the same specced out board they are offering.  Not that it isn't AMAZING looking, but you know..... Science... and DIY.....

I was against going the Trampa route, and MBS trucks were surprisingly hard to come by for a bit there.  So I bought some Surf Rodz RKPs 200mm with adjustable base plates (hopefully they are back on their site soon).

https://www.surf-rodz.com/products/truck-parts/rkp-adjustable-base

I got the trucks a good bit before the deck and sort of convinced myself that my whole idea of using the Surf Rodz set up on a Mountain Board was stupid and probably wouldn't work for some reason or another.

So, I threw it all on my Bludgeon, Tico.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/tico-red-ember-bludgeon-dual-sk3-6374s-190kv-focbox-15-40-abec-107s-12s5p-bypass-30q-psycho-mounts-and-enclosure/55852?u=sender


Tico is sick, and I was sold that I wasn't even going to try to fix it to the Lacroix, because....well, I didn't want to have to change that whole setup on the Bludgeon just to try something that probably wouldn't work any way..... oh well, idea scrubbed,  I resigned to just waiting until MBS got more stock and I would just do something with that.  No biggie.

Well, fast forward a couple weeks, and one of the sensors failed completely and it was annoying, so I took it apart, and preceded to have a little motor dilemma.  So, damn, Tico, My Bludgeon is back on the bench. LAME

Then, destiny struck.  It was a rainy day and I glanced over to that Lacroix, sitting there.... helpless.  With Tico down for repairs, "why not take the afternoon to see if this would work on the Lacroix."

So the angles on the kicks on the Lacroix are 30degrees.  I set the rear base plate to 15 degrees and the front to 25 degrees.

REAR: 30degree (kick) + 15degree baseplate = 45degree

Front: 30degree (kick) + 25 degree baseplate = 55degrees.

![20180818_100558|690x388](upload://ud18Np53Rqtp2YUPhfkCFlYMqBO.jpg)![20180818_100605|690x388](upload://71LlGkf9M7sbB68xpc5sgbkFmPT.jpg)

The holes on the Lacroix didn't quite line up with my baseplate, so I had to drill them out a bit more.  MBS trucks must just be ever so slightly different than normal Old School baseplates. No biggie.

So I mounted it all up and took it to the back parking lot and pushed it around with 107s.

OMG IT WORKS!  It pushed like a damn dream, Carvey, but stable.  Rolled over everything! 

I made some 1/2" risers out of an old chopping block for these base plates while it was on my Bludgeon.  I even routed out a channel on one to act as a sort of "Tunnel Riser" 

![20180602_102202|690x388](upload://rEUa6HRrhaZbnK5TteuppyILGKU.jpg)![20180601_192713|690x388](upload://yM1GN0Lm06u9760fqfi85t2wUYg.jpg)![20180602_101742|281x500](upload://AaZV1ObdL8hfkQPAcOPnlOfOIXb.jpg)![20180601_194925|690x388](upload://4gvV1rOFlkyAvDFhyudkEcvYJkd.jpg)![20180601_193450|690x388](upload://mzO4ZlH2enHCXFc06mVWoIPIq0e.jpg)![20180601_194957|690x388](upload://dS2RqXCRHItCKGsttpZxZE1YHHU.jpg)![20180601_214948|690x388](upload://lm1sB0tXRPAf04rQzBLLIxhMMkS.jpg)

The original plan was to put on some @psychotiller 6 shooters....
 But after riding it on the 107s and realizing with the 1/2" risers I had plenty of clearance, I decide to stick with the 107s. 

 I am putting those bad ass 6 shooters and some SZ TKPs on the Bludgeon..... win fucking win.

![20180807_201429|690x388](upload://dRLk3HqAGmKavlpCRWCqnaiaOt5.jpg)

So I built the battery myself, I don't feeling detailing it particularly.  It is a 10s6p with charge only BMS.  I siliconed it into the enclosure for dampening. Worked a treat.  Here are some build pics:

I noticed on my Bludgeon I would get some thermal throttling day time riding hard in this Alabama Summer.

I took a tip from @Deckoz  to minimize this on City Slicker.  I got a big 1/4" piece of aluminum stock and cut it to fit the enclosure.  Then I thermal taped it down to the enclosure and thermal taped my FOCBOXs to the plate.  This has DEFINITELY helped. I haven't had any throttling issues even pushing it in the midday heat. It adds some mass and cools down fast as hell.

 Of course I am using psychotiller motor mounts and his 200kv 6369 power plant with this 10s6p battery.

![20180818_100549|690x388](upload://eyETLtHZO3hbPoskeAl8YQM3bSv.jpg)

Here are the settings I have right now, but of course, I want to edge them up a little:

15/40 on Abec 11 107s

(On each Vesc):

70 Motor Max
-55 Motor Min
60 Battery Max
-14 Battery Min

This gets me right at 30mph, with a ton of torque.  I want to change to at least a 16t motor pulley, maybe 18t, to trade a little torque for a bit more speed. 

 I also want to try bumping up to this:

75 or 80 Motor Max
-65 Moror Min
65 Battery Max
-17 Battery Min


Haven't tried this yet, and don't want to push it tooo hard.  I would love to hear what you guys think is reasonable to push it to....

TLDR:

Lacroix Deck and Enclosure

10s6p 30q Battery Samsung 30q

Dual FOCBoxes

Surf Rodz 200mm RKPs with adjustable base plates

Psychotiller Motor Mounts 

Psychotiller 200kv 6369 PowerPlants

Abec 11 107s

@dickyho 40t Wheel Pulley

Build kit Board BT module

Riptide pivot cups and bushings

Ackmaniac 3.latest FW

Custom chopping block Tunnel Risers 

Custom Focbox heat sink (well its just a hunk of metal in my case)

Firefly Remote


City Slicker gets 30 ish MPH top speed (going to change to get a bit more top end).  And is Carvey as hell yet stable as fuck. What a combo!

I am still planning on polyurethane and glass frit, but I will do it some rainy day.  I can't stop riding!

Thanks for Reading!

![20180817_173652|690x388](upload://9CstLmfTrwzUOESforbuGsf7B88.jpg)

(I will probably edit this later, as I typed all this on my phone, so I am sure it is full of errors and I am sure I have forgotten about things I meant to mention.)

**UPDATE**

So I finally got around to getting City Slicker looking pretty (and a few other little improvements)!  I was planning on glass frit the entire time, but it took me a while to find the time to do it.


Also, I jumped on some @MoeStooge Street Wheels, which really add a lot to the look and ride feel of the board.  

![20181223_111339|666x500](upload://oJrDawTfje6gshVDdrupdOECskI.jpeg) 

While the wheels do decrease efficiency a bit and add some extra rolling resistance compared to 107s, they are damn glue on the road.  It is such a cool design, and I consider myself lucky to be able to grab one of the first 6 sets sold.  Soon I will do a proper review, but suffice it to say, they are bad ass.

I am running 18/42 on the 120mm wheels.  It goes about 34 mph or so, which is great for a set up like this.

Settings I am rocking with (per VESC):

Motor max: 100amps
Motor min: -65 amps

Battery max: 55 amps
Battery min: -20amps

Once again, 10s6p 30q. 200kv @psychotiller 6369 Powerplants.

This feels awesome. The whole board rides like it was designed to be like this.  It feels like such a hybrid monster.  Rolls over everything and feels super secure for fast carving.  Truly it fits the namesake "City Slicker."

I am beyond happy with how it turned out.  Still kinda wish I did 12s6p.  But, I have no complaints at all.  She will still take off on you with the settings I have and mid 30s is a good top speed for this rig anyhow.

Thanks  Guys, and Happy Building!  Oh yeah, don't forget to enjoy riding too!

I'm very interested on your experience with PU & glass frit on this deck as I'm still planning to do the same. Looking forward to a full account of the operation with do's & dont's cause I'm afraid to fuck it up.

Uh, it feels good to have a build thread up!

Just went for a ride with my 5yo, Jackson, on the board with me!  We are enjoying some beers....(root beer for him).

His Star Board (build thread soon! 6s3p Dinghy) is waiting on a replacement Nano x remote (thanks @barajabali), so he is with me until that gets back in!

My only point of improvement, FUCK THESE PHILLIPS!  I already ordered some M3 socket bolts and fender washers so no biggie.  To be expected too, only thing I haven't lock tighted (tit?) yet. 

Help me decide:

Red Fender washers to match the motors or Gold fender washers to match the baseplate? Or both, alternating?

Don't mind the hott glue everwhere, I will tidy that up later, just wanna ride!

Battery currently not more then 50A/ESC(focboxes)

Esc wise for motor setting you won't ever be producing more wattage than a 13s setup at the maximum of the firmware amperage allows. Ie 120 motor amp Max and 170 abs Max unless you compile or convince ack to change it. So run whatever is safe for your motors. You've seen my duty cycle posts with effective wattage to the motors. And battery amps being the controlling factor to keeping it within the motor wattage limitations...

Oh snap, I have mine at 60amp/ per box..... though I don't hit that.  I do hit my motor max amps though...

![Screenshot_20180817-152947_ESC%20Monitor|243x500](upload://vkSaUbpwU2Us9FDUeNKZnSg6Bn2.jpg)

Could I hit you up whenever is convenient sometime to get schooled on this a bit?  I don't use wattage control at all.  

"Safe for my motors" is something I wonder about.  Stated specs are 65a, but I know they can handle more.

This is riding and accelerating hard on relatively flat terrain IIRC.

You have a LaCroix. I'm going to guess because I haven't read through.

LaCroix holds 60 cells and you used 30Q. You say 10s. Let's say the motors are rated for 2500 watts.

With the above info.

- Battery size 60 cells = 10*6p 
- Battery Constant Current = 20a(single cell rating) * 6P = 120A
- Max Battery A per ESC = 120A / 2esc = 60A per ESC
- Focbox traces and copper pours rated for 50A Constant Current
- Full Battery Voltage = 4.2v * 10S = 42v
- Nominal Battery Voltage = 3.6v * 10S = 36v
- Current drop off voltage aka healthy dead = 3.35 * 10s = 33.5v
- Motor Rating at Max Duty Cycle(0.95) and Full charge(not realistic) = 2500W/(42v * 0.95dc) = 62.7A~ _You fan see that this demand is already higher than your focbox max and max constant_
- Motor Rating at lower duty cycle with Max amperage possible in software(120A) = 2500W/120A = 20.83V/42v = 49% Duty Cycle _see last bullet for converting the same wattage to the battery side drain, ie the two are the same but at different voltage_

Ok so basically if your above 49% duty cycle you will never reach 120 motor amps. It will continually drop to not exceed battery amps. All of this is kind of fluxuating and partially relevant as the voltage sags and moves when you ride...

I'll be honest, I had to read this 5 times, but it makes sense.  Thanks for the knowledge, like always.  So up I go on my motor amps, and I will back down the battery max to 50.  You are the man!

@Sender. Slick af. Been waiting for this thread. Cool seeing a lacroix on thane. Very unique. Also, your batteries look really secure. Impressive. You're starting to become quite the esk8 craftsman. 
What's this berch weigh in at (approx)? What color frite you planning on top? 
Do the alternating gold and red (my vote). And try a dab of blue loctite on the mounting bolts.  Socket heads are the best imo.
So tits.

I will have to check on the weight.... but not light.  That wasn't even a consideration during the build TBH.

Big baseplates. Big Battery. Big urethane, and I use a lot of silicone, which isn't light either.

But IDGAF!!!! I hardly ever carry this thing.  I can't kill the battery! I mean, within reason. 30-35 miles.  

I will keep you posted on the glass.

I did some tests on some scrappish wood with 2 different water based polyurethane.  I really wasn't impressed.  Even with multiple coats, it never feels as locked in as the abuse I expect it to suffer.

I plan on using epoxy.  I have done epoxy tests that turned out great, but wanted to try polyurethane as thats what many (lhb) use.

Epoxy is more expensive and not as readily available for quality stuff, but it feels better to me.

Reading some of @longhairedboy older posts I seem to recall he had concerns with epoxy discoloration and potential breakdown from sunlight. I’m sure some of the higher end marine epoxy would be up to the job though. Maybe call the folks at FiberGlast and see if they have any recommendations...they gave me a helpful recommendation in the past on some composite repairs for a motorcycle.

Also, do a test on some nickel EVERY time you fire up the spot welder.  I just do a couple test welds everytime and tweak the pulse time to where it needs to be.  Generally between 15-25.  But always remember when you go from to nickel to steel or vice versa you will probably need to readjust

I've been preaching the gospel of Lacroix and SR RKPs all day 😀. 

Seriously, it's so smooth I can't even describe it. It rolls over stuff like numires.  You stand in the deck at a lower gravity than the base plates, this cause objects to roll under with much less impact force than if you were on top of the trucks. 

Combine that with the @psychotiller motors, which are incredible, Surf Rodz Rkps that she perfectly dialed in &18/40 gears and you have a weird ass hybrid Cadillac monster truck that just works. 

If @sender wasn't so damned big and can apperantly run 25 miles an hour I might have just ridden into the sunset 😀.

OMG WHY WHY ..THAT IS SWEET DUDE..I wanted one of these decks before and was gonna do the Trumpa with gear drives but then i seen the price..OMG thats is nasty.699 USD..but they are CANADIANS like me how can you charge USD doesn't make sense to me so I said fuck it.. I didn't get on the group buy didn't really know of it ..so I have been also thinking of building a deck as there is a deck building school here in Toronto. Thinking something like copy the Evo falcon with twin 30 degree and a built in enclosure like the haya or routed out for a slimmer case like hummie and routed like white pony does ..anyways looking for a smaller MTB style or like the atb urban or jacked up street Carver but I don't like a springy boards then I was looking at the moonshine elixer maybe do a mounting set up on the kicks...what do think of that..maybe a tryer outter but that is a pricey deck to fuck up if it sucks the big one..but now sender I see this and I think you just sold me on the AWD torquedrive LaCroix is now on dude..
 I can choose from 90 mm up to 150 mm I was told what do you think of those ideas boys ..been tripping all summer on it ..that is alot of coin for a deck but it sure is sweet as fuck ..should I try to build a Evo atb for half the price or just fuckn say cest ce fuck and get er done with the lacroix .. you two guy are gonna make me get some poutine and beaver tails sooner then I think..

Moonshine makes some reallly awesome decks, but definitely on the expensive side to just try out.  The Lacroix is really great, but without the group buy price is also pretty up there.  

I would go gear drive somehow over doing the AWD torque drives.  Cheaper, and huns can be a bitch to work on.  I think gear drive is better than direct drive, but thats just me.

But I also put two layers of epoxy on another Lacroix deck for @str8_Clutch so I can add glass frit.  ![20181006_081332|690x388](upload://xjn0yxu0im4sqO4zCxQmspm58F7.jpeg)

Thats great to know, nothing beats the feeling and sound of urthane on a smooth road. Plus you can slide out if needed and not worry about pumping them up or replacing. Guess ill have to try the hypas before, unfortunately, replacing the mbs trucks and pully setup( rpks are still out of stock). I do really like those superflys tho, i guess theres no way around at all using those with the mbs tho.. even if i got the right bearings(and possibly spacers, risers, etc) a wheel pulley just wouldnt work with those trucks would it, no matter the pulley design.. just keep thinking about the range with the DSS50 and 107mm wheels haha

It is raining all weekend here, so time for some improvements.  After I am done with the wheels, I am going to take off the hideous clear grip and add glass frit like my initial plan.

Another thing is I quickly changed the original gearing and settings for more speed.  I have been running 18/40 on 107s for the last couple months.  It hits about 35mph which is a great sweet spot IMO.

In order to keep that awesome torquey feel I have bumped up settings to:

Max motor.  90amps
Min motor. -65 amps

Batt max.   55 amps
Batt min.   -20 amps

(Per Vesc obviously).

I always wish I had just done 12s6p.  I could have fit that shit with a little creativity, but I opted for the easy 10s6p battery build at the time.  Oh well.

This is my mellow board, even though there is nothing particularly mellow about it.

I have some dope ass upcoming  builds that I can't wait to get started on with some amazing components.

-Ollin Recurve (so excited) from @chaka 
-Red Ember Xapham (a beaut!) From @treenutter 
-Secret unannounced project 😎 @chaka 

Some of the cool stuff going on these is:


@Kug3lis mini gear drive 
@torqueboards   4x4 DD 90kv

@Hummie hubs... maybe? 🙏🙏 

@moon gear drive on @psychotiller 6 shooters?!  

I am also shifting to using Ollin Vescs.  They are bomber. Look amazing (even in the enclosure), and they are made right here in the USA in small batches.  That shit gets me excited.

Also have some builds for friends I am getting to take on which is nice.  I get to play with other peoples' money, YAY!

A friend's wife gave a $2000 budget to build something "off roadish."  Cool thing is, I get full creative license.  I already have mucho ideas!  

I also want to do a smaller travel board maybe with a single Ollin drive on Ronins.


So much stuff to be psyched on!  Not to mention I am hoping to get a lot more deck/enclosure skinning projects in the future to hone my skills with.


Damn,  love this stuff!

@Sender has a pretty big aluminum heatsink in the base of the enclosure that the FocBoxes sit on. That and the gearing he uses probably works for the lower temp. Although his gearing is pretty aggressive for thane. 

Get a piece of 3/8 aluminum and use me screws and thermal tape to secure the FocBoxes to the aluminum and you'll see a drop in Temp. Not sure how much but it's likely significant.

I like the Lacroixs too much ... especially the new ones that have a cool little detail about the DIY kits......

So dope.  Sorry @arch if I wasn't suppose to share the pic, it is just so damn pretty! 

I will do some different color glass frit in this one though.

And it will be 12s6p pr 13s6p.

We shall see what fits, I already have BMSs for both, so either way.

Also cut it down and make a La Croix ‘shorty’....at least 

The carbon undertray could also be shortened and skinned you have the skills bud

Rebrand as the Lemonade, that’s what you make lemons from

I will take some pictures in a bit.


As far as I can tell though, it is just both motors and the actual deck that are tucked.  Everything else SEEMS fine upon inspection.

Bear with me here but that RKP sale claims a 45° plate baseplate. Isn't that a bit steep to add to an angled nose or is 45 a standard ish degree for a flat deck ?
```

## \#134 Posted by: Sender Posted at: 2019-02-13T22:44:59.247Z Reads: 153

Absolutely it is. That would be about 75 degrees front and rear, no good.

With the adjustable rkp baseplates you can go 0-65 degrees.


So if you set them to "15"  on a lacroix 30 degree nose, you get about 45 degrees in the end.

You get increments of 5 more or less

Hmm that's disheartening for the mtb build as the rkp adjustable plates seem pretty rare. The 35° would work with my 15° tip deck though. I shot them a message seeing if they would swap for an up charge. Might just end up throwing them on the hummie, thanks for the info. I guess I could dewedge a bit and ride high.

So we are trying to get a big group buy together soon for the RKP adjustable baseplates so Surf Rodz will resume production.

HOWEVER, an adjustable  TKP baseplate group buy is in the works in the near future. 

These also enable cool setups like on this Lacroix (one I built for a friend)
