Hello,
I am brand new to the idea of building an electric skateboard. There aren't many people their who give enough information about this,
SO I NEED HELP,
I want to build an electric skateboard that will go around 15-20 miles and around 20 mph which is around 24 to 32km and 32kmh. Also need a decent amoount of torque because i do have hills in my area.
The parts I was thinking to use was:
- Turningy SK3 192Kv motor
-SKYRC Toro TS 150A ESC Brushless Sensored ESC for 1/8 OR Rotostar 150A
- Hobbyking GT2B controller
-Turningy 2x 6s li po to get 10000mAh (would that be enough for range?????)
If anyone could help me please respond. 

Thanks
```

Some people might think that "programming" means writing in code, you do not need to know any code to use the VESC.

if you're planing on conquering several hills , 6S may have limited amount of juice . i.m using space cell 10s li ion and going up and down again and again , and multiple braking to avoid phone~clicking zombies got me about 11km estimated . also need to consider your weight and of course 2 motors are better than 1 if you're living in hilly areas .

I see, my weight i would say is like 40kg , on the flats do you reckon one motor would struggle and also do you have VESC and what setup u gt at the moment

got to be honest... 6s is enough.  I know these guys are rolling over right now but if you want to keep it cheap. 6s is fine.

if you say 40kg , then 6s would be just fine . i was imagining you double that weight .

also 1 motor is enough for you . dont worry . once your single motor eboard is up and running , you will know if you need a second motor to power you up the hills .

forget what i said  abt the nun chuck . better go get gt2b .

me ? my set up is 80% ready made . all i have to do is wire it up and place everything in its proper place and its good to go . all the measurements ; welding , all the parts are pre assembled . i ordered the full dual diagonal kit . only the 43in long deck i got from local singapore shop . wheels are 90mm diameter .
