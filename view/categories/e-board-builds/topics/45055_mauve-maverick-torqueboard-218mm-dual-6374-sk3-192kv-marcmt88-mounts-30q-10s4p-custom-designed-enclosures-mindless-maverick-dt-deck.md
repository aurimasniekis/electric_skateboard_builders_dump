My brother is designing some battery enclosures for me, they aren't finished yet but this is how they look so far:

Very pleased with them! I did a test print yesterday and they match the concave of the board perfectly. They fit two 4p packs in each so will have 5 on the board + a different enclosure for other electronics.

I'm planning to use the board for commuting with. It's 10 miles each way along a very flat and smooth cycle path that runs along a guided bus route, which should be a good place to e-skate.

I'm just about to start purchasing parts so please let me know if I've got something wrong!

Are you sure u need so much power? :) 
Not sure if you will fit two SK3 motors on one truck...they are wider than normal 6374 motor...

I could get probably get away with less power yes. I decided I would prefer to build once and take it easy as I grow into the board rather than having to upgrade components later, I don't intend to use all the power available to me to start with and will tune the board down to match my experience.

Check out [this thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/want-to-run-dual-sk3-6374s-on-torqueboards-218mm-trucks-try-these/36641/18). With 218mm trucks and marcmt88 mounts they fit.

Yeah, they will fit.  Just make sure you dry fit everything and that the hanger clam is equal distance from the end on both sides.  You may have to trim the motor shaft a bit.  Good looking build.

Will do, I'll have my dremel ready in case trimming is needed :).
