Hello,

This is my first build and i have selected the following parts. My main concern is the compatability between the speed control module, motor and battery. Please let me know what you think!

This looks compatible so far. You need some xt90 anti sparks to make your loop key. You also need a battery charger and a connector to join together the balance wires.

I do have an imax b6 charger I can use. 
Wont the switch on the esc module act as an anti spark? Did you mean a xt60 key?

Also, the max output for the ESC module is 1300 watts for each motor, but the motors are rated for 2200watts will this be a problem?

We usually use the xt90 for a key instead of the xt60 just because it's more robust and the antispark function. It's good to have a physical disconnect even if the ESC has an e-switch, both for safety and since even in "low power" mode it'll still draw some power.

Ok, that makes sense
Also, do I need a BMS system?
