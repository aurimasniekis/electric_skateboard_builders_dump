I want to get 3 batterys in series. so first i will Change connections from the 5.5mm bullet to xt90 with some soldering and also and also change Focbox to xt90. (So it would handle higher currents)
Then I will use the 2 adapters to make a series connection, 

I have a longboard if trucks don't work with mount ill get caliber trucks i bought 90mm flywheels for easy pulley system and higher top speed.

Is there anything wrong with the build i'm planning I wan't to buy soon.

Parallell only change Ah, not voltage. You will need to put them in series.

also and also change Focbox to xt90. (So it would handle higher currents)
[/quote]


Focbox is meant for 60a continuous.  Putting a xt90 would mean your connector can handle up to 90a however the focbox won't change.  But if all you are using is xt90 to connect everything that's fine.   Your charger probably has xt60 so u will need to make an adapter.

You need to spend a month reading first.  If you connect lipos wrong even for a split second you will burn the house down.  Lithium-ion would be safer, but not safe, for you to use

yes, what you have listed here will work. 

but like the others are saying, make sure you do a lot more reading before you start wiring things. The last thing you want is a shorted lipo.

and this for antispark loop key. unless you use a antispark switch or a BMS

No reason to change each battery to XT90. The bullet connectors allow you to put each battery in series directly. Then make a single 5mm bullet to XT90 adapter for the effective 9s battery

My Balance charger only allows 6s, 

MY charging plan was to Unplug Put each cell in Li-PO bag and charge 1 by 1,

Is that a bad idea?

## \#38 Posted by: Grozniy Posted at: 2018-01-06T12:33:10.991Z Reads: 99

not bad just takes longer. if its 6s you can charge 2 at the same time and the last one separately.

I spend a lot of time at home and It rains a lot in Ireland, I also feel like If BMS fails and Li-Po explodes the deck is good Firewood XD,

If the risk is not to high,
I might upgrade to BMS

Wait can you add a button if you use a bms? how?  I suspect it won't work if you use a bms only for charging, but how does it work
