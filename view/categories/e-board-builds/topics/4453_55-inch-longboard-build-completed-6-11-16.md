I've been thinking lately how cool it would be to build a real E-Longboard. This is gonna be awesome!
You must post a video of you first ride on the boardwalk.

Protect your batteries.  My longest board is 42" truck to truck and I have high centered on curb transitions to parking lots and the occasional buckle in the pavement.

It might be worth it to consider a battery pack at each end tucked right up near the truck and leave the center of the board unfettered.

If you guys get a chance to ride a deck this big...I tell you..it's pretty freaking cool....I threw some spare trucks on them and took a ride...def something to consider...as long as you don't mind lugging this thing around...it's like carrying a door lol. 

But once on the ground...the mass just keeps you moving when you push...you can feel it

These have adjustable hole for those situations when your VESCs are like steamed broccoli :sunglasses:

I bought one of them as well - just don't like the height too much. 6cm is quite a lot especially when you can go much flatter with a VESC. 4cm seems like a nice compromise but so far only an old Tupperware box my mom gave me had that height.
A 2-3cm enclosure would be awesome for 18650 and a VESC.

And only 1000% more to ship since my nearest IKEA is like 50 miles away. Good news it that it costs $10 to ship 1 of them or 10 of them, so for $20, you could have enclosures for life, and it still works out to $2 a pop.

@Michaelinvegas Great job, yet again! Makes me want to put my 46" back together with one of those boxes and some sweet lighting. That's awesome that the boxes are translucent too. Gonna get me a few of them. You just painted the sides black, and left the bottom white, correct?

And I'm sure you probably posted it somewhere that I missed, but do you have links for those lights you used? I especially like the super stealth headlight.

Yeah I painted it black on the sides to mask the light...the left it white on the bottom to direct it down on the ground... Looks better at night and black is so slimming when you look at it...


I can't find the eBay listing for the RGB LEDs 

But you need to get this 

https://www.ebay.com/itm/391000880573 

This is RF ...some come with infrared and that don't work unless ur inside...

You can use any light...as long as you can stick it in the riser..

If not just put them on like my other build with a small clamp from home deposit lol

Hey, I'm trying to figure out my gearing for my 270kv 6s build, and I wanted to ask what you though of your 14/36? do you have enough torque for a standing stop, how much do you weigh and hows the top speed?

Never start your board from a stand still unless you have it rigged as sensored motor

Yeah, shipping. I've got about $40 worth of various trays in my IKEA cart, including 10 Stodja's so I can justify the shipping cost and have cheap enclosures for all kinds of experimenting.
