My friends are laughing at me for my poor choice of boxes to store ESC and batteries.. they call it Tupperware :D
Not that I mind much but still wondering where do you guys get your boxes from? I could not find a good pelican style / tool box / waterproof / ABS plastic box that is good enough and won't break my heart when I drill it with my Dremel for cutting wire holes.  

My current setup for reference

@jazzcool keep rocking the Tupperware! Scuff it with 600 grit sand paper and spray paint it matte black.

Or paint it, but leave some clear areas in a pattern or logo, and throw some led's in there.

I had a VESC box printed out.. but it was really small for my needs and everything was cramped inside.
