I feel like I've said this a lot lately, but I don't typically post build threads anymore unless its something unique.  The last 2 builds have been pretty unique.

This build has been dubbed "Hazard" because of the grip & speed, plus it lulls you into a sense of comfort and then you realize your going 35 mph...and that can be hazardous :metal:. 

This is not the first time I've built on 80 +/- mm platform, but its the first time that I've felt it was successful.  These wheels...mutha f#$%er, I don't know where to start.  They roll over debris like 100mm wheels, they are very cushy, soak up a lot of vibration, at 77mm wide they grip like glue.  Excellent wheels.  

I really hope hummie gets an 83/77mm Centrax wheel with a usable core, its a game changer.  I even have a set on one of my push boards.

On to the build pr0n!

Here's the build sheet, If anyone wants links or whatever, just let me know.

![hazard-%20build%20sheet|659x500](upload://6XujK5TB9XaIcSiSyiqkGTNdxuf.jpeg) 

This is a screen shot of the spreadsheet I use to define performance values.  It's not perfect, but I have tweaked it to my personal results and preferences.  I'm not sure about the range estimate though.  I rode 9 miles last night, had 75% battery left.  I'm using a gear ratio of 1:1 so that may need to be adjusted.

![hazard-%20esk8%20data|690x456](upload://qd9QccHMX2kyRQar4HB3kAfKOzS.jpeg) 

Im running 60a motor & 40a battery and this thing hits 35 mph with my fat ass on it, so I am hesitant to up the motor amps to 100a.  I am running sensorless FOC & set the switching frequency to 30,000 KHz per @hummie's advice and it is quiet, so very quiet.  This is the stealthiest board I've ever built.

The last thing I want to talk about, the power switch.  I didn't get a very pic of it.  But if you look at the last of the build pics you can see it in the side of the board towards the rear.  I stole that idea from @bigben.  I'll post a better pic of the switch later.

Its a 10mm switch, I used a 10mm bit from the outside, just barely angled up until I had a slot all the way through into the enclosure.  I filled the slot with epoxy and taped it off until it cured. I know that switch isn't coming out with anything but a drill :slight_smile:.

I have, I had some issues getting the brakes just right.  At -20a they are just too soft, so I kept bumping it up (or rather down) and finally just put it at -60a and its a little hard now but I like hard brakes.  After I get some ride time in Im gonna bump the motor to 100a and see what it can do, but I imagine it will be too much for me.  I hit 35 mph last night and still had throttle left.

Lovely build. I've been trying to search for @Hummie decks because I like the look of them so much (already looking at build 2 when build 1 is finishing up). Does he/she have a site? Also what do you like about that hoyt Puck remote? Their site gives no info about features/why it's on the pricier end.

Thank you :).  @Hummie does most of his selling here on the forum, you can PM him for specifics as he is great about answering questions.  

These decks, I have 2, are in my top 10 now.  The concave is a little mild for me, but its very comfortable.  The drop is perfect, just behind and below the base plate when drop mounted. 

The Hoyt Puck is my new favorite remote, performance wise.  I cannot say about longevity as I've only had it for a couple of weeks.  Its got a really long travel, so speed control is greatly increased over most other available remotes.  The construction is very solid.  I've had one disassembled and its pretty genius the way they built it.  Its just all around 'tight' for lack of a better word.  The only complaint I have is the interface of the wheel pin to the pot is a little weak, but a drop of epoxy and that problem is gone.

So -60 motor, what about regen?

How smoothe is the startup on FOC sensorless?

I second this for sure.  However, Hoyt is now reinforcing said piece with epoxy before shipping, so it should be of absolutely no concern!

I've got regen at 40a per FocBox, 80a battery max total.  I thought about upping it a little to see if that changed brake performance, but honestly I'm pretty happy with the brakes now and don't like to throw more amps at the pack than it can handle.

Startup is great with sensorless FOC, its just like it has sensors.  That being said, if you pointed slightly uphill and just stand and hit the trigger, you have to hit it pretty good or it just stutters.  I kick off most of the time anyways, it takes more juice to get those first few RPM's than almost anything else, so saves a lot of battery.

Yup, this is how they are reinforcing the prongs.  It is exactly what I did on mine.

It would be fine without it, but it is a good place to add a bit of robustness.

I've built a couple of eMTB's and they are just not for me.  I hate it too because I really like building them.  This is probably the best thane build I have right now, I love it.  I doubt I'll ever get away from 6 shooters, but I like having thane too.  

This one is, unintentionally, very stealth as far as it being electric.  I mean with the grip you can see it a mile off, but other than the glow from the switch and volt meter you really have to look hard to see its powered.  I like that too :slight_smile:.

See, the issue is that i completely understand that. eMTB's are super capable and are like the trucks of esk8s, they take a beating and so anything you need them to, but Builds like this or some with the Evo are just more classic of a skate. You hop on those and cruise and enjoy it, whereas a eMTB just has something lacking in that division. 
As for building, eMTBs are so forgiving and you can just cram them with batteries, electronics, and other fun stuff. Everything else you need to be meticulous and crafty

The thing I can't get used too or comfortable with is the height plus turning radius on an eMTB.  I've come too the conclusion that I like carves better than speed or off-road capability.  Also, my bludgeon with 6 shooters has been in the mid a couple of times, not deep or fast, but it was fun and it is doable.

I meant to mention, the Paris 195 v2's that @Hummie is using are surprisingly carvy and stable, even at speed.  I hit 35 mph last night and had zero wobble on good asphalt.  I didn't stay there long because it was dark, but I have  a lot of confidence in it.   

When @Hummie starts building for the kickstarter I'm gonna crack him about a thaneless set at a lower KV and figure out how to get 6 shooters on there.  I think I can do a little mill work on a set of 6er's and a little welding and make it happen pretty easy.

I appreciate it.  I would encourage anyone to get hummie hubbs.  I actually did the math.

> x2 motors = $180.00
> x2 motor mounts = $120.00
> x2 motor pulleys = $10.00
> x4 belts (x2 extras) = $12.00
> x2 wheel pulleys = $60.00
> x1 wheels (x4) = $80.00
> x1 trucks (x2) = $50.00
> Total = $512.00 + Shipping

This is just average to low end pricing on the individual components, not even close to the quality you CAN get.  Hummie Hubbs are actually economical, especially for the quality.

itd be nice to see what kv they are on the bldc tool.  there was a bit of variance but it could only come from the rotor side as the stator side is like a clone at 9 turns on each motor.  maybe a bit less glue giving a bigger airgap, or magnets a bit overhanging the stator teeth,  I wonder.

Great build. Loves the grip tape. I only taped the front and back where I put my feet. And the CF glossy in the middle looks gorgeous. 

Are you sure you hit 35? I checked the kv last week, it's on spec 75kv ish. 13s put me at 32mph top at 52-53v haven't went full throttle at full charge yet. Would be nice to see some telemetry.

Wheels are definitely great. I would say I have put on 2-300 miles, no chip at square edge at all. 

So you are at -20 batt min for brake? I'm @ -12 and they are strong as hell. I get wobble and thrown ofd if I full brake at speed. On the other hand. I recommend switching custom bushings and pivot cup. The stock ones are too soft.

I still had throttle left. I wasn't watching the speed, that's the top speed reported by the app.

I wonder what the difference is?  -12 is usually where I start testing at, that was so light it was scary for me. I assumed it would be close and had to foot brake down hill at 20 mph ðŸ˜€.

Yeah, I usually spend a couple of weeks dialing in my bushings. It's been awhile since I've ridden Paris 195s but I still like them, way more that C2s.

That 35 could be from you spinning it with motors off the ground. it reads 36-37 for me when I do that. I guess I have never tested full brake at 20mph down a hill lol. That sounds hella dangerous to me.

I don't really do that, I'm not a fan of bench tests or letting motors run crazy, always a load. 

At -20 my brakes are pretty good, gradual and not locked. At -12 it barely slowed. 

I'm thinking my kv may be higher, that might account for the speed. The @Ackmaniac so is reporting 88kv for the motor attached to the FOC box I have the BT module on. I'll check it in the VESC tool later this week.

I typically use a throttle curve to control the acceleration. I am in this instance as well. It's smooth, but different than a belt drive. 

I really need more ride time before I can reliably compare it to belt drive, gear drive, etc.

Dear Mr Bearded Angel,

   Just wondering what it would take for you to give up your day job?

   Do you take trade-ins? :wink:

Beautiful build mate...can @sender fly a drone with camera or vice versa....

You must have a room filled with your boards cause it seems like you are always building. How is that Luna switch. I saw it and that it could be a good switch figuring a ebike would pull more amps than a board.

I have a stack of decks and boxes of parts, it's a little ridiculous ðŸ˜€. 

I had high hopes for the luna AS switch, but I had 1 die on me the other day. I have pretty much given up in AS switches, I rely on XT90-S loop keys for the most part.

Loop keys donâ€™t fail or atleast at a lot less of a rate. I like the look of a button or switch but I want reliability. Maybe the unity will change that just have to wait and see what everyone says

Yeah, I agree. Loop keys wear out but they rarely fail. I like the ease of an actual seitch and the backlit switches look cool. But as an industry we just aren't there yet unfortunately.

Have you tried the BKB AS switch? They will be on sale for BF and they have an instant replace warranty... Wonder how good they are.

P. S. @mmaner please remember to print my xt90 pieces! :grimacing:

You guys have to stop doing these hummie based builds, makes me want one, that grip tape is sick, really like the contradiction in that, the stealthiest build possible wire a really eye catching design

Looking forward to the telemetry with the hubs, did you do any range test?

I've never done a bushing setup that was perfect the 1st time, but I think this may be it. 

![IMG_20181122_170923_1542928704032|690x370](upload://AfelA8GGHBzHhTm5nEDd1lbFViw.jpeg) 

Board Side Front > Riptide Krank 96a Barrel
Street Side Front > Riptide APS 92.5a Cone
Board Side Rear > Riptide Krank 96a Barrel
Street Side Rear > Riptide Krank 93a Barrel

I used a cupped washer on rear board side, flat washer on rear street side, cupped washers front both sides. 

It's incredibly carvy, like TKP carvy.  I only got to mph in this run but there was no sign of wobble.  I'll hit some smooth asphalt tomorrow or Saturday when I'm all padded up and can peg the throttle and get some metrics.

@Alphamail do you see anything that could be better, wrong or that needs changing?

This is my bushing setup

[quote="mmaner, post:78, topic:75472"]
Board Side Front &gt; Riptide Krank 96a Barrel
Street Side Front &gt; Riptide APS 92.5a Cone
Board Side Rear &gt; Riptide Krank 96a Barrel
Street Side Rear &gt; Riptide Krank 93a Barrel

To mount the enclosure I used 4mm inserts with 4mm socket button head bolts and stainless fender washers.

Why is quiet a thing?  I love the fact my latest thing screams.  Seriously on full strap it sounds like twin turbines are having a party back there.  Why is quiet better?
