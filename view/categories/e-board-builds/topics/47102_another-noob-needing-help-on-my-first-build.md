Hey guys, so I have a couple questions regarding my first build. 1. I plan on getting a good VESC, will there be any parts (Battery, motor) that wont be compatible with that? In other words, what should I look out for when trying to piece together the pulley, VESC, motor and batteries. 2. I weigh 225 lbs, 6'.0".  Will a single motor pull me fine? Sorry for the noob questions and I would really appreciate any help at all, feel free to link parts to me or even a build you'd like me to check out, thank you.

Get a good VESC, a 6374 190kv motor, 10s/5p 30q battery, use 15/36 gearing...you'll be fine.

Thank you, what VESC would you recommend? Also I see you're an engineer, cool! I am a first year mechanical engineering student.

I would get a FocBox, but they are backordered for now.  Failing that you can talk to @stewii or @bimmer and get a VESC6 or talk to @torqueboards and get a VESC4.  WIth the load and a single motor I would prolly get a VESC6 and run Hybrid Mode (FOC up to 7k ERPM) then BLDC).

I've got almost 100lbs on you and I'm 7" taller but I've ridden single 6355 builds perfectly fine. 6374 with the battery and gearing @mmaner suggested would make you think it's too fast on your first ride.

Thanks, both of you! I'm glad to hear that, I will probably go with the 6374 motor, would https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I1WDZ7Y/ref=ox_sc_mini_detail?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ABCX2RE03ARTE <- these wheels suffice? Also one more question for you guys, what gear/pulley and motor mount would you guys recommend for this build? @Battosaii @mmaner

Hmm as far as wheels, those are not very good and will probably end up in some corner somewhere unused after you realize how bad they suck lol. There are many good wheels options like Flywheels(best) Popocas (really good) kegels(good). As far as gearing I have a strange set up so you may want to go with something more simple. You want 15mm wide pullies and belts as far as where to get them I think @mmaner will have a better idea.

Thanks for the reply! I will have to take the hit I think on the wheels for now anyways, the board is going to be pretty expensive so far so I think getting cheaper wheels would be right cut to make.

These are some simple and cool mounts.  In fact, check out the whole site. He has a lot of great stuff.  He is even on the forums! @JLabs 

I am working on a build for my 5 year old and wife with his bad ass mounts and one of his 6374 190kv motors right now!  (Well, I'll use this mini thrasher as well TBH)... OH YEAH, and beer. Never forget Beer.

I’d suggest getting a mount that has an idler pulley to help prevent the belt from skipping since you’re only running a single motor.

I personally use the first one from @marcmt88 and I like it.  I’m sure @Boardnamics mount would be a good option too.

Maytech VESC's are crap, do not buy that especially if running a single motor. Amps will kill it. 

I would go to at least 90mm wheels.  The mount @sender linked is a good one, I've got 4 of them. In fact you can get wheels, pulley, belt, motor, etc from the same place. 

@JLabs, link this cat some gear 😀

Thanks for all your help man I really appreciate it, I did not know how complicated it would be to build! Would you mind if I rapid fire some questions at you real quick? Could you link me a good $80-$100 VESC? what other connections/wires would I need to buy? and would you suggest me to just get the batteries and sauter them all together in series? Id rather get like two zippy batteries, but im no expert.
 and what kind of charger/remote would you recommend? I'd really appreciate you answering these million questions :joy:

The DIYE motor mount has been hit or miss for some.  For me, it’s been great.  I’ve used it on 2 builds with out any issues.  However, it has shifted slightly with some abuse and vibration.  I’ve added some gaffer tape to the truck where the d clamp of the mount will sit.  Now, it’s solid!  Unfortunately, movement with any mount is inevitable and the very best way to avoid this would be to have the clamp welded to the truck.

If you are looking to spend a bit more cash the Ollin Board and FOCBOXs are of the highest quality currently.  But if you want something between the Maytec and the pricey FOCBOX, I have found that Miami Electrics VESC work great even under high amps and heat.  I’m not quite sure where the bones of ME’s VESCs come from (could be Maytech) but there is a fat ass heat sink right on top of the mosfets.  I live in Vegas and in the summer it gets hot as shit which will effect the temperature of the VESC.  In addition to that I have larger 97mm wheels, love going up hills hard, and have high amperage Lipos.  All of these factors would have killed a Maytec VESC under hot conditions.  But, I’ve gone a whole year with it never shutting down.  LOL, sorry for the rant but for $110 I feel like the ME VESC is a total underdog.

The TB VESC is $99

If you buy the motor from @torqueboards you wont have to change the bullet connectors,

Look at this thread for a ton of info on Lipo's, @Namasaki knows his stuff.

Is this topic still alive? If so, greetings everyone :slight_smile:

I’m total noob but quick learner looking for professional’s advices to build evolve GT AT looking, DIY. I read every single "read first" threads of this forum before posting the question, I got lots of insight, but not sure exactly how can I select parts of board at this beginner level, which components are compatible etc. Is this right address to look for help?

Cheers
