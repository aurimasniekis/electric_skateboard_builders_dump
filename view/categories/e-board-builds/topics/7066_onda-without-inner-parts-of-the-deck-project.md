I'm aware that Onda board might be not the best solution.

Already had a chance to show you what I've been up to this [Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTLUJ2vuB6w) The new Spine is the fastest model that has been built so far at Faraday Motion and this lead us to something different. We started with the deck from Onda, the Core, but its not so good for several reasons. The inner part of the deck is full of plastic (and could be used for electronics and batteries). We made pink prototype of board without all plastic hidden underneath but it is not enough. 

We have started using a 4x4cm aluminium  profile also being used for making custom 3D printers and CNC machines, as a foundation for the frame. On top of this we will design some 3d printed modules to add on top of the frame construction.

What is the ride quality like? Does it handle curbs and cracks in pavement well? :slight_smile:
