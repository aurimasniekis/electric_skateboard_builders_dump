I ran across these wheels today and I'm curious if they would work as a replacement for tires with tubes. Anyone know how stiff these are and if they have good rolling resistance?

For this price I would stick with actually pneumatics for better ride quality, air is air ;)

Yea but they are the same price as a tire and tube combo. This would also prevent pinched tubes and punctures causing a flat tire. My only concern is the rolling resistance and ride.
