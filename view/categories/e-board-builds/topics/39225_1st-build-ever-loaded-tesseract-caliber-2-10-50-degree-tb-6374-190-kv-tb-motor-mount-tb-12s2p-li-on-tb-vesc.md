Some people had issues running FOC with the TB VESC. But a few managed to set it up correctly and have no issues.
There is a sale on Monday for FOCBOX vesc that are more reliable for running FOC. They'll be only $97, might be worth waiting and buying them then.

if you use TB VESC, don't run FOC.

I've run FOC on a TB VESC, but not at 12s. I know several people that have blown them that way. I would wait and get a FOCbox for the same price, much better option

Wow guys! Thanks for the fast responses. 

I will change the VESC to a FOCBOX on that sale on monday.

Since I'm going to be ordering from enertion, how does the TB nano compare to the enertion nano-x?
