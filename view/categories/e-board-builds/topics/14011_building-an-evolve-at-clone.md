Hi, newbie here! 
I've been reading up on electric skateboards and longboards for the past few months both here, there and everywhere, and I've gotten to the point of wanting to get a longboard of my own. 
I'll add a tl;dr at the bottom, this could be a bit of a read.     
I really like what I've seen of the evolve bamboo AT, with its offroad(ish) tires and good power and range. That $1500 price is a sticking point though, mainly because of some of the flaws I've read about the board. For that kind of money, it is reasonable to expect to have at least some rain resistance, right?
So I'm trying to figure out if I can build a board as good or better for the same price.
I have done a bit of snowboarding, and I'm part of a maker community and love to tinker and build stuff, so I've no real problem building my own.      
I weigh 67kg, so in descending order here is what I want from my board:  
Comfortable ride/easy handling
Good range      
Good torque/hill climbing     
Decent speed 

Given my weight and ride requirements, I'm hoping to start with just one motor, and upgrade to two sometime later on. 
I'm also hoping to be able to make some sort of modular add-ons later, such as lights, but that's not important right now.
I'm not planning on doing any kind of fancy tricks. Just cruising around the city and some light offroading on dirt and gravel trails.   
I think I have enough info to make an intelligent choice of motors and electronics, but  I'm really not sure which deck and trucks to get, despite having read what I can on this site. 
I would like to use trampa 7 or 8 inch tires, and
I'm assuming that I'll want to use trampa trucks and motor mounts as well, but since this won't be a mountainboard I'm not sure what the right choice is. I don't feel the need for a fancy carbon deck, just something simple and solid, preferably a good blank deck I can add my own graphics to. 
Any suggestions? 


Tl;dr - trying to make an evolve bamboo GT (with the tires) clone that is as good or better for the same price or less, 1000-1500 dollar budget maximum.  
I especially need recommendations of the board, trucks, tires and motor mount.
Here's what I'm looking at right now:
Trucks:

Or: 
http://www.trampaboards.com/trampa-skate-truck--with-12mm-hollow-or-solid-axle--powdercoated-red-or-blue-with-black-trims-p-11145.html
Wheels:
http://www.trampaboards.com/8-inch-wheel--matt-black-hypa-hub-with-trampa-treads-8-inch-tyre-p-575.html
Deck:
http://www.skateshred.com/index.php/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/48-x-9-5-double-kick-dancer-canadian-maple-cm48.html
or anything of similar design. 
No idea which motor mounts to use, the trampa ones don't seem to work with the trucks. Any and all help is appreciated!

I'd stick with the Trampa trucks. The sidewinders are a bit sketch at high speeds. For decks, it's better to have something more stiff than a dancer. If you want flex, you'll need to split your enclosures. So batteries at one end, electronics on the other. If you go for a stiff board, you're fine with a standard enclosure. 

Have you checked out Trampa's motor mount/truck/motor/pulley kits? You can slap those onto a regular deck and be good to go.

Thanks!
I have checked the trampa kits, they all seem to need at least a 15 degree mounting angle, so I'd need some kind of wedge. I just found dinodave's build, which is actually pretty close to what I have in mind:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/all-terrain-flat-deck-loaded-fattail-deck-mbs-matrix-pro-ii-trucks-mbs-wheels-dual-ollin-170kv-custom-mount-8s-vesc/7419
Is this deck better for that?
https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/blank-skateboards-h1-natural-longboard-deck-10x40.5
Has anyone here heard of 99factory? https://99factory.com If so does anyone know what they charge for a custom job?
Since it looks like I'll try to put wedges in, is it worth getting mountain trucks? It sounds like they're easier to adjust for firm or soft steering, not to mention shock absorption. Or will the tires alone be enough for that?
I should explain, this will likely be my only all-out board build, so I want to make it as "modular" and adjustable as possible, so I can grow into it and improve it along the way.

Yup, hard bushing will solve the stability issue but your turning radius goes up. I had an Gen2 Evolve and I was constantly swapping bushing depending on how I was planning to ride. Not hard to do, but kind of a pain. I liked how they rode with soft bushings. Feels like you're surfing on the streets. Hard bushings, not so much.

I have my CGT bushings set pretty loose and I have had absolutely zero speed wobbles issues. I am also running bigger motor pulleys so my top speed is higher than stock, still blasting down the streets at max speed.

I'm looking forward to seeing how this build progresses. I just cancelled my evolve GT order to go for the DIY route, since I would've probably voided the warranty in a heartbeat anyways. Better to save a bit of money and avoid all the remote hassles. 

I think I'll be building something similar myself. I'll let you know how it goes.

Thanks, I'd love to compare notes!
I want to make sure I have space to change out different size tires, between say 6-8 inches max. Not that I'll be doing that a lot, but it's easier to switch out a set a of tires than a whole board.

[/quote]

Not so sure about that. Here's a rough sketch of my build:

* 2 OllinBoard VESCs: $350
* 2 OllinBoard 5065s: $200 (http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/)
* Hi5ber Makako: $250 (http://www.hi5ber.com/makako)
* Psychotiller Enclosures: $100 (http://psychotiller.com/products/shop/enclosures)
* Mounts, Gears, Pulleys: $150
* Trucks: $150 
* Battery with BMS: $400
* Remote, Switch, and Misc Wiring: $150
* Wheels: $100
Total: $1850

The above amounts to a little savings, actually. Add in the fact that I have half of the above parts already, and it's quite a substantial savings! Then, of course, there's the GT Carbon remote issues I won't have to deal with. 

Of course, I generally agree with the sentiment. Going the DIY route to save a few bucks is not good idea imho.

I have a carbon GT and have had no issues at all. With my gen 2 or the GT. Found evolve to be extremely reliable and great customer service. at least here in Australia.
However, thats not why I build!
Love my custom boards just as much.

Reliability depends a lot where you ride. I had a Gen2 and my remote was constantly dropping. I sent it back to Evolve a couple times and it worked perfectly fine on their end. I relocated their antenna and receiver per their videos and it improved the connection, but it still wasn't great. I sold it to a guy who live far out from the city.

So I wrote to the guys at Trampa, explaining what I wanted to do, and pointed to @dinodave's build as an example. Here's how it went:
*** 
 thanks for the quick response.
My intent is to use a fairly flat wooden deck, since I prefer the "classic" look. I was inspired by this guy's DIY build:

                  All terrain flat deck | Loaded Fattail Deck | MBS 
Matrix Pro ii trucks | MBS wheels | Dual Ollin 170kv | Custom mount | 8S
 | VESCAs you mentioned, he does indeed use wedges to put the trucks at the proper angle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 I was hoping to do something similar. There are several fairly easy 
biking trails in my area, some asphalt, others are dry loose dirt. I 
wouldn't mind using 7 inch tires if I thought they could handle it, but 
since that's questionable I'd prefer to use tires with more tread. In 
short, I'd like to be prepared for anything, but I also would like to 
save a bit of money where I can (without being cheap and skimping on 
quality, of course). Do I understand correctly that the main problem is clearance between the board and the wheels? Thank you again  


------- 8:28 PM (1 hour ago)to me HI ---------,
    no mate... its not going to work... ur ride height will be so far
      off the ground, i would not recommend it...
    and adding the sort of wedges you are thinking about, i would not
      recommend this either mate...
    Unless your mounted at 25-30º ur wasting your time and money
      bro... 
    and im sorry but it seems your off on a trip thats so far away
      from what i can offer you, as i am so short of time it seems
      pointless advising from here...
    I wouldnt add the spring trucks to a longboard deck.... and
      currently longboard trucks are not wide enough to fit our hubs
      onto in order to fit the 7 inch wheels.....
Regards
***
I realize that the folks at Trampa might see this, and I am not trying to cause an argument. 
However, since it seems that it in fact IS possible to do this to some degree, I want to know if anyone else out there has tried?
What where your results and conclusions?

Well it sure worked well for me! I honestly have no idea why more people aren't making these sorts of builds. I went on a 29km ride the other day over an hour and a half (average 20kph). Gravel paths, paved roads, up and down curbs, over grassy areas, stoney areas, sandy areas, no problems. The high ride height poses no issues, and the wedges are rock solid.

I'm going to be building a new Trampa based similar board in the new year, so looking forward to seeing how yours goes. Cheers :)

Oh, I should probably have said, I have 2x4S 8000mah, as well as 2x5S 8000mah. On long journeys I set off with the 2x4S, and carry the 2x5S in a backpack . That way when the 2x4S run out, I know I should have enough juice to get back.

yeah, it's not the most efficient board! I do run batteries very conservatively though, only charge to 4.1v per cell, and I think the low voltage cut off is about 3.4v.

The only tricky thing is I have to use an external battery alarm plugged into one of the balance leads when riding with the 5S batteries, as the VESC minimum battery cutoffs are set for the 4S voltage.

Well i actually meant that these seem to be a very good figures for dual drive emtb.. especially if you were riding on gravel and such.. though, probably a real capacity put back into batteries number would be a more precise figure to look at.

I agree with okami. Is 20 kph your max speed? I'm getting the impression that you can go faster. 
Probably the main thing I might change is lowering the overall height a bit for more stability. Maybe a double/drop deck?

I'm trying to build a Carbon GT, not a bamboo (not that the distinction matters too much). That being said, it looks like you get a HUGE discount by being in Australia. Carbon's from the US store are $2000, not including skipping.

Though I agree there's a lot that's special about a custom boards. It's not just about the cost (e.g., swappable batteries)

@Okami @High-roller oh :) I mean I'm happy with the range, I'm not really sure how it compares.

The most accurate statistic I have is that I got 18km on the 2x4S 8000mah batteries at 4.1v charge, at an average of about 20kph, on very flat mostly limestone trail terrain.

The theoretical max speed of my setup with 10S is around 50kph at this point. I still haven't gone full throttle on the flat, it doesn't feel safe with my trucks/shock blocks set where they are. But I've got quite close, probably about 40. 30kph feels fine. 

I could increase stability a bit more by tightening the shock block screws. But to be honest I prefer to keep it to a speed where if I fall for any reason I can be fairly confident I won't need an ambulance. That feels like around 30.

Cool, thanks for giving the stats.. you seem to get quite a range from your setup! I assume I would get only around 13km out of my setup.. and I believe that the real energy consumtion for your board is even less.. as you dont really pull 8000mah out of that lipo pack you got.. :slight_smile:

The description says 7-ply maple and I'm not sure if that's rigid enough or too flexible. For reference, I'm about 67 kg.
The shape isn't my first choice, I was looking for something more tapered while having the drop-down and being a maximum 38-39 inches. But, since you can't have everything in life I settle for making sure I can steer without the wheels biting into the board.

Pardon the silly question- how do they make your toes numb? 
The previous board I posted looks promising- the moose drop-down. 
As for the trucks, I'm thinking of using the trampa skate trucks, they're 12.5 inches. The spring trucks are an option too, but I'm worried that at 16 inches they'll be a bit much. 
On a side note, both my pc and my phone keep rejecting the MBS site as infected. Has anyone else had this?

This board almost touches the wheel but never does it.. feet is a bigger problem but feet in the wheel wont stop you and throw you.

You just need wider axles. But probably not wide enough so that you can still mount street wheels comfortably..

look at scram boards.. (though restock times can be long, some say)

or ask @Mobutusan check his build thread, he has mentioned one forum member who makes quite cheap mounts.. they were not for round axles, but it did fit quite ok for @Mobutusan

The mbs equivalent has a sort of "chunk"(?) on it, but I don't see how it would work.

Since @Okami mentioned it, here's my build thread. 

And does anyone make spring/channel trucks with 10mm axles?

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/uncharted-territory-20-hyline-mtn-board-earthboard-250mm-trucks-8-200mm-wheels-8s-12s-dual-12s-tb-escs-korryh-motor-mounts-kaly-mtb-pulleys-dual-245kv-6364-mad-munkey/8041

I did source some motor mounts from @korryh and mounted them on round trucks using the caliber clamp and some strategic filing. I think all the info should be in my thread, but short answer is that it is working very well so far. Also of note, is that he was able to make me an extended-length motor plate that had 2 sets of mounting slots to fit motor/pulleys/belts for mountain board or a  street board set up. Although it seems easiest to just swap the wheel/pulley/belt with a matching street wheel/pulley/belt and 10mm bearings. 

One thing I haven't seen mentioned much is axle size and street wheel compatibility. From what I've learned, and anyone correct me if I'm wrong, 8mm and 10mm axles will allow you to easily run AT or Street Wheels as long as you have the proper size 22mm x 7mm x 10mm I.D. bearings. It is when you get into the 12 millimeter axles and corresponding wheels that the bearing size changes to 28mm x 8mm x 12mm, and won't fit into regular street wheels. 

So, if I were in your position and trying to save money, I would try to pick up a used MBS board or something that has extra wide skate trucks with 10mm axles. Then you'd have the trucks and AT wheels covered, and could still fit your street wheels with a set of 10mm bearings. Keeping the mountain board deck or not would be up to you. I'd get my pulleys/belts from @kaly, motor mounts from @kaly or @korryh, 3D print @juniorpotato93's 15mm flywheel pulleys, buy 10mm skate bearings from eBay, and get some extra belts from sdp/si to fit your street wheel/pulley setup. Then you should be able to easily swap between wheels. And you'd have some foot straps too, if you wanted to use them!

If you are interested in trampa street carve motor mount I have designed some that can help you. This ones stretch to run on urethane and pneumatics on the same motor mount, I'll post some pic later in the weekend.

Trampa's urban and street spring trucks are listed as having 9.525 mm axles which I read somewhere might as well be 10.
Your info on the wheel measurements looks about right to my untrained eye :wink: The solution is to get 10 to 12 mm  adapter sleeves to match the wheels to the axle.
love your build @Mobutusan! Incredible restoration! 
The thing is, I want the batteries, electronics etc. to go on the underside of the board, as I want to put some graphics up top.
What I was thinking is I could get either spring or atb skate trucks with the 8 inch wheels (likely my main ride wheels) and put them on a drop-down board to offset some of the clearance, but not too much. For comparison, the mbs AT long-board has 100 mm wheels:

Could that work well?
Other than that you were pretty much spot on about what I want to do.
If anyone is offering any of this stuff here- old board, tires, AT trucks- I'm interested! 
@Kaly, I'm definitely interested in the mounts, but I'll wait till I see the pics to decide. Thanks!
Just fyi, I'm in Israel, so I imagine that shipping will cost a bit more.

Thanks for the positive feedback! That old POS board has become very special to me. Can't get that feeling from buying a pre-built board. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

And thanks for mentioning those Trampa 10mm spring trucks. I might have to look into getting a set of those. 

Sounds like you need to go the @dinodave route with the truck wedges and a burly battery box to go underneath. Good luck! I'm gonna look into adapting some street wheels to my mountain board now that you've got me thinking about it.

This is the deck I'm looking at. Can anyone advise?
Decent blank drop-downs are surprisingly hard to find. 
@Mobutusan, yep! That's the plan!

That's very nice setup. Did you have to replace the speed controller, and remote receiver?
