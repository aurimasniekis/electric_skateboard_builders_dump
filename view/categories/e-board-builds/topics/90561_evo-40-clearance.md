Hi new to this. Im going to be building a evo 40" and using the eboosted ds enclosure was hoping it was more low profile than the one included with the battery from diy. planing on using the 110mm wheels from diyelectricskateboard as well as their 12s4p battery. do you think ill have clearance issues? Should i use a 1/2" riser? any other recommendations? thanks. this board is going to be used for long range cruises as well as getting around nyc. Thanks.

With 110s you shouldn't need risers for flat ground but if you're going from street to sidewalks or have rougher sidewalks then probably add a riser

It also depends on how much the deck bends under your weight

I liked my Evo with riptide tunnel risers, it gives enough room for a single stack and a decent bit of space

I had an Evo with a 12s4p TB battery, 1/2" risers, and 107mm wheels. I'm not sure how much thinner your enclosure is, but if it's around the same thickness as TBs default one, you will probably have clearance issues. I switched to AT due to shitty roads and clearance issues. I had to get off my board and move it past some speed bumps, which is a real pain in the ass. If you find yourself never going over speedbumps then you might not have any issues, but there's a few of them on my commute.

hmm doesnt sound like the best board choice for that enclosure, trying to stick with all torqueboards electronics for ease of use. any other decks you could recommend? maybe with a little less drop? thanks
