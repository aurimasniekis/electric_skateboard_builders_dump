Looks good, what's your opinion on those trucks?  I'm planning on using those for a build.

Its a very new built so I haven’t got the chance to really test it... from early impression they feel good, you have to put them on a mountain board or some 35-40 degree raisers otherwise you’ll  have (almost) no steering...

Cool, I've used those too. You know what's even better than that though for adding height? 5/8/10/12mm rubber sheet.
Not only is it easy to cut and work with, you cut out to the width and length you require and it also adds vibration dampening....
