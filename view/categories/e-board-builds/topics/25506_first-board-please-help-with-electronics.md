Hi, I'm building my first board and I'm not sure how to connect components to each other. Here are photos of electronics:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/a/0a3d457809a9c997d0910679e2ef1aeaf3f1396a.jpg" width="690" height="389">
I'm sure that phase wires from motors go to back of ESC but I have no idea how to connect switch to ESC and battery, neighter light to receiver
description
N1 - negative input wire to switch
N2 - negative output wire from switch
N3 - negative wire in ESC
P1 - positive input wire to switch
P2 - positive output wire from switch
P3 - positive wire in ESC
R - wires from ESC to receiver (acording to instruction I should plug them to CH2 on receiver)
L1 and L2 - wires from LEDs to receiver (I don't know where to plug them - CH1/CH3/BATT)
B1 and B2 - wires coming out of motors that look like balance cables, there is no place to plug them in ESC
please help :scream:

The "balance cables" are sensors. You can run without them if there is no port - not a big deal.
