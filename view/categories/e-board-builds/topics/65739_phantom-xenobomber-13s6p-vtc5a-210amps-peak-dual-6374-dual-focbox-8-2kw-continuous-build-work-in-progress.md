Now that this is behind us, (and I will be eating rice and water for the next 3 years) we can start the project!

All the parts are currently shipping so no building quite yet but I have some pictures and schematics about the project. 
This is the deck, a ridgid composite downhill deck. I'm not a fan of the graphic but the enclosure should cover it up:
![never-summer-soldier-tm-deck-only|500x500](upload://yhaFevfzkBb2CP2LkWfjTY74Rdp.jpg)

This is my wiring for the complete build, it took me quite a while to sketch but I'm sure it will benefit somebody else around here who isn't sure how to bypass a BMS or wire other stuff up:
![121212|580x500](upload://6XBOxfBE6Yuqiap5OYQMBookGZL.PNG)
As you can see in this wiring schematic, I am planning on having an exterior voltmeter constantly hooked up to the battery pack. This is because I will be bypassing the BMS for discharge and I want to make sure that I don't overdischarge my cells. I trust the FOCBOXes for lower voltage limiting while riding but I don't want to forget it overnight. 
Secondly, I will have a switch to cut the BMS which should avoid current leakage. I will use a DC 2.1mm plug for charging. To kill the entire system when I am done riding and to use as a sort of key I will simply use an XT90 anti spark connector on the battery positive lead with a loop. 
Finally (and I haven't seen this before), I bought a 5v DC DC buck converter with a USB 2.0 plug connected to it to charge outside devices from the skateboard's battery pack. 

I just got home from vacation and this is what awaited me:
![IMG_6384%20(2)|690x338](upload://rpjuBeN6BvGs279FguYvThEe49K.JPG)![IMG_6386|666x500](upload://tsPE3ZsYupqw1Rj9zrALCaApx5r.JPG)![IMG_6389|374x500](upload://Aj3AUL7n65OLQt0dw9bfIMX3VbG.JPG)![IMG_6388|375x500](upload://y9jEeSsaGolJkblPjJjwEngzAOz.JPG)

The cells look amazing, can't wait to stich them together! 
The pictures following that one show my current DH setup compared to the new deck (I have since changed the wheels on the DH setup to bigger mach 1 wheels, and cleaned the dirty griptape)

I am thinking of a way to store my boards (I have 4) and this wall stand looks beautifully simple. Will probably be building one in the near future.
![IMG_6396|390x500](upload://9lYQvtvqYccTTIO57ICmN5iCzx8.jpg)

Next is the FOCBOX aluminium case bought from @Kug3lis
 ![IMG_6443|690x429](upload://zs08qjbhiJBrwfV2YDyT934ZidX.JPG)![IMG_6447|690x425](upload://rfuUzdqbY8TP0hzzhj9stb6m9cO.JPG)![IMG_6444|690x407](upload://qYY7JWVEhW6sbt6I11rV1leWgJ.JPG)![IMG_6448|374x500](upload://yXs7RZbRB02WVmTHDzUpUaZZx1h.JPG)![IMG_6446|666x500](upload://5dXPlPjfTijZRPX5Ags7z7RRAXQ.JPG)
The case is magnificent, 120% worth the 60 bucks, shipping from Lithuania was quick and trouble free. I really recommand this, it was shipped out in a day or so and I am honoured to have this on my build. Big time credit to @Kug3lis 

Next comes the composite case building, before doing anything with composite you need an inverse mould to lay it on. To do that, the most common way is to buy a big chunk of foam (think polystyrene) and shape it up. To do that, the most efficient way is to use a hot wire cutter and run it through the foam. I didn't have such a tool but I did have a 12V power supply and a drok DC motor controller (not brushless, simple DC + - motor). So I just wired it all up and threw together a wood jig to hold an iron wire up.
![IMG_6452|666x500](upload://gtnfE4fsUlbb3T4FHzDYlOa1k1S.JPG)![IMG_6459|375x500](upload://gDh2xDUxkYTHFo9mTzAiSh0XbY2.JPG)![IMG_6456|666x500](upload://wIJa4fFPkLxkR7P8FjeyZNOL7PT.JPG)![IMG_6461|666x500](upload://4M49Qcb8CZVVrLVJ7Jp1iPwPNgq.JPG)
As you can see from the first picture, the spring melted and so I was forced to take it out of the loop. I tried building it without a spring but as soon as the wire heats up, it dialates and looses it's straigness; making it useless. So I had to add a spring once again (last picture). The wire gets nice and hot (glowing red kinda hot) so it will work wonders once I get to shaping the foam.

Next day has passed and I got to work on said foam. Here is the progress:
![IMG_6481|690x425](upload://ktEZI0bFYVZ0qL3IFVXfXITDdru.JPG)
![IMG_6482|690x367](upload://lJNZPp4G4lytv4k1JZ6xjcOeKdQ.JPG)
On the bottom, a cut made by the homemade hot wire cutter, on the top, a cut made with a knife
![IMG_6484|690x372](upload://9rGS0teqe31FsTe6sQgP4HnxCgC.JPG)![IMG_6485|690x427](upload://bWs9r9FbcYHNtvlh9NcbkTpJWQU.JPG)![IMG_6493|690x372](upload://g631OPUHYMOrT1c9E1wLn5nQNjR.JPG)

So I have cut out the entire board out of styrofoam, I then placed some cells on the enclosure mockup. I used the very last picture up here as a guide to photoshop different cells configurations and see what was the most efficent. Next picture is the result of those 3h of work:
![Esk8%20enclosure%20planning|374x500](upload://7VeJfMSYc5eaHfTTdOwfmYxcirQ.jpg)

This configuration is done all to size (1mm = 4 pixels) on the real styrofoam already cut out, this should give me the most accurate results. The configuration shown is the one I ended up choosing, the only issue I'm facing is that I haven't received the trucks, motors etc. from torqueboards yet. This means that I don't know how close I can get to the trucks but I made some guides. The upper one is where the 97mm wheels extend to on the board. The lower one is the truck distance + 133mm from the torqueboards mounting bracket. Hopefuly that will be enough. 
The positive aspect of this cell configuration is that it will be very easy to weld together because the packs of 6p are always together. It will also be easy to weld the 13s because the cells are back to front snaking down the enclosure. As you can see, I have plenty of space for my 78 cells + FOCBOXes + BMS + switches, voltmeters, etc. I am even considering implementing an integrated charger. I am currently waiting on it from China, will see if it is small enought to take apart and put in the enclosure (13s 2A). 

Next aspect of this build is the asthetics. I am usually one to skip over thoses but this time I decided to outdo myself. First of all I had to choose a name for the build and a colour theme to stick to. I ended up choosing: "PHANTOM EXOBOMBER" because I will be bombing on this board. So fast even that I will zip by and be gone in an instant (phantom). But simply calling it bomber was sad because it is way overused in the EV market. The power on this build will be from another universe so that is where the "exo" prefix comes from.
The colour theme will be red and black, same as the gear I have bought. 
I then had to find a "logo" for the build and I found just what I wanted on the interweb. So I ended up printing it, sticking it on the back of my griptape and cutting the griptape patch out. This job took me 2h of non-stop forearm destroying cutting (with a box opener...):
![IMG_6495|374x500](upload://A30Jh4uDbiq00oSahRQ5kvFc14N.JPG)![IMG_6497|488x500](upload://jFhIsfnQiJwLjv9N1CEqzAFu1VW.JPG)![IMG_6500|690x309](upload://9fOOiuPg0FEr6cr2hTH9k2wZgoL.JPG)![IMG_6501|690x219](upload://1LA9duu7elFYkAQRmiM62teDTn1.JPG)


This is all I have done for now but expect this thread to be active since this is just the beggining.

Hi @Deckoz, I think it's important to put your name down here because in school I was always taught to reference my sources otherwise it would be plagiarism. I have to admit, I was very inspired by the master EVO, mainly the 13s madness and the deck inserts, so here goes my attempt at getting a good grade. (and as a side note I value your experience and advice)

Great question! answer is in two parts, firstly it's that I'm not rich so the first half decent 13s BMS I found that could handle 200 amps discharge (granted most batteries can't do what mine will) ran around 120$. But the piece of crap I bought ran me 17$ and free shipping. Yay aliexpress!
Second part of the answer is space, I am going to try fitting 78 18650s on 1 layer + 2 FOCBOX + all the other crap in the diagram. That means I do not have the necessary space to fit a 200 amps capable BMS with the thickness I am currently planning. 
**But I quite recommend it because it is a lot safer.**
Skipping the brain of your battery for half it's work (discharge) means that **your brain** needs to compensate. That means no foolproof skateboard you lend to your friends and they forget to turn it off and to charge it overnight. This screams overdischarge to my ears and I am terrified to ruin 300$ worth of batteries with one forgetful evening. Plus you need to be aware of unbalanced cells signs (google it) so that you can check it with a multimeter.

It's very reassuring to get a positive comment from a guy as experienced as you, especially about the deck. I doubtfully bought it because it is on a crazy discount but it matched all my other expectations. I also quite liked the ridgidity of a composite DH deck and thought I would need all the space in the world for all those cells.

I am bloody terrified of 13s too. Especially because I live on a mountain (at the top) and to go down to the train station I need to kill a good 300 meters of altitude. So every morning with a full battery pack I'm going to be hitting the brakes HARD and it cannot cut out on me because of overvoltage protection (20+% hills cannot cut out). But my 13s mentor (decky) apparently hasn't experienced those cut outs so I hope he can reassure me about this.

I'm not sure that the Focbox or any 4.12 Vesc can handle 13s without overheating.
Even 12s is pushing it.
As for the overcharging while braking, Just don't fully charge your battery and don't set the Batt min too high.

A lot of people say that you can really extend the life of your battery by undercharging it as well.

What is the 18650 charger for? I don't get It.
And just an advice... Ac spot welders are done for. Arduino are the future. Say goodbye to breakers tripping all the time with those.
I am sure your build will rock da house.

```
Lithium ion 20%-80% discharge-charge is the way to go. You go from an average of 300 3V-4.2V per cell cycles before the battery looses 10% of it's capacity (capacity is in mAh for anyone not sure) and is therefore deemed dead. Up to 1000 cycle if you use 3.2V-4V per cell. So I will make sure to stick to the 80% line. That also lowers the battery total voltage, it doesn't go up to 54,6V but only up to 52 volts. Since I hear most of the fets and components of the FOCBOX are rated for 60V that should indeed be better. 

Now about the overheating part, this really worries me because I am planning on using my 8kW continuous to the fullest. The mountain I live on has a nice 15% average gradient road that is a few kilometers long (5-10 minutes of riding full throttle). I will overheat my FOXBOXes like a trigger happy 12 year old using a machine gun. So I had an idea, do you think it would work cutting out holes in my case and strapping on OVERSIZED heatsinks to the focboxes with the fins outside the case? If the answer is yes, do you know a FOCBOX aluminium case for sale or do I have to diy my own?

Edit: god this community has every thing I need already for sale. @Kug3lis saving the day with his custom dual enertion focbox aluminium case. Fins already included! Have you done any tests at 150 amps continuous (both focboxes) with your finned case?

18650 charger would be for smaller projects or troubleshooting single cells that are too low on voltage. I don't have a 4.2V capable charger.

I 100% belive you about the future in arduino spot welders, I just needed too get a hold of a spot welder and decided to get the not too crappy one since it had free shipping. Now would I rather have a battery operated arduino spot welder, yes of course, but for now, that's all I've got.

edit: It's also quite challenging to build a "battery operated arduino spot welder" without a spot welder to weld that battery together...

Haha I used to have two modes, but now it's just the full power all the time. So it's a good excuse for me to tell people they can't ride it, because they'll die lol and they can't handle it. They don't believe me, until I take off full throttle compared to them. Pretty much embarrasses any board I've come across in acceleration. 

But in reality, it's like handing a 1000hp RWD car to someone whos only driven upto 300hp FWD. Just gotta ease into it and always be aware of your available power.

Not really. Lol it's within Focbox limits. Your more likely to melt motors then hold a higher constant current that will fry the Focbox. My board has thousands of miles on these focboxes, and they were on my vanguard before that which also had thousands of miles on it. Add some extra aluminum mass, and they'll last forever. 

Sure the voltage is closer to the limits, but the amperage as a whole is typically alot lower compared to the same board at a lower voltage with the same rider.

That’s actually a really good point I hadn’t thought of before. Since it’s the amps that make the heat (not volts, not watts) and 70 amps at 6s is not 70 amps at 13s, you make a lot less heat running 13s.

70amps on 6s full charge

6s * 4.20 = 25.2v
13s * 4.20 = 54.6

25.2v * 70A = 1764W
1764W / 54.6v = 32.3A

Focbox is rated for ~50amps on the pours... So

13s max wattage 54.6 * 50 = ~2730W

1700W is still alot of power per motor.

yea I use metr pro - this is my first focbox build, being able to configure so much is amazing!

I can carry my board but its not exactly something I want to do very often, I don't mind carry my boards that have 50 cells - I use these for going to shops etc. but I don't feel my 13s5p (65) has the same portability :) 

I worry 78 cells might make the board a little 'annoying' when not riding (I own a bajaboard so I know what too heavy means for the general usability of board!)

@Deckoz I love the feeling of having so much power - I did think first time out 'OMG I really don't need 13s'  was only the very first time out tho lol

Already got the metr app downloaded on my phone, it seems like a very optimized way to program the board on the fly. I will be sure to make a buttload of setting for my first ride (never owned an esk8). 

See, I recenty realized a pretty scary thing: I will be riding a skateboard worth 2 grant almost every day, bringing it to university, to the mall, to barbecues etc. Including places where you are not allowed to ride a skateboard (uni hallways for example). So I decided I would just drill a hole into the board and use my 700grams or 2kg bike U locks to lock it away (as I do with my bikes). But I just don't feel comfortable locking and forgetting a marvel of technology worth 2k that can be taken apart with a set of allen wrenches and a skate tool (the deck is 80 bucks and that's the only thing that would be secured). So how do you guys do with your esk8s? Carry them around everywhere? lock em?

This is another project I had, my dad recently got rid of his crap android phone cause the battery was cooked. I offered to get it off his hands, buy a battery for it and repurpose it as a display for the esk8. Make a custom enclosure for the phone and bolt it to the front of the board kind of display. So I can always monitor my stats: speed, power, battery level etc. What do you think of that idea?

That is the dopest thing I've heard in awhile, such a badass idea! I have very little experience in programming so I couldn't set up the algo but it won't be 100% accurate because UART VESC data doesn't accurately reflect everything that your heart rate is affected by. For example, imagine you see a group of underdressed chickens roaming the sidewalk and your heart gains 10bmp to push the blood into different organs :smirk:. Well that exciting encounter would false your data and trick your algo into thinking that a random deceleration is "rad". See what I mean?

I recently bought a 1000mm x 50mm x 3mm aluminum plate to "machine" (hem hem hem angle grind) an X bracket into. An X bracket that would go over the end of the board to mount an XHP70 on the front directly to the alu plate and then stick a heatsink to that alu plate. Custom cooled diy built 4000 lumen lighting, main battery powered of course.

So if you have a good shop that doesn’t charge 200$ for shipping, I will gladly note the name down. 

About the focbox 13s, it works but it’s sketch. Unless you’re one of the crazy ones and you’re ready to do all the research. Try to stick to 12s, it’s less unsafe.

Thank you for the link, I will check it out. 

13s full voltage is 54.6 volts and the components of the focbox are rated for 60 so I’ve still got a margin (issue is full battery + braking at high loads). The motor is not the issue, as long as you can cool it, and you don’t pass the wires’ insulation breakdown voltage, you’re fine. Amperage wise, it’s same then 12s, just more powwerraaaaaa as Bruno would say (that’s a reference from another world, don’t know if anyone here will get it).

- Fix and waterproof the nose of the case
- Figure out how to mount the motors to avoid wheel bite and keep ground clearance
- Cut out case for the fins of the FOCBOX case to pass outside
- Solder up battery charger inside the case
- Mount the I/O to the battery (voltmeter, 5V USB, Charging port, etc)

I would have liked (and had planned) to build a single layer battery. But as you can see when the cells are actually layed out in the case, the fit is tightt. And that’s with only cells, you have to take into account that there is padding, heatshrink, kapton, nickel etc. So there’s that, and when the cells were stacked diagonally (into the most space efficient config), I could fit two layers of cells in the pack without them going over. But once again, there is padding I didn’t account for. So in the end, I have between 4 and 10mm of overhang outside the pack.

This my friend is the reason I stopped my build last summer. Because I had no freaking idea how to build such a precise spacer (or a fat ass gasket?) that had to have a varying width, length and height. 

So if we look at the material options there is: 
- Metal
- Wood
- Composite
- Plastic
- Foam
- Rubber

Let’s analyse them:
- Metal is out because I have no plasma cutter. 
- Plastic too because I can’t shape it efficiently. I have no 3D printer so no PLA/ABS. 
- Composite is a decent option but I need a mould that I can lay over and it would leave me with an empty rectangular composite part. That part would be prone to cracking and not exactly what I would want to bolt through. 
- Wood is a really good option that I am considering. If I find a 10mm board that I can mark up with the perimeter case, then jigsaw it out. Do the same on the inside and spend a few weeks sanding to account for the varying height so the battery is tight all along the board. It might work. 
- Rubber is really good too and I have some gasket for car doors that I will use to waterproof the connection between the case and the deck. I scoured Aliexpress for thick ass rigid rubber because that would make the best spacer. It would compress and make a waterproof seal, it would be rigid enough to keep the case tight. I would be really easy to shape to the right size (could even use the hot wire cutter). But I couldn’t find what I was looking for (thinking of the rubber soles you shoe-goo to your shoe soles when you do too much foot braking on a DH setup. But you guys here don’t know these peasant issues hahah). Anywhom, if anyone finds a 1000mm x 500mm x 10-15mm board of flat rubber, send me the link). Or I can make it in multiple pieces. You get the idea
- Final one is foam. It would be really easy (like reaaalllyy easy) to make it with the hot wire cutter. Just put it under the case, and run the hot wire cutter along the case. But I need to find a rigid, waterproofish, foam (thinking of model airplane foam). 

What do you think?

tl;dr...

Just kidding lol.

I also have to build a spacer for my enclosure so that's why I was curious.

I'm going to build the wood one. Mainly because I need to maker a spacer that is 30mm and I think stacking that much rubber on top of each would get unstable.

I'm going to first make the frame, then sand the bottom to fit my deck precisely, mount it with epoxy to my deck and then paint it.

You could also make a the frame completely flat on both sides, glue/epoxy/etc. it to your enclosure and then put foam/rubber on the frame so it would shape to the deck

Since you only need 10mm I'm assuming rubber would be fine.

Don't know where you are located but Rubber-Stuff.co.uk got a lot of different rubber. I got this big rubber pad and I think it will be perfect for your purpose. It's no way near foam foam but actual rubber that is waterproof.

https://rubber-stuff.co.uk/product/pvc-nitrile-self-adhesive-pad/ (it's only 6mm though)

@b264 can we have your opinion

I actually agree with your opinion, the battery really isn’t great. Keep in mind this is my first complete battery so I did as I could. 
All the scratchy edges you see on the pics were trimmed as low as possible before mounting (not in the pictures). There was no fishpaper insulation (I didn’t have any, I now have invested!). But I had a lot of kapton tape (it doesn’t replace it but it’s better then nothig). About the dangeling wires, yes they are a mess in the first pictures. But let me point out that in the last pictures, once all the parts of the battery have been heatshrinked, you can see all the wires are clean, zip tied and so on.

Kudos for the idea to epoxy the spacer to the board. To make it part of the board. It’s a really good idea and I’m now considering it.

I totally agree.

Not even fish paper on the positive battery terminal. It's the easiest thing to add and one the most important parts. Neither no fish paper between the parallel packs. Balance wires not insulated. I don't think I would consider this battery safe at all.

There are no excuses when it comes to batteries! A lot of people say like you and I hate it! A bad designed battery is not just like not using loctite and then losing your screws. The battery can potentially burn down your house, memories, animals and your board. There is no room for fuck ups.

If you feel like you are lacking knowledge to build a battery, then just don't do it! It's that simple.

Insulating with fish paper is one of the most important parts when build a battery! You don't skip that part and be like "it's probably alright". No it's fucking not okay! Then you purchase some fish paper and wait. No cutting corners when it comes to batteries. It's not like you can just redo it when it falls apart.

Please reconsider that battery. If I were you I would do a lot of research and then rebuild the whole battery. I know how hard it is to take that decision but it's not worth it to see your whole house burn down.

I know you have spent a lot of fucking hours building that battery and then taking it apart is the worst part.

Sorry if I sounded rude in the post, but I can't point out enough how important battery safety is.

Cold hard truth around here.

I am aware of the risks and every battery I’ve made (I’m at 4 now), have been getting better one after the other. But even then, they still frighten me. 

I am ready to reconsider the outside of the battery. So taking apart the 3 packs, removing all the heatshrink, foam, and kapton. To fish paper everything cleanly, clean up any unever edges remaining and route the balance wires more cleanly. But the welds are decent and I’m not ready to rip up everything and reweld every cell. 

So we’ll see how things come along now that I’ve got more building supplies.

For wood and 3d printing don't forget SKIL at poly, they have a pretty big laser cutter for wood and several 3d printers

Good decision :+1:

I know it's hard mentally and (a bit) physically to remove all the nickel strips but adding fisher paper on the positive side is really fucking important. The only thing that is protecting + and - from each other is a thin plastic cap. I'm not an expert at what happens if you don't use it but I know it's really important.

and why not consider making another enclosure with the right fitting
okay it's a little annoying but with the experience it will be faster and you won't have to find something to rise it to make it fit

:point_up: :point_up: this so much man. I know it's a whole task to fix your battery now that you've done it, but it should be seemed necessary. 

Just recently KaramQ had a lipo battery malfunction, and it's about 5000 dollars in damage to his house. Can you afford to take that risk? Can you afford to lose the rest of your board, and possibly even your life if it were to fail in an important or extreme circumstance? I would wager not🤷

We just want another happy skater, and with the specs you've chosen you'll be happy for a loooong time.... Granted you don't go up in a ball of flames.

E: if you want to salvage the cells from this pack( a totally common practice) you can read up on it using the search function. For unwelding and deburring the scratchy bits and all sorts of good battery jazz

I posted this before reading your reply about looking to fix it when you have the time, and while I would say that it's a great initiative, I would still encourage you do to do it asap, as the cells won't wait for you :) 

Good luck, stay safe, and buy a helmet 😋

Ee: we're helmet Bros, sorta. Lol. Ive got the ls2 breaker, how do you like yours?

Hi guys! This post is unrelated to the eskate build but very related to the current discussion. I’ve had to rebuild an ebike battery for a friend and I’d like you guys to roast me on this build just like you did on the previous one. I tried my best to improve!

I don’t know if anyone has ever done what I did for stacking batteries head to tail: leaving a nickel tab on the outside and soldering the upper and lower tabs to make a connection. 
It seems pretty good to me because it avoids a lot of pain of twisting nickel and consequently ripping off welds. Plus it’s pretty slick and fine for a lot of current! .3mm nickel tabs with a shitload of solder. I know heat damages cells but the tabs are quite a bit away. 

Anyways, what do you guys think of this build?
