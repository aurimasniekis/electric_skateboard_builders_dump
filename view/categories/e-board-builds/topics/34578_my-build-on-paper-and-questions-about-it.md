So, im trying to replace my car.  So i want a nice and reliable board and this will be the first one i make.  After around 30 or so hours of research i think i am ready.  This is my list of things to buy, but i have two questions that perhaps someone can help me with.

Is the deck i chose nice?  Should i purchase a board with little to no flex?  i hate flex anyway and personally i dont even know if the board i chose has that much flex.  However its a regular longboad so i assume it does.(im a skater not a cruiser)

In terms of hooking everything up with eachother, is it advisable to have the vesc directly to the motor or should i get some extensions?  

Dont judge me and my laziness with buying the DIY battery.  I just want to study my first DIY... also i dont have many tools... so everything involving the battery wouldve been just a huge test of my patience that i didnt wanna deal with.  A 2-3 hour charge coming from a regular old laptop charger is super simple for me... so yay.  Also it has the indicator, switch and even the enclosure which i just find super useful.

I know i can probably create my mech kit myself... but the extra parts will be handy in case i ever wanna make another board. 





1- MINORITY Downhill Maple Longboard 40-inch Drop Deck 60$

2.Longboard 180mm Trucks Combo w/ 83mm Flywheels + Owlsome ABEC 7 Bearings 40$

3. ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD BATTERY EPOWER PACK 6S4P 264.66$ (unless the 9s2p would be better, idk any thoughts?)

4.TORQUE ESC VESC Â® BLDC ELECTRONIC SPEED CONTROLLER 100$
With receiver cord 2$

5. DIY TORQUE ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD MOTOR 6355 190KV


6. SINGLE BOLT ON MOTOR MOUNT W/ DRIVE WHEEL KIT 107$

7. DIY 2.4 ghz remote with receiver 60$

would a 6s4p battery and a turnigy 260kv motor be better?
Im looking for a lot of range.

All in all my total will be 700 maybe a tad more because of shipping


So what does anyone think hmm?  Would all these work in conjunction?  Any suggestions?  Especially in regards to how i can change the voltage for the VESC once i hook it up with the software?  Or how i should have it?  especially if i want range?


I also just want to add that this forum has been an absolute blast in terms of how much knowledge ive obtained.  I could not have done, any of this without the countless of hours of reading that i put into this website.  Thankyou everyone!!!  Hope to be zooming alongside some of you one day!

But then I'd have to bump myself up to a 10s would I?  If I really want bang for my buck. I'm sorta leaning toward a 12s4p battery supply, with the 190 torque motor. For that extra range.
