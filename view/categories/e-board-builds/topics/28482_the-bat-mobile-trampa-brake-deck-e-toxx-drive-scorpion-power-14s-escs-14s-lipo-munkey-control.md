So I am still working out a few details, as I order stuff I thought I'd add it to my build here.

I'm in southern central Australia, on a island off of the southern coast. South from me is Antarctica. This build will be a bit of a project for me, a journey as well as a out come. I skated more as a teenager than now but I still ride my long board down the esplanade to work each day:) I've ridden bikes for a few years, from moto to supersport and back to supermotard... the only bike I regret selling was my Husaberg FS650 tard... and in that vein the esk8 bug has bitten and I want a eMTB. I want something I can play build and destroy myself... as I said it is a journey as well as a outcome for me.

As far as specs go I'm going to try and over engineer stuff, make it bullet proof best I can. It will be a learning experience. My thought is I want something I can ride like a motard, wheelie, skid, stoppie, maybe even back it in? So I'm going to pass on a VESC and go for a light switch with torque to spare. Watching Jens blow stuff up gunning the trigger I figure I should work in some head room and cover peak with my continuous?

so here goes

I'll post up some pics of my ESC's and motors...

Hah sounds deadly, definately show some progress when u have some :slight_smile:

Check @dinodave "adventures" when u got time, i think.he lives in tasmania or closw to nz, though probably not relevant and still far from you but his build.and struggle.has.stuck in my memory for some reason

Sticking with my over spec/engineer philosophy:
I have 2 x [Scorpion Commander 59v 160A OPTO ESC](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/clearance/electronic_speed_controllers/59v_esc/14s_160a_esc/)'s these are airplane speed controllers and do not have a regen brake. But they are built well and over specified. The are rated to handle 14s (59v) and 160 continuous amps or 200 amps peak. I want to cover the peak consumption of my motors with in the continuous capacity of my ESC's so that I can thrash the hell out of my board without having to worry. Some other cool features are: The housing for each controller also has a mount for a high speed 30mm fan and comes std with a [YGE Typ 7 capacitor bank](http://www.yge.de/en/accessories/) and a second active wire with (I think) a 4.7 ohm resistor to act as a antispark.  

My two Commanders will be controlling 2 x [Scorpion SII-5535-160KV](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/aeroplane/motors_1/sii-55/S-5535-160KV/)
They are specified as follows:

Stator Diameter	55mm (2.165 in)
Stator Thickness	35mm (1.378 in)
No. of Stator Arms	12
Magnet Poles	14
Motor Wind	16 Turn Delta
Motor Wire	20-Strand 0.33mm
Motor Kv	160 RPM / Volt
No-Load Current (Io/10V)	1.11 Amps
Motor Resistance (Rm)	0.027 Ohms
Max Continuous Current	90 Amps
Max Continuous Power	3750 Watts
Weight	906 Grams (29.41 oz)
Outside Diameter	66.4 mm (2.614 in)
Shaft Diameter	M8*1.0
Body Length	69.52 mm (2.737 in)
Overall Shaft Length	116 mm (4.567 in)
Max Peak Current	135 Amps
Max Peak Power	5600 Watts
Max Lipo Cell	12s
Motor Timing	5deg
Drive Frequency	8kHz

I'll have a few challenges mounting them, but I think I have it covered... they look like fun and I grin each time I pick them up :smiling_imp:

Scorpions product nomenclature is a little different to other manufacturers the 5535 relates to stator length and width not motor shell diameter and length. As per the above specs the motors are a little over 64mm in diameter and nearly 70mm long (6470). Interestingly at 906g a piece they are heavier than any other motors of similar size I have looked at. 
Scorpion use high temperature capable magnets in there motors, that combined with the claimed 10hp (7500w) cont and 15hp (11200w) peak I am hoping that they will run pretty cool and ill be able to advance the timing considerably to move peak torque further up the rpm range.

Here are some stock images, it is dark and raining here atm

Joel was super cool to deal with and is making up a remote for me in a custom colour to go with my motors/ esc's...

Jenso (@Nowind) the ESC killing beast has been adding these to his Roxxy ESC's for a while now since he set a few on fire. The capacitor banks tame the input spikes to the speed controllers caused from the inductance of the battery wires and mashing the throttle :sunglasses:

Not sure how many peeps noticed but my motor wires are on the other end of my motor from the motor shaft?

http://www.scorpionsystem.com/files/i2,152_popup_image.jpg

Well like a hub motor the shaft and shell all rotate together, after some research in other forums (I've been cheating on you eSk8 builders) I have watched some [cool video on how to change my motor shaft](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/building_technic/change_shaft/) and even [how to make my own motor shaft](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1240725-Making-and-Replacing-a-Brushless-Motor-Shaft)s from drill blanks and I have ordered some new [HK-5035](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/helicopter/accessories_6/hk-50_shaft_kit/HK_5035_shaft_8/) shafts for my scorpion [SII-5535](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/files/i2,162_full_dimension.pdf) motors. 
Essentially it is not that hard depending on your motors construction. With a Scorpion it is easy, you just need some basic tools, loctite, maybe a dremel tool and definitely a arbor or drill press and your good to go.

Time will tell, my new shafts are in the mail :grin:

But it looks like i'll be using a gear drive now :smiling_imp:

Letting @benjammin down on his sale was a bummer, but over a beer he took the news well :wink:

My @trampa just turned up in the post. Not sure exactly what I was expecting? The deck feels great in hand, and better than I thought underfoot having read that some do not get along with the convex form. I did have a pair of adi ease II on though and they have good outer edge support. All in all I'm stoked with the deck, Thanks _Frank & Ted_ :tada:

I am a bit under-whelmed with the brakes though, not unexpected, so some work to do there to get the right feel.

I found a discontinued factory [reverse mounted scorpion motor] (http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/discontinued/motor/s50_1/S_5030_220/) this morning
Before I was sure I could work it out, know I know I have this in the bag...
even has the circlip mount like I plan to use instead of the internal bearing shoulder/ridge.

I flipped on my batteries, I was going to run 12s graphene, but I've gone for regular _heavy duty_ Lipos at 14s for a bit more speed and the fact they come wired with 8awg from the factory. From the boards, 3D Heli guys are using a pair of these and draining them in under 4 minutes with no drama so I'm sure they will be more than enough for me.

After a bit of hunting around I settled on this [HV Step down adjustable switching regulator](https://www.dimensionengineering.com/products/swadjhv) to power my receiver and ESC fans. Not a lot of options at 14s... :frowning: but this little switching regulator (converts voltage in little chunks rather than just wasting energy as heat) looks sweet :heart_eyes:

After reading around a bit on the heli forums and what they do to maximize Tx-Rx reliability I decided to grab a bit more Scorpion swag, a: [Scorpion Back Up Guard](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/accessories/backup_guard/S_Backup_Guard/).
http://www.scorpionsystem.com/files/i2,149_popup_image.jpg

basically it plugs in to a the low volt Rx circuit I'll run at 6/6.5v, and if it ever runs down to near 5v it will kick in and power my Rx & esc fans. So it helps with _BEC brown outs as the heli boys call them_, inductance induced BEC supply issues and BEC failure...

I've been hunting around now for a while for a solid high amp connector solution, especialy for my 2 x 7s battery leads (14s) that I expect to get hit with around ~280 amps of current. 6mm xt150's are not quite up to spec, or even the 7mm AS150's are only rated at 200a :frowning:
I see @Nowind just got rid of lots of his xt90's on his 80mm Leo board...

So I'm going to give [these](http://www.lehner-shop.com/Accessories/High-current-connection-400-A::52.html) a shot instead  

http://www.lehner-shop.com/images/product_images/popup_images/52_0.jpg

Solid 6mm connectors from LMT rated at 400a...
& when LMT say it's good for 400a I trust them they are :laughing:

great build. Love the scorpion motors. I had a bunch of them when I was a 3D RC geek back in the days. They are massively powerful. I wanted to do some build with them but these are getting expensive. Nice move on the beads. Really wondering how you can put that into a tubed tyre; you need to remove the valve right?

Scorpion have some motors on discount atm
specifically this [S-5525-170KV](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/discontinued/motor/s55_2/S-5525-170KV/) for **$160USD** would make a great duel 10s vesc 4.xx build without being crazy in price. It's kind of the little brother to my motors :smiling_imp:

How did you go @okp?
You work it out...

You need to remove some little grub screws, pull it apart, press out the shaft (I used a drill press, a arbor press will work to). Then re-assemble in reverse with the new shaft. I bought new 8mm shafts from Scorpion. You could use the old shaft or even make some from 10mm drill blanks. Again all the info needed was in the above links. :sunglasses:

BTW about the balancing - i've noticed mountain board tires have a thick spot in one point, you can find it by pressing on the center with fingers. If you position the valve opposing that spot, it gets a lot more balanced.

Easy @okp :sunglasses: 
This vid shows you how to remove your valve core and even make a tool if you do not already have one, sometimes they can be found on a bicycle multi tool for example. Once the core out is out pour in the beads through the valve stem then replace the core and fill the tube with air :innocent:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zzkwL6QmlY

I made a small paper funnel I masking taped to the valve so I didn't spill any why I jiggled the tube about to accept to beads ;)
* you don't even have to take the tire or tube off the rim

@okp I bought a 3oz/85g bag, I've divided it in to 6 x 14g lots so I had enough for a couple of spare loads if needed. How much does the valve really weigh? and it does not have as much force per weight on the wheel as it is mounted on a smaller radius. 10g could be plenty, a few grams might work? you would have to test to be sure though. If you roughly balance the tire like @vap is suggesting you would need even less... ;) 

I have used a bit extra so I can get mud on my tires and the wheels will self balance while I'm riding :sunglasses:
