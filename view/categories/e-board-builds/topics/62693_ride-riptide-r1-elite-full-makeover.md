So my wife got me the Riptide r1 back in March because she knew I've been eyeing the esk8 scene for some time.
![received_168287137202044|373x500](upload://wPdk0UFVGi3KYfDVCu5ZViURzGQ.jpeg)
It's been fun, but definitely left me wanting more.
So I started looking into diy options.
Got parts stacking up, mounts & 6374 motors from @marcmt88, focbox from @Scoo_B_SK8, @Hummie deck ordered.

Thought my R1 would make it untill I could start building my first board.
WRONG LOL

So.....
This happened 
![image|391x500](upload://f6zjSxdZRAB7enItmM9s3hbokkk.jpeg)
Contacted Riptide and while they will replace the rear truck they are out of stock.
So luckily I have caliber hangers I’m not using for my hummie deck and tb base plates (I wanna replace those tho). I just ordered mounts from @JLabs seeing he has his half price atm. So rather than wait on another pair of the crap truck the board came with I’m gonna do one better.
I figured since I gotta take it apart I might as well change out the deck for one of the many decks I have laying around.
Tried a arbor short board I have and a  Santa Cruz both were too narrow for the wide trucks .
Pulled out an old zip deck and I think it’s gonna work out.

![image|666x500](upload://wBGvN7QKm7WEVYOXltMoMWvWfcm.jpeg)
No wheel bite!!
I plan to slowly replace the battery/speed control and motors as time goes by but I'm more focused on building my hummie deck.
I'd love to upgrade the battery asap but I'm not putting those kinda funds into this until I get to ride my hummie deck.

Ended up Fred Flintstoning it to and from work tonight on this thing. Not to bad.
Came home swapped bearings and changed up split angles and bushings. (Really need pivot cups.... they might as well not be there) 
Tempted to go on a night ride but I'm beat.

```
So my bkb mounts got here today. 
Thanks @JLabs for the fast shipping. 
But I messed up.
Thought I knew what motors they used on the Riptide and I was wrong. 
Motors won't mount. Way to small. 
So I guess I'll wait on RideRipTide to restock thier inventory. I'd rather not spend money on those cheap molded mounts they use on this thing. 

I'd almost rather just buy a used/on sale set of motors (63??) .
If I'm gonna put any money into this thing it will be an upgrade. I'm not just fixing things I wasn't happy with from the get go.
*guess I would need to figure out what Would run safely on it's current speed control.

Would be great to toss in a 10s2p, & upgrade motors still using this esc

Ride Riptide customer service is absolute crap.
They can't honor their warranty because they don't have the part available even though the same rear truck they use is not only on eBay but multiple other cheap DIY sites. And they say I'll completely void my warranty if I use any parts other than what they send me. They also can't give me an estimation on when they will actually have new parts in......
So these guys expect my to push my board like some caveman in this heat....bull $h!+

So i got rear ended on my way between job sites today. Drunk guy just took off.....
So with my half a$$ auto insurance I'll probably have to spend my esk8 savings to fix this thing. 
None of this would have happened if I was on my board. Thanks Ride riptide.... 
I was a few days away from ordering a battery.... the last piece. Ugh

Man, usually Ride Riptide has a good support. I had an amazing experience with them. As far I know they’re upgrading few parts (like the battery) so wait a bit :) I know sucks. If you’re in a rush diyeboards sells them for a very affordable price. .

Yeah,  I'd rather not spend money on a part I don't trust. I've talked to ten plus people in the last few weeks that all had the same problem.
Trying to put all funds into hummie deck build.
But looks like I'll be using said funds on the family rig. (Second time in three months I've driven to work) 
Plus my back is starting to hurt. So I'm sure that's going to cost me. Looks like I'll be putting both boards on hold. Hopefully won't have to sell parts I've been holding on to. 
Back feels like I might be missing some work

 Heard back from Riptide today after sending them an angry email. they should have  Replacements in stock this week. So yea 
On a brighter note
it looks like I'll still be able to get a battery ordered for the hummie deck.  Just going smaller than I thought.  But should be fine for first build. 
Was shooting for 10s7p/12s6, but I'm just gonna go with around 50 cells and keep it a flatpack.
So 10s5 or 12s4. I probably won't make my mind until I send payment lol.
And even better I'm going back to work tonight.  Got a whole day off. (After 68 in a row)

Well they finally have the part I need back in stock now I just got to wait for shipping.
Hopefully I won't just snap the rear truck again but I'm thinking I probably will. I've talked to a few other Riptide users that had the exact same thing happened to them.
I just want the board to make it till I'm done with my build.

At least I don't have to drive to work. 
It's just gotta last a bit longer.

So....
Things are coming for this board. 
New SR tkp trucks, @psychotiller mounts, kyde for new enclosure, 10s5p battery (thanks @J0ker3366) 97mm abec 11 wheels all ordered and on their way.
Might have to transfer to a different deck.
Hoping this will keep this board going a bit longer and improve the overall feel.
Next purchase (not for a few months)  will be new motors and upgrading to focbox or just a better esc In  general. (Maybe I'll get my hands on a unity and can put that on the hummie deck and steal the focboxes off it)
After that I'll have a pile of parts that are basically a complete riptide r1.lol

Shipping on these trucks took forever...
And my bearings and axles were missing. The box was hammered....... @Sender think you could shoot them a email? (Under the impression you are in contact with them,  if not nvm)
They never respond to mine.....

Anyway they look great. 
Unfortunately my 16t pullys are MIA.
Think I sent them to someone by accident. 
Thinking I'll stick with 36t wheel pullys until I find a 10s battery (that 10s5 isn't gonna work out) 
So I'll need shorter belt as I bought 275 for 16/40t set up.

I pushed the wheels out about a 1/4 from where that sat before. 
Definitely getting wheel bite now so ill have to adjust some things. Especially for the 97mm wheel on the way.
The @psychotiller tkp mounts fit great.
I'll probably be ordering pullys from him tonight.

@Skunk
is that your customization on the griptape or riptide? either way it looks DOPE! Also why don't you just order some bkb mounts and trucks and be done with it? It woud be a cool backup board once you have your main board running anyway. You should check out skate metric on youtube, they made a riptide clone with lipos and TB vescs and it serves its purpose pretty well

[/quote]

I did. First thing I tried.  Dont fit 50xx motors 
Plus Precision trucks or bust
I've got focboxes for my hummie deck. And a unity ordered. So the unity will end up on the hummie and the focboxes will be swapped to this. 

The grip is art by TheArtOfSkinner, super cool artist definitely check him out.
 They do a few of his art pieces on grip that you can buy on Ebay .

Haha she's alive. 
Realized the bolt on 40t pullys I had were slightly bigger then the 40t press fit pullys I got from @JLabs. I intended to use them on the hummie deck but though since there's some trouble shooting with them and RKP SR truck, maybe I should try them on TKP.
Well, they work great on the TKP. Was easy getting tillers mounts lined up with jlabs pullys.
I had to double up on risers in the back and wheel bite is still possible. 
I'll have to get some rock hard bushings in the reat room Ripetide sports.
The 97mm wheels might not work after all....

So much room for more motor......
6354...6369 maybe @psychotiller :wink: 
 I'll take her all apart again tomorrow and lock tight all the things

Had some 97a venom bushings laying around in my parts box. Also have some 95a if these are to much.
Tossed them on the back in Hope of getting rid of this wheel bite.
Also swapped out two of the rear risers that came with the riptide for an angled one. (On the front too)
Both angled forward for more control out of the front and less movement on the back.
Finally no wheel bite with the 90mm. We will see what happens with the 97mm.
Took everything apart and applied lock tight and put back together again. 
Now to wait.....

@dareno it stopped and dried up enough to ride to work.

94a barrels and a bunch of random fatt cones.
Feels great atm. Can't believe I'm not getting wheel bite.

Got to ride it to work today.
Man it rides nice now. These SR TKP trucks are great. Especially with the bushings i got on there now. The improved belt fitment with @psychotiller mounts has completely changed the brakes. I lost a little top speed going up to 40t with @JLabs awesome press pullys. But got it back and a better ride going from 90mm to 97mm abec 11s.
Id really like to re deck this build. 
Maybe thats next.....
Or motors 
Or battery 
Lol idk

@Skunk if you decide to put a new deck on the build at some time hit me up and I can do an awesome custom deck for you.

Oh really. @briman05 
Look for something in the 33-36 range. 
Really like moonshine(sidekick,rumrunner) and rayne downhill decks. 
Kicktail is a must.

That size I wouldn’t be able to do. Most of my decks I do with kicktails are like the 24-30 inches size but they have a proper kicktail. And then I have longboards

These pullys with 
https://www.vxb.com/6000-2RS-Bearing-Deep-Groove-6000-2RS-p/6000-2rsbearing.htm
Bearings stuffed in side on SR trucks are the best.
Ive currently got 2 bearings in my wheels and THREE in my pullys.
Definitely running these on all my SR trucks for now on.

First ride on the 36t/16t pully set up.
I like the extra top end but my brakes are drastically different. 
Might be going back to 40t. Ill need slightly longer belts.

Probably something [like this](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/just-made-some-5m-36t-5m-40t-wheel-pulleys/49760/106?u=b264) or [like this](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/just-made-some-5m-36t-5m-40t-wheel-pulleys/49760/65?u=b264)

So this thing has been acting up lately. 
Sometimes 
*won't trun on
*wont connecte with remote 
*won't stay at full acceleration steadily 
*wont stay at top speed for more than a few seconds 
*brakes are all or nothing 
It's not all these things every ride. But it's always one of them. 
I'll try and find time to crack it open today. 
Think the diyboard esc is on its way out. 
@dareno recommend i check the reviver so ill do that first.

*Trucks/mounts=snapped (replace with surfrodz & mounts from tiller)
*Esc=???? (Replacing with focbox)
*Battery=not holding charge (gonna order a 10s from @psychotiller)
*Deck = isnt bad (wanna deck swap with a moonshine) 
*Wheels= abec (probably the best part)
*Motors = holding up so far. Ill push them till they blow then Replace with maytechs from @psychotiller

Yeah it seems like the wheels are the best part and that is why did do that so you feel like you are getting a top quality board.  Its the old lipstick on a pig saying.  If you ever want to upgrade the deck let me know and maybe we can come up with a custom deck for the make over. Replacing the esc with some focboxes is a good idea or you could do the dual from flipsky @mmaner just did a review of it.

Wow. You're learning a lot about eboards! How did the ride change from the 90mm to 97mm wheels change? More cushy and smooth? More top speed, but less acceleration?

Hope you figure out the connection issue soon!

Thanks,
Doug

[/quote]

My acceleration definitely went down. But new top speed is nice. I went from the green formula 90mm abec to the black 97mm. My roads are fairly rough and both the greem and black felt great. I do notice a difference on carving grip with the black ones on nice roads.
Black abecs seem better for decent roads.
Green slightly better on the rough stuff.
Both are great. I couldn't recommend one over the other honestly.

Big changes coming to this board. 
12s2p battery,  dual maytech vesc, dual maytech 6355 sealed motors, riptide tunnel risers.
And also a new deck a few weeks after that

If you change out every single part is it still the same old board or a new one? 🤔🤔😂

Yeah the deck is the only original part now lol.
And ill be replacing it after i finish some things to its replacement. 

I'll use the motors enclosure battery and esc on a different deck for emergencies or guest.

The original riptide deck will go to @Sender to experiment on and resell.

I have a 33 muirskate deck that will get the tkp trucks and 97mm abec 11s. 
I also plan to take the battery , esc, enclosure, and motors along with some caliber trucks i have and putting it all on a jet spud.

The riptide deck will probably be going to @Sender when im done for restoration and a skin job.
It will be up for sale after that. 
If you wanna call dibs and pick out the design let me know and we can hit him up. Im sure he'll get you sorted @joeadams101

Reviving this old thread, the last link goes nowhere.   I too have an R1E that I'm looking to upgrade.    I got the 6s4p battery pack from the R1X last year for the extended range (getting 10-12 miles out of it), but I'm pretty unhappy with the quality of the remaining items (slipping belt from shitty pulley).  

The only thing I like is the deck, 90mm ABEC11s and Shredlights. So if I can re-use those in my new build it would be great.  Thinking I need to go with a 10s3p at least (Samsung 30q) if only I can make it fit under this deck.  I'll be happy with a range of 15 miles.   What do you think of the buildkitboard dual parts on this?  https://buildkitboards.com/products/kit
Minus wheels and deck?   I imagine that enclosure won't fit here given the cutouts for the handles...

Definitely can do that. 

Feel free to message me on E s k 8 .n e w s.

What I'd do. (Am doing) 

6355 motors unsealed. Maytech, Bkb ( @JLab )  or @torqueboards 

Caliber trucks 

Enertion caliber mounts or @torqueboards short 63xx or 50xx mounts 

I'm using @dickyho 40t bolt on pulleys or @marcmt88 40t bolt on pulleys ( @torqueboards makes good pulleys to, I'm just using what I got )

As far as esc goes,  flipsky,  maytech  and tb all make some affordable units but im using maker mini foc escs.

The enclosure will be the hardest part.
