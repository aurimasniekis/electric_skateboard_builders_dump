Hello iâ€™am Manu, I live in France and get my 2nd project the [FORAKER](https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Foraker) (http://www.e-sk8.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=2235)a MTB based on a hollypro 35, dual engine OVERION, 12 s 12000 mAh lipo, mount OKP.
Unlike my first Board the Hulk Board [http://www.e-sk8.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1123](http://www.e-sk8.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1123)made from A to Z this project is based on that of Pimousse.
Here are some pictures:

things move slowly: end of wiring ... hard to get into boxing but with a little organization we get there. Thanks to @stewii for the "tailor-made" ESCAPE ðŸ˜‰.
next step escape setup ... but before I have to find a lipo charger to replace the one who grilled ðŸ˜¢

What happened with the Lipo Charger? Never heard that one grilled.

Nice build in general, good to see more people on the VESC 6/Overion 130kv/12s12Ah team :grin:

Hmm weird. I can only recommend my trusty ISDT charger but i'm sure the diamond stuff is also good quality.

Normally yes the kit includes crown / pinion / chain / spacer and screw.
Ask Yann of OVERION by email, he is very reactive and good adviser.

Seems like a small pothole upset your balance causing the larger imbalance?

The Trampa looks quite flexy, what ply are you using? Maybe a stiffen bridge would help with that and you just ride through 

Good camera work!
