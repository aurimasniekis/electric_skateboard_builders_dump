Hello! I've built this board over the course of multiple months and been riding it for a good 2 months now. I still have plans for improvements etc. but the board rides really nice now and I'm happy with this build. I will put some pictures below of the build process and what it looks like now, but it's not intended as a build guide or anything. 

The specs:

* Trampa Street Carver deck.
* Mini spring trucks with yellow dampas in the front.
* Off-set mega-star aluminium wheels.
* 6.5" urban tread tires.
* Trampa bindings with ratchets.
* Dual 6355 maytech sealed 170kv motors.
* Dual focbox (replaced stock connectors for bigger).
* DieBieMS 80A smart bms.
* 10s4p Samsung 30Q battery pack (self made).
* Carbon fibre enclosure (self made).
* Motor mounts (self made).
* Metr Pro bluetooth module.
* 3D printed and painted console for the power switch and battery indicator.
* Remote is a firefly remote.
* Custom made wheel pulleys 56T.

Made them using the milling machine in my school workshop, and some other tools, took a lot of effort, wish I had a CNC instead!

Very good job and excellent carbon fiber work.  Did you manage to get your firefly to work reliably?

Thanks mate. I had to redesign the throttle wheel to include a bearing, now it feels a lot better and is very consistent. Had to solder an extension wire to the antenna of the receiver to bypass the carbon enclosure (blocks signals) and been having great connection now.

This is wonderful. I'd like to do the same and am intrigued by the idea of adding 50% aramid in impact zones.

With this gearing I get 43km/h which is perfect for me.

Basically did a layer of aramid fibre in all the edges that are low to the ground and don't need to flex, pretty easy to do, but a little expensive! I had some leftovers for free from school, so why the hell not.
