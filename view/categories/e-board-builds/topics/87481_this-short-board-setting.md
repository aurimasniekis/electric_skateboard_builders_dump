Hey guys I recently bought Meepo NLS as a try out of esk8 and i fell in love with it.

I am trying to build a short deck one with a kick tail. Would this deck work??? Thinking of putting 90mm hub motors. 10s3p battery with meepo esc. let me know if it will be a problem..

Well the Hub motors have nothing to do with the wheelbase obviously HAHAHAHA

yea a esc will fit there obviously..

Yeah that deck would work if your battery and enclosure is less then 14 inches. Get some risers so there will be no wheel bite and you shouldn’t be aiming to go at high speeds with that deck. Why? Because it’s too small and one step on the kick tail will send you flying

You can go fast on short boards.  Just takes different skill set. I regularly bomb random hills on my 30inch deck (easy 30mph) and always have my foot locked into the tail, but my body weight is focused on the front.

The Motors will work, that are the same motors Mepwown are using. The battery won´t work it´s only rated for 15A discharge.
The Deck is cool but keep in mind with an Esk8 you will have braking forces too, this forces will be applied to the Kicknose and lift your rear wheels which will weaken your brakes or makes you loose control. If you want a short Kicktail deck look for one without Kicknose.

The Meepwown use 12-15A per motor, so at least 30A discharge. But I highly recommend using a higher rated pack.

If you use an ESC like the one linked then you just don't, it pulls however many it thinks it needs and you gotta get used to what you can do with the throttle before the battery and motor get hot, but its really not that bad

If you buy a proper VESC, then you set it using a tool for it like the one from Vedder, there is a setup wizard that takes you through it and you set the max and recharge values for motor and battery separately
```

I tested the hubs with different Amps on a VESC and something between 15-30A per motor is good.
I can not recommend the linked ESC from e-bay. It works but is outdated tech. Meepo used it on their V1.
The newer Hobbywing ESC´s are better in my opinion. Running this Hubs with a proper VESC is much more fun though.

What do you want out of your board?
How fast. How far.
What's your budget for a battery? 
The ebay esc works but its limited in its abilities. 
A vesc you can change setting. Not an option with the Ebay one.
Vesc you pick your remote. Ebay once not an option.

@hyperIon1 is another great option for a battery.  
And he can build it in a desired shape to fit your needs.
If you need 15 mile range you're gonna need more than a 10s2p that's for sure.
Probably 10s3p at the absolute least.

Unless you plan to make multiple batterys it won't save you any money. 
The tools and materials add up. Plus lots of labor and you're potentially making a ticking time bomb if you mess up.
Best to trust the professionals.
