What wood is the marine plywood made out of?

The marine plywood is from bunnings (link below) and it only shows is that it's made from mixed hardwood.

Ah cool. I'm Aussie too. Tell me how that goes, pretty sure hardwood isn't great for boards. I'm making 3 bamboo decks with fibreglass currently. And then doing some Canadian maple decks with integrated electronics. The hardwood is pretty cheap so if it works well for you I might prototype with it for my integrateds.

How long does your battery take to charge?

Those sleds look like a nice alternative to welding. Where did you get them? And can you give an estimate of the total cost you made for the battery only?

The case made of aluminium and plexiglass is a nice idea as well.

How did you make it so the motor mount is clamped tight on the truck? Did you put a setscrew, or hammer it into place?

Around 2-3 hours because of the 2A charger but the batteries can take 4A if I get a different charger.

Just made it a tight fit and hammered it onto the truck. go for a few rides with it now on some bumpy road and it is holding up great, hasn't moved at all.

Love this build mate especially the battery enclosure :slight_smile:

How does it feel riding a flat board? Does it feel different without a concave ?

Thanks for the info. Will keep this in mind for my first build, but might start out with lipos first. Not decided yet hehe
