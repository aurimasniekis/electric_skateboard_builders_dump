a few months ago i bought a 3d printer but kinda lacked a real project to put into good use.
well, an e-skateboard should be one so i build one with pretty much everything printed except the the board ofc.

the complete Project took me like 4 wekks to complete but mainly because most of the ordered parts (mainly the VESC) took ages till it finaly arrived.

**Part List:**

* cheap longboard deck from amazon
* Caliber 2 Trucks 50°
* spoked 83mm wheels
* VESC
* Hobbyking cheap remote
* 3x Zippy 3s 5000mah
* Sk3 6374 192kv Brushless motor
* 9s BMS
* random parts like wires, xt90 connectors etc

**1. The Motor Mount**
so, everyone kidna knows 3D printed covers, but i went for a 3D printed motor mount as well and designed one. took a few itterations but i finaly got it working. finding the right angle and creating stable protective  cover for the motor took the most time. my inexperience with Fusion360 didnt particulary help either ;)

(Printed with PETG)

**2. Battery and VESC Covers**
theoreticaly the easiest part, but yet aggain, i had no clue how to use Fusion360. 
my original design was way to low. i tried to make it as low profile as i possibly could but kinda forgot to add the thickness of the shell (4mm)
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/b/8be0d7e325eab0020c2070af8fffb999c6cfafb1.png" width="690" height="334">

so after printing a part, i figured i had to increase the height (5mm) and shorten the angles

(still low profile enough)

(i should have taken a ruler when drilling those wholes. the vesc cover  is anything but straight)

**3. Battery Indicator**
last thing i needed was a mount for the battery indicator (http://www.ebay.de/itm/272572660673). since i needed a small raiser anyway. since i finaly had some experience with the softeware, this is what i came up with.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/5/157096feb2ce658e24482baa8c1d4e0b0b90d31b.png" width="690" height="437">

**ToDo**

* Add the BMS
* figure out a waqy to add more mah. i thought i had enough space for 10000mah but looks like i dont ^^
* add another mounting arm to the mount or make it even more ridged, because i figured out that i can actualy create a 2 wheel drive with one motor by using the "rotor" mount which was included with the motor.

**General Info**
havent dont any long term tests yet so no realy idea on the range (should be arround 8-10km) 
but this thing has a topspeed somwhere arround the  40km/h.  way to fast to be honest :)

i spent almost 750€. mostly because I was lacking tools, screws, wires and lots of other minor stuff which did add up quite alot. way more expesinve then i thought it would be ...

PS: made a small video as well. i should have done a diary ort something but well, now its to late ^^

looks like my mount needs more reinforcement or something other then PETG ^^
after my first real ride, this happend after 6.5km

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/2/c2f2965a68b7cbe4f76b742e6859b741394c8452.jpg" width="666" height="500">

other then that, im quite satisfied with the ride. 6.5km and having 65% battery left, seems ok to me.
now i need to figure out how to reinforce that part.
its probably enough to add some support on the other end which i allready have but removed because i thought it would be enough.

and update 3!

i changed the design of the mount a bit. extended the area where it boke before and added a another clamp to the other side of the truck to absorb more energy.

worked pretty well so far. i managed to drive arround 14.5 km (1.3 are missing in the log) and still have 45% battery left.

when back home i saw another crack, but i honestly was expecting one there anyway. should be rather easy to fix since i just have to make it thicker there and maybe experiment with the infill a bit.

Love what you're doing here keep it up, how are the teeth on the pulley holding out? Previous threads have said 16t or lower wear out kinda fast.
Perhaps allowing for some m5/6 bolts to be put in would make it stronger without compromising on cost or easily-sourced parts?

cant say much for the small pulley because i pretty much have to reprint it every time i change the motor mount (sits on super tight so it usualy breaks when i try to pull it off),  but the large one isnt showing any signs of wear so far.

printing the mount right now aggain with 100% infill. previously i had 60% honeycomb infill with 6x6x6 solid layers.
pretty sure that not going to cut it because PETG usualy becomes way more brittle when beeing solid, but i'll try it anyway.

**Update 4**

ok, so the new mount is finished printing and mounted. this time with 100% infill instead of the 60% i used before.

uppon further inspection of the broken part, i figured out that it only cracked the 6 outer layers i used, the infill and the other side is perfectly fine. which means that im probably on the right track with my 100% infill.

im updating the thingiverse page and add the support clamp there as well

**Update 5**

OK, the "right track" wasnt so rigth after all

PETG becomes way to brittle when solid. i think ill try less infill and less layers.
not giving up yet ^^

Have you thought about ABS?  I haven't printed motor mounts, but I have half a dozen ABS WHeel pulleys with 100KM on them, they show no wear at all.

thought about ABS yes, but right now i still wanna try it with PETG. im going to try 2 other ideas i have and if both fail, i try ABS.

they pulleys and everything else hold up fine. but the motor is just to darn powerfull and rips the mount appart.
i could solve that by just tuning it down, but that would kinda defeat the purpose.

increased the mountplate in width by 5mm now, not sure if i can fit the pulleyxy now but we'll see

I think the wall strength on those are way too thin. I've had good results with 20-30% infill. 3D printing sorta reminds me of a bone structure. Relatively thick wall strength and inside is the spongy   bone mass which resembles the infill. Try different kind of infill structure. 
Did you try annealing your part afterwards ? Would be interesting to see :)

Have you considered printing in polycarbonate?  I'm planning on printing everything in solid PC (pulleys, enclosure and motor mount) for my next build.

Just an idea, but you could try a hollow 3dprint and fill with something like Epoxy

How thick are the single layers you print?
The thicker the layers the less bonds you need and hence more stability. The finish is not getting nicer but form follows​ function.

@TranxFu @Vaulter92
Wallstrengt is 6 layers at 0.3mm. pretty much the max you can have with a 0.4mm nozzle.  no cooling to give it as much setteling time as possible.

Havent tried annealing yet. my last (and first) attempt to anneal PETG was pretty fubar since it compltely lost its form :D 
but i will probably try that aggain sooner or later.

the new print with the thicker mountplate and 50% infill is finished now. gonna mount it as test it today.

isnt petg a polycarbonate? :D 
originlay i was aiming to print it with nylon, but the one i need is pretty much out of stock everywhere

I have a bit of different mounting solution for the caliber trucks with a 3D-printed parts.

http://i.imgur.com/AxGC6jG.jpg

It's pretty durable even when printed with PLA, but they still develop cracks after some use, so I'm going to go for metal motor mounts in the future.

**update 6**

gnah! i think i reached a dead end here.

so the mounting plate now is holding up fine. but the plate is so thick, that the small pulley only is inserted 1/2 of its size which harms the pulley quite alot. also, i took a few extra bumby roads and the clamp holding onto the truck now broke. i cant make the clamp thicker but i could make it wider like SimosMCmuffin did. i was thinking about that before, but decided aggainst it.


never the less. I think i stop here and just buy a metal mount instead. the motor is just to darn heavy and to fix this properly i would need to mod the motor itself which is out of my abilities.

Just a small comment after looking at your design, and ignoring the conclusion :) I think you could improve on the geometry to avoid cracks. Use large radiuses where you can, instead of sharp corners and circular holes, not slots. Preferably also without  chamfers/countersunk. @SimosMCmuffin's design  looked interesting.

With 3D printed motor mounts, especially FDM, you have to make sure your motors dont get too hot as it will melt your thermoplastic. Although much more work, I believe making from aluminum is the way to go because they are much tougher and absorb a lot of heat from your motor.
