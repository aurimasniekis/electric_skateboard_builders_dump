So, the title pretty much explains it.  I'm building a mongrel board, part MTB, part Street, swappable stuff (more on that later) but I really need a Jet Potato 29.  I've contacted Jet, they ain't got nuffin.  As a last resort I could use the [Unik Carbone](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/unik-carbone-deck/), but ship times and having never used one, Im a little reluctent.  

If someone has a spud 29 they don't use anymore, I dont mind if its used as long as its solid, drop me a PC.  I can always sand and re-coat.  thanks

Trust me, I've called every skate shop and Jet themselves every week. They are no longer around..

I want to find someone to press a blank deck with a 1/4 inch kicrodrop and I will just cut the shape out on my CNC. But don't know where to start and it's not at the top of my list.

Id ask @psychotiller, @longhairedboy & @treenutter to see if they are interested, but I'm sure you already knew that :)
