Okay so firstly this forum has been incredibly informative to my research and after seeing the search bar researching content is easy as pie! This is my first build so if anything seems as though it may not work please say as I am not an expert. I would also like to say thankyou to @Michaelinvegas's help for showing me his basic parts build.

**The parts:**

[Motor](http://m.ebay.com/itm/5065-50-65-270KV-Heavy-duty-brushless-Sensored-motor-2-6KG-3-8S-for-Skateboard-/181913685694)- 5065 270kv 3-8s brushless motor - Â£38
[Battery](http://www.hobbyking.co.uk/hobbyking/store/__56839__Multistar_High_Capacity_3S_5200mAh_Multi_Rotor_Lipo_Pack.html) - 2 x Multistar 3s 5200mah lipo - Â£24
[ESC](http://m.ebay.com/itm/GoolRC-80A-2-6S-LiPo-Battery-Electronic-Speed-Controller-ESC-for-1-8-RC-Car-D8Q7-/252376974074?nav=SEARCH) - 80A Gool rc 2-6s 
Deck - 20.5" homemade out of 7ply maple veneer. I based it off of the ohmboy board design I think? Â£42
Wheels - green flywheel clones - Â£30
[Trucks](http://www.newtons-shred.co.uk/caliber-standard-8-in-london-2524.html) - Caliber 8" - Â£41
[Bolts and risers](https://www.skatehut.co.uk/m/longboards/longboard_trucks/mindless_angled_riser_pads_and_bolts.htm) - Â£3.95
[Heat shrink](http://m.ebay.co.uk/itm/127pc-Black-Heat-Shrink-Tube-Assortment-Wire-Wrap-Electrical-Insulation-Sleeving-/111802797663?hash=item1a07f74e5f%3Ag%3AKpoAAOSwwbdWJtbF&_trkparms=pageci%253A48bdf427-393f-11e6-82c8-74dbd18052cd%257Cparentrq%253A7d4420a41550a2af0850ba23fffd4719%257Ciid%253A1) - 127pc - Â£2.80
Motor mount and pulley kit- Enertion - Â£80

Then some Xt60 connectors, 4mm banana plugs, a lipo indicator and [this controller.](http://m.aliexpress.com/item/32612820590.html?productId=32612820590&productSubject=New-arrival-2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard&spm=2114.40010708.4.5.B0pTzA&tracelog=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail)

**Questions:**
1) Grip tape - whats the good stuff?

2) How many Xt60 connectors do I need? Two? 

3) Will this then work?

those multistars only have 10C discharge rate - at 5200mAh that is only 52A.
It can work but is a little risky (especially because the C rating tends to be exaggerated by the manufacturer). Go for 20C and you will be fine.

The caliber trucks will have to be modified to fit enertions pulley kit. I would recommend going to diys website to get the abec 11 flyweel pulley kit.

I thought that wiring them in series would create 20c discharge as a 10400mah pack, would that not work?
```

1: you mean parallel - in parallel you would get 10400mAh at 10C - so 104A. But you would only have 3S voltage which is ridiculously low.
2: You want to have at least a 6S setup - so series is required which leaves the capacity the same and thus the discharge rate.

Yes it is but it is flat, I took a long time to plan it, i will upload pictures when I get back as I am currently at college, but I may try to enclose the batteries inside the board like Bolt did.

Okay thanks, the only reason I opted for these was due to the fact that they are easily splitable to create 2 slimline packs that can then be wired in series

you can try that with any lipo pack. or go for the bigger 10Ah version as the 10C rate is enough in that case.

@Lightboard 
1) For grip tape: This is the good stuff https://www.amazon.com/Mob-Grip-Tape-Color-Size/dp/B009W86VAO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1466700176&sr=8-2&keywords=mob+griptape

2) Always get extra connectors - you never know when you'll need them https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GTG0KT0/ref=sr_ph_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1466700304&sr=sr-1&keywords=xt60+connectors 

3) Looks like it'll work to me

Yes, they should be. I would also advise buying some 12 AWG wire for when you wire everything in series. For my build, I made a series adapter, parallel adapter, and single battery adapter. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/bb810734dc89bd5bec11eced3918ab4d45daf6a1.jpeg" width="375" height="500">
I used xt90 for my ESC, but it won't make a difference if you use xt60

The battery will not work well drawing at 10c, using 4 instead of 2 batteries, should do the trick. 

Real world drone tests show ~5c should be the max draw. 3c sustained.

[/quote]

I would totally put a graphic on top of the board you made and use clear grip tape....

Think it would look dope and add more DIY artistic flare if you put something you drew or created

Yeah, I am constantly looking for lights at the moment, but they will be for my other board as this one will only be use during college hours which 7:30 - 5. Which lights options do you recommend? I have read the thread on it and I think it was @lowGuido's diy option that seemed a good idea or shred lights.

-- **UPDATE** --
I have been able to cut my board into a shape which I believe is similar to ohm-boys board but with my own customized board dimensions. Now I have opted to go with the batteries I originally stated, even though many people have said to go for 20C discharge batteries. My reasoning behind this choice is 1. Price, for the two of these it costs under Â£25. 2. The ability to slimline the pack. 3. This board is preliminary for a college board so speed isn't a necessity to me here. 

--**THE BOARD**   
The dimensions are: 20.5" x 9.5" (at the widest part) and 7.25" at the end.
I made various templates of the board but this is the result. The first is a thick 1" corrugated cardboard  that I decided was unnecessarily long at over 25" so I shortened it to 20.5" and then the next is a paper template. Then lastly is the cut out board that I hand layered out of 7ply Canadian maple. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/ebc710d4e14debb5e1f1c0dad9a47b2199f82da8.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Below is the enclosure options. I wanted to see what sizes I would have so I mocked up two outcomes on paper, the top as if I was to slimline the pack and the other if I was to leave the lipo as it comes. I am going to go for the slimline option as I can then try to enclose the components inside the deck itself.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/eb6f525c46322ba112e733f6d0bad11d57861d72.jpg" width="281" height="500">

I then cut out a duplicate board using my jigsaw and cut out the inside section to house my electronics and battery. I will then use magnets and some abs plastic to form an under lid.

I then aim to glue the two together like this to make a strong but 24mm thin deck in total with a 13mm deep section for electronics to sit.

-- **QUESTIONS** --
1) How many neodymium magnets will be required if the can hold a suggested weight of 550-650g? would [these ](http://www.magnetshop.com/neodymium-disc-magnets-p-2105-l-en.html?cPath=2)work?
2) Will I need a rubber 'gasket' in between the base of the board and the enclosure to form a weather ish proof seal? If so does anyone have any suggestions that will work with magnets?

Thanks

I'm not too worried about that. Just confused about howhat to connect them. I've looked around and cant find my answer, should I have 2 in series 6s 5200mah  (and if I do will I still get the 5200 from each pack) or in parralel for extra amp discharge 
 3s 10400mah. Would be great if you knew haha

## \#30 Posted by: Lightboard Posted at: 2016-08-13T22:33:38.252Z Reads: 88

If you were to put them in series as in 6s, then the capacity will be 5200mah overall, not in each pack. If you were to want a higher capacity then the option would to get two 10000mah batteries at 6s for example and then wire them in parallel which will make the overall pack 20000mah and 6s. Hope that helps :slight_smile:
