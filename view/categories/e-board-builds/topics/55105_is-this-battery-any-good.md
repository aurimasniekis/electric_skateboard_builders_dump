There have been many posts about this. In general, it's not that good. If you want many mAh, yes, but the C rating is false - it's more like 2-3c (lots of voltage sag).

This one is _much_ better. I switched from 25c to 45c. 
The 45c battery has far less voltage sag and way more punch to it. It also gave me more range. 
I've got no regrets. :slight_smile:

Are you limited in space? While you can run on a single 6S you'll get better results with 3x 2s batteries in series

I got the 2x 5200mah 6s versions of those and ran them in parallel. I can definitely confirm after 3.8v theres a lot of voltage sag. but from 4.2v-3.8v its not that noticeable. and i got some pretty steep hills where I live and I can go up most of them. but if im going full speed then want to go up a steep hill it would'nt preform very well.

If you can I would buy different batteries

I was thinking in putting 2 in series to try the mtb
then I would parallel another pair to extend the range
What do you guys think?

I dont know anything about mtb but i'd assume you'd need to climb some decent hills and need high amps which those batterys wont be to good at

It's better if you put your packs in parallel first, then series. That way your batteries will always balance themselves.

On a mtb you definitely need a much higher discharge rate. HK lipos C ratings are exagerated, a 60C might only deliver 18-20C so you definitely need more packs. @Namasaki has a very good lipo setup so you just take a look at his build

i just bought those multistar ones but in a 10ah version. haven't had a chance to test em yet but even if they suck, they were ment to be backups anyway

Hello everybody can I use this cell to build a 10s battery with 50A ?

No, those are meant for tablets. 

It has protection circuitry and because of that and other factors a low charge and discharge rating.

I was using Multistar 4s 10000mAh to get 12s (3x4s) and I HIGHLY NOT recommend those batteries. That "10C" is far away from reality.
I used them under 50A load only and they puffed already. So...no, they are not good :slight_smile:
