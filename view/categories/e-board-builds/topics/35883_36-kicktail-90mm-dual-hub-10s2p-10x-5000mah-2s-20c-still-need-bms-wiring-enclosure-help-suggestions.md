Hello! I am just starting to pick out my parts for my first Electric Longboard build. I am in an area with absolutely no hills and wanted quiet motors so HUB motors were my best fit.

**Deck:** http://www.ehlerslongboards.com/index.php/customize-your-own-kicktail-10-x-40-deck.html
**HUB Motors:** http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-558.html
**ESC:** http://www.diyeboard.com/upgraded-v21-dual-hub-motor-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-610.html
or http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-bldc-motor-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-for-diyeboard-p-522.html (Not sure which to get)
**Battery:** https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-2s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html (10 packs in a 10s2p configuration) - I also need to order the correct connectors to create the 10s2p configuration. 
I was told I'll need 5 of these to make 5 of the packs into a 10s equivalent? https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-series-adapter-1pc.html
**BMS:** ???
**Enclosure:** ???

For the BMS, I'm not entirely sure what I am looking for as in features besides charging correctly/safely.
For the enclosure, I chose 2s1p packs to keep it thin and I want to keep that in the casing. The maple deck won't flex very much so I was going to try and run a skinny case all the way down the center. 
My goal is to make it look thin and clean. I want people to look at it and not realize that it's electric (no chunky box on the bottom). 

Or I could just get this chunky kit and make my life a little easier: http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-360wh-batteryescpower-truck-kit-dual-9052mm-hub-motors-p-598.html

Any and all suggestions are appreciated! Thanks guys!

Yeah he built it with hill climb power in mind but everything is done in detail for wiring up the bms.

Thanks! This helps me out with the wiring. I want to try and see how much I can do with connectors before having to cut anything open. It will make switching the cells later easier.
