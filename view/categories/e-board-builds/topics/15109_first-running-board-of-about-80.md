So this is the working prototype  of the boards being built for our base in Korea. Background: Amwrican military in Korea of certain ranks may not drive a car and rely on Taxi's that cost min 3$ per ride up to 2 miles  after 2 miles the price increases tremendously. SO after getting my hands on a couple  thousand 18650 batteries  from valence I decided  to build an electric vehicle  that could be sold after you left to the next person  comming here. My supervision  bought  the evolve carbon longboard and I was hooked. I studied  engineering at the FH Trier in Germany and thought  it would be an easy task to out perform his board. So here we are. Generic deck, 36-60V step down converter leds on front and back (so security  forces  dont get their panties in a bunch),  6354 sk3 motor single motor (for now my second diy skateboard  vesc died at motor setup), 36t 15mm pulleys 3d printed, gullwing sidewinder2, motor mounts 3d printed, battery enclosure  3d printed  ( unfinished), 84 18650 lifepo4  batteries in 14s6p. Single  motor top  speed out performs the evolve carbon board with  2 identical riders. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/8/58bd724da3b9c27692446664ae73cca784934138.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/8/1889481600a0bcbaf6e305d80377691f021afd81.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/5/a5c09a90bf961ab6cff2e971a984c3a258b0ac02.jpg" width="666" height="500">

14s? What kv is your motor? I think the VESC is only designed to go up to 12s.

Lifepo batterys are fully charged at 3.6V. Li-ion are fully charged at 4.2V. So 14S Lifepo has the same maximum voltage as 12S li-ion at 50.4V

The case parts are printing nicely top will be abs and the bottom will pla.

Nice project.
Gotta get pretty nice range on it.
But how is the durability of the 3d printed motor mounts?

The range is awesome I charge it once a week to go to work. The motor mounts seem to be holding up great. I've printed these in pla but ordered carbon infused nylon for the other people's  boards.
