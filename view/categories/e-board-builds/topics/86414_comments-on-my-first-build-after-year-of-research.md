Hi All! I've been looking around on the site for the past year or so but never got to build my own board. Just got the money for it (poor college student) so now I'm gonna start my first build. Would love to get your thoughts on it. What should I watch out for? For trucks, should I get 44 degrees or 50 degrees? Would anyone know if this build will work? Would appreciate suggestions for a deck and enclosure at the bottom. Also willing to buy second hand parts. Bought everything already except for the trucks, deck and enclosure because I want to measure everything first and find a fitting deck.

Keep in mind that with only 24 cells your breaking power will be a bit limited, then again with only 1 motor I doubt you'll be skating on busy streets alongside cars, so should be good enough for cruising, as long as you feel fine with charging batteries at 2x their rated charge rate :stuck_out_tongue:

I will suggest looking at looking at alternative motor mounts as from experience the turnigy motor mounts are designed for specifically the turnigy trucks. If you want a certain mount position you will need to re-machine the clamp to fit caliber trucks etc. I would suggest looking at alternative motor mounts such as @Boardnamics who will be in stock in a couple of week, which are also cheap for such quality. I currently use turnigy trucks and they are a great deal, although you will need to replace the bushings to aftermarket ones.

I skate on busy streets alongside cars all the time with one motor.  There is nothing inherently wrong with single-motor if it's done correctly.

In fact, in some ways, it's better if you consider that the less parts you have, the less parts there are to break and malfunction.

Fair enough, I suppose dual motor could even be seen as more dangerous because of one wheel suddenly slipping out. When it happened to me I just remembered thinking "guess this is why people prefer dual over single", although it might be that the opposite is true. I'm in no position to say which is more reliable :upside_down_face:

Or you could look at a dual set up as having redundancy. If you run split ppm and one motor or ESC dies then you can keep going home. 

Biggest thing for me about a dual set up is not power but the brakes.

This is the exact same remote and cheaper($18). I have 2 of these.

I'd say in that regard, if you want to go dual, dual diagonal is better because if/when your drive wheels loose traction in the rain, or you lock them up to brake, et cetera, than you still have one wheel per truck that is steering.

And dual diagonal with two separate ESCs connected each to their own receiver and no CANBUS.
