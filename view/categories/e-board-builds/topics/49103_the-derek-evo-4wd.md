In honor of Derek 
I was hestiant on making this build
Carvon Speed R 4x
12s6p 30q BMS bypassed built by @barajabali
Landyatch evo deck 
Abec 107's superfly
Focbox 4x
Bushings are riptide 96a double barrel and shortcranks as well with riptide cones 96a
Enclosure was from @pychotiller
Things about this build a lot a lot of custom soldering needed to be made , everything was a tight fit  I couldn't fit focbox side to side so I stacked them 2 on each side with a parallel connector not sure if that's dangerous I used 10awg wire with concern with long wires and making a big resistance. 
Landyatch evo and big batteries don't go well everything is tight fit and I have okay clearance I just have to be carefull while riding. Planning to buy 6 shooters to see how that goes

sweet 4wd carvon Evo dude!

I would have thought barrels and fat cones at 96a would be too much for 165 pounds...

I stand corrected

I feel its perfectly fine , I like it no speed wobbles and  I have okay turning

Yeah I have a dual diagonal that I lengthened the power cables rather than the phase wires. One of the power cables is about 16" long

Yeah for me it's power cable -> xt90 y splitter that I solderd making cables medium length -> 2 xt90 parallel connectors , all my cables were 10awg I saw a post about lenthing phase wires is bad and can cause troubles if using foc which I am. Also I was going to use 12awg but saw another post about how having a really long cable can create resistance and have troubles in foc or power delivery

Thatâ€™s basically Derekâ€™s board ðŸ˜”. You should name this board after him

You are right I already ordered griptape with his name on it ! Yes this build was 95% done because of Derek as you read at the top , I was hesitant to build this build, my only reason to making this build was to race Derek but he passed away and I figured I'd finish it in his honor . Derek conviced me to make it to begin with as a race. The only reason I didn't want to say anything about Derek was just the fear of  back lash but that's why I never said anything sorry @Mikenopolis you are right

I read another post and it said that the power cables are what messes with foc because of the voltage spikes along the longer cables. It can be mitigated by using more capacitors

yeah but I heard a better solution was just to use thicker guage wire so I did I used 10awg

Are you using the modded GT2B. After riding his boards using them I changed all my remotes to them. Best advice ever

2wd I have no clue 4wd I think 62mph weighted around 50ish I feel if I'd gone a vesc 6 I'd have a higher top speed anyone with a 2wd wana chime in

Well you have 4 focbox.  You're splitting the amp draw so the capability will be within the limits of the focbox.  It shouldn't be the limiting factor.  Just voltage sag.  However 12s6p with a full battery shouldn't be much.  I just pulled 111A on my 12s6p (mostly full charge) and didn't see much sag.![IMG_4603|281x500](upload://9jZQXIeJ8ERqkUwrcpFRSZAUoAp.jpg)

Yeah but I want to push to 37on bat and 110motors but I don't want to fry anything those were Derek's settings for 4wd  he had a 25r 12s6p
I have a 12s6p 30q I can pull more amps but I am playing it safe for now on 30bat and 60motors 
Tried 35bat and 80motors was a lot faster can't imagine 110 on motors

Which is weird because I have my motor Max at 80 but it never gets above 70 so more motors would be even less.  Unless you do bindings or hang onto board...

Ive topped out around 41mph on this build because I feel am a little baby its going so fast and it Still has a lot of throttle left. And this is with 60amps per motor. But am still trying to figure out that ermp sweet spot they were talking about because it's like anti lag boost kicking in from 28mph and launches to me 35mph

I noticed that as well at a slightly lower speed than yours I think when it kicks in.  I love it

Am debating on running foc sensors or foc sensorless am running foc sensorless and anyone know the difference is there a loss in performance. I have ran bldc hybrid before but never foc sensord what's the diffrence ?

I think u get a smooth startup with less chance of cogging.

Is there a loss in performance because foc doesn't have hybrid if I recall, running sensord is bad at high speeds for such hybrid was created but I never saw the option of foc hybrid

I've heard top speed is lower but if it winds up top speed is 51 instead of 53?  Who knows till you try both.  It's not going to break 60mph loaded so Who knows
