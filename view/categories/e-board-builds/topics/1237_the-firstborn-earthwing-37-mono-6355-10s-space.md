I've recently finished my first eboard build. Thank you to this forum for the inspiration, knowledge, and support. And thank you to the vendors who are making great products more attainable. I too got interested after seeing the boosted board, and even more interested after riding one. I knew I could build one. 

Materials: 
Earthwing Muirderer 37 kicktail
DIYES welded motor mount paris trucks
DIYES 6355 230kv motor
DIYES 12s 120A ESC
Enertion SPACE cell 10s3p battery
Psychotiller 17" low pro enclosure
Wiiceiver & Nyko Kama
83mm flywheels

So far I've only put about 40 miles on the board. I've experienced zero signal loss from the wiiceiver and used silicone to secure the connections. I did lose a couple motor mount screws during testing, have since used loctite. I made a thick, multi-layer, rubber gasket for the needed additional space in the enclosure, and to dampen vibrations.
