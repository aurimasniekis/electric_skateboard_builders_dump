Wow, great job!  Bill is an awesome builder and has a lot of good wood working projects too.   Good place to look for 107s when the stock is getting low ;-)

How does it ride?  Love the pics!!  You have gone all in on the under lighting lol

If you ever get tired of it or want to sell it to move on to another project, please hit me up! I have a soft spot for all things carbon fiber.

I just ordered my Mauna 44". Am excited to start this new project. I think this deck will become more and more popular in the esk8 community.
