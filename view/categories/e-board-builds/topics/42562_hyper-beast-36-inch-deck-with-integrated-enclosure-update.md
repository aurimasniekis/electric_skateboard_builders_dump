## **HYPER BEAST - 36"inch DECK WITH INTEGRATED ENCLOSURE**

Hi Guys. Everything best for all of you in 2018 !!. 
The hole story here is basically a followup on a topic I've created over a year ago. I never actually updated it so I thought I'd create a new topic to show you what I've come up with. 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/stealth-bomber-31-5-custom-deck-12s2p-26650-cell-single-carvon-v2-5-chaka-vesc/6475?u=naf

So from the begining I'd been working on this project together with a friend of mine who has a lot of expertise on building wakeboards and wakeskates.  Together we have done a bunch of prototypes of our deck with different combinations of carbon fiber, foam, wood, aluminium...to ultimately come up with the right combination of wooden core, fiber glass and carbon fiber. 

## **My main goals for building the deck were as follows:**

- Create a deck inspired by my two favourite decks of all time: JET POTATO and his older brother JET SPUD. 
- Improve the overall shape and the looks so it doesn't look like DIY and more like a high end manufactured commercial board. 
- Have better kicktail 
- Use no screws for the lid, make it easy to open, with quick access to electronics.
- I travel a lot so it was important for me to be able to quickly swap batteries or take them out at the airport. 
- Ditch the plasticky feel of carbon fiber finish on favour of covering cf in all black matte paint. 

So that's about it. I really love what I've come up with, the hole black matte paint looks just freaking gorgeous.

**_ ___IMPORTANT:____**
I hope there will be enough people here interested in the deck, as we will need to form a small group to get this thing going.  There are many moving parts here but I am working on this project really hard.  
This week I have a meeting with a facility that has huge commercial grade CNC machine, and I'll know their MOQ -  minimum order quantity to get this thing off the ground and I'll be able to come back to you all with the final price for the deck. 

I'll be updating tomorrow with the graphs showing you inner dimensions for all the electronics.

- with nice kicktail in the back.

I'm VERY interested. I know it's early, but any idea of what kind of pricing and timeline we'd be looking at? Will that enclosure be water tight?

I'd also love a 29-31"-ish size as well, if you were considering doing multiple sizes. I find under 31" fits into most large sized suit cases, but just barely.

Guys thanks a lot for your feedback !!

## Button solution for the deck
To address button concerns,I've just talked to my partner, and wanted to let you know what we've decided. The button that's on the image is about 6.5cm wide. The one that's going to be used will be about 2.5cm wide so it's going to be super tiny. Not only it will be smaller but we will add additional depth under the lid where the button area is and that will allow us to countersunk the button, so it will be nicely hidden.

just a thought... if you can push the button far enough forward you could make it taller, and use it as a foot stop. So rather than stepping on it. You push your foot against it. Give it some grip... If you can make it work it would be cool.
```

The button can't go any further than that..but to be honest this is the way I am riding right now with my foot stance.. I use it as a foot stop and not only it doesn't bother me it's pretty useful :slight_smile: ..anyway ..the solution for the button is going to nicely hide the button, so that's about it.

## \#24 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-01-02T14:16:35.191Z Reads: 832

The button, is a little to far behind the trucks to be used as a foot stop... I'd definitely suggest recessing it and using a standard foot stop further forward.

Nice board! I have another idea for the button: if you leave enough counter sink around the button you could hide the whole thing under the tape. There might be just enough flex in the tape to depress the button.

## \#48 Posted by: NAF Posted at: 2018-01-04T15:47:58.529Z Reads: 712

## Guys quick update on DIMENSIONS:

We wanted the enclosure to be as wide as possible to be able to fit also other battery setups than only regular 2 row layouts. Basically with the BMS on top you should be able to fit anything from 10s4p to 12s4p. The depth is 32mm. Please bare in mind there are hinges inside enclosure and small button mount, which take up very little space but may obstruct your layout. You can of course freely use space around the button mount as well as space between hinges.

```

---
## \#50 Posted by: NAF Posted at: 2018-01-04T16:00:34.449Z Reads: 673

```
The way I would describe the deck is that it feels very similar to JET POTATO or JET SPUD. With such big enclosure you obviously can't have any flex in the middle section...but it is not as stiff as pure carbon fiber decks. With all wooden core this deck dampens vibrations really nice.

It's probably too late for this iteration and this is something more of a personal preference. But if the lid was positioned towards the rear instead of the front, would allow for a binding, it still might be possible I don't know and I don't know the structural impact of moving the lid

Why do you sound angry Ben ? The reason I am not putting out price yet is that I want to be responsible here and I don't want to throw out a number out of thin air. I never wanted this deck to be expensive piece of art that sits in a museum. To come up with what I think would be affordable price there is no room for mistakes on my part.  Just as I wrote a few post earlier I need to sit down with CNC guys upcoming week to know their minimum order quantity as well as I need to pin down other details. So please allow me to do my thing here.

It looks like a really stunning product and a lot of people will want it but I have a suspicion that not everyone has an understanding of what something like this will cost to produce.

Guys finally I have some news. We‚Äôve managed to get an awesome deal with CNC place and that‚Äôs just massive thing for us. Being able put our hands on high end CNC machine is just awesome. This basically means that in the future we will be able to make other sizes than 36‚Äù like 33‚Äù 30‚Äù or 28‚Äù.

**_PRICE UPDATE:_**
As for the price we want to go as low as we can for the first few batches and price the deck at **199 EUR**. The price will eventually go up in the future and settle probably around 250EUR but at this point we want to keep it as low as possible for early supporters and have the first batches made for **_199EUR._** 

**_SHIPPING:_**
All decks will be made and shipped from POLAND which basically means no problems with VAT for EU customers. Shipping anywhere else to the US or wherever would be done with UPS. I‚Äôll be checking the rates some time next week, but Poland has a lot of affordable shipping options to choose from.

I am not taking any orders yet as there is still some things I need to take care of, like for example finding a place that can do tig welding for the lid to hide the button as well as some other stuff like finding workshop that would be able to make custom made drill bit for counter sinking the button, and so on. But I hope to resolve this soon. The most important thing was to find the right CNC place and I am super stoked about that.

He does not charge VAT in EU, so the price is already without VAT. If you buy from outside EU it will be 199 and you will have to sort out the VAT wherever you live. If you're lucky you will pass the customs without damage, that's a chance to take.

Guys I need some help and info from all of you who are using BELT DRIVES... I am a hub guy myself so I never worry about any additional space around my motor... but I need to know how big are your motor mounts  

**a) from the middle of the axle to the end of your mount ??** 
**b) how much space is usually left from the bottom of the deck to your motor mount ??**  

I need to make sure that the enclosure won't cause any problems for you when mounting your motors.

Haha !! Dude it's your's ? ..nice. ! This is exactly what I need to figure out ... how much space do you guys need for your mounts so if you could take your measurements for comparison it would help a lot ......the enclosure on the BEAST is sticking out at about **21mm from the bottom of the deck**.. Right now I am considering making two different decks ..one with wider enclosure for HUB motors and one with less space for belt setups. One thing I am pretty sure is I won't be making deck for 4wd setups as I'd have to make it exactly as you suggest - with a lot of space from both ends. Besides that I am pretty sure 4wd setup won't look good with this deck.

Hey, of course, smaller sizes than 36"inch will have smaller battery compartments but there is a way around that ..and we can have the enclosure about 37mm to fit two rows of cells.  For now I am concentrating on finishing 36"inch deck first... and later in the future I'll redesign it for smaller sizes like 30" or 33" inch.

I don't know how much experience you have from taking concepts to production(I have a very limited experience of that) but if you don't, I suggest starting out with only one deck.

It's a lot to keep track of and you might discover issues in the infancy of production that takes more money/time you're willing to give. It is better to not double that.

Just my two cents :slight_smile: Looking forward to get my hands on a deck!

True that ..and I'd rather have one deck to begin with than two different enclosure models. 
I'll be posting here pool for you guys to vote and we will see if current reworked dimensions of the enclosure will suit your needs and allow you mounting your motors. Belt guys can use truck risers to get some additional height for mounting the motors and hub guys can enjoy benefits of CNC wheel wells without the need of risers.

Personally, and I am not everyone. Put as much space as you can for batteries dude. If people want stealth they will have hubs... other wise you are just compromising performance.

If this goes to production and I buy one, I have committed. It will have the smallest battery of any of my decks.

Would it be possible to add a few extra mounting holes towards the end of the kicktail to provide extra clearance for motor mounts? It looks like the deck gets a little thicker toward the kicktail so maybe just making a flat spot under that thick part would allow for truck mounting and the thickness would act like a built in riser, with the trade-off of losing the kicktail. I hope that makes sense.

Guys sorry for the wait !!!!!!!!!  we were so freakin busy that I didn‚Äôt wanted to post any none sense here until I have final update for you !!

**FINAL UPDATE**

_ Production has started as of today. 
_ We will be making only **10 decks** in the first batch, as we don't want to take too many orders just as we start. 
_ All 10 decks should be ready to ship by the **end of next month.** 
_ Next batch after that will be a lot bigger and will be about **20-30** decks.

We had to slightly rework the size of electronic compartment to make a bit more space for motor mounts.

- final dimensions are : **155 width x 520 length and 33mm of depth.**

![battery_Setup|419x500](upload://khhRWAp5zcounIYnt3SsNHvJr7E.jpg)


HUB MOTORS:
- This deck with hubs looks awesome and you won't need any truck risers. You can enjoy the benefits of cnc wheel wells. 

BELT MOUNTS:
- as for motor mounts it‚Äôs still pretty tight there, so think twice about your mounts and measurements, but first take a look at the image for final dimensions:
![trucki|540x310](upload://tEEmAamnl9vVPFTNJa9KqwtEwqt.jpg)

To get some more space you will have to use angled truck risers and maybe move the trucks a little bit more to the back. 

**_We need is ten people for the first batch. Those who want the deck just send me DM_**
**_with following information :_**

HYPER BEAST - FIRST BATCH <-------in the title
- YOUR NAME
- YOUR LOCATION  ( I‚Äôll check shipping rates )

We will start taking payments by the end of this week. 

I'll be back tomorrow with some more info.

Thank you guys !! I'll be checking shipping rates and I'll PM you back. We are now experimenting with two different gaskets , one is micro rubber gasket and the other one is polyurethane foam...will see which one will do better however from my own experience I can tall you that it's pretty hard for the water to get in. The lid is tightly fit with the deck and there is about 1mm of space around the lid, but that's were the gasket is going under. In real life testing with prototype decsk - when riding in rain or through puddles I had no issues with water and I was using super thin foam gasket so at the end with much wider gasket I don't expect this to be an issue.

We had to shorten inner total length by 2cm, so unfortunately 12s4p will be too big.....but if you had the inner height slightly bit bigger of 36-37mm would that work for you ? you could stack two rows of cells. This is something we consider doing. The width and length dimensions are fixed ,however we can try to do something with the height as this is the only dimension that we might be able to change just in case someone needs something slightly larger.

Guys quick update on the shipping:

Shipping to anywhere in **EUROPE** looks really good - UPS and DPD gave me quotes of mostly **30EUR** with some countries being more expensive like Ireland where the price is around **35EUR**.   

Shipping to **United States** is a bit more challenging EMS - gave me quote of **50EUR** and UPS **60EUR**....however I've found something interesting ..POLISH NATIONAL POST - has their own offer for shipping to the US - their online price list says that their **ECONOMY shipping with insurance is : 25EUR** and their **PRIORITY shipping: 35EUR** ...this seems really f*cking good . I'll be calling them today to see if they can provide tracking number for their services and double check how long does it take them to ship. 

Anyway stay tuned... I'll be DM'ing everyone today with their shipping rates.

Guys so far everything is on schedule so everything should be ready by the end of next month. All decks are already cut, and enclosures are being assembled this week.Three of you have double stacked enclosures with 38mm and all the rest have regular slim ones with 33mm of depth. Next week is the most important one as it's all about laying layers of carbon fiber. After that we move on with sanding and matte paint job. 

There is one thing that will be changed - it's the grip tape. The grip tape on the images I've posted was graphite Madrid grip tape, were as the final grip will be black, from Black Diamond Griptape. 

Some of you have asked about HYPER BEAST letter cut outs. We can cut the grip with the letters or without them. Let me know how you want it. I'd rather strongly suggest keeping the letters - that's the whole beauty guys.   

**SHIPPING OPTIONS:**
Guys I‚Äôve just sent everyone your shipping options / if someone didn't get DM from me let me know here. 

Everything in Europe or to nearby countries will be shipped with **DPD Express** as it's cheap and fast. As for shipping to other countries the best and cheapest option is Priority Airmail by Polish Post. I‚Äôve double checked with them and they offer both tracking and insurance as well as really reasonable timeframe for delivery - usually around 7 working days which probably translates to about 1.5 week in real time. I also have sent you express options for shipping with **EMS - express shipping** - their shipping is faster usually around 4-5 days, but substantially more expensive. 

Important notice: All shipping rates were calculated for packages for up to 3KG. If it happens that the package is slightly heavier at the end after we put it in bubble wrap and cardboard, we will have to add + - a few euro more, so I‚Äôll be updating everyone by the end of march with the exact weight for the package. 

**Paypal:**
Payments options DM'ed to you.

Guys I want to thank everyone of you who helped out with Paypal payments, it was crucial to keep this project on schedule. Today we are ordering all vacuum materials. Everything is supposed to be shipped on Monday and we should get our hands on all the fabrics on Tuesday - vacuum process should start on Wednesday next week. The awesome thing is we've managed to get really "ok" quotes on carbon fabrics. The most interesting thing is that my manufacturing partner has chosen really interesting materials, like Multiaxial CF as well as pieces of Kevlar to reinforce some parts on the bottom of the deck. This is different to what we did in the final prototype where we've used Regular Twill Cf but we want to use premium materials to make those decks really robust.
 
Next update will be next week with more info on how the process is going.

ONE MORE THING:
The only part where we will "CUT CORNERS" is the top aluminum lid. The lid itself is super sturdy and can take a lot of abuse, but we had to cut corners a little bit when it comes to painting it. Normally to have the aluminum properly painted black it should be powder coated which is just too expensive. We will sand it instead and use special aluminum base coat that we will cover with black paint. The thing is that the lid on the top is all covered with grip tape anyway but we need to get that nice black look underneath the Hyper Beast letter cut outs. The lid on the bottom side after you open the deck could be left with original aluminum colour but I think it will just look better to have it all painted black. So in real life we actually don't see the lid colour except for the cutouts, therefore there was no need to have it powder coated.

I have no idea about prices but have you considerred getting the lid hard anodized? Paint is not very tough compared to powder coat and HA, and I expect it to show wear pretty quickly.

I'm okay with paint!

it would be too raw ..too much contrast between cut outs and the black grip tape. Look at my images in the first post. The black beneath the grip is so good :smiley:    The key to the beauty is having it ALL BLACK ..black matte paint on the finish, black griptape that gives nice texture when put next to the matte paint, and at the end black aluminum shinning within the cut outs :slight_smile: That's how I see it :slight_smile:

Beautiful work BTW,
How functional is the Kicktail? I am still slightly worried about water leakage from rain on top of the deck.  

Excited to see how this progresses

@ohhnnoo

Joel, Yes I am moving to California this year, in June-July, I'll be there for at least next 2-3 years. however all decks will be still made in Poland.  The good thing is that, being in Cali, I can arrange shipping several decks at one address and later hand deliver them to people who live nearby. 

Kicktail is awesome, one of my favs decks is Jet Spud / Potato which Hyperbeast shape was inspired by, but I never liked kicktail on these models, so I wanted to have it fully functional on Hyperbeast, and it's really great. 

Second batch will start at the end of April, and should be ready by the end of May.

UPDATE: Buttons have arrived today !! Big difference in size. The button is actually thinner than I thought, which is awesome as we don't need to weld additional layer of aluminum underneath. We can nicely counter sink the button without the extra layer of aluminum. One thing though that I've noticed. Because the button is smaller the spring inside the button is also smaller which may cause the lid not to "pop out" as much as it used to with the older button. What we will try to do instead is I'll look for additional spring that we will mount on the stud, this should do the trick - this should kick out the lid nicely after the button is released. More info tomorrow.

Hey NAF,

I am likely down for 1 board in your second batch, hopefully we can get them to CA for a reasonable price. 

One item to note for water-related damages: My Acton Blink S2 has a power button located on the underside of the enclosure. It appears that water has either penetrated around the button gap, or along the gasket damaging the electronics inside. I do not know how the Hyperbeast would fare if there was rain or slight puddling at the top of the board but I am sure you are addressing this as best you can.

Thanks again and I am excited to see how Hyperbeast v1 turns out

Guys quick update with some photos.

Carbon fiber. The one on the right is thick multiaxial CF. The one on the left is silky smooth cf with spread fibers for nice finish. Underneath goes what's commonly named by our seller "kevlar" but the real name is vectran. It's to protect most crucial parts of the deck. 
![IMG_6307|690x486](upload://vHzIZR7A80eJeqcg4iayIadd6fE.JPG)  

Vacuum process:
![IMG_6299|690x486](upload://bbI7LnXIVfcSJbjH7uYnoEuBaKk.JPG)

Straight out of vacuum bag, and it looks great, it looks exactly like on the first renderings we did over a year ago. Bear in mind that the perfect look is achieved by sanding, and painting everything black matte. So there is still shit load of work to do.

UPDATE: Today we have received italian piston hinges we were waiting for.. but unfortunately we were sent only 10 of them, due to shortage of supply. We were promised to get next batch within a week. So far last thing we need to get is grip tape. But that's for next week. 

UPDATE: I have like 15 unanswered messages, sorry guys I promise I'll take care of that this weekend. So don't worry I'll answer to all your PM's. 

Next upcoming days are crucial, there is a lot of sanding sanding sanding sanding....did I say sanding ? After that we will start painting and we need to apply clear coat at the end. Today we also need to drill holes for hinges. 

Be back with more update in a few days . Stay tuned.

Guys quick update !!! 

Vacuum process is finished and all decks are wrapped in CF, we are finishing sanding and we are preparing everything for painting next week. We had some trouble with our compressor this past weekend, but hopefully after it was taken apart and put back it works flawlessly five days in a row now. Next week monday-tuesday we are drilling holes, sanding lids and making them ready for being painted, we want to start painting all decks around thursday-friday next week. After painting we need to asamble everything together and pack it for shipping.

One thing we need to investigate more is our new options for paint. Originally we have planned to go with the regular route which is : 3 layers of polyurethane paint, with little sanding in-between and than 2 layers of polyurethane clear coat as scratch protection. However one of our paint dealers offered us two totally new different kinds of paint which he claims are a lot better than the polyurethane. One is supposed to be super durable, while the other one is supposed to be totally scratch proof !! Sounds too good to be true, so we need to see it with our own eyes before we make any decisions here. 

PHOTO UPDATE:
BEASTS after sanding, covered with resin for further sanding. This reminds me how much I hate the look of shiny carbon fiber. Looks so plasticky. You are going to love the beasts after we paint them matte black.

PS. I did some weighing today, I didn‚Äôt have the lid with me but the weight was around 2.2 KG. Really, really nice given the fact we have 9PLY deck with fibreglass layups on top and three layers of carbon fiber on bottom. Of course after the paint is applied and the lid is attached, there will be some more weight to it, but so far so good.

@deucesdown I think double stacked ones are a bit bulkier..as we have 38mm of internal height for electronics +3mm for the lid on top and 3mm for the bottom cover. So in total they are around 44mm...but truth be told when all the decks are put next to each other it is really hard to tell which is wich and even I need to measure them inside to make sure which are the big ones...but wait after the black matte paint finish is done ! All decks will go in NINJA mode. This makes all the difference in the world.

We don't know yet ! Initially we have planned to start the new batch sometime in may....however in the meanwhile we have been working on 4 new decks that will serve as bigger brothers for HyperBeasts. They will be totally different and much much bigger around 41"inches...one of the shapes is inspired by LandYachtz Evo, and those decks will be opened from the bottom. We will decide in may.

Would be very interested in the LY Evo deck.  You have any renderings or computer designs you could share a pic of?  Why are you going with bottom openings for the other ones?  I imagine it must be easier with keeping the decks flex and structural integrity in tact...

Guys this is PRE FINAL update, big sorry for the wait, we were supposed to post on Sunday but had to wait for more paint samples until today so I could give you full status.

By thursday last week we have completed all the lids, we had some troubles as almost every single aluminum lid that we have ordered was either 1mm or 2mm too big - it was kind of expected by us and was caused by the cutting margin of +-2mm tolerance. We had to manually recut all the decks in order to properly fit them. The good thing is the end result is really really good now. All the lids are tight fitted across the hole length of the lid.
For those who were worried about painting aluminum, all the lids were heavily sanded and we have found awesome resin base coat that was applied first, after it cured we have painted it with black matte polyurethane paint. It all looks great and keeps the paint well. 

We have received our last batch of piston hinges. We had, drilled all holes in the lids, and have applied new Black Dimond Grip tape. 

After the lids were finished we started testing out those paint options I‚Äôve mentioned earlier. I had super high hopes for that scratch proof paint as it is really jaw dropping in terms of durability !!!! You can hit it with a rock, knife or you can poke it with hard nail and it is 100% bullet proof. That durable paint that we have found is similar alternative to LINE X brand. Just watch those videos guys:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG0xjYEsMvQ

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjC-u8xv0FM




As you can see this paint is just nuts. But there is one major flaw, it has some sort of TEXTURE to it that looks like this:



![22|690x396](upload://fkWJHqrlAhcEf1b2yFzMZwwyb4h.jpg)

At best even after we have applied 10% paint thinner to it, and used different air pressure the texture is still there and looks more like the texture above on the right. I really wanted to love this paint as this would something totally new ESK8T but I can't get rid of the feeling that it looks still like a cheap plastic. However I think that someone should contact CARVON Jerry - as this is the right solution for his HUB MOTORS. His powder base black paint starts to chip after a few rides but this thing will protect his cans greatly !!

At the end we went with one more test but with a line of paints used for YACHTS industry and damn !! We have found the right paint. It looks beautiful and will be durable !! See some samples below.  We have order a 3-PACK that consists of :

- POLlYESTER FILLER this is a base coat, that goes over the carbon fiber, and creates smooth surface for painting.
- EPOXY-POLIURETHANE black matte paint 
- POLIURETHANE CLEAR COAT for Yachts. 
 
This is our final decision for paint. However I want to hear your opinion on that bulletproof paint. Maybe I am just biased. **Maybe you guys like it ???? Just let me know.** 

Guys I know I am behind the schedule, as I promised the decks should be all ready by now. The paint that we have ordered will be in stock in about two weeks from now. I am sorry about that but I hope you do understand. Meanwhile while we are waiting for the paint we need to have our air compressor serviced as it is constantly jamming recently so that's a good thing as it will be fully ready when the paint arrives. We are 80% done and this project is coming to an end.  

LIDS heavily sanded and prepped for painting - they used to shine like mirrors before that.

I have a question regarding lid. How thick is it and what alloy. Are you sure it won't bend? Especially when it's not fixed to deck in any way by the long sides of it?

Isn't that Line X stuff just some colored epoxy that hardens after some time? The trick being that they mix the two components during the spraying and you have to be super careful to not clog the nozzle.

I've been using Rhino/Line-X for years on Jeeps.  It really is bullet proof, looks awesome and it impenetrable to road grime and wipes clean with a little soapy water...except that if you get a cut in a place that gets rubbed a lot it will peel like tape.  So maybe not a good ide for decks.

No worry about going over schedule. Im pretty sure, everyone would rather have higher quality products than a rushed one. I really like the double texture of this design you posted earlier. Paint on the bottom and carbon on the edge and wheel cutout. Do you think you can do it for mine? It seems like there will be a lot more labor. 
![IMG_5681|566x343](upload://4IplBzE7xDtUepTZouuVk7oKtGj.PNG)

But that will reduce the durability on the edge huh?  Ahhhhh what to do, the rendering looks so pretty tho.

We ‚Äòve picked up our order of paint as of yesterday and we are now in full throttle mode to finish all beasts. This project is coming to an end and I want to have all beasts done by the end of upcoming week.

Ok ..let's go back in time step by step.

**1. First we have painted all the decks with polyester.** Polyester 
did an awesome job in filling all the gaps and smallest micro holes in the carbon fiber. 
It gave the whole deck that smooth touch, but there was so much sanding I can't even tell you. The thing with polyester is..is that you don't want the layer to be too thick. You need to sand off as much as you can to get the layer as thin and as smooth as possible. Also we have added some additional fiber glass to reinforce some parts of the deck like wheel wells or parts where the battery compartment is. I think it took us good week to have everything properly sanded.

fuck loads of sanding:

**2. After polyester was applied and sanded everything had to be covered with nice coat of epoxy base.**

**3. After epoxy cured we had to sand it all over again but this time with about 400-600 grit**  This part of sanding was really important as this was the last time we had chance to get rid of all the imperfections that were left.

![IMG_6431|640x480](upload://ryOnfdsa4FkVgt9pI5wRMOhE5Pk.JPG)

**4. After sanding - nice thin expoxy base was applied again:**

![IMG_6433|640x480](upload://b7iHee0ctgC87qW3KqP7pzv9qT2.JPG)

of course after that epoxy cured we had to sand it again this time with 800 grit. 

**5. After that last base of epoxy was sanded we were ready to paint everything. We have used that hard polyurethane paint for yachts. We have applied two layers of it.**

![IMG_6493|640x360](upload://fnaP2jhkYpenFYrf6Omsq9skskb.JPG)

**6. After paint cured we had to flip over and paint all the tops:**

7. After two layers of paint were applied we had to drill holes for trucks...and that shit was a real challange. 
Normally it's not a big deal at all to drill holes as most of the decks are flat were it's super easy to align everything properly. Because of the battery compartment sticking out and all the curves that the deck has we had to build a freaking template to get it properly done. Again .I was expecting everything to be easy ..were as in reality it took us good three days to make the template properly aligned. 

![IMG_6471|375x500](upload://qqh61yRT4RDQj8zfaAz0DSR4q3e.JPG)

8. After we drilled holes, we have applied last layer of paint to cover all the spots that we drilled. 

![IMG_6490|640x360](upload://dJ5iKPRbxKGdiQBXOHZPLJSCFTO.JPG)![IMG_6491|268x480](upload://eh79wyuyPEEssLqA0Kazm365XTh.JPG)

As you can see guys there is nothing but hard work here and there is nothing I could do to get it made quicker.   Everything had to be as close to perfect as possible before the paint was applied. The only part of the deck I didn't really cared that much about is the TOP of the deck that goes under the grip tape. Also there might be some epoxy drip marks or coarse texture inside the battery compartment but to have it nice and smooth it would take me another year to have it done as nice as the exteriors - it's all covered by the battery and electronics anyway - so please forgive if it looks rough. 

There is also one decision that has to be made....and that is :

**_We need to decide whether we finish everything as it is now were we have nice and smooth polyurethane as it is ...or do we go with one last thin layer of that TANK PROOF car paint I've been posting videos about a while ago._** 

Normally that paint is applied with hard thick COARSE texture where you can literally use a knife and nothing happens... hover meanwhile we were doing all the decks I had received a sample of that paint being painted with 30% thinner and with 1.8 air gun. The result is really really nice. This paint mixed with thinner is obviously not as bullet proof as on those video but it still looks like it should be literally scratch proof against rocks and debris. My gut is telling me that we should try it. I am picking up 50ml of that paint for testing today and I'll try to paint it and see if I can replicate that texture that has been sent to me. Take a look at the photos. That small texture looks really nice, and during my tests I couldn't scratch it.

Boys I'll answer all mail sometime tomorrow. I have f*ck loads of massages unanswered in my mail - I am sorry about that. 

I should be posting new update later on tomorrow. We are in the middle of mounting all lids and assembling everything together.

One more thing !! I've picked up a sample of that scratch proof paint. All I can say at the moment that it is totally different than that polyurethane paint. It is super super thick and dense. To take it out of the box we need to scoop it with a spoon. Polyurethane on the other hand was super liquidy. Anyway ..I have 50ml of that sample and we will use 30% thinner to get it more smooth. I am super curious how it will look like. We want to make a small test sometime tomorrow. I'll be posting images. I want to get rid of the texture.

GUYS QUICK UPDATE : 
- We had to manually cut down 90pieces of m4 screws to about 4mm....one of the most annoying things I've ever done. We needed those screws in order to be able to mount hinges to the lids. 
- All lids with hinges were mounted to the lids and today all lids were mounted to the decks. All lids open beautifully with those italian piston hinges. I am super glad we have managed to fit all the lids as this was my fear of having the lids too big due to 1-2mm cutting margin of each lid. 

TO DO LIST FOR TOMORROW:
- we need to cut down studs for the buttons, and install them inside the decks 
- we need to install all the buttons and properly calibrate them so that they fit the studs. 
- three of the decks need to be painted with Polyurethane as last time there wasn't enough paint 
- run a test with that scratch proof paint

LAST MINUTE TO DO LIST:
- cut and apply grip tape
- pack and ship everything
```

Guys one more info about that paint. I know you like the look of polyurethane but you are underestimating that scratch proof paint. There was no time to test it yet but hopefully tomorrow after we install all the buttons I'll try it out and see what structure can I get out of it. The thing with that paint is that it will basically make all the decks brand new for ever...at least this is what I am hoping for. Will see. I'll make detailed photographs.

Boys update.. per usual silence mean we were busy AF.

- Mounting buttons wasnt easy.

- All buttons were slightly missalinged with the studs. We had to redrill every lid. To properly fit the buttons and match them wih studs. 

- We have ordered new gaskets as previous ones were slightly too thick. 

- We have also ordered new springs that go between studs and buttons.

- All of the above already arrived. 

- In one deck we have damaged accidentally one of the studs, and we need to replace it. Delivery is scheduled on monday.

Long story short: 
- all lids open beautifully now. With springs attached they have that nice pop.

- there are three decks that still need some fine tuning and calibration bit the hardest part was done. 

- On friday we have made decision about the paint. My partner convinced me not to fuck around any more and go with whats proven and looks great which is Poly. We have repainted all decks with one more final layer of poly for clean strong finish. All decks need to cure now before i apply the grip and pack it. 

- I am starting cutting the grip tonight and will be cutting it probably all day long tomorrow.

I ll post images with grip on tuesday and all decks need to be gone this week. Finally!!

I would but...

The original ship date was March 31st, its now the end of June.
Weeks without updates, then sporadic updates but never when Naf said they would be.


I understand the dude is busy, but this ain't 6 bucks worth of heat shrink, this is a substantial amount of money to a new vendor.

I have hesitated making this post for weeks hoping this would play out well, but alas I feel the need to disclose my experience.  I filed a PayPal claim after weeks of no updates and unreturned PM's.  THe next day I got an email from Naf saying they would ship out 6/5 then a couple of short update posts here but still no real info.

PayPal told me, and take this with a grain of salt as we all know PayPal is not the most reliable of operators, "there are serious issues with this account" and approved my claim.

If there is no update in the next day or so with a specific ship date I would advise you folks to start looking into ways of getting a refund...

There is a difference in a kickstarter and a product in this forum, you agree to the chance of not getting your product on kickstarter.

No one did it here, he promised a product at a specific date and has since then been very bad at giving updates.

He can be a bussy as he wants but he should be able to just come online on his phone for 5 min and say (Hey guys its all good) Instead of leaving the customers in the dark.

Noone seem to discuss that here, Every project and group buy has risk. Seen 0 risk analyzes on this forum so far. Proffessionally I know that 80% of all projects get delayed.

It's not about targeting or feelings.  You implied that I was starting a witch hunt and that is absolutely not true, just relating the facts of my personal situation.  I've been waiting over a year for hubs, but the guy making them stays in the loop and keeps us updated so no worries.  

1. When I've got a couple of hundred bucks on the line, I like updates.  I don't think that is unreasonable.  
2. I'm sure the decks are being made and are going to be great, but when someone starts to ghost I get worried.   I don't think that is unreasonable.
3. I sent multiple PM's all of which went unresponded too, I started a PayPal claim and that got a response, but that response proved to be unreliable.  I don't think that is unreasonable

I don't see a witch hunt here...

I am not trying to spread optimism, Im trying to warn other fellow esk8rs that there is something 'not great' going on here.  

And by fellow esk8rs I mean people that have spent money on this...

As far as I can tell you haven't even bought one.  Maybe I'm wrong, but if not you dogging another person who has spent money is a bit ridiculous.  If you have spent money on this, then OK I understand you dont wanna piss the guy off but my motivation is to warn the people that have spent money here.

Also worth noting is that since being on the forum I have seen a lot of sellers make a lot of revisions or create an entirely new product during their group but which can definitely halt progress. I think having the scratch resistant paint would be nice but not worth the unknown wait. So I think that all sellers should focus on selling the one product that they are selling until that is done and then work on innovation

Would guess that's just a name discourse puts on the images after they're uploaded so it can have a smaller version for showing in the thread vs the full 'render' of the same file (probably original is thrown away).  As a web dev you can't really rely on users to appropriately resize images before upload.

Guess is onloop/Jason wouldn't want to get that involved not sure why it helps anyhow.  Also those IP lookup services aren't great they will default to the middle of the US in many cases if they couldn't find a valid geolocation for the IP plus ISPs re-use them and don't give customers static IPs...

Not sure I understand about the issue with the files being named 'render' anyhow they are obviously photos anyone who spends that much time making realistic looking renders would be better off making the boards :)

FIRST THINGS FIRST a QUICK MANUAL FOR EVERYONE:  

- Do not stand on your decks without the trucks being attached. 

- Go to your car supply store and buy yourself MATTE - Cockpit car wipes.
After you take your decks out of the box - it will have bubble marks all over it from the bubble protection foam. It‚Äôs normal. Polyurethane has to breathe. To get rid of it, just wipe it with your car wipes, and wait a few minutes after that just use paper towel to clean it, and you are good to go.

- Do not unscrew any of the screws, and there is a lot of them. There are hinge screws, lid screws, button stud screws and so on. Some of you have tendency to unscrew everything, but in this case just don‚Äôt touch anything unless you see something gets loosen up. Loctite and glue was applied where it was supposed to be applied so don‚Äôt unscrew anything. 

- You don‚Äôt need to use truck risers. Wheel well cut outs do a great job so big ass truck risers are not needed‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs good to use those tiny thin rubber truck pads so you won‚Äôt scratch your deck. 

- The gasket that we have used is a hard foam that goes alongside the length of the deck. There is no gasket at the front of the lid and it‚Äôs done on purpose. The lid needs to be more flexible at the front so you can close it properly. Just in case you need a gasket in the front - use additional Acoustic Gasket that will be attached to your deck.

- That hard foam gasket should compress after a month of usage and should soften a little bit and get smaller and so the lid should level out with the deck itself. We have tested it in our prototype and it worked well. Hover just in case I have attached additional acoustic gasket. This gasket is much softer and also works great however it just doesn‚Äôt look as good as that hard foam gasket. 

- Protect your kicktails. Use proper tail bone guards so the kicktail won‚Äôt get scratch. The kick tail on BEAST is pretty big and it will get scratch quickly - these are black and should look great:  https://www.nativeskatestore.co.uk/skateboards-c7/skateboard-rails-c115/tailbone-8-black-p29704 

- For nose protection use one of these, it just have to be flexible and it need to be properly attached with screws. : https://www.ebay.com/itm/NOS-1980s-POWELL-PERALTA-NOSEBONE-SKATEBOARD-NOSE-GUARD-/123199489842

- For small quick paint repairs use Birchwood FLAT BLACK : https://www.amazon.com/Birchwood-Casey-Super-Black-Touch-Up/dp/B00JSAE0ZY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=sports-and-fitness&ie=UTF8&qid=1457829837&sr=1-1&keywords=birchwood+casey+super&linkCode=sl1&tag=firemountaino-20&linkId=cec1844702f3f94480b9ad152e75fb70

- Don‚Äôt worry about Poliurethane getting scratched. Yes it will get scratched eventually as it‚Äôs not scratch proof but it‚Äôs super easy to repair. Buy at your local paint retailer - **50ml of polyurethane 1020 - RAL 9005 matte . Keep it mixed with thinner,** and for minor repairs just buy a very tiny brush for detailed works. Use only about 10ml of paint and mix it with a little bit of hardner. You can do repairs like that very quickly - paint dries after 15minutes. The best thing about POLY is that it is THICK and fills scratches really really nice. Additionally you can use Flexible 3m - 1500 grit sandpaper to smoothen the scratch.

By the way ....Seikeau there is a learning curve on how to properly close the lid, as I have noted that my wife was confused on how to do that. Basically you need to apply some force with your thumbs right next the button.  Just use some pressure to close it. Also take care of your deck ..and before you attach your trucks ..put something soft underneath it so you won't get it scratched.

Also....when drilling holes for your cables: -- USE A SMALL DRILL to PRE DRILL the hole ..and always drill from the outside to the inside.

Thanks, yeah I figured that out about closing the lid, was afraid to apply force at first.

Was thinking about picking up these 1/16'' risers, what do you reckon?

These should be good.  Also .if you can ..please get yourself one of these drill bits:

![41|518x500](upload://p5sAy6EMQA3uqG4qstugl830RuK.jpg)

One thing for you to notice: there is VECTRAN inside the deck which is a lot harder material to drill through than carbon fiber. So that's why you should pre drill with small drill from the outside and then use one of those STEPPED DRILL BITS . 

Ok. I am going to bed as it's super late at night here in CALI. Keep in touch guys.

To be honest I really like Hyper Beast cut outs but that clean grip without any letters being CUT looks so damn good I've decided to leave it as it is . CLEAN. But it's still easy for anyone to cut any shape they like. All LIDS are painted with BLACK colour underneath so that's an option for everyone.

One thing though ! Use some thicker neoprane beneath and above the batteries so during the ride they won't be jumping like crazy. In my deck I am using 5mm neoprane. When I close the lid it gets compressed and nicely wraps around the batteries. ![IMG_0342%20(1)|375x500](upload://gWjI2JR3oxeWSBSYoNUzvbkn0iz.JPG)

I don't think so .. for three reasons. 
1. TIME : It took us a lot more time than we initially anticipated. And what actually took us the most time was "sanding" ..I wish I've recorded how many rounds of sanding there was involved. 
2. PRICE: The amount of materials that went into building it, also exceeded our initial plans, but at least I hope you guys can feel that it's not a cheap deck but well handcrafted high end ride. 
3. SOMETHING NEW: We are working on a new mass production deck right now. It won't be a Lamborghini as the Beast ..it's gonna be more like a Cadillac Escalade. Still good but totally different.

 Do some measuring first. Some of the regular decks with that foam gasket might actually have 36mm inside...and it's all wood so actually someone might try to sand off 1mm from the bottom as well for additional height....but that's my guess so don't take my word for it. :slight_smile:

I realized the aluminium lip is like ~1-2 mm taller on the button end. Would you advise turning the pin down maybe 1/4 turn? it looks to me that the pilot hole might not be big enough when you initially screw the pin in.  idk if turning it would break the surrounding wood loose.

## \#466 Posted by: NAF Posted at: 2018-07-31T03:53:25.860Z Reads: 366

Hmm... can you DM me some close up images ? The thing is that the foam gasket is quite hard as it's new so this may cause the lid to be 1mm taller...but after riding on it for some time it will slightly compress so that might help...but yeah there is some additional regulation with that pin ..you won't break anything by turning it down...but at this point I suggest that you start riding on the deck first to see how that gasket foam behaves..and then after few weeks you can try slightly turn that pin down to about 1mm. In general the lid works best if it requires some force to close it down.

One more thing ...when drilling please remember to drill "always from the outside to the inside" ..and always pre-drill with small sharp drill first and use the that stepped drill bit that I've posted here a few posts ago. Or if you need to drill from the inside ..than use super super small drill bit just to mark the hole...and then drill from the outside to the inside with bigger drill bit.

When buying hinges just make sure they have genuine Italian Pistons inside . Those hinges made in CHINA often won't last too long and you need to pay for quality PISTONS as that's the most important part. The biggest issue that we had with hinges was that you need to get the smallest dimension possible and these are not so popular as the big regular hinges.

Guys interesting NOTE:  
Do you remember that scratch proof paint we were considering for the deck ?
It seems like one of the commercial brands called XWAY - they went for that..and this is the structure they got.
It has rought texture on it...so I can already tell that it wasn't dilluted. I am pretty sure that the way we wanted to paint it could have much more smoother texture. Well so there is that. Thought I'd share this with you.

So there are different manufacturers of this paint and I've seen some knock offs as well. Stay away from KNOCK OFFS they are not worth it. 

The ones that I know that works:
- RAPTOR BEDLINER
- COBRA LINER

But the problem is that you need to buy large paint cans, with this paint which is pricy !
But we have found very good paint from GERMANY called:  MIPA PROTECTOR. 

![mipa_protector-set_3|670x499](upload://7lNYUeHhcwmTPjNGLPXlYUUiNfS.jpg)

So the thing with MIPA is that you need to find one of there local dealers and you can buy smaller quantities with them.

NOTICE: bare in mind that using this paint is tricky ! Here are some examples of how to paint with it to achive different textures:

I've found something interesting...it seems like RAPTOR has their version also available in 2k - two component spray can for just 30$ . That's pretty affordable. **Maybe someone would like to test it out ?** 
This paint should be literally BULLET PROOF.

You know what guys ??? ...fuck it I'll test this paint on my own deck. I should get it in two weeks. 
I've found cheap alternative  which seems too good to be true. but hey...let's do it for science. 

![36|690x279](upload://eEVawfNKYOIbOVM0tkVaEuAW3Pg.png)        

and this is the texture :

The only issue with this paint is that it's not 2k ..so that's why I have my doubts if it's going to be scratch proof but hey ...let's test it out.


DIfferent cheap alternatives comparison:

and RUST-OLEUM PRO seems to have nice finish:
![05|690x364](upload://86lpjJvipaBVWig0nILP4Jf3ZPt.png)

and one more alternative for 24$ also available in SATIN FINISH !!!! and it should be legit as it's 2k :

I was contemplating dubbelstacking as well. something like 10s6p. But will probably not tight fit them as stacked, but leave some more space between them to get the height down a little. I mean, not like I'm lacking space anyway.

Big sorry guys for sucha a delay but I had my hands tight..just had to wait for them to ship it. 
I am waiting for the tracking numbers ..will DM you them tomorrow.

Anyway @stormboard1 don't know if you had been following the thread but there is a chance that you might still stack too rows in your regular deck. Just do the measuring when you get it. But with that hard gasket there is a chance you might squeeze fuck loads of batteries anyway.

Drilling the holes was super scary though. The enclosure is about a centimeter thick, so to fit the buttons and motor grommets I had to dremel out quite a bit around the holes as well. And as you can see in the pic I scratched the paint a bit with the dremel as well.

I started with a 2mm drillbit and worked my way up with 2mm intervals to a 12mm one, then dremeled out the rest of the holes very slowly, trying to fit in the button every so often. The board is a bit to dirty for more pictures now, so you'll have to wait for those untill I've found time to clean it :smiley:.

Hey @NAF, after riding around on it for about a week the lid won't close anymore, it just pops out of the button everytime :grimacing:. Any way to fix this or can you send me a new button or something?
```

## \#537 Posted by: NAF Posted at: 2018-09-14T14:00:11.902Z Reads: 312

 @seikeau Don't worry brother it is easy to fix. It has nothing to do with the button. It's normal that it might need some recalibration after some time of riding because the gaskets has to adjust. So here is the thing....you need to loosen up the the screw that is keeping the main STUD. After you loosen it up you need to turn the stud just a little tiny bit counter clock wise  so it goes slightly up...than you need to titghten up the screw back again. That's it. I would say that you probably need around 1/2 of the turn...or maybe less ..about 1/4 of the turn. 

It's just a matter of about 1mm or 0.5mm for the stud to go up...so you can close the lid. It's all about finding the right height for the stud. Just be prepared that if you pull out the stud too much the lid might not want to open at all. But don't worry . Just press the button on and use thin kitchen knife in between the lid to lever it up. 
Once you get the feel for how to do it it's going to be easy for you.

The rule is:
- if the lid doesn't close there is not enough stud sticking out - so you need to pull it up counter clock wise.
- if it doesn't open there is too much of the stud sticking out - so it needs to go down a tiny bit clock wise. ( use kitchen knife to slightly help it to open )

Always remember that the lid needs to be calibrated super tight. You need to apply pressure with your thumbs next to the button to close it.

Also @NAF, couldn't thank you enough for making this awesome deck. It is a pleasure to ride! The lock-in with your feet is just super natural. And the button actually makes a great foot-stop of sorts. You just instantly feel where your front foot is on the board. The only downside I could mention is that it is so heavy it makes the kicktail a bit hard to use. Especially with the relatively heavy battery in the front.

The wheel wells are a godsend too! I have 0.5mm risers just because you adviced us to do so, but I don't think I'd even need them even with my 90mm wheels.

Also pretty much no one suspects my board to be electric when they see it, super stealthy :sunglasses:

Thanks!

Lol I literally to bolted the Hubs on guys. I guess I should put the the dual Escape in next.

My plan is to sand the coating off and polish it back to this render @NAF posted a long time ago. Probably doing the same on the top side at some sections to show the Carbon off with less grib tape.

Regret not getting a double stack. Here's my solution. Very spaced out stagger stack. Should fits 60cells max in here so either 10s6p or 12s5p with very specific way to split these 12 cells holders.

Dimension is 156x75x34

Holly shit ..I was away for a while and there is so many new posts to read. I'll be back later guys with more feedback. But first things first. The bottom lid has 3mm of depth + additional layers of polyester filler + carbon fiber and paint. To be honest ..I have no idea how much you can shave off from the bottom ..just be careful and remember that the bootom also serves as a backbone for the whole construction so I wouldn't go super crazy with removing a lot of mm...one solution that would be the easiest one is laser etching the lid from the bottom. The lid is 3mm thick I can easily see that lid being engraved for some additional depth where the battery is.   Taking off 1.5mm from the lid could work  ..maybe 1mm or 1.5mm from the bottom as well. that gives good 2.5mm-3mm more.

With how tight the cell holder is sitting in there I'm most likely just gonna print a shim to glue under the grip tape to add a little bit of a W. Or if I make my own lid then it can be 2mm thick and I can rise the foam lining of the inside to give another 1mm if internal height. We will see.

Just double sided tape to test fit atm. Will be using some thermal adhesive once I finish my battery. Phase wire will be reterminaled to a Amass MR60 plug, which I'll cut a hole and drill through.

If possible I want to tap m2 holes on the lid so I can use longer m2 screws to bolt the focboxes to the lid with termal paste. Idk if I can get the dimensions of the hole pattern right just with hand tools
