My Trampa build is 150km away on my fiance's property.
I'm replacing the vescs with 2 HW max6 esc's and am making up a plate to mount them on.

Can anyone help a brother out?

I can do it up there but have access to a machine shop in town.

I also looked for this, but couldn't find it anywhere.

So I measured and created my own template:
