Machining point
1. Trampa Skate Truck(Some modifications)
 - 1'st => 10mm cutting aluminum.
 - 2nd => 4 angle machining for fixing HUB motors. 
2. Maytech 9055 HUB Motor(Some modifications)
- 1'st => Extending  inner hole 8mm to 9.5mm


Mounting for temporary testing.
After testing, i will changing with double drop deck.

![SK8_2_IMG_1272|375x500](upload://dlxPepBTPEkFbXXZVLlinMhELYZ.jpg)

I will compare HUB motor heating test  with gummy tire HUB motor  and without gummy tire HUB motor
Front Hub motor is with gummy tire and rear HUB motor is without gummy tire. Because of HUB motor heating test

![SK8_4_IMG_1272|666x500](upload://4p5GZr9zyQ4p1l0pb1d0uXtFugZ.JPG)

I will adding block parts between HUB motor and Wheel.

After first riding, i felt  that acceleration is not bad.
I got some problem. Ebay ESC(for brushless motor) is not suitable for HUB motor.
I must change ESC with Ebay 4WD ESC for HUB Motor.

Love how you realized the torque transfer between motor and hub - so DIY :heart_eyes:

Get VESCs - you will end up paying double otherwise. Learn from our mistakes

I'm using  normal HUB Motor(Maytech 9355 60KV).
This HUB Motor stator has 8mm hole for normal longboard truck.
So, i  expanded inner hole 8mm to 9.5mm. Because Trampa truck is 9.5mm.

I was meaning that diameter and length of the stator. The part with the wire wrapped around it

I didn't measure diameter  and length of stator.
If i disassemble HUB motor, i will measure that.

Just idea for installing to Trampa spring turck.
Wheel hub is Trampa 6 hole hub + 3D Printed HUB.
Unfortunately some short.  :-(

Nice mod man.  Seems easy enough to do with basic tools. Did you use Dremel 
 to modify your hanger?  I might give this a try.

Hi, does anyone know can these hub motors handle burst current larger than 22 amps if cooling is not a problem?

What would you estimate the total cost for this was? Also is it possible to do this with 2 hub motor boards like all these budget boards out?

What would you estimate the total cost for this was? 
=> 4ea HUB Motor(About $280), 4ea ESC(VESC4 => About $250), Truck 2ea(About $70), Deck(About $50), Wheel 4ea( About $150 )

Also is it possible to do this with 2 hub motor boards like all these budget boards out?
=>  What does that mean? I need a more detailed explanation.

Thank you. 

Can’t forget the battery. 

I meant some way to only have direct drive mods on a 2 hub motor setup.

It depends on the wheel size.
Perhaps the 90mm size would be optimal. If you use two hub motors

Yes, it will work the same as it is now, however if you use larger wheels you need the extra motors to make up for the torque loss

@Iuliu
You will have to use a small wheel. A 125mm tire will fit. If you use a big wheel, the brake was weak.
