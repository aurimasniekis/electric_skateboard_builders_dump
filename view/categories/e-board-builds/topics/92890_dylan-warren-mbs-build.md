Good choix! I did the same except the motor (SK8 6374 192KV).

I use this box for the esc : HAMMOND  1590XXCB.

OVERION Mount but E-TOXX 8T and 40T motor and wheel sprockets.

Your motors’ KV is lower and I would choose 10/35 OVERION sprockets.

The 42T sprocket will be heavy IMO. No big deal you’ll be able to change it easily.

Overion mounts are great! I use 10/42 and love them. With 10mm shaft and 6374 130kv , the feeling was superb! about 40 km/h top speed, now I am using 154 kv 8mm shaft Trampa, they are really fast 50km/h easy....But I prefer the 130kv motor and bigger shaft, I am trying to fix one broken motor to go back to that set up... Also, Yann from Overion is a very nice person!

They work fine. More  powerful than maytech 6374 130kv closed IMO.

Those maytech should take 65A but they saturate at 44A according to VESC-Tool.

These turnigy SK8 take 67A.

Overion has some shipping from France I think. I got a 10t 10mm one but they should have 8mm ones.
