Nice job my man. 

The wire management outside of the enclosure is especially neat.

Oh, I also found a neat product for impact and vibration reduction.  3M 2228 Rubber Electrical tape (https://www.lowes.com/pd/Scotch-2228-Rubber-Mastic-10-ft-Electrical-Tape/50014064)

I used it to protect my mounts, stop vibration, even as a riser under my trucks.

Thanks guys, I read my eyeballs off and slowly got there.  For any new builders, just take one step at a time.

I am still a little unsure of my settings, new build worries.  I am running a dual FOCBox setup using split PPM, both vescs are setup separately (motor detection and all), I have a 10s4p 30Q pack.  Is my Battery Max and Absolute Max correct?
Kay 6355's have a max of 60a.

What are the parts showing up on each side of the front truck? Seems to be your truck riser?
