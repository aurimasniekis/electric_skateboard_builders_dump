I made a spreadsheet for any and all builds, just plug in your information and you will get information such as price, weight, top speed, and range.
[Here it is!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13C7KFaKLvVFcnXTr2vUg8kO2lmVqHX5vElVWK7inxNs/edit?usp=sharing)
Hopefully this is as useful to you guys as it is for me!

Thanks @link5505 this is great; many folks forget one or more pieces of the build when they are starting. This could really help!
