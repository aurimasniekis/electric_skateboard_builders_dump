This build lifts off from my previous build in that I am re using the trucks and motors but since I have a new deck batteries and enclosures it is pretty much a new build. 

Previous build
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/under-the-sea-v2-400wh-12s-lipo-dual-5065-140kv-maytech-vesc-torque218-trucks-gt2b-buffalo-97mm-wheels-commuter/24781 

The deck is the meat of this build, my previous one let me down on the durability front, I got 7 months hard use out of it but it started to crack and fall apart. I think due to several factors, firstly it was a drop through design with open ends, I am on the heavy side at 110kg, I ride like an animal and the roads around here are very rough in spots, its a cheap Chinese deck, on top of that I ride in heavy rain pretty often.  

The new deck is a Arbor Highground, 2015 addition. Personally I think the shape is nicer than the 2017 model. Its designed for downhill racing and is made in California so I expect top quality. I looked for ages for something that was top mount, good quality, with a eye pleasing shape and decent wheel clearance. Also in the $100 range. Then I found this Arbor for $120 shipped and it seemed like a good deal. 

I'm calling it the Ceramic Surfer because the thing is a stiff as fuck, or stiff as a deck made from ceramic!!  My old deck has a bit of flex which was nice for absorbing bumps, so that is my only concern about this new one other than that I think its AMAZING. Its 9 ply rock maple 15mm thick! So plenty of meat for routing out some areas for wires and batteries. It has a W concave in the middle for added stiffness and regular concave in the foot areas for comfort. Large CNC wheel wells and pretty big concave in the foot areas for added leverage. 

This video is for the 2014 Highground but I think its same deck with different art.

I am building a 12 lipo pack inspired by @Namasaki I looked at so many batteries on hobbyking but these ones where the best value 60c in hard case. The only nicer ones where graphene 4s, which are almost twice the price and these 2 cell packs are thinner.

 But mine will have bullet connectors between the batteries as I want to be able to separate them for taking on a plane if I want to travel with the board. Secondly I will make a harness for two 6s balance leads for charging with a hobby charger. 

Supplies for 12s conversion

The main reason to go for hard packs was for added durability. I also wanted water proof so I knew I would be putting hotglue or epoxy into the holes where the wires exit. 

But after I received the batteries I was very disappointing with their construction. :cry: If you shake the batteries left to right across the short axis you can feel the cells inside move. Secondly if you squeeze along the split line of the plastic shell you will hear a "crack" sound as it deforms. They used a very minimal amount of glue to hold the two half's together. With a few minutes of squeezing and prying with my finger nails I was able to open the packs with just my hands! Once open it was clear to see there was a 1-2mm gap all the way around the cells and the cells where not double taped to the plastic housing which I was very surprised by. 

Thoes two tinny pieces of white foam are the only thing bolstering the cells inside the pack. This would just not do for the kind of abuse I will be giving them. :imp:

More atrosities where found when I dissasembled the cells, the cells where not double tapped to each other and only held together with two pieces of office tape! WTF. So I put double tape between the cells and added some glass fiber tape around the outside for added security.

So I decided I would fully pot the cells inside the case with epoxy! Yeah that should give me bombproof vibration and water proofing. :astonished::laughing::sunglasses: I used 6 boxes of 90 min Araldite.

Damn those batteries felt like some low quality shit. Good thing you made them more duarable. Looking forward to see the final result. What enclousure are you planning to use for the batteries and electronics?

[/quote]
Something of my own design. Not 100% sure yet but I'm thinking about bent aluminium sheet with 3D printed end caps. For the electronics probably a thin lunchbox as I need something I can open easily. I'm going to put the balance plugs inside it to protect them from water, so need to open every charge. 

Interestingly it looks like the batteries are actually 5.5 ah, not the 5.0 ah that's listed. These little labels are on all the batteries and they vary plus or minus 50.

Update: Battery wired up. Next up is battery enclosure.

Series bullet connectors done. This is the main thing that allows me to disassemble the pack for flights. They do take up some space though so it was a little tricky to get the wires to sit nice. 4mm bullets for series then the main power wires are 5.5mm with 10awg wire. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/6/a65f179da12eb56b2bf672ab6ea661c56b55369d.jpg" width="666" height="500">

One other thing I needed to do was make my own watt hour label as Hobby King decided not to put one on there. :rage: 37Wh. Hopefully it will save me a bit of time at security. I scaned the original label so I could pull the colors in photoshop. Then printed it out and covered with some packing tape for protection. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/5/d59461c4c5044098d71fb81a5b2a32fc15c37671.jpg" width="666" height="500">

For the balance connectors I covered them in a layer of hot glue then shrink wrapped them, kept the heat on until the hot glue was soft and could be squeezed out the ends. This makes them vibration and water proof. While it will be a pain to unplug them, I will hopefully not have to do it that often. Probably only fly with it 1 or 2 times a year.

I added an extra layer of hot-glue around where the wires exit as I was concerned the enclosure could rub on the wires here. It shouldn't as I will have foam padding on top of the cells but just in case. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7d367f094bbebb6ca1f70eb66ef2ef0dc88e9871.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Of cause I gave each one a name. :wink:

Then a final shrink wrap to protect the labels and make the removal of any glue or double tap easier. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/5/e5439945bf0cbffdfaf1f378b4af5b490fcd5889.jpg" width="375" height="500">

The completed pack!!

Notice the four 6s balance plugs? :confused: This is because I will have voltage alarms permanently attached to two of the plugs while the other two are for charging. While the vesc has a voltage cut off, it only monitors total pack voltage, while this will monitor each sell individually which is much safer for battery health. The additional monitoring plug is just paralleled at the end. The 18awg silicon wire I used to extend the balance leads turned out quite bulky. I probably should have gone with 22awg. The wires are extra long at the moment as I will shorten them once installed.

Forgive me Skatan as I'm about to commit a crime and destroy the nice veneer and art on this deck. :cry: 
As the board has a lot of curvature I want to flatten out this area so the batteries sit flat and a bit lower. At a later date I may route out a depression so they can sit even lower.

No I beg you not to ruin the deck. Maybe try 3D printing a curved piece of plastic that starts thicker on the sides and gets thinner towards the middle so that it is flat on top. It's not very well explained but that is what I have done to my board and it works well. I just got a piece of cardboard and stuck foam to the out sides so that the cardboard is sitting higher on the sides where the deck it curved. If you need a picture I can get you one when I am home

Small update, I planed it down to make the battery area flat. 

[quote="pat.speed, post:6, topic:30020"]
I beg you not to ruin the deck.
[/quote]While it is a pretty deck and at first I didn't want to mess with it after thinking about it a while I realized it didn't matter so long as I didn't compromise the strength. I was going to paint it anyway for added water proofing, it will get a bunch of holes drilled in for the threaded inserts, most of the deck will be covered by the enclosures anyway. I plan to ride the thing until it is no good, hopefully that will be a few years. 

The deck is 15mm thick 9 ply and I removed about 1.5 ply's from the center. So I don't think it will effect the strength much. Maybe has slightly more flex now, slight more than zero. :smirk:

It has a deep concave at the front then a W concave in the middle, that is what leads to the funny shapes.

When they say rock maple they mean it, the stuff is freakin hard and not that easy to plane, the hand planner was futile.

I softened the edges as it has pretty sharp corners that are not that nice for carrying. 

Arbor uses environmentally friendly :seedling: sealers and paints, but I don't like them. I went to wipe the board down with alcohol before painting it and then all the clear sealer became sticky. :rage: It cant be very durable if it dissolves that easily?  So I had to sand off all the sealer. Secondly the blue and green paint areas bubbled after I painted them. So I'm going to have to sand it down again and repaint it.

Been a long time since an update. It was on the back burner for a while due to other projects (DIY 3D printer) and my other board working good. But now my first board had one of the battery cells die and the deck itself is almost totally dead. Now I have good motivation as I need to have an esk8 :disappointed_relieved:, have been making some progress over the last month. 

Aaaand I broke my hand ridding my sons plastic penny board. :flushed: :confounded: :rage: which makes working on this more challenging. Those  things are deadly.

The other factor that slowed the progress is the paint turned out really shit. I couldn't even stand to look at it for a while. :sob: Demotivated. The areas I left of original Arbor eco paint bubbled up BAD, and the white spots are from the matte clear getting too close. Rushed it. To fix the bubbling it really needs to be sanded all the way back to wood. :scream: But I never found the time or motivation to do that. So I just did a light sanding and respray to get rid of the white spots. The bubbled areas will just have to wait for a full repaint. :persevere:

This is after sanding and respray, the bubbling is pretty deep.

The battery enclosure is 2mm aluminum sheet metal bent, its going to have a 3D printed end cap on the front and be open on the back end. The battery is already 100% water proof so this will allow any water to drain out after a ride. If I was to seal both ends there is no way to know if any water got in without removing the enclosure.

Apologies for the photo quality, I only get to work on it after my sons asleep and the light level in my living room is pretty low.

Some more crimes! I wanted to put the anti spark in the middle of the pack as I have it wired for charging as two 6 cell packs. I also wanted it to be mounted neatly. Since the deck is 15mm thick I decided to put the antispark into the deck. :astonished:

It is ride-able now and I have done 4 commutes. Originally I was concerned the stiffness of the deck would be harsh on the rough terrain that I have to deal with. But its not that bad, you feel more of the road texture but at the same time it dampens some of the high frequency vibrations more than my old deck. The stiffness makes the steering very direct, at first if felt a bit squirly, but I tightened the trucks a bit and got used to it, around high speed corners there feels like more traction.

Its ride-able but I still have some bits to finish or upgrades I want to do. I have a volt / amp meter to install. The 3D printed end cap for my battery housing. I'd like to get some CNC motor mounts. Some 107mm flywheels (dear santa) bigger motors and new paint job.

Hi @Jebe I use a [ISDT T8 at work.](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ISDT-T8-BattGo-1000W-30A-Smart-Battery-Balance-Balancing-Charger-For-1-8S-Lipo-Battery-Charging/32838199043.html?spm=a2g0s.8937460.0.0.FahLYG) Its a very nice balance charger its quite powerful and small if I need to put it in my backpack. I did modify it though with an extra fan that is always on because the internal fan switches on when it hits 60deg C, and its pretty loud. Then it comes on off. It annoys my co workers.  

At home I use a [AOK BC168](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Wholesale-1pcs-AOK-BC168-1-6S-8A-200W-Super-Speed-LCD-Intellective-Balance-Charger-Discharger-rc/32839639911.html?spm=a2g0s.13010208.99999999.386.iDUvAo), which is cool because its actually 6 individual chargers that works via the ballance plug. It charges each cell seperatley and does not drain each high cell to balance the pack like most chargers do. 

The battery is still working fine but there is more voltage sag then I was expecting and I would like some more capacity. The main advantage is I can disassembly and fly with it, and its quite thin.  I think if I was to make another battery I would go for a 12s 4p, Lion with Samsung 30q cells. It would give me a lot more capacity for not much more money.

Woot! Finally an update to the board. I got some sexy new motor mounts custom made by @marcmt88 He has pretty much a mount for anyone's needs or can even customize one if you need something ultra strange. Awesome service and reasonable price. I wanted mine customized with a 72mm center to center distance. Check his thread here https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motor-mount-with-dual-idlers/35183?u=lrdesigns

I upgraded to these for two main reasons, my old mount had a 3D printed clamp that would crack after some time and was annoying to replace. And secondly these have a X motor bolt pattern so I can upgrade to larger motors later without needing new mounts! :money_mouth_face:

There is an update. Board has been working fine except for one area. 

I changed gear ratio and wheel pulley from 3D printed to aluminum. Since I changed to this idler setup I have sheared two wheel pulleys in half while braking. Very annoying to limp home on one motor. Also one was on a steep downhill and l lost most of my braking power. Somehow the idler system allows more power to be transmitted to the wheel. I guess it make sense as there is less noise under braking. 

The new pulleys are these. I got the 36t 17mm wide. They can fit 608 bearings inside which allows them to run true. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/just-made-some-5m-36t-5m-40t-wheel-pulleys/49760?u=lrdesigns

My gear ratio changed from 20/39 = 1.95:1 to 18/36 = 2:1 It made a surprising difference to the performance. A bit more acceleration and significantly more braking power! Top speed feels similar but I did not measure it. Now Im curious to try some smaller motor pulleys as more braking power is always good in my opinion, I don't mind to sacrifice a little top end. 

One other benefit to these aluminum ones is they make a futuristic WrrrRRrr sound that I really like. :nerd_face: The printed ones didn't make a good noise.

I dunno how I missed your build. This deck is sick..  I haven't seen this deck before, but it looks super close to the  rogerbros DH37 except in wood..

As far as reduction, somewhere north of 2.25:1 braking feels almost perfect for most weighs. But I think your a light rider like me.

It really is an amazing deck. The only bit I didn't really like is the W-concave in the middle, but now I got used to it and try to keep my feet at the ends where they are supposed to be. 

Actually I'm kinda heavy at 100kg and it has ZERO flex.

Here is the deck while it is still around.

Go a High Ground DeckyBro, I have one and  :heart_eyes: it.
Add a footstop to the front & is bang on :ok_hand:

A little W in the back, the wheel flares make nice pockets & the rear tapers and has a nice flare which works as a toe hook for you rear foot. I have one for a build atm I have been kicking it DH and I couldn't be happier with it...

It is a pretty old design that has been refined over the years and is often available at a good price, I got mine in Aus for $99 Aud ($72 US).

Time for some updates. 

First is that I added a second loop key that disconnects the negative wire to the Vesc's. Previously I was charging the pack as two 6s packs one after the other because if I tried to parallel charge them at the same time it shorted out the balance wires. BZZT. :boom: So charging is now more convenient. 
![image|666x500](upload://kK9iYioradaE0lRye0zfyrFiDk.jpeg)
The threaded inserts that hold the battery enclosure were too cheap and threaded out. So now I am using regular bolts with nylock nuts. Got some of those pretty anodized washers too. 
![image|252x500](upload://uE5MpYVReDPfiRroeYWeWVY2L9D.jpeg)
I messed up and killed two cells. $60 gone. :sob: My inlaws were visiting and I was highly distracted. So I forgot to turn the board off for 3 days. Really this should be fine but I have voltage alarms on there that draw power from 1 cell only. These drained the cells to zero volts. Weirdly they should have gone off at 3.6v but did not go off until zero volts. Anyway got two new cells from Hobbyking and fixed that mess. 
![image|666x500](upload://fo1wRWrXR2cAWv0BmiCAZccjBUq.jpeg)[image|666x500](upload://5qpFUz6QhNjvOusgi6XmzR7s4kn.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://x3iNnS0n8a8kB3IWhiEEwHpMHej.jpeg)![image|667x500](upload://os7kb16SomnHkO5yv8dmHCtZE6n.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://oMQnG6OYY1PjqR4J1dnZByLziI8.jpeg)!
I bought some surf rodz trucks when they were on sale in July, but will not receive them to later this month when my dad brings them back from the US for me. Really excited about these but now I need new motor mounts. I plan to get the red 100mm boa wheels so I also need kegel style pulleys. A lot of money for the full conversion so It will be a slow process. 

Though I have been tuning the feel of the trucks and I feel like I got precision trucks for free. I tried these 3D printed rings from @skatardude10  that take the slop out of the hanger, it makes the trucks feel so much more precise, turny AND stable. Its just a little ring but it makes a HUGE improvement to TB218's.  https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-demonseed-tb-218-tb-6374s-190kv-tb-mounts-chibattery-10s4p-dual-focboxes-superflys/50610/20?u=lrdesigns  Addtionally I have changed my angles from 55/55 to 55/50 with a looser rear truck and more solid riser not a soft one. Made it way more stable at high speed. Turning radius is actually tighter too. :sunglasses: ![image|666x500](upload://gImUXDtGdG75wQlTuK33kXeHN52.jpeg)

Surf Rodz came in. Wooo. 

Also been working some risers and motor mounts for the surf rodz. 

I can only run the front one until I get motor mounts. But it did make a noticable difference. More stable and less wiggle at speed. While still having a tighter radius for slow speed U turns. With the riser I run 55 deg in the front.

[/quote]
With 220 watt hours you would expect 20km max range. I have never tried and don't want to try as I want to be nice to my batteries. Lipo dont like to go low. 

I only get about 6km range, and that is the length of my commute so it works fine for me. I am tall 6.2" and heavy 110kg that must account for some of it. The other thing is I only charge to 4.1 volts and at the end of my commute the battery is at 3.8 volts. I do that to get longer life from my batteries. 

If you want range I would not use this setup, I would go for 18650 in a 4p configuration. Samsung 30q preferably.

Lols. Sweet deal. These are press fit. But I also have a CNC version that’s smaller. This is just test / plan B if CNC is too expensive. 

I made these on a SLA though. Not toleranced for FDM.

Guys I have uploaded the Surf Rod press fit motor mount files to thingiverse! Free to all! 

These are meant to be CNC'ed. While I did make a printable version that is more just an experiment and you need a SLA printer as there is no tolerance between the mount and the trucks as it's a "perfect" fit. 

[Press fit motor mount for Surf Rodz 200mm RKP trucks.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3174856/files)

If you do end up making a printed one I suggest you put support bars on the motor plates to limit flexing and reduce load on the mounts.

This is what the CNC version looks like. The small dot on the back side is to show which way to assemble them. The dot goes on the side of the truck that has the axel grub screw. It has a slightly steeper angle than the other side so its easy to put on upside down.

I just got a good price on the CNC in 6061 if I order 10 sets. 20pc total. No surface finishing. 

Just feeling out if anyone is interested in a set for $50 usd shipped registered mail from Hong Kong? 

I don't want to do a big group buy or make a bunch of money, just want to make it worth my time and reduce the financial risk to me. I would just need 5 other guys to make it worth it. 

These only fit Surf Rodz RKP 200mm hangers. The hole pattern is designed to fit mark88 motor plates rear mounted. But I think we could do some with no holes so people could drill them by hand to match their application.

[/quote]

Hey @wolffoxx I got some more info on the range as I recently put my battery meter back in. I charge to 90% according to the meter, and finish my 5km commute at 70%. So I think a range of 20-25km is possible if you use 100% of the battery. To be safe I wouldn't want to use more than 10-15km

On a 1p lipo pack I don't think its safe to go below 3.6v as the cells are not as well matched as big brand 18560's and each cell discharges at a slightly different rate. So if your only monitoring total pack voltage one cell could get too low without you knowing. Once lipo goes below 3.4v they drop off a cliff and you can end up at 2v very easily. If you had a 3p pack then the difference between cells would average out and could be run a bit lower.

Thanks for the info!  I recently built a pack from 4 X 3s 8ah Zippies.  I wired them as 2 X 6s, which I combine in series for 12s.  I charge them on two separate balance chargers.  I'll probably try your conservative cutoffs.  I'll run mine with voltage alarms, as well. No BMS, yet.  Yours and @namasaki's lipo builds were what I studied the most.

Im sure they are, NOT accurate or linear. But if you want the voltages, I charge to 4.05 and end around 3.85v so I am not taking that much out. I am not sure how to convert that into a percentage though? 20% seems reasonable.

On the weekend I got to test fit the 3D printed version of the press fit mounts. 

The plan was to be able ride them but I didn't have the right screws and I didnt finish the support bars which I think are needed with a 3D printed mount to reduce flex and load on the mount. 

So I had to remove and put my old setup back on for now. :pensive: 

On the positive side, the marc88 motor plates fit good, the angle is good and @dickyho pulley can also be made to fit 70mm axles with a little modification. 

![Photo%20Nov%2010%2C%208%2058%2034%20AM|690x326](upload://yX5b1G7JWQlJXILhBFeGFKPHhxf.jpeg) ![Photo%20Nov%2010%2C%204%2025%2046%20PM|666x500](upload://6JVy0kuci5l3jRPurrX5qja7EKt.jpeg) ![Photo%20Nov%2010%2C%203%2050%2044%20PM|690x362](upload://49865wlI8Kpp4XTXZFGuf5kxIAs.jpeg) 

Didnt have enough M4 x 20mm bolts. :face_with_symbols_over_mouth:
![Photo%20Nov%2010%2C%209%2007%2025%20AM|690x427](upload://lTFu4Dk7kdMBbbSgBNzCpqYe839.jpeg)

So I learnt a few things with the test fit. 
- Distance between motor plates is 168mm. Should be good for 80mm length motors!
- They are designed to fit faboy 36t and up pulleys, but dickyho pulleys can also be made to fit with some elbow grease. This is with standard 70mm axels. Other pulleys could work but you would need an extra spacer and 80mm axles, then your motor pulley will have to sit out a bit, so not ideal. 
- Did not test if the holes work for forward mount but its on the todo.
- Should I investigate making motor plates also? Most of the hard design is done so I think I should at least get a cost on that. 
- Note my rear truck is a 45deg, so that may play into the angles the motor plates can go to. 

For those who missed the info above, the plan is to do a small group buy of these press fit surfrodz RKP motor mounts. They will be,
- CNC from 6061.
- Fit marc88 motor plates. (Might do my own plates)
- Only fit surf rodz RKP 200mm hangers.
- Fit fatboy pulleys. Dickyho pulleys can be made to fit.
- Press fit, no clamp, as in just do up the axel and they are tight as a :tiger2: 
- $50 usd for a set of two, delivered by registered mail from hong kong.

168mm between the plates? That means we can fit these bad boys on there! And I will :smiling_imp:

Do you already have motor plates? Will need to carefully consider the center to center distance so it will clear the baseplate / kingpin. Forward or rearward mount? Fitting these in forward position might be tricky.

I was going to attempt an inward mount. I'm doubtful I can get it on a talon but I'll mock it up before trying. Was gonna CNC some thicc motor plates out of 6061 on the cheap using one of my university's mills.

Yes, I finished the support bars and got some M4X20mm bolts to attach the motor plates to the hanger mounts. This weekend I can finally test it out. :dancer:

Pretty happy with the result for hand drilling. M5 tapped holes. 12mm Aluminum bar stock.

Attempting a motor plate design to check the price. My goal was to keep it as simple as possible to machine and keep the short center to center distance I already have. To fit 5065 racestar and SK3 // 44mm spaced motors. 

The tricky thing is with motor plates everyone wants a different center to center distance. But I am only planning to do a 10 set run so can't please everyone. 

The only downside I see with this short CTC is that it does not fit SK3 6374 in rear mount, you would have to use shorter or smaller diameter motors. The moc motors in the render are SK3 6374. 

The blue line is 63mm and 50mm motor diameters.

Printed version fits and seems to work for now. See how long it can hold up. 

One issue I had was my belts where much tighter. My old trucks and mounts must of never been this strait! So I have had to use really small bearings on the idlers to get it to fit. Just a temporary solution, I now have ordered 290 my current ones are 285.

Update on the build. Since changing the rear TB218 to the surf rodz 45 the board is crazy stable I feel like I’m going half the speed as before. So this is what a downhill board feels like. It’s set up now 55 front 45 rear. 

The downside is that there is one sharp hair pin on my commute that I can’t get around anymore without wheel bite. So going to +5 wedge the rear so will be 55 / 50. 

One bonus of surf rodz is that I don’t need to carry a skate tool anymore as the wheels and kingpins only need a 5mm Allen key. 

Only need these tools for the board now. 
![image|690x269](upload://25z8kotklvBXcMEIGMygaR5jHyV.jpeg) 

By the way these Allen keys are awesome! I have used them for years and they still fit perfect.

Oh and 290 belts came in. Fitment is great.

Since I need to print a new plus 5 deg riser I finally got around to putting my riser design on thingiverse. 

I have made 3 versions.
- Plus 5 deg.
- Minus 5 deg.
- Flat, 6mm thickness.

Update after installing the plus 5 deg riser on the rear.

Still super stable at high speed, just a bit more carvey. I can make it around the u turn in my commute _**just**_ with the wheels dragging a little but not biting. So I think I will just sand down the wheel wells a bit where they touch rather than run thicker risers. 

Still kinda shocking how much more stable it feels over the tb218 at the same 50 deg angle. Feels like there is a bit more grip too, might be placebo.

We are really close to five sets so pretty sure the press fit mounts will be a go. Get ready to pay shortly and I can get the CNC shop start this week. I updated the sign up sheet, can you guys let me know if you want the plate holes pre drilled? 

I think I will save the motor plates for early in the new year. To complicated right now.

Printed mounts been working for a week so far. I don't think they will last forever as I am sure eventually I would hit a bump big enough to crack them.

I don't understand how they the mounts stay put. Just from shrink fitting? Or there are grubscrews that dig into the trucks for securing it nicely.

They fit perfectly the shape of the hanger. The axle bolt holds them on and the square shape stops them rotating.

Im not, I'm using 6s hobby ballance chargers and making the pack two parallel 6s packs for charging. 

It works but honestly its become a pain in the but and I want to convert it to a bms just to make charging more convenient. I am looking at smart bms so I can still adjust final cell voltage and keep an eye on cell health. 

Something like this [bluetooth smart bms.](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/14S-Smart-Li-ion-Battery-PCB-board-Bluetooth-Mobile-BMS-for-48V-58-8VLi-Ion/32794186005.html?spm=a2g0s.8937460.0.0.40f02e0ern75EZ) Problem is I need to buy two power supplies also as I need one at home and at work so been holding off on spending the cash on that.

Time to resurrect this build thread. I got a good tax return and will have 10 days off over the easter period to work on my board. So it is getting a bunch of upgrades. I may even repaint the deck. 

Since the last update I have been using the CNC press fit mounts and they are rock solid as if they were part of the hanger. :ok_hand: And have been enjoying the shit out of using DAVEga monitor, got 780kms with it. 

The other HUGE upgrade I got this week was TB110 wheels. Previously I just had clone 97mm flywheels. Same set I have had for two years since starting esk8. Now they are 91mm and have done about 3000 kms. The difference in feel, traction and look is massive.

My plan for the holiday is to redo the lunch box and all the associated wiring. To convert from charging with hobby chargers to charging with a smart BMS. And one more thing I am going to try is to have an on board voltage booster with constant current / constant voltage to act as the charger, then I can plug in any 12v to 40v DC source and charge the board. Not sure if it will work yet but going to try it out. 

The main goal is added convenience while still retaining adjustable end point voltage that I have with hobby chargers. 

I got all the parts prepared, now to figure out how to hook it up?

I'm glad you addressed the onboard charger voltage converter. I was thinking about this the other day and will be following this. It makes too much sense. 

Definitely needs a diy junction box :wink: 

Some even come with clear tops. Kinda kicking myself I didn't go with that one with the new lights I have coming.

There is one main problem with going with the charger already in the board. I use a cc/cv charger as my normal charger for charging all different batteries and it’s great (I recommend adding a cheap watt meter to measure Ah and Wh of battery also amps going in) but the thing is the current is based on the voltage. The more voltage you feed into it the more current that comes out. You can turn it down again but it is a pita to do it every time. 

For example when I charge using 18v input I put about 2.5A into the battery. At 25v it is about 6A. I would recommend to stick with just one power source and only use that or lower voltage ones.
```

## \#82 Posted by: lrdesigns Posted at: 2019-04-12T23:20:13.799Z Reads: 94

Can’t I set a maximum current with it though of like 3 amps? I think most of the time I will use a 25volts supply, and maybe ocassional 12v - 15v

Having a volt and amp meter is a good idea though to see what it’s doing.

I thought you could do that. Maybe I have my current set to maximum, I usually just vary the current by increasing or decreasing my voltage input
