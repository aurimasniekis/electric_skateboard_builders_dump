Hey!

This will my first electric board build.  Looking to build a commuter board that's going to work well in the slightly hilly region of Victoria BC.  I'm very new to all this and haven't used a skateboard in years.  My logic is to make something fast, dangerous and expensive to re-learn with because I have terrible logic.  I've assembled pretty much all the parts and have started to put it all together.  Learning tonnes from this forum; this place is a gem.  

**The List**
* Dual MayTech 6374 190kv sensored 
* Surfrodz TKP's and Ripba mounts
* FOCBOX VESC's 
* Maytech 1712 remote 
* 12S4P Samsung 30Q pack
* SixShooters running on 16/60 pulleys 
* Arbor Collective Dropcruiser 40" 9ply

Big thanks to @psychotiller for having a store and taking my money.  Pretty much everything was from him and he made sure I had what I needed.  The battery which is from @torqueboards.

I'll update with some photos a bit later when it's not just a pile of metal, wood and rubber.  

A couple thoughts, I'm considering switching to a Landyachtz EVO in the future. My reasoning is my commute is about 10-12km of mostly straight country road.  I like the idea of the stability the EVO would bring.  

I'm also considering slicing up the 12S4P to replace the BMS with a better spec'd one.  I was a bit over zealous hitting the buy button on the battery before I noticed the specs of the BMS.  For now though I'll live with it as it might be a non-issue; we shall see.

Cheers!

I would try out the battery as is...I was surprised how little difference it makes compared to my other higher specced batteries

The evo is a very pretty board with the right enclosure on it! ![IMG_2712|666x500](upload://3I3Ot9u8RagHcEABYuMmMg3GGBX.JPG) (shameless plug)

Ya I definitely will try it as-is first.  I'll limit the current in the VESC so it doesn't shut down and launch me; but ya, I'm not really expecting to ride this very aggressively.

That looks sick.  Love it.  Ordering on this afternoon.  Did you make the enclosure?  Follow up question, can I have your enclosure?
