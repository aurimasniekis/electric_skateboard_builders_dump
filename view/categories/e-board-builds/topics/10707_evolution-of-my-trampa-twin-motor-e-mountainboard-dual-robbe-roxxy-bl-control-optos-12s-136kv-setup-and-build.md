Hello eSk8builders. I am FreeRide.I am starting a build of a new Trampa Twin Motor MTB, this is my first attempt at setting up a electric board and need some help with the wiring configuration.  I figure lots of new people like me will be setting up a board similar to mine and will need some help setting it up and getting on the road. I will upload my pics along the way. 

Here is a list of the components I will be using:
Trampa Twin Motor Mountainboard from trampaboards.com 
Dual Vesc v4.12 connected through can-bus from Maytech(skatron vesc)
12S lipo (2 6S lipo in series)
High output 130A On/Off switch from  
2 50A Fuses
XT90 anitspark connectors and 12 awg wire 
2.4ghz Nano remote

First off, I got these car audio fuses from amazon and I believe they should work? 
I think I should connect one 50A fuse to the red wire of each Vesc?
Also, I am not sure where to put the antispark XT90? 
I have the 130A On/Off switch, do I need the antispark anywhere or just as a safety pull off xt90 key? All of the pictures show components of build.

Any help and suggestions would be appreciated, Thanks

Isn't that the Trampa "battery box" under your waterproof box in the last few pictures? Why not either use the Trampa box or get rid of it altogether to get your waterproof box lower?

No, it's not a trampa battery box, just some carbon fiber sheets made into box. Yeah, I fit everything into the waterproof box now and removed the carbon fiber box so it is much lower.

It rides great, tops out at 25mph and charges up hills! I made some changes in my build. I changed to dual hobbywing max6 esc with 8s lipo because I kept having issues with Vedder esc. I will be upgrading to multiplex roxxy 12 Opto esc when I get it in a month or so.

Hi Free Ride,

the VESC should work seamless! Use FOC, set the T Value to: T =500,0 µs. Otherwise you get issues with wheel slip.
The VESCs will drop out for a couple of seconds when the wheel slips. 
The 500µs Timing solve that issue. Use the Sensors! 
Motor max should be 50A, use the temp. protection. Max at 95°, start to slow down at 80° 

You can mount the VESc directly to the hex carbon panel. This way your VESC sits really close to the motor and cables are really short. 

After a couple of rides you should check all screws for a tight fit. Trucks, Wheels, Motormount connectors, battery Box etc. Thats standard, riding MTBs. Once all screws really sattled, they usually stay tight.

Hey Frank, thanks for the info but I fried all my vesc's. I had got them running but within 30 mins of use they caught fire, No luck with them!  Probably didn't have the right settings at the time, I am sending them back for a replacement and when I get them I'll use these settings. 

I picked up 2 Roxxy BL CONTROL 9120 Opto esc's to use instead of the vesc at least for the moment but are now having trouble the Roxxy esc's up. I have the programming card and the Roxxy esc and the castle creation 10A 6S BEC to power my 2.4ghz reciever since the esc don't provide 5V power. I have it set up but the receiver red light stays flashing instead of going solid red indicating a problem. The BEC is default set at 5.1V I believe, so it should be right and work? Since I haven't been able to get the TX Rx to work, I haven't been able to get into throttle, stop and reverse setup, kinda frustrating. I can program the esc via program card and need some info about the 136kv motors and gear ratio so I can get these set up right.

How many poles are in the 136kv motors?

What is the gear ratio with the 66 to 14 tooth setup? 6:1?

What parameter Car or Boat should I use, I believe Car?

Also any other things you or the community may know which could help would be appreciated.

Hi, our motors are 14 pole (magnets), 12 coils. I don't like RC Controllers and can't help you really. @Nowind will know.

Sorry! Hope you get your VESCs working again. I could send you my settings. Never had an issue with VESCs!

You should not use a 6S BEC for 12S use ! If you run your batteries in series you will fry this BEC.
Maybe you did already ?!

You get in progamming mode with Prog Card? Set to Car ! 
Gear ratio? Just divide Wheelpulley through Motorpulley! 4.7 !

Check if your reciever is bindet to remote, and report (-;

Sweet, thanks for the response Jens! Nice, I need some help with this. I don't think I fried the BEC, it has solid green light and connect and programs via castle link, so think it's still working. My receiver is binded to the remote and working. I also have a castle creation BEC Pro which 12s, but it has 2 lines to the receiver and reciever is only a 2 channel receiver

The instructions say both lines need to be connected from CC BEC Pro to reciever and to remove the red wire from esc reciever plug. Do you know if this is correct? I tried it but also having troubles with it.

Close off your drives if you can. I made some acrylic covers, bending the stuff by applying heat from a solder iron. Not touching, just hovering over and underneath the desired area. Do that until it bends into position on its own. Sanded it down and dropped some LEDs in. 
Tape will also do a good job, since it stays sticky on the inside and dirt will stick there, in case it enters the drive.

My Keto BEC comes with two output plugs too, i just cut one of it (-; Its made for high output... you just need really low output for powering the reciever.

You dont have to remove the red wire from ESC, this is only needet for ESC with build in BEC. So no need for Roxxy.

Just solder the BEC parallel with your power wires, or use small plugs like XT30.

1- connect Program Box with program wire of roxxy, connect Batterie, programbox should connect now.
Set first of all : CAR MODE ... , download setting... disconnect batterie...do for both esc

2-Remote ON, pulling trigger maximal, connect batterie, wait about 10 seconds, ESC beeps, move trigger to neutral and wait for beep, move trigger to full brake...beep.... disconnect batterie... connect batterie... should work now

You can set ESC parameters for acceleration and power to low, Motortiming about 15, for beginning is good (-; as you comes from VESC this will be still strong.... you can increase the values later if you want more power

Parameters for Gearing and Polenumber is just for getting the RPM data, not needet....

Hope that helps.
Jenso
Be carefull with the brake, as i mentioned in my Tread its a bit special

No luck with the CC BEC PRO and Roxxy Opto's yet. I went through the setup steps but still something going on. I tested the output voltage of BEC with my multimeter and it reads 5V but still getting a flashing red light on reciever indicating some error. I am replacing the "Winning" nano remote and reciever with torqueboards mini remote in a few days. I read about issues and dependency of the nano being in question and decided to upgrade to torqueboards remote, plus I think the issue I'm have with finishing my 12S Opto setup might be with the Winning remote receiver, although I have no issues with running on my Hobbytown Max 6 esc. Maybe I'm missing something but can't figure it out.

I took Franks suggestion and covered the motors with acrylic to protect motors, I like it! I will fine tune the look and make it much cleaner looking over time. I am grabbing some frosted acrylic to cover drive train soon. Got color changing LED for ground effects at night , looks sick!

Thanks Nowind, for the setup info, must have been the Winning nano remote that was the issue.

Thanks EssEnn, I think the ESK8 community has agreed that there is some issues with the Nano remote. I have made the switch to the Torqueboards remote and it seems to work much better than the Winning Nano remote. The ground effects lights were a 15$ ebay purchase that makes it more fun to ride at night!

What surprises me is that it is still being sold. I know a lot of people have had no issue with theirs but from my experience they are dangerous.

How do you find riding without heal straps? I'm thinking of getting the MBS F5 bindings as the tramps ones just don't feel right without heal straps for me.

Yeah, riding without heel straps is tricky at high speeds. I only ride without them when running 8S. I have heel straps and use them when running 10S or 12S. At high speeds and tight turns, heel straps help with control.

Update: Here is some picture of the next evolution my Trampa Emtb. Spent 2 hours last night fixing it back up. These steet tires from Trampa are killer on the asphalt, love um! 

Waiting on some frosted acrylic I bought to come in, so I can completely close of the drive train and light it up with leds. I am planning on putting bright white led strip lights on the front truck to illuminate the road at night, they should be here by the end of the week.

I made this one from acrylic glass. I cut a 25mm wide strip of galss, using a hex spacer to find the 100% correct width.
Clamped it in between two pieces of wood and slided the cutter along the edge several times from both sides. Now you can carefully brake the acrylic galss and give the edge some love with 240 sand paper, still clampd in between the the two pieces of wood.
I sanded the surfaces using 240 sand paper. Then I marked the first bending point, using a pencil. I let the acrylic strip hang over the edge of my workbench and hovered over and under the indication line with the hot shaft of a solder iron. This way you heat up the plastic only in the area where you want it to bend. You have to come quite close to the acrylic glass, not touching it. If you touch it you f... up.
I removed the tip of the solder iron, so I could see the red hot glowing heating element. I hovered over and under the indication line untill the material started to give way without touching it. Soft as it was I prensted it to the drive train and helt it to its position untill it got solid again. Don't blow at the workpiece! This will create tiny cracks. Its quite easy to make this workpiece. Sounds more complicated then it actually is.

@trampa I'm still looking forward for your Trampa EMTB case for the motor and the belt. Riding on grassy fields with alot of fallen leaves makes it very dirty, especially when some stones jumped to the belt and won't come out.

The belt cover is a bit of duct tape in my case. If dirt enters, it sticks to the tape.
Motor cover: Nick your girlfriends nylons and cut of the foot section. (-:

I was looking at those multistar batteries on hobbyking. They only have 20C max discharge, is that high enough?
Still looking at floureons because I can get 2 11.1V 3000-4500mAh for like 30 bucks on gearbest and like 4 of them for a grand total of 8 batteries for 100 bucks with coupon code.

8 x 3S (11,1V) = 24S1P

Ideally you want to use 10S with the current VESCs (more stable than 12S)
Without modifying You could use these batteries as 
- 12S2P
- 6S4P

I would recommend 12S.

I dont recommend you too... I just have told how many cells you will have: 24

These 24 cells can be stacked differently like i told in my previous Post:
- 12S2P
- 6S4P

@FreeRide

Nice build! 

What kinda led system is that you have going? Just mounted some lights on my Trampa I got from Hobbyking. Super bright, but no color changing, and they drained the shit out of my battery.

Also, how are you liking the street tires? I've mainly been riding on pavement. Loosing rubber really fast on the primos, and keep getting flats just about everytime I go off road.

Yeah, I bought a cheap 5v usb color changing led strip from amazon cost like 12$ our so,  I plug it into its own power source via a small usb battery pack for charging phones. Nice buy with lights, bright lights enhance the rides at night for me and helps most people driving see you, a must have I think. Dude these Trampaboards.com street tires are amazing, you need to get them! The tread is sticky on the road and last much longer and way less flat tires all together. They work good in the dirt aswell. Well worth the money, thanks! Trampaboards.com. I ordered dick brakes from Trampa for a safety back up for the emtb. I finally got some super bright led headlights and the frosted acrylic for for covering the drive train although I think this acrylic might be too thick Also order a slightly bigger battery box so can fit more componets in it and carbon fiber for the new motor housing covers.  So the next evolution of my Trampa EMtboard will be coming soon.

Thanks for the info. Gonna have to grab a set of those tires. You got 'em from Trampa? They look different from the ones I'm seeing on their site (the innovas). 

Really nice board. Lookin forward to seeing the new upgrades, especially the 'dick' brakes :joy:

@BoardSportsRN 

Both innova tire types are listed on there. Just had to dig a little. Wasn't showing when I clicked 'view all' tires for some reason. Had to go to 8inch only then they popped up. FWIW the ones FreeRide has are called 'slick cut.'      

I ended up ordering these instead: http://shop.mbs.com/accessories-492/mountainboard-wheels/mbs-roadie-tire-purple.html 

Sold me on the purple :slight_smile: 

Thanks for the tip on ordering straight from barajabali though. I didn't know there were any Trampa distributors here in the States.
