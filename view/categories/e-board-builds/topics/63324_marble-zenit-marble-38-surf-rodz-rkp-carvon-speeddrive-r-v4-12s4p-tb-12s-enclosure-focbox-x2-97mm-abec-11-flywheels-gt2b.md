Parts List: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mCr3IZigZyqd6hAywdA-ly7xonvWtfPw7dnJ8BKHA3g/edit?usp=sharing

Almost a year ago I decided to try my hand at esk8ing and bought a Wowgo to test the waters. After many accidents, saves, fun times, and yes; expensive hospital bills, I can say that it's one of the most rewarding hobbies I got into. Now after 800 or so miles it's time to ditch these hubs and invest in something with a bit more guts. Now that I've finally started buying parts I figure it's time to make a build log!

-Deck: Zenit Marble 38
When looking for a deck I knew I wanted one with a kicktail and it had to be stiff since it needed to stay stable and predictable at high speeds. I knew I'd be running large wheels as well and the large flared wheel wells let me do just that. It also has a sweet marbled design layered in the fiberglass to boot! I originally used this for my Wowgo since the v1 deck was so bad, and threw a Psychotiller enclosure over everything to avoid the split enclosure look.
Status: Delivered

-Trucks: Taco 180's
Just some random cast trucks I pulled from a pintail I never rode to replace the stock Wowgo ones. They seem good enough and I swapped the bushings for Riptide Canon WFB 88a so they're stable in the mid 20's but good for carving at any speed. I will switch them out but for now I don't see an issue.
Status: Delivered:

-Motors: Carvon Speeddrive R V4
You know when I said a "bit" more guts? well... anyways, I had been saving up for a set of these but never knew when or if I would get a chance to purchase them, so when @kylem21 posted he was selling his pair I knew I had to jump on it. (thanks!) 
Status: Delivered

-Battery: 12s4p
TorqueBoards 12s2p. I was originally looking at Psychotiller packs but the value of the included enclosure and battery meter swayed me over. Samsung 30q cells, which are a step up from the Samsung 22p's in my old wowgo 12s2p battery. That one was giving me issues with power loss when drawing a lot of amps, full throttle from a stop for instance.
Status: Ordered

-Enclosure: TB 12s Enclosure
I had a sweet Psychotiller one but didn't use washers under my nuts so they tore through the plastic. This one comes free with the battery so I figure I'll check it out.

-VESC: Focbox x2
What's to say? I'll be running in FOC since I loved the slence of the hubs compared to my friends belt driven board and I'm fine not pushing my limits until I get lots of pads. I don't know a whole lot about these so I will be reading a lot until they arrive and I guess go from there.
Status: Delivered

-Controller: GT2b
I'm going to print the MadMonkey case for it.
Status: Delivered

-Wheels: ABEC 11 97mm Flywheels
Found a set on ebay. Man are these expensive and hard to find.
Status: Delivered

-Other bits
 - 6x bullet connectors
 - heatshrink, 10awg wire, xt60 connectors
 - xt60 parallel splitter M to 2F
 - Loop key circut terminated in xt60

This is how I read build threads:

Go to thread - see wall of text - scroll down to bottom. 
Is the deck cool? Yes - Go back and read the thread
Is the deck boring? No - Move on :smiley:

Nice build! Just a quick and important tip: start already now to find all the small connectors etc. Make a plan. Order all those small parts from China right now. It will save you a lot of time and money. You will end up having an almost finished board but can't use it since you need connectors. A lot of small BUT IMPORTANT parts have been posted in a lot of threads. Good luck!

That's a good idea. So far I know I need 6 5.5mm bullet connectors for motors to focbox, 1 JST-PH 2MM canbus connector for dual vesc communication, and 1 XT60 parallel harness to power each vesc. I have a power lead to charge the battery but one thing I'm not sure of is an antispark switch / loopkey. How do I use it  and where does it hook up to?

No I got it a while ago full price. There's a guy on the longboarding subreddit who works for Zenit and gives 10% off discount codes so if you're still considering it ask him, idk if it applies to blems. u/lizardstreak or something similar.

@iKNOWaFATman The deck is indeed great. One of the reasons I wanted direct drive was to avoid issues with motors getting in the way of the kicktail that I often use.

```
Right now I have the [Flagship v2 Psychotiller](https://psychotiller.com/product/the-flagship) enclosure but when I mounted it I didn't use washers. I rode off a curb and 3/6 of the bolts tore through the holes I drilled so it's been duct taped on ever since. The issue I have now is I drilled through the deck so I either have to design another enclosure with a mounting setup that aligns with the current holes or buy a new flagship v2. I could also design a one that is not mounted with bolts but rather uses industrial strength velcro. I've been experimenting with it by attaching my electrics to the board with it and it's stronger than you'd think. I can almost lift the whole board by the battery so I Expect it will have no problems holding the enclosure if I go that route. My friend has a gigantic 3d printer I can use for it but this deck has a lot of concave so I'm not sure how well the print would come out.

10s2p for a dual application is quite weak, epsecially without any gearing. You dont mention what cells are in your pack so dont know what kind of current you're expecting to draw. But you can count on some voltage sag.

So far the things you have seem good. Maybe you wanna change the focbox connector to XT90 to be able to run more power into your focbox? Remember to also get some loctite.

An antispark/loop key is used to turn your board on/off.

Okay so an antispark is just something you connect between the battery and Focbox. Pretty sure it doesn't physically remove the connection. It has a button to turn the power on/off. I'm not 100% sure but I think it works like an E-switch on a BMS.
The thing after the battery is the antispark.
![board|690x388](upload://2VO1QiwnJKwIMeh8200h5LtaFZv.jpg)


A loop key breaks the connection between the battery and vesc physically.
![IMG_3213|666x500](upload://Wzv3Crn8DOhERV45rs4gNV9Y9j.JPG)

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loop-key-vs-on-off-button/26313

Downside of using a loop key is you will always have an open connection outside your enclosure so your board isn't waterproof. The loop key is much cheaper than the anti spark. Depends on your budget and what you feel the safest using.

![IMG_20180704_161040|281x500](upload://2MyDru2YwFG8WwrTLFpPjU5t2fK.jpg) So here's where I get to start from. Since the enclosure broke  I used duct tape to hold it on temporarily. Unfortunately it left a lot of goop behind that I need to clean off which is an absolute PITA. I bough a pressurized can of solvent made for removing bumper stickers but   it seems to do the job without stripping away the deck. A few things to note are the foot stop on the tail to help orient my prosthetic leg and make sure it doesn't vibrate off, there's also the X-Things, and while I don't really need them they look cool.

EDIT: Whoops this picture was taken before the X-Things arrived.

Here's a quick diagram showing how the battery will be connected to the focboxes. An issue I found is that the XT60 parallel connector doesn't seem to have the right configuration of M/F sockets as shown in the picture and I can't find any others online to match what I need. Am I being an idiot or is this the wrong thing?

I just bought everything else I needed including the GT2b, 97mm flywheels, random connectors, heatshrink, and wires, as well as bullet connectors. That should be everything I'm super exited to put this all together! I hope everything will arrive before the weekend but we will see.

Update time! Sadly my phone overheated in this California weather and wouldn't turn on for two days so I haven't been able to get glamour shots, but it works! Last night me and a couple friends were working on finishing everything up and troubleshooting why one motor kept cogging and such. We went on for a good four hours reassembling everything only to realize in our sleep deprived state that we didn't do detection after we were swapping phase wires. Once  both motors spun the right direction though the cheer of success throughout the room was well earned. Unfortunately I lost my charging port somewhere in the process so I only have about half a battery charge :/ 

I rode it a bit once it was finished but not for long. I can't wait to get off work and give it a go. Tomorrow I'll clean up the deck (it's so dirty) and post the final update. From there it's just a matter of saving for a 12s pack and doo-dads such as a battery meter and new enclosure.

Due to motor cut outs at full throttle or aggressive throttle, I bought a new battery sooner than expected. TorqueBoards 12s4p Will be here soon! I have a theory that the vescs wanted more power than my puny old 10s2p can output. It has some pretty heavy voltage sag and I think it just shuts down to prevent overdraw,

Battery and enclosure are here! The TB 12s4p has an xt90 connector rather than the xt60 I planned for on my old 10s2p. To solve this I ordered an xt90 to xt60 adapter which should be at my doorstep when I get home from work. I can't wait to go for a real ride!

You can see I didn't use the phase channels going into the enclosure and instead compressed the wires against the deck. I will fix this when I heatshrink the bullet connectors.

A blue car goes by. Soon after a yellow cab passes. The overhead lights change from red to green and the steady trickle of cars zoom by. *Camera zooms in* and here I am, sitting by the side of the road waiting for my motors to cool down. You might be asking how I got here, I would do the same. 

15 miles in on my first ride and I have to say this is a major step up from the Wowgo. Full 'thane wheels are amazing, I have seen the light! Aside from the super plush ride the range has amazed me as well. Right now it's at 61% so it looks like I can get over 30 miles on a single charge. Only complaint I have is the brakes aren't strong enough to hold me in place on any degree of incline so I'll have to up the power. It's certainly not stellar going in hills from a slow start buy these *are* speed drives am I rite? 

Speaking of speed I see Strava and my Android app clocked me at a maximum of 30mph. There is more to give I just need to get some pads first. Overall well worth the $1,800 total. This is a vehicle.

This is a common problem, the screws need to be almost loose. I would reccommend adding an aluminium bar or strip that runs down the length of the case. This will spread out the screw pressure more evenly and help prevent cracks

So I've been riding around d for a few days and having a grand 'ol time exploring parts of my town I've never been to before. However on my second ride one motor that's connected to the slave vesc started cogging at startup about halfway through the ride. No problems at speed but I have to give a couple kick pushes to get it started which I'm not at all a fan of. Phase wires and sensors are all good, nothing's changed after a few more trips so I'm going to poke around it this week and see if I can discover anything. Strange that it was fine for like 20 miles though and suddenly stopped working.

Small update today, I ordered a Metr Pro which I'm going to love because I'm a stats kinda guy. Also going to buy a hot glue gun to secure all my connections as well as some thin metal strips to spread load across the entire enclosure flange rather than the 6 bolts this weekend. Hopefully that fixes the problem. Oh, 2 more bolts tore off the enclosure since last time lmao.

Like the lazy bastard I am I didn't go shopping for what I needed. Alternatively Amazon is a good place to go. 

I found a slim aluminum LED light protector that you run the adhesive light bars through for protection but had a great idea to use that as my load distributor. Once it's screwed in I'll run a strip of LED's over the top to cover up the bolts. I'll have to finda  way to do so while being able to easily unscrew the enclosure at a later date. Here's a side section of what I'm talking about. My only concern is that it would be too tall for the bolts I have now but that's an easy trip to Lowes.

I had a mini heart attack yesterday evening on a ride when a phase wire came unplugged because it was too taught and pulled right out of the bullet connector. Thankfully everything still works after resoldering. I also hot glued canbus connections and power connectors because some began to loosen with all the vibrations.

Got a light, thanks @accrobrandon

I need to redo my wiring, the enclosure barely fits over everything and won't screw on, hence the dog leash lol.

I'm really having some trouble with the mount for this spotlight. I lost one bolt the first night due to vibrations but now they seem to stay in well enough with the power of red loctite. However now the nuts are being pulled from the aluminum groove in the light itself and the whole bracket falls off. I'm going to try to ride to class tomorrow night and will bring tools along with the to tighten it up as I go. For now I'll leave it off the board and let the loctite set.

I finally got around to securing the enclosure properly. I used two thin aluminum rods designed for running RGB lights across walls to spread the load across the entire enclosure flange rather than placing all the stress on 6 nuts and bolts. They're not exactly the same length but they're similar enough to where I can grind them down a bit to match. 

I definitely need shorter M5 bolts though lol.

After reinstalling my light I went for a test ride with both good and bad results.

The good: Light works well, just need to get blue loctite so I don't have to tighten it each ride. It's difficult to explain how different night skating is, it's a whole different world full of fun.

The bad: Halfway through the ride one of my motors (the one that makes slight grinding/rattling sounds, presumably the bearing) started squealing. There's more resistance when I turn it by hand. I think that bearing bit the dust. Time to open it up I guess, which I'm not looking forward to. Now I gotta buy a tube and claws! My money is slowly draining into a pile of tools I'll use once or twice.

Yep, almost definitely a bad bearing. I’d check the wheel bearings first though before taking apart the whole motor.

Replacement bearings should be here by the end of the week and the gear pulling tool arrived today so I should be able to get back up and running after Thanksgiving.

On another note, this light infuriates me. Once again vibration pulled the mounting nut out of the soft aluminum body and left me stranded in the cold needing an uber because I couldn't ride home.The mounting bolt is either too loose and vibrates apart, or it's too tight and breaks free, no in between. Lately I have been using a single bolt because the light is so F'd up. I also can't get the old broken bracket off it because I stupidly used red loctite. 

So essentially a light that should be held on by two bolts is being secured by one, which bends the metal making it even harder to secure in the future. I'm going to have to figure out how to reshape this groove that is so deformed but I honestly don't know how. 

![IMG_20181119_202608|367x500](upload://dEDjq14HUoigchZmK0fMrQvGOoZ.jpeg) 

None of this would have happened if I didn't lose a bolt on the first day I had it and thought it would be a good idea to run with a single bolt. It can't support the light on it's own it seems. Good thing I have extra hardware now I guess.

Bearings got here today. 

![IMG_20181128_174747|690x388](upload://6bMqfqgUlSFmjs8JuF2Kpu9Fphu.jpeg) 

I really should have cleaned my board before starting this lol.

![IMG_20181128_174948|281x500](upload://f9TmARFq6oYeQj6BVVvDsAuKaRz.jpeg) 

First time I took off the wheels since I built it and  roughly 600 miles down the road. Removing the wheel also removed the heat shrink from the ABEC prongs.

![IMG_20181128_180314|690x388](upload://rjAawLVkhdW0OhUKa2DIzGmGzMP.jpeg) 

Removing the motor can reveals the shiny bits all as they should be.

![IMG_20181128_175706|281x500](upload://uy5CyW9LVd23m9WPsindPS0ZxOx.jpeg) 
All the magnets in the can look good.

![IMG_20181128_200031|422x500](upload://copdJtokdQWGSdhjqqTGTXt8SKD.jpeg)  

This is the offending bearing. All i have to do is remove it and replace it with a fresh one. I ended up not needing the gear puller and large bearings but at least I'll have them on hand for future maintenance. The only issue now seems to be my inability to remove this bearing. Looks like it need to pop out from the outside of the can but it's really stuck in there. Even with a small tube that fits over the bearing from the inside lip and wacking down on the end with a small hammer didn't pop it out. Perhaps a bigger hammer?

The gear puller was useful after all. Also, I thought it interesting that the old bearing was SurfRodz branded. And yes, it is definitely seized. I couldn't spin it without the leverage of the motor can.

New bearing is in. Now all I have to do is slide it back over the stator without a metal tube to make my life easy. Oh well, just gonna take some more time and frustration. That's the whole point of building isn't it? :stuck_out_tongue:

It's a good battery pack but yes the enclosure is kinda trash, at least it's free. It was also nice not needing to worry about cutting holes in an enclosure for the charging port and such for a first time builder, but the layout is a little restricting for when I want to change enclosures down the line because all the bits I need to access are at the top of the battery.

It's just sitting in the enclosure, not really strapped in anywhere. The vescs and other bits are stuck with Velcro to the deck though.

I'm looking at getting a single 200mm Surf Rodz rkp truck but have no idea how long the axle should be (50mm-80mm?) nor do I know how to get them engraved. I can't seem to find anywhere that isn't selling less than a set either.  It would be great to have an adjustable baseplate but those don't seem to be around anymore.

Last night I stayed up late sleeving phase wires and ABS cementing bullet connectors into the side of my enclosure among other small improvements like new bushings and pivot cups (man do I have a lot of RipTide stickers now). I kinda got really into it and forgot to take photos although I managed to get a few shots. Will follow up with fun to look at photos in a bit. 

I'm loving the Surf Rodz, but the 70mm axles are definitely a bit too long and I should have stuck with 50mm. One thing to note is the 45 degree base plate doesn't fit the Carvon hanger, so for now I'm stuck with the 50 degree plate de-wedged 7 degrees. Split angles and precision trucks are awesome btw.

I’m very familiar with this. It does make me wonder what you would get when you buy stickers from them.

I also ordered 5m of sleeve. Was the smallest amount they offered.

Small list of updates to the build, I got some sick carbon fiber rectangle things courtesy of @akhlut, swapped the Funbox baseplate the Carvons came with to a Randal 35 increasing my split from 45/42 to 45/35 (still need to get a riptide pivot up for that), ditched the risers and angled risers now that I have these smaller Caguamas, and flipped the screws holding my enclosure around so the head is underneath. This looks a bit nicer underneath but I'm stepping on one of the protruding screws with my front foot so I'm probably gonna revert back to how it was.

These freaking direct drives are driving me nuts! The board sits against a wall for a month with no use and a magnet somehow breaks and a bearing seizes, seriously? Was acting funny so I ran motor detection which didn't work. I replaced the bearing after a few hours of work (rolls so quiet and smooth now) and motor detection finally works even with the broken magnet. Gonna have to fix that at some point but it works now at the very least. I also stripped  a very important screw that holds the collar on to the hanger .__. so now I have to figure out what it is, and remove the stripped one. Good news is that it's most of the way in and holding fine so against your better judgement I'm going to keep riding until it's replaced.  

Oh, and you know that annoying bearing I literally just replaced? I came back from a night ride to test my work it started making sounds again like the last one. Still free rolls fine though, and much farther than it did before so improvements have been made at the very least.

I have more than half a mind to switch this to a regular 'ol belt drive man, these are causing me so much annoyance. I lose a motor fr a few seconds on acceleration if  give it too many amps (too much throttle) and it really puts a damper on my fun. Maybe I'll take my other SR truck from my spare hub board and get some nice motors and mounts. That costs money though and I'm in the middle of building a MTB. 

I sure hope this still works by the time the Colorado trip comes around. Would super suck to have an inoperable board when it's time to leave.

Previously my light bracket fell apart during a ride so it's time to replace it. I decided to go with a different light and mounting mechanism since the old one gave me so much trouble. Hopefully this one will stand the test of time.

I also have a 6 amp charger on the way, should be much faster than the 2 amp one I'm currently using. If I go down to 10% it takes up to 10 hours to recharge and that's no bueno. It should arrive before Colorado so that will be nice. Also changing to an external "waterproof" step-down converter so my enclosure won't be as much of a pain in the ass to take off and put back on. This thing isn't intended to get wet anyway so that's fine.

Will update when things arrive.

Also, I finally logged 1k miles on this baby and I loved every one of them.

The light is here, I think it looks sleeker than the old one. And this mounting system doesn't look like it will fall apart on me either. I had to file down a fin to get it to point down far enough but I think I will have to do some more filing. Don't want to blind people.
![IMG_20190518_190108|690x388](upload://wPO5VZhQRNrKrKbxm8aFnd1THdq.jpeg) 

The converter is a bit bigger than I though it would be! Always check dimensions before you buy! I think it will be safe where I put it although it's not the prettiest. A project for a future date.

If you didn't notice I'm also running 85mm Caguamas up front (with a riser to keep the deck level and 97mm Flywheels down back while I wait for these darn kegel adapters. Can't wait for the rain to stop.
