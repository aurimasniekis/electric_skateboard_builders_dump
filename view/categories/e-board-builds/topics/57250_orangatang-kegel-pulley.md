Hi everyone,

I've got the Orangatang Kegel wheels and I'm looking to get a pulley that allows me to NOT put bolts through the holes. Any idea where I can get one?

Note that this is **NOT** what I want:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/d/5d4d75a45c142ba17c23821342642595f784f65e.jpg

I wanted something that slots into the wheel and is naturally held in place by the belt positioning and the motor mount. I'm fairly sure it's a product but I can't find it anywhere online.

Also, to top things off - I want a 15mm belt to fit on it and maybe made out of metal because I'm an 80kg rider and don't want the teeth to break while going down hill! I'm not the most confident at speed so I'll be braking regularly.

I'm also from the UK. Looking to get the motor mount, a motor and the pulley system this month and then all the other bits next month.

Thanks,
Daniel

like this

whats wrong with bolts, going to have higher tensile strength

Has to be mentioned that you need to modify your trucks for these kind of pulleys.

@electricjim79 That's the one! I don't want bolts simply because I don't think it looks very attractive haha!

@moon in what way?

fair enough, personally when putting KW of power through a drive train id rather high tensile bolts over ali or plastic pins. i was running the alienware pulley now im running the eskating.eu one both bolt through but are good solid pulleys

@moon If I went for one with bolts would I still need to modify my trucks? I don't mind modifying, but would prefer not to because I may end up changing them in the future. 

@electricjim79 That's a very good point. I guess I could get some black bolts which will blend in nicely. Do you know the answer to the question above?

No you dont need to modify the trucks.

There is currently a preorder going on for pulleys from @JLabs.  They have a integrated bearing and from what he has said it doesnt need to modify the trucks.

I decided to get the pulley from Evolve. My last 3D pulley fell apart. Not sure why!

## \#19 Posted by: MrDGOrman Posted at: 2018-10-24T15:11:25.264Z Reads: 112

Nylon carbon fiber. I think the issue may of came down to exposed belts/pulleys and stones got lodged and caused it to rip away.

For friction yes/maybe, but for layer adhesion its not :|

Not sure, but either way - the thing got bashed up and started to fall apart at the end. It's still usable but when 3D printing starts to unravel I'd rather replace it all together.

then you are printing it wrong or have too high humidity.
Nylon is the way to go for pulleys.

Ive been printing pulleys with ABS for years, it has lasted me 100's of miles.  I have 1 set that has well over 1500 miles and the wear is minimal.

Hmm...I use cheap Nylon from Microcenter https://www.microcenter.com/product/485160/175mm-natural-nylon-3d-printer-filament---05kg-spool-(11-lbs) and the layer adhesion is excellent. I use it on all my boards with no bolt pulleys. PETG didn't survive, for me.

Maybe your design was not the strongest..or i dont know what was the problem. My first designs also broke in the first 1km after i redesigned and now no problems at all .

You probably just never took a curb. PETG will shatter just like ABS. The material that will hold the abuse is Nylon - there is just no way around that. I also have printed ABS+ and while wear is minimal once you hit something it will be in pieces.

What you can hit with a pulley ? Or waht do you mean ?
PETG and ABS will deform a litle if you hit them :) 
I will test, to hit it with the hammer , but im sure it will not be in pieces :D

It's not about wear but impact resistance or temperature stability etc.

You can hit curbs - it's what happened to mine. A 40t pulley on 80mm wheels does get close to the ground so be aware of that. Stones, twigs etc. can also be a problem. I can just tell you what my personal experience has shown - you have to decide if it's worth listening to.

ABS and PETG are known to have way less impact resistance compared to Nylon or PC.

Yes it has less impact resistance , but if you hit curbs you can also broke the nylon . 
You have to make sure to have enough clearance , then nothing bad can happen

I can dig that, but like I said...1500 miles.  In that amount of time I'm sure I've banged it around and I ride in 102 degree weather on asphalt.

With "brittle" materials like ABS I'd be more worried about low temperatures (German winter can easily be -10°C for example) than the high ones.
But I'd have to check data sheets to back that up - right now it's just a feeling based on the experience I have with Stratasys ABS. My 6inch hubs made out of the same ABS are still holding up very well though.

I am also not saying ABS or PETG are the worst choice ever (I also opted to print my first pulleys with the same materials) - I am just trying to explain that with the modern Nylon filaments out there, there is no reason not to go for the better material which will result in a stronger pulley. It should just be clear that however good PETG is - Nylon will result in an even stronger pulley.
