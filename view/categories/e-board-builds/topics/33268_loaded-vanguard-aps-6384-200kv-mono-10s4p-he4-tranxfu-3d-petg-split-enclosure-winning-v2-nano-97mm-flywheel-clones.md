Also I'm going to send the focbox off to @Martinsp to see if resurrection is possible cheers dude

I've however managed to make some progress <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/c/5c9507f6a0c79a50298901524b3c6c6c6ce06d47.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/6/065cb7f0bd790d35b85443a6b34c4f897586821b.JPG" width="375" height="500">

The original enclosure holes were not big enough for the magnets I will use to keep it together so drilling it right through and will have led uplighters above the magnet with a step down from meanwell and second channel switch from turnigy

Xlr port is also too big so cut off the panel mount and hot glue it back on the inside..holesaw made quick work of that
