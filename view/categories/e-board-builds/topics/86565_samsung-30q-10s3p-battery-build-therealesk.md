Hello Everyone! 

This is my first battery build and I will upload pictures and some documents here. üôÇ

It's only a post where I document how I build my battery. 

Okay, let's go build it‚ò∫Ô∏èüñêÔ∏è
Here you can find my ordered parts for the build:

-Spot welder: https://malectrics.eu/product/diy-arduino-battery-spot-welder-prebuilt-kit-v3

-Lipo battery for the spot welder: https://hobbyking.com/de_de/turnigy-battery-nano-tech-2700mah-3s-65-130c-lipo-pack-xt-60.html

-Samsung 30Q cells: https://www.nkon.nl/de/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html

-10s Bms: https://bmsbattery.com/bmspcm/833-16889-smart-bms-10s13s-60a-with-blue-tooth-android-or-ios-app.html

-Nickel strips: https://www.amazon.de/Reines-Streifen-Batterie-Schwei%C3%9Fen-8x0-15mm/dp/B07CJDK6M4/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85Z%C3%95%C3%91&amp;qid=1552065163&amp;sr=8-3&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&amp;keywords=nickel+streifen+18650


And for sure some wires and connectors. 
The wires which I use are 10Awg and the connectors are xt60 ones. üôÇ

We won't lol. No, seriously. Ask before you do something if you are not 110% sure about it. It would be a tragedy to hear about another fire...

Better be safe than sorry

(I just mentioned the links to all of the parts which I'll useüëÜ.) 
Okay, my first step was a circuit diagram to see, how to connect each pack to the other one. 
I drew it with a pen on paper. üëá

Don‚Äôt forget to make a salt water test with the nickel to be sure it‚Äôs pure nickel.
Also would say that 3m is a bit less.
How did you plan to install the nickel.
Just on the plus/minus tap or single cell and bend over the edge?

Did you also get some fish paper to separate the packs from each other?

I used about 11 meter for my 10s6p. 7 meters could probably had done it.

11 meter

Sound about the same i used on my last pack.
But it sure also depends how you lay the nickel and how much layers you plan to add.

For sure I will build more then one battery.
Because otherwise I wouldn't had bought a spot welder. üôÇ
And idk how much nickel I'll need, but I'll build 10 pieces of 3 parallel cells packs, so i only have to cut 20x 6cm strips.

So you add up the nickel with copper braid or silicon wire?

Not how you connected the p-packs, I mean to add up the one layer of nickel. 
One layer is not enough to handle all the current you could potentially draw with this battery pack.

I highly recommend you to read through this thread if you didn‚Äôt already made this.

Has anyone use the NKON soldering tags?  I'm thinking about using them instead of a spotwelder and soldering to a line if 10awg (12s4p) but I dont see the fishpaper ends.  Can you add fish paper under the tags?
```

## \#22 Posted by: legend27 Posted at: 2019-03-09T20:29:21.137Z Reads: 127

Yes.

Are you going to spot weld 1 layer of nickel strip on the cells and then add 10 awg wire on the whole nickel strip?

Bend it up, use fishpaper, bend it down.
But I would check the thickness of the strips before

That depends on the size and thickness of your nickel strip, aaand if it‚Äôs real pure nickel or not.

8mm X 0.15mm probably 12A. I honestly got no idea but a good thumb rule is 1 layer ofnickel strip (10mm X 0.15mm) for each cell in parallel.

personally I don't really like how he builds his batteries. Balance cables on the side, no fish (except on positive side) paper and very little nickel strip.

Most people I see only use 1 layer of nickel on the parallel group and it works fine for them, but i'm really skeptical.

I would use copper instead of nickel after what @rojitor said

will make a diagram with nickel in a bit

1 strip of nickel is mostly fine for parralel packs (unless it's really thin.

Just do the resistivity calculation taking into consideration the length of nickel strip to copper wire with the maximum current draw. After doing that I came to the conclusion 1 strip was enough for my 4p pack. 


But I also used 3 wires to connect my 4p pack to try and ensure an even current flow through all cells which reduces the current the nickel needs to carry.

I reacently built my first battery, I used two pieces of 14awg wire, that way the current is spread more across the nickel parallel connection resulting in less heat generated. Here‚Äôs a few pics for examples![image|375x500](upload://v6lcpUf5BEYXHuuxT32QsmOgC63.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://20dq8PqiqMEoV9JhjgIYl2s5ARz.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://7ZS74lhL6TfPePq9XeqVGdgejUu.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://4v9n535L5LMK6rs10FgMxAGSWry.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://5KOfbxiBe2ZJ0zf84RYXnMg6zgj.jpeg) 

I also used two balance leads one to the bms and one to the outside of my enclosure for easy monitoring

Ps. The welds look very dark, that is due to bad lighting and pieces of the welding tips being left at the weld site

Thanks, the hardest part is trying to keep the balance wires separate, although it was impossible for me since I have two lots of wires so so had to cross no matter what I did

Flood the battery sound a bit crazy.
Also hot glue is not the best solution as it deformes with heat.
There is nothing wrong in fixing the balance wires with some silicon though.
Just take care the the positive terminals are free from any silicon or glue.
You don‚Äôt want to close the gas valves.
