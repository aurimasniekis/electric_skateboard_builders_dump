Hi, just kindly wanted to remind there is this cool website called: 

http://esk8builds.com

So yes, to all the newcomers to the forum, also welcome to visit it and post your own build, when it is complete!

The more builds, the better! 

---

'Registration' is easy and all fields dont need to be completed, just a picture is also good at times!

Though the more complete is the desciption, the better and easier for others to appreciate the build!

.builds is not a valid TLD

I think it's esk8builds.com

So far there's 'only' 134 eboards on the site, would be cool if this number could be pushed till 500 some day!

Hi! 

This is my first eskate build. I got a lot of inspiration from this website so hopefully someone gets from my post too! 

Deck: Airflow Slap, I shitty painted with gold spray paint which i found from my closet.

Enclosure: First i made a mold of hard foam which was easy to cut and sand. I attached the mold to the board with two-sided tape. Then I covered the mold and board with thin tape so the epoxy wouldn't stick to the board and mold,(i forgot to order PVA release agent). 
I hand layed with epoxy, 3 sheets fiberglass and on top 3 sheets of carbon fiber. It was much more easy to lay fiberglass then carbon fiber. It's hard to shape tight corners! 


All the other parts I bought from Diyeboard.com. I don't now is this the right place to post this but please send me links where i should!

@Petsku

Hi, there generally is esk8 builds section on forum, where u can post your build.

As I cant edit my first post anymore, then im sharing this screenshot, for others who dont want to open the link 

![image|689x349](upload://kjdC7Jb3Y3JgegKyiVi0t6n5ltC.jpeg) 

It allows filtering of the boards, lets to see their cost, weight, range and other parameters straight away.

Site also has a collection of esk8 links / shops and other relevant info!
