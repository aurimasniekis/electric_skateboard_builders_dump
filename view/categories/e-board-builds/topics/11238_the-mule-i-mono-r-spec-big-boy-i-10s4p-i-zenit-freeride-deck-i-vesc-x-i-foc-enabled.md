Lets start with the deck

**Zenit freeride**
http://www.zenitboards.com/freeride
This deck is really nice, highly recommend this one for e-sk8
Black fywheel clones

**enertion 6374 big boy & mount**
Very simple to slap all together

**custom 10S4P battery**

**enertion enclosure**

**Winning remote**
Haven't had any issues with this remote, i did the failsafe procedure, nothing else

**vesc-X**
I have no problem getting behind this new vesc, compact footprint, easy usb access, just plain works. Been rolling on FOC, only thing i hear is the noise of the strap and pulleys, very quiet build.

Here is my referral link!

Will be gradually adding pics and videos. I have a nice one going up a steep hill, not able to quantify the gradiant though. I'm the one in front being filmed.

God Damn it....
how did u put your hands on an Enertion BMS ??? 
what are the specs on your battery :D ah...sorry just saw now the edit...from one of the pictures it looked like you had a double stack on each side....i was wondering if that did not surpass the depth of the enclosure

I was filming, the ride is not very interesting but it's demonstrate the stealthiness of FOC, turn the sound up

Why did you buy 2100mAh, 30A drain cells instead of cheaper 3000mAh, 20A drain?

Lower internal resistance ( = less voltage sag, less heat... )
Important for climbing long / steep hills.

Do the Sony vtc4 have almost no voltage sag in 10s4p? In comparison to an lg he4 or 2 or even the Samsung 25r?
