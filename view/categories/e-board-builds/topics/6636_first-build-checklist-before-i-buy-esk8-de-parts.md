[eSk8.de complete kit DUAL assembled (incl. axes, motors, brackets](https://store7570530.ecwid.com/#!/eSk8-de-Komplett-Kit-DUAL-vormontiert-inkl-Achsen-Motoren-Halterungen-etc/p/59162342/category=15255001)

90mm bigfoot wheels, Wheel pulley 36t, Motor pulley 15t.
Unsure whether to get the sensored motor or the other one.

Are these a good brand?

Or should I get the nyko kama controller?

I have a board. 

Is there anything else I need? connectors and stuff?

Any other alternative parts in Europe I should look into?

Only other thing I would recommend is an anti spark loop key for which you will need 2 xt90s connectors. And  if you are running 12s you will need a BEC
