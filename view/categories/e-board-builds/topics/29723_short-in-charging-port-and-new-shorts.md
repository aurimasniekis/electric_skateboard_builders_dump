I am in the process of taking apart a curret build to add to it. I had everything unhooked except the charging port, BMS, 10s battery, and the power switch. Not sure what happened but as I picked up the charging port it shorted out and popped in my hand. After realizing my fingers were still in one piece I disconnected the battery and started trying to figure out what happened. The only thing I can see is the inside of the charging port is charred and totally black. It was a 5.5 2.1mm female DC connector. Now I need a new one and Amazon only sells packs of 10-100!

Maybe something wasn't properly insulated? Same thing happened to me before, but for different reasons. My dumbass decided to test the voltage through the charging port. Tada <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/5/d5693e526db0099a6b1e8eb3a959e77bc3e3dc1a.jpg" width="666" height="500">

This is weird anyway same thing but 12s2p happend today with my port but my dumbass ordered some plugs and thought ok I will replace it I get them in and I try to cut off the old one but u probably aren't supposed to do that cause Sparks flew so now it is in the very back of my grarge and I am scared for my life if it will blow up or if I just broke a $200 dollar battery what do I do now.(any way if I am invading your post just tell me and I will make my own.)

There was only one wire that was the trippy thing or that is what it looked like

If it made a spark when you cut it then there was a positive and negative wire. When you cut them the metal cutting tool completed the circuit and it sparked. Don't ask me how I know.....

Yeah that makes a ton of sense how the metal completes the circut so what should I do with the battery

The insulated one should be positive. The wires around it are negative

I'm not 100% sure how that battery pack is wired. I would message whoever you bought it from for advice!
