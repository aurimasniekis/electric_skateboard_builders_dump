Everything seems ok except the remote...this one is not reliable from what I have heard...just buy GT2B, Mini remote or Benchwheel remote :) 
The deck should be ok, you could post some dimensions so we could say clearly if it is ok :)  (length, wheelbase, flex)

The usability of your deck is dependent on flex. Too much flex means that it could potentially damage the batteries that you use. If it is stiff, you're good to go

You are going to have an 8S battery setup, which means you will have 29.6V or at full charge 33.6V.
With that voltage you motor KV is a little low i figured. You could ge more out of your system with a higher kv motor.
Check this [post](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/choosing-the-right-motor-kv-for-the-vesc/3125) out.

I am currently running an 8s 190kv build and I love it, 24 MPH top speed is what I got but I am a teenager so it might vary depending on weight, riding conditions, etc.

I know that it is probably going to work well. I am just saying that you could get more out of your eskate for pretty much the same money.
