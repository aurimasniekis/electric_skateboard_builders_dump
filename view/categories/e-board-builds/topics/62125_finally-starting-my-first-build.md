So after some research I decided that I wanted to make my own esk8. I want to make the deck myself and for the rest of the board I found these on diyeboard.com.
http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-18650-lithium-battery-pack-36v-10ah-360wh-with-charger-p-655.html 
I wanted a big battery because I want to use it to travel to school, that's 36km for me so I thought this would do the job.
http://www.diyeboard.com/v11-single-belt-motor-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-523.html
I thought that this esc was at a good price and it has a power switch, I might go for a vesc instead but I don't really know which vesc to buy
http://www.diyeboard.com/single-belt-drive-1400w-n5055-motor-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-421.html
So I want to be able to go at least 25km/h and probably not more than 35km/h would this motor be good or should I use something else?

Because I am going to make my own deck I wil make the enclosure as well so it will hopefully perfectly fit. For the deck I was planning on using 4 pieces of plywood, and in the bottom two I wanted to make a hole for the battery and esc, would this be strong enough? The plywood is 3mm thick. 

So do you guys think that this is enough for my needs(I'm 65kg btw). Would the deck be strong enough or should I use something like carbon fiber to strengthen it?

that build is budget. 36km u wont get!
if you want to go 36km to school, buy or build an hig end board.
not diyeboard..
my opinion

It depends on the cells, that particular 10s5p uses LG MF1 cells.

It's a cheap low capacity cell.

You would need a crazy efficient drivetrain to reach 36km with that battery. At some point during the ride, the voltage sag will be too much and you will barely move.

Okay so here's some questions and opinions that came to mind:

* In which country do you live?
* What is your absolute spending limit for now, will you get more funds in future?
* What is the benefit of laminating your own deck from plywood? It's incredibly hard to do without cracks that didn't get enough pressure/glue, when you don't have a proper Skate deck press.
If the benefit is cost reduction, I'm sure there are acceptable vanilla flavoured decks on ebay for 40$
* If you want to stay cheap, go for single drive
* Scavange the forum for used parts
* Don't buy crap from diyeboard because it's cheap. When you want to go 36km on your board (which is very doable) then you need reliable parts.
* get 10s4p Samsung 30q and you're golden on the range.
* if you need a cheap Vesc based ESC, get the hobbyking sk8 one

I live in the netherlands, my budget right now is around €450(will become more, but right now this is it) and I wanted to make my own board but if its hard to do I might get a cheap deck somewhere else. Where could i get those batteries?

I know this is props not what you want to hear but the lowest threshold to building a quality board is around 700€. I think below that you might be better off just buying one of the regular ready made china boards.

Vesc (ish)
Proper Samsung, Sony etc Battery
BMS
Reliable remote
(used) original Kegels or Abecs

That's more or less it and I think these are hard to reach with a <700 budget.

So I should get another esc, I will probably get a battery from @pjotr47 if he still can. Is there really a lot of difference between remotes, if so I think I will get the one from alien power. And I will probably upgrade the wheels later.

10s5p can probably go 36km guys. My board is 12 5500mah lipos (so about 12s2p) and it goes about 11 miles, which is about half of that. That's on shitty roads, fair number of hills, dual motors so less efficient than a single motor.

Thanks for the information, I live in the Netherlands though, so I don't have any hills, the roads are pretty good as well and I'm going to use a single motor so that should be quite a difference. 

I also don't think I'm going to buy the 10s4p battery right now. I will probably go for some cheaper lipos first and build the rest of the board, when I got some more money I can always choose to upgrade to a 10s4p, right now that just seems to expensive

I can vouch for the alien power systems remote. Go for the one with the red handle part, It might not be pretty but it was very reliable for me and has a good length of trigger movement.

if your on a budget just get the cheap 10s5p battery and buy a spare battery, you possibly could get one of their smaller batteries  and keep it in a backpack just in case you need extra range, just design the enclosure  so the battery is easily accessible then you can simply do a quick swap if needed

So after all recommendations I decided that I would probably be better of if I just buy a €40 board from amazon or eBay. For the rest of the parts I decided to change it up aswell.

The motor I want to use is a 6374 192kv motor from hobbyking. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?wrh_pdp=7 

I want to use a vesc but I don't know where to buy it, so suggestions would be nice(please remember that I'm from the Netherlands and don't want to pay to much for shipping). 

First I wanted to use belts but I heard that a sprocket would be more quiet so I will get one from aliexpress. Should I use this or is a belt still better? https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/New-Electric-Skateboard-Replace-Part-Sprocket-Chain-Wheel-DIY-Set-Motor-Wheel-Sprocket-For-Electric-Scooters/32803724992.html

I want to use the motor mount from hobbyking. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html

I don't know what controller I will use, I might go for the alien power controller. What other controller could I use?

I will probably get a 10s1p battery from @pjotr47 , I will upgrade this later to a 10s4p but right now this will have to do. 

Am I missing anything? And will this work together?

I get that, but do you think this would be good enough to not fall apart after a few rides?

@Stef1, go with 
Caliber 2's
@dickyho new caliber mount ( he released them today,  we'll test them when they arrive)
@johnny_261 pulleys or @marcmt88 pulleys  
Go with belt, get them from ebay.
At least hobbyking vesc/flipsky vesc
Motor is fine although you could go with HK esk8 specific motor.
@pjotr47 / @Acido battery
Wowgo metal enclosures or meepo plastic ones. 

If you want to use HK mount, use their trucks, just upgrade to Riptide @Alphamail bushings.
Edit: street board uses around 10wh/km. So for 35km you'll need 10x35=350wh. Equals to 30 cells of 30Q

I want to keep the cost down, so I might upgrade the trucks later on but first I will just use what's on the board. Why do you recommend pulleys and a belt over a sprocket and a chain? I will make my own wooden or carbon enclosure.

I know this but I will upgrade the battery later, probably to a 10s4p so I would have enough power with that battery
