Is the battery setup I have fine for my build in terms of range and power? I am going to try 3D printing my whole drive train, and I know that its not something that works for most people, but the printer that I use is probably a step higher than what most have, so I should be fine. If it doesn't work I'll buy the kit I have listed. Anything glaringly wrong with the build/ anything I can upgrade? trying to keep the build under 400-450 not necessarily including the deck. 

Thanks!

A lot of those parts look like good choices, except the charger.  See my other post though, there is a very important detail missing.

@SetoKaiba the charge is fine.

@b264 I think what you mean is the charger is not portable and is not best for beginners...

I mean taking your enclosure off to charge the board means you will have zero water resistance and zero waterproof.  Also it won't be nearly as fun to use.  And your enclosure mounting will wear out.

You do know you can use a hobby charger then a charge port right?

@SetoKaiba at this point you might as well get a brick charger

Or keep the hobby charger and adding a charge port and bms to the pack and using the hobby charger as a 6s charger

@b264 That's not true, I did it for 8 months and I enjoyed every part of it, breaking mutiple abs enclosures, loosing bolts and nuts, and louseing  lots of elbow grease ðŸ˜‰

Well hobby chargers are meant for lipos and so you connect the balance leads to the charger to balance the cells so no bms is required

But in a brick charger setup, you have a bms with the battery part that balances the cells

Bms= battery management system

Huh? That would be called a antispark switch and a inline fuse

@b264 want to talk about Antispark's?

Well there are the switches that have replaceable fuses on them. Let me see if i can find what I'm talking about

Which serve the same function as anti spark afaik

Um for esk8 we need high amperage and high voltage switchs

Which is why we have Antispark's

But I would recommend a xt-90 antispark, easy and dimple and prevents the initial spark

And only cost 2$

The single boards are easier to waterproof with conformal coating.  Make sure you get one that balances -- if there is no balance current listed, it doesn't balance!

You can also 3D print an enclosure, I made one that clamps onto my deck and has a lid that can be unscrewed to take out the lipo battery for charging. ![image|666x500](upload://kTKbNUOmbnKNUS5IMVXKKhpzQqH.jpeg)

I assume you're talking about 4000mAh or milliamphours and not 4000mah or milliattohours

Yes, 4000mAh at 6S will get you about 3-5 miles (5 - 7 km)

4000mah won't get you very far at all, less than a millimeter of range.

Words have meanings -- and, in science, units have specific meanings, and if you want to try to pretend to be an engineer, you should act like you've finished science class in school.

So I've done a metric ass ton more reading on BMS. Thinking of getting [this one](https://www.ebay.com/itm/6S-22-2V-Li-ion-18650-Lithium-Battery-Packs-BMS-Protection-PCB-Board-w-Balance/192307924973?hash=item2cc6720fed:g:hJkAAOSwm9tZvIi~) from ebay and bypassing discharge, which I can do because I'm using the VESC. Last thing I really can't find is info on charging ports and chargers to go with the BMS... could you help me out with that? Most of the threads that exist for BMS are for 10/12s packs and use different chargers and BMS than I need 

Thanks

I've got a wiring diagram made up, last question I have I think is my fuses. From other threads you seem to know them pretty well. I have circled where I think I need a fuse (neg side of charging port as you recommend), given my charger gives 1A, seems like a 4-8 amp fuse would work. ![Wiring%20Diagram|386x500](upload://jUyYD9xM8ph2AX94An8mrIxohQv.jpeg) I'm by no means an electrical engineer, but my diagram looks pretty solid to me from my research, and should fit into a pretty small enclosure. Thanks for all your help I really appreciate you helping a newbie out.

That looks correct :slight_smile:

[Fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) where the circle is, you can make that part (for charging) 22AWG or bigger wire.  The big wires need to be 12AWG or bigger.

It's better if they are 10AWG but it all depends.  If you're only running 41A battery (or 20A + 20A) or less, 12AWG is fine.
