I'm currently riding the Orangatange 85mm Caguma wheels and was thinking about getting the Boosted Stealth 85mm wheels. Can someone confirm that the TB kegel style wheel pulley ([this one](products/36t-15mm-kegel-drive-wheel-pulley)) will work on these?

I don't think so. The TB wheel pulleys are bolt on, so there is a need for a through hole. The boosted wheels seem to be more for a slip on pulley, as the holes are only on one side, and don't pass through.

If you have a drill with the right sized bit, i 'd say you can try drilling the hole all the way if you really want to use these wheels.

Bummer. The grey/black stealth wheels are growing on me, but i'll just stick with the orange caguma's until I find something that will work with the pulley or doesnt require drilling. Thank @Linny

If you're looking for black colored 'kegel' style wheels. There's the @OllinBoardCompany Popocas.

Fan of the 90mm for high speed and 78a for a softer/grippier ride, but i love the 58.5mm width on the orangatangs.

if you are careful enough you could drill through. On a vertical drill for example. 

Boosted original pulleys fit cagauamas, so they should have the same pattern.
