SOOOOO EXCITED. anyways... here are my parts that i am going to use. Please tell me any notes or concerns you guys have or problems u see that might arise that a noobie like me wouldnt see. I would very much appreciate that from you guys. THANKS!! :smiley:

Batteries are okay but you will get better performance with batteries that have a higher c rating.
If you are going 10s I suggest you buy a 190kv motor if you don't want to blow your vesc.
Check your local hardware store. They sell wire for cheap.

21kv  and 10s should be fine. It will only be 55000 erpm.

That's true. Most of us use 190kv motors so that's why I said that.

 The vesc haves a male xt90, so I would recommend to get some. Also didn't notice if you getting on/off switch, if not you could just make a loop key with a xt90 anti spark

I believe if you don't have a loop key or on/off switch and by just plugging in to the vesc and disconnecting without one could cause harm to your vesc. Loop keys are very simple to make, just make the loop coming from the negative side. That's what I do. For on/off switch I'm not to familiar with those yet due to not trying it out yet but I'm sure someone here be glad to explain

@PeterMcKane 
213kv and 10s is 62622 erpm at full charge 42v.
It might be ok still because it is close to the limit.
Note that many motors have a lower real KV than what is stated.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/realistic-kvs-and-you/23346
With a higher KV motor, you get more top speed and you can run higher motor amps without overheating the motor. Higher motor amps will give you more power to compensate for the less torque of the higher KV.
Honestly, I have used Both 230KV motors and 190kv motors and really didn't see a noticeable difference in torque between the two.

I don't think you should pay 60$ for a remote people said had connection losses with.
This remote is cheaper and has a better reputation for reliability. 
If you want it to come fast you can pay extra 14$ for 5-8 day shipping.

5ah 20c batteries would work but you will have what I would call excessive voltage sag.
You would do much better with batteries that are above 50C
Stick with Silicone wire, even though it is more expensive. It has higher current capability and is more heat resistant than regular wire.

60K should be a safe setting for the erpm limit. And un-check the limit erpm with negative torque box.
I would also suggest running the motor in bldc mode to reduce the risk of DRV failure.

Don't mess with FOC unless your going to get a FocBox or an Escape or Vesc6

They are specially designed to run FOC
The older 4.12v Vesc are not and although they will run it, there is a risk of burning out the DRV on the Vesc.

It doesn't. You'll lose some top end speed, but it's really good for 0-3 km/h. That's why we use hybrid mode with sensors.

It will start from a stop.  An unsensored motor you have to kick-push first, then once you're rolling, it can take you.

I have "cheaped out" on motor mounts and it is a MAJOR pain in the A**. Get motor mounts that are backed by the community even if they seem overpriced. otherwise you will be left re-adjusting your motor mount constantly.

UPDATE: I just bought the parts. Instead of TB VESC, i got maytech. not sure if im gonna be satisfied since lots of people say maytech is bad but also people say TB is bad so dont know for sure. I got maytech vesc for $20 cheaper ($90 + shipping).

i will prob need help configuring it as well, so if anyone can help me with that. i would appreciate that. i have read for numerous hrs but still got some personal questions that i need to ask but i will ask them later.

anyways, heres to good luck on my first build. im excited.

Sorry for hijacking but can someone explain how you calculate the 60.000 erpm limit, and what factors to use?

Cause I just thought it was: kv * volt = rom, but that just gets me to 7000-9000 and all the talk of 55.000-60.000 makes me think I'm missing something :slight_smile:

Thanks
