Hello,

So this will be my first DIY build electric skateboard. Oke my first (electric) skateboard at all. First my name. I am Frank Pot from the Netherlands and I am 21 years old. Currently studying Mechanical engineering in Groningen. A little time ago, a friend of my (@zeinstra) was building an electric skateboard. After seeing him drive, I had to build my own so here I am.
Many things will be new for me, so have I absolutely no experience with skating or anything like it. To learn some skating before I can drive electric I bought a second hand board.

The next problem was the design. Belt, inline or hub motor. The first thing what fell of was the belt drive. I do not like external belt/motors. The following problem was that most inline/hub motors do not have a reduction. That was one of the disadvantages of the inline drive of Eldert Zeinstra(if you ask me). So I want a direct or hub motor with a reduction. The only solution what I thought of was a planetary gearbox in front of the motor. 
So some evenings behind the pc and I had a design of the wheel.

I am now in the stage that I buy all the necessary stuff so I hope I can give you some nice updates the coming time about process. 

Best Regards,
Frank Pot

Nice, but the 4260 300kv motor will be a Alien's one?

really nice design, but you should use a bigger motor!
5065 at least but a 6355 with >=90mm wheels would be awesome!

and the down side of gears is the noise!! looks stealth but they will hear you coming!!

@IsTalo The motors are indeed aliens.

@saul Bigger motors do not fit. This is the "easiest" design. 
About the noise. I think if you manufacture them right(I will make them) and use good lubrication the sound will be acceptable. If you look at the design you can see red lubricant behind the acrylic plate.

Because of that i made a couple of changes. The design looks al little different now. To give you a look on the inside i made a small video with the disassembly of the wheel.

@peter yes@peter yes the idea is the same but totally different designs.
@trampalovesshekels i dont know what that has to do with my build. I also life in the Nederlands‚Ä¶ So i didnt have any idea. 

Today i put the motors on the lathe.

Weekend, so time for some tests. To be sure, that everything fits when I finaly make them of steel (C45). So I printed the Hub with my 3D printer and it fits perfect. Hopefully I have the materials next week so i can start.

Big moment :grinning:. I made the first parts today. Unfortunately, I could not do it before. Not long after my last post, I had an accident at football (Torn shoulder tendon). Since that moment, I cannot use my right arm. Therefore, turning on the lathe is a no go. Until today. I did some preparation for the EDM and made the first part.
Enough for now, here are some pictures. :sunglasses:

Not that much. :neutral_face: I still waiting on the EDM machine but I have hope that I can use it in de next 2 weeks.

I also made a stupid mistake by trusting that the outer diameter of the motors where the same (there was 0.15mm different).  Therefore, I need to make some parts for the second time.

Enough of the negativity. I made some parts, pictures :grin:


One part I made again, this time 0.15mm smaller so now it is perfect.

99% of skate and longboards i see are rubber sealed (RS). So i say no problem. Less dirt but a very bit more friction the choice is yours
```

---
## \#30 Posted by: Frank Posted at: 2017-05-22T07:17:27.501Z Reads: 612

```
The extra resistance of a rubber seal bearing vs a steel shielded bearing is not that much, but the sealing is a lot better.  The steel sealing doesn‚Äôt protect the bearing  from sand and other small things. Therefor the bearing will be damaged a lot faster and the resistance will be a lot higher.

@nordle I saw your original post. A friend of my made a hub motor but he has problems at low speeds(bad breaking/acceleration), so a reduction is necessary if you ask me. The problem was that I like hub motors because you cannot see that it is electric. So there it was a hub motor with reduction.  
Another thing that I like is building something unique and off course the challenge of building it.

Not necesary i think if you take low kv 50 to 100 i can calculate speeds around 30-40km/h for longboard sized wheels. That is what our belt friends mostly aim for.
Really nice work however, i always like to see new exciting builds!

@TSG_AU @Nordle this are standard ball bearings, not low friction or non-contact seal bearings. But it is an electric skateboard so I can deal with the extra friction.

UPDATEEE :heart_eyes:

The last couple of days I had some time to do some lathe and ADM work. First, I made a gear profile in the motor ‚Äúhub‚Äù. After that, I made the gear the right length end internal dimensions. I also changed the sensors for the motor. Thereby I was able to lower the sensor PCB by 1 mm. just enough to fit everything in the wheel assembly.

Thereby the first part of the assembly is now finished. I have all the internal parts of the hub motor. 





Time for picatures :grin:

The dawning of belt drives has begun :smiling_imp:

I think this is gonna be the future of hubs if the gears stay that silent after hitting the first bumps on the street. The gearing ratio will allow to make a perfect fit to the sweet spot of the motor where efficiency is at it's best ... I'm looking forward to my VESC driven dyno (under construction).

Congrats!

to be a planetary gearbox, shouldn't there be 3 small gears connecting the motor gear with the wheel gear ? 
Atm the wheel is just spinning with the motor (1:1 ratio) or what am i missing ?

Thanks for the positive reactions
However, as @XIII said the gearbox is not ready yet. So the sound is something mistreatment. 

@XIII   
You are right. The motor is not finished yet. I do not have the three planet gears. I will make them in the following weeks. The motor can now turn freely in the wheel but due the friction of the seal and bearings, the outside turns as well.

the front of the hub motor will look like this when finished.

Hello Frank! 

This is Tim from STARY here, we love that you took inspiration from our design and are excited to see how you can improve on it! We are more than welcoming of supporting the DIY community because we believe that this is the future as well. One piece of advice though, the gears undergoes a high amount of stress under braking so be sure to consider that in your design/plans for the strength of the gears. A failure or shattered gear at maximum breaking under top speed would be quite dangerous so be sure to test under a safe environment! Looking foreward to seeing how your project goes after you finish final assembly, it's really quite impressive. 

Cheers,
STARY Team 
Shanghai, China

A long time since my last post. Too long but yesterday I made the last gears for the planetary gearbox. What I can see and test it looks promising. The gears turn freely with in the assembly and no strange things. 

Just 1 part to test the full assembly :grinning:

@STARY thanks. Yea I saw that your boards had also a planetary gearbox, very nice. I am one part left to a fully assembly so the end is in sight. 

@BoostedBuilder i am very busy with other projects (also building a cnc milling machine) so it takes time, more than I like. 

@IsTalo i will but it is nothing special. It is just a thread connection. 1 the right and 1 with left thread.

I do not know much about the STARY board only read about the noise if I am correct. 

The idea with planetary is great but the built is so much work. I would say almost a no go for us DIY builders. I started more than a half year ago and still busy with the first wheel. However, hopefully it will be worth it, we will see.

If someone is wondering how much I spent in this built I did a calculation and the total built cost will be round the 850 euro.

We are going fast. Last week I made the last hub for the second motor. The gear and the outer ring I made with the EDM machine after that it was the lathe.

This was the last difficult and most time-consuming part left so the finish line is in side. After that the next project starts. Building a batterypack.

As last I test printed the last part to see if it would fit and it does. Next week I will cnc the part 2 times.

@Frank, you are doing very nice job man! Looking forward to see it in action. So far it seems to be the only way to make small hub motors efficient and use smaller diameter wheels. You need all parts to be top quality though, to make it also practically good.

Thanks 

@fliess
Yes, you are right. My luck is that I can make everything myself + i did the designing. So almost every part that is important I can make in one go. The other parts (only the hub I think) I made within a clamp error of 0.02mm so I think that is enough.

@PXSS
 haha i cant wait either. :smile:

Not that much. 1 made the second hub so now i have 2 complete motor assemblages missing both 1 part. Hopefully i can make them next week.

@Eboosted what @BoostedBuilder said is right. it is just an reduction. the same idea as an belt drive only now internal and with gears. 

@Nordle nice im building also an cnc mill at the moment. What @pxss already said i made the gears with an EDM machine with an tolerance of 0.01mm. most parts i made are within 0.02mm because you dont want a lose bearing or put to much pressure in it.

@Fatos No I was to enthusiastic that I damaged one motor. I fucked up the windings. I already contacted some motor manufactures but it is very expansive or the delivery time is end of January. Therefore, I will rewind them myself. I get the wire tomorrow so I hope to test it soon.

@Eboosted You can compare the friction with a belt drive I think. That is without the oil seal. I removed that because the friction was too high.  I will now use grease.

Cool build log. Thanks for introducing to all the machining tools and jargons :slight_smile:

I think your topic does deserve build of the year or similar title.. too bad we dont have special category on the forum.. :D

As everyone.. really waiting to see it in action, looks like that projects like these do take some time to accomplish :slight_smile:

---

On a side note, since you are good with machining parts - 


What do you think about **dual wheel drive with single motor**, where there is a differential in the 'middle'? 

---
**How difficult such project would be?** 

It is meant more for mountainboard, so there is more space..

I was originally thinking about fitting inner gear into existing wheel / outside of sprocket, then run an axle to the other side (with differential in the middle?) and then connect that to the second wheel..

If this would be possible within, lets say 50 - 80 eur range, that would be a success, since lowest cost for 5060 or so motors is about 35-40 eur, calculate controller + some wires on top of it = it becomes almost 80 eur, 

plus the motor mount etc but im not including mechanical parts here.

---
So yeh, 'cheap' single motor driven dual wheel 'system' would be awesome, if it could be machined / made personally. 

Ive got 6374 motor, so it has more than enough power to drive 2 wheels, I think..

---
The only unclear part is this differential.. On another thread someone mention that for 1/8 size rc cars something useful could be found, since it is all metal there, too..

@Okami haha thanks! I hope you and all the others liked my topic and get some ideas/learned something.

I cannot also wait but because 1 motor is broken I need too rewind it first (didn‚Äôt had the time jet).

I think a differential wound be very cool(maybe an new project :cold_sweat: but I think it is not cheaper than an dual drive because you can‚Äôt buy an differential(accordingly to @ugothakd )  and making one takes time, lots of it I think.

Ehm im not certain but if im correct 2,45. Not that much but the problem was that the inner gear will be smaller when you reduce it more and that would give problems with bearings..

Nicee that I inspired more people to build an planatairy drive. You will learn so much by building something like this.

I am still hope mine will work but the experiance is already totally worth it

Yes the main design i did in solid works. Only for the gears, I used another program. Because the gears in solidwork are only cosmetic, (on the first hand, they look good but they are simplified. Therefor not useable for EDM).

haha thx komt vast wel goed! ze kunnen ook niks voorzich houden he...:stuck_out_tongue:

so because i need to wait untill i have new motors(2-3 weeks) i made some preparations for the battery and enclosure. 

offcource im going to make an custom one that fits perfect on my board. So i draw a enclosure mold so i can do some vacuum forming. it is not so spectacular but here is a picature:

there is room enough between the Pcb for cooling. heat blocks on the fets doesn‚Äôt do anything because all the heat of the fets are transported to the pcb. So placing heat blocks on top of the fets looks really stupid and also are not effective at all. 

Thereby I know people that place the vescs way more conpact than me so I don‚Äôt see any problem.

Very god damn impressive. I am quite jealous of those sexy EDM parts you got your hands on...my oh my.

But all in all this will probably be more of a design challenge for you in the end than a functional e-board, just because of the small motors and low transmission ratio in your gear system. If you went so far already with the designing and custom parts, why not just find some suitable wheels to house bigger motors :) hell, it seems you could just cast urethane wheels yourself without issue..

I don't think it is strange of dumb that the production boards show you how they do it. They need to make money. 

But about my hub. In one of my first post, I have a video of the assembly of the hub. Everything is custom made (except the stator and rotor). I press fit the stator around my axle. The axle is screwed in the trunk(that i made myself). 

@bevilacqua didn't do that much the last time. Finished my enclosure and battery. After that, it was waiting on new stators but they arrived last week. now I need to make time to finish it

true... it isnt really strange that the production boards basically hide stuff from you so people dont go and just build it themselves... 

im not sure how "Press fit" works... 

is it true that you have some kind of square part of the truck that holds the motor in place?... and i guess a bolt which acts as the axle.. is this a feature of the premade stators that you had no choice on? 

im actually looking for one of these r-spec/maytech style motors for a custom truck i have...

but i am also looking for hub motors that can bolt onto ANY normal paris truck or venture trucks or ANYTHING... perhaps with some kind of hex screw tightening onto it... or something like that... 

is your motor either of these?

a press fit is when your hole is slightly smaller than the axle (think in 0.01 of an mm)
![afbeelding|325x500](upload://nXZRK3PF6y0HAIUja8zbhlZ553X.png)

I don't have a square part or something only the press-fit to lock it.

no, my hub doesn't fit on a normal truck. it is way smaller (126mm if I'm correct). My goal wasn't to make a hub that fit on a normal truck because a truck was a piece of cake if you look at the rest.

you mean that the truck axle wouldnt be long enough for the width of this hub motor compared to say a regular long board wheel? what if i were to cut away some of the truck hanger to expose more of the axle??

the aluminum part is 126mm, the total length is the same as a normal truck (don't know the measurement).

If you look at my truck axle you see it is totally different from a normal truck one. so making one myself was easier.

long time no see. I can say that I finished the project and something that I was scared of came true. The space between motor and the outer ring is too small therefore the loss in eddy current is too big. Maybe I will modify it later to (hopefully) fix it.

For now, I will change to belt drive because i want to drive this year.

i will upload some videos later

You mean that the cilinder that the magnets are mounted are too close to the outer wheel cilinder and the magnetic flux behind the magnets are inducing a current on the outer cilinder?

i bought a torqueboard truck but it was way to big so i made it al little smaller(40mm)

then designed mymounts (15mm alu with 4mm stainless steel)

Hello Frank. I'm very interested in one of your builds, the planetary hub gearbox for a electric longboard. I was doing research on planetary gear boxes because I'm going to be building a electric long board w/ a planetary hub when I stumbled on your build. I just have a few questions. How did you get your ratio? Meshing? With the knowledge I have, the gearboxes purpose is to decrease top speed and bump up torque to the wheels...? Any recommendations as far as design or anything else? I will happily take anything. And BTW, I'm only 17, and this will be my first ever long board build. Thank you!
