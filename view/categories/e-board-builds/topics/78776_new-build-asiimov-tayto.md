Bought a spud on sale. Tayto comes in the market. Feels bad man and finally start the build now that I finally have the Tayto. The theme of this build will be CSGO Assiimov color scheme: black, white and orange.

Part list:
* BKB Tayto
* FocBox Unity
* Swappable cell holders cased battery 12s3p
* Bestech D140
* Custom enclosure
* Dickyho mounts + China clone trucks + 1/8" riser (why? Cuss I bought them a long time ago for the Spud)
* Dual Flipsky 6364 (rip noob me, same stator size as 6355, will reglue the magnet myself.)
* 16/36 ABS printed wheel pulley 
* Evolve 83mm wheels (I know they Chuck, also bought them a while ago.)

Battery pack curves to somewhat match the concave.

Do you know where I can get one for cheap? I know these mounts are the early ones so they will snap if I don't reinforce them against vibration.

a local hardware store. just use either threaded rod or tap a thread into an aluminium rod cut to the appropriate size

I love the Assiimov skin from counter strike. I used to play a lot but haven’t in a long time. Pretty much since they rebuilt the dust 2, that killed me tbh

Cool looking build tho

I liked 1.6 a lot more. Never really got into playing CSGO but I watch a lot. Used to play this East Asia version of CS 1.6 called Counter Strikes Online (CSO) it gradually added a lot of game modes (3 versions of zombie, raiding and even soccer for the world club) and character and guns. It was totally a money sink cus you have to either play a lot to rent the guns or you can pay to buy them permanently for a limited time. Eventually they bought into the loot boxes system FML EA.

I think I'll go with the rod. Don't think I can easily get anything metric here in freedom country. Definitely have to order online. I'll check McMaster rn.

Lol. They closed down. A while ago. What I missed the most was the small hop in 1.6 and the out of bound parkour and the ceiling boost.

Still have it no point of selling. You can still get one from BKB.
