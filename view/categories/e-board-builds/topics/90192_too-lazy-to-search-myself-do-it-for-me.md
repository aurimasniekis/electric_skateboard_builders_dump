Hi

I have recently (over the last couple of months) been trying to build a board however I have noticed that there is no set page for people to upload there build some and the pieces which their builds consist of for beginners ,like me, to earn inspiration from and start understanding how these boards are created and parts which are all compatible with each other.

When I started my first build I must have wasted at least £150 on useless parts which I was unable to sell on the forum.

So the point of this page is that EXPERIENCED BUILDERS UPLOAD THEIR BUILDS AND PARTS FOR BEGINNERS.

Please help and support this topic and if anyone wants to they can start a better topic then this as I am not great at it.

PLEASE SUPPORT THIS AND HELP US BEGINNERS who are trying to fall in love with the boards but don’t want to go bankrupt in the process.

I think the way this should be done is by uploading some PICTURES,SPECS(OF BOARD),PARTS LIST AND SOME LINKS.

THANK YOU

PLEASE ONLY PARTS LISTS, BUILDS, OR PICTURES, PM ME FOR ANY PROBLEMS

I don’t mind I just think nobodies should have a place to start with

If you can write an honest build log with price specs and everything why not

I'm not mocking lol I literally gave the best advice I could

Read a bit more and then you can look at a board and know what's in there.

Not that many different parts in esk8.

I don't think that's many people if I'm honest

Many people look at a dream board and just try and emulate it

That's why we see so many evos. That's why Surfrodz are getting used more

Busy with baby. 
I don't really get this thread. 
Options on what gear to use is extremely subjective.  Only a few thing that are "do not use those" and even those items seem to have supporters. 
Most the money i waisted was not sticking with original plan and using a few parts that hadn't been combined at the time.

I dont feel about it.  As far as I know we only delete comments that are inflammatory to the community as a whole, are dangerous because they contain improper methods or are trolling vendors.

If one of the veteran Builders put together this thread with a bunch of examples of different types of boards they have built over the years that would be great. BUT... this is just "i don't wanna surch hand me information "
And again... parts list are extremely subjective. 
What if dude 1 post his parts list. He posts parts myself or other members wouldn't use. Are we gonna sit in this thread and  debate about parts? 
Dozens of ways to build a esk8 for dozens of kinds of people and uses.
It's not hard to browse the site and read builds from other members. (It's actually fun) and maybe you'll learn something. 
Maybe try reddit

The lot of people here have put in their due dilegence and searched for their knowledge and answers. Keep up with the class or fail.

Research......
Something that adults do before spending money.

If you want to do a thread like this, the right way to do it would be to do the research yourself and you compile the list.
You're asking for others to do it for you when the information is right in front of you.

Omg, I just read through all of this and it seems like the comments that add no value were deleted (majority of OPs posts)

This is what the search feature is for. There are tons of lists of trusted vendors.

This ain’t no Best Buy where you can just say “me need computer to go fast for porn”

It’s a diy (do it YOURSELF) forum, doing things such as searching, researching, and starting value added conversations about the industry. There’s no road map to the perfect build but that’s been said already.

I get what you want out of this but you will be hard pressed to have builders post everything they’ve already posted in their build threads a second or even third time.

What I suggest is dig through a few build threads, generate some interest of each of the components, then search about the performance and issues with those components. You’ll learn a lot more that way rather than have it spoon fed

This is a really redundant thread.

This is a website that helps people build electric skateboards, there's loads of information and a search feature so that new people can learn and build. If you don't do the research and understand what you're building your losses will be significantly more, even with a "buy list".

You wasted £150 (which is a drop in the ocean in esk8 by the way) because you didn't search or take advice. Instead of learning from that mistake you've chosen to go down the even lazier route of a buy list.

Whats next? Build list - buy list - everything packaged into a neat little box ready to buy - everything pre-built for you by someone experienced - oh, you might as well just buy an evolve board.
