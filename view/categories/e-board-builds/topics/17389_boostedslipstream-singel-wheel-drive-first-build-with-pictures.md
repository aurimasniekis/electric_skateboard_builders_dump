x2 7S? I'm assuming that you would put it in parallel... interesting choice but whatever works for you.

Either that or just one separate extra battery. I just saw the good price, dont have any idea of whats good or bad really. You have any suggestion?

I would say that you should do 6s system. Buy 2x6s 5000mah and wire them in parralel. And don't buy quanum. Gtb2 is the best. 

Search "commonly used parts" and tou see what people normally uses.
