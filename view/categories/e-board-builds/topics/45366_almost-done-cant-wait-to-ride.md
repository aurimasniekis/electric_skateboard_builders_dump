Here is the progress I've made so far. I'm dying for the weather to clear up and the charger to finally get here - meanwhile, I'll finish up the last details. I want to go for waterproof, but I don't want to experiment before I get some dry miles in first.

The battery meter is wired to the main positive of the battery and to the negitive out from the switch, so it only powers when turned on.

I used PETG for the battery covers and it was done in two pieces held together with epoxy. I used  black PET for the VESC covers and was really happy with how it turned out and may print the battery cover in that as well.
