# Has anyone found a deck similar shape to the Loaded Vanguard, but stiff?

Just a simple question, I really like the Vanguard deck from Loaded, but unfortunately it's, A: super expensive ($400+ after shipping and conversions) and B: Has too much flex, meaning I'd have to do a split housing, which I don't really want to do, but I'm not closed to that idea. So, ideally just the shape of the Vanguard and a stiff deck, is what I'm looking for.

Wow perfect! Have you bought this? It doesn't really give much info about its flex and other details.

I'm on mobile so I could be wrong.

These are made to order, so you could probably ask them to use just 100% rock hard maple and get a stiff deck.

wow for $25 thats cheep!

I'm gonna get one while I'm in the US next week and skin it with carbon to make it super stiff.

Yeah, $25 is cheap, I did contact them to ask about making it hard maple wood, so it doesn't flex, so hopefully it doesn't get much more expensive. Hopefully though, the conversion rates and shipping don't kill my budget haha.

@Airmacx Where are you? Im going to Canada and NYC next week so if your around Europe I could pick you one up and ship it from the UK. US ground shipping was like $23 I think but i don't think they ship to Europe. It wasn't on the shipping options.

The vanguard has rocker shape, i don't think a stiff rocker would be nice..
damn nothing is cheap here in europe -.- if it's cheap somewhere else you can't order lol...

Eh.. they are ok.. I like my arbor axis though minus the grip tape that falls off and doesn't last.. The flex is nice on that deck. 

The $25 Deck is not a bad deck though.. .Your typical maple rigid deck..

Yeah but I'd prefer less flex or none since I'm having an enclosure on the bottom and wouldn't want my battery pack and such to break if it flexes.

I bought a deck from this company. They were great to work with. It was about $15 shipping to me (from their location in California to me in Utah) and about a 2 week turn around time (since they make each one custom)

I got a slightly different shape (I bought the Punisher). It's definitely a stiffer board, much more so than the Loaded Vanguard.

I've been riding my 12S3P flat pack and the flex is fine on the Arbor Axis I'm about 190lbs.

The $25 one has no flex. It's a 7 or 8 ply maple deck so it's rigid/sturdy no flex.

Not sure if this happened to you, but when checking out, it doesn't let me check a shipping option?

Damn all international orders are 70 USD, almost triple the cost of the actual deck. Totalling 95 USD, but for me around $130 after conversions.

So just in case anyone else was looking at the decks I recommended, they are more flexy than I thought...just thought. I just posted this in my build thread:

[quote="rpn314, post:18, topic:4586, full:true"]
So I finally physically got on my deck and rode around(since I finally got my mounting hardware), and found that it was way more flexy that I thought it was before (especially given that it's a 7-8 ply maple deck)....so I guess I'm doing a split enclosure. In case anyone wanted to see how flexy the decks from CustomSkateboards are, you can see a quick gif here:

Yeah I asked them a few weeks ago, and I thought it was just a little flexy. Anyways I'm gonna make my own. I already made my own deck in a custom shape, and the wood is super stiff, and looks great after I apply finish to it. I am looking for slightly better wood but I'll post some pics tonight, and show people. And I'll make a Vanguard shape too maybe this week and if anyone's interested I can probably start making them for people. Only thing is, it's a completely or mostly flat deck bottom and top.

Just delivering some pics of my custom deck I mentioned yesterday, here are some pics, the shape, process kinda, and the thickness, unfortunately I didn't have access to veneer or individual plies of wood so I couldn't press the wood to make a concave, but I still like  the deck, gonna make another with concave later on, but for now, a flat board is all I have, still looks nice imo. Here are the pics:

This deck has pretty much no flex, I can make a flexy deck, but chose to go stiff. It does flex, a tiny tiny bit, but only if you full on jump on the deck.

I'd be happy to make decks for anyone who asks, recently picked it up, and found it pretty fun, so would be happy to do it for others as well.

Hey Rob - great gif man.  I do like the flex of my vanguard 42 (flex 1 for my weight).  Not too much and i separate my batteries (front) and electronics (back).  GF has basically permanently borrowed that board as hers.  

For $25 that seems like a great candidate.  Especially for a lighter rider.  Have you thought about adding CF or FG/GF to stiffen it further?  This is something i'm getting more and more into - both for the added rigidity, being able to run cables on top to keep the bottom clean, and the aesthetics of it (CF is sexy).  I did learn a valuable lesson recently (ie - last night) when i decided i'd see if i could remove my GF on an old project deck...  Since i didn't use epoxy - used something else for surfing... blanking on it, but it stunk soooo bad! - anyway - came off with minimal effort.  That sucks.  So i'm going to re-do it w/ epoxy next (after re-sanding/prepping).

Off to read your build thread on the new board.  Where in UT are you?  I lived there for 5 years in Ogden, w/ family in Pleasant View still.  beautiful mountains, snow, and desert!

Thanks! I just took a quick slow-mo video on my phone and exported it as a gif so I could upload it here. Yeah, I'd originally considered getting a vanguard 38 or 42, but considering that I wanted to paint it and didn't want to spend the money, I decided that a blank deck was better for what I wanted, and I think it's worked out well for me.

I can't say I've thought about adding anything with fiber (carbon or otherwise). I'm just working on dropping a few pounds :) 

I'm just down in Provo studying at BYU, but I'm from NJ

If you have time and ability fiberglass/glassfiber or CF would likely really stiffen it up - and give it more pop to the flex (more energy return).  That looks a bit too flexy for my tastes (even separating batteries and electronics).  

Since riding is energetic, and just standing on it -  if you had any narrower stance it looks like you could easily bottom out the board.  So while riding and carving you should be able to load the board more - meaning it will flex more than just stepping on it.  Any rock/bump/etc would then likely hit/bottom out.

if you haven't already - check out OKP's build threads on his loaded.  He does some amazing GF/CF additions and shows what is possible.  I don't think he posts here, but [here's his (lengthy) build thread on ES](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=71511&hilit=vanguard+okp).

Provo is nice - love the desert south of there!  Arches, Monument Valley, Moab, etc.  Beautiful part of the country.

Monument valley one of my last trips home.  Took a couple days to go down into the desert and do some photography.  Loved the solitude and milky way at night!
