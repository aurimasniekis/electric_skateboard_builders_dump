Holy smokes! Let us know how those motors are.
I'm curious about the ESC (which I don't know much about): it says it supports 2-3S batteries, but is there some tweaking that can be done to use 6S+?

The DIY Kit motors works well. This is the same kit I used for my wife's e-board. Now these are for the kids. But true these are for Christmas. Lol. Never used these ESC's before. At was wondering how well they work. If they work well. Will use them on future builds. If not, I'll just change them out and use better ones.
