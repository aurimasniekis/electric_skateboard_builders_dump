I have upgraded my (functional) -setup (from @torqueboards)  (wheels, trucks, motor-mount etc) with new pairs of SixShooters from @psychotiller . I had a test ride yesterday and experienced problems with belt skipping. I wouldn¬¥t say it¬¥s because of the belt being too loose... I think it have to do with misalignment between the pulleys. But the design of my current trucks makes it hard to adjust.

So all you people that owns a pair of SixShooters, what are your sucess story when it comes to the mechanical setup (trucks, motor-mount, clamp)![Trucks4SixShooter|368x500](upload://xHXg5iMADN2RmOt78NAHPvQhBWZ.jpg)?

Put the clamping ring on the other side of the mount to align the belt

Unfortunately, there is no room there! The connection between the hangar and vertical part of the truck has a radius that makes it impossible without removing material.![ClampRing|500x317](upload://zMzilWSvzuSeWbqmnGKCAPKKR6K.jpg)

add a few speedrings to the wheel.

Speedrings will only push the wheel further out. Those trucks need to be changed or modified

i meant add a few speedrings, then flip the clamp. should‚Äôve been more clear

You've got the motor mount out together all wrong.  You will need to disassembled, move the clamp to the inside about 6mm +/-, install the motor arm in the outside then true it all up. 

@banjaxxed has it right.  All you've got right now is a recipe for no possible alignment and creating bad bearings in the motor.

It looks to me like that motor mount is bent.

I‚Äôve tried having the mount on the other side of the clamp (and the clamp closer to the center of the truck). But then I experienced that the motor pulley was actually touching the rubber of the tire... not so good. Thats why I tried this layout.

But I will disassembly and put it togheter as you suggest. Maybe adding some spacers would help.

Of the motor.pullet is touching the tire, then either move the the entire.motor mount to the inside if the truck some.more or trim the motor shaft.

Just take a file and remove some material from
The hanger. Almost all my calibers have the same modification

If you made the move to my surfrodz trucks/tkp mounts you would never look back. (at the dumpster you threw your current trucks and mount in) No flex,No slop, No BS

I thought that was due to the mount...no? The trucks are causing misalignment?

@SvantePanter Are those 180mm or 218mm Trucks? They look like 180mm. You'll probably have better luck with Surfrod TKP (you'll need psychotiller's mounts) or our 218mm Trucks.

Okay so now I have filed down some aluminium at the truck a bit, rearranged the clamp and mount as suggested. I'm pretty sure the belt is nicely aligned now. Also, the tension on the belt feels good, as far as my limited knowledge goes.
Although, still the same problem with belt skipping as before! Maybe a wider (15 mm) belt and motor pulley would help? Or maybe an idler pulley? But reading through the forum tells me an idler pulley is maybe not the best. https://youtu.be/yoCT1bIQMgk

@psychotiller have you had problems with belt skipping in your past builds? What¬¥s your recipe for an ideal SixShooter drive train? I'm guessing Surf Rodz. :) Although I feel that this is a pulley/belt issue, not so much a truck issue.

i‚Äôd guess the belt and motor pulley are a different pitch than the wheel pulley.

Hm okay... the belt is **345-5m-12 belt for 16/60 gearing**, and the motor pulley is **13T HTD5 12mm Motor Pulley**. Would it make any difference if I would go for a 16T motor pulley instead...?

You can't blame it on any one thing...If you have cloned trucks that are inconsistent in size (they always are) you cant have a mount that fits right. and that said Torques mount doesn't fit well anyway. It has been known since caliber stopped making caliber 1 trucks (over 2 years ago) that the fit between that truck and any mount from anyone has been a shit fit. That's why a few of us stopped using caliber and caliber clone trucks.

Start thinking about your set up as a system. If you have weak links, you'll have a weak system. 

and to further answer your question. No. I haven't had belt skipping issues at all since I stopped making mounts for caliber trucks. All of my mounts and compatible trucks set up inherently straight and square. We have mounts for Seismic, Randal, Buck, Surfrodz RKP and TKP trucks, Paris, Liquid Fyre Precision and Attack trucks. The choices are there. Caliber 2 trucks suck. Clones of those are even worse.

So my only options now if I want to ride the board without belt skipping is replacing the weak parts (trucks, clamp, and motor mount) with either Seismic, Randal, Buck, Surfrodz RKP and TKP trucks, Paris, Liquid Fyre Precision or Attack trucks?

Maybe in the future, but as for now, I will go back to the previous setup and put the SixShooters on the shelf for a while.
Even if you claim the quality is not sufficient I can still ride the previous setup without belt skipping.

I just have the old standard Enertion style clamp and carbon mounts, 2 sets, one on genuine calibers and one TB wide trucks and haven't had any issues with them, maybe I'm lucky
