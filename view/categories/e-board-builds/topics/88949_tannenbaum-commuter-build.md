My commuter build is finally done. After many months and LOTS of help from Dave (a.k.a. Psychotiller) 

_**â€¢Hummie deck**_
_**â€¢Dual Maytech 6880's**_
_**â€¢dual Maytech 100amp VESC's in a Dual diagonal set up**_
_**â€¢Custom 10s5p Psychotiller battery**_
**_â€¢Surfrodz RKP's (stolen from Psychotiller's stashðŸ¤«)_** 
**_â€¢Quick 66 mounts_**
_**â€¢Custom cut 16t pulleys (bored 8mm to 10mm) **_
_**â€¢Custom 2 tone 6 shooters**_
_**â€¢Custom dual hump Psychotiller enclosure**_
_**â€¢Hoyt Skate Puck remote**_
_**â€¢Dual Shredlight's front and rear**_
_**â€¢Akhlut X Things for Hummie deck**_

I went Dual Diagonal for balance when carrying the board, I ride trains and buses every day on my commute and DD was the best way to make the board caryable. The battery was built with 2 discharge leads by Dave so I can run a VESC in the front and rear of the board to keep motor and VESC wire runs as short as possible and keep the whole balance thing consistent. ![IMG_20190303_184829|666x500](upload://fwpLp4yMkHGDXgA3lG1ZsvzEEeT.jpeg)  
     I first ran 97mm ABEC's but due to the motor can size it didn't allow me to tuck them up close enough to keep them from hitting every off camber section of road as I ride therefore adding lots of character to my motor cans and mounts before I mounted the 6 shooters. A set of 107's may allow me to run urethane's but for now I'm enjoying the smooth ride of the 6 shooters.

Love it!  

Dual diagonal also helps in rain and snow because if your drive wheels loose traction from hard braking, you still have one wheel on each truck doing the steering.
