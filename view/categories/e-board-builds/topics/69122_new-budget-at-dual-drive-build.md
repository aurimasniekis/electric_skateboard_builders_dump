Personally I love it.. It is a little wide on turns because it is a 41in board but I plan to put some foot binding that way turns are a lot easier (jump turn lol)

it looks to be a very clean build. mad props to that. if only you can hide the electronics under the board for the stealthy look.

yes you are definately correct. I got the entire kit from johnny_261 for a steal($180), but I did have to drill my own mounting holes because they didn't fit the sk3
