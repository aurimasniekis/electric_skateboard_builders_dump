Hello everyone!

After stumbling on this forum and endless-sphere.com, I have been lurking around for a month or so. I told myself I didn't have need for an electric skateboard and I don't have cash to spare. Yet I know myself well enough and after the finishing of a prusa i3, my hands were itching.
So I continued to subconsciously research on the subject and am finally pulling the trigger. Sorry wallet!

The goal is as follows: To build an electric skateboard that is able to push me up some **hilly terrain**, with a **range that would surprise me** and take my mind of keeping it charged. Also I want a speed that doesn't kill me but gives me the creeps. As I'm not that proficient on a longboard, I think **30+kmph** will be adequate.

**_Here's the caveat_**: I live in the EU, and everything is more expensive here, especially niche products that are flown over from outside the EU. I don't have that much money to spend on this and I'd like to keep the price down on things that won't hurt the quality of this build too much, or that are a good trade-off.

This is the first checklist I have, I can use some help to complete it and adjust it if necessary. But if someone knows cheaper places to buy from in EU, do tell!

### _BASICS_:

1.    [Blank Deck](http://www.hellray.de/shop#!/Blank-Deck-Natural-36-x9-25-LxB/p/62013136/category=15255003) from esk8.de: **€80**
2.    [Caliber II Trucks](http://www.hellray.de/shop#!/Caliber-II-50°-184mm-Achse-in-Schwarz/p/56979275/category=15255003) from esk8.de: has 50° angle (Belgium has short and bendy roads): **€30**
3.    [Orangatang Kegels](http://www.hellray.de/shop#!/Orangatang-Kegel-Wheels-80mm-80a-red/p/56452003/category=15255003) from esk8.de: 80mm, and I've seen they've been used regularly: **€70**

These were cheaper to buy from esk8 than any shop that had both orangatang and caliber trucks. Looks like great store.
Now follow the things that require some personal preference and for which feedback is welcome:

### _DRIVE TRAIN_:

as I said I need something to nimbly pull me along some hilly terrain as good as possible. so I've opted for a **14/32 gear ratio, what's your feedback on this?**

1. [SK3 6374 149kV](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__36656__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6374_149kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor_EU_Warehouse_.html) from HobbyKing EU: Best motor with best torque as far as I have come across, this should work: **€80**
2. [265mm Belt](http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/eSkateboard-Zahnriemen-265mm/p/56161748/category=15255001) from esk8.de: But I can't tell if it's 15mm or not as I'd like to use 15mm gearing and belt:  **€9**
3. [32T Wheel Pulley](http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/eSkateboard-Pulley-für-Orangatang-Kegel-Wheels-32T-für-15mm-Zahnriemen/p/64388594/category=15255001) from esk8.de: Seems like these have been made for the orangatangs, perfect!, but I strongly **prefer a cheaper alternative**: **€60!**
4. 14T Motor  Pulley: **Don't know where to buy this, to fit the motor I chose**
5. Motor Mount: **Don't know where to buy a good one. Otherwise I make one**

###_ELECTRONICS_:

1. [XT90-S](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__91006__XT90_S_Anti_Spark_Connector_2pairs_bag_EU_Warehouse_.html) from HobbyKing EU: I'd like to use this as a switch. I also am not sure if these are the correct ones: **€5.5**
2. [Turnigy 6S 30C 5000mAh x 2](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__35902__Turnigy_5000mAh_6S_30C_Lipo_Pack_EU_Warehouse_.html) from HobbyKing EU: 12S seems good for this motor and the combined 10000mAh should be **adequate for range?**:**€54x2**
**--> WILL BE REPLACED BY 3*4S 10000mAh 10C MULTISTAR BATTERIES!!**
3. [HXT 4mm Connectors](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idproduct=30921) from HobbyKing EU: For the motors and VESC, but I'm not sure if they'll fit: **€4.5**
4. [Some 14AWG cable](http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/eSkateboard-14AWG-Silikon-Kabel-2-08mm^2-1m/p/56676558/category=15255004) from esk8.de: Just in case I'd like to move the batteries around: **€3.5**
5. VESC from esk8.de: This ones a biggy in the wallet, but seems like esk8 is the only one that sells them: **€170**

#### TOTAL THUS FAR: €620

After a quick calculation on toby616' blog, I got following info: a weighted top speed of 30.5kph.

Did I forget something (besides the remote)? Are there any suggestions on where to buy cheaply in Europe? Any suggestions to change things?

Thanks in advance everyone and sorry for the x'th checklist. I just have to get everything right from the start for my budget. But I promise I'll spoil everyone with a nice buildlog afterwards.

Dries

EDIT: some nice pictures so far

Does that 3D printed wheel pulley require truck hanger modifications for the 15mm width?

Will it work on Paris? Caliber etc?

Thanks everyone,

Joop, those are some good finds, I think I'll pull the trigger on some of those soon!

But a final question: what do you think about the battery and transmission ratio? Do you guys think this will work for some hilly terain and some decent range?

Can't wait to start ordering

I'm not sure exactly what your question is, but you can swap out the 3D printed 9 and 15mm pulley without moving the mount.  Use whatever motor pulley and belt you want to use.  The silver trucks I purchased from DIY skateboard already welded on.  The black trucks I just purchased the mount from DIY and got a friend to weld it on for me.   Here's a picture of my 9 and 15mm pulley swapped.

Your budget might be more depending on shipping cost as well as import tax. So try as good as possible buy within eu with as minimum shipping as possible.

If this is first build consider buying some spares of things if possible incase you screwed up.

I am also living in NL! Good luck.

It should work fine, but the top speed might be too slow once you get used to it.

If you connect the two 6S 5000mah lipo's in parallel (6S with 14/32 gearing), maximum speed is 25.7 KPH.  The batteries will be 252 watt hours and should last up to 24 kilometers.  

Maybe get a 16 tooth pulley on the motor so the max speed will be 29KPH?

@laurnts: Jep that's what I'm planning on doing. the VESC, trucks, wheels, mount will all come from esk8.de They were very fast in replying and certainly seem to know what they're doing.
The batteries come from hobbyking EU.

@joop1987: I was planning on putting the 6S in series to get the extra voltage and thus less current through the motor (seemed practical when going up and down some terrain)
I expected a bit more range.

I laseo have to option for 3x 4S 10C multistar 10000mAh that I might put in series. Do you think they'll fit under a 36" board?

Higher voltages are more efficient.
If you're running a VESC, put them in series and your top speed will double, your heat losses will drop and you still have more or less the same range, unless you ride FULL speed ALL the time.
You can limit the top speed in the VESC if you need to.

[/quote]

They are 65 x 160mm Just cutout 3 pieces of paper 160 x 65 mm and put them next to each other with say 5mm spacing to get a feel for how big they are. My gut feeling says they'll fit fine. Thickness is only 36mm which is nice.
Those 6S Turnigy's are 50mm thick, which is quite a lot IMO, even for a top-mounted deck.

Just make sure you choose the correct gearing for max speed.  WIth 12S, 14/32 gearing, and 83mm wheels, you are looking at 51KPH.  I fell off my skateboard at 25KPH and I scraped every hand, elbow, and knee.

I am using two 4S 10AH in series and they fit fine.

This board with 4S, 16/40, and 83mm wheels tops out at 40KPH. (Still a little too fast for me).

Well thats too bad. This is a very good things for others to know that 50km/h is not so fast on a bike but ridiculously fast on an eboard for normal people. On collision and or falling down the injury is quite fatal without protection. Theres no reason for new people to aim at 50km/h. When 25km/h is comfortable and boring, change gearing to 30 then 40 then 50. Thats the better start.

@joop1987: Jep but with the 149kV motor, the calculator gave me 30kph, I'm sure that's plenty fast for me for a while. I'm might indeed get the 16T afterwards if I get bored.

I just don't want to make the motor work to hard (use too much current --> heat) by using 12S, because of the hills.

Hello everyone, 

little update: The VESC, board, trucks, wheels, bearings, motormount and belt have all been ordered from esk8.de and should arrive next week.

In the meantime I have been working on a wiring diagram, care for some feedback?
Charging the 3*4S 10000mAh 10C multistars seems difficult and I don't want to hookup anythin wrong. So I had the idea for using the ON/OFF loopkey (XT90S antispark) for charging as well. That way I'm obligated to unplug it and plug it into the battery that needs charging.

Improvements or better ideas are certainly welcome

Hi 3sly, thanks for posting this diagram. I am about to start my build and wanted to understand a bit better how the charging works for this setup. Can you please explain how to connect the charger to this? I assume also you need to connect all the balancing plugs?

One note, Assuming black is ground (in some places it's not), I'd connect the anti-spark/switch to the live part of the circuit so that the VESC is not energized.

thanks
```

hey mcfly, thanks! It's an idea, I'm not yet sure if it's the correct method.
The idea is that when you want to charge the batteries you do as follow: you turn off the board by unplugging the loopkey as in the diagram, then you plu it into the battery u wish to charge. the balance leads of the same battery are right next to it so you can't miss it. If battery1 is charged, unplug the loopkey and balance leads and plug it in battery2 etc. That way the charger XT90 cable can remain plugged into the same charger plug.

I didn realise that it would be a problem (about energising the VESC). A voltage is just a reference no? or is the VESC grounded through the motor?
```

Thanks for your answer. I will read up more on this. One issue I have is the having to open everything, connect/disconnect several cables to recharge. Would be nice to have a port connected to an enclosure and that be it for charging.

As for your question where to put the switch, read this article it explains it well why you'd want to interrupt the circuit in the live wire and not in the ground one.

```
I just read through it. Good point, and must be taken into consideration. But I don't think it's completely correct. In a lightswitch u use AC which has a voltage relative to ground. In a battery the voltage is relative to the other battery terminal, so it doesn't really apply here.

I do however not know if the VESC is grounded in another way then relative to the negative side of the battery. So I don't think this applies to the VESC so please correct me if I'm wrong.

i too would like one plug: this is possible if you use parallell batteries and are willing to use a serial port (i've seen this pop up on the forum but can't remember where).
For series batteries I don't really see a choice without using a BMS, but those are bloody expensive for 12s.

@3sly   Everything in the circuit is referenced from a common ground. So the ground for the VESC is the same as the ground for the Rx and the motors.

Having said that, the ground for the circuit is not connected to earth's ground in this case. I read a few areas saying it doesn't matter, and some where it does. I think best practice is to put the switch on the hot wire. At least one person from the industry says that here

UPDATE: I've received following componentes today: VESC, drivetrain, board, trucks, wheels and bearings.
I'm exceptionally impressed by the quality and thought that went into the esk8 products, the caliber trucks were modified and they even bothered to paint it again! I especially like the aluminium pulley, the fit on the orangatang wheels is impressive, they even have settings for screws, so the screws don't tap into the aluminium.

Normally tomorrow I'd be meeting with @trbt555 for the batteries and enertion remote.
I've also seen that the motor will be shipped soon, so this build is going faster than expected.

These are the pictures as promised

I have a quick question for everyone: Does the length of the cables from/between the batteries have an impact on something? Ofcourse theoretically the batteries will be at a different voltage if a resistance is between them and a current flows through it, but can't that be neglected unless you have several orders of magnitude lengthier wire.

I'm asking because I might place the batteries in length along the roll axis of the board.

Just make sure that the cable length between batteries and the VESC is not too long. Else you might need to add capacitors in front of the VESC to avoid difficulties.

@shred, I'll read up on that! Right now everything is going into high gear. Everything arrived.

I went to meet trbt555, to go buy the 3*4S 10000mAh batteries and the enertion steez remote from him. It was nice meeting him, a friendly and down-to-earth guy who gladly shared some advice regarding DIY esk8s with me. 

While I was expressing my worries with him regarding my backorder on HK of the 149kV, the shipping gods must have heard me and not even 30 minutes later the motor, XT90s and cables arrived.

When I find the time I'll read up on the cable length, but I don't think it'll be an issue. I'm thinking of placing them behind each other as in the picture, but then I'd have to probably use fiber glass for the enclosure as finding ABS to vacuum form the entire length is gonna be quite difficult. Other tips are welcome. (Yes I know the board is upside down :p just for reference (board is 36"/96cm). I'll also be using risers)
They're very big, its gonna be a tough fit :p but doesn't matter, we'll make it work.

OK, update: I managed to config the VESC succefully, I have full control and managed not to blow up the DRV chips or screw up the firmware.

I do have a question though: I used a single 4S lipo for the setup and motor detection. But as I'm going to use 12s, I set the battery cutoff start at 42V (3.5V) and the battery cutoff end at 38.4 (3.2V). This gave me the thought that as soon as I write the config, I won't be able to drive it with the 4S connected battery, as the voltage is lower then the end cutoff.

This isn't the case though, I can still run the motor with the remote and with these settings. How can the VESC know that I only have 4s installed, or where did I go wrong.

Sure, but i don't have access to it now. All the other settings are default though, I only changed to battery cutoff start to 42V, cutoff end to 38.4V. max voltage is default (57) and min voltage is default (8V). The battery and motor currents are also default. After that I only detected the motor and set the PPM enertion remote.

Hi @3sly, it was nice meeting you, a pity I didn't have more time to chat. Maybe we can ride together when your board is finished. 

Personally I'd stay away from fiberglass and epoxy. It gets really messy really fast. And it isn't all that cheap either.
I think thermo-forming an enclosure will give you better results.
Just search ebay.be for "ABS sheet" and you'll find plenty of matrerial, mostly in the UK so without taxes to BE.

Made that experience today - absolutely correct! It's a mess and not drying anymore, made some boxes last year without problems, but now... 

@3sly don't worry, that corridor for cut off start/end is disregarded if your voltage is lower than that, since it only serves as limit for cut off. It will work with your 12s nevertheless. in the expected way. But don't use FOC on your setup please, it's safer on BLDC for now.

Hey all!

Big update. The board is as good as finished. I've made a temporary metal housing out of an old metal gutter. Lot's of elbow grease, but I'm happy with the result. In the long run I plan on vacuumforming an ABS housing, just like @trbt555 suggested. The downside though is that I need plates larger then A4 for adequate room for the batteries, and sheets that are large enough are hard to find and very expensive. I've contacted the Wauwer plastics 5 (a local shop), but I noticed they only have HDPE to vacuumform, which is pretty difficult to work with.

I am very aware about vibrations and metal edges, so everthing is properly insulated with very think insulating tape and even some sealing agent (window sealant) around the edges. The batteries are on standoffs of velcrotape and over half a cm away from any (insulated) edge. There are also no moving parts near the edges that can get cut through due to vibrations and the parts fit snug inside so they don't move around.

Took her for a 3km spin and WOW! This must be the most fun toy I've ever owned. It takes getting used to to stay balanced and at high speed the thing shimmies if you don't relax. But I think that's to blame on the use of the 1/2 (necessary) spacers and the shorter wheelbase. But I'm learning, I notice that when I relax my lower legs, I can keep it under control.

**Small problem though:** Belgian roads are infamous for there lack of quality and my street is a prime example of this. The harsh vibrations make my mount screws come loose, which I noticed because after a while accelerating/decelerationg makes the belt skip, even though I used some 243 loctite. I don't know what to do next, I'm almost tempted to use some 648 that I used for the motor pulley.

**A second question:**  I've heard that the circlip holding the stator in needs to be rotating freely. But as you can see there is not enough room for the shaft. It isn't pinched or anything so when wiggling the shaft forward and back, it moves along. It just doesn't complete an entire rotation and thus doesn't rotate freely. I don't see this as an issue though, but I'd thought I'd ask anyway.

Here are some pics of the 2 housings:

In the meantime I cut the right holes to connect the cable and finished everything up. (I made sure the cables are: inside spiral cablebinder, then taped and then in an electricity tube. It should also be noted that none of the components touch the sides. No chafing of the cables in the passthrough holes can occur)

I'm about 70kg, and I'm pretty sure I easily get over 30km/h. I haven't yet been confident to go full speed, way to fast for me. But 40km/h isn't out of the question. If you're an avid and experienced longboarder, you might hit the top speed, but it's still a speed that is rarely obtained.

Nice thing about this setup is that the speed is the same for both uphill as downhill, and that's a very cool feeling.

With 6s? I'm not sure, you'll might need to tweak here and there to get there.

This will probably be ridden with to and from my studentjob for the next month or so. So I hope it holds up but I have good faith in it. I'm also glad that it's as good as waterproof. I've found some tubing that fit the motor wires nicely and by hotgluing those through the microwave boxes, I'm pretty sure I've got a waterproof seal. Still, I won't be riding this through any puddles or rain whatsoever.

After next month I'm planning on finding some time to make a vacuumtable, so don't go just yet there is more to come ;).

**I do have a problem though: does anyone have a good source for motorpulleys (14T)?** The one I have now is new but is very eccentric, it makes the belt vibrate like crazy and I can even feel the board shaking. It's either that or the axle of the motor has been bent, which would really be a serious problem -_-. But I think it's the pulley.

I haven't ridden it on the streets because of the rain. But hopefully the motormount doesn't shake loose like it did last time, otherwise I'm gonna see if I can find someplace to weld it fixed to the truck.

The only heat loses that drop with higher voltage are in the vesc and possibly in ur battery wires

Going the same speed u were on 6s withy 12s u will have more heat in the motor as th no-load speed, which you want to be as close to as possible for efficiency, is now further away

I have a problem everyone (pff they just don't seem to stop, I've barely ridden the board and everything that can go wrong has gone wrong...)

It seems like one of the cells on my brand f*ing new multistar battery has vanished. (See picture).
How did I notice? Well I just went for my first ride since I put the plastic boxes on (stupid rain finally stopped and everything dried up). From the getgo (!) I already noticed that my board just had only about 1/3 of the speed/punch than it had the first ride (with the metal boxes). When I went downhill a bit, or on flats, the power came back. So I had a feeling the batteries might be drained (strange as they have never been used besides the first testrun).

I get back, and I plugged the batteries into the B6ACv2. 2 of the 3 batteries read 3.8V, plenty of juice I thought odd.
But lo behold the third one (the one stored next to the VESC) had absolute nothing on the 1st cell --> 0V -_-. It's dead. This explained it: 11*3.8 ~=42 (my soft battery voltage cutoff start on the VESC)

**how did this happen? How can this happen between rides because it was fine before the beginning of this ride? How can I avoid it (has it anything to do with my setup (see picture above 14/32 ratio)**

Can I just try and charge it? maybe one of the cells went too low for some reason? dunno, just grasping for some straws here. It feels a bit mushy, but that could be the packaging. Can I remove the cell and use it as a 11S?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

PICS: normal and f'd up battery

If that's the case, then it's definitely a dead cell. I believe it was @trbt555 who said his multistar cells would be way of out balance after each ride. I have the same batteries. I'll see if I have the same experience once I get my board setup in the next few weeks.

Yeah it's from trbt555 that I've bought them new. I'm sure they worked before this ride, because he sold those brand new to me and they worked the previous ride (allthough I didn't measure them then). I thought they'd be fine for the occasional riding that I'd be doing. And as you can see, the other cells are perfectly balanced.

I just for the life of me can't imagine how a cell died without even using the battery?! I'm fine with multistar being a bit less quality and less of a lifespan, but how can a cell die like this.

Two packs already dead.
I haven't checked whether or not it's the inter-cell connections or the cells themselves. I'm not a big fan of Multistars.

When I thought of 'unreliable', I assumed that they'd fail after like 200cycles instead of the normal 500 for LiPo's, but not on cycle 0 -_-. Anyone else with these experiences?

how did you find out @trbt555, also during riding?

Ok I'm back.

I had a Multistar pack,with one dead cell. It was brand new and had been only run once, to replace another pack with also a dead cell.

I found out while riding, when suddenly I hit the low voltage cutoff after only like 2000mAh or so.

I opened it up.
It's not the connections. One of the cells was dead as a doornail. Exactly precisely zero volts.

My conclusion: Multistar = false economy.

Can u get no voltage at all from the bad cell?   It disappeared using a multimeter? Yet it's still in the circuit. For me the cells beside a bad cell get pulled harder or something and they end up at a lower voltage. What were the other packs at?giggle it.

I'm thinking of 2 things that I'd like some input on:

1) I jank out the dead cell and run this thing as 11s. Even with the 149kV, I assume currents would still be quite manageable. That way I can still use the batteries.

2) I buy myself some proper batteries, but which ones should I get? On reviews they say that zippy isn't that great either, but turnigy is. Also, any particular criteria to batteries for esk8?

3) In the long run I'd lik to make a Li-ion pack, but that would be after the summer

4) I still have no clue how this thing died between the very first time they were ever used and the second time a couple weeks later

5) Should I try charging it first? Maybe it overdischarged for some reason

You could also just leave the dead cell in the pack and snip it's balance wire.
That way your charger will think it's a 3S pack and balance it correctly.

EDIT: *wait, hadn't thought that through. You'd need to fit a 3S balance wire for that to work. I have a spare one I could mail you if you like.*

Lower the voltage cutoff in your VESC and you're good to go @11S.
You'll miss 1/12 of your capacity but at least you're rollin'.

I've read (http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/salvaging-a-lipo-pack-removing-the-bad-cell/2428/12) that leaving the cell in is a bad idea. I already noticed that the cells around it are on a little different voltage than 3.8. So I'll be indeed cutting it out and resoldering, which I have a feeling will be quite the fiddling :p. If it works then I might take you up on the offer, but I'll first check if I have one lying round.

And as Murphy's law predicts: I think I've spotted some seeping Lithium (?) from one of the (you've guessed it:) working cells at the sides. I was wondering if this is normal or a big nono. It's small, but it's definitely not glue or tape residue. It looks like calcium on a waterboiler and is located under the insulating foil tab. My hope (for once please be right) is that it's some residue left from packaging these things in the insulating foil.

Next to it is a puffy (but working (3.8V)) cell. The broken one is 2 cells away from the one that leaks, it's at the negative terminal.

Yeah I don't think I'm gonna bother taking out the bad cell. One cell is dead, the other one is the one with the leak and one cell is ever so slightly puffy (probably due to the bad cell).

I'll order a new one and maybe after that order some lipos from a decent brand. If they fail again I'll have to save up to make a li-ion pack. It's a bit frustrating with the setbacks

Hey guys finally got a new battery. Great fun this. Been riding for about 6miles or so, really really great fun. First I had the power cut out though, but quick check of the receiver connection saved that :p.

I do have a bit of a worry though; Again battery issues. getting sick of them to be honest. I got no qualms with troubleshooting things that I've messed up, but I hate problems that come out of the factory. But maybe it's my fault: I hit the soft voltage cutoff, strangely enough because I haven't been riding that much and they were at 3.8V for every cell.

Thing is, when I checked them with the imax, **one battery had all cells at 2.7V(!)**, the other batteries were all nicely at 3.75-8V. No puffiness though. No wonder the voltage cutoff jumped in when one battery was so low. Is this possible, can this happen? Al cells were all balance charged to 3.82V before this ride.

I'm free fridayevening and saturday to possible meet up in Leuven and discuss your build and let you try out a raptor if you want. Let me know what suits you. I just have to swap my second motor to be sure my board is up spec again. And safety ofcourse. But its working atm

Sadly I'm not in leuven until the new academic year starts again. I'm currently in Knokke working. It's funny how many of those hoverboard kids I fly by. Nobody has seen anything like this :p. I've passed 4 officers so far on 4 different occasions. Right now I don't even bother to put my foot down as long as I don't go too fast they don't notice a thing and don't look twice. Love this thing.

But for some reason I don't think the battery is holding its charge as long as I thought it would. Right now I'm at 3.75V after a charge to 4.0V and just  commutes later (1.5km oneway). I'll try and measure it, it could be subjective :p.

Haha, remember their face when you run by. It's again, worth it ! 
Sorry for this word for other people, but you've got a "dijk" fully available for you ! I've been in De Panne last weekend and had a great time showing people how cruZing should be done. Hahaha. Judging by your experience with your self-built board. you should definately look into a BMS and charger to handle your 3 batteries and balance them. Just my 2 cents... Anyways, happy cruzin'

Hey dude @barajabali built me badass set of 6s batteries and was very informative about specifics! I got a great service by purchasing his product, my batteries were worth every penny!
