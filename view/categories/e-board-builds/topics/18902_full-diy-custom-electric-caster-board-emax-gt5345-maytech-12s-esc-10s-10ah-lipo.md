Hi Guys, 
@bill_f 's two wheeler build thread reminded me about vertigo's build I saw while ago on ES forum, and few days earlier I realised I just have ESC, 25H sprockets, motor and good battery cells laying around my shop. I decided to give this idea a try, I ordered Trampa Hypa hubs, as this build was supposed to be "budget" and "use what You have" parts only. I did quick sketch of parts, as Vertigo's build is perfectly documented it wasn't so hard, some dimensions are different, like my deck width is 174mm to accommodate 150mm long lipo cells, thus front linkages are a bit longer too. The deck and integral battery and esc compartment are made out of material known to knife and gun nuts as G10 which is simply glass fiber laminate, top deck is 5mm thick, sidecovers and bottom is 3,5mm black G10 I had laying around my shop. 
And now plot twist, are parts are HAND not CNC made, I cut them rougly to shape using paper templates on my bandsaw, then either milled them to required shape or ground on my knifemaking belt grinder.

(don't worry about the gaps between shoulder bolt heads and bushing, there will be custom, turned out of titanium bushings, I have them ready)

(axles are made out of titanium ;) )

As I don't have 10S battery charger and wanted this board to run on 10S voltage, I decided to split the battery pack into two 5S2P packs, connected via loop key to 10S2P pack when board is powered on.

http://i.imgur.com/MNPO3jK.jpg

 When loop key is taken out it's possible to charge and balance two 5S2P packs separately (I have turnigy reactor quadcore charger, it supports up to 6S).
I made special charging harness, and it uses 12 pin binder 680 series connector for balancing and charging.

Everything inside is packed pretty tight, as this build was planned around components I had.

Now aluminium parts need just some finishing and bead blasting and then I can get them anodized black. 
This should be fun to ride! :D

Great build.  Like how clean you kept the design with your flat lipo battery pack. Well done!

Really curious to see what you think of the ride performance.  Some ride vids please, when you get a chance! :movie_camera:

I just had first test drive, holy fuck this thing is scary :scream: It's like walking the line except you go a little bit faster :D I wouldn't dare to go on this on public road, for me, for now it's too wobbly. I spent first 10 minutes trying to start riding on this thing, it requires a little training. Even now, sitting and writing this my body feels like it's balancing to stand on this thing.

Yeah, it's possible to steer, but like You noticed with too much wilt the screws hit the ground. Scary experience :D

And I already decided there is no point in anodizing those parts, they're gonna get beaten anyway. Only bead blast for them

One more thing, I don't think I'll ever drain the batteries at once :D It's kinda of recreational device, to train ones balance :D

I think that bigger wheels would help a lot, they would generate gyro effect like in bikes for example, converting or building something like dirt surfer would be a better option in my opinion, this will remain a kind of oddity vehicle in my collection :D I'll try to learn how to ride it better tho!

I'm not an engineer, just speculating, but it looks like your caster design is flat. If you look at something like a yiiboard or rip stick you'll see that the caster is located under the axel in a way so at rest it wants to center and straighten the wheel. I feel like with your interesting caster design, if you pitched the mechanism up that would lower the board (may have to adjust for clearence) but it should make the board want to go straight and make it more stable

I was hoping this thing was going to perform a little better. Vertigo never wrote much about performance. Maybe it's like a snowboardâ€”it takes a while to learn, but then it's awesome (hopeful thinking).  In Vertigo's ride vid, it looks pretty rideable. That vid is what convinced me to make it. ('m sure you've seen it. Just posting for others.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcmk1LQXecM

I'm wondering what would happen if the front axle was moved further back. (Would require creating new blocks, plus you will soon run out of room and hit the deck.) I'm guessing it would be more stable but less agile... always a trade-off. Vertigo wrote about building some adjustability into the design. Some way to slide front axle back or change rake angle, etc. would be interesting.  Sounds like you're looking for more stability at this point.

Maybe grind down the struts where they are hitting the ground on turns for more clearance?

Probably not too hard with your skills, to make it into a scooter, if needed.

Keep us posted on your ride progression and post some vids!   I'm still waiting for shoulder bolts from China.

Thanks for the R & D!

Good observation. I believe it has a 15 degree rake (assuming OP went with the same numbers as Vertigo's).  Maybe it could use more? Or maybe the axle could be a little further back, effectively lowering it more.

Yeah I went with the same geometry Vertigo did, I think that it's just a matter of this steering design, angle is 15 degrees in my case too, after all I WAS able to ride it after a few tries. I just scaled it up a little bit to accommodate 24mm wider deck (longer links), that might not helped (but that would be exactly opposite as I thought, I lowered center of gravity and moved front axle a little bit up). I'll take another test ride today, maybe that just was a matter of my stance, with feet perpendicular to long axle of the board, I see vertigo placed front foot more parallel to this axle

If this won't be ridable I was thinking about converting it to something like dirt surfer, with 16" wheels, they would allow to get more clereance, and dirtsurfer seems super stable. 

It would be a shame to waste such beautiful and sleek deck with integrated battery compartment :D

Ok Guys, today I took second test ride and hit that throttle a little bit harder, and this thing became rideable. With speed this vehicle gains stability, it has to do with wheels gyro effect, it's quite interesting to ride at 30-40 km/h. Anyway, video is worth one thousand words :D

I don't know this stuff very well, it's just my random thoughts, But I don't think adding more speed caused it to be more stable because of a gyroscope effect. I don't know much about the gyroscope effect but I thought you need a good deal of mass to be spinning for it to work and these wheels seems small. (bikes have small mass but big wheels so the weight is far from the pivot, motorbikes has heavy wheels) I think it's more path of least resistance. You adding more velocity in a forward direction, made the front wheel want to be pointed forward because there is less resistance.

I guess we'll never know for 100% :D Anyway it's clear it gets more stable at speed. 

I just bead blasted parts, decided to anodize them as I have new motor mounts for my longboard ready as well and company that'll do this for me wouldn't take such small comission. 

This two wheeler is fun to ride it fast on nice road and I intend to use it for pure entertainment :D

Very nice!  I can see as you're riding it that it does not seem very stable. But you are showing it is ridable.  I wonder if it'll get easier to ride with time or if that's as good as it's going to get.  You're also getting what looks like good performance from that single motor.  Well done.
Thanks for posting.

Thanks! I think it's a matter of training and getting used to this board.
 I'll probably try lengthening front wheel mounting block, thus moving front wheel a little bit more back, and then test if this will improve performance or not.

It's definitely an interesting concept that Vertigo showed us all, and something "different" among all of those electric skateboards :D

It's impossible to turn fast and sharp on this thing, rather smooth carving at high speed it's limited by ground clereance. 

I didn't say it's practical commute vehicle ðŸ˜‚ It requires nice straight smooth road where you can hit that throttle and go fast!

Actually bindings sound like a cool idea and might even improve stability, but my only concern is that they would make bailing out more difficult, also starting riding this thing is tricky because I must give myself a push with left foot (I'm goofy) and then placing this foot in a binding, in my opinion would be impossible. Only something like freebord bindings seem reasonable.

Looks really nice anodized.  45 kph sounds pretty scary!  I'm trying to think if there's a way to convert these things to scooters. Something with a fold-down steering bar would be cool. Keep the current caster mechanism to maintain a real low profile once it's all folded up.

Curious about your machining set up.  Noticed your motor mount has lots of curvy parts.

@bill_f  Forgive me the delay in response, I just had to find a moment to look for a photos of my workshop, I'm currently away from it and had to search in my photo library.

So I print paper templates and glue them to the aluminium sheet, then use my bandsaw (in vertical configuration, with table attached) to freehand cut the parts out.

http://i.imgur.com/i9NEZWh.jpg

Then it depends on accuracy I need to have, in this case round parts didn't need to be perfecly round so I just freehand ground them on my belt grinder You can see on the picture below (here it's pictured with the flat platten, but I also have contact wheels and smaller rollers for grinding curves, and it tilts 90 degrees to horisontal config as well), works fine for me :sunglasses:
Then used my mill (yellow machine) to add cutouts, drill and tap holes, etc.

http://i.imgur.com/7Lz2PAm.jpg

Also my lathe is very usefull ;) I turned distance barrels for mounting sprockets and shafts for wheels.

http://i.imgur.com/nh0FqjM.jpg

That's pretty much all I used to make this build happen.

Oh and as for the scooter conversion, I'm thinking about this too, but it would require to make new front steering mechanism, I can't think of any way to convert this board with caster steering front, maybe I'll make some new parts later this year.

Thanks for sharing.  Good stuff.
Didn't realize a metal band saw was a thing, but I guess, why not.  Seems pretty handy.  
I've got a small belt sander and a small Bosch drill press. They work fine but do not give me many fixturing options.  Find that no matter how much I measure, I don't get the accuracy I'm looking for.  
Still thinking of ways to add a steering column to caster board with the current set-up.
Curious to see what you come up with.

@squad did you get more comfortable riding this very unique thing? would love to try that for a few days - slim blade, feet pointed forward behind each other, natural turn without bushings. i wonder if one could tune this kind of board to resemble the race boarding experience ive loved for all my life now.

it would need some camber, sone flex tuned for the speed and carving arcs you want. 

im just not sure yet if i understood the steering 100% ... if i flex a snowboard or a board, the radius is dynamically getting smaller - more pressure is build up, sensation sets in. i cant seem to grasp how that works with this kind of steering setup. :confused: i think any setup that is supposed togive a great feel needs this feeling of pumping energy into the system and returning it in the right moment. and tuning the amount of energy you can put into such a system while riding only works by adaption of the radius. would love to hear your thoughts about if you can think of a way to make that possible?

Hi @whitepony, excuse me delay in response as I was all day in my workshop and didn't have time to reply until now. I got comfortable enought to reach speed limit and do slight carving while going so. Turning radius is huuuuge on this thing, mostly because of ground clearance. This steering mechanism does not give the feel of pressure building up while turning, I would compare it to balancing while walking the line, my feet need to be rock solid all the time, it gets better as You gain speed. I think that what You talking about could be achieved with using something more like dirt surfer, bigger wheels to get gyro effect on your side, long steering arm of dirt surfer looks like it stabilizes itself in the cetral position more easily under riders weight. 

I believe that after more experimenting with geometry one could came up with a really interesting ride experience.

It's spare-scrap parts build so I'm happy with what I achieved, but I wouldn't allow anyone else ride it :D getting first steps is too difficult for average person without esk8 background, too many things to synchronise, pushing yourself to get some speed, then carefully applying throttle while struggling to keep balance. 

I'm really curious what @bill_f experience will be with his board.

UPDATE!!!

I must say I'm kinda changing my way of looking at this vehicle, I'm starting to feel really comfortable riding it. Today I rode 12 km in local park, on bike lines, between some people. It's really maneuverable. I guess I just had to get used to riding my caster board, it's not "scary as fuck" anymore :D Really enjoyable to ride, even on not so perfect asphalt, with cracks etc.

Hi. The board is doing well. Just got some new wheels for it so it doesn't need loaners anymore.  Just like you, the more I ride it, the more I enjoy it. I only have maybe 45 mins. total on it but I can definitely feel like I'm improving on it and it gets more precise. Am able to keep it pretty close to where I need it to be. I am learning to use the accelerator to help with balance, accelerating at the right time to pull out of turns.

I imagine it's like snowboarding or something; takes a little time to get it dialed in.  Like I said before, it's challenging in a good kind of way. I don't find it too difficult or frustrating.  Want to keep riding it and see how I progress on it.  Hopefully will have a video or two soon.

You still riding it?  Anything changed in your design or riding style?
I find that I ride mine anywhere I ride my four wheeler and am pretty comfortable with it.  Haven't changed the geometry or anything. All parts are holding up well. No mechanical or drive train problems to date. Have maybe 100 kms on it.
Now having ridden the four wheeler and two wheeler back to back I can say that the two wheeler feels more stable than the four at high speeds.  If I slow down enough, I can make pretty small radii turns, in some ways sharper than the four wheeler. 
Post another ride vid if you get a chance :grin:

Hi, unfortunately at the beginning of may I had an accident on my caster board, quite severe... I broken ulna and radius as well as scaphoid bone in my wrist. I have 2 plates and 14 screws in my forearm and immobilized forearm till beginning of July, 4 more weeks to go :/ I was riding under bridge with steel structure and tram tracks and suddenly my nano remote lost connection, I tried applying throttle- nothing, then breakes and suddenly connection came back, I was not prepared and board suddenly stopped, I went flying forward and landed on my palm, unfortunately my forearm shortened about 3cm and was crooked at about 15 degrees in the middle. Sooo, I'll probably have to take a break from my caster board, but I miss it anyway I felt totally confident on it before accident, it was unfortunate ending of my 20km long ride...

Oh man! That sucks.  I saw your x-ray photo on the picture only thread and thought it was a battle wound from days past.  Didn't realize it was recent.  Interesting to hear that it was because of the remote and not because of the design.  For what it's worth, i've been riding both my boards with a gt2b and never had a single hiccup.  Haven't modified the tx for fear of having a problem. Just bought a second receiver for the two wheeler for 5 dollars from China (frsky for gt2b). Crazy that I trust my life to this $5 piece of kit but it seems rock solid--just like the one that came with the Tx.  Let's hope  it stays that way. 
Hope you're better soon and back to riding soon after.

Looks really painful. :head_bandage: 
Active tram tracks? I have noticed some strong RF around these. I even had my GT2B drop out near them but it has fail safe set to neutral position so just a temporary loss of power. After this I moved the receivers antenna from under my foot to the middle of the board and never had a drop out since. Do you still trust the nano? Can it have a fail safe, I think that very important safety feature.

Active tram tracks. Nano does have a fail safe feature, the board didn't stop because of drop out, it stopped because connection came back and I had my thumb on brakes, and totally didn't expect that.

The strenght of brakes was just too hard, poor combination of esc settings and short thumb wheel travel in nano.
I obviously don't trust it any more, but I'm worried that lot of 2,4ghz remotes might fail in those conditions.

Ok that's unfortunate and scary. Guys just coast during dropouts till control comes back, no sudden inputs.

This was my way of testing if it came back, short thumb wheel travel combined with esc settings caused that slight brake turned out to be board suddenly dead-stops-brake.

Just curious. How long would you say the dropouts have been on your gt2b?  I haven't noticed any on mine and I ride around electric buses and trams all the time.  Maybe I'm just not noticing short (very) losses of power as it goes into coast mode.  Always keep  my Tx charged up nicely too.

Just intermittent power cut outs around tram tracks. Like 1 second, it's very noticeable if your accelerating. I moved the antenna from under my rear foot to the middle of the board and never had an issue again. I also moved the receiver further away from the motors. I'm not 100% sure it was the antenna position but since moving I have not had any dropouts. Keeping the remote charged up is definitely a must.

In my case this unfortunate dropout lasted for about 2-3 seconds

Maybe time to switch to GT2B? It has a long brake travel. I put a stronger spring in mine so it self centers better but it also makes it difficult to accidentally press all the way down. Also if you use the thumb case like the buffalo that uses the steering pot you have 50/50 movement accel / brake. Which is more brake travel than the trigger styles. 
* Re-connection time after a dropout is like one second. Fast reconnect is important feature for RC models.

So... as this project in eyes of my girlfriend and parents was kinda "doomed" because I had an accident on it, it's time to modify it a bit. I decided to add a foldable handlebars, and wired thumb throttle. I'll be using arduino nano to convert analog joystick type potentiometer output to PWM signal, there'll be no remote dropouts anymore.

Handlebar folds nicely on a press of a button, everything milled and turned on a manual machines, no CNC :)

As You can see I didn't give up on caster steering, decided to leave it as it was, handlebars are to have something to hold on to and avoid being ejected by strong brakes, also I can mount wired throttle on it :)


UPDATE, 1st Sept.

I finished throttle/brake lever, probably one of the most complex parts of this build, it's based on nunchuck joystick (hidden inside handlebar tube), and arduino nano will be connected to its potentiometer to generate PWM signal depending on voltage between its legs..

@Nowind Thanks! I would be willing to make more of them if it didn't take like half day to make one (and the other half handfitting) :D You know, my CNC is in my hands 


Ok, so I finished this, it's not perfect (still steers like casterboard so until used to it it's sketchy), but handlebars allow to brake hard and not get thrown off the board.  ESC flashed with the newest FVT firmware performs good in sensored mode. Can't add more as I'm still sort of non thrusty about whole concept of riding this.

Can you send me the front steering mechanism or tell me where to buy one. How much for a board please

sick creation
I was going to comment it looks like a scooter with its handlebar chopped off.
And then you added a handle at the end! 
But a troll scooter because the handle doesnt actually steer the front wheel XD

Great thread, and really great build!  I'm just now pulling the parts together to build a very similar machine.

Years ago I built a cheesy rip-off of the Rip-Stick (which I call the Dip-Stick)...  Then I more recently built this off-road electric mountain-board...

![Board%202|574x500](upload://zKkxI1WuXllhIuNs89bsf4R67qR.jpeg) 

I've been having a blast with it.  But now I've decided I need to build a 2-wheeled electric board, and I'm finding videos and threads like this one.

Before pulling together my parts list, I wanted to experiment with steering geometry to make sure I wasn't going to waste a ton of money and get nowhere.  So I modified my "Dip-Stick" so the rear-wheel doesn't caster and the front one still does.  To do it right, I should also add structure so the board doesn't articulate in the middle - but I didn't bother.  I did however mount my front caster flat to the bottom of the board deck.

I then tried riding it with a simple push, and then holding onto my wife's car.  I was pretty surprised that it seemed very unstable.  After remounting the caster as it had been on the Dip-Stick it became super-tame and rideable.  

The reason I mention this is because the angle of the caster is opposite of what I'm seeing on some of these 2-wheeled boards.  It looks like the board in this thread has its castering axis positioned forward (i.e. the bottom of the pivot axis is forward of the top).  Mine is the other way around.  The bottom is well behind the top (maybe 20 deg?).

If you think about a bike, it has effectively a reversed caster on the front wheel.  In other words, the axle is in front of the pivot axis.  Additionally, the pivot axis is slanted forward as it is on the board on this thread.

But our wheels are castering in the traditional manner - not like a bike.  Ours caster like the wheels on a shopping cart - the wheel axle is behind the pivot axis.  Perhaps that's why my mutant Dip-Stick became so tame when I also gave it the opposite slant to the castering axis.

Now, there's every possibility you guys have done all the math and experimentation already.  I'm just going by my little experiments being pulled by my wife's car.  Once I set the caster axis backward I could easily hang back and carve turns - until the urethane came off the rollerblade wheel.

Now I have to decide whether to make a reasonably nice steering system like you guys did, or first rough something out and play with the geometry until I'm really liking it.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

I think I'm going to write a simple program that will let me enter the linkage lengths and to simulate how it affects the caster. Moving the mouse left-right will control the steering.  I'll post some results here.

I've written the program to simulate the steering geometry.  It's quite basic, but I think it does what I need.  I can change the lengths of the links and the spacing of the pivot points.  By moving the mouse I can see how it steers, which gives me an idea of the caster point (and how that point moves). 

Here's a screen-grab, and hopefully the link will allow you to see a several second animation.

Having thought some more about the problem, and consistent with my experiment the other day, I feel confident that canting the pivot axis backward (bottom of axis is aft) rather than forward, should add significant stability.  In this configuration, steering the wheel in either direction will raise the board a bit.  While canting it forward would have the result of lowering the board when steering the wheel off center.

I'll post results here when I make a (probably rough) working model.

@spork Are you still building your 2 wheel board? I"ve been building a 2 wheel based on the "speedboard" from kickstarter. Mine isn't any easier to steer, i've started playing with the caster angle. and the steering did improve a bit when i pitched it up. i will have to pitch it down next.
