Hello everyone! This is my first post and this is my first eskate build. I been researching for the past few weeks trying to figure out the best way about this. First, I just want to say this forum and its users have been a tremendous amount of help and has really propelled me along on my research. I've all but narrowed down to the last few pieces to what I think I want and want to make sure everything is compatible. As I don't have a deep background on skating in general, I do believe I'll need some help. I've skated a little bit before, but mostly for commute purposes and never even owned a longboard (just a normal popsicle board and a penny board). My reasoning for building an electric skateboard is because I want a different way to commute to work and because I do enjoy building and making things. I don't have a set speed or range in mind. I don't really have a set budget either but I'm not necessarily tying to get the most expensive pieces on everything and break the bank. If a better build would require me to upgrade, that's fine. I don't mind saving up a bit more. I plan on buying a lot of the parts as I go along rather than trying to save up and buy at once. I have already bought the deck and it is in the mail.

**[Deck](https://www.muirskate.com/photos/products/2969/product_Earthwing-Superglider-v2-%28Set-HD%29.png)** - used Earthwing SuperGlider 38" x 9.5"

**[Motors](products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv)** - TorqueBoard 6355 190kV x2

**[Mount](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/motor-mounts/products/motor-mount-1?variant=4993928986654)** - mounts from buildkitboard x2  *link provided by moon.

***[Belt and Pulley](collections/electric-skateboard-pulley-belt-combo-kits/products/36t-abec-pulley-combo-kit)** - TorqueBoard 36T ABEC pulley 12mm combo kit x2

**[VESC](https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/)** - FocBox Unity ESC

**Battery** - going to assemble myself but plan on 10s4p w/ Samsung 30Q 18650 battery cells

***[Remote](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543/51)** - DIY remote from fellow user solidgeek. 

Okay, this is what I got thus far and I will try to delve into it a bit more for clarity. The parts with asterisk beside them are not hard locks yet, but I am open to any ideas on anything really. I ordered a used SuperGlider online because I was convinced on here they were good and they have been discontinued but I really really wanted a longboard with a kicktail. I originally wanted to get dual 6374 motors but I came to realize that I would be pushing for space and didn't want to get 218mm trucks because I was worried it might look a little too wide and thus weird. I'm not too sure, but I've come to terms with 6354 and I'm sure they will be more than enough. The hills here are fairly tame here and this is my first build. I was just more worried about heat. I'm not sure on the belt and pulley kit. There's a 36T and a 40T. I haven't done the math yet when it comes to the electrical and mechanical system yet but I'll get there. I will be acquiring a spot welder but I want to build my own battery pack. I'll figure out details on that when it comes to it but I'm not sure yet if it will need to be 12s4p or a series of 10 is fine. I guess when I narrow down the VESC, I'll know the answer to that. Or maybe what VESC I have won't matter for what my battery setup will need to be. I plan on using LG HG2 which seems to be one of the better Lithium-ion on the market, but I'm not 100% certain because a lot of what I been reading up on hasn't been very recent. I will say I am NOT down for LiPo and am certain I want Li-ion. The VESC is what is really giving me a lot of trouble. I really don't know what to go for. Even after all my research, I am not that much closer to really knowing what I want to get. I want a high quality one but also don't want to wait an undisclosed amount of time for them either. 

Those are the main components that I have figured out. Of course there are misc items too. I will get a [battery indicator](https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/e-board-kits/battery-indicator-display/), riser pads, and I will make my own enclosure. Is everything thus far compatible with each other? Am I missing an important detail or part that I probably should have? Should I post links of the items I have listed for simplicity sake or is that unnecessary? 

I can take pictures and record my journey on this if that would be interesting at all. I want to thank you for taking the time to read this.

_Edit_- Switched up my parts list to update comment suggestions. 
LG HE4 --> 30Q. Note, I do plan on thoroughly researching this battery building process.
SK 6354-260kV --> Torque Board's 6355-190kV.
I was sold on a Unity. Now I won't need to buy a power switch. I may need to change remotes for compatibility.
Nano --> DIY arduino based remote. This thing looks perfect for what I originally wanted. Small, sleek, boosted remote inspired, and no hobby remote trigger. I'm still reading the thread and figuring the details out. AFAIK, this should work and since I'm doing my own battery pack, this isn't too much extra.

Looks good! A few things, though, one, you should go with 2x focbox, they are the best on the market right now. Two, 10s battery combined with 260kv motors will be too much erpm for your esc, you should change your motors to 190kv motors

Yeah I don't know your budget but HE4 or HG2 (whatever you choose) aren't as good as Samsung 30Q. 

And have you made Liion packs before - a lot of research is required.

And these mounts are a bit cheaper and pretty much do the same job: (I have a pair for sale if your interested)

How are the focboxes? I was reading earlier that some of the initial batches weren't good but the american made ones were suppose to be better. How did that turn out?

And thanks for the info on the motors. The ones I am looking at are from HobbyKing. I can't find a 6354 for 190kV, but I found a 6364 190kV. Also, I meant to ask about sensored motors. Are they not necessary?

I don't really have a budget as long as it is reasonable. From what I gathered, LG HE4 are slightly better versions of HE2. But LG HG2 are better than those. 
The stats I read on HG2 say that it has 20A and 3000mAh.
30Q apparently runs 15A and 3000mAh. Or are you saying the quality of the Samsung cells are generally better?

I'm not opposed to those motor mounts though. As long as they can assist in being a heat sink.

Yeah forget the numbers, 99% of members here will tell you 30Q is the way to go. HG2 run hot I think, and 30Q are technically rated to 20A

Okay, I'm sure I saw different rpm/v on the same motor on HK. Just browsing on their site is a little tedious. So no sensor and no size change.

if you want to run FOC or hybrid mode its better to have sensored motors. yeah they cost you a little bit more but they actually run more efficient. also you'll get off the line better. with unsensored motors they tend to cog up a little bit and then get you moving if you don't push before engaging throttle
```

## \#14 Posted by: mynamesmatt Posted at: 2018-10-08T06:11:02.071Z Reads: 161

so basically the HK options are either:
Sensorless: SK3 63xx motor <200kv
Sensored: SK8 63xx motor <200kv

Sensorless is basically more if you wanna save a few dollarydoos

So I have an entire longboard now and none of the electrical or mechanical parts of it yet. I bought a used deck, took off the existing grip tape, sort of reshaped the front and tail end, and applied new grip tape. When naming this build, I decided to go all in on the green theme for better or worse. Since all the green won't be the same shade or anything, but maybe adding black into the mix will help a bit. I don't think it looks bad, but I can understand if someone didn't like the color scheme. The grip tape looks terrible because it was my first time applying grip tape and it is pretty coarse. So it was kind of difficult to cut cleanly. The imperfections are quite obvious with its wild colors. I'll get over it, but hopefully it doesn't take away from the overall looks. Also, it doesn't flatly sit on all four wheels. I don't recall it being lopsided yesterday, but I couldn't say with certainty. I'm not sure if it is because the deck got slightly warped or what. I'll look into it. I don't think it sitting in the trunk of my car for one day would have done that. I meant to go test it out today, but wasn't able to. I plan on trying it out tomorrow.

Great advice from what I can tell so far. I went with the mini remote instead of the nano. I have heard the nano is less reliable. The mini does look really bad, but I am planning on gutting it and making my own enclosure. Plus I will have that extra channel for that extra shhh, oh and it seems to be very reliable

If you want a more reliable remote that is also compact, I have heard good things about the benchwheel

edit: as for you board not sitting flat, I would say it could likely be your bushings. It isn't really a problem when riding. Try manually pushing the truck to a far extreme and it may not return perfectly to center, you could put some lube on your bushings, helps with the squeeks I hear, I don't really worry about it...

The deck looks really good though, I find that I really appreciate imperfections. One should celebrate them and smile.... The top of that deck looks so good, some clear would look really good on it, but I think the clear is not very good for grip as black and others. Did you try scraping the edge hard with the shaft of a screwdriver where the grip tape rolls off the edge of the board? then take a sharp razor blade at an angle and neatly cut the edges?

Yea, I been reading meh things about MBoards and now even from _DIYBoards_. So I will be reconsidering my items from there. 

It won't be too difficult to change up remotes even though most remotes out there don't really do it for me. The nano is one of the only "cheaper" ones that looks sleek and compact. It just apparently has the problems of not being reliable. I'll look into those suggested options though.

The more difficult issue is trying to find an alternative place for motors and the pulley systems.

Hmm, that could be it. I was stressing out the flexibility of it last night. Trying to get a feel for how I will have to go about doing the batteries and enclosures, kind of like how you are figuring out how to go about it. I was also stressing out on the leans to make sure I wouldn't get wheel bite. I will definitely look at the bushings. Thanks

Edit- I confused DIYBoards with diyeboards. So I will continue getting my listed parts from there later this week unless someone suggests otherwise.

sorry, made some edits above... Wheel bite could be an issue without risers on that setup, not 100% sure. I am going with 10" trucks on my glider. Maybe I can  try some stuff out for you here. I have a few trucks and wheel sizes on hand

Yea, I watched several videos on applying it. I got the jist of it. I used a screwdriver to score it. Unfortunately, because the type of grip this was, it was more coarse than your average grip tape. So it really made it more difficult. Also it dulled the blade way faster. I probably should have used more than one. I know my angle wasn't perfect either. I think what makes it so obvious is the contrast between the bright green and the tape being white.

![CloseGripTape2|374x500](upload://7PsS7B0rqDLWirhTtd33WpS6V7B.jpeg) 

I currently have 1/4" risers now.

I do like the grip tape. Makes it stand out and is pretty unique. It's just very flashy on all fronts, good and bad. lol :sunglasses:

I like those boards with a personal flair. Looks sweet.

The trucks are 184. I have to have the wide ones for the dual setup I'm going for. I definitely wanted wider trucks for more stability but didn't want to make them too wide. Everything that I have or plan on getting are in links in my original post. I'll keep updating and editing it as my plans may change due to new information. And yea, I plan on riding today to get a feel for things. I didn't really skate much as a kid, as it was a phase and I lived on dirt roads at the time. So I didn't get much out of it, so I want to find a secluded area.

Brian from EW originally designed the superglider around TKP Indy's, that's why the 169s were recommended for the board, as that was the largest width Indy makes. 

The superglider in this thread is actually my old deck. Even when new in 2009 the board had a slight wheel lift between the corners, but it never affected rideability. EW boards were pretty notorious for warping, but I never left it in the garage or the car, always brought it back in the house when I was done riding to prevent any additional warping. I think it had something to do with the way it got laid up, many of them had a slight warp. FWIW I also have a newer miniglider and it exhibits the same behavior. My cruiser 36, team 37, and 2017 supermodel do not have any warp / wheel lift. ![IMG_20180705_204733|666x500](upload://3eGSVSwlZg3BG7d7OuF3ATVMqoV.jpeg)

```
it's funny, I didn't want to like Sharks.  I was squarely in the 'real wheels are green' camp with ABEC forever, and kinda still am.  Centrax is kind of perfect.

I tried a set of Shark's 70MM wheels on SR TKP with one of my Icarus pump boards, and that one is a Flex 2 so it bottoms out, so I shelved that Icarus and got a Flex 1 on Kegels, instead.

Way later, someone sent me these 60MMs and I thought 'why not' since their Shiver bearings came with them -  and first time on it, I almost ate it on a hill that I was doing every day, I picked up /so/ much speed and these Sharks get icy on leaves.

I also noticed that, on this particular EW deck with the factory Indys, upgraded bushings, etc. - deck cannot wheel bite.  It's as if the deck, trucks and wheels were designed for one another.

I think the EW SuperGlider is a landmark design.  Delivers everything the Ceviche failed to bring. :)

Ha, that's pretty awesome to find you on here. That is indeed your old board. Thanks for the warping info, I remember reading about that in my initial research of deck hunting and long forgot about that issue. It's reassuring to know that minor warp won't affect riding. 

With my 90mm flywheels and 184" trucks, do you recommend riser pads? If so, is 1/4 enough or should I go with 1/2? I did fill in the holes where you relocated the front trucks closer to the nose. Was that just a personal preference or what? 

Thanks for letting me have this sweet deck for a moderate price. :smiley:

Thanks! I hope to not disappoint! Slowly working on it.

I also was able to ride a little today. The board is super sweet. Lot easier to be able to cruise around and maneuver than when learning with a popsicle board. Obviously the giant soft wheels allow for a much smoother ride. Still, as I stated previously, I'm still a novice and don't have much experience. I still got some kinks to work out, but I really looking forward to putting motors on this bad boy. 


Side note. I tried to go to an abandoned mall/industrial park near my home since it would have space and wouldn't be in anyone's way. Technically not suppose to trespass and there's cement blocks blocking all the entryways. So I had to find a nearby place to park. I did and it looked like I was near some hobo camp. Oh well, I trek to the area, and the moment I dart across the road and up the small hill. There was a police car just chilling in the parking lot about 100 yards away. Lol, I was annoyed and immediately darted back down and back to my car. I found somewhere else nearby, but I have a feeling this might not be an uncommon occurrence.

I was just doing some battery research and found some favorable information on the Sony VTC Konion series of batteries. It seems they have a slightly raised positive electrode which can increase reliability of isolation from the case negative electrode. Just another option to consider vs the 30Q.

Slight update. Most everything has arrived. The few things that aren't here are somewhere in transit and the last bit of items was ordered during Black Friday. What is annoying is that I don't have all of one thing. So I can't really go ahead and start on something. Still missing some components for the remote, or missing a mount, or whatever. I also am in the middle of testing my nickel strips. I bought 5m from AliExpress and got a small sample with my boss welder. Unfortunately, it seems both are not pure but steel strips coated in nickel. I don't know what to do. Attempting from AliExpress again will take too long. Amazon is way pricier. Ugh.

Otherwise, I been setting up a small workshop station in a corner of one of my rooms. So I'm excited to get building and tinkering. I'll post pictures later I guess.

Sigh. My motor mount isn't long enough to make the pulley taut. I'm not sure how to go about this. Maybe I should just file the holes to allow the motor to sit farther. Or maybe I should just buy different mounts.

Or I can not be a dumbass and just get a shorter belt. I currently have 265mm belt, so I think 255mm will be enough to not be loose. This works out because it's cheaper and I can't get this shit off without potentially breaking something. I've already slightly damaged my motor pulley. Fairly annoyed about that.

I'm not sure how I should do updates. Keep making new post? Editing earlier ones? Make new post and just edit those? idk, anway...

I basically have all my parts minus a mount and the Unity. So I been slowly working on stuff now. I'll be starting the battery pack in a few days. Been working on my remote this past week. I just now installed the half of the motor and mechanical stuff that I can. I must say the new hex wrenches I got are wonderful. I even got a hex bolt I would have not been able to tighten otherwise due to it being in a cramped spot at an angle because my belt is so short I can't tighten before I put on the wheel and belt. I'm going to post some pictures.

My haul I got from Black Friday minus a set of wheels I couldn't turn down.

First side installed!

Bolt I was able to tighten only because of the new wrenches I got. I'm so glad I listened to you guys on the forum.

I'm not too sure about this small clearance. I assume it's okay but it still worries me. This is the only configuration I can do. The mount isn't long enough for the original belts I got with the set which were 265mm long. My only other feasible option is to get another set of motor mounts.

Remote Progress. Probably could be farther but I'm way too meticulous for my own good sometimes.

I didn't take a picture of all the individual components because it was literally a month between receiving the first piece to getting the last piece AFTER waiting a while from initially ordering. Got my voltage converter on November 11th and got my magnets (last item) December 11th. Anyway, overview.

My receiver being wired minus the capacitor set.

Probably could have done it more compact, meh.

First section of the remote. I really couldn't do this sooner because I was missing the lipo charging board. I actually just ended up buying more off of Amazon because I got impatient. I still haven't received my original order of them.

More progress. Some work on the nano, OLED, and nRF24.

Batteries. Not much progress yet on this.

I've only siliconed the parallels groups together.

I do want to add that this process would have been so much easier if I had a holder. I didn't get sent any in my shipment and I don't have a 3D printer, yet. So it took a littler longer making sure I had it lined up right. Obviously it could have been done haphazardly and maybe it would have been fine. I just don't think when I went to spot weld all these together and make it into a pack that it would have been as neat or tightly compact as it would have been.

So I got my unity in yesterday. Last thing I'm missing is one of my mounts. I still can work on other stuff because I don't have everything ready to just plug in yet. As I was going through things I realized none of my things match though. I have 2mm and 5.5 bullet connects. My motor uses 5.5mm. Unity uses 3.5mm. The sensor plug is much smaller than the plug in for the unity. I only have male servo connectors, so I'm gonna have to figure that out. Obviously I could have known all of this beforehand but with all the information I've already had to gather and retain, there's no way I could have caught all of this. It's only my first build, so I'm gonna miss so much of this shit. Now I'm debating if I should gather all the correct sizes and make small connector cables for them all or if I should just chop off one side and solder the correct connections. Anybody have any suggestions?

Well I just realized the unity came with some bullet connectors. So I think I'll just make a small connection wire that will go from 3.5mm male to 5.5 male to connect unity and motor. So that I won't need to cut off any wires and void any warranties. Still I need to figure out about the sensor cables. I know they aren't necessary but I have them, so I might as well use them. I will also need to get female servo connectors.

You can directly plug in the servo connector in the ppm port

For the servo plugs, usually with the Arduino for the remote you get pin headers. You can use those and stick in between the male plugs to connect them, just make sure to secure them with some glue or such.

Here’s a nice workaround for the bullet connectors:

Also, conveniently, you can take the back side of a 3.5 and plug it directly to the back side of a 5.5. They just so happen to fit. Add a dab of solder for a firm connection and some heat shrink for professionalism. About to do this myself.

Excellent suggestions. Thanks guys. That's more of an elegant solution with the bullet connectors, at least less wires.

@blasto I saw that I could plug in the servo directly in, but doesn't seem super snug. I guess either way, I'm gonna need to super glue? Or use pin headers like @AxelF suggested, which I have tons and tons of jumper cables and pin headers.

_edit_ OHHH! I see what you mean by using the pin headers. Yea dude, that's so much easier. Thanks dude!
