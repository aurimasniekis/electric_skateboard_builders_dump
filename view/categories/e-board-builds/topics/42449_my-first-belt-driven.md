I am a total newb, and my first build was a hub motored board. I am planning to use a sk3, 192 kv motor, and I was wondering would my esc give the motor  a bottleneck? Thank for helping a newb like me.

Uh.. No. You need a VESC homie. Regular ESC's are just not worth it in the long run(<-:joy: get it?).

be nice. 

yes that esc you found on ebay will be a bottleneck. 

there's a long thread about it, search "esc ebay" or something like that.

Though, that esc will handle 6s voltage and the inherent amp draw better than a vesc...

So many other factors to read about.

The biggest bottleneck is going to be the 6s battery and 192kv motor combo.

yep, unless ur runnning a tiny battery, pay another 50$ to get a proper controller...a vesc comes to mind.

According to the seller, dicky ho, with a solder iron you can configure it for up to 10s, which was what I was planning to do. Would that still be a bottleneck?
```

Still a bottleneck. From what we've found with that esc it has a top out speed regardless of voltage. (19mph) and it overheats.

For your first board, it'll work fine as long as you don't try to run FOC on it

If you're looking for a cheap intro to the vesc, get a maytech. They are now 3.3 and FOC compatible for $110

the torque one is also 100$. Is the maythech one any better?

Maytech is hit or miss, heard just as many bad things as good things.

The torqueboard one is good, ive seen a lot running them in Foc without problems.

ok. Also, i am using kgel wheels, and will get the pulleys and stuff from diy electric.com. There are 2 options, 16t and 14t. Which one should I get? I am using an sk3 6374.

What KV? If you want better hill climb and low-speed torque use 14t, but if you want to go flat and fast go with 16t or higher. You generally want around 200kv motors
```

## \#20 Posted by: sid1 Posted at: 2018-01-02T02:42:31.169Z Reads: 154

192 kv. I want to make a board that can handle hills, so I will go with 14t.
```

Just a heads up, you need to mill a key slot or flat edge on the motor shaft so you can secure the pulley. Also the motor shaft is 8mm, you need to mill it down to 6mm for the pullies to fit. If you don't know what I am talking about please just invest in more money and get a TB motor.

on the hobbyking website, the motor says it has an 8mm shaft.
```

## \#23 Posted by: ZackoryCramer Posted at: 2018-01-02T05:07:44.907Z Reads: 144

Yes, and they pulley you get from TB is built for 6mm shafts, so you need to mill down the diameter of the motor shaft
```

## \#24 Posted by: Colson003 Posted at: 2018-01-02T05:18:13.542Z Reads: 141

No, TB motor pulleys are meant for 8mm shafts.
TB motors have 8mm shafts too.

As I said...They are now 3.3 and FOC solid. 

You haven't heard anything about their new version. TB is still the same. And doesn't like FOC.
