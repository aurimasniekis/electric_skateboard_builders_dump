This is my first real big post on this forum as well as being my first build so bear with me. 

This board is far from being complete and will be in the making for the following months.
Part list for now:
-Dual enertion FOC box
-Dual SK8 6374 130KV
-MBS comp95 deck (will be reshaped and painted)
-MBS matrix tucks 1st gen with axles turned down to 9.525mm
-MBS all terrain wheels
-custom mounts (to be done)
-36t driven pulley
-14t drive pulley
-12s lipo battery to start
-12s4p li-ion sony 2300mah 30A discharge (on order)
-custom enclosure kaly style

By the parts you can probably guess I am aiming to build a board pretty similar to a kaly board while trying to save a bit of money, cuz lets face it I aint loaded!

This thread ia for me to keep a record of what I've done and to maybe help someone that will undertake a similar build in the future.

So far I've turned down the axles of my trucks on the lathe from 12mm to 9.525mm... It was a bigger challenge than anticipated

First i tried removing the axles that way. It worked for one then after stripping 2 nuts I made a tool to extract the axles
![IMG_20180622_173319|375x500](upload://xMU8xkJ3CAsvGd2TKnqbfFIRUFh.jpg)
The tool
![IMG_20180623_092554|374x500](upload://4SGbaz63lOjDbMstxUaHoRZL3Xp.jpg)

The removal process was the hardest. After that it was just a quick trip to the lathe and cuting new threads. Almost automagically it was done!

Before
![IMG_20180622_174357|374x500](upload://hNuiVeUtDEbgnjZsV9InIH0FlTx.jpg)

After
![IMG_20180623_151626|374x500](upload://gEGNCUlUmfEgJcy3BgsZel1AM0I.jpg)

All of this was to fit mbs all terrain wheels with special bearings.
![IMG_20180628_171954|375x500](upload://pm3FVx2iaszJbOSJasIcbzJRuF7.jpg)

So right now im waiting for parts.

Cant wait to hear what you guys think of my not so common choice of parts to build a kaly style board!

Got a bit of time today and managed to strip the paint off my deck... Took longer than expected but so does most things in the esk8 world :wink: 

I started off by pelling off the plastic cover that was on the top of the deck.
![IMG_20180704_154445|666x500](upload://7lrvgkWA6gUwbMtj5m3wOtxjMEM.jpg)

Then I sanded what was left with the orbital sander. 
![IMG_20180704_160654|666x500](upload://x3ERS0sWWkfjFmt9vA8G8B5ClZG.jpg)

Now I just need to decide what I want to do for the top color. I am hesitant between going all black or doing a dark wallnut stain with a clear coat over it.

Lots of parts comming soon, motors, wiring and connectors were supposed to arrive today but i missed the ups guy.... I'll post a quick mock up when the parts arrive until then the parts hunt continues!

So I'm still waiting for some parts but its getting there, in the next 2 weeks I should be able to have almost everything mounted on the board. Here's a pic of a couple things I already have received ![IMG_20180709_125620|666x500](upload://lArgCrh04whwTK4lZubkZ78cDRp.jpg):wink:

I'll soon do a little trimming on my deck and I'm wondering if anyone has ever trimed a mbs comp 95 or any other mountain board of similar shape. If so whats the best way to go about it?... I've drawn a rough sketch of the kind of cut I want to make, any comments are more than welcomed!

I have the same deck and will be doing the same to the nose/tail so i'm also looking for information/tips on the process.

I remember a MBS Birds build/deck that had a nose/tail job... @benjammin the MBS Comp birds build from last year was that yours or do you remember whos it was?  
i did search but couldn't find it :frowning:

Nice to see we are heading in the same direction. Best idea I have for now is to CAD my deck and do a template for cutting the exact shape I want.

Think il be hand cutting a few templates of the tip i will fold them in half and cut both at the same time for symmetry, il do a few variants then use the one i like the look of the most as the template for cutting the actual deck.

Yep, that was mine ðŸ™‚ Just had to notch the corners out a little to make room for the drive.

Yeah, I just kinda eyeballed it. Sorry I don't have a better photo handy. Pretty much what you have drawn above without shaving the tip off.

Two questions. one are those added cap banks?

![xtracaps|208x252](upload://uHUXhnPlxhaWmXAUcWeABqXuXpa.PNG)

and two, build thread i couldn't find it you got a thread :link: so i can have a re-read?

Yes, I added cap banks. May not have been necessary though. A lot of Max6 builds without, but my battery leads are pretty long. Was getting some stuttering at speeds without.

I also took a cue from @benjammin and notched my Comp 95 deck. I just mounted everything up and marked where the pulleys/belts hit the deck then cut sections out with a hack saw and some files. Ended up cutting about 3/4" out of each side of the tail, IIRC. This is the best photo I could find showing the cut out.

I did have my idlers mounted like that initially, but then decided to drill separate holes for them. 

There's so little room between bearings and motor pulley that belts are more likely to heat up (+ premature wear) and board will also run with more drag. 

With the separate holes for the idlers belts run a better (and cooler). Getting belts on and off is also a lot easier.

So I've been quite busy recently and didn't find the time to post the progress.

I've been taking pictures continuously while building so at least I didn't forget about that. :laughing: 

For the cut out I finally decided to make a template but after drawing it on the board and taking a couple of measurements I realised that the base plate of the trucks would be showing on either sides...

![IMG_20180711_191535|375x500](upload://hE1mKD9ffW6ENUyUEEX8wUw6tc6.jpg)

On the mechanical side I've mounted the motors and aligned the pulleys with @Rithblu motor mounts. They were super easy to install and they look super good! Also the service was great and the price too, would highly recommend if you are looking for good quality cheap MTB mounts.

![IMG_20180725_130328|374x500](upload://vFwxcTJqfdnFmNm4R44m0zK2jQd.jpg) 

For the electronics I didn't do a lot yet... just converted the focbox phase leads to 12AWG with 4mm bullets. Here's a couple pics of the process.

![IMG_20180725_105934|374x500](upload://gFPhmf5KFYLB9Js7M9CJ6cGDFot.jpg)

![IMG_20180725_112041|375x500](upload://iftRZvlYbL2VDb1Pxor0Yu2WI4Z.jpg)

So thats pretty much it for the moment. I'll soon strap everything to the board to do a test run and to get a feel for how it rides. 

And the 12s4p li-ion plan changed I'll instead go for 12s lipo because I have another board in the making... spoiler its a spud! And I'll use the 30Q cells I have ordered on that build instead. I want the little spud to be my practical board and this monster to be the board I take out for fun and long rides so Li-po is not a concern for practicality.

Quick question for people that have built spuds... should I go dual 6355/6354 or 5055 is enough for 35kph with great hill climbing capabilities?

More to come!

Just a heads up this is a TEMPORARY setup just to test a couple things and finally ride this thing.
On 8s it does 33kph (or 20.5mph) I know it is slow for a dual 6374 setup but the torque is absolutely insane!! Also the final battery setup will be 12s.

Currently running foc sensored and it is smooth as butter! Super smooth startup and no stuttering at all. 

This was my first time riding a MTB and it is so comfortable! Even on brand new mbs all terrain wheels.

And yes I know the motors arent leveled I need to fix that.
