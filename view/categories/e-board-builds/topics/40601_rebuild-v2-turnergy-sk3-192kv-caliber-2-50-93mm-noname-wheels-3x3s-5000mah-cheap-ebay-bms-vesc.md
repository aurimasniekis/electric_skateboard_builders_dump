this is more or less just a rebuild from my First (failed) version "[The Printah](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-printa-6374-192kv-9s-5000mah-3d-printed-mount/22749/5)" 

before that i had 2 covers, one for the battery and one for the electronics

however, I eyballed pretty much everything and it just didnt look any good.
so i bought a new cheapish board (bamboo) and designed a new case.

i was actualy going for a 2 cover mount again, unti i figured out that i cann but everything into one box.
bms, vesc, 3x3s@5000mAh batterys, bms, receiver and BT module.
