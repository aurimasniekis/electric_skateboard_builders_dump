Hola Ladies, Gents and non-Binary humans,
Just recieved 2 beautiful Haya decks and figured havent done this in a while.... so why  not.

So I guess start with this:
Materials:

Hoyt remote x 2
Haya Sexy as shit Decks x 2
Varnish x 1 small can (one deck w/ gloss finish)
FocBoxs  x 4
Batteries TBD ( I believe the deck can fit 60+ cells each soooo at least 12s4p if not 5p)
Hummies hubs x1 (with matching Centrax front)
Surfrodz RKP 200mm black hanger w/ green bases
Push to start switch x2
Popoca Wheels.



I will update this as it is build progresses. Gotta pick up the trucks/hubs stateside over xmas so as with all things this will be a process.

Not sure....you mean to insulate the batteries and whatnot or....??
the lids have some very thin insulator on them and the battery trays came with a thin felt liner. i guess ill start thinking about lining when i start to adress the powering situation, again after xmas. Hipercor and other Chinese stores are all over in Madrid an usually have various thickness of foam/ plastic padding. ive used it on other builds.

Is this a typo or are you going with 2 sets of hummies?

Excited to see this unfold. I have a Haya coming with no immediate plans in mind. Going to very slowly start collecting parts for a build in the next year or so. So much innovation this last year itâ€™s unbelievable. Excited to see what this next year brings. All I know is these Hayas are a perfect platform for a stealthy af street build. 
Keep rocking it monkey man!
Also, Iâ€™m a huge fan of Calvin and Hobbes, so love your profile picture.

So I have a pile of 20 packages to pick up when I'm stateside  avoid shipping and import tax...
Fuck you Spain!!).....included the set of hummies, surfrodz, and a bunch of rubber bozen risers....so I'm gonna be playing around with various setups. Only layed down two coats of varnish but I'm liking the glossy edition I'm making.....not yet glassy but will get there

Do you have to varnish the deck, or is that already done?

So I read....I'll consider it......it's something like 50- 100 dollars per extra bag......plus the pain in the ass of getting all the shit to and from the airport both there and in Spain.....maybe one or two extras could be done though.

Playing with battery ideas cell holders, and cell type .....21700 /switching to more durable (less fire prone) A123 cells...no see. Printed some placeholders to see how shit fits. Left are 26650 (A123) and right are the 21700.

How will you get bigger cells in there? Also NESE tabs are spaced for 18mm cells? Even if you make the case design larger

Like the Kaly drive

Yeah sorry mixing threads....

Will be trying 18650 and NESE type holders for at least one of the two HAYA boards. Sounds like @Winfly might release his files publicly which I'd want to trail as well. 

I tested the 21700 cell samples in the HAYA and they fit but just.  Not sure if it's enough space when connecting with wires ect...... wouldn't be using NESE modules for these larger cells if I try. May require additional hollowing. 


![IMG_20180827_211606|666x500](upload://695Q8IMMaw9GeafX6s2jxX38H35.jpeg) 

I primarily wanted the larger higher output cells for the Carver build with Kaly drives in the last image. Pneumatics and big ass thane that rides on the Holy Pro 35 Carve sucks the Juice quick.

 Also the flex makes me wary of energy dense combustibles and cables and shorts and fire. These being stored in our apt. - that's the reason for A123 cell  -they seem slightly more stable/durable
