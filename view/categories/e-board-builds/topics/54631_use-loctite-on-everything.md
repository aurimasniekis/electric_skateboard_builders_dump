I build my board and did not loctite all screws an almost had a very bad experience.....will not run a board until I ensure loctite Blue or Red added to every screw.... not worth it. 

Trust me....

I think you had an experience similar to mine. I didn't glue the two screws of the motor mount and I went to test the range of my built. During the ride  I noticed something wasn't going well (strange noises) I arrived home after 30 km with just one screw on the motor mount and It was quite loose.

You dont wanna use threadlocker on every screws, some screws are meant not to have it since they have a locking nut on the other side :-)

What's your experience with auto locking nylon nuts? I've been using them without loctite for at least 60-100 km and they haven't loosened a bit

You know, some people have had those experiences, but I've ridden my board incessantly and have never needed locktite. And I even wiggle every part including the pulleys to see if they have loosened and nothing.

Ok guy's here is the story.....

Was riding and started to hear a clicking noise and new that was not a good deal.  Pulled over and I had lost one on the bolts on the pulley wheel and the other was hitting motor screw mounts.  I was still 2 miles away from home so to it slow.... when i inspected I had lost motor screw and another was loose.  I am running dual motor so pulled everything apart and applied Locate blue and yes let it cure overnight. 

The reality this could have jammed up and locked wheels at over 20mph.....again for safety loctite and cure properly.

Good luck,

Keivn

Always have some kind of locking. Doesn't matter if it's nyloc nuts, loctite, safety wire, whatever. They all help keep you from streeting your face.

At work (I work on airplane engines) we have some form of locking on EVERY. SINGLE. FASTENER.
loctite, safety wire, lock washers, lock nuts, cotter pins, palnuts. You name it, we use it.

Because having a failure while riding an esk8 is one thing, but in mid air, failure is NOT an option.

Airplane security factor on all parts is 10
So if something is supposed to hold a 100kg load
It must be able to hold 1000kg

For eskate its not needed so much IMO
But on motors and mounts I would not put the screws on without anything to hold them in place

Gotta say but I haven‚Äôt had great experiences with nylon lock nuts so far for esk8, I used them on my old motor mounts and they would vibrate loose after about 10km. I ended up double lock nutting and using loctite to get it to hold.

I need to revive this thread for some help. What is the next step up from locknuts and loctite, my shit honestly won't hold together for more than 20km. Should I try red loctite or is there something better?

Nothings come lose in a few weeks.

It‚Äôs always just the bolts holding the motor mount arm to the clamp. It‚Äôs happening on both builds, one with 4 bolts and the other with 3. The part that frustrates me is it will hold for a while then eventually fail.


@Battosaii I think I‚Äôm going to have to go to red and just hope I don‚Äôt have to take it off again

Which mount is it? Do you have a photo?
If you do use mega loctite, you can always get it off with some heat.

Are you using left or right? Left is better.
Are your screws engaging all the treads with motor?

I am using my own custom mounts. I‚Äôll get some pics in a minute. They are just simple steel plates bolted to an aluminium clamping piece.

Here we go, not the best pics but you get the design. Just very basic as I used only hand tools.![image|374x500](upload://v3o1pwlxaAMVmLBnDaVvj4RGkCF.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://uVNjkEZcyqEhBL2xHE1QyftUn7k.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://9mDJtDP26DOwb1BL0bFbRbXmxvY.jpeg) ![image|374x499](upload://5grnKo5xrJS07K7G1HXOGBbJ3jg.jpeg) 

Edit: These were pics from the mock up, ignore any missing bolts and stuff like that.


@Grozniy I am using the bolts on the right side, I know the left is better but the extra cap length won‚Äôt fit as I am running 180mm trucks

It‚Äôs. it the softer aluminium that‚Äôs wearing that‚Äôs causing stuff to come loose is it?

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the aluminium that‚Äôs being worn. Some how the bolts loosen no matter how much force or Loctite I apply. The only solution I can think of is to apply red Loctite, I have some 609 that I guess I could try

Are you using stainless steel or alloy bolts?  
Also are you allowing cure time for the Loctite?

## \#28 Posted by: lrdesigns Posted at: 2018-10-29T08:12:04.199Z Reads: 80

I think your motor plates still have some flex that is causing the 3 bolts to keep coming loose. Even though you have the support plate. I would add an extra support on the other side as far back as you can. 

Red loctite should do the trick though, and you can just use some heat if you need to take them off later.

## \#29 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-10-29T08:18:38.038Z Reads: 78

Stainless and 24-36h cure time. 

@J0ker3366  I‚Äôm applying as much torque without stripping the screws.

@lrdesigns The mounts have minimal flex but I would like to add another support too.

I think I‚Äôll use some red Loctite ard report back, Thanks guys üëç

Yeah I think minimal flex is still enough to work screws loose over time. As you accelerate hard or brake hard there is just a little left / right flex that slowly works the screws loose.

Decent alloy hex head can withstand a lot more torque

I'm able to torque these down tight enough that I actually don't even use Loctite at the moment and haven't had them come loose once

When I was first putting my board together I was using the Basic Hardware I had & the cheapest set of Allen heads I could find.
I was having to retighten and replace stripped bolts sometimes daily.
I switched over to quality tools and Hardware and it's like night and day.

Let me tell you lol. These wrenches are clutch! And with the screws too I can torque screws into the mount on one of my boards. If you can find panhead philips head screws, you can use a socket wrench with the appropriate philips head bit nd can torque them down. Its how I run on one of my other boards. And just like @Skunk said, I have no need for loctite on either boards.

@pat.speed make sure threads are clean. There are loctite variants that can tolerate a bit of oil. You can also use primer to make sure it cooks correctly.

There's also green loctite that's as strong or stroger than red, and can wick into already assembled stuff.
