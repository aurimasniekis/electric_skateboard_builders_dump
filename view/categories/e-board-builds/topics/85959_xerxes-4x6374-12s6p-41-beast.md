This board started out as a @torqueboards Pro3 kit build. I'm 5'7‚Äú, so I didn't want or need a board with a super wide stance. I chose the Madrid Paddle Board deck it feels just perfect for me with a 31" wheelbase 9.75" width, a symmetrical design and small but usable kick tails. Kick turns are possible, but not terribly easy, still beats picking up your board to turn it around! Here are the basic specs:

12s6p LG2's arranged in three trapezoidal rectangles so that it's 12x3x2. Built by @psychotiller 

4x Torqueboards 190kv 6374 motors

Geared 16x36, although I do have 20t motor gears...

4x 280x15mm belts

4x Torqueboards inrunner motor mounts 

Torqueboards 218 hangers on 44 degree Caliber two baseplate with riptide pivot cups, standard riptide barrels over cubbies. 

1/2" risers

Muir skate beasto built-ins  bearings

Abec 11 107mm fly wheels

Modified micro controller

Y PPM splitter connects front and rear master vescs

4x Fvesc 6.6 setup with a master and slave both front and back. 80A motor max 30A battery max -15A brakes, - 6V regen

8awg silicone wire built into battery, and running the connection from the back to the front

8awg loop key

10awg silicone wires trough 5x parallel connector in back with standard parallel connector in front to vescs

20a 5v step down for future reactive lighting system etc

Custom "Xerxes" enclosure made by @psychotiller mounted with wood inserts and machine screws 

Pictures soon to follow.

Okay, after first test ride, I need to increase braking, and smooth out throttle response a bit. Also, need to afix motor wires better too. But this thing is bonkers cruises at 10+ by just barely cracking the throttle. I'm waiting on the fourth vesc, but even with just three motors it would climb relatively steep hills at 25mph with perhaps half throttle. Dang.

Well, I probably have 30+ hours in it if you count trips to psychotiller's and the hardware store. Lots of things had to be done over again when I got a better solution to the problem. So, out of pocket something like:

$150 deck

$15 for vicious grip tape

$10 for truck hardware and risers

$35 for bushings

$60 for 44 degree caliber 2 base plates

$500 for battery

$80 for enclosure

$60 Torqueboards 218 trucks

$130 Torqueboards motor mounts

$500 Torqueboards motors

$25 Belts

$75 Torqueboards 36t wheel pulleys

$35 Torqueboards 16t motor pulleys

$75 Wire and connectors

$15 Solder

$600 four Flipsky 6.6 vescs

$90 drvwizzard vesc repair

$125 107mm flywheels (genuine)

$20 Muirskate beasto built-ins bearings

$75 misc connectors and wire

$30 micro remote and reciever

$60 4A charger

Or about $2750

Well, practically speaking a 2wd is Plenty, so it would still be pretty cool for $600-$700 less, perhaps $900 less with a smaller battery. But, this thing was all about rediculousness the test ride was mind blowing, and someone was so impressed that they wanted to buy one. Plus, the four belts sound soooo cool, it almost sounds like turbines. I learned a lot getting the board to this stage, and built friendships along the way. So, if it were just for the board itself, probably not worth it. But for having the coolest thing I've ever owned, for all I learned along the way, having more friends and social opportunities, for what it's done to improve my mental and physical health, for how riding an Esk8 has boosted my skill on a traditional skateboard, for all the stories and battle scars, and for the huge smile inducing rediculousness TOTALLY WORTH It!

Just for comparison the current boosted stealth board has 2100w of power and a 14 mile range. This thing's got a max of about 12,500w and has a likely range of 20-30 miles. I doubt it could draw enough power from the battery to max out motor watts, but you get the idea. Whoa, just noticed that's 1.25 Gigawatts, the DeLorean only needed 1.21 Gigawatts! (correction, that's 12.5 Kilowatts

That's how much serious builds cost TBH.  I mean like he said, 2wd would have been $600 less or so, but quality builds cost money.


But once you try quality, you never want generic shit or ratty builds with economy parts ever again...


BTW, cool enclosure shape!

Oh, should have mentioned that with electric skateboards safety is always the highest priority. Don't cheap out on protective gear! Proper preferably full faced helmet, body armor, proper gloves and shoes, elbow pads hip and knee pads, sunglasses, and at higher speeds Kevlar reinforced pants and top are a good idea. Those all cost money too, frankly you ought to be spending as much in protective gear as you would on your first beginner electric skateboard. I highly recommend gloves with slides or pucks.

[quote="youseekcota, post:9, topic:85959"]
the DeLorean only needed 1.21 Gigawatts
[/quote]
I hate to let you know... that's 1.25 kilowatts not gigawatts...
but it's still stupid powerful!  In annoying freedom units, that's about 16.76 horsepower. About half the HP of an entry level sports bike, and a tenth of the weight of one.

to be giga, it would be 12,500,000,000 watts

Nice build man. Yeah 4wd 6374 can be a handful so much so that it's not even fun to ride till you get used to the power it's down right scary, if you blip the throttle by accident you will be sent into hyper space.

Update, now rolling with @psychotiller motors. Torqueboards motors are a great product, however psychotiller's motors are quieter, dramatically more efficient and in my opinion sound cooler. With a max input of 65amps they put out an astonishing 3520W per motor. That means this board has a max power output of 14,080W!

Thought it might be helpful to do a run through on some of the construction and vesc settings.

The battery plugs Into a custom made five way parallel Xt90 connector which has the following connections:
1. battery with 10awg silicone wire
2. back master FVESC
3. back slave FVESC
4. front single parallel connector 10awg silicone wire. 
5. 20A 5V step-down for future lighting and data logging systems

The front master and slave vescs hook up to the front single parallel connector

The front pair of 6.6 FVESCs are canbus linked to each other

The back pair of 6.6 FVESCs are canbus linked to each other

The receiver is connected to both the front and back master Vescs through a Y connector (thanks @mccloed) which runs front to back under the battety

Connecting the FVESCs like this allows you to have vesc settings that are specific to front and rear. It also allows for the use of traction control which is one of the cool features available on 6.6 vescs

Front vesc settings:
Motor max.                    65A
Battery max:                  30A
Max regen:                   - 30A
Max battery regen.     - 6A

Rear vesc settings:
Motor max.                    65A
Battery max:                  30A
Max regen:                   - 20A
Max battery regen.     - 6A

This means that the total battery draw and regen are 120A and 24A respectively. Also note how front brakes are stronger than rear as they should be. 

Battery details:
12s6p LG-2 18650 cells arranged in a roughly square trapezoidal brick with a Bestech charge only BMS assembled by @psychotiller. 

Battery cover: psychotiller's Xerxes

Motor details:
190kv
Idle Current: 0.8A Max. 
Current: 65A 
Input Volt.: 2‚Äê12s Lipo Max. 
Output Watt: 3520W Max. 
Pull: 9700g 
 (@psychotiller correct me if I'm wrong)

Motor mounts: torqueboards two piece version with inrunner brackets. 

Motor gears are 16Tx36T torqueboards ABEC drive I also have sets of 14T and 20T motor gears. Waiting on 390mm belts for the 20T, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat hesitant to use them. 

Belts are 280mm 15mm wide

Wheels: genuine ABEC 11 107mm

Bearings: Zealous built ins

Trucks use torqueboards 218 hangers on genuine caliber 2 baseplate 50¬∞ front 44¬∞ back with riptide tunnel risers, riptide 93 cup bushings, riptide chubby KRANK bushings with dual flat washers. 84 over 87, or 87 over 90 for a stiffer option. I also cut off the portion of the stock caliber two lower bushings that inserts into the hanger, and placed it between the other two bushings for added stability. At some point I'll upgrade to precision washers. Although the new trucks that @psychotiller is developing may be just too cool to pass up.

Griptape: full coverage Vicious

Deck: Madrid paddle board, a symmetrical double kick 41x9.5" stiff deck with simple and functional radial concave.

Rear light/grab handle: Blitzu off Amazon

Bluetooth interface: dual Metre Pro's

Those cool x brackets on top were provided by @mccloed

Everything inside is hot glued down, as are all connections.

There's no switch, I use an Xt90 loop key with 10awg wire for better reliability and efficiency

Build update. I'm now running dual Metr Pro's one for the Front master vesc, the other for the back master vesc. I don't think I'll be able to record at the same time (unless I use two phones,) but it will be great to be able to change all my vescs' settings from my phone. I've changed my settings too. Front brakes are -40 back are - 35.

Build update, put on the 20T motor gears and I really like them! Top speed, on paper is now 51mph, I've gotten it up to 42 briefly but I'd say about 35 is plenty fast for me at this point. The thing I like about the bigger motor gears is that I can go 35 and not be full throttle. Also the braking and acceleration is smoother. Had to up the brakes by 10 amps to compensate for the bigger gears.

Have you thought about lowering the rear truck angle to give yourself a bit more room in the higher speeds before you'll experience any sort of wobble?
