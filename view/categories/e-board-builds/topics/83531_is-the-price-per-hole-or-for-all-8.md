Are we trying to establish that Trampa charge money for labor that they need to put in to a deck? 

If so, yes, when people need to do things that cost them time they generally charge for it. That's sort of how business works.

For some things you DEFINITELY have to pay per hole.  Some holes are way more expensive than others.

But yeah, in this case it seems like, yeah, all holes included.  What a great deal.

Drilling hard or abrasive material is a good example right ? Milling heads need replacement and it's not free either.

Trampa may forget some stuff.
However they always respond immediately to any mistake they made and rectify it, unlike some other vendors.
Some of you may not like them because of the VESC TM thing but they have some of the best service in the business.

The same question was asked on a FB group. He hadnâ€™t bought the deck yet. I get it, communication problems etc. Problem is going to be when harder questions arise with OPâ€™s build ðŸ˜•

Still 30 replies regarding OPâ€™s question and no response, is that some sort of a record ðŸ¤”

Communication problems are not the issue here.
Nowadays using Google translate will more or less solve that albeit with a little more back and forth.
Not responding to all the people that are trying to help you though is the issue.
