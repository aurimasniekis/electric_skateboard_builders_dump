Some of you already know what‚Äôs going on but I am considering using an ebike controller. Not really, I plan to use focbox sir controllable settings. And suggestions?

Ebike esc will probably be better for your application since I‚Äôm not sure about thumb throttles and vesc even though vesc will blow the esc out of the water in programmability and smoothness

I have already figured out how to wire the thumb throttle directly to the focbox so that isn‚Äôt an issue. I really can‚Äôt think of any reason I would prefer the ebike controller but figured I would ask just in case someone had a reason I hadn‚Äôt thought of.

Oh if that‚Äôs the case I totally recommend the FOCbox over the bike esc.

It‚Äôs basically just an eboard with a different ‚Äúdeck‚Äù and remote style

I am currently running dual focbox with 7‚Äù pneumatics and 6374 and love it. It‚Äôs a wicked ride but it‚Äôs not traffic friendly lol

Yea I read your other thread, I‚Äôd just go with the FOCbox and if you end up not liking it switch it out for the esc

Do you know does the e-Bike ESC has RPM limit? Is it going to be ok with 190KV motor and 10s battery?
I konw that you will go with VESC but I'm just asking have you checked that?

Driving a huge mountainboard in the streets of Chicago could be a bit of a challenge üòÇ

Well if you could reach speeds of up to 30mph you'd just be going as fast as cars)) so don't see a huge problem. I was asking cause I want to build a board with 6 inch tires and was hoping to use it on the streets.

If you saw a car going 30 in Chicago it‚Äôs gotta be a police chase... üòÇ

Edit: in all seriousness, it‚Äôs probably becuase how unpredictable and stupid some Chicago drivers are

190kv is perfect for 10s.

I should have said it‚Äôs not NYC traffic friendly. It‚Äôs to big for the tight traffic and having to dodge potholes that are 3-4‚Äù deep is nearly impossible. I‚Äôm sure someone would enjoy it but it‚Äôs just not for me.
