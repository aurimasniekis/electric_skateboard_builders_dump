This being a work in progress, I'll post updates as progress is made. 

First off, I want to thank all members of the forum for support after I ended up donating the guts of my last board to an e-scooter. I especially want to thank @chris.hunt for his incredible generosity, as well as @mmaner and other anonymous members who helped me to both design this and purchase parts for it. I'll find a way to repay you at some point (preferably when I can find time to go down to LA for a ride :smile:).

Anyways, on to the actual build. This will be a dual drive EMTB with 63mm motors on @Idea mounts, running a 10s12p battery. The ultimate goal is to be able to both ride in comfort up the hills of SF and go camping in areas with trails using a trailer that I've built for this purpose. I've ordered and received many of the parts, some are still on the way. Here's the breakdown:


Deck, Trucks, Wheels, Bearings, etc. - Arrived
10s12p Battery - Arrived (needs to be wired still)
5A charger w/ waterproof charging port - Arrived
Dual Focboxes - Arrived (from @Jreamer)
Handle - Arrived
Waterproof Focbox Case - Arrived
Mini Remote - Arrived (from @JLabs)
Misc. Items (Voltage meter, solder, xt60s, etc.) - Arrived
Trailer Hitch - Arrived (From @Wanderer)
Trailer - Built 
Focbox Heatsink - In progress (Will be ordered soon from @JLabs)
Bluetooth Module - In progress (Will be ordered soon from @JLabs) 
Motor Pulleys (11T?) - In progress (from @mmaner) 
Wheel Pulleys - Will be 3D printed
Motor Mounts for ATS Trucks - On the way (from @idea)
Motors - In Progress (maybe @mmaner or @psychotiller)

Pictures so far:

Trailer Hitch:

I'm also considering adding a step down to usb for phone charging... anyone see a reason why that would be a bad idea?

Any other questions or advice are welcome! 

Shoutout to others that have contributed to the knowledge that allowed me to get here:
@treenutter
@Namasaki  
@psychotiller
@Maxid
+many more

Also this thing needs a name... help?

Nice , naming wise let me take a crack ? 

I’m getting Panda vibes from this almost with the White body and black bindings , maybe something relating to Pandas ?

Thanks for the suggestion! Pandas... I'll think about possible names along those lines

@Trdolan03 I got it from @Wanderer, I believe he built it for his own board and didn't get around to using it.

@mynamesmatt thanks for the info! That's exactly the process that I plan to use.

Looks like a pretty good start! My only concern is the 11t motor pulley. I’m thinking it’s a little small and will result in belt skipping. 

*shameless plug, but I think some black bkb motors would look great off the rear :wink:

Could you just confirm the mechanics of it? There is a ball joint that swivels left and right. Any fluctuation up and down? Would love to see your trailer once you get it done.

I've been doing some cable work:
![IMG_2194|375x500](upload://aKlahjghAP3XJbu7OUVSbOgkFu9.JPG)

Pretty proud of the charger portion... it's a two pin waterproof port capable of the 5A I'll be putting through it. It's also impossible to plug in backwards - an added bonus.
![IMG_2195|666x500](upload://ayvwXLyp8M8zgtjzKy42aJ0nx3Y.JPG)!![IMG_2196|375x500](upload://7IUWnlgpbD4P1Nyz0Ch551cqgtt.JPG)

I've also taken the liberty of adding a standard laptop port to the end instead of direct connections, so that I can unplug and use another 10s charger if need be without issues:
![IMG_2197|375x500](upload://UC9LK0rW7WjRemcKsWMjd4F1kF.JPG)
![IMG_2198|375x500](upload://pvdct7Z4Uq8H9XXK7Bg57eDQ1Vq.JPG)
All hot glue is just a precaution, everything has been properly done and heat-shrunk as always

One more thing...
I've been setting up the FOCBOX case and making sure all wires are put in the right place. Would anyone mind double checking this for me? I've never used dual drive, sensor motors, or FOCBOXs before and I am in no mood to make costly mistakes.

I'll also need help setting up everything with VESC tool in dual drive (again, I have no idea how the master/slave settings work bc I've only ever used single drive), but that'll come later. I'm sure @GrecoMan will welcome the opportunity to see me back in noob-land again :confused:

It’s a bunch of 10s2p LG packs wired together for 10s12p. They’re all over eBay, usually go for around 50$-60$/unit now. They discharge about 20A each so if you buy them make sure to wire a few in parallel for enough amps. Use links through this forum if you want genuine cells.

Here’s real progress:

Got the cutouts in the enclosure done. Pictures are of off, charging, and on position. I decided that having the easy access port on the side and a retractable USB port was more important than 100% waterproofing, and the pictures and cutouts reflect that. Thanks to @mmaner for the 3d print file to hold the xt90, and no thanks to my school’s shitty 3d printer for making me spend 30 minutes carefully sanding it down to make the connector fit.

Got it slow charging at 1.2 amps right now to make sure everything is good before running it for real. It’ll be the 5 amp charger next time. Glad I made that easy laptop port, took all of 2 seconds to go from the 5 amp to 1.2 amp keeping the same waterproof connection.

Of all things in life that agree with me, computers never seem to be one of them. Tonight I booted up VESC tool and got working on the master focbox. I figured I would unplug the CANBUS cable for now, and get one focbox and motor working before moving on to the slave. Everything went right (connection, detection, master designation, PPM) until I did motor settings and wrote it to the focbox. For some reason, when I pull the throttle, the motor just sits and shakes itself with increasing violence until I let the throttle back to zero. The best explanation I can think of is that the focbox is out of wack with the hall sensors, because I triple checked everything else. Anyone mind telling me if my analysis is correct? I just took the default settings at face value since I have no idea what they meant, which is my best guess for the results.

there the hall sensors should be set right, than apply and your issue should be gone.

Bump the duty cycle from .05 to .10 and then re-run BLDC detection.  This has worked for me in the past.  It typically means the belt tension is high or that something is obstructing free movement of the motor.  That's not necessarily a bad thing as some motors have more powerful magnetic resistance than others.

Thanks to everybody, I got it working :smile:  Both motors are spinning, now the only thing left is to figure out the goddamn belts. I haven't ordered them yet because all of the calculators don't allow 11:72 as input values for the HTD5 pulleys. Center distance is 97mm... I'd be open to any help with formulas or calculations that can help me figure this out. I want to get riding!!!

In combination with this
![image|230x500](upload://xf0eMH2pJF1HM3gIkkMBkwp7S2t.jpeg) 

But you need to measure your 11th pulley diameter. It’s unfortunately not in the tabel.

Or just install everything than lay a line around and measure after the length of the line

---
## \#56 Posted by: anorak234 Posted at: 2018-09-22T22:51:29.522Z Reads: 239

```
That depended on the hover board pack - those packs were largely knock-off cells and the design of the hover board put the motors right next to the battery, causing thermal runaway more often than BMS failure. The packs that I’ve purchased claim to be LG and Samsung packs with BMSs that work well, and in my experience they’ve performed as such.

Just in case something happens, I’ve kept a fire extinguisher in my bedroom since the first time I charged these things but nothing’s ever happened.

Ok so while the belts are still on there way and while I'm too lazy right now to go to the garage to take pictures...

I've been thinking of finding a way to attach small wheels to the back of my @Idea mounting cage because I have I have a kayak handle at the front and rather than carrying it I would really love to be able to just grab the handle and have it be pulled with those wheels. Anyone care to share some simple suggestions?

With that drive properly aligned on a 12s8p pack you should be getting crazy range. What cells/battery are you using? If it's low quality the range is likely bc of a broken joint somewhere in the parallel groups.

Today was going to be a great day... I was going to come home at about 6:00ish after 10 hours of school, open my belts on the counter, put them on the board, and go for a ride (and take those pictures that I've been promising everyone). Unfortunately, the day did not turn out as planned because I messed up my measurements and 420mm is too long - I needed 415mm belts. They have been ordered and will arrive on Thursday. In the meantime - anyone want 420-5M-15 belts? Free + shipping.

@anorak234  Just so you know, I figured out the range issue. I pumped up my tire to 50psi from the 35psi they were at and got to 31 mile range which seems to be about right. Your energy consumption should be around 28wh/mi on a dual setup not 18 FYI.
Edit: I believe that efficiency is normally set around 85% for our motors and setup.

Sounds like sound logic. My pack is only about 100wh less than yours so if you do the math your should get about 1/9 more range than me.

I got impatient waiting for belts and managed to figure out some temporary tensioners... went for a quick run up and down my driveway. The belts are still too long, tensioners make it rideable but braking is an immediate shredder. Anyways... for anyone wondering how to use tensioners with the older models of @Idea mounts:

Unfortunately the bolts aren’t really long enough... I’ll see what I can do. 

My shorter belts arrived tonight!! I was so excited that I put them on and took a ride without lights - this led to my first fall **ever** off of an esk8 when I hit a root off-road. Note to self: don’t be a dumbf*ck and ride off-road no lights at night with no elbow or knee padding. Luckily it was only my shin that got scraped up, and the board is totally fine. I also adjusted the mounts upwards for more clearance. 

This board is amazing, pretty much everything I ever dreamed of in an off-road vehicle. The only thing I’m a bit pissed about is the bushings - they suck. @Alphamail I know you said it’s hard to find good bushings for these because of the baseplate but anything you can recommend to help the situation would be highly appreciated - right now bushings are super tight and I still get wobble at 20mph. 

Tomorrow the caster wheels go on - this should be fun.

OK, those will take Street height on top (.5") and Regular longboard on bottom (.6").  So for the top you can likely fit a StreetCone, StreetBarrel, StreetFatCone and possibly a StreetChubby.  On the bottom, you can fit a Cone, Barrel and Canon.  The recessed base plate makes it difficult to fit a FatCone or Chubby in that position unless you use the washer we send with the larger diameters to bridge the recess whereas you could use Street height both top and bottom.  Do you live in the USA?

Just got back from a range test - looks like I’ll get about 35 miles of range the way I’m running it now, that’s not bad but I think I can improve it with more tire inflation and some tensioner adjustments. I LOVE this thing in every way - only problem is the low speed wobbles. They’re weird, something I’m not used to weighing just about 160 so it’s news to me that this could happen with 95A bushings. Anyways - pictures! I also figured out that I could mount and charge a GoPro while riding!!

Bushing testing has been incredibly successful. With a new combination of a 97.5a Chubby boardside over 97.5a ShortStreet roadside in the back and 95a Magnum over 97.5a ShortStreet roadside on the front, this thing now carves just as much as I want it to, without any speed wobbles whatsoever. It’s truly incredible to be able to gun the remote and know that what’s moving me is bulletproof. For anyone with ATS trucks, I can’t recommend this upgrade enough. PM me or @Alphamail if you want alternate bushing setups that will also perform well with a similar setup.

Here are pictures of the new bushing setup and my stickerbombed enclosure.

Big shoutout to @Alphamail for hooking me up with these amazing bushings and helping with getting the right combination for my needs. I highly recommend riptide bushings for fine-tuning setups and I’m honestly wishing that I had started making this kind of upgrade on other boards long ago. Anyways, glad I have the performance setup that I have now, and hopefully everyone will see me riding around San Francisco soon!

:joy:
Not that much, just a couple of popped or sliced tires but many flats. I HATE FLATS!
I had a puncture every second or third ride and once twice a day just riding on concrete. I fixed my 8 tubes with bicycle repair kit, some of them had several punctures.

The solution is tire sealant for bicycle tubes, the famous green slime as @Trdolan03 mentioned. Within the last months (at least 500 miles) I had no puncture but last week was the first and it happened far away from home. However with tire sealant it's 98-99% flat proof. If you counter balance your wheels do it before adding tire sealant.

About tires, @anorak234 your tires look short lasting and the pattern is more for offroad and not much rubber, but you found out yourself  :wink: If you ride on concrete as well you could try something like MBS Vine or the thick ones from aliexpress.

My first set of Trampa Treads in hard compound lasted about 400 miles (swapping front and rear tires after 200m), my second set not more than 150-180 miles because of sliding. 

Since 250 miles I use MBS Vine (without swapping front/rear) and I do slide on concrete or gravel and they hold up well, maybe in 150m I have to change the rear ones. They have a bit less traction on e.g. gravel but run much smoother on concrete.

If you want everlasting tires then this could be an option

Damn bro, what the heck. That’s a huge hole. @anorak234

I can let you borrow my gummies, you can do science. I know gummies work on evolve hubs but that doesn’t help since they are 8mm axel. 

@rich I’m going to get some green go and some pnuematics myself. Very good information!

I might... just wanted to make sure nobody else here is selling some. Honestly after the whole VESC6 debacle I'm skeptical of buying from trampa. Might try for some Abec 107s too although that would mean having to get new adapters and pulleys. Either way I intend to show up to another ride ASAP

I just can't justify spending another 30-40$ just to get the right bearings. Does anybody know a place where I can find 9.525-28mm bearings for a non-stupid-expensive price?

They are made from hand formulated PU and are hand poured. This is a very special material! Some air bubbles on the inside can't be avoided. This is the area where the mould prevents the bubbles to flow further up. It's only on the very surface and once mounted you will not see this anyway. Technically there is no issue. If we would want to strip out this optical issue, we would need to take standard urethane, which doesn't perform half as good.

This might be obvious but it looks like your can moved away a lot. Also for pulley, heat it with torch or use a 100w soldering iron, tin the pulley and heat it up. Or just bring the motor to the stove and heat it

Look at the set screws at the back of the motor, the ones that hold the can to the axle, loose them and put them can back in position, put thread lock before screwing back

if your pulley is not fitting you can use a fine sand paper on the axle

Ok so I tried using both a soldering iron and a torch but those pulleys really don't want to come off, which makes it hard to inspect the motor with issues. The shaft stays attached to the can, however the can and shaft keep moving out with the C clip. From comparing the motors, I can tell that the C clip on the motor with the can moving is moving along the metal and is bent out wider than the motor that works correctly. I can't seem to put it back in its place without taking off the motor, which brings me back to the first problem of not being able to take the pulleys off.

## \#176 Posted by: Mobutusan Posted at: 2018-11-18T11:02:18.394Z Reads: 131

I'm guessing your shifting motor can might be due to the combination of the high torque of the 11t pulley and how far out is mounted on the shaft. It could also be possible that using single bearing width idlers with much wider belts might be adding extra axial loads on the motor shaft. But if it only happens on one side, maybe there is a slight misalignment of the motor mount on one side. But these are just my theories based on your photos and description. I have those @idea mounts to and they seem really solid, so if there is an alignment issue, I think something would have to be bent or possibly the truck mount clamps are mounted unevenly.

And for removing the pulley, you could remove the set screws, heat the pulleys with a torch, and ride it till they let loose and start spinning on their own.
```

This could be the culprit. Trying to squeeze the mounts/clamps between the brake mounting holes on the trucks might be creating a slight misalignment of one of the motor mounting plates. I had to file those back a bit to get proper clamp alignment on a set of MBS trucks I have. Those MBS skate trucks do have a weird shape/profile too.

Thanks for the suggestions. I’ve ordered a pulley removal tool that should arrive this week, hoping that’ll be enough to get the pulleys off since the torch didn’t work yesterday when I tried it.

I’m really thinking this is just a case of the C clip popping out of place since that’s what appears to keep moving

@JLabs it appears the C clip was not compressed all the way around the shaft and therefore got out of its notch when stressed in one direction and moved its way up, allowing the can to move back and forth bc of the gap between the C clip and the motor cap plate. One I took the motor off, all it needed was a pair of needle nose pliers to push it back into the notch and compress it back around the shaft. Works like a charm!


(Before work, when C clip was stretched and too far up the shaft)

Got the 15T pulleys on there now, gives me enough speed to be happy. This board is such a dream, really what I’ve been looking for in a performance Esk8. 

I can even charge my remote off it!

I’m circling back around to this trailer, still trying to make it all work. I’m thinking of making a metal piece and clamping it to those bars - but are they durable enough to deal with the weight of the entire trailer behind?


Also the I’m allocating a lot of the space for batteries, about 2 cubic feet of 3 in the trailer. I really want to be able to ride all day, charge all night. Still deciding between Li-ion vs Lead-Acid for the batteries because of cost issues

What would the price per ah be for the two battery types? How many ah are you adding

I have no idea what it is per ah bc the cost varies so wildly depending on the battery, let alone the type. I was thinking somewhere around 100ah at 36 volts

For flat road application where I’m not drawing too many amps and then I’ll switch to my regular battery for hill climb application. I’m not sure though... with myself, the mountain board, dual drive, and the trailer I’d really like to have 60A available at all times

You could have it so those batteries are in parallel with the liion. those charge the liion but the discharge would be adequate

That’s really odd, your the only one to report such an issue. My guess is that it’s permanently loose now. Send me a pm and I will see if I can get you a new clip that’s tight

Before I got cool and made an esk8, I was modding old Schwinn and gt scooters for cruising around my neighborhood /parks with my son (bicycle trailer on back because I'm lazy and kids get bigger). I made one pack out of SLA batteries using a DPDT switch that would toggle between 2 or 3 of the batteries in series (24v or 36v speed). I made another scooter with 6 SLAs (2x 3s) and used the DPDT switch to make a second reserve battery switch. Worked a treat except the weight of the thing. It was heavier than a mini dirt bike but I could ride forever. Really hoping to do this with lithium packs soon. Keep up the good work, I'm rooting for you. Send me pics from the Appalachian trail

Great to hear someone else using Lead Acid! I’m not too concerned about the weight other than the additional strain when starting or stopping. What kind of discharge were you sporting? I can’t find any 100ah that seem to have more than 30A capability.

Did you open and close the motors? Usually circlips are not reusable, once you take them off you throw away and put a new one, they are really cheap

When I fixed it before I just tried to carefully bend it back to be tight enough around the shaft to keep everything in place, I guess it would’ve been better to replace it. This is the first time I’ve had this problem and @JLabs has been kind enough to send me a new clip so I think it’ll probably be fixed for good when I get that on.

Hey there twin.. ![20190207_122020|281x500](upload://t2sFZZtK7VMGETylk2jbTwCyKD4.jpeg)

On your setup photos, I notice you included the washer between the rear boardside street chubby and the hanger. Is this just to prevent wear?

It’s because of the weird indent in the truck base. I noticed a more stable setup with the washer, since it’s more precise than the cast metal of the truck

Hey everyone, I am looking to possibly sell this in the SF Bay Area to fund a backpacking trip that I am taking through Europe this summer. It would be sold with every part on it seen in this build thread except the trailer hitch, so the buyer knows exactly what they're getting. I've been busy with school and other things, so the board only has about 175 miles on it in total, the Trampa Gummies less than 25. 1 of the motors has an issue with the C clip, but I have a replacement that will come with the board and it's a 5 minute fix. 

Edit: I can also put a mini-remote in instead of the Hoyt Puck if you're not too keen on having a remote with my username engraved in it
