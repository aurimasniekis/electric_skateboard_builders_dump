So its about ready, my first build, coming from an exway x1 i hope to be scared! The exways let down is the silly short range, i needed more range and going on local grouprides enforced this more.
So i started reading here and what a resource! this build is 99% a forum harvest,  so thank you to all you folks.

Heres the spec..

@Hummie  deck
@bigben double stack enclosure
@3DServisas fatboy mini urethane drive 1:2.6 and 1:2.8 options, 2x fatboy 230 hangers, kegal, haggy, abec drive options
Riptide bushings
Caliber split baseplates 44 and 50 deg
12s 6p 30q pack
@hyperIon1 maytech 6374 190kv via @pjotr47
Bestech d140 charge only via @bigben 
Glass frit grip.
@riverside.rider haggy nummies 
@torqueboards tb110 (when they arrive)
 Unity (on the way)
@akhlut s awsome x things

Thanks all for your kind comments :slight_smile:

I still have a way to go and a mental list of things to do.

Fit and setup unity (the most daunting bit as i have no idea what settings to use)

Fit underglow leds

Buy 3d printer and learn how to use it.

Design and print front and rear lights.

Decide on and get some full face protection.

This thing is great, one of the fewer hummie options with geardrive and even front mounted! How is the clearance in the back? Any room for bigger motors?
```

## \#16 Posted by: Mudders Posted at: 2019-03-22T08:13:17.658Z Reads: 191

Its tight! Maybe 3mm clearance between hanger and can. I also removed around 10mm from the deck to give room for the geardrive casing when leaning.

For a first battery that's a üçë 

It should be harder to blow a unity over an older design, you'll enjoy the rabbit hole of 3d printing no doubt

I've bench blown (once actually explosive) a few of the 4.12 and a focbox or two, the common problems seem to be eliminated, going from the build pics and detail above I don't see an expensive failure in your future 

This is how sturdy they are apparently

Get safety gear, helmet is a must but the rest too depending on skate/rider/surface/conditions etc

Esk8 is as dangerous as any motorcycle despite the speed differences

I have a thousand helmet already, but ill deffo be getting a fullface, knee, elbow, wrist and hand protection, twice as my 16yo loves skating too. 

We were looking at options, he wants a icon airflite helmet (coz of the looks) but i think we will both end up with a pass each :-)

Give Fusion 360 a try. There are a few ways to sign up and get it for free. I came from AutoCAD back in the day and it was an easy transition, but the UI is simple enough for a complete newbie and flexible enough to allow you to learn and improve a great deal as you get more and more used to it.

If you want really simple CAD to get your feet wet with, I like tinkercad. I end up using it for something like 80% of my functional 3d prints

Nice job on the Hummie deck, your selection of components is to die for.

Color scheme excellent. First build...well done Mudders.

I hope you scare the shit out of yourself safely :sunglasses:

I did my first print, @mmaners xt90 loop key holder, turned out ok but the amass xt90 is very loose and the sides are very differing thickness, i guess i have some calibration to sort :frowning:

Focbox in and calibrated, i had to update the firmware before it would let me complete the guided set up, no drama.

Just waiting for a couple of prints and shes good to kill me tomorrow, im planning on getting acquainted slowly at first incase she gets angry with me for some reason.

Roll on tomorrow :-)

I couldnt wait, took her round the block for a cheeky test ride, omg this thing is awsome. The torque is nice and sedate at very low speeds, sometimes judders a bit, but wgen she builds speed to around 15mph its like it hits a power band! 
Im not sure ill ever see the top speed achievable but my god its fun!

Only issue i have (and i know its early days) but she gets a bit of a wobble on around 25mph, i guess ill have to play with the bushing compression to get her dialled in :slight_smile:

You could try to de-wedge the rear to take out some steer. That might cure your wobble. At this point, it could just be your nerves? No? :thinking:

Unity set up.

I have gone with the stock settings when setting the unity up, given my board set up is there a setting i can safely change for a bit more poke from start and at low speed?? Currently it kinda hits a power band at circa 15mph!

You can increase motor amps max, up to maybe 120a. But that gearing with that kv with that size wheel is gonna be high speed low torque.

Beauutiful build, thanks for posting. You're not giving yourself much room for #2!

I have been playing with tinkercad (thanks for the tip @olestra ;-) )

I have this xlite 100 which i quite like

![20190409_211702|243x500](upload://l5do3iCQO1lCHER3xeRbS9oqvIT.jpeg) 

It nearly fits in the socket but the 3d printed cable riser is a slight obstruction

![20190409_211840|690x335](upload://5oxed2iKP78SMwzdqWnXEQxZiyC.jpeg) 

So i wanted to make my own riser to house the light but retain the cable guides

![20190409_212310|690x335](upload://1aQ5f7SZdIYF9uLRWgwTZv3kftK.jpeg) 

Printed at 100% infill for strength in pla for now untill i can get some petg for the working version

So pretty much wrapping this up, the board runs great, black filament arrived and the riser was printed and fitted,  no drama there. 
Also the TB110 wheels arrived, these were part of my original plan for this board, and i love em with this drive train.
