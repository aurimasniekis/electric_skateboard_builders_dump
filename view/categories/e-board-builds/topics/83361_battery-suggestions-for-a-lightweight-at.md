Ok hear me out. 

I'm planning to have a lightweight AT built with @nuttyjeff's gear drive with the Haggy trucks and pneumatic wheels. The goal is to have a total weight of under 10 kilos or so. Here are my potential parts

Deck : Landyachtz Falcon  36 
Trucks : Kahua trucks 
Wheels : Haggy pneumatic wheels
Drive train : Avio AT gear drive 
ESC : Unity
Motors : Dual 6374s, 190kv 

Now comes the battery, I made this thread because I can't decide on which battery cells to use. Since its going to be light, I'm thinking of a 12s3p. 30Q might be underwhelming so i read around and found that 30T and other cells would be better for a smaller pack. Still, I can't decide. It needs to have enough power for a pneumatic for occasional offroad and a range of perhaps 40km or so. Any battery cell recommendations?! ðŸ¤”

40km AT and light weight?
Following this!
How much is your build weight without battery?

Crap that's a good question. I have no numbers yet as i've yet to get the deck. If i remember, the Bergmeister wheels are lighter than an abec 107, at around 300+g each, so about 1.2kg for the wheels. Maybe @nuttyjeff can chime in on the weight of the gear drive and the trucks.

Im not sure how heavy the falcon weighs, but the drive weight with wheels and dual 6355s will be around 3.5kg, give or take.

The Falcon with an eboosted enclosure will be about 2.5kg, depending on whether you decide to add 47.52kg of fibreglass filler...

Front trucks and wheels... Another 1.5kg..?

I'd say you have about 1.5kg for the battery, or even 1kg if you're REALLY strict about the 10kg weight limit.

1kg for the battery is not that much.
That would be 20 18650s or 14 30T cells.

By the way 30T are also just 3Ah so with a 12s3p not really possible to get 40km range.

Actually, @Linny is relatively light and doesn't ride particularly fast ... on his Titan build, a 12s5p 30Q pack on 6.5in AT wheels with a belt drive got him quite abit of range, around 60 to 70km IIRC? 

a 10S4P gets him 70km of range on his urethane gear drive build lol.

[/quote]

Yeah, range heavily depends so many factors (weight, riding style, terrain, temperature etc etc.), it's hard to give an estimate for a given battery pack. My 12s4p 30q gets me 40km with my bergy wheels!

I've seen really light people get 40km on a 9s2p LgHe4 pack with a urethane gear drive too!

ðŸ˜… those are urethane wheel numbers whiles easy carving ðŸ˜… 
If that is his range than he also donâ€™t need crazy discharge cells...
12s3p 30q or maybe vtc6 if he has the money and good.

What cells? Honestly I find that really low mileage for this amount of cells. Maybe something is wrong with your setup.
I get 30km riding hills, most of the time going fast. 2x 6355 maytechs (soon to be 6374), focboxes, 12mm belts. I weigh 78kg so maybe 90kg with gear and pack.

Nothing wrong with the pack vesc app shows about 24-25ah drawn at 30v total 26 ah 

The way I ride draws a ton of amps plus I weigh 100+ kilos fully geared up with backpack full of tools and other stuff. 

I only get 15-20km on my raptor 2 anyways

Okay deffo no more enclosure filling. Assuming i get Eboosted's enclosure with the Falcon,
1.5kg for the battery....

The 10kg weight limit isn't a must, if it's 11 or so its fine. The thing is my [Kushboard Titan](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mini-at-build-the-kushboard-titan-34-jet-spud-dual-6380-170kv-12s5p-30q-trampa-parts-focbox-unity/63724/50) weighs 14kg, with dual 6380s, big ass Trampa Infinity trucks, and the 35 deg angled riser which adds a lot. 

10kg should be doable.

Cus of this thread 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/samsung-30t-now-in-stock/66102

I could consider Vtc 6.. A friend had a battery upgrade for his evolve with a 10s5p of Vtc 8. But currently I'm bending towards 30T cus of it being better than 30Q

Sometimes itâ€™s good to make a bit your own research.
Without to say the 30T isnâ€™t a good cell.
I was nice and made a small write up.
Prices based on ru.nkon.nl

![image|375x500](upload://gUgAMBhVDRDE6iR7uhXGzrtsmUl.jpeg) 

So if I look at this, with 30T cells I have a more heavy, more expensive and less discharge pack than if I would use vtc5a and add just one p more ðŸ¤”
Oh i forgot to calculate the total wh of the packs ... ðŸ¤” anyway vtc5a pack would win there too....

I think the 30T would be good if you have not enough space, but if weight is your only concern I would rather go with the vtc5a.

Please donâ€™t forget the A... there is a difference between vtc5 and vtc5a ðŸ˜‰
```

---
## \#25 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2019-02-07T19:54:48.604Z Reads: 80

```
Vtc5a are not good for 35A of discharge at all, those are 25A tops and even so the Temps rose to 83C.

So you need to make the calculation again. 

Vtc5a
25A x 4 = 100A
Maximum width for 8 cells = 148mm

30T
35A x 3 = 105A
Maximum width for 6 cells = 126mm

Conclusion:
If you want a small width pack with plenty of discharge capacity go 12S3P
If you want a cheaper pack 12s4p of Vtc5a
If you have a big deck and want a really high discharge pack go 12s4p of 30T

40T has more capacity than 30Q, and comes double the price per cell :disappointed_relieved:
Hmm, i guess it comes down to if i want to spend that extra to save weight. 

I'll either go with these configurations,
12s3p 30Q
12s2p 40T
12s3p 30T?

## \#29 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2019-02-08T05:09:17.341Z Reads: 64

The 40T it's a low discharge cell for a 21700, they are rated at 30A of maximum discharge but they were recommended by Mooch to be discharged at only 25A, the only good thing about the 40Ts are the capacity, 4000mAh instead of 3000mAh of the 30T.

However, in this hobby most of us are looking for the highest discharge possible, some others for the highest range, so there is a battery type for everyone

Didn't realize the 25a 'limit'! Cool information, thanks! 

What are your thoughts about the 50E in a 12s6p config? I mean 30a each wheel isn't a lot....but will it be enough to get me that stupid crazy range I want? I hope ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¤·

With 5000mAh the 50E might be a nice cell for range but a really lame one for discharge, on a 12s6p you will have 58.8A only which is ridiculous, you will have to set your VESCs at 25A for each motor, I don't know who would sacrifice such a huge battery pack and weight for such a slow board just to get only more range.

my setup is bergmeister, 12s4p 30Q, motor mounts with dual idlers, my weight is 80kg. dual 6374, each motor 80A max. I get barely 25 km. EDIT: bergmeister each on 4,2 bar
okay I'm riding at below zero C temperatures, but other than that, is it possible that idlers take so much from range?
what are your setting and how heavy are you?

Idlers do not affect range that much. I guess the difference is that Jeff is on a gear drive hence the increase in efficiency

12s3p
[/quote]

Heck, 30T are 3000mah no? A 12s3p of 30q cells I am making is estimated to be 390Wh, that will give me a max range of about 35km and I weigh 60kg.  With pneumatics I can't see you getting for than 25km.

@Idea might be able to give some insight into the efficiency of gear drives though as he has been getting some crazy range

What about droping the 6374s for 6355s? That will save you around 300-500 grams depending on the motors. 

At your weight and 4p or less, there will be minimal real world difference.

All you guys seem to be running low PSI on your pnuemetics.

I run 90psi on trampa urban treads and get 45km range on medium pace with a 10s4p panasonic pf (2900 mah 10A disharge) batteries. Running from 4.2v to 2.9v cutoff.

Correct, it's 3000mah, the same with 30Q.

I think I'll go with a 12s3p 30Q pack. It's the most worth for it's price compared to the rest. 40T would be ideal but it's double the price so screw it :rofl:

Your low range comes probably from the low temperatures. You can expect at best  ~80% availabe capacity at -10Â°C even with low discharge rates on Li-Ion (0.25C). 
The effect is even stronger on higher discharge levels and the cycle life is also lower than operating at 10-25Â°C.

It's also more likely to damage cells with high discharge on very low temperatures because you can't no longer apply the same surface temperature to internal temperature correlation, the heat up is way to delayed at the surface.

To improve your range I would recommend to store your board/battery at 10-20Â°C and insulate it's housing.

BTW I wouldn't really recommend to hassle with charging Li-Ion on low temperatures ~ -10Â°C (safety and cell life time) even slowly. It's worth to just store them maybe 1h or 2h at comfortable temperatures and then start to charge.

thanks for your answer!
board is at room temperature most of the time, and I'm waiting some time after riding before I put it on charger. I usually charge before ride. 
Also, my battery is isolated with foam around all sides, and temperature is rarely lower than -5 degree C.
Maybe my riding style is to blame, maybe I should try to discharge battery to 3.0v to get exact range (with bergmeister setup I never went lower than 30% battery, so my 25km range is estimate.) still, same setup, evolve 7 inch tires, I got 20.5km range with 5% battery left. temp was around +10 degrees C outside

Well I guess you already try your best regarding storage and and charging, it's really unfortunate that most (at least usefulI) battery chemestries really don't work to well with low temperatures.
There are some exotic battery types like solid state ones that can deal with such stuff but they are low capacity, more or less not available (except a few sampleshere and there), expensive and cant't deliver high currents.

I think this limit is more suggested for the use case he rates battery, vaping will put that full load on the battery lot of times in sequence

On a board most of the times it will pull the full current for a few seconds and then drop down a lot for awhile

The datasheet says 45A with a 80Â°C, of course the cycle life would be bad an this conditions, but I bet in most riding the 45A would only happen in brief moments 

At 30A the sag is not that big
