I’ve been checking out the awesome builds on this site and recently built my first board. I’ve built a few boards after this one to test different configurations and see how well some cheaper parts work. I’ll try to post more about my other builds soon. I also got an Acton Blink S2 that I’ll post about.

I’m generally trying to find ways to make boards with the best value that are not difficult to build. It would be great to hear suggestions and feedback.

The video turned out longer than I planned so I included a table of contents in the description.
