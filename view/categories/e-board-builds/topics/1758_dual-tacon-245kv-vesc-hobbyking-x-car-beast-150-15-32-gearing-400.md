I've finally decided to create my own build after looking at all of yours. For my motor im considering going with either a tacon or 260kv sk3.(trying to run dual rear). My esc will be either a vesc or hobbyking x car beast 150. I decided to go with a 15/32 5mm pitch gearing ratio, and i have caliber trucks with 83mm clone flywheels to go with my 37 inch bamboo deck. Im trying to keep the cost low so around 400 dollars can't really afford to make any errors with money being tight.  Could really use input on parts chosen. Btw im in california and its basically all uphills and downhills where I live.

I tried to make your title a bit nicer. Change anything else if you want to.

Dual Tacon BF 245's won't fit as a dual rear setup on caliber trucks (unless you plan on doing a dual diagonal setup).  You'll need at least 195mm trucks. I plan on doing a build with dual Tacon BF 245's as well. @psychotiller recommends randal clones. That's what I plan to get, just waiting for @psychotiller to having randal clamps for his motor mounts.

@willpark16 to keep costs down you should attempt a single motor build to begin with. Dual drive means two escs, two motors, more battery power, and two drivetrain kits. For $400, you're better off with a single motor.  I suggest a VESC, the Tacon motor or SK3, and the biggest gearing ratio you can get (3:1) is common.

I don't know what you weigh but you should consider a 15/36 or 14/36 because of your hilly area.  Unless you're looking for some ridiculous top speed.  With 14/36 20+ mph is easy.

Just my $.02 worth, don't spend it all in one place.

You would make/buy an adapter so two balance leads go into the bms. Because you would have two packs in series.

Well, I'm pretty confident that's how you do it. Check with @psychotiller he knows how to wire balance leads together. You would also have to solder the discharge leads on.

If its your first build and you you're not too familiar with wiring get a single 6s battery and an external charger.

I was considering going with the 106b but the b6 compact is kind appealing because of its plug and play like design

My advice: because I was going the same exact path at first. Dual requires more maintenance with the belts and ESC and batteries, plus more soldering and wire/enclosure management at the start. I listened to some people here who say that a single with a big belt is enough power. Choose a good ESC (VEC) and a big 6374 motor running on 11-12S for the most efficient single. Maybe a 12-15mm belt. Dual is for acceleration on flat and hilly ground. Save the money.

Would you say 260 or 245 for a hilly area

They are quite expensive unless you want to go $80+

Is there a particular reason why you want to go with a 7s lipo?  Most people on here either go with 6s, 8s (two 4s in series), 10s (two 5s in series), or 12s (two 6s in series) all of which can be charged with a normal 6s lipo charger using a parallel charging board.

You're better off.  You would have spent more money over all having to buy a high s count charger.

I don't have any experience with the imax, but I've heard nothing but good things about them on this forum from people like @trbt555. I actually ordered one from GearBest.com yesterday since they have free shipping and hobbyking's international shipping has increased significantly since the last time I ordered from their international warehouse (at least of what I remember).  I guess I'll have my own opinion once I receive it and start using it.
