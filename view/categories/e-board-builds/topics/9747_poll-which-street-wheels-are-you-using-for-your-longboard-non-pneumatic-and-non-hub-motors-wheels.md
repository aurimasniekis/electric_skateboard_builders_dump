I think 90 is my favorite even though I've never used it. 83 feels too small for me and 97s are a bit big. I have a feeling I'd love 90s. If someone made an Evolve gt style wheel in 90mm I'd buy it instantly.

i only have the enertion 83mm 78a and i want to change to improve speed and smoothness.

my problems are:
- the streets in my town have some cracks.
- in a normal street i feel a lot the vibration in my legs.


1- choosing the abec's 83mm is enough to go smooth or is better to get a bigger wheel?

2- why do you prefer evolve gt wheels over abecs ?

3- there is a really big difference between abecs and other brands?

4- anyone knows why abecs 97mm are out of stock in europe?

thanks

1. getting real abecs would be better, i hear the enertion ones are harder than advertised.

2. contact patch is 54mm (same as kegels) with a flat profile.

3. Authentic abecs are pretty high quality.

4.¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

1. go softer for more smoothness and bigger for bigger cracks
2. many people don't like the abecs11 green color
3. abec have nicer urethan and softness up to 75a
4. this are the abec11 wheels for 2016, older version (like 97mm in 75a) are out of stock and will never come back :frowning:  http://www.abec11.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Abec11-Summer2016-LRG.jpg
Many Evolver go for abec11s, maybe they bought all of them...

I have Enertion 83mm wheels and Orangatang Kegel 80mm. They are both nice wheels but the Orangatang's are much nicer because they feel smooth and much carvier than Enertion's. A good way to test for me was the rebound of the wheels. The Kegels bounced high and Enertion's didn't bounce at all. This is probably the hardness of the wheel. I think 90mm would be nicer than 83 because a higher speed and better for not getting stuck on things,
