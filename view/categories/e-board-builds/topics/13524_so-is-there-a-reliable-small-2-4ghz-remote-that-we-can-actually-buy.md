Everybody have had problems with the Winning remote, the Nano remote and all sort of bluetooth remotes cutting out, some even set their phones in Airplane Mode to run their boards, that's crazy!

What would be the most reliable one besides the big GT2B?

The remote + receiver combo is sold out at the moment though. Miami electric boards should have some stock however.

Just as @rodriguejoe1 said. Get a hold of @FLATLINEcustoms customs for a complete. He's really quick and does a great job! It's the most reliably remote I've had. Haven't had one cut out or issue and I live right in the middle of a big city. 

This is the one he made for me. I love it!

_Quote from @FLATLINEcustoms _
"The Mad Munkey v1 Complete is $100 without the LED battery gauge and $105 with it. The Complete includes $32 dollar Mad Munkey enclosure, the $30 GT2b to install into it, $30 Installation and a free lanyard with $8 for shipping. The $5 extra bucks gets you a LED that shows the battery life that uses such a small amount of power it is always on."

It's really not that much when You add up the remote cost, then the 3d printed mod, ect... It will also be safe!!!

I actually ordered from them over a month and a half ago.  Never got a valid tracking number or product or my money back. I contacted them and they told me to wait until after the return claim period was over to contact them, I never got the controller, contacted ali express and they assured me I would be copied on an email between them and the vendor and I didnt receive that either, tried going through them again once after that again and nothing. They never contacted me back or issued a refund. Went to my bank and explained to them what happened and they refunded me instead and started an inquiry with Ali express on my behalf. Today they contact me for the first time in almost 3 weeks once they got their money taken away from them. 

I dont know how your experience was, this may have been an outlier but it was absolute shit.

I got a tracking number, actually 2, they were both invalid. I went back and forth with Aliexpress for a week with waiting times and using their convo option for customer service and I got no where so I just got fed up, went straight to the bank instead. They seamed very understanding.  Again, this may be a one in a thousand type of deal but now they have to deal with my bank instead of me.

Yea, that's why I throw everything on my credit card, if there are any problems, super easy to get my money back by filing a claim. Both my tracking #'s seem to valid and they just made it in the states yesterday.

So 3 full weeks after they said it would be delivered it finally came in.  Just wanted to confirm I did get the product all be it much later than they had said I would.  Looks good,  have to charge up the remote and pair them once I get the board battery back up and running.

Ordering stuff from China can be a real pain sometimes. The cheap shipping they use often has horrible tracking. Glad you got your remote though!

This is why I've tried stating I feel like this is probably just a one time experience.  I placed my order back on October the 7th and it was supposed to be here by Nov 6th at the absolute latest.  According to the shipping information provided with regards to shipping date and what not. 

I know others have delt with them before it was kinda just the false tracking information,  not just once but twice once they said they fixed it,  and the delivery deadline about to passed and no information with regards to where the package was that I decided to just put in a dispute because if i didnt then should it never end up arriving then I'm out 50 bucks and nothing to do about it,  you know what mean?  Just didn't think it would turn into such a hectic experience afterwards but I just wanted to post that it did arrive,  don't want to discourage others from trying their product because of one bad experience.  Their product looks really solid and  I'm excited to try it

the 2.4Ghz mini remote (found a long time ago by @torqueboards ) is by far the best - its sturdy, small, batteries last forever and most importantly: of all remotes I tried, its the ONLY one that works reliably through carbon where all others had reception issues!

Lots of devices are on the 2.4ghz spectrum (radios, wifi, microwaves, and plenty of other things). Maybe someone will come out with a 5ghz soon :)

My recommendation above is what I've used for a while now and it's never failed me. I've used the batter for weeks without recharging as well.
