This is my first build and I wanna say thanks for the all of info people have posted.  This is very helpful.  This all started with a an Altered Fantom 1.0 I bought for my son.  He wasnt crazy about it, so I started playing around with it.  I haven't been on a skateboard in close to 20 years, so I had fun...but not ENOUGH fun, so I started looking for mods.  

The only thing I've done is bypass the breaker (14amp WTF!) so it wouldn't quit every 2 mins.  Other than that, it would essentially require a new motor, esc, gears, etc.  Didn't seem like a really good path to go down.  Now I'm doing a custom build.  I have made some of the purchases allready, but some are still to come.  The deck is usable, with the trucks, wheels,motor mount and gears installed but no electronics as of yet.  Here it is...

The idea was to build a decent warehouse crawler (10-15mph, 1 to 1.5 hour runtime) for not a lot of money.  I skimped on the trucks, mount & pulleys assuming I could replace them later with either custom or DIY gear.  I'm gonna go ahead an say the ones I got off of eBay are junk.  I'm going to use them for now, but I plan on replacing them very quickly :).

So, are there any obvious issues with the parts that I missed?  
What is the charge time going to be on the 5000mAh batteries with the parallel board?
I've see some conflicting info (at least as far as my understanding goes) about power switches.  There are anti-spark switches in use, some people are using 20amp toggles, etc.  Is it possible, recommended even, to use a 20-40 amp toggle switch?  If so, to what part are the poles connected?  After the batteries & before the ESC?

Thanks for the assistance, and good luck with your own builds.

Here are some pictures of the build in progress...

Im not crazy about the clear grip, I may replace it with black grip, cut them into strips and apply diagonally or something.

This is the chinese motor mount and gears, like I said...not great.  I had to a bit of modifying tot he trucks to make the motor mount fit.  I also drilled out the deck and truck mounting holes so I could use 3/8 in fasteners, instead of the 1/4 in that came with the trucks.  After that I sprayed the mount and trucks with multiple coats of flat black enamel.

You might have a problem with the sk3 5055(at least I had) because it has not so much power 
I mean you can ride up some decent hills but can't really start from still or ride up too steep hills

I had actually though the same thing, but I 'felt' like the 190kv would give too little top end.  Is that correct?  Is there another motor, that is available, that would be a better choice?

I don't know where you are from  but I found some quite cheap motors on eBay they are called 6364 neodym on eBay for 50-70bucks and I'm testing out mine probably next week 
But you can also check out ollinboard's motors

you'll likely have some "cogging" or stuttering when starting froma full stop regardless.  Not a huge deal if you give a kick or two it should go away.  If it doesn't then you can adjust some of the ESC settings to try to fix, or move to another motor/esc combo.

50mm motors work pretty well - i wouldn't focus on top speed so much and 280kv is a bit high IMO.  But should work.  Since you already have it - i'd use it until you know more about what you want.

In your electrical section - i don't see the programming card noted for the 120a 6s ESC?  You'll need that.  You absolutely will need to adjust the brakes and possibly other settings w/ it to get this working for you.  

Your deck has a short wheelbase - i'd consider mounting the trucks to the angled sections at each end like @RunPlayBack did - it will be a bit more "turny" w/ the additional angle, but also a lot more stable (longer wheelbase) and give you more room inbetween the trucks for electronics.  (likely around 14" WB now).

here's his build to look at and see if it inspires you:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/a2esk8-old-school-mini-cruiser-31-5-speed-demons-deck-single-carvon-v2-hub-motor-12s1p-lifepo4-vesc/6456?source_topic_id=5721

I see some links to motors - i'd double check that any motor you get is 8mm shaft vs 10mm shaft (the Neo @Nooby  ebay linked is 10mm it looks like).  Not a huge deal, except all the gears we typically use are 8mm.  Yes you can get some 10mm from APS and elsewhere - but a more limited selection or need to modify to fit.  I stick to 8mm as a result.

Can't go wrong with Ollin's - just verify the motor mount holes will fit your mount (38mm iirc).

Also recommend the common parts thread, and @onloop's build videos for some common recommendations (like gear calculators etc.)  Just take the unavoidable enertion branding (it's what he's using - it works, and obviously what he has) in stride - realizing that almost any other similar motor/mount/battery will work if specs line up.

GL!

I have that same motor and FVT ESC, and because of the sensored operation, it starts up perfectly smooth.  I don't have any hills here in south florida, but did go up a pretty steep driveway once, and it got up fine.  I have 13/36T gearing.

I figured I'd be kicking off to start anyways with a single motor build, not really one of my criteria anyways.  I just want a decent top speed and as long a battery run as I can get.  

I like the way the trucks are mounted at an angle, looks pretty mean.  

This deck has a pretty good concave shape and it isn't very flexy so I've not had any issues using it normally.  My logic was get a shorter deck for better turn-ability at low speeds, but I will confess I'm a little worried about wobble at higher speeds.  After I get the board powered and test it, I'm pretty sure Ill go back and do this or try another deck.  

Thanks for the info, very cool.

Looking at your gears wheels and motor, the speed calc i have for you shows:

83mm - 280kv - 6s - 16/48 = 19mph

that's going to be pretty screaming on a 14-16" WB short board.  You obviously can go slower, but i'd also worry about speed wobbles (depending on your skill and bushings dialed-in, etc.).

Did you get the programming card for this ESC?

So I have most of my parts in, just waiting on the charger, power supply, connectors, etc.  I have a couple of questions though.  I bought the [TorqueBoards 120A 6S ESC](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/single-motor-120a-6s-esc/) and the [Electric Skateboard Motor 5055 280KV](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-motor-5055/).  

The ESC has 5.5mm connectors (I think) and the motor has 4mm connectors.  Should I just cut and splice/solder or is there a converter cable?

The motor has a sensor wire, I don't see anywhere to connect that to the ESC, did I order the wrong parts or is this common?

This is the wiring diagram I came up with, not sure how accurate it is so any help would be appreciated.

The description of the ESC says "Sensorless or Sensored Brushless Motor" but i cannot see the input for the sensors... i think @torqueboards has to chime in here ;)

[/quote]
Best approach is to use either 4mm connectors on the ESC and motor or 5,5mm. Dont mix it. I would recommend using 4mm because it is less likely to fall apart due vibrations. So just remove the 5,5mm connectors and solder new 4mm connectors.

I believe, I have some RC standard sensor extensions. You'll have to make sure you connect it properly otherwise you can ruin your ESC.

I figured out that you need a bunch of Male/Female 4mm & 5.5mm Bullet Connectors and XT60 Connectors to put all of this together.  I dont know how I missed that :).  Anyways, those are on order, should be here Monday.

On the Power Switch issue, would something like this work?

[High Current LiPo Battery Switch With Optional T Plug/XT60/EC3 Plug](http://www.banggood.com/High-Current-LiPo-Battery-Switch-With-Optional-T-PlugXT60EC3-Plug-p-1056050.html?currency=USD&createTmp=1&utm_source=ebay&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=saul&utm_campaign=SKU385873-US&ebay)

I have this version of the build complete.  Overall, I'm pretty pleased.  

There was a lot of the wobble, so I moved the trucks to the kick-tails (thanks @sl33py).  On my next board I'll use a 37-40 inch deck.I used a Plano box for the electronics, just used a Dremel to get rid of all the compartments in the base and the lid.  

I should have gone with the 190kv motor, as Dexter suggested.  The 280 is mondo fast and the acceleration is a killer.

I'm going to change remotes, the 2.4ghz Nano Remote has very little travel so acceleration and braking takes a lot of finesse.  It works good, just not as 'easy' to use as I had hoped.  

I definitely picked the wrong trucks, next time I'll go with the Paris and weld the motor mount, or maybe the Caliber II and cut the motor mount to fit.  Anything has to be better than what I bought :).

The best advice I can give to new builders is buy at least 10 pairs of 5.5mm & 4mm bullet connectors, you will need to solder adapter cables and maybe even change some existing connectors out to make everything match.

Anyways, props to everyone on this board and Dexter at [](), great advice from everyone involved.

My ESC caught on fire, burned a hole through the deck.  So...now I'm waiting on a new deck and a new ESC.  I'll probably do a new build topic as this one will be slightly different (Aluminum Deck, Castle Mamba Monster 2, 6s, etc.).
