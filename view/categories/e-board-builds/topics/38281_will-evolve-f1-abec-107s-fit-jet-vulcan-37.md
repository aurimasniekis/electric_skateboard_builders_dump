Alrighty then, so sinnce you are from europe this goes as following.

- [Le Deck](https://www.sickboards.nl/de/jet/10690-jet-vulcan-kick-377-skateskull-deck-only.html)

- [Angled riser /recommend 5 degree](https://www.sickboards.nl/de/zubehor/1595-rayne-angled-risers.html)    /
 [normal riser / 1/4th should be ideal.](https://www.sickboards.nl/de/zubehor/103-khiro-flat-riserpads.html)

- [Trucks - depends on your mounts but caliber are solid for low price, mayby go 44 since it is your first ride and ads stability. You got the angled riser if you want it more carvy.](https://www.sickboards.nl/de/reversed-kingpin/1135-caliber-forty-four-10-achsen.html)

- [Griptape / coarse is enough for esk8, nno need to fuq up your clothes.](https://www.sickboards.nl/de/griptape/8441-mob-coarse-11-grit-50k-griptape-per-10-cm.html)

- [Mounting Hardware](https://www.sickboards.nl/de/nuts-and-bolts/667-khiro-nuts-and-bolts-flathead.html)

Now I donn't know what you ment with :" and what truck you using especially in the front with the kingpin coming up through the board looks sick". That ain't the kinnngpin, wouldnn't go 5km if it was lol. It is a longer M5 bolt with a [Barrel bushing](https://www.sickboards.nl/de/bushings/3159-fat-ant-barrel-bushings.html) a [Flat washer](https://www.sickboards.nl/de/washers/6894-atlas-trucks-washer-set.html) ont top for a "ghetto style" footstopper. 

Ps: The prices seem steep at sickboard, that is because tax and vat is included. They are super quick friendly and just onnne of the best shops in EU.

Since you asked about what risers are, mayb go on here for a guide of all the parts, their job and differennnt choices you have.

never tried em before?
is this a good  idea of how they work?  going of this pic I think wedge out in the front and a space pad in back would give me good steering and stability but I have no idea..

Honestly not suitable for esk8 that picture. Problem is that chart is wonderfull for pushing and pumping. As soon as you go over 25km/h you leave that area. 
You got 50 degree trucks. So flat riser in front. Angled riser in the back.

Bushings are catered towards your weight, truck geometry and riding style. I used to run my calibers with double barrel bushings and sleeved washers (changes the feel completely). 
Are there any longboard shops/crews in ireland. 
In my opinion one has to try bushings sets and form to know what one likes.

As inspiration. All you can really change about your truck with good suggestions. Find what you like out of that at sickboards if you will.

any experience with the Bustin Thermoglass Maestro Pro, earthwing superglider carbon, madrid missionary 37" or the DB Longboards The Wingman? really good prices on all them just wondering what b best.. the superglider is listed in @onloop "choosing a deck" as the best deck for building an esk8 in his opinion..whatcha think? just like theyr shape more than the jet but whatd perform best?

Let me put it this way. There are facts about decks you need to consider and that can be argued.

- Clearance 
- Wheelbase 
- Concave dept (enclosure mounting)
- Flex
- Intended use (from composition and concave)
- Price

Ther is pletora of options with same wheelbases, flex level and concave etc. It comes down to what you like and that come with years of riding and trying it out. So take a deck that for your build and is easy on the money, so you can take 2 and try it out ;)

You are asking what performs the best, well may sound harsh but a pennyboard with a good rider will perform better than any board you end up buying in the first year of riding (as an example for arguments sake). Honestly if you fall in love at first sight with a deck that works go get it.

As to what board is the best. Its simpel, none! 
There will never be a best when the biggest factor (the rider) is a variable. Just not how logic works. 

Tipp: if you have any longboardshops similar to mine you can rent set ups for a day super cheap. Mayby ask if you can change once a day. That gives you 10 decks per week to test. Topmounts, pintails, rockered, dropped, double drop, droped down, w concave, tub concave etc. Try them all ;)

I get what your saying but theres only one skate shop anywhere near me and they don't stock more than like 3 longboards as its a skatepark really..so iv no way of testing other than buying..and the boards I listed are all in same price range. a better way to put it is which of them would you rate for an esk8 build ?

Ok, so purely my opinion. From your mentioned decks i would only consider the Wingman.
