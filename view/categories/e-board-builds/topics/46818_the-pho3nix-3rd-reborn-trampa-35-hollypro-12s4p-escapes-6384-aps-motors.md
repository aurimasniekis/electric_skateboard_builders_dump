I was supposed to finish the build and the make a thread about it but part of the fun is also sharing and documenting the progress, so I decided post now.

[The Phoenix](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-phoenix-trampa-hs11-urban-board/43448) was sold after just a month of being built, so I used the money to make a similar build, slightly different but with the same soul.

Here are the parts I receive 3 days ago:

100 Samsung 30Qs
Trampa 35 HollyPro deck
Ultimate trucks
Superstar hubs wrapped on 8" Primo Alpha tires

I quickly and desperately started to build the battery, when you make a build similar than previous one the dejavú feeling makes you build like a pro, everything is much faster, you even have the option to improve the previous design.

I used the approach from @chaka to have a safer battery pack, fish paper on this layout:

![20180215_164732|690x388](upload://xwU80z1Go9Vj7LTUTPl79MvwvZ6.jpg)

Then spot weld them, not sure if this could be called fuse cell level battery as I didnt use fuse wires on each cell, maybe the strip could act as a fuse in case of a short.

![20180216_114529|281x500](upload://qMHa2PufOv2xl1JIY0z3HPeJjog.jpg)

The enclosure was already designed on my previous build, so it fitted perfectly.

![20180216_211842|690x388](upload://ciZQ5qBawY1vfMCHbFtYgCWc9sr.jpg)

I used 16awg wires, a 16AWG wire should be good for 50A so I installed 2 of them for 100A max, the battery can only produce 80A peak so some extra room for peaks. 
![20180217_180319|690x388](upload://guAZSUioaXQGlOJJ9sp4yvQRLBa.jpg)
![20180217_180302|690x388](upload://iO7vEptm2HaP3d2hVjg3nwgJ2Zz.jpg)

The HollyPro is slightly different than the HS11 deck, the main benefit is the weight, the HS11 16 ply weights 2926g, the HolyPro 15ply weights 2,570g, that's more than 350g.

However the holes are going to be a challenge to work with, the nose and tail on the HS11 were used before for the on/off switch and battery capacity tester, the HolyPro have holes on there, I'm gonna mount a sheet of plastic to tap the holes in order to hold both parts.

Yes, that's one of the challenges of this build, I chose the HollyPro 35 because it was offered as a complete MTB on Trampa website, there was no option to buy a complete MTB with an HS11 deck, it  just forced me to buy the deck, trucks, wheels, hubs and bearings as additional, at the end it was a lot cheaper.

My plan is to seal the holes with a sheet of paper underneath and griptape at the top

You can also fill the holes with epoxy or similar, sand it flush with the deck- and you’ll have a watertight deck :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

You could tape the bottom, fill the holes with hit glue, then after it's cooled shave them with a flat blade. Remove the tape or not.

I didn't think of that. I already started with the epoxy glue.

Now I need to wait for those ESCapes, the APS motors and the motor mounts which are in Atlanta ATM.

This waitiing-for-parts game is the worst part of this hobby

I'm having belt skipping though, but I fixed it but tight them, not sure if that'll wear the motor pullies faster.

After a couple of days of riding it I was able to detect some issues:

1. Rattling on the front wheels, axles were loose
Fixed

2. Trampa bearings had way too much drag
Changed them by old bearings with adapters, less drag

3. Belt skipping issues
Tigthed them till they had almost no flex, skipping fixed

4. Grinding noise on the motors
Motor mounts loose, adjusted them with Loctite

5. Too narrow power band
Changed the motor pulleys from 12 to 14T, accelerations is crazy now

6. Board too wobbly
Adjusted the front and rear springs until screws were flat to the board. Sweet spot, perfect steering and stability

7. Enclosure rattling
Adjusted enclosures screws with Loctite

Riding a board with no rattling or sounds feels like riding a brand new car, even at really bad roads you feel confident to push the throttle to the max.

[/quote]

I really love to see a road on the horizon full of potholes, uneven pavement, brick sidewalks and knowing that I'm not going to slow down, just pull the throttle all the way to the max and it goes over everything at full speed, like if you were riding in a brand new bike path with a perfect smooth surface, I never slow down now, ever. That's the most satisfying feeling when riding this board. 

Now, when I get to a destination were I need to carry it over starways, I really suffer and wish I had taken the smaller board.

Everything else it's just a dream, it's a freaking perfect board, when I get to my destination I feel I got there too fast and I have the need to go out again. It handles close corners and obstacles with precision without sweating

Hi @Eboosted , are you using the motor mounts from @Idea [from here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motor-mounts-kits-for-trampa-atb-and-mbs-matrix-old-type-matrix-ii-ats/44749/1)? What about wheel pulleys? Are they from the same kit?

What kind of speeds do you get? It's a 14/72T setup on 8" wheels but what kv on the 6384?

Thanks!

I'm getting 55km/hr, the esk8 calculator is dead on, pretty precise at 85%, however I reach 46km/hr pretty often with good stability, max speed I've seen on the logs is 52km/hr but that feels to be the limit for safe riding over a Trampa deck.

Did you have any issues with the motor mounts as the ultimate trucks are 9.55 width where as the other trampa trucks are all 12mm. Do you feel like there is any weakness issues with the mounts going on the ultimate trucks?

The trucks are the same dimensions... With just a smaller diameter axle.. only thing that changes is the bearings..

Aren't you worried about protecting your battery if there's a short circuit?

Not being aggressive, just interested.

Fuses can be dangerous. When the fuse blows you loose all throttle and brakes, if your doing 35 or 40 downhill that makes for a bad day. 

If your VESC limits are set correctly, your wiring is done properly and your using an appropriate BMS a fuse is unnecessary.

If your VESC limits are set correctly, your wiring is done properly and your using an appropriate BMS AND you're using a correctly specced fuse then your fuse should never blow unless you get a short circuit, in which case you're probably going to loose control of your board anyway, along with your board going up in flames.

Thanks Mike, you make a good point. However I was always under the impression that @michaelcpg's chain of thought was correct. If everything is specced properly, your BMS will limit overdraw, and the fuse will only blow in the case of a short circuit.

I feel like we also don't have a ton of evidence for super long term use of these boards and how wires will wear overtime in flexible style setups. I imagine that eventually a wire will wear through and having a fuse could prevent a catastrophic battery failure. Maybe its just paranoia?

A big part of this is that @Eboosted is using neither a fuse or a BMS and it makes me worry since I hate seeing such beautiful projects catch fire.

Ideally you only want a fuse to blow if there is a short circuit. Not during ridding. If your max battery amps is 60amps on vesc settings, maybe a 80amp fuse would work?

Fuses always makes me ride uneasy on every agressive push on the throttle, even more if I know I could loose brakes at full speed because the damn fuse blew.

A BMS has short circuit protection, but only after the battery, if there is a short in the battery itself then you are screwed either way, I used cell lever fuse on my Pho3nix build, I'm relying on that for battery short protection.

Gaps look narrower than real life because of the GoPro wide angle.

> Trampa bearings had way too much drag
Changed them by old bearings with adapters, less drag

@Eboosted: I feel like I'm experiencing the same thing.  I wasn't quite sure if what I was seeing was due to Pneumatics vs Non-Pneumatic (Since this new board I'm working on is first time I have rode pneumatic)  OR if it was the bearings.  I'm not sure what I am actually asking but do you have any advice vs me just jumping in and buying all new bearings.  When you changed bearings did it become comparable to non-pneumatic wheels?

So I went to visit my friend Karina to have a Dimsum lunch in Chinatown, located in downtown Lima, it was a sweet ride from Barranco.

Chinatown is one of the busiest streets in Lima but fortunately I didn't choose to go in rush hour.

Man, you are brave ridding like that, wish a had balls like you, maybe when I change to the 6,5” I will gain confidence to go mid traffic 

It appears that the streets in Lima are really high quality, by that I mean it’s there isn’t a gap at each intersection for water to drain and things like that, these gaps make impossible to ride here with 80mm wheels, you have to stop every block

Just because of no maintenance, no loose or broken belts anymore, no worn out pullies its a worth upgrade.
However, I'm fighting with too much drag at the moment. Maybe it's the grease I used

So I made an effort and purchased the Gopro7 :sweat_smile:. However my PC struggled to playback the footage. I had to pull my wallet again to upgrade the processor :face_with_head_bandage:  for the new coffee lake one a pretty fast Intel i7 8700k. The Damn motherboard had a different slot for the processor so the motherboard had to be upgraded also :unamused:, at last when I was ready to build my rig I realized my old ddr3 memories won't fit the motheboard which needed to be upgraded ddr4, :tired_face:

At the end I had to also upgrade my hard drive as it was almost dead according to my tech and had to also upgrade the atx fan. 

The Damn gopro 7 upgrade ended up to be pretty expensive but OMG my new pc can playback and edit like a pro

Well there are pretty bad roads on certain parts of the street but lucky for me this commute had very good streets, besides you can't ride everything with the 7" urban threads.

It's always dangerous but once you were close to be hit by a car several times you know what you shouldn't do or were you shouldn't speed up. I've been riding these streets for more than 2 years every single day, now I'm more comfortable than ever. Nevertheless, I always commend myself to God before every commute.

I guess it’s the same as here then, some places it’s heaven to ride and lots of others not so much 

Do you have any data on the consumption of the 6.5” tires? And what pressure do you run them? Looking forward to finish this build and try them
