I needed a kicktail.  I am a pool skater, so I wanted something that felt a bit more like my pool decks.   You can see I typically ride longer pool boards : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RV5RuQmD3c .  Maybe I will wise up and get a traditional longboard so I am lower but for now I think I will really like this deck.   I just need to figure out the best way to drill into it to mount my enclosures.
