I'll post my pics soon. 

FYI - not many motor mounts fit the ATS trucks as-is. @Idea has some designs that he can CNC for you, but I ended up taking a dremel to the truck so that a caliber-fitting mount from DIYES could fit. Before then I had a prototype mount made of plywood.

@mmaner Check the  axle diameter - IIRC the ATS is for 12mm axles, and the 7" wheels I think only fit 9.5mm.

That's the ATS.12, the standard ATS trucks are 9.5mm as are the 7in KNobby wheels.

I've been chatting with @Idea about his dual motor mount solution with clamp rings for the ATS trucks.  Im mostly just experimenting with this build, trying some new stuff that I haven't done before.  Ill post lots of pics and summaries after I start building.

So nice and clean build!
The heatsink box for the esc looks soo good.
Really nice made. The battery box too. Did you make the battery box by your own too?

Thanks Andy :relaxed: 
Just the finish of the battery box (inside/outside).
It is an ip55 electric junction box (that met the needs of my mate/customer), I filled all the wiring entry holes (on 3 sides / 4) with 3D printing. 
Then stratification and finishing CARBON POLYESTER blue.

For the cover, it is the same plus integrand 3d printing. All painted black satin with a graphics test ... cause the fiber has moved a little and is not the cleanest :smile:

For the MADBOX, normally reserved for complete custom (it's why I can't share it, it's kind of my signature), I will set up a small, very small GB regarding all the demand for them. Maybe around 3 or 4 pieces of fox and as much v6/escape case, to start and see how it goes (if I have the right to make one, .. I must verify that!).
I'm looking for the best compromise actually, not to spend a month on finishes (hard arm work) and trying to keep a good price ;)

Ho good to know, thanks ! :D 

I'm testing another way to make (a BIG) top mounted battery case/ enclosure - flexible - and a bit more integrated ... but when you want more than 12s16Ah it's a hard time :sweat_smile:

Thatâ€™s right! I really need to work on a hot swap docking station. One thing for multiple purposes.
You can use different lipos in different sizes and you can swap them in just half a minute be releasing the straps and change the pack.

Exactly !

But I have also try to those transmitter cases by Turnigy ^^

Yeah the duffman packs insane, but I guess i canâ€™t do a so complex pack ðŸ˜…
Have too fat fingers for all the wiring ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜‚

Maaaan, how much builds you have???

Made or actually got ? :laughing:

There is a lot of them for my french mates and since 2018 for customers with [**Amadride**](https://www.amadride.net/).
I will continue to try to make 3 or 4 builds a year, just for passion and to propose something special for some french e-riders need ;) 

I should finally get 3 setups for all my needs (maybe 4 or 5 with during sometimes, with all the test and parts laying around, plus all the prototypes I begin this year ... and the new Mad e-Dirt coming soon haha).
Like Sender say : _To know what is best, you have to try it all, right?_
I feel like this since 2014 with esk8 ... dam passion :blush:
