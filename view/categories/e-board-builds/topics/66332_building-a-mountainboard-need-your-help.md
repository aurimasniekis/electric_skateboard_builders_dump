Hi guys! I've been riding my DIY electric longboard for a few years now and I'm having a blast!

Now I want to start the next build and I need your help and thoughts to build the perfect mountainboard for a reasonable price!

I'm thinking a pretty standard mountanboard from Trampaboards.com and the motor mount from . The other electronics are more of a questionmark atm.

If you have any tips on a good trampaboard for a noobie on these boards, please help :slight_smile:

 I was thinking two VESC's 4.12 and two Turnigy SK3 6374 192KV, though i'm not sure how to mount the pulley on the round motor shaft.

Then comes the batterypack. I have a DIY 18650 12S3P pack atm and i'm thinking about a 12S4P pack for the new one. Or LiPo's if there's any advantages.

The encolosure for everything needs to be as close to waterproof as possible.


I'f you have any thoughts, ideas or just want to say hi, please comment! Any tips are welcome :slight_smile:

Peace!

I would recommend you getting an Vesc 6 variant, more amps and relatively cheap, 110$ or so
For dual drive you will need more than a 3p for sure, i would use 4 minimally preferably 5p

For a little more $$ you can get maytech motors that are ip54 rated

Thanks for some great tips! I will check that out! Where can u find the Vesc6 dual? or do I just buy two?

you can probably get a better price if you order from a group buy

So basically the advantage of lipo is the power to size difference. Liion is brilliant dont get me wrong, but lipo is cheaper, sometimes smaller and can usually push much higher amperage.
regarding the pulley, you use a small grinder and grind a flat spot into the shaft. you can also use a chisel.

Thank you! I understand. Will I need the extra amps from the LiPo or will a 12S4P-Samsung-30Q-pack manage to deliver the amps I need?

To get the most out of your 2 6374's, you'd be better off with lipo, but i would say it would be just fine on 12s4p. Like @Acido said, you'd be better off with 12s5p. Not 100% sure the power mtb's pull bc ive never personally built one. Should be okay, i think

I see! The 30Q should be able to do short bursts of 30A I think. And with a 4P that would give a burst of 120A. 60A per motor with 12S is 3000W. That should be plenty of power :) Please correct me if i'm wrong!
```

## \#12 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-08-28T12:52:50.242Z Reads: 114

```
The 30q can handle 20A constant, so 80A constant which is 40A per vesc.
that's usually enough for the most vescs with 4.12 HW.
not sure so about the voltage sag with a 4p if you climb mountains or constantly ride hard offroad, it can shorten your range a bit. 5-6p in this case better.
How about your battery enclosure? you plan to mount it on top or under the deck?

For reference... Iâ€™m using li-ion with a 10s12p config for my latest build (emtb). Iâ€™d recommend as many parallel groups as you can afford

Ok sweet! I plan on mounting it on top between my feet. Just for the ride height. 5P is probably better, yes..

If you mount it on top you donâ€™t have to go slim. Thatâ€™s good and more safe in case you grind some rocks.
How about the range you wanna cover?
If itâ€™s just for like 10-15km go with lipos.
Above I would go with 18650s

I'm planning to do the same soon! However, I think samsung 25R 18650's are also a very nice option for a 12s4p pack. They are cheaper than 30Q, and you get a bit more amps but loose a tiny bit of range. Depends what's most important to you!

Personally I'm looking at the dual fsesc4.20 also, but waiting for reviews.

Alright! I'll try that if I get those motors! I have the 6374 TB motor now and it's been working perfectly fine, though it's a bit more expensive than the SK3's

I'll probably want as much range as possible. Like 20km or so. And I like that the 18650 can do more cycles..

Just realized you want to use sk3 motors right?
They unsensored unfortunately. I think for a mountain board better use sendored motors.
If you run Foc sensored you can startup also on a small hill without need to push your board forwards.
If you look for a cheap sensored version than look for the sk8 motors. They just like 10â‚¬ more expensive than the sk3.

for MTB esk8 i would recommend the 6380 from TB its sensored and has crazy torque... i would also advise getting a AS5047 Encoder for ur motors

You get used to unsensored on a mountain board (as long as you keep moving, even with a tiny bit of speed, all is good). I have seen so many motors here where sensors were actually causing issues that I am kind of happy that I have one less component that can screw things up.

SK3 149kv with by now 3000 km on the clock and still going strong. I ride almost every single day without the motors overheating (since they are not sealed) and the bearings are still OK. They have been through winter/snow/rain/mud. Now running them on 12s since 300 km. 

The sk8 need modifications, otherwise you may loose or dislocate your bell at some point in time due to the missing circlip.

The 6380 is overly expensive and essentially only offers benefits for specific trucks for mounting over the 6384 which would otherwise simply not fit. For trampa trucks, it's rather pointless.

If you want to go sensored, sealed motors  are almost a must since the PCBs for these sensors are not coated. One short due to rain or mud and you loose a vesc. Motor Temps may get high/downside of sealed.

Regarding lipo vs Li-Ion. With my setup, I lost almost half of my lipo capacity after around 2700 km. 4x8000 mah 30c 5s, total cost 232 Euro which I have recently replaced.

I have the sensored 6374 190KV from TB now but I don't have the sensor wire plugged in. It works quite well. I also don't use FOC as i burned the DRV chip on my first VESC using it.

Regarding the LiPo's. That's exactly what made me switch to 18650's on my board. I think I'll stay away from LiPo's this time.

Offered that one for charging.
The problem is, that the space inside is very restricted. The walls very thick because of special damping.
I can fit inside 4lipos 155x55x55.
Thatâ€™s definitely not enough for 12s5p and itâ€™s too heavy too

Internal measurements: 240 x 165 x 80mm.

That would be_
240 / 19 = 12 (12S)
165 / 19 = 8 (8P)
And the height is enough. With a 5P pack you can fit a BMS as well. Am i wrong? My math isn't the best :p

Ok ðŸ˜… maybe you would get it in.
Just itâ€™s not a nice box for the case you want to use it. Itâ€™s made mainly out of aluminum.
Sure itâ€™s painted, but I would always be afraid that the color somehow can come off an short something ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜…
If you want I can sent you some pictures from inside after work. Just let me know.

That would be great! I will cover the pack in shrinkwrap either way but it's better if the box is plastic. I don't have a 3D-printer so I will have to buy something that works "out of the box". Pun intended!

You might be wanting to complete your build yourself etc. But if you are buying a trampaboard for Â£600 ish from trampa, you could go for the old style mount full board from them. For the extra Â£700 you will get your mounts, motors, pulleys, belts, 2x vesc 6, box, voltmeter.

You could eve sell some bits you donâ€™t want

Just a thought, GL with your build

Thanks for the tip! I have thought about that but I love building it myself with my own mods an personal touch. That's half the fun if u ask me :slight_smile:

I think the TB 6380's sensored with the dual-focbox from enertionboards might be the way to go. But the SK3 with dual VESC's is so much cheaper. Don't know if I'll notice the difference really. I run unsensored now and starting from a complete still is not really a problem.
