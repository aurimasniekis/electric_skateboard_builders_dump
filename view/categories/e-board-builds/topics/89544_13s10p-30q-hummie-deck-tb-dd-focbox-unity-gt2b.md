So I've never created a build thread before and I've been talking about this build a lot Soo here it goes.



* Hummie deck _$125_ @Hummie @Jaydawg56

* Hummie Hubs _$550_ @Hummie

* 130 30Q from nkon.nl _$402_ 

* 2x Focboxes (or one of my unitys) _$250_ @CarlCollins thx for getting em to me.

* BKB Dual Focbox heatsink _$28_ @JLabs

* Bestech D140 13S _$33_ @JLabs

* TSG PASS _$223_  (cause I don't wanna die) @JLabs

* Mastercho GT2B Mod @MasterCho _$34~_ @mmaner thx for printing it mmaner 

* Custom Fiberglass Enclosure _$75_ (from a guy on NYCeBoarding)

* 13S 54.6V 10A Charger _$78.56_

* moonbeams 25$ @moon 

* Skinning services from @ sender

 Also the hummie hubs might be switched out for TB DD as I have those on pre-order @torqueboards


Oh and @Sender 13s10p

This build will be charged at 10A, because I can't stand waiting 😅

Hummie deck came today, now time to widen the cutout.

Huh! I'd print some nylon straps, or strap it in somehow. That's got to be a lot of weight. No doubt the fiberglass can hold it though.. so maybe it will be 100% all good. That thought just gives me the slight *uneasy-s*

If you glue them with neutral silicone to the board you will be completely fine
Just cover the whole place where the battery will sit with a generous layer, clean the battery really well, put weight on it and let it dry 

I’m still tying to figure out how I will remove my old battery without destroying it in the process

just a suggestion for the attachment of the enclosure, drill through the deck and use "t nuts" on the foot side of the deck. find out the length of screw you need and use em. then put griptape over the top. it'll be far stronger than inserts

What was your goal with such a huge battery? With that many cells in parallel are you worried enough to use cell fusing? Does that BMS let you do any extra monitoring of each group? Are you going to mod it to increase balance current? By default it has a balance current of only 72mA, your pack has 30Ah!

> if your pack is built well that chances are you won’t need cell fusing

I think fusing helps mainly when a single cell fails entirely and becomes a short. Poorly built packs are likely to short around the fuse (e.g. short from friction on cell wrap, or no insulators) and are unsafe no matter what is sprinkled on top.

Re: range, with that many in parallel you could have gotten more range with higher capacity cells, since discharge current won't be holding you back. Or go lighter at 13s8p. But it's only ~10% or 5lb, neither of which is significant in this case. :sweat_smile:

Re: balance current, for lion 0.1v is ~10%, so 3Ah for the whole group. It'll take >1.5 days to balance that. I'm building an 8p pack and will have a similar but smaller problem, but I'll be using diebiems which can show you voltage of each group, so it'll be easy to keep an eye on balance. With that many cells and $$$ involved it might be worth you picking up a bms which can easily give you metrics. The chance of battery failures is not high but the result can be catastrophic.

> im sorry but based on that statement I can make an inference that you’re not very informed about this matter.

I've built 0 packs and am here to learn. But as mentioned above this is a nice feature of some BMS's. Plus there's no need for attitude. Your board is going to be huge and I'm excited to see how it turns out, looking fwd to updates. :peace_symbol:

sorry i didnt mean to present a additude anyways its not gonna take 1.5 days to balance out, and i said 0.1v was the max drift

and 0.1v is not 10%

you can discharge the 30q to 2.5v without major issue (dont do it)  but sag would be unreal at that point

if you know anything about BMS's then you know if a cell is majorly out of balance the pack won't charge to 100% that's how you know there's something wrong with your pack... :sweat_smile:

Quality cells on a properly build pack with adequate current share hardly imbalance, if any at all

Not that I encourage it, but no BMS, and at least 1500km on the pack and they are perfectly balanced (to the limit of my multimeter)

@lazarus people assume that there is drift because they use cells that are produced in different batches meaning that they will not be matched :smiley:

plus if your pack does not charge to 100% that is also a indication that your cells are out of balance

No idea how authoritative [this site is](https://www.powerstream.com/lithium-ion-charge-voltage.htm), but they suggest 10% at the top.

As silly as it sounds. when you go "outside of the box" of decks with available enclosures, figuring out an enclosure for a deck can be one of the hardest parts of a build.

I've done quite a bit of Automotive fiberglass. Maybe I should get back into it and make customs.

Yeah its certainly not an easy process, but I think it could give a nice shine to the enclosure. I dont know much about ABS and acetone but I would also worry that it compromises the enclosure if its thin in certain areas.... :man_shrugging:

epoxy certainly seems like a more durable solution though :P

Deck mount the battery like this, it will shield it from impact even if you have low ground clearance and the batteries won’t fall out until the deck literally gets torn apart

Really? I don't figure the difference between a 160 and 180 lb rider would increase consumption so dramatically... Why would 4 extra Ps (admittedly 13 cells each) cause such a difference in range?

I think the whole 100a is where Alan is going to run into consumption/efficiency issues 🤔

Each cell is 48 grams, and the 4p extra is 52 additional cells... 
It's only 5 pounds more ( plus a little for nickel and wiring)🤔🤷

I still think you should back down the size a bit and use an enclosure that is already available.  I PROMISE noone will think less of you.  

13s10p is kinda irritatingly big, like the dudes who ride a massive jacked up truck because they have a 4" dick.  I obviously don't know your penile length, but it does beg the question 😂.

I have a hummie deck at the house and a bunch of enclosures I could mock up to see what you could fit in a readily available enclosure if you would like.

It's not just more cells, it's also more enclosure and more padding and more glue and more wire, etc. Also keep in mind the added weight means more amps needed to reach the same speed on the same terrain which means more heat, so less efficiency.

i started this thread to document the build process.

i am understanding what you're saying but it just does not add up in my head. more cells should equal less heat (cell heat)

and the extra 5 pounds ~ shouldn't matter that much and it cant be that much more like seriously. and the hubs cant be drawing that many more amps because its lugging around extra weight

@mmaner how much extra weight could a extra 4-5p or so have? or im just not understanding, ill ride this board when i finish it and see how many miles i get.

You could try cutting it to shorten it perhaps.

Also I'm with you on more cells meaning proportionally more range. Even small packs still add weight to the board, the range/weight ratio of the board even increases as you add more cells, because everything else still weighs the same :smiley:

the The Argonaut might also work

What a nice read up after missing out some hours on that thread 😅👌

@AlanZhou why you worry about sag at 6p and than only use 12awg on a 10p build? 🤔  

As we already elaborated the other day, you only 140cm and 55kg...with short arms...so even 4p would probably give you no sag at all 😜😂

Good that you think and write down a lot about your build thoughts in here. I think there still a lot of points not really balanced and need some overthinking before you put all together.

That’s not the point. I just don’t understand how you come to it. Why you choose 30q? Because you need the 20a discharge? Than also use appropriate wiring to it. I mean I anyhow expect that you never will draw more than 80a for more than 20-30s so yes 12awg is fine but than a cheaper cell with more capacity and less discharge would do the job as well without sag.
Same weight, more range...

It’s the job you should have done before by your own. I‘m not going into that and digging out the right cell which would beat the 30q in your case.
Let’s say the LG MG1 for example would work for the same price (based on ru.nkon.nl shipped to my place), same weight, but 230Wh more, which would probably give you another 10km range.

you won't have space for 5 cells on a 4p pcb.  so 5p pcb.

but just make sure when you attach it to the cells, alignment is perfect.  there will be enough of a gap so the pcbs don't overlap.  but alignment has to be perfect.
