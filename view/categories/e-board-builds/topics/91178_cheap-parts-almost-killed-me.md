I rebuilt my first build from 2016 and really put miles on it. Its a maple drop deck off amazon, caliber ii trucks and three homemade 10s2p batteries as well as dual vesc 4.x (dont remember what it was). I have approx 1300 miles on it and i use it to daily commute 5+ miles either way. She rides great still but today i got ambitious and tuned for speed. I normally travel at 18mph but last night i tuned up and hit about 35mph. Then the motor mounts bent. Lost tension to the belts, lost braking power, had to bail in a bush. Here are my old motor mounts that i bought vs. my new stainless steel ones i waterjetted this afternoon. Went from 5mm aluminum to beefier 6.25mm stainless steel.![20190419_175909|690x388](upload://5L9kArv52B3OWnBZOvKeuAOs3ku.jpeg) ![20190419_175940|690x388](upload://t9jrA5uxeXAGfblI5CTQLVRL4R.jpeg) ![20190419_175843|690x388](upload://eF7IVmiUnbb7BwD7VNO4SiejgFv.jpeg) ![20190419_175838|690x388](upload://lyhM4KVW7T2pA2sNVYv4EN2lLjz.jpeg) ![20190419_175906|690x388](upload://6p0M7UJejqLh4Z8MIegncchTpA.jpeg) ![20190419_175854|690x388](upload://c6d6sZMfE0Ch2nfliAx3KCVYNqm.jpeg)

One time I had an unexpected failure and, long story short, I had no brakes going full speed down a one-way, the wrong way, and no way to get through traffic.  Thankfully, a car parked on the side of the road parked just a tad too far from the curb.  I flew between the car and the curb and was almost sure I was going to nick the curb and eat it right then and there.  But, I made it through.  Probably touched on both sides.

That car's crappy parking job reminds me of your bush.  #inourmomentofneed

I used them just fine but i was always gentle with them. Its the first time i really gave these mounts any real work. But yeah, i have access to a fully outfitted machine shop. I should have just made something more robust to begin with. Im machining out MBS matrix mounts soon to build my mountainboard. Have two 46v 10.5ah batteries for the build and im excited. Still dont know which esc to use.
