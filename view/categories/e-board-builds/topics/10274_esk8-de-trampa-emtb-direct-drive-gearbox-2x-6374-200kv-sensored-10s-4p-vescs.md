Just wanted to share the final iteration of the gearbox eMTB setup. 

Deck: 16ply 35º HOLYPRO - STIFF - 685 black
Trucks: Vertigo 12mm hollow Axles CNC Baseplate Steel Kingpin with red and green dampa's
Wheels: Superstar wheels & ratchet bindings - 685 BLACK 
Motors: 2x 6374/200kV sensored, 3KW @10s
Gearbox: direct drive, sealed, 1:5.9 transmission
ESC: 2x esk8.de VESCs (refurbished :slight_smile:) 
Battery: 10s/4p Sony Konion VTC5a 10AH with BMS
Antispark Power Switch (Vedder)
Micro Remote (the updated one)
xCase boxes

It took only two days to assemble, but prior to this we needed some months for testing of different versions for reliability, performance and sustainability. After going through countless iterations of the gearbox this is now the final version. We tested in rain, on grass, in the woods, on gravel, pavement and on the North Sea beaches. Real world tests. And it is definitely splash proof - there are a lot of rainy days here, so this makes sense. :wink: 

Main challenge was to get the box sealed and quiet. Also keeping maintenance efforts as low as possible. It's greased with industrial grease used for elevators, which is proved to be very sustainable. 

So, why inventing something like this - there are plenty of solutions with chains or belts? The main reason for this was to get a closed system in place where it is unlikely that grass, small branches or gravel is damaging the drivetrain.  

The motors are sensored providing an excellent acceleration from a standstill, especially uphill. They are designated for 10s and deliver a lot of torque, we measured a high speed of 54,8km/h. 

We will start selling the kits starting next week, containing the complete drive system with motors, wheels, trucks and gearbox pre-assembled. Might be around 1150€ for everything on the rear truck. It's not a cheap solution, but at the end it's a lot of fun driving it! :slight_smile: 

Some making-of pictures:

:heart_eyes: that is awesome. Looks so neat.
Are there gonna be different gears available?
Incase we want more torque over top speed and vice versa?

Thanks, it is very easy to do this, since the motors mounting system allow the motors to be adjusted for different gearing. So by changing the motor pulley and/or the spur gear this can be achieved. 

Depending on demand we would be able to offer different options.

Forgot to mention the overall wight of the board: it's 13.4kg including everything. So the direct drive with both motors is quite light weight. 

Since we have tested it intensively it's now up for sale. Including all parts (including truck, wheels, motors, mounts, gearbox, etc.) and preinstalled @ [esk8.de](http://esk8.de). 

So it's just about swapping the complete back truck and mounting the already installed system. :slight_smile:

EDIT: We will cover full warranty on our VESCs when used under FOC and 10s with those setups! It has been tested for more than 1000km and it works without any issues!

I self have make the print but it was not so good for the Gearbox what we produced.

In Januar we will testing a new Generation of Gearbox.

I think that was the lightest Gearbox what you can became.

The Actuality Gearbox what we sell have 650gr pro side, together 1300 gr

Without Motor and Trucks.

And the new Generation Gearbox have a fully enclosed housing

for the Motor.

So was the Motor also protected against

dirt, dust and splashing Water.

Also protected against

We want make the best Gearbox for MTB what you can buy.

The first Cover we have milling completely out POM.

That was a little bit difficult, so that we have resolutely

we make a frame out POM and we screw it on the Motorholder.

And the Cover too.

So we can reduce the costs.


we think about it that we build two versions.

One out Aluminium and POM Frame and one out Carbon and POM Frame.

We make a experiment with the housing from the Motor at time 

with a 3D Print.

We have enough experience with the gears.
That we can say that the system holds.
I will be finished in January the first1000km 
with the first Generation Transmission 
After that I will to dismantle it
And post a pictures from the Gear wheels
The new transmission will only
Lighter and more compact.
And i hope that the cost will be lower.

with 10S/5P LG HE4 12.500mAh 

2x 6374 Motor with Hallsensor and FOC modus.

Battery start and end 31Volt and 29Volt.

So i come with the 5P 22-25Km.

I drive my Longboard with Hummies Hub Motors dual

the same settings 10S/3P with LG HE2 and came 26-28km with FOC too.

Without problems :joy: :joy:

I don't think that helical shaped gears work well. You will transfer a lot of axial load into the tiny motor bearings.
A V shape would be the proper solution, but again to complicate in manufacturing.
Additional the regular teeth can transfer more torque with less friction.

Edit: I'm sorry I googled again and have to correct myself. The helical gears can transfer more load!

Also with helical gears, you would need some thrust bearings, making the assembly bulkier and more expensive

```
Spur gears are generally louder and clunkier than helical gears. There's a lot to consider when making gears in general though. Helical gears do produce axial forces and you need something to counter this. Herringbone or double helical gears can get around this problem but they're twice as hard to make as regular helical gears. 

We've spent a lot of time working on our gear setup and have run many thousands of hours of testing under different loads and forces. 

Helical gears are complicated to make, but are quieter and smoother running than a standard spur gear. Lubrication is a big factor to consider as well as the heat generated.

I don't understand how the motor bearings have anything to do with axial forces. The bearings only take radial forces no?
The circlip should take all the axial forces.

same for @Blasto's thrust bearings.

If I am wrong I'd be happy to get some mechanical engineering lesson by you guys.

That would also generate a lot of friction and wpuld eventually fail. Helical gears try to "spit each other out" (axial force), thus you need some fancy bearing to counter that force

Helical gears you can by only in Steel,

i don't have finde a Factory that`s make Helical gears out POM.

When you take it out Steel than was the Teeth by 50 finish and have

a weight from 1,8kg :scream:

The second was that, when you take Helical gears and you

want take another Setup, bigger Motor gears, than was the adjusting 

a little more complicated.

I ask me about many People her, they want al bigger Motor and more Power.

But he forgot that the power from the Motor became the Motor shaft 

from the Motor bell.

That was only 10-15 mm what the shaft was in the bell.

Many people making a Key way in the Motor shaft and 2 thread screw in here

Motor Pulley that he don't lose here Pulley :smile:

But he forget looking on the Motor another side :joy:

I want make a solid and light Gearbox for MTB not a formula 1 Gearbox :joy:

Have a good time.

The Wheel gear can you used only smaller 60T

but the Motor gear you can change up to 13T ore 14T.

For Motors with 200KV was the 12T/65T optimal.

But when you used a Motor with lower KV (170)

so you can used a 14T gear and came on the same result 

I have calculated that with this Gearbox used 6374 200KV Motor

 Trampa with 8" Wheels 200mm and 10S Battery´s 

I have deducted 3cm from 20 cm Wheels so that i calculated

wit 170mm diameter the speed.

and then you came over 45kmh/28mph

the range was by 10S/12,5Ah 22-25Km / 15miles 

I have 5 days ago postet a test Trip 

Have a great Time.

so that you can take the Holder ring on al position what you want.

So you can used on 35° and 15° Decks.

The Gear wheel was a little bite to strong,
the free spin was not so good,

you can hear by the another motor was it better.

I think the motor cover was a little bit reducing the motor sound

To short was not good.

And when the wires was by side, so can tear the wires.

But i must looking when i make the wires longer and make

We have testing the Gearbox in many dimensions, and Material
but they al wanted the strongest and fastest Board.
More Power more Speed.
But when you going on maximum Speed you lose many Power.
When you want more Power for Hill Climbing you lose by Speed.
You can using by the Gearbox a translation from 12/65T=1:5,41, 11/65T=5,90,13/65T = 5 
ore 11/60= 5,45, 12/60= 5, 13/60=4,61
When you using one 70T Gearwheel than was the diameters from the Box so big that the Motor
stand over the Wheel. 
With this Gearbox i think i build, a very good mixture of speed and power.
But in first for me was that i can use the MTB in dirt and dust.
But the drive and motor do not suffer.
Because on the road I can also ride with the Longboard.
I will make 3 versions, with Motor and VESC, with Motors and only the Gearbox with Trucks.
In the first time i build for the Superstars Wheels the Gearbox.
I hope you like it

If you can read,
the axes are general Vulnerable to break.
I have unfortunately no broken hanger so I have allowed myself
from nowind to borrow a picture.

And we testing how much KG you can loaded on a original hanger
and how much on the milling hanger.
The test results coming soon.
Who ever has built a Board knows that not everything is perfect at the beginning.
that's why we have several Boards in the test.

I worked today on the Gearbox and i make one experiment with
the Holder ring.
I milling the diameters from the Truck that i can see that´s going.
An the result was, that you can used the Gearbox on every
Trampa Truck, Vertigo and Infinity with Superstar Wheels.
Only a little bit you must file on one side max. 2-3mm
thats was very easy.
