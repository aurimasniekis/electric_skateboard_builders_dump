**HEY EVERYONE!**
new to the community and i've been snooping around for days.
I saw casey Neistat riding one of those boosted boards and i was like "Dang i gotta get me one"
Unfortunately/fortunately my bank account doesnt agree at the moment #poorcollegefreshman
Anyways, i decided, hey, my major is Electrical Engineering, it would give me some good experience if i tried to build one myself. and my search brought me here.

**WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR:**
References and Guidance
 **WHAT I INTEND TO USE THE BOARD FOR:** Get around campus mainly with a little bit of speed 15-20mph, climb like 10-15 degree hills. i'm about 180 pounds currently and dropping fast. so by the time im done (im guessing a couple of weeks) i should be around 175pounds. 
My budget id say is around ~$600 and i guess i could go a bit up or down if needed/required.

I know nothing about decks or any of the sort. so im hoping the community can jump in on this one.
I live in upstate New York if anyone is trying to lend me a hand :smile: 

Thank you! I look forward to responses/suggestions.

Got any specific questions? It's all about reading at the beginning. There are a few threads to take a look at:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-builder-list-of-known-and-commonly-used-parts/2983?u=jlabs

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/beautiful-diagrams-no-words-just-pics/3179?u=jlabs

Personally I like build threads the most. You learn a lot more from someone explaining it and showing pictures than anything else in my opinion. Some good build threads:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/scarlet-cruiser-long-haired-boy-scarlet-deck-dual-r-spec-space-cell-vesc/714?u=jlabs

If you search 'LHB' you will find some great builds. 

If your a complete newb this does a good job explaining (written a long time ago)

...Also, check out the builds section.  You might find a board that meets your needs.  If so, you've got a shopping list and someone has already done it.

@JLabs Thanks for the articles! ill start reading them now to gain a better understanding of configuration of the board :D , I came here also hoping people could give me suggested builds from which i could work of off and ask more questions from. Its hard to ask questions about a thing you dont know about :') .

What are you going to do for a enclosure?
And a loop key.

oh i hadn't thought about a loop key and i bear in mind that i would have to buy various connectors for the VESC and batteries. I am looking at some basic setup diagrams to get an idea of what cables i would have to buy.

Any suggestions for loop key? 
Also, i might either buy and enclosure, or search the internet for something good and waterproof.
How do i hookup that battery monitor?

Don't be hasty think it through. don't forget little parts and pay for shipping twice.

oh definitely! thats why i'm compiling the full list of main parts first, once i have that down i will be moving forward to ask about the small parts and connectors, wires and the lot.

Say, if i wanted to waterproof my board using a spray, how would i go about doing so?

and the electronic parts? im guessing the VESC. i saw it on some thread on here, someone using it to waterproof their Genesis Eboard, i was just wondering if a waterproof enclosure handled all of that

Best thing to do is scotch guard and rubber seal for wood or an abs enclosure and rubber sealant

Just build it first and worry about making it water resistant later. That stuff can be found at any hardware store.

Doesn't look like you'll need to solder anything from looking at your parts.
