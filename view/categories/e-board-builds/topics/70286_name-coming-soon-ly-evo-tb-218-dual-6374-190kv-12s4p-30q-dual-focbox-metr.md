This build started with the purpose of getting me to the store down the street a little quicker. Then I started reading about all of these crazy build people were putting together. It turns out that the route I've chosen is overkill for a ride down the block due to the weight and size of the thing. But I feel that it will be better served for cruising the mountains around me, and for long distance rides.

Now it's almost finished. Today I will post some photos of the steps that I took. Can someone please go over my Focbox settings with me sometime to make sure it all looks good? That will at least give me some peace of mind for the first run.

@bigben Your enclosure looks excellent! It's even more robust than it appears.
@Jlabs The battery pack and modular pulleys are perfect so far. Thank you for all of your help.
@Alphamail I appreciate the advice you gave me for getting this board configured for the deck, dewedging, and my bodyweight.
@Deckoz Thank you for helping me with all of my little questions!

**Inserting motor shaft keys and installing pulleys**
![IMG_20180912_150231|666x500](upload://tGk0jQLvJn7TCxXV0IXdu7XQcYo.jpeg) 
I used pliers to press the key into the shaft. The cardboard is there to protect everything from scratches.

**Installing pulleys into wheels.** - Pressing in the extra wide bearing wasn't difficult.
![IMG_20180912_142048|666x500](upload://zHcfQQHypZXTfsD9iBG1OHNXdQ6.jpeg) 
Pressing in the hub required a lot of force, and I didn't have a clamp. I ended up standing on them.

**Get the Loctite and bolts out.** - I'm using Wera Hex-Plus tools for everything. These things are _really_ cool. I never liked using hex tools for the smaller stuff because of their tendency to strip the heads. But these tools, combined with high-quality bolts, are unstoppable.

![IMG_20180922_155355|666x500](upload://oXTkaFYO9Y8GT5hFoK3irfjoV60.jpeg) 

I ended up extending the receiver wires. It's not in the photo, but the receiver was placed towards the front right corner of the board/enclosure, away from the mess of wires in the back. I'm hoping that this will decrease interference and give me a more solid connection.

**Installing the battery meter, on/off switch, and charging port** - After drilling and filing holes for these things, I used neutral cure silicone to keep the enclosure sealed.

**Enclosure mounted** - Lots of things left to clean up. The o-rings under the mounting bolts are binding and popping out. I'll have to figure out a fix for that.

12s4p was always going to be tight. Mine has 10s5p with the big bms. It's a squeeze.

@bigben That was a big fear of mine. That all of this waiting for your enclosure to come through customs, and the battery pack being made, etc., wouldn't fit. It's not Amazon Prime! Your enclosure looks great. I did scratch it here and there with the file I was using. Did you say that a Black sharpie might do the trick?

@alphamail Thank you! Yes, Elon was with me every step of the way. Except for the soldering part, he had to exit the room for that. Cat + Soldering = something undesirable

didnt rly work well, i mean silicone is good, but i would need a better mold to get something to actually work with. Since you seem to have a 3d printer i guess you can make some nice molds.

I used a vendor at 3D Hubs for the printing service. I didn't get too deep into this project. No 3d printing, DIY battery pack, or fiberglass molding took place in my little apartment!

The setup is running great. It's much faster than I anticipated. With the motors at 80a, I haven't tried to go full throttle yet.

Stability is a little tough for me around 29mph and up. It gets a bit wobbly. I think more practice keeping my body weight towards the front of the board will help. 

The only problem that I've been having is with the motor pulleys. They always slip from their position, even with Loctite 243 and very tight set screws. The belts have a constant tendency to slide towards the motor; this is the cause of the issue. Maybe it's the way the hanger is shaped? There's seems to be no way to fix the belt issue, so last night I installed two 8mm snap rings to both sides of each pulley. There are no grooves in the motor shafts, so I am not 100% confident in the longevity of this solution. But I'll give it a try today, and put them through some extra torque on the road to see if they stay put.

The clips worked great. I'll add those to the build list, and I highly recommend using these for anybody having trouble with their pulleys sliding around.

I was also having trouble with a recurring click sound from the pulleys due to not being able to fully torque the set screws. This was due to a poorly fitting hex key (Wera Hex Plus) and soft steel screws. The fix was harder set screws from Monsterbolts at eBay, plus their hex key. Loctite 243 is always applied.
