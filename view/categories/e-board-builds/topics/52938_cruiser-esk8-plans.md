Hello fellow Esk8ers,

I have built an electric Longboard as my graduation work for high school. It was awesome and I had a lot of fun building it. However since the LiPo Batteries gave up on me I wanted to build a new one. I am in College now and it would be perfect to have a smallish Cruiser Board as a transportation from A to B.
My wishes for this board are the following: 

- Small enough to carry it in one hand whilst walking (Cruiser Deck)
- Not too heavy
- Decent range (around 15 miles (more would be even better))
- Doesn't has to be fast (16 mph is fine for me)

I would like to use my 'old' parts from my Longboard. I own the following:
- 180mm Paris trucks (with motor mount welded on)
- Orangatang Kegels 
- Turnigy SK3 6364 190
- Gear ratio 3:1  

In my old build I used a pair of 6s LiPo's in parallel. However I would love to use a battery pack with included BMS and On Off Switch (however it has to support 220V and has to have the Swiss inlet), since charging was a bit of a pain with the lips charger. 
And I would like to use a dedicated ESC for esk8s, in my last build I used a car RC ESC, which made a whole lot of noice, while braking and braking was a bit aggressive for my taste. 

All in all I would like to build something similar as the new Boosted Board mini (range of the X and speed of the S).

Do you have any suggestions for the missing parts for my build? (cruiser deck, battery, ESC (VESC?)) and should I keep the motor or switch that one up as well?

I would be very thankful for any suggestions regarding this build. Thanks in advance and greetings from Switzerland.

Sean

im doing something similar right now....making a 10s3p 27.5" cruiser with dual 6355 motors and [these 76mm wheels](https://www.ahmyowheels.com/product-page/akasha-fr) as i thought the smaller wheels would look better with the smaller deck 

i wonder if you could fit a 10s3p battery underneath an arbor pocket rocket? 

im no expert with batteries, but from what ive read, aside from a 10s3p having better range, people are often underwhelmed with the power of 10s2p batteries (which I originally wanted to do) 

hoping for 15+ miles of range and a top speed somewhere between 20-25 mph

I can speak to the quality and functionality of FOC boxes if you have the budget. Alien power systems has a very small anti-spark on/off switch. The bms normally runs off of 25.6V or the normal voltage of the battery. You need to get a power supply to power the bms. A laptop style power brick or 3D printer power supply generally work well

Thanks for the reply. Those wheels would look amazing with an arbor board! 
Yeah I was hoping to get a smaller battery and sacrifice speed for that. I am still debating on what kind of parts I'm going to go with

So you wouldn't recommend going for a smaller battery, say a 6s4p ?

I never mentioned anything about the battery. 6s4p would get you about the range you are looking for. Plus, 6s BMS are easy to come by

I can't do anything without a tail.  The retro 80s decks are AWESOME commuter boards.

See the screws on the front, that's a handle under the nose...

That's a 30.5" x 10" deck

So a 6s4p would do the job just fine right? And it would work with the focbox, most motors and switches right?

Yes. Do you have experience with 18650 batteries? I personally prefer 6 of these in pack of 2 parallel and 3 series. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-2s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html?___store=en_us

Does "27.5" cruiser" mean Penny board now? Or am I missing something? 

Cruiser to me, means anything comfortable for cruising, which I find Penny's to be the opposite. What I think of a cruiser as is something wide, comfortable, beginner friendly featuring soft, yet small cruising wheels. Something like a 1980's skateboard with 60mm wheels and 10inch wide

At Tactics board shop online the cruiser selection features all "shaped" decks or novelty style type decks basically the opposite of functional, yet I find them extremely functional. Decks like the Welcome brand or shaped Anti-hero stuff...anything 9 inches wide and most of them have longer wheelbases. 

There's also the "ditch" skateboards which are basically the same thing, because ditches typically have crappy non-smooth cement and they are sometimes dirty with gravel, those who skate them use a larger and softer wheel, but not quite "longboard wheel" sizes. Powels Gslides or Ricta Clouds fit the bill. 

I see many younger people calling Penny boards "cruisers" and I'm confused...I totally think of what @b264 just posted as a cruiser, and I think of a Penny (anything shorter than 30 inches) as a Penny..

Well charging didn‚Äòt always go well. I used a LiPo charger and it never read 6 cells and then I had to charge as a lower battery pack and go upwards until it finally read 6 cells. I thought, that I had discharged my batteries way too much. But I had enough Voltage, that it shouldn‚Äòt have read such a low voltage

If your going to use a 6s4p you might as well go 10s3p as it‚Äôs only slightly more cells and won‚Äôt need as much current, it will also have more range

That sounds like a charger issue not a battery issue. Not trying to change your opinion just giving my opinion.

I'm on the process of building a portable light board, but I don't want to look funny because it's too small, so I chose the Moonshine Sidekick 35" will install a 10s3p, 90mm Wheels and dual Focboxes.

So expected range of about 10-12 miles? I am looking a doing a similar thing with a trampa street board. Deciding between a 10s 5ah and a 10s 10ah pack for it. Do you have experience with wh/mi?

Sounds good! I was wondering if the conventional Boards offer enough width for bolts, that attach the enclosure. 'Cause I built my own Longboard and I nearly had troubles with fitting some good bolts, without them looking out the other way

Well I just thought if I‚Äòmgoing for a shorter board, it will safe me some space, weight and cash. And since I won‚Äòt be going fast anyway, I wouldn‚Äôt need more Voltage
