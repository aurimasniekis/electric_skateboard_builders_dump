Inspired by @Kaly and his beautiful street carver, I decided to build  my own.. a bit more extreme though ;) As usual.. 

Ill just skip right to the meat! 

DUAL 6374 190kv SK3 motors, sensored and extended shafts 
12s5p samsung 30Q "flexible" or hinged battery pack. 44.4v 15amp hour Lithium Ion pack built by me of course
Trampa street carver
Authentic Abec 11 flywheels 97mm 75a
New Trampa Battery box, trimmed and notched by me 
Mounts by Dexter, @torqueboards  at    Mounts are prototypes and are not yet functional as the fit isnt ideal
20mm belts/aluminum pulleys 
Mastercho mod gt2b remote 
Dual VESC-X running in sensored BLDC hybrid mode

Thats pretty much it I think.. This has been a work in progress for about 2-3 months as a side board. Now since summer is on its way, i'd like to finish this board within a few weeks i hope.  

Yes the board still flexes, just not as much as originally.  Which is good for me. 
Yes it will be water proof, electronics will be enclosed something to seal them

I still need to get my hands on some mounts that will work permanently, right size belts, I need to 3d print some end caps to the battery box, program eveything plus a few small things. 

What do you guys think? Does it meet up to the overkill expectations you guys usually demand from me?? lol

which deck thickness did you buy? could you make a flex test video? while I like the consistent material look of board vs enclosure, Im a little afraid it might add too much stiffness. the number of screws seem to hint in the same direction?

did you need all the cuts to allow the enclosure to adapt to the camber shape?

im very keen on the urban carver with the new urethane hub wheels once they are available. thought about segmented enclosure vanguard style to keep the flex. camber board that doenst level out in action gotta be really uncomfortable!

Yes I'll get around to making a flex video.  It drops down maybe an inch or more which is ideal for me as I do not like too much flex.  I used the 16 ply deck.

The cuts were to allow the enclosure to adapt to the camber yes. The enclosure other wise has literally zero flex what so ever. 

The screws were just to make sure the board was held evenly in place.

Looks mean! 

What ply battery box and length did you go with? How are you going to seal the ends? 

Would it be possible to post pics of the inside of the enclosure with everything laid out?

It was a 70cm 5ply...? I think. It was the thickest one. 

End will be sealed with a 3d printed end cap printed in white abs. 

The electronics aren't set in stone yet but I can totally get a rough picture of it. I will warn you, its tight fight

Not really I'm waiting for the updated version of the mounts from @torqueboards 

Other than that I'm pretty much done with the rest of the build. As soon as I get mounts in I'll finish it up

How are you guys making these enclosures? Vac/Carbon Fiber? @whitepony @Kaly both used similar enclosures, the biggest difference of course is that yours is not sectioned out.

Thanks @anorak234 ! It's just that as far as I remember SuPower offer 6 different 12s BMSes... So I'd still like @barajabali to have his say on this.

I love these builds, the Trampa Street Carver on dual 6374s and 12S4P is my favorite board. 

Can you please take closer pictures of your enclosure? Is that the Trampa enclosure? 

Any pictures of the inside of the enclosure to see the battery layout and Focboxes?

It was a 12s5p but I sold the pack and the enclosure :) I'm gonna go a different route with this build. I'm now going to use a 12s4p pack <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/a/4ac11dd38480785ee332f317d296e6ad60767ff2.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c6617d3e5ccb4f62b6c82c226f0b4704553ebf36.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/1/91636431ac966acc85bb4ec58cc1554bcc1d6242.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/b/7b74fdcb400dd8a8faa1b39e8333c36e42fdbdd1.JPG" width="375" height="500">

If I'm not wrong this is the Supower 12s charger's plug, innit? ;) I'm about to buy one too, and couldn't find anywhere online the diameter of its plug - would you be so king as to share it and also tell me whether the socket was included with the purchased charger, please? :)

Ah there we go. 

The port comes with the charger actually. But it's called an XLR port

Do you need the dimensions? I'll try to get them tonight, I am currently working

Dimensions are exactly what I'm after :) I'd like to buy a socket with a screw-on cap like the one below, and wouldn't like to wait until the charger arrives from China only in order to measure the plug to buy a corresponding socket on Aliexpress and wait yet another month for it or more ;)
