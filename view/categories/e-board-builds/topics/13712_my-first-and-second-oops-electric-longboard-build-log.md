What great projects electric skateboards are!
They've got everything a basic, or experienced, tinkerer could want.
Especially if you build your own deck like I did, badly....more on that later.

This site and all the information within has been a great help so thanks to everyone who has posted in order to help us new comers get through.

My board is currently, shall we say, at a prototype 2 stage.

I've got plenty of pictures and information so I'll upload it in chunks over the next few days to create a blog that I hope comes in useful for others.

My methods and ideas are a mixture of old, new and what I thought was new but was actually old.

So, after a week of research I made up my mind to build a cheap,DIY Boostedboard shaped electric longboard.
I'm even going to laminate by own deck......well how hard can it be?

I had enough 3.6mm thick general construction plywood to make a 4 layer laminate deck.
This ply was absolutely not strong enough in the end but you live and learn.
I PVA glued the laminates together and left it clamped in an improvised jig to create a slight concave across the width.
2 days later, I cut it to shape and took some admiring pictures.

Right, onward...
Now some hardware.

I've been into electric model aircraft for some years and so I'm well familiar with the likes of Hobbyking and Turnigy.
When I saw that the Turnigy SK3 series of motors are used for skateboard builds, my mind was made up.
After lots of research I eventually decided on the 213kv 6364 motor.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/d/3d2e681cb37b737327ac1e483cbb651cacc53611.jpg" width="690" height="388">

What a beautiful lump of engineering and only £60/£70. (Yeh, things can cost a bit more here in the UK) 

I'm not concerned with the stiff phase wires or the lack of a key way.
I'll sort it.

Next the wheels.
If I'm to build a Boostedboard shaped object, it will need the right wheels even if nothing else is the same.
After searching every corner of the UK for other options, I ended up forking out for the lovely Orangatang 80mm diameter Kegel wheels.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/f/3f7417741be7f6e3b204261c6b7a2f3dde1f8020.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Finally, the ESC.
I wanted something familiar and "no fuss"
My board is only to use 6s LiPo's so the Hobbywing 150A Ezrun was my choice.

Haven't got a pic of it on it's own so here's a link for now;

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbywing-ezrun-max8-v3-150a-brushless-esc.html

ESC came complete with programmer board and the extra capacitor pack so I was made up with it.

I know there are cheaper options out there like the VESC and others but this one was for me.

Right, to be continued, probably tomorrow.

Thanks for the "likes"
Cheers for now.

Next, a handset to control the speed.
Again, I wanted something I could hit the ground running with so I needed a 2.4ghz RC car pistol grip type thing.
I could always ebay it if I chose to move to something more compact later.

Flysky FS-GT2B looked good and was only about £20 including receiver and Li-Ion transmitter battery pack.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/e/1e060098109c4aede4fd270623dac47fe534bbf9.jpg" width="690" height="388">

As soon as it arrived, I bound the transmitter to the receiver and tested it with the ESC and motor. All worked well.
The substantial Li-Ion pack came fully charged and judging by the transmitter's tiny current draw, could last months at a time between charges.
Charging is via a USB lead (supplied)
Throttle progression is perfectly weighted and pushing the trigger forward applies the brake.
Using the ESC programming card, I set the throttle to response to as soft as it would go and the braking to mid point.
When performing the braking function, a fairly loud screeching tone is heard.
I'd previously read about this, in various posts, but on hearing it for the first time I can see why some might think it a slight annoyance.
Ah well, it'll be a good incentive to leave plenty of stopping distance so as to minimize use of the brake.

I rather fancied a little volt meter which would be visible while I am riding.
The obvious place for it, would be recessed into the deck above the front truck.
At a little over £5 and about 1" diameter, this is what i chose;

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/f/2fb33f79ca8f03785043fa05df1ad533e8c978a4.jpg" width="370" height="414">

Rated up to 30v, it was just what I needed for my 6s setup.

I've been around Li-Po's for many years so I know the importance of not over discharging them.
The ESC is programmable to shut down once the battery reaches a certain voltage.
Even so, it's handy to see what your battery level is so as to avoid a long walk if nothing else.
With the 6s system fully charged the volt meter will read 25.2v.
I figured that I will use the packs down to say 22.2v and see what mah's my charger puts back in.
With a bit of trial and error, I should quickly learn the optimum voltage which represents the all important 80% discharged point.
ie, If my 10000mah pack takes 8000mah's to fully recharge it, I should be good.

Time for a break so I'll upload some construction pics later.

Cheers for now.

Raining outside now so time for more blog.

The deck looked great once cut into the Loaded Vanguard shape but it wasn't strong enough.
I spanned it between two blocks and tested my 85kg mass on it.
It was clear to me that it would definitely break if I put my full weight on it so I had to do something.
I'd come this far so determined to use it (if only for a short time) I decided to stiffen it with two poplar wood rails.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/c/3c3bc0ab4e4259cb5997a485d2784c8404d0ff9e.jpg" width="690" height="388">

These rails would serve as the makings of the battery/ESC compartment so I came to terms with the idea.
Obviously all deck flex will be eliminated with the addition of the rails but as I'm not actually a skateboarder, I'd probably not know the difference.
I made the rails just deep enough to accommodate the LiPo's and some foam (top and bottom) to protect them.
I glued (PVA) and screwed the rails in place and the deck was then strong enough to support my weight easily.
I cut out the hole for the volt meter and then used a router to round the edge of the deck all the way around.

Not exactly cabinet making but I was pretty pleased with it and it hadn't cost a penny so far.
Time for a couple of coats of varnish.

1st Coat

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/a/8a570db67a2cdc5cce3fa345814d3905f1fcc486.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I hung it in my garage on a hook to dry in peace but managed to drop it. Doh...

Ah well, thought things were going well.......the balance is restored!

Successful repair...

And a 2nd coat of varnish.

Hmmm... pretty glossy and the wood has darkened a little with the varnish.
I rather fancied it paler but too late now.
I needn't have worried. (later)

Cuppa time.

Right, trucks!

Wow, what to use? and the choice.

If I could have got my hands on some Caliber trucks at a descent price here in the UK I might have gone for them.
Paris V2's were the second choice but I really wanted some with a squared off type section so that I could use a clamp type method of holding the motor mount on.
I've got access to aluminium welding equipment but the mechanical approach would allow for lots of adjustment as I went along.
You know what it's like.....after studying the job for hours, you say, "yup, lets weld it there" and it turns out later that actually 5mm further to the left would have been better.

So, I wanted some chunky trucks with a hanger width of around 180mm, from a UK supplier for about £40.

Mindless Talisman's.............

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/5/457da4dcacbd9a1446813c15423648890da6d06a.jpg" width="451" height="278">

I initially wanted them in silver but only black was in stock.
They are great looking trucks and after a little bit of machining to further improve the motor mount clamping area, they're near perfect for the job.

I say "near" perfect as the bushings are quite soft but more on that later.

Next.............pulleys.

Again, lots of studying and considering other peoples preferences, I finally decided on the 5mm pitch HTD system.
These are the exact ones I chose.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/e/8eecbb921e9abffd6088113eb3d1bfec8cfac767.jpg" width="404" height="334">

They were only a little over £10 for the pair but do require machining.
I have a lathe and a milling machine in my workshop so not a problem, in fact, the machining of the pulleys and motor mount are the bit I'm looking forward to.

With a 5mm pitch I reckoned 9mm belt width was enough and it's proven to be a good choice.
If you go for a 3mm pitch system (like Boosterboard) most recommend a wider belt of say 15mm.
If like me you're using a Turnigy motor, you'll appreciate the narrower pulleys as the motor shaft is quite short compared to others.

So, another difficult decision, final drive ratio.
Again, after lots of studying, I settled on a 15T motor pully and 36T for the wheel to complement my 213kv motor, 80mm wheels and 6s Lipo's.
This gives a ratio of 2.4:1 which has turned out great for my setup. More on that later.

I didn't order the belt at this stage because I wasn't sure exactly what length I'd need.
My research (reading forum posts) suggested I'd need a 265mm long belt if my motor was 65-70mm from my axle (centre to centre) 
This turned out to be exactly right :slight_smile:
So I bought two at around £4 each delivered.

To be continued...

Again looking good I managed to get a pair of calibers used in uk for £20 and were in a good shape. If you haven't got any yet there's a few longboard buy and sells on facebook

Thanks Alex, I fancied the Calibers long before I realised they are used on the Boostedboard. Might look out for a pair for my next build.
Talismans recommended though.

On to the motor mount.

I machined this from a piece of aluminium flat bar.
I aimed for around 65-70mm between the axle and the motor (shaft centre to centre)
10mm clearance between the motor body and the underside of the board.
Probably a little over engineered on the thickness but aluminium is light enough and I didn't want it to give me any bother by way of bending or slipping etc.
The thickness where it clamps to the truck might be especially OTT, I suppose, but it is solid.
Two M8x60 bolts clamp it in place.
Anyway, a picture is worth a thousand words so here's a few.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/a/ea0f9f10fd634e9e48f7929eaf01e24f27ee9423.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Yup, happy with and quite enjoyable to make.

The motor pulley needed boring out to 8mm for the motor shaft and an M4 grub screw threaded hole forming to pinch it on.

Now, I knew some people have had issues with the pulley coming loose so this is what I did.

The motor shaft came precision ground to 8.00mm diameter.
I milled a slight flat on it to accept the grub screw.
The shaft was very hard and destroyed the little endmill used but it did it.
I haven't got the means to create a keyway so...
I bored the motor pulley to 7.97mm and heated it to about 300C.
Put the motor in the freezer for an hour and slid the pulley on.
Actually I still had to press it on despite the temperature difference and attempt to shrink fit it.
Needless to say the pulley is not coming off in a hurry, it is absolutely on there!
The grub screw is fitted for belt and braces, and sits on the machined flat with a bit of Loctite on the threads.
If I ever want to change the motor pulley it should come off with a custom made little puller or I'll just zip it off carefully with the miller. It was only £3 after all.
As can be seen on the 1st pic, the motor mount is bored sufficiently so the pulley passes through.

The 36T wheel pulley also needed boring out to clear the truck hanger and to reduce its weight!
A turned aluminium spacer, between the wheel and the pulley, keeps everything aligned and true.
All mating components are shouldered and recessed for a locating fit.
I even machined the inner hub of the wheel slightly so that everything mated perfectly and achieved a perfect true running system with zero wobble (run out) and zero oscillation as measured with a dial gauge.
The whole assembly is held together with five M6x55 stainless cap head bolts.
Definitely should have gone with M5 here as squeezing M6's in needed a lot of tinkering and drilling.
A drilled stainless washer supports the bolts on the outside of the wheel and, again, the outer hub is machined slightly so that the washer sits well.
See pics.

So, onward, and time to think about how I might cover the batteries and ESC.

Eventually I hope make a complete carbon laminate enclosure or maybe try vac forming a plastic one but until then I need some sheet material to simply clad the poplar rails.
2mm thick aluminium sheet is to hand so that should be fine for now.
Simply bent it to shape in a vice between a couple of pieces of angle iron improvised jaw extensions.
A few screws around the perimeter and I should be up and running.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/1/215d04c21cf480d06ea3b8f245e52ee1a1bb4fa6.jpg" width="690" height="388">

As you can see, the 150A ESC is quite a chunky thing and protrudes inconveniently above the aluminium sheet.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/d/6d3690536d04c7c03dda24520645e12ac681aee9.jpg" width="281" height="500">

No problem, the built in fan needs a fresh air supply anyway so I make a cutout for it and begin thinking about how I might protect it from bashes and splashes etc.

I'm gathering pace now as I'm tantalizingly close to a test run.
Got to be careful though as it's easy to end up with a part that's taken hours to make but not fit for purpose.

A night's sleep and the idea came. An hour of tinkering and its fitted with four pop rivets.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/6/16520aa91cab2aadc647ed9419915d49ba3bf31e.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Happy with that. Keeps the splashes out and offers some impact protection.
The air drawn in by the fan will exit from a slot where the motor phase wires come out.

The little hole is so I can operate the ESC push button on/off switch with a pokey thing. To be improved at a later date.

I also modified the entire aluminium cover so that it was in three pieces.
This allows just the centre section to be removed for access to the LiPo balance plugs.
The two lap type joints also stiffen the ally sheet consiterably.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/f/df3b65b2c692a3dee6e6e9c2e90a418677d41105.jpg" width="690" height="388">

It's not as posh as the carbon enclosure I dream of, but this is prototype one, it looks low profile and I'm pleased with the result.

More soon...

What next?............

Wiring I guess.

I'm using four 5000mah 3s Zippy packs because I have quite a few of them.
These are my staple pack for long range FPV model aircraft flying.

I may well look at Li-Ion at a later date but considering I already have the LiPo's, it's a no brainer.

The ESC has a push button on/off switch for activating and shutting down the ESC.
Obviously the ESC must have a small stand-by current draw for the switch to work so I knew I would want to be able to completely disconnect the power from the Lipo's between rides.

To do this I had the great idea of using an XT90 connector, with a bridging link wire, as a heavy duty isolator.
Of course, I later find that it's a well established method so no break through there.:blush:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/c/4cc943c07c12cdc970f361fa2bb26082380f175b.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I have an external charging port (XT60 connector) but the LiPo balance leads will have to be accessed through the central ally cover panel for now.

Anyway, here's a thousand words in the form of a picture to show how my wiring looks.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/2/52026e670f38f93110e9a080dffda5d0bafa2c54.jpg" width="690" height="284">

The fuse is an 80A lorry (truck) fuse.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/5/657cc7871a48594f8772585fd958d9e5009b61a7.jpg" width="281" height="500">

I reckon I could go lower, maybe down to 60A, and I'll experiment at a later date.
I included the fuse mainly to protect the rather pricey ESC.
80A is fine for now as the ESC is supposedly rated at 150A continuous and a whopping 950A burst!
Even if these manufacturer's figures are a bit optimistic, I've made an effort with protection.

On to another job I'd been looking forward to.................Grip Tape.

This was £2 delivered for a 36" x 9" piece.
And a free sticker too.

I took a liking to the sticker so decided to incorporate it into my chosen grip tape design.

I wasn't over pleased with the overall look in the end, mainly because the deck turned out too dark after varnishing, but it did grow on me during it's short life. :disappointed:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/b/ab44bb8afa5d89001532e8cbb5fc5d8760a45eb4.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Also a slight oversight, was the gaps in the grip tape design manage to inconveniently show my poplar rail fixing screws.
Slightly spoilt the effect and something to watch out for next time.

As most will know, the grip tape design is based on one of Loaded's patterns.

Next, how did it ride................

Wow, what a moment, that first ride.
I'm 50 and haven't got a skateboarding background so it was pretty exciting.
I have, however, spent 30+ years water skiing and wakeboarding and I have, of course, been on a skateboard from time to time.

So..............it was a lot faster than I thought and went a lot further than I thought.

I'd calculated a maximum theoretical speed of 32kmh based on motor kv, battery voltage, drive ratio and wheel diameter.
I'd no idea what part friction and air resistance would play and was surprised to learn......not a lot.
On a good surface I have recorded 30.8kmh and 30.5kmh several times!
On a fresh charge is seems even faster but I've only done speed tests after about 20mins of use.
It's a little scary for me so I feel much safer at around 15-20kmh and even dabble in some carving.

It charges up modest hills with barely any noticeable drop in speed, just a change in motor tone. I haven't measured the angle it will climb.

Acceleration is plenty. I have the ramp up time as soft as it will go and I still have to lean well forward.

Range varies with terrain. In an open environment like extended road or cycle track, 20km is about it. In town with lots of stopping and starting, ramps and drop kerbs etc, I'm down to 12-14km. I would say if you tickled it on a long flat, un-interrupted route, 25+km might be possible.

So, after a gentle but varied 20km run I've used 8000mah of the 10000mah battery capacity. I average 16kmh so a 20km run takes me an hour and a quarter. This means I'm averaging 6.4A, over said run, which is a lot lower than I thought was possible.

More analysis soon and details of my mishap.:disappointed:

I've had quite a few sessions now and getting to know the board quite well.

So, from the ground up.............my thoughts.........

The 80mm Oragatang wheels are great. They do a great job of tackling dodgy pavements and steps of up to 1/2" or so.
The durometer spec is perfect for grip, wear rate and ride comfort.
Big is best, for hacking around on rough streets, so some 90+mm FlyWheels would be better still IMO.

The Mindless Talisman trucks look absolutely stunning.
They have a lovely feel but I suspect they are slightly softer than an ideal esk8 choice.
I adjusted the bush compression considerably and this much reduced the sensitivity and thus the tendency to wobble at speed.
However, the lipped washers started chaffing on the hanger so I had to relieve the lip a little to allow that little bit of extra adjustment needed to get them just right.

The 3s 5000mah Zippy LiPo's are great batteries.
They seem to serve me well with my other interests so seeing as I had them already, happy with!
I do, however, look after all my Lipo's with a fanatical approach.
I never store them fully charged and I never over discharge them.
Anyway, there's plenty written on LiPo care so.....moving on.

The EzRun ESC. Works perfectly and never gets beyond warm.
I reckon it'd probably be OK without the fan, which would reduce it's profile considerably, but maybe another time and with caution!
The only negative point with the ESC is the well documented screeching noise it makes under braking.
Certainly makes you think about slowing down early so that you don't have to use it, especially if there's people around.

The voltmeter.............perfect in every way. Lets me monitor exactly what state of discharge the LiPo's are at, as I ride. Essential in my book.

The home made deck? Mmmm, not nearly strong enough, made with the materials I used. The Vanguard shape is also a little uncomfortable for me. I now believe commercial decks are good value so probably wouldn't make another. Even the £20 ebay ones are better than I can produce so I'll leave DIY deck building to the more talented among us.

The 2.4ghz controller? For £20 you really can't go wrong.
It would benefit from a good hack and rebuild to make it smaller.
Something for the future.

So, I'm riding along and I hit a ramp in the road where the tarmac is out of level.
A loud crack noise comes from the rear end of the deck but all seems ok.
When I say ok, if I'm honest, it does seem a tiny bit more bendy at the rear.
I decide to order a cheap maple deck off Ebay to use for prototype 2 as this deck's days are now numbered.
Two trips later, and out of no-where, my deck suddenly snaps on me while cruising on perfect smooth pavement!
I step off easily and quickly but I'm pretty gutted as the beautiful SK3 motor has briefly served as a wheel and in the blink of an eye, it now looks 20 years old. :cry:
Here's 4000 words worth of pictures as writing about it is painful.

Ah well, that's christened it as they say.

I'm now up and running again with by new Ebay deck.
It's a great deck really and very comfortable.

So that brings the tale up to date.

As soon as we get a descent day I'll take some more pics and do a little video of it in action. I have a few minor improvements in mind which I'll bring to the forum but for now I'm gonna get some miles on it.

Cheers for now.
Hopefully a video in a few days.

Really bad luck with the decks but looking at it maybe cause by the self taping screws. I drill and insert t-nuts as its a clean hole where as a screw can pull the lawyers apart and also if no pilot hole will crack it as it goes in and weakening it.

So.....I've been using my creation for a couple of weeks now and it's been running very well.
Time for some upgrades.

I stripped down the drive system and noticed that the wheel bearings in the driven wheel had become a little loose in the wheel hub. All the other wheels were fine so I put it down to the belt and pulley system putting a substantial amount of twist on the wheel during acceleration and hill climbing. This seems to have eased the hub a little. The bearings aren't really loose but they do now slide in and out more easily than the did when I first assembled them.
I could see that an extra, larger bearing located withing the drive pulley would completely eradicate the undesirable twisting and make for a very solid drive system.
I machined out the pulley to take my chosen bearing and machined the hanger so that it would slide on nicely.
I didn't take any pictures at the time as it was a fairly quick job and I got excited to try it out.
So here's a crude sketch to explain what I'd done.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/9/e9e9b80b2ce7080360b806c05cdb44a3be5377eb.jpg" width="653" height="435">

Now this was another one of those ideas that I thought was previously unknown but, after some searching, I see that a couple of esk8 builders have done it.
Anyway, it runs very well and I reckon feels a little smoother, especially under heavy acceleration from low speeds.
I'll take some pictures next time it's stripped down.

More soon, Andy.

So, what next?

The GT2B Mod of coarse.

I love the reliability of the GT2B 2.4ghz controller so what to do to miniaturise it?

I settled on the 3D printable Badwolf V2 by bjornw and made available to all on thingiverse here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:922378

I downloaded the print files and took them to work where we have a couple of well used 3D printers.
It took a few attempts to successfully set up the printers and get the job done but it was rewarding in the end.

The finish isn't as good as can be attained with better printers but seeing as I'll probably drop it multiple times, I'm happy with.

I had to cut a couple of millimeters off the edges of the GT2B printed circuit board with a junior hacksaw and file it neat.Triple check the PCB tracks to make sure nothing was damaged and no shorts created.

I de-soldered the USB port and re-connected it using servo wire.
The GT2B on/off switch is of fairly low structural quality so, in order that I don't have to use the Badwolf switch knob extension, I de-soldered that too and reconnected it with servo wire. This allows the switch to be hot glued directly to the case and makes switch operation feel much better.

Other than that, every thing is pretty much how most people have done it.
A few blobs of hot glue and all held together with four of the original GT2B case screws.

Many thanks to bjornw.

Here's the pictures.

So...........as they say...........I've been charging my skateboard with my trusty Fusion LX60B.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/0/d0a0a4844d3d9752a9024d7b7f55f34e5a148c44.jpg" width="501" height="375">

It's a great charger and I've been charging my 3s and 4s drone LiPo's with it for some years.
It's only a 50w charger though and although it will charge one of my 3s 5000mah LiPo's in about an hour, it's got it's hands full with my 10000mah of 6s LiPo in the skateboard.

It charges them fine but as it can only maintain around 2A max on a 6s pack, charging can take up to 4 hours if the skateboard needs a full 8000mah putting in.

So, I'm ready for a more powerful charger.
At around £60, I really couldn't resist the fairly new iSDT SC-620.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/0/b03acf99986801eccd96db7a9768d2ad40048f26.jpg" width="690" height="378">

It's a 500w charger so easily manages a solid 10A on 6s packs, which is what I want to charge at.
It will sustain a whopping 20A on 6s if one were so inclined.
Seeing at my 6s pack is effectively 10000mah, I'll stick with 10A which represents a 1C charge rate and delivers the required 8000mah in around 48 minutes.

The only thing is, this charger requires a power supply, ie, it's not built in like my old Fusion charger.
No problem, time to get involved with converting an old server power supply to use as a power source.
There's lots of info on converting these but the Dell units looked well documented and straight forward so this is what I chose.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/f/bfccb51abdf0835dbb7c027715564dcd0a98be54.jpg" width="690" height="435">

This is the Dell Z670P and is rated at 670W continuous.
That's a thumping 54A at 12v!

Units like this are being churned out on ebay for really low prices. I picked two of these up for £13 delivered, that's £6.50 each!!
I know..........you know how to divide 13 by 2.:grin:

So, they arrived, I tested them and they both work perfectly.

Now, I was going to wire two of these in series to give me 24v as the iSDT charger will run on up to 30v.

(Note: if you do connect two server supplies in series it is essential to remove the ground connections on the 12v side of at least one of the units. This is to protect against a nasty short circuit if the casings happen to touch together. I can explain further if anyone requires but I'll leave this safety note at that for now)

Moving on, I quickly realised that the iSDT charger will happily run on 12v and still create a 6s (25.2v) output.
It just (obviously) draws more amps to do it.
So, I only need to use one of my Dell PSU's and no need to mess around with casing grounds.

So, the first slight hitch. I was expecting the Dell PSU to have a built in cooling fan. This particular PSU must rely on cooling fans built into the actual server as there isn't one.
A few quick (monitored) test charges and I can see that the PSU will start getting quite hot so I'll need to install a little 12v fan.
Another £3 from ebay and I'm in business. Ironic that the little Chinese cooling fan cost half the price of the PSU! :confounded:

I cut a hole in the top of the PSU directly above the heatsinks and now no heat can be felt at all when in use even under heavy load.
The Dell PSU is cruising as, during a normal 10A charge, I'm only drawing around 22A from the PSU which is only 40% of what it is capable of.

Here's a pic with the fan fitted.

Time for my nap.
Next I'll describe the simple mods needed to make a this Dell server PSU run.

Cool. You sorta should make a tutorial on how to use these server psu units.

Nice charger btw! Price seems really good. I kind of feel bad now for only choosing 300w 20A turnigy reaktor which cost me 70eur in the end.

Capable of "only"  12.2 amps at li ion rate (6 x 4.1v). Yours seems like could pump out a whopping 20A in li ion 6s charge mode :)

Thanks Okami,

The next installment will conclude the remainder of what you need to know to convert this PSU.
It's not pioneering stuff though as it's well covered throughout the internet and indeed esk8.builders.

Don't worry though, the Reaktor chargers are fantastic and solid performers.
12A is plenty for most 6s Li-Ion packs isn't it?
What is the capacity of your pack?

7.6ah ive discharged max (4p x 2100mah cells)
Should be good for abou 8ah but i dont charge till 4.2v per cell and have to stop at 3.45-3.5v per cell.

I plan to upgrade. 8ah with emtb which consumes 20wh is a bit too little. 10-12ah would be more suited.

 I plan to build street carver (hybrid) with higher pressure and smaller size wheels. I hope that this will also improve mileage (lower energy consumtion).

----

I meant the fact itself that server psu units should be more popularized. I believe.there are some.tuts about using meanwell or other psu's but i got.to know abou server psu's only from electric bike forum.

Their charging needs start at 1kw power and more. 3kw was already a good amount for them i think (or maybe just a start) have to check this once again

---

Initially got 80w charger. Takes about 3h 15min to charge. Or about 25mins for 1ah.

Plan to charge with 0.5c on normal occasions. 1-1.5c when i need some juice fast. (8-12amps). Will see how it goes :) 

Got 203w xbox 360 psu for now. Should be good.for 150w output ~6amps. So psu will be also upgraded.

Form factor of this grey brick psu should still make it possible to put it in the backpack, if neccesary. In comparison,  PC psu would not be as nice to carry around..

Hi Okami,
I was looking at the Reaktor 300w charger a few months ago and noticed that if you run it on 12v, the maximum output is 220w. That would limit charging a 25v pack to around 8.8A.
To take advantage of the full 300w it requires 17v input.

Onward with the Dell server PSU project.

Only two things left to do.

The PSU connects up with its mother server by way of a so called hot shoe.
The hot shoe is basically a bunch of terminals on the end of the PSU.

The small pins on the left need bridging as shown in the picture.
Bridging these three pins makes the PSU run as soon as you plug it in to the mains (UK 240v AC in my case)

The bridging of these three pins is well documented on the internet and applies to most, but not all, Dell server PSU's.

Do a little search for bridging method your chosen PSU.

The terminals on the right are the 12v DC power out.
The three left ones are negative and the three right ones are positive.
As you can see, I soldered some strips of thin brass sheet across them to unify them and then installed an XT60 connector.

The PSU is now ready to run and works a treat.

See pics below.

Youre right about 220w limitation. I totally forgot it / left it out. I wont use full power for now anyways but will probably have to come up with more beefy psu to utilise all 300w.

Thanks for showing some pics. My xbox psu also needed to bridge 2pins together and i still have to come up with.a connector which connects directly to the.contact pins.of.xbox.360 psu

Side topic - what a bummer.. 72 eur for your type of charger.. directly from eu warehouse through hobbyking.. uuhh I just ''wasted'' 200w of max power and also a pretty nice shape charger with nice display.. 

Lesson learned I assume..

I wouldn't worry. The Reaktor's are great.
The only reason I didn't get one is that they are always out of stock when I looked.
Simply get two of these server PSU's rigged up in series and you'll have the full 300w available.
That will allow you to charge your Li-Ions at 1C easily anyway which is under an hour.

Yeah, you are right.. wont probably complain as long as I dont have 20ah battery.. which will probably be a while anyways :) It's just that my budget for charger was around 45-50 eur.. then it jumped to 70eur at the end with shipping and tax..

Ok to bring this back on topic.. Can you tell what other (perhaps better) functions that iSDT charger got compared to reaktor? It looks like it is pretty sophisticated.. also included usb port.. :D dont know is that so useful (unless can supply 3A perhaps?) but at least its something extra :D

It's quite a simple charger. Just does all the usual stuff only with a great user interface all controlled with the wheel on the side.
The USB port is just for firmware updates.
The only things it does that I haven't seen other similarly priced chargers do is you can alter the charge current mid charge without stopping.
It also displays each cell resistance during the charge.
Don't get me wrong, these are two features I can live without but just saying.
It's best features are the display, the interface and the price.
I doubt it does any more than the Reaktor.
I'll do a little video of the menu's but there's not much to play with.

Current change and resistance display does sound compelling..

Yeah, I just saw how nice and slim that charger looks .. and compared to reaktor.. reaktor is quite a beast a actually :smiley:

Yeah, video does sound good..

So far through this forum I've found about chargers I did not know about.. One of them is venom but they seem to be a bit pricy and come in limited wattage / power output range it seems.. 

Then there is anti-matter charger for 10A 250W (found on banggood), looks somewhat decent and ppl said that the internals are basically the same as Icharger brand has or so.

-- ah too much talk about chargers.. but yeah, they matter, so I assume others will be able to use this info later on anyways..

Great looking build - Nice to see someone semi local on here too. I am just on the North bank in Hull. Not completed my build yet. Just waiting on parts from the group now. Looking forward to getting it finished and getting to that first ride.

Turns out I'm an idiot after all.

I'll give you a clue before I start.................**wear a helmet!**

Now go easy on me, I have learnt my lesson.
I was always going to buy a helmet, there just wasn't anything suitable available in my town.
I knew that if I ordered online, it probably wouldn't fit properly and I'd have all the fuss of sending it back and so on.

So, in the interim, until I got the chance to visit a near by city, with descent helmet retailers, I'd taken to wearing a very thick beanie hat.

Even though my board easily manages 30km/h, I was most comfortable in the 15-20km/h range.
I believed that at his speed, if I got into trouble, I'd be able to step off and run to a standstill.

So, after two significant incidents, strangely enough, it has proven impossible to exercise this maneuver, both of which were at a mere 15km/h.

**Incident one.**
I'm riding along a wide tarmac cycle path.
There's loads of room and I'm only coming across the occasional cyclist.
So, along comes an old chap on a mountain bike from the opposite direction.
I pick an obvious line at the edge of the path well in advance.
As we get closer, it becomes clear he can't see me so I release the throttle and freewheel.
As we got closer, I didn't want to swerve as this may confuse matters so I tuck in hard to the edge of the path in the hope that he will make the slight evasive maneuver required to avoid a head on crash.
Nope, didn't happen and we crashed.
To avoid an undignified coming together of bodies, I somehow leapt over his right shoulder, like a Ninja, and landed on my head.
This hurt for a minute or two and gave me a little brain shake but the thick beanie saved the day from any scalp vs tarmac interaction.
The old chap was unharmed and yes, he didn't see me.

**Incident two.**

I'm riding along another even wider cycle track with no-one around.
I'm practicing some swerving/slalom at around 15km/h.
There is a grass verge each side of the track and after a brief wobble, the wheels are on the muddy grass and I'm in the air.
I land on my shoulder but I can't prevent my head from hitting the tarmac.
The forces are too great and I'm tumbling anyway.
Worse still, the collar of my coat pushed my beanie off just before I hit the ground and there's damage to my head.
Not only did I suffer brain shake again but blood is running out of my scalp from a large flapping gash with my skull showing beyond.

I sat there for a while, mad as hell, and in a little pain, before getting back on the board and heading home.
Made it home ok and got the wife to take me to hospital.
3 hours in A&E, a painful cleaning operation of the wound and four stitches later and I'm leaving the hospital.

Why didn't I buy the helmet immediately after the first incident?
I guess I thought the crash wasn't a usual type and the next one would be saved by my running plan.

Believe me, when you crash unexpectedly, there's no time to run.

I know its just another "buy a helmet" story, but it has to be said again.

Here's the pic of my head after the A&E visit.

I know, a pic before the stitches would have been better but I wasn't in the mood.
Note the flecks of flesh in my hair.
You could have slid a small coin under the flap before it was stitched down.

Come on guys, I was lucky......twice.

This is my helmet which I wear every trip.

Apart from this, I am really enjoying my board.
It has performed flawlessly.
I'll update again in the near future.

Cheers for now,
Andy.

ps, If you ride without a helmet.........you're an idiot...........like me. :pensive:

glad you are ok!  I almost always wear a helmet, but the last few times i've forgotten either gloves or knee pads...  I'm trying to now wear knee pads as well as helmet and gloves after skinning both (still pretty fortunate).

Great build thread and gotta love the dell server PSU's!  I have a pair in series for 24v 50+ amps.  I run a few chargers off them, some limited 12v, others love 24v!  Great option vs the typical AC->DC PSU's for RC Hobby use.  

Appreciate you sharing the good and the bad!
