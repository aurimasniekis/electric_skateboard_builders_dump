What are people doing to get the focbox 3.5mm female bullet connector to connect to the 5.5mm female connectors on the 6374 190KV motors??

Thanks!!

Strip the heat shrink off the 3.5s, fill the 5.5 with solder, stick the end if the 3.5 in the solder. Works perfect.  Thank @longhairedboy for the tip ðŸ˜€.

you know what.. I think I just learned something.. depending on what company you buy the motor from will determine the connector type?? sorry im crazy new to all this and trying to learn

No worries, everyone is a noon at some.poi t. Just part of the process. 

The FocBox's have 3.5mm bullets because the hub motors enertion uses has 3.5mm bullets. Almost everyone else uses 5.5, but the 3.5 are good enough for 90% of the builds out there.

im super noob right now but im having a great time learning.. what do you think if I just soldered a 3.5mm male bullet connector to a 5.5mm male bullet connecter.. that should work right? so after soldered together it would just be able to slide right into each female ends

I'm not sure what you mean, I would just do it like I outlined above...fill the wire side of 5.5 with solder and pop the 3.5 in it while it's hot.  Then reapply heat shrink. 

Or you could talk to @GrecoMan or @scepterr, either one could make the adaptors you need.

Sorry to revive an old thread but I have the same issue on my current first build.

@Danny414 what did you end up doing? I don't think my 3.5mm bullets fit in my 5.5mm bullets. I can strip the heatshrink off the 3.5mm bullets but I don't think it'll make it fit, the heatshrink is very thin on the foxbox wires.

@mmaner I think he means to solder the 2 male heads together (should this be done with wire inbetween or without) and use it as an adapter basically, which i was thinking of doing too because then it is more modular and easier to take out if necessary.

Why not only to change the connectors on your motor cables to 3.5.
No need to touch the focbox, no lose of warranty ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜‚
Crazy that the warranty will end if you change the bullet connectors.

I ended up soldered them together to make an adapter.. I just did that because I didnâ€™t want to void any possible warranty with the motor controller or motors if they failed. It worked out great. That was months ago and Iâ€™ve had no problems

Ok I think I'll try this, did you put wire in between them or no? 

@Andy87 I'd rather avoid changing anything on the motor wires or focbox wires to not have any issues with warranties 

@SeanHacker I don't understand what you did sorry can you explain. You stripped the ends of the focbox then just soldered them into the female connectors on the motor?

Nope, no wire.. I had to bend some of the end of one of them off so it sits flush against each other.. I just used flux and it worked great!

You can cut off the 3.5's. Strip the wire. Solder on the size bullets you need to use. Done deal. Very easy.

Looks good! I'll probably go with that, just need to find somewhere to get bullet connectors quickly haha, build is almost done and don't want to wait ages for Chinese shipments.

Thanks for the help everyone

Might cut away the 3.5mm connector and solder a 5.5mm instead. The lesser bulk, the cleaner, and better...! Right? :thinking:

It voids the warranty for the focbox. If you don't care about that then ya by all means its probably the best solution

Nothing special, don't have much experience its my first build. Going to make a thread when its complete probably, have a single drive using the mech. kit from diyelectric, focbox, 6355 190kv torqueboard motor, and i have 4 3s 5000mAh lipos which im going to do either 6s2p, 9s or 12s 

Tbh i just want it to work for my first build, not too worried about getting crazy speeds .

In case anyone else runs into this, I found a potential solution while I wait for my 3.5mm bullet connectors to come from china. The ends of my multimeter leads (the part that plugs into the jacks on the multimeter) fit perfectly inside the 3.5mm focbox connectors with a solid seal. I just cut the end of the wires and soldered it into the 5.5mm female connectors and i have a working adapter, which kinda 90's but you can just turn your focbox to line it up. 

Will post a pic later.

@hillripper21 can you post this pic? Im running into the same issue and bought the smaller 5.5MM connectors by accident with the intention of replacing the focbox.

![phase_wires|374x499](upload://xVDP4y0mP8zCOBHXJrhpATTFA1k.jpg)

Here's a pic, so just cut the test leads after the 90 degree plastic parts and solder the 5.5mm bullet onto it. Then the ends fit snuggly on the 3.5mm connectors from the FOCBOX and can easily be disconnected too.

I made 6 x short 3.5mm to 5.5mm cables so I don't void the warranty on the Focbox.

What are some of the products people use to make the motor plugs one 'solid' unit? I can't find a picture of what I mean, but so it's just two separate plugs, similar to how an xt-xx plug is, but for the phase wires :)

MT60 MR60 connectors are like XT60 connectors and are 3 pin. The 3.5mm connectors on the Unity attach to those connectors.

I don't know what you are asking. If you are asking is there a 3-pin connector in the style of the XT60 that has 5.5mm bullets integrated, then I don't think so.

If you get a 5.5mm and 3.5mm set of bullets, you will find that the wire side of the male 3.5mm bullet can be forced into the wire side of the 5.5mm female bullet. Then just hit them with some solder. I do not believe that anyone makes these, or at least I canâ€™t find them.

I don't remember, but the gauge was decided based on the smaller bullet connector (3.5mm). Whatever the thickest that fits in the 3.5mm (It's either 12 of 14).
