Hello all, this is my first build and I wanted to get a sanity check on my parts

Belt - Not sure what size I should use?
2x Vesc or FOCBOX, depending on the enertion sale
My battery situation is TBD, but i have acces to a spot welder so I am thinking of building my own 18650 pack, should I do 12s or 10s? I am still researching batteries.

Thank you!

Im suggesting 10s since you are close to 60k erpm with 190kv at 12s, but you have focboxes so it should work
