Hey Guys,

for my Jacob Hubs I wanted to have a stealthy deck cut out of 15mm plywood.
My plan was to have a raptor style lid on the top for easy access to the battery and dual VESCs.

The lid was supposed to be done in 4mm plywood and the enclosure also in 15mm - bringing the total thickness to 30mm for the deck. I pictured the enclosure to be glued to the deck. Deck dimensions are 80x24cm.

Since I have never done something like this and only recently found out about "unpressed" flat plywood decks (see http://imgur.com/a/Mjodj) my experience is very limited and I was hoping someone might be able to help me in finding weak spots in the design before I have this actually milled. For example I have no clue if the deck will be able to hold my weight (70kg) with so much wood removed.

Top and bottom view: Included is a 10S3P Liion battery made out of two 5S modules.

super difficult to tell. the only ones with real experience when it comes to that kind of construction is @chaka and @evoheyax 

I would probably try to make the lower "enclosure" part of the board - with wood -> carbon/gfk in a solid epoxy connection to the board frame.

the markups look beautiful. But if you want strength, you need to press veneers. The beauty of pressing is that you can press concave also. My first decks were flat tops. No concave feels very weird, and even going 20 mph on such a deck feels really strange. 

My channel design is exactly identical. From what I found, the other way to do this is to have a few "base" layers, which provide the fundamental support of the board. These layers have no center cut out, and are the foundation of the board. The hollow layers do provide quite of bit of support, but maybe only 40% or less. The base provides at least 60% of the support, and with out them, I had issues with cracking.

You might be able to get away with this design if you epoxy the piece that sticks out on the bottom to the frame, as @whitepony said. You might break on that middle frame piece though.

It also depends on the wood you use too. You want canadian maple or birtch.

There's only one way to find out, which is to make it and try. You'd be surprised by the strength you can get (at least I was with my deck).

Walnut is even stronger than maple . Maybe use a few layers of it where you need extra strength.

Oh and it is beech plywood now - not birch

Well looks like I did not account for all the cable thickness and plugs.
Will be a really tight fit and I probably have to replace the VESC capacitor board wires.

hello Maxid, really like your deck and I do hope that it works out. 

Regarding thickness, I've fallen into the same trap when doing an ABS enclosure for one of my builds. Made it too thin. :-( 

How deep is your room for the electronics, inside measurements?

Would laminating a few layers of fiberglass on the top and or bottom of something like this help keep the thin board but add the strength it needs?

There are several boards that do top, so I feel like it makes some sense to someone to do it.
It wouldn't be much more weight then what a thicker board would be would it?

The reason why you don't do top is because the forces that occur there cause compression - and added gfk will not help for compression. Underneath the deck you have tension and that is where carbon or gfk can help much better. Adding something on top increases the weight while not helping at all in regards of strength or stiffness.
```

Lol then why did @onloop carbon fiber the top and bottom of his raptor 2 deck. Fiber glass is a very light material and adds strength no matter on bottom or top. Compression forces are the same on the top aand bottom of the deck

On the top of the deck, you have compression forces and on the bottom, you have tension forces.
Bottom part is expanding when bending while the top part is compressing.
It's very simple physics. gfk or cf won't help a lot on the top of the board or anything that flexes the way our boards do.

No trust me I understand the differences between tension and compressive forces. I still would like to do more research on this but if you are using a fiberglass (or carbon fiber) cloth, the woven kind not the matt, it has a high compression threshold. We use the stuff to make wings all day long and yes I agree underneath the wing is subject to tensile forces, but the top is also subjected to huge compression loads. And the stiff holds up great! I know the aviation grade stuff is a different weave pattern as well as density. But on compression loads the resin takes most of the load, where the glass takes the tensile loads. 

I would like to gather some actual test numbers on this as well as what compression loads do on a laminated surface (like one of our boards). Let me look around for a bit and Ill see what I can find.

But until I can find some of that, I actually put 3 layers on the top of my vanguard which was already covered in a fiberglass material until I sanded it off. And there was a noticeable difference with the flex of the board. Before I removed it, after I removed it, and again stiffer after I put my own on it after I installed my wires. Im not completely convinced yet. I would also like to see what the weight of what the extra thickness would weigh verses the top glassed verses the top and bottom glassed. I doubt it would be substantial of a difference.

[/quote]

Exactly why you do not need the carbon layer in the first place - pure resin would do a better job. So why even bother to add carbon on top when it is much better suited for bottom. In a wing it is different as you have forces bending the wing down (gravity) or up depending on the lift. In a deck top makes no sense and is a waste of time and money. Putting the same carbon on the bottom will give you much better results compared to top. Maybe @whitepony can gives us a better insight and share his knowledge.

Not sure what the right thing to do is now.
Remove more material? Also I would like some ideas for the motor cable routing. Just drill some holes in the enclosure part or do @longhairedboy style channels on top?

I see what you're saying. But that would be assuming it only has compression acting on it. If there is any bit of bouncing you introduced tension so it's not something you can do without. I still agree both sides are the best. i just think for me the jury is still out on a top lamination as being an actual structural feature and not just moot. 

If anyone else has some insight on the matter I would love to hear it.

if you are a street skater, than you would know a few companies have been playing around with carbon fiber on decks. Girl/Chocolate skateboards have been making these decks they call "pop secret" with a layer of carbon fiber on the top, and I have ridden at at least 20 of them over the last year or so. They do have a bit better of a pop (which is irrelevant on an eboard), but they also are much harder to snap in half. Many times, I have stomped nose and middle of the board down this massive 3 block hubba at my local skate park, and most of the time, it doesn't break. When I skate blank decks or even other pro decks without the carbon fiber on top, they break every time when I stop stomp nose and middle of the board.

So from my experience, the carbon fiber on the top does add strength. I get the whole tension/compression force dynamic, but it does have an effect still.

My 2 cents in this though is that you shouldn't "need" to re-enforce the board with composite materials. I've found that if you press your own deck with veneers, not only can you put whatever concave you want into the deck, but you can achieve incredible strength.

If your doing this for just 1 or 2 boards for your self, this is very easy to do with a roar rocket vacuum press kit. Total cost would be around $200 USD for all the tools you need and if you buy a few decks worth of wood, around $50 per deck in wood and another $30 in glue per board.

Putting the same carbon on the bottom will give you much better results compared to top.

think this is close to a myth. tensile vs. compressive strength of epoxy fiberglass composite is pretty much identical. for carbon its midly in favour for tensile strength. so if you put it top or bottom wont matter very much!

Made a little progress today. I decided that I don't want to glue the enclosure to the deck as I might need to have full access later on and also just want that flexibility. I used screwed inserts and countersunk screws. Since my goal is maximum stealth I thought about how to hide the motor wires. Decided on drilling a hole in the truck baseplate. Next is probably going to be a channel on the bottom of the deck in which the wires are placed. The idea is then to cover that channel with a 3mm thick carbon fiber plate by sinking it into the deck (similar to the lid on top) and use the existing screws from enclosure and truck to hold it in place. That way I can still access the wires and the carbon fiber could compensate the loss of wood in the deck.

@Ackmaniac and @jacobbloy: in the manual that came with the motors it says to change the Observer Gain value to something between 60 and 100 - I set it to 80 now.
The BLDC-Tool calculation however only returned something like 13. Do you know what happens when I change that number?
