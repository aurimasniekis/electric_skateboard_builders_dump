Hey folks,

https://www.instagram.com/p/BqX1KqaBHq0/

I'm chasing time, everyday some good things happen, but some stupid stuff too. That's why I chase time.

I sold all my street boards and really wanted to support the HAYA project. I'm proud to be one of the guys that got one at home. But well, what I'm gonna do with it. I thought about it as I already got through most of styles and I decided to go for a street racer. Well, an insane street racer.

I will post photos of course and update accordingly. It's night here in Paris.

I already got 
- Haya deck
- RKP Surf-Rodz 200mm 45¬∞ baseplate & 60mm axles
- Bears 10mm bearings
- My UNiK wheel pulleys. 32T

I'm going for a dual mount of course, probably dual rear. I will redesign my mounts accordingly.

For the motors, 6374 would be a strong choice, maybe better than 6355.... Probably 12S4P with Unity.

Well, that's where I am. Help me to make this board a street rocket and give your opinions.

Cheers !

If the truck length has space for dual 6374 go for it!

yeah, I'm not that familiar with SR RKP @psychotiller but 200mm seems short for a dual sealed sensored 6374. Option remaining would be to go for dual diagonal but that's less sexy, or find out if I cannot go for longer axles (I have 60mm so far)

When you account for the extra width the 80mm or even 90mm axles the surfrodz use, there's more than enough room.

with the mounts on the hanger, you end up with 196mm of space between the mount plates for motors. How many motors that we use are longer than 98mm?

Back to the wheel choice. If this baby is for racing, it may deserve some better shoes to honor the DH scene. What about 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwOC2Pw-7yw

or Seismic Speed Vents 85mm

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDiAafqU-CQ

What ya think? of course, I'll design the pulleys from scratch too to match the wheel pattern, which will also incluse a bearing in the pulley... possible with the 80mm axles I assume. A 15T/30T which equals to 2:1 with 78mm wheels on 12S on 190kv will give me minimum 50km/h weighted and 55km/h with 85mm wheels.

I'm also going to order the cells at my NKON.NL. 12S4P, well 50 cells more or less. Probably VTC 2600mAH / 30A. Any advices here to ? That would give me a 10.4AH pack on 12S.

@chaka you are one of the knowledgable real world DH riders, any advices from your side ?

Ok so I just spoke with my friends that DH all over the world one is a  pro rider for landy and they say right now they feel the magnums are the fastest wheel on the market but seismic has the record so that is what i got from my boys ..they say those are great pics for a solid grippy fast wheel but magnums seem to be the more popular choice for the racers..cheers okp

yeah Roman. How many teeth are we looking here ? 32T ? 30 ? As I will start everything from scratch, I'm open to anything. We just need to avoid going too big, as we need to keep some clearance due to the 78mm wheels. 

32T was fine with my Amhyo Akasha's but happy to get something different done if that's more relevant.

This goin to be super cool build. Sickboards are awesome, they are fast in every ways. So you'll be using surfrodz trucks now, i bet you'll desiging great motor mount for that üòã. I also waiting my rkp to come but surfrodz still on vacation üòÅ. I will try to make mount for them later, kinda lazy tho, the hanger profile kinda hmmm üòÖ. Any chance Unik will selling them in near future? i might just grab some üòâ.

Lights up in the dark. Useless but I like useless details ! 

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsh8jWdh9PR/

80mm axles seems very large (requires 3 spacers). 60mm probably too short. So I may end of for 70mm. Guys, I still don't know what to do for the motors on this. Thoughts? Dual Diagonal ? Dual Rear 6374? 

These are 50 cells.

yeah, that's also what I was thinking of. My very first board was dual diagonal and it was a monster for the time being

It's to wide okp for the DH crowd but this is where motors come a issue.. surfrodz really isn't a DH inspired truck either..like @chaka and his dh inspired builds are small hangers and diagonal motors  ..Most of us run a 150 mm to a 176mm hanger max .. a 160mm is the sweet spot with the venom mags will be perfect width but only with diagonal drive tho .I'm trying to get a mount made for the new Aera rf1 truck made by Kevin Reimer and Powell Peralta.. absolutely amazing trucks.. check them out please.. every skater I talk to from DH to trick bowl ripping says these trucks are freaking awesome.. and I'm really hoping you will sell some venom pully adapters in your store with your sweet core mounts. I need those venoms mach 1 for my triple beem DH build I'm planning this year. watching this build big time I love it .. if you ever build off aera I would love some mounts to please and thank you for this sweet build..I know my friends skatboardshop would love some of these to sell as we are entering the electric skate world in Canada .
Cheers

Hey man ! thanks a lot for the feedback. There are toooo many options and getting something universal for some parts is going to be a challenge.

So far, I got only Surf Rodz here to play. One DH rider in France recommends me to go for a dual rear because at higher speeds it is better... I can build whatever you/we need or dream of. That's why I created UNiK ! 

I ordered also 70mm axles. So I got a full bunch of possibilities. 

For the MACH 1, I'm on it. Just need to figure out where to put the bearing (i.e the more close to the hanger, the more the mount will have to move, the less I need axle space. I guess it's gonna be trial and error.

That's awesome. Thanks okp I'd love to get another truck available for ppl to try @topcloud can voice a bit I hope. these area trucks I speak of are the BOMB..aera is amazing dh trucks and Powell wouldn't put there name on something that wasn't up to par. The best of all they are not 500 bucks to buy a pair either..they are 90 bucks. 
forged cold steel super strong and lighter then most precision aluminum trucks they are the real deal guys.
As for the set up I'm not familiar with the diagonal front and back myself but I am building one to try as I don't like my trucks wide the speed wobbles are by far more agressive to get ahold of on my foot shifting  so I'm limited I was thinking duel rear diagonal maybe but it won't be pretty looking ..I know Chaka does the front and back and he rips his boards and makes the weight evenly distributed throughout the deck with the weight of his motors I think this plays a big roll .. my carvon v4 speed drives are scary at high speed corners as my falcon i built every thing was in the middle to the back its very ASS heavy Corning was sketchy at higher speeds when the board would slip it was harder to hold on too.. I rebuilt the board moved all the electronics up to the front of the deck well it actually feels lighter but it isn't and the Corning is by far nicer and when it slides I'm not sliding a whale in ice as much..just some things I've learned..but I'm lighter then the average bear I lean to forward and it will do burnouts at 35mph too on full throttle launch with 100amp to each motor .. this is where I think front and back might play  better..Iwish @chaka would chime in. 
if you need any information DH skate gear my friends would love to help you I can pm you there email he is starting to get convinced the electric world is coming we just need to use the real tryed and tested skatboard gear not this clone stuff they throw there nose up at it ..

@Frenchy is right about Aera being the new thing :slight_smile:  

a local has those gold Aera RF-1 Freerides (180MM / 46¬∫) on a Tan Tien and she swears by them.  

RF-1 Carves could be ideal for a single / single, I agree.

Super-stoked for the MACH 1 :dark_sunglasses: I predict UNIK will have a hit bringing these to esk8:

To sum up:

- FR (Freeride) - 46Àö bases - 180mm Width - 90a Bushings

Thanks boys ..ok so I've been thinking you can buy the area k5 lengthend axel to help with more pully play. I was gonna try the 176 dh with the longer Axel's from the k5. But I have a vendor that I can get parts from this might be harder for the average bear..unless you order right from area yourself

ehhe yeah me too :) this should be pretty decent. In terms of spacers, to ensure we got a tight end to end fit 

from external wheel bolt towards hanger 

bolt > 6mm bearing > 10mm spacer internal bearing > 6mm bearing > 10mm spacer > 6mm bearing > 1mm spacer

and we're good.

yeah, so far I got Surf Rodz RKP, so I'm going to use them. 

In terms of space on the hanger axle, I would need (thread not counted) 6 + 10 + 6 + 10 + 1 mm = 33mm.

I could reduce this it a bit more by pushing the internal pulley bearing closer to the wheel bearing on the inside but I'm going to test it like that.

Well I have some area rf1 and some area k5 with extended axels that are about 45mm and I have the e caliber sitting around with a 47mm axel so  I was verifying that any truck with 14+mm axel from the stock length at 35mm should work

I have not decided it yet.

Go 4wd problem solved. 

For looks only rwd I think is the way to go. 

fwd might be better in certain situations just like rwd is.

I was thinking with the area rf1 because they are much smaller then the surfrods.With the DH 176mm I was gonna go duel ying yang style single front and rear.. as I've learned from high power rear wheel will spit you sideways when loosing traction in a corner under throttle I don't have this problem with my high powered one wheel ..it will spin but won't throw me sideways like a muscle car does..or hit a crack or bump full throttle in a tuck on the front truck  and it will spit you sideways or the big wheels start bouncing in the back ..wheel hop then spits you sideways..so far I'm thinking front and rear with 150 or 170kv for more torque for bigger gears and 12s is just under the 60k rpm..I think 190 kv is over 60k erpm at 12s .. 18t motor and 32t with 78 mm wheels this should get me close to 60kmh  35 mph area I think

@Eboosted these wheels will be very nice on your  moonshine sidekick. These are my plans too for my outlaw or another sidkick because I can't stop buying them most versatile short long board I've tryed to date..you can street skate the shit out of it and do 35mph on the same super soft set up and 50degrees plates..  @okp Alan has 176 surfrodz on his sidekick build if you wanted to see how much play between the two different sizes of trucks .. me personally enjoy a smaller 150 to160mm size truck it's much easier to keep stable also by far grippier and faster going into and out of corners.

very first prototype render, measuring everything using the idea that the system is made of two parts and one of them is pushed as the base (inspired by lrdesigns).

http://www.e-sk8.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OKP_SURF2.png

This is super early prototype. I may also add idlers as an option. 

I've also added a 1mm "guard" but don't know if that make sense or just use extra space. I always use minimalism as the baseline of my parts, so maybe this is too much for me.

I added the idlers option. Just two additional threaded holes in M6. I may have to lower down the holes.

Once I got the mount and base printed, I'll adjust the mount because I want to have a perfect pulley alignement.

Can't tell from the image but are the tops of the teeth at the same level as the mount? I think it leaves the belt a little exposed, personally I prefer mount to hit concrete rather then belts - clearance on mounts  was the biggest issue I found with my 76mm wheels build
```

## \#106 Posted by: okp Posted at: 2019-03-03T10:03:24.015Z Reads: 210

yes. 

With 76mm wheels it's always the challenge. But you're right, I've not mentioned it but the "circle" of the mounts is a bit larger than the 32T pulley with belts but still have a proper clearance. Good thing is here I'm starting from scratch and this will be made out of AL7075 so I expect them to be strong too.

Just added the other mount for the dual 6374. Well it fits. Next step is to fit the idlers and we're good to go.

Update of the day. I've revisited some stuff which include the "snap in" part after getting the 3D printing parts. I've beefed up some areas and also re engineered the areas to host the idler bolts.![04|690x441](upload://73MH5a7wrZkObdAZ3G8ZfeZ0V5R.png) ![25|690x454](upload://yVDG5qRHfjTlObGaRj7f8Qs5Gll.png) ![03|690x429](upload://lJ28r0qIz82WXbxH9plO0EY31yH.png) ![20|690x425](upload://rlNDYh5TeajHwE8q5m86Sd9RvS3.png) ![34|690x366](upload://xWXGZjb35OumwY1LSVeYKEWryQu.png) ![49|690x376](upload://gWSp93vX2sOk0uyTkKL2vDBDypp.png)

Are you considering a link or bars across between the mounts?

hey ! I can do anything, adding a bar like on my street mounts is super easy but the distance need to be perfect.

How many pulleys do you all need so I can start asking a quote to the supplier? could someone start to prepare a list on a shared spreadsheet ?

Thanks!

Good point. Length should hopefully match across the 200mm SR RKP trucks - supposed to be precision...
I‚Äôm keen to run dual 6374 as you have planned. Wheels just ordered.  Assuming cost isn‚Äôt crazy, would be keen for 2 pulleys (and mounts etc). Don‚Äôt know how to set up a shared online spreadsheet, sorry. Cheers!

Looks like the mounts only work with the 200mm rkp‚Äôs? You think they‚Äôll work on the 176s?

I think I want a set of pulleys and mounts, but it's heavily price dependent! ;)

I have PT mounts, but if he‚Äôs making some for his pulleys I want in, just want to make sure they‚Äôll fit on the 176s before I commit to the mounts too

Hi I'm pretty green to electric skateboards but I'm definitely interested in getting a set of motor mounts for aera rf-1's. Not tryna downgrade my trucks to calibers after I've been riding aera for months.

I've been trying to get area mounts forever..ppl don't know what real top quality trucks can do for a rider..ppl rather have the cheap here..
Hopefully okp comes back with something..

hey ! last days, weeks, months have been exhausting. I just don't have time to do all I want to achieve. The build is on standby. I need to find money to pay for the prototyping and I don't want to kickstart or play with people money without being sure I'll be able to deliver in time/quality.

I'm actually revisiting my plate holder and ESC BOX for the mountainboard deck I'm riding. Got a lot of messages from people that want to have this for their build.

Stay tuned.
