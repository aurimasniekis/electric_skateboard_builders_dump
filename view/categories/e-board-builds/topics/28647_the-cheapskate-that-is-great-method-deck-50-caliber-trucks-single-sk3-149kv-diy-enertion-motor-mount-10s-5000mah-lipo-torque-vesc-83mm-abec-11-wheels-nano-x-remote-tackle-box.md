I live in Raleigh so we have plenty of hills and this cheap setup does not disappoint. Ive been having a lot of fun the last week with this simple setup and just wanted to share for the people that want a simple setup.

Get about 8 miles with hills and come back with 3.84 per cell. Top speed so far was 22 mph which I think is about the Limit for my 16/36 gearing. Had about a 400ft elevation change this ride. Click on the picture to see more info.

Can't really compare them per say. My buddy rode mine the other day and was really impressed. He owns a boosted and he couldn't believe how much power I have just from the one motor. Mine was also faster then his boosted board. I'm definitely happy with how this board came out and wouldn't think twice about buying a boosted. Grant it I need to make a custom enclosure and tidy everything up to give it a more aesthetic appeal like the boosted. Really I think the boosted is over priced and I'd  rather build a diy dual for the money. Boosted is nice if you want a non fuss board but after a while you realize the power and speed you want is not there, IMO.
