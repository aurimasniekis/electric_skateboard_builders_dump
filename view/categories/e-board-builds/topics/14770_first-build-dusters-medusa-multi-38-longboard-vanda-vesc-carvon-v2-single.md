Hi guys, I decided to build my electric skateboard last weekend and was surprised that I can finish my first board within 3 hours.

Here are technical details for my board:
3x LiPO battery (5400 mAh/11.1V/30c)
1x Vanda Electronics VESC with custom wires & connectors
1x  Cable assembly for between battery and VESC
1x  Carvon v2 single
1x Dusters MEDUSA Multi 38" Longboard
1x RC Controller

Let’s start running the photos: 

Bye bye to my bare board

Very nice simple build Karen. Good job. I like hub motors especially to be able to use a double drop deck. After you have run it a few times I would be curious to hear the actual range you are getting. Can you report back later? Guessing 10 miles or 16-18kms?

Just checked out your Team and gotta say:

That is not something the Quality Control guy should be saying ;)

I'm about to buy a Vesc and looking at your site, Vanda Electronics.  How is your Vesc holding up?  Any issues?  I'm also wondering why only one capacitor where other brands use three?

Hello Malibujv, 

We have zero defect and zero return from our customers. In addition, we use Panasonic Leaded 2200UF 63V NHG-A. Our single capacitor is rated to 2200uF. Other brands typically used 3x650uF or 2x1000uF. As a result, we have more capacitance than other brands.
