Hi! I thought I would share my latest project of a all-wheel drive electric skateboard with 3D printed tires. I'm super happy with the performance and the fact that it was able to go off-road the way it did is quite surprising!

I used one entire Landwheel board + one drive kit, and that is a total of 4 hub motors. With the batteries invidually going to each drive it managed to stay awake quite long, but the sub-zero temperature didn't help.

Dude well done...it would be great for someone to design and sell larger wheel sleeves for different types of hub motors. The old hummies i have would be a prime candidate due to the shape of it's can and outer mounting plate

Carvon Torquedrive seems to be usable for pneumatics and I would say they're about the same power ability

How did you attach the printed wheels? Friction fit only?

Awesome job with all of it. Hose wheels turned out great. I‚Äôm actually amazed they held on throughout the whole ride without slipping

@RCLifeOn

Simon:

Amazing project.  The beta testers who tested the landwheels over the past two years would love to have you join our private forum.  We sent you an invite.  We'd love to have you in our ranks.

Subscriber for a long time, nice to see you here @RCLifeOn :slight_smile:
There were couple of posts here about 3D printed wheels but none held well over the prolonged period of time. Curious to see how yours end up after a while. I'm also really amazed they haven't just slipped out, you weren't going easy on them!

It was quite interesting. It was fun throughout watching the video. The electric boards on the snow are fun and exciting, but they are more anxious with the anxiety.![20171210_104654~01|620x500](upload://20BSWDmyBA21VyUwFT5SPT3FFH7.jpg)

I'm just waiting to see if anyone figures out how to pair a single remote to two landwheel drive systems... that would be sick.

Split ppm should work if you can get access to the ESC.

Brilliant! I have been wondering if it was possible to convert a standard board into an off road by just slipping larger wheels onto the standard ones, I even looked on ebay to see if any such thing was being sold. I didn't watch the video all the way through (I'm at work) but do the printed wheels just slip on, or did you have to fix them somehow with adhesive?

In this case they just slip on

@RCLifeOn  What the material is? On the video you said "some cheap flexible filament". I have got the same idea spinning on my head every now and then, but i have worried that how the tire survives on the wheel.
It appears to be very tightly on the wheel, judging from the fast forward on hammering it in :smiley:

I'm going to do the same! But when i know the material :stuck_out_tongue:

Split PPM likely will not work.  I tired it on an older landwheel.  The two ESC's fought for bluetooth control of the reciever.  The power (wheel speed) cycled back and forth between the two drives.  When I reversed the wireing to original, The reciever that I tried to ppm recievers would no longer connect to a remote. 

Two remotes is the only solution for now but it works very well.

You can find another dual remote mounting method at the end of this video at time index 16:05.  No 3D printing is required.  Just a bit of foam tape and a small amount of flat plastic stock.

Wait what? Does Landwheel use bluetooth between the transmitter and receiver?? Just that would scare the shit out of me.

Why?  Boosted board is blue tooth.  Its a secure pairing.  Only one device can connect to a drive and vice versa. There is a pairing process that requires button pushes on both the remote and the drive.

Hmm.. I have always thought that when there is a lot of bluetooth "traffic" (Like in a big city) the connection can be very bad, and even get lost..

i'm with @pkasanda on this one. I use this board in Boston every day and I have never had issues with the connection. I've had more problems with a 2.4 ghz controller with my single 6374 belt drive. EDIT: I replaced the screws on my landwheel and used a threadlocking compound. DON'T DO THIS: it damaged the plastic housing causing it to break. If you already have, ask landwheel for a new enclosure and don't ride your board until you replace it. for those who still need to replace the screws, just screw them in dry- don't add anything else and it should hold up just fine.

How have these sleeves held up after all this time? I'm super interested in attempting something like this!
