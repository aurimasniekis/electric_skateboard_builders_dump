For filming this video.  Full face seems more appropriate.  Anyone have one that could be rented or borrowed?  I actually like my half-helmet a lot and just want to use it for filming.

Medium head but kinda long n narrow.  Or maybe we get hot wearing it in the vid.

When are you wanting to do the filming? I have a medium tsg pass but itâ€™s a bit snug on my head and your taller than me, so you probably have a larger head.

Over here by my pad they close off a nice portion of golden gate park to cars so it would be a great place to get some footage.
