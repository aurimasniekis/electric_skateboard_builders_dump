Well been working on tuning and modifying this board and feel it is now dialed in.

Parts List:
--------------
Trucks - Ground Industries 
Deck - Ground Industries
Wheels -  2 sets MBS Rockstar (one for slicks, one for nobbies) 
Tyres - Kenda 200x50 
Motors - TB 6374 190kv
VESC - Focbox
Battery - 10s5p
Enclosure - full welded aluminum 
Heatsink - bolted through enclosure to Focbox's

I am currently running slicks with 16x72 gearing with 15mm belts. The low-end is real strong and pulls hard...had to tune the throttle curve because of so much torque.  The board tops at about 31 MPH and is very stable. The board is made tough and is ridden hard in all weather.....

Hi, were did you buy the mounts for those trucks? I am looking into the different decks option for MTB and that one looks good.
