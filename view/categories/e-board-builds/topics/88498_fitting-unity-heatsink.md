Help required please! 
I just received the heatsink for the unity and I can‚Äôt work out how to fix it to my deck I‚Äôve noticed that it‚Äôs got threaded holes for mounting it but I‚Äôm struggling to find out what bolts to use and size etc, do I need to fit inserts into my deck ? Any help much appreciated 
Thanks bobby

Thanks for the information I‚Äôve managed to suss it out THANKS EVERYONE PROBLEM RESOLVED 
I finally decided to cut out the enclosure and have the fins exposed for a better installation, just a matter of setting up a jig with a 4mm offset and using a router with a 15mm guide bush , just waiting on some m3 machine screws and the battery & deck then it‚Äôs all systems go

Nice. I also order this heatsink. Just waiting for it now
What machine you used too get that perfect cut ?

Well I‚Äôm still waiting for the battery and board but I‚Äôve got the heatsink and unity mounted, I ended up routing out the fibreglass enclosure to fit the heatsink and I fitted it with m3 stainless steel screws and green anodised countersunk washers so they match the green wheels and il do the same to fit the enclosure once the board arrives

That button is very, very exposed to being knocked off mid ride by anything flicked up leaving you liable to injury, another member broke his leg in the last few days from just that, seriously consider moving it?

Hey mate, what deck is that, an evo? If so what enclosure did you use, I'm going down a similar route, and like the look of the enclosure, do you know how deep it is?

Please replace the button with one which requires 5 second hold to switch or glue some kind of a cage around it. It will 100% get turned off. Dont break your leg like i did its not worth not fixing

The unity switch is fine. You can select your own time that you must push the switch to power on or off.

I know stupid question maybe but is that bigger button a anti spark switch ? Reason for asking is because I wanted too do that for insurance for the unity.

Hi manny, to be honest I‚Äôm not sure I know the unity has an anti spark built in it‚Äôs my first build so I‚Äôm just sort of plugging and playing at the moment I‚Äôm slowly getting an idea of how things go but I‚Äôm pretty much a true beginner, hopefully someone will see the post and comment, it‚Äôs a good job I posted the pictures otherwise I‚Äôd of been in potential danger, so a big thanks to the guys who took the time to comment , thanks everyone for your help and support

You'll have to bypass/take out that eswitch otherwise it wouldn't solve the problem because it would still need to be turned on for the board to be on

You should have one of the following...doesn't matter which but antisparks are not reliable
- e-switch
- antispark
- loopkey
- integrated esc antispark

Sorry, more detail here. Im out jogging, trying to be helpful after an otherwise unhelpful comment I made above. If all this is confusing, I‚Äôll send better labeled pictures of each one of those options listed above. 

The unity eswitch is pretty high quality compared to every other switch that you plug directly into the esc. It is a momentary switch, meaning there isn‚Äôt an actual latching mechanism that could accidentally get unlatched. 

This switch and circuits on the esc it‚Äôs self comprise a soft e-switch (right?). If you were going to ship it, you would probably want to interrupt the circuit more definitively, by physically removing part of the circuit; a loopkey does this perfectly. 

There are some electronic switches that have similar on/off buttons like the unity button, but they have a separate circuit board that sits in between the battery and the esc. These are notorious for failing. 

You can short two of the pins of the on/off button wires from the esc (both unity and flipsky 6.6) and remove the e-switch functionality all together. 

I do this because I have 4wd. I‚Äôd trust the unity switch if I only had one esc to worry about. but I‚Äôd still have a back up loopkey hidden somewhere. 

![image|385x500](upload://wrSowYXMwwlsdoaR0nkXOpXEXsI.jpeg) 

I am aware it is possible to wire up many ESCs to one eswitch, I just don‚Äôt need that mess in my deck.

Thanks for a great response but forgive my ignorance are you saying I don‚Äôt need the switch on the unity or is it the rocker type battery switch I‚Äôve installed and is a potential hazard that I can remove

The unity comes with its own switch. Use that one, it is good. It is reliable and feels more solid than any other switch I have used.

Sure, you could extend them. If you don‚Äôt do a lot of soldering, you could get/make/buy an extension cable.

I don‚Äôt know connector type and pitch off the top of my head, probs on a pdf spec sheet online.

It will be a ‚ÄúJST‚Äù connector type. You get to hunt for the pitch (2.54mm?). 

Check out the official unity thread here, the 6th reply directly address the anti spark question. 

If I have a known connector laying around that fits I‚Äôll let you know when I get back from bars. 

Otherwise, google image , ‚Äújst connectors‚Äù and start going down the rabbit holes.

5 pin jst ph 2.0 mm pitch cable is what you need. 

Like this one, but you would still have to solder on one side.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come up with.. I‚Äôve fitted a m3 insert next to the switch then got a small thumb screw and a Pepsi bottle top to fit over the switch I‚Äôm just looking for a piece of ally or stainless to make a strap to hold the top in place, I‚Äôve fitted the enclosure with a 10mm rubber seal which works well giving more room for the battery and stopping vibrations ![image|375x500](upload://osNU0EmtADTkVOsB7TsT38LHg23.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://49V1sMC2uIMxtJvxs7Y2q6gfMZc.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://21uUqVKwWXfPbcPEX0cqQwphoqw.jpeg)
