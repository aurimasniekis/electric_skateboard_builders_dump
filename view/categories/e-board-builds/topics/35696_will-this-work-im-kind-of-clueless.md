I want to build an electric longboard and I would like to know if the parts I found will work. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/3/2321f8c488c65cb08184677494480c505906c4a9.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/0/302224b2aab7bc2be80721c7013e2b645104cb52.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/7/c73a18dea564d5b1d952be86499a3bdd13cfdc5a.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/5/75ce76d08293e24fa8147add6cb99d4f3a406cfd.jpg" width="281" height="500">

They will all work together, but that remote with that ESC is well known to be terrible and dangerous for signal dropouts.

Be careful of LG HG2 cells, especially from eBay.  There are tons of counterfeits out there, and it's very difficult to tell them apart from genuine cells.  I would avoid eBay and only buy from a place like Nkon

Good point @jmasta

@Verries use my filter tool to find the best configuration for your battery cells...

I can't buy from there because they don't ship to South Africa.

What from what source? Every Meepo, Backfire, and Riptide uses this ESC and remote. I haven't heard of any signal drops. Are you thinking of the winning v1 remote which looks similar?

@darkkevind What would be your suggestion for an affordable option that works?

Use  https://ru.nkon.nl/ for countries outside of EU

Seriously don't buy HG2s from eBay.  It's a big problem.  There's no way of knowing that you're getting legit HG2s. Sellers will supply genuine cells to early customers to build up positive reviews, and then start mixing in the fakes.  If you have to use eBay, go for a less-counterfeited cell like the Samsung 30Q

Im running those dual hubs and an Ebay esc on a nickel board. Wicked fun to rip to the liquor store on.

The remote with the eBay esc is fine and doesn't have any drop outs. I think @darkkevind mistook it for the winning remote

10 cells? Like 10 cells total?  That's not going to cut it with dual hub motors.  Most battery packs have 30-50 cells, or more. You need to run multiple cells in parallel to deliver enough current to power those hub motors

You're going to want at least 10s3p (30 cells total) or 10s4p (40 cells)
```

He could probs get away with a 10s2p pack since the hubs aren't very powerful. Also most clone boards use 2p as well.  @Verries what are the hills like where you live? If it's mostly flat you could scrape by with a 2p but if there's any hills you will need at least 3p
```

@jmasta I figured I would need 10s2p at the very least, but 40? That's way more than I can afford ðŸ˜®

Yes much cheaper. Have a look at hobbyking. Search for 5s 5000mah and put 2 in series

## \#21 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2017-10-17T06:11:32.199Z Reads: 55

Nope. A basic hobby charger like the IMAX B6 will do the trick. You can even use that bms you had if you want to although the amp rating is a little low

Is there maybe a bms with higher amp rating that you can recommend?

Well bestech or supower bms are very well recommended by others. you could try them and get a 60a bms
```

## \#25 Posted by: Verries Posted at: 2017-10-17T06:53:56.772Z Reads: 55

So if I do use a bms I just need an appropriate power source for it?

yes they can be bought for cheap from ebay, amazon or basically anywhere that sells them aslong as they have the right voltage. Have you decided on the battery you will use?

I found turnigy 5s batteries on ebay and an imax b6 at really good prices, so if that will be sufficient then that's what I'll go with.

Ok great. Just know that Lipo batteries need to be treated correctly otherwise they can be damaged easily. Also make sure that you always balance charge them and never discharge below 3.4v

Yes if you would like although a battery medic from hobbyking or eBay is even better. It will tell you voltages as well as balance and discharge your cells and it is very cheap. It won't charge though

remember if you increase the amount of batteries and voltage going to the BMS and ESC sometimes it cannot handle it. If youre going for an ESC like the one above, make sure your values are correct
