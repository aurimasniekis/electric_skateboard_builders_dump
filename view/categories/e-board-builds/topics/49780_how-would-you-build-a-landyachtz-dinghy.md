```
Purpose:

Lightweight City Cruiser
Can take a bit of punishment, specifically expansion gaps from bike paths
Speed is not a priority but at least 18mph
Can do uphills (90kg rider)

My Ideas so far:

A) 
Battery: 10s2p 30q
Motor: Carvon V4 TD
Front Truck: I don't know what's compatible with the TD
Wheels: ABEC 11s, I'm not sure what size is good to help with bumpy rides/shock absorption
ESC: FOCBox/TB/Maytech

B) Budget Friendly
Battery: 2x5s LiPos
Motor: Ownboard Hubs
Trucks: Ownboard Trucks
ESC: Ownboard ESC + remote
Pray to God shock pads are enough to dampen vibration from the expansion gaps

C)
Battery: 10s2p or 2x5 LiPos
Motor/Gearing: Single 6374 170kv 16/36
Trucks: Stick with the polar bears if a mount is available or use caliber ii
Wheels: ABEC 11,?
ESC: FOCBox,TB,Maytech


Any other ideas how this can work?

A or C, both of them are really nice :) I would personally go for C, just because I think Carvons on such a small board are bit overkill but it could end up in really sexy build :) Also C will be the lightest of all the options :) 

I plan on doing build like this one, but I dont have a need for so much power :O

Sorry for the weird pics. I am doing a dinghy right meow!  Im going 10s2p 190kv 6374 single.  I am acrually going to make the mold off that plug tomorrow.

I also used the shorter caliber trucks (160s vs 184s). Had to mod the hanger a bit to get enough clearance. But I think the size fits the build a bit better.![20180321_202249|281x500](upload://lMBDs90duRtgrgMDkUT1CrQ4HO6.jpg)

@Sender That's awesome! I'm going to use your build as a guide. Do the 184s look awkward on it? What is that mount you used?
```

even with the 160mm truck it still looks pretty wide so yes. The 180mm truck will look weird. 

@Sender how do you make your mold if you don't mind me asking. Like what material did you use.

@DeathByBacon I'm in the process of making a small cruiser that's relatively light. 29 in x 7.5 deck with kicktail. I use Paris truck originally for HUBs but TorqueBoard doesn't seem to know when they will get them so I just switch to chain-drive. If I have the money, I'd go for carvon HUBs. MBS wheels would be great IMO.

I made it out of foam and wood and then sprayed it with Duratec polyester primer.

And yes, IMO the 184s look a bit silly on the dinghy.

I haven't finished it yet. I was sick (fucking strep throat) this week. I am pretty sure it is because I was hammered on St Patties day and ate some random half eaten chicken wings from some strangers plate.  Or thats what my friends tell me at least ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

I need to get on it though because it is for my bambino and his birthday is april 4th!

If the enclosure looks good, I can make one for you because I now have a mold.

Not here to derail. But @Sender, I'm doing a build on an old Powell deck of much the same dimension as the dinghy. I would be interested in obtaining an enclosure possibly as well. There might be a small market for those wanting to do a smaller build needing a specific enclosure.

I love the dinghy. I wonder if you could squeeze 10s3p underneath it if you use carvons

For sure, it would just take a little layout tinkering.

If you can get some older ones sure, but youâ€™d probably get better user for something like v4â€™s with a larger deck

I agree with this. That would be a waste on this deck IMO.

Oh yeah! 

Thank you for all the Fiber glass/CF tips

Here is this other enclosure I made feom scratch and the deck it is going on.

Still need to finish it and add black glass frit to the top.

Going for a "Captain Phasma" look

![captain-phasma-armor|333x500](upload://6cGj6VtMIwgMX7YhpDKmgv127AH.jpeg)


The deck needs another round of sanding and epoxy, and I need to finish the bottom.

Where did you get that colored glass fiber sheet from and what thickness is that?
I wasn't able to get those nice corners, had to do sanding a lot.
This looks awsome!
Makes me wanna build one for my son too.

It is from a company called "Composite Envisions."  They have all sorts of cool stuff, and the cheapest prices I have found.

It is a CF/Kevlar hybrid.  PITA to work with kevlar. Hard to cut, and frays instead of sanding smooth like CF or fiberglass.  Just a warning.

Absolutely cracking job there. 
Looking at motorising a dinghy so should be interesting.

@ARetardedPillow Thatâ€™s the cells Iâ€™ve ordered. I was thinking of single 6374 but I could always break apart the most recent iteration of my hummie build and pinch the carvons. 
Might be a bit overkill.

The more overkill the better! I have those hubs set at 1500 watts each :grin: can drag race any production board cept for the few which are actually good. Also those 20700s are really nice, 10s2p gave me nearly 20 miles (not going slow and cruising, going up parking lots and bombing them etc)
