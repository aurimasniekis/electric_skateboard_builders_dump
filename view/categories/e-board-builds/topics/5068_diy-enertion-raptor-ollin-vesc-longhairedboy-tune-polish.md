I just wanted to share my recent build experience and first ride. First, the build:

1. Buy near complete enertion raptor components from a poor soul who gave up and sold for near half price on eBay. 
2. Invest hours on forums, learn how to solder, minor in EE, and start making. 
3. Burn up your VESC. 
4. Cry a little bit. 
5. Shelf project for 6 months. 
6. Get bored with current projects, buy Ollin vesc's, send to @longhairedboy to finish. 
7. Run up to the mail man like he is Santa when your board returns. 
8. Go out and tear shit up. 

Now my initial thoughts: there is a lot of  fanboy loyalty to various brands on the market, be it DIY brands or complete out of box brands. I have a boosted and an all terrain evolve board I use. I like them, but they are different boards, like a like a jeep and a Porsche. They do different things. It's stupid to compare the two. 

The enertion raptor is the bees knees, that's for sure. To follow the car analogy, it's like a corvette that your uncle frank modded and took out the governor. It's loud and obnoxious and does what it is supposed to do. It goes fast, questionable plastic steering wheel/remote and all. 

I haven't topped it out because I feel like it might bite back if I'm an idiot. I'll add more thoughts after a few more rides.

What happened to the battery box? Looks like it was repaired with a bunch of epoxy

Awesome, longhairedboy is the messiah of Esk8.  And you now have the best VESCs!

I have one coming in as well.  Would love to here more about how it compares to boosted in terms of braking and ride quality.  We all already know it's faster.

Personally, I think that Raptor looks as good as any "out of the box" E-board. And I bet anyone who didn't know, would never guess that it was built in someones garage.

Nice......

this story makes me really happy.... one of my original dreams for enertion is simply sell parts/kits to allow people to build their own completes at home (or get LHB boy 2 do it)

Raptors are way less complex than my own boards and i'm a huge fan of the modular design. I guess that's why i like working on them, they sort of inspire me to continue persuing elegance. That and its easy money. lol

WEAR A HELMET. 

BTW that's not stock raptor tuning in that vesc, i set it the way i set my own boards so it might be a little silkier. However, the stock raptor tuning has changed a little since the first batch which was kind of terrifying to ride (endless acceleration and lack of slow cruising ability anyone?), the last couple i've had come through my shop didn't seem to be set up so aggressively, so apparently some adjustments have been made over time. Which is to be expected, and is very welcome.

Would it be possible for you to share your settings so I can tune my future raptor after that?

I have a board with longhairedboy's VESC settings, they are pretty nice.  The best way I can describe it is a gentle start so you don't fall off the board, and the torque and power come in later as you pick up speed.  It's like a car that you have to rev up high to get the full power, rather than the car just doing burnouts/wheel spins every time you start it.  

Try the stock raptor settings, if the start is too aggressive or fast for you...then use longhairedboy's settings on the BLDC tool if you get them from him.  It might be his secret formula though so not sure if he will give it away haha. (Edit: I guess I can see the settings if I learn to use the BLDC tool).

it's no secret, you could plug your VESC in and see the settings yourself

yea true, if I open up my enclosure and undo all the seals and shrink wraps he put around everything to water proof it, and if I learn the BLDC tool...I could see the settings I suppose lol.

I'm sure he did remove the shrink wrap where the usb port is :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
You only have to open bldc tool, plug your vesc in, click ''connect'' and ''read configuration''.

UPDATE: 
I moved to Hawaii and have had time to tinker with my board some more. Here are some notes and mods.

-TSA let me take a naked space cell on a plane in my back pack. I stashed the board in a rifle case for checked baggage. They were ultimately more concerned about the 3D printed gt2b controller case. 

-I put bigger 97mm flywheels on it. Working out well, less jarring and rattle. 

-I've never really liked the steez remote. I traded out for a gt2b in a printed shell. 

-any troubles I've had with the board were due to controller component connections coming loose. Hotglue or liquid take all the things!

-I still have the original carbon lid that caused interference from some. I cut a thin slot on mine. No issues.

Nice! I tried the Steez and found it wildly uncomfortable, I'd rather have a much more reasonable: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/99a1a7ad00441e8adbca6419ff55ccbce74b5138.jpg" width="690" height="460">

Haha, well sarcastic or not, the convenience of a standard USB micro is much preferred over the long USB mini. ðŸ˜‰

Nope, not sarcasm. this is the remote I use. (*ok that's sarcasm*)
But yeah this has been my temporary remote while I am waiting for a new one since my old one is busted. I don't care about the USB that much, but I much prefer micro. I just find the remote ergonomically uncomfortable.

Did you use a pulley with more teeth since you went from 83mm to 97 mm wheels?

I'm on chakas 50mm motors and went to 97 from 83. works great for me on the same gearing.

NICE RIDE!... did you cut the front wheels to make them skinny or is it an optical illusion?

Thanks. And thank you for the sweet parts. They are indeed cut, but only because they came from another project. I cut them to fit as drive wheels on a boosted board awhile back.

If you find any 97mm 75a let me know. I want them for raptor and my next lhb carvon build...can't find any!!

You don't need them tbh, it's probably better that you get the 78a because they are more durable. Might just be the size compensating for the duro but I have 83mm 75a fly wheels and 97mm 78a wheels, the difference is just not prominent enough for me to tell the difference..all flywheels feel awesome imo, I have 83, 90, 97.  Being genuine abecs makes all the difference

Also, can't emphasize enough how important it is to double check solder joints, heatshrink everything and then reinforce with hot glue. I had a month of intermittent, wacky controller behavior and it was from a bum lead from the receiver. 

That month sucked so bad that I contemplated selling the board and giving up on DIY.

I pull the trigger on the 78a from Miurskate. Spoke to my co-worker and apparently its really hard to find anything aside  78a and it wont make that much of a diff going up or down since this board will be use in the city without much hills :neutral_face: 

Whatever the case, I'm going to use this as a set of test wheels.

Edit: One thing to watch out for as my co-worker warned, Flywheels are not as grippy. They're fast because the wheels are smooth. I took it to mean that its not as much traction as stock. Is that true? @Mr_Mahal @Arzamenable @Jinra
```

## \#35 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-08-23T06:54:42.663Z Reads: 115

They're only a little less grippy due to their thinner contact patch. I'm a huge fan of the Evolve GT wheels due to being 76A with a 54mm contact patch, never slips! I've had my GT with 97mm legit flywheels and I ate it during a turn on rough roads.

You won't slip in normal circumstances though, just be careful turning when asphalt is not so good. If there was an Evolve GT style wheel in 90-97mm I'd jump all over that.

Took these bad boys for a ride on my Raptor today. Love it. They love to slide though, especially on turns just like @Jinra said. Really looking forward to using them again.
