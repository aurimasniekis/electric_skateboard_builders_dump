Hi guys, in a few weeks , I will receive a new phone and will be selling my actual galaxy S7 Edge. With that money of plan on building my first ever electric longboard. This idea came out of nowhere from watching some Casey Neistat videos ( I know he is not the most loved guy in this community).

I want to build something that wont exceed 500$CAD.

So I went on buying a good, used and cheap longboard and settled for a Motion Burglar longboard. Here it is: [details=Summary]<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/9/99a62c85fe0d77f41b5a1eb6f5df4e6723f98dd1.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6c0241259c2a0532ec80dfd07d7209cc6dc7749e.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/4768d60a866e3f835d7e147408bb30b2ca138bdd.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/1/2160007646292208aa00234604afc3b45c6756d8.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/a/0ad1a1dad9fb80a4ba079ccd2932f68dca2a54ce.jpg" width="666" height="500">[/details]

It has a 35" long deck reinforced for impacts, Paris trucks (unkown dimensions), sector 9 69mm 80a wheels with reds bearing. It rides wonderfully and pretty happy with it and only cost me 65$CAD.

What I plan to do with the board is for commuting on flat lands ( where I live there is only one big hill that I don't want to climb on the longboard and even less go down). I want the maximum range I can get for he price and have a top speed of minimum 30Kmph/20mph.

Here what made my short list for the electronics:

* Motors : From Turnigy, either SK3 6364-245kv or G160 245kv ( both running for around 70$USD on hobbyking)
* ESC: FVT Wolf 120a 6s ( runing currently for 68$CAD on aliexpress to receive it in less than a month)
* Battery : Turnigy Graphene pro 10A 6s 15C ( in sale at Hobbyking for 63.08$USD)
* Transmitter : Gt2b (38$CAD from aliexpress) since alot of persons here says it's the most reliable.

For the mecanics..I'm totally lost.  Using the CalcRC app on my phone I calculated that I manage to get 30kmph using a 15t/36t configuration with a 22.2V battery (6s) and a 245kv motor on 69mm wheels.

But I dont know where I can get cheap wheel and motor pulleys, belts and motor mounts. Also, should I change my wheels for 90mm/93mm flywheels/orangatang. This change would put me at 38kmph/24mph. 

With my board and electronics, I'm at about 371$CAD including shipping and USD-CAD conversion.

Has anyone ever been in my situation? If so, any tips? I find that the mecanics are the hardest part to gather at a cheap price!

The easiest way to do the motor mount and gearing is to just get the whole [single motor hardware kit](http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/mono-drive-mechanical-kit) from Enertion. It looks expensive, but once you piece it all out with new Caliber trucks, new wheels, bearings, mount, gears, and belts, you're nearing the same total cost. And definitely get spare belts. And Blue threadlocker (use it on EVERYTHING).

The rest of your build looks really good. Just make sure you own a really good soldering iron.

Oh, and don't forget to buy a balance charger (Amazon.ca has some cheap ones), plus you'll probably want some 8AWG wiring (red & black), XT-90 connectors, and 5.5mm bullet connectors (Hobbyking sells all that).

All this fits into the misc. section for me ^^ . I will probably go at my RC shop by my house to get these. They are crazy expensive for motors and esc ( or simply want to sell me the most expensive parts), so that's why I gathering the bulk on internet. As for the enertion kit, that would really push my budget. Only for this kit, that would put me at 500$CAD, without esc motor nor batteries. So way too expensive ( I don't think I would be able to sell my paris trucks and sector9 wheels for enough to cover this price).

If I'm keeping my paris trucks, would a welded mount do it? Also maybe I would do a 16/36 pulley ratio for a bit more speed (1/2.25 ratio). WHere can I buy these pulleys and fitting belts?

Looks good man.  I would probably get a welded mount as it is easier with those trucks in my opinion and will be the cheapest option if you can get someone to weld it for cheap.

If you are handy and want to do the budget option there are pulleys and belts on ebay.

This would require a drill press for this and a moderate amount of skill haha.

If you don't have the tools DIY's kit looks pretty nice.

Where are you in Canada? I'm Canadian too.

i've been waiting on those motor pulleys for a month! i wold look closer..

also i think jlabs kit would ship faster and the motors are better than sk3

Dang! haha I did order them and it probably took around 3 weeks.  Pulleys work good so far though. 

You just gotta plan REALLY far ahead if you're going to order from China.

I dont have any tool for this but I think m'y girlfriends dad as some that I could use. Would I have to mod only the wheel pulley or motor pulley also? Can it fit a sk3 stock without mods? I really don't know what are the specs to look at. And also, I'm from Montreal!

As for the electric-skateboard.market kit,  for the remote, ESC and motor it would be a minimum of 240$CAD shipped. The motor is only 190kv which is nice for the torque, but will loose some top speed vs Turning 245kv motors. Also, I can get both ESC and remote for 100$CAD shipped. I guess that a 70$USD motor from hobby King won't  reach 140$cad (105$usd) with shipping. Since I plan on ordering from their international warehouse both the motor and battery, I might be fine with shipping.

For the motor pulley, you just need the bore to match the shaft on the motor.  The standard is usually an 8mm shaft.  There are some set screws so most people just dremel a flat spot on the motor shaft so that the screws have something to grip onto.  For the wheel pulley, I drilled 3 holes to mount through flywheel clones and then I used a hole saw to drill out the center to make enough clearance to fit over the trucks.  I also used an angle grinder to grind down that hub that is sticking out.  It's not hard, but is a decent amount of work to only save a few bucks.

I'm from Vancouver, nice to see some Canadian on here!

I consider this build as a challenge. I know going cheap is hard in this hobby. I've been stalking this forums for some weeks before deciding to join. I consider myself as a tech geek and I am really working hard to be more manual. I've done some sit projects for my aquariums and now I want to go the electric longboard road. Yes I'll only save few bucks, but I want to do it myself anyway! Do you have any links to some belts that would fit these pulleys?

I'm just barely east of Toronto. I picked up my GT2B from Amazon. It was $42 all in with prime free shipping. Ordered Friday and receive on a Tuesday. I'm selling an enertion 12mm pulley kit in the for sale section if interested and three 265x12mm belts (unlisted) that I don't need. I had someone print me a baby buffalo mod for the GT2B as well that I don't need. Let me know if you need any of these. I went with  because they are in the US and warranty would be less of an issue. The exchange sucks though.

Good luck.

The small pulley they linked to requires no modification to fit the sk3. But you will need to grind 2 big flat spots on the motor's drive shaft for the pulley's grub screws.

And you definitely want new wheels. http://r.ebay.com/ItldqU

On 90mm wheels at 15:36 with your electronics you will definitely hit 30km/hr and have tons of torque for hills.

Thanks for the link to belts and wheels, they will definitely be a part of my final build. Also, looking for some motor mounts on internet, I found this guy on reddit that is selling custom made clamp mount for paris  trucks. Did anyone experience them?

Reddit : https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/54dcof/new_motor_mount_for_paris_trucks/

Ebay : http://www.ebay.com/itm/Electric-Longboard-Motor-Mount-for-Paris-Trucks-/112158624348?hash=item1a1d2cca5c:g:Tf8AAOSw8w1X3jGt

The sad part is that I cant find any aluminium mount on internet ready to be welded.

Ok guys, after a break of almost 1 year, I decided to come back to this project. I started to loose interest when trying to find some motor mount ( I simply decided to update my pc instead of build an esk8). One year later I'm back at it since I've seen some motor mount kit on eBay for cheap! 

Here it is : http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-Kit-Pulleys-And-Motor-Mount-for-80mm-Wheel-OS914/371996513753?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649

It seems that the holes for the mount aren't natively compatible with 6364 motors, but this build used the same but simply ( to my eye), drilling more holes : http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/billygoat-41-drop-through-longboard-sk3-6354-260kv-motor-ebay-motor-mount-maytech-vesc-3000mah-4s-20c-lipo-pack/17778

Anyway, this kit includes both motor and wheel pulley. But they are in a 3:1 configuration (48/16) and the wheel pulley is made for 80 mm wheels. It seems to me that this would give me a lot of torque, but will drastically reduce top speed if I stick to the 245kv Turnigy SK3 or G160 6364 motor. If I stick to this ratio, should I get a 290kv motor? Would I still get enough torque to move me (I don't weight myself but I'm between 200 and 250)?

I would stick to the same ESC  (FVT 120a). Would it be too much erpm for it? I'm still confused about what erpm is and what it does.

I also plan to now go with the Turnigy Graphene Pro 12A 6s 15C (instead of the 10A, since the 12A is on sale on HB). Would this charger be good to refill the battery? : https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Freeshipping-Battery-Balance-Charger-IMAX-B6-Lipo-Digital-Balance-Charger-Charging-adapter-Wholesale/1902227959.html

All in all, that would set me back at 425$CAD, should I pull the trigger?

Do you have any thoughts about a 290kv with a 16/48 ratio setup?

My recommendation is to buy pulleys from @johnny_261
And of course, buy the mount from me 😉
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOtWlHLcAs

I recommend you gear a little lower than that because you are correct in your thinking that it will give you tons of torque but low top speed.  15t to 36t is what I’m using with my 245kv and it has plenty of torque but also a nice top speed.  Good luck!
