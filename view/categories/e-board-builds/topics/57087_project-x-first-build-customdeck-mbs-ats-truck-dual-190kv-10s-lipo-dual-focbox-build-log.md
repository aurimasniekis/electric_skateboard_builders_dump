Edit: I wanted to show a recent pics of where the board is at as a way to show you what your getting into for this thread.

Back to the normal thread.

So when starting this I wanted to make a deck that mimics the Bajaboard because I cant afford a real one. So being a cheap crafty *teenager*, yes I know I'm young but don't let that fool you, I began my project. This has always been an idea in the back of my head and recently I decided I was going to make it a reality. Right now I'm just want to learn everything I need to know and that might take a while even being a fast learner. My plan is to build an Electric Mountain board since me and my friends tend to go camping frequently. I wanted to bring along something that will bring a little more fun for the trips. I've always loved tinkering with electronics and am right now studying to be an engineer. So that's a little about me let me show you some pictures!

I was first going to use CF and Bamboo like in @MasterCho thread but when Composite Invisions couldn't supply the CF because it was in high demand I looked around for other options and found Basalt. I've heard it's what Trampa uses, it's strong and cheep and it looks great!

![glass-on-fabric-2|560x394](upload://3biMkCrSVOL7jYTZdWdnGl4ehw2.jpg)
I'll be using the Fabric above for the exterior and for strength I'll use 8 layers of **Basalt Quad Axial Fabric 680gsm 0 degree, 90 degree, 45 degree, -45 degree**

The photos show me making a template, which was to long, getting some foam and bamboo from Roarockit then gluing the foam so I could cut it to make a cheap press, cutting the foam smoothing it out and covering it with tape. Finaly I'll be getting the fabric and laminating resin soon to hopefully make the deck complete.I havent even started figuring out the electronics yet, but so far it's been a lot of fun!

Edit: looks like the pictures are a little out of order, I'll work on cleaning them up.

IDK how thick are the bamboo veneers but anyway I would be afraid the will crack int the angled are of mold :/ Maybe you could round the edges  little? :) 

Do you plan on using vacuum? 

Where did you get the basalt fabric? I was looking for some and I didnt find any...

 I was worried about them breaking as well so I did a dry run with one of the planks of bamboo to see if it could handle that type of angle. Looks like all I need is more clamps.

Nope, just lamination

I found some on this site https://basalt-fabric.com/ but you have to contact them to figure out prices. They have a very large selection of different weaves of fabric, and they have a resin / fabric coating that keeps the fabric from darkening or turning green like the Trampa board.

Ok just a few things, I don’t think those mounts will fit on to the trucks without lots of modification. I would also look at some other builds and see what trucks/ wheels they are using as those ones I’ve never seen and the wheels don’t look like they would have much grip on off road. That charger is also no good unless you have a 6s battery or less and don’t mind waiting 2h+ for charging.

Apart from that the motors, pulleys and remote are all good, although bigger motors might be needed depending on weight and sort of off-roading you’ll be doing

I would recommend getting focboxs just because they would be more reliable on an off-road board. Btw if your on a tight budget Keda 195kv motors are a great steal, much cheaper than those of you listed and very reliable, well mine have been. They have taken a considerable knock at about 30km/h into a concrete pillar with only a scratch.

They have two versions 6364 and 6356 (listed as 5663 for some reason) I have used both

Might want to re think that battery. It is a 2s battery which is far below what was offered as the common range of 6s. I suspect you might be wanting to run them in series which will still only get you 4s. That motor is appropriate for 6s-10s in my opinion.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/noob-question-thread-ask-your-questions-here/9559/1040

Alright, looks interesting and new :slight_smile:
I´d use a smaller BMS for charging only for this board. You can´t use the BMS for discharging too low anyway, so i would only use the charging and balancing aspect. This way you are eliminating a factor for performance.
The next limiting part would only be the two focboxes, but you´re able to pull some nice juice out of them before something happens ;)

So, your saying don't use the BMS I found, wouldn't a weaker one not work, or are you saying balance charge them each separately. One more question what do you mean by limiting factor? Thanks for the help.
```

## \#30 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2018-06-04T21:32:36.678Z Reads: 195

```
Alright, to make it more clear.
This BMS gives you a bit more safety, but will limit your setup. Don´t get me wrong, 80A continous can definitely move things ;)
A smaller charge-only BMS will alow you to bypass the bms for discharging and will only be used for charging and balancing your lipos. It´s much smaller and cheaper. Something like this one:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/282923151393?ul_noapp=true

What i meant with limiting factor:
You´ll find a bottleneck in every system. But you´re able to get all parts to about the same level and that´s the art of building. In your sytem, the batteries are able to pull more than 80A and both focboxes are able to pull more than 80A together. In between that, there is your BMS which, with 80A will be the limiting factor. It´s better to let the Focboxes enlarge their full potential and let them manage the maximum limit for maximum fun ;)
Before you buy one, pls do some research on BMS for charging and discharging vs. BMS for charging only, bypassing discharge

I decided to just get more wood and cover it with Basalt to save even more money and this is how it turned out, or at least the wood part.

Next time I should do a better job gluing, but hopefully when I laminate it'll keep it from deforming.

So, I made a material change and switched back to CF due to the nature of resin needed for the Basalt. But I didn't just get any Carbon Fiber...:wink:

I followed this thread.

I've now done the black layer and the first clear coat.

Word of advice do not do it in direct sunlight when it's +90 degrees out side. Otherwise that 4-6 hours only take 5 minute. Lesson learned...:sweat_smile:

And this is a pic of the red version for reference.

And some more words of advice, don't set it under a tree, stuff can fall in it. Don't use a paint brush, they don't work well and you have to throw them away. Use something flat to spread it more or less evenly, and let gravity do the rest of the work for you.

Soo... I thought I should tell you guys another mistake I made and update with some pictures of the longest part of the process, Sanding.

I was able to sand off the burrs with 60 grit fairly easily both hand sanding and with tools.

![20180709_193246%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://kPXxvaATXSWhGDf0Ctz0ftZRso0.jpg)
![20180709_193226%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://zvs6D5IZaJWyCf97LxIKt4f1fZv.jpg)

Dont over sand, but I'll be covering that with grip tape. :sunglasses:

![20180709_193447%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://wcLWP49h3rb3xO8QYgeOGeGYEqg.jpg)

I also covered it with water just to see what it would look like.

![20180709_193431%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://oiFrYMvUmansAOu9EVXRCbiK6Fk.jpg)

And now to talk about my mistake... So here's the story I was planning to learn from my last mistakes of not doing the bottom layer in the sun. I was all prepared this time with the pre cut fabric at the ready. I did the routine mix the resin add the dye poor it on evenly. But I forgot that once done your support to let it sit till it becomes tacky. I put it on when it was still wet.:sweat_smile: I tried to save it by taking off the fabric and adding another layer of resin to let that get tacky and re-apply the same fabric. That didn't work so I ended up just scraping off all the wasted resin and throwing away the fabric. So right now I'm just taking a brake letting it still and updating you all.
Lucky I still have enough resin and fabric left to retry one last time. Third times a charm right? :rofl:

That's exactly what happened, even sanding with 60 grit it just soaked it up and became crystal clear. Unfortunately I didn't take any pics of me reapplying the resin on the surface.

It's very flexible even with adding CF. I weigh only 125lbs , but I had my friend who weighs 230lbs  ride it. I only used 6 plys of wood. I'll post a flex test later. I'll also hold some weight for the bigger people.

Here is the flex test, Using 180lbs to 200lbs.
The squeaking is from the truck bushings, I loosened them to turn more. I'll be getting softer ones in the future.

The best I could do is $275.00 per unit. It would still be color customizable but if you wanted something thicker than 7 ply we would have to talk. Again this is assuming others want to buy. If you wanted normal Carbon Fiber It would cost less. But man that stupid shipping gotta ruin everything. :laughing:
