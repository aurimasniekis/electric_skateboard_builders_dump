This is my first dual motor build. And first build with idlers. And basically my first build all together. 

Does this all look right? Are my settings correct for the vesc? ![image|375x500](upload://9jiG0k2ANYMHMBBCKpBhwrTB72Q.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://3hUpkjjTG3SsUMLjJN3BkZRmTmq.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://aPK9rSv1zQidCIEu2YFU1eDVf80.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://AiFwhvkeNU2Ek0rczWPffGlODna.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://goGo1d3Tb7kk3nivSXUWIueuCn8.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://vwHVrSjuW7Ne89okgQ9fGAh6c6w.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://lupn4SgflLmbk7gRfEzZ8HLpjSD.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://gMM4ERV4YJaIZ6JuNXXXstqWUTn.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://qIERYDPwfHfXZhdI2b5jXPULvQX.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://r9AN8kIF3ujoGVwgVgDoiTlCc0Y.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://5HGNan7Jx9C1ULpHSUatYDIlFTQ.jpeg)

You need to hit Apply for your voltage cut off to update + write motor config.

What kind of Torqueboard 63" Reversed mounts are those? Mine is completely different and it come with the separate clamp. What I'm missing here? I didn't see these in their website when I bought it!!

Aaaah, is a Double Motor Mount Set ($165) !! Thats why. Mine is the larger single reverse mount version.

I am running a 10s set up. Am typed in the numbers manually. Did I do it wrong? I’m a noob and not afraid to ask dumb questions. 

Thanks for taking a look and willing to respond. I have about 1 mike on this board (since I finished today and it’s about to rain in Chicago) one thing I noticed is that when the wheel is on the ground and therefore not moving or able to move, the large case part (sorry I don’t know the technical terms) of the motor has some give and can turn a little bit each way. Is that normal? Here is a link.

I know. It was expensive. But for my first dual build it seemed like a good choice because of how solid it was. On my single motor build I was struggling to get the mount mounted well. I learned a lot from that and could probably do a regular mount well now. But this seemed solid. So I went for it.

Check the set screws on the end of the motor. Could be loose. You'll need metric hex key to tighten it.

Ooooh yeah, this is very important @eskatechicago, you need to used Metric Hex instead the Imperial. Otherwise you'll end up destroying the clamp's grub screws.

Yeah, that's correct. Might need to flip the hex key so you have more torque though.

Yes. I was.  The placement was just for the photo. I did use the other side and tried to crank on it. It was tight. I will try again.

My set up is similar to yours but with the new 2 piece clamp and idlers. These mounts work amazing. TB makes great products not a huge fan of fixed mounts cause then your stuck with one pulley set up cause it's not really adjustable. 

Here is mine the updated version of yours.

Nice setup, Adam! Yeah, me too I'm a fan of adjustable mounts. Like to think in the future so I can reuse my installations later. You drilled then holes for your Idlers? What drill bit you used? Which Idler bolt size?

Nope mine came that way I have Prototype mounts before the V5 came out. The clamp is split in 2 so it never ever gets loose like the old set ups.

If I cannot get it to tighten more, will this be a problem for the motor performance?

I’m only getting about 24/25mph top speed. Is that because of my settings? Also my friend (who has a boosted v2) is beating me with torque on take off. Is that because of my 97mm wheels?

Looks like you have a similar set up to me, are you also dual 6355s? Does yours Get faster top speeds? Are our setting similar?

Are your running 16t motor and 36t on wheel?

If that's the case your top speed should be around 29mph but if your axle is slipping in the motor like you showed in the video then you are not putting the power down almost like you are running single motor. So performance will be impacted untill you fix that issue.

It would come loose after every small ride after I would tighten it. So I thought I’d take them out and throw a little bit of loctite on there and 3 went in and out no problem. But one would go back in an ended up getting cross threaded and stuck after I thought I finally got it to go back in. I should have known because it was more difficult to take out in the first place. Now it is almost stripped from me trying to get the screw out. Any recommendations? Is one grub screw enough in there with loctite? Seems silly that these would need this much maintenance after only about 4 miles on them total. I had a single motor set up before this have the same issue with the grub screw and I think it got off balance because of it and burnt out a different one of your motors.
