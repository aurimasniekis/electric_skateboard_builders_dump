Whats up boys and girls,

I'm building a battery backpack with the cells that I have laying around from broken packs and cells that are not suitable for esk8. The backpack will be a 12s11p (TBD depending on weight) with 25R cells. All of the cells are mostly in the start of their life cycle and I am going to balance them all before welding them together. The backpack will feature a 48v DC - 12c DV buck converter to power a 120 v AC power inverter. The Inverter will feature USB ports and 2 120v AC outlets for charging my boards as well as other peoples board on long trips.  Not only will the board have outlets but it will have a 3 foot long cable extending out of it which carries raw 12s power.  That cable will parallel my 12s Mono drive board and my 12s 4WD Trampa. The backpack will have a BMS, voltmeter, Percent display and on/off switch.
 
Along with the backpack, my mono should reach about 80 miles in range and my trampa should be about 30 miles range. This is going to be used pretty much just for my Trampa because the 12s7p already on it wont get me much range with 4WD.  Together that board will be at a massive 12s18p. 

I needed a project to recycle all of the cells I had laying around from warranties and other things and I think this is the perfect project. 

I had to step it from 48 to 12 and then from 12 to 120ac because the inverters that step from 48 to 120ac are too expensive. Unless you all have found something cheaper?

Looking forward to that

I think this is the perfect solution for those of us who cannot afford two boards and want a lightweight board for commuting during the week but also enjoy to go on long rides on the weekends

Just need an elegant and safe connection on top of the board, I think it should be strong enough to keep a solid connection when riding but to also easily disengage if you have to bail

interesting cell recycling project.

It would be interesting to have JUST a large battery backpack (with BMS & meter) with a long cable with an XT connector that plugs into a lightweight battery-less esk8. Rides a bit weird, but great for long range and use with multiple lower cost boards. Definitely something @squishy654 should think about.

I agree. I am going to use either an XLR connection or XT90. There will be a steel cable attached to the connection to make sure any pulling force is not applied to the wires. 

@Mikenopolis  I agree, that would be a neat project. I usually ride with a backpack anyway so it wouldnt be a burden.

@barajabali

Have you thought about using cooler or camera backpacks that have top and bottom partitions so you can use bottom for battery and top for other stuff...great, now I'm thinking about having you make me a pack like this so I can deal with my current 10s3p limitations due to deck/enclosure choices.

waist straps for the backpack are going to be key, especially for that many cells. All the weight on the shoulders is going to be very straining, especially if you're actually planning to drain the whole pack on one ride..

I looked at hundreds of backpacks and I settled on the shell or hardcase style backpacks that drone owners use to transport their equipment. 

The reason i chose the hardcase style is to have a solid area where I can mount the display and charge port. It also has more structure, which i believe will help if i fall back first. There will be a whole lot of shock absorption materials in the pack to make sure it doesn't vent if i fall.

But I think that style could work too, the compartments would be cool.

Agree with the steel cable, but if the connector is not too tight the wires should be perfectly capable of taking the load

My idea is to have the board connector free from the board, this way the force is always normal to the connection in case you have to bail, that would guarantee that always the disconnection can happen

he means normal as in, 90 degrees or perpendicular to an upright rider. Versus having a plug on the side of the enclosure, which would not allow for disconnection as easily if the rider were to suddenly fall forward or back.

picturing running off the board with the cable attached. may cause some issues without some kind of quick release. 

also the connection from backpack to board, what kind of wire will you use? something more robust than the 10awg silicone wire? would it be inefficient at such lengths?

I prefer to keep all the weight on the board itself and not on my body, I like to ride and skate and carve and move around on the board and wearing a heavy battery in a pack doesn't sound pleasant or comfortable, not to mention the inconvenience of a cable. 

When I skate long distances I use a small satchel or hip pack, that's it, just enough for a small tool kit, snacks, a small water bottle and so on. I don't even wear a backpack at all and always felt it messed with my skating. I like the hip pack because I have it over just one shoulder and I can shift it around from front to back, get into it while riding if I need to, I would have to stop if I needed to grab anything outta a backpack. 

You would think the weight of the batteries in my board are just crazy, but it only matters when you have to push (or carry it, omg!), which I barely have too, lol. I think of riding on top of that weight as a better solution, not carrying it and adding to my fatigue. It's better to get use to riding a heavy board than training to carry a heavy pack....I already do that when mountaineering and have some nice load carrying packs, but I don't see the need when I can fit enough battery on a board itself and just stand on it..

For my next build I was thinking of doing a extended range battery pack also. 12s5p under longboard deck kaly style and extra 12s5p on top for longer rides barajabali style in a type 500 case. How do you plan to run the batteries? Do you plan to run the 12s7p till it's dead then connect 12s11p after. Want identical packs because i heard it's best to have same capacity batteries if you plan to run them in parallel. Thinking of the wiring and would ideal if I can run them in parallel and also each pack independently if needed. Also would be cool to be able to charge them together but probably only possible without BMS.

That would be massive! Ive always been a huge advocate for huge batteries. I plan to run always start them off fully charged. If i wait until my board dies before plugging in then there will be a massive rush of current and i think ill fry a lot of components or damage my cells. 

I do think it would be cool to wire it to my board so i can charge it at the same time but I want to be able to use this while camping or day trips when i dont have my board so I think that it having its on BMS maybe the better option for me personally.

Have you taken in consideration the amount of energy that you will lose by converting the energy back and forth. You could instead just charge directly from the pack instead. Only thing you wold need is a voltage regulator and  a current limiter.

Yea I have. Ive found that the inverters that can operate with an input of 48v and output of 12-v ac are well over $150. i found one on amazon for about $110..

Do you have any links of items that you would suggest for this build

Let me make myself more clear. The board will be taking power directly from the battery backpack. The only thing that will need to be stepped down is the inverter which will be used for anything else. It may be used for charging the boosted boards in my group ride but mostly for camping and such

Long cables are pretty bad story for VESC usually (surges in cables under load can occur easily) and potentially sources of bugs. Often read "keep your cables as short as possible". 

That's why I was asking.

Was thinking of series that can't be connected with different capacity packs. So in parallel it's okay to run different capacity like 12s7p and 12s11p together? 

You have 12s7p in a type 500 case? I can probably do that for additional 2p but I'm already predicting 40-80mile range on urethane depending on riding style for some epic trips on bike paths.

This is something I have thought many times about. But like the others have said, the weight is much more comfortable in the actual board. A small trailer with batteries would be the better option.

That being said, I think a magnetic connector is mandatory for if you fall off. And lots and lots of caps.

Take a look here. It's said for every 4" you'll need 220uf of capacitance.

How about a small backpack with wheels? They actually already make them. I've seen this guy cruising with a fat subwoofer on a trailer. It just makes more sense then having that weight on your body when you're trying to be maneuverable. And what if you fall onto your highly explosive battery pack?

Wouldnt the battery on the  board with short power wires act as a capacitor and dampen surges from the back pack?

How much will this back pack weigh? Ive carried a 20lb backpack while riding and, to be honest it really wasnt fun. The weight wore me down pretty quick.

I gotta agree that riding around with a heavy backpack really sucks when your on a longboard. The wait makes it hard to turn and balance properly and overall makes you feel like your gonna fall off constantly. I'd try riding your board with a backpack full of weights or something to just get a feel of what it would be like before building something you can't even use. Also about the 48V converters I found a bunch on AliExpress for under $70. Here's a 750W one but there's also 300, 500 and other wattages available.

@barajabali you may need capacitors like said above so a  tip : better use an array of smaller ones (pack multiple 220uF if possible instead of less bigger 2200uF). 

Another thing you might want is add shunts to the end of cables to bleed any spike the caps couldn't withstand. 

Weight distribution is everything, why not start from a superflat backpack instead and add guards padding on it by yourself? Even start from a laptop pouch and add layers of fireproof material.

Odd thing is : the closer to your gravity center it is, the better handling. The worst too in case something goes wrong :confused:

That was my thought too, the packpack battery would just supply "long term" energy. Im not an EE though but it makes sense to me.

I was thinking to have a 15lb max with inverter and all. I hope i can fit at least a 12s8p in there. Ill be doing some weighing once the components come in. Im not sure what the wh/m is yet because im still waiting for the last 2 motors to come in.  But im pretty sure its going to be the highest possible. I have no evidence to back this up but its 4wd with low pressure 8" pneumatic s and chains (and the bearings are shot from last years snow lol) 25mm belts and i weigh 230 lbs.  SO I think 120 wh/m is a fair estimate.. Pretty bad!

I will be using a flat drone backpack, im going to add a waist band strap to it to help with the weight distribution on my shoulders. The pack will be constructed with cell holders, rubberized heat shrink, insulation for temp differences, Fire proof layer (if i can find some), and last shock absorption layer for drops.

In regards to fireproofing, here is what im thinking. 

If I go with the ceramic fiber it will not only contain the fire but insulate the pack against temperature changes.. Also act act a layer of shock absorption.  I may go with a lipo bag and ceramic fiber

I also think im going to go with this inverter. Its the cheapest 48v to 120ac that ive found and it has good reviews.

Although this one seems much better quality.... Hmmm

I think 300W isn't really enough to charge other people's boards off of, especially more than one at a time. And you have to remember usually companys like to inflate there ratings just like the C ratings on LiPos so a 300W inverter might be only capable of 200 or 250W continuous.

Super late reply sorry for that.

The shunts would be interesting to avoid amps surges (as capacitors should smooth out voltage spikes and drops).

I understand that you want to be able to parallel your backpack through your batteries? So juice would run through your batteries first? Not sure how you can do it (parallel is in the end parallel).

I think this "situation" is quite unique. So what do u think would happen if "next cell group" or battery would be "a bit further" from the "main pack"?

I think electricity would flow anyway it would be a question about how much extra sag or power limit it would create

Do you guys think that using a buck converter from 48 to 12v then run a 12v inverter would be terribly inefficient? 
[/quote]

Yeah it will be pretty inefficient...

The problem is you would be converting from 50V DC to 12V DC to 120AC to 42/50V DC.  Each step has losses.  And when you have problem regulators in line like that they are always drawing a small amount of current.  If you have just a single regulator, it won't pull any current with no load.  But if you have them back to back, they feed each other continuously with a "ghost" current.   _Example_: I have a 50V to 12V BEC that draws zero amps with nothing plugged in.  But if I plug in a 12V to 5V regulator into the BEC it still pulls some current, even if nothing is plugged into the 5V rail

Do you have a serious need for the 120V AC?  What I think is a better solution is to keep your backpack at DC voltage and then just down-regulate if needed.  For charging 12S boards, you can hook up your 12S backpack-battery directly.  For a 10S board or otherwise, just use a step-down converter to choose your preferred DC voltage.   If you still wanted 120V AC I would have it be an external option that plugs into the step-down converter

**TL;DR...   DC to DC to AC to DC is messy**

It would only take 24 hours for a full charge is my best guess.
[/quote]

these generally have USB outputs, 0.5-2a absolute max. at 5v, that's 2.5-10W of charging power. For a 12s battery that's about 0.05 - 0.2a charging current, which works out to 25-100 hours of charging, assuming full sunlight for 24 hours, which obviously isn't going to happen. The solar thing has been tried a few times and it doesn't really work out.

EDIT: and that's assuming 0% power loss when converting up to 50V

You can avoid AC altogether if all you want to do is provide board charging, along with a booster to 60V, the dps5015 with 60V input can output 50V which will give 4.16v/cell for 12S. You can mount the control/module to be accessable externally with ports, and program multiple charging profiles you can just select for whatever you wanna charge

I spent a while breaking down old packs and re heat shrinking them so they look nice and don’t short together. I went with a 12s9p with all 25r cells. 

I had a bunch of dead cells which I threw out. These are all in the 3.8-3.9v range. I’m using the cutout from the drone to house the battery, I will also be using fire proof wrap and more shock absorption. I also attached my waist strap

Well, im "fabricating" my own now, though they are super ghetto with screws and aluminium pipe attaching the fender / curved shape.

Otherwise there are a few designs for evolve type hangers and tires, if u got the commitment, ask some of the korean guys to send u the files if they can, they do have really nice, robust design in my opinion l.

Looks a bit like these overpimped japanese trucks (the board with all the lights).. but well.. It sort of suits the style of the overall board ;)

quick question.

if the extended pack is made of up different cells, would the main pack and extended pack, when connected together, balance each other as you drained them?

that's to say, let's say the main pack installed on the board is made up of 30q cells, has continuous discharge of 100a.  the extended pack, let's say, are made up of reclaimed cells, has discharge of 80a.  when connected together, would they discharge at different rates, but would get balanced out since they're connected in parallel?

I dig it, I just gate the idea if a trailer. If you had to roll out of a spill the trailer might end up crashing I to you.

I was just curious if it would 5+ hours to charge a 7p pack as that's about my limit. I always stay where my board is charging in case of an issue and 5 hours in one place is not convenient. 

I prolly won't ever build anything over 4p anyways, mostly 3p does the job for me as far as distance. I very seldom ride over 12-15 miles at a time.

I have been doing some tests on some wire that I collected from a bunch of new resistors that I had laying around. (Few hundred of them) it seems that this wire can handle at least 23-25 amps of current before busting. I am going to make this pack with cell level fuses inspired by @chaka

I will weld of the negative terminals with nickel strip and I’ll fuse the positive terminals to a bus bar. 

The videos aren’t exactly scientific I recorded them with the slow mo function on my phone and a current meter. But they were cool non the less

when connecting the two, the voltages of each must be identical, right?  otherwise a huge spark and rush of current to balance each other out?

On a very large capacity pack a .1v difference could equate to a large capacity/current differential

@barajabali btw I used these for air gapping and attaching fuse wire and axial glass fuses to the buss bar on my PowerWall packs. I did it in pairs but you can use it for single cell too. What's nice you can have the fuse wire "tight" and still have vibration dampening by the nickel tab. You would need to design some kinda of capping/stacking system though to make a brick though

So I have soldered all of the cells and spotwelded all of the negative ends. 

This process was extremely long if this were a normal pack I would have finished it 3 tim s over already. Each cel is fused as well as a 60amp fuse for the entire pack. 
Still much to do 
For consistency with this project, I’m using a recycled bms and anti spark switch.

This is a very cool idea- and so far quite professionally executed. Something that came to mind while I was reading through all of this was an idea for how to get power to the board. It sounds a little far fetched and it is quite a bit more complicated than just running a wire from your pack to the board. OK so what I was thinking was perhaps there is a way of creating a system similar to a ski boot- having a means of clicking into the board and having the connection made (you would have to run a cable down to the shoe/boot) but then, if you had to step off quickly or if you got in a crash, the shoe could disconnect from the board, helping you prevent injury. This would probably mean a dedicated pair of shoes for riding the board, but it could be a way of connecting everything that doesn't completely tie you onto the board. Anyways, that's just a thought. Unrealistic, but I thought it was interesting to think about.

That is a neat idea thanks for it. My solution is to have a clockable xlr port which runs down to an xt90 port. Both ports pull off with ease. There is a wire in the cable mesh which which gives the cable itself strength. 

Weakest points are the ports/connectors Incase they catch they fall off

Ahh wait! Im using the same boost converter (white module on the bottom) and that thing gets really hot even with a heatsink and fan at 150W(50V 3A), id say if your going above ~80W your gonna need another fan and maybe a heatsink as well. Also id recommend another exhaust fan for the DPS5015 module as well because while it does have its own fan it isnt enough especially at higher currents. Other than that looks awesome!

Mounting which to a heatsink? The white converter yeah definitely below is a pic of how I attached mine its a slightly different model but similar. For the DPS module im not sure how you would transfer heat from it because it already has a small heatsink on it.

Do you even really need the boost converter? You could charge a 12S battery directly from your battery backpack. And for under 12S use the step-down converter

Have seen a few mentions of inductive charging but I've used it on my Nexus 5 and it does make everything very warm which means energy lost and not great for the batteries to have extra heat while being charged and building up their own heat.  Also because of inverse square magnetic field stuff any offset from perfect alignment or change in distance is going to result in more energy lost.

I was just joking but this should be better and you get more clearance at the bottom of the backpack:

I might be building one of these soon, as the sole source of power for a board. I know some people have talked about this, but how long can a cable be before it has issues? This would be 6 ft

I tried this just as a range extender, the cable was two 10AWG silicone wires with quick disconnect bullets... I found the cable super annoying. 

If this is going to be successful, you have to get creative with the cable so it doesn't get in the way. I tried retraction clips with limited success. Taking the backpack off and on, or plugging and unplugging just to get on and off was a pain.

[/quote]

I have been using mine for over  a year now. I have changed it a bit though:

I am now using a different bag. (an obed)
Different techniques for insulation and shock absorption . 
I can also charge the bag and board from 1 charger. 
There is no display anymore (not needed)
No on off switch either
I changed the BMS to a supower BMS 
Its an all purpose bag. It carrys all of my tools I could possibly need for my Trampa. Charger, Spare tire and tubes, Spare antisparks and remotes.


![image|375x500](upload://hc0MOacbrbLJ9gHEBXB8lcFOLkz.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://w5Ulp7MC2ICFIz8oIsrdzJRbx9j.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://pVA4ovBhiyrH9wiAta506QRl0um.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://9dq01L683NplRyLpLcpQaO6D5Ag.jpeg) 

My cable is 10 awg, maybe around 4 feet long. There is a Key-back to keep the slack tight but still allows me to move freely. The cable is never in my way.

Weight is 21 lbs with speaker, spare tire, inner tube, 12s9p battery, 7amp charger, and all the tools I would need.  And the Obed makes that weight feel like nothing, very wide straps.

When I ride how I want, my 4 wheel drive Gear drive Trampa gets around 7 miles range, This adds another 23 miles or so. So I can get 30 real world, fast paced, do-whatever-I-want miles.

Not wanting to hijack that thread, but...

I've been using a Hitachi battery backpack for a bit now, and I must say it's quite versatile and a convenient way of swapping vehicles. 
That's a 10s8p, 750Wh, (50A), now with a VESC 4.12 inside. And it just takes some simple software changes to swap between electric skate, electric kite buggy, and drift trike. (and Line Trimmer...).
The backpack is well designed with ample padding and straps, which makes it feel comfortable to carry, despite its 6+kgs.
Using Speakon connectors for phase wires, and RJ45 for whatever else.

Those backpacks were available for super cheap last year (NZ$230), and they really do the job. Could be fitted with better cells and different BMS later on if needed. ![P_20180610_140928|281x500](upload://qiWRCP2sOJEL1Avx9crFwNxSayu.jpeg)

Some more ideas for DC-DC charging.

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/RD-DPH5005-Buck-boost-converter-Constant-Voltage-current-Programmable-digital-control-Power-Supply-color-LCD-voltmeter/32840324731.html

Buck boost so you can get to any voltage up to 50v. Only 5 amps though.

Or, I was thinking, if you go 13s for the backpack, you can run the DPS5015 or DPS5020 buck converters without a boost to charge 12s.
