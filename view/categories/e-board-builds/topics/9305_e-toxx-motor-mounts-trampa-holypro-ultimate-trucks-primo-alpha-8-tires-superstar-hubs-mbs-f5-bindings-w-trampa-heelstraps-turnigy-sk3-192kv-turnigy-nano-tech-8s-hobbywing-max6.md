Watsup guys,

Just wanted to post some pics of my board, and give a big thanks to Nowind for all his help. Been having a blast on this thing.

@DilatedPupils 

Thanks! Yeah, it's just for the light. Had originally planned on using VESCs so I already had the box. Probably going to add another switch for some colored lights on the bottom, or something to that effect.

Upgraded with ISO-5 chain parts, and added more batteries and carbon mount for the esc's. Top end's around 25mph with tours of 13+ miles with plenty battery life to spare.

The only thing I miss about chains is the lack of drag unlike belts. 

Very clean build man I love the lights! I've got some red LEDs under mine! 12 volt

@skiboyscuba @barajabali

Thanks guys. I'm really happy with it. Only thing that bums me out about the chain is having to tighten it all the time. Anymore messing with the screws and I'm worried I'll start stripping 'em out. 

Looking forward to giving the belts a try (with a little more top-end).

I might reccomend the 15mm trampa belts. I'm gonna experiment with them soon. The drag and loss of range is annoying, the torque transfer is amazing though. Right now 12s7p is getting me 12-15 miles I'm 230lbs though. 

With chains I used to get much more but I sincerely hated them for all reasons

@barajabali

What's the loss of range with belts compared to chains? Got a couple of Jens' 25mm belt drive setups in progress. Didn't realize there was any loss in range. 

This is my first build so I don't have any comparison. Perhaps in hindsight, I would've upgraded to direct drive rather than the ISO-5 stuff, but I'm happy with the chains on this one for now.

I'll be doing some testing in the next few weeks so I don't have any solid numbers as of yet but off the top of my head. My 10s8p with chains would go for about 20-26 miles while my belts on 12s7p are about 12-15. 

Not sure why or if my results are skewed since there are multiple variables but I still feel like I need to get more range from it

@barajabali  - what's the watt hour rating of each systems battery? 10s and 12s is still a difference.. and that 1p (assuming ~2500mah) probably also impacts the range.. by at least 2miles

Nice build, looks like I will put some LED lights on mine as well. I have it on my CGT. I have it going around the edges of the deck because it has zero deck flex anyway.

Was having some stuttering issues with this build at speeds. Tried riding it awhile back with 9" tires. Motors got super hot and ended up melting the main connector from the batteries to the ESCs.

Everything I'm coming up with points to the battery wires being too long. Think mine are a little longer than most (tried to cram as many on there as possible :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:). Added some cap banks and street tires.

Had a few long tours and no issues so far. Also swapped the motors out to 213kv for a little more speed. Maxes out at about 28mph now. Increased the range to about 17 miles too.

What kind of led lightbar are you using for the headlight?

I was looking into getting a couple of these but yours looks more professional.

I'm trying to find a small compact solution my self and are still undecided, i'd be interested what solution benjammin ended up with and if it is 6v or 12v?

edit: the battery looks small...

Yup, that's the one. Could be a little brighter, but overall I've been happy with it. Been having a blast riding at night with this thing. 

Battery's 11.1V:

Some video from earlier today. Got stopped by the popo for trying to cross the bridge 😜

Last time I ride on that side of the trail on a Sunday. Way too many people. Board actually tops out at 30mph, then as the batteries deplete drops down to 28. Feels so slow after riding 12s though 😟

You got enough slack on your chain? it still sounds very tense (hard to tell in video but sounds like I do 1stly).

Good ride :v:

Sounds like you need better quality chains. Surprised they would stretch so fast. Do you keep them well lubricated?

@CosmicCharlie

If you're referring to my comment earlier on in the thread about having to regularly tighten the chain, I initially assumed it was supposed to be kept tight for some reason. No problems since keeping slack.

As far as lubricant, I've been using a synthetic wet product (Finish Line) that seems to attract too much dirt, appearing to make the chain tighten due to less motion between links. I think the chain quality is fine otherwise though.

@Nowind

Nice! Think if I go anywhere from here though, it's gonna be direct drive. 

Got my heart set on a street carver, with MBS trucks and bindings. Think Eboosted crushed my dreams of building a flexible pack anytime soon though. That thing made your little firework show look like a 12-year-old girl with a sparkler in comparison. I dig riding these things and whatnot, but I'd like to keep the three-piece set intact if at all possible 😉

I am building a flexible pack again, as soon as the parts arrive I'll dissect the crispy board and will analyze every possible cause, this time I'll use longer silicone wires to connect each individual pack and grommets between each section, I'll also make my own enclosure to avoid any movement of packs so no force could bend the nickel strips.

I'm going to build the Phoenix e-Board with Trampa HS11 deck, ultimate 16" trucks, 107mm evolve wheels and custom enclosure.

Nice! Cool name 👍 

I too like the look of the MTB deck over the carver. I'm set on Matrix2 trucks though for this next build, and the narrow wheel base looks a little wonky with the wider deck imo.

Hey Ben,

i really felt in love with the sensored shit.
Its just another level... so if its an option for you go for it.

213kv, 1:4 , 8inch, 8S is okay but maybe not the optimum
I think you get high temps from cogging
runned some time with MAX6 and Alien 240KV and 1:5 gearing.
Slow startup was good, fast startup not possible... by lots of starts from standstill the motors gain temperatures quickly...
maybe 130kv sensored 10-12s could be sweet

grease coming out... well if its not much i would not care... or you think the lid is damaged?
Maybe the grease is to thin could be an option too
Just let me know

Cheers

Thanks for the response. Yeah, I gotta bite the bullet here and bump up to a sensored vesc6 setup at some point. Those smooth startups on hills are ridiculous.

It's not much grease coming out really. I'll just keep an eye on 'em. Give 'em wipe every now and again.

Cheers!
