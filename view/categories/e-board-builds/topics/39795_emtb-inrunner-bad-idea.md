Awesome man I've been thinking of inrunners because outrunners collect a lot of dirt. Also @MoeStooge has one if the quickest and fastest boards out there and he uses inrunners.

Haha its only capable of 50mph with this setup... i dont wanna ride that fast
Wanna test with this setup how good the unsensored startup is, and how a Inrunner holds up with an Outrunner... 
If this will be nice i would like to find a way to gear it much more down and go with 12S and Encoder...

looks cool bro... Beastly there are some nice 56/57-112/114mm inrunners out there. Cool find, all the low kv motors I found were rated for crazy super high voltage.
those long cans will suck up some major amps!
how many poles and slots are they running?

Yeah they call crazy high voltage for that SSS ... about 100Volt max Input :fearful:

I have to check for slots and poles.... maybe you can see here ???

**Yo dude!**
what's with the planetary gear drive looking thing in the middle of the last pic, have you got a gear reduction on it?
sic dude...
Looks like you have 18 slots (less cogging than 12), I can't tell the number of poles. The magnets are wound to the shaft under the kevlar/dyneema synthetic fibre. Most are 4 pole although you can get 2, 6 and the occasional 8.
How many W are they?

This are the specs of the SSS56114
- BL Motor 56114

- 6 poliger Rotor, armiert

- 390KV  (upm / Volt)

- max. 45000 upm

- d= 56 mm x l= 114 mm

- LK 30 mm / M4

- Welle 10 mm x 30 mm

- max. 102 Ampere

- max. 118 Volt

- 13000 Watt

- 1180 g

how many volts are you going to run it at?
if v x a = w
50.4v (12s) x 102a = 5140.8w

[quote="Nowind, post:15, topic:39795"]
6 poliger Rotor, armiert

so 6p18n or 6 pole 18 slot...

If i could get it on 12S it would be very nice ... but i need a very good gearing with this high KV

First Test with 8S : 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F21aUbcduSw&feature=youtu.be

Not BAD imo, ridicoulus high kv... 
maybe less cogging then a APS-240kv on same gearing/battery setup

Dreaming from 12S - VESC6 - Encoder :sunglasses:

Great job, monster torque! Maby this Inrunner thing will catch on and someone some day will start developing a high amp 12s electronic delivery system that would mirror vesc functions that can handle a high kv high amp inrunner. Welcome to higher efficiency, more torque, cooler temps and reliability. We can't have our cake and eat it to yet, but we can see it and smell it. Be the master over your throttle cause that Inrunner beast will dump you on your ass!! Once again  Great Job!!

Like you enthusiastic ! 
Will test this with Vesc6, should be able to handle the erpm

Joking aside, I saw on hackaday that someone was developing an esc based in the vesc that could work with 600v and 600amps, definitely overkill for an esk8 though

Yes this is the Flame Dirtpipe.
Its a beautiful truck which is very well made out of overall machined aluminium.
From turning ability i prefer the Trampa Channeltrucks because you just get more steering IMO.

I know him and his first board.
The one with Single Motor Dual Drive with Inrunner Motor.
Really powerfull, really nice fights on the the last two masterships :+1:
The newer board which you posted pictures from i dont see in action, hope for 2018 mastership !!!
