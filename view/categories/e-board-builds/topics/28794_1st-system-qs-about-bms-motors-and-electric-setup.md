Hi all!
So I've caught the E-Longboard fever, and I've made 80% of the purchases already made:
4X51P 5000mah, 2 VESC's, Mechanics+brackets and a complete board.

As you've notice the motors are still a dilemma, although I think 6355 are fine cause of the dual setup, I don't know which brand to choose: Alien \ cheap aliexpress \ Maytech? any other suggestions, and what are the differences? 
If my gear ratio is 3 do I have enough power (2400W each) for 230KV? 

The electrical setup is two 5S in series for 10S heaven, so two of those for each motor, but wait, do I conjoin them just before the ESC's with a 'dual Y' connection? or use them as a separate systems only connected in the signal path (master-slave)?

Moving on to the charging part- I want all them batteries to charge simultaneously, then comes BMS and a power brick. Can I connect all the 20 cells to the balanced lid at the BMS and to the power brick?

That's enough for 1st post, help is much appreciated!

I'll answer <i>some</i> of the questions...

It's recommended to run 190-200 kv with a 10-12S setup; you might be okay with the larger kv motor but you'll probably have to reduce the eRPMs.

Yup, connect the VESCs in parallel to the battery.
