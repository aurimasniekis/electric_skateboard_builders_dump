Never even thought of that. If you are, make a build log and document it!

It'll be somewhat limited in terms of power and range, but hot swappable packs will solve the range issue at least.

Plan to run 2 of these...
So 36v 
18ah
360 watt hours
So esentially a 10s setup..

no...

you‚Äôll get 36v 9ah. the limiting factor is the discharge, not the capacity or voltage

I think Makita uses VTC6 Cells which have a pretty good discharge, dont know about others

I would had thought 30 Samsung 25r  18650 cells would be plenty enough to power an eboard or am I missing something?

I like the way power tool batterys have pretty good water tightness, quick release and plug into a charger effortlessly.

What would be the coolest thing is 3D printed module that has 6+ receptacles that sits between the feet on a trampa which allows to you plug in/replace the power packs for charging.

I'm looking at a weeny Ryobi pack with 5 probably not great cells and no doubt nicklel plated connections, but it's hardy and utilises space very efficiently, probably all that could be changed and I think there is a charging pcb in there for balancing which could go to make room for a 6th cell.

But I guess people like decreet packs flexy under the deck, I like the shit out of that ^

Cheers acido..
Ive got like 20 plus batterys i use for work so its bit of a no brainer for me to try and use these compared to buying a 12s setup.
Pros being.. batts can be dual/multi purposed
No enclosures needed
When flat can easiy change out
Able to travel on plane/over seas
No need for bmc/Can charge quick using dewalt rapid charger
Tough rugged casings with built in batt moniters and pretty mch best cordless batt on the market made with samsung 25r cells.. not cheap lipo or china cells..
Only downside is where to mount them and there weight...

How cool to use your tools to get to work, then use them for work, this has legs! I'd be keeping a close eye on that on-site

connectin in series = double voltage, no increase in aH or amperage output
connecting in parallel = double aH and amperage output, no increase in voltage

If you got a shit ton of those, you can disassemble them, cut the weight in half and the size too

I think he wants to use just two packs, each pack has a 5s2p config

was thinking of the same, little different battery pack only cause i have a bunch of these already for work like what @banjaxxed mentioned.  little bit smaller than dewalt. was thinking of running underneath board as to have access to them along the side edge of board.  with any battery like this multiple charges could help.  will be keeping an eye on this project.

EDIT: pretty soon i'll HAVE to bring my board to work.  Between the batteries, "bad ass speakers", spot lights, all I need is to figure out how to strap the laptop to it. (mobile office) :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I think largest capacity in that form is 12v 3ah in the ‚ÄúM12 3.0‚Äù.

All in all no matter what‚Äôs used I think main issue would be connections & vibrations associated with skateboards.  Unless pull it apart, but than drill won‚Äôt workü§¨

Im thinking i can run x2 9ah batts for a 10s3p setup or x4 6ah for a 10s6p setup..

```
if each battery is 5s2p 9ah ans say you have 2 of them you can do two things run parralel and have a 5s4p 18ah battery or run series and have 10s2p 9ah battery. so do you want higher ah/parralel or higher voltage/series

@ stormboard1. Each batt is 5s3p. I want to run 10s3p but will that be enough or would i better of with a 10s6p?

## \#26 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-03-05T11:12:42.445Z Reads: 134

```
It really depends on what cells are in the battery and what amount of current the bms can output. I would say the 10s6p would be best just because it will put less stress on the cells and bms and give more range

There samsung 25r cells... dnt need to worry about bms at this stage.. but i want to run dual 6734 motors.. what range can you expect frm a 10s3p setup?
```

## \#28 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-03-05T11:22:49.086Z Reads: 135

You would be looking at somewhere around 30km. You probably should worry about the bms as that would currently be the limiting factor

your gunna need open one without breaking it (probably hard as they wont want this done) or more likely someone has opened these already ..check endless sphere forum. your going to need a 10s bms if you wire them in series.. @MysticalDork arent you thinking of using these in your ebike?

A good read.. and even more exciting is the fact dewalt are planning to realse there 12ah batts and x4 sequential rapid charger.. i think it might be a bit excessive for a standard street board but if you 3d printed a base to hold x4 of the dewalt flevvolt batts for say like a mountain board to sit on the top it would be the perfect setup...

Picture for size comparison... i could fit the 5ah underneath the deck but there only 5s2p.. or i could fit x2 9ah batts on top by my tail of deck to give me 10s3p setup.. or possivly run risers and run x4 6ah batts underneath for a 10s6p 12ah setup...

While im taking photos this is my dewalt bluetooth cordless amp.. would be pretty easy to install onto a deck/enclosure.. forgot the watts but she pumps.. had it hooked up to x2 studio speakers with built in passive radiator drivers on the side... 12ah last for like a week..

Hi so if you double the ah and amp would it give you more range ? More than double ?
