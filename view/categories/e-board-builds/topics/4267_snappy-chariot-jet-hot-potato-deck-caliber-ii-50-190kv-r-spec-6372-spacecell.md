Almost all the parts have now been purchased, so its time to start my offical build thread. 

As a first time builder my flip-flopping on what I want to do has been monumental. If my understanding of electronics was better and If money was no object, I am it would have been more of a no brainer.  @RunPlayBack most recent dual hub build nailed what I aspired to build. But, unfortunately the current AUD rate (shipping kills it!) has made it less affordable to buy in the states so I've switched gears to purchase here in Australia and keep the pretty much kept the design more modest. Special mention to @LEVer and @torqueboards for graciously fielding my questions over the last few weeks... stand up guys that I hope to do business with at some point in the future. 

I wanted to keep this fairly compact and lightweight for my 195lbs - 6'3" frame as I will likely be toeing it on and off the tram.

The hit list already purchased or on its way:

1. Landyatchz Topspeed 34"

2. Enertion R spec 6372 :

8. 10s3p Spacecell

Final part to purchase today/tomorrow:

1. 12mm pulley kit from Enertion

2. VESC - (Chaka's was intended but coupled with shipping to Aust. became too much). So I hope to secure one of the new Enertion VESC for the next shipment. 
3. Wheels - I've narrowed this down to one of 3 options. Either the ABEC 11 Flywheels (83mm) or clones, Orangutang Kegels (80mm) or the new Evolve Black/Orange combo wheels (83mm).

Since I am going with more or stealth black look I am really interested in the new Evolve wheels. I imagine they would be of decent quality urethane and would work well with the Enertion. If I went with the Kegels, I'd have to work out another mount system than whats currently available for Enertion. I wonder if I can modify the Evolve fully to work with my set up? 

More to come in the upcoming days...

Any flywheel compatible wheel pulley should work for the Evolve wheels. I really like the look of them as well and would snag them up if they were available on Evolve USA's site. Keep in mind that if you plan to use Enertion's wheel pulley, you'll have to cut off some of the hanger on your trucks to fit the pulley. Enertion's trucks already has a modified hanger.

@Jinra thanks I was just realising that whilst researching truck angles just now. I remember seeing a post from @longhairedboy doing that very thing not too long ago to fit an Evolve pulley. LHB any tips when doing this? It looking like I'd only need to take about 15mm off.

Received a couple more packages today;  Spacecell, Sulaco Enclosure, Caliber trucks and the Enertion remote. 
Unfortunately the remote arrived with a broken B button, but I am hoping that I can fix this easily enough. 

@RunPlayBack your enclosure is looking great on the 34" Topspeed with the preformed curve aligning to the concave of the board almost to a perfect match. It also covers all graphics except the landyatchz wreath at the bottom which actually look pretty nice. The cell only just squeezes into the enclosure... so much so that I don't think I'll need to add any foam to pad it out.  I imagine this could be attributed to there being a a small amount of variance in the size of each Spacecell. 

Caliber trucks look awesome. @Jinra you'll be pleased to hear that I've gone ahead and ordered the GT wheels. However, Evolve called me today to say that they wouldn't actually be getting spare wheel stock until the end of the month. The tech was very interested in what I was planing to use them on :slight_smile:  Since I'll still be waiting on the VESC at that point, I might as well wait it out.

Looks good man, not sure if it came with the trim but I usually use this to put along the edges for some weatherproofing, also neoprene strips can help as well.

This is a new spacecell to me, but I purchased it from someone who ordered it at the beginning of the year. I think he waited almost 3 months due to the cell importing issues. It is new though and never run on a board. 

Thanks Rik I did notice you've used that trim on your builds. It provides some weather sealing but I think It also cleans up the edge line of the abs. Time to take a trip to autozone.

Another delivery today... Man this motor is bigger than I thought. It's a beast! I did notice that there is some sort of glue on a couple sections on the windings which I assume is normal ( see photo)Just the vesc and my gear 12mm pulley and belt from Enertion to go!

Don't worry about the glue. It can happen and will not make your motor less powerful.

I started to layout the deck and comments tonight and have a question regarding cable management. 

Jason suggests that the best way is to chase them around the back of the truck and back around to the VESC. To do this I'll need to add extensions to the motor wires in order to reach back to the enclose and VESC. Totally obvious as to why a few of you have been routing back through wiring channels!

I've attached a image of an alternative that would work, but I am curious if this less ideal? 

So this has spurred a couple additional questions:

Firstly, does anyone know if the new @EnertionSupport VESC will come pre-fitted with 5.5 female connectors like is seen in Jason's video. Or will it require soldering of wire directly to the vesc?

Secondly if I do indeed chase around the back of the  truck, what is the best wire spec to be used for the extension? 

Thanks guys!

I think you misunderstood each other.
The wires should be orientated to the back and NOT around the truck.
If the wires are facing to the back and your VESC is in front it will form a nice loop and the wires don't kink.

Thanks mate, it does. I think I made a bit of a leap when I said behind the truck because that is where is looks like it wanted to travel. Any thoughts on the forward layout? It doesn't feel like it is going to kink or get in he way, but I feel like the is a reason why others don't usually go this way... Maybe just the look.

No not just the look.
The truck has more travel in the front and the cables inside the motor will fail.
We had some cases in the forum.
Wit the loop you get the movement into the rotation point of the truck.

So, I haven't started building anything yet as I am still waiting in a few of the key components. By last night I thought I would charge up the spacecell since it's just sitting there. 

When I plugged it in the power connector came loose inside the shrink wrap. It's still visible from the outside (photo) but it's loose inside. I seem to remember these being held inplace with hot glue maybe? At any rate it's now loose and will need to be reattached. @onloop I am comfortable doing what ever you suggest to reattach. I assume you are okay with me cutting a small hole to relocate and add hot glue? Any comments appreciated.

So I've sold the Topspeed and picked up a Jet Hot Potato. At 35.5" I'd call it the bigger brother of the Jet Spud. It does however come with an unsightly dazed and confused style graphic. One word for it... tacky!
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2044ae8fc670ed7ed97e140405d94ecb0a98b007.jpg" width="666" height="500"> 

So I got to work with the sander, measured up some new mount holes (brining it down to 24.5" WB). I wasn't overly thrilled with the lack of of actionable kick on the tail so the new mount holes helped to shift things back. I added a thin layer of primer/filler and satin black enamel. Coupled with the black Calibers, Khiro shock pads and Evolve wheels looks great.

I took it out on the road to push around and get a feel for the setup and I am impressed all around. Bones Super Reds and these Evolve wheels make for a sweet rolly rally experience. I did however encounter my first taste of wheel bite... OUCH! Granted the trucks are on the loose end of the spectrum, but it caught me by surprise and tossed me onto my ass. It could be due to the shift of the wheel base ( about an inch at each end), but based on the burn marks I don't think it made much of a difference. I thought the 1/4" shock pads would give me enough clearance but I might need a touch more.

Any advice on the setup here would be welcomed. Although in looking at the angle I must have been carving... its pretty tweaked.

So the board is 95% complete!!! Final elements are locktite on the drive train, drilling out for the final enclosure fixings and grip tape. 

I took it for a 15 min blast last night and it was excellent. I'll let the following tell the remaining photos tell the story of the closing chapters. 

Cut down the Hot Potato by and 1" of each end bringing the total length down to 33 1/5". Scolloped 2 ply out underneath the motor mouth to increase clearance and extended the wheel wells out.

Nice looking build! Big fan of the black on black, hides the enclosure to board transition really well. If you take a black sharpe to the screw heads securing the motor wires, they'll look anodized and blend in a little better.

It looks like I have a bit tweaking needed to get it running right.  

1. At first I though it was the region shutoff, but even with the depleted battery I get drop offs when breaking under load. For example, doing 25km and trying to apply a heavy break, it starts to but then drops off and coasts. Brakes gone! Releasing the break and reapplying helps a bit but, its usually because I am going a bit slower at this point. 

This is my current configuration, any thoughts in what could be causing this?

Increase your max input voltage to 57, some people have had problems at 42. Couldn't the bat max be higher? The space cell can go to 40. I've never used a VESC but these are two things that I can see. A search might help you as well

Thanks guys, So far I am pretty happy with how it turned out. @RunPlayBack I've picked up a pretty medium grit from a local skate shop. Cool feature is that it has small perforations every so often to make it easier to avoid air bubbles... So I think its MOB grip. 

Unfortunately it looks like I've got a VESC issue. I've run BLDC for the first few tests but experienced some breaking dropouts. I did some research here on the forum and followed onloop's directions to combat this problem here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lost-of-brakes-when-going-full-speed-enertion-parts/6895 This thread suggests the default presets aren't optimal. 

It ran better but i still had one dropout and now less powerful breaking power. So after much consideration I switched over to FOC. The write-ups on FOC were compelling and sounded like the would suit me better. Well it lasted all of 5 min but it was wonderful! More torque and pickup and nicer to the ears! However as I was accelerating up a small incline it felt it skip a beat then continue fine. Then under acceleration again  it skipped a moment and started coasting :unamused:

I've hooked up to the BLDC tool and I am now coming back with bad motor detection. I ran fault in terminal and it came back with "FAULT_CODE_DRV8302" Bugger. 

So I decided to refreshing the firmware and starting from scratch. Unfortunately this hasn't helped. I've removed the VESC and toughly inspected it under a magnifying glass and everything is clean and intact. I've run motor detection again and same "bad motor detection" This time I can't get the terminal to spit out a fault code though. 

Its a bugger because had I not had the breaking issue I probably wouldn't have been altering the settings... it seemed to be great in most other ways. Is there any other trouble shooting that can be done, or is this VESC bricked?

The problem of breaks cutting off when breaking very hard could be triggered by the VESC high temperature protection. Usually that will limit also the acceleration going uphill. To check if it's that or not you need to do the hard braking test straight away before doing any hills and before doing your first km/mile so your vesc is still cool. Hope you get your vesc repaired soon, it really sucks when it breaks :/

I am pretty sure the breaks weren't related to temp issues as it happens on the very first ride after a few minutes on flat. I feel like it must be related to the  settings, perhaps regen spiking currents too high for the vesc? Thanks for the condolences :disappointed:

Oh damn sorry Ben :frowning: Sorry about the VESC, I wish I could help but my settings are a little different because of my components. I think there's a few recent threads about this exact failure. FOC has never failed me (knock on wood) but again it just might be my combo of components that seem to work together.

I am still trying to figure out (with my still elementary knowledge) what was causing my breaking issue and I found the "Choosing the right KVfor the VESC thread" which made for interesting reading. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/choosing-the-right-motor-kv-for-the-vesc/3125/171?u=crabolsky
[quote="longhairedboy, post:171, topic:3125"]
BTW that issue also happens at 10S if you put enough force against those brakes.
[/quote]

Your post about @Photorph upset when bombing down a hill struck me as potentially being related to my issue. Do you think its possible that little old me (200lbs) travelling 30-35kph on flat, could trigger the same result under hard breaking? I really wouldn't have expected it considering I am running all Enertion parts to spec, under default Enertion VESC settings. More than happy to work through the best settings in BLDC tool, just wanting to limit trial an error (since this error was at the cost of the VESC).

that board looks really great, nice and clean, also a great touch with the black evolve wheels! really great job :smiley:

sorry about your vesc, looks like its fried. I hope you didnt run into the bldc -> vesc switching bug of the BLDC gui. before jacob posted a fixed bldc tool, I kept uploading new firmware before setting either bldc or foc to be sure that nothing bad will happen.

running with FOC now for something around 1000km on my vanguard and I also set it up on my spud.

your vesc settings are very protective with 40 motor ampere and 25/-12A battery and the 42V battery max input voltage. if the vesc runs into any of these limits, it will shut down with a DRV error, red LED blinks a few times and then it will be back 3-4 seconds later (which is what you experienced).

I would suggest to:
* increase max voltage to 45+
* use 70/-70A motor limits
* use 50/-20A+ battery limit, maybe even more negative, like 50/-50A to completely be on the safe side under braking conditions

I would think, that you run into either -40 or -12A limits when braking and the vesc goes into DRV error. increasing these values (well, decreasing, making them more negative) will allow for more braking power. I set my limits quite high, because in the end, hard braking is a LOT more important than your cells ... it could just safe your ass in a shitty situation. you wont have to brake hard under normal circumstances, but it sure is nice if you can rely on it when you need it. overall the hard off vesc behavior is really not what you want in those moments.

Thanks all for the kind words!

And thank you for the great post Simon, I appreciate your thoughts. Your explanation on what I was experiencing and why sounds pretty right on. You know it didn't realise that there was a BLDC tool update as well! I was aware of the firmware update (which I installed), but I am still running the BLDC tool which I downloaded in July.... I see there was an updated one released 2 weeks ago! Shit, I may have fallen victim to the switching bug. I assume you are referring to the max current ramp step issue? Or was there another?

Before I switched to FOC I did actually catch that issue in another post and change the value to .004, but when I when back in it looked like it switched back to 4.0

Your re-flashing certainly is a cautious way to go, but it sounds like this is the key. I didn't do that and it may have cost me. 

Again than you for your feedback on the settings. The below is the test settings that I believe you listed above^^ let me know if I am hearing you correctly? 

What is your suggested order of operations for the first setup? My thinking is as follows:
1. Connect to VESC
2. Under BLDC tab > Run motor detection > Apply results
3. Read configuration (motor) then set up motor config with preferred settings.
4.bSwitch motor type to FOC 
5. Write configuration

Is that about it, or should I be also switching any other settings? 

I am getting there... I guess the first build is the hardest!

screenshot are now pretty much exactly my settings :slight_smile:

about the order of things: no need for bldc motor detection if you want to run foc. for me the order of things has been:

general motor configuration:
* read config
* setting up all limits (my settings are 100% your screenshot values)
* switching to FOC
* write config

* in FOC tab -> run motor detection, write config
* set up controller

ah, nearly forgot, you got a space cell, so probably its better to run on 40A battery max so you wont blow the fuse (which was 40A I think?).

Thats @cesargrimmelprez it took that shape as a result best path around the truck without stressing the wires. Simple plastic cable management clips hold it in place.

Mikey,  I can honest;y say the "big boy" R spec has not left me wanting any additional power/torque. No doubt dual drive would offer a more robust drivetrain and torque up hills... however this set up hasn't let me down yet. *Full disclosure- I haven't been able to get it back on the road and really push it since my vesc issue of 3 weeks ago (still waiting on the replacement from Enertion "platinum warranty")*

From my perspective, the big 6372 is a great option if you want to go a single motor set up. I wanted to go single to keep the cost down a bit, but also to keep it as light as possible.

Took the chariot out for the 3rd ride tonight on FOC tonight and I couldn't be happier! This bad boy pulls so hard  that I even let out a giddy little scream of delight! Moving from 20-25kmp to 38kph still has so much torque! Hill climbing is also impressive.

I had a little scare with a a couple cut outs in the acceleration, which I thought was a related to a vesc overload. Taking the board out again tonight, it showed nothing but perfection. For those interested the below settings are what I've setup (via @whitepony).
