What makes a killer commuter board??? 
Is it size? power? weight? maneuverability? comfort? looking awesome?
Let us know why your setup works well and what is important to you. 

To start the thread I'll share my experiences.
As daily esk8 commuter, I have tried to solve this dilemma a couple of different ways but haven't got it quite right yet. 

My current board is a customised 33" torqueboard carbon fibre deck, dual 6355 (rspec) motors, 10s2p battery, Nano X, Caliber II rear and Gullwing Sidewinder front truck (I need that super tight radius when skating in the city). 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/0/2011e8244e6898214e2895045f9e79ee50f76d3d.jpg" width="666" height="500">

One of the most important things to me in a commuter is a kicktail. Being able to tic tac and kick the board up to get over kerbs is super helpful. The torqueboard carbon fibre doesn't have a proper kicktail. So after some irritation I designed and 3D printed one to fit the deck, which made the board wayyy more usable as a commuter board.

The board for me is still just too heavy, the dual motor setup and 10s2p battery adds some decent weight to the board. So I'm planning on trying a single motor (6374 190kv) instead of the dual, to see how that helps with the weight.

Any further suggestions or anyone else have their own commuter boards and ideas???

The "Widow Maker" according to my workmates.

My 34" (?) commuter. Just a 5035 on the back, more than enough for me (for now). Only had it for a week.

Currently in the process of building a commuter board. For me the most important things are comfort, maneuverability, and being light weight.

Planning a single drive with a  6374 (may downsize to a 5055 in the future), with a mount by @marcmt88 with dual idlers so I can have a loose belt and get that natural cruising feel like a real skateboard. Genuine 76mm abec-11 flywheels for comfort and light weight. 10s2p Li-on. 

Planing on using a deck somewhere between 28" and 32" to make it maneuverable. I'll update with pictures once it's done.

globe geminon 35" deck (on sale for $50), 12s3p 25r, 6374 sk3 sensored hybrid, 90mm flywheels, 15mm 15/40t pulleys.  put medium orangatang nipple bushings, thing turns on a dime.  not as confident at speed but great for running around short distances.

10s2p 30q battery, just enougj to uni an back. With some big inclines.
Single 6374 sensored, not ideal with 2p only, but perfect for pure commuting.
Usb charge ports for mobile or tablet while at uni.
And at 5kg and with the small size just perfect :)

I'd love to build a small 10s2p liion but am worried about voltage sag.  Anybody have any experience with a battery that size? Worth the weight savings? Or would you be better off lugging the extra weight of 10 cells for 10s3p?

if youre using HG2 or 30Q cells the voltage sag will be tolerable, especially with conservative settings. The Koowheel uses a 10S2P and the sag is barely noticable because of the way they have the ESC tuned.

my board is a bit of a long range commuter. it weighs a toooooon (pushing 25lbs)
anyways, it’s git a single 6374, 97mm clones, and 10s6p. It is a bit of a powerhouse for a single motor build. it

oh yea it’s on a 37” vugenhausen

A cheaper, albeit bulkier alternative is to get angled wedges or risers and adjust the baseplate that way.

The spud 29 or the bindings or the whole thing?  Its a fun deck, not the most meticulously crafted, as the wheel wells are dissimilar.  The shape is great though and with bindings its a tank.

If I was gonna rebuild it Id do it as a single 6374 with a 10s2p 30Q pack using a FocBox in FOC.  That would shave about 4 pounds and still have decent torque and range, plus FOC is quiet as a ghost.

This is for commuting 5km to the train. Its 36" 2015 Arbor high ground deck with dual 6065 140kv on 12s. 97mm clones

 Important things for me are
**- Reliable** 
**- 100% water proof.** 
It rains a lot here. I even went through a 4 inch deep puddle and was fine! It was dark and didnt realize how bad it was. 
**- Can take sharp U-turns but also stable at 40kph.** 
I have both trucks wedged to 55 deg. The rear truck has stiffer bushings and is tighter than the front one. 
**- Good brakes**
**- Hill climb power.** 

Yeah its heavy to carry, but I wanted a do it all board.

I went kinda overkill with the water proofing as I ride in heavy rain and did previously kill one vesc from water when it got in a lunch box. I have 3 levels of water proofing. Firstly all the electronics are in a good quality lunchbox, this keeps out all the water in light rain but in heavy rain or hitting large puddles at high speed it leaks a tiny bit. I put in some paper towel when rain is heavy and it soaks up any water so its not splashing around inside. Secondly the vesc's are coated in a silicon spray to water proof them, thirdly they are covered in heavy a shrink wrap with the ends hot glued. 

You can see detailed pics here.

I would use some thermal epoxy and glue some small cannibalized southbridge heatsinks on those FETs before coating the esc dude and then mask off the heatsink and then waterproof it..the best waterproof job I have seen on esc's was with heatshink and epoxied ends with exposed heatsink, it worked perfectly..

I have _no_ idea. What is it that you are worried about with clearance?

Yeah, exactly.  Thinking the 90mm may hit the deck.  I'll have to start researching Caliber ii 50 clearance with 90mm and see if I'd expect any bite.  Going to read up some more on the forum here and see what i can find out

My trucks aren't Caliber trucks BTW. They were from a HobbyKing kit.
