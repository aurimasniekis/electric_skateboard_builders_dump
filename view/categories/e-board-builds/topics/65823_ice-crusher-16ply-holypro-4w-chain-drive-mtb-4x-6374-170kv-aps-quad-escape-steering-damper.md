So, time to move on...
After my setback and a long vacation I finally have some parts together to start my winter project.
The plan is to build a 4W chain drive MBT, which can handle all weather conditions during the Russian winter.
Unfortunately my 6374 APS motors will be back in stock only in 3 weeks according to @AlienPowerSystem last info, so I guess it will take roughly 5 weeks from now till I get them to Russia...
At the moment I also don´t know how long it will take till @stewii is ready to ship his second patch of ESCAPEs...
So I decided to split my project in different steps.
For now I will use my parts I have to get me back on the (off) road.
Here a small impression of what I need to get together in the next days
![Delivery|449x500](upload://a7PQVx1V5XdNubhTI5fThBxTMb5.jpg)


The board already set up with dual 6384 170kV APS motors
Things I have to do next
- install the steering damper (front or back truck)
- design and 3D print a dual focbox case
- design and 3D print a battery box for the 5ah heavy duty Lipos
- solder split plugs
- solder wires to the Bluetooth modules
- solder all cables with plugs
- solder adapter for motor sensor wires (or maybe I just cut them and directly solder a 2mm HST plug to them)
- 3D print some GT2B mod cases and install the electrics

and finally, wait the Lipos arriving from the custom clearance....

.

[/quote]

I have both rear and front and from my experience, only the front needs to be set up regarding your ride conditions (heavy all road and smooth asphalt bike path).
The rear one can be let at the same setting.

I only have one which I can install on the front or in the back
so in my case you would recommend to install it in the front as only there it´s necessary to adjust the strength.
In the back I would go with yellow or red dampas

Nice to hear that you are back after the accident! Good luck on the build and remember to NOT use the same connector for charging and vesc connector. Cool build! Looking forward to see the end result!

😅no for sure i‘ll not use the same connectors again. Learned my lesson.
For that built i‘ll go with lipos on top so that I can take them out for balance charging in a save place.
I will also add a fuse to the main power wires from the battery to the vesc. No switches only antispark xt90 which I can disconnect easy and fast in case something went wrong...let’s knock on wood that it will not 😉

Thx man! Need to update the build log...
But no time...it always looks like, only some connections, screws and soldering...and in the end I spend evening after evening to get all together and running smoothly 😅
Hills here not that much unfortunately, but I want to get a good traction in snow and on ice. So I guess it’s never bad to have all wheels under control

If you want traction on snow and ice you either need bigger wheels, better profile or Spikes. It wont help if you can run each Motor Individually when You slide on ice.

Cool project. Sounds like waterproofing, chain rust and traction will be your most challenging issues, although I'm speculating on the chains. I haven't run then myself. You could see if @barajabali can still get get those 8" snow chains or check out @Duffman's monster 4wd that he put extra wide rims and studded tires on. I'm slowly building up a 4wd belt driven board with 10" tires, but it won't ever see snow; just possibly an occasional golf course. ⛳

Thx for the links. 
I got through both of them already a time ago and also asked for the 8“ winter chains but didn’t got an reply unfortunately. 
The duffman monster is crazy.
Would like to go in that direction, but unfortunately my tools here very restricted.
So i can just try to get the best out of my situation.
Waterproof is definitely one of the main priorities.
How the chains will last in the winter...let’s see.
If it’s not practical i can always change back to belt drive no problem.

ok, first things done, as usual with some set backs...
I figured out that the deck I received was the wrong ply.
Luckily we could figure out an arrangement and my new deck is on the way.
For now I started with the 15ply as I wanted to get back in the work.
- 3D printed dual Focbox case is done.
- 3D printed battery box is done
- got some new griotape, as I really didn't like the trampa stock griptape on the holypro.
- installed the steering damper on the front axel 
- changed the bullet connectors on the focbox to 5.5mm :scream: guess now I lost my guaranty :joy:
- jst 2mm extension for the aps motor sensor wires done
- Bluetooth module done
- 8AWG power cables from battery to the vescs done
- fuse serial plug for the battery box done

I was quite surprised that soldering 8AWG to the xt90 was so easy. read a lot of people here had some issues.
I used a small thin gauged an twisted it around the end, than added some solder to the wire and to the plug, heated up everything and put it together.
My new friend is liquid tape...just used it for all open metallic parts I found.
![8AWG|240x320](upload://AvmjtH2A1ctooDWYfgZnuzwTF2y.jpg)
Maybe it looks not so accurate, but the result is what matters!
My battery box is equipped with a xt90 serial plug in which I integrated a 58V 100A fuse. Hope I choose the right size. If not I can change it to 80A or 125a which I have as spare too.
![Fuse_split|299x320](upload://toDzl1Ytr2D5QXkGqhuBmpbSPyr.jpg)

This weekend it was finally at the time to set up the focboxes
Everything went well till the motor detection...
than this happened
![Broken_Magnet|240x320](upload://yhxdCoDoECp6Kzg3vE7kApH2WMk.jpg)

Don´t know what it caused to fail, but now I´ll need to find a replacement for this motor...

Small update:
As one of my APS 6384 motors broke while motor detection I needed to find an alternative to come back on the road...
Luckily my old sealed 6374 motors from eskating.eu survived the fire and only the wires where burned.
So I decided to open them up, clean them and set the wires up again.
The problem with it, they have a 8mm shaft, the APS motors 10mm and so does all the new motor sprockets unfortunately too.
I have two 15mm 15th motor pulleys, but here the next problem appears...all the belts I have are too short....
So I ordered a set of new belts.
As I didn´t want to wait till the belts come from china, I thought why not to use the opportunity to 3D print my own 66th pulley which should fit than to the longest felt I have at home...
And as result I got this:

![pulley|375x500](upload://kimx6eea6BjictoIO4tkDkN2D9t.jpg)

I think not so bad for the next time.
Tonight I need to print the second one and than theoretically I could get things running :grin:

The APS motors I ordered, still not sent...
They promised to get the new batch this week, so I patiently wait for my order as min three more weeks.

Meanwhile this arrived:
![Escape|375x500](upload://trLCKhGEiVek7BbT8PS5EnZpcc7.jpg)

Thx @stewii for the escapes, @LukePL for the spare dual case and @moon for the two Flipsky 6.6. Very happy that everything passed the customs without problems!
The order from unik boards @okp unfortunately got stuck at the customs and it was not that easy to get them explained what it is, for what I need it and so on and so on...my bad Russian knowledge made it not more easy :sweat_smile: took good 2 weeks of brining different documents till it´s finally made it to my home.
But I already like my Freeride bindings and the new sprockets for my Superstar hubs :grin:

had a lucky sunny weekend and could finally take the board for a ride.
that´s how it looks in wild life...
![IMG_6062|375x500](upload://w4Z9TosO5b6RRWZPjoXUqsv1zjq.jpg)![peter_paul|375x500](upload://ykbMfGAfhHkttXK7whVoUTULDLP.JPG)

I´m a bit disapointed about the steering damper.
Was hoping to get a bit a bigger range of variation from tight to lose.
Riding my board here in Russia is always a bit a kind a strange.
Don´t wanna know in how much videos I have been again on the weekend...
It´s not common here. There millions of E-Scooter on the road, but a e-MTB is hard to catch.
Unfortunatly I run in the next problem.
I can´t get off the nut which hold the wheel on the hanger.
It´s just turning but not moving...looks like the thread is fu..ed....
let´s hope it´s just from the nut not from the hanger :pray:
![IMG_6197|587x500](upload://yEkSJTuiHRIP413Ha6ocAEaCxhd.jpg)

Looks like I´ll need to dremel it somehow off.
If there some other idea, you welcome to give me some advice!

As I can´t upload videos her (and my youtube not ready)
If somebody interested you can find me and some short clips of my last weekend ride

Just had some dremel time. 
So good to have one at home. Just can recommend everybody to have one at home.
You never know when you gonna need it...
![image|375x500](upload://6f64xlUuvyxxxMLlq7hvjNH9o3b.jpeg) 

Got the nut off quite easy...and way much more fast as I thought.
Unfortunately the thread of the truck totally fucked 😬 still don’t understand how it could come so far. The trucks where like new and I didn’t tighten the nut too much.
![image|375x500](upload://rwiKBjmCF9kmXoJl3x0W6Camn2E.jpeg) 

Does anybody know if there is a way to recut the thread?
I don’t have big hopes, also not to only replace the shaft as the shaft should be pressed inside the truck and I don’t have the tools to get it out.
If there is a way to fix it, i would appreciate to get some idea!

Probably i‘ll need to order a new hanger 😔

Didn´t updated this here for a while so let´s get together what happened in the last weeks.
I orderd a new infinity hanger and one more set of superstar rims.
chrome/black to hold it a bit more decent.
When the hanger arrived I realized that they come without plastic inserts and nuts :see_no_evil: ...totally overseen that... unfortunatelly I also couldn´t find the right size of nuts in any of the hardware shops close to my home.
So no way around to order and wait another 1,5 week for the missing parts...
meanwhile the APS motors arrived after 2,5 month backorder waiting and 3 weeks UPS document trouble war....
the problem with it, the damn order wasn´t complete... I ordered 4 motors but they sent only 2...
![APS_Motor|367x500](upload://ffVfp8Bznnjx9ynHkrkR1Ln9lfu.jpeg) 
nevermind, I opened the motors and sealed the sensors like usual.
I could fix the one 6384 motor with the replacement bell which they sent me.
Till the coating got dry I used my old set up to have some first jumps in the park
https://vimeo.com/295000688

But than it was time to change to dual 6384 170kV and chains
https://vimeo.com/294969167
 
I very much like the setup and the sound of the chains.
The torque is nicer with 170kV instead of 190kV. 
Definitly noticable. But I also lose about 2km range out of my 5ah Lipo packs, which probably comes with the more agressive riding and the chains them self too.
In the last week weather became better and I startet to adjust my motor and bat max values. 
I increased slowly the values till I reached now 50a bat max 80a motor max on each foxbox.
The temp of the focboxes max out at 55degrees and the motors at 65degrees. The max bat current I reached till now was 35a for each focbox.
I still wait for the two missing motors to arrive.
So for now now quad drive. Probably also not in the next weeks as I like the "light" setup and enjoy to practice more jumping.
I´m looking now to get some more Lipos to get more range.
I have two sets of 5ah lipos which last each about 30min, than I need to swap them.
I also added some lights under the board
![lights|375x500](upload://u9x2D5znN8vnKR7A4ESf6SUsqE9.jpeg) 
I´m sure they will not last long as I hit a lot of stones and wood, but it becomes very fast dark already and my front light´s still not arrived. 
Let´s see, for now it works and I like the look...

I finally came back to cut some videos  (before I cut mainly vacation videos...) 
I hope I can improve my riding and video cutting skills in future and I hope you guys will like them too.
Here one last short ride in my park close to home

those are 5V LEDs. They work with a USB and a small power bar which I just added on the velcron stripe of my deck.
I have a step down converter laying around too, but as it is not the final stage of the build I was to lazy to integrate it in my Lipo set up.

I have mixed feelings about the APS motors.
I a little bit lost the trust in the hold of the magnets when one of them became lose or broke during motor detection...first need to get back to it.
I realized that from about 40km/h the sound they make change to some kind of high screeming noice. Till now I couldn´t locate if it´s only one or both motors and if it´s just there own frequenz which lead to it, or if there is a lose winding, magnet or screw.

Yikes, been hearing about the magnets falling off during motor detection. Also about the noise. I wonder if they've been having QC issues recently, would explain some of this.

An unfortunate, common occurrence with Trampa. I too have played the 'waiting game' a few times and now make sure i order extra parts so I hopefully don't get caught out as much in the future.
Your build is coming along real nice and the videos are great as they help to show the areas that you ride. Thanks also for mentioning your current batt and motor settings - this gives people like me a bit of a 'bench line' for setting things up.

Dogs and moving objects........I once had a tricopter snatched from the air by a dog whilst flying FPV and didn't even know it was there. I ended up with a broken prop and the dog ended up with multiple cuts to its snout. I guess the advantage with a board is that you have a better chance of seeing the dog, and possibly outrun it too.

Small update. I installed some head lights this weekend. I used this 12v lights 
Schau, was ich auf AliExpress gefunden
https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/bXJvmqfC

They get there power from this powerbar 
Schau, was ich auf AliExpress gefunden
https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/cGmkivom
Which is kind a handy. It’s waterproof with space for 6x 18650 and a 12V and a 5V usb output.
The usb plug was unfortunately totally crap so ich soldered on a xt60.

The headlights running with the 12V output and the LED stripe with the 5V output.

I made a quick 3D printed holder for the lights but don’t think it will stand the vibration long.

For now it works and I think for 25€ (without 18650s) the result is not so bad

Had a long bus trip yesterday and didn’t know what to do. So I looked through some old videos and cut that together. Sure not the best one, but....

Also the 2x missing 6374 motors finally arrived.
I sealed the sensor last week.
Hope this week I have the time to extant the sensor wires and solder the last cables I’ll need.

Last weekend I finally had some time to put everything togehter.
I removed the steering damper as I was not happy how it performed.
Don´t know, maybe i´m making something wrong, but the steering damper is more lose than yellow dampas. 
Maybe @Pimousse or @Nowind you can tell me if that´s normal for the steering damper?
I expacted a bit a wider range of adjustment and stiffnes. I can turn the front truck so hard that my wheels already close to the deck. Even with the tightest adjustment.
honestly i even don´t feel any big difference between the stiffest and the losest adjustment. Maybe the damper is faulty, idk.
So for now I changed to yellow dampas front, blue in the back.
Hope that soon I´ll get my ordered elastomer damper from @nowind and with it my problem solved anyhow.

![IMG_6943|388x500](upload://qWIBOgy1Plw8CWxx1ybvdai8wKC.jpeg) 

The dual ESCapes are connected via CAN and each side has it´s own GT2B receiver I paired to one remote.

![IMG_6954|375x500](upload://eFNp7iHMJFFXvrMMuSZNxf5jwYP.jpeg) 

Both sides independent from each other.
Means I have a 12S1P Lipo pack for my front ESCapes
and a 12S1P Lipo pack for my back ESCapes.

My initial ESC settings are
Motor max 70A
Motor min -50A
Battery max 50A
Battery min -15A

Unfortunately I couldn´t take it out for a test ride, but I hope during the week or latest on the weekend I´ll get an opportunity for it.
I´m interested how it feels compaired to the dual drive and how much range i´ll get with it.

Seems smart in terms of reliability, but do you plan to increase capacity eventually? 
Also, really loving the dual ESCapes, how are you finding them? And how was the pairing process of the 2 receivers to the one remote?

Independant setup for front and rear sounds smart !
You miss. The CAN BUS added value though (for an overall monitoring for instance).

Regarding the damper, I defo feel a difference in adjustement ! I often set it up while riding when the road conditions change (e.g. going out of a heavy AT ride in forest to a asphalt bicycle path).
I only change front setting.
I borrow my board a friend (she's like 60kg or less) and the setting needed to be really fine for here (she could feel a difference between 2 knob clicks).
Maybe yours is faulty ?

I have another setup with stock Trampa trucks and red dampas. I can't turn at all even with totally loose springs.
I'll swap front trucks for trying this new board and deck with steering damper.
But for me it's defo a added-value !!

I bought a second set of 4 Lipos.
My build is already heavy and it takes just 2 min to swap the packs. 
I hope for 12-16km with one set, so about 30km with both sets. I think that´s enough range for me.

The ESCapes I got in the second round of the group buy. Took ages till I got them, but as the motors took even more long this wasn´t an issue.

The pairing is easy.
I just switched on one side and paired the receiver.
Than switched off and switched on the other side and did the pairing procedure. 
After that both receiver paired to the remote.
I just had to adjust the fail safe on both receiver again.

I also think that something is wrong with the steering damper.
If I remember right you wrote an how to install on the steering damper.
In it you write that you can turn the trigger (or how ever it´s called :sweat_smile:) 360 degree in endless and as soon as you reached on round it start set up from the lightest setting.
This I can´t with mine.
I can turn from 12 till 10 o clock and that´s it.
The thing is to order a new damper for 60€ or more just to try out if it´s getting better or no is expensive. 
But I don´t know a way to find out if the damper is working right or not.

I like them a lot and I like the sound!
I don´t like that they more heavy (especially the wheelpulleys) and that they more stiff.
Means with belt you have a bit more tolerance when adjust your drive train.
I think I lose 2km of range with them too.
But it´s definitly worth it for my purpose.
I would rather go with a gear drive, but for quad it´s kind a too expensive for me at the moment.
Especially as I have two other projects to finish too.

CANBUS is meant for applications like car, so you'll find meters and meters of CANBUS wire.
One meter long for your setup wouldn't be an issue I guess.
Even not sure you need a shielded cable. But this is not so tricky if you use a Ethernet S-FTP cable for instance.

Regarding the steering damper, that makes sense !
Can't you use kind of warranty or so ?

Realized I didn’t updated this here for a while...
So what happened:
I got my board finally out for some rides.
As expacted the range is not double up with double battery and 4motors.
With dual motors and 12s 5Ah range was 8-10km max.
With Quad and 2x 12s 5Ah packs I get about 12km (maybe a bit more in the summer)
I made a short video from the first quad ride
https://vimeo.com/301396681

I also had my first crash...
There was a piece of cut try sticking out of the ground, which I haven’t seen because of fallen leafs... hit it with the front motor mount... made a big front flip out of my bindings and the board was pushed up too and landed like planed directly on me 😬😬😬 just good that I always packed in some layers of safty clothes :joy:
And guys (and girls for sure too) never EVER forget wearing a helmet.
Even if it´s just for the 100m ride to the next shop!!!
The mounts didn’t took any damage and even the light is still ok. Seems I hit the tree only on the corner.  
![image|375x500](upload://y5YhOww5mFgUWTZy6fBZ0xuVH9m.jpeg) 
I checked all screws and connections back home and realized the crash made even one screw flew out and one more to become lose.
That wasn’t the case before the ride.
I now locked really all screws with loctide too.

Meanwhile I also made a set of studded wheels.
Not sure so if they will last long, but if they will, I will make a short how to in here.
![image|375x500](upload://lWf6g9OTGhr0NU7oqVURiZFyUFu.jpeg) 

I didn’t have had a time to install them yet.
Last weekend it finally started to snow and the snow seems to last.
Sure I made a short video of my first ride in the snow.
https://vimeo.com/304017975

Things I realized:
Without heel straps it’s definitely not possible to drive safe. The place where the foots staying get full of ice and snow so fast and that’s really slippery.
So what i have to do in the next days:
Get on the studded wheels
Install the heel straps
And up the motor and battery values.
Aaand down with the motor min settings.
Breaking with quad is kind a tricky with -50a each motor. If you push the trigger to stop it stops...and this stop happens in the same moment 😅 had some critical moments when I was riding first time 😅

That's not much, i guess it is because of low temperatures.
For comparison with my 12s 8Ah MTB and dual motors I usually get 18-23km range (above 15°C) but right now at -1°C the range dropped dramatically to 14.5km.

the 8-10km range where with the dual setup and already 1 month ago, so 10-12 degree.
I checked how much mAh i used when charging the Lipos back up and it was close to 5000mAh. means my range is really that much short ;)
I once got like 18km when I used belts back in the days and only cruizing with my girl at an average speed of maybe 10km/h.
but besides i never came that close.
As I don´t think I drive more aggressive than you :sweat_smile: it´s probably because of the chains. I realized a range loss of about 2km from belt to chain swap.
maybe also the different kV and slightly bigger motors (before dual 6384) has an influence on it.

```
Hard to say but maybe it's 10% to 20% more range with gears compared to belts but I'm not sure. 

Between straight cut gears and helical gears there is no difference in range or perfomance but epic difference in noise, I'm a ghost rider :sunglasses:

Do the chains have more drag than belts?

Last year I had belts, Vesc 4.12, dual 6364 and a 10s 10Ah Lipo and also about 20km range like now with 12s 8Ah (which are about the same Wh). But once I could charge 12Ah into the under rated 10Ah Lipo that's why there must be a difference between belts and gears in range.

But even 20km is like a joke I want much more range for exploring bigger areas and mountains. I'm thinking about 12s5p, 6p or 7p Li-ion. When I calculate with my personal 17,76 Wh/km I get this:

12s5p 30Q 648Wh -&gt; 36,49km | 3kg 
12s6p 30Q 777,6Wh -&gt; 43,78km | 3,6kg  
12s7p 30Q 907,2Wh -&gt; 51,08km | 4,2kg  

Damn 51km :heart_eyes: but very heavy idk.

BTW what's the total weight of your 4WD?

I still don’t understand why my range is so different from yours. 
I don’t think that’s the batterys as those 60c hobbyking lipos and they have like zero sag.
🤔 
I don’t have a scale to weight everything, so I sit down for a minute and wrote everything together.
If I didn’t made any mistake than it should be around 14-15kg at the moment.
Will be a bit more in some weeks with different hubs and wheels 😉

I definitely want more range too.
It’s 26km from work home and next year I want to drive this way more often. As min one way.
But probably not with the quad.
It’s for sure a lot of fun, but it’s way much more comfortable with a light board. More flexibility more jumping etc.

I‘m probably will work out an easy swap system for my next build.
I don’t like to have 5kg of batteries on the board.
Better just 1.6kg and swap them every 10km.
The exchange packs will come into my backpack.
For all those who now say...määäh bit than you have the weight non the less with you.
Yes that’s right, but for me it’s a big difference if this weight is hanging on my legs or sitting on my shoulders.

Thinking of doing the same thing, using the graphene/multistar hobbyking lipo cases and industrial strength velcro, im considering going with 8x of newer HK nano techs plus 5ah as they are super small in size and have less weight than the Graphenes but about the same ompf  

but i am also considering 8x gens ace hard case 6s 4.5ah 60c's as well because of the hard case giving more protection on the back pack rucksack carrying aspect so to speak.

By the way i love this build....much impressive.

Thx first for the kind words!
I was looking a time for this
https://www.gensace.de/tattu-14000mah-22-2v-25c-6s1p-lipo-battery-pack.html
They big but those really good packs for a good price. Thought to use them if I plan longer trips and than just swap them out to light 5Ah packs if I want to go for a jump session or so.
I also like the hard case stuff. 
Don’t own any of them, but after I have seen what @Duffman made with hardcase packs it’s really really cool.
I use the hobbyking heavy duty packs at the moment. The are about 70€ for 6s 5Ah. 
Not graphens, but also only half the price.
Let’s see how much charge cycles they can hold.

HAHA, yup i been looking at those same ones (14000mah's) they are a very good solution less wires to run power through and connect is better and the size is perfect, alas im in the UK and the postage on those direct from Gens ace is savage, and i cant find them anywhere else than on the Gens ace site..... :frowning: 
its because the hardcase (4.5's) ones are on ebay and end up cheaper than buying direct due to postage!! that they are on my list at all.

The heavy duty ones did peak my interest but hadn't seen or heard any reports on them until now.

Think even a bit longer than I already.

If you interested in the tattu lipos than wrote them a message. I have seen in Eu the shipping is crazy hight. They don’t ship to Russia that’s why I got in contact with them and they linked me to the local store here in Russia. They have only some of there lipos here, but the 14Ah I was eying with they have and shipping is like 15€ or so only. Maybe there is something the same in your area too. Or something like a local pic up where you can get around the high shipping costs.

Just to share some other number ^^ with the 12s12Ah15c graphene (2x6s) I can ride less than 20km in hard session and more than 35/40 on flat road cool cruising (9", chain 9x42T, 130kv, v6 70A motor and battery).
 (Andy, I know you already mansion that but isn't the weather actually that disadvantage your battery range ?)

Thx @Riako to through in some more numbers from an experienced rider.
But that can fit together.
I had a range of 8-10km (more 8 than 10😅)
with the 12s 5Ah pack, so that would be 16-20km with 12s 10Ah pack.
Those numbers are for a dual chain drive with 6384 170kV motors.
With the Quad i get about 12-15km out of a 12s10Ah pack. That with 4x 6374 170kV motors.
ESCape settings are bat 50 motor 70a for now. Will pump it up a bit in future, just used some lower settings for the first rides.

I had a ride on the weekend with -7 degree.
Didn’t noticed any big range drop. 
I didn’t drive the battery till the total end, but I got like 10km out at an end voltage of 3.8 per cell.
So should be easy 2 more km left.
My lipos getting out of a warm room and they still slightly warm (maybe 28-30degree) when I come home. Don’t think that the packs get a big influence of the cold. Would be different if I would swap the packs to cold ones in my backpack I think.

next update:
I thought i´ll not need a battery meter, but I change so often my set up and also the weather change so often, that I totally can´t "feel" how long the batteries will last and i´m a bit tired to take my phone always out to double check the battery voltage. So i decided to make a quick fix and add one in the cover of the battery box.
![IMG_7573|375x500](upload://qnZ9fOfxErty5NExIMpCHydEFob.jpeg) 

This week also my @MBS order from black friday finally arrived.
I ordered some 9" wheels and bindings for my quad. The 9.5x28mm bearings are going on my other build.
![IMG_7535|393x500](upload://tDDmNbZbAuNELYcaskZ0dTlTXvs.jpeg)  
I really like the feeling of the bindings.
Super soft but non the less super stable (as min the first dry impression :sweat_smile: )

I´m very happy that I made the decision to try my luck with 9" wheels.
As I wanted to keep the sprokets and stuff for my superstar hubs, it was the best way to go with the hubs from 3DServicas.
They fit the 9" wheels and have the same bolt pattern like the superstar hubs.
The total weight of one wheel with sprocket jumped from about 1kg to close to 1.6kg.
![IMG_7571|375x500](upload://6wbfKTvYaKEH0Trov2BGPCtzpIE.jpeg) 
Usually I would mind about the extra kilos, but the build is already too heavy for any jump sessions etc. , so the extra weight doesn´t matter so much.
Here some more pictures to get a bit a feeling of the size difference between 8" and 9" wheels.

![IMG_7576|375x500](upload://e1XSaTYb7Y0LVI0Up7AVPig2PT2.jpeg) 

I like the clearance now. The 9" was the last missing part to get a real 4WD ready (still thing 10" would be even better, but makes things too complicated. As min for this winter :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )

Now I only need weekend to give it a try... can´t wait for it!

That 9" upgrade looks sick! :sunglasses:
I wonder if you had to use longer spacer nuts for the sprockets and additional spacers on the axles because of the width of the tires (65mm instead of 50mm).

F5 bindings :grin:
I remember my first ride when I couldn't feel/recognize the bindings after some minutes, love the clouds. I'm curious what you gonna say in comparison to Trampa bindings.

Just to leave my opinion here, the Trampa bindings have a more direct feel because of less cushioning but can hurt, also the feet are slightly slipping on the deck, even with heavy Vicious grip tape. The heel straps are moving down all the time. Opening the ratchets is a pain. To say something positive, the Trampa bindings look better.

MBS F5 bindings are fluffy and very comfortable, also the heel straps keep the feet locked. They are moving, too but because of the bigger size it's no problem at all. The bigger toe strap helps against slipping on the deck. In the beginning I was skeptical because of all the plastic instead of aluminium but up to now the bindings withstand any abuse including jumping with my 16kg board.

BTW @Andy87 you have to buy a scale :laughing:  I'm curious what's the weight of your board(s). I mean even with 2WD and 12s 8Ah Lipo my board is 16kg (the Pelicase is 0.9kg).

@rich ... I couldn’t resist anymore...
Here you go included 4x6s 5Ah lipos 
![image|612x500](upload://YyxZFxvfndPFD6OJoLlwbIzQE6.jpeg) 

EDIT: I forgot to add the batteries for my lights...
So I think 25kg is a good total weight 😅

About the rims.
I could safe the same spacer on the truck and with it the same crossbar for the motor mounts etc. That’s one thing you need to consider, if I would have used the trampa or mbs rims it would probably haven’t worked out.
As you can hopefully see, the bearing part stays a bit in the back and the part of the rim where the inner tube lay on stands over on the outer side (sorry for that bad description... my English today 🤦‍♂️)
![image|375x500](upload://2p7uNGgHUsA9Ct4oTsPSiAL4tlz.jpeg) 

About the bindings we had the same first thoughts.
I didn’t expacted the plastic parts on them, but they non the less look solid and they toped with an aluminum part, so that should hold the stuff strong together.
When I first stepped into them, the bindings directly sucked to my feet 😂
Not sure if that will later be good or bad... but i‘ll find out soon.
And like you I would wish to get a bit more color choices. Maybe @mbs we can get as min a white, blue or red version from the f5 bindings next year? I would love to get white with blue. Would directly order them for my second build 😂

I haven't ridden so much a Trampa deck yet ... Or MBS. But what I could say from my many tests on other setup or customer test ride : 
The arc shape is really weird, I like flatten deck under feet or even with concave (like the scrub or mbs deck (with round tips - bird and Dylan W)).
Surprisingly a Trampa feel stiffer. And being used to ride a flexy deck I feel more comfortable on my scrub. MBS hard like no flex for me ^^
My scrub was like a trampoline at first, it's why a vaccum sandwich it with carbon fiber. More responsive, still plenty of flex.
Until I get myself another deck, my custom will stay my fan one.
But I want more stance (Im 1m96 - 45/46 EU size).
I think the right one could be the brand new Colab :star_struck: stiffy but more precision during the ride...
But it depends a lot of the use, rider weight. Off road, run on track, cruise on little trail, or road.

To make short, I guess if I have to buy another one would be neither mbs or Trampa, maybe more an X-shape or the colab ... if I could get it a try ! arg

Also a hear a lot of good feedback from the[Willozboard deck](https://wib-sport.com/mountainboard-electrique/56-5858-willozboard-plateau-ultimate.html#/178-poids_rider-60k_a_80_kg) :

😅 that’s only for comparison. Sorry for to disappoint you. I use only the 9“ wheels but I thought it would be nice to mount them together. Not sure though if the 5 m4 bolts would be enough to hold the two hubs together.
I think for 10“ you need even wider hubs and you would need to extend the trucks too.

12kg is a good goal
![image|375x500](upload://3BgvyIEQfWdpgSGXqA7u2ubTWS3.jpeg) 

I can change the 6384 to 6374 and at the moment I have a fucking heavy steel crossbar mounted, but all in all I think I can’t get less than one more kilo of that.
Ok, maybe if to reduce the lipo pack to 10s 🤔 mount the lipos without cover and take off the extra heatsink from the focbox than maybe I could get it down to 12kg.

How is your master plan to get it that low in weight?

Dual 6355, Fsescs 4.12, 12s 5Ah Lipo, cracked 14ply carver deck :joy:
Not much power but light and cheap. I'm not sure yet if I should go with diagonal drive for best possible balance. Problem is that the mounts will bend without crossbar. Anyway, I'll start a thread soon.

13.6kg is also very light for your setup with 6384, nice!

You not afraid to jump with the cracked one?

Looks realistic with your planed set up.
Now i‘m Interested if I could get mine down to 12kg too 😅
I already feel very good with the 13.6kg (especially if you drive the quad the same day as the light one😂)
I only have the 15ply deck, maybe I could drill some holes extra 🤔
Not sure if I would mount the motors diagonal.
How much is the motor plus mount? Maybe 800g? 🤔 
I think if you place the battery and vescs more close to the front bindings than it could already take a part of the balancing without the need of mounting diagonal.
I had my motor mounts on without crossbar for one ride and they became lose with all the jumps I made. 

Looking forward to your build thread 👌
I‘m sure I can take some inspiration from it to make mine better and lighter for the summer.

I'm afraid for sure but gonna try to break it :laughing:. And i have the crack at the rear now, that's safer. 

13-14kg is light enough for jumping, even my 16kg board is nice for jumping. The only disadvantage is the heavy rear truck with about 3.5kg extra weight. For straight jumping it's no problem but I would like to do (or at least try) 360's and other stupid stuff :grin: That's why I thought about diagonal drive, a motor plus mount and pulley is about 1kg.

Update the last ride in deep snow:
![snow|375x500](upload://a0ZrdDuiY7tI8mXM2rbI31OCQ5N.jpeg) 

First impression of the MBS F5 bindings are super.
Feel way much more locked with them.
First impression of the MBS 9" wheels.... :eyes:
they definitly rock da house....
super good grip even on snow. didn´t expact that.

As usual not everything went well on by ride.
I got suck once in deep snow and was wondering why.
Realised that the XT90s on the back ESCape box became lose a bit and the VESCs throttled down the power output.
The problem caused the very tight cable length and that I fixed the cable on the bindings. I´ll probably just add a adapter xt90 which will give me like 5cm more length and everything should work than in future without issues.

Unforunatelly that was not the only fault...
Short after that I noticed some kind so scratch noice comming out of the front. Very quickly I realised that something with one of the motors went wrong, so I tried t come home as fast as possible.
At home one motor already didn´t moved at all anymore, so I took the motor appart and found one borke magnet there....
As this was the last opportunity for me to drive this year I decided to take the second board and continue driving....
Eveything was fine for the first 15km... after that the same thing happened...
so in total I broke two magnet on two motors and both of my boards... 
That´s not how i expacted the year to end.
I can´t explain the broken magnets as they didn´t got hot etc.
but I now definitly know that it happend while i had bad contact with the road and the wheels where spinning up on a high rpm.

If somebody can explain me what could cause the broken magnets I would be very happy.

That´s already the 3rd bell from this motors with this issue.
I still worry a bit that this can happen one day when I drive on top speed... motor locks up and I, with bindings, locked to a 25kg board :rocket:

So what´s my plans now...
I´ll get two replacement bells for the broken two.
That will happen only in January, so till middle of February my quad is definitly out of work :roll_eyes:
I already started to battle harden the motors which still working.
That means I fill the empty space between the magnets and the bell with epoxy.
I hope that will give them more strengh and it was the last broken magent on this motors.
Honestly I would like to swap the motors to maytech or similar after that experience, 
but to swap out 6 motors is not really a cheap thing and than you also don´t know if it will maybe happen with the new once too.

Here one picture how I get my boards dry after a snow ride
![double|666x500](upload://DSIT1RbdFz9uwp0d1fYgrRhIJT.jpeg) 

And even if i hadn´t too much driving time, I tried to make some small videos ;)

-6 round about.
The glue looks perfect after I took off the bell.
The only thing I can imagine that there was too less glue.
There is a big difference in how magnets glued in on the 6374 compaired to the 6384.
I really didn’t expect the 6373 to get lose magnets.
I now added glue to all bells which where still working. Will need to update some pictures soon.
If now still something break I really don’t know anymore.

Would the snow freezing the glue have an effect? Hard to tell if you were just unlucky.

Use fancy high/low temp epoxy to put the pieces back in, replacement magnets not sure where to source em, it would be cool to have replacements.

I‘ll get new bells. APS has a very good customer service as far as i can say. But that will be only during January, than there is my vacation etc. So probably no ride till mid February 😔
 
I don’t believe that the coldness can have a big influence.
The motors are warm from home when I leave and they hold them self in a good 30-50degree range while riding.
It’s also not like I through them into ice water when they 100 degree hot or so. In this case i could understand that the glue would go off.

Although not necessarily that extreme of an example, thermal shock could be what caused it.  As they heat up the metal expands and as they go through snow/ ice water they try to retract  quickly, causing the brittle epoxy to break off

Like his crazy VESC (4.07?4.10? handled more than 125Amps ...), I know he also custom his motor to redious the kV to around 130, he maybe custom the bells too ..?

I haven't notice any difference (noize or anything) except the range when riding around 0°C lat year (but they're [Overion](https://www.overion.fr/) low kv custom motor with the closed bell, I know as Torqueboard he ask almost all component and composite custom and more control stage than the standard enclosed motor made by Maytech as we could find at many shops):

I read about this problem several times, but only on APS motors. It seems, that they had or have a problem with their glue or glueing process.
Jenso broke 4 APS motors within a few days. I tried to fix them: broke all magnets out, cleaned them, cleaned the bell and glued them back in. I tried this several times with different glues but had no luck. They always came loose again.

I hope you have better luck with yours, but you should maybe lower your motor amps until you get your replacement bells.

That’s I interesting to hear. Thx for your input, very much appreciate that.
I had a small talk with bruno from aps and he said that they had this issue before but solved it on newer motors by applying more or different glue. But he also said that that should have been on the motors I have.
However, I noticed a big difference in how the magnets on the 6374 motors glued in, compaired to the 6384. on the 6374 motors you can der that there is some epoxy or other glue even around the magnets. On the 84 motors that’s not the case.
I wonder why especially the APS motors have that. If you say you tried different glues it maybe could be the material they use on the bells.
Maybe the metal part expand faster or something like this and with it the epoxy get lose from the magnets or can’t hold the magnets anymore.

As my magnets already totally broken I can’t glue them back with loctite.

Buuut as we can see that didn’t do the job in my case.

Last update was that I broke some magnets in some of my motors.
That´s why I decided to "battle harden" the bells of all the still working motors. 
I´m very tired from this picture:
![IMG_7651|480x467](upload://jwxI47XdLvR0gwbfffy9pzjd5p4.jpeg) 
It´s already the third motor and this way is my last hope to get this motors work more reliable.
But what is battle harden?
Battle harden means to fill all gaps in the motor with epoxy.
this way the magnets are more strong fixed and should withstand even an impact. It´s mainly used for fight robotic stuff.
What do you need?
- Epoxy (maybe also some thickener for your epoxy)
- some wooden sticks
- heat shrink big enough to cover the motor shaft
- cups for mixing
- lots of papers
- gloves if you want

![IMG_7762|375x500](upload://olWOEoB6X1c5KtBxIxP46XMfHe4.jpeg) 

How it works?
If you too lazy to read through, watch this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MFjzSP5Oiw
In the description you will also find some product information.
As I sourced all my stuff locally I´ll not link anything.
The epoxy I use is a 4min epoxy used for motor and car stuff.
For me it has the perfect consistence. It´s fluent but still thick enough to don´t run away from the holes.

First you need to take appart the bell from the stator.
Than you want to remove the shaft.
As this might be not comfortable for most of us, you can just cover the shaft with heat schrink in the right size.
You really don´t want to get some epoxy on the motor shaft.
If you work on an old motor it makes sense to clean first the bell and make sure everything is dry before you continue to apply the epoxy.
Depending on how fast your epoxy is getting dry and how fluent it is, you will need to mix up more or less epoxy.
For me it worked best doing 3 lines than clean up everything, wait 3-4 min and continue with the next 3 lines.
If you mixed up the epoxy you fill the space between the magnets with it. Probably your magnets will be covered with some epoxy too. Use the wooden sticks to clean the magnets as good as possible.
Repeat this till all your magnets glued in and it looks like this or better ;) 
![IMG_7781|367x500](upload://6lKW7JZ4jkIkl4Qh6ojylQI5aFx.jpeg) 
![IMG_7780|411x500](upload://PtH7CVGhNvg4id0ILWSRDkQFQS.jpeg) 

It´s recommended to let the bells sit like this as min one day.
During this time I had a look at the stator too.
Here you could do the same with all windings.
It could probably help if you have a slightly lose winding or strange high pitch noice coming out of the motor at a specific speed.
I for my own deceided that it´s not really necessary.
One thing I didn't like on the motors, that the phase wires are pressed to the housing. In this place the windings also soldered to the flex awg cable. I have seen pictures of broken/cut isolation exactly in this place, that´s why I decided to cover this place with epoxy too and restrict the cable moving to like zero.
![IMG_7785|448x500](upload://4FPN0DXeoRLEHMkfwQGOOklQg4m.jpeg) 
If you do this too, take care that the phase wires are in the right angle coming out of the motor. If they stay up too much it´s not possible to mount your motor later :sweat_smile:
One more thing you could do in the same time, cover the sensors and pcb with some lack or epoxy too.
waterproofing your hall sensors can save you from a lot of troubles.

Ok, so it´s time to put everything together again.
Turn the bell with your hand and make sure nothing is rubbing.
if it is, some 500 sandpaper can help to get rid of this.

I also recommend to do a new motor detection after you assembled everything back, to make sure everything works how it should.

Happy riding!

For now I could test the battle harden motors only on the bench.
Still waiting for one replacement bell for the 6374 motors.
If all this was worth the work will be reviewed in one of the next updates here.

@Riako finally made it to write everything down ;)

I hope I didn´t forgot anything.
If you have a time I would be happy if you could post here 1-2 of your pictures. Your motors look way much batter made than mine.

Should have updated this... it’s already a pretty long time ago since I was driving last time.
I had to wait super long for the replacement bell and vacation and other things just didn’t gave me a lot of free time.
But let’s update some things I done on the board since the last time.
I removed all cans and battle harden them.
I also fixed the phase wires with epoxy on the place where they leave the motor.

On my last ride I had the issues that one of the xt90 plugs came lose. 
That could happen as the wires from the battery to the vesc box are pretty tight and fixed on the bindings. The movement of my foot caused the xt90 to get slightly lose which resulted in a power reduction of the back motors.
As i didn’t wanted to make new cables I made one xt90s extension plug. Easy peasy and problem should be solved with it.

* this place is left free for pictures when I can upload again 😅 *

I also cleaned the chains. They now shiny and smooth like new 😌

Over time one tire lost air. Seems to be a very small leakage as the tire hold a good pressure for about a week after filling it up.
Need to see how that goes when I drive more often. Luckily I have a spare inner tube on hand, just in case.

So, all in all the board is ready to go again.
Just need to find a time to take it out.

man great content! I will do it to the motor I am making. They are already disassembled so easy peasy. Whihc epoxy do you suggest for doing it? A high temperature one I guess.

I bought epoxy which used for motor parts in cars etc.
It’s local Russian production 😅 so i can’t tell you any European equivalent.
Just take care that it’s not too fluent.
It’s not nice to work with if it is.
Best consistency is like warm peanut butter 😜
Like this it’s flowing nice in the gaps and you can easy take away the epoxy which came on the magnets. 5min dry time is optimal.
3-4 gaps, clean up everything, wait 2min than go on with the next 3-4 gaps.

What about using an insert and a low viscosity epoxy and 'cast' the magnets and wires into solid blocks?  I imagine it has better grip and weight balance

I don’t exactly get what you mean with use an insert.
If you fill the gaps between the magnets you have the same amount of epoxy everywhere.
No way that the bell get out of balance.
If the epoxy is on top of the magnets you made something wrong and the motor will probably even don’t move anymore.
If you fill the stator with epoxy it doesn’t really matter either as the stator isn’t rotating.

Is it important to be not conducive epoxy? Ie epoxy for auto often has a metallic content

Are motor magnets and the bell conductive? 🤔
The epoxy I used isn’t conducive, but even if it would be I don’t think it would matter as the phase wires isolated.
In this case just don’t use it to cover the sensor pins and the pcb, but between the magnets it shouldn’t matter.

What say you to using this? potting compound, safe to 150c but viscosity is low meaning I think I will need to mix it with something else in order that is does not dribble

Data sheet looks good besides two facts.
1. it’s out of stock till May
2. it has a cure time of 24h at room temperature

Like this you can fill probably 3-4 gaps than you need to wait 1 day, than the other gaps.
I would look for epoxy with a cure time of 5-10min.

Thanks, the potting compound is good to have but your advice is sensible, the viscosity should be high otherwise filler like glassfibre beads is needed to thicken the mix. Waiting a day between turning the bell a few degrees to glue some more channels is not an option unless you are an ent.

I'll look again

I went through a few different ones and settled on this

Why?
There is no need to clean up anything.
Just don’t let the epoxy dry on top of the magnets and you good to go.
