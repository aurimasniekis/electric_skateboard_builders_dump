Do you guys know where i can get some CNC milling done at a cheap price. I have a motor mount i designed but need it cut out and was wondering if anyone on the forum could do it at a cheap price or if there is a service online that is cheap

Waterjet: https://www.bigbluesaw.com/
CNC (but more complicated process): http://www.mfg.com/

There are usually local places that can do it too, for example, there is a place here in NY called NYCNC, and sometimes there are users who (like myself) have CNC machines which can do it.

This is a problem a lot of people on here face. There's many sites online, but the prices are not cheap. This is why I bought my own cnc milling machine.

I tried to get enertions old motor mount (the one he posted his designs of) made from several places online, but they want over $150 per mount.

I wasn't really, because onloop released them to show everyone how expensive they were to be made cause a lot of people complained about how expensive they were. If you can find one locally, you might be able to get a decent price. Ether way, expect it to cost more than buying one from enertion or diyboards.

Yeah so the difficult part about mounts like these is that you can't make them on a traditional CNC machine easily... This is because of the holes on the side. It also cannot be waterjet cut because of the same reason, AND the beveled edges. It looks very similar to the universal motor mount that alien drive systems sells.

That's pretty complex - you're looking at a thousand dollars of machining there.

If you can redesign it to be 2 or 2.5D it would be a lot easier and anyone here with a CNC could do it for you.

If you whole heartily wanted to get them made like that, you might have to suck up and take the price. From a cnc milling point, this design is extremely complicated.

Personally, I really like the design. But I can say as a cnc miller, those won't e easy to make.

Well what @michaeld33  said, if you can make it into a 2d design, any cnc milling machine could easily cut it.

you have screw holes in multiple directions. If you could make all the screw holes in the same direction of the motor mounting holes, you could have a 2d model instead which would be pretty easy to cut and drastically lower your costs.

Note that the 2 aluminum pieces only have to be CNC'd on one axis.  Then the two holes that attach the Delrin have to be drilled and tapped manually.

Much... It would be better if you didn't have the slanted edge since they can charge extra for that stuff. Instead, you could have it like @DougM and make it another piece that bolts on, just the like the carbon fiber part of the Enertion mount. Also, the holes on the side will be a problem, it would be better to just hand drill those in when it's done, then it can be done on a regular CNC machine.

@raf - how will you tension the belt?  Most at least elongate the motor mount holes to help tension the belt.  Or an adjustment in between the motor mount and the truck clamp.

well if you split it up into two parts like the Enertion mount it can be made in 2d instead of 2.5, some places charge extra for 2.5.

yes but you should change it in the design to be non threaded, because the calculation tool will have issues with the threads, side holes, the slant, etc.

Simon from Big Blue Saw here.

If you're having trouble converting your design from the fully milled piece into something that can be done on the waterjet,  you might want to check  out our guide on designing for waterjet. It shows various techniques for getting around the limitations of waterjet cutting, like the stacking technique, t-nut slots, and more:
http://www.bigbluesaw.com/articles-list/big-blue-saw-designing-for-waterjet.html

You may be able to get around having to side drill by using nutstrip:

1. Remove motor mount holes that you are NOT going to use
2. The slot channel has thin surrounding stock, prone to higher fail rates in machining.
3. Remove the curved ramp. This requires ball end raster machining ( a lot of time because of small step over)
4. What are your tolerances? I had one guy spec +/- 0.005 mm on high aspect ratio walls, Ridiculous tolerances can add cost.
5. Some of your inside radii, especially at the motor plate, are really small. This requires tool changes, cost.

Your updated design is much better!

Basically it's to difficult to adjust belt tension and tighten the screws because they are hard to reach. And it's a safety issue if tension is lost because motor will hit truck. So I want a motor mount plate that is compatible with TB mount but let's me adjust tension using motor screws. I also want to change dimensions a little. Let me know if someone can help me get 2-3 made. I can ship motor mount so you can get accurate measurements.

It would help if you label your parts, especially if a machinist is looking at your drawing. 

ORIGINAL - PART 1 - PART TWO
ORIGINAL - PART 1 [top view] - PART 1 [bottom view].

Material specification: 

* 6061-t6 aluminum alloy
* 7075 aluminum alloy
* P-20 steel
* Titanium Ti-6Al-4V (Grade 5), Annealed

Tolerances, surface finish, surface treatments, etc. just enough to get exactly what you want, because whatever you leave out will be at the discretion of whoever makes the part for you.

I do CNC work for a laboratory. Our machine has a small working area, roughly 100 mm square, although it can be stretched to 140 mm in the X direction. I try to keep the spindle turning above our usual 200 hours/year.

If I can "see" the part right away, has a run time of less than two hours, and is not a headache to set up, then it just might be something I would put in the machine.

I got three jobs in the queue. One will take 20+ hours, while the other two should be quick.
