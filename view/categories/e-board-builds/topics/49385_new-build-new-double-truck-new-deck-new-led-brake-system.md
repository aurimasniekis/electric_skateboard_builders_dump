The electric board to be built this time will be made slowly with time.

So far, I have made seven boards for four years. More than 40 people have made it for me to make an electric board.

I have made so many, but electric boards are fun. If you pursue only high speed, thrill goes up but it is not fun.

Early on, I used a Paris truck or a Caliber truck. Now it is like a double truck Gillwing truck like Evolve. To add more fun to ride.

First, I asked people to make a wide deck of the desired shape.

The bamboo deck is the deck of the board that now rides.

 He sent a photo of the making.

I put in the concave moderately.

I made long hanger using extended parts of the gullwing truck to fit the wide deck.
And we are also sketching a robust power train for that.

If I see this right you put a sleeve over the existing axle. Have you done any stress analysis to see whether it holds up?

One of the Korean builders made this. Many users are currently using it. It is not broken yet.

Fair enough how do you prevent it from rotating such that the motor mount stays where it should? Looks like as if there is just one grub screw?

If you think carefully, the answer is. The axle tabs of both trains are not different reverse taps. We will make a plate that holds two motor plates. Then everything is resolved.

Maybe they are threaded?  I think they might screw on until they meet the hanger.  Surf Rodz used to make something like this.

As the the extensions both screw in opposite directions relative to each other, when the motor braces are in place, if one unscrews the other tightens, but the hanger would stop this from happening.  That’s the idea, I guess.

Yeah I guess you are right, seems like he uses threaded axle stub sleeves.

The deck was commissioned by the manufacturer!

I used Fvt120a ESC on my electric board.
The reason for using the Fvt120a ESC is that it is cheap and does not emit high frequency noise from the motor when it is stopped like a VESC.
It is loud with cooling fan sound and is not as flat as VESC.

Simplify wiring and integrate redundant circuits.

Capacitors were added.
The upper JST has 12 voltage when 3 channel signal. The lower JST is for the voltmeter of the main battery. 6 cell voltage is coming out.

Cool man, I find all these brilliant, congrats.

Just a question, are you making yourself those hangers to extend the Gullwing trucks? I'm thinking this might be a solution to adapt any truck to any motor mount making it slightly wider.

For example, for those living in EU where is hard to import TB 218mm trucks, if we put these things you make on Caliber ones, they will become wider to host bigger motors. There woulbe be also no need to get several trucks as you could play with the Calibers in different width.

Am I wrong? :smile: :smile:

One of the riders working together made it. In Korea, we still use calibers and evolve trucks rather than TB trucks.

Nice, may I import that idea to Spain? :smiley:

So I guess you made yourself those adapters/extenders. Any CAD file or something? Could they be made with just a lathe? My neighbour has a big one and could make them at very low price, I can distrbute it around Europe for the members with no profit. Thanks!

I know it was made of lathe. This is a simple idea. There are no exact dimensions. It is free to see and produce. All eSk8 builders do so and so develop. :grinning:

@LunarKim I really like your underboard lights, what do you use to power all the leds? I currently use an LM2596HV, but when considering both led strips + front lights + brake I easily go over the 3A current limit

Thank you. I'm using two step-down circuits. The brake LED is powered by the receiver. The step-down circuit 1 is for headlights and the other is for under-LEDs. All power is generated from the main battery.
