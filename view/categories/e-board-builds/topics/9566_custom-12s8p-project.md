Im planing to start building my custom 2, 12s9p battery packs from laptop baterries for my new electric longboard.[since i already spent about $850 in the motors and the vescs.(real vescs, I trust chinese motors but not vescs)]
I im planing to use 4 of this hub motors, https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/3000W-High-Torque-Hub-Motor-with_60469283762.html
I know what you might think, they are Chinese , they are gonna fail and burn down your board.
I bought one of these and tried it with a 12s and it seems to work perfectly.

Im planing to buy this:

I'll update regularly with photos. Feel free to comment or criticize.

don't cheap out on the soldering iron, especially if you've spent so much on everything else and plan to solder the cells together. Invest in a nice 85w soldering station like a Weller or Hakko.

start with half of that battery, then ride till its empty and reconsider! :sweat_smile:

12S9P could be 1360Wh, which, with conservative throttle @ single motor is 136km range!

i dont know i'll probably do a 12s4p for each motor, i rather have dual drive than  single drive..

I like higher millage because i wont stress the batteries so much and lower the voltage that much. My brother just bought the yuneec ego 2 and i broke it by leaving it dead for two days. so thats why im doing 2 builds :smile:

i think 5-6p would be enough for both motors 9p is a bit overkill

I am also doing a 12S8P because of the laptop batteries. This battery is even flexible and also each battery is swoppable at any time. Fingers crossed that it works. If not then at least I did learn something. 
And if it doesn't work i can buy new 3500mAh batteries and build a 28Ah (1243 Wh) Monster. Would be maybe the first 100 km+ range build.

No soldering anymore. After more than 400 spots. The Pack is connected and the only wires which are missing are the main - and + wire. And the others need to be shortened to the perfect length. So still more work to do.

So it is also is very flexible.

Might need a drop of hot glue or silicone to keep the batteries retained but I think the sled's are a great idea.

sleds are a good option if you dont want have a spot welder i suppose but arent the most elegant way to go.

Plus what about those little tabs, surely they cant handle too many amps

Each Pack is connected by 2 x 12AWG wire. The main wire will be a single 12 AWG wire so it should be more than enough. And the main goal was not to avoid the soldering, because spot welding would be much faster than this build, My intention was to have a pack where i can replace each battery in a couple of seconds at any time. Because i want to use recycled laptop batteries.And they are not in the best condition so they will not last 500 cycles.

I looked at the battery and thought about the same exact thing. 

I have also soldered a nickel strip to a battery tab, assembled the pack and went for a test cruise and that was the last time I used solder for battery packs. After this I built my own DIY car battery dual pulse spot welder and then bought nickel strip from ebay. Satisfied with the results, although I'm going for a thicker strip in the future. Strip I currently use was sold as .10 mm.

And why was it the last time. What happend? :anguished:

this is how the packs are connected. As you can see my soldering skills are quite poor. I am learning.:disappointed:

Wow pretty cool.

I think it's worth having a velcro strap on each 8P pack to retain them in the sled

I think i will use zip ties. Cost are irgnorable, reliable and cut them to replace a battery and add a new one. The biggest problem i have to find out is if the laptop batteries are working. Because their C rating is very low. Hope that i can make a testrun at the weekend if i find the time to solder the last parts. Sadly my Vedder anti spark switch is not here yet. So i maybe go with a xt90 anti spark.

I couldn't wait for my vedder switch so i went for the anti spark XT90.
And it is working :laughing::sweat_smile::grin:
Went for a testride with my worst 48 laptop cells (12S4P) and reduced the battery amps so that i only use half the power i would use later on with the 12S8P (96 cells) and it worked really well.
After around 4 km the cells got a bit warm but far away from hot. I guess around 30 or 35 degrees. And i wasn't carefull with the thottle. And as i sayed this was only half the cells i use later on. So i am very confident that this setup will be reliable.
With the cells i am using it should be good for **80km**.
I made 2 testruns and the first one with only one motor, And what was strange to me is that with one i could feel a lot of torgue steering. On my other board which is single drive i can't feel that. But it doesn't really matter because this here is a dual.
Maybe the difference are the trucks, The single drive has paris tucks and this one caliber 2. Brushings feel pretty much the same.

@Ackmaniac it 's cool seeing your laptop battery job! I was really wondering before where did you place all of these batteries but it looks like there is even space for some more..
Have you tried to check how much amps these laptop cells can give?

It looks like you have got quite similar cells (the red ones) do you know what / make model are these and what is their typical capacity?

Anyways.. nice seeing a laptop battery build and proving it is possible.. especially with the remarkable range these cells might offer ;)

These are a mix of half 2600mah (good) and 2200mah (bad) cells. Mainly from lenovo thinkpad packs.
I think they are rated to 1C and can stand officially 2C for a bit longer (like 30 seconds).
But i drive them far beyond these ratings. In max i draw around 80 amps from the battery. 
This is 10 amps a cell, so 4C. But then the Voltage sags from 50V to 32V. So i get like 2500 watts in max. They get a bit more than handwarm during a 20km hard ride, so i guess like 40°C or 45°C.
The range is between 60 and 70 km.
If i would arrange the vescs sideways then it should be possible to go even 14S. And if i would use hub motors i would gain more space and could go for 16S. But that's not usable for a longboard becasue it is already quite heavy. The board weights in total 12,5kg. Still ok but it should not be heavier. 
But who knows, maybe the VESC can handle 16S in the future.

Another benefit is that the battery is flexible this way. Now i need some ideas for a flexible enclosure for my next build with 12S4P and propper cells.

These are from broken laptop batteries. So I take what I can get. And they changed their battery type each year as it seems. Have many different ones. But the 2600 mAh ones seem to be OK.

I just finish soldering all the 18650 holders, i used 18 awg wire to solder  the holders together. I hope there is not a lot of voltage drope since its just 2in long every conection.(im planing to change this in the future, also adding a BMS)Props to @Ackmaniac for the idea, check out his build :wink:
well i got to go do the other board now :sleepy:

So each sled (4 batteries) is connected by one 18awg wire. That might be a bit to thin. I recommend to add a second wire at least. Have a look in the Internet for a awg table to see how much amps each wire type can transport. I connected each sled by two 12awg.
I saw in a YouTube video that they placed metal stripes behind the battery holders. I will try that for the next build. Maybe this way it will be very easy to build a proper battery pack. And if you would pre-solder wires to the stripes then it would be flexible as well.

I'll probably change it to 10awg after, im just goin to try it like this and if it gets hot ill change it.
Im not really worried abou that.Im a bit worried about the Vesc tho they dont have the canbus connector.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/c/bc64b14889a4c1e0fc2b49ced9bfa25429ec753d.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I rode it to class, I was hoping they didn't stop me and think it was a bomb or something.
I have to play with the BLDC tool, because we i was comming to class, my board just got Locked up for aseo and send me flying(sincerely I was just worried about the board been crushed by a car)
