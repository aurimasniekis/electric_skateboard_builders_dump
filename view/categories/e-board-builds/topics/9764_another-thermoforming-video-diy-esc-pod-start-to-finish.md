I keep making improvements to my eskate as I make things more permanent.  The next project was making a pod to house the VESC, receiver and anit spark.  Hopefully this helps others get ideas for making parts on their boards.

I got this one.  http://www.usbfirewire.com/parts/rr-114210-07-xx.html

The cap comes separate and I ordered the spanner nut to take up less space.
