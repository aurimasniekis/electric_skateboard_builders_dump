Hi guys, just wanted to share my solution for an electronics enclosure for your electric longboards...

Basically I bought an ABS enclosure from ebay for next to nothing - Â£9.99, but to get the right length & width I had to go with a depth of 60mm. So originally I'd wanted to just screw it to the underside of the board and screw on the lid, but because it was so deep, and I only needed it to be 35mm, i just run it through my band saw and cut the bottom off!
Then I cut away some of the screw columns to enable me to easily screw it to the board without using brackets, and still keep the same screw holes for the lid.

I really would like to make a custom shaped enclosure, maybe vacuum formed, but I don't have those facilities yet.

Hope this helps someone...
