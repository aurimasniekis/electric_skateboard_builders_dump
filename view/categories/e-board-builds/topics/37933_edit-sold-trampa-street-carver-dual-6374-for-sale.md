fair price, even just for parts. 

didn't we though determine that @Eboosted's fire was caused by the exposed wires along the enclosure segments?

either way, im sure itll be easy to find a buyer. I'd pick this up but...no space for it.

All balance wires are now wrapped in foam. No exposed wires anywhere. And batteries are 3M tapes to the bottom of the enclosure so absolutely no shifting is possible. Itâ€™s well sorted :)

Thanks for the kind words. Not to figure out the best wa to ship this thing haha.

No, we didn't. I'm still unsure on what was the main cause of the fire, but from the location of the ignition of the fire, the battery connecting were not the culprit, at least not the main cause.

The main possibility was a disconnection of a bullet connector in the splitter for the power of FocBoxes, that could be causing consecutive big sparks that ignited the flamable foam I use to protect the electronics from vibration.

Once the fire was ignited the heat could easily have melted the cells isolation rings causing a short between the positive and negative leads of each individual pack.

I making a point here as I would like people to think wrongly that the main cause were the wires.

So if you want an advice, don't use bullet connectors, use XT60 or XT90 instead (they are protected even on dsconnections, if they unplug for any reason you won't have a bare naked cable tangling around electronics and battery leads as the male bullet.

Another advice, don't use this neoprene rubber sponge to avoid vibrations:

I use it on my Trampa and while it worked amazing they are flammable.

Here is a small test I did:

Very interesting @Eboosted. All my banana plugs are heatshrinked. 

I also took a screwdriver to expand the male end prongs for a crazy tight fit! 

Nice experiments!!!!

@pshaw yeah, but on my enclosure I had a Y splitter made out of bullet connectors for both VESCs and all they were heat wrapped, however if one got disconnected the male bullet woul be bare nude, so heat wrap is not useful in this case, do not trust bullet connectors, go XT60 instead.

If one plug got disconnected and and touched the connection back again a giant spark powered by 2 VESC dual capacitors would definitely start a fire, even more when the rubber sponge was used on the electronics compartment.

So I think this was the main cause of the fire.

Good to know! Iâ€™m talking about heat shrink over the entire connections that are already heat shrinked. Locking them together.

Not sure as I only ever ran street wheels. Fastest I ever cared to go was 35mph. Farthest Iâ€™ve gone was 20miles in a single charge but battery wasnâ€™t completely depleted and I was booking it. I needed to get off after that long lol.

Wow that was fast!

What are you planing to build now? 

With your knowledge I'd start building a flying board propelled by 4 quads, I'd sell my car in order to invest on this vehicle. Hope this technology is developed soon, before saying: I'm too old for this sh!t

May I ask what the total cost of this build was? I'm planning on doing a custom build next (all I really want is a custom Trampa that can do 35 mph plus, or 20 miles per charge going a decent speed.) I just don't know if I have the time to learn everything and build it. I would rather just buy one off somebody next, like Kaly for example. But no idea how long it would take. I would have bought this the day you posted it, I just got a new job last month though and couldn't afford it unfortunately lol. 


Thanks!

Thanks man!
