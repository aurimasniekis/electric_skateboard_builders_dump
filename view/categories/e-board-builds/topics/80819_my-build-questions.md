Hey guys, not sure what I want to buy because this is my first build. I have some options and questions here that I wanted some input on. 

GOAL:
25-30 MPH
15 ish Mile Range

**Motors:**

ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD MOTOR 6355 190KV

collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv

OR

ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD MOTOR 6374 190KV

collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv

    


**Wheels, pulleys, trucks, etc.:**

DUAL MOTOR MECHANICAL KIT

collections/dual-motor-mechanical-kit/products/dual-motor-mechanical-kit#


Upgrade to 218mm trucks? (Advantages?)

Upgrade to 15mm belt? (Only works with 6374?)

83mm, 90mm, or 97mm wheels?

  


**Controller:**

TORQUEBOARDS 2.4GHZ NANO REMOTE CONTROLLER

collections/remote-controller/products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller

Cheeper options?

   



**ESC:**

NEW: FOCBOX UNITY ESC

im assuming you're wanting to go dual motor? If you want narrow trucks, go with dual 6355. If you want more power and want to use 6374's, you'll need wider trucks. Also, imo that remote is a piece of crap. it doesn't have very much travel so it's very touchy. And use whichever wheels you want, just remember that smaller = more torque and larger = higher top speed. of course your gearing will affect this too. And the Torqueboards torque esc is a lil cheaper than the focbox unity if you wanna save a buck

Great choices.  All goes together perfectly.  218 trucks if you want the 6374 motors.  15mm belts all day long.  97mm wheels because you won't chalk on every little stone and drop the nano remote. Try a benchwheel or a maytech over that option. Everything else is spot on.

yep you'll need 2 esc's. pretty sure it's still cheaper than a unity

$251.26 vs $85 x 2= 170
I guess but its not as advanced, can't connect with your phone, and doesn't have a switch/ button with it

switches can be found for less than 80 bucks. a unity also doesn't ship right away, u would be waiting for a couple months i think.

false. you can use either an hm10 module and connect it to the master uart port, or use metr module.

I just built my first board and wanted to add my 2 cents.  I'm 85 kg and easily got up to 27 mph with a SINGLE 6374, (later added a secind 6374 for fun) dual 6355 would be a great bet if you wanted to save some money there because dual 6374 is more than youll likely need.  I have 2 focbox, they're great, a single unity is likely even better.  Learn how you want to set up the vescs, there's a lot of options and they all have pros/cons.  Mine are set up as master/slave which means only one is recieving RC signal and then baziclaly commands the slave vesc to copy whatever the in our was.  Ackmaniac app is a great way to control your vescs wirh your phone, build kit boards sells a Bluetooth module that fits nicely into the 6 pin input on a focbox.  If you go this route make sure whatever vesc you buy has the right connection for the Bluetooth module.  Build kit boards is my go to for most things because Jared is awesome and has great service, I have his 11s3p battery, 2 6374 motors, and his tayto 31" deck, among other things.  Torqeboards is where I got my trucks and belts/gears (16t/40t 15mm kit).  Don't buy cheap on your mahor components, learned the hard way you need quality or else you'll be spending more money.  
Enjoy your build!

27 mph with a SINGLE 6374
[/quote]

one motor vs two motors: one motor and two motors will have basiclly the same top speed. two motors have **more torque**, not more speed. plus top speed is mostly dependent on the **battery**, not the motor.

That is correct, i wasn't speaking of my top speed tho, shouldve been more specific.  I hit 27 with more a good amount more throttle to go, going uphill.  I had torque in mind which is why I mentioned my weight*

```
top speed is more dependent on the kV rating of the motor, volts applied, and wheel size

thats based off of 97mm wheels and 16/36 on 12s i believe.
