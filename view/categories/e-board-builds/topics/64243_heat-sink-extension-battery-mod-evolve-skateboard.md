I started this little project to solve the overheating issues on the Evolve skateboard.
Those issues come from a long duration uphill ride or a combination of that and a 200KV motor.

I also modeled a heatsink extension for those who want to upgrade to a larger battery.

Here is my progress so far. This will be made out of a CNC aluminum.
