motor kv is too high, you'll want 200kv or less. The space cell battery enclosure is pretty sleek and thin, I use 2 of them.

I guess you say 260kv dual motors would draw too much current for this 10s4p battery, so I'd need a 12s at least? 

There's a 190kv motor available, if I use 10s4p with 2500mAh each cell, would that be a good setup?

It's not that it'll draw too much current, you'll toast your VESC by breaching the eRPM limit. 60k is the limit for the VESC.

190kv on 10s is the gold standard for belt drives imo, so you'll be good with that.

Thanks for your help, but I'm really eager to know why run a 190kv dual motor instead of a 245kv. If I'm looking for a higher torque and speed? 

If I use the Enertion Space 4 battery case, it should go up to 80A as it's a 10s4p setup and the VESC-X does support 80A.

You can do whatever KV you want, you will just fry your VESC. Simple as that.
If yo want 245kv at 10s/12s, just don't use VESC.
@Jinra just wanted to protect you from a 400$ "OH F***, I fried it" learning process. 

VESC fries over 60k ERPM.

this is going to depend on your gearing the most. unless you use a kv that high then you will zero torque... :grin:

Thanks guys! I'm starting to get it. However the cost is starting to sore.

I saw the Enertion R-SPEC 190kv 6372 motors but they cost $ 220 each, so $ 440 for just the motors plus the rest of the parts went above my budget. 

Would there be a lot of difference between the R-SPECs and the Turnigy SK3 6374 192kv? those are 
$ 79.96 each

Everytime I start to research I end with more questions than when I started:

- I couldn't find a slim enclosure for the battery pack, are there any low profile enclosures available for it?
- Do I need 2 VESC?, One for each motor?
- The Turnigy SK3 6374 192kv has 2750W the DIYER 6374 190kv has 3150W, would there be a lot of difference in performance?
- The battery pack I selected would force me to get a stiff deck, however I like the feeling of the bamboo, are there any 10S4P flexible battery packs with enclosures?

I'm using a single 6374, along with a lot of other people. I think two of those is more than enough.. don't really need the 6355's. 

> I'd like to turn the board on/off from the remote, maybe to turn it on as soon as the remote is turned on and visceversa.

Turning the board off with the remote could be possible, but probably requires some programming. If you want to turn in on with the remote you will need constant power on the ESC otherwise it cannot receive the 'turn on' signal. So that will be difficult to accomplish, unless you install another receiver that is connected to a power switch..

Well ever since I've been an owner of a Bamboo GT, I've felt like extra wide trucks are the standard for an e-board considering the speeds you often reach. It just feels right to have a more stable, wider wheelbase.

So anyway, I've messaged Dexter at Torqueboards occasionally over the past few months and he's often mentioned Caliber-style 220mm trucks among other things he's working on.
This is what he commented on here on October 26:
"I'm actually working on 220mm Caliber Style Trucks. Hopefully, in a 1-1.5 months they should be available."

Of course he's been very busy lately, but it's probably safe to say it's on the horizon right now. It probably won't hurt to use regular 180mm trucks right now and then swap later if the 220mm trucks interest you.
I'm just patient and content with my Bamboo GT until the market and innovations I'm waiting for can catch up. I want to use dual 15mm belts which the space of the wider trucks can help accommodate. I was also considering a dual rear 6374 setup before since the 220mm trucks can fit it, but that just seemed like overkill the more I thought about it.

We seem to have the same tastes for e-boards, as I also have a Bamboo GT and I'm building a Vanguard exactly as you, I'm pretty confident the build we are doing at the moment will outperform the Bamboo GT in all aspects. 

The 6355s in dial setup and 20S are no joke,  but I have yet to test them in real world, can't wait no more for my remaining parts to arrive

I know the Vanguard isn't meant to be a high speed board but I'd like to add as much stabilitity as I can in order to avoid speed woobles.

Haha yeah, it sounds like we're on the same boat. I had a Dual+ for about 8 months until I sold it in anticipation of the Bamboo GT. I really miss the feel of that board as much as I like certain aspects of the GT.

So I figure why not put them together taking good parts of each board? The only thing I really wish was possible was being able to use the Boosted remote. Even after months with the Evolve remote, I still hate it and miss the Boosted remote and being able to have a deadman switch+thumb control. Also, I'm pretty sure I'll be waiting for the VESC 6 for my build/the VESC 6 will be out by the time I really begin. I just hope it isn't too much more expensive than the VESC 4.12.

On the Loaded website it does have the Vanguard listed at being able to take speeds up to 25mph. I honestly don't think I would want to go past that though, just in general and especially not on a Vanguard. If I want a 30+mph board I think I would just make a separate, dedicated board with a stiff deck built around the objective of going fast. The vanguard board will just be a great daily driver capped at 25mph to me.

I'm having some issues with the motor cables placement, they are too long and would need a weird torsion in order to be connected with the bullet connectors from the VESC.

[img]http://i.imgur.com/zT7K5rU.jpg[/img]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/npUC07p.jpg[/img]

Just some pointers for anyone tring to build a similar board:

1. The Caliber II 44's have thicker hunger than the 50's, maybe they have more paint thickness but you need to use a hammer to mount the clamps on, for the 50's they go in loosely.

2. You will need 265mm belts instead of the 255mm one, they will leave more room to avoid the cables from touching the truck clamp.

3. If you use Torque Board V4 motor mounts and a Calibers II 44's you will need a 1/4" raisers, otherwise the motor mount itself will hit the board on full turns

4. The Boosted Board style VESC enclosure from Thingiverse will fit two VESC but you will need to cut the transparent heat wrap a bit and bend the power cables, off the shelf 2 VESCs won't fit this enclosure.

You can just orientate the motors differently so the wires are facing the trucks. Then you can curve them back (this is actually the recommended setup). Let me know if u have any other issues or quirks that need worked out.

I tried to do that but the cables would hit the clamps pretty bad, even the motors will not spin freely if I force the belt in, in order to do that I'll need a longer belt that the 255mm one, maybe a 265mm

What riser pad thickness have you used?

So you just made holes on the riser pad, wired them to the top and them connected them to the VESCs by the top through the deck? that's smart!, I might give that setup a try. But I'll deffinitely have to keep the exit orientation of the wires as shown in the first picture, no other orientation would give me enough clerance and freedom of movement.

Thanks a lot for the idea!

I made/invented a custom riser pad milled out of a bloc of ABS UV; this makes the building way more sleek and provides more flexibility when inverting the motor cables or just classic maintenance. You just don't need to mill the deck anymore. It's a part composed of two riser pads (front rear). I made a logo one and a blank one

thanks mate, everything I worked on for this one man army brand was built from scratch/blank paper and produced in a limited amount of quantity. The full end to end story has been achieved in like 6 months with many iterations and hard riding, including the man made deck with fiberglass sheets to the motors mounts. What a journey!

I will check the postage on this to your door; for the blank one and come back to you. The logotyped/ printed ones are a bit more expensive but it includes a front riser (which is no excuses!) but they are very limited quantity edition and it costs a lot to produce. The riser is milled also below to enable the wires to move freely while still providing strong support. I think the blank one will do fine ! 

happy building!

I wonder if it'll be possible to reorient the motor wires buy desoldering internally and make them exit on a 45 degree angle, that'll give me a lot of room to keep using the 255mm belt and do the riser trick

I think @whitepony did it sometime in the past:

I would leave it as normal. you need to avoid removing flexibility on the wires, as it must move freely and flex between the motor can and the riser; the motor cables/wires must be able to bend easily. Look :slight_smile:

Sorry if it's obvious for everyone else, but how do the risers work? I see the three bullet connectors that get plugged into the three ports on each side of the riser, but where does the wiring go after that? Underneath the riser? Through into a channel in the top if the deck @longhairedboy style? So confused! :confused:

hey @jackw - it's straightforward but your question worth. @longhairedboy solution is awesome and also bring lots of style  to his beautiful handcrafted decks has it make the visibility of the channel on the top of the deck. On my side, I went the other way as I don't want to mill decks and I'm lazy to have all this wires going everywhere so I researched a clean way to make it easy to maintain and have this sleek look to it.

you just pre-wire the motors wire bullet connectors in "L" shape and push them below the riser on each hole. The riser is hollow in some parts which make this possible.

I got a bunch ready to ship if anyone wants to give them a try and support !

Does anybody make a belt cover that would be screwed onto the motor mount over the motor pulley? Something similar to what Boosted or Evolve uses over the pulley?
It wouldn't be too complicated of a part at all, literally just a plastic piece that screws into a hole on the motor mount.

Also, I'm loving the build and the tips. Will make my vanguard build a lot easier with the help. Looking forward to seeing it completed!

Hey man. Still trying to figure out how the fit was so wrong on the enclosure. I printed a paper template of the file at 1:1 scale and it fits the curves of my Vangaurd just right! Can you send me real life measurements of the print in the places it doesn't fit? (Width and height etc) and I'll check it against mine. Which flex do you have just to check too.

Of course, I'll do that today. 

The battery pack has wires runing on the sides that add some thickness to the pack itself too, being such an exact fitment it decreases the chances of a perfect fit. The printer I used did the enclosure in 4 parts, maybe if you do find a bigger printer it'll fit better than mine

Hey @jackw, I'm pretty sure it was the 3D printer job error, the printer was too small and he had to split it in 4 parts and glue them together at the end, he also used 4mm thickness for the job.

My Loaded Vanguard is flex 3 38" long.

I'll send you the measurements tomorrow but the side of the battery pack hits the inner part of the enclosure, the battery seems to be bigger than was @barajabali and I anticipated

The mounts for the CRonins were almost impossible manufacture as you can't adjust how in or out you can mount them, if you push them to the inside the mount hole would need to be wider.

After 3 months designing and fabricating the parts I finished the build today, really happy with the results, very different feeling than the fast/stable Reaper, this board is more a cruiser and comfortable board, easy on your feet but pretty fast as well.

Unfortunately, after the first test one of the motor mounts let the left motor down to the ground, so one of the @torqueboards motors got scratched, I'll work on the paint as soon as possible.

@tim_felbinger you just measure the width of the 12AWG wire and make a groove slightly thicker, use a Dremel tool but if you don't have it'll be easier and cheaper to ask a carpenter to make the groove with a router.

So I changed the motor mounts design, used the @torqueboards adjustable motors mounts and made simple clamps with two M8 studs on each clamp. 

Then I sent the CRonin trucks to the lathe to made a round section to fit the clamps and perforated two holes for the studs to avoid the clamps from spinning. 

Once everything was done and tested I paint them with gloss urethane paint.

Ive been there, on my last set of trucks actually.  I hated the gloss black I used, takes forever to set and really shows imperfections unless you multi-coat and sand.  I really liked the flat black, but it shows every speck of dirt and doesn't stand up well.  I settled on satin black or plasti-dip.  Both are kinda flat but clean up well and stand up well.

The board is runing amazing! I'm not sure if I went too far but this thing is a BEAST with these settings:

Motor max: 90A
Battery max: 40A
Motor min: - 60
Battery min: - 12.5A
Absolute max 130A

I think I dialed my perfect pulley set, motor 15T, hub 36T. Top speed is 45km/hr (28MPH). Mid range is insane.

Cause i was watching the video and listening to your motor go silent as in - you are coasting, and then you power back on.  I'm on Duty mode with no reverse with brake on and i have to keep on the trigger to keep moving.  I'm going to try that mode tonight.
do you push the trigger forward to brake.

I didn't update the BLDC tool so i don't have the Watt mode but it does have the Current mode which does give me the option to coast and you are so right, having the ability to coast was fun, I have to do a range test but i can fathom my range doubling.

[/quote]

What you mean here? You mean you need to keep on pulling the trigger to keep the speed? This is normally how it is supposed to work

Why you couldn't update the BLDC tool? Is pretty straight forward just download it from the Ackmaniac thread

Watt mode is much better, if you release the throttle and pull it back again you won't need to go all the way up on the trigger, trigger will adjust accordingly

First off: this build turned out awesome.

A few questions:
1) what is the layout of everything inside the battery enclosure?
2) did you print a buck and then vacuum form or did you just use a really strong print?
3) is this waterproof and/or water resistant in any way?
4) what sort of range do you get on this board
5) have you tried FOC mode yet? Will you?

I think that is all the questions I have for now. I am trying to do a very similar build so I've been studying this thread. (although only 10s2p)

Thanks!! :slight_smile:

1) Here is my battery wiring layout:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/Eh0jlOk.jpg[/img]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/2JPhDyK.jpg[/img]

2) I printed the enclosure but it wasn't strong enough, so I use the 3D print to make mold and made copies on high flex hard fiberglass

3) No waterproof, in Lima, where I live, it hardly rains. And if it does I'll be mad to go skating because of aquaplanning

4) I'm getting 40kms (25 miles on one single charge), my cutoff start is 30V and cutoff end 28V, I might get more if I go down to 27V and 25V, but I don't currentlt need it. The 95% of my rides use 25% of battery so I usually charge it at 75%, if I go somewhere very far I get home with 20% of battery left.

5) Yes I did, it's silky smooth, really an amazing feeling but as I'm runing Torqueboards VESC without upgraded capacitors, it cutted of at maximum torque, I felt very unsafe so I went back to BLDC and I'm confident all over again, the additional torque, speed and reliability of BLDC has no match, besides que sound of dual VESC sounds like an airplane turbine.

Yes, the cheapest one on ebay, I'm using the BMS only for charging.

I checked my cells for the first time after 3 months of daily hard abuse and long trips, here is the voltage of each pack:

1) 4.10v
2) 4.10v
3) 4.10v
4) 4.11v
5) 4.10v
6) 4.10v
7) 4.10v
8) 4.10v
9) 4.11v
10) 4.10v

Wether this BMS is working great, at least on charging, or I haven't had the need to balancethe cells so far.

Battery capacity tester was off by 0.3v
