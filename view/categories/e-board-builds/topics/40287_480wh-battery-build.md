Hey guys! 

I'm making a battery pack of 10pc 13Ah lipos (10s), and I'm looking for some opinions. Do you guys think this is a good size for an about 20km commute? 
It can do 65A continuesly, and I'm using an sk3 motor, that can take that current at 10s.
I have a full carbon 1m long board, that I made, with costum batterybox. Any feedback is welcome!

Yes, this setup will Get you far over 20 km. I would bet something like 35-40 km

Thanks! I have already tried it once, I just completed the build last week, but I didn't have time to use it for a longer time yet.

Nice batt pack. What sort of cells are these? Final pack looks very flat / slim :)

If following general rule of thumb, then 13ah - 10% = 11.7ah 'usable' capacity.

 Then that times 37v =  432,9 wh... then that might even get you a whopping *43km*.. (10wh / 1 km)

well a bit less, if u want to preserve battery more (max 80% capacity of pack discharged, instead of 90%)

U can use  http://calc.esk8.today for other data

Very nice build and very interesting. 
Are those Lipo packs 1s1p or multiple P?
Also if you could, please post a link for them.

@Namasaki looks like this cell in terms of brand and specs. Not a bad form factor either.  https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32810703096.html
