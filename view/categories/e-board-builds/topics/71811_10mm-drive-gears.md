I'm building a board and using motors that have 10mm shafts i need to find drive gears with 10mm bore.
Any suggestions where to buy such gears. also is it not possible to ream out 8mm gears to a 10mm bore?

Do you talk about spur gears or HTD pulleys?

You can drill out 8mm to 10mm but be careful, .1mm off and it's gonna wobble like a brick wagon. Better to just buy 10mm bore pulleys.
