Hi everyone !
I have been doing a lot of research and I finally matched some parts for my eboard. I want ask if everything is OK and please give me any suggestions that you have. Because I know something is not correct in that build. I'm still learning about it. My budget is about 400 - 450 $

I weigh 62 kg (136lbs)

Stay away from those remotes, remotes like that have a really bad rep, I had one and it cut off on me mid rid, I didnt fall and die but I had to push my board for a good 2 miles.
If youre on a budget I would say to try out the hobbyking motor mounts, they seem pretty sturdy and theyre really cheap at less than 10 bucks, I have 4 of them and I havent tried them out yet.
For the deck just get any deck you like really, for wheels get some flywheel clones since youre on a budget and dont forget about the pulleys

Ideally it should be a larger longboard

I have zippy flightmax 4s1p 8000mah 30c and they already sag a hell lot when drawing at a higher rate. Just be aware that you wont be able to climb crazy hills without your voltage indicator dropping by 40%.

Also if you're gonna build an 8S battery I'd suggest going with a 260kv motor:

Skateshred.com has great prices on decks, griptape and hardware. I went with this deck http://www.skateshred.com/index.php/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/wholesale-kicktail-longboard-232.html had to use 1/2" risers to work with 90mm wheels. Which they also sell but only in neon green.

Check out this place too http://www.customskateboards.com/Blank-Longboards. $25 for a deck ain't bad. I've been using one of their decks for a year and so far, so good.
