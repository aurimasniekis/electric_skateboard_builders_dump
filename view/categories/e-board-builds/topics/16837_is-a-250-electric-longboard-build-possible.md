Hey everyone.

Im pretty new to all of this electronic stuff and so i was just wondering do you think an electric longboard of a 250€ budget would be somewhat decent?

I have been searching for the parts i could afford whole week (going to post all parts later). Just want to see your opinion what do you think?

250e is probably not possible for a good build, maybe 350e

With brushed motors I believe you can :D I've seen one guy make his out of ~15 usd dollar ones..

But seriously.. it will probably take around 300eur minium.. depends on what you already have.. 

Battery ~50+ eur
Motor 50eur minimum, typically 80-90eur
Cheapest board with all wheels .. etc.. 50-70 eur?

You already get about 200 eur here.. not including speed controller, remote, wires.. the motor mount..

Search up some motor mounts.. if u can make your own, might also save some money

With 350 you should be okay. Always remember that lower than a certain price, you're giving up safety. And it's better to have debts than to be dead. You should buy everything from a group buy (ajaynagra plans a lot of them)  except for esc, take the FVT one, and for the batteries, buy a normal 6s lipo.
