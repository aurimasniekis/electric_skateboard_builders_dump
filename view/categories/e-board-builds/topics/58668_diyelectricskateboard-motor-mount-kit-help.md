Hi, i'm currently assembling their kit but i don't know what i'm doing wrong, the kit is the 15mm one with 15mm belt and 97mm wheels, i am using a spacer on the backside of the wheel and that clears the wheel from the motor pulley. 

but what i don't get is how to make so the set screws on the motor pulley wont hit the belt when it's spinning. am i doing something wrong?

I dont know the answer to this particular question but I have that kit on the way and I'll be using loctite 680 to secure the motor pulley as a few peolpe here are doing.

@Eboosted  swears by this. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-remove-motor-pullies-in-30-seconds/57694

Cut them down with dremel or find shorter ones so the head doesn’t protrude

It looks like you have the motor mount screws in the pulley set screw location.  Mine don't have heads like that.  I have the same kit.

Wow..  That is surprising.  You could also probably get away with just using a keyway (if one was included).  I had to shave mine down for them to fit.

@torqueboards Can you chime in?

It will most likely have a small amount of play, but it'll work.  I use both, and I've had the set screws come loose before.  The board still worked fine, but you could hear the pulley rattle a bit.  Not a big deal.  As far as slipping off the axle, your belt will prevent this if it tight.

@Hannes
to be clear though i have grub screws in the middle of the pulley and the rim.  When removing use a good quality allen wrench or they strip out.

I believe TorqueBoards recently changed to this version of motor pulley. I've received both versions from them. With the previous version the two screws didn't protrude. Shouldn't matter though as others have said if you use grub screws and locktite

careful pulling it off the shaft though its very easy to damage

It wouldn't hurt to grab one of these if you have issues
