I saw a photo where someone dyed them black with Rit dye but I don't know where that was or if it lasted or not.  You could probably have a tattoo artist change their color :-P

I saw some thread where people used different Dye, RIT and Idye Poly. iDye Poly seemed to get a better result on shorter times. Thread was on this forum so you should be able to find it with a search. I saw it the other day so pretty fresh replies :) 

Just got myself some RIT Dye the other day. Now I just need a big enough container to keep the wheels in..

Make sure you use polyester specific dye. I used all purpose with no results and the poly dye is still very black after over 100 miles  of riding. The poly dye only takes 45 minutes of soaking :) there are some pics on my build thread

is that the iDye Poly? the Rit I got says " RIT-Liquid Dye. Dye clothing and accessories rejuvenate old garments coordinate home decor hide laundry accidents and more. Pre-dissolved liquid is also great as a stain on unfinished wood and wicker or use to stencil or antique. Works on silk & dried floral nylon and plastic or even golf balls."
