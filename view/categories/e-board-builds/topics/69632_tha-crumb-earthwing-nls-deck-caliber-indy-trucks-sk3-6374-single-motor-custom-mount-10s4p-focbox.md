I have been interested in this for over 10 years now. I have wanted to build one but gave in and bought an Evolve GTX. I had some problems with it but it is running well now. I joined this community so that I can start building my own. I would like to contribute to the community wherever I can.

I am an electrician and hobby machinist. I have a lathe with a milling attachment, drill press and some other shop tools. 

I am going to start by building using a downhill setup I have. It is an Earthwing NLS with a Indy in the back and a Caliber 50 in the front. I would like to modify the Indy to accept the motor. Here are some pics of my progress. I don't really have a plan at this point. I need my motor and pulley dimensions. The rough idea is to turn a bearing shoulder for the pulley and then a section with a flat for the motor mount.

I will keep my progress updated. Thanks for any input or feedback.

I'd love to try some Indy trucks, haven't ridden any in years but used to as a kid. Loved them.

I like the indies on my shortboards. This longboard was my first. I started out with two caliber 50's, took a hill and crashed from the wobbles. I did some research and found that by using a less turny truck in the rear I could quench the wobbles.  Thats why I have the Indy in the back.  It works really well and it feels like cheating. Same idea as the evo decks. 

The lathe is a fun hobby. I will do small jobs for people on this forum sk8 related. I am in NE Ohio USA. 

So I am wondering if I can mod my old abec 11's with a pulley mount.  They are currently at 64mm. 

Whats the OD of a standard wheel pulley? 36t? So my evolve pulley is 32t and about 2" or 51mm.

I'm thinking I will go with 15mm belt, maybe 12 is ok. 6374 motor.

I will probably gear it to go about 25mph. I would like to pull full on WOT 0 to full speed from time to time. Moderate hills here. I'm 220lbs. Otherwise mostly cruising with occasional shredding.

I decided to turn down my wheel pulley register to 0.4" OD at a depth of 0.825". This matches my evolve axle. The aluminum over the axle may wear over time since it could be soft.  If it does then I can turn it off down to the steel axle. Then either use a standard skate bearing or machine a bushing adapter.

So I got down to some final dimensions and took some finish cuts. I ended up taking the wheel pulley bearing register down to .393" or almost 10mm. At that OD the Evolve bearing fits to a light hand press.
![IMG_2414|690x460](upload://sotnDQlAdQw0wxi9B5Rch1rzx0e.jpeg) 

I then turned down a section for the motor mount. I ended up stopping at a .75" OD which left a couple flats from the casting. I plan on either matching this on the motor mount or just boring a .75ish hole and tapping two set screws to meet those flats.

![IMG_2416|690x460](upload://zsvpvjgZYba4EkziPkKmde8rtpX.jpeg) 


Next up is the motor mount. I am planning on mounting the motor inward to retain use of the kick tail. What angle the mount should extend from the truck? I think parallel to the truck base plate. I want it as close to the bottom of the deck without it hitting on the tightest of turns.

I swapped the wheels... neither look correct. I see there could be some abec 11 76mm flywheels on a shelf collecting dust somewhere or maybe 83's.

Well I read the topic naming instructions....a bit late. I saw the Enertion FOCBOX on sale and picked one up for this build.

Made some progress on the motor mount. Started with a .3" plate of AL. Scribed some circles and lines as a guide
![IMG_2423|690x460](upload://80oXINBvKEUqenDQhuC7qSM9sQ8.jpeg) 

Made some saw cuts

![IMG_2504|690x460](upload://nX2S8E2CXNEKw45A26ZBNFtfN0h.jpeg) 

![IMG_2505|690x460](upload://rWRNYf6Mm6QmxEHrZzXlj5BJBvq.jpeg) 

To the belt sander
![IMG_2508|690x460](upload://3hQmRDqWtOVxVkz0FIoLluyE0G5.jpeg) 

Having trouble seeing my lines and close to rough size, scribed some final lines on layout fluid.
![IMG_2519|690x460](upload://iJpYpbItPIO9iNtBhPEq1oZI4se.jpeg) 

To the drill press for a .750 hole
![IMG_2522|333x500](upload://fKhJWPgGZrApHqcZCTRi07UAZLe.jpeg) 
![IMG_2526|690x460](upload://aKoYMrwXdNcfLDTes5nSLgRSkmD.jpeg) 

And it slides on with a little hand press.
![IMG_2531|690x460](upload://6RZ7UQ9X6C96H8FS4jotMstWrA7.jpeg) 

I'm going to have to figure out the angle here. I could have made it a bit longer, I actually shortened it .110 from my original sketch :roll_eyes:

I am concerned about clearance. I may just send it to the back. maybe add a wheely bar :smiling_imp:
![IMG_2537|690x460](upload://8piyAtLInyTq9PhTLwBulX4pPBi.jpeg) 

I think I am going to run 83mm flywheels. I love that abec 11 but I am seeing how low I can keep the budget.

Am I wasting my time with anything but abec 11? Any recommendations?

Next up I need to mill the slots for the motor bolts. Set the final angle, secure in place with setscrew, will probably weld in final position. Then on to the pulleys. I wonder if I could possibly make the pulley on my lathe with the help of a spin index mounted to the cross slide....

Quick update, I slapped on my daughters 75mm big zigs. Went for a ride trying forward and reverse mounts at various angles. 

![IMG_2538|690x460](upload://pZdkyBL8kWdleAwnRz7iZ8A8ni8.jpeg) 

Holy shrimp! Those big zigs are pure joy. Too bad I can't slap a pulley on those....

![IMG_2602|690x460](upload://u6TQGpdwgA9FsK8or47oaShJrhC.jpeg) 

I didn't really have any problems either way. I tested rolling up a rounded curb that my evolve will sometimes rub if I'm feeling extra heavy. The mount actually had more clearance in the forward position.

At this point I am going with forward position at this angle:

![IMG_2599|690x460](upload://hD1Wiv98mngWW251F4T0NHcqDFs.jpeg) 

So I'm going to narrow down the wheel diameter to either 76 or 83mm

How do kegels compare to flywheels? The pulley adapter seems easier to make....

So cool to see you using a Earthing DH deck! My roommate and I are huge advocates of Brain’s business. Those decks have amazing concave. I’m looking forward to seeing your board up and running so keep us posted. Also on wheels, if you’re ambitious you could try the 76mm abec flywheel in classic thane. I haven’t seen anyone use them because they force your drive system to be crazy low to the ground but I think you may like them because it seems like you want a more traditional board height and riding position. I just got some 83’s myself. Good luck with your project! @MD84

@GreasyGearsWRX Thank you for the motivation.... I love the Earthwing brand, such a great company. My first and all time favorite longboard deck.

I'm just going to go for it and run the 76mm wheels. They are hard to find but I think I found a good source. I think I should be ok with ground clearance....If not, they will be a sick wheel for a gravity board.

Here comes some more progress.....

The diagram helps me on the manual lathe, The two pieces will bolt together and a bearing will be shared between them to locate them concentric to each other

Can anyone tell me if a flywheel hub is straight through or is tapered? Not sure if I need to machine the portion that engages the hub on a taper or go in straight through. Also I am thinking the larger ID of the hub is about 1.56". Can anyone confirm?

Sorry I haven’t checked in here in a minute! That’s great! My roommate is about to transfer his build from a prism origin to a EW road killer!  My first esk8, which I’m still currently riding, is on a 2015 EW supermodel. I’ve ridden it going on 1500 miles in rain and dirt and sand and it’s still holding up great. No warp, no delamimation, even the finish is still holding up alright. It’s good shit! I don’t know where you’re located but if you ever find yourself towards Alabama we should ride! Always feel free to tag me or DM me if you need anything!

Other than good wire and regular xt60 or 90 connectors you should be okay. You’ll need a piece of malleable copper for your loop key but you can find that anywhere locally.

I’m very excited to see how the 76mm abecs work out!

@Grozniy Good point, I originally planned on slotting the holes. Then I decided to try to get it dead nuts for a 265mm belt. If it doesn't work out I will slot it. 

Or maybe a 270 or 275 with an idler...

Finally got some time to work on the flywheel adapter section of the wheel pulley. I got the 76mm flywheels in. This made it a lot easier to verify my final dimensions. I am happy with how it turned out so far.


I made my rough cuts and then faced off the pulley side

![IMG_2746|690x460](upload://78oHNCNoVTqcpB2JFpULyIVn5Tj.jpeg) 

I still need to drill and tap my bolt pattern to join the pieces together as well as cut the slots so it will mate to the flywheel. I am still deciding which method to use for the slots. I could mill them or cut them on the EDM. Either way I need a way to index the 120 degree rotations. I have a hex collet block I think will do the trick.

The bearing presses nicely and protrudes about 0.070" out of the adapter. This allows the pulley to index onto the bearing so that they ride concentric.

I put the flywheels on for a ride and I am glad I went with the 76mm. It is a great feel. We will see how it is with the electrics...

@Linny Thank you, I am really trying to make as much as I can manually, with the help of machine tools, CNC if I must. I am planning to gift this, so it will have more meaning IMO

I am starting to think a motor could be possible on a future build, but that is really hard to rationalize with how much work would go into it, and how cheap one can be purchased for.

Bolt circle and assembly. Will probably pick up some stainless hardware. Anyone know if stainless steel and aluminum play nice together?

Was going to try the cross slide table on the drill press but decided to go with the mill attachment on the lathe.

Decided to transfer the pulley bolt pattern to the adapter. Installing a bearing so the pieces will fit concentric.

@Jake2k17 Thanks, I am planning on soldering, I have a big 175W Iron. I just want to do it right. I'm looking at the cell level fusing and various methods and its a lot to take in. I am an electrician so I am no stranger to insulation, conductor sizes etc. I am just new to building a pack.  

I will check out the TB motor.  Is a bolt layout or any drawings available? 

I want my son to be able to ride with me. My evolve I've gone 25 miles with some left over. So I am looking for similar range. Im 220lbs and he is 80 :slight_smile:

I was thinking if I matched the 10s 10Ah battery I would be in good shape. I was planning 15:36 pulleys with 76mm wheels and the 192kv motor I think TB is 200kv

Torqueboards are some of the best motors you can get right now, and their customer service is pretty good so if something breaks that is not supposed to, they will most likely replace it.

I went ahead and purchased the sk3 motor and (20) 1s 5000mAH lipo's....

85$ for the motor and 150$ for the batteries. The batteries are only 1cm thick...

My next pack will probably be li-ion after I do a ton of research and testing on contruction methods. If I want to upgrade the lipos I will relegate them to replacing the lead acid batteries in the kids razor motorcycles.

I have a few more items to purchase and more fabrication. I need to make an enclosure.

I am going to look at a remote next. I think I am going for the bench wheel. Any other recommendations? I wouldn't be opposed to making one with an arduino or pi or whatever

Plus 1 on EB’s statement on Hoyt remotes. They’re legit otherwise my exertion remote has been great. Torqueboards remotes break really easily and the casings are super cheaply made. On motors I have nothing positive to say about torqueboards anymore. Seen too many people locally having trouble with their motors as well as my own experience. Magnet retainer rings come loose often which causes magnets to come un-adhered and motors to lock up. I had it happen to my first TB 6374 and then on the replacement they sent me. Then I bought one more and it’s starting to show signs of failure. My roommate had his retainer ring come loose from his motor that looks and is almost brand new. His build has been finished for just a couple weeks. TB would not cover it because the purchase date was a while back but there are several reputable memebers of this forum who are local to us and know for fact the motor was not run until very recently. I built a dual drive TB 6355 board for my father and one of the motors has a click that I cannot track down and one of them has a sensor board or wire that is bad. I’ve lost hope for those motors. Now, I cannot say that I’ve had better luck with any others but I can assure you I’ve had a bad fuckin time with TB lol. Don’t get me started on their vesc’s.. LOL. Bkb stuff seems to be pretty nice. I think that’s the direction I’m going next! Sorry for rant. I just feel as though people should know what they are getting into.

I cut these pieces of paper to match the footprint of the 20 batteries. I had them on my NLS and the superglider actually has more room! At 10mm thick I think it will make a nice slim single layer setup. I may have to change things up for wiring, enclosure mounts, other components, but I am going to shoot for single layer. At least single layer in the middle, I could get creative and go taller near the base of the trucks where clearance is not as much of an issue.

Bearings and mounting hardware came in. I was able to mount the trucks and wheels. I used a wedged riser on the back and a couple shock pads on the front. 

Just as I was going to go for its first ride, my boy comes out and snatches from me. He goes for a spin, and not being used to the wide stance, gets thrown by getting tripped up in the wheels while pushing. I gave him some crap and then it was my turn. I proceeded to go thrown myself from wheel bite....karma.....

I changed the bushings around and wheel bite isn't a problem.... I think....

It's a really great ride. One of my upcoming concerns is the enclosure. What are your ideas?

The deck has some flex, which is nice but to keep it you gotta not have a long and stiff enclosure. What battery setup are you using? If it's LiPo's, I guess it won't be too difficult to work around, but a big set of the Li-ion presents slightly different set of challenges. I've seen what other people have done. I'm curious about your approach.
```

I am using Lipo's. I am going to use natural cure silicone to glue them directly to the deck. If you check a few posts up I have a picture with a draft layout of the batteries.

I have a couple ideas for the enclosure that I am zeroing in on. I don't think they are typical. 

 One idea is to use a [Plastic sheet](https://www.mcmaster.com/4296a312) and machine it to match the bottom of the deck, then machine out pockets to fit the batteries and etc. A couple ideas to match the deck are 1. Use a [CMM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate-measuring_machine) to model the deck and use CNC mill to machine. 2. Manually use a router by matching deck contour using deck as jig. 

The second idea which I will probably go with is to only machine a raised perimeter, think of a 1/2" or so tall wall a 1/2" wide that runs the perimeter of the enclosure area. This would make a basin in which the batteries will lay inside. Then I will use a .080" thick aluminum plate as a lid. The lid will install on to the raised perimeter.  

Both of these options will stiffen the deck and I am ok with that. I like option 1 because the full plastic bottom will be buttery slidey and super durable. The negative is that I think the machining will be very difficult and I will need to start with a very thick piece to match the contours and still maintain depth. The second option is simpler but I worry the aluminum lid would not wear very well. 

I think in your case since you are planning on making an 18650 pack I would make a flex pack using silicone, adhesive fish paper, and flexible connection methods.  Then use a kydex enclosure either self made or by a member here.

I went out for a ride with my son just now. The board ran great until it just stopped working. I checked the focbox and had no lights. I tried pulling the loop key and cycling power on and off but got nothing.  I didn't have a volt meter but my battery looked ok. I came home and checked the battery, it had 40v. I plugged in the loop key and it powered up just fine. Its running fine. Blue power light green signal light. 

Whats up with the focbox?


Here are my settings, I think I will change battery cutoff start/end to 36/34 for the lipos.

Nice build brother. I have a build on Indy 215’s and abec 76 mm’s as well. It’s on a reissue cabellero deck. Loved all the custom work. Your wheel pulley is super legit. Really well done. 
I’m an electrician as well, built my first battery this year. Went with a spot welder and more of a bus bar style p group connection.
Curious what you did for an enclosure.

Thanks man, I would really like to see your indy build. Also I'm interested in building a spot welder for my next build. 

I have some pictures of my enclosure, I just can't find my card reader! I ended up milling side rails out of plastic and tapping for a delrin? Lid. Its super sturdy. I could board slide it!

I found the problem with no power to my focbox was a bad tab on one of my lipos. The factory spot welds a longer strip on to one of the tabs and it worked loose opening the circuit. It was my fault maybe. Due to not providing enough mechanical support of the battery. I had siliconed the batteries but the silicone was only adheared to a plastic film on the battery. I fixed this by soldering the tab back together and using foam to support the batteries.
