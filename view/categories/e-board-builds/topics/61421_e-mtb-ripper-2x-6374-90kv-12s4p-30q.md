Oh, and this for vibration absorption (ESC)

Did you already order the listed parts?

With 90kv your top speed is below 30km/h (18.5mph) but you get crazy torque :crazy_face:.
The Trampa trucks need to be mounted at 30° angle so if you use a longboard deck you need 30° angled risers. The 12s4p flat battery and enclosure works in combination with a longboard deck but wouldn't with MTB deck because of the curvature.

My math came out to different numbers. I'll have to redo the calc in a sec. 

I knew those trucks had to be mounted special, wasn't sure exactly how, I probably will get the risers because the build is for a longboard deck. I really don't want a curved true MTB deck, not for me.

EDIT: Calculator results

Is 65% efficiency for this build too high?

You seem to have put 478mm in your calc for your wheel size...
The tyres you've listed are 150mm.

If you have bought the 90kv ones, you can just compensate with the gearing. Use a lower gearing than usually like 1:3.5 for example, and you will gain ground clearance too!

Ah, brain fart. I was putting in the circumference not the diameter.

Haven't come close to buying it no, I'll be changing my motor to around a 170kv

2 different motors in one build? Or 2 different builds?

Swap things about depending on if I'm hitting flat or trails and I have a few boards
 Because building esk8's is like crack
