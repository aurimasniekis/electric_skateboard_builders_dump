I am fairly new to this so bear with me. I have read through the frequently asked questions and some articles from other sources. Here is my plan for now:

looks good. pretty standard. I would add a anti spark switch.

and for battery, 8s will do about 20mph, 10s will do 25ish...
lipo is your only option at that price.

Would this be suitable: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-compact-4000mah-10s-25c-lipo-pack.html
Thanks

that would work. maybe a bit on the small side.
2x of these in series would be a good 10-12 miles.

you can use my new [calculator](http://calc.esk8.today) to estimate.

and maybe this motor if you want to save $40. unsensored, but thats not an issue.

So when I am making those 2 batteries into a series circuit I just use this: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-series-1pc.html

Then for the anti spark switch where do you put that? I found one here: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-s-anti-spark-connector-2pairs-bag.html

I understand the mechanical parts of making this but the electrical part I am still trying to learn some more stuff. Thanks for helping me it means alot.

Do you plan on soldering your own series harness together?

Even if you just buy one you can just modify it by adding a xt90... That can serve both as your start up key and anti spark plug

This is what I mean by startup key and antisparkplug all-in-one...
The xt90 plugs are antispark, and if you wire it like you see here then all u have to do is either plug/remove the xt90 female(the one in my hand) from the the xt90 male end(sitting on top of battery) to power your board on and off

So literally like a plug. To turn it off you would unplug the thing in your hand? Would this be hard to do? Is there a video or guide that could give me a idea on how to do this? I hope I am not taking too much of your time. Thanks for helping me through this.

Exactly, you plug in the xt90 & it powers ON your board:: you unplug it and it powers OFF...
(by the way I didn't have anymore xt60 connectors so those small xt30 connectors are only shown as an example,,you would need to replace them with  xt60 connectors) 
you can take a look at my Instagram video I actually show myself plugging in the xt90 to power on the board, my username is the same one as here, "suwuj12"

This is almost only tool that you need. Buy 60-80w cheap soldering iron. [quote="zel, post:7, topic:24578"]

Yes you have to solder the wire to the xt90 and xt60 connectors,, unless you already bought a wire harness to connect 2 batteries in series,, then all you would need to do is add the xt90 as I showed in the picture.. As @Tuomalar mentioned if you plan on building your on eboard then a soldering iron
(not soldering gun) is definitely something you need to invest on... You can buy cheap ones from any electronics store they only cost about $15-$20
