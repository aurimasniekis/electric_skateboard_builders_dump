Hi my name is Laurentius. I am quite new into posting in this forum, but I've been reading both endlessphere and electric-skateboard.builders from time to time. This is my first build into small EV, also RC electronics as well as longboarding.

I started this build with very limited knowledge of RC Car and Hobby parts. I can't even skateboard / longboard until December 2015 last year (Start the build October - November 2015). I am not an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer, just a web designer. However I used to be a member of a robotic team in high school and the knowledge of soldering and electrical circuits come in handy.

For me building this eBoard has always been a dream. I always want to make small-medium EV project.
Since I am living without the comfort of home (ex-international student, expat worker) I don't have all of the best and right tools to build this project. But hey, I did it anyway! Cost me more than expected, but worth the satisfaction of achieving a small dream.
<br />
---
My plan is to create **"The create the ideal eBoard (for my self)"** that are:<ul>
<li>Safe speed and safe battery packs, easy to charge and fast to charge</li>
<li>30Km++ distance and easy to carry (thats why I choose Globe Maiden deck so I could drag it along instead of carrying)</li>
<li>Has lights both front and rear</li>
<li>Has matching colors, all black (besides the wheels, I love the orange wheels :smile: )</li>
<li>Last but not least, easy to maintain with available spare parts easily purchased in the Netherlands.</li>
<li>Allowed to be used in open street legally</li>
</ul>

Facts:

My 6S 5000mah could cover  solid 10 km, hence with 10,000mah I could cover solid 20km. If I ride efficiently, does kick push, relatively flat ground and not so windy, I could reach around 30km.

My riding speed is around 20km/h - 25km/h, I found riding 30km/h starting to be dangerous as you can't really brake it hard incase of emergency.

Charging time with 3.5A power supply takes about 2hours and a half to make full charge of the 6S 10,000mah lipo packs.

Since I reside in the Netherlands (Rotterdam &/ Groningen), I am looking for fellow Dutch builders here.
I am not born here, limited with language barriers and knowledge of the countries, it might be quite handy
to get in contact to some of you for questions about building eboard, riding, maintenance, the law, etc.
Since parts for eboard most likely produced / distributed in US / Australia / China, we might also purchase in bundle together.

Currently I have broken 4.10 VESC (new ones ordered) that I wish to fix, but I am not sure where should I fix it in Europe. Shipping cost to US / Australia is alot and close to getting a new VESC.

I am also trying to get RDW uitkering license to get eBoard for the public road (openbare weg), not quite sure what are the requirements for it. What I know from a local shop is that it was not allowed before because it has no brakes.

---

*I'll be uploading more photos soon with inner parts of the board!
Let me know if there are information I need to know / missed. Open for comments and suggestion.

Sick build! Okay major question.  Those ESC's the Turnigy sentilion. are they any good? is it sensored? Is an rpm sensor the same as the 6 sensor wires that are standard? 

It looks exactly like product/torqueboards-12s-120a-car-esc-opto-hv/
Also they have pretty much the same stats

[/quote]

I wouldn't get this ESC anymore after testing VESC. I am using it at the moment because my VESC broke down due to unknown shorts. Still looking for the opt to fix it, but I already ordered new ones anyway.

This ESC was recommended by Charles who is an MIT student studying about EV. It has the best low speed (less cogg) for sensorless BLDC. It's very robust, rock solid and low temperature in operation. The only draw back of this ESC is that it has no SBEC and unadjustable brake. Means either hard brake or no brakes at all (This is a HV ESC not car ESC). This esc also has no hall sensor, but still preferable than those noisy small 6s car esc that has bad startup and loud high pitch brake.

I use the RPM sensor once and connect it to the Ts3t telemetry. Although the ts3t using an optical rpm sensor, I tested and attach the rpm sensor from the Sentilon into the ts3t transmitter module and it works (less accurate).

I would only use this ESC for eBike preferably since bikes has its own mechanical brake.

Good question! I actually don't have dremmel to flatten one side.
I just use hand metal saw to make a wide flat cut that fits for the small bolt that comes from the pulley.

1. Can u provide some information about the anti spark resistor? I would appreciate to see some pictures of the wiring.
2. Do you need a bigger switch, don't you? I think it need to resist about 65A because the motor could draw that amount. Correct me if i am wrong.
3. I think you made 2 battery packs in series and these two "double packs" parallel, am I right? 
Hope to hear from you soon.

Here is a diagram of an Anti-Spark Circuit
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a1196c8f5a859e59cb3fb605690d0da69dc35d6c.JPG'>
Then instead of having those banana plug, I replace them with a switch.

The reason why anti-spark is needed because everytime you connect battery packs and ESC capacitors (especially low resistance high discharge packs), the ESC capacitors directly draw so much current to fill them (FYI: capacitors just like a batteries). Without anti-spark you will constantly see and hear those spark everytime you connect your XT60 connectors. In the long run, this would ruin the female and male connectors (melted) from those sparks. Similar to switch, it would destroy the connectors within the switch.

So the diagram uses 50 ohm, I just use 100 ohm. Bigger resistance means limiting the spark existence even more but it took the toll by slowing down charging the capacitors by miliseconds - seconds. So practically you would like to connect the auxiliary connector first (smaller cable with the 100ohm resistor) before connecting the power connector. Since there is this small cable and resistor, the capacitors cannot draw that much power in a very short time. Within miliseconds - seconds the capacitor is fully charged and by then the charges between batteries and ESC capacitor are in balance, thus connecting both power connector would be spark free.

Alright there is something you need to know about this rocker switch, it's a double polar switch (DPST). That means within 1 switch it has 4 pins instead of 2 pins. That also means you could switch 2 different lights with 1 single physical button.
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a427bbc8929d922c38acebaf47d063825b8adfd1.png'>

Since 1 pole could deliver 15A max (I really should be getting the 20A or 30A), I am doubling it to 30A by using all 4 pins (2 poles) together as 1 switch. So the two poles shares the load 15A and 15A.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/01555f885b5b07deeb3c9a93b02e4c767ef4bfd8.JPG" width="374" height="500">
*See the yellow loop lines connecting both poles.
*Special Note: within this photo I am using normal 100ohm resistor not the metalfilm I listed within the description. I like this 100ohm resistor more compared to the small ones because of it has higher resistance from temperature abuse (if you forgot to switch on both switches).
<br />
Similar to the principle the bigger diameter of cable (lower AWG) the easier the current flow. Same applies here, the more poles, the easier each poles handle the current.

So that left out with why I am not getting those 20A / 30A switch and instead getting the 15A ones. That is simply because of cosmetics :smiley: But I am doing so also with some underlaying test. If you see or use Enertion SPACE cell / li ion cells, they are very low in c rating, means they could only provide max around 60A. Enertion SPACE cell has the ability to deliver 30A max discharge because theres a fuse that protects it from drawing more. If you ever test the current draw of your longboard with a multimeter, it draws around 3A to roughly 15A and sometimes peaking at 20A. So I am really on the safe side here. I am also trying to avoid motor drawing too much power as it would totally shortened the distance travelled.

Yes you're right sorry, it's 2S2P. If it's 1S means I have nothing connected in series :smiley:

This is the overal electronics inside the box. I've decided to reverse mount this electronics so I could detach everything from the board. Another 2 good reasons I am doing this is first I don't really need to glue / bolt any of the electronics to the enclosure incase of maintenance / service as they sit nicely when everything was flipped upside down. The second good reason is I could insert the whole battery pack into a lipo safe bag during charging (Safety First).

This is the close up view of the battery packs. Since I don't really like to cut short the wire from the batteries, I've decided to place them facing each other to be able to fit into the box size. Everything here are almost thight fit and compact.

This is the overview of the electronics department for the Turnigy Sentilon 100A ESC configuration with the Ts3t Remote (with Telemetry) from HobbyKing. I didn't attach all of the telemetry cable and sensors due to the telemetry transmitter module there being faulty. I will switch to the VESC - WII nunchuck anyway within couple of weeks, so I didn't bother fixing this version at the moment.

Since this HV ESC as it's meant for planes or helicopters, temperature could be a big issue here. Nevertheless, I don't want any open port within my enclosure as we have alot rainy days in the Netherlands. So I decided to open the ESC and put alot of the PC arctic silver thermal paste for better heat dissipation. The thermal paste works like a charm without short circuiting and it's literally impossible to desolder any wires on the ESC with 60W solder because of it.
<br/>

Closer look to the switches here, these are high quality inrush rocker switch with double poles (DPST). That means each single physical switch can switch on and off 2 separate electrical switch at the same time. Each poles can handle 15A current, hence by creating a double U shape loop connecting two poles it's capable to handle 30A current.

You could also see my 100 ohm resistor anti-spark circuit. This is not the metalfilm one as I described and this is also not the normal 100 ohm resistor. This has bigger diameter to handle the abuse of heat (incase forgot two switch both switches on).

Last but not least, I've also carry this complete service kit for long trip. Because this is a DIY longboard, though I make sure that I am making the best setup possible, there always chance that there will be mechanical failure / stress could occur anytime. This toolbox has everything from spare belts, T tool, brush, bolts as well as volt meter. In case all electronics are dead or there is a mechanical failure, I could fix or detach the whole electronics and propulsion drive then push the longboard with ease!

Awesome build! 
I'm following this thread now..

I'm from Groningen, building a one-off (ollinboardcomapny) with dual drive dual VESC. Project is on hold now because I'm at work for 3 months outside the NL. But when I'm back I'll hopefully be able to put my deck together and ride the first time.

How about dutch laws of electric vehicles, have you been in contact with the police already? Theoretically it's illegal to drive an electric skateboard in NL. I'm wondering how your experience is..

@jeroenimo Hi nice to know someone from the Netherlands also building an eBoard!. I am currently living both in Rotterdam and Groningen lately (just moved to Groningen few days ago).

To be honest it's very shady about electric longboards law here. I've ride it one or two times in front of the police and they just look at you and not stopping or asking questions. In Rotterdam is actually alot more scarier because of this "hoverboard" bans (500 euro boete), no one is riding any sort of those board. I believe as long as you ride it within normal push cruising speed, no one will actually notice. Everytime i see those cops, I've just tried to hide my remote and push my board once in a while :smiley:

I have tried to reach the police via email but no respond. Yet I also contacted RDW, but their response through email are slow. Maybe I should call them. I've also check what they are doing and small part of their price list, it could be quite expensive. But not sure if those are applicable to individuals as I am not trying to manufacture / sales. RDW it's self is a private company (I believe so according to their description) and their vehicle regulation are EU approval / almost worldwide. So if you have RDW certification, you can ride this board literally everywhere in the world.

Yes, I'm assuming there is more people building and playing with e-boards.
Law is a shady grey area in NL as far as I know, EV's are allowed as long as they are "assisted" and not fully powered, and above 25KM/h they have to cut off assisting the driver.

 It's off course doubtful whenever you are pushing and/or you are fully electrically propelled forward. If a judge has to decide I'm pretty sure a e-board is electric vehicle that will need registration and insurance. This having made the board yourself it will be hard to get a RDW acknowledgement for it. (type approval is a long expensive and tedious process)

Hopefully the law changes, but that I don't see in the near future. Nonetheless I'm hoping to make a lot of safe, none police encounter, hassle free miles on my e-board.

@jeroenimo I actually just called RDW and they send me back to this email department so I could further explain my build. They also said that I have to have the complete build ready before testing and not as prototype yet.

However I am now asking via email mentioning that I am a student doing research on interaction design and innovation. The project would be building a small portable electrical vehicle in a form of longboard. Then I asked them if I could get an approval for open street test prototype product for research purpose and not for manufacturing or sales. Lets wait and see what they reply would be :D

The only way to progress is to push the boundaries so yeah, riding as much as possible and getting caught doing so is part of the process !
I think you're right regarding a home-made board, I too seriously doubt we will ever be able to legally ride a DIY e-board due to missing type approval and CE compliance.

That would mean you will have to have a license plate on your e-board, when approval regulations are met. I doubt it, but it would for sure be cool.

I'm pretty sure segway paid quiet some money for type approval, and I'm not sure if a single person will have enough funds to get a specific type approval for a home build board. 

But don't get me wrong, something should be done!

e-boards are the future, just as anything that is emission free, gets people from A to B in a nice, fast, and safe way. It wondered me why these segway things have not been more popular, but I would not want to be seen on one of these ugly things ;-). Bicycles are still the way to go in NL for "normal people", and that will remain for a long time I expect..

@trbt555 & @jeroenimo Well lets see how far I could get this into. I've just sent them a more complete email with some tech specs regarding the board. I've mentioned VESC and RC motors. I also explained it's a research project, similar to TU Delft student building solar cars.
RDW also appreciate innovative industries, so we have abit of gap here to exploit :smiley:

Anyway first goal:
1. Get my own board a license (prototype / research / legal moped / any legal category).
2. If I could, then lets see about manufacturing or licensing parts.

If fail:
1. Lets see if I could get any of the parts VESC &/ Motor &/ Batteries &/ Remote CE compliance
2. If still fail.. YOLO!

If it's too expensive / not possible, at least we tried and we know the price.
We also know what category of vehicle it should be / they will make new ones.

But if succeed, we revolutionised portable personal electric vehicle. Well said!
Getting approval for each parts of the board would be the gateway to start. Open new possibilities to another DIY project and expanding. If it's only for a particular product / brand, it's still not doing any good, end up like Segway.

I totally understand that and that would be the last resort attempt. Lets hops its not going to happen.

But speaking about fraud, what we are doing now is also offending the law that has been established by riding an unauthorized vehicle in open street. I believe its also equally as bad.

Now I am start searching for a help from TTV technishce inspecteur from RDW about tips in making it succed to get a license or allowance trhough personal communication and not through RDW yet.

There has to be a legitimate way to solve this.

Theres actually one product I found that has CE compliance and requires RDW request for approval. This seems to be also an option to create eboard with CE compliance. It might cut cost of certifying process.

@trbt555 & @jeroenimo Okay The RDW has replied me and I believe there is some future around this.

In late 2010, the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment in the Road Traffic Law 1994 in Article 20b a new category introduced special mopeds. These include to Segway-like vehicles. **For this, no European approval shall be required.** (Staatsblad (Official Gazette), No. 744). **In the Netherlands these vehicles can not be registered.** The Minister pointed these vehicles.

What is a special moped?
Special moped: moped as defined in Article 1, first paragraph, section e, under d of the Law for which an application for designation under Article 20b of the Law has been submitted to the Minister;

This is Article 1, first paragraph, section e under d of the law.
http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006622/HoofdstukIIA/Artikel20b/geldigheidsdatum_29-01-2016

Article 20b (Google Translation in English)
<ol>
<li>Prior to admission to the traffic on the road Our Minister may a motor vehicle with a maximum design speed not exceeding 25 km / h, equipped with an internal combustion engine with a cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 cm 3 or an electric motor with a maximum continuous rated power does not exceed 4 kW, not being a disabled vehicle, designate a type or individual on the grounds of his safety if:<ul>
<li>a. the authorization corresponds to in [Article 2, paragraphs a and b, second paragraph and third paragraph, subparagraph a , above purposes;][1] and</li>
<li>b. there been realized rules is required for this vehicle is not in accordance with a type approval in the framework of the European Union.</li></ul>
<li>A ministerial regulation further rules may be adopted concerning the designation.</li>
</ol>

---

The manufacturer of such special mopeds may report it to the Ministry. The address is:
Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment
Management Roads and Traffic Safety
Contact: Hans de Leeuw
PO Box 20 901
25 400 EX Hague
e-mail: hans.de.leeuw@minienm.nl.

---

The admission process consists of two main parts:

security screening. There will be investigated regarding the way of riding can participate safely in the vehicle in traffic;
an investigation by the RDW vehicle technical aspects. The RDW investigates whether the vehicle satisfies the standing requirements for such mopeds, such as (from January 1, 2012) in the Vehicle Regulations included.
The RDW has decided to focus the assessment of such special mopeds on the testing station in Waddinxveen. The testing makes the assessment a test report. This will be sent to the Ministry.
 
A special moped will not be registered. On the basis of the results of both studies the minister's decision to operate if the vehicle is be appointed or not.

---

Then theres this special info:
**Use of a special moped**
For more information on the use of particular mopeds I refer you to the website of the Ministry infrastructure and the environment, see:http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/bromfiets/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-regels-gelden-er-voor-een-segway.html.

**Chassis number**
A vehicle of the category "special moped 'must bear a VIN. The vehicle manufacturer may apply for a WIM code, for more information, I refer you to our website, see: https://www.rdw.nl/sites/tgk/Paginas/WMI-code-voor-(nieuwe)- voertuigfabrikanten.aspx. The RDW has decided not to store chassis numbers in a special moped. This is because the often small vehicles have a special (vulnerable) material. Our equipment is not designed to provide specific mopeds with a correct VIN.

---

Correct me if I am wrong:
I have the feeling from this email it seems that the category of special mopeds is already allowed without the needs of vehicle registration as the ministry has released a regulation for Segway like vehicle. The category for segway like vehicle according to the Article 20b for electric drive is

**electric motor with a maximum continuous rated power does not exceed 4 kW**
where our Turnigy SK3 motor 200Kv'ish is rated around 2500 Watt which is below the 4kW rating.

And I believe the next step would be finishing my eboard and go to testing station in Waddinxveen.

If you ever test the current draw of your longboard with a multimeter, it draws around 3A to roughly 15A and sometimes peaking at 20A.

Have you tested that with the above listed configuration?

Yes I've tested it with my eBoard build configuration. Sometimes I also wonder when does the motor would draw 65A, but I believe it has something to do also with the voltage. So if the motor could handle 36V, maybe 65A would only be drawn if you have 36V configuration and try to climb up hill. However you really need to confirm this with some electro expert.

The fact that some batteries such as li ion and space cell have low current discharge (20A - 30A), makes me feel safe that those are the current are the one that would be drawn by the motor. Anyway if your ESC / Motor draw 65A continuous, for sure you will fry the ESC first than dmg the motor. It's rated for peak, so meant to last 1 - 5 secondish.

the thing you got to realize is that "150A" ESC has no hope in hell of actually handling "150A" so.. when you buy 150A ESC you are more likely buying a ~60A ESC
the numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt.
a lot of people get confused about Amp ratings and its no wonder..  they are so often exaggerated.

I agree with @lowGuido that okay the marking said 150A ESC but they are actually not as powerful as it's written. Anyway the value 150A is only specifying max current draw, in which only last couple of seconds before your ESC start to burn. One more thing, this ESC are made for RC car and not to push 60kg++ weight for over 10km++ distance. I believe the RC ESC manufacturer just adjusted this value to make people choose ESC - motor and battery easier for RC.

However I have the feeling that the battery could deliver almost the amount of discharge rate specified. Many people store some lipo inside their car (dangerous not recommended) to jump start their car battery.

Unlike motor, I believe they are "half true" of what they could actually deliver. As stated that most Turnigy SK3 motor rated from 149kv to 245kv known to output around 2500W (36V 60A) peak, they can manage to do 30A (half of the peak value) for some period of time.

Th VESC is only 60amps, and it is known for being the best. 

The difference is that it was specifically made for diy eboards... the car esc's were made to push around little 5kg cars. 

They were never designed to handle the load of a 65kg+ person trying to go 40kph. So it is correct that you can easily run a space cell, a VESC, and a turnigy motor and limit your entire setup to 30amps MAX and have absolutely zero problems. But the VESC was designed with this idea in mind... 

The car esc's were simply never made to handle conditions 100x harder than what they are designed for, so if you want them to actually work, you have to get a higher amp rating.

Because this wireless nunchuck seems to be compatible with various Wii products.

However when I opened the receiver, the wiring are different than the Nyko Kama (Uses different colors of cable and different poles position). It took me about 5 - 10 minutes to figured out the rewiring.

Currently just waiting for @chaka to send me new VESC as well as repair my broken one. Then I will make the report of it.

Okay I am enforcing RDW and or the ministry to move Electric Longboard in the special moped category. It could be done, but there are also specifications that special moped has to have. It's quite a lot but doable to fit into the board. You can read it here in Dutch.

http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0035848/geldigheidsdatum_05-02-2016

If you be able to complete all of this in your board, no cops can stops you and as good as it's approved with VIN number, literally this give you the flex to get your electric longboard insured and are able to drive in EU without problem.

Well from my point of view now, I would only go the extra mile if I have my vesc on hand. I will test it with madcatz nunchuck the model I have with it. If it doesnt work and I have plenty of time, i will try to compile it.

I understand what Vedder NRF solution is. He created a new pcb board build like VESC, but its a replacement board for a nunchuck. Its a good solution, but again manufacturing problem for common people.

From time, effort and risk perspective, it simply better getting new enertion remote or the mini torqueboard remote. This also limit random drop out issues, bugs and shorts.

For now Im going to look for some chinese remote supplier if they can send me good remote for electric longboard to be send to eu.

I'm not quite sure about this as soldering and simply connecting pins are relatively the same. It must have been due to bugs or bad wiring. It's not only known within this forum that the drop outs occur with wii nunchuck. I suppose now it's already better and doesn't seems to be a big issue, but still it's a hit - miss thing for different eboard specs from different people.

No it isnt. not even close to the same.
soldering is solid and wont vibrate loose.  It is pretty well documented that soldering will prevent nunchuck dropouts.

@lowGuido  Yes you have a point, hard to explain how that could happen like that. Seems that vibration is the culprit that causes electricity / electrons moving inconsistent, causing bad signal within wii module. However this should not happen easily due to the use of wii as game - sport types of controller as you would like to swing and slam this around. Anyway if the problem is solved, it's solved.

@DeathCookies You will need to use the Ohm meter / connection / continuity mode. With continuity mode your multi meter will sound a beep when the positive lead and the negative lead of the multimeter touches each other. So now you practically touch one end (positive from multimeter) to the plug of the receiver and the other end (black from multimeter) to the pcb board of the receiver. You will need to search for it till it make the beep sound. Then you will know what pin are they for from the PCB. (I hope this doesn't confuse you).

If you don't have the beep / continuity mode, you can use ohm meter for it (resistance checker). If your multimeter is digital, you will see the resistance value change. If you use analog multimeter (needle pointer), set it to the lowest resistance range, so every time positive and negative lead of the multimeter touch each other the needle would move significantly.

You can't compare vibrations from riding an eboard to swinging a controller for a video game especially if you tend to ride on rough roads.

also do not confuse movement with vibration, the vibration on a skateboard is far more brutal to electronics than just swinging around. skateboard vibration is not to be underestimated!

I am sorry, just a last thing to mention: The receiver would be plugged into the wii where id does not vibrate. But in plugging it into the esc it will vibrate ;) But enough of that

Thanks for the explanation of the "wire checking method". I could easily understand it. I just had a mindtwist.... it is easy as the plug must be the same for every nunchuk... damn me

as much as the plug and wires are the same for every nunchuck there are some that play well with VESC and some that don't. I don't understand why, because to me nunchuck signal is nunchuck signal..   but perhaps there is some other signal or something which keeps the transmission between the dongle and the chuck, that could be different between manufactures

I was getting Madcatz nunchuck with the same understanding that nunchuck signal just nunchuck signal, I mean what else it could be. The data or way of transmission from nunchuck to receiver could be different, but the signal output from the receiver should be the same.

Well I believe we have donated really alot to the development of VESC with more than thousands beta testers. Now I believe he has to put more serious effort in it to bring his idea (building the best esc) into further reality. I mean it's not that far from perfect at the moment, but he has to get it there.

The best way to solve this is to add support for various Wii wireless remote (I believe it's easier than making own Wii NRF pcb). With just a few click on the BLDC tool, we can replace the VESC handshake support from Nyko kama to Madcatz or any other popular wii nunchuck out there.

Ohh btw, does anyone have issues with safety concern concerning single mount motor setup? I've just got an incident where I have to fall because of traction issue.

I was hitting 12mph and accelerating, but there is a small bump only happening on the powered motorized back wheel. Hence for some fractions of seconds the powered wheel loose traction and spin faster, but when it retouches to the ground, it gets its traction back and immediately spin the board side ways.

Does anyone ever had that experience?

Seriously?!
Isn't it rather time for the community to support Benjamin with some solid contribution like coding apps and enhancements instead of demanding him doing things for you? 

Whatever he contributed until now was done by him free of charge and open source. If he would have patented his ideas things would be completely different and many companies would like to have such a powerful tool. Still, he's straight forward on this and it's still free, therefor it's not on our side to demand him doing anything!

Sorry if I am bad speaking and yes you got a point there, but you also got to see from the perspective of a non-developer / engineer. I would put effort into helping Vedder improve his design if I could, apparently I couldn't. Speaking from donation (money to push) perspective is wrong, however (badly speaking) donation are one way to respect and keep this VESC development alive. At least now we have discovered that DRV failing is a big issue and one of the best I could do is to get it to community attention as well as the builder attention. Most of us are just beta-tester, harsh speaking theres nothing more we could do about it beside asking.

Speaking of fact, most of Vedders update came from him self. 3 contributors on the github page for the BLDC hardware and 7 contributors on the BLDC tool. Not everybody has your awareness of improving VESC capability, harsh truth of open source things. Many users, minimum developers.

The level of sophistication and speciality has gone way too far for many to contribute to the development.
I couldn't think of a solution to fix many VESC DRV failure, Now could you think of a solution with me how to fix this? How to help Benjamin improve his product?

*Don't get me wrong, VESC is a wonderful product and is free (open source). I respected Vedder for that!*

Great news just arrived from RDW. They considered electric longboard as a special moped, hence RDW can't do anything to provide any paper / certification to the vehicle.

Yeah like my previous post. The RDW consider electric longboard as a special moped, however the ministry is the one who truly decide if that is a special moped. The ministry it's self cannot justified / decide the special moped category without the help of RDW.

So I've received some updates from the ministry, it's quite long with the things needs to be done. Practically test needs to be conducted, especially electromagnetic radiation. The range of the cost is already estimated between €400 - €800 euro. The ministry them self suggest me to have the prototype as readily build and greatly build before sending it to the test department. At least they want to see some photos and specifications before really pointing out certain test to RDW. It's a long abit ambiguous process and definitely costly.

According to some people whom I forwarded the mail, it will cost time and effort more than money, but it's not impossible.

At this moment I am still waiting from @chaka for my 3 VESC. It should be delivered around this week and expected to arrive next week (or he might already sent it last week).

Hopefully I have enough budget to try out turnigy graphene, that would be great but we will see. I am also going to try chinese dual hub motor. I have it already on hand, seems pretty solid for my weight and super silent compared to satellite configuration. I still find problem here and there, but I will put this on a new thread.

For the next upgraded build, I have decided to fine tune my lipo battery construction.
I have them opened from their shrink wrap, have them cleaned and cable trimmed.
This is how it looks like now!

You will get the tracking update later today when I finish packing orders. Great job reworking that lipo pack. Very clean work! Be careful with those voltage alarms. They drain cell # 1 and 2 really quickly. It is better to use a simple voltage display and power it with 5v from either the VESC or an sbec/ubec buck converter.  The specs say you can supply them with up to 30v but it could get hot powering the display with that much voltage.

Hi thank you. There is a difference between balance charger and bms, however they does the same job more or less. The balancer charger is balancing cells but its located outside your board while bms mostly would be located inside your board.

Normally people use BMS for 18650 cells while people with lipo use balance charger. Some balance charger requires a power supply as well depending in the model.

BMS can also be used for lipo, while balance charger can also be used for 18650 cells.

My balance charger is Turnigy Accuceil and I use laptop power supply. If you havent got a charger yet and your thinking of using lipo, go for IMAX B6 it has power supply already.

Well the simplest explanation would be one is inside your board integrated with the batteries, one is outise your board independently charging your battery. You need only either one of them.

If I understand you correctly I don't use voltage meter plugged in all the time to show battery capacity. I dont use percentage display but more what is the voltage per cell.

Hi @Joep I will reply in english as the languages here are in english. To keep everybody Happy!.

First I am not sure if you would be able to do it within this summer time as mostly parts are coming all over the place takes time to arrive. If you are first time builder, mistakes and reordering are unavoidable. My suggestion is simple. Read read and read. Ask as many people as you can, just PM them. If you have any doubts, get it out. There should be more than enough information to get a simple belt driven build or a hub motor build to get started with. You should be good to go.

I couldnt draw very fast, however the connections I am using is very standard. Just 2 lipo being soldered together in series (the main cables) and then using twin charging connector from hobbyking to create series 6s connections on the balance plug. Very simple, I only repackaged this. You should be very careful when soldering the lipo in series and connecting the twin charging harness as it could short out the lipo if its not being done properly.
