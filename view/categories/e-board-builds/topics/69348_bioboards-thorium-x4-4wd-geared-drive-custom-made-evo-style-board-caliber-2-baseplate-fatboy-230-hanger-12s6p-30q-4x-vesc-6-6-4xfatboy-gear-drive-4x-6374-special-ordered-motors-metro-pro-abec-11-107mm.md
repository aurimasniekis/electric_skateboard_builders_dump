```
So after riding both Evolve and raptor 2 i decided i want the fastest and best board i could find and the best world from both hub and belt drives and IMO the closest is geared drive.
And i would like really long range!
So i have tried and ordered a lot of different parts to find out what works.
I felt I don´t want to just assemble the board so i decided to create the deck by my self. Will post more pictures of how I did make the decks later, maybe i offer them for sale to just the decks.

The parts is:

* Self made deck that is almost a copy of the Evo Deck
* 4 x 6374 sealed motors from Maytech but i special ordered them with a few change and winding for 215 kv
* 4 x Flipsky 6.6 Vesc
* 2 x Fatboy 230 Hanger @Kug3lis 
* 4 x Fatboy Gear drive @Kug3lis
* 1x 12S6P Battery with charge only made by @Acido (have been really helpful can recommend him a lot!)
* Metro Pro bluetooth module @rpasichnyk 
* Vibration damping mat
* 2 x Caliber 2 baseplate
* Riptide bushings and pivot
* 2 x Riptide tunnel riser
* Eboosted Enclosure for evo board DS @Eboosted 
* Abec 11 107 mm wheels

Well that is basically the main parts, a few more items will be added later.
I don't have so many pictures atm but will post more videos and pictures later.
Here is after the board have been painted:

Tested how it look with the eboosted enclosure done by @Eboosted
![IMG_20180922_152705|375x500](upload://r68ncS7sWexJ0qXW4mhVwT8W3YO.jpeg) 

The board upper side will be black stained to the you can se the wood but still black and have a gripe tape sprayed on.

Here is some pictures of the assemble of the gear drive and motor:
Testing how the drive is mounted before i start the work:
![IMG_20180915_163202_1|375x500](upload://8H1PntiMXA9ekFa505E1oxqT35r.jpeg) 
Changing the angle to work with my board:
![IMG_20180922_144605|375x500](upload://kCgrmaLrshPcIKiSXCLY4iQGnR1.jpeg) 
Cutting the motor axle to work with the gear drive:
![IMG_20180922_143601|375x500](upload://hBVulno2fmeCHIbkYGuXLMDKuo1.jpeg) 
The pulley test mounted:
![IMG_20180922_160241|666x500](upload://wCF28rgSU6Wdo0AMPD6k2ZJX0f5.jpeg) 
Putting grease on:
![IMG_20180923_122310|375x500](upload://xAn6Uek8X5EZQ8XUXtqY70jAzWP.jpeg) 

After that and putting the case on i found out the motor pulley was to long out, the problem was a retaining ring close to the motor on the motor axle that was needed to be removed so i needed to redo all the work with again (was not that happy at that moment hehe )
Here are the finished with only the case left to mount:

More pictures and video will come later! All i can say this is insane and the sound is amazing :smiley: !!

Want one to? Soon(winter 2018/19) you can order the same on www.bioboards.eu if you live in EU or the nordic site www.bioboards.se (sites not online atm but will soon be) . Their will also be a smaller 30" board that is lighter with same parts but 12s3p battery.
The final version for sale will use Focbox Unity instead. 
They will be sold with almost no or very little profit just because i think its so fun to build! I might also add a cheaper version with same parts but hub motors and 90mm abec 11 front wheels for those who like the design of the decks and still want the best parts available under the enclosure.

The website is password protected atm before its done, the eu url is not working atm but will in a few days. I think i'l take pre-orders in like 1-2 mouth whene I got more time to test it and feel confident all is working perfect. And it will probely take 2-3 mouth for delivery after pre ordered for me to order all parts and assembly it so maby delivery around Christmas or January.

Nice work, beautiful paint job. Is that a satin sheen with the black paint you used? I went through just about every sheen before choosing satin. I then repainted the eboosted enclosure to match, making the connection to the enclosure blend nicely. How thick is the foam your laying down between the battery and the deck? I have the same enclosure and started with much thicker foam (on both sides of enclosure) but had to thin way down to fit a stacked staggered 12s6p.

Hi, ty! It's a black clear coat 40 but I will probely use satin for the coming boards since it's abit more enduring(atleast what I heard) .
I actually have thinked about that to! Can you share me a picture how the enclosure looks painted? 
I used 1/4in Neoprene on both sides to, it's very tight but that's good thene the enclosure help hold the weight from battery. I mount all on the deck so it's easy to work with and easy to remove the enclosure almost like the raptor 2 are.

I only have this picture on me at the moment. I’m actually repainting/sanding the enclosure to remove a few scratches now that I know little clearance I have. I’ll post a better one soon.

Became overly obsessed with tiny swirl marks left by hand sanding with 220 grit. Ended up buying an orbital sander with foam interface for the curved surfaces. Beginning to wonder why they bothered me so much.

If you don't mind me asking, why did you get the motors with such a high kv for a 12s battery pack?

Good thing your using VESC 6, and not the VESC 4.12...  Your ERPM is gonna be crazy high with that setup, lol.  What is your projected max speed?  Keep the pics coming, I love this build :smile:

That makes sense.  I was originally planning a 4WD hub build and was going to get custom kv a bit higher for the same reason.   I figured that for my first board though I'll just do a 2WD, but with the new TB 6380's.

This looks great!  Can you detail how you did the 4 VESC's via canbus cable?  Like the wiring mainly, and then any other things you had to do to make 4 VESC's all run together this way. I was planning a 4WD build, but the only thing that I kept getting confused about was how to wire it properly.

In my current build I've got dual ESCape's and the DieBieBMS, which has two canbus ports.  So I was told I could run both VESC's to the BMS, and then assign the BMS as ID:10, and then for the VESC's just do a typical master/slave config.  Though I'm not sure if I still need to connect the VESC's together or not...  Lol, ok sorry to sidetrack from your thread.  Just an explanation of how your did your VESC's would be great :smile:

Hi,
Ofc I can help you. I'm not familiar with diebiebms. 
But for vesc connect it with canbus cable you daisy chain connect, or if you have 2 dual vesc just use 1 cable connect them both. In vesc tool, connect 1 vesc 1 by 1, do motor wizard, thene app wizard, choose can bus is 1,2, 3 and 4, also on app wizard start choose 1 as master the other as slave, thene power off connect canbus cable and power on and you are rdy for 4wd! Remember to invert motor on 1 side so they all move forward. Good luck!
```

## \#44 Posted by: mackann Posted at: 2018-10-14T18:36:24.167Z Reads: 547

```
For diebiebms I think you just do a canbus connector in the daisy chain so you totally have 3(dual) or 5(singel vesc) connector. Give the diebiebms a canbus ID that is not the same as the other vesc as example 5 if you used 1-4 for the vesc
Edit: but this is just a gues, I never used diebiebms

Ok today I finally did assamble it and fixed all wiring and tested it. Lots of time waisted because it took me 3 hours to find out why the fu** I got drv error on one vesc suddenly for no reason. Luckily I found it and it whas not broken, it whas a medalic dust who shorted a pin on the chip....
So here it is(not easy to fit all this electronics, can't wait to get dual unity, it will make it alot easier thene 4 single) :
![IMG_20181019_165439_031|624x500](upload://fzZWKxRgvEs19FgncHE4QjiTdnQ.jpeg)

Didn't have time to fix the holes in the enclosure but tomorrow I will so I will finnaly ride it!

@Itsmedant I will try next week to visit the joinery and take some picture of the process. But I'm actually consider to buy boards for the ones I will sell because they take to mutch time to fix. But will still paint them the same way and mill them for the 120a discharge bms in the 4wd version.

A video from first street test:
https://youtu.be/NLkgHekPcs4
Wow it felt like I was riding my raptor 2 downhill when I did a uphill and I wasn't even close to full throttle probely only 15% because it was wet and the board didn't have any grip on it. Can't wait to do a full test with full power and grip!

Did alot of uphill test today. WOW the hillclimb is crazy it feels lik im going downhill. I did at max 60 km/h on a steep uphill and i was not even close to throttle the remote max! And the brakes is increadible strong in both high speed and low speed, i did have to lower the settings alot for the brakes. First try i did go downhill at around 30 km/h and almost flew of when i did the brake :smiley:

Cool build. love the work and hope to see it in person soon

One word of advice in selling it with no profit margin though. If something goes wrong (and in eskate, its more when), you will lose money building and selling these boards with no profit margin. Profit is necessary for 2 reasons. First, when something goes wrong, you have money to fix it. And second, it allows you to get any components not made in house at better prices, lowering the price for everyone (or increasing your profit margin).

Also, test things for sometime first. I don't think those esc's will last (I have my reasons why), and even gears ect. you should have an idea of how long they will last.

Hi, ty for your advice. I will have a little profit, but it will be better when I sell more boards and can order bigger batch of parts. I got a investment of 25k to secure first orders parts and also put in 7k by my own to be safe and have money for warrenty. So in the long run ofc I need some profit. I will use focbox unity in the boards for sale and I'm confident that it will hold with their knowledge from Focbox(I'm using this 6.6 because unity is not in stock yet and normal focbox can't have the erpm I need) . Also I will deliver first orders in February so I have time to test them alot. Atm I'm building 6 versions of it and we will se how they work out.

80km/h is the theoretical value, you won't ever reach it, not just because of the lack of power at higher speeds but because vescs have a max duty cycle of 0.95

I notice there is a setting you can change to up or down that value, it let me input 1.0 but I didn't care to fuck with it. Would changing the duty cycle to 0.98 or 1 do anything? Or because there would be no modulation at 1 (solid line) this would be pointless and just simply not work? Is it the microprocessor on a vesc that can't process more precise values between 0.95 - 0.99999, or something to do with signal accuracy? Just curious... Why have an adjustable parameter for it? Any use to setting lower values if we can't go up?

the fets need some T_off time, playing with values over .95 might cause severe damage. 

Fets work by quickly switching on and off, thus a minimal off value is required.

I'm all for pushing the boundaries on anything, and this board is an absolute beauty and work of art.... BUT.... from a commercial point of view surely a slower (say 60kph-ish) and therefore more reliable setup would make more sense? Sure sell it with the same hardware, allow or even teach buyers how to tune it to get the theoretical maximum out of it, but selling it ready to ride already on the limit is business suicide (and noob with too much money suicide) !

Don't get me wrong, I love this board, but it's too fast for virtually everyone. It's bonkers, and because it's maxed out from the start it's likely prone to problems like all finely tuned speed wagons. Is there a market for such a beast, or would a detuned but reliable - and still class leading - board be the more commercially viable option ?

Just a thought. Don't get me wrong, I drool over the workmanship in this project!

Well I don't think many "normal" ppl will spend all that money on the 4wd. The 2wd that I think more ppl will buy  will have around the same price as other high performance board will have higher gear ratio and will do around 40mph and that is what many high spec boards already doing but it will have better torque and range then the others(and brakes thanks to gear drive). The 4wd is probely for the skilled ppl that already have a 30-40 mph board and want to push it harder and are willing to spend this kind amount of money on a board. I don't recommend anyone going 50mph, if you fall you would probely hurt yourself alot, I know I already did on 30mph. But just like a bmw m4 doing 300 doesn't mean you drive it in 300 km/h, you could just enjoy the insane torque and brake performance.

Well I am making 7 boards atm.
It will be 3 different decks. 
39evo deck 1 version with 2wd, 1 version with at wheels and the 4wd is already made. 
Then their will be a 36 deck with very good performance but it will be price competitive with evolve. 
Then the jet spud deck but the new 31 version with kick. 
All will have 6374 motors with around 220kv expect the AT deck will have 150kv, all will also be gear drive. 
But this board I make/have made atm will not be for sell, will use them for ppl to test them and for me and my partners to ride. Will start making boards for sell after I launched the webshop by the end of this month. And In February start making boards for sell. (31 deck will have 12s3p and 39 12s6p)
Here is the 36 deck that will have a 12s4p 30q battery:
![IMG_20181204_185828|666x500](upload://ryW1s2dJy59sWt0SehQlbWsl0D.jpeg) ![IMG_20181204_185850|666x500](upload://wg9EOUiqkHQD9pFfMi7Ttoe7Y5P.jpeg)
This deck will come with the grip and paint it comes with, because I whant it to have a low price. The other two (39 and 31)will be painted black:
![IMG_20180923_002557_208|500x500](upload://4AG8oNK6rUGhs9nMmrdNnAAlNDW.jpeg) ![IMG_20180924_094501_562|465x500](upload://9I9AdV81mriBif2go0JhzMGOAOP.jpeg)
All will have Unity in them I'm beta testing atm:
![IMG_20181114_171740|375x500](upload://awogRdxHqS2IsURiJ2EgeVI1oYa.jpeg)
All decks will have the 107mm wheels from abec11:
![IMG_20181119_184614|375x500](upload://sbEt8NshCI51apzZrLLJdO2AZXk.jpeg)

![IMG_20181205_213611|375x500](upload://onavZvc7NmzG7CiOiBUYm2vcP08.jpeg)
All 39 version of the board will have 230 hangers and riptide bushings and pivot:
![IMG_20181205_192640|375x500](upload://A4uB1L1VMXZwMLkaQ19TZ6jnrnH.jpeg)
![IMG_20181205_174952|666x500](upload://3lMwu2W7QZexTjovxEbAECQ155x.jpeg)
The 31 and 36 deck will have tb 218 hangers

Will use eboosted enclosure for the 31 and 39 deck (for the 36 it will be another lower priced one not revealed yet)

Tbh I'm not a expert on grease, I know 3dservicas recommends a grease called molycole g67 or something like that. But I did already have this grease for motor gears to elevators so I used it instead of buy a new one. It will probably work fine, but try ask @3DServisas they would probably know best.

The first board i made i did press it by my self, or well with help from my friend who owns a carpenter. We used a friends evo as a template and it is very close to a exact copy of the evo.
But it took to mutch time and was hard to get it the exact same way so it would fit with the evo enclosure so second and more board i made was using the evo deck but we paint it and mill for the battery by our own. And probely landyachtz would sue me if I use a copy of their deck for sale 😂 Also I got a landyachtz resseler acount so the money saving was not big anymore to.
Here is two more deck with my own design I made by my own that have more flex and me and my friend use them for normal cruising without motors:

Its just a bit unbelievable. I felt like this was going to a great opportunity to show some craftsmanship on the forum. But now, its just deep pockets, buying prebuilt, and throwing them together and calling it "new".

This is a DIY forum. Do it YOURSELF. I just want to see what you did....if you did it.

I am a little confused. Did you press these decks?

@mackann strap in boys its going to be a long witch hunt. Time to start telling people about business and how you only prototype with self pressed decks and how anyone who actually wants to make money and not just be a cult leader won't press their own decks for a multitude of business reasons.  If they do they'll stay stuck in their garages or basements like @treenutter and myself.

I did press 1 evo copy, not the 2 on the picture (and never stated i did), i did press those 2 other decks to yes. Or well not me alone, me and my friend who owns the carpenter and tbh i probely couldnt do it alone without hes help. I can´t understand what you think is so hard when i basically just did a copy? I never claimed it was my design? I said its a evo copy.
Please write to me in pm instead, i dont want this this thread to be about proving something about a deck.

I think we might have a language barrier thing happening here.

I think when @mackann said he pressed the deck, he didn't realize that most people would assume that the production boards, or the boards that he will be selling, are NOT going to be pressed by him but rather purchased from a manufacturer.

 I think it might be better if we all cool down and not devolve to name calling, as vendors who start throwing slurs at people don't typically fare well, and see if @mackann is interested in explaining his process adn what the plan is.

Regarding Pressing the decks, who cares? Its irrelevant and at this stage is a bit petty given the larger picture. 
This guy's trying to bring DIY-esque builds to the mainstream, and has done a pretty solid job in the creation of  custom boards for different audiences. 

Lets support the community, not go on witch hunts on such irrelevant tangents

To answer your question, I once again think its possible we have a language barrier thing.  People often make the assumption that it 1 fact is proven untrue that all the other facts are questionable, and not unnecessarily so.

If you take that @mackann 's statement that he pressed the deck and assume that means he will be pressing all the decks, which turns out to be NOT what is happening (as I understand it) then it looks like a lie on the face of it.  

If it turns out that he pressed the deck, as a prototype with no intention of pressing all the decks, or even just changed his mind, but did not understand the assumptions that would be made from his previous statement then all this becomes a culture and language issue.

I can believe I just typed 200 words to explain a theory about 7 words :).  Either way, let just give the man a minute to explain whats happening before we start getting ropes.

Knew you didn't do it yourself. She recently went to Stockholm actually. While she was there she used a chisel to make a cut out on a clone evo deck by tying it on to the bottom of a string and swinging it around the room for 45 mins.

Yeah its true. Turning and carving while accelerating a 4WD is pretty dangerous.
theres different behavior of the wheels even at the same speeds if you accelerate or not.
EDIT: Some people like the feeling, because it feels a bit like aquaplaning and most of them think its the special feeling on riding 4WDs, but its not.

I have no experience with 4wd esk8s but it sounds logical due to the weight transfer to the rear, the front wheels will un-weigh and lose traction.\
Theoretically that should give understeer which many people find safer and more predictable to oversteer.

That is all in theory at least and I could be completely mistaken

For extra speed, going up hills, and just plan showing off the speed to the car next to me on main St, I would kick in the rear system and feels like a turbo booster or something. 4x4 is everything for me. But that's just me lol.

Just received a thorium 4WD. Right on time. And excellent communication from Markus. Which is reassuring after I lost 1700 usd without a word for 2 years from f... g Carvon. 
Just looking at the thorium with the 4 geared motors is crazy. The all black look with some green is great too. The pack is carefully prepared. The enclosure was sealed with silicon. 
The 4 geared motors are compact and impressive. Awesome build in every details! 
Big shout out to Markus!
Ride is at the same level. Balance and feels are great, although I would love some more flex. 
Acceleration is insane, do not use full throttle without straps!
I changed for 8inches tyres to go on single tracks. 
I confirm that traction is perfect with the last version of software. I climb uphill on wet grass where my 2wd emountain boards just loose traction and stop. 
I tested very irregular soil with wet grass. Easy too! Even at low speed. Other boards need speed to go through this track. 
Start again after a stop on a hill on tracks is easy where other boards need a push.
Whaouh!!!!

I think the primary issue is weight, unfortunately.... :thinking:

As an upside though, if someone did actually put this on a bag and wear it around, I figure it wouldn't be too uncomfortable since its pretty well balanced

Osprey kamber 22 backpack. It is designed to carry skis or snowboards and is also sold by lacroixboards.
It works well with skis and lacroixboards, should be OK with thorium

I see plastic gears are used in drivetrain. Any advantage using it over metal ones? What lifetime do you expect?

Only wheel gear is plastic.
Metal with metal will be a lot of noise and there will be no slip.
Its high strength plastic and it have been rided for 3000 km so far without any visible wear.
