please help me with my custom Frankenstein build. 
I have a Meepo v1. works great but the feel is terrible due to those hub motors back wheels. so i got a Direct Drive from Bound Motor. real wheels feel great BUT i am only getting max speed of 7mph. the Meepo ESC does not like the DD motors? or maybe because i am running DD without sensor wires?

anyway, how can i take speed up to 16mph? i dont need anything fancy to run crazy 40mph. 16mph is my limit.

Yes by upgrading to a different esc requires a new remote indeed 

What kind of battery do you use a meepo 10s2p?
U might want to go bigger on the battery too

I can recommend flipsky

i am reading more on ESC now. this is the one to get?  https://buildkitboards.com/products/dual-fsesc-4-20-plus#
how about receiver? i hope i can at least keep the old meepo remote  lol.  this hobby is getting expensive.
i cant find any specs for the meepo v1 so i dont know what battery it uses.

Take a look on this website https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/mini-fsesc4-20-50a-base-on-vesc-widely-used-in-eskateboard-escooter-ebike
You could combine 2 of them together or somthing different depends on what you wana achieve with your build you wont be able to use the meepo remote with different esc to my knowledge

i cant believe $160 is the cheapest dual vesc money can buy. https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products
as i dont need to go crazy fast, i was really hoping for something in the $90 range for 15mph speed, not 30+ mph
