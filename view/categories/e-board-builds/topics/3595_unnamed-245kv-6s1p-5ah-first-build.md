Hello new here and looking for some help and info. I have brought a drop through board to use as my base. I have several rc so already have a controller and esc 80a 1/8 buggy one. But I ordered a belt which has arrived 265t 9mm belt also I ordered a motor but think I have ordered the wrong one as seen people say sk3 so got one but think I have got the wrong kv as its a 2836-2500kv is this completely wrong? Will it even work or should I just send it back and get another one. Thanks in advance.

Unfortunately wrong. You should buy a motor below 300kv and maybe even below 200kv for good torque!

Thanks after I ordered it I though I had got it wrong will send back and get the 260kv one. As for batteries is two 3s 6000mah OK. Thanks sorry for the noob questions.

Hello everyone need to all this and hope to learn a lot quickly. Have been reading some of the pinned posts and have started to buy bits. I have the board just a cheap one to start with of Ebay. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f5726a6232852202c566aed23ae94c04ecb5e72e.jpeg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f5c0260e49bf1f55688c557e61e6b1f8e9cc3973.jpeg" width="281" height="500">
 
I'm planning on getting 2x3s 6000mah batteries along with sk3 motor either 5055 280kv or 6364 sk3 245kv. I hope to bring more pictures soon once I start to design the motor mount using my 3D printer.

Stay with a 63mm motor is my suggestion if you had to choose. I've had a few ntm 50/60 and they can't handle the heat after a while and the stator will come loose even when your switch out all the grub nuts with bolts.

Also review this mate

If you don't see it here I would suggest to avoid it mate (edit: later on you can discover other non popular ESCs ... Look for ones for RC car....pay attention to the voltage ratings)

Would that be a half decent gear ratio to have not to much strain no the motor.

Hope u aren't planning to print a motor pulley too as I don't think that works 

What charger u using?  How many in series?

I think just 6s you said. Just put them all in series and keep them that way and use an xt90s plug and a 15$ balancer/discharger. That's what I'd do.

Yes I want to wire in series I have some 4mm bullet connectors to join them together then a deans for the main charging/connector to the esc. So 3x2s batteries in series I know how to wire the main ones but how would I join the balance leads. As for the motor pinion I have ordered a aluminium 15t but if it down arrive in time I will print one to get it tested.

U can't join the balance leads.  
Simplest to me is the two packs in series with one xt90s plug and charge discharge through there bulk charging, and put a 15$ battery medic on each set of 6 balance wires.

I'll try to do pics and some video when we meet.  Get the most eboards in one frame

So this is how I have wired the batteries and was hoping to cut the plugs off and make a custom balance lead out of a second 6s balance lead.

Those are 2s packs I guess.   U can make them into a 6s balance lead and that's the safest easiest thing to do.  Just string them in the order u have them in series.  Otherwise u could put the cells in parallel and balance but that kinda defeats the purpose as u wouldn't be monitoring individual cells, and ud have to disconnect the paralleled cell connections when u put it back in series or you'd be shorting

```
Yea that's what I'm hoping to do but unsure on which wires go where on the balance lead as there is 9 wires and then a 6s lead only has 7 so where do the other two go. Does everyone els get a spark when connecting the batteries to the esc and how could I stop that. Also was thinking of having a second charging deans so I wouldn't have to unplug all the time.
```

---
## \#58 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2016-05-27T20:34:08.572Z Reads: 157

```
If u redo the balance leads and connect them u should have 7 little wires. Think of each cell needing two wires to monitor.  Cells share wires when they can.  Keep them in order determined by ur main series connection.   I've never put wires in a glance plug so don't know how hard that is 

the spark will oxidize ur connectors adding resistance. Some people think that's the worst of it but most people who really know say it will destroy your esc over time. Xt90s plug solve it. 
When u say having a seperate charging plug it seems overly complicated to me...you'd still want to disconnect from the esc anyway when off or charging. 
I think if u bring all ur balance plugs together to use a single 6s plug that's could make things more convenient (I like battery medic-like devices on those)  and use a single xt90s plug to charge and power the board...that seems easiest to use

Was thinking about having a kill switch on the + wire before esc but after the first connector so I can switch of the esc and have an extra connector to charge meaning I done have to disconnect every time I charge.

But by charging it on a cheaper old charger without a balance port it has got some life back in it.

So some more updates on the board and my prototype mount seems to be spot on and holding even though it's plastic but an aluminium version will get made once this one is tested.

Some more updates. I have now printed an esc enclosure to screw to the base of the board to make it neater and some protection.

Also I seen on here someone making a charging socket out of a 15pin vga plug so I went and brought two blanks and made a start on a charging plug for my 6s lipo.

haha does make prototyping easy and also making the wheel pulley so make some bits a little cheaper. but things like cases and housings are perfect to make in plastic. have been looking at carbon fibre as well so maybe once i have finished everything might coat with carbon for a nice factory look like the new evolve board.

There is a 100 a version of this.
Could definitely be done, but i think it would not be that useful.
you could use something like that to measure it once.
The current should not change over time so having it permanently hooked up would have no real advantage

Well, i would not say that. The description says:
- Remaining power of the real capacity
- Charging and discharging time remaining time

These two functions are very useful!

So getting there now just need some new holes in the motor plate to get me some movement to tension the belt properly. Then make a short cable from xt90 to deans as this will me moly main cut of from batter and anti spark for now and then wire the balance leads to my charging system. Once that's all done can then make a box to go over my batteries and hold them in place as also brough some t-bolts to help keep it all neet.

So that's the charging port all wired with balance leads all connected just need to finish the other side. Also with this it now make the whole battery pack removable which mean I can charge away from my board just now new to figure out best way to make a box with easy access but still low profile.

So after 6miles of riding a few problems have arisen but have now been fixed. So that's one charge on these batteries and 6miles so I'm pleased with that and with a top speed sofar of 17mph but still more throttle left so I think my goal of 20mph should be realistic. 

The only thing I'm now thinking about is waterproofing. What do people do to help waterproofing. Battery is in a lipo bag and in a half sealed box but it's the esc, rx and the motor that I'm. Concerned about. Are the motors ok in the wet not being a sensored one I can see any problems but I could be wrong. Any help with this would be great.

Correct, sensorless motors are waterproof.

I would recommend rubber gaskets and a ABS enclosure to put everything in. Seal every opening.

Was after some help as to why my motor would make different noises because I changed the timing. So what I found was under heavy acceleration it would cut out briefly then carry on which I guessed was hitting the over current. So I lowered the initial throttle to help accelerating but also lowered the timing from normal to low to see if that would stop the cutting out but now instead of cutting it make a deep groning noise. Is this safe or will I cause some damage should I change the timing back to normal. My esc is a goolrc 80a with 245kv running 6s.
