Here is my Boosted V2. I waited 6 months for this damn thing and I thought it would be everything I could ever want in an electric skateboard. I was wrong. The Boosted board is a polished product and a legit company but riding up hills I could drain the battery in 15 minutes and I felt I needed a bit more top speed. In short I felt that it wasn't worth the 1600 dollars I paid for it and upon discovering this forum I found that what I wanted was possible with a DIY board. I wanted to accomplish three things with my build
1. to never worry about running out of battery
2. to achieve about 30mph top speed
3. to have something with a kick tail so I can kick it up and pivot around tight corners (could not do this with loaded vanguard deck on the boosted)

I set out on my journey not knowing what the hell I am doing and ordered the following list of parts 
Dual Mech Kit	$299.99	diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-dual-motor-mechanical-kit/	
6355 190KV * $90ea	$180.00	diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv/	
2.4ghz Mini Remote	$60.00	diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller/	
VESC * $99.99/ea	$198.00	diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/	
VESC XT90 Parallel	$8.99	diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/	
VESC Canbus	$6.99	diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-canbus-connector/	
VESC Male to Male	$1.99	diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/male-male-servo-connector/	

If your new to diy electric skateboarding like me I highly recommend ordering through @torqueboards they are almost always on online chat to answer any questions and dexter and his crew are super helpful 

The only thing I needed to figure out was getting a battery and my man @barajabali was up to the task. Since I wanted the most range possible I went all out and ordered a 12s7p to ensure long epic rides.

The 12s7p BEAST!!!!! 

After that photo was taken I still didn't know what the hell I was doing but I realized I still needed to figure out an enclosure. I got cocky and figured out since this DIY im going to make my own. I bought some fiberglass sheets and Bondo from the hardware store and what happened next was traumatizing. My advice starting off is don't work with Bondo. Period. It is actually terrible to work with and if you don't pass out from the fumes your probably going to be pissed off with how shitty of a job you did. Or at least that was my experience. So after about six hours of effort and vacuum packing the thing

 I ended up with a dried booger from outer space. Thats when I hit up @psychotiller for a custom enclosure which is what I should have done in the first place. I initially botched the dimensions and he was nice enough to fix it for me what a nice guy!

the next challenge was figuring out how to get everything to fit......
After kinda throwing everything together time for a test ride!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/b/3ba999d472aa8a563a160924614cb7da7dbe9273.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I am blown away by the amount of epic torque and speed. It exceeded all my expectations and I was honestly almost crying how awesome it is. 

Not sure how accurate my iphone gps is but I came up with the following results from my first couple of rides
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/d/dd379080be6045038da7222cc562cc9955d6df48.PNG" width="281" height="500">

These results might be a little off but I legit think this board does 35mph no problem. And as far as the battery goes it really is an unlimited battery. The thing that pissed me off about the Boosted is I wanted to just keep riding the damn thing but I always had to turn back. I'm convinced if you were on the flats taking it easy you could get 40 miles no problem which I love! After all this awesomeness I do have the board currently sidelined as I am dealing with an intermittent issue  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVntPJafk5wI really think its a faulty receiver/remote and hope to have it fixed soon. I did start another thread on this but if anyone has any other ideas let me know cant wait to get the board back on the road!

12S7P is beast.. Amazing you fit everything in there.. How much does your board weigh? pack weigh?

Video is wrong URL btw. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVntPJafk5w

As far as what's wrong with it.. I'm not too sure. Possibly, check the wiring make sure everything is plugged in and "soldered" properly if you did any custom soldering which you probably shouldn't have had too though.

Maybe check your VESC settings and/or try pairing the remote again.

Definitely shouldn't be doing that though.

Let me know if it's something on our end and we'll get you riding again.

Haha your motors sound like they're haunted. You should plug it in the VESC and see what's going on with the PPM values in BLDC tool. Most likely just a faulty remote/receiver though.

If you want to prolong the life of those phase wires you should rotate the motor on the mount 180 degrees.

@torqueboards also curious about weight as that's 8 pounds of batteries alone!

@torqueboards I have to admit the board is HEAVY. I dont have a working scale but I'm going to guess maybe 30lbs?? def not a commuter board thats my next build. I didn't do any custom soldering I should have another remote coming soon to test I'll keep you in the loop!

Check in ppm tab the pulsewidth when you enable the Display checkbox. I am very sure that the Problem comes from there. You are the third one in a week who has those issues. Not sure if the other guys use also a Mini remote. Normally they are very reliable. Could be that they made a bad batch.
I have 3 and one of mine also had issues with the potentiometer. What you can try is to turn the poti completely to one side and Do the binding process again. This way I fixed my issue because then I got a stable Signal which didn't gitter anymore.

My Boosted 2 hardly gets ridden but I really like the way it looks and feels and it's fast enough with that much flex, I'll probably ride it more when I finally get that "extended" battery, it's current range won't get me anywhere AND back home so there's no point really using it. I don't really have a DIY anymore (unless you count the Raptor 1 rebuild) I sold my DIY in preparation for the CarvOn V3 which will be in a Raptor 1 deck as well sucks that I'm restricted to a 10s3p because of the available space

i agree the bottom line is that the battery life on the boosted is simply not worth it for 1600 bucks if the battery life was in the 15-20 mile range I would have kept it and i guess the extended battery wont be available for another six months

I am having the same issue with my nano remote from torqueboards, just stopped working.  I can't get anything to show up for the pulsewidth, ordered another receiver and am hoping that will work.

My ppm pulse width seems to be fine. I am hoping it is just the remote/receiver causing the issue. I replicated the issue on the bench and i disconnected the receiver from the vesc as it was doing it and it stopped doing the weird motor dance which does point to it being the remote/receiver

Have you adjusted the throttle trim on your remote? That could cause it to always be on if set incorrectly, I think. I believe the right one is throttle and should be set at about 2 o'clock.

It might be vesc settings if you can't find a sweet spot with trim,upload screenshot's of your settings you'd be suprised what you miss sometimes.

Just simply turn the throttle potentiometer completely to one side. Then adjust the pulsewith in the VESC settings again. That fixed the issue for mine because the poti stopped giving false signals. If it doesn't work try the other side as well. You also might set a very tight deadband which results in a constant on off by the signal.

Is the potentiometer the throttle trim knob on the mini remote thats supposed to be at the 2oclock position?

Forget the 2 o'clock position. That is only that it is close to 1.50 when it is in idle. But you can adjust it in the VESC settings. So it doesn't matter if your idle is at 1.30 or 1.70.

Awesome build and the range on that thing is incredible! But yeah 30 pounds is heavy, not sure what mine ways but somewhere near 15 or 20, boosted is nice and light but for $1600 come on. Also you said you were trying to make a fiberglass enclosure and you said "if you dont pass out from the fumes"  does that mean you weren't wearing a VOC respirator? Cause you REALLY should be. Resin fumes are pretty toxic as well the small particulate of the fiberglass that can get in the air. You'll be fine just doing it that once, but form now on a recommend everybody uses a VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) respirator to stay safe.  Anyways great board and good luck getting it working!

Update- turns out the weird motor dance was due to a faulty remote/receiver. Thanks to @psychotiller I now have a working one.  I ended up breaking one of my 6355 motors so the only rational thing to do was to buy @torqueboards 218mm trucks and dual 6374 motors for scientific purposes. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7d88edb3c1237bb490907b37a6a9bc2cee0240ba.JPG" width="666" height="500"> At first impression the 218mm trucks looked kinda funny to me and I was worried that they would feel weird. Turns out they carve like a champ!

I then went for a longggg test ride. This is why I wanted to build the damn thing in the first place to pull off epic rides . When I got home I still had 60% battery left. Thanks 12s7p! The 6374 motors eat hills alive. The 6355 motors have similar acceleration and top speed but when it comes to hill climbing their is no comparison. Long live the 6374 motors.
