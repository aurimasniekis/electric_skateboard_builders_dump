It is about damn time. I have consumed about a 1000 articles, builds and youtube videos and I am about ready to put one together myself. This board totals right around $830.

you might want a couple of these to monitor your batteries individual cell voltages and help you avoid over discharging.

@ARetardedPillow - I was thinking about doing the spraypainted sandwich container from Target for the enclosure. Probably wont buy it until I have all the parts and know what I need to try and fit in with. 

I am thinking about trying to create the XT90 Y connectors myself instead of ordering them from China. Probably need to think through it a bit more though. 

Thanks for commenting!

@Sampreston I have a Loop Key Set which I haven't listed yet but it uses 4mm HXT battery connectors not XT90. Might interest you as you won't need to buy any soldering irons, wires, etc.

This is how everybody should be approaching their first builds. Good foundation of knowledge, researched first.

But yeh I +1 the focbox. With single drive you want a good esc

My single drive build totalled to $890 or something

Hey Sam, seems like you did your research! Good job! I always love it when people read for a few days before posting a build thread :smiley:

Speaking of that, I have some flywheel “clones” for sale, but they aren’t like all of the other available. The reviews they have are great and people say they ride almost as good as genuine flywheels.

I also have some other parts available if you are interested. Let me know if you have any questions!

haha - I am trying to balance keeping the cost down, but also want to put the best items on the board. It is hard to think through that the more expensive option is actually the more cost-effective option.

[/quote]

The Vesc monitors total voltage, not individual cells. 
So a discharge  bms or Lipo voltage alarm provides a higher level of protection

well, do you really think the cells will drift that much? 

i'd say a wide cutoff with 0.2V would be enough

Well, my cutoffs will not be near the edge I'm thinking 3.75v Full cut off.
Would that work? My sells are zippy flightmax, not top class.

## \#25 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2018-04-02T17:06:55.175Z Reads: 91

```
That is a very conservative cutoff. 
You’ll probably be fine with that. 
Individual cell monitoring allows you to go lower on your cutoff. 
And it is added protection Incase one pack discharges faster or sags more than the other.

@Drifter89 @b264  

I got rid of my car payment, insurance, gas, and parking costs (roughly $600/month) and replaced it with a monthly train tickets ($20/m) and this e-board build ($900). 

Not a bad trade.

[/quote]

I was also going to suggest this, I think its a must with lipo usage. Below 3.5v the voltage drops of a cliff and you can easily kill a pack if one cell goes low.

That is true with Lipos. They fall off quickly on the lower end.

lol dude, relax. you seem like these vegan guys who must say to everyone how bad meat eating is.

dont call people an idiot for using cars, since you dont know how long they need to drive for work or else. you seem too aggressive for me in this discussion, not bringing the arguments rather than insults.

Do what you do. But when the weather turns to crap, e boards don't cut it. I think its a bad idea to sub one out for a car. Relax jack, I'm not trying to be an a-hole, Its a fun pastime. Don't be so up-tight. The kids will be just fine.

this is a pretty nice thing i have to say. you can save a lot. but what about winter and rain? you need to make things waterproof, like, real waterproof. when doing the housing, think about that.
