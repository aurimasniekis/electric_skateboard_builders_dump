Letting buddies ride my boards is a slippery slope....been asked to build 2 boards...decided to do them as twins - the same but with some cosmetic differences.

All parts either here or coming:

2 Caldera boards from @treenutter
4 6374 190kv motors from @torqueboards
2 sets TB 218mm trux and TB mounts
2 sets of @psychotiller Six Shooters
2 CF enclosures from @MasterCho (1 blue - 1 Black)
4 Ollin ESCs from @chaka
2 10s4p batteries from @barajabali 
2 Alienpower controllers

Boards in progress:

Couldn't resist a mock up with the 218...6374s...and mbs wheels...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/4/248c44accc3bf9f09f7906d0ca2c76c127dcb066.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Duuuude these look sick! 
A quick question
1. 2x 6374 motors fits on the TB 218mm trux with 12mm belt drive with no problem?
```

The wheel pulley in the pic is @Titoxd10001 15mm....plenty of room to adjust with moving clamps and using spacers on axles....in the pic I just put 2 wheel bearings on each axle to space out....lots of flexibilty...


These will be running @psychotiller 6 shooters when they get here with 12mm belts...

What mounts are these? I have the tb mounts but the clamps are to small for the trucks.

Unfortunately the chat attendant on @torqueboards website told me the regular clamps would work. Now I'm having to wait for a response from Dexter about getting clamps.

There's a little ridge on flat side of the TB hanger. it makes it not flat. Thats the only reason your clamp doesnt work. It would be really easy to flatten out that ridge with a dremel or file.

Holy shit :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: this is gunna be so sick!  I actually saw your decks being made as I chat with @treenutter on IG pretty often.  It's good to know that those decks are in good hands.  Man, great vision and part choices.  Did you make the carbon fiber enclosures your self?  Can't wait to see them done.
