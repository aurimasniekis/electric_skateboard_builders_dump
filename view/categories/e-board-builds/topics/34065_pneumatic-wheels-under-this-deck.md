Hey guys,

I am riding with a board of this shape:

https://cdn.idealo.com/folder/Product/4737/8/4737802/s1_produktbild_gross/long-island-longboards-spot.png

I am wondering if there is any chance I could fit some pneumatic wheels on a deck like that, or am I gonna have to switch decks?

It has slight cut-outs for more turning space and I currently fit 83mm wheels.

Cheers!

You'll need to switch decks I'm afraid. You'll end up with terrible wheel bit even if you use massive risers....

Unless you got some like 4 inch risers it would not be possible, and even then, you would still get wheelbite.

Pneumatics on a pintail cruiser... that would be a sight to see ðŸ˜‚

You could actually use pneumatics, you would just need to get some super wide trucks!! And I don't think that would look very good) 

You could call Evolve for the GTX deck. They sell them pre gripped for $120!

Would i need new trucks as well or do i just need the â€žtop plateâ€œ which mounts on top?

You should look at @treenutter drop decks, incredibly lush and perfect for numies.
