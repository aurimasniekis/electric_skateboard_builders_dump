Started buying parts this weekend, deck trucks and wheels as parts list says, also ordered a spot welder sunkko 709a from banggood, and 50pc Samsung 18650 30q cells from local supplier. all tips on making a battery is appreciated, I plan on using the stimm pack from this forum as a layout

Deck, wheels, trucks and 18650s arrived, batteries much larger than expected, see std AA battery under the left row of 18650s
Thinking of ordering 2 more 30Qs and do 13s4p, but not sure yet, due to limitations on the ordered Focbox dual. 
Sunkko 709a spot welder coming June 6th. Wich nickel strips fish papers, tape and other battery related stuff should I order. 
Also need tip on the best 6355 motors as I am to order 2 of those, including pulleys and belts, brackets and mounts.
Also tip on enclosure is needed

I live in Norway (EU)

13s4p on an Icarus?, that's a bad idea the enclosure will be too big and this will create cracks on your battery very soon, a crack is very dangerours as it may lead to fire.

If you want a 13s4p I suggest you get a different deck

Precision trucks with split angles and good bushings/cups will be stable at speed but have a small turning radius.  The deck will not be responsive at that speed though, it will lose control because it will flex enough under stress of speed to turn on its own

Yes but they have a very linear turn, not good to carve with.  You could get Paris IIs and they carve decently with cones, but they won't pass low 30s before they buck you off

Kydex is a thermoform plastic. comes as a flat sheet. You use wood to form a mold. Then throw the Kydex in the oven so it becomes soft like a blanket. Lay it over the form. adjust some edges. Once it cools, it hardens and becomes much like plastic. 
I recommend Kydex T, (on amazon just not prime) since it passes various fire tests. The Plastics 2000 stuff is basically scraps that the company can't sell to manufactures.

It looks like a good way to get sleek enclosures. But it also requires some skill to make it look good. This video makes it look less good. The professionals use vacuum to get clean edges. I have yet to actually form mine.

Kydex T is subjected to UL standart 942, this test is just to describe its flamability.
Under this test it receives a V-0, 5V 3 rating. 
This basically amounts to the fact that it will self extinguish after a given period of time. Not sure on the exact time, but it amounts to less than 60s of flame given a vertical test piece. The UL standard also rates how many drops of plastic fall from the piece and yadda yadda. Industry standards make for fantastic late night reading

![image|559x118](upload://lWtWiBQQVMKg5kBMTWYpBejnRo.png)

EDIT: This is actually the difference between the T and the plastics 2000 stuff. The cheaper plastics 2000 stuff is does not undergo any tests. so theoretically it could continue to burn on its own more so than the T

That and I want to build my own DIY style ;)

Have you built a battery before ? Reading your posts it would seem not. Maybe look at a prebuilt battery pack and enclosure combo. If you're only going to have one board then building your own, and making the inevitable mistakes along the way, could easily become more expensive than just buying one from an expert builder / professional. Then you can just concentrate on building your board. There's no shame in not welding your own batteries. Plus it's potentially safer for you and your home/family members.

Yes, but since I live in Norway, shipping those prebuilt batteries is superexpensive. Besides I like a challenge, being a process engineer i am used to learning complex tasks and being careful and patient. I also have a friend who is en electrical engineer that can help me if I need. Gonna follow all threads here I can fiend and build accordingly. Use glasses and rubber gloves.

I'm the wrong guy to speak to about building batteries ! Never done one as I only have a couple of boards - didn't seem worth investing in all the equipment needed, plus in the UK the packs are very good value (sorry about that ..... I know how ridiculous Norway Taxes can be !).

Plenty of expert battery guys on here. Maybe ask in a dedicated thread so your questions get more notice :-) 

The motors you posted will be OK, higher torque than 190kv, but lower top end speed. 190 is a good all rounder. I have dual 6374 190kv and never feel like I need more power !

I use TB 218mm trucks which are fairly standard issue for the larger motors. Not familiar with the ones you posted I'm afraid. Bushing setup will largely depend on how heavy you are and the style of riding you're after. Stiff for heavy / speed blasting, mid/soft for light/carving. Best to have a selection anyway so you can find the sweetspot that suits you.

## \#67 Posted by: ZachTetra Posted at: 2019-05-24T16:03:40.677Z Reads: 131

```
I'm gonna level honest here, I've never used either of them before.  I'm just reciting what I heard elsewhere on the thread, supposedly the split TKP are some of the highest quality trucks you can get but then again TB218s are very common and people say good things about them.  It is certainly easier to use the TB218s since lots of products are made for them but they are also not meant to carve.

Also the APS 63100 was just to show that those trucks were absolutely massive, I don't actually  recommend them

At the end of the day, just make sure you can get enjoyment out of what you make and that it was worth the money, you don't need a perfect build off the bat

While waiting for the spot welder (coming 6th of June a Sunkko 709a) can I glue pairs of 4 together with positives facing same side without Barley paper in between ? Or wait until I get barley paper and kapton tape ?

Thats what I researched just doing control questions to make sure I understood it correctly. Please don't pin me down for poor research, I have studied this for like a year now, and bought a prebuilt Ownboard for this season because I wasn't ready for the task at hand. So then I am going ahead with the plan of gluing pairs of 4 together, wrapping them in fish paper afterwards

Thank you for the thread you posted, but since he is using a clear silicone type, clearly with much higher viscosity (u can look that up if you cant grasp the concept). His silicone is dripping into the cracks between the cells. As the Silicone I used that can handle temperatures up to 300 degrees Celsius has a much lower viscosity and had to be pushed down the crack to glue together ( and yes I might have overdone it, but better they stick together than fall apart) Does it really matter though ? Other than not looking as good as the clear silicone pics u uploaded (cause I would've used hot glue, and that be worse wouldn't it) So if I made a mistake, and have to pull the cells apart, please advise. Other then that, shut the f... up and leave my forum thread u f.....looser

the amount of silicon you put in will start to insulate the cells, which is bad

but also 300c silicon is not needed... cause the absolute max a 18650 can reach is 90c (90c is extreme) any natural cure window silicon would work fine like GE silicon 2+

You're missing a Full face helmet, knee pads, elbow and the rest of safety equipment to save your ass.

In all honesty I have to question your 13s build.  I think you should be swimming in the 6ft end, instead of trying a go at cliff diving.

As for your equipment, it is fine. Of course their are better options but that's all you really need. Also, look for bushings for tb218. Riptide bushings.... there is a thread dedicated to it.  What size wheel pulley are you getting?  What remote?  Are you getting a BT module?  Why didnt you get 107s or 110s since your going for speed? 

Lastly go over again on the thread posted earlier
 https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/please-review-my-battery-pack-so-i-dont-make-a/70102

You will need the expertise of the builders from this thread.

Haha, Yeah i have all the safety Equipment inhouse, i always wear a helmet. I dont know i just thought everyone is building 12s and i thougth why not 13, i might reduce topspeed in focbox settings if its to fast. I didnt want to go to high over ground, since i ride regular skateboard alot With 53mm Wheels. i wanted to keep the feeling of not getting to high over ground, and also my el-skate for now has 83mm Wheels.
 i know about riptide bushings, will check them out, thank you, i want some possibillity for carving but not for speed wobbles. 
I bought the set from DIY so its 16/36 , i have an ownboard Remote spare and i ordered a nano x With the focbox coming as soon as their delay is over. Not sure if i need the BT module, for battery pack i ordered a bestech D140 13s BMS

IMO... I hate the Nano X.  Really can't stand it as I have had a few drop outs while using it.  It is stuck in my shit pile at the moment.  In terms of less expensive reliable options, Mini Remote, Maytech v2 and Benchwheel remote are my budget favs.  In terms of higher quality, you have Hoyt.  

Here is an article to better explain
http:///esk8-remotes-garbage-or-greatness/

What helmet by chance do you have?  Hopefully full face since you are planning on going over 30s.  You do know you only need a 10s build with the right gearing to get to that speed right?  12s easily puts you into 30mph range.  The 13s guys here are absolute speed demons that usually run LY EVO decks.  Hell I have a 12s build that does 40mph.  I rather have the range to go with the speed.  Also, my current setup has switched from going high speeds to more torque.  It now is more satisfying having the ample pull up any incline with the sudden surge of torque.  I have toned down the high speeds to 30-35mph now a days.  Seems to be plenty fast.

I dont think i ever will wear a full face helmet. Look at Bicycle riders in tour de france and other races, they ride over 100 km/h with that egg of a helmet excuse. 
Its not that i plan on riding that fast, but i like the idea of having enough Power to maybe full throttle for a split second or two just to get the adrenaline going.
I think torque will be ok With the two 6374`s. I only weigh around 65kg.
As i also mentioned, i too might tone it Down in the focbox settings, i might even build a 12s4p not connecting the last plus cable from BMS.
About the Remote Control i appreciate the feedback. I really like the thumb operation , and not the first finger operation so i will definetely check out options, thanks for taking time to respond.

Bad example with bicycle riders.   They don't have electronics that can fail and make you imitate superman down the asphalt.

Let me bring you into the light of DIY. You are rolling down the road at around 65kph, in a nice tuck position, nothing feels wrong, everything feels great.  Out of nowhere, your anti spark fails/remote signal drop/erpm limitation is met, which now without warning sends you flying off your board.  Unlike a speed wobble, you aren't going to have time to react.  It is damn you running full speed down the street and your shoes laces come untied.  As you are in full stride you step on your lace and fly face first into the ground.  That is the dangers of DIY esk8.  Sometimes shit like this happens, therefore you do you absolute best to protect yourself for all possibilities.  

You need to think of downhill skaters with the addition of electronics.  I know for a fact if you take a look around and see the stories of broken bones and sadly even death that can come from these machines.... you will understand why the majority of us stress full face.  Do you have to do so? Hell no.. your skull, your body, you do what you want.  I am just giving fair warning as you are new to the DIY world.  Shit is serious with the speeds you will reach with the type of build you are planning.

It isn't about full on brake.  Hell have you ever ridden a belt driven board?  Have you ever let off as a beginner and felt the surge forward you experience from your body weight shifting.  Yeah imagine that at 30mph in a tuck position.

Yes i see your point in being thrown of the Board due to a number of reasons like not being able to see a large rock due to sun in your eyes and stuff like that. Some driver pulling out unexpectedly, all sorts of stuff can happen. 
But the moment you put on a full face helmet your also attracting unwanted attention, to you Electric skateboard wich is an illegal vehicle even at low speeds.
Not happening, i would much rather put som limitations on top speed on the esc.

full face helmet + dark visor

[quote="marioflatini, post:145, topic:94074"]
But the moment you put on a full face helmet your also attracting unwanted attention, to you Electric skateboard wich is an illegal vehicle even at low speeds

you know the sound of belt drives attracts more attention than a full face helmet.

Chill?!?! For what... what did I say in which you think I was not relax in my words.

Did I say you can't skate, run, jump, smack old ladies.  No, as I said, I don't care if you wear it.  I am just telling things that happen when entering the world of DIY.  Shit I rode skateboards for years... that doesn't mean anything.  Skateboarding doesn't help you when you have electronic failure, so that point is moot.  If I was at the very least talking about speed wobbles, than your experience ....well in downhill will be more credible, but I digress.


Also, you have a W2 boosted clone.. The torque is minimal in comparison to an overpriced boosted, and it is another cheap clone you could of built from a DIYE kit.  You are building a 63mm dual belt driven board with a 13s battery, LOL!  That shit is apples and oranges compared to a Ownboard w2.

[quote="marioflatini, post:142, topic:94074, full:true"]
I hear ya mate, thanks for the fair warning, those cases described, have they actually happened or ar those imaginary ? I thought motors never brake if a signal failure or lost comm ?
[/quote]

You are the one thinking I am saying imaginary shit.  Documented issues that have happened.  Multiple broken bones by those that skate downhill or park.  This shit aint the same, nowhere near it.  And you are new to this talking about a 13s build and started with a ICARUS deck wanting 30mph.  Your research was limited, even though you said you had done it for a year.  Your research would of found that nobody used Loaded Icarus decks for speed.  

Again, I am not talking about most things that can be avoided.  I am talking electronic failures in which you have NO IDEA of anything happening.  When in traffic on the road, you are aware of cars.  On crap roads or any asphalt you are scanning ahead to see what is in front of you.  BUT you aren't going to be aware of an electronic failure until it happens.  If you want to learn more, please research it.  This isn't new or "imaginary".  

Again, wear it...don't wear it, that is your choice.  I gave my opinions on things you might need or look into in terms of build equipment.  I pray you pay a lot of attention in that battery building thread.

Already told u dude, not wearing the full face helmet.
But might settle for 12s.
Luckily I have a friend that goes first on the battery, and I am reading battery related post everyday. Problem is no one can say what the best solution is, everybody has an opinion and you can't separate the expert from the n00b.
I asked for examples of electronic failures that ended in a bad crash, do you have specifics ?

As I said, I could care less if your ass wears a helmet or not... Go with no damn helmet, be free, be happy.

You serious, I told you a thread.  Go read it.  FOCBOX Unity.  Read, after that...read some more.  
 I even know the name of the user, but no need to post it because IT IS IN THERE.  It is not my responsibility to spoon feed you this information.  It is you doing your due diligence in reading everything you can before starting to build.  I even said, I had an issue with electronic failure.  

Actually there is one involving the Unity about a month ago.  Also, there is a very easy word to type in search to get some results...

As for the battery thread, I can't help you.  It is rather obvious what the best practices are for building Li-ion packs.  Hell again, a simple search on terms like... "battery" "battery build" can net you easy results.  Lack or research as is shown throughout this thread.  There is no way you spent a year researching DIY.  If you were here on these forums reading for a year you would have plenty of examples of ...

Battery builds,
12s/13s builds
Crashes with electronic failures
anti spark failures
Unity thread
Icarus deck builds
Thinking a 13s build could work on an Icarus Deck.

Seriously, you haven't done research.  That's fine. You can say you have, but all the questions and uncertainty in this thread shows it.

You trolling dude, If you want to help me, come with good suggestions and post threads and links that are relevant to me and my learning like you started out to do. 
What are your builds for instance, what is your background?

Jesus dude.. I gave suggestions already. Trolling, you fucking kidding. Man just do some research. 

I didnt make topics I just read for a long time. Enough to get all the basics you seem to be missing.

5 different builds. The ones I ride are dual 6374 ESCape 40mph build, a hub commuter that I'm working on...a e-mtb in the works, a dual 6355 maytech, low rider.  

You didnt read a damn thing Ive said.  I pointed you in the right direction. Posted the name of the thread. Do i need to take you by the hand and show you every post. I already posted a link about the remotes. Gave my suggestions on some equipment and opinion on others. 

Stop bullshiting here and build your board. Post some pics, ask some real questions instead of questioning everything that is suggested.

Started on the battery, fishpaper around Pgroups stuck kinda bad, so put som Kepten tape around too, still not certain wether to fuse or not.
And still not decided yet on 12 or 13s.
I probably will change out to smaller softer wheels to keep board and feel low, without the drop down board.

Completed spot welding last night, but when I started to solder on double wires for series connection I could not get the solder to stick on the nickel strip. Tips for getting the solder to stick would be nice.
Another question is if I need an anti spark plug before the DC charging port ?

anti spark AFTER the charge port other wise you wont be able to charge without it plugged in...

If you want the dual fsesc6.6, I think it works like this at Flipsky:

Either order this one only, it seems to include that functionality on the board itself: https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc6-6-plus-based-on-vesc6

Or you order: https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc6-6-based-upon-vesc6-with-aluminum-heatsink
and get the Switch seperately:https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/antispark-switch-pro-280a

Don't shoot me if I'm wrong though ;-)
