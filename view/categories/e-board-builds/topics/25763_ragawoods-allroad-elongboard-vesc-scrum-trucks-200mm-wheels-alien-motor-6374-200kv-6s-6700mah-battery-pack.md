Really nice! How did you do the wood enclosure? That's actually a good idea, if it does not add too much weight.
Where did you find the motor mount for the scrub trucks? Is it home made?

Nice build, but I have one question, why did you decide to use two different batteries? You must keep them permanently in series correct seeing as they have different Mah?

@ragawoods How thick is that electronics enclosure? It looks thick, but seems to clear the ground pretty nicely. Any issues with clearance?
