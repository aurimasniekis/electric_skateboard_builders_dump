Hey, everyone. A couple years ago, I never would've imagined I would be building an electric skateboard (or even own one), but here I am going full bore into a build. The wheels arrived in the mail yesterday, lots more is arriving today, and more will continue to trickle in over the next few weeks (and beyond). Here's the synopsis.

* Longboard‚ÄîI will construct this myself. Multiple plies of 1/8" Baltic Birch, carbon fiber, Purpleheart veneer on the top and bottom (not my first choice, but it's what the local supplier had), epoxy, vacuum bagged, strips of black grip tape on top, enough for grip, but showing the veneer between strips. The board will have dual cutouts. I'll need to take some measurements after I have all the parts, but I'm leaning towards cutting drop throughs just so I don't plummet to my death if I fall from an excessively towering board. Also, would like the extra stability from being lower. We'll see if that works out.
* Ordered lots of parts from DIY Electric Skateboards‚Äî218mm TorqueBoard trucks, two 6374 motors, two VESCs, the TorqueBoards 2.4GHz remote. I've actually ordered the 3D printed case and all other parts for a DIY Arduino remote ([found on this very site](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-trigger-style-remote-with-telemetry-complete-guide/48231)), but am in kind of a time crunch and so won't build that for a couple months. Besides, I'll have my hands full just building the board, so better to use the factory remote to start out with.
* Wheels‚Äî107mm Abec11 SuperFlys. Got them in the mail yesterday. Holy guacamole they are _huge_! I'm really looking forward to the smooth ride they should provide though.
* Motor mounts are from our very own [Marc](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/complete-drive-system-for-sale-formerly-motor-mount-with-dual-idlers-and-custom-made-cnc-motor-mounts/50738). I'm planning on making some minor modifications to them, but they look like great mounts.
* Batteries‚ÄîI'll be using Sony VTC6 18650 batteries. They're rated at 3Ah and 15 amps continuous, but 30 amps continuous until reaching 80¬∞ Celsius. I'm going to build individual 12S packs joined with multiple strips (4-5?) of pure nickel wire. 10 gauge silicone wires will come out of each pack with 5.5mm bullet connectors on the ends. I'll build up multiple 12S packs each of which will be wrapped in heat shrink tubing so I can just plug 'n' play as many of them as I want. I'll start out with 6, for a 12S6P pack. If I want more juice in the future, I can just build up more packs and plug them in. I would need to build a new cover, though. (Some say that 12S is a bit too high a voltage for a 190KV motor, but the DIYElectricSkateboards.com told me there are many people running their motors on 12S with great success. Also, I know some say you should build up P first, then S. However, there is also the other side who say S, then P, or that it doesn't matter, so that's my choice.)
* No BMS.
* For the bottom cover, I plan on making a mold and vacuum bagging carbon fiber.

Did I leave anything out? Probably, but I'll post more as I get going. I'm also planning on putting videos of the build on YouTube when I'm done.

By the way, my big motivation for building this board is to tow a wagon around at Oshkosh ([one of the biggest aviation events in the world, the entire last week of July](https://www.eaa.org/en/airventure)). I figure I may go 20 miles in a day, or more‚Äîtowing a wagon with my camera gear, drone, lawn chair, umbrella, etc., in it. Should be interesting.

Okay. I don't want anyone merely _reading_ porn. That would be torture. Here are a couple pics. The brown paper contains carbon fiber cloth. The roll on the right is carbon fiber tow. Still waiting on motor mounts, batteries, and various and sundry other items.

Just picked up bearings. The guy at the skateboard shop didn't try to sell me the Bones Ceramics. He sold me ones he uses and likes himself. I couldn't believe how cheap they were ($14). He doesn't know how the company makes money on these, but he really likes them. I have nothing to lose. If I don't like them, I can spend more. However, it's almost a certainty I wouldn't know the difference, as long as they're not junk. And they match!

Zealous bearings (the ones you have) are pretty great in that they are extremely durable and remain quiet even after a lot of use. A majority of DH longboarders in my area ride on Zealous.

I wouldn't fall into the trap of believing more expensive bearings = more speed. In fact I've seen/had ceramic bearings powder up after hitting a significant upset in the road. They're just not worth it.

The [motor mounts](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/complete-drive-system-for-sale-formerly-motor-mount-with-dual-idlers-and-custom-made-cnc-motor-mounts/50738) arrived today. Pretty quick shipping. Less than a week since ordered. I have a few comments.

First, they look solid and seem well designed. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying them. However, there are a couple things that I think are worth mentioning.

First, I'm going to have them anodized. As they come, the finish is not high quality. They're pretty raw. In fact, I would say their appearance isn't professional (not machine work, just finish). In my opinion, they need a fair amount of elbow grease (sanding with multiple grits‚Äîenough to make me sweat) to prepare them for anodizing. No doubt if Marc offered them anodized, the hand prep plus anodizing would increase the cost. I'm sure Marc knows the market and is selling them for what he can.

In this first picture, you can see the difference in finish between how they came and after some cleanup on my part.

![DSC02820|690x460](upload://ceL1Q1U30qT11q1JPPyLJfZehyu.jpg)

Second, when I first handled the mounts, one of the idlers wiggled around a little bit. It felt "soft." I suspected a soft bushing (plastic or rubber) and that's what I found (see picture below). I don't believe that's optimal, but I don't really care that much, because I intend to modify the idlers substantially, although I'm still working out the details. Again, a different kind of bushing would probably cost more, so it's a trade off.

![DSC02823|690x458](upload://6vKcqfLNtXmol1mynWCjhlFoC.JPG)

So, these are just some thoughts, not a serious criticism.

Did some setup with a wheel, motor, belt, motor mount, and truck. Just trying to figure out spacing, if I'll need wheel spacers, and dimensions for my replacement idler pulleys and the bushings/spacers they'll use.

The hubs on the SuperFlys don't allow the bolts to go through correctly, so I had to open up those areas slightly with a drill.
![20180617_163134|281x500](upload://biZdMXjXF9wnXpJmnOyWDemLMJG.jpg)

You can see the misalignment in this photo.
![20180617_163153|281x500](upload://kZAdiZYhueL5MOs8H0yk30yyuPE.jpg)

Everything is in place and adjusted to be square. When I turn the wheel by hand, the belt seems to be in a nice, neutral position. I'm happy with that spacing.
![20180617_174556|281x500](upload://eswdxIo2gzHR1M4NV1QoIbb5COO.jpg)

![20180617_174627|690x388](upload://tEZ31sENgoVXbHn496wPyvZdHA2.jpg)

![20180617_165911|281x500](upload://nJ9irqTu8ihbAo1deceuroLOS95.jpg)

I actually removed a couple more of these washers. I'll turn spacers of precise dimensions on the lathe.
![20180617_171458|690x388](upload://i1KUBSwOk2E8TMR97BvubFAK3zs.jpg)

This is a sneak peek at one of my replacement idler pulleys. Each motor mount will use only one. The bearing is one of the ones that came with the motor mounts and which acted as the idler pulleys themselves. If they turn out to be of poor quality, they'll be easy to replace. There are a few more upgraded components involved which I will show in a subsequent post.

8mm is just a hair under .315". However, a .319" gage pin fits about half way into the bearings that came with the motor mounts. Then it would hang. So, the IDs of these bearings is oversize and of very poor finish. These bearings are junk.
![20180620_202744|690x380](upload://hRmEHybNlldwvgd1U9gcAkpowDj.jpg)

So, I picked up a pack of Bones Reds.
![20180620_202858|690x389](upload://ubNjFnREe5RKQVlVkpp6CAWd6Z9.jpg)

A .315" gage pin wouldn't fit (barely), but a .314" pin fits nicely, just as expected. The bores are very consistent on the Bones bearings. Smooth and precise, unlike the others.
![20180620_202834|690x360](upload://t8gwvfqCjVD3RZ2p1ATsHdnglNL.jpg)

I'm still doing some tuning, but I think my idler is going to work nicely. I'll be using only one per belt. I think two are unnecessary. It will be mounted on the bottom, so as to avoid the force imposed during acceleration.
![20180620_202814|690x398](upload://qH3HDu1yKLXHob6pOrnQL8JAbM8.jpg)

These are the spacers which will go on the axles, used to get the motors moved outboard slightly.
![InnerSpacers|690x483](upload://7f8642ImJLDENWuEJrwQbvV4UaA.jpg)

Here's the first mounting of the new idler and the spacer. I had to open up the slot in the plate for the 6mm bolt of my new idler. Just checking alignment of everything. Although the spacer may seem small, remember that it must come into contact only with the inner bearing race.
![20180620_194238|690x388](upload://bPb9m3ioLhjqoSM15iQMOMityh6.jpg)

Looking pretty good.
![20180620_195751|690x388](upload://7GvRylALkmKjwGFY5oRYXzeVNf7.jpg)

I like it.
![20180620_203110|281x499](upload://77bEDf2mD4RtajBWZlcjMlPfilq.jpg)

Here, you can see that the outer edge of the idler doesn't quite come to the edge of the belt. I'll need to make another bushing/spacer for the idler, with the spacer portion of it being maybe .020" to .030" wider to get better alignment on the belt.
![20180620_195851|281x500](upload://5fdH27HQYy11cQdAXNIESEtbVd6.jpg)

Here's the first bushing/spacer I made for the new idler. The scrapes on the upper part (which is the bushing) are from the bad fit inside one of the old bearings. I need to increase the lateral dimension of the lower part to push the idler out a hair farther to achieve better alignment with the belt.
![BushingSpacer|383x499](upload://z02dWdYA8HfS84K2aCA07ZFq9PT.jpg)

Phase one of the deck, consisting of two layers of carbon fiber tow and three pieces of 1/8" Baltic Birch.
![20180620_204307|281x500](upload://ddjs8umJt6qpeEZEjmdEJHhyVlm.jpg)

Here you can see the 5 layers. Next will be carbon fiber cloth on the outer surfaces followed by wood veneer. Clear coat on top of that.

So, after trying to cut veneer from a board of Purpleheart on my tiny bandsaw, I gave up on that idea. No way it was gonna work. I bought a couple packs of small pieces of Padouk (more along the lines of the wood I wanted, anyway) and will glue them together into sheets for epoxying onto the board. Ideally, I would've gotten a single sheet for each side, but I couldn't find that size and wasn't willing to spring for a 4' x 8' sheet of veneer.

![20180629_084131|690x388](upload://qnOrw48Rsc12CIEQORwY3u6Oz7J.jpg)

The hardware that came with the motor mounts was button head cap screws which use a smaller and shallower head, making them easier to strip and more difficult to get them tight. I'm going to replace them with socket head cap screws which use a larger Allen wrench and have a deeper head.
![20180625_184138|690x422](upload://uiewzdmBs2nsthQUuH2mwX36hNm.jpg)

Done with the core of the layup. Just need to assemble the veneer into sheets large enough to cover the board and do one more vacuum bagging. This board is about 7/16" thick and should be just over 1/2" after the veneer is applied.

Your eyes are not deceiving you! :grinning: This is my first build and I'm going pretty simple (although three layers of plywood, four layers of carbon fiber, and veneer on the surfaces might not really be all that simple). Anyway, I'm not really experienced enough to know what kinds of curves I might want, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with flat. Once I get some experience on the board, I can make a new deck with curves if I want, and just bolt on the trucks and electronics.

I found that ene having just a bit of a "tub concave" helps with controlling the board. Just gives you a little lip on the sides of the board for your toe and heel.

Here's an easy diagram and article about it

But all in all, your build looks solid man! I'm excited to see it all wrapped up!

Making headway on the deck. I'm going to try and make it work as a drop-through with motors inboard. I made the cutouts on the rear of the board extra long to make room for the motors during turns besides the wheels. We'll see if that works. If not, no sweat. I'll just bolt the trucks on the bottom. I'm happy with how it's coming along.

Starting on the battery packs now. I picked up some old laptop batteries from a local computer store for free and practiced soldering nickel strips to those. I'm very glad I practiced and I would highly recommend it if you haven't done this before.

I'm soldering 3 pure nickel strips between batteries, each 8mm x .15mm (that's about 5/16" x .006"). It's pretty beefy and should handle high current nicely. My practice demonstrated that soldering one strip at a time is the way to do it. I wait a bit between iterations so the batteries don't get too warm (i.e., I solder one each on all the connections, then cut more strips, etc., then do another iteration).

I'm aware of the warnings against soldering, but I have never seen any tests demonstrating any ill effects.

I sanded the terminals before starting and I used plenty of flux. I think I'm getting very good flow. Also, as you can see, I added insulators to the positive terminals. I experimented using hot glue between the batteries, but determined it didn't really add much strength. I'll just be gentle with the packs until I have the heat shrink in place.

![20180709_195254|690x388](upload://8fWQHgoISoE0lxOuIhpES7JVgQv.jpg)

I was going to use 10 gauge wire but decided that it would be difficult to make some of the connectors with wire that big, so I'm going to use 12 gauge. I think that'll handle 20 amps continuous, so it should be fine. The batteries I'm using (Sony VTC6) will put out 30 amps up to 80¬∞ C (so temporarily) and 15 amps continuously. I doubt that I'll ever have the guts to drive the board that hard.

Although I didn't use hot glue, I did wrap some high-heat tape around the batteries to keep them tight. I really want to minimize movement between batteries to try and eliminate strain on the nickel strips.
![20180710_154229|690x388](upload://qxrb6fScwbcEX2E41je9kgtVLSy.jpg)

I added some extra tape on top of the negative lead to add some protection against the positive wire wearing through against the sharp soldered wire of the negative lead.
![20180710_154510|690x388](upload://d4P4giTVAACMbPHs9qPZPv46E08.jpg)

Since I commonly do things without thinking (like building a $2,000 skateboard), I've really been trying to be careful as I build my battery packs. In this instance, I stripped the insulation off the positive wire, but left the negative one covered. Oh! Also, I made sure to put the shrink wrap on the wires before soldering! That's definitely something I would typically screw up. Then, I shrunk the tubing. By following these steps carefully, I minimized the chances of shorting out the batteries. One interesting thing: while I was soldering, when I touched the solder to the bare wire, I got a few small sparks on a couple occasions. Turns out the solder was draped across the battery pack! No biggie. I'll just be more careful as I go.
![20180710_154944|690x388](upload://rhYPdam5ztAAkD8zy9aQs1Qiq4q.jpg)

I was a tad sloppy and melted the connector just a bit. I'll work on that.

The slit didn't work out so well.
![20180710_162358|690x435](upload://vdmqw6UsQPvGqv2SzGG4DMJeAfd.jpg)

To fix the slit, I added several pieces of electrician's tape, then added another shorter length of heat shrink. Turned out okay, I think.
![20180710_162949|690x388](upload://wyt5E6HmTJQY3ccfIVZIdeTPSvk.jpg)

![20180710_163023|354x500](upload://wy9uURGf4JefmrMAWxpMuUI350s.jpg)

Considering this is the first battery pack I've ever made, I'm pretty happy with the results. However, I still have 5 more to go and hope to do better on subsequent ones. In summary, this is a 12S pack. When I have all 6, I'll just make a harness and plug them all together to get the 6P. I could easily have fewer or more packs, as desired.

Here is my situation, as I understand it.

I'm using Sony VTC6 batteries. Each can put out 15 amps continuous and has a capacity of 3 amp hours. So, what I just built is a 12S pack, 43.2 volts nominal (3.6 x 12) which can output at 15 amps continuous with a capacity of 3 amp hours. I will build 5 more of those. Then, I will build a harness which will connect all the positives of those packs to one another and all their negatives to one another. I will tap into that harness at some point and add one more connector (probably on one of the ends). That will give me a 12S6P pack, 43.2 volts nominal (or 50.4 volts fully charged or 49.2 @ 4.1 volts per battery).

The final plug will go to a splitter which will feed the 2 VESCs. I will add an additional set of wires coming off that final plug which will go to an XLR connector in the battery cover.

My Cycle Satiator battery charger will plug into that XLR connector. I will set it to charge to around 49.2 - 50 volts and will probably use a current of 3.6 amps. 1C per pack is 3 amps (since each battery is 3 amp hours), so 1C for the whole pack would be 18 amps (3 amp hours x 6 packs). I understand that a good, moderate charge rate is .2C, so that's probably what I'll use (.2C x 18 amps = 3.6 amps).

Okay. Fill me in. Where am I going wrong?

Lithium ion cells need to be balance charged. Using a BMS for charge only is the typical way to do it if you dont want a bms for discharge. Smart chargers with balance leads can be used to but I'll end with that. Others will fill in the voids I've left :wink:

Yep your right, he needs balance leads to keep the cells balanced. 

@birdus sorry to say but you will need to remove the shrink wrap and add balance leads ‚òπÔ∏è

I know it's possible to go balance-less but it is very dangerous and you have to keep check the voltage for over or under discharge which will be difficult with the shrink wrap and you'd need to be able to rebalance the pack when they inevitably fall out of sync.

Basically, for your own peace of mind throw a BMS on there.

That‚Äôs the other problem, it‚Äôs not like he could even check the voltages because it‚Äôs covered in shrink wrap :man_shrugging:

One other issue could be that the negative lead is not shrink wrapped but still in contact with the cell. This is more so a problem if on the anode side of things with the positive lead cuts through the cells shrink wrap and shorts on the cathode but still something that I would personally wrap and shield.

I'm afraid it's not just about adding balance leads. As I understand, you're aiming for 12s6p and the way you want to do it is by building six 12s1p packs (like this one) and wire them in parallel. That won't work for balance charging though. You need to do it the other way around. Build the 1s6p packs first and wire them in series.

You could build it as he is but you'd need 6 packs with their own BMS and then split the charger leads to each of them. That is how I would do it but I agree with you, 12 1s 6p packs with one BMS.

I went to bed, basically the BMS problem was what I was going to get.  I don't use a BMS for my packs.  I have four 3s6p batteries with balance leads.  These I connect to my hobby charger.  That way I still properly balance the cells.  Currently you have no way to balance so it's a hazard in the making.  100% have to balance the cells at some point. The problem with going 1s6p is not balancing. It's the fact you will have 12 connectors under your board which is plenty.![image|375x500](upload://eLsB1ffaaD4BuGWY8K8OwZiPIrN.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://fiBLQQG6rzyLmy9Z78yUgKPdMr6.jpeg)

This is my method which is not typical on this forum but works for what I wanted which is 3s packs I can use on other projects.  

You need to unsolder that pack and go a different route.  It's okay though, a solution isn't far away.

Why would it not work? He would just need to wire all of the balance leads together into one plug... yes it would create a lot of bulk but it‚Äôs definetely possible

Hey, guys.

I just want to thank you all for your input. You did it in a kind way, and I genuinely appreciate your concern. However, as stated in the first post of this thread, I'm not going to use a BMS.

There are two schools of thought regarding a BMS (Battery Murdering System?). First is that it's absolutely critical and you're likely to die a horrible death unless you have one. Second is that if you use brand new, high quality batteries, never charge up to 4.2 volts nor drain past about 3.6 volts, the batteries will stay almost perfectly balanced for many, many cycles.

Over on endless-sphere.com, there are a number of threads with quite a few folks who have gone the second route trouble free. What I'll probably do is just check the voltage on a per-pack basis from time to time. That will give me an idea of battery health and would certainly make it easy to locate a pack with a bad battery in it.

Anyway, I'm going with the second school.

Thanks!
Jay

@birdus I don't use a BMS either. However my batteries have balance leads so I can balance charge.  The method you plan on using is called Russian roulette.  You have 12 batteries and not a single way without tearing your pack apart to check the voltage of each battery.  Since you're not balance charging at all, only charging one battery could be lower than the rest but the pack voltage is correct.  Now when you discharge the pack that low cell goes lower than the rest. It will continue to do so until it dies.  Your pack will still read the correct voltage but one battery is going to take a hit and that creates a fire hazard.  None of us know how long this process will take.  Even if you don't fully charge or discharge the pack it will still happen.  Plus you will have this issue with all the packs you're making. I think most of us would highly recommend you change your pack design.

This is where you are missing the point.  You need to check CELL voltage not pack voltage.

Yes, they can go probably quite a few cycles without balance charging, but the point is after a while it has to be done and you are unable to do that with your current configuration.

Thanks again for the feedback. I'm on a time crunch right now. Trying to get the board done in the next seven days. I'll be using the board daily for the following week (if I can get it done in time). After that, I'll think about how I might be able to change things so I can check cell voltage. Maybe just go back and add leads.

Yes balance leads are good.  Currently you will have a lead on each battery on each pack if you do so.

By the way, if one cell is dead (or dying), how could the pack show the correct voltage? If a single battery is dead, the pack will read only 45.87 volts, whereas it should read 50.4 volts (@ 4.17 volts per battery). Point being, if I charge a pack fully, then test it, if it doesn't show 50.4 volts, then I know I have a problem battery. What am I missing?

Thanks,
Jay

But you said the pack will still read the correct voltage even if I have a bad battery. I'm just trying to understand how that could be the case.

Well initially you said you weren't charging them full.  Another issue with a bad cell is it may read fully charged but the capacity is no where near the other batteries in the pack.

```
If a 12s pack has a bad cell and you charge it up to 50V the other cells will typically be overcharged and 1 will be under. Not to mention you'd want to charge the 12s packs individually, as if a single pack of 12s1p cells hits 50.4V all packs will stop charging. While building cells like this can be handy there is a reason why every battery ever pretty much runs the p groups before the s groups.

I believe your charger will keep charging until it gets the correct voltage, so I will over charge the rest of the good cells untill it reaches 50.4V. Someone feel free to correct me on that.

Okay. Well, like I said, after this trip, I'll think about taking a different approach to the pack. For the moment, I'm going to plow through and get the board done.
