Hi everyone,

So I ordered a wheel pulley from eskating.eu in a 36t format and it's great. It's sadly started to strip apart and the 3D printing is starting to flake away (weird?)

I just ordered a Evolve 38t pulley. Is there going to be much of a difference in the straight line speed? 2 teeth doesn't sound like much, and I'm hoping it wont be much, but I wanted to ask.

My current setup is 15t x 36t, new setup will be 15t x 38t.

Thanks,
Daniel

Itâ€™s a 5.5% decrease in speed and increase in torque.

So based off of the calc.esk8.it calculator it's just over 1mph. Not even worth worrying about!

Thanks!
