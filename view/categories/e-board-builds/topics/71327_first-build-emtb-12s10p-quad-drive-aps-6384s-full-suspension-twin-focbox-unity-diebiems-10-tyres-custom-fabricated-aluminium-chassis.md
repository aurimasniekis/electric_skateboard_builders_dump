Hi EsK8 legends!!!!

Long-time skater, first time builder, first time poster!!

Back story: I am a fabricator/welder by trade and have recently fallen in love with EMTBs after seeing one of the Bajaboard G4Xs!! My background is in Ultra4 buggies and comp trucks/rock crawlers so I have decided to fabricate my own aluminium chassis and build a MONSTER EMTB!!!!

The basis for my build so far is thus..... And PLEASE give guidance, tips, pointers, tell me what you would do different, tell me what I‚Äôm doing well!!

Chassis/board: Custom fabricated aluminium, double wishbone independent suspension. (Almost finished)

Suspension: DNM DV22AR with custom spring rate. 60mm travel. (Already have)

Tyres: 4.10-4 pneumatic. 10‚Äù Mini quad tyres‚Ä¶. Why so big?.... Why not!!! Also I have had these in the garage for a while and figured they would be something different and would be awesome and surely would give me the unofficial title of biggest tyres?? (Already have)

Motors: 4 x Alien Power Systems 6384s 130 kV sensored 10mm shaft 3mm keyway (Ordered)

Battery: 12s10p Li-po 30Ah Custom made 30q pack. Am considering swapping this to LiFePO4 pack as spaces isn‚Äôt an issue at all but would love your thoughts!!

ESC: 2 x FOCBOX Unity (although I am so torn!! I don‚Äôt know if there is anything that would be capable of handling the current I will be drawing!!) Please advise!!!

BMS: DieBieMS. (Considering whether to run a BMS for charge only or not. Please give advice!!) (Ordered)

Drive/gears: 2 Options‚Ä¶ Looking at running 5MHTD pulleys 15T/72T with a custom made constant velocity shaft but am considering chain drive with CV shaft too‚Ä¶. Please help!! I am thinking ill need to be around the 5:1 mark. I think.

The build will be updated with photos as I progress, I have just finished cutting the aluminium for the suspension upper and lower control arms and will weld that component together today. It has similar looking upper suspension brackets to a Bajaboard G4X however the turning principle and construction are different for a few reasons‚Ä¶. 1st being I didn‚Äôt want to just copy a pre-existing design, even though I have no intention to sell these, I am sure there would still be some kind of copywriting concerns if I directly copied!!. 2nd their suspension and turning design is INSANELY complicated!! So far above my engineering level!! Kudos to Bajaboards for that!!

My details:

6‚Äô0‚Äù

105Kgs

What I want in order of my priority‚Ä¶.

1: Reliability (no one wants their board to catch fire long distances from home)

2: Speed!!!! (If it‚Äôs not fast it‚Äôs not worth doing!!)

3: Range!!! (I am hoping to achieve upwards of 40kms range, the more the better!!)

4: Ability to climb hills!! Don‚Äôt have a heap of ‚ÄúSteep‚Äù hills but have some that are a reasonable grade % and are quite long. Think max 15% grade but would like enough torque to conquer 20% grade!!

5: Ability to drive on soft sand and dirt!!

More Photos to come as the build progresses.

Look forward to your feedback!!!

Hey @moon,
I have, I just dont know where to start, I figured Id build the chassis first, and then make some foanm mock ups and ensure clearance is there. I was hoping to enquire with @Nowind @Kug3lis or anyone else who makes gear drives about taking one of their off the shelf products and having it made custom to suit. Just nto sure on their availability to make 1:5 or even 1:6 drive systems customized.
any advice in this area?

Hey Kevin, They are "Guang Li" tyres -_- from china I am sure..... but I believe you can find these on eBay if you search 4.10-4 Tyres. They are surprisingly well balanced however I will still be adding some ABC beads to assist.

Looks amazing!
Gonna build a 4wd for the winter too but mainly from stock parts as I don‚Äôt have the tools and access to all the machines I would need.
I can recommend you to look through this thread 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/4wd-heavy-duty-offroad-monster-board-vesc-c6364-sensored-12s30ah-10kw/20783?u=andy87
Maybe there some helpful information for you too.

What amps you expect to draw that you think two focbox unity‚Äôs will not handle?
I mean, do you already have some experience or log files from similar rides?
I haven‚Äôt seen @Duffman here for a while but I think @rich  can give you some ruff numbers, he kind a push everything to it‚Äôs limits (or over...most talented destroyer here...)

Hey @Andy87,
I have no data at all, I have just been scared by the forums and post of people gear catching fire, I am completely new at Esk8. I am a total noob hahaha. just thought Id give it a crack. I have read a lot that big tyres and hills = huge amps. I just dont know where to start those calculations without trial and error and at $500 a pop for FOCBOX untiy I dont ant to fry anything....

Thanks for the help though!!!  Ill have a look through this thread now!!

You will not fry anything as long as you setup your unity‚Äôs right. 
You know that you can limit your battery current to a value that will not harm your controllers.
Plus you will split the load to 2 unity‚Äôs.
I can imagine that it will be a heavy board and the tires will draw some extra amps but that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue as far as I can say.
Please consider that there is a point where the board isn‚Äôt rideable anymore. Too much torque will through you off üòÖ
For me I can say with a dual set up, and chain drive I can hardly hit 80a yet. With a 4wd i will be more but not double up. I think with 100a per unity you will sit on a rocket that can climb the Mount Everest üòâ

Crazy first build :crazy_face:!

Seems you have some skills to make it happen. 
I have no idea how you plan to mount the drivetrains on 2 moving rods (but tbh also never looked how BAJA does it).

I think sealed gear drive or chains are best. I had belts first but switched to gear drive which I prefer. No debris enters and after a muddy session cleaning of 2 drivetrains takes 10 seconds, with belt drive 15 minutes. There is nothing wrong with belts as long as you ride in dry conditions and catch no small rocks or hit the pulley. But no idea if sand and belt is a good combination.

4x 6384 130kv should give you so much power that you can mount a trailer for your wife (with plenty flowers) and still can enjoy the ride :laughing:

About the Amps, I think sand and loose dirt need a lot, in this video of @Duffman you see 176A max from battery which is really insane   

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxpQMWbrWwg

Compared to my setup with 2x 6374 motors, my battery amp peaks are between 80-100A and the average is 30-60A depending on terrain and speed.

I did some hill climbing tests yesterday (because of new motors) and could climb 21-25¬∞ which is crazy (angle measured with mobile app).

![181908|690x388](upload://yu4hsUVGiUnJvZUZWWVq9JhalSI.jpeg) 

It took only 90A motor amps and 45A battery amps to climb this hill. You need a certain speed to climb this incline, below 5 km/h I loose traction with 2WD. Also startng on this hill isn't possble, burn outs only. 4WD should be better but never tried. 

[quote="Andy87, post:8, topic:71327"]
most talented destroyer here
[/quote]

maybe most stupid rider here :laughing:
Mindless riding is the most fun for me, above a certain speed I try to ride normal to protect myself. The fun started when I had full body armor and lost the fear of falling. BTW drifting 180¬∞ on leaves is very funny with 50% chance of failing.

@rich thanks heaps for the info!! 
I think gear drive or chain reduction drive like in the video you posted might be my best bet... I will finish the chassis and then I‚Äôll check clearances and start planning all that. 
Not exactly sure which drive shafts BajaBoard uses but I was looking at needle universal slip shafts (available from most machine repair suppliers) as the have double uni joints which are great for high speed and are rated for ridiculous torque.
I think your right in that I‚Äôll be able to tow a trailer full of flowers for the wife! Haha she will come around to the idea when she gets to have a go I‚Äôm sure!! 
I look forward to your guidance on future drive options! Thanks again for all the help üëçüëç

When you talk about custom battery do you mean custom made from a battery builder or DIY?

As much as to would love to DIY every part of this build (and I have just bought a book on lithium batteries) I think I might leave the battery to someone with experience and a decent spot welder. I will probably do battery/BMS last. I know I want 12s (I think -_-) just have to work out what 12s hahah but I definitely think a professional battery builder will take that part... what do you think?
And the shafts.... some like these....![image|500x500](upload://sQzMvHkxEKiS3oRMYSnH6bm1ALh.jpeg)

I'm also in Australia. From what I know, there are two battery builders based in Australia that are on this forum. @TinnieSinker and @Marsen. I had a battery pack built for my board (12s4p) by @Marsen and cannot recommend him highly enough. A good guy with great, honest service and advice. I've also heard great comments about @TinnieSinker as well. If you haven't already, I'd give them a shout and go from there.

By the way, your build sounds insane man. I'll be following this one for sure and can't wait to see how you put it all together.  

Also, as @rich mentioned above, the sealed gear drive  units from @Nowind are a great option. I have these on my board and if you plan to be using your board off road, then this type of drive unit stands alone.

Hey.
Gearratio is possible upto 1:6.25
Custom parts are often expensive, most times it will be cheaper to change the hanger or hubs to go with excisting parts.

@Nowind Hey Jens!!
Thanks for the input man!! I‚Äôm a big fan of your awesome CNC drives. 
My idea is to have it around 1:6 and as there won‚Äôt be a hanger to mount it to, I was going to TIG some mounts to it and is it as the ‚Äúhub‚Äù so to speak. So the wishbones will mount to it too and bottom, as will the steering tie rod. I think this would be the most suitable. 
I will try and draw my idea and PM it to you to see what you think?
Thanks for the info!!

Dog had a long day on the welder.....
Got the lower suspension wishbones welded up, decided steeel would be best for these, the rest of the setup and board will be aluminium, however decided the strength would be needed here.
have some grinding down to do now to reduce the weight, then off to powder coat.

Hey @Trdolan03 
The suspension and battery box will be fixed, imagine the above piece attached with a long aluminium box (that will hold the batteries and electronics. On top of that there will be linear bearings t hold a "deck" think an aluminium version of a skate deck. As it pivots on the bearings it will pull/push a tie rod attached to the wheel hub. its all an imaginative idea at the moment. I figured Id do the bit I know and make some educated guesses about the rest hahaha sorry for being vague.

Similar "lean to turn" concept but rather than pivoting on a single axis it will have 3 "links" that make it all work.

@Woody1989 you probably already thought of this but your gonna want adjustable steering rate front and rear. So they can be adjusted independently to each other for tuning.

@lrdesigns, 
Yeah, I have thought of the concept, just not the design. The actual turning lever will resemble a pendulum, I figured having the ability to move the tie rod further up the pendulum will reduce the tie rod overall travel. Once the chassis part is finished, I think there will be copious amounts of trial and error here.... hahaha
Something else to add to my list of growing speed bumps though hahaha.
Cheers, 
Woody

So to update, the lower control arms made of steel were waaayyyyy too heavy, I ended up waterjet cutting 25mm aluminium to make the lowers, upper arms are 12mm aluminium. Battery box/chassis is now done. Have to fabricate a small frame to fix a plexiglass lid to the chassis and then I‚Äôll start the deck and steering. 
It‚Äôs all coming together now!! Thanks for the support!!

Hey Buddy,

First of all, You have some serious talent!

Other than that, I tried to make a 4 wheel drive ESK8 Board with 2 Unities. The Reliability is just not there.

Here's what I would recommend.
#1: Split your Battery Pack in half. If You were going to do a 12S10P, then use a single 12S5P for each ESC instead. I think  this helps reduce the current on some vulnurable IC's on the Focbox Unity's PCB.

#2: With a larger Board like Yours, you might consider using 2 or 4 Authentic VESC ESC's, the original product designed by Benjamin Vedder. I believe that there is a "6 Series" VESC that drives 1 per Motor per each. 4 of these would probably have what You need for Reliability. Or even look at 2 of the "75/300's" maybe for a Reliable Front or Rear Wheel Drive vehicle.. Maybe see what kind of Battery/ESC/Motor Baja Board uses and grab the exact same parts. There are reasons that Enertion uses a 10S Battery Pack, not an 11S or a 12S pack, even though the FOCBOX UNITY can be powered by a 12S Battery.

#3: I when I first started, I figured i'd validate the advertised specifications for the ESC's and Motors. 
This approach is not good. I'd highly recommend starting at something like 55% or 60% of the amperage which would be consistent with the maximum Motor or ESC Specifications. You'll probably be thrilled with the ability to use more of the throttle and you won't kill the ESC the first week.

One other thing, if you only have 1 battery for 2 Focboxes or for any VESC-like ESC, reduce the "Maximum Braking Regenerative Current" by dividing it by 2. (Both ESC's will be sending regenerative current to the same battery pack, so if your battery pack can handle -36 amps, then set each of the 2 ESC's to "Maximum Braking Regenerative Current" to-18 amps. ) 

If you set both ESC's at -36 amps, you will end up sending up to -72 Amps to the battery pack.
I believe this error results in a burned LM 5060 IC on the Focbox's PCB. 

A User Manual with Crucial tips about how to set the VESC initially to avoid killing it would be nice. But it would also take a lot of work to compile and reduce sales volume, so I can see why that is not a high priority. But anyway, reduce your Max Battery Regen current setting to take in to account that both of your 2 VESCS will be generating current towards the battery pack.
