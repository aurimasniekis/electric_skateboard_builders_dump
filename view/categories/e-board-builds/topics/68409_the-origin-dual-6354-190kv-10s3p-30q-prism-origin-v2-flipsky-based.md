My old post ended up being messy, I never posted updates and in general not set up well so here we go again!

 
My goal with this board was a slim, great looking board for small or long commutes to the shops around my city or a simple cruise out in the open with my camera.

Also wanted a very premium board with a great design that I can hopefully obtain with some touchups. 


Full part list:
**Deck**: Prism Origin V2.
**Trucks**: Caliber II 50 10".
**Risers**: No name wedged risers.
**Wheels**: Eskating.eu 90mm 78A Premium flywheels.
**Bearings**: Mindless Hoodoo.
**Motor Mounts**: Eskating.eu.
**Motors**: Flipsky 190KV 6354.
**Battery Pack**: 10S3P Samsung 30Q.
**VESC**: F̶l̶i̶p̶s̶k̶y̶ ̶4̶.̶2̶0̶ ̶D̶u̶a̶l̶ ̶V̶E̶S̶C̶.̶ Dual Enertion Focbox.
**Bluetooth Module**: Flipsky / (Metr.
**Remote**: Flipsky Nano / (Firefly.
**Pulley System**: Eskating.eu 15/36 12mm.
**Enclosure**: Eskating.eu Slim.
**AntiSpark**: Flipsky Antispark Pro.


Add-ons like metr, and Firefly remote is in the works.

Possible top speed is around 28mph but limited to 22, the range is around 15 miles but it has space for a 10s4p if I want more in the future.



To do list: (It's in order of what I feel is most important to last important) 

B̶u̶y̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶r̶e̶p̶l̶a̶c̶e̶ ̶b̶e̶a̶r̶i̶n̶g̶s̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶a̶d̶d̶ ̶s̶p̶a̶c̶e̶r̶s̶.̶ 

B̶u̶y̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶i̶n̶s̶t̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶l̶a̶s̶t̶ ̶p̶u̶l̶l̶e̶y̶.̶ 

Clean up the entire deck since the threaded inserts from eskating.eu broke during installation and my painter's tape destroyed the paint job.

A̶d̶d̶ ̶c̶l̶e̶a̶r̶ ̶g̶r̶i̶p̶t̶a̶p̶e̶.̶ 

Buy and add metr module.

Tweak vesc and belts to perfection.

Replace wheels with 85mm Caguamas.

Add Firefly remote.

(Maybe)Remove all threaded inserts sand down the deck to pure wood and coat it in a protective layer and add new inserts


So far I'm not that happy with my result, poor quality inserts made the deck look bad same goes for enclosures mounts did not fit as wanted so I had to sand down the truck and repaint it (Does not look good right now) and I wanted a perfect top surface but drillbit snapped so I had to drill all the way in one insert so I covered that but all of this is totally possible to perfect in the future but for now not totally up to my level of perfection but this is what diy is for its an always ongoing project and at first a "prototyping stage" that I would say I am in right now.


My goal is to have a very great looking and reliable board for next summer, so this is my winter project.

[/quote]

It's what @longhairedboy and a few others use to do clear griptape. Polyurethane and glass frit (crushed glass)
Board looks great btw.
I passed up that deck used for really cheap a few months ago and regret that now.

Damn! That is a sexy build! How do those mounts work for you? Do they slip at all? Also why is there no pulley on the left back wheel?

The mounts are great, i have yet to take these exact out i used them on a different board once though you can adjust them so no slip.

And i dont have any, ran out of money for this and next month so will be a little while before i buy one.

Yeah, but in general im like out.

Bank account has just enough to get me some dope food for the rest of the month else i would totally have ordered the last part and been riding now.

Considering selling some camera gear to get it going since the weather is mint atm.

Managed to find some random stuff around the house and sell it so i just had enough for the pulley washers and griptape!

I've got some bottles i can return for some money then i have for the bearings hahaha!

![image|648x443](upload://bYOVGNSD3eakhYWvoom1ZlBH0Et.png) 

When i get the battery pack + these parts, i can then install the motors i have been given for testing by a mate program the VESC and finally go out riding.

After a bit of looking around it seems like its more the bigger 6374 ones that have the issues, I took both of mine apart last night I was not able to find solder balls and they looked okay other then the sensor is fried but they are also brand new so not sure if it means anything. (Motors are both dead due to bad battery not flipskys fault)

My mate also recently ordered some that I will be using they look vastly different compared to the 6374 and the older 6354 I got a month ago so maybe they changed supplier? They look more sealed and more robust than the old ones and the windings looks very good compared to mine.

Not much done the past few days, UPS says Pulleys and griptape and washers should be here Monday and my replacement battery should soon ship so this week should be the week where the core concept is done.


But i got the on/off switch installed, those damn flipsky makes you need to cut the wires and solder it again since its not removeable.

Also cleaned it all up, added all the parts onto the deck with velcro so all i need to do is plug a battery in now install pulleys and do the last bit of clean up and griptape then i can start to test it out!

Griptape landed! Looks amazing! I like the frosty look it gives it, it makes it look better since it covers all my flaws.![42406282_347112749357214_2816840011725406208_n|666x500](upload://oHvpMuEnnF6qu0f6K6gTLrkVIIJ.jpeg) ![42402401_563602307425790_6824054321483612160_n|666x500](upload://f3gquofr3oghrpOXeYmPABscZft.jpeg)

Got the new battery in the mail and due to the BMS being mounted on top it wont fit :/ Well time to look for a new enclosure then.

you can always use neoprene to uplift the enclosure and then cut out the shape where the BMS is and put a thinner piece of neoprene where the missing piece is to ensure that the bms isn't pressing on hard wood.

Yeah but its a 1CM difference so its a big to high for just using foam here.

Wont be that nice.

But ill most likely if i cant find a nicer enclosure mount the BMS outside of the pack, just waiting for reply from the guy that made it.

I had the same issue, ended up routing out some of the deck to accommodate the pack. Sucks, but aside from unwrapping the pack and attempting to move the bms (and everything that would entail), it was the only solution I could stomach.

Yeah i was going to get the deck milled so i had a few extra layers i could use for foam and stuff in my original drawings but my CNC/mill friend bailed on me and got fired so i have no one to do it hahaha.

I wish i knew i wish i knew, so many issues with it so its in parts at the moment.

Got the battery and then had to ship the vesc out for repair since it broke.

Bought a cheap Chinese Dual ESC for this year then ill try my best to save up for some dual focboxes that should put a stop on my issues once and for all.

Since the flipsky broke i decided to go with a bit higher quality vesc instead.

So vesc update from flipsky to focbox and ill most likely have a flipsky vesc 4.20 dual for sale if the guy can fix it.

So unstable, but damn those motors from flipsky are nice.

The last update I will do on this board most likely, its "done" I was planning on doing some upgrades and changes but after running it with this cheapo ESC I must admit it does well enough and I feel like I may have wasted lots of power and money to get power since its a shortboard and I won't get to use much of the power i now have.

The last thing that will be done will be a downgrade of the motors to even cheaper ones without sensors and small wires then expect a sick build from me next year! Hint Trampa Street. (With my current motors and my new VESCS)
