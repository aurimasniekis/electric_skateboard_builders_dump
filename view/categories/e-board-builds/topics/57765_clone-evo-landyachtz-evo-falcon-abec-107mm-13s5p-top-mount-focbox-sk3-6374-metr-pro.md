Inspired by @Deckoz 'Master Evo'  'Clone' makes sense 

Starting my build thread to help me keep track of the last parts - attempting to wait until I have everything in one big exquisite pile :sunglasses:

Waiting for the enclosure but looks like a 13s5p is possible :smile:

13s5p fits without focboxes in there

Hey there.

I ordered a two pin SP13 2 Pin Aviation connector, that included male and female sides, it is 13mm in diameter so not much bigger then the 9mm diameter DC plugs.

I haven't received it yet, but have used SP13 connectors in the past for other projects. I don't plan on cutting my chargers, just making a 3-5" hot plug with the new end, incase I ever sell the chargers.

***Progress: Foc Box Case*** 

https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/cases/products/limited-edition-red-dual-focbox-case-with-cooling-fins-v2?variant=12113165746269

Foc Box enclosure arrived, looks great and quality is excellent - more than happy with it :) @Kug3lis 
Now where to mount? always imagined it mid board, and I think it looks cool there  

![image|690x379](upload://hch18jPN2eLwIos1l2LcYZej134.jpg)

practicality would dictate something a little more 'near the motors' 

![image|690x234](upload://bqlvk14GLYF1DhwnbvXlg7LOq0k.jpg)

not sure about there will have to see how it looks with trucks.

***Progress: Battery***

![image|611x499](upload://3NES6GONkYjo8RQt2QSPXu39sU5.jpg)

Spot Welder arrived and built, decided on a lipo rather than car battery 

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-nano-tech-5000mah-3s-65-130c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html
 
all plugged in and working :) 

![image|560x500](upload://rt7xyPUeSnRoHAhXjS0PyxKwnJt.jpg)

ready to test and uhhhhh new battery and I have nothing to charge it here lol 

looks cool though

Be careful with Y splitter and CAN bus I burned one of my FocBox when one XT90 got disconnected...

Use ziptie two tie in between the wires to not let them disconnect without removing zip tie :)

[/quote]

I did read this when I started debugging things, I must admit that if I'd not read those horror stories I would have def. tried one box on and the other without power and the CAN bus connected. 

I found @Deckoz video on canbus setup really helpful, oddly I had all those settings right but never occurred to me that my remote binding/Metr connect issues were due to having the USB port connected! I didn't see this anywhere else.

I have been using one receiver pr. Focbox on my dual drive for over a year now, without any problems. The only thing the two focboxes share, is main plus/minus.  I like the redundancy of that setup. If one receiver/focbox fails, i stil have one working , and can brake.
With one receiver and can bus shit, if one fucks Up, you are without brakes and maybe both focboxes will get killd

Looking good, I've gone with 180mm trucks on my 36" build. That front truck looks HUGE! I quite like the width of the back though, especially with that focmount.

From your picture it looks like your grip tape was attached by the same person as mine :expressionless: slightly off center to the right?

yea I don't like the look of the front truck - that's with 83mm flywheel clones 107s might look slightly better, truck width makes me want another 2 motors on the front lol 

the grip I through I kept on getting weird angles on my pics but yes looks like its off center just a little ;)

I would mount it so the power wires out back and phase wires up front. This way you can run both of them underneath and cleanly hide the wires. ;)

@sk8l8r here's how I did it on the trampa still needs wire mesh but you getting idea...

Loads of progress ...

**P Groups**

Hot glued and fish paper added - rings and folded over positive terminals for fuse wire isolation
![image|646x500](upload://aJyWNbxgCpRqLOZtovTdfV87DjS.jpg)

fuse wire was fairly easy to weld at 7ms, soldered fuse wire to pcb
![image|690x377](upload://yNV3PQKgKMFIVSLLEK4bi4gPL0d.jpg)

on the negative, nickel strip with 2 bent over and  soldered to make connection to pcb 
![image|690x391](upload://4tXFjcbBsSpWUB8hg3KFkWcMAsx.jpg)

that extra solder was on purpose
![image|690x411](upload://7HGOuJiqk0aZEUr5vJaHXAhygU.jpg)

soldered balance leads
![image|690x321](upload://pUBQqT4dT6lY3zHWoJQ6yH6vrmC.jpg)

wrapped in kapton tape (cut outs for S connection soldering)  
![image|690x450](upload://x5yVrYOfFmA6Pl16dNczVpAxFeH.jpg)

**Wheels** 
decided I needed the extra 7mm and went for some ABEC 107mm SuperFly 
![image|452x500](upload://lAViKDyuGmBHAVeZdf3UG6Jlcfb.jpg)

and those Bronson G3's originally bought by one-click-accident, they just turned up one day, was planning to use Bronson RAW's (for the sound) but in the words of my 7yo nephew 'they are REALLY smooth'  

the 107mm makes things look much more in scale with these wide trucks...

@Brdchris spent some time this weekend testing out motor clearance - still waiting on my really long bolts but tested some setups: 

- with 6 degree still way too close fits but can't turn 
- with 12 degree totally fine, almost feels like it was made for this setup

another thing to think about is removing some of the evo orig. truck angles

@llreinzll thanks for pointing out my mistake - initially planned on getting those from the bottom ones but they worked out much more expensive so decided to opt for the top mounted ones but totally forgot they were different when fitting, I think you just saved my enc. from serious damaged :)

I haven’t had a chance to install them, they came Saturday but I’m on vacation this week.

 I read a tip that said to take a deep well socket, place it over your drill bit so that you can only drill as deep as the insert is. That will prevent you from drilling all the way through. Also use masking tape where you drill to prevent the socket from marring the deck finish. Then lightly countersink the hole to prevent stress cracks at the 90 degree cut.
```

Ok you lost at masking tape lol I think that was @psychotiller’s post on how to mount your enclosure? I dont even know how to counter sink haha so i place a strip of masking tape over where i wanna drill through? I don’t get how that protects the finish of the deck.

I’m already thinking of trying it out on my ownboard deck first before doing so on the tesseract haha

Progress: enc. mounting

after installing my nutcerts the wrong way I had some rework to do ...
![image|607x439](upload://30SsXuhar3pc2aqQi3wTYBNP0XP.jpg)

these were way harder to get out than I expected, had to heat them a little to release the epoxy

find I use this little torch more and more 
http://www.dx.com/p/honest-503-butane-jet-pencil-torch-lighter-black-153543#.W128Y9VKj4Y

drilled countersunk holes through the deck 
![image|684x500](upload://yerQXIOkJHLuDgdI5IngUcRdAyq.jpg)

and added a little epoxy to keep them from spinning (next time I'm using those screw in ones lol)
![image|543x420](upload://oXew1GFZRWQrtLZBXuimlOcll7z.jpg)

Nice build. I have to say I'll use it for reference when I continue my Falcon build. I initially tried the standard TB motor mounts, but couldn't find a good angle for them. With the mounting positions available they ended up being almost horizontal. Which I know from another build to scrape motors, even with 107s. 

So I'm considering the extended reverse mounts (or different mounts altogether). Although with 320-330mm 12mm belts, not having an idler is worrying.

I understand this entirely. I contemplated moving the truck back a bit by drilling new mounting holes but there's not much room to go on the deck and I would worry about integrity. I didn't want to turbo wedge either. I looked at about 15 different mounts, I have 5 sets of different ones sitting here in my box, none of them worked.

So I have some rear tb mounts in customs right now, released tomorrow and that will be my solution until something better comes along. I really didn't want to rear mount but that's just the way the cookie crumbled :slight_smile:

Thanks for that input. I think the TB extended mounts will work, I'd rather have the motor clearance for full lean anyway. I just don't know how much I trust 12mm belts at that length without a tensioner. Has anyone modded the TB extended mounts to have an idler? Or have different solution?

@Static Further to this, here's my plan:

I have a set of @dickyho dual idler mounts here, I'm going to steal one of the idlers from each mount and install them on the TB reverse mount:

![ilders|374x500](upload://n1oRbFtam5UNhfMaRkR2g1Mckm2.jpg)


I'll drill out a little section of the motor mounting groove to give it some stability from sliding and then use a decent size bolt to put this idler on. 

![tb%20mount%20adapt|690x261](upload://48FVlxEVOeznScfA0cs2tYgZ9Ls.jpg)

The idler bearings have a lip on one side and a nylon spacer, perfect for holding the belt in place but they don't look like they are the best bearings in the world ;) I'll see how they hold up and replace as needed. 

You can get them for $2.50, hard to go wrong really, even if its just for proof of concept: https://www.ebay.com/itm/302775190943

this thing has brutal acceleration need to work on setting acceleration curve

wires need tiding (waiting on my auto switch) re-gripping still planned

![image|670x500](upload://7ANeABIEMkrWaNVYQTYlGlrRLnD.jpg)

had an unexpected side effect I was able to mount a little closer than before meaning I have workable clearance :)

vs

taken my first successful test ride kept under 20mph and best of all no motors hitting the enclosure! 
![image|690x422](upload://kMDorP5QqeL0nblsx6LxXaAZMx0.jpg)

strange feeling going from decks with tails, but like the way the evo handles so far 

best of all when I look down I see my monkey :sunglasses:

by far the best best xwasher I've ever seen thanks again @3DServisas

still to add the push to power on switch but its finally usable :joy:

Forgot to say; done about 15miles on it and must admit stance wise I wish had the bigger one,  I love decks with tails so the stance length is much less than I'm used too - the 27inches+ on my lush machine spoiled me falcon feels cramped but really love being able to jam myself in it's really nice having the wedge at the front.

why is it within 24 hours of finishing a new board I ALWAYS break and existing one (3 times now lol)

had a lucky one last night, was doing about 25mph suddenly rear trucks snaps, looked back and one wheel and motor was bouncing off into the distance...

I was really lucky to happen next to a nice grassy garden, I managed to stay on until down to about 15mph (quite enjoyed that part lol) ran it off into someone's front garden, I'm so glad they did'nt have a knee high wall :) 

2 mins earlier or later I would have hit a wooden fence there would have been nowhere to go

I must have read this build thread about 5 times now.  Fantastic thread man.  Honest funny and real.
and the board well one of the prettiest esk8s out there right now.  This and @Deckoz master evo are the  reason why I have a 39 evo and @Eboosted enclosure winging their respective ways to me right now.  
Probs going to go reverse for mine though and not because it looks gangster I just think that the evo is shaped like that for a reason and wedging it seems to somehow defeat the object.  Could be wrong......I usually am.  Love to know how it rides after a month of abuse from someone who obviously shreds and especially interested in how that fused battery is holding up? Not brave enough to build my own yet so doing loads of research and reading and standing on the shoulders of better men lol
 Anyway again great build great board and when it all arrives I'll chuck up a thread so you can all put me right when I go wrong.

thanks :) 

must admit this board was never built to be abused, it has no tail so only so much I can do with it ;) 

battery is holding up fairly well the fuses wire no problems at all, a small issue with my abilities soldering 10 AWG - one of my serial connections came loose when doing an 'internal 40 mile inspection'

I'm about to start my new build thread for 'Shred Machine' already started building the battery same style but this deck has some real pop so i do expect problems with fusing with it ;) 

I'm really happy with how maintainable my packs are, I can get inside, pull out the pgroup and actually visually inspect all the fuses - just next time I'm going 2x14AWG instead of 10AWG , lacks flexibility.

Def. recommend doing a build thread, even good to keep track of next steps etc. for yourself :)

I had trouble with 10awg too when soldering to a flat area.  Once I got it tinned right and spread a little it went fine.  Bms terminals is about as far as I venture into battery construction.  I have trouble with the itty bitty little wires as my eyes are going.

hello @dareno, the evo was designed with randall 35 degree trucks in mind to have 50 degree in the front and 20 degree in the back to help avoid speed wobbles. i have an evo as well and can tell you it does feel twitchy after 20-25mph. so if you buy 50 degree baseplates trucks like i did i would suggest to buy angled risers to have at least 55 degree on the front. 
this changed the feel for me. now im stable at 35mph, also you should get in the thread "bushing setup help" from @Alphamail. he helped me with my setup and its just the way i wanted it now. 
Besides... riptide's got the good sh..tuff man.

i bought torqueboards pro kit 2 with 218mm trucks, they feel good for me with 15' khiro riser in the front and 10' in the back so i end up with 50\25. (muirskate.com for angled risers :wink:)
as for bushings: krank magnums boardside(i like that they fill the bushing seat completely) and canons roadside(this are better than the barrels imho since they are a tiny little bit bigger). 87a duro; im 130lbs these are a bit on the hard side for my weight and need to use my body a bit more than the rest of ppl to turn slow but they keep me stable at 30mph+ and you look cool when turning lol

218s are what I'm planning on using.  I'm just wondering how it will ride with the 50'   On the website LY sell the complete with bear grizzlys which look to me like the 50'.  Doesn't say though.  I'm a big heavy guy at 240lbs (big boned not fat lolz) so I can do hard bushings. It would be nice to get the thing to carve as well as stay stable plus 35mph.  Guess I'm just going to have to test it out and see.  So much of this stuff is relevant to your weight and riding style.  The only way to really know is to get out and amongst it.  I'll be doing a build thread once I start on the assembly so you can see how it goes.  Thanks for the help and thanks to @sk8l8r for letting me bomb this thread.

![image|690x425](upload://uhDg67vvH8L1adJBWznvKxhzrxs.jpeg) 

1st BMS fried, from too much pressure and cold solder on my AWS10 serial connection, it just popped off when I removed the tape :( 
![image|607x499](upload://7twIBmEr6UAKsZY93T2z5Klbcjy.jpeg) 

BMS didn't even have one led to help debug, broke two troubleshooting intially 1st by replacing without checking the S connections, screwed 2nd one up fitting it 

since this is my speed board I don't want a dodgy battery there, so decided to rebuild the battery and use this one in build with full smart BMS (so I can see whats going on)

Building the P groups (my fav. part of battery building) 

hot glue on cells (after checking all the voltages) 
![image|690x496](upload://p9Z73fE1X1QJrXAi95sZC8pU4Yy.jpeg) 

using 15mm nickel strip for the p-groups and 2x 20mm for connecting the the neg strip to the cell holder
(miss-labeled)
![image|690x350](upload://qkqXdoB3jwLappEOh2BqNkZ9ng.jpeg)  

looking at this pic now I think I could have gone longer on the welds but they were secure
![image|604x500](upload://faX6GOnmXs54SD5lQSUGBUcbSKx.jpeg)  

added layer of fishpaper to top and bottom of groups, pre-cut the nickel strips and scuffed up the cell holders
![image|646x500](upload://Aqyi3crbc5h9820j5kUjtxdu1hU.jpeg)  

hot glued the cell holders 
![image|690x469](upload://uoDIGCO0JFcWKVMJh20PEwSOagJ.jpeg) 

welded 2x 20mm nickel stips to neg strips
![image|405x286](upload://7Ql5BguBXYXwSzqRuwJV31QLL0v.jpeg) 

soldered the 20mm strips to cell holder
![image|690x459](upload://iu9DzV2c32eNOqRgSoJR4pghkSp.jpeg) 

using this fuse wire 
![image|488x500](upload://r8X3T0ntS82hJnZcPOS2VCWiRBe.jpeg) 

welded on fuse wire to each cell - I don't suggest anyone try this without some of practice on dead cells and really make some don't rush it! 
![image|690x466](upload://2RtUkuMK25k6xBMFCSW9sA5rLPr.jpeg) 

its not pretty but secure
![image|649x500](upload://gPBqHSexWC7EY7BDFXKzKgTIRVD.jpeg) 

soldered each used a 25w solder iron to cell holder - it really it quite fiddly but this stage is a seriously good test of the strength of fuse wire weld
![image|690x432](upload://znRlqNrQy3rlxUGYmIp24kacWQ4.jpeg)  

used a 100w iron to make sure things are sound
![image|513x500](upload://oYMJmBbw2dMv1NLmXhDVhjPr9R2.jpeg) 

wrapped each group in kapon 
![image|682x500](upload://uKHqT0LBFHPdgwF0v6SNfiVqv5L.jpeg) 

using a head torch to drain group slightly (this one normally takes 2 18650 cells) 
![image|372x500](upload://a4MHtB2AqUNlHmMk6OfqO8gM2K.jpeg) 

Since I didn't really have the confidence I should have, I decided to do at loads of bullets before touching a battery S group connection again 
![image|690x398](upload://lg6OpEDgKV5S2JPRz2E50FU0k3O.jpeg) 

if they needed them or they have them now...
![image|629x486](upload://o2iDm8PNbSo2vpjba12v6Gjhh2d.jpeg)

quickly discovered that my cheap ass 100w solder iron was total junk and it wasn't my lack of skills 
![image|690x459](upload://tLggd0ISYIA2fidnejnl0DF2c7q.jpeg) 

looking at the page now its even cheaper than I paid, totally worthless: it has no temp control so the tip melts!
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000R9Y0ZK

got a real one this time, it made all the difference, so on with more bullets, I did my whole box O'VESCs / motors and even a couple of ramdom ESCs
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0001P17CO

so now I actually have some solder skills, on with the series connection  
![image|665x500](upload://vKHxPU2UgSd4UwLgKYWaNMjzgdD.jpeg) 

this time no 10AWG I'm using 2x14AWG 
![image|663x500](upload://vL3fgtBy6yPEEnsFqYa4FBp4aeR.jpeg) 

BMS number 4 - all ready for the balance wires
![image|617x500](upload://r4eZ6lt3OOjeQiNee55yXcjdyE5.jpeg) 

last wires all ready to solder....
![image|642x499](upload://9oIXxJ8gyBf0V9COUMJ2q880ThM.jpeg) 

and boom...
![image|611x500](upload://qj7pJf1cNCs6gligRQNAGoMeLVs.jpeg) 

![image|654x499](upload://nqEy8bBdKcQBGuiT8OugGA0uTVa.jpeg) 

I KNOW poor battery design - convenience > safety + and - next to each other is a bad idea 
![image|690x375](upload://sLQPEm5RD8WUuavPiKqH3w3jC0q.jpeg) 

the Root Cause was a new gas solder iron to solder the think part bridged the battery terminals and caused a slight explosion 
![image|672x471](upload://duYEFaTI5Eaz1W8JF3BrWaaMfy8.jpeg)  

this is the damaged side, I think the explosion was caused by the gas igniting within solder iron 
![image|649x500](upload://qqL29KSK3iPdnUX1UraCw9Mk0iB.jpeg)  

fixed... but I wish I had a my welder handy to build a new pack 
![image|690x427](upload://z9QvmOEGBj0McpxPIfKGMOyb4sq.jpeg) 

all dead so far... should have ordered a 10 pack
![image|624x500](upload://r9tjbd3iiOmMqeKPOwIVZfmnVKd.jpeg)

...next victims arrived but I've decided not to use these anymore
![image|559x500](upload://dQfVszbZkP4lVs7VvPxlwX27Tbp.jpeg)

Ordered a waterproof one WITH balance

new balance wires (I do like the red!) 
![image|666x500](upload://sOnqoVq7j9fMyiazfBnMUUeclKB.jpeg) 

rebuilt
![image|667x500](upload://iSDlulRnIwXkK3mXQ3nV4RfvfPT.jpeg) 

this time taking no chances while soldering the on B+ | B -
![image|669x500](upload://5PMGUV94KAWgjIUnqQNPmUcSTYn.jpeg) 

I wanted to have the BMS above the cells, a quick prototype...
![image|642x500](upload://xGgHgOaDoE5ORRA815lTEwq4UCD.jpeg) 

final version of BMS mount 
![image|665x500](upload://6pQB4ETopZUNejkNWs1hnbFfcVx.jpeg)  

finally charging! :smile:
![image|671x500](upload://svWIxj6Oa5Rgvuq7N2yRd4apArL.jpeg) 

completed enc.
![image|690x395](upload://fEFVsuF2rzqJit7ImS8EwjGCODI.jpeg) 

BMS mounting in foam 
![image|669x500](upload://aFbxcUpDAGs6iieNsl5ntGcaZdV.jpeg) 

fish paper backing so foam does not disintegrate 
![image|671x500](upload://k1ILDvrfHWZpabOTDnN7ahbj3kt.jpeg) 

added bullets to SK3s
![image|667x500](upload://qEVcr31h5zaLMapB5zBZsej4lh8.jpeg) 

added bullets to FOCs, I find it relaxing doing bullets now :wink:
![image|669x500](upload://olDqjDrZGKQL8rCd4InHBcM9pIG.jpeg)  

found some really good quality heat shrink 
![image|673x500](upload://nYWDL5tN2WgMbd6tDqYU5tuaeJC.jpeg) 

group shot :blush:
![image|372x500](upload://hbDROMzE66mLNkGGiKcNq8XdGXQ.jpeg)  


**Lessons**
- an inexperienced user doesn't know when to blame the tools
- buy the best tools you can don't be too cheap
- practice, practice and more practice, by the end of this I actually find soldering relaxing now, not before lol

Man, I am also thinking at a 13s. Did you have the chance to test for few hundreds Km your board?

yes I've done about 200 or so I keep seeing people say 13s is dodgy - I've got a spare 5p group lying around I've had to stop myself testing 14s since in theory it should be fine  lol :smile:

Good, Is the BMS working fine? I was also looking to the bestech HCX-D099. I used their BMS for 12s and they seems to work well.
14s should be feasible with unity. or when @shaman finishes the 20s vesc that we are all waiting :grin:

I had a problem with one of my SK3s so decided to try out some 6374s I had lying about from @dickyho
![image|672x500](upload://m4O6jkMTs8aOvfdDazHOmLQpqAo.jpeg)   

spotted some 6384s @dickyho had and it looked like they might fit 
![image|491x500](upload://aaY5UmaqAFFbPnBlbVaUkQ9CZCW.jpeg)  

6484 is almost same size as SK3!
6474 / SK3 / 6484
![image|677x500](upload://cf2Y6l57q84cso2eeDYiau8QTxT.jpeg) 

loads of space :smile:

if with 2X 12.5mm thick wheel pulleys, on this truck, I think OK for dual 6384.
