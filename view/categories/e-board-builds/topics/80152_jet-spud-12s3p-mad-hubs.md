A while back I got in on a group buy held by @rey8801. I finally had time to throw together a board. 

Jet spud, 
12s3p 30Q pack,
MAD hubs 75kv, 
dual focbox,  
90mm Popoca wheels,
Eboosted single stack enclosure,
Surfrodz 200mm rkp front truck,
Push start switch,
Vicious griptape,

I have the exact same setup! Except that I have a DIY fiberglass enclosure that is not comparable with yours :sweat_smile:
12s3p battery works great on this tiny board, plenty of power. I hope you will have fun!

Edit: I am also interested in knowing where did you find a 12s mini BMS :grin:

Somebody mentioned that you can add a balance board to it, but in my humble opinion that will be also not smaller than a d140.
But what you can make, you bought the d606 which can balance. In case the balance plug is the same you could use this bms from time to time to balance out your pack externally.
The d503 will take care that you don’t over charge your cells. So you could use that one for overcharge safety and every 10-20th charge cycles you will change the balance plug to the d606.

Hmmm @Hummie mentioned using two of these a while back. Maybe I could make some enclosure ports for the connectors and use these when I charge. Any thoughts?

Can’t you just move the battery a bit in direction of your focbox? Than there should be enough space for a d140 bms, hopefully.

I like that little one. I have one.  If u order them get me two more and I’ll come give u cash! N a cookie.
It’s very slow to balance but works.  Best if you wire up all your pack into two 6s plugs for them. I mostly just use one though

Yeah two and the current bms would definitely be too big. I was thinking have the connectors for these to be able to fit to the enclosure from an outside port.

I could maybe modify the layout a bit to try to fit a bigger bms, but if there’s a way to keep it as is I’d prefer it.

entirely. this is how the balance function works on most bms's, just usually its all physically integrated. The balancing circuit checks if the voltage is over 4.2, and if it is, it'll let current through the resistors to drain the excess energy.
Even on the d140 the balancing current is relatively low due to thermal limits, but near the end of the charge cycle, the charge current drops significantly anyways.

Personally, I don't trust those balance things. It unbalanced and killed a few p's and mixed voltages up (they were all new cells, never charged, near perfect balance). But that was my experience, I wish you GL as it would be the ideal solution.

Yep thst the idea. The only downside that due to the motor size for clearance you need to use >97mm wheels. I am not a big fun. For me 90mm is plenty. Low ride board are more stable.

If you have some riding data, please post it :grin:

No no I still have to cut it. The 8mm axle would be only for like 3 cm. All the rest is stain steel adapter 12mm...would be better to have just a long 12mm axle but I wanted to make a conversion kit and still be able to come back. If I want to use 12mm axle whole the way
I have to drill the motor and then no conversion anymore. Moroever the motor can would sorround the 8mm axle part. I hope it's enough. We'll see it. The other DD I am making is from scratch and that is all the way thicker axle

Yes but this hubs are made that basicaly they hold themself at the start and the end. So basically I am using this fact to make a axle adapter where the joint is supported by the motor can. It is for sure the weaker point. I am not sure it will work. If not then I will probably drill the motor and make it simpler.

Ehi man! Did you get the nut? I started to ride them at 12s. I find it quite challenging to stay on the board compare to my precious motors and I had to move to 97mm, which I don't like since you are higher from the ground. They are strong!

Hey thanks for sending it or so quick. I just got an email from my mail company saying it arrived. It’ll be a while until I get to ride because it’s supposed to rain here for the next foreseeable future. When I first tested, I felt like I was going to fly off when accelerating. That was on 50 degree front trucks. I have some 43 degree that I plan to switch to.

Good, that was fast!
Yeh I think that 12s3p and MAD hubs are a bit overkill on a short spud. I am used to speed and already got to above 50kmh. What surprise me is the constant acceleration that above 40kmh start to be too much and even if I lend forward I feel the board trying to push me back. Never felt like thst before. I have 97mm wheels so even less torque. I will probably move to 90mm to reduce a bit the insane speed and get more stability.

Well I took it on vacation with me and about 7 miles in it shit off giving an undervoltage error at 7.8V. At first I thought it was a battery issue but when I was able to get home to take it apart I found out it was the switch.

I don’t know what happened. I went over a huge amount of bumps in the road and then it just shut off. Battery still works, but switch isn’t working at all anymore. It doesn’t look like anything rattled loose and I wasn’t pulling that many amps.

Yeah it blew on my 4wd as well when I was messing with the internal bms switch on my phone app. The difference is that switch always stays on now (unless I disable it through the app) and the spud switch (push to start) just won’t work at all. It’s just strange that it happened right after I went over some crazy road bumps


Damn the unity wouldn’t come until end of June if ordered now. So many roadblocks stopping me from riding this build

That sucks. Maybe someone wants to sell their unity. I saw some posts about it. @pookybear in case you don't want one of your unity maybe he can take it. I think in your case @Chase, since you want a stealth build and with 12s3p is fully crowded inside the enclosure, you will gain a lot of space with it.

I think I’m gonna put my enertion nano in it instead of this maytech thumb throttle thats currently in it.

I’ll have to find the instructions for the unity roll to start switch setup and it’s other features since it came with zero paperwork. I’m sure it’s straightforward but I’m not about to carelessly fuck this expensive speed controller up.

Ordered the Boss spot welder from the Korean vendor to reinforce the nickel strips. Too dangerous not too
