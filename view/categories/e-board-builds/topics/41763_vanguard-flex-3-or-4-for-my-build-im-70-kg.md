Hi there,

I plan on making my first build next spring, and I already own a Vanguard Flex 4. However, I'm wondering wether I should sell it and buy a Flex 3 for more rigidity (I'm afraid Flex 4 will get wobbly at 30 km/h). I'm 70 kg, and plan a build with a 6374 single motor and 10S3P cells. What do you guys think?

Or you could add a few layers of fiberglass to add rigidity!

Or, even better - Carbon fiber

Try to add some carbon fiber.. will be effective and good looking

I add cf to the bottom of my deck. I feel like it makes it 15% mor stiff. 

Non scientific number

Thanks for the answers guys! Alright I'll give a shot to CF then. Do you have any recommendations/good practices on the type? gram/m2, etc? Any epoxy resin would be fine? 

@barajabali Damn that's CF porn right there

I'm in love with that board


Edit: oh I was looking at it the complete wrong way the far side of the enclosure looks a different colour and I thought it was the carbon fibre and idk what I thought ðŸ˜’ This happens when your in love

I printed it followed by heavy refining work. Itâ€™s on Thingiverse I believe by @jackw

I know I saw them on thingiverse but I donâ€™t have 3D printed. And I checked for 3D printed services but I got really high quotes. Like $250 to print two enclosures like boosted board

@Torcn since you were suggesting CF, did you check @whitepony's thread about making super sleek enclosures for a vanguard with CF? That's basically is what I plan on doing, +stiffening the board with a few CF layers

I know that would be the best. @whitepony  boards are beautiful pieces of art. But I donâ€™t have the skill plus living in small apartment no chance to work with epoxy vacum infusion.

Did you check this thread? Ghetto vacuuming with a vacuum bag for clothes and a vacuum cleaner. It is really cheap to put in place. I also live in a small appartment, in Paris, but I think this is manageable :)

Try 3d hubs.   You can get prints for way way cheaper.

Yeah I plan on doing it that way, to (i) add 2 or 3 layers of CF to strenghten my deck and (ii) create CF split enclosure. I'll try next April/May :sunny: :slight_smile:

Dang. Canada is like on the other side of earth for me. Try to find some local on 3D hubs. Shipping will be a killer from me. 
Good luck!

Thank you anyway. I checked 3hubs for local printers but is still bit high. Better to go with eboosted enclosures
