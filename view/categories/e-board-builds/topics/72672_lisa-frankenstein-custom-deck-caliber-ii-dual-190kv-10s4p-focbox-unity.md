After hours of lurking this forum for research, purchasing a book on batteries, note taking, scouting out ideas during Renegade LV; I've decided that I'm ready to dip my toes into my first DIY Board. I don't have a time frame, and I really don't have a budget _[Tho base on the math I'm looking to spend at least $1,800]_. My plan is to just buy everything piece by piece and start putting everything together once I have enough.

Lisa Frankenstein? I want to build a Lisa Frank inspired board. I grew up loving the loud and colorful images that came with every notebook/folder/whathaveyou. Rainbows and leopard spots sounds perfect.

**My Goals**

* To succeed in building a working Esk8 as well as a good looking board; thus why I'm commissioning a custom from @treenutter. His stuff are works of art! 
* While speed isn't important to me, I would like some distance. I currently ride a Boosted 2nd Gen with extended batteries and I can easily say that it got smoked against the other boards when it came to distance.
* Larger wheels. I have "thrown off of board because of rocks and cracks" pobia. It wasn't fun the first time.
* Make the remote smaller. I saw a few boards on that topic.
* Hopefully later I'll be able to figure out how to route some power into [arduino controlled LEDs](https://github.com/ju-mpe-r/synchronized_lighting_for_vesc), but that will be after I get a working board.

**My Concerns**

* Will it all fit together? I'm pretty sure that the motors and the chosen trucks should work out. 
* I'm also worried about the belt being wrong as well.
* I'm still not 100% on battery knowledge, but I'll be using this as a learning process.

I'll be posting updates as things start rolling in, but until then I'm open to suggestions. If you have any questions about the build, please ask.

This is looking like a nice build, although I think some members might tell you off if you get the otang nipple bushings. For bushings the best place is riptide. They have just about every combo needed and if you need help you can speak with @Alphamail the owner

The diy motor mounts are not the best. @Boardnamics  have just dropped the price of their mounts so they will be cheaper and they have a better reputation for being very reliable, they are also made for caliber II and can be rear mounted.

@TheAwkwardLlama wow you are going to love this build, everything on your list is a major upgrade! You could consider wider trucks to give yourself a bit more space for mounting and stability at speed. There are the extended-width caliber 2s and of course our favorite: surfrodz! I agree you can't do better than riptide bushings and @Alphamail has tremendous experience that he generously shares about different setups.

_Will it all fit together? I’m pretty sure that the motors and the chosen trucks should work out._
-that should be fine, but that is the max motor setup for 180mm trucks. Check to make sure the mounts will allow it based on their width and spacing.

_I’m also worried about the belt being wrong as well._
-@psychotiller will sell you the right belts, given that the lengths of the mounts you use are compatible/similar. there are lots of places to get longer belts if needed. Don't worry about this.

_I’m still not 100% on battery knowledge, but I’ll be using this as a learning process._
-Buying a pre-built battery pack is a good first step. 10s4p 30q is a great setup for this build.

You're likely going to need to change some connectors and add some wiring to make it all work. If you have access to a soldering iron and have that skill, that is a good step to take. Perhaps you have a friend that can help you if you need to extend a cable to fit in your enclosure. Other things you might need access to are a hot glue gun, shrink wrap, heavy duty velcro, and a drill or cutting tools to make holes for your charge port and power button in the enclosure.

On a bad ass red ember deck, I think you should spring for Surfrodz RKPs or TKPs bought from psychotiller with his mounts while you are buying the Altar Wedge and 6 shooters.

Worth it. So worth it. Don't Let Lisa down and put middle-of-the-road trucks on a build as nice as this.

Thanks! I just found his thread on Set up Help. I'll head on over there to ask what's best for me.

Looks like two votes for Surfrodz, but I do get the point; longer trucks for more stability. I'll probably go forward with purchasing trucks from Psychotiller.

I consider myself still a beginner at soldering; but I do own a soldering iron, But if it's just wires I can totally do that. Everything else you've listed I either already have, or can easily make a Fry's trip if needed. :3

**=================**

Thank you everyone for the suggestions/recommendations. I'll updated my spreadsheet accordingly when I get back from work. I'll keep Boardnamics motor mounts in mind for later builds. ^.^

Great choices and looking forward to the finished article.  Its refreshing when someone does some serious research and reading and then puts forward informed inquiries.  Good luck with the build!

So while I'm waiting for the funds to buy more parts (got motors and pre-ordered Unity), I've been combing through more information on my free time and got stuck on a few things.

* I've figured out how to implement LEDs to my build, but what I haven't figured out is what type of wire is needed from the battery pack to the D.C convertor. To my understanding so far is that the higher the gauge (number) is the smaller the wire, and the lower the gauge (number) is the bigger the wire. I see a constant in people using 10awg when its on the battery side, so would I need to use that from the battery to the convertor? 

* Loop-Keys. I've notice some use them as on/offs, others as fail-safes to go along with the on/off button or switch, and some builds without them at all. I'm guessin' it's a preference?

My parts are starting to trickle in piece by piece. I very nearly got something to ride. :tada:

I've made some **Changes:**
Six Shooters => Haggy Bergmeister

And I still **Need:**
Battery
Deck

I decided that I'm going to build my own battery and have already started ordering the needed parts to do so. A friend in the community is willing to show me the way. While I'm waiting on the last of my stuff to get here, I'll be placing my mini remote into the Avio mod.
