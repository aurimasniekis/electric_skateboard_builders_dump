Made a bunch of changes recently which freed up a lot of time and a little bit of money, and since my job entails running cnc's figure it was about time to build me an electric longboard. The heavyweight is quite a suitable name since without batteries it weighs 18 lbs.

First was to take apart the sk6374's and figure out how I was going to mount these stators onto my roja hybrid hangers. Did not foresee a problem though since the hangers are cylindrical.

[url=http://s66.photobucket.com/user/naturesbrew/media/IMG_0638_zpsiboi3ryg.jpg.html][img]/uploads/db1493/original/1X/fe6b255057a9592c2b44b81cafae1b6ad34960a8.jpg[/img][/url]

Ended up making an axle extension that screws onto the hanger and slides into this recess in the stator

And as you can see, decided to put thermally conductive potting epoxy on my windings

The other side conveniently had three screws that I could use to fully secure the stator from movement, and ended up making a flange welded to the hanger to support everything

Made a plug for the can so that I could get the potting epoxy in between the magnets as well.

Decided that the original flange for the larger bearing was too flimsy, and it also needed to be a little wider so I could tap larger screws thru it to later on secure the liner which slides over the can and bonds the urethane. Also the tiny little bearing on the other side just would not do, so made a new flange which fits regular 608 bearings, and beefed it up a good deal.

Everything went together just as imagined

Had some urethane cored out for me and made some liners to bond them to. Ended up making the liners out of steel, it is a little heavier but far stronger and from what I understand thru asking about on the sphere, steel on the outside of the can helps keep the magnetism where it belongs which couldn't hurt

And with everything put together, it is looking pretty stealthy!!

Also decided to 3D print badwolfs enclosure for the gt2b

And that is where it rests for now. Am making a big move out to Australia come sept 20, and will be taking this with me and getting in touch with onloop about putting a space cell underneath the deck, as well as getting jacob to set me up with a couple of vesc's. Will keep updating this thread as everything comes together, and will take video of her maiden voyage!

Nice work! Putting the normal skate bearing into a beefier end cap was a smart move...

What ESC & Battery will you use? 

MAYBE Twin Vesc & S.P.A.C.E Cell

Did you document the process of making the modified Gt-2b.... that would be a great thread on here if you can show it being done step-by-step.

Specifically showing the mods (if any) to the pcb.
Comment of level of difficulty etc

EDIT: I made a new thread about it here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/build-your-own-compact-eboard-controller-gt2b-case-mod/104/1

You betcha, twin vesc's and a space cell! 

Did not document the modification of the gt-2b unfortunately, would have been a good idea, but it is very straight forward to do with badwolfs instructions on thingverse. (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:922378)
So much so that even me with a complete lack of experience with electrical was able to figure it out. 
One thing that I had to clarify with badwolf was regarding the resistors and how exactly they were set up. Basically if you look at the instructions and notice the highlighted three pins marked resistors, you take one leg of the 1st resistor and solder to the outside left pin, one leg of the 2nd resistor and solder to outside right pin, than connect the two free legs together to the middle pin. And that is about as complicated as it gets.
Afterwards I covered the entire thing in liquid tape to seal from the elements.

On a side note regarding the g2tb, do you know how the receiver is connected to the vesc? Noticed that Benjamin is focusing more on the wiireciever side of things.

...the GT-2B Connects using normal servo cable. you can see here how i did it for Dual VESC. But actually you dont need the servo splitter. The VESC can be connected via CANBUS for sync of two motors.

Wow, this is amazing. I've seen a few people make their own hub motors, but for those of us without access to CNC equipment it sure would be nice if somebody would start selling them. While I think I would prefer the flexibility of belt drive systems, direct drive is definitely something I want to feel for myself and be able to offer people for custom builds.
```

Thanks dude!

During the build had often thought about making a diy kit with some of the smaller parts that I made, something where you could buy your own motor take it apart and replace with the supplied parts. 
The only problem, other than leaving my job running the cnc's so I can go play with the kangaroos, is that everyone has their preferences of trucks they like to ride, and it is quite difficult to brace a motor properly using only the common 8mm shaft on typical trucks, and this is typically what people want out of a hub motor, the ability to take it on and off with ease. 
In my opinion the only sure way of doing a hub motor securely with the ability to take it on and off is to bolt on to a welded flange like I did, rather than epoxy or grub screws. And the only real good way of doing this is to use a truck with a round hanger like the roja hybrids.
That being said it will be interesting to see what Jacob does with his hub motors, and would like to try them out later on down the road, though the securement still seems sketchy to me, as the last thing you want is to have your motor come undone while braking down a hill or powering up one.

It seems like it should be possible to create some kind of bolt on bracket for these that the back of the motor can fasten to. Calibers would be a good candidate for this because of their hanger's D shape.  That would allow the whole assembly to slide over the axel and with the mods you made for the bearings it should just slip right on. From your experience here, does that sound like a possibility?
```

---
## \#11 Posted by: Wanderer Posted at: 2015-08-21T06:44:22.302Z Reads: 518

```
With a 6374 it would not be possible since the stator bore is far to small to slide over part of the hanger, unless you do what pediglide does and turn the hanger down to fit. If you don't position the motor over part of the hanger everything will stick out way to far to be practical. 
If you could get a custom stator made with the internal bore large enough that it could slide over part of the hanger, as well as making the stator flange with the three holes larger to accommodate the larger bore, than having a bolt on flange to mate to the stator, and an axle extension like my build, would definitely work. But then this moves away from off the shelf parts for the hobbyist. 
The only real way of using the 6374 for a hub motor is to turn a hanger down, or find a hanger small enough to slide into the stator bore, this is is where the rojas hybrid is ideal.
Now that you got me pondering this though, someone really should start looking into an approach like what you mentioned. Building a hub motor kit that fits any truck would be pretty slick!

```
It's quite an interesting problem for sure. Custom stators aren't exactly cheap, either, since they're basically laminated steel of a very particular type that has particular magnetic properties. 

Something else that might work is an already shorter hanger with the axle bolts replaced with longer ones. I know Independent makes some really short hangars, but i think their axels are pressed in, not screwed in like some of these precision trucks are, and the profile is kind of wrong for this anyway. Just a thought though. Of course CNCing your own hangers is also a possibility if you're already machining  some of the other parts anyway. You could then sell a kit that would let you assemble it all without having to weld anything.

Thanks Man!

Had planned on doing 4wd in the beginning of this all, but ended up deciding not to based on the overall cost and weight of it all. Right now everything said and done without battery and vesc it weighs 18lbs, with two extra hub motors it would likely be 23lbs without battery and vesc. And than it would have cost another 400 just to do it.

Think I will be more than happy with two motors.

Will be using the spacecell from enertion and strapping it under the deck. Have 3.5 inches of clearance still.

Ordered a vacuum bag kit from roarockit as well as some carbon fiber to add some strength back into the deck, the material wont be in tell next week, but thought I would upload a picture of what I did on the cnc at work today. Will add some more pictures of the layup within a couple weeks.

Nope, ordered the deck from the same company that makes the adjustable brackets. 

Thinking about it now, it would have made more sense to make it myself from scratch, and probably a little cheaper, now that I am customizing it the way I am. Oh well, live and learn!

So any timeline for this new bigger space cell you have in the works? Will likely be ready to order by the end of the month.

Supplies came in yesterday and immediately started laying fiber, unfortunately did not have a lot of time from getting off work, tell too dark to work to sneak in any pictures of the process, am in a mad rush to get this done before friday. 

So far everything has been going fairly smoothly, aside from the vacuum bag being a real pain to work with as it is so thick and does not like to give. Am hoping this last layup I did tonight will be the final, and if it is will have used 6 layers of carbon fiber. Three layers isolated in the battery space and three full layers covering the entire deck. Am a little curious to see how this last layup will turn out since I did 4 layers at a time, and putting the layup into the bag was a bit tricky....it will likely have a few imperfections in the final result, but am not overly concerned since it is not for form but simply for function.

Heres the only picture I got of the second layup already in the bag

And here is another picture of what I made at work the last couple days.

It is far from perfect cosmetically, and now that I have done this a couple times would do it a lot differently...the biggest thing would be not being in such a rush to get it done! 

Will have a bit of work in a couple areas, but considering this will have a layer of paint over it, think everything turned out well.

Threaded extension onto existing bolt, or weld in a new bolt extension?  More info - how wide did you go?

Is your trailer going to be just the one truck at the back with wheels and front attached to your "hitch" or something mid-mount like a regular car trailer?

Yep, just threads on.

Wouldn't suggest doing this to any truck that is being ridden normally though, cast trucks are notorious for bending as it is, and the added leverage will do it that much quicker, since this is only being used for a trailer there should be no problems. 180mm to 256mm

Am just doing one truck at the back wheels, wont ever being loading more than 60lbs so should be fine.

Small update, still not electric..... but am slowly reinforcing the deck to make it stiff as possible. Ordered some 6K carbon twill, this stuff is incredibly thick compared to the unidirectional carbon I was using previous, pretty sure if I had of used this stuff off the bat this deck would be the desired stiffness. Oh well, live and learn. At least now I have a real nice enclosure area for the larger space cell that onloop will hopefully be selling soon.

@kai In order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds i am asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.

Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as 
**"new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb"** this becomes hard to keep track of.

I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;
**Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC**

Example
**The Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks |  R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC**

Did not turn out perfect but am more than happy with the results as the deck is now stiff as!

Am not to sure actually, and no scale in the house to check. The name of this build definitely still holds true though! And it will be getting heavier still, now that I have decided to go the all wheel drive route.

 Just thought I'd mention that the unidirectional carbon that you used is generally stronger by weight, compared to bidirectional weaves like the 6k you used.

It takes engineering to take advantage of that strength, which is huge in tension.  it seem like you may have layed up a flat plate of unicarbon, and as such that would have very little resistance to torsion. 

https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=48651&start=25

Having your 3D shape on the bottom will improve stiffness to weight, and 30, 60 or 45 degree bias orientation also is necessary.
```

Yea that's why I got the unidirectional in the first place, figured it would work out to be stronger, but like you mentioned it definitely needed to be layed up properly to gain the strength. When reading about it, there was mention that the reason why it is stronger compared to 6k is because there are no overlaps, which is not good for torsional strength. Could have been that I simply needed more layers, or more than likely to do more than just a 45 degree bias. In the end, what really helped gain stiffness was the hardwood pieces that I put down to make the enclosure for the battery. Finally took the board out for a ride yesterday, and it was at the perfect stiffness.

That deck in the link you posted is a beauty!

It's the outside that determines stiffness, for most all cases.  Any carbon that's not the outermost layer,  is just kind of expensive but not adding strength. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_box 

If the core is lightweight  that's generally preferable too. Structures like bicycles are hollow, and they barely sacrifice any strength and can still be made incredibly stiff.

Ideally time and resources would have been on my side and I would have made a negative mold so that it all could have been done in one layup. The result with doing it the way I did is a heavier product but am happy with it non the less :-)

 I'm not trying to knock you, I'm just trying to add value for others who might be reading. It's all about learning.

It would've taken the same amount of time and less resources, with a layup that put the carbon on the thickest part to start with.  

Start with wood, cedar/balsa for the battery box sides... Put your carbon over that.  Leave the inside bare or if it feels soft a couple of narrow strips Uni carbon.

Do you know how to calculate the top speed/range for a hub motor?

All the top speed calculators have a gear ratio but the hub motors have no gears....

low if you have hills in your area and were using an enertion SPACE cell,
would double hub motors be enough? or would external motors be better. 

I heard with the enertion and high current means the hub motors won't get too hot going up hill especially with 2 of them. 

Basically which one would get me up hills, have longer range and top speed.

well think of riding a bike up a hill. if you drop in to a lower gear its easier to go up the hill.
however if you stay in high gear you can still ride up the hill but you gotta push harder.

hub motors are always at 1:1 gear ratio so they are working harder to go up a hill than the same spec motor geared down to say 2.5:1

gearing down always gives more torque.

You could also increase the diameter of the hub motor to get more torque. I am waiting for a decent hub motor for a MTB in wheel application as they have large diameter wheels and would make sense to use them there.

 As you make the hub motor bigger, you make the wheel necessarily bigger as well,  so that works out about even for torque, except you have even more rotating mass which is generally a negative.

Just be careful with the battery current setting in the VESC, the max battery current for each VESC needs to be at about 10, at least to start with. Maybe creep this up until you start blowing fuses.

Someone has done it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68NUrx42WvY

Don't work at the machine shop any longer so do not have a cnc at my disposal, so building my own pneumatic hub is out of the question now. Will have to wait for someone else to do it. Always thought it would make sense to have the motor can of the hubmotor have a bead for rubber tires rather than trying to figure out good ways to mount urethane, with the added plus of having a cushion of air to keep some road vibration from wearing away the motors. Nice thing about urethane though, is it lasts much longer and has less rolling resistance.

I see. I agree that the major drawback of a hub motor and urethane is the vibration would make the motor demagnetize faster. Thats always been my concern switching into hub motors. Now I am even more in doubt into replacing my belt drive into hub. I will just do it I guess :D

Refer to the properties of Magnets, magnetism is the affect of aligning metal magnetic dipoles within atomic structures. Hence anything that might / destroy their molecular structures would eventually demagnetized magnets. This involve hammering, vibrations and heat. All of these aspects would literally have an impact of altering the magnetical properties of a metal. Heating it's self is an act of vibrating molecules which is as equal to vibration the molecules it's self physically.

Ha....6 months later and nothing to show for it. 

Sold the space cell and was waiting for a custom battery deck to be made for me from chaka but plans fell through, the good man is incredibly busy with a growing business and he was hoping to build it for me, but time gets the best of everyone sometimes. 

Was hoping for Jacobs 107mm thane to be done for his hubs as well but he does not want to send them until everything is up to spec, which is completely understandable. 

So am currently deciding what to do now. 

Am thinking I will likely have someone make me a custom battery pack for the empty space in the deck and at least get my custom hubs going until Jacobs are ready rock. Have 4 of them just waiting for some juice!

The reason why I ultimately decided not to use my hubs was because of the weight of them, and the likely possibility of them getting hot from the thermally conductive epoxy....and I craved awd....and dont have access to cncs any longer.


Anyone in Canada wanna build me a custom battery pack?

So a few people are wondering what ever happened to this build

Money has been sidetracked and directed into a growing soil restoration business, so have not had the resources to do anything with it. Still have the set up aside from battery and esc. Was wanting to go awd back in the day, but if I ever do get around to getting the setup going will stick to 2wd and use the hubmotors I built....never did get a chance to get power to them to see how they worked. So will run them tell they fall apart and later see about checking out some different options since I do not work with cnc's any longer.

So many options on the market these days! 

Anyways just wanted to let you all know why it was never finished, and that maybe someday it will see some life.

Anyways back I go to observing from the sidelines!

Peace
