Hello!
I'm looking to build an electric skateboard as a side project during school, but would like advice on the build before I buy. I put together a parts list but am not sure about the battery or motor size. I'm afraid the batteries may be overkill and am unsure of the kv for the motor. The most distance I would need would be around 4 miles (though more would not hurt), desired speed: ~25 mph or 40 kmh.
Motor: [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192KV Brushless Outrunner Motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)
VESC: [TORQUE VESC](products/torque-esc-vesc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller)
Mechanics: [SINGLE BOLT ON MOTOR MOUNT W/ DRIVE WHEEL KIT, 16T motor pulley, 63mm motor mount.](collections/electric-skateboard-motor-mounts/products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-w-drive-wheel-kit)
Wheels: 90mm flywheel clones (Blank Pro)
Controller: [2.4Ghz Remote Controller from Psychotiller](https://psychotiller.com/product/24ghz-remote-controller)
Battery: TWO [Turnigy nano-tech 2650mah 6S 45~90C Lipo Pack w/XT-60](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-nano-tech-2650mah-6s-45-90c-lipo-pack-xt-60.html) in series.
