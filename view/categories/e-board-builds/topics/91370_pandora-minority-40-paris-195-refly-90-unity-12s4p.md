-----------

PARTS: ~$1000 for everything in the current version
- Minority 40" drop deck
- Paris II 195mm trucks
- ABEC 11 90mm ReFlys / MBS 100mm ATs
- Focbox Unity
- 12s4p 30Q
- 12x ABS cell holders
- BesTech 80A BMS w/ e-switch
- YZ Power 8A charger
- dual MayTech 6355 170kv sealed motors
- DickyHo Paris II mounts (test batch)
- 15:44 15mm pulleys
- Mini RC remote

------------

STATS (ReFlys/MBS):
- Speed: 28/31mph (charged) to 20/22mph (drained)
- Range*: 58/47mi (eco) to 25/20mi (sport)
- Power: 6kw (charged burst) to 3kw (drained continuous)
- Weight: 22lbs (estimate)

*Based on experimental efficiency with dual hubs (Elpis build)

------------

The cells came from a forum member when he left the hobby and it was his first battery so they aren't looking to hot, but they were cheap and only had 4 cycles so like...

Not sure how I'm implementing the cell holders, gonna test if I can reenforce them with 10awg silicone wire on the tops and suspend them from the deck so the cells stay in (I'm using a small board with the same holders and they seem okay)

If they cell holders don't work I'm gonna crush the steel out and use them to hold welded nickel tabs in place, probably gonna use a car battery and jumper cables and a welder...don't ask how, you won't like the answer

Probably using sheet metal for the enclosure..take some of the flex out and make it super resistant to impact, obviously gonna use insulation between it and the electronics

-----------------

FUTURE UPGRADES:
- 9:21 #35 chain hearing with custom Paris mounts (lathing hangars down)
- 60W of addressable LED underglow, the highest density pixles I can find
- steel crash bar with 30W of LED headlights
- Arduino professor for lights and remote, think of a FireFly remote with a 9 axis accelerometer and buttons for underglow controls
- CF skin enclosure, keeping some steel in there for added strength since I will carve out channels for the electronics
- a new deck if... 1) I can't get clearance with risers (already can't)  and/or 2) I run out of space under this one (already have)

-----------

FUN FACTS:
- the bullets on a Unity fit perfectly with a male
AMASS MT60 male connector
- 15:44 is about the highest ratio you can get on these mounts
- 100mm MBS wheels leave more room for pulleys than 90mm ABECs

Well im glad it will finally see some use. Btw those cell holders are rated for about 5a. They contacts will lose their electroplating from the vibration of the board. At that point they wont conduct nearly as well. Be careful with your current limits

I've been using them at 10A and they look the same but I doubt they will take the 20 to 30 amps from the 30Q, gonna solder to the top of the tabs where the material is thicker or use nickel tabs on the cells and the steel of the holders will just keep them in place

LOOT DAY!!

Just got the MBS wheels with some race bearings and the motor mounts...good new is the wheels are fucking DOPE...bad news is nothing fits.  The Paris mounts fit the trucks (sort of, gotta lathe the hangar down to take the paint off) and the motor (still sort of, gotta file down the corners and the screw slots) but there isn't enough space for everything...I'm about 11mm short on each side, I can recover 8mm on each side by putting a grub screw in the middle of the motor pulley and using counter sink screws to hold the motor but that still leaves me short 3mm, I can't extend the axles because Paris II and the bearings on the MBS wheels leave about half a thread of axle exposed with the speed washers.

I don't know what to do, I really don't want to buy a TB 218 and matching mounts because they are expensive (tested with my friends and it will work without mods, about 1mm to spare) and I can't have diagonal mounts because its a drop deck, the curve sits to close
```

Good news, I think I can fit everything!

The gap between the MBS wheels is a hair over 170mm and the outer width of the 2 motor/mount/pulley blocks is a hair under 188mm; if I can cut out 9mm on each side it will fit in theory.  If I take off 2mm for the outer motor pulley wall which over hangs the wheel and the 8mm taken by the screws and collar I get a mil to spare.  I can swap back to the ABEC 11s since there is some spare axle for an extra speed washer as a spacer.

Worst case is I twist the mounts so one of the can bearings sits above the other which is kinda awful or I do a diagonal setup which woukd absolutely suck.  Luckily there is just enough clearance for the motors to sit under the deck with the 90mm wheels and no spacers.  If I plan for some heavier AT I'll swap the wheels and add 1/2" risers

- Inner wheel distance: 171mm
- Outer assembly distance: 188mm
- Reclaimable distance per side: 10mm

In theory I can bring the motor assembly down to 168mm which is all the clearance I need and I can add another 2mm of clearance to the wheel distance with another speed washer on each wheel (I have one on the outside of the wheel but the race bearings have integral washers so I can move it over, can't add a third because I'm out of threads on the axle).  The ABEC 11s give me a little more freedom since I can move them about 3mm out each even though I loose 1mm to the overhang on the urethane

Thoughts on using...to hold a motor to a mount (4.25mm aluminum)?  Needs to be flush with mount face

A) an 82 degree countersink bit to make countersink slots
B) low profile (2mm thick head) socket screws


Thoughts on replacing the 2 grub screws with M3 screws and driving them into the hangar surface?

Another day and another flow of thoughts!!

Looked into getting a super wide 10"+ deck to redo my batteries in a 3x4 configuration but for the amount of money and work, it's not worth it.  Sticking with 2x6 cell holders in the front and the Unity/HX223 in the back, tossing the wires/connectors/receiver/Arduni (going with micro) down the middle.  There should be 20mm for the electronics channel, 5mm each side for the enclosure walls, and 15mm each side for the mounting tabs.  I'll be able to run the LEDs on riser shields along the edge and slot a handle in somewhere.  I should get the enclosure outer face within 30mm of the deck, leaving 50mm of ground clearance (not counting weight deflection, shouldn't be more than 10mm static and 30mm dynamic)

Gonna stick with the plan to lathe the hangars, trim the motor pulleys, and chamfer slot the mounts.  Gonna pin the mounts through the hanger, can't risk them coming loose.  I'm gonna get the dual 15mm belts and on the motors, and tuck it all under the deck with the cans concentric...AESTHETICS DAMMIT

The only exposed parts will be an inch of wires from the motor to the enclosure and the dual buck converters, which are 3" x 3" each.  Tossing them on the top and mounting via the truck hardware until I get a rear bull bar with tail lights

Took a stroll down to my local tool supplier and guess what I found...8" pnumo wheels for only $8 each!!  One day I think I will get a set of those and new trucks to make Pandora an AT longboard...they are fairly light and the bearing stack is bolted on so making an adapter should be easy

Other news, hit up DickyHo again for more bits and parts, upgrading to steel motor pulleys with key slots rather than fucking with making my own taped holes for the grub screws.  Also gonna pick up more wheel pulleys and belts, 36T pulleys for ABEC FlyWheels and 290mm x 11mm belts for them.  Top speed on the FlyWheels should be 34mph now, a real racer!!

How much light is to much?  Looking at 43W (~2000 lumens) of addressable RGB LED under glow and 38W (4200 lumens), running off a 5V 10A and 12V 10A step down off the main battery respectively.  Will this be the brightest skateboard in history?

After fucking with 9/16" wrenches in back pockets to adjust trucks and losing my 1/2" ratchet, I made a custom skate pendant inspired by another member here.  It's made specifically to fit the mounting plates for ABEC style cores, and it's the bare minimum size to use because it's something I'm gonna wear all the time.  The loop serves as leverage and is on the 9/16" side so the 1/2" can fit in the wheel and over the bolt heads, and you get more control when tightening trucks.

The loop is just some paracord held with a shrink wrap tube, currently it holds my ear buds in place

Update day!!

Put the belt assembly partly together and it fits!  It's a fucking pain to get the belt to get in place but the tension is good.

Still worried about the width, worst case is I trim the belts a mil or so.  Can't be sure until I lathe the hangar, currently the mount sits to far up.

Ground clearance is kinda sketch, with the MBS 100mm AT wheels I get 12mm from flat ground to the bottom of the can, the ABEC 90mm ReFly wheels should put it at 7mm.  I think I will use a riser block, it won't help with wires so probably a stock 1/2" riser.  Alternative is I reverse the mounts but I'd rather not TBH, they will sit at 37mm and 32mm reversed without risers.

Chapter 2: the off-road longboard!

The MBS wheels are nice and all but they are more fit for hard packed dirt than gravel hills and forest, so here comes the true AT variant with 8” pneumatics and a staggering 375N or pushing force, enough to accelerate my scrawny ass at 0.53G (but a nominal top speed of only 27mph assuming 75% efficiency)

Long after the street/light AT variant is done I will gut it for parts to make a new longboard with 200x50 pneumatics and bigger trucks, the gear ratio will be 15:72 on the same 170kv 12s system

The plan is to modify DickyHo’s basic off-road setup to accept his 8” wheels or get a pair of TB218s with some new mounts and mod them.  Due to wheel bite and ground clearance I will have a new shorter but wider deck and properly weld my battery, also some foot straps so I don’t fall off all the time

I know I don’t need an off-road setup but I really want it, the roads near me are pretty shitty and torque is so enticing

——————————

Maybe I will make a new board, 130kv motors and a lipo battery, but I’m not sure

We got lights!!  They are running off the stock batteries still (only 17ish watts) so I will try running off a power supply later, in theory I can get them to accept 60W

Mounting is ‘temporary’ since it’s on my old board still

Belts are still kinda slack, it’s loose enough that I can just barely slide the wheel into the belt, that is the farthest in the motor sits and if I go up a belt size it doesn’t fit

Finished the main leads of the battery (forgot to order 20awg silicone wire for the balance), it’s got a little bit of flex to it but it feels stable

With the BMS and ESC it sits at 60 by 18 cm, it will be about 30mm tall with the cells and neoprene 

Each line is 10awg silicons wire with a ton of solder to the top of the contacts, maybe 5mm of the contacts and 4mm of solder before the wire so it should be okay for 20A if the contact patch doesn’t melt

In other news stripping and soldering the middle 10awg 100x in a row is a PAIN IN THE ASS, you’re looking at about 4+ hours with a knife and iron, but it came out well with no fuck ups

Not sure how to route the wires at the end but I’ll manage, I can save space by running the stock Unity wires through the BMS since it’s double layered.  I will have extenders that mount to the enclosure with 5.5 bullets but the other end is still the 3.5 bullets.  If I shrink wrap the connector so it’s smooth and line the BMS with kapton tape it should be safe

The most compact with all the leads in is 166mm wide but not 100% on length because the extensions, not counting them it’s 127mm (The power wire on the Unity sticks out)

I may replace the Untity wires with new 14awg (if I go up a size I can’t use 3.5mm bullets, and 4.0mm bullets don’t fit the far end with the e-switch wires) then I can just silicone the wires through the enclosure and call it a day

Hit the robotics lab to steal some time on the lathe to fix the trucks and I think I fucked them up...had to cut reliefs in the mounts so they had the clamping pressure but they seem stable for now, one is a little bent so the belt rubs the wheel but it seems like it will not be an issue

In other news I think I'm gonna use the 31" deck for a little bit, working on some plastic rises to bring the base plate angle from 70 degrees back down to 50 degrees.  I have about 3/8ths of an inch between the trucks and electronics using the sled and Unity in a flat configuration.  Just got some neoprene foam sheet so I can insulate the electronics from the enclosure (1/32" galvanized sheet steel), gonna bolt it as a box to the deck so it won't be pretty but it will go on fast and be safe

Not gonna buy them for a while but I think I will get some WFB 88a duro Riptide cones for the trucks, I'm to light and unbalanced to get a turning radius any other way so its gotta happen eventually

Loot day!!

Got the 0.25" x 15" x 60" neoprene foam rubber and the 3x 15' 22awg silicone copper wire in the mail today, bad news is what arrived isn't what I paid for, good news is its better.  Wires look fine but the neoprene is substantially thicker than 0.25", definitely less than 0.5" so I'm guessing its 0.375"...anyways its better and the upgrade was free.  I will use it to insulate the electronics from water, short circuits with the enclosure (sheet steel box), and vibration...should be very safe since I will use a single cross shaped section with folds to make the bottom 5 sides of a box (electronics sit in foam and foam sits in metal, no mounting to the deck) and another large piece that gets squished against the enclosure rim and deck to protect the top of the electronics and seal everything.  Wires will just get sandwiched in the foam and coated with silicone on the outside until I get some nice printed inserts for a pair of MT60s and their corresponding sensors (port and extensions will be epoxied into the print)

Research update!

Once the main drive is running, I will be converting the 'mtb' deck into a real off-road build with a 290mm TKP hanger setup and 8" pneumatic tires from DickyHo.  I will be using the [6" TKP kit](https://www.ebay.com/itm/TPK-6X2-pneumatic-offroad-setup-drive-kit-for-electric-skateboard-longboard/401769500339?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20160908105057%26meid%3D068b08829cb9498588b752533c1bede2%26pid%3D100675%26rk%3D4%26rkt%3D15%26sd%3D183812401347%26itm%3D401769500339&_trksid=p2481888.c100675.m4236&_trkparms=pageci%3A379add87-7a71-11e9-b635-74dbd1807c67%7Cparentrq%3Ad1b175e416a0aadc417631a8fff31697%7Ciid%3A1) with the original trucks/mounts/crossbar/hardware/etc but I am replacing the wheels with bigger [8" tires](https://www.ebay.com/itm/8-inch-200X50-inflatable-tire-for-electric-skateboard-longboard-with-72T-pulley/303037096888).  The only mods are lathing down 10mm of the hanger away on each side but that still leaves me with 190mm for the motors, so I could get a pair of 6384 motors on this if I could afford them.  I checked the numbers for the mounts and I will probably lose the threaded rod support and idler bearings but I can keep the outer cross bar

Not yet, but for me it will be okay since I'm really light and the tires will take up a lot of the impact (which will be primarily small bumps on sidewalks or sticks in the grass)

Gonna do some SCIENCE!!

Picked up a pair of lightly used channel trucks for $20, found it on OfferUp for a 20 minute drive.  When I get the off-road kit I might use these instead

Anyone recognize the make of them?

We love spending more money on parts we don't need...

Set of parts 1 - preparations for a MTB, eventually I'll get around to buying the 8" TKP pneumo setup for it and until then I'll use channel trucks with long board wheels

Set of parts 2: hella underglow, were looking at 43W of rainbow lighting, going with a cheap controller until I get the Arduino stuff sorted
