Hi All, stoked to be here. I started my esk8 journey on an Evolve BGT, but soon realised that I wanted more.

Sold the BGT to fund this here build, so I‚Äôll be bipedal for a while. On to greater things!

Current build list, (street use):
Trampa 35* HolyPro 16 ply deck
12mm Vertigo hollow axle trucks
Superstar wheels with 6.5‚Äù Urban Treads
Ratchet bindings (possibly with heel straps)
E-toxx Mini Dual Direct Drive (straight cut gears)
E-toxx bumper x 2
Alien APS 6384S 170KV motor x 2
HobbyWing Ezrun Max6 ESC x 2
Turnigy Nanotech 5,000mah 6S 45~90C
No BMS, using balance charger (recommendations?)
FlySky GT2B Transmitter with Mad Munky mod
10ga wiring to put it all together, probably Nomex sleeved

I‚Äôm planning to have the ESCs and battery at the front to compensate somewhat for drivetrain weight at the back.

Any thoughts and recommendations are welcome, especially around my No BMS plans. I‚Äôd like to keep this build as light and clean as possible.

Ordered the Trampa with Vertigos, E-toxx parts, plus an extra Trampa Infinity shipped to @Nowind for machining, as well as the Max6 ESCs, GT2B and wiring I think I need.

Decided to go for 2x Turnigy Graphene 6,000mAh 4S 65~130C batteries instead, which left me wondering which balance charger to get? A Turnigy Reaktor? Which one? Something else?

There are a lot of chargers outside.
Depends on how much money you want to spend, how fast you want to charge and if you want to charge more than one pack at the same time. Don‚Äôt forget that for the hk Reaktor you need a separate power supply unit too. Just that add some money on top too.
If you look for a cheap and easy but good charger than go with the I charger b6. They about 30-35‚Ç¨. There a AC version which has a power supply inside, or the version with external laptop brick. You can balance charge up to 6s and max 5a.

I have a Junsi 4010DUO, using it since years.... choosed the 10S one because i got many 10S Bricks from the E-Drift-Trikes... the junsi is pricey but you get 1A hardware IMO.
Dont forget that you need also a good power adapter, for full performance 24V output.
I love my junsi but they are also many cheaper options ....

so you are going to assemble a 12s2p lipo battery with 10000 mah and 50.4 volts right?so x4 lipo 6s or just 2 lipo so 12s 5000 mah? mmmmh if you don't have a lipo charger maybe it should be cheaper and more reliable to use a bms charge only, there are a tons of charger and with something like 60/80 dollars maybe less you will buy a good quality 12s bms and a good quality charger... a bms charge only is like 40/50 grams maybe. Also if you save money on charger for lipo you can invest in a vesc 6/escape/focbox unity/focbox cooled or something that can handle a lot of amps if you like the power!! but on the street so much power maybe it's an overkill. and also another thing, if you have foot straps you will mount your battery case in the middle of the board or under like a urban carver... and escs must be rear positioned since you can't make motor cables too long this is important!

Welcome :smile:  You should make a research on kv of the motors and how combine the kv to the voltage of the battery, and the erpm limit.
If you choose a 8s with a 170 kv motor you will have a very high torque but a very low maximum  speed, so it depends on what you want! Make a check with esk8calc...
IMO The battery you choose it‚Äôs not correct.
 graphene are really expensive because of their performance but for your first build maybe you need not so much amps, and very low capacity, it means less time of fun! 
That battery is rated for 65 C, 65x6= 390 amps constant ahhaha it‚Äôs way exagerate for a dual drive! And it‚Äôs a sacrifice of capacity 
I don‚Äô,t know very well the esc you choose but someone on the forum is using that...

Actually it‚Äôs not totally right...üò¨
The C-rating is not a standard and the formula c*capasity= const current is what people say but in real live situation more or less only half of what would be the calculation. There is a device with which you can measure the real constant amps your battery can handle, it‚Äôs this device
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/wayne-giles-designed-universal-esr-meter-for-100-10000mah-1-6-cell-lipo.html

In my opinion it‚Äôs never bad to investigate in good batteries. @malJohann The graphen lipos shown to be reliable and stable also after many charging cycles. The higher C the less voltage sag you get. This results in better performance and longer range in the end. Less stress for the battery means your lipos will last longer.
For a MTB I wouldn‚Äôt go under 60c 5ah, especially if you go low voltage like 6-8s as with it you usually need more amps out of your pack to get the same performance like you would get with a 10-12s.

I don¬¥t own a Max6 esc but this is what I found on the first google search result
‚Ä¢Steckersystem Akku: T-Stecker / Dean
‚Ä¢Buchsensystem Motor: 6,5mm Goldkontakt

Yes it¬¥s German ;) But I guess you get it.
The input wires I just would cut the plug and solder a xt90 anti spark on it. Most easy way as your batteries have xt90 too.
The APS motors coming with a 5.5mm bullet connector.
So I guess you need some 6.5mm male bullet connectors and change them on your APS motors (or make an adapter 6.6 to 5.5)

But it‚Äôs only anti spark, nothing written about a fuse. As min not in the picture you posted.
Fuse should save you from short the battery or the esc. The antispark just kills the spark which can appear while connecting a battery to the esc.

the system as stated protects both battery and esc, you literally can't have a functional ' anti spark system' without  some kind of fuse component or something that does a similar job of a fuse, as iv said, iv literally been using these escs as standard without any problems for over a year.

The switches ( similar to what the max6 uses) are obviously a lot more advanced than a loop key hence why the Vedder Anti-Spark switches are very expensive. Im sure theres a thread about the differences between the 2.

## \#41 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-09-06T16:07:59.520Z Reads: 194

The vedder switch based on mosfets.
All this anti spark e-switched have a fuse in line or as min a holder for it. The vedder anti spark don‚Äôt replace a fuse. 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vedder-anti-spark-switch-v1-3-kit-currently-out-of-stock/9949?u=andy87

If the mosfet blow than usually there gates stay open and your board always switched on. 
Still don‚Äôt get the argument why not to use a fuse?

A fuse should save your components from getting broke by burn before your esc or battery burn.
Did you burn one of that fuses in your max6?
And if yes how you can replace it?
If you can‚Äôt replace it than your max6 is fucked non the less, so a external fuse would solve that problem.

If i‚Äòm wrong please put me in the right direction!

What you want to know about it?
Just first dip the 10awg in solder than fill up the xt plug with solder, heat up everything together again and put things together.

If you think you have a problem that the 10awg will splice up, you can use a small thin copper wire or one braid of a spare awg peace. Than twist it around the end to tighten up all braids of your 10awg than proceed like described before.

I soldered 8awg easy to a xt90 like this.
Hope you understood my explanation üòÖ it‚Äôs easy but with my English not so easy to explain...

Get something like this with 60-100w
https://www.amazon.com/Choice-CH-IRON-100W-soldering/dp/B00XK5RXKC

it‚Äôs massive but for wires or nickel it does a very good job.
Use a 60/40 solder (more easy if it‚Äôs not lead free). Eboosted recommended 63/37 for nickel, but I never tried so far.

About flux, just look what‚Äôs written on what you already have, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs paste or liquid. I just asked in my local electric shop about the right flux for connecting copper.

you could use them as connector on the VESCs but as battery connector, better stay with the xt90s.

there is no xt60 anti spark plug.

With wires and connectors you can never by too big.
if you have the space for xt90 than use it.
probably it would work too, but it¬¥s not so nice to solder 10awg wires on a xt60 too.

Do you mean on the front top of the deck?
That would mean endless phase wires, I had 85cm with ESC's in the middle, that worked.

I like the idea of placing the ESC's next to the battery so you don't need extra caps but I recommend mounting everything in the middle of the board, especially when you use bindings.

The whole weight of your drivetrain and motors are on the rear truck and not on the rear of the deck.  If you put weight on the tip of your deck the riding experience will be strange IMO. Middle position on the the deck is best for riding but carrying is a different thing :wink:

Motor direction isn‚Äôt a big deal, even if you connected it up and the motors spun the wrong way there‚Äôs a setting on the max6 where you can change which direction they spin (either clockwise or anti clockwise). And as others have advised its not recommended to have too long phase wires so ideally you wanna keep the Escs on the back.

I do not recommend you Anderson pp45 for that. They can deal with more than 45 amps but they can move slightly due to vibrations.
If one of them gets out a couple mm they will arc and burn unless you put them together firmly.
I usually shrink them
Powerpole 75 will not move at all and they resist way beyond 100 amps. They are rather Big though. I'd stick to xt90's for esk8.

Yes sure you need to heat up the head shrink üòÖ
But you can use everything which makes things hot. Hair dryer or a light or the tip of your solder iron (don‚Äôt touch just hold close) should work fine.
About the wire mesh... it depends if you want to cover them all single or all in one tube.

Edit: I used 10mm for one motor wire. But I think you can get there two or even 3 motor wires inside. (3 would be tight thou)

Make sure you remember to use LocTite on all those screws on the DD and also get some SuGru to fill in the void, just like on the video that @Nowind posted on his website. 
I woke with a fright last night as I remembered about the SuGru - I had forgotten to use it. Stripped it down today and added it. Luckily, there wasn't a great deal of crap in the housing. I'm also using a "Berulub" grease on the gears and so far, it looks to be working very well. Still a little noisy, but nowhere near as loud as some of the others I have heard.

It powers up! I also added the TPU drive guards, after getting the M4x8mm bolts I was after.

Now to make the wiring look acceptably neat, build the remote into its smaller casing, and do the anti-puncture and balancing of the wheels.

Did my first morning commute to the train station. Sounds like I‚Äôm from the future with these ESCs! High speed stability suffered a little with the green dampas, but turning radius still sucks. I see some @Nowind elastomere replacements in my near future.

Acceleration is truly brutal, be respectful of technology level brutal. I‚Äôm going to be learning better trigger control, but can already see that I‚Äôll be creating a PWM controller soon. I can at least code (17 years experience), so maybe it‚Äôll be a holiday project.

Brakes are good except at low speed, doesn‚Äôt come to a full stop, wonder if the drag brake setting can sort this out. I had a little bump with a pole due to this and the poor turning radius, lucky it was only like 3km/h and I have the e-toxx bumper.

This is what I should have done from the start, NO comparison to the Evolve BGT. For one, I can fly up a hill, so much better than sagging up a hill. I have a 26% gradient hill just before I‚Äôm home, so it‚Äôs important.

Question, does the Max6 ESC convert braking into noise and heat? Because I had full brakes on a full charge, so assuming its not regenerative.

So, my ESC cut power on me today, low voltage cutoff setting on Auto(High). I got off immediately and switched the board off.

Now some say that even that setting is not good enough with Max6 ESCs, but my two packs were 14.05V and 14.58V when I plugged them into the B6AC chargers.

So for 4S that means all cells are above 3.5V, which means it is safe? Should I still get a voltage monitor? If so, which one?

Plus dont necessarily trust the readings you get from your charger certainly at the beginning of a charge since  the balancing mostly takes place towards the end of the charge! if your batteries were 14.05V and 14.58V according to the charger its likely in reality they were probably a bit lower!

Having a calibration issue with my TX / RX / ESC. Having followed the Max6 calibration procedure correctly, my brakes engage when throttle is only lightly reversed. The trigger feels overly sensitive and dangerous.

About 25% travel to the braking side gives full brakes and a green light. Further than that ESC lights turn red and I sometimes get reverse, while full travel sees light go off. Applying full throttle get‚Äôs green.

@Nowind you have a lot of experience with these, could it be remote throttle trim? Why would the lights on my ESCs go off at full brake position?

I‚Äôll have to connect my WiFi programmer to check, but from memory I only changed mode to Fwd+Brake, battery cutoff to Auto(High), and the direction of one of the motors.

Not many settings on these ESCs, unlike the VESC based ones. Plenty of power and torque throughput though. Very basic beasts these.

What do I do to protect my batteries from over discharge? Go only 4km instead of the 7km it runs to cutoff, so I‚Äôm not running them right down.

What did I do to protect the batteries from too high rate of discharge? Spec them to provide more thsn the peak 160A discharge per ESC.

Yes but if in pack 1 cell 1 is 3.5v and in pack 2 cell 1 is 3.7v I doubt the balance charger can bring them on one level.
It‚Äôs like with LiIon packs. If you have a 10s4p for example, you have one balance lead for 4cells. Means the bms balance the packs not the individual cells. If one cell in the 4p pack is bad your balance charger can‚Äôt handle that.
If to come back to the case I wrote before your balance charger will probably see the average voltage which is 3.6 and balance that up till reaching 4.2v. The thing is that then one cell is 4.1 and the other 4.3 when fully charged.
Idk how much the cells in parallel can balance each other, so maybe there will be a bit less difference but in general I understood it like that.

Anyway, as covered in another thread, I stuffed my batteries over the holiday break by not giving them a storage charge.

I then bought 4x new Graphene 4S 5,000mAh batteries at 35% discount (combination sale and voucher) from Hobbyking.

So wired up it‚Äôs 8S 10,000mAh instead of the 6,000mAh I had before at only $40 more than the original cost.

Couldn‚Äôt get a BMS though, since they didn‚Äôt have stock. Any recommendations?

You looking for a charge only bms or charge/discharge bms?
If discharge, how much amps you want to have as max limit on the bms?

I need to be able to dump 2x 160A at up to 33.6V under full load, so thinking of charge only, but it should be able to balance cells up to 8S5P which could be up to where I scale, although currently it would only be for 8S2P.

If 15a charge and 84mA balance current is enough for you than I think the d140 from bestech would still work fine.

Edit: or as suggested before you could get one of this smart bms 
https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/cGAybLgm
Just make sure that they sent you the bms set up for lipo not lifepo4 as it says in the description.
I just sent a message to the shop and I got one with the confit for lipos.

... with this you made me curious üòÖ
What‚Äôs your plans for this year to hit that current?
Sounds definitely interesting üòÖüëå

That‚Äôs my setup today. 33.6V because individual cells CAN get up to 4.2V each although not recommended, and my ESCs put out 160A each which is why I get over 8kW with two motors on 8S configuration.

But your motors rated only to 80a.
What about that?

Oh, didn‚Äôt see that. You mean that I could achieve the same performance with one ESC and for phase I do y-wires, or doesn‚Äôt it work like that?

So at 80A and 29.6V per motor I‚Äôm only pushing 4.7kW combined? Man! Now I wonder what 8kW+ feels like!

No you need 1 esc for each motor.
But even if your esc can handle 160A it doesn‚Äôt mean that you actually draw that current all the time. I think your esc work the same like a vesc when it comes to current regulation.
If you drive on a flat road you push probably less than 30a through your esc, what means also your current drawn from the battery is somewhere around that and not 160a.
I don‚Äôt know in how far you can program your esc, but for example if you have a vesc and your motor is rated to 80a (most 6374 motors rated between 60-80a) you set your motor max current to 80a.

Now for a BMS. I‚Äôll start riding it before I have one, but I‚Äôve got a bit of an under-mounted transformation in mind. My current use doesn‚Äôt come close to using the deck flex, even so when under-mounting I‚Äôll custom make an enclosure.

Awesome build! Can you explain the beads in the wheels? Is it for speed wobbles? Also what type of lubrication are you using on the internal gear of your drive system?

Thanks mate! The beads are for balancing, although I haven‚Äôt put them in. Been so very busy the last two months, my new batteries aren‚Äôt even fitted yet.

Thinking of selling the LiPos and going LiFePO4. Is the 8S limitation on my ESCs due to voltage? If so, can I go 9S LiFePO4 to make up for some of the voltage drop?
