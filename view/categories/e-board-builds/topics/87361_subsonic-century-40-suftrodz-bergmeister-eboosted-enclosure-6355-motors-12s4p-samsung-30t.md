Hello guys:
I'm working on a new board right now, I've already built some boards each with unique characteristics:

1. The Moonshine Sidekick
A useful kicktail high speed commuter, loads of torque and range, with soft small wheels mallgrab ready, but not good for bad roads

2. A Trampa eMTB
It can goes over ANITHING but as soon as you hit 30MPH 
becomes a wobble machine.

3. The Spud
A small light board perfect to go to nearby meetings where I know I might need to carry it around without drawing too much attention.

4. The Raptor 2
Nice hub board with average range, average torque. Used mainly when one of my boards breaks down

So the logical step is to have a board than can go averywhere no matter how bad the road is, could be ridden at high speed with good stability and could hold my favorite cell the 30T for 140A os discharge, so it's gonna be a torque monster.

12s4p made of Samsung 30Ts for 140A dicharge

I designed the enclosure for the deck to follow the shape of the deck

Here is the enclosure installed on the deck, with the wheels and surfrodz trucks:

@DerelictRobot you seem to be an expert on this matter, what would you suggest to avoid wobbles at high speed on channels while keeping your steering capabilities at low speeds? 

Hope you don't mind to shed some light on inexperienced riders as myself

Sure. The main point I'm trying to make here is that it's inaccurate to correlate a negative riding experience or setup to a style of trucks. I wouldn't go 30+ on RKPs unless I had a good idea of what the baseplate angles & bushings look like, the same applies to Channels. I have different setups for different course environments and speed range. Channels are also built to ride a drifting line, not straight downhill bombing. The riding style is completely different. I ride RKP, TKPs, and channels. 

Could you describe your setup on your TRAMPA eMTB? What type of channels, what shore dampeners from front/back? Assuming holypro style deck with 35 degree end angles?

I've been riding Trampa HS11 and HolyPro 35 for over 3 years, pushing it to full speed everyday, wobbles still happen everyonce on a while, even more when you find unexpected road imperfections, the second issue happens as soon as I reach full speed, everytime one motor stops accelerating more than the other as soon as you hit maximum speed, this causes a pretty noticeable high speed wooble, this never happened on Surfrodz RKPs in fact they are massively more stable, you can relax and just bomb it to the max. I agree with @deckoz with his trailing vs leading point of view about channels. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't ever able to compare my channels riding techniques against other pro riders, since there are no builders or diy boards in my country, so I really don't know how good or bad am I at riding channels. Nevertheless, I ride pretty aggressively pushing the throttle to the max on every corner.

It sounds like you've got a decent amount of riding time under your belt on MTBs. What size tires, what is your dampener setup, and are you dewedging your rear trucks at all? Belt or Gear, FOC or BLDC?

I don't experience the top-speed wobble you're describing on either of my gear drives. I've felt it more with belts but that wasn't even on a MTB. 

I'm certainly not what I'd consider a pro rider, I just had a good number of seasons in analog mountainboarding and kiteboarding growing up and in my 20s. Like every board I've ever ridden- they need to be tuned in to rider preference and course environment. Any board I'm bringing to 30+ I'd expect this of, regardless of type of truck.

[/quote]

6.5" urban threads 
Not dewedging at all
Gear drives
FOC

Front trucks running inner position with custom orange danpas, softer that yellows. 

I think there is no way a channel truck could be as stable at high speeds and as carvy at low speeds as a RKP with some rake because of it's design for the same skill level rider

Hopefully this isn't a complete derail from your thread, we can ask the mods to branch it off if so, but I'm enjoying the conversation nonetheless.

As I'm sure you're aware, wobbles do largely come directly from rider reaction to uneven terrain. I'll share a bit of my personal riding experience and commentary, rather than try to tell you things you likely already know. 

I guess the only thing I'd recommend trying out is to dewedge your rear to like 28-30 degrees. If you're using TRAMPA channels I've actually got a printed wedge (5-8 degree / wedge & dewedge variants) that has cutouts for spring tensioners and covers the entire baseplate footprint. Was planning on putting these up on Thingiverse eventually but can get on that if you'd like to try them out. 

I've been riding my LaCroix deck at 36/30 but removed my front wedge and have just been riding a looser damp setup- nothing in the front and reds in the back on 8" pneums/SS hubs. 

For Barrett I was running 7" nearly-slicked Innova Inlines & reds front/back. I don't think I got above 34mph on my test runs downhill but that was due the somewhat gnarly track conditions- at higher PSI I was having to bear down pretty hard on the front trucks to keep my board from popping up too much over the crags. 

Geardrive- what gear ratio are you running? I'm curious on your issues with max-speed with the motors not being at the same speed. Obviously there will be some variance there but the larger the gear ratio the less pronounced this is. I've run into it on one of my higher KV (220) belt drive Urethane setups but that was at 1:1.8 so the difference in speed was much more pronounced than the 4:1 Kaly drives I ride on more regularly.

Do you ride with bindings? That could also be a factor- I don't love riding at 30+ with bindings on simply because I can't shift my stance and tuck in like I can free footed. The cowboy stance I see a lot of people locked into feels okay at lower speeds but I need to tuck if I'm going to sprint at a straight line.

For the record, not trying to argue that channels are the best solution for bombing a straight line. Channels are most stable for me running a slightly drifted line. I just personally haven't run into any wobbles that weren't the direct result of my own over-reaction to terrain, and they don't oscillate in the same manner as I've experienced on TKP/RKPs.

Of course YMMV, everyone rides differently and I would never claim anything as an absolute. I just have seen the statement of "channel trucks wobble at 25 or 30+mph" thrown around a few times, and that directly contradicts the personal experience of myself and my friends. I run two MTB builds that both can do 36+ (depending on configuration) on flat even with a heavier rider such as myself. @Skunk recently got some ride time on my Carver with a 4x reds setup & then 0/2 reds setup and had zero issues bringing it up to top speed without even the notion of wobbles. 

Cheers!

I run 4:1 Kaly gear drives and no bindings, I also do hate the cowboy stance they give you, it's just silly

FWIW I did reach 35mph without wobbles with an old configuration, trucks springs loaded to the max and yellow dampas, both front and rear, outter spring position. However, low speed turning was ridiculously ineffective, I had to literally hope of the board on every corner unless I was at enough speed by using my weight momentum against a carve. 

What I might try is to dewedge the rear and loose both front and rear trucks, that's a formula I haven't tested myself. As channel trucks are leading and not trailing they will always be subjected to a nervous steering behavior on uneven roads, that is why turn my head into this dewedged Subsonic Century with RKP raked trucks

BTW I increased the wheelbase a little bit, this would serve two purposes, creating more space for inwards motor mounting and having a nicer overall better looking esk8.

Agreed entirely! Ha. I don't mind them with kiteboarding/downhill MTB, but I need to be able to use the dancefloor and shift around as needed to feel confident at higher speeds.

Yep. 4x reds feels like a big tugboat below 15mph. Not nearly as much fun and I personally didn't feel any real improvement in stability at higher speeds. The boards are so much more fun running looser setups anyway.

Nice build Alan.  As always.  Have you ever ridden a dewedged deck before?  They don't like turning at all. lol.  Be a whole lot better with the sr trucks I imagine but with the tb's they can be a bitch to set up.  I liken it to a holy grail quest to have low speed carving and high speed solidity.  Still love it to bits though.

Adman is Paul’s official partner. 

I’m still back on your Talon :) had to find an original deck to fit your beautiful enclosure. 

Next buying a @3DServisas Mini gear drive and adapter for @riverside.rider’s blue Bergmeisters.

The medium glass frit will be blue in the blue stain and clear over the unstained wooden part. 

All because of your design, bro :)  keep pushing!

righteous :)  just make sure the dimensions match up between Alan's Talon enclosure and the custom Talon you order.

Subsonic changed the mold and the custom Talon I received was too small for my eBoosted enclosure, so I sold it and bought a factory Talon (pictured above).

Sorry if these pictures dont explain well.   The eC40 will use "new school" bolt pattern.  This will allow the holes to be 3/4inch or 20mm from tail end.  
FYI this build is using the same deck Ive been prototyping with since I met @Subsonic_Paul .   I have beat the hell out of it even changed rail colors a couple times. lol. Bolt holes are still stress free clean with no ware.    I've been doing many angle versions and I can get most of anyone's ride style to work.  Has anyone used a 45 degree angle on the rear?  For first version of eC40 it will have 2 height options for a wire channel risers that will protect the surfrodz base plate protrusion.     Comments and input appreciated.

Do you mean the width? 

They are approximately the same, but on the Moonshine you can't mount the cells offset, they won't fit f you mount a 12s5p

On the Century you can easily mount a 12s5p or even a 14s5p and it's single stack.

May I ask what size nickel and how many layers you used for parallel connections? I assume it's only one layer on the top?

I use only one nickel strip on each possitive and negative but I connected P-Groups with two 16AWG silicone wires.

All electronics are ready

So, at last, I finished my Century 40" thanks to @Subsonic_Paul for trusting my work.

Here are the final pictures before I go over everything in 5 minutes, can't wait to see what those Samsung 30T can do, I wonder if the Unity can handle 140A battery discharge

I just came back from my first trip. All I can say is AMAZING, it's the smoothest board ever, acceleration even at 30% battery was delicious, it gets to top speed real fast and smooth. The tires are very grippy, the height is more than enough to look great but keeping a good ground clearance. If you compare the riding from this to a Trampa build with channels, you can ride much faster and feel safer without struggling to avoid woobles. The trucks are really stable even though they are really loose. I though I was going to have a hard time turning with this deck because of it's dewedged deck but nothing more away from the truth, the board can turn way better than the trampa and even more than my sidekick.

I wonder if the new FW has anything to do with it but the brakes are really precise and feel like a high power brake. Just loving this board.

Just need to fix a couple of things, for some reason I can't keep the front wheels/bearing from rattling, there is a small play on the bearings, there is something loose inside the enclosure, I'll fix it tomorrow

Guys I upgraded my motors from the flipsky 6355 190kv to the Maytech 6365 190kv and OMG! this board is just a rocket, I didn't know I was going to feel such a big upgrade in torque, speed and power. Maybe the Flipsky motors were 170kv, they also were making this weird sound, magnets touching the stator.

All in all this upgrade was so much worth it, the final board is so powerful I need to adjust my thumb precisely but feel with a lot of control. 30Ts are my all time favorites

I might test 120A soon but 100A is already too much to go full throttle without holding your ass tight

I am torn between this deck/enclosure vs the Landyachtz Evo Falcon 40″ for a similar Bergmeister build. The DS enclosure on the Evo is appealing... any idea how many 20700 cells this can hold @Eboosted?
```

You can fit a 13S4P 20700 cells, however I'd suggest you go 12s4p made of Samsung 30T for high discharge currents or 40T for maximum range.

The subsonic deck has a couple of nice advantages it's not as common as the LY Evo and the lower standing platform with the dewedged ends and combined with Surfrodz RKP gives you an out of this world high speed stability, amazing control with loose trucks and really low center of gravity, it also has disadvantage, it has a low clearance on Bergmeisters, however if you use 1/2" risers you are good to go and can go over every obstacle on the street. 

The Evo is a classic build, it has a really nice shape, the drop is not as aggressive as the subsonic century, another benefit of the Evo is the deck is good for inwards mounting of 6374 motors out of the box on the subsonic you need to move your rear baseplates mounting points towards the rear in order to mount the motors both inwards and outwards. The Evo is also very stiff much stiffer than the Century, so you might feel more road vibrations than the Century which is more forgiving and comfortable

Hope I was able to help people taking the right decision about their next build

No. I still have this on all my boards, just try to slow down acceleration when I'm near full speed and bend my knees to have more stability, some of my builds have dual FocBoxes in parallel and the others are on Unities, all have the same issue.

It's weird, the Unity+bergs combo is my first pneumatic, and I'd never noticed the effect on my other boards, most of which get extended runs with the throttle pegged. It feels almost like it's trying to induce the wobs. Maybe it's the gearing. Thanks for the feedback, very helpful.

I think this effect only occurs when you have enough battery/motor power to reach full speed fast enough, if the battery/motor are medium/small the effect is non perceivable as it reaches top speed gradually
