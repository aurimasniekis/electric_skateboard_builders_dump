Hello everyone,

I'm new here, well I have been lurking about for months since deciding I wanted an electric skateboard. I was so close to getting a Evolve Bamboo but then after reading post after post of people builds and then seeing the eMTB's, I just had to get involved. 

So why is this build called The Kakashi? Well if anyone here has ever watched Naruto you will know he is called the Copy Cat Ninja. This is pretty much what my build is, a plain and simple copy of other eMTB's. Why? Because I'm a total virgin to electric skateboards (I do longboard and snowboard) and tried & tested is what I wanted for my first build. 

So here is my build list -
Trampa Holy Pro 15 Ply Deck, Vertico Trucks & Superstar Wheels
E-Toxx Belt Drive system & carbon fibre mount for MAX6's
2 x Turnigy SK3 6374 192Kv motors
4 x 4S Zippy 5000Mah 20C Lipo's with 2 in series and then parallel to make 8S2P
2 x Hobbywing MAX6 ESC's & 3in1 program box
1 x Nano Remote (Just picked one off @ajaynagra as he had a couple spare from his group buy)

That is just the stuff that's going on the board. Man I have had to buy SOO many more bits. 5.5mm & 4mm Castle bullets, 10 AWG wire (pain to find at a decent price), Turnigyy TQ4 & PSU, balance charging boards, lipo charging bags, threadlock, heatshrink stuff, gloves, wrist guards, knee & elbow pads

But you know, I'm too excited to even worry about the dent in my bank account. OK its more than a dent and the GF is never allow to know the true cost or I'm a dead man. 

So the only things I'm missing are little things like the wire, trampa board (ordering that after this post), motor mount (@Nowind shipped today) and a battery box. I know I have forgotten something but I'll deal with that when it arrives. 

Oh let me just say that Jen's is the man! Helped me no end as we talked over options. I can't be thankful enough for his help and motor mounts (Don't they look sexy!) 

I'll update tomorrow with pictures of all the bits I have gathered so far and as soon as I start building I post as much as I can. Mainly so I can remember things but also hopefully it will help someone else with their build in the future. I also expect I'm going to need a little advice and help along the way, so if you can think of anything obvious, please reply ;)

Peace
EssEnn

Little update... This is my stash so far - 
[img]http://i.imgur.com/aDcIwio.jpg[/img]

So tomorrow my board arrives (Thanks @trampa) and mounts should be with me by the weekend. 
Yes I think I went a little crazy on the X90's and the X90 anti sparks but I'd rather have them and not need them. 

It has been like Christmas every day for me this week and I will feel a little sad when parts stop arriving.
 
Oh I thought of a few things extra I would need. Velcro (always handy), bike pump, drill bits, nuts & bolts, BLOODY LOCTITE (I thought I ordered some but thinking about it now, probably not, BALLS) & maybe some hot glue. 

I'll start test fitting everything next week when it all should be here.

You didn't order the bindings and heel straps? 

My mountain board is basically my main board nowadays and even with "soft" green dampas the thing turns like a semi truck. You wouldn't even be able to turn it without heel straps and bindings.

If you have any specific questions let me know :)

Might be able to get by if you completely remove the dampas, but the torque with those speed controllers is pretty intense. Definitely wouldn't recommend it.

WOOOO, almost everything has arrived now and I will start building the drive train this weekend and test fitting all the parts. Only thing still need to order are some pads & gloves as well as pick up a few tools.

One thing I did not think about it storage for all the parts, screws, connectors, tools etc as in the space of 2 weeks I realised I need to get organised a lot more or I'm going to lose things. 

Also after watching @Nowind firework display I think I'm going to rig some kind of emergency pull cord to disconnect the batteries in an emergency. I know the issue was not a battery issue but I think being able to stop the batteries going critical if there is a short is a good idea. Anyone have tried and tested solutions? Is it even worth me thinking about?

This weekend the girlfriend is away so I got to take over the kitchen and start putting all the bits together. 
I'm actually quite proud of myself although I did spend 8 hours getting this far. I did replace all the bullet connectors with 5mm ones from the 4mm ones on the motors and put XT90's on the batteries. I have not held a soldering iron in 20 years so had a little practice but not a dry joint in sight. 

[img]http://i.imgur.com/z2VVjRh.png[/img]

So the drive train is complete and the ESC's are in place. Weird how all that's left is making the loom from the batteries, mounting the 309 box to the board (Velcro for now), fitting the batteries inside and then setting everything up. I should be able to have a quick test ride tomorrow if it is dry enough outside. 100% getting up early in the morning!

I have to admit it was a daunting list of things to do as I've never built an eboard before and I had boxes of parts EVERYWHERE (and still do but I'll tidy that up tomorrow) for the last few weeks. I made sure that I took my time doing everything, used loctite on everything, triple checked every bolt and screw and I even managed to get the motor mount within 0.15mm from centre. 

Fingers crossed it all works tomorrow when I power everything up for the first time! 

I'll update tomorrow with my progress

Peace

Today was a good day. I got up early to work on Kakashi and it works!

YEAH BOYZ!

I cheated a little bit and just made half the wiring loom so atm I'll have to swap pairs of batteries but I could not wait any longer. Being honest I thought there would be a lot more issues but plugged it all in, set everything up, grabbed my helm and give Kakashi a test run. 

Let me tell you a little story. There was this guy who decided that he wanted an eMTB and built one over a weekend. He spent months researching and then weeks waiting for the parts to arrive but after that weekend he was pretty damn chuffed with the result. So grabbing his helmet he ventured outside his house to give it a little test run. He strapped himself to the board, powered up the ESC's & remote, gritted his teeth as he gently pushed forwards on the remote. The next thing he knew he was looking at the sky, which was weird because only a split second ago there was road. This was the moment the guy realised that he needed a lot more protection & soft ground before he rides again

So yeah, that is what happened, I had no idea that the remote was that sensitive and I must have only gone about 10% on the throttle. Turns out 10% from stand still, if you are not ready for it will whip the board from under you. Lucky I just have a few scrapes on my knees and elbows along with a little bruise on my hip. Nothing serious but after that I was riding like a granny. I'm not going to lie when I say it is TERRIFYING to ride the first time and I think I'm going to be terrified for a while longer until I get the hang of things. First, protection & Second, nice soft grass to play on. 

Here are some pics of my not completed (needs everything to be tidied up etc) but working build (sorry about the potato quality)

[img]http://i.imgur.com/U6AniBh.png[/img]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/FRhP1yb.png[/img]

All in all I'm pleased with the results and look forward learning to ride this beast (how people ride 10S to 12S I don't know). I may even drop to 4S so I can get the hang of things and jump up to 8S later. Not decided, I think I will see how things go over the next week. 

Any riding tips? @Nowind & @barajabali?

Man that is sick. I am extremely jealous of the belt drive. 

I'm gonna be upgrading to 12s dual 149kv on belts rather than what I have now which is 10s on 190kv chain.  I need more speed and torque :) 

Only tip is make sure your strapped in for the ride. Also find a way to stop lol which is why I'm installing disk brakes from trampa.

I still have to cover the cables in wrap, put some padding in the battery box so the connectors aren't in contact with the batteries, figure out how I'm going to manage the cables from the ESC's & batteries and then a proper shake down run until the batteries run out. 

The belts are very quiet I have to admit. I can hear the fans on the esc's more, but I am being a right old granny. I'm going to buy some protection as well as doing anything on this board means you have to commit to it. I'm ready for more tumbles and falls, all part of the fun. 

@JLabs  I was expecting the jerk at the start but I was balanced 50:50 not 80:20 and the board just flew from under me.  Sensored might be an idea so I'll keep it in mind but I think I'm just going to have to get used to it. I'm just having to get used to the remote and how sensitive it is as well as everything else that is new. 

Also thanks for the support. If you think of anything that I have missed or I could do better I'm open for suggestions.

Nice that you got your Kakashi running now. Not that nice that the first attempt endet like this :fearful:

As you said, best playground for sure is a big field with soft grass for beginning.
Use as many protectors as possible (-; Helmet for sure, back, knee, elbow, wrist, ass ...

You can check what settings the MAX6 have actually, you can set the punch level to lowest if you not already done this.

Leaning forward by startup helps to not fall backwards, also you can get the board a little push with your hips to make the startup smoother.
Also dont forget that by hard braking (depending on brake setting) you can get throw of in forward direction... so leaning backward 

Hope thats help a little to get on with it. Feel free to ask anytime!

Looks really nice with those belts.   Can't compare to chains but the belts i'm using are pretty quiet and reliable (12mm wide). Not riding in dirt so I don't need the self-cleaning action of a chain.  I took the dampas out of my rig since I'm not riding with bindings. Works well, maxing out at 32 kmph with little to no wobble.   Great job with your board. Enjoy!!

It was my fault really and I got bitten for not being prepared with protection but I was really excited getting that far with my build over the weekend but I should have taken it to the park for a test run. I'm an idiot. 

I did set the punch level to 1, checked last night to make sure as well as updated the firmwares of the ESC's. 

The hip thing is a good idea to get things rolling from start off, I'll remember that. I just have to get used to riding it. 

I'll spend this week finishing up as much as possible with cable management etc. I'll give it a proper run on the weekend as long as it is dry enough. 

Thanks for all the help!

Thanks bro. 

It had crossed my mind to remove to dampers as I dont actually weight that much (65kg) and I do find it a little stiff but it will probably losen up over time. I'm going to look at some better footware as well. 

I am probably going to spend most of my time off the roads as the police here would pull me in an instant

Protection ordered and on its way! I'll have it more finished this week ready for the weekend so I'll post pictures when it is done. 

Once I have given it a shake down I'm going to start thinking how to make an emergency pull cord to cut power from the batteries. I decided to only Velcro the battery box to the board so if the batteries decided to go critical I can disconnect and rip the box off, hopefully saving the board and my legs. 
Now thining about it more I think the pull cord is going to also remove the battery box as well as disconnect the batteries from the electronics. I might even line the inside of the box with a lipo charge bag. 

The plan is going to have to wait a little while though, the GF has lots of 'don't have fun with your board' weekends planned for me but at least the plan is brewing.

Well I won't be riding Kakashi for a little while.

Simply put the remote is the issue. I went out this evening after work for a ride in a park and again when I started off the board shot out from under me. At least I was on grass this time and was wearing body armour and crash pants this time. I was 100% sure I was really gentle with the remote but thought it could just be me. So I tried again and was off without any issue for maybe 10m and then all of a sudden there was a short burst of acceleration which I handled without an issue. Still at only 50% throttle I was carving some turns and again a tiny burst of acceleration. So I'm looking about for anything that could be causing interference but I'm 200m away from anything. 

So I stop, check the connections, test the remote and all seems fine until I try to start again and this time it went full throttle for about 1 second so I ended up on my arse again but this time hurting my shoulder. I'm about 250m from my car so I think I might as well walk back to my car and drove the board back to my car. This is when I started to notice that the remote was the issue as the board would just charge off at full throttle when i was just engaging the remote or would not work at all. Also 1 second lag from the inputs which I never noticed before but then again I never used the board much.

So until my shoulder recovers I'm going to need to find a new remote. Anyone got any recommendations? I have ordered one of the enertion (pre-order) ones but looking at the picture it is the same as the one I currently have and that is a worry. I'm considering a GT2B right now as those seem to be the more reliable but the size is the issue although the price is decent. I have no issues spending money so please suggest away....

Other than that, for 200m I had sketchy fun and can't wait to be able to ride again. 

Peace

@Mobutusan  Yeah its nothing more serious than a sprain so I will be fine in a few days. I'll see if i can pick one of those remotes up. 

@whitepony Good shout, I'll get some ferrite rings ordered tonight and maybe re-wire power around a little. There is one negative lead running over the box housing the receiver so that might be it. See if that makes a difference tomorrow.

@rodriguejoe1 you got to have a plan! What I want is a titanium plate with the box attached and that velcro'd to the deck. I'll probably have to settle for steel to start but I think aluminium would deform when pulled hard and fast. Then it's a case of figuring out the connector. I have a plan in my head so lets see if I can pull it off ;)

Just ordered the ferrite rings now as well so I will update when I have the parts and some time to test.

Let us now how it goes.. seems to be a very odd behaviour, think you're the first one who complains about such ''uncontrollable'' circumstances..

I assume there are not much customization options for your esc. Have you tried to decrease acceleration or the max throttle limit?

----

I think you should be asking @nowind how to configure the esc if you have problems with that (It seems he has had similar esc to yours)..

----
Other than that, I've found an interesting clue / thing others have not implemented a lot, some folks (or in this case, this specific one) recommends **to set a ''acceleration delay''.**

Here, take a look at this, it seems this guy know what he's talking about:

> Throttle ramping

> Because sensorless R/C controllers can't really control how much current they send to the motor (and current is directly proportional to torque output), and low-speed starting can be erratic and hard to control, it is useful to have a "ramp" somewhere in the throttle chain. Without ramping or some other kind of control input damping, sudden jerk motions of your hand or foot can result in the vehicle responding unexpectedly such as a sudden application of power. This is not only hard to operate, but it can be outright dangerous if you are in traffic or around other people.

Search for ''throttle ramping'' and read forwards

Some of the ideas might be worth implementing, would love to see how they work.

I think the settings are fine on the ESC. There are not many options and it is already on the lowest power setting. 

Reading up on the winning remote it seems it is a very unreliable remote. I should have listened to @Nowind. Even without the motor running there is a noticeable lag with inputs from the controller no matter how close it is to the receiver. 

I have ferrite rings coming and I figured out how I can re-wire part of the electronics to keep wires away from the receiver without much work at all.

Been using the GT2B since day one with absolutely no problems. Can't even imagine riding around in the city with a sketchy controller. Would have been flattened by a bus or tram by now.  Thought I would mod it to make it smaller but it's actually no problem at all. Good ergonomics and so solid, in my experience.  Make sure you solder connections for extra reliability.

I dont think that your problems are foundet on the ESC, as you said they are not that much options for programming.
As long you set the throttle calibration correct it will be good.

Its easy to proof, on full throttle green led apears, on full brake also.

its an Transmitter/Reciever problem for sure, if you google winner remote alot problems of users apears, for example:

Both the ESC's are working fine and on full throttle and break the light goes green. I really don't trust the remote, it does not feel right and there is a 1 second lag on any commands from the remote. It's going in the bin as I could not sell it to someone knowing how bad they are.

I have another on order form esk8.de, one of the mini ones so I'll wait for that. 

On a good note, my shoulder is feeling a lot better. Should be all mended tomorrow or the day after.

So my mini remote arrived last night and I had enough time to get everything installed, including the ferrite rings. 

I actually installed the rings and tried out the Wining remote first. There were still issues with random speed bursts and terrible range with even my body blocking the signal. Anything more than 10cm and it would become unreliable. 

I then installed the Mini remote and the total opposite happened. Range went from sub 1m in my kitchen to 'I can walk out the kitchen, down stairs, out my flat and across the car park'. A lot more responsive as well. 

So I'm leaving work a tiny bit early so I can have a ride before it gets dark. Fingers crossed we ha e no rain!

And finally I got to ride Kakashi for 20 mins after work. Seriously, I'm not even going to think about selling the Wining remote I have, pure dangerous. With the mini remote, zero issues.

Ah it was nice wizzing around a local park. GPS clocked me going 16mph top 10mph average and I had fun in the evening sun and will have another longer ride on the weekend but need to do a little extra wiring and give things another tidy. 

Love it

Hah, I assume that is not the max speed this board is capable of.. Can you tell the theoretical max of your setup? Would love to find out what gearing ratio you got and what is the max possible speed with this thing (beauty).. :)

Its a 12:72 ratio with a 192Kv motor, 8S and 200mm wheels so should be 22mph max. It was a lot of fun to ride and I'm going to take it along a bike path along the river over the weekend if it is still dry. If I can find my gopro I'll take a video.

I have experienced a similar problem on an eMTB I built with Dual MAX6 ESCs, twin SK3 6374 motors and 6s 16,000mAh battery . . . **_my solution was to develop a small board/firmware that I have placed in between my receiver and the ESCs to 'manage' the PWM signal_**.

Effectively, when the remote PWM signal is increased, my board/firmware ramps up the speed to that requested in a series of smaller steps over time (i.e an acceleration curve). This means that, even if you slam your remote to full from neutral, the acceleration is 'managed' so that you have a smooth (and safe) increase rather an immediate leap/'jerk' to the higher speed/power. In a similar manner when the brake is applied, this too is deployed in a smooth (and safe) way.

When there is a loss of signal from the remote, my board/firmware sees this as a sudden and massive reduction that is then managed to effect a smooth deceleration to a stop. Should the remote suddenly cut back in, rather than causing a 'jerk' that throws the rider off, the my board/firmware transitions this into to a smooth acceleration and increase in speed.

Since I built my board/firmware into my eMTB, I have experienced no issues of the type you describe and **_I now enjoy a relaxed riding experience as smooth as butter_** . . . effectively, I have 'tamed the monster' to a degree that my children can now ride the eMTB smoothly and easily.

That sounds really interesting. I have a few friends who want to ride my eMTB but I'm more worried they are going to hurt themselves. This little management module, something to care to share with others?

So finally a nice and dry day I could take Kakashi out for a ride. I'm not so terrified of riding him now and really enjoyed the ride in the park. Carving is just so much fun! 

Here is a pic from today (Bonus castle)

Yes, happy to share. Take a look at my build where I show it mounted on my eMTB ([http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dorian-wiskow-emtb-build-trampa-holypro-17-twin-sk3-6374s-twin-max6-escs-6s-16-000mah-lipo/10859/8](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dorian-wiskow-emtb-build-trampa-holypro-17-twin-sk3-6374s-twin-max6-escs-6s-16-000mah-lipo/10859/8))

Wow, that's great! I believe you have built the ''throttle ramp'' function I was talking about in about 2 threads..

Will  check it out.. I do hope u offer some diy or ready built modules for this!

When you had the issue with bursts of acceleration, which hand was the remote in - the one nearest the back (and the receiver) or the one nearest the front (and farthest from the receiver) . . . The reason I ask, is that in my experience when holding the [Winning] remote in the hand at the front of the board I had frequent intermittent signal loss. When I changed hands and held the remote in the hand at the rear of the board the problem went away.

I always had the remote closest to the receiver. The range on the Wining remote is terrible compared to the mini remote. Since switching I have had no issues with sudden bursts of acceleration, the difference was night and day between the two remotes. The only issue I have with the mini remote is my big hands but it is so much more reliable and the range is huge in comparison though I have not tested its full range yet. I have gotten 15m away with 3 walls between me and the board and no issues with responsiveness or control. I could hear it but not see it lol. 

I'm not sure if the issue with the Wining remote is the controller or the receivers. I might try pairing the remote with the mini receiver but then I'm not sure if I would still trust it. 

IMO your body should not block the RF signal at such a short range, if if does then it's just plain dangerous. I have had zero issues with the mini remote and control inputs just feel so much smoother.

Today I quickly grabbed my board during my lunch break and went for a ride after work. Just as I got to the park it started raining a little and stopped so I went for a ride. Damp grass is a little bit sketchy so no hard carving. I still managed almost 19mph according to the google fit app. With the 8S2P 10,000Mah battery pack I get about 25 minutes of constant riding on grass and averaged 12mph for 6 miles of riding before the battery's ran out. 

I'll get to ride again in a few days if the weather is good enough. Too much fun these eMTB's once you get the hang of riding them. I had the fear to start but now I'm getting the hang of it. 

I'm going to have to think about bigger batteries at some point as I'd like to have about 30-45 mins riding time and I did cheap out on the batteries to start.

Good stuff @EssEnn ... nice pic! Where abouts in the uk are you? The weather really sucks in this country doesnt it! 
Its a pain in the butt to scroll back up to the top now im typing, so i cant easily check, but which batteries are you using?

@EssEnn Im in Lancashire mate, the wet and windy north ! :-/
Ive 'cheaped out' on my batteries too but they were just a try out pack ... Floureon 3300mAh off ebay ... 2 x 4s packs for 30quid, 45c. Just to get me going really. Once im built up and riding/testing i'll try some other packs and see how they perform

@smudgeUK You probably have more riding spots then ;)

The packs I have fit perfectly in my 309 drybox and that is with some padding in the lid and base. I will be getting some bigger Mah batteries in the spring but the weather is about to go crap so I won't be riding as much.I have a few ideas I want to try out and a second esk8 I'm thinking of building (for runs to the shops and city cruising). Summer is going to be sick though. I want to find some nice forest trails to ride!

Yep i admit there is a fair bit of countryside up here, but i think i would rather have the sun you southerners get in the summer ;-)
Ive gone for an open top 'sled' for my battery holder, the idea being that if for some reason i require crazy range i can just rack 'em and stack 'em :-D 
Wanna jump in a thread in eleccy section about the arduino throttle idea?

If I need more range I'll just keep extra batteries in my rucksac. I actually find that my legs get tired after 20 mins of riding but that's just getting used to it. 

Looking into Arduino's, there is a lot the can be done with one and they look really suited for esk8's. Time to learn to code I guess ;)

So while winter is here and I'm a fair weather boarder, I have had time to think about my build and was thinking of building a Li-ion pack. Then I looked on Amazon and found Samsung 25R's for £3.81 each so I just bought 80 to build an 8S10P pack. I'm such an impulse buyer! 

So now I have to figure out the design, what to out them in, find and buy a BMS, nickle strips, spot weilder (or find someone in the UK to do it), charger, a dry box to fit it all and any thing else I have forgotten. 

Any suggestions?

Yeah that is a good idea but with 10P I have about 250A available so less stress on the batteries, less voltage sag and should be capable of being ridden harder. 

Anyone know someone in the London area who spot welds batteries?

Hey @EssEnn, how is the build going?
I just read this entire thread and your setup looks nice!
I am new on this forum and i'm looking around for the right beginners setup.
Can you tell me where you bought your esc's, batteries and motors?
thanks.
