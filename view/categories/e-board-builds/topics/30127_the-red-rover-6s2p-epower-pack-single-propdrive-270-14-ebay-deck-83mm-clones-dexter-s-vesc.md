Yup, you read that right, Iâ€™m 13 (not the board).  Iâ€™ve had nothing but problems with this board, in fact, itâ€™s not even working right now due to a broken belt. Anyways, here are some pics

Your mount isn't on right which would make sense, your battery is probably prone to voltage sag since that's low voltage and few cells in parallel

Yup, I knew both of those things, Iâ€™m just gonna buy a new mount. As for the battery, Iâ€™ll probably be keeping that for a little while.
