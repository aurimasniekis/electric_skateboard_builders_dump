**Another year, another build!.**

Most likely my last I make for myself for the next 1 - 2 years so better turn out great!

Idea was to get the board I love, a **Boosted.**

Cheaper, faster and in a brand new condition since you won’t find a new V2 anywhere in Denmark anymore.

Started out with a hard budget of *740euro* but must admit, I went over it… *By double the amount...*

*Goals:* **Quality finish, no flaws. Reliable. Fast. Smooth. Versatile. Fast Charging. Over-all pure epicness.**

*Spec/part list:*

* **Loaded Vanguard Flex 3.**
* **E-Calibers.**
* **Orangatang Kegels.**
* **Flipsky 190KV 6354.**
* **Flipsky 4.20 Plus.**
* **Flipsky VX1.**
* **Electricboardsolutions Mounts.**
* **Electricboardsolutions Pulleys. (15/36).**
* **10S4P Samsung 30Q Bypassed 12AH.**
* **Eboosted Enclosure Vanguard 10S4P**

No fancy ble module or anything as a start.

Taking a few chances on the Flipsky VESC, but had very good experience with their motors in the past so I trust them on that.

Going into every detail I can on this build, premium inserts with fibreglass layer over it with premium car fender washers.
Not a penny saved on the details, *its what counts.*

Should do **30-35km** and **38-40km/h.**

So far almost finished the deck, got it sanded down both sides ready to dremel and drill inserts into and paint so it looks as following.

All parts ordered, should be here within the next 2 weeks

Any tips and tricks are welcome, and of course some upgrades down the road!

Will post updates as I go.


**Week 1.**

Got the first parts in the mail, checked and sat it up for a bench test worked flawless!
![60430473_1355842277889969_8870382736519462912_n|375x500](upload://ajsUss38YgrHyuFbuK6SP6y8HF9.jpeg) ![62014763_444429653043159_1876899819293769728_n|375x500](upload://j2X1Cu3chNbIGyx4RIeiOhUhT7u.jpeg) 

After initially just wanting a push board I ordered different trucks and wheels at first but quickly changed them for better.

**Week 2.**

A week later, ideas started to pop up went out to the local hardware store to see what ideas I could bring to life I bought some sandpaper paint and went to town on the deck graphics. 

_(Before and after)_

![60738177_2288642877845421_478103316870463488_n|375x500](upload://aKBIQRHcOPS3mjjUdrWITIzXRAn.jpeg) ![61441364_2363333077242884_3171968923033665536_n|375x500](upload://7gn5p1ccspOngVMUwe5qYEegas9.jpeg) 

After getting the deck done I started sleeving motor wires, stripped the mount for paint since it was starting to look bad and I prepared the cutouts for the wires.

![61962631_584352945408092_5299070657701609472_n%20(1)|666x500](upload://2j2o02T9ZyL3ztHUNLnfXQU9uEd.jpeg) ![62041805_448192442674332_6744642579498795008_n|666x500](upload://vAWvDhQRpcJPhOMv9zUzrt2CInV.jpeg) ![62148394_434682307316078_8035469110248734720_n|375x500](upload://3zjn5gyVtKMECfR9GwDe5OzNIYC.jpeg) 

**Week 3.**

Almost a month in! All parcels should have arrived at this point _(Eboosted one missing due to customs)_ so I started preparing the cutouts and all the parts so It's ready to mount. 

![62486920_2315233292078466_4594546990087405568_n|666x500](upload://yFS1b2xe1ELRhPhkRE3Xu4l5Gg2.jpeg) ![64230320_344440706267729_1763800703186239488_n|666x500](upload://eY9xEBeTkSq1ZCM3is2gocKEkwN.jpeg)


**Few days later.**

Got the last things!

Started out on the project, got all holes drilled channels prepared things soldered and everything made!

Pretty happy with the outcome, I still need to order a bashguard so I have a way to sort the wires out 

_Few things I'm considering swapping out:_

**Wheels for Caguamas**

**Mounts for Eskating.eu**

**VESC for Unity**

Other then that pretty happy with it! Runs amazing, super torque and good range.
Charges in no time and isn't even that heavy.

Eboosted
[/quote]

I'm currently planning on building almost the exact same setup. Are you going to build your battery your self or are you buying it somewhere? I've decided on all parts except for the battery. I also want a range of about 30-40 km but i got quoted $725 for a 10s4p battery (including the enclosure but still)

Damn that's not bad. I guess ill go with that as well:)!  But does their battery really fit in the Eboosted Enclosure 10s4P? Isn't Electricboardsolutions battery 30cm long and the Eboosted Enclosure exactly 30 cm long as well?

You just ask him to make it fit and it will, he made for it before.

But any double stack 10s4p should fit it.

This build is coming along real nice! How did you mount the eboardsolutions mount? Did you use loctite or just screw it down as hard as you could? The reason I am asking is since I do not seem to be able to mount it correctly as it gets a bit loose from time to time

You always wanna use threadlocker on all bolts on mounts like these, else they will get loose from riding.

When i ordered it i specifically asked for it to work in your enclosure so I sure hope it does since @e.board_solutions said he made for it before.

Also planning on redoing the entire post once the parts are all here and i start building.

Hey Lumaci, really nice job there, the board already looks pretty.

Do you already tried to ride it without electronic ? 
How do you feel that vanguard ?!
