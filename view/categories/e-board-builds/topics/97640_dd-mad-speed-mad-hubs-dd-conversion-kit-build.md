Simple recepie, lots of hard work, (courtesy of @pookybear) and some borrowed components also @pookybear The results are amazing! So far able to top out at 43MPH...the speed is insane this Direct Drive is nuts! 
Although the drives I received need a little attention, and I believe a loose magnet may have blown two of my vescs, This comunity is really coming through with the support! Thanks to @pookybear who let me borrow his DD kit and also his FSESC 6.6 Dual, I am not only up and boarding, but also boarding on what is a very sweet and smooth set up! I know the TB battery and enclosure is not ideal, due to its size and the discharge BMS, also my old sector 9 deck is not the best, but it works well, and handles beautifully! In the future I am hoping to migrate this build either to a HAYA or maybe a Hummie, but for now this will work. 

A little about the drives themselves. As with other DD set ups and Hub motor builds, breaking at low speeds is not very good, but I'm talking about under 5 Mph. Also hill climbing, still playing with settings but so far it's not as good as my previous belt drive set up...but I wasn't really expecting it to be. Currently my settings are:

Battery 30A
Motor 60A/-60A
Sensorless 

The torgue is great, and I have not tested the 60amp set up on a big hill yet, will test that later today and post my findings. Also I understand that with the gigantic TB wheels I am expecting to see less torgue.

This is all I got for you at the moment, feel free to ask question, this is my first build thread, also input is appreciated. Again big shout out to @pookybear for helping me make this happen! And of course @rey8801 for organizing the group buy!

The label on the hub give the final touch...love it :yum:

For the low speed braking that is common with hub motor due to the low rolling resistance. Since you use FESC you can set active braking at low speed.

Yes, we're going to try that next. Active braking works for elofty drives. So I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work for this drive. :crossed_fingers:t4:

I ma trying with TCp thorugh Metr.pro.

So this the setting I guess:

@pookybear
28 magnets(Or 14 magnetic pole pairs) on the rotor‚Ä¶
24 stator poles. Stator poles don‚Äôt count in our analysis.

so this still holds.
7*14*1000000/(60*pi*110)=4726

7kmh = 4.35mph 

So on flats, I assume it'll move you in reverse. Downhill, depending on steepness level, it "should" hold you. I have not tried this yet.

yeh the metr. TCP bridge works nad I set the PPm to Current, Then limited the reverse but if I try in the room it still goes really fast in reverse.

Ok now it works! I will try on street. You calculated 4726 fro the 110mm  wheels?
So for 97mm will be 4167 I guess.

Ok rode home with this setting. It works 200%. Even too much. I would say half of the value you calculated are already good. I could fully brake because the first time I did I approced the cross by sliding the last meter üòÅ. It also held me on slope. But you have to be more conscious about brakong because otherwise they try to go reverse that's why better to lower it I think. I will try around 2000 next time.
I aspected as I'm the Ackmaniac firmare thst reverse is only engaged from fully stop wheels but actually no if you go full reverse or even close to that it will start trying to go reverse and lock your wheels.

I set it to 4167. I made a quick proportion from your value. But I think half is fine
Since you don't want to go reverse lower should prevent thst a bit, stil not final solution for me. Should make an active braking mode that stops as soon you actually go reverse. Maybe I will try a - 500/1000. Just for science. It really brakes hard. Now slide is so easy üòÇ

Yes that what I am gonna try next. Plus the nano X has short throw. I am waiting the Flipsky for a while now. I will play with the curve to make it less invasive during braking so to engage the 100% really at the end.

The value doesn't matter. The less the better because you are not thrown off the board if you accidentally forget to let go of the brake as the board will start moving back.. However motor cogging happens if it's too low. You can set it to 1000, 500 etc and see the effect.

It doesn't affect the braking strength, only the reverse speed...what affects the braking strength is the -motor current.

Yea, we have set -55 on @Skyart15 s units. Board was literally rolling downhill while he was on full brakes with no load. So I figured the only way to have better downhill brakes is your active braking method.

* 60
* -55
* 30
* -14

Yeah yeah, I understand that and know that would happen with direct drives. All I am saying is that is with the "current" mode, the value of reverse erpm doesn't affect the braking strength, only the reverse speed of the board. 

Your -55 motor current will work a lot better with "current" mode, because before when the ESC would effectively short the three phases, not even close to -55 would be passing.

Ah okay. Well the nrf51-vesc is also available from flipsky to but for $9, not not at all expensive.

Some people don't want to support trampa and hence don't want to use vesc_tool, but otherwise there is no reason not to use the latest developments with vesc-tool. It's really nice. 

I put up an instruction how to use the app. It's easy peasy.

No it doesn't. Trampa mentioned in some discussion. I wouldn't dare. Ackmaniac is based on watt mode. @Skyart15 you can flash the latest  original vesc tool and try. Although if the module doesn't connect to the phone then that shouldn't be related with the vesc but only incompatibility between phone and module

Better throttle feel for me personally. And the new Vesc tool GUI is too "automated". I'm just so old school and used to the old interface.

I tried it on Vesc tool 1.08

You don't need to pay for the app just for testing. Search for a BLE terminal app or similar for IOS on the market. They are able to detect the BLE module. If you see it and can connect then you know the module will work

BLE scanner is easy to use and works great. Check if an IOS version exists.

[quote="mishrasubhransu, post:51, topic:97640"]
Why do you need ack firmware?
[/quote]

There are a bunch of reasons, with pros and cons of course.

- ackmaniac app compatibility for modes (ackmaniac app has nice csv log files, and starts logging immediately on connect, nice if you try to log every ride)

- better failsafe behavior

- cruise control using second ppm channel

- works with hm-10 modules which helps if you've been building for a while or have many boards

- I remember reading a post from ack saying most of the code changes are for UI, and that nothing significant changed in the motor control loop, which I agree is the important part

BTW @Skyart15 @pookybear nice build, thanks for posting! Love the tape!

I'm not anti trampa. I own 2 trampa vesc6. My friends and I pre-ordered 3 trampa wand remote. I chose ackmaniac due to personal preference and it works for me. Just that. In fact, I recommended it to @Skyart15 when 2 of his fsesc6  broke.

So I just got back from a ride, and it was a spirited ride for sure ![Screenshot_20190701-130343_Speedbot|690x335](upload://u7fAodV5niTxahfDXHCloXz4k6R.jpeg) 
The question I have is, i can barely touch the motor casings lol they are pretty hot I'm guessing in the 160-170f range how does that kind if tempraturw not melt the insulation on the motor leads? ![20190701_131301|375x500](upload://8vR889tnn4qz1P1sNBoXcpK6IFh.jpeg)

Well. You should rephrase that to, "how is the sticker/tape still there and not melted?" :rofl:

well insulation should be good up to 220C. Anyhow you really got them hot. Even if I push them a lot they are hot but never got so high. I guess I leave them the time to cool down a bit while riding.

Not sure if this applies to esk8 motors. In the RC world and in most situations, we gear it based on temps and laptimes. Stock racing. Optimal temp for RC motors is ~160. Anything over ~170ish is just wasted heat because they don't get any faster despite gearing it heavier. 

I don't know anything about these Mad DD motors. IMO, 160F at the end of a ride is still acceptable. Of course I have no data to back this up. This is solely based my experience w RC 10th scale motors since '06. RC brushless didn't start until maybe a few years later after that.

Ok so this set up is working for climbing this particular hill ![Screenshot_20190701-155020_Speedbot|690x335](upload://5CR7D9mFUOgagWGQpFrpomXfAfS.jpeg) 
As you can see at the top of the hill I was doing around 14mph, this is with me entering the hill at the bottom at about 21mph. Ideally I would like more torgue, what do you think @pookybear shall we try 80 motor amps? üòÜ is my only saving grace at this point...smaller wheels?

I tried up to 70A and didn't feel to much difference. To me 60A is the max current for this motor. I use 70A but do;t feel to much difference and you already get them really hot. For more torque you need smaller wheels.
I really don't feel the need of more torque with my wheels. It's constantly accelerating.
Also depends on the rider weight of course. I am 83-85kg now while riding.

Btw: factory rates them at 50A. So we are already over the limit. Also a belt drive will need new gear  ratio going from 90mm wheels to 110mm. This hubs where designed for 90mm.

So tried these new setting max reverse - 2000 and motor min - 60A. Now the active braking is smoother and predictable. I like it. It really stops you no problem

Too much current and you can demagnetize the permanent magnets or weaken them. These are low kv so for the same current they produce a lot stronger magnetic field than for the same current on a high KV motor.

True. They need less current to output same torque. They use magnets rated up to 150C. I won't risk to go close to that. With the wheels you are using it's clearly speed oriented as you could see so torque has to go down a bit. Probably still fine but if you search only hills climbing then better gear or belt drive to me. If it's a mix for riding around and have fun then it's fine. If you want more torque go down with the wheels size. Already 100mm should give you more.

Magnets seem to be in place, but there are quite a few what look like shavings of some sort in the bottom of the black can cover.

Ok. Well the CAN with magnets is glued to th front so you should have remove the front panel and then remove the CAN with magnets thst comes off with the front bearing ecc...
Anyhow the can looks ok. I think the problem is probably in the stator then but then it's difficult to say it. When you hand spin the motor try to short 2 of the phase wires at the time and feel if becomes harder to turn.

yes I would remove the front screws and take the front panel and glue it with the motor can. Check my tutorial video and you will see that the motor is assemble together since the beginning. The parts slide on top of it.

I was checking the video. The first wire you are pointing seems the junction of the 3 motor phase wires in the wye configuration. the second thing attached to the sensor is like a heat shrink or what?

Anyhow if this one shorts on the metal can you need to heat shrink it back. Otherwise the motor won't work. You can test it with a meter.

It shorts to that piece that backing piece that you see on there, can I trim it a little and then heat shrink it? I think part of the problem is that, that tail is to long

It should be after the not of the 3 phase wires so it doesn't have any role. Maybe remove the old heat shrink to be sure. A short in that spot is definitely a problem.
