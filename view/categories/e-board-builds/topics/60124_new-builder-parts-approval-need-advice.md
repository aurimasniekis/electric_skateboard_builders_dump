Hey, I’m looking to build my first electric longboard and am looking for some advice/review from more experienced people before I pull the trigger on all my purchases. I’ve done a lot of research on this forum and in general, but I still don’t feel like I fully know what I’m doing. My goal for this first build is just to have something that works, I don’t necessarily care that much about the top speed or torque as long as it can make it up a decently sized hill. If this works, I may just try to reuse most of the parts and buy more powerful batteries/motors for future builds. My budget is average, don't want to spend a ton but am willing to pay more if necessary to get better parts. For reference I weigh about 150lbs so I’m not a super heavy guy. 

So here is my plan categorized based on the part:

Longboard itself: Likely just going to buy a used one on kijiji, not too concerned about the quality I have a couple nice ones that I would prefer to just keep the way they are. So the wheels will likely be 70mm, I figure if I need more clearance room I can buy larger wheels if necessary.

Motor: Leaning towards this one: https://www.banggood.com/N5065-320KV-1820W-Outrunner-Brushless-Motor-For-Electric-Scooter-Skate-Board-DIY-Kit-p-1270024.html
rmmds=search&stayold=1&cur_warehouse=CN 

320kV, from what I’ve heard ideally you want between 200-300kV so I figure 320 should be okay if I’m not aiming for a high top speed (although I believe the kV is more of an indication of the motors power, so please let me know if this will not provide enough torque – again I’m pretty light)

ESC: This is the one I’m having the most trouble deciding. I kinda want to buy a VESC from Enertion even though it is pretty expensive, since I could reuse it for future builds. I have Linux so I think I can manage the installation and tweaking of the VESC. One other concern I have with this is that I heard Enertion shipping can take a very long time (I live in Canada). 

The other option I was looking into was the Maytech VESC which is cheaper, but I heard is more unreliable. I don’t think I need FOC mode so maybe it would be a better choice to get this. 

Batteries: I’m looking mainly at buying two of these: https://www.banggood.com/DC-12V-8000mAh-Super-Rechargeable-Protable-Lithium-ion-Battery-Pack-p-969148.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN 

I’m confused about the C rating about these however. I read all the battery guides and the consensus seemed to be that lithium ion is slightly better than lipo and will last longer? These also come with a charger so it seems like a good deal. If I run these in series it will provide 24V which I read is usually sufficient, and the 8000mAh is a good capacity. There’s no C rating I can see but I guess that its mainly for lipo and not lion batteries. 

Drivetrain: From the drivetrain guide, it seemed a 5mm pitch was the best way to go, so I’m looking at buying these parts: 

Pinion- https://www.ebay.ca/itm/HTD-5M-15T-16W-5-6-6-35-8-10-12-7mm-Bore-Pitch-5mm-Timing-Belt-Drive-Pulley-15T/252402866384?hash=item3ac46218d0:m:mqPLXSwNb81pLApP7iWEZCw 
Spur - https://www.ebay.ca/itm/HTD-5M-36T-16W-5-20mm-1-4-1-2-Bore-Pitch-5mm-Synchronous-Timing-Belt-Pulley/262472824293 
Belt - https://www.ebay.ca/itm/270-5M-HTD-Timing-Belt-54-Teeth-Cogged-Rubber-Geared-Closed-Loop-15mm-Wide/262536854413?hash=item3d206a7b8d:g:spEAAOSwIgNXkH8i 
 
I’m not really sure how to mount this to the trucks, I read some guides saying I need to weld it but I’d like to avoid that if not absolutely necessary. 

As an alternative, perhaps it would be better for a beginner to buy a drivetrain kit with a mount like this and avoid the issue of welding stuff on altogether? https://www.amazon.ca/XCSOURCE-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-OS915/dp/B073GXFV2L/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1530030403&sr=8-2&keywords=electric+longboard+motor+mount 

Overall, I’m hoping I can get some pointers in the right direction, and if anyone has the time perhaps serving as mentor of sorts that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

About kV: I think you got that one wrong. More kV actually means more speed and less torque. Depending on your gearing, 320 kV may be too much unless you plan to go super fast. This calculator is handy: http://calc.esk8.it/

About VESC: You may want to look at the [ESCape](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/escape-group-buy-professional-pcb-assembly/49720) from @stewii, which is a great value for the money.

This is an option for pre-built. Then you don't have to worry about any of the drive train not lining up which causes you to shred belts every 10 miles (I know from experience).

@HillRipper21 I would recommend a 6374 motor for a single drive. 

-These ones are good although you need an adapter to mount the sensor wires. collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv
-These are new to the market but appear to be decent for budget boards in your price range. You will need to make wire extensions for these motor wires though.  https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6374-192kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html?___store=en_us

A few things that you didn't include in your post to keep in mind. 
1: Switches. Are you planning to do a keyloop (Inexpensive) or anti-spark switch (Super clean but $60) collections/electrical-connectors/products/on-off-power-switch-electric-skateboard
2: Charger. This depends on the voltage you use. If you use a 6s battery then you can use a knockoff lipo balance charger (https://www.ebay.com/itm/iMAX-B6-Lipo-NiMh-Li-ion-Ni-Cd-RC-Battery-Balance-Digital-Charger-Discharger/262442674824?epid=26012372770&hash=item3d1acd6a88:g:L4kAAOSwfC9XPAQy) But if you want the higher power and speed of higher voltages, you need a BMS and computer style charger. https://www.ebay.com/itm/36V-10S-35A-Li-ion-Lipolymer-Battery-BMS-PCB-with-BALANCE-for-ebike-escooter-zhn/332345638994?epid=2178005659&hash=item4d61580052 with https://www.ebay.com/itm/42V-2A-Power-Adapter-Charger-For-2-Wheel-Self-Balancing-Hoverboard-Scooter-Cord/332609511578?epid=13017551914&hash=item4d7112609a 
I recommend using higher voltages especially with a single drive.
Edit:
You also didn't mention enclosure. Kydex and aluminum/plastic box
products/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-12s2p
This is a great deal because you eliminate the need for a BMS and enclosure as they are included
Edit: It also includes the nice on/off switch

Ok so I gathered a few things, so the belt should be at least 15mm to avoid issues, and it is best to buy some sort of kit for the drivetrain to avoid issues. This would include the motor as well within this kit too correct? But I assume the ESC is not relevant to the drivetrain. 

For the ESC I think im sold on the one from hobby king you linked earlier. I'm not sure about buying that $700 dollar kit, for me in CAN it would be a lot more plus $80 international shipping. Also I don't think they have the guide up for it yet.

And benjamin do you mind elaborating why that battery I linked is not good? I thought it had the proper voltage and capacity, I did the calculation using watt hours and came out to around 20km of use. 

Thanks for the help so far.

I can help. These batteries only total 3s. So you could wire them in series to get the voltage you are looking for. I would begin to question the quality of the batteries and the actually capacity for that price. You are also likely to run into issues with the discharge of them considering they are advertised for cameras not esk8's. I would recommend either 2 or 4 of these batteries. You would wire 2 of them in series to get the right voltage and then you would want to of those packs wired in parallel if the budget allows. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-3s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html?___store=en_us

We eskater need alot of current during acceleration and while driving up a hill. Depending on weight, wind, gearing ect the need will increase or decrease. Since we can't slap 100+ cells on or under our decks we need cells that have a good amount of Discharge Current so that we dont need alot of P groups and reduce the stress on each single cell.
Right now the most famous Cells are Samsung 30Q, Sony VTC6, Samsung 25R and the LG HG2, correct me if am wrong here. Some work better in 4p+ like the 25R, the others do fine in 3p+.
Also you don't want your battery to ever run at the limit for longer periods of time, they get hot and also it reduces life and capacity

70mm seems kinda small for my liking... plus a lot of those wheels ddont have cores for the drive pulleys.... maybe 73mm flywheels the smallest ive seen personally... if your not using a kegel pulley maybe consider 90mm flywheel clones if price an issue

I have only just finished my first build so my experience is limited, but from what I have read, people generally recommend VESC 6 (that would be the ESCape) over VESC 4.12 (that would be the one from HobbyKing) for single motor setup since with a single motor the VESC needs to supply high amps and 4.12 then tends to overheat.

Also, with VESC 6 in FOC mode there's not really need for a sensored motor. Sensorless motors are cheaper and slightly easier to wire up (you don't need the sensor wires). So you would pay more for the VESC, but would save a little bit on the motor. You would still end up paying more (~$160 ESCape + ~$65 motor), but it's not that much of a difference and your setup would be more reliable. Here's one option for sensorless: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

You may want to do some more reading in the forum on VESC 4.12 and single motor setups before deciding.

```
Ok so I read all the responses and taking all your advice into consideration, I’ve narrowed it down further. So firstly for the ESC, @janpom  mentioned how the 4.12 may get overheated with just one motor. I researched this and found some people kinda supporting this idea but to be safe I guess the 6 is better.

Also, to support this the vesc that @Trdolan03 linked is cheaper than the enertion one, but with shipping and converting it to CAN its about $120.  The Enertion one is on sale for $180 Australian (https://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/FOCBOX-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/#trustspot-widget-wrapper) which is basically level with CAN so $180. Hence, I think it’s worth it to spend a bit more for the Enertion one especially while this sale is on. 

The batteries I’ll take TrDolan’s advice and go with the 2 of the 3s Zippy ones from hobby king. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-3s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html?___store=en_us 

About these batteries, is it better to get the version with the XT-60 or this version without? https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-20c.html. They are essentially the same price, but I’m not entirely sure about the significance of this component from what I can gather from the internet it is a power connector. Again my technical knowledge is quite limited so I’m not sure what this means in practical terms.

Linked to this is the switch TrDolan was talking about. I found this guide http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204/4 on how to make one which seems interesting, and I assume I can safely substitute at XT-60 for the Xt-90 and this will work with my batter set-up? 

And for charging, the balance charger you linked before is sufficient for those batteries I assume (https://www.ebay.com/itm/iMAX-B6-Lipo-NiMh-Li-ion-Ni-Cd-RC-Battery-Balance-Digital-Charger-Discharger/262442674824?epid=26012372770&hash=item3d1acd6a88:g:L4kAAOSwfC9XPAQy) 

On to the drivetrain, I think based on what you guys are saying it is hard to get right as a beginner, so I may go with the pre-built one you linked earlier: collections/featured-items/products/single-motor-mechanical-kit 
Pretty expensive bcuz its USD and shipping is a lot from this website but I couldn’t find any good alternatives, if you guys know of any pls let me know. With the motor I’m looking at ill select the 63mm option and 83mm wheels. You guys also recommended a 15mm belt but this one is only 12mm, is that enough or no?

And for the motor the consensus seemed to be that the one I picked earlier was not powerful enough (@Benjamin899) , I found this one https://www.banggood.com/18-29V-170KV-2900kw-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-High-Efficience-Brushless-DC-Motor-p-1240567.html?gmcCountry=CA&currency=CAD&utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=cpc_elc&utm_content=felix2&utm_campaign=pla-all2-ca-en-pc&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5PaMi_3z2wIVxbjACh3w-ALwEAYYAyABEgLqE_D_BwE&cur_warehouse=USA 
for a good price bcuz the total price has gotten a bit higher than I wished already. It is sensorless but that is okay if I use the FOC mode right?

I hope I covered everything. And thanks guys for all the input I appreciate it. All this stuff is intimidating for a beginner haha

The XT60 is the connector on the battery leads. It makes no difference assuming you know how to solder.

The reason that you use xt90 is because they have anti-spark connectors while they don't make them for the xt60. https://www.amazon.com/Amass-Anti-Spark-Connector-Quadcopter-Brushless/dp/B07C2TGC3J/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1530121963&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=anti-spark+xt90&psc=1

Yes, this charger will be just fine for charging those batteries. You may need to do a little bit of wiring to get the balance cable to the outside of the box for balance charging.

Ok what you need to know about lipos is that you never rly know how good the batch is, some people are very pleased (me) some are not. But in general they have less cycles in them compared to a Li Ion battery made 18650 or others, so at the end if you are realy going to use the board daily Li-Ion tend to be the better choice value wise, but if you just want to build for first build and test out, why the hell not.
I personally don't like that motor but only because the phasewires are so thin, dunno what the other here thing about that, but i could be wrong. Again depending where you live it could all mean nothing or everything.
To the topic of vesc6, since the price has dropped to this price point i don't realy see an issue there, so i would go for one.
@dickyho also sells motors, just ask him if you need something.

I agree with @Benjamin899 that the thin phase wires on the motor look weird. Just get something well tested by the people here. The Turnigy SK3 is only $10 more.

The iMAX B6 is fine. Beware though that it comes without a power supply, so you'll need to get one unless you already have a 12V one that outputs at least 5A. There's also a [version](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6-ac-dc-charger-5a-50w-with-us-plug-copy.html) that you can plug directly to AC power source.

[This balance lead adapter](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/6s-battery-pack-balance-charge-adapter-lead.html
) is handy if you'll want to balance charge both of your batteries at the same time.

To connect the batteries in series, you'll either need to solder on another connectors ([4mm bullet connectors](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/polymax-4mm-gold-connectors-10pairs-set.html) are cheap and widely used) or if you want to avoid soldering, you could get one of [these](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-series-1pc.html).

Ok I'll go with the SK3 then, the sensorless one @janpom linked earlier (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) because I can just use the FOC mode on the VESC 6. 

Also, can someone please explain the key loop/anti-spark switch? There was a couple forums here I found but nothing too beginner friendly. Would I be able to follow this guide https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204/4 having very little electronic experience? If the keyloop is easier do you guys have any good places to buy them from, I couldn't find much on the internet.

Looks nice and clean (not mine)

This should make it even more obvious:
![loop_key|266x252](upload://zfUiIWg1PqpDXjq5rK6bAHn5HE2.png)

It's basically using the XT-90 anti-spark connector as a poor man's switch. Connecting the shorted female part (at the top) to the male part closes the circuit.

The downside is that you'll need to have the female part sticking out of your battery compartment all the time.

You could get a [regular switch](https://www.proto-boards.com/product-page/vedder-spark-switch-assembled-kit-uk), but they are a bit expensive.

How do you actually plan to do your battery compartment?

Thanks, that is a good picture I'll definitely use that.

I was gonna use the 2 3s Lipos in series, and if thats not enough juice I'll buy 2 more. And I have a little bit of experience soldering but not a lot, so I think i'll buy this https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-series-1pc.html which you suggested to avoid soldering. 

And okay, I think I can handle making that then, might as well give it a go those XT-90s are way cheaper than a switch anyways. That graphic clears it up for sure.

@HillRipper21  there are also AS150 used as Anti Spark Switchtes. Deckoz used it in his Evo build.

I had to look it up. Found it here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/master-evo-landyachtz-abec-107-13s5p-focbox-6374-190kv-metr/44411/85

That's a nice solution. I like it much better than the XT90 loop. It's less bulky and when you unplug the connector, it remains attached to the enclosure, so you can't lose it.

Uh is this the specific post I should follow? https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/master-evo-landyachtz-abec-107-13s5p-focbox-6374-190kv-metr/44411/160?u=hillripper21 

And is it basically the same idea with that graphic you linked earlier but with the AS150 instead of the XT90?

Yes, the same idea. Just a different kind of "switch". AS150 is a single cable connector, so it's really simple. No need to short anything. Just put the male part on one end and the female part on the other.

This I just from my experience but I started my first build in a similar way without very much knowledge. I had a 6s single drive with a hobby esc and cheap drive train... it sucked. 

For a basic standard board I would recommend 10s, 83-97mm wheels, 2.4 gear ratio and a vesc. 

I am on a budget for all my boards as I am in high school still but with enough time a lot can be done, the best thing I can advise you to do is search for the cheapest good parts or make your own. 

This is my current two boards

Hm okay, I may buy another one of the zippy ones then, is it weird to do 9s? I've heard of 6s, 10s and 12s but never 9s lol. 

And okay, i'll probably go with the AS150 for the anti spark. 

Still having some trouble stomaching the cost for the mechanical kit from diyelectric, the 40 USD shipping is killing me. I can't find anywhere else that sells a full mechanical kit save for cheap ones from ebay/amazon like this: https://www.ebay.ca/itm/DIY-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-Kit-Part-Pulleys-Motor-for-80mm-Wheel-OS914/372350444599?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20160908105057%26meid%3D3ee205448ac24eb5a05b98d845626534%26pid%3D100675%26rk%3D4%26rkt%3D15%26sd%3D323109578758%26itm%3D372350444599&_trksid=p2481888.c100675.m4236&_trkparms=pageci%3A18730de8-7cb8-11e8-984e-74dbd180d6fe%7Cparentrq%3A52e4aed11640a9e8318caffffff666ed%7Ciid%3A1 

Which uses a 3mm pitch which I heard is not recommended. If you guys have another source for a mechanical kit please let me know. 

Another option would be to instead get the $120 motor (vs. the sensorless one from hobbyking: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) from diyelectric as well to reach 300 US and get free shipping, products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv. I've read a couple of reviews for their motors on here and they seem pretty reliable. But I don't get why its $30 more than this one, which seems to have almost identical specs to me products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv.
