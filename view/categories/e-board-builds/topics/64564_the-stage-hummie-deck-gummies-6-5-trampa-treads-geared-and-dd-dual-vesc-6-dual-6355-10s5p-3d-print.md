This time I will make a build log and not post everything after months of riding :grin:

As the name suggest's, this build will be made in multiple stages, but the final configuration I hope to achieve is:

* Hummie Deck
* Dual VESC 6
* Dual 5055 or 6355
* Custom made helical gear drive or a custom made direct drive
* 10S5P or 10S10P
* Gummies and 6.5" Treads for versatility
* TB 218mm trucks
* Modified @solidgeek remote
* @SimosMCmuffin BMS
* Integrated front and rear lights
* 3D printed enclosure

The first stage I will basically transplant all electronics from  my previous build to the @Hummie deck , changing the trucks for TB 218mm, and putting some Gummies on them

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/agace-cruiser-33-dual-5055-dual-vesc-6-paris-195mm-10s3p-ncr-ga-kegels-lots-of-3d-print/64307

After that I want more range, so at minimum 10S5P of NCR18650GA and ideally 10S10P of them, this may change as new cells come to market and hopefully the price of 21700/20700 cells goes down and energy density improve

And the final stage is changing the drive train, ideally I want to do a direct drive, that is the final project that I'm working on my degree, but it may be two years until it's done. The backup plan is making a helical geared drive. I may be able to use my current mount and just order the gears and make a 3D printed cover

For now I just have some sketches to see if I can use use the existing mount with the Gummies

Deck, wheels and trucks are ordered, unfortunately customs here work snail pace, so it may be a lot of time until I receive them

Just playing around to see how its best to modify my mount to fit the new profile, unfortunately these is no easy/cheap way to make the angle adjustable, but it appears that I can rear mount the motors and still have lots of ground clearance

I will need to wait for the actual trucks to arrive, I don't trust this model I downloaded, and also appears that the profile of the TB trucks are bigger than normal calibers

And all this assuming that I top mount the deck

How do you plan on getting the 10s10p to fit on the hummie deck? will either of the packs be flex packs? The Hummie deck does flex but very slightly. Do you have the files for the 3d printed enclosure as well?

Edit:
checked out your previous build where you'll be moving some of your parts from. Are you using the same 3D printed enclosure? Does it also allow for some flex?

```
They will be double stacked, probably I will need to go 10S9P because as you said the deck has a slight curvature

Each P group will be rigid, but the series connection flexible

The enclosure will be all new, I need to have the deck in hands to model it first and also test for flex, if it’s just a little bit the ABS can handle just fine and it will be easier to print since I can make it flat and use the screws to curve it, Hummie said that the arc will be about 3mm down at the middle of the compartment in comparison to the edges

With a wide axle a la TB218 I'd go for a sleeve motor mount design just like what Trampa is using or what kuglis is doing in his gear drive. It's bullet proof and easy to maintain.

Thanks for the idea, if I have to make a new mount I will probably look into doing that way

For now my old mount will be used, it’s just a matter of enlarging the circular that was used to mount on the Paris, way cheaper because this mounts were expensive to machine (but still cheaper than ordering a decent one from overseas)

Looking a lot better with the cover. Usually I make the cover with complex curves, but since the Gummies are almost a disc, a simple cover ended looking better

Also modeled the 6.5" tires, I may need to shift everything a bit to clear the belt from it

Now it's obvious that I will need to drop mount the trucks, may need to sand a lot of the tail of the deck

Not much to update, still waiting for the trucks

But two new decisions

First, on all my board I routed the motor wires thought the middle of the deck, but it's a lot of work. Also for this board I want sensors on the motors, and to this day I haven't found a connector good for this
My plan was to 3D print a channel, extend the motor and sensor wires and plug directly on the VESC, but since the Hummie deck has a drop it would be a pain do print it right
This pictures than Frank posted made me realize that it will be a lot easier and look way better just to use mesh on the wires and send them to the back of the enclosure
I just need to find a way to waterproof the wires hole

Second, I dropped the idea of 10S10P, too bulky, instead if need a will plug a range extender directly on the charge port like @skatardude10 did
I have a old 10S3P made of NCR18650B that will become a 7S4P to power the boost converter

Or alternatively put a XT60 somewhere on top of the deck to directly connect another battery, the only problem I can see with this is accidentally connecting a battery with a different voltage

Yep, thanks. I wanted to do one for a long time, but the price of custom gears arround here is too expensive

That was until I found these gears on AliExpress, expent the most part of this week designing and tweaking 

http://s.aliexpress.com/uAfaUzqQ

http://s.aliexpress.com/fqMruE3E

I just wanna make sure that will be cheaper by sending the design for a few local manufacturers, if I order these ones there’s still need to send them for a machine shop to make a few modifications that will add to the cost

Thanks guys

There’s a few that I need to think, any input is appreciated 

1- If all sealing is well designed, the only remaining point for the oil to scape is through the motor bearing, if needed I plan to swap them with rubber sealed ones

2- the losses of the seal according to this diagram from SKF is way too high and would defeat one of the main goals I had going gear drive, 100W loss on each drive is simply not acceptable 



http://www.skf.com/us/products/seals/industrial-seals/power-transmission-seals/radial-shaft-seals/friction/index.html


EDIT: made a mistake with loses, forgot to consider the reduction, so the loses are more like 25W per drive

I’ve found a few Teflon based seal that could further reduce that

TB trucks are in, need to check if the CAD model I have are accurate, but at first glance it’s not, probably will be easier to draw a new one

As I suspected the geometry of TB trucks were quite different from the model I had downloaded, there's only two flat faces on the hanger, the board side has a really small curvature that needs to be considered if you want a perfect fit with the mount

Also the baseplate is completely different in a good way, since the pivot is farther out, you get more clearance between the motors and the bolts, but the hanger body is wider, and because of that I had to mount the motor a little bit lower

I still need to check if the axle is  in the right place since the small curvature makes it a paint to measure

With Urban Treads:

Note that this is with 10S5P, my current 10S3P will perform a bit worse

My biggest fear is to overheat the motors when using the 6,5" wheels with this gear ratio, probably will install a NTC in them just to be safe and also convert them back to sensored 

The gear drive is designed to work with 63mm motors, just need a new plate and a new 3D printed case

Made a few more changes to the geared drive

First changed the truck fixture so there is a part of it that mates with the lase cut steel plate to guarantee a better alignment 

![image|560x500](upload://emGFJECRmISiAUXvoDTmclEMmFe.png)

Second, now the wheel adapter is one piece, this way the steel spacer can be smaller and lighter, but the main purpose is so I can easily adjust how much compression there is in the sealing o-ring

The sealing works likes this. when you tighten the wheel it pushes the gear assembly, that pushes the bearing and compress the o-ring so no oil can leak when the board is running or when it is sideways, I highlighted it in the third photo

And we have oil, just wanted to have an idea how much I have to put in. At this level it's 4,5 ml, it should be enough, the problem with this design is there's not much empty space around the gears, so the oil level will change a lot when it gets spread out and may run into oil starvation on the teeth itself, ideally you want from one to three teeth height oil level measuring from the bottom of the gear

The plan is to gradually add oil and see how much power is lost to it and go with the sweet spot

Also gears ordered, should be here in a month or so (but probably way more)

Printed a pulley to see if it fits, and it does perfectly 

But I messed up a setting it the printer and took half an hour with a hammer and a screw driver to remove the supports that were too close to the print itself, also a few drops of blood by missing and hitting my hand 🤚

Hopefully I can tell this weekend, they are still sitting in my desk, I ordered the bearings today, since they are not a common size it takes a few days

Still need to have some custom spacers made to go inside the wheel, but can test without them, and without motors

But my hope for them is to dampen quite a bit more than the kegels, some streets are unridable due to vibration, also go through cracks that currently I have to stop to

Edit: just saw the hand comment 😂
Actually was the pulley that cut my finger, the edges of the 3D printed parts can be quite sharp, now I have a HTD 5M scar!

Oh lol my mistake :laughing: I hadn't realized the need for spacers as well. good thing you brought it up. any reason why they need to be custom made? aren't those 8/10mm spacers or is it due to the spacer length as the hubs are longer?

Now I'm thinking that I'll need some too lol

Took a long time for me to realize also

They are 8mm, but 18mm in length, two skate wheels spacers are 20mm

Will have them made of aluminum and 12,7mm outer diameter since that’s likely the stock they will have

If you want I can have more made and send to you, just have to check because international shipping from here are usually really expensive

Since I had to take my mounts apart to modify, took the chance to clean the motors and change the bearings, lot of dirt inside and all bearings were dry

What a challenge to take this things apart, one of the pulley formed a wedge with the key, the harder I tried to take it out the worse it got, also the motor where this happened one of the can bolts have a broken head, so it wasn't possible to take the axle out and remove the pulley from the other side

But the worse is to take out the small bearings of these 5055 motors, no way to do that without damaging them, and the inner track got stuck in booth motors, only patience and a dremel to cut them in half solved

Was researching about using v-rings instead of the axial seal, unfortunately for use with oil it wouldn't work without complicating the design a lot since the lip has to be on the oil side

![image|226x204](upload://23UqjkEv3kB0nuznzU6Sf4nFe5c.png)

Also is important to seal against dirt getting in since I plan to take this board on the mud and rain and whatever, that would mean a double sealing is needed, making the drive bulkier

![image|213x173](upload://9bh6b1nkQ6Ovc8zrwiQjCQEiyTg.png)

The great thing about them is minimal drag, but if that's become a problem I will see if I can  find the PTFE based radial seal

I've had problems changing out my bearings on my drone motors.  What I found to work the best was to throw them in the freezer for a hour or two and then pull them out and use a bearing puller to get them out.  If that doesn't work.  Use your soldering iron and heat up the bearings and then try that. You may need to repeat both steps but eventually they will work themselves out.  Just my 2 cents worth.

The main piece is here finally, love it, but it hurts with taxes an shipping, a 115 USD deck ended costing 268 USD, I love and hate living here

Will start by enlarging the hole, 15mm in each end and 5mm in each side and them starting routing the phase, sensor and light wires through the deck

More progress, started working on the enclosure, with room to spare it will be 12mm thick (or thin), since it will be 3D printed I will print flat and use the fasteners to adjust to the board, the camber is 6mm lower on the center

In my previous board I made a grid and measured each point height with a dial to build the 3D model so the enclosure could match ir perfectly, but it was too much work and not perfectly unless you do a crazy amount of points, I think I did 150 points and was not nearly enought

Since that I started playing with photogrammetry and tried it on a old deck, the results speak for themselves

![image|690x389](upload://chibWbXKFDbD0K6nm0a51OuS9TC.jpeg) 

So that is how I am going to do in this build. But there is a complication, since I will make the enclosure flat I would have to flatten the 3d scan, no idea how to that with a mesh, if it was a solid it would be easy

The solution? flatten it with two clamps before scanning

Unfortunately the lightning conditions were far from ideal and I will wait for a bteer day to take the pictures for the scanning, it takes roughly 10 hours of processing on my PC, so better do right the first time

Also I ditched the idea of running the wires inside the deck since there is little clearance, and I will probably have to round over the tail to clear the motor and pulleys

Enclosure model ready, just need to split it and print (which involves reassembling part of my printer that needed some maintenance)

After taking a few measurements I realized that the curvature of deck was simple enough to be approximated by a simple cylinder section.

The enclosure is 17mm thick and the highest point, wish to make it thinner, but the JST connectors on top of the VESC 6 made it impossible, if I routed flat the bottom of the compartment I could shave of 3mm, not sure if it's worth, we will see when I enlarge the hole

First section printed, the curvature is almost perfect, good enough considering the foam gasket

But my printer decided to make things complicated, first this black abs wasn’t sticking enough to the bed with the liquid adhesive that I’ve been using for more than a year without problems, so I reverted back to Scotch stick glue and the did it

But the print quality is really bad, will test a few things tomorrow, since I will sand, prime and paint it’s not a big deal

Have you considered switching to PETG from ABS? I assume layer adhesion will play a big deal when it comes to how it looks like you are going to print it (flat upside down?). I've always had hit and miss layer adhesion (though sometimes really good) with ABS, but never had any issues with PETG. Layer adhesion with PETG is *insane*, it will just crack anywhere if it does at all and never along the layer lines. Also, there's rarely any warping off the bed so you can print as large as you want and not have to worry about things popping free normally, unlike ABS. Prints also come out pretty damn good quality, similar enough to PLA, but with a bit more flexibility, and tons of strength like just like ABS. All of my pneumatic hubs and wheel pulleys are printed out of PETG and they have been holding up flawlessly for hundreds of miles so far. 

Then again, with ABS you have acetone smoothing and acetone welding that may come in handy with this project.

Thanks for the suggestion, I want to try it for some time, but arround here is double the price per kg, but with what you said I may give it a try 

Unfortunately welding is a must for this case, I use MEK since the ABS blend I’m using is not soluble enough in acetone

The thing is, using the glue I always used I never had a problem with ABS with things getting loose or first layer problem

I download a new firmware for my printer to enable baby stepping to fine tune the first layer and see if that’s improves things

@PXSS Meshroom

Works really well, but a problem I had is that the deck is too reflexive, you need a really diffuse light to avoid any reflection otherwise it can’t match features since they don’t exist in all the photos

Makes sense. Have you tried adding colors to your deck to help the meshroom recognize the features?

Think about a masking tape grid. It might provide enough contrast/features for the mesh to work better.

My decks all have some bright colors on them so it might not be necessary. I'll post my results next weekend!

I really like 3d scanning idea. I have used Agisoft's photoscan before with great success. Might try it again. If it is a simple deck you can get away with measurements. Measurements along curve and measurements in straight line will perfectly define a concave board. you just have to print a small section to make sure.

PETG tends to ooze but that's a mess. First of all lower your nozzle temperature a lot, perhaps to 210ish.

Other things maybe worth trying:
- Play around with extrusion multiplier setting
- Try a different PETG filament
- Get Capricorn PTFE tubing for more precise filament flow and retraction
- Get a silicone sock for the nozzle, though I'm not sure if they are available for Creality nozzles

@PXSS that was my idea, cover it with something patterned and matte, but as @mishrasubhransu the curvature is simples enough to measure by hand

If don’t have a lot of RAM (16gb+) you need to limit the number of points or it will fail, took me a while to figure out what hell was going on. With 8gb the maximum I could use was 100k points

Also helps a lot to have a powerful GPU since it’s CUDA optimized, but you need to have the latest drivers, it kept failing and no helpful error message to point at the driver

@mishrasubhransu there are a few temperature test print on thingverse that you could use, but by the looks of it it’s indeed too hot, also, your retraction is too big, once you go past 3~4mm and this mess keep happening you know the problem is elsewhere

That filament was very weird. I had done all kinds of calibration test but didn't help. It would ooze at 240 and cause extruder motor to miss steps at 230. Also, stuck to the nozzle very easily. Yeah, the retraction was too high. 

 Got a new PETG filaments (transparent one) and it prints as good as PLA. The temp required is 230-250 so has high temp tolerance.

Questions
1. What material are you printing with 
2. What bed adhesion aid(spray/stick/abs slurry) 
3. What bed temperature?

I would suggest to 
1. preheat the bed with the enclosure for sometime before starting the print. That way there it doesn't experience a significant temperature change.
2. Use a brim?
```

Sure,

1 - ABS MG35

2- I’m using a spray called Abond that’s very common arround here and it’s the thing that adhere the most so far

3- 110C, I will bump to 115 or 120, in open air my bed don’t have enough power to keep, but now in the enclosure shouldn’t be a problem

1 I did, at least one hour before printed, but the first layer on a large part like this takes so long that the enclosure has plenty of time to heat

2 I will have to manually add in CAD but will try tomorrow, thanks. The problem is that the design of this clone is so good that you can’t use all the 200mm or the bottom of the y carriage colides with the frame, I’m limited to 165mm in y direction 

But everything turned out good, just the very corners lifted and the interlocking fits just perfect, a little too loose, currently there is a 0.4mm gap between parts, will reduce that to 0.3 for the remaining sections

Yeah, it doesn't seem bad at all. So what are you going to do about water entering the enclosure during flexing?

BTW, the best stuff to stick ABS to glass is abs slurry. That's basically abs mixed in acetone. When it dries it leaves behind a thin sheet of ABS that the filament absolutely sticks to. I guess you were talking about this stuff?

I guess it must be the same composition as the one I use, what I love about it is that as soon as the bed cools down the part just pop off, sometimes it even fly of the print bed due to the shirinking  (https://www.loja3dxfilamentos.com/adesivo-liquido-15ml-abond-impressora-3d-abs-pla-143880216xJM)

I tired ABS slury in the past and it didn't work as well, also this MG35 ABS is not that soluble in acetone as most ABS's, I have to use MEK that's a little bit stronger, also, that's what I use to cold weld one piece to another, you will damage the part before rupturing the junction, a lot stronger than any glue since you are just fusing the material, off course there is a lot of sanding, priming and painting until the enclosure is ready and really smooth

This is my plan for the brim, what do you think? 3 layers high

You need a VESC for each motor, or you can use some versions that support two motors, they are basically two vesc on the same board, I don’t like because if one of them goes bad you loose both

The 4 as the first VESC released a few years ago, it works fine if you are buying from a reputable seller 

The 6 as your said is newer and has a lot of improvements, it can run FOC much more reliable (FOC makes the motor practically inaudible) and can support higher current without overheating 

The confusion starts when you consider all variations that there is, for example, the FOCBOX is based on the 4.12, but can support much higher currents without overheating and also works perfectly fine on FOC due to some upgrades

The diferente in price is huge, and you get what you pay, I bought the VESC 6 from Trampa that is currently the only oficial source (but anyone can make a VESC since it’s open source) and is pretty high quality and I hope it lasts many years through various builds

Hope to not make you more confused than before

Nice, definitely try the bigger nozzle, 1mm is as high I would go with 1.75 filament or you don’t get enough pressure to have a smooth extrusion

The most important thing is to limit the volumetric flow, the E3D V6 can get to 10mm^3/s, só it don’t even make sense for me to go higher nozzle size since even configuring infill and solid infill to 80mm/s, the maximum I get is 60mm/s to respect the volumetric limit

Strange the 13h for each piece, even at 50mm/s shouldn’t take that long

From what I’ve reads the parts strength go up with nozzle size if you keep the layer height constant since each string gets more squished and has a larger surface area touching the previous layer

Do you have a link for this enclosure? Just for me to see what time it would take here

Deck hole enlarged from 585x145 mm to 605x155 mm

@Mudders for its the 10S3P, I plan to expand it to 5P or change everything to 30Q, probably not, I don’t like the lower range

Maybe go 2070/2170 if anything better appear, for now it’s too expensive, the NCR20700B would be the best

@deucesdown no way I could do that freehand, I forgot to take a picture, but I clamped a wood piece to use as guide

I was really afraid of that, clamped the hardest I could, even if you catch it soon the damage is done, in the end turned out well with just a few hiccups like tipping the router to far and making a shallow hole in some places

Did in 2 passes at most places and there was enough "oh shit" moments

Looking back at some of the cuts I think the router speed should have been a little bit higher for a nicer finish on the carbon layers, maybe up to 40k rpm, but whatever, nobody is gonna see it anyway

Insertes done, somehow after carefully marking everything and make sure all is aligned, one of them ended completely out of position 😐

Not sure what to do, first will see if I can manage to screw it anyway

Regarding the deck, the remaining material seems enough but did you test it already? It reminds me of last year when I pressed my first and last DIY deck (Bustin clone). I also removed wood for electronics. After about 1 week work I've mounted trucks and stepped on it just for testing..... well it instantly cracked :roll_eyes:

Thanks rich, will try for sure, the enclosure for the last board lasted a week without scratches, lets see if I beat it

I think I will be ok, it was just 5mm each side, I should've tested the flex before routing to see if it changed
 

First wheel is assembled, perfect aligned, much easier than any long board wheel to get it true. that being said this mounting solution is not final, I don't know if it will be to mount the Urban Treads with 75 psi this way, but the space is really limited, I had to leave out some section of the pulley so I can hold the nuts with pliers

My plan is to find some steel standoffs and use them so secure everything with screws from booth sides, this way the wheel integrity is completely independent from the pulley mounting, but that will be for after I get it running

Dude!!!
Thanks for the meshroom tip!
I can make perfect enclosures now that I modeled the surface of the deck. I'll send you pics once I make my next enclosure.

---

Take out the insert. Fill with epoxy. Redrill in correct position. Be careful not to split the deck surface when taking out the insert. When filling witj epoxy use a syringe or something to help you get to the very bottom of the hole, use vaseline and kapton tape on surfaces where you don't want the epoxy to stick. Remove any spots after 45mins to 2hours of curing (depending on the epoxy you used, 45mins for 5min epoxy and 2 hours for 3min epoxy). Hot bot to get it to cure faster afterwards. Match drill your hole or mark it with a punch before drilling :slight_smile:

Do you have pics of the meshroom result?

Thanks for the tip with the inserts, I will probably have to drill with a large bit to destroy the insert completely, they are super glued in place and the brass is really soft, so no way can I put the needed torque in it to break apart

Show me a picture.
You can always soak the superglue in acetone to get it to break down. Works great on clothes too!!!! I'd be careful as I don't know what it would do to the deck's laminating resin...

Here are some pictures from meshroom and meshlab.

The meshroom results included a big portion of my kitchen so I removed those using Meshlab. I also simplified the surface as it originally had over a 500,000 faces. I need to try Blender for this, I've read it's a lot better at simplifying than meshlab.

Looks great, I need to learn more how to work with meshes, ideally I would like to cut it on the deck outline, import to Solidworks as a surface and them thicken it.

Or somehow do a full 360° scan suspending the deck

Insert repaired, drilled it out and filled the hole with epoxi, also enlarged the enclosure holes to 5 mm since some screws needed more clearance to enter smoothly

I’m all ears for suggestions, will think for a few day before doing something irreversible 

The problems:
-the hanger colides with the deck
-the motor collided with the deck when turning
-the motor collides with the deck when turning
-the mount will collide with the shape when I fix the other problems 

I think the obvious way to solve all is to make a cut to keep the baseplate level with the deck, cutting 5mm into it and will make the board 5mm taller

Enclosure done, unfortunately I couldn’t find the same spray pain anywhere, but this one gave a textured finish that I really liked, hard to show in the pictures , unfortunately the joints are showing, I guess the abs misture being too thick made it really slow to dry and there is still solvent evaporating to this day

Took some time to do the battery level led's, unfortunately screwed up a bit, but would be worse if I tried to fix

Also opened my motors to put sensors and again the small bearings are shot, less than 200 km, the fit with the housing is too tight, I will try to widen them a bit with sand paper until it's uncertain and hold them in place with liquid retainer 

One of the hall sensors on one of the boards is dead, I have some them but I think they are ratiometric

Goodbye old friend and hello new one 

Taking off the double sided tape is a pain, any other suggestions to attaching everything to the board? Mainly the vesc and battery, silicone maybe?

VESC's are in place, used neutral cure silicone, also did a little surgery to change the wires to 14 AWG

Motors also have new bearings, just waiting for the retention fluid to dry

@sayekim Some places yeah, but motors I will weld directly, no space even for bullets, battery is also welded, what I do is on the other side of the battery I have a 3.5mm bullet that allows me to split it and essentially break the circuit

Besides that, the LED's and charge port have connectors to make assembly easier, the signal wires to the VESC  have connectors since it's hard to weld directly to the PCB on VESC 6

@Deodand thanks man, looking forward  what you will come up with with an unlimited supply of Unities and R-Spec hubs, do I hear 8 wheel drive?

It's alive, sensors working flawlessly, never had tried sensored before, really cool having the motor start up with you holding it down, and temperature sensors is a plus, will be able to test how much current this little motors can really take

The only pain is welding these sensor cables, after half an hour of trying to fit a JST-XH contact inside an JST-PH housing I realized what I was doing, but that was after I thought I had forget to order the 6 pin JST-PH, until I found the secret stash

These final steps is where all problems begin to show, the pulley covers are too slim and don’t fit, the motor wires clamp is also too small, but no problem if I can’t get in looking the best and water proof, I travel on the 20, so it has to be ready and tested on the 19 because I want to ride a lot on my trip

Done-ish, this board is amazing, no words for it, the Gummies absorve a lot of vibration and this make the board really quiet as less vibrations goes into the deck and enclosure, the deck also helps a lot

Again, the wheels eat up everything, big crack and rought cement sidewalks that would make the Kegels stop behave like they aren’t there, ridding on grass is not issue and taking it on packed dirt trail will be no problem

Did only a quick ride as my battery was low, I need to get used to it as this is the flexiest board I’ve ridden so far, but the foot placement on the Hummie Deck is really great, it begs for a 10S5P to enable 60+ km rides

Things that need to be done:

-print two phase wires holders

-wire the battery level leds as they are the only indication that the board is on, already forgot it turned on

-install the pulley covers

-install the motor end covers

Don’t worry, by the end of tomorrow it will be plenty dirty, already have a path planed to test it in all kind of terrains

Another thing I forgot to mention, I don’t know how I could live without sensored motors, half of the test ride was stopping or rolling backwards on a hill and going forward again effortlessly, such wow, much fun

You can also use the throttle as a hand brake in uphill, if I’m not mistaken hand brake is supported in 3.40 firmware, but I will only mess with it after my trip, don’t want to screw something up and end boardless

Same problem here, will say more bellow.

Second ride done, lots of thing to say

https://metr.at/r/P8TVz

First, the Gummies. With the Kegels I could ride 40% of the city comfortable, 30% doable but really slow and the remaining I couldn't ride, now I'd say 80% is comfortable to ride and the last 20% I have to take it slower but much faster than with the 80mm wheels

The bad is the consumption, 13.7 Wh/km. that's 41% more than with the Kegels, geared for the same top speed, limited to the same top speed and with the same current limits. Some more rides are needed to see if it's just me that is ridding faster due it being so stable or if the larger diameter has that much influence in rolling resistance

Second, the same problem as @mishrasubhransu, I need to find out the correct beta factor for the thermistors, no way my motor is reaching 75°C, the VESC is limiting power all the time

And last, got it a bit dirty and with some scars, didn't try the dirt trails because it rained a lot last night and the phase wires hole is not waterproof yet

Ok, did a ride limited to 25 km/h, 9,84 Wh/km better, but the wheels definetely consume more than the Kegels

Also checked both vesc's data and they are identical, so it's not any loss on bearings or belt tension

I think one of the thermistors are bad, even at ambient temperature they are a few degrees off from each other, I will try to measure the beta factor tomorrow when I open it again to finish everything

For the Metr app you need their module, I think it’s worth a lot, the support is fenomenal, any bug you send to @rpasichnyk and they look into it right away

Calculated the B values taking measurements at ambient temperature and then heating everything until steady state with a hair dryer, they are not far from the original, but since the calculations is logarithmic it can make a big difference

Indeed, I will see if I have a spare thermistor, not going to put my motor in 100 °C bath 😄

My biggest fear it’s no the motor itself, but the epoxy that is holding the hall sensors, it’s only rated to 80°C, can probably take more since it’s not unde any load

Thanks @sebaszz

First ride in real city, and I almost died lol

The motor reaches 75°C during an extended climb, and when going down on the other side I no brakes when approaching a red light

I’m still not believing that these reading are correct and as a remedy for the time being I increased the temp cut off to 95°C and reduced each motor current to 35 A

It seems looking at the logs that the hysteresis of the temperature measurements is too great, the VESC should reduce power between 75°C and 85°C, but by the time it reaches the lower limit the core is already hotter, even if you just cost with no throttle or brake the temperature keeps climbing 

Other than that this board is perfect for a dense urban environment, the wheels make going from bike paths to sidewalks to roads a breeze, and I can ride in the middle of traffic way more comfortable

The hall sensors make a lot of diference on intersection to quickly accelerate in front of traffic

I’d get one of them cheap ir temp sensor guns and check the temps. 

What was the outside temp?

Compare the temps from the motor reading and the gun then play with the thermistor value to get it right. 
Of course if the readings are correct then I am a bit surprised they also heat up reasonably fast. 

I thought this was only a hub and direct drive problem that they heat up. 

I can’t really test it myself though since there aren’t really hills around here.

I have a IR gun, but is hard to get the windings temperature since the opening is too small, and the difference between then and the outer parts can be really big since you have just an air gap to conduct the heat

One thing that could help is thermal paste between the motor and the mount, not expecting much any degree cooler can help

Roda again after lunch, no luck, still reached 95°C at the top of a not so long hill so I stopped before going down and upped to 150°C and if I cook it so be it

Next plan is lower the current to 25 A on each motor, but I guess the problem will continue since the average current is low, I have to open the logs on PC to see the mean of the hill climb only

Another test in combating heat, another fail

Motor current lowered to 25A each, brake still at -30A since always, temp limit still at 150°C

I took a few heavy and long hills to test and reached 90°C, but hill climbing took a hit

If I start fast it can climb, but start from dead stop is really bad, I guess due to these motors having a really low efficiency at low rpm, when you go to middle to high rpm’s it take off

Consumption @ 10,92 Wh/km

Next step is to increase the current again and see how hot it gets without the limit

Forgot to update, left the heating problem to sort itself out, after some sketches I can fit 6355 if the 5055’s go bad

First ride on the dirt, they handled it great for street wheels, even on damp and mildly slippery parts I had no wheel spin

On loose sand up to a finger deep the motors have enough torque to plow through, more than that the board stalls, more torque could help but then the wheels will probably start to spin

On the ride only one time the board stopped due to that

I want to ride this path NOW, man the colour of the smooth dirt is awesome, in europe dirt looks different.

Just from my own experience, I also had problems with a motor reaching 80°C within 3-4 minutes on flat ground. The motor was sooo hot I couldn't touch it at all, good for fried eggs on the way. I guess it was an internal short.

Will get some video of the nicer places, you have everything in one place, then dirt here is like that everywhere, if you get rain for a few days it become impossible to ride, even with my bike or on foot there are some really mildly hills that you can’t go up, and down only on your butt lol

I will try to bring some get next time 😅, if they stay bellow 100 °C it’s fine, let’s see

And nice to get another data point on the gummies, what top and average speed do you ride?

And last a picture of all the dirt paths, apart from that there are almost unlimited sugar cane crops that I can try to ride, but I think the gummies can’t take it due to the deeper loose sand, even the 6.5” may not be able to

Well due to 130kv motors my top speed is about 37km/h which is fine because it's a city carver and I like the trucks loose, I am more floating than riding :laughing: Also the massive flex is nice for carving but nothing for speed. Usually I ride between 15-30km/h, above 30km/h it is scary.

But after finishing my build I rode it for max. 20 days until my crash in skate park. After re-building I rode it for 8km until my next crash, now it's out of order again, time to buy more protectors and fix the issues.

We are on the same them, my board is capped at 35 km/h, I find my self keeping top speed way more often since it's really stable, I could definitely uncap it and go 48 km/h

Hopefully we are not the same on crashes :grinning:

Glad  (or not) to hear that even bigger tires have problems, maybe only 4wd for these situations

Today took a ride at a lot more dirt surfaces, love the gomes each day more, loose gravel was no problem, and no signs of chunking even on pretty point rocks

The Kegels on dirt would lock and the rear end would loose, not with them, full brake in the dirt and stopped in a dime

Also I think I hit the 150°C on the motors while ridding on grass, forgot to turn metr on, will try some broader temp limit, something like starting in 80°C and ending in 140°C

Thanks, this means a lot to me 👍🏻

Sure will do, I already have 6.5” Urban Treads, but the way my pulleys are assembled is PITA to change tires and pulleys

I will order my 10S5P in a few days, and then put the pneumatic wheels on for a test, the range will be too low with the current battery

This last ride with the Gummies consumed almost all the battery in 19 km, I don’t want to imagine how much the other ones will use

https://metr.at/r/gWltj

I think I will manage to squeeze one last ride still in 2018 😁 I want to test another path to the city center, that’s the only possible during the weekends

Since you said, I’m thinking on some ways to attach the GoPro to the board in a non invasive way, I hate to ride with the selfie stick, my camera is one of the really old models and quite heavy, half an hour holding it is enough hurt the hand, the best angle that is from the back I can only maintain for a few minutes 

Any ideias are welcome, I did something with a 3D printed part for my older board but the angle wasn’t great, If possible I want it to show the rear wheel

Yeah, nice prototype ! 
Maybe just upgrade it cause it looks good to me if you want this point of view a bit back.

Maybe making the base on the board and for the camera but with a square stick (or a broom handle cut at each end with a square profile) in the middle of them. (Maybe stronger than a print with the length needed).
So 3 part :

the will be if you could adjust the angle of it with an adjustable base on the board (but it as to be strong and locked ... I see your problem ^^)

Really like the idea of making the angle adjustable

The base I would to like to be quickly removable, since I have a hole in front I probably use that with a large washer and butterfly nut on the other side

One problem is that it’s have to be rigid or at least well damped, or the footage come out all blurry 

To be honest I would prefer and Skydio R1 drone, if anyone is being generous this end of year I can pass my address in PM😁

I have an DJI Spark, but the autonomous follow me is not nearly reliable enough to low level following, if I put it above every obstacle and tell to follow me almost overhead it works great (until a tree blocks me for a few seconds and it looses track)

Now it’s the last ride

First, happy new year to everyone 

Now, a few things, these 5055 motors have to go, today was the first day I took it outside my neighborhood and into the city center, in 100m of a hill it overheats and stall, and even after letting it cool a bit I had no brakes since it overheated again, almost went right through traffic, shame o lost @torqueboards Christmas sale, 6355 for 60 was a steal

Now to some vodoo, I have set the cutoff in vesc tool to start at 140°C and end at 150°C, but if you look at the metr logs they are cutting at 95°C

Also since I had nothing better to do I transformed it in a range test, and keep going around until the board barely moved, 31.7 km, on the last board with the same it lasted 44 km, but the riding conditions were nowhere near the same

Log for this build:

https://metr.at/r/oIPfj

Log for the previous build:

https://metr.at/r/GRJoI


And last, the Gummies allow me to leave my neighborhood in the weekends, as I said somewhere there are 3 main paths, a highway that’s not safe to ride, through a college campus, that’s the best route but closed on weekends and holidays and the one I took today that the road in really bad and has at least 100m of bad cobblestone, but now it’s doable 👍🏻

Damn I thought you were using 6355's to begin with, it's a huge step up from 5055's. I previously used dual 5055's and bought flipsky 6354's which do the trick even on 97-110mm flywheels wheels. Now I have my hummie deck and unity in, it's actually the best things that ever happened to my build. 35km/h seems pretty low in my opinion, then again I mostly do long stretches of street at 50km/h. 

You should push your limits, live a little and grab some better motors. I did 35% incline and my dual set up (6354's) weren't even close to warm in coolish weather. Keep up the good work and happy new year :) hope to see it progress!!

Edit: The torque these babies kick are the best, was killing the 35% incline at 45km/h :) (10s5p Samsung 30Q's just fyi)

Unfortunately no, in the previous build, with the motors mounted inward it wouldn’t fit 6355

Let’s see what I do, already put too much money in it so far, but I think with the 10S5P will be even worse since it will pump even more current to the motors

35 km/h is fine for me, but the board can go higher, it’s  dead stable at this speed

Another day, another crack in the enclosure, using the black ABS together with a too thick ABS slurry definitely made the joints between pieces way weaker than my previous enclosure. The first was printed with natural ABS and glued with a thinner mixture, I tested before going forward with the enclosure design and you would break the part before breaking the joint

I would do what @riako says, print some kind of (plugs)* for the bolt holes, wrap them in plastic so that the epoxy does not bond to them. That plus a simple clothe-vacuum bag should give you decent draping. Glassfiber is usually quite cheap too.

*(after curing dremel/cut the plugs off, easy if you use just 1/2 layers of fabric)

The person that made standard that the bell should be fixed to the axle using flat spots deserves to suffer the eternal torment of Skatan in the deepest depths of hell

Was in the middle of the woods with no tools or phone, a storm on the way and one motor starts to spin on the axle, the damn screws got loose again, this time its was the thread that was destroyed, worse is that the shaft started to go out and miss-align the belt and touch the pulley cover

Luckily i was able to pull the bell off and push the way home, I don't know what would happen to the VESC in I applied throttle without the magnets on the motors

The 6355's are on the way from torqueboards, if I run again in that kind of issue I will take everything apart and modify it to have a key between the shaft and the bell

For the 5055, I have some future plans for them and may do the key thing on at least do what I did in a old 6355, enlarge the holes to fit m4 screws

Yes, this (m4), plus loctite should be good, plus try to change the screw to pass from (I don't remember but) 1.5 or 2mm tool with a grub screw, to 3mm tool with a head screw, you could apply a lot more force.

the key way for the bell sound super strong !

Finally did the range test, 35.5 km

My last board with the same config except wheel and deck did 44.4 km, but keep in mind the battery was new, this one 9 Wh/km, the old 7,41 Wh/km

Both limited to 25 km/h, today was little windy so that could have influenced a bit

I want do do a lot of tests to see what happens, mainly compare the 5055 motors with the new 6355, we see a lot of discussion here but I don't remember  anyone doing it scientifically'ish, same route, limited to same top speed, full throttle as much as possible and same current settings

Also I will probably put the kegels on this build for a run

And all tests will be done at two limited speeds of 25 km/h and 35 km/h to see how a higher power influence

I have a feeling that in my case the 6355 may be more efficient due to more cooper, I will do the math latter, but keeping 2 400g motors at an average of 70°C for a 95 minutes is not an insignificant amount of energy, if the new ones manage to run way closer to ambiente temperature it may improve things

New motors are in

Way better design and construction than the ones a bought 3 years ago

-rubber sealed outer bearing, hopefully the others are too
-10mm axle stepped to 8mm
-stator closer to the end of the can, less space wasted
-wire exits hole properly sized, the older design was all crammed and the wires would hub on the bell
-can holes way smaller, my old one I had to cover them with duct tape to avoid rocks getting in all the time
-can is now held with screws 

Overall really solid construction, the looks are also way better than the old version

I can flip, but it wouldn't look great, the baseplate have  a inner hole, but them the hanger touches the bolt, either way I will need to make the nut countersunk into the deck, I'm kind afraid of that, but since I will still keep the two carbon fiber layers it should hold

 That's the good side of adjustable mounts, but I don't give up the rigidity and simplicity of the fixed ones

This is what I did so far

Also opened my motors to add another temperature sensor since apparently they are wired in a way that can't work with any VESC, go figure

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/torqueboards-motor-temp-sensor-not-compatible-with-vesc/82270?u=pedrodemio

A few more comments on them:

* Inner bearings are also rubber sealed
* There is a lot of oil at the bottom of the bell, perfect for building up goo inside, don't know why, shouldn't be from the bearings due to the seal
* this one I really don't like, the windings are not coated in resin, only the top portion where the sensor PCB resides

One motor sleeved and installed, waiting for more sleeve to arrive

A thing I didn't like about this motor is that the circlip is flush with the surface, meaning you have to grind your mount a little bit or it will scrap and make annoying sounds, also the groove for it is too small diameter and it stays loose rattling, a few drops of retaining fluid fixed the issue

@Pedrodemio it's a little offtopic but do you happen to know how to rewind the Racerstar motors (you did use them at some point didn't you)? I have the 200kv version and would like to rewind them to a lower kv because of the larger diameter with pneumatics.

I used the torqueboards 5055

I’ve never done it myself, but the easiest way would be to change the winding termination from delta to wye, the Kv will lower by a factor of 1.73, there is a few guides on RC forums, and there you will also find a lot of info about rewinding, there are a few a spreadsheets around that will give you how many turns to do to arrive in your desired Kv if you manage to unwind and count the current turns

Cheers and good luck, it is a lot of work

What had me scratching my head in the end is that the motors had the logo mirrored, but I had installed in such a way that it would be upside down, them the next time I looked they were installed correct, well, they have two logos on the can, one in each way 😶

About to go to the first test, just charging up a bit, but things look promising, the old motors had 38 miliohms of resistance, the new ones is 18 miliohms, only there I should have 4 times less heating, apart to the fact that is 35 °C ambient it should keep cool

@mishrasubhransu yep, the same, both 190Kv

@Bataleon with the old motors 11.5Wh/km, will test with the new ones

@mutantbass as soon as I install the new battery will try them

________________

Ok, just wow, it’s a new board, definitely the 5055 motors were saturating badly even in low currents

I didn’t change anything, just did the detection, same current, it’s way stronger across all speeds

Heat wise it’s looking good, as said it’s was 35°C here. Riding in tall grass without going over 60°C for as long as I want, with the old ones 100m it would reach 95°C and cut all power

Overall the board inspire way more confidence, the only problem is that now I’m experiencing the wheel lock at low speeds, probably will try @Deodand fix

Consumption is 11.5 Wh/km, but this was riding really hard, with grass and all, só riding normally I think will be better

As @Linny said, MR60 are 3 pins in line and MT60 in a triangle, I really like them, way better than bullets, only reason I didn't use them here is lack of space to route the cables inside the deck and also I couldn't find any good ones for the sensor

That's brings to a point I've been thinking, I have no idea how do waterproof the motor wires in this building, even if I completely surround them with silicone there is no guarantee it would be good

The precious build using MT60 embedded into the deck, there was no gap in the enclosure, the buttons were water proof so was the switch, the way it is the only way water can enter is through the phase and sensor wire holes, I know that since I've been ridding on fine dirt a lot, and  the only place dirty has made the way inside is in these holes

Any suggestions are welcome

One way would be to make a pod that houses two MT60 connectors and some other for the sensors

Fuses and wiring for the new battery, will be joining the P groups with double 1.5 mm² wire, approximately  12 AWG, should be enough, even more since I doubt the 80A peak will last more than a few seconds

Yesterday finally took it to the places I was having problem with overheating and loosing brakes, no problems anymore, I don’t know what will happens once I increase the current limits 

71°C peak and only for a second, maybe it’s just noise, the average is 60°C with 25°C ambiente temperature

An interesting thing is that once stopped the temperature rises and then starts to fall down due to the sensor being exposed to ambient air and the core being hotter than the surface, in my future direct drive I will see if I find a way to put the sensor deep into the windings

Another problem is that maybe I’m having connection drops, not sure if it’s that or the poor implementation of ramping of the VESC’s that gives this impression, probably will set all ramping to zero and see what happens, unfortunately if it’s a radio problem it can end badly with ramping disable

Longest ride so far, I’m in love with this board even more, I departed 10AM and came back 4:40PM, of that, around 4 hours was on top of the board riding, charged 4 times wherever I could between some snacks and drinks

The most important, 52 km, and my legs are in great shape, could keep riding more with no problem

The consumption is really low riding slower and with lots of stops and go, at 7.1 Wh/km, I could make this ride without charging, but with sag I think I would not be able to climb some hills



The records are split in 3 since I reached the maximum size in Metr, and a little bit is lost due to it stopping

She got wet for the first time, I have to say the Gummies are impressive in the wet, I barely noticed any less grip, neither full acceleration or full brake make the lock and slide, handle exactly like it's dry. With the Kegels if you even thought of braking they would loose traction

The downside of this deck/wheels is that it throws all the water and crap on you, both shoes completely soaked, and it wasn't even raining

Won't do this again until I seal everything properly

A few mods from the original, included two bearings on the wheel to a smoother action and made a little on off button since I’m not a fan of the sliding switch sticking out of the bottom

Unfortunately time for a few repairs, the enclosure has cracked is multiple locations, I’ve been riding a lot off road and it’s been being hot by rocks all the time

Also there is a bit of humidity inside, I can’t say if it’s really water or the silicone is outgassing, on the motor wires entrance it’s probably water

I will probably get and enclosure from @bigben and mod it with a few 3D printed parts on the back, will go back to using connectors for the motor and sensor wires, it’s the only way to be true waterproof

The 105P will probably have to wait until all that is sorted

In the meantime I’m working on a ebike using some parts I have laying around since there are some places that it would be better

Change of plans

After inspecting more carefully, the enclosure is done, superglue in the cracks should make it last a bit more. Ordered onde with @bigben

The plan is to make a 3D printed piece that holds MT60 connectors for the motors plus the one on the picture for sensors, plus I'm ditching my Vedder anti spark and going to XT90S, less headache than trying to find one that can cope with the 100A peak of the 10S5P, and I think I will integrate in this piece the charge connector and the battery level LED's, this way there is no wire connecting the enclosure to the board and it will be fully waterproof

I think you are right, if I've done like the initial plan of using rubber washers it may have allowed enough movement to avoid cracks, it didn't even crossed my mind that it the flex that made it crack

After melting a ton of charge ports I gave up and epoxied a XT60 in its place, now I can melt the battery before the plug 😁

I lost the waterproof ness, but since I have more cracks than I can count on the enclosure nothing changed

I did a big mistake

![image|666x500](upload://uykYEeZZDzw1E4mjJo6Ae84SZT9.jpeg) 

Now I don’t want to go back to the Gummies. The riding feel of being closed to the ground is much better, I need to ride more, but I’m starting to think that the bigger difference in comfort of this board is due to the Hummie deck, not the wheels

Of course, they Gummies can deal with much bigger cracks and holes without getting unsafe when in traffic

Motor clearance is non existent 

![image|666x500](upload://xQYTRZeoY28p70PO71SY1kz2RSJ.jpeg)

I’ve said this before, but either I need a mountain board with crazy range or I need to move, the ridings options around here are limited, there isn’t great places to ride, and the few that are good I already know them really well, o MTB would open a lot of places to go, but I would need something like 100km of range to be worth

Rode 30 km today in a variety of roads

It's really hard to express how they compare, but I will try

The main explanation I can give is the diference between micro and macro dampening, think micro dampening how the wheel can damp point loads, like really small rocks and roda imperfections, and macro dampening how the wheel as a whole can cope with larger cracks, bad roads, big rock,etc

On smooth to okay roads the Kegels win by a mile, the board is more agile and responds quicker, that what 1 kg lighter does and most important, less rotational inertia, I may do the calculations latter to see how much diference there is the moment of inertia of both wheels and how do they compare on with the inertia of the board plus me

Second, I really need new pulleys for the Gummies, the Kegels pulleys are almost new, and the board is ridiculously quiet, even at full acceleration, a pleasure to ride, it almost feels like you are floating

The down side comes when big rocks and larger gaps in the road start to show, they can lock the wheels, get between the motor and the road and brake the board, but this is more a problem of how my board is designed, not the wheels

On really bad roads the Gummies shine, there is some places I have to go slower than walking with Kegels, before I could go at least twice or more the speed

Consumption is a little bit better, from 12 Wh/km to 9.5 Wh/km, I'm almost sure it's due to I'm not being as confidente riding the smaller wheels and the energy it takes to accelerate the Gummies, plus the bigger contact surface to the ground

In other words, the Gummies are great for those who don't want to go pneumatics, but how I wish the roads were a little bit better so I could stay with Kegels

Hey @Pedrodemio, what are your thoughts on the feasibility of 3d printed enclosures? It seems that all 3d printed enclosures break earlier than what you would hope for. Do you think it's a matter of designing them properly, using the correct materials or are they just not strong enough?

I usually have hard boxes inside for batteries and ESC, so this TPU will like a tough skin for small rocks, dirt, water etc. It will also conform nicely to the curvature of the board.

It's possible with no problems, mine failed for a few reasons 

* Infill too low, should've used 100%
* Natural ABS has better layer bonding, this black one I've used is a mess to glue with MEK, and not so good layer adhesion
* The aluminum washer caused a lot of stress concentration on the screws seats, making them larger and using a rubber washer would have helped
* wall too thin, they are all 2.4mm if I'm nos mistaken, at least 3 is good, on the side I could have easily done thicker without changing the design

If you want the enclosure to be used a somewhat flex board you can't use a rigid material or you will have even bigger problems, this was one of the reasons for the thin walls

Why not use nylon? It's lightly flexible, has crazy good layer adhesion (whenever nylon breaks for me it just splits across the whole part, no mind to any layers), nylon can really take a good beating before giving up. I made my boost converter mount out of nylon and that thing's four legs (1cm diameter each) have been holding the entire weight of a 6S2P battery + boost converter/heat sink for almost a year under constant vibration (I didn't design the mount the best I could have to handle vibrations) and it's only now starting to show signs of failing on one of the legs. I super glued it in that tiny corner and it's still going strong. I've tried ABS, PETG, but I always come back to nylon because I know all my PETG will fail where I would otherwise use Nylon.

Thanks for the tip, I always heard that it’s difficult to print, what printer do you have and what nozzle temperature do you use?

I will see if I can find some locally to give a try



Board almost done, just fully charging and testing if the cells stays balanced, so far so good.

Unfortunately on my tinkering with my charger I messed it up a bit, it overheats and shut down after a few minutes so I have to slowly raise the voltage to prevent it from going full current, also if I set it to 42V it immediately shuts down 

It’s a shame, I haven’t found another that is cheap and have adjustable voltage, it worked really good all these years

@PXSS another group buy maybe? 😉

I have the [PowerSpec Duplicator I3 Plus](https://www.microcenter.com/product/486543/powerspec-wanhao-duplicator-i3-plus-3d-printer) with an all metal hot end. With Nylon I normally print at 250C with the bed at 105-110C. 

All the ABS I have had i've basically never used much because of the difficulty to print with. Nylon parts on glass stick pretty well with a few layers of glue stick and the printer fully enclosed. They do break loose and warp sometimes, just need to learn how to minimize it. 

If you have an enclosure and all metal hot end, give it a try for yourself. Tulman nylon is pretty expensive, so I just get the cheap shit, but they have stuff that's optimized for all sorts of different applications, be it printability, durability, flexibility, you name it.

Unfortunately I don’t have an all metal hot end, the hottest I ever printed is 245°C

My experience is the contrary, ABS is pics of cake for me to print, always was

I may try it, the worst that can happen is the Teflon tube melting and a mess to clean up. I have an enclosure but it doesn’t get that hot since it’s a bit bigger than the printer, but does wonder to the print quality

My printer is pretty bad, it’s a i3 Mk1 or mk2 clone with an acrilic frame that warps like hell, I want to upgradr but can’t justfy at the moment, probably a i3 MK3 or design one from scratch using the electronics I already have

Don't. When teflon breaks down it produces fumes that are apparently very very toxic. Just get a all metal hotend from aliexpress for <$10. You just have to print slowly because retractions can't be that big(they clog otherwise). 

But if you are willing to invest [$40](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/3d-printing-discussions/91908/15?u=mishrasubhransu) or so you can get pretty good all metal direct drive extruders. Small retractions are all that you need with them by default.

Good to know before I kill my self 

For now I will stick to ABS then 

Or try nylon at 245°C

Yeah, alloy 910 will work well at 245, but make sure you have a dry box/desiccator.

Even better, try TPU. They won't crack or tear and level of protection from small rocks is pretty good too. Big rocks hitting or belly scraping is a problem.

Perfect, let me see if I can find it here

I always keep a dry box inside the enclosure to keep the filaments dry

First ride with new battery, can’t say much since the current settings are the same until l switch to the XT90S, but the sag is way lower at full current

A huge thanks to @Arch for the tip of dampening the rattle, I used a thick cloth piece that covers all the electronics, all the noise went away, just the bushings squeak a bit, will lube them 

My 70km ride was cut way short due to my remote disconnecting every few minutes and only working again by resetting the board. Too dangerous to ride

But Today was Electric Mobility day here in São Paulo, really cool, lots of nice people and great to see at least some places pushing for eletrefication here in Brazil

We had a a ride with only electric and hybrid vehicles. Bikes, scooters, monocycles, cars, buses, motorcycles and etc, and finally I made my dream of seeing a Tesla in real life come true 😀😀😀, even if it was an old 70D, next one is to actually drive one

how to the gummies ride compared to pneumatics?

I'm planning an AT build list and i'm unsure of whether to go with gummies or pneumatics.

weary about pneumatics due to flats

thanks! :)

With the 7" evolve tires I never had flats because they are thick and durable. With standard MTB tires I get easily several punctures each tube. But green slime solves this issue.

@Pedrodemio doesn't know it yet but he is a big fan of pneumatics
