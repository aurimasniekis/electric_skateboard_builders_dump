Not 100% done, but I did the first tests today, and I'm satisfied with the results so far. Tests showed drastically decrease heat in 4wd steel (131 F on the back 90 kv, and 97 F on the front 80 kv) vs 2wd steel (210 F) and 2wd aluminum (243 F). Torque is insane. I almost feel on my butt a few times in my first test. Took a bit of riding to get used to before I could get the hang of it. Once I did, I tested it the acceleration from 0-20 mph and recorded 2.8 seconds. I went up a relatively normally steep hill for San Francisco at 21 mph constant. Top speed seems to be about 24 mph though, which was a bit disappointing to me. Bumping the battery up to a 12s would give me at least another 5 mph though. But I'm out of space for any more cells for now, so 10s it is for now.

Here's a basic run down again on the parts used:

- 4x chaka vescs (now a custom made quad vesc from chaka)
- 4x hummie's hubs (front is 80 kv, back is 90 kv) (now with ceramic bearings)
- Custom built 10s4p li-ion battery pack made of LG HE2 18650's (now at 12s4p)
- Custom deck, CNC milled one sheet at a time, and pressed 4 layers at a time in roar rocket vacuum bag
- Custom battery display (now showing individual cell voltages instead of a combinations of cells)
- No BMS!!


Now, on to the fun stuff...

The board is 100% constructed from 1/16th inch Canadian maple veneers, imported from Canada. With a few layers of polycrylic, you can really see thee beauty of the wood with a bit of a shine.

I decided against going with a bms. This is mainly due to space issues, but from the tests I have done, cells don't unbalance themselves very much per discharge cycle. I limit the battery to 32 volts, which means if they are all balanced, they will still have .4 of a volt left in them. This gives me some play room for when they do come unbalanced. From my tests, it seems they will need balancing every few charge cycles. But to keep an eye on whats going on, I have a meter between each cell and the negative terminal. Due to the sytle of these particular screens needed a seperate power source (I use the receiver), the negative of all need to be connected, and would short circuit if I connect them using the positive of the last screens as my next screens negative. Still you can see what's going on pretty quickly.

Now, the insides feature 2 large pockets, with a ribbed structure. This provides ample support, while providing a lot of space. The 18650 cells are soldered together using 8 AWG wire. I do not solder the wire in between the cells. This allows the pack to have an insane amount of flex. I could bend the entire pack to a 90 degree angle, maybe more even. So the aggressive curves of this deck are no issue with the battery. There's a 7s4p in the one side and a 3s4p on the side with the vescs. Together, they create a 10s4p. I accidentally started carving out the wrong side for the motor wires, which you can see in the last photo.

Overall, the goal was to create a beast board that can tackle the relentless hills in San Francisco with speed and no over heating, and get me to school (5 miles each way) and back every day. The vescs are set to pull 18 amps max per motor, this totals 72 amps max across the board. The cells are rate to 20 amps each, and with 4p, 80 amps max con. I can't imagine the power it would have with 12s.  I simply don't have the space and is why I stuck to 10s.

_**STILL TO DO:**_

I need to hook up the power switch.  My circuit board for the switch failed. Been waiting on Dexter to ship it out, hopefully it will be arriving in the next few days.

The lid also is not perfect. The vacuum bag's seal broke after a few hours, and did not get the full 24 press. This is easy to fix, just make a new lid. But I have yet to to that.

**_FINAL NOTES:_**

Thanks for checking my board out. I am talking to some board manufactures and hope to have a profession board company make these decks for me. My goal is to produce these boards for production. This is likely at least a year away still, as I need to do way more testing, and finalize all parts used in the board. They will be sold as 4wd or dual drive options. Single motor with these motors get too hot. 2wd is good for flat and not extremely long rides and/or lighter rides. With me being about 200 lb, I need 4wd to get ride of heat issues in the motors.

Thanks guys.
 A few others points I fogot to mention.

The boards with everything together weighs 22.8 pounds.

It's composed of 18 layers (16 layers is 1 inch thick), with a 3 layer lid. So just over an inch in thickness. You can really get much thinner than that with vescs and 18650s.

It's also about 40 inches long by 8.25 inches wide.

I had the idea of a deck constructed like this over a year ago. It took a long of time before I could figure out how to make a board like this. As far as I know, there's never been an electric skateboard deck constructed from individually cnc milled veneers, and pressed with concave. Chaka's is the closest, his deck is interesting. Theres some big defferences though. My deck is a recessed drop through (kinda like the evolve gt), and it has pretty steep concave. Chakas on the other hand has a much larger battery. His deck is also 2wd while mine is 4wd. His is a bit more polished than mine (I'm a bit lazy about every little detail and just want to ride already, haha) And he uses carbon fiber, while I keep 100% wood. They are both great decks IMO, and would love to see these kinds of decks on the market.

I'm impressed it's only 22.x lbs!  That's a slick setup and definitely well thought-out and executed!  

I've wanted to do similar and am still practicing CF before i tackle my v2 e-GBomb w/ enclosed electronics.  I'm working on a Omen Chief now which is a double thick deck for bottom sunk electronics.  Moving slowly as i learn/practice w/ CF:

The bottom is carved/routed out - reinforced the top w/ some 12k CF.  

Hats off to making the deck yourself w/ the Roar kit!  That's a lot of work and well done man!

Thanks man. I'm interested to see how your deck comes out. The idea of a bottom recess I think is interesting. I defiantly lose a slight bit of concave doing the top recessed (look at the curves on the bottom, and look at the curves on the top with the lid on and you'll notice a slight difference). In my experience, carbon fiber is unnecessary. My deck is plenty strong, and has just a little bit of flex, which if anything, helps absorb vibrations.

As @michaeld33, you get offsetting. I would prefer to cut them all at once. But it is difficult to even cut a veneer with a CNC machine, they are very fragile, and you must use very precise settings. I know if I used better equipment, I could cut them in one swoop, and the day that happens, production for this board begins. I think finding a board company who have better tools could produce them faster. Just cutting the deck took 20 hours of cncing. Then, sanding took 5-8 hours. If I had better tools, I could cut sanding down to an hour and cncing down to 3-4 hours. That's when I can produce this deck. But right now, I have a lot of hurdles to get over before that can happen, most of which is money needed for tools if I choose not to or can't find a company to produce the decks for me.

The biggest issue is how a veneer is usually some what warped. You have to really clamped them down. Here's a picture of what I'm doing and the warpness some sheets have.

The veneers often fall apart during cutting. Even with optimal settings, I wasted almost 50 sheets, and got 20 good ones... Most of those were testing settings to come up with the right ones, but I will still lose 1 out of every 6 or so to random cracking due to a knot or just weak spot in that particular sheet.

Basically, the cutting before is way more difficult that cutting after. But cutting after requires me to make a mold, not use a nicely concaved downhill deck. It's also hard because I'm limited to less than 3 inches of cutting height. The ends of the board stick up more than 3 inches due to its sharp concave. Many professional cnc milling machines don't have these kinds of limitations. I just don't have 15k laying around to drop on one.

I have been thinking about getting a thick piece of wood/ ply and just cutting the  board from that piece using a band saw(&other tools), including the space for battery and VESC. What's wrong with that approach if flexibility if not what I am after? Or I could ask why is a pressed veneers construction superior to just using a ply board/ wood slab obtained from hardware shop?

So I started originally with this idea. I made my first board from a bed board at home depot. The issue is, how do you bend a solid thick board? you can't. So you look at plywood. Flexy Plywood has little strength. It doesn't hold up to weight, it just craxks and breaks. I had my second board, which was slightly l had different than my first board, break in half on me while riding. It was made of pine, which is rigid, but it still broke after a few rides. So I decided I needed harder wood (pun INTENDED). Maple is what most skateboard decks are made of, so it seems like a no brainier. But how can you make a board bend and keep that shape? The only way to do that with wood is by using super thin sheets (veneers) and gluing them together while being pressed into a shape. The glue holds the sheets in the shape they where pressed in using tension forces.

Using plywood wood is just starting with a bad material. It's hard enough to do with the right materials, and maple veneers pressed in a hydrolic press would be ideal. But a poor mans choice is the vacuum bag press.

You want a slight bit of flex, but a slight bit is maybe 1/10th of an inch down when stood on. plywood flexs much further.

Thick pieces will give you no concave, which feels unstable, especially at higher speeds.

Maybe, the more times you cries-cross, the more strength the board has. ou do a normal gain, cross grain, normal grain, cross grain, ect.. That, along with the glue, is why the board stays in its shape and has so much strgth. You'd be amazed at how few sheets it takes to have really good strength.

Not these ones because they require a separate power source (they have 3 wires, power source +, power source - and measuring -, measuring +). Unless I use 10 separate power sources (one for each screen), I need to link all the negatives together. Since the negative must go to the power source and each cell, I would be shorting the balance connector which I connect them to. So I'm looking at a 2 wire on instead. I originally pictured that in my mind @barajabali. It's more so there for testing purposes right now anyways, as I'm trying to see how unbalanced they come from riding, and so far, not more than .3 a volt difference in 1 pack, not more than .1 a volt in the rest. But In due time, I will replace them with ones that say...

This build is amazing! Super impressed by everything here and cant wait to see more! One thing I wanted to mention was you said that the board drew 72A max across the board though I was wondering what your actual current is going full speed? If you where actually drawing 72A and you had, lets say, a 10Ah pack, you would kill your battery in 8 Min and 20 Seconds so I know thats not the case lol.

It is a 10 Ah battery btw, and no, I haven't yet. It's hard to know exactly what I'm pulling. On duals of the 90 kvs, I rode with my laptop connected, bldc connect, and recording the screen so I could go back and see what I pulled. On flat, the highest I pulled was 17 per motor, so 34 total. On a fairly steep hill, I hit my limit of 25 per motor (50 total). I suspect I hit that limit when climbing some steep hills still. But on flats and slight inclines, I'm sure I never get close. I do need to test it at some point, though its hard since I would have to ride without a lid, which means standing on my vescs and battery, which is not ideal. This is why having a way to have the vesc record and save this kind of data would be great, but no ones created something publicly available yet, so I'm in thew dark.

Watt meters I've found to be extremely inaccurate. On the same ride, the watt meter said I pulled 12 amps while the vesc said I was pulling 25-27 amps. I trust the vesc more, and the vesc numbers made more sense, cause there was a huge difference in climbing ability if I reduced to 40 amps, which according to my watt meter, I never got close to.

Now this was a different board, same vescs, same motors, same battery minus 1 extra p I added, and dual instead of quad.

But moral of the story, I believe I pull 72 on steep hills, but most of the time, I probably don't pull more than 50 total. But it would be nice to do some tests soon and see.

Thanks, it's a lot of work pressing the sheets, especially getting the air out of the bag. Check you seal consistently. I had it break a few times, the worst being the lid as I stayed for 2 hours, left, came back 8 hours later and found the seal failed. It does happen, and if you catch it, press the seal again a few times, and it'll only take a few pumps to get back to good pressure. It doesn't completely fail, but you'll notice that black mesh is just a bit lose. That was the first sign I picked up on, then around the edges was a little loose. Again, it was so minor, that it could be fixed with like 5 pumps (and it takes like 600 pumps or more to press it once you seal it after gluing), so keep a close eye on it. The first 2 hours are the most important, but you want it in there for 24 hours under max pressure, or it won't be prefect.

Roar rocket actually gave me the idea with their pre-cut kits. I figured if they sell kits for pre cut boards, why can't I pre cut them with channels with my cnc milling machine and glue them, like one of their kits. And it worked great.

Just to make the deck though, I probably spent more than 200 hours total. It took 2 months of time, cutting and gluing at least 5 days a week, sometimes more. Most of that time was the steep learning curve of making such a deck, so I could make it faster again, but it will still takes me a minimum of 30 hours to make 1 deck in 1 on 1 with the board time, more when you consider it takes 5 days to glue it all the way.

The other interesting thing is I just did my first full discharge and recharge, and the cells when discharged became slightly unbalanced, but charged up, I was able to let the charger stop. packs at 42.02. The highest cell is 4.202. the lowest is 4.185. Which was what I was at before the full discharge, so a BMS in this particular discharge and charge cycle would have been completely useless, and done nothing.

NO BMS FTW!!!

Yeah thats weird that you would have so much difference between the watt meter and the VESC. You should get a trust worthy voltage meter and set it at measuring amperage and have the board just on a table where they only draw around 5A with the wheels free spinning and see which is right, the VESC or the watt meter compared to the accurate voltage meter.

I have my vescs set to slow cutoff at 33v, hard cutoff at 32v (just in case cells become unbalanced and I don't have time to balance them. In this test, I did a 4 mile run involving 9 blocks of steep uphills, 9 steep downs, most moderate ups or downs, and a few flat. I am willing to bet I could have done 6-7 miles in these harsh extremely hilly conditions at full throttle (cause that's all I ever ride at). If I did my distance tests right, I could easily milk 15-20 miles. On flats, 12+ miles. But this is why I hate max range numbers. This and they don't account for rider weight. If I take a 120 pound rider and give them a flat and downhill route, 20 miles no questions asked. Me being 200 pounds, its almost double the weight, so I would expect 10 miles. Companies never state how they come up with their range numbers, and I feel like some do just what I said to bullshit their numbers.

Also I thought you mentioned something about needing a switch for your board? I have a thread about a couple different switches I designed and I uploaded all the schematics and places to buy the components on there as well so you can build your own. I also sell them for $25-$35 if you dont feel comfortable making one yourself if your interested. [THREAD](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eboard-mosfet-switch/5738)

Yeah I could though like I said it would be overkill and I think my 60A dual 7530 version would be completely suitable because of its peak at 760A. I could do an 80A version with two IRFB7530-7P though that would be more like $40-45 because I would have to order like 10 of them from Mouser. Though I could definitely do it.

Yeah its about as simple as they come lol. Now it isnt perfect because there is still some drain leakage though it is incredibly low and for EBoards its pretty much irrelevant. For example when the switch is plugged in and in the off state a small amount of current is let through the switch though its so low that I had my board sitting around "down for repairs" for over a month and the battery voltage never went below what it was at before, ~3..8V per cell for "storage". Anyways its very simple and works pretty damn well and ive used it for many other applications not only my EBoard but other high current applications, like my lab bench PSU that has a similar MOSFET switch using a 3034 fet instead. And if your ever interested in ordering in small bulk like 10-20 contact me and ill see if I could do it, though no guarantees, remember im just a single person compared to other groups like Enertion, DIY, etc. Also if you were ever planning on selling your boards like making the 20 of them like you stated I would highly recommend that you use a BMS just for ease of use to consumers, maybe talk to @longhairedboy  and see what he has to say about it cause he is always using BMS's.

So you were saying you were riding with laptop connected to the board and re cording your screen to measure the results right? Does the VESC interface over USB or what port do you use to get readings off of it. I was thinking you could have some sort of Arduino connected to it 're cording the information an SD card so you can look at it later on. I might actually look into some thing like this in the future though I would have to know a lot more about the VESC in the first place.

I rode my last build, which was my back 2 motors and vescs, and same battery minus 1 p (so 10s3p, same cells), with my laptop running the bldc program recording the screen of the active sampling. Its sketchy to say the least, because I have to keep a cable connected via the usb port on the vesc. I have to keep it in one hand while I control the board with the other, and i'm 6' 1", and the cables like, 3 feet long. So not something II look forward to doing again, but I need to get a look at whats happening.

I want to write code for the vesc, but I wish vedder documented his code better. There's not a lot of info of whats where, how he decided to split different things up, even what these variables mean, as looking through the code, he named some variables likes like gstd (don't know if that's a real variable name, but my point is some are just abbreviations I simply don't know). I need to spend a lot of time and ask vedder a lot of questions before I can try to write anything. It'll help to learn actual C this semester too, I know objective-c and c++.

That's not very much IMO. It's easy to balance up with a regulated power supply. And it doesn't matter too much since I have more range than I need. I think 4.2 and 4.12 is a fair amount, 4.2 and 4.0 is way too much. But .05 even is not very much in my mind.

What would be your ideal top speed?

I'm thinking of making different configurations that would suit better to different riders.


UPDATE:
I have been working on finding better techniques to make boards, and believe I have found a solution to my problems. I'm in the process of designing a press so I can reduce the gluing to one session, one 24 hour dry time. the outside shape is easier to cut out with a band saw. And the battery compartment can be cnc milled, after gluing and drying. This would allow me to make multiple boards in one week, instead of 1 board every week and a half. I just need to find the time to build the press.

Update: up to around 150 miles, probably more on the board. A few issues to note so far:

Back 2 bearings can still get to 226 F if I ride for more than 6 miles without stopping. This is too hot for the bearings, and thus the back bearings are starting to dry out of oil. They are only rated to 210 F while every thing else is rated to 300 F. So i need higher heat bearings and high heat oil. I also am thinking of rewinding the back motors to 80 kv to match the front and in hopes of fitting more copper on the stator.

I also have some slight delimitation on the last layer of the board on the nose and tail. Not a big deal and easy to fix. And it's from not being careful when I sit the board up and dragging it. Everything else looks good. My next board, I will round the edges which should solve this.

Update again:

So I figured out if the vescs are compacted enough, I can fit can upgrade to 12s4p. So I'm having chaka make his special quad vesc design. This will mean my max speed should be about 30 mph, and acceleration will become insanely fast, as I will run 72 amps at 12s instead of 72 amps at 10s (@Jinra, we will have to race again we I'm done with these upgrades). I will also have more range, as I will be up to 500 Wh.

What settings are you looking for. For the FOC mode settings, you need to based on your motors, as everyone has a slightly different motor. Some are 90 kv, some are 80 kv, and even a motor rated at 90 kv for example could be + or - a few kv (like 93 kv or 87 kv).

In terms of general settings, it depends on what battery your using (max amps you can pull, 12s vs 10s). At 10s, you want up to 50 amps on the battery side for these motors. I run the motor amps at 80 regardless. To set your battery cutoffs, use this chart:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fb95302d91aa992329d1d0ccb21f626ae71fc139.png

for regen, I think 12 amps is good between the motors, so if dual, 6 amp per motor. I use 3 amps per motor since I have quad. Everything else, I have left the same as default. The remote you have calibrate, since we're using a mix of remotes (right now, I'm messing with the mini trigger. Was using the steez before)

It's been a while since I did any updates, and a lot has changed. so heres an update:

- I cooked the lubricant out of my bearings (even with 4wd, I still hit 250 F+)
- As a result, I decided high heat ceramics would be a better option. But we needed tools to crack the motors off and I had to wait over a month for ceramic bearings to arrive.
- I decided I was done with 10s, and I wanted 12s. I ordered a few more cells, and now I'm up to a 504 Wh 12s4p.
- I decided to go back to the carvon v2's in a dual drive.
- The carvon v2's were good and bad. The overheated the vescs very quickly, but I was able to do 38 mph officially, and I believe I hit speeds of 40 mph+ at times when I wasn't recording data. This deck handles high speeds like a champ, not even a bit of speed wobble at 38 mph.
- But I had to take many breaks to cool down the vescs with the v2 carvons, so they were not practical. I have since decided I will make another deck with a 4wd carvon v2's. Details on that will go into a new build thread when I'm closer to finishing that board.
- @hummie and I were finally able to crack the entire motor apart to replace with ceramics. While I waited for the tools, I order a special request quad vesc from @chaka. This was necessary, as I could not fit 4 vescs with caps with a 12s4p battery. Since I already upgraded the battery, this had to be done to reduce foot print.
- We replaced the bearings with ceramics two weeks ago, and I got my quad vesc this past weekend.
- I also replaced my battery screens with individual cell readings. So no more math, just look and see how the cells are doing. As you'll notice in my picture below, the 2nd p needs balancing, the rest are pretty good. To balance, I simply take off the lid, and unplug the balance cables that go to the balancing port on the screens on the lid. I charge through the balance cable the p that needs balancing with a regulated power supply.

With out further a due:

It was a 2 man job for sure. It required a 2 pin spanner, an arbor press, 2 people with a lot of force, and I even CNC milled a tool out of steel to get the little bearing off. It was a lot of work the first time, but it's easier now that we've done it. That high heat expoxy is way stronger than needed. Red locktight from here on out.

Quite a voyage! I hope the board is presently working great. Do you still have Hummie Hubs in this build? I'm about to start on a small build with FOC, Torqueboards VESCs, 12s1p, and Hummie Steel Hubs, but your experiences here have me worried about heat. I actually thought the steel hubs fixed this problem. 

Do you think I'd also run into heat issues at 200-ish lbs? Or maybe have any advice on ways to mitigate it? For example, if I could limit the board to 15% grade or 15MPH, that'd be fine. I just don't want it melting my bearings.

Everything's working great. Only issue I've had since the new car tire rubber has been bearings. I would just watch how your riding. Weight has a factor for sure. Hummie weighs 50 pounds less than me and doesn't have the heating issues like I do.

I also ride very aggressive. Quick stopping, and quick accelerations always. That eats up more amps and generates more heat. I also ride with a heavy backpack, so my riding weight is closer to 220-225 lb.

I also ride long distances at mostly full throttle (5 miles). And I have lots of hills on my route. Stick to flats and riding aggressive for shorter distances or a bit less aggressive for longer distances.

OR, just go quad :P IMO, I need quad motors with these motors in order to get the performance I need with out real heating issues.

The real beasts will be his new motors. I will upgrade this board to 4wd with those sooner or later with a higher kv.

Well you need something with a lot of strength. The problem with plywood is it's inherently weak. I have tried and had some success. But at the end of the day, I figured out that it was better to press Canadian maple veneers. You get far better strength due to many cross and normal grain layers.

Not to say it can't work, check out the board I did before this one. Basically what you are saying. But the problem is then you need a 20mm solid layer on the bottom instead of 5mm. It's literally that much stronger.

It looks like your first board was made from solid wood (pine) and I'm talking about canadian maple plywood so basicly same lamination as you did just not in a bend form. There's also a unidirectional plywood but this as I understand won't be good because to gain strenght fibers should be crossed?

If the plywood is constructed of 1/16th of an inch or even 1/8th of an inch, you might be ok. I had a hard time findin such thing. I guess I should say technically, it was my third board that I made from Canadian maple plywood. It was strong on the outside layers but the inside was very fragile. That was the best maple plywood I could find.

if you can find.better stuff like what my board is made of power to you. I was not able to find any plywood pre made with the strength I got from pressin my own.

To hold the motor on? Never had any issues with red loctite failing, except on the inner ring. This is one of the reasons the new motors use a C-Clip  instead.

In terms of holding the motor on the axle, this will never fail. Too long of a threaded surface. It took a 10 foot long wrench with an abor press and tractor piece on the end meant to open tractor engines. It worked in getting it off, but it took 2 people over 30 minutes to get it off. It's so hard, that theres no way it will ever come off on its own...

All he does is create a plate that holds the 4 vescs, puts them together so the caps are on top of the vescs, creating a smaller profile, and puts a canbus cable so they are all together..

I have realized though that with higher power (5000w+), you need more caps. So I will be disassembling it soon to upgrade the caps and reassembling using a new plate I'll CNC mill myself.
