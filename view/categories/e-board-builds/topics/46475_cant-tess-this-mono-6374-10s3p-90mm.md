First time using wood inserts. It's kinda tough taking a drill to such a nice deck. I used a dab of gorilla glue when inserting. They seem strong, we'll see.

Been looking forward to testing these wheels, gotta good reputation. Will report back.

Picked up a Focbox and Nano-x on cyber Monday. I have zero experience with a Vesc. I have used the 12s 120a esc on previous builds with no complaints. I was slightly intimidated by the Vesc, but it wasn't hard at all. 
![IMG_3471|375x500](upload://k0yDTkiwJq5pYhYrKwv1NUY1PjF.JPG)

I'm using a panel mount bullet connector on the enclosure. Here's a thread on the product: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/panel-mount-bullet-connector/3294

![IMG_3582|500x500](upload://ydLYvmMYiy67qzXXA0ro7evlRM1.JPG)

I used Sugru to secure the connector from inside the enclosure. First time using Sugru, it's a really cool product. I made a toothbrush holder with the excess.

With white zealous it would have been perfect, the board is georgous the green bearing is the killing detail IMO
Great job the board is sleek af

It's the 12s esc that  sells. I think it's also branded as sleeping lion. I've seen it mostly used on mountain board builds. 
The vesc was new when I started my first build and the 12s esc was available. I didn't have any complaints with it, so I used it again on my second build. Really looking forward to testing the vesc this time.

Very nice build!

I would recommend covering these better to avoid arcing and shorting phase wires.

What risers do you use?
And why do you need a extra layer of carbon?

I still have wheelbites with 1/2" risers while using 44Â° Caliber and 90mm Flywheels.

I'm only using 1/8" shock risers, no bite yet. May bump it up to 1/4" if needed. 
The carbon vinyl is purely for aesthetics.

Those motor wires seem rather long.

I have read many mixed things about the DRV burning on vescs, on one hand people say its because of long battery wires, others say its because of long motor wires. In my opinion motor wire length should be of less importance, but I have a friend who made a board with vescs almost directly near the motors because he burned his first. No problems since

where have you heard about long phase wires causing issues?

things that can cause issues (in our application):
long battery wires
long ppm wires

things that donâ€™t cause issues (in our application)
long phase wires

the phase wires on my board are about 4ft long, iâ€™ve never had it give me a single issue. ever. many other on here use long phase wires for dual diagonal drives too. iâ€™m 99% chakas mass produced board uses split ppm and long phase wires, lemme check real quick

what are ppm wires? the ones that run from the receiver to arduino or what?

ppm wires are the wires that go from the vesc to receiver to transmit ppm signal.

How much does your build weights?

I want a dual motor lightweight esk8 to take it to places where I need to carry/lift it a lot, like banks, the dentist or offices. 

I'm considering:

Hi5ber Ion-30

And this Loaded Cantellated
```

---
## \#30 Posted by: Jedi Posted at: 2018-02-21T01:15:23.161Z Reads: 189

```
My build weighs around 16 lbs (7.5 kg) with a solo motor. 

The Hi5ber Ion 30 is sweet, but has a wheelbase of only 16 inches. So space would be limited. 

The Cantellated Tesseract has a wheelbase of 24.5-26 inches, with length at 36 inches. 

For me, my height, length of arms: any deck under 33 inches is perfect to mall grab without hitting the ground. 

Another option would be the Truncated Tesseract. It keeps the 24.5-26 inch wheelbase, with a shorter length of 33 inches.

Thanks for that @jedi

I'm looking for something even shorter, like 30-33" with kicktail and a Wheels base of 20", not sure if there's something available with those specs

how tall are you @Eboosted?

my limelite came drilled with another set of rear truck mounting holes about 2 inches inside those pictured on the hi5ber website. With the length and spoon shape it gives it a rear kick-tail and can be set up with a wheel base around what you are looking for...

it is a full sized platform though at 10 inches wide, might be too big for you?

Wow that Hi5ber Limelite is sweet, but US$ 220 for a deck makes me think about it twice, however it's a full 36" longboard

My Raptor 2 is 38" but it weights too much, I understand one of the reasons is the deck they used. So swapping to something like this is not a bad idea

my opinion, this deck is unique.  always useful.

Update:

The board was too fast. I changed the vesc settings from 45a motor max and batt max to 30a for both. Much better now, I topped out at 25mph. 

The vesc is awesome, so smooth! 

Love the Popoca's, the perfect size and hardness. And no wheelbite with only 1/8" risers. 

Love the deck! It has the slightest amount flex that's perfect for dampening vibrations while maintaining the stiffness needed to fly. 

Oh, and the Riptide bushings are quality.

The trucks are pretty solid. Bushings swap is a must. The mount works well with the trucks, but only works with the right motors.
