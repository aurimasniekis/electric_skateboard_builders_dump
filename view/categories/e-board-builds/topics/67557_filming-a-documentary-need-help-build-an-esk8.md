Hey guys,

First time builder here, and i have an obscure task ahead of me. I am a film maker and looking to create a documentary to raise awareness for Cystic Fibrosis by taking a DIY board across Europe to various rock climbing. This will also be a tool to show other CF patients that you dont have to live life in a bubble. My brother has CF, and the goal would be to take him and 3 others along with me on this trip. So I would be building 4 different decks to make this happen. Heres the goal of each deck:

What I want accomplished in the boards:
- Portable
- Removable Battery
- Top speed of 20+
- 30+ mile range
- Fast Charging
- Charging while braking w/ switch to turn off brake charging ( if possible )

Hey bro! Sounds like a cool project, I would love to do some long distance riding! I think that If you want some crazy range, you could use 3x of these lipos:

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-16000mah-4s-12c-multi-rotor-lipo-pack-w-xt90.html?___store=en_us

Maybe use a bms and charge at 3 amps to be safe

I think 6380 motors are an overkill for what you are looking for, specially for portability. I think that 6355 will get you the speed and help with the range that you need.

I decided to go with the 6380 for the pure torque to get up an incline. What do you think about handling the inclines? Would you still say to go with the 6355?

If you are using a single 6355 no, but dual 6355 would be a great option. Also an 6374 single motor would work just fine

Maybe a more experienced rider can answer that but as far as I know 6355 would work fine, if not 6374 definetly would do the job.

PULSE 5000mAh 12S 44.4V 45C Stick Version

Ive been looking at this guy. Id really like to keep it with 12s. If I ran the 4s in (Series?) would it give me the 12s and the long distance of the 16000 mah?

https://www.helidirect.com/plu45-500012-pulse-lipo-5000mah-44-4v-45c-stick-version.html

If I run these in (Parallel?) itd give me 20000 mah but its not very cost effective. Thoughts?

I was looking at running the 6380 in dual. I also want to make sure of longevity. If i dont fully push these motors to what they are completely capable of then I should, in theory, have a very reliable motor. Right?

If you ran the 3x 4s batteries in series you will get a 12s1p 48000 mAh battery pack. That has 35~ miles of range. 20000 mAh will get you 18~ miles of range

So running dual 6380 motors will be a very tight fit and I think it is completely unnecessary. If you want a ton of torque dual 6374 will be fine, and for mild inclines 6355 motors will be good. I live in San Francisco and I use dual 6355 and they work great, but for your constant riding dual 6374 may be the best option with 218  mm trucks

The p is for parallel. Series will increase your range, and parallel will increase your torque and speed. Lipos provide a very good discharge rate though and so you will need no parallel connections.

Edit: 1p means one battery in parallel, and so on ex: 5p= 5 batteries in parallel

series will increase your speed, but the same battery total watthours configured more in parallel will get you pretty close to the same range
you could charge super fast so you don't have to wait and can keep weight down. .   get a charger that could do maybe 3000watts and probably get lifopo cells.  bigger but you can charge fast and more safely and wont have to worry.
and the two big motors.  and run vesc FOC program so you don't have to hear them whine.

charge rate of 80 amps max stated!! at 50 volts..4000 watts...but theyre overrated and 3000 be conservative!  do the trip in a day.

This is fantastic man.  Great stuff!  Hopefully we can rally round and make it a trip to remember.  Just asked the mods to help with getting some local guys out to show support on the way.  
Guys look at the itinerary and tag anyone you know in each place and lets get amongst it!
I will be in England at that time and hopefully catch you at some point.  
Good luck with the trip and getting some awareness out there!

Just to be sure before you buy everything. 3 x 4s 16000mAh Lipo battery, yes it will give you 12s1p but it's not correct to say that the capacity also increase. So it would still be 16000mAh which is a lot but not 48000mAh as @Jake2k17 mentioned. To increase range (capacity) you need to increase the p group (parallel), if you increase the voltage (s group series) you don't gain capacity. Good project BTW! Respect!

Since u seem to be planning to take airports, I think u need to plan ahead that u will have to deal with airport security and basically the only way how to bring larger size lithium batteries, is to bring them with u in cabin.

There are a few discussions about this, but basically smaller size modules, which u can connect and disconnect are the best..

Also not sure which roads u plan to travel but I would probably go with small size pneumatic wheel setup, it might kill some range but will definately improve the ride comfort and help face the obstacles.

Other than that wish u luck on finishing build, theres quite a planning ahead of u, if u wish to partake this :slight_smile:

Ive considering going hitchiking around Eu with eboard but ive always stuck with idea I might need to take 2x every part as replacement, if something goes bad..

Few guys I met with ebikes said it is not a problem to find where to charge up batteries, so I guess I would be more inclined to make it durable.

But why make a giant battery when it looks like u will be charging periodically and not needing it.  And why not go with a smaller high power battery such as quite the headway red cells where u could charge at a stated 80 amps, super fast.

Haven't read through the whole thread, but I did read your part list.

You prioritization should not be power or speed, but range and reliability. 

I would suggest against the Multistar batteries, since their price/performance is abysmal versus what else you can buy/assemble. A **12S5P** Samsung 25R setup will offer you 550 Watt Hours at a fraction of the cost and at half the weight. Even though a 25R pack will have 20% less capacity than the Multistar, that should get you 30 miles, no problem.

I would just run with Zealous bearings instead of the Bones Reds. They're well made, and have built in spacers and speedrings that make wheel swapping/maintenance a lot easier.

For motor mounts, I would suggest motor mounts with idler pulleys, since this will improve your capability to coast your board, and thus preserve power.

Avoid using a mosfet switch. Mosfets can give out on you, and if they do, that's game over for your trip. Use a simple XT90 Anti Spark loop key.

For wheels, I would suggest ABEC 11's thane, or Orangatang's happy thane.

For the motor controller, **DO NOT get the TB ESC. Definitely don't get the TB VESC either**. Those 2 ESCs are known to fry rather easily due to a numerous amount of reasons. You should be avoiding 4.12 VESC hardware. Go straight to VESC6 hardware.

Edit: I read through the thread. 6374 motors reliable enough for your case. The brand that you buy has a larger impact on the motor's reliability. TB motors are okay, but I would suggest spending the extra bit of cash on @JLabs's stuff, since they seem very well made versus TB's motors. No hard feelings here for TB's stuff, but I've quite a few TB motors break down. The sample size might heavily affect my analogy, but that is for you to decide.

a good idea would be to use the 12s5p, and then use a box of some description and build one of these:

why does it only charge at 4a though and with lipo could do it much faster.   but then youd be carrying around lipos and a booster in your bag.

https://a123batteries.com/product_images/uploaded_images/26650.pdf

these with 3p and you could charge at 30amps.   and be done charging up to 80% in...like 15 minutes.   and then youd have like 6 amp hours and could do 20 more miles.  break for 15 minutes to charge.  continue.

to each there own but id rather be skating a lot instead of sitting around a charger.
and save bucks with a skipped bms and this relatively cheap power supply.

I really don't wanna charge my 10s4p pack with more than 4A. Also, this is continuously charging while riding! Lipo, step-up and other bits an pieces mounted to the deck, between the legs or onto the rear truck base plate. Technically, I could get high capacity, low discharge 18650 cells and ditch the lipo which do the same job and I don't have to be afraid of a lipo living in my apartment :slight_smile:

Charging while riding?!  What’s the point as you’ll then be carrying two batteries and the gizmo. ..and then how will u charge the lipo? It’s the same can of worms and sounds like you’ll be sitting around waiting for that.  If u aren’t injured by the contraption and lipos on ur deck

I wouldn't get lipos id get the iron cells above and charge them in like 15 minutes.  but that's going along with my own fantasy of how i'd travel long distance and be able to go and go.   id get that monster power supply above or one like it too.
lipo is a risky business to some degree as theyre kinda fragile especially if this is all new to you.  I don't mean just fire potential and Ive ruined many without fires

 and i'd also get a couple backup vescs or maybe at least only run bldc program the whole time to be safe.

Only 3 26650's in parallel will give me 20 miles?

you'll need a bunch in series too of course and these have a slightly lower voltage so maybe youd run 13 or 14s and then you should be able to get 20 miles roughly.

 it just seems if youre reaaaaly trying to go long distance, which is the big attraction of this thread for me,  you don't want to rely on a huge battery but instead a super fast charging battery.   even with a huge battery youre going to have to sit around ages charging.   it would be a coffee shop event instead of a riding event.

Heres the struggle though. If I am only going roughly 20 miles then the maximum distance i can go with out of risk of being stranded i can only go 15 miles. and do that to get to another town with enough resources for me to charge would be extremely difficult. Id rather have a 30+ mile battery so i dont have to risk not getting to a plausible size town to charge in Ireland. As a 15 min charge time sounds great. I wouldnt be able to risk not making it to a town 25 miles away.

making it as big as need be to get you that 25 mile range is no problem, so you are limited still to a larger size, but you can still do the fast charging and with lifepo or lithium iron cells (same thing) you can fast charge and do it safely.   the benefits of the iron cells go way beyond this too and Im always telling new people to get them as so many people ruin their lipos while the iron cells are pretty hard to damage and almost impossible to start on fire.  and then lasting like 4x the lifecycles is a huge plus.

Hey guys, would these trucks work? Paris V2 195mm, 50°

Loaded is interested in the project and asked if there were any specific products we were interested in. Liqwood boards is also interested in doing a collaboration to sell long distance esk8 longboards with us.
