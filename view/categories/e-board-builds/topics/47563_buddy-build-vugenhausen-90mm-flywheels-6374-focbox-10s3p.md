This is a build for a friend of mine that is coming from out of town for a few days.  He wanted to try an electric skateboard, none of mine are tame enough for someone that has never ridden before and I didnt wanna tear any of my boards down (cause they are my little lightning powered murder board babies :slight_smile: ) so I figured I'd just build him one.  I picked up a 2012 Arbor Vugenhausen on ebay a while back, I'm a huge fan of this board so I was gonna me it anyways.  If he likes it he may take it with him, if not I will likely put it up for sale here for cost.  

I am only including a screenshot of the build log for now, I don't have all of the parts in hand yet so it may change.  As always, when its complete and tested I will post pics and the finalized build log complete with links and prices.

You will notice on the bottom of the log that I have included some extra components.  I have left room in the design process to add parts making this a dual motor build.  Currently it will be a single 6374, if I upgrade it to a dual it will be offset (1 side heal side, 1 side toe side) along the same lines of the Ollin Free Ride.

Anyways that's all for now, Ill post when I have more info...this weekend or next most likely.

If we could all be so lucky to have a friend casually build a board for us! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

Well, he will pay for it if he keeps is and Ill sell it if he doesn't so it all works out. Besides this is a guy Ive known since high school, I mean he knows all the stupid shit I did so I hate to tell him no :):joy:

Will do.  There won't be much too it, its just a single 6374 motor, 10s3p battery, switch, voltmeter, charge port, wheels and trucks on a deck.  A pretty simple build, you'd think I could get it done in a couple of hours.  Waiting on parts, I swear I spend my life waiting on parts :slight_smile:.

just saying, you can probably do an equally powerful build for a lot cheaper

Where exactly would I save money without sacrificing performance or reliability or safety?  I'm genuinely hoping to hear something good.

are torqueboards 218 mm trucks necessary? I can not imagine you loosing performance compared to 35 buck calibers. Also, your battery is kinda expensive, and I guess you loose performance and all, but is 9000mah needed? You said your builds are not not tame enough. Is this? lol:grinning:

Well, I don't know if I would use the word 'necessary' but my friend weighs about 260 and has never skated before.  so I think th eTB 218 trucks will make it easier.  That battery is cheap as hell, you would be hard put to get a 30q battery anywhere close to that price.  I'll tame the board by limiting ERPM and Motor Max.  This gives you a board you can grow into and unleash as your skill level increases.

I think so, but we do some trading back and forth and @JLabs is good guy.  He helps me out from time to time so I can help other people out. Also, this was the last one of these on hand.

I think I just shit myself. You just said a fully loaded 10s3p 30Q battery pack for $275 was expensive. 

Time to go change..

I got really excited, I thought you dropped the price to 275 for some reason. It was a too good to be true kind of thing.

On bkb website, it said 400 bucks, so that was the price I was going at. You can get a 12s3p at that price from torqueboards, but i get what you are saying about the 30q cells. To me it just seems like for a board which is supposed to be "tame", this is complete overkill. I guess overkill is good. :wink:

Yeah, I like to call overkill bullet proof.  There's no way this board should have any issue at 12 mph while my friend learns to ride.

When I say tame in regards to this one I mean 15mph and a slow acceleration curve and light brakes.

Thank you very much! I've been riding a gen 2 evolve for like a year now and i'm in need of more EVERYTHING! Torque and Speed mostly! Thinking of doing an All-terrain build but they seem harder to do :confused:

Agreed. Been scrubbing through everywhere. I'm a college kid and don't have all the fancy machines to mill parts down so i'm looking for a more plug and play type solution. Soldering i'm very good at and spot-welding (but i don't plan on making my own battery yet)

Well...I hit a wall today.  Finally got time to finish this build, or so I thought. With the motors sensor wire connected the VESC reboots constantly, Everytime I try to move the motor. Also, the remote is dead.  I used it for maybe 2 mins and the n the trigger pot got wobbly, now it will bind but nothing else. 

Gonna try again tomorrow with another vesc a and see if it's the motor or the VESC. Used an old nano to test with tonight ruling out the new remote as the issue. I've got a spare steez v2 I'm gonna use on to finish it up.

the sensor port :slight_smile:.  Its the VESC, I swapped ti and now it reads the sensor perfectly.

She is up and running!  I'm not real happy about the phase/sensor wire routing, but I'll fix it later.  I needed to get it done to take out of town tomorrow.

I ended up using a 10s3p 30q pack I already had, that was not currently in a board.  It's sans-BMS, I wanted to get back to testing charge/discharge - 10% and see if it keeps self balancing.
