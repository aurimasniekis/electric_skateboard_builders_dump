Some advice is that I am also a freshman in highschool and I was trying to do the same by selling it and I had a sector nine deck,vesc, 192kv motor, 8s batteries and I tried selling it for $550 and I did not get a offer to buy it for 2 weeks I ended up keeping it. Any way good luck mabye drop the price.

I feel bad to crush your hope, but aftermarket for all kind of diys are bad. VERY bad. Basically it's good if you can get even half of what you spent. Build quality have to be very polished if you want even some profit.
