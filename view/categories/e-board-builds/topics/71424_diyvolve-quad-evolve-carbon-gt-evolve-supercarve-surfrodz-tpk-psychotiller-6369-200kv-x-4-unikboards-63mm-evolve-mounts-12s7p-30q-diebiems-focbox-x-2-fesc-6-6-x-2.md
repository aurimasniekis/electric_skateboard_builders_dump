Longtime lurker, first time build poster. 

I‚Äôll hit details soon, but with the Renegade races in Vegas almost on us, I hit a snag. Does anyone local to LA, San Diego have a flipsky dual 6.6 they would trade for two singles or sell ASAP? This fit is no damn good:

@mccloed? @psychotiller is that what you guys got? Or was that 4.12?

Update: 
-@psychotiller and @mccloed hooked me up with some more parts last minute. Pulled an all nighter, drove to races next day. 
-went to Vegas, didn‚Äôt finish build... again (missed 4wd setup for evolve World Cup too)!
-use bathroom as workshop. 
-build complete. 
-now in an uber to see esk8 gods at the oasis. If you are going to pop an esc, this is the place to do it. I burned some heatshrink as a symbolic offering before I left. May they find the smell of hot electronic bits and burned finger tips compelling and allow this board to take flight.

Whats with the usb's? and the wireless relay? How are you running 4WD with 2 ESC's?

The UBEC is to provide power to lights that will hopefully be controlled with the little remote. I also wanted to board to double as the penultimate USB battery pack. 

I‚Äôve got two trusty focboxs and a dual flipsky 6.6 up front. 

Scrapped the diebiems secondary to discharge limitations. 

... I do have three of those things, and other packs, maybe when the ‚Äúslave bms over canbus‚Äù opens up, I‚Äôll return to those.

It was the ppm splitter all along! I made my own shorter one. I unclipped the positive wire from the 6.6 dual vesc. ![image|375x500](upload://t3CRsizoYVngjTehxxJJ8QsQQ1K.jpeg)

I dunno, the asymmetry bothers me.  They were available @psychotiller ‚Äòs garage and I was a jerk and didn‚Äôt plan ahead to order Both the pair of boxes and a heat sink. The flipsky has a sink that fits perfectly on the deck.

Do you think that the BMS would limit two 6380's running on a 12s pack? (with focbox unity)?

The unity says it‚Äôs good for 160A continuous. The torqueboards 6380s are rated at 80A each. 

A 12s battery would have to be at least 8p if your shooting for max out the 80A in the vesc battery max settings. (Assuming 30q cells). 

I went charge only BMS for this. ![image|666x500](upload://pqcKulzniwQqSCrVMJhrNFZahL7.jpeg) 

The diebiems has an 80A fuse on it (2nd group buy batch). I‚Äôve seen posts with pics of 100A fuses and I think the BOM could technically rate it at 120A.

I see, yeah i worried such but what i really liked about the DieBieMS is it seems really reliable and (advanced) user friendly. Not to mention it would allow for connection to the Unity via Canbus to allow for communication. 
Would you have any recommendations for a 12s BMS then? (to use if i were to go charge only) 

Many thanks!

-Buildkitboards sells bestech BMS,

Im not sure where the white one above cane from. I think they were bulk ordered. 

Maybe @E1Allen or @psychotiller could point you in the right direction to getting a cheap charge only  bms.

Update on continuous tinkering: 

Lost some weight for summer. 27.5lbs
Got rid of dad bod hump. Rider and board total: 195 (added 2lbs for helmet üëç)

I can open Hood in seconds now:
https://vimeo.com/330165245

I used these automotive hood quick releases x2:

Not sure why photo tone was artsy, maybe a filter was on. 

I used basswood strips for the sides of the new carbon fiber top, markered them black. 

Time to work on batteries and for custom kv 6374s from @psychotiller to arrive stateside already. üëç 

Haven‚Äôt gone fast in a few months. Shooting for a documented 50mph sprint on a straight, perfect course.

(Current PR is low 40s, the jump from 30s to 40s was uncomfortable, not sure how moestooge and Lucius do 50s on regular terrain during races) 

Recommendations on the best/most believable way short of buying a radar or getting a speeding ticket?
