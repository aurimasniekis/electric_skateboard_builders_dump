**A build thread! Hold on to your penis - this is going to detailed**

This build is becoming quite popular/generic now and that's because it's damn beautiful. I've had a lot of questions about the pictures I've put up so here's a build thread so that we can all own this amazing gathering of talent.

I had a lot of fun with this, I started ordering parts around August last year... esk8 cares not for your time constraints 

**First things first, choose a theme for your build:**

![20181119_200736|666x500](upload://gHYfcZDPkYRCmUTXshwrmOoELGH.jpeg) 

_**Shopping list:**_

![20181119_200811|666x500](upload://a8n2ygbMtV3tUlDfnSkUksdOGo.jpeg) 

**Deck:** @Hummie single channel

**Enclosure:** @bigben single stack enclosure secured with m5 inserts and bolts with fender washers. I stole this enclosure straight out of Ben's workshop before he had even had time to finish it properly :rofl: I had to resort to child labour.

![20190223_120543|374x500](upload://uUFg14JH0b59pWHi3amV4bRuWJn.jpeg) 

**Mounts:** A set of Psychotiller TKP mounts

**Trucks:** Surf Rodz 177mm TKP trucks back and front. Front axles 80mm and back axles 90mm

![20181114_173348|374x500](upload://2U4hjqPC9We5VbQ2ZT3uzpU4ArG.jpeg) 

**Wheels:** Using Torqueboards TB110, ABEC 107 and Bergmeister wheels from Haggy @riverside.rider depending on where Iâ€™m riding

![20190415_001758|374x500](upload://zkZsGcylbXjE7bpttvrEkYfBhqb.jpeg) 

**Battery:** 10s5p 30Q pack built by a master with a small bestech bypass bms. It needs to be flexible because the deck is bouncy.

![20181216_171357|374x500](upload://qM1NGcEucSVRgvD4UgmAjMFUE25.jpeg) 

**ESC:** Focbox Unity, I made little adapters so that I didn't void the warranty and because I know it would piss Brian off.

![20190102_220025|375x500](upload://zHp3zVnwOZKROQHHZDJcTLocG5H.jpeg) 

![20190102_224752|375x500](upload://TiIWjiKI8HLvcRUzzL5ogLhEqt.jpeg) 

![20181219_132451|374x500](upload://onIFB69W18qBOc5jjGlp6vLgiQ6.jpeg) 

**Motors:** Maytech unsealed 6374 x 2

**Pulleys:** 3DServisas push fit pulleys for urethane, Bergmeister pulley for pneumatic and steel motor gears from @JLabs. 15/40 and 15/60.

![20190406_151615|375x500](upload://avnalhSbNXhqnhwdvvld0G1b6Yh.jpeg) 

**Belts:** 285mm x 15mm continental belts for urethane. 350mm x 15mm for pneumatics. Top tip: don't buy cheap belts.

**Bushings:** Riptide Krank Tall Barrel 93a board side and Riptide Krank Fatcone 93a road side from @Alphamail 

**Grip:** Jessup grip tape - but Iâ€™ll use vicious next time because when Iâ€™m riding on the promenade and sea sand gets on the deck I lose grip on my feet and I can't do sick 180 dick flips to woo the ladies.

**_Miscellaneous buys that add up to 7 million dolla_**

For axles I use 80mm M8 shoulder bolts on the front and 90mm on the back (with push fit pulleys on both the bergs and thane)

I keep my wheels, spacers and bearings together on the axle with the bolt through them all and spacers and shims in place with a m8 nut on the end for storage so it canâ€™t all come apart. That way I can swap from thane to bergs in less than a minute and pop the other wheels away on the shelf, in my bag or simply hand them to my man-servant.

For spacers I just found a local place that sells 10mm ID 16mm OD allu spacers, they can be had online though for very little. Get 10mm long ones for most of the spacing at the back but some 30mm ones for your front axles are great because you only need one of them on each side.

![20181103_201152|375x500](upload://doF28J3N9IKAbaOAjHT6SHixOve.jpeg) 

To shim youâ€™ll need washers. 10mm ID 13mm OD 1mm thick like these - https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Aluminium-Flat-Washers-6mm-8mm-10mm-12mm-14mm-16mm-18mm-20mm-22mm-26mm/281770185167?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649 - Get shitloads of these!

Weather strip was used as a gasket and I used 2mm thick sheet foam inside the enclosure to reduce vibrations and keep everything tidy.

Bearings are these [https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/10x22x6-Rubber-Sealed-Bearing-6900-2RS-10-Units-/142101569350 ](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/10x22x6-Rubber-Sealed-Bearing-6900-2RS-10-Units-/142101569350) - Thereâ€™s nothing better and they wonâ€™t break the bank.

Thereâ€™s a grub screw in the hangar, take it out and throw it away. Vibrations from longer axles will cause it to scratch and mar the surface of the shoulder bolt and you wonâ€™t be able to get it out after ~100 miles. A bit of 290 loctite on the shoulder screw is all you need to keep the bolt in place.

Loctite everything! After about 20 miles I took everything apart to look at it (thanks for the tip @akhlut)  and my bearing seat to hangar bolts were both backed out to the point where they were ruined and the thread was questionable. 290 on everything you might need to get out and 680 on your pulleys.

I chose not to drill any holes in my enclosure, taking a leaf out of @bigben's book.I wanted to keep water ingress points to a minimum and not mount anything to to enclosure so that taking it off and working on it would be easy. Charge port is mounted on the side of the board and I roll to start with my unity, battery meter is my phone and I plan to extort one of @b264's plug in meters from him as soon as I get some juicy ammunition.

Shoutouts to all the people who made the stuff I'm using, @mmaner for all the advice and useful threads, @Sender for his abs of steel and @DerelictRobot because no one else loves him.

Build images in no particular order, just a random collection. Trying belts, wheels, testing fitments and spacers.

Something looks really out of wack here but can you tell me if the bushing seat is parallel to the washer on the base plate?  Did you also use a longer king pin to fit the TallBarrel roadside?

The SR kingpin is actually pretty long. It is parallel, I initially used a normal barrell and found it to be too short.

I'd defer to your experience on it though and for the sake of others reading this in the future I'd better get it right. Want some more images? 

It feels incredibly good to ride on, a significant improvement over the stock bushings in my opinion.

Nice build @brenternet! I might steal that griptape design from you if you don't mind :stuck_out_tongue:

What kind of ground clearance are you getting with the ABEC wheels? Interested because I currently have haggy wheels and a double-stack, which should have the exact same clearance. Want to know if speed bumps are an issue.

Speed bumps no, I've been over a few and held my breath but it's never connected. There are a few light scratches on my mounts and there's one long one down the middle of my enclosure where I went over a root. As I approached it I thought "that's going to scratch" and then did it anyway because yolo and all that.

It's not precious in this set up. You can ride it without too much care, I am transitioning from pavement to road, riding some rough cobble and not really thinking about it. It'll strike things and get scratched but that's just the nature of esk8 right :slight_smile:
