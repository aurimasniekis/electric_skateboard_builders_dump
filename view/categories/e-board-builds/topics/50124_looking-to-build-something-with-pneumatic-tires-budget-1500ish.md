Hey guys, I've been riding e-skates for almost 3 years now started on the OG Boosted Board v1 and got the v2 6 months ago. I'm looking to make something to my liking. I am more than willing to learn stuff along the way programming VESC etc. I was wondering if you guys can help me. I've been on the forums and try to keep up to date with stuff. Anyways enough about me onto what I am looking to build:

 [This board is what I have in mind](https://imgur.com/a/6mqYk)

- **Budget:** $1500ish USD willing to come closer to $2000 USD if I need to wait longer and my result will be leagues better (the price includes buying stuff like tools ex: soldering kit)

- **Remote:** the [Simple 3D-printed NRF remote - Arduino controlled](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543) by @solidgeek is what I'd like to use 

- **Tires:**  some sort of AT tires is what I am aiming for I really like these [Airless All-Terrain Off-Road Wheels](http://www.diyeboard.com/6-15050mm-70a-airless-allterrain-offroad-skateboard-wheels-p-568.html) but also cool with going with the conventional w/ air AT tires

- **Range:** 20-30 miles of range sticking around the 25mph zone at all times. I'm also curious about chargers for the battery, what do you recommend?

- **Deck:** sort of short, I'd like it to be shorter than a boosted length 38" however if what I am asking for above does not fit well with a shortboard then I am okay with. I'm also curious about enclosures as I don't have the skills to make one myself and want a nice looking one.

I know I am missing a lot but I was hoping you guys could see what I wanted and help me make a parts list to fit my needs and budget. Thank you for reading this and God's Speed to all of you :) .

I just got a moonshine sidekick, I'm currently working on an enclosure for it. It'd be my light board to carry around on short commutes
