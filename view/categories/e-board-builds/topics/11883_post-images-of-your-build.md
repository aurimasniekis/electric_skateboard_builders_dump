It's a Castle Talon 90A (Heli ESC). It can't coast, it doesn't have an adjustable brake (just on or off), it's also lost 1 cap already and one of the motor leads has broken off 3 times. But I'd still refer to it as "reliable-ish".

@mattdig do you mean it doesnt have cruise control? Also are the breaking and throttle good/decent? The breaks on mine now are rubbish, not even worth having them!
```

I mean that it can only be accelerating or braking, there's no middle where the wheels can spin with no power, so pushing is literally impossible. And the brake is very powerful.

@mattdig I used a helicopter esc on my first build (the tupperware one). I thought it was okay at the time. But now that I have used the vesc I could never go back. @Charster10  I would suggest an rc car esc if your gonna go with a hobby grade one cause they are designed to have good brakes (not just on or off).

Every time I would brake with my heli esc the wheel would just lock up :joy:

@ndwallick ah ok i see. Do you recon the breaking and acceration would be decent on this?  http://www.hobbyking.co.uk/hobbyking/store/__77144__HobbyKing_174_8482_X_Car_Beast_Series_ESC_1_8_Scale_120A.html The only reason im not going with like a vesc is because I wont use the board loads and also because well i havent spent a penny over £230 for this build so far...i aimed for £300 max but came way under so trying not to spend to much to finish it off

Also i recommend shortening your battery wires unless you have some capacitors on them! If there over 12 inches shorten them before something goes wrong! You dont want them longer than 11-12 inches!  @2-alex-2

Getting this one made from scratch and into a drop through then I'm adding some more wood to the base to make a smooth custome enclosure.

Yea they are shorter than that.

that esc looks good but the comments below it say people are having trouble finding the programming card so watch out for that. Also it's only 6s which is fine if that's what your planning to use

If i cant find it i wont buy it but what im planning to do is currently i have 2 x 3s 5ah lipos in series which makes them 6s...im going to add another 2 the same but add a switch in between the possitive. Basically this diagram below is what im doing so when one pair of batteries runs out i can switch the other lot on! :) <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/c/1c9159b48d07d90409dc62c3a9521c92a8ed4d08.png" width="690" height="387"> basically the positive termial will get turned off...

My first build I want it to be up to 3-3,5kg so to continue to make some basic tricks.
I guess i will need small deck,,one motor,6s battery something like @Jordo but more curve deck and smaller wheels

Dependent on your needs.. I would just connect the 4 lipo's
So you still have 6s, just connect the battery packs in parallel, so your current cells will be each parallel with the extra ones..
This will give you a simple charging scheme (will take longer thoe..) And the discharge will feel like you can run forever at high speed, instead of having full speed, slower slower slower.. stop, change pack, full speed, slower slower... :)
