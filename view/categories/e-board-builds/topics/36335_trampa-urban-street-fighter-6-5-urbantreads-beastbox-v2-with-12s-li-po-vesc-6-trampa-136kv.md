@sender get a solid 39 kph out of it, but using the trucks on the inside setting i've turned down the top end on VESC tool to avoid the dreaded speed wobble! Torque is good! set it slightly more progressive on VESC tool so its bit of a smoother take off and bit more control low end speed weaving through town. smashed up 12% grad hills on roads with a bit of a run-up the other eve hard going mid with the slicks on in the wet!! haha  havent really had chance to test proper uphill in the dry yet.

Nice and clean look! I like the name urban street fighter a lot :laughing:! With top mounted battery and vesc you really can fight the streets and curbs without worries. I have a Mountain Fighter with top mounted electronics and enjoy the worry free ride. But after some weeks the nice Trampa sticker is almost gone :joy:
