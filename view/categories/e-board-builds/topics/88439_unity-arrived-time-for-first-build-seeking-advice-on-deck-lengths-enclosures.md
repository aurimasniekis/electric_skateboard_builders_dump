Hi howdy. 

First post, first build, long-time lurker (literally years, off and on). Grew up tooling around on a carveboard surfstik (great board). I bike to work in Boston, and am looking to build a reliable fun commuter board for warm weather. Basically saw @egzplicit 's [Jet Invasion](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/001-jet-invasion-voyager-x-evolve-trucks-dual-6355s-190kv-custom-10s4p-30q-focbox/37352) build I thought yes please. So!

The goodies so far:

I picked up a bunch of evolve parts (trucks, wheels, belts, motor plates) on the cheap ($200 total) when I was doing a gig in Australia. Unity ($300) just came today. De-branded chineseium remote ($30). Racerstar 140kv motors & pulleys (~$50 ea). Likely to upgrade the hangers to those [elofty](https://lofty-skateboard.com/collections/home/products/eletric-skateboard-direct-drive-motor-with-boosted-wheels-1) boys once there's a bit more knowledge about them.

Would appreciate some advice on decks and enclosures. So below is an image of various decks compared to an Evolve Bamboo GT. I want a more compact board than 38", but still something that can handle AT wheels and my 6'1" 180lb self. From left to right - Bustin Sportster 35.5", Rayne Reaper 36", Bamboo GT 38", and Restless Mantis 33". All are aligned to the truck mount holes. Any thoughts, advice?

On enclosures: the Bamboo GT has a 10s4p+Unity modeled on it, surrounded by the 405 enclosure from @psychotiller. It will definitely fit. However! The deck to the left, the Reaper 36", has a 10s4p+Unity surrounded by the Knuckles enclosure. It _looks_ like it could fit. Maybe. Has anyone tried cramming a 10s4p+Unity in one of them? If it does fit, that would make a greater variety of decks viable.

Glad to be here!

I’ve recently built a lacroix and don’t care for it.   I have a gtx and I have taken the inclosure off and test fitted a 10s4p with the unity and 10s Bms.  It fits but the cells are a little to tall, you will need a small rubber spacer of some sort to make enough room.  
I’m pulling the unity out of the lacroix and building what you are doing.  I just can’t make up my mind on which deck.
