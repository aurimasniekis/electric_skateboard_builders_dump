Hey, so my first build worked great but I'm focusing this board more on aesthetics. I may upgrade to dual 6355's in the future but I'm on a tight budget so this is gonna have to work for now. (I'm using the old motor)

**Parts List:**

Motor - http://bit.ly/2eMD3P1 - $90 
Trucks - http://amzn.to/2xdV6VU - $40
Battery - http://bit.ly/2iPM7Hv - $350
VESC - http://bit.ly/2gv0Sum - $160
Wheels - http://amzn.to/2wYSz5d - $60
Riser Pads - http://ebay.to/2eMJlhJ - $10
Mount - http://ebay.to/2wuxIUl - $45
255 Belt - http://ebay.to/2wYScYc - $6
Pulleys - http://bit.ly/2nTGOaQ - $50 
(Bought all pulleys separately)

**Total: $811**

The deck I'm using is called the "Sector 9 Bintang" which I think was around $90 -$ 100. The mounts are enertion clones but they work great. I'm using a 36t pulley for Orangatang Kegels, and a 16t pulley for my motor (8mm shaft)

I'm also using angle risers because of the mount and how you can't adjust its angle. The back trucks are already assembled which explains why I only took a picture of the front two...

Enclosure for the battery? Honestly I would go with MBS wheels. <== Looks more agressive. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074DGD33X/ref=twister_B074G95LP5?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

I have an enclosure specifically designed for that deck. Let me you if you would like one.

I was thinking of doing a two part enclosure design (boosted style) but for the shape of the Bintang. I saw your post in the past, was it easy fitting a 10S4P battery in a small enclosure? Ps I'm using my old enertion space cell pro

```
Update: I stripped (sanded) the paint off the board because the sector 9 design was a little too much with the green, black, yellow, and orange. Like I mentioned I'm using two angled risers because the enertion mount clone is not adjustable. My Pulley setup is 36t/16t

Very nicely. Since it's a two part clamp, I added some aluminum foil in between the trucks and the curve part of the clamp, and that made it a very tight and perfect fit.

Everything motor wise is done. Since I'm upgrading to dual soon i'm using my motor and battery from the first build (since I hit around 25 MPH on it) but I also want to make a two part enclosure one day with a more compact 10s3p battery.

I am just a beginner, but I finished my board a couple of weeks ago and I started with the Mini Remote Controller, but I have to say it lost signal all the time, my body even blocked the transition when moving my hand.

I recently switched to the New Maytech MTSKR1712 Remote and boy what a difference.  Also this remote has two start modes, normal and soft start, which for my over-powered board was perfect.

For those VESC you could use the Loaded Vanguard enclosure:

Griptape came! I'm trying to keep the griptape minimalistic and clean so all I did was trace it to the sides of the deck and cut it. I may add a logo so it doesn't look like one of those no branded electric longboards.

For the Mount pulley covers I ordered for someone to print it in ABS (I don't have a 3D printer obviously) But it was only around 6 bucks (I have no idea how 3D printing works and I'll probably never buy one since this is a tiny hobby).

P.S. I only bought the left one so far. Right one was designed by @SilentException

Thanks for the tag. Left one was designed by @Shogu12 and it fits his motor mount for sure. Watch out the depth, might be too shallow for some shafts/pulleys.

I did not print my design yet so it is untested. I made the cover because Shogu12 was not answering my call for the STL and had no idea that someone had his files already. I'll test and adjust my design when I get the chance to print it..

If I ever do create the 10S3P pack It's going to look something like this. Realize that the diagram pic is not accurate but I made it to show it's a 10S3P pack.

The reason half the battery's are black is because they are going to overlay the other battery's (Like the picture below.)

It's been a while since i've posted here but I added some new things. A lot of the parts I'm using has scratches from me riding the board.

I also added headlights, which I made for around $10 USD. I used "P" Clamps which was an idea from @lowGuido

The flashlights were 8 dollars from Walgreens, since no other stores were open (_Merry Christmas, or any other holiday you celebrate_ :slight_smile:)

The flashlights are actually very bright and light up a large chunk of the road at night.

For the taillights, I'm using "Serfas Thunderbolt USB Taillights" which I think are also used on Evolve's skateboards. I lost the rubber guard for it so i'm holding it on with hair-ties, but it does the job and doesn't look too bad. They are also very bright.

After **MANY** wrong orders, I finally got this one right and made my bluetooth module. I accidentally ordered JTS 1.0 connectors the first time, had to wait 7 days, and amazon also f***cked up my "Two Day Shipping" and it turned it into "Four Day Shipping". Some people said this diagram was wrong, others said it was right. I followed it anyways so if my longboard blows up we'll all know why :grin:

Just got around to painting my motor, motor mount hanger, and motor mount clamp. I'm using "Self Etching Primer" and glossy black spray paint from home depot.

Primer: https://thd.co/2meo2Jy

Paint: https://thd.co/2qGOAbf

I used 3 coats of primer on each part, and let them all dry for 30 minutes. My last coat I'm gonna let dry over night.

Alright, so my motor finally dried (here are some glamour shots.) It didn't turn out as smooth as I wanted it to be, but I didn't realize how hard evenly coating a round object was... I'm letting the mount hanger and mount clamp dry over night, then I'm going to spray the other side in the morning and let that dry. I also replaced the stock bearings in the motor with bone ceramics.
