THUMPER Trampa Electric Mountainboard LEV by Laurentius Judhianto

Hi Builders. It’s been a while since I did my first build with Project LACR http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/project-lacr-globe-the-maiden-deck-enertion-single-drive-propulsion-turnigy-sk3-6364-190-kv-vesc-4-10-turnigy-sentilon-100a-24v-10ah-zippy-flightmax-lipo-packs/1115

And from there I have made few more prototypes / builds which are more or less the same, however I would like to introduce my recently finished build, Project Thumper (named after Thumper the character of Bambi) :smiley:

As usual with all other eMTB builds, the base carbon fibre deck is made by Trampa. While they do now offer motor and motor mount, I gave them a shot. It's all arrived in a very well packaged box and pre-assembled so it was too easy for me to put it all together.

There aren't much special things I truly added within this build besides less obtrusive deck drilling and well protected electronics from water entering these enclosures. So I made all of the holes as small as possible. Soon I will put some more sealant to just secure everything.

PARTS:
- Dual Motor eMTB Holy Pro 15 ply 14 tooth set (inc motor mount) from Trampaboards
- Dual VESC 4.10 from Ollinboard
- Dual Enclosure from Underwater Kinetics
- Brooks Bicycle Light
- Bluetooth module from Metr.at
- 2.4 Ghz remote from Aliexpress
- Custom Battery Pack 42V 10Ah Li ion LG Battery (10S5P) with 30A BMS + charger
- Industrial Grade Capacitor from Conrad
- 80A Fuse from Conrad
- Loopkey using XT90 Anti Spark from HobbyKing

Dual 4.10HW VESC is configured with 2.8FW FOC Hybrid (sensored FOC mode)
Very smooth, very silent and very powerfull startup torque.
Maximum speed somewhere above 40km/h to 50km/h as "too scary too ride" for me.

10S5P Battery configuration by connecting 5 groups of 2S5P in series.
In my opinion this is not the best setup but its a decent - cheap BMS setup.

Bluetooth connection with iPhone to look up for speed, battery and distance Live just add new dimension in eBoarding. 

I love it being weather proof, I love the big 5 inch wheels running over everything.
Simplest charging of all with BMS, a voltage meter to add would be nice to have.
All connections are secured with cable ties, shrink wrap and wire mesh.

Personally I got to say that the motors are very well build, also provide ridiculous torque. Comparing 190KV SK3 torque to this 118KV torque would be unfair. However overall I found that 118kv is too slow if you only do 6S configuration. The torque is insane for normal street. But personally I like low KV alot as I can ride longer while keeping the motor current draw low (running cooler). On top of that with the motor spinning faster, makes it slightly more efficient in the long run.

Few eMTB disadvantages:
- Hard to make sharp turns
- Loosened truck / dampa makes it hard to control at speed over 25kmh
- Big and heavy for daily urban commuters
- For @trampa, please reduce the amount of bolts and nuts. Took sometime to assemble - disassemble completely.
- Lights are not so bright, but I like it :smiley:

I've also designed my own Trampa Mount Cover you can find in Thingiverse that helps keeping branches get stuck between the belt tooth. It's modular designed, so you can easily swap broken piece with new one.

One of the cleanest Trampa builds i've seen.  Well done.  The Brooks Bicycle Lights look classy.  I visited Amsterdam a little while ago and regret not touring the rest of the Netherlands.  It is such a beautiful place.  Can you post some pictures of the sites you see as your riding around ?

Thank you everyone.

@Rob.Endless Yes the torque is ridiculous, almost too much. But this give me alot of advantage in climbing and long distance travel as the motor wont heat up easily. As the speed im mostly riding is 20 - 30kmh, they are spinning fast enough to be efficient and smooth.

@mccloed I hate wires on bindings, I find it ugly. But wires at bottom also worries me alot. That limit the way you ride, no more jumps, slides and climbing over big things.

Yes I would love to have that wires running within the board deck. However in manufacturing perspective, building a cover / adding layers of carbon fibre on the cables works fine too.

If there is sharp object or running through pavement and the cable get damaged, short will occur. Replacing power cables also not something I really want to deal with.

First priority would be to add cover to the belt and motor as sometimes branches and leaves just stuck there.

Hey Laurnts great build.
Must have missed it in December.
Have you ridden that board enough to tell me something about these motors?
Since I have a similar build in progress and ordered the VESC6 beta I would love to try these motors.
The sensors make them interesting, but dang they are so f*****g expensive. Two would cost almost 460€ and I cant imagine that they are so much better than the usual SK3-6374s. I could buy five for the same amount.
Do you think they are worth it?

@Tarzan Yes I've ridden the board motors long enough both when its wet and dry. I really have to say that it really have insane torque, especially on a dual setup like me.

What is fabulous, is really those sensor! Since I use the sensor, I loved them so much on low speed. I basically can start from a deadstop on a hill without motor pulsing / cogging. Acceleration is more predictable and smooth.

I really can't switch back from hybrid FOC / hybrid BLDC. Won't happen.
The feeling is also like switching from ESC to VESC, once you get used to it, you won't go back.

Really like your build! :+1:

Do you really use this board off road, or more on the pavements? There is not a lot off road in Rotterdam I think.
How does it ride on the dutch pavements compared to your other board? Is it stable enough at higher speeds?
```

## \#12 Posted by: laurnts Posted at: 2017-03-14T13:54:11.581Z Reads: 452

@Cuprani Thank you!. I use it more often on the smooth bike lane and sometimes on the pavement. The ride on pavement is just smooth like a bike. Longboard wheels 90mm is not suitable for pavements, but the MTB wheels does the job very well.

The MTB is very stable, even more stable at higher speed, however I tend to loosen up the spring tension so that I can carve easier.

My only hate about MTB is just it's not as easy to use in Dutch bike lane. 90 degree turn on a small path is just hard to do. These makes me think about getting shorter deck, but anyway the ride is just more awesome than electric longboard.

--- Minor drawback is that it really catches alot of attention, so its common to have alot of questions as well as being stopped by others :smiley:

Really sweet build!! I think a good turning radius with loose trucks as well as stable high speeds can be achieved if trampa or other manufacturers added dampers to the trucks. You could also try to add a damper yourself as you are a diy'er. You could think of the dampers used on big RC cars or on the streering wheels of a motorcycle, plenty of -off the shelf-  dampers available that might work.

How much more does a MTB build cost compared to a similar street build (dual drive, large pack etc). I'd imagine the wheels, trucks, motor mounts and deck to increase the cost by at least 200 euros compared to a normal build.
```

@Stef Those +200 euro are the things you see. In total I think eMTB cost about 1000 euro more. Those cost comes from the MTB its self, expensive motor mount. But I also use Trampa Motors, Mounts and Dual VESC which ends up even more and more.

I think in general save to say it cost around 2500 euro excl build and shipping cost (also some import tax).

Beautiful build but no way it should run you that much. Keep your costs down and look for used boards. I got lucky and picked up a sweet Real Dirt with complete Trampa Trucks and wheels for 200. The mounts I got/getting are another 180 from Idea. Then boxes-100, ESC Vesc 6.0 - 400, wires -20 and motors- 160 that's €1200 max.

@trampa The idea to remove the dampa from the front spring is a really good idea to be able to carve harder in the city for a speed between 15kmh up to 30kmh. At 40kmh plus is too wobbly even with the dampa attached (yellow dampa).

Now I really feel like going around again with the eMTB in the city since it's more safe to ride when you can corner easier. Maybe I should test removing the yellow dampa from the rear truck as well! :smiley:

Hall sensor operation have nothing to do with VESC / BLDC tool function since motor without hall would still be detected anyway. I also have once a faulty hall sensor and my VESC & BLDC tool still works. So I am not quite sure what are you facing with.

45max is more then enough. 60A will only decrease your performance (stator saturation). Motor min and battery min should have the same value. The lowest value will always count.

Hey Frank,

I'm having trouble getting to vesc to power on correctly with the hall sensor from the trampa motor connected. When will disconnect the hall sensor it responds correctly to the transmitter and bldc tool and red lights on the vesc flash followed by a solid blue light. When I plug in the hall sensor the vesc doesn't flash red it goes straight to a solid blue light and it doesn't connect to bldc tool with USB 

Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance

So after a while, I have decided to move on with the project. Soon enough after I felt that I have finished with the board, I am still left unsatisfied. I feel that I could do alot more than this. Therefore I have decided to give it an upgrade starting by learning 3D and purchasing a 3D printer.

After few hours learning tutorial, I have end up creating a motor cover for Trampa eMTB motor. It looks like this.

Looks great laurnts! Do your motors have temp sensors? If not, be careful and try to touch the motor regularly on your first rides to check if it stays cool enough from merely the conductive heat transfer through the motor mount.

They have a temp Sensor. Trampa motors come with hall and temp Sensors. I would keep an eye on the temp. since your enclosure doesn't seam to be very breezy. Did you see what I did with the motors? Official Trampa DIY thread - street and urban carve.

I agree it's not a breezy cover, but I want it like this for now as we have alot of rainy days in the Netherlands. Later on I will do the @trampa urban setup with the metal mesh filter on the motor. The carbon fiber part of the motor cover would be replaced with 3D printed parts where I could easily see close or open for air.

Nevertheless the motor never gets really hot during ride, it only gets abit warm. My battery is not big enough to make the motor runs warm. I am also 60kg in weight, 120kv ish dual is just an overkill of torque.

Yesterday I finished 3D printed the belt cover, also finished and painted. It fits quite well but there are some areas where I need to sand down further so that the belt doesn't touch the cover.  I'll make some photo soon.

Perfect. I only print Taulmann 645 Nylon on a Tufnol Whale Brand plate (cold) and if you like you can dye it later, using dye colours for clothing. the Nylon picks up water and the colour in it.

I have printed these with PLA and I still have problem printing with ABS especially on a large model. Never tried Nylon, but it seems to be very convincing. Currently I just spray painted those, works as well (not so neat in the inside).

So these are the 3D printed motor cover with PLA.

There are few millimetre of miss here and there, but in general it fits. Maybe in the next print I will trim down area that almost touches the belt.

Looks winterproof to me :) Did you also use extra sealant or something on the 3d printed parts that close off the drivetrain and motors? Or just clamped them in?

How many amps do you pull when going full throttle on that beast btw? Saw on Trampa's website the motors are rated 40a each.

45A motor, 45A Battery (if it can cope with it), regen -30A, battery min -20 to -30A (if your battery can cope with it)

Did you ended up loosing the trucks or tighten them to have more control at high speeds?

Yes turning is very hard, so I took 2 front dampas to make it easier to turn. Beware If you take out the dampas, it would be easier to fall at high speed. So yea there is upside and downside on this. I think I would like to take out the rear dampas too so take it easier to turn. I don't ride that high speed anyway.

According to me there aren't much different between belt drive / hub drive / direct drive. The hub drive is much faster, but you need sensored setup for that. The belt drive / direct drive is more torquey, but thats more to it. How it rides, it feels the same really. I experienced that hub drive might have issues with axle alignment if you hit something hard / manufactured improperly (I guess more on longboard instead of mountainboard). As for belt, it drives quiet silently, but I suppose helical gears would do as well. Gear drives would nice because it will not slip tooth and its easier to maintain. Why would I get direct drive would be the efficiency and maintainability. Yet one bonus of belt drive I think is there is slack / flexiness on the belt that makes more smoother rides.

wow Hubs are really faster you say, I am a electric bike maker and had both belt, chain and hub and i have to say that even in the electric bike world high voltage high power hubs are still king of the road. I feel like Hubs on a skateboard also need to get to about 60 to 70 volts nominal before they start taking of big time. Also there is a problem of thermal management, e.i Hub motors over heating DIY Ebikers solved this problem to a large extent by putting ferro fluid into the hub motor so the heat generated at the stator is transfered to the shell but because on the skateboard the shell is directly connected to the urethane, I don't know if it would be a good idea as the heat generated would cause the urethane to come of the hub.

The best wheel setup, the way i see it, would be to have a Hub motor inside a mountain board wheel that way the heat can dissipate along the rim

Yes I have to agree that hub is king, the simplicity and efficiency of the build is remarkable. Yet I also agree that more volts needed to reduce the amount of amps draw as amps = heat. I previously own an electric longboard with hub motors and its heating up big time on slopes and long coast. Urethane doesn't dissipate heat so well, so heat sink / fan is needed (Yet again since the hub is so close to the ground, having a fan is not really the best option).

Nevertheless eboard is different than ebike. I seriously doubt there is a person riding more than 1 hour on their board continuously in the same speed, hence the heat on those hubs are not insanely hot. Even if there are some people who are mad enough to ride the whole hour, the battery are too small compared to ebike battery so they'll end before its getting too hot. Hence the situation you're given technically by means unlikely to happen.

Hub motor is a nice addition to a Mountainboard build, however more often I see emountainboarders tends to go off road, although the wheels are pneumatics, the impact would still be quite hard. The amount of abuse you can do to an eboard is quite insane and hub motor will tend to broke more often if used vigorously.

From the various builds I did for electric longboard, I found that single large belt drive is the lightest, efficient, torquey and most cooleed operated electric longboard. Its just rocksolid good, the range is incredible and on top of that you can run sensorless. If you can go with planetary, thats better as belt you need to tension them and tension equal to friction = efficiency loss.

However lately I like dual small motor build as time to time traction matters and high speed riding is always better off with dual. On top of that I just like the simetry of the build.

Finally after long year of no update, I finally put some effort back in Fusion 360 as well as 3D Printing.
I have decided to add a nice back light (Meilan X5 Bike Backlight - Aliexpress). 

The design in Fusion 360

If you notice, I added a flat square piece for a license plate.
And this is the final result.

Don't ask me how I got it, but this is a legitimate road insurance plate :D
PS: If you notice, there are also 2 2.4GHz antenna mounted on the side for less interference!

By means of getting stopped by police, they normally stopped you because of not having road insurance. This provides that. However I am not sure if the type of mountainboard its applicable to the license I am having. So it's kind of grey.

This looks fantastic! My first drawing wasn't the best, but sufficient enough.

I have a New design as well that I didn't publish yet! It's equipped with an emergency belt bay where you can remove damaged belt without disassemble the whole motor mount. You still need to disassemble the whole mount to replace the belt, but it's good to continue riding to a safe and comfortable place to do the swap!.
