Ok so I’ve definitely caught the bug. And I’d say this will be my last board for awhile.

TB Dual 6355 190kv motor 
TB VESC
TB motor mount 
TB 218mm truck
16/40t pulley kit 15mm
280mm 15mm belts 
12s2p battery (Samsung 30q)
Nano remote (until photon gets here) 
97 abec 11 wheels 

Took it for a couple runs today and was actually really impressed in comparison to my dual 6374 board. Acceleration isn’t as crazy but the top end is definitely there. The esk8 calculator is pretty spot on but I got consistently 35mph with a peak of 37.8mph. I don’t even notice a difference in the 36t to 40t which is strange.

So what do you think of those wide track 218 trucks?
I'm running them on one of my builds and they feel really stable to me but I never go over 20 mph anymore.
Would you say they are an advantage for stability at higher speeds?

I apologize I never saw this, these trucks are ridiculously stable at high speeds. Almost too stable lol

TB 218 trucks are pretty stable at high speeds, running the diyeboard 6in airless with them with dual 6374 and manage to go 30+ and its still pretty stable.![Screenshot_20180424-151332_Video Player|243x500](upload://j5sPXc7hLyGMGSNCQssmeiTRENd.jpg)
