I have a Meepo Sanyo battery, 10s2p that I'm looking to put to use, but I really don't like the enclosures offered form Meepo and DIYEboard. Does anyone know if any of the Pschyotiller enclosures will work with this battery? Or if not where else I can get some enclosures that would fit maybe the battery + esc?

Appreciated!

Battery dimensions: (roughly)
 145mm length * 102mm width * 40mm thickness

That would be awesome, what kind of sketch are you thinking? 
The actual battery can be found here: https://meepoboard.com/products/sanyo-20700b-battery-pack-10s2p-custom-made

But I'll do anything i can to make this process easier

I'll try to conceptualize something by this evening

it’ll take a while and be a bit expensive since i’ll have to custom make the mold by hand. if it’s a relatively simple mold that I can do with a miter saw or tools like that it’ll be cheaper and quicker

Yeah I mean I don't need anything fancy, I really just want to get something smaller than the enclosures offered from diyeboard.com

I saw this enclosure from PsychoKiller, which is a good example of what I would need (minus the grooves, just a simple enclosure) but the dimensions are not compatible with my battery,

Looking for the same thing. I have two of these batteries, so really looking for a double enclosure.

We are currently working on a modular enclosure system 3D printed. 
It can be sized to fit any board and actually holds your battery and components in place
Thoughts?

The print guy has changed the material to add flex. 
Just so I don’t give the wrong info, I’m checking with him real quick. 
I do know I will have a prototype in hand for a better look mid week.
