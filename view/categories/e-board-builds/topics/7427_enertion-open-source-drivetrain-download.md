 A while ago I remember looking at the enertion site and he provided the download link for his open source drivetrain? Did any one use it? Also  if you have used this how was the outcome of the finished product ??

I've personally only seen it used three or four times, not sure how it worked out though. Seems sturdy enough.

I would love to use it , but I was wondering if it would be sturdy enough as other people usually weld there mounts onto there trucks

It is a bit complex to make by hand, easily done with a CNC. There are simpler versions out there (like mine) that get the job done, but don't look as good.
