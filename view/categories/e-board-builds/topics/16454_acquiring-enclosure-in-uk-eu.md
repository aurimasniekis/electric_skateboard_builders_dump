Hi, I'm in the process of building my first eSkate and the one part I'm having trouble sourcing is the enclosure. Does anyone know of how or where I might go about getting an enclosure for my board in the UK? I need something along the lines of these dimensions: Length: 40cm, Width: 15cm, Height: 5cm. 

Thanks in advance

The one @unik posted is a bit too small. My battery dimensions are Length: 305mm, Width: 135mm, Height: 39mm and I need a bit extra space for the vesc.
I already messaged @unik but if anyone has any additional suggestions that would be great too.

@Maxid  I have already checked esk8.de but theirs is also a bit too thin. I need at least 4cm in height but thanks for the headup anyway

With 4cm height you can use the infamous ikea cutlery tray for 99ct

That's a good one!! @r0ymanesco where are you located?
 I going to make one for me, for the same battery, in fibreglass. Maybe we can arrange something, I don't mind make anotherone. I will post a picture of the mold in a minute.

@Surfer When you say the same battery do you mean the one that's coming in from the EU group buy? Cuz that's the one I'm getting. I also need additional room for the vesc. I would be happy to arrange something with you if you can ship it to the UK with a reasonable price. Thank you for letting me know

That's the plan for the enclosure, the finish it will not be awesome or super shiny because i don't have vacuum pump, it will be laminated on top of this chunk of MDF with 3 layers of fiberglass and epoxi.
Actually this "mold" is for 3cm instead 4cm because i have the plan to remove the bms and used it only for charge. Anyway it will be easy to put 1 cm extra for your enclosure.
i'm in the Netherlands not sure of the shipping cost. i suppose around 15-17 euros.

@Surfer  Ok that looks really good. I would like to work with you. What's the current dimensions of the enclosure (length, width, height)? If you don't mind I would like mine to have an extra 1cm in height (making it 4cm). Also, how much should I pay you for making the enclosure? Thank you so much, you literally just saved me a lot of work.

The measures are 48x15x3cm or 4 for you.
If you pay the shipping and materials is fine, I'm not here to make money :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

```
@Surfer Ok, I can't read dutch but from what I can tell it's going to cost about 27 Euros in material plus whatever shipping is, am I correct? 
Also, apologies if I'm a bit demanding but could you make mine just a bit shorter?  45x15x4cm to be exact. I have a pintail deck so I'm afraid it could run into the motor and I think 15cm for the vesc and other electronics should be enough. Please correct me if I'm wrong and if it's too much trouble to make it shorter then just keep the original length, thanks.

hahaha well i would love it!! actually i was thinking to be the battery man since unfortunately i'm not working now and is so difficult to supply from china.
One point is that i'm in the netherlands really close to Nkon.
About the enclosures i have plenty experience with all kind of fibers, i was working 2 years in the north of spain making surfboards and also motorcycle parts in the spare time, but now I'm moved to Netherlands and no much tools here :cry:

If you have a CNC machine you could always cut the MDF, that something i have thought about doing to make enclosures but i just dont have a vacuum forming for carbon fiber.

But I have access to CNC in China
