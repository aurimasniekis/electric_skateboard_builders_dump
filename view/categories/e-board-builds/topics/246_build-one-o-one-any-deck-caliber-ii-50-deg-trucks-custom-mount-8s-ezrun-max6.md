Hi!

so to start of i'm 16 years old and don't know to much about electics I want to build a board and have done some research but I still want to know if my setup works or If there is anything I can change. As you might imagen I have a pretty tight budget and I basically just want a cool board to travel with. I have almost zero boarding skills but my tec teacher and father are good with electronics so they can help me build it and I have watched and read lot and lots on this forum. You guys are awesome! but yeah I just want to know if this setup works or I should change anything. Any comment welcome  

Here are the parts I plan to use 

Motor: 5065 Outrunner brushless motor 270KV 2000W 

Trucks: Caliber I 50 Deg Trucks (http://www.aliendrivesystems.com/store/p103/Single_5065_Motor_and_76mm-80mm_wheels_%28270%29-_longer_ratio_kit_for_higher_top_speed.html)

Tires: Orangatang 80mm Diameter wheels (http://www.aliendrivesystems.com/store/p103/Single_5065_Motor_and_76mm-80mm_wheels_%28270%29-_longer_ratio_kit_for_higher_top_speed.html)

Looks good! The only thing I see an issue with may be your choice of ESC. Not sure what they are charging but, you could do much better with the VESC or even Hobbywing with the Max 6 esc. Reliability is a factor and will double your cost on an ESC pretty quick.

I'm sure you didn't mean to put a link to a 30A ESC.
probably meant to put this link:

Right! The max6 is the new EZrun and it is 8s compatible..$160 I believe.

That 30amp esc wouldn't work.

Don't be scuuuurd!

Nice new EZRun Max6... About time they came out with something higher than 6S. Looks awesome.

And their 6s was rock solid with a built in BESC, power switch and really nice program software or a program card for mobile updates.

I try to say this to everyone i see on here who is just starting out: Don't forget the thread locker!

Good luck and congratulations on starting your new build! Soon you will wonder how the hell people can say they are living life and not ride a four-wheeled electric rocket stick into funville every day.

In order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds i am asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.

Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as 
**"new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb"** this becomes hard to keep track of.

I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;
**Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC**

Example
**The Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks |  R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC**
```
