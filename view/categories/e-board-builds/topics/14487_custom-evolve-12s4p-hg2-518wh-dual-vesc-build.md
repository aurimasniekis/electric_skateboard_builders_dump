Thought I would share my custom build. I bought a used evolve gen 2 deck on craigslist bought the evolve GT trucks and loaded it up with  custom battery, dual vesc, and 6355 motors. Had to make a motor mount for the 63mm motors.  Gearing is 13-38 with a 12mm belt but I have some 15mm belts and a 12t 15mm pulley on order.

This is awesome! If I can still call this an Evolve, this is the best Evolve board I've seen.

Why didn't the evolve motor mounts fit the 63 motors. I think they should work with 50 and 63 motors.

with the angle of the stock motor mount the 63mm motors would be rubbing on the deck at the tail, but you are correct they would have mounted up.

How far can you travel with your setup. I am trying to make the 50k mark.

not sure yet, need to do some more riding to determine the max range. I did do 20 miles riding all out but the batt wasn't fully charged and I can't remember the end voltage was. I just got the metr app going so I will fully charge and log it.

If you don't mind, can you share the clamp for the motor mount?

This is awesone, really like your battery work. I am modding the same model gen2 evolve but have not started the build yet. Debating whether to keep the evolve trucks, as have to rework mounts to fit dual rear drive like you did. Please let me know if you share how to recreate mounts you did.  Right now am temp building with @psychotiller wide trucks and MBS 100mm AT urethane wheels for fun but not a good permanent answer like yours!

Hello, You are shure that le 63XX moteor will feet on the original plate, and the only problem is the angle (i plan to do the same with another board) ? thanks

Hi I’m new here. Hoping to get in touch with op. Is it possible to dm people? I’ve got an Evolve Gen 2amd want to see if op does custom work for hire. Thanks

Hey just a quick update. A few of you asked me to e-mail you the cad file for the motor mount, I am currently redesigning a version that has an idler roller to keep the belt from slipping on hard braking and greatly reduce the wear on the motor pulley. Going to print my last revision tomorrow and test fit. I will post them both when after I verify fitment.

funny that you mention that. I just whipped this up last night :p <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/3843047d31a08fc76d935cf1b3e38a88544355e4.JPG" width="690" height="364"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/e/5e3d30b6c011a8228db9e7546285b58cdbe86025.JPG" width="690" height="364">

Not sure how well that design would work...

You may need to curve the idler slot so you can use the full range.  It looks like it would hit the pulley in that design.

I measured it, the pulley shouldn't hit. Curving the idler slot just moves the idler closer to the wheel pulley anyway. Made specifically for the AT setup pulley(66T so its rather large). But i think it should work for the street setup too. Also, with a 22mm bearing, that idler slot has PLENTY of range. 

I extended the length of the entire mount to make some extra room, so it's quite a bit longer than the standard evolve motor plate. 

I 3d printed a prototype last night, will post pics when i'm home from work.

```
Also designing my new mount for the 66t AT pulley, from memory my axel to idler distance is 71mm and puley to motor distance is 110mm. The mount is starting to getting pretty large but I had to extend it even more because the 63mm motor didn’t allow for enough space for the nut on the idler shaft.

Makes sense that the 63mm would cause some space issues. I was barely able to make it fit with the 50mm motors. At least the way the motors are mounted a little extra length isn't too much problem. 

Max dimensions on my 3d printer are 150mmx150mm, so i'm trying to keep it within those specs so I can print out prototypes and test.

Hey there! That board looks sick @oripaamoni!!! Great job! Is it possible to have the cad of the motor mount? I have an evolve gt carbon and I need more power to climb the hills, and the 50mm sucks, it gets hot too fast.. Cos I m quite new to this world, does anyone knows if I have to change the vESC as well if I change motors??
