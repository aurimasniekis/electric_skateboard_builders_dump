I really like this build, I want to do something with a trampa, bindings like that, and AT wheels ( it seems like evolve trucks are the way to go given the ability to swap between thane and AT), also want to go 12s4p but maybe with 20700 sanyo cells......

How is the flex on this style Trampa deck?

It's finally going though it's raining some can't really test yet! 

The Trampa deck is the 14 ply and once the battery case was bolted on is pretty stiff but still should take bumps and vibrations out of the feet.
