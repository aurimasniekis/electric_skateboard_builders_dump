Well my build has been finished for a few weeks now but I have been too lazy to make a build log so I'm finally getting around to it when I should be doing homework :wink:. **Warning: I took a ton of pictures during this build so be prepared. Also I took this pictures with my school laptop so sorry for bad quality and/or angles** You have been warned. 

This is my first build (as said in the title) and it originally started as the cheapest possible Esk8 I could build. Then as I kept reading I said well ok maybe I should buy a quality motor, then ok, I should buy a VESC, then ok I should go with 8s instead of 6s. As you can imagine, this raised the price quite a bit but the benefits outweigh the cost. Getting the funds for this board was tricky as well as high school freshman doesn't have very much money, I funded many of the parts myself but also got some of them for christmas (thanks mom and dad :joy:).

Here goes, enjoy:

It all started with a 12mm pulley shipment from enertion.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/a/cac58b623545196aed862c86f28822843e80994b.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Then lengthening one of the axels with a Dremel.

Then filing the truck down to a square shape for the clamp part of the mount.

I designed some 3d models (no real scale just a guess but it turned out ok, I used them as visuals) in a program called tinkercad and printed them off at my school.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/8/18646a1bd44d30951bb46d9b5e1750284b922ded.jpg" width="690" height="459">

The design was modeled after the Enertion mount, (the green peice was the same dimensions but the blue pieces were not.) you can see the green piece is on the wrong side here but this si just a mock up.

Then I got a block of aluminum and drew up the clamp part, I changed the design a little as you can see.

Then I used a hacksaw, files, and a drill to cut and shape the aluminum.

For the motor plate I used a thin sheet of 2 inch aluminum which my dad happened to have and it fit the dimensions of the motor plate perfectly. The aluminum sheet was 6 feet long which was very lucky as you will see later :wink:.

Then, exciting day! Got my motor from @JLabs! I would have gotten the 6374 but I couldn't shell out the extra $12 or whatever it is :joy:.

Key was too long so filed it down a bit.

First motor plate designs, decided to go with something like this for belt tensioning instead of the enertion method.

And we have belt tensioning!

Now to some paper models to get the right angle on the motor plate.

Switched to a design like this for more strength. And the collection of motor plate versions starts.... (you will see later)

Now to practice tapping some holes and finding the right drill bit and tap for the clamp to motor plate connection.

And now the hard part, aligning and drilling the clamping holes for the clamping part of the motor mount. Thanks dad for your help :joy:.

Broken tap, whoops! Was a pain to remove as it broke and half of it stayed in the hole. Vice grips to the rescue!

Using a small piece of wood I shaped to align the clamping parts so the holes will line up.

Now comes some more engineering parts, the 3 bolts that hold the motor plate to the clamping part I designed them to be in  a circle so that If I needed to change the angle it would be easier and I would just have to drill new holes along the circle instead of 3 new holes in random spots.

First version of the motor plate, not enough angle.

Then I made a paper model of my deck and sketched out where I though I was going to put everything with measurements for parts.

Second design, little more angle.

This has a good angle but not enough belt tension even at full tightness.

You can see the last and final version on the far left with the right angle and right tension. I made the angle so that even at full wheel bite, the motor would be just above hitting the deck so there is no way that the motor should ever hit the deck when carving.

"Countersunk" the bolt holes with a file so they wouldn't stick out and hit the wheel pulley.

Then the GT2B mod which you can see my full build log on that [here.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gt2b-mastercho-chozen-mod-full-length-tutorial-how-to/16005)

Then the start of the electronics, the anti spark loop and some other basic stuff. [This](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1OTONGWbgS9XbY82Uh9YTEgZYb8_zqEJVXfqQTjNvynY/edit) is what I thought my final digram would be... boy was I wrong. :slight_smile:.

Then I designed my final diagram, which you can see [here.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/195O4DXcDSLLYW2YiV5m6OA1Z2fsCO6ywJ2y-_ya_OXo/edit) The balance port and charge ports were carter connected to the MEB simple charging port for 4s. The mass of XT60 connectors in that diagram is just a parallel splitter like the one I made pictured below.

And my voltage meter and anti-spark setup.

My first enclosure out of a plastic case that happened to be the right size, I just duct taped it to the deck.

Everything in the case. You can see the balance and charge ports sticking out as I didn't have my MEB adaptors yet.

Now time to build a vacuum forming setup to make my enclosure.

Redid my anti spark key to make it a bit smaller.

So long story short I couldn't get my plastic hot enough with the setup in the first picture. (Heat gun + Hairdryer= not hot enough). I used my stove and didn't get it quite heated even enough so when I went to form it, only the top was able to form around the buck before it cooled. So my dad and I used a heat gun and went by hand to form the enclosure. My mom got nervous about the fumes so we ended up **breathing off of a scuba air tank forming an ABS enclosure with a heat gun and our hands in the middle of the kitchen!** Ahhh good times, good times :joy:. Anyways, that's why the enclosure turned out sub par :joy:.

Got some foam tape stuff I am going to use as a gasket as well as  makeshift gasket made out of a yoga mat.

No worries, you did good work.  

I would keep an eye on the motor plate, it might be a bit thin and could bend.  It's hard to tell from.pics.  Assuming it's 6011 aluminum it should be at least 5mm.

I like the vacuum forming rig, that's tougher than people think.

The motor mount will break soon, because aluminium threads are soft and would break fast caused of vibrations. its better to use stainless steel threaded sleeve and glue it in your mount.

Just got back from a ride while using a tracking app. I was surprised because my top speed was about 3 MPH higher than the [calculator](http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":8,"motor-kv":190,"system-efficiency":80,"motor-pulley-teeth":16,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":90}|) I used said it would be. The range was also more then I expected.

@Smorto  well I also get higher speed than the calculator says I would get.. I usually just adjust the efficiency a bit higher than it gives at stock.

Do you know how much charge went into your battery when you charged it?

That way you could calculate the actual consumtion at that speed..
```

## \#32 Posted by: Smorto Posted at: 2017-05-07T18:41:05.029Z Reads: 120

The battery should have been at 33.6 but I think it was more around 33.4 or 33.3.

@Smorto  mh, that does not really give much info to work with :D

Im not even sure what voltage system (8s - 10s) are u using and unless u know your exact capacity at that voltage level, it might be hard to tell the exact energy use..

U would just need to charge your battery with Imax B6 or a similar smart charger and tell what numbers you see there..

Then you can more or less estimate the average per mile consumtion, by dividing that ''capacity'' number by the miles you did..

I hope this is not super obvious for you as it could be and that you still got some ideas on how to measure it better.

I am using an 8s system as mentioned in my first post. My Imax charger shows 33.6V which is 4.2V per cell at 8S. I am not sure what other information you would need and to be honest, I don't quite understand what we are calculating here :joy:.

After chargeing it tells you how much energy (WH) it put back into the battery.
With that you can calculate the average real world power consumption per mile. 
Haveing this, you can get a better range estimate.

## \#36 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2017-05-07T19:48:48.890Z Reads: 124

What I wanted to point out.. is that you cannot always be 100% sure that you use 5000mah out of your battery pack..

One thing is what is written on the label and the second one is what really happens in real life.

I would say, you could sqeeze out around 4.6-4.8ah out of that pack.

Then at 8s nominal volts, you should get around:

**4.7ah x 29.6v = 139.12 Wh**
Then, by calculating **7.88 miles** you made, you would get around:
 **17.65 wh/mi**
or **10.96 wh/km**
At average speed of around **15mph** (14.77) / **23.77kmh**

--
I asked for numbers shown on charger screen,  because it can make a difference..

For example, if you do get 5ah out of your 2 serially connected 4s packs (8s total),
Then **total Wh** count of energy, would be more like:
**5 ah x 29.6v = 148 Wh**

So... almost half mile more added to the distance.
```

## \#37 Posted by: Smorto Posted at: 2017-05-07T19:56:28.928Z Reads: 114

I usually don't run my batteries down all the way to 3.2 so they are normally around 3.4 or 3.6 when I finish. The charger usually shows about 4300+ Mah when it is done. Thanks for that explanation though, it really helped me understand what you are calculating.
```

---
## \#38 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2017-05-07T19:59:28.556Z Reads: 121

```
Yeh, then with calculation you would now get:

4.3 ah x 29.6v = **127.29 Wh**

Then 7.88 miles

127.29 wh / 7.88 mi = **16.15 Wh / mi**

**10.03 Wh / km**

**@**

**15mph (14.77) / 23.77kmh**

---

So theoretically, you can safely still ''sqeeze'' almost or about 1 mile more out of the pack.

Sure, so I rigged my Imax B6 V2 with the other end of the Miami Electric Boards Charging Adaptor so that all I need to do is plug it into one of the charging ports on the board. Then the charger does all the work. You just set the charger to the chemistry of your pack (LiPo for me), the voltage of your pack (4s for me) and the amperage you want to charge at (5.0A for me which is 1c for my pack). Once one battery is done, I simply unplug it and charged he other battery with the other port.
