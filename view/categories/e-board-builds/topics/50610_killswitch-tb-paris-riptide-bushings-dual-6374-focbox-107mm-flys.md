_For now I want to post this just to get to the meat and potatoes that I am most proud of, the dual focbox heatsink stuff.. but i'll start from the beginning. This build is still in progress, awaiting focboxes, battery and controller._

**Background**
Been longboarding and downhilling for years.  You can read [my post in the intro section](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-member-introduce-yourself-here-tell-us-your-plan/216/1201?u=skatardude10) if you care about my background. A few weeks ago I came across a few kids in the neighborhood riding around boosted boards, meepos and e-gos. One of the kids let me ride his board, and I felt like a total creeper being much older than these kids, but the ride (although somewhat not super impressive) inspired me to follow through with building my own for the first time. This ride was the first time I have ever been on a motorized board of any kind, and ever since I started boarding 20+ years ago it's been something I have dreamed of. So!! Onward...

**Research and Newbie Expectations**
I originally [posted to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/816z0h/help_me_choose_monthly_march/dvpp2sw/) looking to spend about $350 for a kit to mount to one of my existing downhill boards to help me go 50+mph on flat ground, since I don't have many hills around my home to satisfy my downhill urges. I soon found out that was way out of line, found this awesome forum, started coming up with more realistic expectations, spending time learning about ESCs, VESCs, settings to use, voltages, power draw, etc. I watched a ton of youtube videos and build logs here, educated myself on erpm limits, vesc failures, more etc. At this point after a few days of solid reading and hours each day of research, I started parting my build out:

**Parts**
I ordered the parts before going on vacation for a week. Crazy how many different places to order from.

Ordered:
* Psychotiller X2 Cohron Dual Enclosure
* Torqueboards 218mm Trucks
* Chibattery 10s4p 25r
* Bunch of nuts and bolts, t-nuts, CAN cable, XT60-XT90 and vice versa connectors and adapters, bullet connectors 3.5mm and 5.5mm, neoprene foam padding and stripping
* Torqueboards Motor Mounts
* Varying length belts, 15mm
* Nano-X controller
* Focboxes
* BT module
* Torqueboards 6374 190kV motors
* Pulleys - 20t and 15t - 32 and 36t
* probably some other things I forgot...

Had on hand:
* Longboard Larry Stingray... won at a race in 2006, been my favorite board ever since
* Old 81a 90mm Flywheels
* Zealous Bearings
* Lots of bushings and other nic-nacs like riser pads, flat washers, etc that I have had forever and love
* Have a lot more random longboard crap on hand that I won't care to list out because it has no relevance to this build

After placing my orders I went to visit my family for a week. Returned home and some of the parts have arrived! I have spent the past few days piecing things together as parts continue to arrive:

I originally wanted to build on my Rayne Killswitch, drop through, etc. Stuff didn't exactly fit easily and I had some ideas for adding a radiator to my enclosure and figured it would be too low drop through with the rads, and I have a better top mount board that I love much more than this guy. but parts!!
![20180326_212859|690x388](upload://n3nvWLotnelZYV5aNuAP0dZPa8w.jpg)

So I got to working, gutting up my LBL Stingray, trusty old board to fit the parts I got in my living room.
![20180327_003351|281x500](upload://mIh9SKwSHryQQJqB69k1cQZ9gYl.jpg)

Got everything at this point mounted up and test placing the enclosures. I love the wide stance of these trucks! and the motors fit PERFECT with 15mm wide belt pulleys.
![20180329_165630|690x261](upload://aVOKIo55vJSenGYdID1hYlvRCYB.jpg)

Various belts, pulleys, etc came in from unikboards and johnny_261 (partially...), and later that night I got everything tightened down and one by one all nuts and bolts loctited with blue loctite:
![20180329_165526|558x500](upload://ykP170qCioLVgKt2dnJgTrAkScx.jpg)

So since the beginning doing my research, I knew I didn't want my focboxes closed up tight. I had an idea to use my 3D printer to facilitate an air-channel for heatsinks integrated into the enclosure. Originally I wanted to mount the focboxes to the deck but decided against it for the sake of space in the enclosure and increased airflow. I spent hours on digikey and mouser looking for just the right sized heatsink and found this guy that two of them can fit into the enclosure comfortably. They are sized just right for the focboxes, and are longer for more heat dissipation. I plan on mounting the focboxes to these guys with simple thermal paste and using foam padding to keep them snug in place on the sinks: 
![ATS-1109-C1-R0 (1)|500x500](upload://8IpcSZbefpnv4zTSpMHVnAuL7lW.jpg)

I was trying to think of the best way to do mount these and the focboxes inside the enclosure, and came up with this for the sake of vibration dampening, focboxes not mounted directly to the deck:
![20180329_165128|690x284](upload://rstg3R69sHux87u0fL5XFUAGGBG.jpg)![20180329_165148|475x500](upload://kTD2YdXmCUjSa0ly0LvU71XKGZ4.jpg)![20180329_165306|362x500](upload://eSIHM74Kze2FIxP1qC5zy2nPu7L.jpg)![20180329_165215|648x500](upload://nmEPPYWRrBXrJmAGe9LvONtBKwR.jpg)

I got to printing! And everything lines up just right with my cutout plot:
![20180328_194039|690x388](upload://6sezhaflCijRmkoIsThdHSJgKZE.jpg)

Sinks have arrived, and I turned my kitchen (for lack of a good workshop) into a cutting and fitting factory. Check out the mess:
![20180329_155226|690x388](upload://2LGqrkODSf178hmdp33AKY5oV08.jpg)

Sinks fit good with a little fin bending for the outer angled fins:
![20180329_164943|622x500](upload://xn5NyFlngiU1b2ep01gcAWw3ze5.jpg)

Finally, it's all mounted up and here's a few more glamor shots:
![20180329_164743|690x371](upload://qFDvCmAviwIjz5jYkmHb6SdKTkn.jpg)![20180329_164703|265x499](upload://rgDEkJ7vWvXf6wPHgW9wJ5qljbv.jpg)![20180329_164621|690x372](upload://bLilHSxfJvdHUnBy4YppZOm2QSO.jpg)![20180329_164826|690x324](upload://eNGySSjArTUw8j98NdHZSyQmjaq.jpg)![20180329_164532|689x403](upload://5zNm2JuhU8NdsAL33QUM5WPHWB2.jpg)![20180329_164555|690x400](upload://e3LGeUOjYIiXS6HdADyNXGtjmRn.jpg)![20180329_164901|436x500](upload://plKSSJoQ0hiIzdvrWcOEgTTPIL3.jpg)![20180329_164920|468x500](upload://3Q21oFaUHwFaFbw5zhsKOnRDITp.jpg)

At this point, the focboxes and controller have shipped, but I have not got them yet to start cutting holes for the motor and sensor wires yet, and I am still waiting on bolts, t-nuts, and foam padding from amazon to arrive to start getting the enclosures mounted: 
![order1|305x500](upload://iyzxrR30aXAxsacpbnK7j5YAD0Y.PNG)

Amazon order came it. Sealed up under the enclosures, it's almost air tight at this point with the battery enclosure on. Got The nuts and m4 screws to bolt it all down installed, and a fresh coat of viscious grip tape.  I trimmed down the vesc enclosure a bit to leave much more room for the motor wires to do their thing without any stress. 

Still need to get battery and focboxes installed with foam to hold everything in place properly, cut wire channels in the foam and enclosures, mount the power switch / LCD display / charge port, water resistant seal some random small gaps and cracks, and program everything.

Making progress on the cable management channel. Making a riser with shapes to quell the rest of the mess right now.

Here's my first prototype in TPU:
![20180405_233649|690x388](upload://rcN0OQrPiY7zHjHB5Q0WrXHsq0S.jpg)![20180405_233644|690x388](upload://5jwyyA21dNrbSaqqVUEOssQqurG.jpg)

I knew the TPU wasn't going to work so I went with a hard clamshell design next:

I'll update later with the riser... Hopefully it fits, it's angled -2.5 degrees for a tad bit more stability at speed.

Well done and well written write up! I love the innovative focbox air cooling channels. And nice risers. Where'd you get those cool blue pulleys? They look big, 20T? 

Thanks for taking the time to do your homework.

Here's a preview of the riser with cable channels:

I double sided taped the cable manager to the deck, and got the riser on! Takes of the wires wanting to fall down towards the motors for sure. I need to swap out for slightly longer hardware and lift the truck up some more or angle the motors a bit more towards the road because when turning hard, the motor mounts contact the wires in the cable manager and I don't want them getting torn to shreds when I'm shredding... You will see how close it gets when turning the truck hard in the fifth picture below:

![20180407_133918|690x388](upload://yp0MEcrLQBBpLKfMQphdLxeaEg2.jpg)![20180407_133729|690x388](upload://f0i2k18YtjInx6Sp1ZcIR2IY2cB.jpg)![20180407_133710|690x388](upload://3rNSSpZovdwNw7W0pgEJHIg53Gz.jpg)![20180407_133628|690x388](upload://hswCTQT5g7rK7Uq6FBU5AeOjQU9.jpg)![20180407_134214|690x388](upload://cG1Gv6zGOU7ZbQElEYzqioaEoFJ.jpg)![20180407_133807|690x388](upload://cxGsAmpYcMJp1p1VVtdDdrG1auG.jpg)![20180407_133648|690x388](upload://pnfD9gOUvLFyIzoQtb9HUHjBlIv.jpg)

Next up is setting up Passthrough USB panel mounts on the side of the vesc enclosure to make programming easy. I printed out these little TPU based dust blockers to stop road grime from gumming up the ports on the outside of the board... They fit perfect, snug but not too snug and flexible! 

![20180407_134547|690x388](upload://pZjOAUcCES9iC7ZrVJP4gIYMyiQ.jpg)

After that, foam filling some of the gaps between enclosures and wire channels to seal it up a bit more, some more hot glue sealing smaller gaps, padding and installing the battery and finally blue loctiting the few things that haven't been loctited yet like the enclosure screws and cable manager bolts.

Today:

* Installed external panel USB connectors with Red (master) and Green (slave) dust covers and sealed gaps
* Applied more thermal paste to focboxes where it was lacking
* Further taped and hot glued components such as Controller receiver, canbus connector cable, Bluetooth module
* Shileded some very small exposed connections to be extra super safe with more electrical tape
* Applied more blue locktite to enclosure bolts and USB panel bolts
* My car cellphone mount somehow fits perfectly on my helmet with a flat plate on the inside so it's not even really poking past the inside of the shell. Great! Hopefully will make for a good maiden voyage first person video.

I'm thinking about printing pulley covers at some point. Also thinking about maybe printing a USB cover to flap over the whole thing with some sort of spring mechanism to further prevent dust ingress even around the dust covers, further protect the connections incase one of the inserts happen to come loose, and to make it look more professional... I think the drill holes are a tad bit unsightly.

I've got a JimZ (what do you call it) double barrel (fat wide one with inner regular barrel size) on the bottom (baseplate side) of the rear truck with the same shape but softer venom on top... With standard venom barrels on the front, red on bottom and yellow on top. I forget what formula, I got them a long time ago. The ones on the front are high rebound and rear ones are just medium rebound... Flat extra wide nylon washers on bottoms and regular sized metal flat washers on top

Really cool design. Haven’t seen heatsinks like that in a diy before. But my question is what makes you think you need that?

10s4p means 80a max total, that’s 40 amp per focbox. And the focbox can already do that without any extra heat sink. On top of that, those motors might not even be able to do too much more than that, even if you increased the battery output.

Not trying to put you down or anything. It’s a cool design. Just trying to gauge where your coming from with that heat sink.

I guess overkill cooling? I don't mind if it's a bit overkill 😎 

I did a bunch of research on gear ratios and came to the conclusion that running 1.6:1 or 1.8:1 and attempting to climb hills means a lot of amps drawn and heat buildup in the vescs. I want to make 100% sure that my VESCs don't die from heat if I try to climb hills my gearing can't handle and end up pulling too many amps. 

Although 40A max each, your right. I'd rather just overbuild regardless... And I wanted it to look awesome while serving the purpose of what otherwise would have been some holes drilled in the enclosure for a tiny bit of airflow.

Maybe consider using a lipo? Since your gear ratio is geared so much towards speed, your torque won't be that great on hills at 40 amps each. You need more amps than a lower gear ratio to get torque. And going up in battery size isn't always an option. But with a lipo about the same size, you could easily do 160-240 amps total, or 80 amps - 120 amps per focbox/motor. Then you can really test the heat sinks (they will totally be needed).

If you have the bucks, you could also try both setups and make it so they could be easily swapped out so you can compare first hand the difference :P

In the interest of better maneuverability, stability, and almost reducing slop completely on my TB218 trucks, I realized there were some things I could improve upon. 

Originally when turning on my trucks (in the living room on carpet), they felt sloppy and would pop quite a bit if I wiggle around center weight without really turning the trucks at all. I know this is not good for stability at speed and really doesn't help with control at all... slop that is:

1. I noticed that the inner diameter on my bushings is larger than my kingpin diameter by quite a lot. combine this with flat washers that don't adequately hold the bushings centered around the kingpin is no no no good.

* To keep the bushings perfectly centered but not get torn up like metal tends to do, I printed out some very snug precision cups out of Nylon. They flex just right in contact with the hanger when turning hard... great!  They are so snug on the kingpin I have to screw them on. Even better! I am not putting these on the rear trucks, just sticking with double barrels and flat washers, because I don't need rebound in the rear for stability... I need dampening back there. Anyways, check it out:

![Skateboard Improvements v6|690x376](upload://eJ0reICPmPMEQ6ZTTNyiQf3XN3V.jpg)
![20180409_212730|500x281](upload://5J4G6PHRn2K7Eqhr7YnSxZOA60i.jpg)![20180409_212747|690x388](upload://caKT4NSozfDY9Ot5YkUW8dYCSom.jpg)

2.  Surf Keyz on Surf Rodz are awesome. They are like spherical bearings on precisions, but they are cheap and simple plastic bits that fit snug between your hanger and kingpin to keep everything nice and perfectly centered.

* So, I wanted to apply the Surf Keyz idea to Caliber style / my TB 218 trucks! 

* Nylon is also a great material for this... it's super durable, semi pliable, and super slippery... you don't want some little keys messing up your carves. They fit super snug on the kingpin almost to the point where it's difficult to screw them on... use a flat washer and screw it down there to seat it in. The nylon stretches out as you push it on to make a great fit into the hangars.

* Has anyone else tried making their own keys/spherical bearing type things for your trucks? let me know... interested to see your solutions to the slop issue...

* If anyone wants to download these, [here you go](https://a360.co/2qohfhU) for the cups and keys, and [here's](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2855766) just the keys on thingiverse. Anyways, enough talking. Check it out:

* **here's a video of these Caliber keys in action**, you can see how much slop they reduce... at the end of the video, keep in mind I am on carpet and these things are still keeping the trucks turning great with little effort:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuKwQSMkZ4Y

4. Finally, I tried making some pulley covers to go over my 20T pulleys... they are still too small and rubbed the belt a bit, so I tore them up to see how durable they were- they were pretty strong, but I am not sure if I like the look or really even believe in the function of pulley covers, so I might just leave them off and forget the idea. Here's a CAD look I guess:

On Wednesday i'll get the thing on the road and let you know... 

In the meantime, keys on my Surf Rodz (if you haven't tried them) really only help - a *ton* - with really sharp turns. 

The TB 218 trucks actually have quite a bit of depth/spacing between each side of the bushing seats. That was the one thing I was worried about before starting this little side project was that the distance looked too thin, leading me to think that they would pop out and get stuck outside the kingpin cutout between the bushings and mess things up...

*But*, the center hole is about 4 - 4.5mm deep... plenty thick enough to fit a key in, _and keep it there_. For reference, my surf-keyz are about the same thickness, maybe even less- and they stay put 100% of the time I ride, never messing things up for me.

I also think that if anything the perfectly circular shape of the cutout helps the centers of these keys to pivot just right in there, keeping them snug. This is also the reason I made the edges rounded, based off the diameter of the circular cutout in the hangar.

So... to answer your question: I anticipate these making sharp turns much easier, requiring less lean since the basic idea is that less of your lean goes to slop and more to turn, and surf-keyz on surf rodz work AMAZING serving this purpose on my other boards.

I'd call this one a success. ![20180411_154042|690x388](upload://dDAVy6y0tUjMevVUGXJBRXVcv2w.jpg)![20180411_182047|690x388](upload://wMQzObwN4vWiztJRqGYCq1dcpqA.jpg)

I set everything up just right the first time. One wheel was going backwards, decided to reconnect and reverse it. Forgot to read. Borked settings and one motor would stutter on the bench. Re-ran detection and all is well now. Just need to reset Bluetooth stuff to get the app working again, borked that too when I didn't read before editing.

And my jeebers!!!! I need to increase the brake force. All padded, slide pucked and helmeted up, this thing goes *fast*!!! Just as fast as I want it to. I haven't pushed it to the max, only had 25% charge. But man is 1440W to each wheel a doozie. Charging it now. Anyways, shaky right now, but that brake force. It coasts slowly going slower when braking, which is better than I'm used to- I had to foot brake a couple times I didn't anticipate 100ft in time.

SO much funnnnnn!!!!!!!! AHHHHH!!!! The insert keys seem to do a great job, this is the most responsive and controllable board I have now, analogue included.

Thanks SO much @barajabali, @johnny_261, @onloop, @torqueboards, and @psychotiller, and a couple more people I can't remember off the top of my head. I'm in love now!

Hopefully I'll post a video soon when I get the app up again. Oh yeah, @Ackmaniac thanks for the amazing firmware edits and vedder of course too 😎

Wife had me doing chores - didn't get to get it fully setup until night but I had to try it out. Stats froze, I am pretty sure it's because my wifi cut out for some reason... i'll disable wifi for next time to see if it's just me disconnecting that froze the stats:

Data Graph stuff I made from today:  [link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Tvyri5IWBFlIHsm9j4Pwp32BJnROd2Bx)

And below is a video of my first real ride with the board, now I realize the settings were pushed a little bit high. Thanks to community members noting the amp draw and voltage drop, I have gone from 40A per vesc in this video to now 30A max batt per vesc, and my battery seems much happier now, as you can see in the graph linked above. Even at 30A per vesc and gearing changed to 20/36, it's still plenty powerful and plenty fast for me. Anyways, heres the video..

Big crack took him out. He will be missed. I'll keep this thread and update with whatever board the electronics end up going on next- probably the demonseed that's been getting no love lately.

Had I stuck with -24A I was testing out today instead of going back to -16A mid ride... No regrets though. Haven't felt the thrill of roadrash in years, thankfully I had slide gloves and kneepads, only got a minor football sized scuff on my hips and elbows.

Sorry for your loss. Must of been his time. Must of been a HUGE crack. 

More pics of the carnage? 

E-skate can be pretty harsh on the deck, the drop through's are more prone to cracking. Unless they are super thick, having a top reinforcing plate helps too.

Yeah, and I knew about the crack too, I should have anticipated it. Regardless... Purging the weak- the demonseed is *thick*, bamboo, and fiberglass reinforced too so I'll trust that even though it's drop through.

Cleaned up the carpet, got everything transferred over. Between the fiberglass and bamboo deck and heaps upon heaps of soft risers, the ride is a million times smoother now, and the long platform to stand on is wonderful. Going to make a few small adjustments to the mounts and add some extra dampening, but beyond this I think I'm done.

Changing things up a bit now. 

First of all, after shorting and replacing my charge port, i've upgraded from my 81a 90mm flywheels to some black superflys. For [$114](https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/abec-11-superfly-black-longboard-skateboard-wheels-107mm-74a-set-of-4) these things were a steal compared to other offerings on the market. Link incase anyone was wondering... thanks to someone else who posted this link in the forums elsewhere. I almost ate shit during some high speed carving on the fresh shiny thane- these needed some hard breaking in before they got predictable... so I took them out for quite a bit of hard controlled carving, drifting and light sliding to get them worn in the second afternoon out on them.

Second change i've made was to get rid of all those soft risers. The front riser is printing right now as I type this, both in nylon. I drew this up to fit snug inside the drop-through cutout... these things are rock solid, hefty, and have a tiny bit of flex when tightened down to take on the curve of the deck just right. They have about 7mm of floor all the way around the cutout to rest the weight on the bottom of the deck evenly, instead of the small contact points of trucks alone or the old risers I had on that would flex into the cutouts. Tomorrow I plan on riding up to the fabric store up the street to grab a couple $$ worth of black dye, to dye these to match the rest of the board... deep black!

![Demonseed_Risers_2018-May-28_08-55-23AM-000_CustomizedView13549200799_png|690x388](upload://hTIAo2MRIrh5AjDSSbMmODOOjM2.jpg)![20180528_024058|690x388](upload://9S47w5LYD9XBWcK6EI5GhSobhu5.jpg)![20180528_024112|690x388](upload://ufLVbtTVWfJQh2By7y3aQaBA6Fc.jpg)![20180528_024149|281x500](upload://sH3pBllDzpMtNiSXdXljk0fWKGI.jpg)

Next... this board is heavy as hell. I couldn't stand carrying it by the trucks or nose, or fumbling around with it like a normal longboard. So I made some handles... also printed in nylon (sturdy as hell), and plan on dying these black with the other parts tomorrow. This thing works wonders... balanced just right: 

![20180525_141648-COLLAGE|500x500](upload://geenvKMdsNndXu22i0PbDIIY90f.jpg)![20180528_024046|690x388](upload://jMzGWrp1EO6t9BcGpVKXQ1CeAND.jpg)

Another minor improvement... I got my belts perfectly aligned thanks to some ABS spacers, that add 4mm of space between the flywheel hubs and the start of the wheel pulley. They are indented just right to cup the wheel pulley to center. You can see them a bit here in green: 

![20180528_024125|690x388](upload://uMMx51veli9xk2oERnonIXRVoyk.jpg)

Well... this one is coming along nicely, and it will probably continue to evolve more from here. Riptide 100a pivot cups are on their way, a needed pair with the nylon riser attempt to reduce all slop. Griptape needs replacing, it is some old viscous tape that's literally double-sided-taped to the deck because it was coming loose. I decided to keep my 1.6:1 gearing (20/32) on the 107s, and now 45mph is easy. Here's a quickie pass of a friend going full speed on his evolve: https://youtu.be/WgJXWn-yJLE?t=430

Horray, more changes- dyed all my nylon parts: precision washers, risers, handle. Only thing was that the front nylon riser warped off the bed, and I was nearly out of filament so I stopped it right after a few layers filled in the outer edge that interfaces with the deck- instead i'm stacked khiro wedges ontop of the partially complete nylon insert, and these things are solid... just as I had intended for the nylon riser to begin with so i'm happy.

Riding without soft risers reminds me how agile and responsive a board can be, it's amazing... Things aren't *as* buttery smooth now... but I feel super stable at speed unlike before without the wedge and soft risers taking away all my control.

I love how the black drop-through insert portions interface with the top of the deck. I really hated the bottom mount on a drop-through look. While it's not aesthetically perfect, it's aesthetically *good enough* for me.

Question, I keep getting ABS over current faults. Before I dig in, what should I be looking for exactly? On each vesc I am running:

Motor Max 70
Motor Min -70
Batt Max 30
Batt Min -10
Sensored FOC
10S4P 25r

The board never cuts out during faults that I can tell, I may have gotten 2 or 3 of these errors in the app over the past two weeks of almost daily riding... The most recent fault happened at 0 RPM, 0 duty cycle. The other fault that happened a week or two ago I thought was due to too high motor Max and min, since according to the logs it happened during breaking, but no vesc cutout. So, those got turned down from 80/-80 to where I'm at now, but it must be something else, since logs say I wasn't moving when this happened. 

I have a few adapters between my battery and VESCs... Could adding capacitors between my VESCs and battery help? Dunno how I'd fit them, since I've used nearly all my space in my enclosures, but I'd consider figuring something out if caps would help with this. Does anyone add caps between VESCs and motors? It'd be easier to adapt caps on the extensions that run from my VESCs to my motors in a 3D printed enclosure mounted to the rear. ... ?

Finally, if this issue really isn't giving me much trouble, is it common to get a few ABS over current faults occasionally... And should I be worried?

I got to ACE hardware right as the gate was closing tonight, so I kajiggered some idler bearings onto my torqueboards mounts with what I had laying around. I got some skipping on 15/32 gearing without idlers, can't wait to try these out...

Do you guys think these belts are too tight? Think the M4 bolts will hold up over time?

https://youtu.be/tJkpAZvOunc

With m4 bolts tightened down hard to stay straight, motors slid as far toward the hangar as possible with the m4 socket head in the way, and 265mm belts, this is as loose as I could get the belts. If they need to be looser, I'll go ahead and file down the socket head to make room for more slack. Here's some more pics:

[/quote]

Look a bit tight to me, one of the main advantages of idler is to have looser belts. Doesnt look like you have many options to adjust the tension though, I would try with smaller bearings if you have them on hand. 

I think the M4 bolt will be good if its a high grade one. 

What are those spacers you have on the wheel pullies?

Hey, yeah it was a bit tight for sure. Today riding around, I could see wear on the outside of the belts within a few minutes. I pretty much rode to the hardware store, grabbed a metal file, came right home, and filed down the bolt heads a bit so the motors could slide back a tad to allow more slack in the belts. 

I think it's much better now, the belts are flexy when pressed, and I could go even a tad looser, but I'm going to try the in-between tightish to loose tension for now.

Based off of [this thread,](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mitigating-death-wobble-the-implementation-of-an-adjustable-steering-damper-in-an-electric-mountainboard/59066) I ordered one of [these guys.](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/Damper-Steering-StabilizerLinear-Reversed-Safety-Control-for-Suzuki-GSXR-GSX-R-600-750-1000-1300-Yamaha/32791821784.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.32cf63c0Fq6n5b) Well, it's in the country now and I feel the pressure to come up with a suitable mount for the thing. 

I will be the first to admit, this is not pretty, and I do not like it. The final design will only be printed when I am happy with it looking nice, but first and foremost it has to be primarily functional over everything else. So if for some crazy reason I can't make it functional and pretty at the same time (not likely), I will 100% prioritize functionality and durability first.

Assuming I am going to be using M8 socket screws or something of the like for the sphericals. I plan on using spacers between each side of the sphericals, a clamp mechanism of some sort for the hangar portion, a screw on extension thing for the outside of the wheel that I can bolt the mount onto from the outside, and bolt the damper to the mount with spacers mentioned before. 

This is just a really *really* rough concept of how I kind-of plan on laying it out. I tried all manner of simpler mounting, but it just won't work with the board in most of the other possible orientations, or at least this seems like the cleanest, and strongest way so that the damper is out of the way of my feet and adjustment knob still easily accessible. Wish me luck... when I have the damper in the next few days i'll be going out to grab suitable hardware, and draw up the final design with measurements based off the hardware I get and test fitting the physical damper to my actual board rather than a drawing. 

I plan on printing it in nylon (I love this stuff) and dying it black to match everything else.

![dampener%20concept%20mount|662x500](upload://uCAoD2gEpLO3S34cNwLW8RifhVP.jpg)

Some other updates to the board, I removed the green printed cable router. It was taking up too much space that I used to dewedge the rear truck with a randal 35 base/wedges down to 25 degrees. Stability is great now, but doing this because I want more stability if possible! I don't want any twitches if i'm riding with traffic at 45, save for a stray boulder or pothole, you know. 

I've also done away with the idlers... they were nice, but I shredded 2 belts just braking gently over the course of a few days. I've also swapped gearing to 20/36, and plan on swapping back to 20/32 potentially if the damper works for making the thing feel even more crazy stable than it already is so I can get back up to the 48-50mph speed.

Ah! Also swapped rear bushings to dual riptide 93a WFB chubbies, and dual 90a WFB barrels in the front. These are some solid bushings. Still great lean, but just more stability compared to my old venoms. :-)

Ah! *x2, also swapped all my cups for flat washers... trying to reduce rebound as much as possible and this worked wonders for doing just that, and again, further improving stability. I think all my instability at speed is just purely fear from the crash I had a few weeks back... still getting my nerves chilled from that one. Every time i've felt out of control since the wreck has been 100% mental. gotta get past that mental block. Gotta get back to that feeling I had before, but with all the additional confidence in the performance and stability improvements this thing has compared to how it was setup before. we will see....

Well. I had a few hiccups. The hangar mount portion was way too small. Had to file it down quite a bit to squeeze it over the hangar. *Plus*, it's on the wrong side. A few holes were very tight, as I forgot to add an extra .2mm space in a couple spots.... Besides all that, everything fits together perfect- it's so tight and solid at this point. 

I'm re-printing the hangar clamp portion with a bit extra space carved out so it can fit tight but not too tight without any filing to fit, and mirrored so it's on the side I intended it to be on. Once that's done I'll hook up the board mount portion and screw it all down. 

The range of motion seems just right, if not maybe a tad bit restrictive, but it looks like it's going to work well.

I'll update later on when this mirrored hangar mount finishes and everything is properly bolted up.

I intend to use a shorter screw on the hangar mount, but for now this was the only way I could clamp it together, had to use a much longer screw to capture the nut because everything had to bend out so much due to the hangar cutout being too small.

I am way too happy with how this turned out. It doesn't have any effect on the feel of the ride on low, but can limit the speed of your turn as easy as turning a knob, literally. Ahhhhh!!! Ah yiiiiiissssss mmm and I think the black dye really helped!

On the carpet I can't tell any difference on low other than when turning the damping up high, feels like it will be very stable. I'll update in about an hour, taking it on a grocery run now to try it out.

I'll be honest, I've only rode a mile and a half and I can tell this is going to take some getting used to. 

With the damper turned all the way down, it *almost* feels normal. The board is responsive, but not nearly as much so as without the damper: almost like there is 2% lag. It's still 100% rideable and 99.5% controllable. 

Once you start turning the knob, it almost feels less stable for two reasons: the rear is not dampened. Even though I'm running chubbies and 25 degree rears, it feels like I have the feeling of being unstable, just because I am used to a looser rear being more unstable, but when riding that's not the case, it's just not an intuitively stable feeling, even though it's really hard (impossible) to induce instability/wobbles if I try. Secondly, because the front truck has the opposite of rebound when the damper knob is turned to high, it's almost like the board has a mind of its own. It will tend to feel like it's wanting to go the direction you were going before, which throws my mind off. It doesn't give with the foot feeling / second hand nature of skateboarding I've built up my whole life. It doesn't mean it's bad, it's just not something I anticipate... It doesn't feel 'natural'. 

None of this is to say "bad" though, I am just going to have to re-learn a bit like when you first hop on a freeboard or onewheel- you don't exactly know what to expect, and you have to take time to get the feel for it. 

Thankfully it feels great turned all the way down and still makes the board feel much more stable still. I will probably ride it all the way down, *for now*, turning up the notch by one every few rides to gradually work my way into "*feeling it*"

P.s: cracks, bumps, uneven pavement seems just fine... The board tends to just roll straight over everything, lol, which is different too.

Okay, confession time: I don't like it. I feel much more unstable with the front being so "stable". I will be taking it off and trying a design on the rear instead. I could definitely use more resistance in the rear with so much leverage on the 25 degree plates. Having the front be able to turn how you need when you need it just makes so much sense for stability, and this doesn't have it. I can 100% see this making a **useful** *difference* in the rear as opposed to just **being** *different*, and thus unpredictable *feeling* on the front, when I should have turn as quickly and suddenly as I need it for both minor and major adjustments to course.

I chalk this one up to a failure, *for now*. More to come.

**TLDR:** *Do this to the rear, not the front...*

V2 is officially online. I am in *love*. So glad I took the time to get this bolted up... My rear *was* very twitchy in the very slight lean department, it held center great, but not strong when right on center. This guy on the rear fixes that. 

**AND MY AGILITY IS BACK!** It's so easy to ride now, *absolutely confidence inspiring* at speed, 110% controllable, doesn't feel like I'm riding a flying stick anymore...

I think that the holding it's line more works very well in the rear. The mounts themselves give a little bit, so there is still a tiny bit of center twitch, but only as much as the mounts give. I kindof like that feeling, but I'm also considering a V2.5 that stiffens up the play a bit more to try it out. I didn't have long enough m5 pan-head screws to torque down the lower part of the mount onto the motor mount hangar clamp, so I will be getting two longer bolts to take care of that, but it's such a tight screw in fit at the moment that I'm pretty sure even with all the stress of turning on it constantly, that it won't break free between now and when I decide to get longer bolts. 

I also added some TPU flexible dampeners to keep the damper itself centered, and to help with some of the vibrations. Lovely kobucha beer run tonight 😎.

To summarize, I think I'll be planning on doing this to all my high speed boards. It deadens the rear so much more, that with a lively front end, it just feels like cruising in heaven compared to *just* 25 degree plates and hard chubbies.

Stable as heck up to 40mph. I am starting to consider gearing back to 20/32 now. 

Eight clicks from full loose out of 20 clicks total... My foot got the tense wobz when blinded by some high beams on a downhill, and the damper kept me on course 100% as opposed to normally getting a *bit* tad bitty squirly when getting the tense wobs.

I think i'll take some time with 20/36, *for now*, until I feel the urge to push higher than 40mph more often.

Oh and V2.5, quite more effective with the damping due to rigidity of the new mounts. I am a happy man. Time to rest.

I still noticed some 'play' or give in the v2.5 mount on the top... So I decided to really clamp the protruding/offending portion down to the deck tonight with a bolt on rigidity enhancer/'stiffener' that clips around the deck, bolts to the deck, and press fits over the existing mount so it basically cannot have any play anymore.

Well, now there is no play there, but there is still some small give in the motor mount clamp side of the mount. Going to work on a beefed up (even further) version of that soon.

Fixed the motor clamp side of things now. I cannot see any more play. I added a third screw hole on the mount for a grub screw to screw into the motor clamp, seems this adds a noticeable amount of extra rigidity along with the raw thickness.

Oh yeehaw. Oh jeez. I can really feel the damper now. Feels like normal with the damper turned down, and wow... with literally almost zero play in the system now, when the damper is turned up high it feels so *interesting*.  The fact that I can just turn up or down the rear truck responsiveness with a clicky knob... Still in love.

Pics now... Need to grab some even longer m5 pan heads to fully thread the nylocks.

Thanks boss. No, unfortunately, the whole range of motion is used by the damper and all of it's needed. I was considering tucking it under the board instead but since it's also dewedged to 25 degrees I wouldn't get the full range of motion/less damping/much more complicated mounting. It would be out of the way at least, but as it is now on this deck even it's pretty much out of the way as long as you are aware it's there. Loving riding it so far.

Also quick update for the thread, finally replaced the m5x30mm bolts with m5x35mm to hold the clamp side of the mounts on tight. So far up to 43mph and a week or so of riding I haven't got any instability yet.

Some new thoughts on going over rough/uneven terrain... Such as odd dips in pavement and the like... Unlike a regular setup, the damper almost makes it feel *floaty* over the uneven terrain... Kindof an odd feeling, not uncontrollable floaty, almost like a controllable type floatieness as opposed to just sending it and letting the board go where it will go while navigating uneven terrain on a regular setup.

Cool stuff.. I wonder what versions mountainboards could use of these dampeners..

Looks like u have put a lot of work into this to make it work on a longboard.. Congrats for that.

Not sure what else to add.. Still a bit amazed that someone (like you @skatardude10) has devoted the time to sit and craft this out..

It might be that with this new steering system doesnt have to be invented to make the ride stable and predictable :slight_smile:

Anyways.. Thanks for inspiration.. If I do come up with a need to go faster in future, I will definitely look into this and how to make it work. Seems really worth the effort.

I wanted to update this thread though because of the gears I've recently printed and installed. Nylon motor gears and PETG wheel gears.

Here's a video of them in action... 

https://youtu.be/vFstbELgDCo

As you can tell, there is some noise. It sounds like a spur gear setup to me though, not much louder. They are heavily Teflon lubed, and after quite the distance riding, the gears are still cool to the touch... They are so far holding up great. Also, if they get dirty they tend to clean themselves up nicely upon accelerating for a bit 😎

To deal with the noise and change up the gear ratio a tad for more speed I've designed some herringbone gears to try next- the PETG wheel herringbones are on the printer right now... Here's the nylon motor gears... They mesh so damn smooth, mmmm!!

Welp, got the Herring-Bones on there!

and my golly-jee whillickers bobby, are they quiet. 

Here's a video comparison of spur vs the herring-bones gears: http://youtubedoubler.com/pOem ... I'd play one at a time... maybe this is obvious.

//__this is a rant__//
I have a feeling there is the idea that 3d printed parts are not *all that* viable. I would say, so far... being that most of my build is 3d printed, I have ran 3d printed wheel pulleys and now the nylon motor pulleys I have been running that have shown minimal wear and arguably have held up in time better than my aluminum belt pulleys, that all-in-all I feel like 3d printed parts (to include motor pulleys in nylon) are *totally* viable. This is literally sex... well, okay, maybe not that good... but to be able to change gear ratios in less than 24 hours with a few re-prints... for a geared drive, to not have to spend hundreds of doll-hairs on metal gear systems...  a bit of fusion, cura, and waiting... golly jee whillickers.
//__end rant__//

Anyways, the speed is just right for me now at 16/46 gear ratio... max out around 35-38mph. And, I don't have any video or audio to check but I do feel like the herringbone gears are even quieter than my belt setup... not to mention the instant torque and insanely awesome free-roll being some other huge positives in favor of gear vs my old belt setup. Things are really staring to look more and more perfect as time goes on. God... what else can an eskate be these days, huh? anyone got any other good ideas? please hit me up...

They look very well done and the prints came out really well from what I can see. Its great that you can make more complex gears like herringbone through these more inexpensive materials.

I was expecting the rant part to comprise of list of points explaining why it wouldn’t be viable but it just makes me want to buy a printer now :neutral_face:

And quality printers can be had these days for ~$200 ... 

If it doesn't come in handy for eskating for you, there are literally a million other things you could do with it around the house. In the year and a half since I got mine I have gathered up 6 gigabytes of things I have printed for all sorts of random useful things, and my thought as I was buying it was "Hmm, I know this will be useful but I have *no idea* what the hell I am going to do with it..." not having a clue in my mind what I might use it for... just one example for my wife that echos many- "Why get that for $35 when I can literally print it for almost free (~3.2 cents?) in 5 minutes?"

Nah, lol... That thing is way too expensive for me. 

I am using the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus. It took a few modifications to get it printing reliably with good quality though: frame braces, filament guide plate, vibration dampeners, full enclosure, filament dust filter, all metal hotend upgrade to be able to heat up the nozzle a heck of a lot hotter for nylon, replacement bearings, replacement y axis thickened bed holder frame, glass print bed, y axis belt rigid idler bearing mount, removed spring belt tensioners, marlin firmware upgrade...  

It took some time to get it all going good. 

If I were to buy today, I hear the ender 3 is great, and I would have gone with that... Much less work to get it printing well. Make sure it has (or you can get) an all metal hotend for whatever you get, and that whatever you get can reach a bed temp of at least 100C and hotend temp of at least 260C... An enclosure and high temps are essentially for printing nylon. And yes, all these parts went through a couple iterations to test fitment and get the size after shrinkage just right. I build in about 0.3mm of play on the inner faces to account for shrinkage where it slides onto the motor.

Woah its almost like you replaced at least half of the parts and upgraded the rest. Thats cool that you got it to print that well and was worth it.

Yeah all metal hotend sounds like a good place to start with upgrades. Not sure how hot the bed can get on the ender 3. I’ll give it some more thought and try to justify getting one though probably would be easy to justify it even for just esk8 applications lol. Thanks for all the great info.

Well, the gears are holding up *okay*, but I do not think it's the best idea to run these without some sort of enclosure. Rocks and pebbles are really beating them up. Structurally they are 95% fine, and they still don't skip a beat, but they sound funny after a while of riding off-road. If these things are going to last a while I need to finish up a fully sealed enclosure and print some fresh gears. I can't wait to hear what they sound like with some liquid lubrication in there...

I've thought about it, but it seems like an investment without much value returned. Every time I print something, something changes... Rarely if ever have I printed something over and over the same way... And if I did that more often I'd be considering molding parts more than I do now.

Ah yes, before thats what I had. I've swapped back to the standard TB baseplates though, since the damper really kills speedwobble regardless and I wanted the turning radius back.

Lubricated (silicone, Teflon, white lithium) herringbone Gear drive enclosure with sealing TPU... Test spin. I can't wait to see how these ride once I get the other side on. I'll just go crazy and hope they don't fall apart. And, if they do fall apart, well then they weren't good enough and I have other options to fall back on.

Here's a video of the new gears in action. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH8hfL0DyA0

The noise sounds a lot quieter in person, something about the video really accentuates it, but if you listen close you can tell for most of the video the sound of the wind is louder than the gears themselves. I have since added even more teflon, white lithium and silicone grease just for the heck of it. I have a feeling these will break in nicely, assuming they don't go flying apart... lol.

Not going to sell it. It may end up on thingiverse. 

I took them out on a groupride today and they held up well all the way until the end of the ride. I scraped the bottom and one of them cracked in half. 

They were so beautiful, the ride so insanely quiet... they roll forever, the torque is instantaneous... Everything about them is great except for one major downside. They are fragile... they can't take a beating, and I doubt I could design a 3d printed enclosure for gears to withstand the kind of riding I want to do. Next step might be to mill these things out of aluminum or something... but for now I think I am going back to belts. I might even toss my superflys back on just for something different. 

For now, I know I love gears the most- more than anything else out there. They are *amazing* in every way... but I gotta stop tinkering with my drivetrain. Maybe if I printed the enclosures out of nylon they would hold up well... Oh jeez, I can't get sucked into re-making these out of nylon. :open_mouth:  :anger:  :triumph:

Should be, lots of areas have 0.2/0.3mm tollerances built in for 3D printing, and for most circular spots that means 0.2/0.3 for the radius = 0.6+mm

If you wanted it to be perfect, some work would have to be done. Plus, something needs to be done about the TPU. Maybe having perfect tollerances will square things up, but for 3D printing... I still believe having reliable 3D printed gear drives / enclosures is possible, especially if it were all nylon and didn't rely on sub mm tollerances (like my TPU gaskets), but this (although closer to reliable compared to my last iteration) is not it. Belts work well enough for now for me to decide that keeping on spending $20 on $20 for rolls of filament to test with is no longer viable. Lol. Until I get some good ideas, check out these pics of the aftermath.

I guess it's not as bad as it may look, but if this is the result of one extended ride... then back to belts for me.

What part wore out most? The pics are not very clear.

What's the issue with TPU, again?

Printing in nylon is the best case scenario, so definitely try it. I am building an enclosure and a heated dry box. Won't print nylon before that.

The TPU is fine, it just rubbed on the tires and turned black, so I need to work on those tolerances a bit. 

The gears were in perfect condition. I do need to do better to seal the enclosure, there were a few bits of shredded grass inside the enclosure after the ride, but not much... and no rocks or sand thankfully. The PETG enclosure itself took a hit from the edge of a sidewalk and shattered, nylon would just bend, and if that were the case i'd still be riding my gear drive probably.

Progress finally on a voltage booster. 

I was sketched out about using my 2S many P vruzend kit due to the 4A per cell limitation, and because of the overall size. Also, it really is a mishmash of cells from all over the place, but at least the P groups are as closely matched in overall Ah as possible. 

![20181218_051138|690x335](upload://88o3KpAgXee2kbb9pGgPXpowmxp.jpeg) 

Regardless, I decided I don't need to go 48 mph weighted, up from 40mph on my current gearing with that crazy pack... whatever it is.

So I used some old salvaged LG laptop cells ![20181213_200700|690x335](upload://6Z9Gc9kryFPFVBIOrljvdDCdgUr.jpeg) to put together a gigantic 1S pack to boost voltage 3-4v, giving me an extra 3-4 mph top speed.

![20181218_005053|690x335](upload://6ONcUQtFzwEP5HNg15xPRf7HujR.jpeg) 

It's a 1S26P. The cells capacity tested out to around 2750mah each, so 71.5Ah, or 257Wh. This is nice, because hopefully I won't have to charge it as much... Maybe once every 4 times I take it out. I needed a P group much larger than my main batteries 4P because of my main packs range extender / boost converter that I carry an extra 400 - 600Wh to charge while riding... And that won't be keeping this voltage boosting pack charged, only the main pack. 

![20181218_005112|690x335](upload://vLGgdgUUpR7lSbJ2Gezk8Mb9bUS.jpeg) 

The cells are only rated for 5A discharge, so I needed 26 of them to reach my boards max battery load of 80A. Each cell should only need to output ~3A to match the 80A requirement, also I don't want to push old laptop cells to their 5A limit.

![20181218_013703|690x335](upload://oOdlA7KwZR4vddDn1fOM4wmEfCK.jpeg) 

I used fish paper where the 12AWG wires run on each side and before wrapping it all up tight I sealed everything up with electrical tape and around the protruding wires with I padded with some 7mm thick or so thick neoprene rubber and a final layer of craft foam to make sure that no matter what I'm taking any stress/pressure off the nickel strips, since I wasn't able to fish paper underneath (they were already spot welded on from being in the laptop batteries, and I figured I'd just keep and reuse them as-is so I wouldn't be soldering on top of the cells directly). I'm pretty sure this will suffice, having the standard terminal ring and battery wrap, since the pack itself was also hot glued like crazy in every single open crevice and taped over again and again.

![20181218_015647|690x335](upload://jmJyvw6Ew5AAATwKLvs4vhjwHxB.jpeg) 

I don't have any other pictures of the build, but each side has two 12AWG silicone wires splitting the load to the main +/- which is 10AWG. The whole thing plugs into my loopkey and tested out it adds 4mph to my top end successfully. Tomorrow I'll be doing some stress tests on it.

Took the 1S 26P pack out for a stress test this afternoon. Thankfully I got out before dark. I calculated that i'd reach a max of 44mph and that's exactly what happened. yeet!

Overall it seems to work well. My lowest voltage under load was 34 volts and the booster pack under load would drop to 4.0v. Because of this, and so I don't stress my 10S 25R pack too much (since it likes to sag quite a bit and I rely on the vescs low voltage cutoff of 28-30v often instead of the BMS low voltage cutoff), I'll probably only be using this pack under full load down to 38 volts on the main pack. 

It works great with the charger going at the same time, that's a relief. I noticed under load, the 26P pack sags at most 0.1V, which I think is crazy compared to 8-9V on my 25R pack. I guess it's just all that P. 

Enjoy the video. Skip to 3:00 min for the speed test.

Random update time, not much going on.

My belts started skipping on my worn down 20T motor pullies. So, I took some time this weekend to beautify and refresh the board a bit while changing up the gearing. 

* Desperately needed new grip tape - old was literally chunking off it was that stale, new stuff is heavy grit for the feet, standard elsewhere.
* New wheel pulleys (15:32) needed bearing insert spacers printed - no skipping ever!
* Zealous ceramics got cleaned, Teflon lubed and white lithium greased - so smooth!

Otherwise, I've gone through many damp paper towels cleaning this thing up. Winter, snow melt, salt and mud are a bitch.

Went out for a quick ride- Hooked up esc monitor. Calibrated controller. Turned on board. Started rolling. Accelerated just fine for a few seconds until it went full brake. Then it stopped. And it shot out from under me full speed in reverse. I just watched my board fly full speed into the curb, motors first. Thankfully it stopped there. The motors seem fucked. My boost converter thing is probably fucked. The enclosures seem fine, hopefully I can salvage the components.

What would cause this kind of behavior? A faulty receiver?

It looks like I'll be able to salvage almost everything. I took apart both motors and only one magnet is partially cracked... I applied some glue to it, hopefully that will help it hold until my DDs come in. After powering everything on it seems to run like normal.

The only thing I'm a bit wary of is just replacing the baseplate, bolting everything together and rolling on like nothing happened... I need to get to the bottom of this.

Luckily i was going like 10mph and rolled my ass through a stop sign.  Luckily in my neighborhood and like 2 mins from the house.

That literally shattered my confidence. Turned the board off. Detached belts..pushed back to the house and tossed the nano x to the shit box.

Rebuilt from scratch on a rayne killswitch. I cleaned everything, except for the remote... I should probably clean that, or disable reverse.

That took a while! The battery is now securely mounted to the deck itself with command strips, and neoprene foam + weather stripping for a little bit of extra support and vibration dampening. All other components minus the focboxes which need a press fit to the external heatsinks are also securely mounted to the deck.

I did my best to water/weatherproof it with multiple layers of nice squishy weather stripping, cutting holes, channels, and sealing along all the holes and channels. I went around the weather stripping and hot glued between the enclosure to fill the gap on the outside. 

It's crazy how much smaller it is compared to my old deck, it feels weird. I wanted to get this for parts for a Haya, now I'm thinking about starting that one completely from scratch.

I just can't stay away from having a boost converter on deck. My watt meter got destroyed in the accident, so I went with a simple voltage meter on the 6S battery input side of the boost converter to just read and beep when it's time to swap packs. 

The wiring is much cleaner than before, and I don't think the whole setup looks too bad.

Your title says TB/Paris trucks but I can't find any mention of the Paris trucks in your build, did you ever use them on this?  All I see are the TBs

Yep, the front truck on this is a Paris 180 since the other TB truck was destroyed in the accident when it was on a Rayne Demonseed. The front truck is silver, that's the Paris.  I think I like how the Paris truck on the front increases maneuverability, and makes it feel kinda surfy.

But the drive wheels have always been TB?

Yep. The old rear truck was demolished, so I moved the old TB front to the back to mount the motors on.

Yeah, I thought so too. Just one broken magnet in the end, but all the bits were still in place and the glue seems to be holding well. The scratchiness of both motors has settled down as well.

Woah, do you have a build guide of sorts on the adapter for the powertool battery? I have a few Makita powertool batteries lying around and am thinking of using them to power a board.

Yeah, earlier in this thread are more step by step pictures how I set it up the first time. 

It's easy enough, basically just somehow wire the battery into the in side of a boost converter, set the pots to the correct charge voltage and appropriate amps, and wire the output of the boost converter to a plug compatible with your charge port.

For your tool batteries, design a slot they can click into and a clever way to mount it. I'd suggest printing in Nylon since it's pliable and the boost converter will be vibrating a ton while riding. The vibrations will kill your boost converter without silicone or e6000 or something smothered around all the components on the converter PCB- that's how mine died once, a mosfet broke loose.
