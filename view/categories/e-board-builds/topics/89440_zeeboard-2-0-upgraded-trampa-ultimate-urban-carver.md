I’m planning on upgrading my Trampa single drive Urban Carver. Here are the current specs:

 1 x ULTIMATE Urban Electric Carver - SINGLE Motor with V6 VESC & BEAST Box Mini ULTIMATE Titanium Spring Trucks 

* 15ply SOLID Carve 
* 136Kv Motor
* 14 Tooth Motor Pulley 
* 5 Spoke SUPERSTAR Hubs 
* 6.5 Inch BLACK URBAN Treads Tyre
* MAYTECH rechargable Remote &amp; Receiver - Small size Thumb Operated
* 2 x 6S1P 6000mAh 22.2v 25-50CC Lipo

It’s my first board and it runs pretty well but doesn’t handle hills very well here in Johannesburg. The motor heats up too quickly.  I also want to move all the electronics into an enclosure as it just looks way better to me than the Beast Box on the back.

I’m planning on moving to dual drive. I’ve already upgraded from the stock Trampa 6364 136Kv motor to an esk8 6374 149Kv motor to see if I could climb the hills better, but it was only marginally better. 

My 1.5 version of this board will probably be simply moving the current electronics under the board into an enclosure and replace the Lipo with 16850s. I’ve ordered the following already:

* 50 x Samsung 30q - 12s4p config (2 extra just in case)
* @Eboosted urban carver enclosure + rubber gasket + bolt kit
* All necessary equipment to to the [synchronised VESC lighting mod](https://github.com/ju-mpe-r/synchronized_lighting_for_vesc).

The reason I’m doing a “1.5” version is that it’s really expensive to go dual motors and change the battery at the same time. The reason that I’ve added the lighting to this version is that I’m off to Afrika Burn at the end of the month and need to light up my board somehow!

Version 2.0 will then be to add:

* an additional VESC6
* a motor mount of sorts - either a second one from Trampa or probably one from @idea (far sexier than the trampa one, me thinks)
* a second motor

My issue now is that I don’t think I can fit dual 6374 motors on the back of the carver, as there isn’t enough space. I assume I can fit 2 trampa 136K motors though, as Trampa sells their boards in that dual configuration. So I’ll probably end up going for another Trampa 136Kv, so that I have matched motors. 

I’ll start posting pics as I go through the build. Waiting for the stuff to arrive first. 

Any thoughts, suggestions, recommendations would be most welcome!

Because I have Lipos I bought a balance charger from Trampa. The [Graupner 18s](http://www.trampaboards.com/graupner-ultramat-18-charger--capable-of-charging-2x-6s-batteries-at-once-with-balancing-cables--p-26730.html). Because I have this charger I thought that I won’t need a BMS. I don’t really want to spend extra money if I’ve already got a charger that can balance. My only concern with doing it this way is that I’ll have to ensure that the balance connectors are somehow moulded into the enclosure. I’m sure @eboosted has some advice on how best to do this... :slight_smile:
