Not bad.
Peak Amp is around 20a for each(10S battery)

Those are only rated to 24V 10A...if you're doing 36V 20A they will get HOT won't they?

Really cool idea, there are a bunch of these motors in various size and pretty cheap, way cheaper than building a direct drive from the ground up

itll be fine, rated voltage does not really matter for brushless motors as long as the winding's dont short out

Well done...again. Each new build looks better and better. These hubs look like they are just right for your AT setup and 8" tires. Have you had a chance to test the range and efficiency yet? How do the 2wd and 4wd versians do with tackling hills?

@Mobutusan

This hub motor is available with 8-inch tires, 
but 7-inch tires seem to be more suitable.

If I have 4WD, 8 inch tires will not be a problem.

I have a course to check battery consumption.

I have not checked this board yet. Maybe I'll test this weekend.

With regard to 4WD, i'm designing a new method of 5.5 inch fixing.
This method is to fix the truck without machining.
This method will be released as a 5th production.

That consumption is really good for a pneumatic setup, looking forward to the 5th version

@Pedrodemio
I had spent more than 300 watts on the same course on a belt drive.

My 5th version will have a structure where the wheels and motors are combined as much as possible.

I was doing some sketches of my direct drive and this was one of the ways I thought of doing

If you never plan to swap wheels frequently I think it's the best way, one bearing less

@Martin whats the size of the hole of the stator?

The truck hanger process was not as easy as it sounds.
I wanted to introduce a simpler method.

@Pedrodemio
It will help you. Referring to the sketch file I uploaded 

I think that the hole of the stator is 17mm.

Thanks

For me to use in my TB218 truck I will need modifications, but my previous truck was also turned down to 17mm and ended up bending, the solution would be to cut the stator on the shape of the hanger
