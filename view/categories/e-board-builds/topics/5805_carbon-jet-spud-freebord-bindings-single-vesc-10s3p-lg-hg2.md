thought about whether I should make a build thread here or on my beloved endless sphere, but this place is really quite alive and well organized - hard to say no. :slight_smile:

really enjoyed @RunPlayBack Spudnik build and when I recently came across OKPs unikboard video (http://unikboards.com), which apparantly also use a Jet Spud with freeboard S2 bindings, I was sold - no clue why I didnt think about freeboard bindings on a regular street board yet. bindings are an awesome thrill that allows a lot of cool stuff, especially with a board that is probably a lot lighter compared to my trampa. pulled the trigger on the deck, which is pretty cheap with just 85€ incl. shipping and I had plenty of materials left for some carbon fun.

so for now this build will mostly focus on the infrastructure, i.e. board, wiring and enclosure. the rest is quickly done anyway ... so Im not actually sure what kind of motor, wheels and trucks I want for this board yet.

so much for an introduction, lets get to it. started with some proper sanding, since I didnt like the overall finish and build quality of the board. wheel wells werent symmetric, the wood under the sketchy graphics was rough, truck mounting holes were larger than what they had to be, but found out quickly why: the drill spots werent very exact and barely fit my testmounted trucks.

then I started drawing (which works a lot better on wood than on graphics). Had a quick sketch ready on keynote for single vesc and a liion battery and found out quickly, that by taking the wheel wells as enclosure limits, only a 10S3P liion battery was possibly on this board. so far I really loved 10S4P - its a great blend of power and durability. 10S3P will have to work here though, nothing else possible and I think a little less weight probably suits a freeboard well.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_2.jpg

just added the ronins and kegels for some visual impression - got these wheels and trucks since forever in my treasure chest and never got to use them properly.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_3.jpg

off to routing the electronic compartment - I made some router guide with that straight piece of wood. you can see one routed line there already, nice and straight, much better than free hand routing (which was kinda my first attempt to it a while ago). I carved out wood of 6-7mm depths. 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_4.jpg

2 long sides done, now the perpendicular sides to have an outline for the rest (which I did with a wider routing bit and without any router guides).
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_5.jpg

done, some sanding and I called it a good first evening. that 6-7mm depth was REALLY a lot, I think there are just 2-3mm left on the board - sounds really hollow when I knock in the middle region and it feels like I could break the board by hitting the middle hard. gotta need a lot of carbon to restore the structure:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_6.jpg

this time I wanted to push a little further like with every build: planned to sink in the enclosure lid like on my evolve board, so that its actually on level ground with the rest of the roadside board surface. this will also make it much easier to trim the enclosure later when its done, since it will act as an automatic trim guide.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_7.jpg

used a large nut for a nice rounded lid:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_8.jpg

and some routing, I really was extremely careful not to screw it up since, unlike the middle routed box, the sunk in lid will be visible from the outside. I also drilled mounting holes already for M4 inserts, so that those will actually be protected and not visible under the carbon.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_9.jpg

few more impressions:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_10.jpg

had some burn marks from the router bit because I was very careful and worked very slowly ;)
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_11.jpg

added the m4 inserts ...
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_12.jpg

... and used filler to get rid of the 2nd pair of mounting truck holes and some imperfections.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_13.jpg

I actually drilled real holes into the board this time for the inserts. my plan is to lay a few layers of carbon roadside to restore the boards structure, then use a very slim drill bit to open the carbon in the right places from the boards topside! the carbon and resin will keep the inserts in place nicely and the inserts will be actually mostly covered by carbon except for the small m4 hole! 

problem is with these inserts: sometimes, and only when used with loctite, the inserted threads will come out - set under carbon and resin like that, it certainly wont happen. topside of the board will get the same treatment later, so the inserts will be stuck between 2 resin carbon sheets and that should properly seat them for good! :slight_smile:  

anyway, to actually lay carbon, I didnt want the resin to fill the threads of the m4 inserts and exit on board top side, so I added m4 screws into the inserts. Im a little worried about that, not sure how strong the resin bond will be. 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_14.jpg

threads are covered! quick note here before Im off to vacuum bagging: on all pictures you can see that the surface isnt actually supersmooth, but sanded with quite rough grid (P40). I did that on purpose to allow a the strongest bond between maple <-> resin & carbon layers!
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_15.jpg

preparations for vacuum bagging: starting with the last things first and then working my way from the top when the resin is set up: vacuum bag prepared, the soaking breather layer, that also allows the vacuum pump to reach every spot evenly cut into the right format!
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_16.jpg

bleeder layer - basically a release film with small holes in it, so resin can transfer through to be soaked by the breather layer:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_17.jpg

nice air grade carbon twill for a sexy finish:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_18.jpg

a small tip: when you cut carbon or glas weave, take some painters tape and tape the outline directly on the carbon, then cut right through it! like that you wont have fibers flying around all over the place and the carbon wont fray on the edge:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_19.jpg

last thing and basically first layer when I start the layup: unidirectional carbon to max the strength of the typical skateboard load (bending towards road between the trucks).
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_20.jpg


the layup will be 1x unidirectional carbon (which is a little stiffer to work with and 2x carbon twill, then add the bleeder, then breather, then put it into the vacuum bag and switch on the pump. I really dont think 3 layers is enough to fully restore the boards structure, but Ill add one more gfk + carbon layer ontop to cover LHB-style motor wires (more if I feel like I need it - will do a careful load test after the 3 current roadside layers have cured).

sadly no pictures of the layup - couldnt take any with soggy resin hands and I try to work swiftly because the resin keeps curing.

when I switched on the pump, I used the vacuum bag and the increasing pressure of the bag on the board to smoothly wrap the carbon all around the edges (hard to explain - usually a vacuum bag wouldnt put pressure on the edges really - or straighten them out or wrap around the board). this time I wanted the boardedges covered with carbon - for looks, but mostly to add further structural support and its not THAT trivial to actually get a tight fit and pressure around the edges of the board. I drew a picture to explain it - basically, with rubber gloves on my hands, I pulled the bag towards the middle on topside with really a lot of force while the pump kept applying more and more pressure on the bag. 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_25.jpg 

ontop of that I also used a pretty sharp edged wood block to stretch the vacuum bag in the right spots so that the routed electric compartment will have sharp edges. if you dont do that, the edges will be very rounded, with air or resin below the carbon weave and youll lose a lot of your enclosure surface by that.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_21.jpg 

fairly sharp contours - this will be one of my sharpest vacuum bagging features on a board so far I think.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_22.jpg 

here you can see the roadside result of how I wrapped the vacuum bag around the board:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_24.jpg 

thats it for now - time to clean up and wait for the resin to cure (24h).

yea, thats pretty much the reason why I started this little jet spud thing! http://freebord.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/binding-mounting-s2-freebord.jpg

my tesseract is too large and heavy for this already imo and the unikboard jet spud binding prototypes look really awesome: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/56008b04f70ce1561c886ad10ebbf020a5daffa8.jpg" width="500" height="500">

cant really take any credit for the idea - Im really just building a unikboard clone right now before its released - but with routing, inserted wires and carbon. :slight_smile:

i had seen that binding idea when you posted it in another thread. seems like so much fun. Freebords are sketchy as hell but i think something like that ^ would be super fun. Can't wait to see what you end up with and hear your thoughts- this may be my second build. Good luck!!

soo, I started early since the curing temperature was higher than 20°C anyway - Im happy but I need a break now ... also, cause its noon on a sunday ... in germany where people will give you the looks when you still wield a sander outside on sunday lunchtime. :laughing:

I already noticed last night that the wrapping of the carbon around the board will leave a mess on topside. partly the screws were covered, resin soaked weave everywhere and it wasnt always just flat, but crumbled. long story short: topside WAS a resin crusted mess.

but lets start with the good things! thats how the roadside came out - no sanding, nothing, just removed the breather and bleeder layer. 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_26.jpg

you can tell its fresh from the vacuum bag from the small white pimples on the carbon. these are the tiny holes of the bleeder layer, where the breather layer gets stuck a little bit.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_27.jpg

ok, turning it around ... argh :disappointed: this would be a mess for sanding, since from sanding heat, the resin becomes fluid again and then it clogs up your sand paper instantly. also I was super afraid of the screws - looked like the resin actually found its way through the inserted threads and came out on topside, seating the screws nicely. :fearful:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_28.jpg

but I mean, at least the board edges are well covered by the carbon - looking good overall except for the topside mess.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_29.jpg

alright then, my favourite hobby: sanding in the burning midday heat with 50% humidity and a dust mask against the carbon dust. :mask:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_30.jpg

more or less done - the rest is cosmetic litte stuff Ill do before I lay another gfk/carbon layer after motor wire channels. thank god the screws came out and the inserts stayed - I used special screws with a large torx head so that I really could grab them with some torque without killing off the head. all of them came lose after instant full torque with the cordless electric screwdriver and at least the inserts appear to be really strongly bonded with the wood resin and carbon. 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_31.jpg

rest of the board has turned out nicely. pimples gone, sanded under water with 280, then 600 grit.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_32.jpg

and 2 more perspectives
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_33.jpg
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_34.jpg

taking a break now, next in line is either routing motor wire channels with topside gfk/carbon OR maybe better to start with the enclosure first - then I can leave the enclosure inserts still closed on roadside, laminate the enclosure over it, then, before removing the laminate, Ill drill the holes from board topside through the carbon layer AND the enclosure at the same time, ensuring a perfect fit! hmm :smirk_cat:

board is pretty light, wish I weighted before routing. :rolling_eyes:

still gotta test though if the board will hold up - testmounting trucks and going down the hill next to my house a few times I guess. dont dare to jump in the middle of the board yet :fearful:

not sure if that kind of load will ever happen really - the board is so short that the feet will probably always be very close to the truck mounting points. seems unreasonable to jump with 80kg on the most vulnerable spot. :confused:

nvm, all my fears are gone and I certainly wont add another layer ontop! that board is borderline stiff really, might be the short size or the first time I tried unidirectional carbon ... or its the board edges that give it that little extra. i quickly was bold enough to jump around in the middle and the board was utterly unimpressed.

also doh, this thing after 40kph felt a little scary with the ronins, think 44 calibers probably suit this better!

was a little suprised how incredibly turny that spud is ... didnt really realize how tiny that wb really is until I lined it up with the rest of the gang . :heart_eyes_cat:

the vanguard is really a carving monster, but feels like the titanic at low speed from a maneuverability pov. the tesseract is turny, but still feels super solid at 48kph, the spud (admittedly with cronins) around 40kph made me think about foot brake :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

havent tried the bindings yet - the quick testrun to check for board structural stability was just some downhill with a few evil bumps to see how the board takes it, no bindings attached to the board yet.

I plan to jump a few stairs, do some ollies over stuff, maybe some 180s - just things I couldnt really do with the other boards. basically what I did with the trampa, but that one was way too heavy (read: Im too weak). bit worried though that the soud might be too stiff - I played a LOT of tennis in my youth and got a few knee issues, which is one of the reasons Im so madly in love with the extremely comfortable vanguard. :heart_eyes:

been busy with the enclosure during the portugal vs france (poor ronaldo :pensive: ), used hard foam again and I can already see that it gave in in one spot, about 2x2cm sized small dent. :confounded: very annoying, but I dont see how I can work with wood like on my tesseract, since the board and the routed base for the enclosure is bent quite a bit, so I need the flexible hard foam as mold for the vacuum bagging. bah, Ill see tomorrow evening. not looking forward to unwrapping under these circumstances. :frowning2:

@lox897 if your spud is still the raw deck, could you measure the stock weight for me?  

wish I had tried out the deck before I did all these modifications. usually, I always ride new decks a little manually and then get going ... or not. this time I was so sure that this is the way to go that I didnt even test it. would love to know how stiff that board actually has been before my changes. Im really a friend of some flex, helps my knee and everything actually. right now the spud is the stiffest board of all my builds - and all that because I was so afraid after the routing --- felt like the board was about to snap anytime when I just looked at it. must say that Im a little surprised about this outcome. :confused:

then again, flex only does something for damping when you are actually not standing directly on your trucks. so medium or stiff flex ... either way the spud will be a pretty direct stiff ride!

I know that a dent in the enclosure will keep bothering me, so Ill most likely just do it again with something that will widthstand the pressure of vacuum bagging. stupid hard foam - this stuff NEVER held up so far, always some partial dents, but I also need the pressure to get halfway decent sharp features. 

used the waiting time of the resin curing now and skated by a local carpenter to pick up some cutting leftover mdf that the nice guy even cut me to the correct dimension for free. :heart_eyes:

then used my router to round the edges and will use some 1-2mm thick leftover gfk, pvc and cfk plates to model the concave of the board roughly. Ill be wasting some height like that going from slightly rounded to perfectly flat but cant have it all.

Do you notice a difference using an MDF mold vs regular plywood for vacuuming? Like is MDF more porous so the air flows more evenly? I want to try an MDF mold for my ABS vacuum former.

hmm, against all odds and a clearly visible dent through 2 layers of breather, the enclosure came out great!! :sweat_smile:

very smooth top

nice and evenly rounded edges
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_36.jpg

usually you have these crumbled edges where the bleeder foil is crumbled. no idea how to get around that. its easy enough to sand though!
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_37.jpg

and a slight concave following the routed compartment. thats the cool part of the hard foam mold - it follows light curvatures just from the vacuum pressure!

off to hours of sanding :stuck_out_tongue:

What do u think of doing rounded ends as you've done them vs the ground-off edge mastercho did?  

Mastercho could you do a rounded edge like that with an infusion and the core you used? Maybe another core 

Off to the mold making store! Thanks for you're great info.

A lot of sanding. I don't want to do any and want to make it pop out done. The greatest pop out possible

What foam did you use sorry whiteponny I'll search the thread ...impatient..Oo you just used the foam as a mold
Remember the hydroflex video? That looks like it could pop out done

not sure what you can do with vacuum resin infusion, but with a layup like I do, its basically impossible to achieve real sharp edge contours. 
a few layers of carbon will always smooth things out and youll have a rounded edge and thats partially a random process, because of the way a vacuum bag works during evacuation. 

basically, while evacuating the vacuum bag, the surface of the bag will be pressed onto some other surface (board, other side of the bag, whatever else there is) and the friction becomes really high. problem is, that the bag starts as a plane 2D surface until it realizes that there is actually a 3d mold under it with increasing atmospheric pressure / decreasing pressure inside the bag. now, these bags are really resilient, so it stretches a little, but not very much ... and due to the strong friction its not able to give in a lot which also adds to the rounded edge problem.

that vacuum bag thing can be sorted with either a very stretchy bag or, like I did, you work the bag with your hands during evacuation and make sure that there is enough bag material right around where 3D surface changes are, so that it wont have to stretch a lot ... meaning that it will follow the mold better and also allow sharper edges. I also worked with the wood block to stretch the bag in the right placed so it will allow sharper edges!

overall its so hard to explain - youll know what I mean once you watched a bag evacuating the first time. :slight_smile: 

problem with these rounded edges is, that most often under the carbon, there is this cavity of the edgy mold vs. the rounded carbon layers, that will either be filled with resin or air - so Id always try to make it a little easier and just do a rounded mold right away, because in the end you want mostly fibers with minimal resin!

about the "unwrap and done": think that will never really happen unless you skip the breather layer that soaks up excess resin. the moment you have bleeder + breather, youll have small breather pimples on the carbon and probably a somewhat crumbled surface where the not very stretchy bleeder foil wrinkled a little (lacking a lot of vocabularly here I think). 
if you dont soak up the resin, then it might form a beautiful surface like the mastercho board topside, that has a mirrorlike finish from the acryl sheet. but thats just one side - if you check mastersho's roadside, it looks like my enclosure! ;)

ok, off to sanding now, laters :smiley:

p.s.: I used XPS hard foam, think in english its extruded polystyrene high-resistance foam, 30kg/m^3. think the higher this number, the more pressure resistant it will be!

by the way, this is NOT foam core material, its just material to make a mold!

Only it's possible if you include the rounded edges in the mold and then you are stuck with one design of the board.

back from cutting, sanding and drilling holes! it was a little dark already, couldnt take any nice pictures with sunlight on the carbon texture anymore ... but got a few impressions at least.

starting with drilling holes from the boards topside right through the boards roadside carbon layers and the enclosure lid with a 3mm drill bit that wouldnt hurt the M4 threads of the inserts. you can spot the tiny holes if you look closely! I left the foam mold on the board so you can have a look at it - its very simple, all I did was cutting a correctly sized rectangle from a larger industrial XPS foam plate and rounding the edges a little. note how I also rounded the boardside edges because of the rounded edges of the carbon compartment in the board - the vacuum bag will pull the foam down to the ground of the compartment and bend it smoothly around the mild concave - but for that to happen the foam piece had to be a perfect fit for the rounded carbon ground!

fuck yea, you can see right through all 10 holes WITH the enclosure attached! :smiley: 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_40.jpg

and the m4 inserts are perfectly hidden under the carbon:

enclosure is a nice fit, it actually sticked to the board from the adhesive effect of water alone :slight_smile: 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_42.jpg

transition board surface <-> enclosure is ok, I couldve cut the lid a little slimmer, but didnt want to cut too much around the drilled holes.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_43.jpg

note how the texture of the enclosure carbon perfectly transitions into the texture of the board carbon :sunglasses:

board 85€, used up about 1m^2 carbon and maybe 0.5m^2 of breather/bleeder, the vacuum bag is holding up since forever now, finally about 500gramm resin and 1m sticky tape, so probably around 50-60€.

tools used:
springsteel ruler
hand router & some clamps for guided
vacuum pump
dremel for cutting
vibrational sander

the compartment cut was 37.8 x 14.0cm (I think when I drew it on the board I pretty much just fit it between the wheel wells, hence the weird length. I knew from my keynote sketch (37x14), that it had enough room for a 10S3P battery, 1 vesc and some wires + antispark on/off switch:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4a174b89611c72a32c6a039d9eab32e53dd37e08.jpg" width="690" height="257">

I then adjusted the foam block slightly to the always slightly varying carbon layup result, so I actually made the block a little smaller with 37.5 x 13.8cm.

tempering? nah :yum: I did that on my very first vacuum result in the small sauna of my parents where I still used crazy air grade CF and air grade resin that, after tempering, reaches slightly better material properties including heat resistance until 120°C. didnt really feel like I needed that though, feels a little overkill. its just a skateboard afterall, didnt plan to fly to the moon with it. :smile:

thanks man, that seems small! Would be guessing a tight depth of 2cm or something? And you are going to skip the BMS right?

i wouldnt call it small - more like "sufficiently large". :smile:

yea, exactly 2cm height, you get these foam sheets in various thicknesses - 2cm is perfect for 18650 cells though - theyll end up at quite exactly 2cm with thick shrink tube, then Ill glue in some felt sheet that will just put a little pressure on the cells to fixate them.

and yea, no bms! too many batteries worked out far too well for too many discharge cycles. secret is probably to use quality cells and to treat them well. ill do maintenance every now and then and check the serial voltages by hand.

about the smell: I usually prepare everything so that I can work fast once the resin is set up, layup takes maybe 5-10minutes. I mix the resin outside and stir it well for 1-2minutes, then do the layup with open windows, then seal it in the bag, apply vacuum and bring all things with resin outside. once in the bag, there is no smell anymore. i keep the room closed with open windows anyway, cause I dont want to listen to a vacuum pump for 24h! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

tbh, I never tried what happens if I switch the pump off, but Im nearly 100% sure that I would fairly quickly loose pressure. not sure how the roarrockit kit works and what pressure it keeps up constantly. my pump manages about -900mbar and its meant for continuous pumping. 

Ill try it someday ... would feel really stupid if the bag actually held pressure haha :joy:

last big picture attack!

started with drawing the LHB wire channels on boards topside - this time no silly rectangular shapes but something that the 3 parallel wires can actually follow:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_46.jpg

exiting right next to typical rubber pads, which are a little wider than most truck baseplates:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_47.jpg

routing, this time by hand since the geometry and the router base plate didnt allow to go with reasonable guides. it was quite messy, because with the big router baseplate, I routed a lot of different and varying depths, so I had to adjust height frequently, reroute, repeat. a little annoying and not very surgical like my electronic compartment. but it works and wont be visible anyway, 3x 12AWG wires in! 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_48.jpg

and they exit directly in the electronic compartment:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_49.jpg

my useful little helper for the 90° bullet connector insert:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_50.jpg

really a lot of tin and allowing it to sink in really deep
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_51.jpg

3 wires done, now off to heat shrink
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_52.jpg

got very thick shrink tube with glue inside, because I dont want them to short the motor phases via the carbon roadside. this shrink tube is really super sturdy!!
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_53.jpg

hammered them in (6.5mm drilled holes just barely fit, I really cant remove or stick them in further with my hands, had to use the hammer
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_54.jpg

glued the wires to the wood and closed the exits with glue too
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_55.jpg

this time no resin mess, just used putty to level it out. Im not sure if this will stay intact, but Ill try. really didnt feel like resin, gfk, vacuum bag, wait for another 24h, screw up the roadside carbon finish, because resin somehow always finds a way to make a mess... :stuck_out_tongue: 
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_56.jpg

apply vicious grip and we are basically done here for now :heart_eyes:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_57.jpg

trucks arent mounted yet, board is just sitting ontop of the trucks for some pictures :sunglasses:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_58.jpg

motor wire exits
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_59.jpg

fixated the enclosure just with 2 screws and even with 10 screws missing, there is hardly any visible transition between board and enclosure.

on my vanguard, I used the smallest of these kind of switches that I could find:
http://www.naturalhealthsupply.com/assets/images/on-off-switch.jpg

think I might go the same way with the spud, using an antispark device with a simple and very small switch.

I never really needed to check battery voltage. usually you can feel quite well where the batteries are by doing quick topspeed checks. otherwise I know by now how much energy I need depending on how I ride. anything between 9 and 15kWh per kilometer.

generally, I cant have anything with LED background lights on my boards - its giving away too easily from too far away, that Im not running a regular skateboard. dont want to attract police too easily :relaxed:

You have enough solid material to justify someone spending a few $$$ on it. Just saying...I'd buy it!

hm, you arent actually strapped into those - they are closed towards board rear & front and open towards the middle, so you can quickly move in and out as you want. think its perfectly possibly to push that board, then slide your feet under the bindings for an ollie, then pull back a little and just stand on the board like you normally would. sure, its a little more eye-catching than without bindings, but I dont have to push it with led stuff. :smile:

mounted caliber 44s now for real - still had those from my to be reworked topspeed build, sadly only stock bushings which are way too soft for me - got wheelbite right away with those. my beloved krank barrels should be in the mail tomorrow. :slight_smile:

aaand I mounted the enclosure now as a test before I get all the electronics. actually got my cells today, so I might start working on the 10S3P battery tonight ... or I might just ride the board manually a little and find a good mounting point for the bindings. love holidays, so much time to do just what I want :sunglasses:


anyway, a few pictures of the mounted enclosure - love the screw combinations that took me a while to set up (its a flat countersunk torx screw with a countersunk washer and a 1mm thick rubber washer :grinning:):

get a 60-100cm springsteel ruler (& springsteel angle also helps) and start drawing directly on your board, it helped me so much with precision. also, ALWAYS double check from different fixpoints (like truck holes) if numbers add up! :relaxed:

the rest is patience and diligence. you can always make things perfect if you just take your time. I didnt have any patience when I build my first board, but I finally got it now (most of the time). and even now I sometimes act too quick, screw something up ... its just that you wont see any pictures of that. :smile:

______
I tried to position the bindings and I might not have to try much afterall because I found a near perfect spot already. when I ride boards with wheel wells, I most often just have my foot next to it, so that the board feels like it got tons of rocker. and coincidently, if I just use the outer 2 truck mounting screws for the bindings, it just aligns perfectly for that position ... for front and rear! Im just a little puzzled why unikboard has the bindings so close to nose and tail ... they probably had a good reason. :confused:

http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_64.jpg

really dont like the cheap silver look of the binding baseplate, its also so ridiculously heavy :confounded: I might at least color it black before the build is complete - its a waiting game now anyway, vesc, motors, mount not there and not coming very soon. and I dont feel like using parts from my tesseract, just like that board too much.

http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_76.jpg

then doing all serial connections. the middle of the battery by 3 nickel strips each (its not a lot, if I assume about 15A per nickel strip its just 45A, but that works for me in a max 60A continuous battery).
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_77.jpg

the "outer" connections I did with 2x 5mm wide copper wick each, because a single nickel strip feels a little too small for the typical currents
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_78.jpg

plus and minus side has a little extra copper wick to attach the battery wires - I usually go with 10AWG, but I think this time 12AWG will do. taking the isolation off, then splitting the small copper wires inside in half, putting the dual copper wick in between and clamping the split sides together.
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_79.jpg

this makes for a very nice joint after soldering
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_80.jpg

finally thick shrink tube with glue inside and bending the wire in the correct form while the shrink tube is still hot
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_81.jpg

then fixating the wires with some scotch tape and folding the battery like a butterfly. the minus wire is running in the channel made by the 20 serial connection nickel strips (that I covered with thick adhesive tape)
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_82.jpg

finally shrink tube and a quick weight check: 1500gr!
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_83.jpg


no balancing wires - Ill check back on the battery in a few months for maintenance and measure the serial packs manually. I dont expect any drift because all my other batteries also never showed any drift. but who knows, this is my smallest battery - maybe with more load Ill see some drift eventually. :slight_smile:

its a 10S battery (max 42V) and Ill be using the evolve charger that charges with 4A  to 41.4V with CC/CV. takes a while, but usually Im never in a hurry with charging. can always swap boards. most of the time I dont feel like skateboarding more when I have drained one of my 10S4P batteries! :stuck_out_tongue:

Im quite happy that it cuts off early, since the last 1-2V dont really add much to the capacity anyway and just decrease battery life. also like that, Im more robust to drift related overcharging IF the cells should actually drift. I think I would be perfectly fine with an 80% CC quick charger.

if that should ever be necessary, Ill use my single cell charger and bring each parallel pack into saturation with that one. it will be a chore, but I dont see myself needing to do that very often if at all during the life of my battery!

coming back from a short run, the caliber 44s suit the wheelbase so much better!! it rides now like my tesseract - agile, but very stable!

the bindings are positioned perfectly for carving - its a snug fit too with most of my shoes. been trying to ollie a little which is slightly weird because you dont pop the board with your rear foot with a binding thats set up like mine. maybe this is the reason for unikboards binding placement (which would feel awkward to me on the spud with the wheel wells).

think Ill have to experiment a little more, but I need a motor, pushing sucks, even more with bindings. :sweat_smile:

p.s.: when I went out later that day I managed to wheelbite twice, guess cause I got more confident and tried a little harder. good news is that apparantly you can get out of these bindings quick enough to avoid pain, bad news is wheelbite. :crying_cat_face: so either even larger risers (got 1/4" rubber right now), or 50° calibers.

guess any cheap 14-18V charger will do - it somehow gotta withstand the constant shorting though. basically when I close the copper bar circuit, the supercap is unloading its whole charge into the spot welding points and the charger is basically briefly shortened. recharging of the cap then takes about 3-4 seconds!

possibly you can put a resistor between charger and supercap to be a little easier on the charger, but then recharging might take even longer! :sleeping:

dunno, I never really wanted to go backwards with a board and its cool to just hit max brake for when you want to fixate a board thats already standing still for example. this should be much harder with reverse function. doesnt happen often, but more often than driving backwards for me. :yum:

think its braking regeneratively until the motor reaches low enough erpm to switch direction:

_“Max ERPM at full brake” (should change the name…) is the highest opposing RPM at which a direction change is allowed. Setting this too high will cause cogging when moving in one direction and giving high throttle in the other direction. On my longboard I have it at 300 and my RC car has it a bit higher._

Thanks you so much for the info. I really needed a cheap welder cause I only plan to use it only a few times for batteries. It looks very simple but effective! I will totally make one. Here's two questions. To operate the switch would I just quickly push it down and then release? Also should I wear gloves when working with the charges capacitor?

EDIT: Though of another question. How often should I recharge the capacitor when welding? Keep it fully charged or does it even matter?

yea, Im stomping my foot on the copper bar and release right away. basically the weld point is eating the energy 0.5*C*U^2 (energy stored in a capacitor) instead of a constant voltage pulse with a well defined time like a "normal" spot welder.

if the energy is well tuned, youll have a nice spot - its the same for normal spot welders: youll have to choose the time length of the pulse appropriately.

the capacitor needs to be recharged after every pulse, since the whole stored energy is used for the spot welding.

in the endless sphere thread there is a short youtube video of me welding - basically the recharger is directly hooked up to the supercap -> pulse for welding -> charger starts charging right away since its essentially shortened.

its probably a little easier with a well defined pulse spot welder that is hooked to a large energy reservoir like a battery. if the energy 0.5*C*U^2 isnt approriate, then your weld spots will suck. I was lucky enough to find a good C and U. you can still fine tune that energy with the cap loading voltage (careful, it enters the energy squared!) or additional parallel caps! :slight_smile:

I found these instructions on how to do a similar built to yours but with the addition of a silicon controlled rectifier in cause anyone is confused about how to hook up a welder like this. The scr is unnecessary cause your version of the switch works just as well and is much cheaper. I will definitely give your version a try cause the only thing I need is the capacitor and the wire.

yea, softer bushings help with comfort! I might go softer if I find that I go a lot slower with the spud. the 87/93A krank barrels is a consequence of max speed 45kph and average carving speed around 30kph.

tried a lot of bushing duros - trucks quickly feel too soft for me and also quickly too hard (at least from a purely barrel perspective). cones never worked for me for anything :smile:

either its me getting more confident on the board, or I had my head free of the gorgeous carving of my vanguard OR calibers just suit me better than these extremely smooth ronins ... my conclusion: even in 44+6° caliber setting, it was a very fun and also stable ride. ran the spud down a 15% slope a few times, carving was a little more extreme and with higher frequency than the raceboard like vanguard swings, was able to slow down the board more like that though - last bit of the slope I opened up to get some speed - probably up to 45kph and it didnt really feel shaky like on my first night with the ronins. board is somewhere in between my gbomb 60°/20° pump setup and my tesseract and it definitely helps my confidence to know that I cant wheelbite. :relaxed:

was a suprisingly smooth ride too - stiff board and kegels, couldve been a lot worse. Im not actually sure yet why it didnt feel worse .. :ghost:

thumbsup, now I need my alien order! :alien:

@whitepony This is such beautiful and interesting build. Your CF skills are amazing. Definitely one of the most appealing, intriguing and well executed street builds I have seen so far. Give me one of these, and one of @longhairedboy's boards, and I'd probably quit the DIY thing and be a happy rider.  

I'm really wanting to try some of those bindings now. I bet if you came up with a lightweight CF version of those, you could sell enough to put an American kid through half a semester of college, aka, a ridiculous amount of money. 

Keep up the great work, and excellent documentation of your builds. Always a pleasure to see what you're up to next. :thumbsup:

its funny that you say that ... Ive been thinking the last few weeks and months about spending more time buildings things for others.

had a lot of requests about various things - carbon, boards, enclosures and a lot about batteries. Ive sold a few evolve carbon batteries with reasonable profit that funded at least one build.

but then I see people like chaka & jason, openly arguing with impatient customers who break things all the time because they dont know about all the details and things you probably shouldnt do. or going down the 3rd party way, fiddling with chinese to make stuff cheap. its all things I wouldnt want to do at all!! so I feel I am a lot better off by just making things for myself and keeping it a hobby :relaxed:

small updates during waiting: 

decided to give the battery a wrap in 2mm thick felt to protect it a little better from vibrations and impacts:

shrink tubed and added felt to the enclosure as well. you can see the new early march vesc order from enertion that finally arrived - one with 2 caps, the other with 3! curious how they will perform ... my very first vesc was a china enertion vesc thats the only one that hasnt died on me yet! :smile:

and ah well, I didnt want to do it, but since I wanted to clean bushings & pivot anyway, put the motor on heelside and switch to foc I finally stole the tesseract trucks, mount, motor and wheels for the spud. poor tesseract, not sure if ill keep riding it with vanguard and spud around. it rides so well, but the vanguard is just doing basically everything better. :pensive:

plan for now is: when my aps mount arrives, my project will be to make it work with the cronins, then Ill take the enertion mount and re-use it on the tesseract. :relaxed:

anyway, abecs, no wheelbite, love satin red rum, rspec for now, setting it up with foc later! :heart_eyes:

back in march when I ordered it was 2 enertion vescs for the price of 1 german vesc with the note that they will ship from europe, ie no customs. so, even though I wanted to support the europe/german guys, I had a hard time just paying double the amount.

so when I finally got the enertion vescs after a few months delay, they shipped from australia, i.e. I had to pay 51€ customs. and now, ontop of that, one isnt working, both have crappy 50V caps and the receiver pins point right at 42V. :joy_cat:


bottom line: I feel pretty stupid now for not buying a tested high quality vesc in germany. :smile_cat:

there is no real advantage, in this case even a disadvantage because I would rather use a 44° truck angle ... but 50s isnt too bad actually. :slight_smile: 

problem is: 1/2" risers are never made from rubber, at least I couldnt find them in my online skateshops - but I wanted rubber shockpads for some additional damping. these angled risers were made from rubber and their large side is 1/2".

now, they add 6° to a truck, i.e. if you take a caliber 44 with that riser, its as if you got a caliber 50s with a 1/2" riser. BUT: the riser is made from rubber and somehow the angled one looks a LOT better than a comparable 1/2" flat riser. and there is your advantage :smile:

ah, nice, looks very soft with 60A, that should help with damping!

you probably need 1.25" or maybe even 1.5" bolts. think it worked for me with 1.25" because the spud isnt very thick! most likely getting away with 1" bolts for the slim side of that riser. but I can only speculate! that angled riser is apparantly 5/8" at the thick and 1/8" at the thin side!

bolts dont cost anything anyway and its something thats always good to have in your skateboard treasurebox, so just buy some sets! :smiley:

argh, Im dead! :skull_crossbones:

did my maidens ride, was giving myselfs mental highfives the whole time, board rides really good, even stable to my max 45kph, carved pretty nicely and its suprisingly soft and well damped which I still dont understand!! no rattling at all and FOC also works well on the rspecc, especially at trick speed (read: VERY SLOW!!!) - then I found a school with a nice schoolyard and the 13yo boy in me immediately rode in there and practiced ollies, 180s and wheelies with current control in both directions. had a BLAST I gotta say ... 

... until my motor with mount came off. :laughing: one of the clamp screw got loose somehow and I finally lost it somewhere, the other held the clamp tight for a while, but finally bent from the impacts which eventually sealed the deal.

fuck, and all that at 30degree and 10km off home. :tired_face: I went to the next closest house, asked for some tools to take the mount off (cause I didnt find the 2nd screw), then I pushed home and took a shower. :sweat_smile:

must say, overall Im really happy - that board rides as good as the tesseract and, even though the spud is stiffer, its somehow taking rough pavement a lot better and I JUST DONT GET IT. it carves really well and the bindings while carving are giving a really cool locked in feeling - a little like a raceboard. what I loved most was, that you can now lean not only with bringing weight to your heel or toes, but also by applying pressure with the arch of your foot. great feeling!

and well, the small tricks I made - jumped a few sidewalks with 20kphish, but felt a little shaky still, so I focused on practicing clean ollies, but thats really something for slow speed for now until I feel more confident! :slight_smile: 

by the way: the board weights basically 7kg! I blame the heavy flywheels and the bindings! it feels quite nice on the feet though, much better than my 13kg trampa!

we always kept in touch and he sent me some for free <3 Ill measure the diameter of the APS mount later if you want - its slightly larger than torques V2 mount, maybe by 1-2mm!

motor facing rear will surely work, but I dont want that due to stealth reasons. sadly it seems very hard to shave something off the cronins at that part of the truck, so that wont really work unless we talk about 1-2mm. tomorrow my APS order arrives - then Ill try max length APS motor mount with okp adapters and see if I get out far enough ... and whether I then still got enough clearance so that the motor wont hit the enclosure. :yum:

looks like its 29.7 or probably just 30mm - ill measure the mount itself tomorrow when I got it!

where are you from? could forward you a few! on the other hand i think i found a quite elegant way of making my own, bit simpler than okps way with a stainless steel or aluminum pipe and epoxy! will post about that later this week once i tried it! 

problem is that okps adapters are for 9mm and you need them further towards the kingpin for 15mm belts (basically 6mm :joy: ).

and there is the problem of torqueboards adapters: you simply need the largest possible diameter, because the ronins become very thick towards the kingpin. 28mm wont do, 30mm maybe.

btw, its not for the spud, but for my vanguard! :slight_smile:

@Adam0311 do it, its a ton of fun for just a few bucks and it allow hours and days practicing stuff!

I'm in California in the US and that would be great I'll pay shipping cost. Or I want to see how you epoxy some adapters on I think aligning them will be difficult but if anyone can do it its you. I actually hacked one ronin truck pretty bad and the mount is a little angled.

I'm going dual so 9mm should be fine I actually have something planned to fix this but I don't want to get ahead of myself.

I kinda figured it was for the vanguard because I'm thinking there is no way you'll see benefits on a small deck I plan to build a 33-34 inch wheelbase board

you should probably wait till the weekend - I think making a cronin adapter is actually quite simple - even with perfect alignment!

basic idea was to take a 30mm diameter pipe (for the APS mount) with a very thin material thickness:
* stainless steel for looks (fits my cupped precision washer looks well) http://www.ebay.de/itm/141285845586 
* or aluminum http://www.ebay.de/itm/181078135930 
and these actually come in precut lengths of 2.5cm which fits the application really well - that way they can be used for 9 and 15mm at the same time and still have enough room for adjustments!

aligning the pipe with the roning truck isnt that hard - the trucks have one fairly straight edge and Ill stick 2 identical pipes on both ends and attach an aluminum angle from my old builds to both pipes, which aligns them among each other and makes them basically perfectly straight! Ill shoot some fotos once I did it:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/66c87095fe4a06535c25994a5a02948fdc3013b4.jpg" width="621" height="500"> 

get the pipe as far towards the kingpin as possible (which isnt actually that far, because the ronins get thick very quickly - which also makes it important that the wall thickness of the pipe is very thin), close it up at one end with plastilin and fill the room between truck and pipe with epoxy from the other side. then just leave it on there, no need to have a removable truck adapter really.

I might add aluminum powder to the epoxy to increase the heat conductance of motor -> mount -> truck and to increase the viscosity, which probably makes it a little easier to fill the pipe and to deal with potential leaks!

how hot have you gotten the motors?  
how are you doing with the lg hg2 and what's your battery limit set to?  I'm going to do 12s4p with them and I'd like to enjoy my 70/70 limits on both vescs that i'm doing now with lipo and hoping the cells can do it...said to be 80 continuous from the cells but I noticed the jump in power from 60/60 to 70/70 on both my vescs.and cant go back!  My wattmeter showed a max of 50 from the batteries when I had one but when I bumped the vescs up i noticed..I wouldn't have thought even 60/60 was obtainable.  maybe it's just the motor side increase that's really doing it.

really like the look of that spud board with bindings.  I wouldnt think I'd like bindings, Id be afraid of getting stuck when I need to get a food down quickly, but other than that I bet they give a lot of control.

I failed a few 180s and easily got out of the bindings before I fell. I also had wheelbite twice and made it out in time! I was suprised how easy it is to get out!

about the currents: I ran 70A Motor, 50A battery to take it easy on the vesc - so far this feels good to me!

charging port will be 2x 3.5mm bullet connectors, glued into the enclosure with resin (havent done that yet).

this is my tesseract where 2 ports are a "loop key" and 2 ports are +- for charging (4mm bullet connectors). Ill take a picture later from my vanguard where I used 3.5mm bullets with a waterproof switch).

http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/tesseract_rework_oncemore%20-%2012.jpg

the charging wires are parallel wires to the main battery +- which are hooked up to antispark -> vesc, so the vesc can be switched off (not that it would matter for charging).

it doesnt really replace an antispark. basically you cut the "+" connection from battery to ESC, solder to both ends a female bullet connector and thats basically my first picture. 

now you switch on the vesc by connecting female "+" with female "+" by a double male short "key". easy and it will spark :yum:

sadly my alien antispark is dead so I still cant ride the board, but bruno already posted a new one, so probably next week! nevertheless, I prepared the enclosure now for charging and on/off switch and since we just talked about it here the results:

drilled 3 holes, 2 for 3.5mm bullet charging connectors in thick glued shrink tube and one for the simple on/off toggle switch that triggers the antipark. from inside and outside, the on off switch is sealed with a rubber ring and outside its a whole rubber condome which makes the whole bunch, +- and on/off actually waterproof. the enclosure will later be sealed with double sided adhesive tabe before its screwed on which, in sum, makes the electronic package pretty resilient against any splashes!
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_89.jpg

I fixated all 3 with sugru, which is a pretty funky material - not very cheap, but it came in a pack of 3 and I still had 1 left after tesseract and vanguard :slight_smile:

I painted them. How nervous were you in routing out the LHB style wire channels? I did the channels on my only other complete build (still need to make a build thread), but it was a much thicker deck. I'm a bit nervous in cutting into the spud...especially since I'll be using a Dremel and hammer/chisel rather than a proper router.

love the paintjob, they look great in matte black! wouldve been maybe abit easier compared to cutting out vicious griptape :smile:

about the routing: not very nervous, you gotta be really clumsy to actually break through the deck somewhere, especially with a dremel. my only advice is: take your time, patience is always the key! :relaxed:

if you go with 12AWG wires, you dont need to dig very deep anyway, maybe 4mm, thats just 2-3 plys!

why is that spud white btw? mine came in all black :open_mouth:

Thanks! Was thinking transparent or a cutout design of some sort. I'm curious, did you consider a sensored motor set up for your freeboard? Seem's like it might be helpful with low speed acceleration or taking off from stop signs/lights without messing with popping out of the bindings for a kick push. Thats my theory anyway.
```

## \#202 Posted by: whitepony Posted at: 2016-08-12T04:32:13.826Z Reads: 632

yea, I had the exact same thoughts and I think sensored could be really great for a board that might potentially stop and reaccelerate a lot. 
I simply didnt feel like thinking about that sensor cable and how to reach the vesc safely without longterm wear that might screw things up ... plus I always cringe whenever I pull the throttle at low speed, because I know how much load it puts on your components. 

In the end it worked out well, because you get a lot easier in and out of the bindings than you think! for tricks, I needed some constant soft outward pressure to prevent slipping out.

gah, hopefully british royal mail will be here before the weekend, I really want to ride the spud again. that initial 10km before the motor came off was such a teaser!! :sweat_smile:

I ran the spud this weekend for 3 charges. since I still dont have my antispark switch, I just hardwired battery to vesc, closed the enclosure and left the vesc running while riding and charging for 2 days kinda. ;)

10S3P is quite ok, but I still like 10S4P better. :smirk_cat:

suprised about the high speed stability - managed 48kph with fully charged battery and it felt stable. not cantellated tesseract stable, but stable nevertheless.

what I still dont get is the smooth riding - my feet are pretty much right ontop of the trucks and the board still feels soft, even on rough ground. just weird :no_mouth:

must say, hats off to okp, it takes cojones to jump high at 15kph+, because concrete is simply very very hard and any canting could potentially hurt quite a lot. carefully approaching my limits from the right side of "hurt" right now. pretty spoilt from wakeboarding I think ... on water, you can simply do just about anything :stuck_out_tongue:

I love your wiring job. Everything is very neat and tidy. I have a few questions.

1. Are you using 12 gauge wire on everything?
2. Where did you get the "thick" heatshrink? What size are you using? 
3. Can you show me how you are going to wire that on/off switch with the anti spark connector?

Thanks!

[/quote]

12AWG are the thinnest wires I use in my builds - my 10S4P batteries have 10AWG connections until vesc, then 12AWG to motor.
for this 10S3P and 60A max, I thought I could get away with 12AWG, so its consistently 12AWG for all wires.

the thick heatshrink is from ebay - just search for shrink tube with glue - most of these have pretty thick walls too. there are really insanely thick 1:3 shrink tubes with crazy glue inside. the things you shrink tube with those will stay like that forever. :stuck_out_tongue: 


the wiring of that antispark is really simple. usually these kind of antisparks (like torqueboards or alienpowersystems) come with 4 wire power switches - 2 wires for LED power (so the switch glows in some color), and 2 for the switch:

Hi Withepony,

I am new to this forum and just noticed your Jet Spud Build using vaccum bagging technology. I love your build! Now, I would also like to try vaccum bagging. The only step I am missing in your description is the process of putting in the resin. did you use a spiral to infuse the resin or how is it done? Sorry for this most probably simple question, but I really can't figure out how you did it since I didn't see a second tube where the resin should go into the vaccum bag. Also, how long did you leave the pump running (24h)?

Thanks for your help!

your issues will come from many areas if you follow my riding style. You need to keep it light but strong which is somehow a bit challenging as we use what we have available today.

- motors : your shaft will move on the cage (due to the front/back rolling stuff), you may also unstick the magnets 
- trucks : you'll bend your trucks axles in no time if you go hard on it
- battery : use 3M and make sure you got ultra strong and tight/secure fit on the deck

that's pretty about it, enjoy !

mmm it depends on your ability to jump with weight. Be also aware that for big gaps, you'll need to have a good balance on the board (in the air). For example, you feel in the air that the board tends to go tail down (because of the motors). I'm looking to film a big 10 stairs gap in the next weeks and I'll try to keep the board as light as possible. With 10S3P you can already get a good miles coverage. 10S4P will give you more discharge; so depends on what you are looking for.

@okp is the man! I can't come close to his craziness, but even at 42 years old and about 20lbs overweight, I have no trouble jumping curbs or the odd branch in the road. My board weighs about 12lbs. ![image|375x500](upload://gg3iitSmI4cpZfL55mNgqPPpdyr.jpeg)![image|669x500](upload://8mVlwoAlO3I98xkapLZs8vUnU55.jpeg)

hey bro, I went to a kitesurfing trip than I had to be careful not to get injured before going to Brazil last nov 2017. Since then, it has been raining all day long, snowing in Paris with freezing cold temp and I had a little baby to take care off while doing a full time job and some fun stuff at UNiK as an hobby. I'll go for it for sure.I'll show you the gap

stupid hard foam
[/quote]

Hey, i know it's been a long time since this build but i hope you can tell me which "stupid hard foam" you used for this and i think you also used it on your first vanguard build. Is it polyurethane foam?

Edit: its industrial xps foam, you mentioned it a few posts further.

I read another post about building foam core boards that uses divinycell h80 foam as a core material. I believe that is a pvc foam with a density of 5lb/ft3.

I don't want to use for the core, just as a mold. 
Don't really know other types of foam :sweat_smile:

then fixating the wires with some scotch tape and folding the battery like a butterfly. the minus wire is running in the channel made by the 20 serial connection nickel strips (that I covered with thick adhesive tape)

Realising you are not as active as you once were, and that I am asking about a 2 year old process on a now sold board (wow I look like a stalker) - but... I am making a very similar battery to this one, and wondering what sort of tape you used to wrap and cover the 'inner' serial connections - does it have to be particularly heat resistant / fire retardant?

I have kapton tape to secure balance leads and am putting fish paper between these and the cells to avoid them rubbing against any nickel/batteries, but haven't got anything for the middle.
