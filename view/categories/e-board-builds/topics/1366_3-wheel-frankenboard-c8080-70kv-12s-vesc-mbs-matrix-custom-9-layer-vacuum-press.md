Hello eSK8'ers, my name is Jason but most call me Jay. Jaybird is a nickname I was given years ago due to my inebriated inclination to climb up on things and perch.

I make a living doing renovation/handyman work in Toronto. As of a few years ago, my electrical competence was limited to matching the wire colours on a car stereo install, testing voltage, etc. Basic stuff. This is also partly the reason my first 3 wheel board build was with an off the shelf hub motor kit. 

My understanding has grown, but I still have a brain spasm trying to follow some of the technical commentary here and on endless sphere. 
My thanks to anyone that contributes to these open source information resources. Invaluable :)


**Plan/motivation**- 

-I don't want a "last mile" commuter, I want an "all the miles" commuter. 

-I want something that is stable at continuous high speeds and can cut from road to grass to gravel trail without protest or superman face plants. 

-1hr hard carving ride time. Most days I have to drive to work with tools, so this is for fun after work or the odd commute if my tools are onsite already.

-Powerful enough that I can swap a smaller sprocket to get up around 40mph, throw on my downhill mountain bike armor and try and get onto a gokart track for some racing. 

-Experiment-have fun-go faster.


**Details/specs**-

*Board*- 
Custom, 9 layer Canadian maple with a RockitLam veneer base. Vacuum bagged myself with a kit from Roarockit. I will burn a design or image into the top veneer and then coat with west system epoxy or boat spar varnish. The battery and VESC will be underneath. Battery casing, undecided.

*Front truck/wheels*- 
Older MBS Matrix Lite mountain board truck with modified spring position. I moved them inboard about 3/4" iirc. Leans deeper now than the Trampas on the other build. 
9x3.5-4 tires on Trampa Primo hubs with Abec 5's.

*Rear wheel*- 
90/65-6.5 tubeless mini moto (68t or 47t sprocket)

*Motor*-
Single 80mm 70kv sensored from chinese distributor.
5kw  max, 70v max, 85 amps cont., 8mm shaft. (12t or 16t)

*Controller/Battery/Transmitter*
I have not ordered these yet. I have been emailing with Jeremiah from Ollin Board Co. regarding a VESC with heat sink, a custom 12s5p pack and a Badwolf V2.

*Mounts* - motor and wheel-
Started out as 3x3 1/4" steel window lintel. I don't have a machine shop, so a workmate in the back alley with an angle grinder, drills, belt sander and files does the job for now.

**Now some pics**-

HolySh!t! This is what I want to see. More mountain boards builder!
That motor is huge man, haha. Btw why not using hub motor? I believe some chinese manufacturer have 5inch ++ hub motor already. Anyway it's a cool build, looking forward in it!

Thanks. :smile:  

I have not looked into what is available with smaller hub motors lately. The last build was with a 16" Magic Pie 3 from golden motor. It was a tank... tail heavy. Even with a smaller hub (which would be a power sacrifice) the weight would be tail heavy. The the outrunner mounted inboard and batteries under and forward, hopefully will get closer to 50/50 weight distribution. Plus rc motor/sprockets make for easier speed/power tuning...

I saw this build in Youtube, so you're the one who made it! Really awesome with the mechanical brake of mountainboard. I was actually from a mountainboard shop inspired by this project see if I could eventually attach a proper brake for my longboard / mountainboard. Until now I still have dilema wether I should go for mountainboard / longboard haha.

For what is great about this build is that you only need 1 motor and 1 esc and 1 mount which makes it cheaper in terms of build. Theres no need for differential as the load are being pushed by 1 single mid tire. Have 2 brakes in the front makes it more safe in braking. Since it's a mountainboard battery can be placed on top because feet is locked in place, so more ground clearance. Also bigger tires to run over anything on it's way. I mean this is superior in alot of ways, only portability is the main issue here. But definitely looking forward for your new build. Expecting more awesome video as well!

Very cool! I like the design (Polaris Slingshot for your feet) and am curious what the weight of your last build was as well as the range & battery build/specs.
I am of the mindset that I would rather carry a little lighter board with a swap-able spare battery in my backpack/office/truck and have two ten mile batteries than one 20 mile on the board to make it more nimble under my feet. I think it would be safer too. (think Ferrari: light, powerful, quick, runs out of gas at 200 miles, but fun 200 miles!)
I could definitely see some carbon or glass work to reduce the weight once you are happy with the design.

This forum is awesome, in daily life if I start talking details and specs like this, people glaze over. Whereas you guys are already getting to conclusions I have not even discussed with anyone yet. :) cool.

**@laurnts** 1 motor/esc/mount was part of the thought process on this build. Keep the complexity down to a minimum. 
Initially this build will be no bindings and under mounted battery. But that may evolve after testing. 
I can understand why some people want a light long board based commuter. It fits their needs. But given the technology available to get creative with builds, I am a little surprised more people aren't doing stuff like this. 
So, are you planning a mountainboard build then?

**@MonsterCoatings**  Thanks. The last build came in at almost 55lbs(25 kilos) and over 50"(1.4m) long. The battery on it is 48v 10ah LiFePo4 ebike. I never got a chance to push the range. The guy I built it for is heavier than me, 220lbs(100 kilos) approximately. He claims over 2hrs on dirt/gravel bike paths, but I have no proof of this.
I will probably build an e-longboard at some point just for the variety, but I see it less as a Ferrari and more go kart. The high speed characteristics are what I'm after. Speed wobbles should not be an issue with 3 wheels. Toronto roads are nasty, so the pneumatic wheels will help there. I have had some scary close calls on my longboard around here...

"I could definitely see some carbon or glass work to reduce the weight once you are happy with the design."
I already have more veneers/carbon fiber/epoxy for this exact reason ;)

Yes I am still looking for the opt for transforming my longboard into a mountainboard setup. Not planning to make 2 EV at the moment as I don't have budget to spend. But lately I feel like doing so as riding longboard in the park feels more pleasing rather than on the road where you got look out for bad mood police that will try to take your board away :smiley: 

Anyway from safety perspective, the brakes really. The brakes I want that mechanical brakes compared to electric brake. I mean regenerative braking is nice, but how much can you really get from it. I never seen any1 test how much it actually regen. Might be 1% - 5% effectiveness I assume, It be happy if someone shows how much distance to recharge certain amph. For me the brakes and bigger wheels are the deal breaker. Especially here in NL we have tram lines as well as slippery road from constant rain, big pneumatic wheel that you can pump hard or soft makes difference.

**@sonic1** Your right, I should have said that the limit or onset of wobbles for this should be higher... I have thought about adding in an adjustable stabilizer if I run into that limit.

**@laurnts** It did inspire more confidence knowing I had the mechanical brake there in case of regen brake failure. Also it smoothed out the braking a bit. Felt less on/off. My first test ride was only regen and the rear wheel locked up, sketchy. In combination worked great. 
Some of the coolest people I met backpacking were from NL. I have never been. My sister might be moving there in the fall...

The weather has been to cold and snowy for work outdoors, so I added something cosmetic. I have enjoyed drawing these Archimedean spirals since I was a kid. 
I drew it in pencil, then went over it with a pen style iron and used the edge of a handsaw as a straight edge.

I have just placed an order with chaka (Jeramiah) at Ollin Board co.
Badwolf V2 tx/rx and a heat sinked VESC. 

Other than that, no real progress. 

*Off topic-
I did take advantage of some nice weather recently with my dog and rc car... :) I have a 1/16 traxxas r/c that I rigged up a detachable flag and gopro. Super fun...

Just picked up a lightly used pair of lipos. I wanted to order larger 8000+ size packs but Canada has a thing about importing individual batteries over 100wh :/  

Found this pair localy, 10 cycles on them with the 700e heli mounting tray. 
They are Great Hobbies in house brand. 
6s 5000mah 35c
144x57x46mm 780g
http://www.greathobbies.com/productinfo/?prod_id=TGHL50006C35

I have not decided on the exact layout yet. I might cut the heli tray in half so I can mount them parallel. 
@chaka is finishing assembly on my vesc order. 
Once all my parts are here I can really get to business.

The price was ok, and they are balanced in storage for the moment. I just need them to get this board going. Hopefully they do the job until I find something better.

Had some sun, got some paint and varnish done. 

Wheel brackets, motor mount and chain tensioners. Two coats of black wheel paint, 2 coats of clear. Quick job, far from perfect, but they will work.

The board is now curing its second and final coat of boat spar varnish. First coat was diluted 5-10% with paint thinner. (Pics are before the quick 320 grit sand and second coat.)

woah, same principle as sequential turbos... yea, I like were your heads at!
That is doable, replace the brake rotor with another sprocket... parallel motors. Adds complexity, but might be worth experimenting with. Would allow for shorter board length as well.

Can't claim the idea - may want to refer to @lowGuido

uneven dual drive
this involves the combination of a big motor and a small motor (in power not size)
this is like a twin turbo high speed boost super fast!
pros: low end torque combined with high end speed, super fast!!
cons: expensive, heavy, still only roughly equivalent to single drive torque.

I have more veneer and carbon fiber. I am going to laminate up a few more decks and experiment with length and stiffness. At some point, maybe next year if there is the interest, I want to offer anything from uncut pressed decks to rolling chassis minus motor/electronics. I will have to find someone to machine the mounts. 
Get some other builders on this platform and things would get interesting. If someone just wanted a deck uncut or shaped, I could probably hook them up earlier than that.

theres a whole thread about UDR drive 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/uneven-dual-rear-drive/113

its the real deal.. the UDR board has been up and running with no side effects for some time now.

That is a very cool. No side effects? huh.  That is some fine experimenting lowGuido :)  
It would be interesting to compare the powerband vs effiency of 1 large motor vs 2 UDR at the same wattage.

I received a package today from @chaka Ollin Board Co. It all came well protected and undamaged.

My beefy new vesc (this thing is 10 awg in and out.) Nice one Jeramiah :)

I ran motor detection and linked up the transmitter. Worked great. 5 amp fuse to start, then 10 amp. I used a hacked xbox 360 power supply that is good for 12v @16 amps.

Milestone update:
It has been ridden :smile:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6nIX1dQ-bk&feature=youtu.be
My gut-sensor feels like it was over 40kph(25mph) by a ways. The e-board calculator feels accurate with 45kph projected.

I ended up putting the batteries on top of the deck, between the feet. The pair of 6s 5000's are just to thick to squeeze under. Especially with a loss of 1/2" or so of ground clearance in the front due to the fact that I had to swap over to my spare 8" front wheels. The one 9" inch tube won't hold air. 
I have still run the motor wires and vesc under the board, but had to cover that sweet design on the board with some industrial velcro. As well as drill a 1" hole for wires.  I used a chunk of rubber shower gasket material and taped it over the vesc for the test to protect from debris. I slapped some scrap grip tape on that I had around.

I charged the lipos up to around 4.17 average per cell (just to be a bit safer) with my HiTec dual charger. Total pack voltage at start 50.1v and after 20-30 minutes of running they were at 44.54v or 3.71/cell.

Here are some shots of the wiring. 
I chopped short the stiff, lower strand 12awg motor wires and extended them with higher strand 12awg with lash splice. This connects to the @chaka VESC 10awg motor wires with included bullets.

The series harness was done in 8awg simply because I grew impatient waiting for my last delivery which contains the 10awg wire. I stripped the ends of the 8awg down to 10/12 just to make soldering easier with my shite iron.

Bitter sweet update:

New 5 minute video with some pole cam action shots.

That is the length of the entire ride though. A few strands in the motor decided to give up and throw themselves in between the rotating assembly :expressionless:

I will be contacting the chinese manufacturer to see about warranty. No more riding videos for a bit. I might be ordering a new motor in the meantime. I want to learn to rewind a motor. But this is sooner than expected.

I sure hope not, but possible. 
I am not going to modify/shorten the motor wires this time. Maybe heat from soldering the overkill lash splices so close to the motor effected things. 
I will wire up the hall sensors this time, maybe better motor communication will help. 
Maybe slightly more conservative amp maximums in bldc tool as well.
We will see...

I guess if it happens again you could just cut those fray wires. Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. You could try to heat up the stator and coils so you can anneal the copper. I'd just take the motor apart to not ruin the magnets and heat it up to a decent temp. It'll let the copper relax a little more.

Or maybe try adding some type of glue..... Not sure about that tho

Very cool project . You've inspired me to build something similar . What is actually the driving behavior of the new board compared to the old? is it better worse? I know unfortunately the engine is broken and you can not drive. what does your feeling say? and particularly interested me is the new design lighter than the old ( 25kg ) one ?

It is definitely smoother than urethane. The roads can be pretty nasty here in Toronto. The pneumatic tires add way more confidence to the ride.

Yeah? Nice one. Are you planning to build the board from scratch, or modify off the shelf?

This board feels better. It is four or five inches shorter than the last and the turning radius is noticeably improved. The smaller, lighter drive wheel means it snaps back edge to edge quicker. That being said, I won't be pressing anymore decks that are so flexible. It feels like some of the steering response is lost to twisting flex. Chain tension is also affected. The next deck will have some carbon fiber. 
I have not weighed it yet, but after carrying it, I would say at least 5kg lighter. I will have to borrow/buy a scale...

Wow @WickAlpha, that sounds like a very technical build. Will it be running 18650s? Have you started a build thread yet? I am looking forward to following your build.

I have seen the triborg before. From the videos it seems to ride nicely, but zero points for the aluminum brick styling. There has to be at least a little form in with the function.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z9CY9yu34Q

I have been busy working on a trailer and travel plans. We are road tripping out west into the Rocky Mountains in B.C. 
Picked up a used 5x8 Wells Cargo trailer a few weeks ago. Put a 90 watt monocrystalline solar panel on the roof, running to a 15 amp dc circuit breaker, to a charge controller and finally 12v 250ah AGM battery. There is a 600w modified sine inverter and a 12v socket in the rear. Basic electronics, tool battery chargers, lipo charger, etc. Our dry-camping will be limited only by water... :)  Leaving in a week.

hey @jaybird your board looks really awesome!

when building your board how did you work out the angel you needed at each end? are they both the same?

I looked at the Roarockit boards but it's still expensive for a board you have to make yourself? is there a cheaper way?

which kit did you get?

Sorry for the lack of updates, the Frankenboard has not been used in a while. We have been working and traveling in some remote areas on the west coast of British Columbia and the "roads" combined with constant rain have made it unfriendly to eboarding. 
I will have some time this spring to re-work a few things on it though. I am going to strip it down and add two or three layers of carbon fiber to the top to stiffen it up. The current flex is causing issues with chain tension/alignment and high speed stability. I also need to re-seat the bead on the rear tire and fab up covers for batteries/vesc.

@nonstop The angles of the board are roughly the same 43-45*, but the radius of the bend in the tail is softer.
I have the longboard vacuum kit with the off-center nozzle, so it does not leave a mark in the center of the board when your laying carbon fiber. I bought the veneers in person at Roarockit in Toronto, so I could pick my own specific cross and long-grains.

@lrdesigns Thanks. Nothing lately, but hopefully soon... :slight_smile:
