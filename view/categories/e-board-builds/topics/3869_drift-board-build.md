Hello Everyone,

I've posted a wanted ad here as I'm looking to get two 50mm to test a new concept.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/two-50mm-motors/3864

Now that the skate cycle is well on its way, what I'd really like to build is a board that can drift. When I say drift, I mean like a real car. I want both real wheels spinning with minimal traction so the back end slides out and then the front end controls direction (For the most part). In order to make this happen, what I'm envisioning is a board with a pivot in the middle, so that steering can be controlled not only by leaning, but also by rotation of the front or rear foot. Similar to how you steer a skatecycle or a snakeboard. Except I think I only need one pivot point as opposed to two. To get a good drift, both rear wheels need to be spinning and I was thinking of putting some abs piping over the wheels to reduce traction. The front wheel(s) would also need a drive mechanism as they would essentially be what is propelling the board forward to sustain a drift. The rear wheels will provide some forward momentum, but given they are going to mostly be spinning, it probably wouldn't be enough to sustain a long drift which is my goal.

I have a concept in mind to build an axle that drives both rear wheels at the same time with a belt drive from one motor.  I'm going to fab it out of old skateboard bearing, tubing and whatever else I have lying around. No idea if it will work or not...

For the front, I'm going to just do a homemade motor mount and a belt drive to keep it simple.

What do you guys think?  Is it feasible?

Sound's like you're trying to make a Lief board :stuck_out_tongue:

It's easy enough to drift a longboard anyway..ride faster and practice slides.

I've seen those and while they look like drifting, they are cheating in my opinion by using casters.  There is another non-electric one like that as well that I've seen.

I want a real drift, back tires smoking!!!!

I'm not talking about a little slide, I'm talking about a sustained drift that you control with throttle. Like formula D type stuff.

Also putting ABS over your wheels sounds like a recipe for disaster. You might just want to try to find higher durometer wheels.

Yeah you might be right with the wheels, but the reason why I said ABS initially was because there are some guys locally with electric drift trikes and they use this on the rear wheels to give them some nice sliding action.

A lot easier to balance on a sliding trike, than longboard :)

You could try front wheel drive with slippery rear wheels like they do with the electric drift trikes. Seems like the best way to control speed and slide at the same time. I might try flipping my board around backwards, reversing my motor rotation, and jam some pvc on my non-driven wheels. For science, of course. Got my wheels turning now....:laughing:

That's definitely the concept I'm going for. If you try it out, let me know how it works!

But I think a major factor in this is having a pivot in the board. The drift trike can steer independent of the sliding wheels just like cars.  The ability to countersteer while drifting is in my opinion what separates a slide from a drift.

Of course I want the rear wheels to be spinning so that I can "burn rubber" or some sort of plastic in this case haha.

Good point. Probably need to loosen the crap out of the front truck, and lean heavily to maintain directional control during the slide. Maybe even wedge the front truck for additional steering. Dammit, now I have a new project to work on...I love this shit.

please do give it a try and let us know how it goes. glad I have someone else wanting to venture down this path!

I've still got to get some motors and wait for some stuff to be sent from HK before I can get this going so might be a little whIle. ..

Don't forget though, it's gonna be front wheel drive, rear wheel slide. That's why I can't wrap my head around how this is gonna go until I try it. It works on the electric trikes, but then they can fully steer the front drive wheel. I've just got to go with loose trucks, and a lot of leaning. 

Loving all the support though. :sweat_smile:

Some drift trikes are fwd, but most aren't. Drift cars are always rwd. With rwd, you just jab the gas pedal in the start of a turn to get the back wheels sliding, and use the front wheels to control the slide. I don't see how you can control the slide with a fwd setup. 

I think you're gonna want rwd with high duro wheels. Tighten the back trucks and loosen the front. Get some speed and then kick out the back end. See if you can get sideways and bring it back in. Downhill guys do it this way. Try fishtailing under control and drifting around a corner. Don't try to reinvent the wheel with the pvc setup. That only works on trikes because they are just about impossible to flip.

I'm sure straight will be no problem....it's that first turn that may street his face (I hope not) which is the big issue...I just don't know how he's gonna be able to control the weight shift without being able to hold on...like I said monkey feet....that board is gonna whip fast when it breaks traction

The only way I can Imagin something like this working ....is if you had a really long board....the longer you have to compensate for the sliding of the board...the better chance you have on staying on the board....it has to be a long back slide like  5-6 foot board

A little progress, but now I need two things. 
1. A little smoother pavement than the asphalt in front of my house.
2. A better method for attaching the pvc to the wheels. 

A press fit with a mallot wasn't enough to keep the pvc from coming off the wheels before I could get any real sliding going. I've got a couple of my other wheels in the freezer that are a touch larger that I'm going to try press fitting cold so they expand and stay put when they warm up. I know that's still a temporary solution at best, so I'm gonna work on a plate and bolt type of setup similar to a wheel pulley. Any ideas are welcome.

That's all for now. And I will try it rear wheel drive too before all is said and done.

This is a thing of beauty.

Just ordered some paris trucks, wheels, and two 50mm motors.  Hoping to get going on this soon.

What size wheels you got there and what diameter pipe is that?

@johnny_261 Thanks! Glad you like it. This is all your fault, you know that, right? :grin:

I've got 83mm wheels and they fit pretty much perfectly inside a 3" coupler. My green ones are a little more used and like 82.5mm, but the purple ones (in the freezer) are pretty new and right at 83mm. That .5mm actually makes a difference.

Welcome to Sketchytown! 
Population = me (so far). 

Let's just say, it ain't gonna work like this. I ran through most of a battery trying to feel this out, and like I had suspected, the lack of a steerable front wheel is the major dream killer. Once you get going fast enough to actually get some kind of slide going, I'm guessing around 10 mph, the back wheels immediately want to slide all the way around and send you into quick SYF style 180.  Maybe someone who has better skate sliding experience could hold it longer, but even then it would still be super sketchy to somehow hold on and maintain the slide. I don't expect it to be much different with rear wheel drive, but I will probably attempt it once I get a drive pulley on to my slide wheels. If my next plan pans out...

For attempt 2.0, my plan is to flip the front trucks 180°, and maybe even wedge them to allow for more steering range. I'm hoping this will solve the main problem of not being able to steer into the slide. As it is now, if you're trying do a frontside slide, and the rear starts sliding out toeside, the only way to even try to steer into the slide is to lean toeside on your front wheels, which is really hard, and totally against your brain's natural instinct to not street it's face. Backside is obviously the same, but worse, cause now you have the potential to SYA (street your ass).

I did take some videos, but the footage is less than amazing, given the difficulty of actually maintaining a slide, but I'll try again tomorrow with a flipped truck and see how that goes.

@Skunk...then I electrified a drift trike with dual hub motors. Lower center of gravity, front wheel steering, stable at 25+mph...all the things the drift board was missing.
