It seems like there are many people out there that find out about the Boosted Board or Evolve but can't afford them and go looking for cheaper solutions. They often run into some offshoot Chinese brands like Koowheel or the Yuneec E-GO. That got me thinking, what would I build instead of buying one of those? I decided to write this for anyone in that position that is wondering what they can build for similar cost. The budget is 600 USD since that is what these decks usually go for, and I'm cheating a little by disregarding shipping since you'd have to pay that on a complete as well.

I'd get my parts from **Hobbyking, Amazon and Torqueboards** since they offer well tested parts at reasonable prices.

**At Hobbyking I'd get:**

**2x 5S 8000mAh Batteries**

**1x 6374 168kV Motor**

**1x GT2B Remote**

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html

**1x Turnigy B6 Compact Charger**

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-b6-compact-50w-5a-automatic-balance-charger-2-6s-lipoly.html

Before shipping these parts come out to roughly **$215 USD.** Turnigy SK3s have been used in tons of builds and seem to work fine, same with zippy batteries. The GT2B is also used quite often, and has a variety of mods to choose from if you would like to make your controller more compact. However you would need to suffer some inconvenience since the charger can only charge one of the batteries at a time. Also, to save the cost of buying a switch you could make an XT90s loop key (just search it on the forums).

**From Amazon I'd get:**

**1x Caliber 2 Trucks**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/7/77477e9c691f7b4b6f5c423197e0db8763e266d6.jpg" width="500" height="195">

**1x 83mm Flywheel Clones**

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I1WG1SE/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ABCX2RE03ARTE

These parts come out to roughly **65 USD.** You can get each of these in a variety of colors and they are an inexpensive option that is compatible with most mount and wheel pulley setups including Torqueboards hardware.

**Lastly from Torqueboards I'd get:**

**1x VESC Speed Controller**

**1x Single Motor Mount**

diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-only/

**1x Wheel and Motor Pulley Kit**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/9/d9a0e910c90d289b8ed43281f48158a764d5a73f.jpg" width="690" height="459">
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/36t-abec-drive-pulley-belt-combo-kit/

That comes out to roughly **205 USD.** Personally I use these parts and haven't had any issues so that is what I'd recommend. Make sure you choose the 16T motor pulley option, and the 63mm motor mount. Keep in mind that the connectors that come with the parts may not be perfect for each other and you'd have to solder on new ones. 

**215 + 65 + 205= 485 USD**

That leaves you with **115 USD to build or buy an enclosure and deck** along with other expenses you may encounter. In my opinion, the most important part of your build is the deck you choose, it defines how your board will ride and you can choose whatever you want to suit your style. 

For inexpensive blank decks check out www.skateshred.com and for the enclosure get creative! There are many different things you can us. Lunchboxes, small part organizers and fiberglass/carbon fiber enclosures are common.

This build's specs would be a **top speed of roughly 35km/h and a range of roughly 30km.** You'd also get to choose from any deck you'd like, and customize your wheel and truck setup. After putting it together yourself, you'd be able to fix anything that may go wrong, and on top of that you get the satisfaction of having built something by yourself, for yourself.

If I missed anything let my know and I'll update the post. Also, what would you do differently?

I like that charger very much...

Suuuupppper simple... cheapest and simplest I've found. I find it doesn't charge it to the max....but I think thats a good thing 

Biggest draw back...no read out.... but you can always double check with a 6s battery alarm monitor

hmm, at first i was skeptical at your range and speed but 10s1p 8000mah is 288 watt hours, that's actually pretty good
and 140 for deck and enclosure is plenty, considering you can get blank decks very inexpensively from wholesalers (around $40 a deck)

could those zippys be wired into a bms to make for easier charging and higher safety?

Yeah, I hadn't realized they made a compact B6 until I searched it on Hobbyking, definitely a nice option. 

Right now I'm using the same battery setup and getting lots more range than I need. Also, I forgot to mention but If you want to sacrifice a little torque for higher top speed you can get the 192kV version and bump it up to 40km/h.

Just wondering why the 168kv and not the 192kv? What will be the difference? I see allot of 10s 190kv set-ups.

I'd like to know cause I'm building a board right now and still in doubt about the motor. I'm sure I won't go fast, but I would like some nice range. What would be the better motor for that situation?

Thanks for the post.

@mptrs Good question! I just found out recently that high kv motors seem to consume more power (amps) to travel the same distance as ''stronger'' / lower kv rating motors! 

It looks like they can reach higher speed with the same voltage (compared to lower kv).. but just consume more energy in general.

I could post a recent build log from instructables.. where he used 300kv motor, had something like 40kph speed with 6s system and a boat esc! He did have pretty ''terrible'' range.. will go to look it up.

Seen that one, was a guy from Holland. Think someone wanted to buy his board and was asking if it was any good on the forum.

So low kv should be more efficient? Would be better for me than, cause I don't need high speed. But still wondering if 190kv (or 192) would be the save bet, cause it's in between. It's not really high and not really low either.

Thanks for the info tho.

There won't be a noticable difference in range between a 170 and 190 kv, if there is any.
I get the same range out of my 245's as i got from the 190's.
The motors will use pretty much the same amount of energy if geared properly.
```

## \#15 Posted by: NickTheDude Posted at: 2017-01-29T21:13:52.866Z Reads: 235

```
kV is essentially RPM per volt. So a lower kV motor will go slower than a higher kV motor on the same voltage. What you gain by lowering kV is torque. It has the exact same effect as changing your gear ratio. The difference between 168kV and 192kV is about 5km/h.

Since this is a single motor build, I sacrificed some top speed for increased torque and hill climbing ability.

The efficiency (heat generation) of the motor stays the same regardless of kV. Thus if you had a 100kV motor with 1:1 gearing, you would (theoretically) have the same results as a 200kV motor with 2:1 gearing.
```

Thanks for the info.

I'm from the Netherlands so I don't really need the hill climbing ability hehe. Not sure if I need the torque either.

But with this info I can make a more informed choice. Thanks again.

Soom good info!

@Iceni Well, but with the same gearing ratio for both motors.. you will get different torque/speed.. So shouldnt it be, that 190kv motor with, let's say 2:1 gearing would achieve better efficiency at the same speed? 

I think this is a matter of ''fine line''..

True, but if you change the gearing to maintain the same top-speed the torque output will stay the same pretty much.

Anyway, this went off topic, for a $600 build, it doesn't matter if you go with a 170 or 190, the performance will be pretty much the same, you just need to gear it differently, choose which motor is in stock/better priced.

i'm trying to find a downside to 2x of those 5s 8000mah cells but i kind of cant. 
That's a 36 volt pack at 288 watt hours, to get that with 2500mah cells you'd have to go, like, 10s3p and even then you'd be 18 short, and that's $150 worth of cells even from a wholeseller. 
Two of these zippys (at the current sale price of $37) is $74, less than half! And the 30C rating on the cells is decent too.

i guess the only annoyance would be wiring the packs up to each other and then to a BMS, but that's not too bad really, and the end result is being able to use a normal charger for them

You don't even need a BMS for them if you do the VGA port mod.

how often do these get discounted though?
also for slightly cheaper than the $148 of a 10s1p, you can get three $48 4s1ps and make a 12s1p with 355 watt hours

if you need cheap lipos you can check my post history, there's a link to a reddit thread for some price-glitched floureon packs (you can buy 12 4s 5500mah lipos for $130ish). I bought them so if the price is fixed by now i can sell you a couple for cheap (i'll check that they're balanced before i send them out but i don't know yet, but there's not a snowflake's chance i'll nee all of them)

**6s 8000mah 15c graphene packs**. slap two in series for a 355 watt hour 12s1p
The C rating is a little low, but still 120A output which is fine
also they're claiming these stay much cooler, which i believe, these could potentially last way longer than normal zippy lipo packs. 
$60 a piece means $120 total, which is a really good price for a 44.4 volt 355 watt hour pack, that's gotta be good for 25mph and 20 miles of range, with a combined pack weight of 4.8 pounds which isn't particularly light weight compared to a 12s3p 2500mah pack, but it's not that bad

hell even just one of these things is a 177 watt hour 6s, great for a low end board

Interested in what people have to say about these, price is appealing. Some other general question I have.

* Why get the misc mechanical parts from Torque instead of Enertion?
* Same goes for the VESC, why from Torque?
* I have a Mini Remote already, should I still get a GT2B?
* I was going to get a blank Freeride deck, but after looking more I'm starting to worry about flex, any cheap boards that as hard?

I went with DIY because of price, and it seems like Enertion is going to stop making mounts/pullies. However keep in mind the DIY VESC uses lower spec'd components so it would be wise to tune it on the lower side. The mini remote is fine and for decks check out www.skateshred.com, they have a nice selection.

they are pretty tight lipped on flex, but a couple things to keep in mind;

nope, I just charge them individually. 

I have a dual charger that can do 12amps (6amps each side), so it doesn't take long at all to charge them up. Eventually I am going to talk to @barajabali and get a custom mountainboard pack, but it's a little outa my budget at the moment.

@TheDrYou - 255 or 265mm is fine.

On hobbyking it says that the motor needs 12s battary. Is this true, or is 10s okay?

12s is maximum.. you would be fine doing even 4-6s.. the speed just would be reduced (and power also a bit probably)

Thanks for the reply!

Would two of these batterys work for the setup or is discharge too low?

Discharge is too low. I have used 30Cs but someones use also 20-25Cs

Loving this thread and researching my first build in this price range.  Just came across this battery having scoured Hobby King for days and researching different less pricey options:

[ZIPPY Flightmax 5200mAh 2S2P 30C Hardcase Pack (ROAR APPROVED)](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5200mah-2s2p-30c-hardcase-pack-roar-approved-de.html)

Still trying to get my head around the maths but with this being 2s2p, if I wired 4 of them up in series I'd get 8s2p right?  10800mAp (5.2Ah x 2 parallel) and 29.2v (7.2v x 4)??  So 29.2x10.8 = 315 watt hours or 31km range.  I'm sure I’ve gotten that horribly wrong but it seems like a pretty good arrangement for $100 (AUD).  Plus they're only 25mm deep and in hard cases so would make a pretty slim and robust battery.  If I connected this to something like a SK3 - 6364-190kv any ideas what my top speed would likely be?

Someone please correct me though (or move this to junk or the newb thread if I'm talking nonsense!!)

I'm pretty sure those are just 5200mAh not 10800mAh.

8s 5200mah and about 22mph depending on gearing and wheels

Aha - think I slightly over estimated that!!  Thank you.

Could this build work if you made it a dual motor setup?

Yep, you'd need to get 6354 SK3s though since two 6374s will not fit on one truck. Also you'd need a second VESC, motor, motor mount and pulley setup.

Thank you very much for the speedy and in-depth answer, I'll probably give it a try soon.

Haha sorry but last thing, would the battery you have originally listed still work with the dual 6354 SK3's? Also 50mm motor mount or 63 mm? Adding dual motors is pretty expensive as well, so do you think this single motor setup could carry someone of 220 pounds?
```

Yeah that battery would be fine. 63mm motor mount.

It would really depend on how hilly your area is. If it's relatively flat and there aren't any steep hills you're expecting it to carry you up, single motor would be fine.
