Hey, Before I started this build I just wanted to introduce myself, My name is Adam and I have been building ESK8's for almost a year now, to date I have built two boards and have been constantly updating and working on them. I used ESK8 Builders all the time when building these boards as reference but have never posted about them until now. I am now thinking of starting a new project that will be a lot more powerful and detailed than the other boards and wanted to post it so as I build it I can receive help from the community as well as Ideas to improve the design, These are the two other boards I have built;


![IMG_0407|375x500](upload://7T1ao0SdLDb7kF1RVWjdjjzRbqx.jpeg) ![IMG_0412|375x500](upload://tRGWGC0CrAi1syyJtkkqCsjQ7fH.jpeg) ![IMG_0411|375x500](upload://4pMTQfNnxC2YNbnOnb22UQfjDoA.jpeg) 

All Prices are in AUD
The parts I am currently considering (also I live in Australia so some of the prices are pretty bad due to the lack of availability in my country):

- Motors: Dual Turnigy Aerodrive SK36354 260K (Currently on sale for $62 instead of $94)
- ESC: Dual FLIPSKY FSVESC V4 50A SK8-ESC W/ BEC (Hardware V4.12) ($82)                      Purchased
- Motor Mount: Dual Turnigy Motor Mounts ($13.20 EACH, Bargain!)
- Deck: AWOL Longboard Cruiser Deck, 36 Inch ($40)
- Pulley Kits: Dual 15mm ABEC Flywheel Pulley Kit (36T Wheel Pulley, 16T Motor Pulley)
- Remote: Using the same remote as my other boards, just a generic Ebay one that works fine ($52)
- Using Fiberglass sheeting, hardener and resin for Board (All Together $100)
- Trucks: Haven't Decided (Thinking Caliber II's)
- Wheels: Think 100mm MBS Wheels though I have already used them on another board so not sure yet
- Battery: 5 x Either 5000mah Turnigy 2s or 5000mah Zippy 2s
Unsure of which battery as zippy is cheaper though I believe Turnigy is higher quality as one of my boards has a Zippy Battery and the other a Turnigy and the Zippy had a dead cell after a month and I had to replace it whereas the Turnigy cells are doing perfectly after 4 months of continuous use.
- BMS: Generic 10s BMS and a 42v Charger from ebay, I make the charging port from xt90's as it is easier and I think is just simply works better 
- XT90 Antispark Loop Key (cause its dirt cheap and easy)

My current plan for the board is to 3d print components that I design in Solidworks to create a wall around the enclosure and them stick it two the board and fiberglass over it to make it uniform with the board, thus making the enclosure a part of the board so I could make a lid that I would remote to access the electronics instead of removing the entire enclosure.

Any comments, recommendations, suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated

Hey mate,  couple of things

[quote="AdamE3399, post:1, topic:72973"]
Motors: Dual Turnigy Aerodrive SK36354 260K (Currently on sale for $62 instead of $94)
[/quote]
10s keep the motors to under 200 kv   Keeps the erpm under 4.12 limits

[quote="AdamE3399, post:1, topic:72973"]
Motor Mount: Dual Turnigy Motor Mounts ($13.20 EACH, Bargain!)
[/quote]

These are a bargain but are pretty cheap and are handed so dual drive is only possible if you go diagonal.
Whatever batteries you use have a decent c rating 40 upwards.

Is that top board running jacob hubs?

Thanks for the response, those motors are the only 6354 on hobbyking so I will have to source some motors from another site. For the price do you still think it is worth running the motors in diagonal? this doesn't negatively affect performance does it. Also I decided on Turnigy 5000mah 20c Lipos, and yes I know it is a low c rating but the other two lipos have worked in my board and I don't exoerience any sag (im assuming cause their lipos), also the hub motors are maytech, Thanks for the advice.

Also Im thinking of using these 6364 motors which are 190kv as the are also on sale for 70: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html 
And if I run the motor mounts in diagonal I should be able to fit them, my only concern is I'm wondering if the reverse mounted motor will hit the kingpin on a pair of Caliber II Forty-Four Longboard Trucks 10" Axle 44d, here the link for reference: https://www.ebay.com.au/i/183482715849?chn=ps

Dual diagonal is a tried and tested way of getting dual drive it just looks weird imo.  I like full rear drive on my stuff and it to look good.  When you go diagonal on the rear truck it looks badly thought out.  
I love the sk3 atm  my favourite motor so far by a long way.  The price point is fantastic too right now.  Go for the 6364.  Just 10 bucks more.  Choose a different mount though.  @dickyho has cheap good caliber mounts.  You could spend a bit more and get the new v5 fixed mounts from @torqueboards.  Great solid set up in front or reverse.

I used a Torqueboard Mount on my last board and there is no doubt they are amazing and a solid motor mount its just that because im in Australia it cost so much more, e.g when I bought a 5 pack of 265mm 5m belts from torquboard which only cost $25 I ended up paying $100 because of shipping and conversion rates so it isn't great value. Also I checked Dickyho and his mount seem good but his caliber models are currently out of stock.

You know what?  I am in aus too.  I ummed and ahhhed over all kinds of different stuff but in the end went with what had been around for a while.  Tb.  I still use it in all my builds.  Its false economy to go cheap.  
It just is.  Better the devil you know.  Get the complete tb 218 truck kit with the v5 and you will not have a worry.  When you want to upgrade to bigger motors it will all work.  Saving you a lot of money.  Theres lots of different stuff on the market but not much that has been around long enough to be trusted except
@torqueboards

I understand what you mean and I do agree as I have read onloops false economy post and I understand it, its just that I just went to Torquboards and it would cost 220 as apposed to 26 dollars for the mount and i have done research and the Turnigy Mounts seem to be decent quality as they are solid and made of aluminum like the TB mounts, plus im using 180mm Caliber II trucks meaning to fit 2 6364 motors i would need to run them diagonally anyway so i don't see the downside.

I think that I am going to use the Turnigy mounts in the end because I have already used a TB mount and have hub motors so I want to give them a go, plus if they don't work its only a loss of 20 bucks which is worth potentially saving 300 for a TB mount and getting it to Australia, though I will get 6364 motors instead of 6354 motors like @dareno said. Also I have ordered the Flipsky VESC's and they should be here in a week or so.

Mate I have 2 hub boards and they both are nothing compared to my belt drives.  The only hubs that will get somewhere near the performance of a decent belt drive are enertion or hummies.    Depends what you want really and the kind of riding style.  I like massive torque so hubs just don't cut it for me but if where you live is flat and you don't want a fire breathing monster then yes those 1200w motors would do you.  Completely un tested though because I don't know anyone with them.  The only hubs I would consider atm are the hummies or the maytechs because they are known and they would give me a semblance of hill climbing.  @rey8801 loves his hubs so maybe he has some experience with these particular items.

Those hubs look like thy are screaming for trouble! Only three screws to keep them on your trucks. Does not look any more reliable then your motor mounts.
And they are recommended for less then 25V battery.

Recommended configuration parameters
Battery 18V-25.2V, capacity 5A-15A, discharge rate: 5C-25C

My gut says me stay away from them.

Sadly he has just finished or is finishing his latest batch, which are already sold out.
I don´t know about your budget, but have you considered a gear drive setup?
@Kug3lis is running a group buy at the moment for Urethane 107mm wheels gear drive. I did put them in the cart to check for shipping, i am located in Japan and it was surprisingly cheap, 35€! 
Gear drives are relative maintenance free and everything is swappable like wheels motors ect.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/group-buy-fatboy-mini-urethane-gear-drive-fatboy-solid-cnc-hanger/73191

There is also a gear drive made by @Kaly which is highly thought after, but it is more geared towards Mountain Boards and bigger wheels.
I am running Meepo hubs with VESC´s and they are good for what they are, but I would never invest in them again. You will soon be wanting more and going to pay twice!

@AdamE3399 hi! What he says is true a dual belt drive 6374 with the right gears can not be beaten by the commercial hub motors at the moment. The only one I see competitive are probably Hummie hubs. The reason is also because dual 6374 has bigger motors compare to the classical hub motors around here. While if you compare them to dual 6355 then you can have comparable performance. I disnt mention enertion Becuase their hub (the old version at least) I don't think they are more powerful than what I am using now. Between the hubs I have tried I can say that quality price the Meepo style hubs =I have the old version, no problem of weird sounds from the replaceable motor can) at 12s are really fun. Real Kv 65 so the torque is there. Top speed of 43kmh in FOC a bit more in BLDC (see video and telemetry of this hubs in my build log). They run smooth and you only hear the rolling of a normal skateboard, which I like a lot. Of you want more power then the MAD hubs are really strong, but less efficient compare to meepo hubs. They ask and deliver more power so the range goes down. I tested the 130Kv version and they are crazy fast. I now have the 75Kv version which allow 43kmh top speed at 10s and 50 and something at 12s. I think 75Kv at 12s is gonna be more powerful or really similar to Raptor 2. That my experience. I only run hub motors Becuase I like the style and I do not like all the belt system at the rear truck. That's me, if you don't care about it then belt drive is a really good option. I am personally converting my hubs to direct drive (I know that hub are direct drive too, vmbut I mean more Carvon style) and making a crazy powerful one. Thst one I am sure is gonna be more than dual belt drive. We will see it.
Other option is the gear drives. I like the fact that they are more compact, but they really expensive at the moment, since they are custom made.

![image|375x500](upload://rF1jwGC5WUMZEJalL9HVKms45DF.jpeg)

@rey8801 Hummie hub has a similar stator size of a 6374 and uses actual curved magnets to close the gap between magnets and stator even further. not to mention the strong magnet (forgot what number is was N48?) he picked is super strong and high temp resistance.

I never test them. If the motor is the same as I think then they should be ok. They now moved to a new locking system design, which gives positive and cont results. When I originally testes them I got the version with the same locking system you have in the picture. So the 6 bite that goes inside the PU. It's know that you will need to add loctite on each screws and pay attention to don't go to deep with the front screws otherwise you will touch the motor winding. I think the motor inside is the same but I can not be sure. If it the same and you get the 75Kv. They pull strong, really strong.

would you like to consider direct drive? I know TorqueBoard is coming out with DD motor. and Metasurf need to fix up their design and production. So these are the 2 upcoming alternatives. idk maybe in months. 
Carvon is gona take a long ass time and not taking any order right now. 

AFAIK there's Maytech hub that overheats like crazy, Meepo hubs that are weak as shit, R2 hubs are not sold individually anymore. Mellow is overpriced for what they are.

ask @visnu777 about landwheel hubs? I believe that are also like middle tier 

I agree @moon there's no alternative to hummie hubs. For hubs, I rank hummie and R2 as top tier and then there's everybody else on the meh and then the definitely shit categories.

Your best bet is to get enough ppl to do another MAD hub groupbuy.

I also have not hear about Jacobs hubs for a long time. i'm sure there are companies outside that took his hub design and made some products. let me tell you one thing. The SOLE reason hummie started making hubs is because he was so disappointed at Jacobs hub so he decided to make his own.

I too remember 4 years ago when Jacob was the first guy making hubs and working along with enertion. There was so much hype .... and then I put away Esk8 until end of last year and I leapfrogged a lot of build options to the best stuff available on the market :joy:

At the mean time @lumaci selling backfire hub motors. Not the strongest for sure but you can ride now. Plus if you use them at 12s I am sure they will be fun. They should 83mm I believe which is nice. The closest to the ground the better control you have

I got yep, 80mm pu with 96mm sold on their website.

They are surprisingly strong, much stronger then the Ownboard i use now but the wieres are a bottleneck on them loads of fun with a vesc.

Nice then at 12s even with 80mm wheels should bring you just above 40kmh with nice torque.

Hey man look at this!
You might get some Enertion Hubs on Cyber Monday.
But it could take some time until delivery.

Update: Okay so I have now officially placed the order on all items I need, the items I have changed are the motor, going from 6354 to 6364 as suggested by @dareno, though I am still going to try out the Turnigy Mounts as if they don't work it is only a loss of 20 bucks so its worth trying and ive lost a lot more money in other builds due to mistakes so no real loss. I will keep you updated with the project as parts arrive and I start putting the board together

Why has nobody said anything about @Boardnamics mounts? Those things are 15 bucks and 20 if you want an idler, hands down the best mount for your money.

Okay so the project has officially started! I have had parts arrive and has started, so far I have fibreglassed the enclosure and have opened the parts that have arrived, just waiting for fiberglass to set before a paintjob.

Here are some pics: (sorry that some are blurry![IMG_0424|375x500](upload://yXxGIb7BwFhheNUQMUtECVI4a4t.jpeg) )

@Customesk8 Thanks for the response and sorry for the lack of updating as I have been very busy. Finished the build last week and so far so good. I sanded and painted the deck and put my nickname on it to personalize it, honeycombed the grip tape, finished fibreglassing the enclosure and painted it black, did all the wiring and put it together and its been working really well. I don't know why the Hobbyking mounts get such a bad rep as I have been using them and putting a lot of force on them as this board accelerates so fast it throws me off. You just have the install them properly. I used the angle grinder to cut them down so they fit more snug, used a torque wrench with an allen key bit and locktite and put some JB Weld around it to hold it on and they are working fine, no bowing or bending. I did have one of the motor pulleys come loose but I just tightened it back on with locktite and all god since. Whilst I find the top speed on this board around 45kph where as my single 6374 board reaches 60kph this board has insane torque which threw me of just the other day when it was raining (not a good idea). The dual Flipsky 4.12s are also doing well despite not being recommended by some as well and during rides they never get too hot.![20181213_210510|281x500](upload://qbbj0g6eh3zKZ5zUSmS1Dsq6C09.jpeg) ![20181213_210546|281x500](upload://kx8oXClwnpyR6egxBiqlC96MoGj.jpeg) ![20181213_210511|281x500](upload://e1tK3zdUmVeqbGjF8qn4SNemtew.jpeg) ![20181213_210548|281x500](upload://olsL4ypy9MC7NJuAsN66wJZJVNQ.jpeg) ![20181213_210514|281x500](upload://yHpGvKXGj3S7MccscObrS6oMQud.jpeg) ![20181213_210552|281x500](upload://2R5gR1H0zBvtSMPSBK490hnVm7R.jpeg)
