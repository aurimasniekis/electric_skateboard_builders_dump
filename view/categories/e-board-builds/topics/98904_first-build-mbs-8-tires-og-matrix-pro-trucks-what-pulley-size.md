Getting all my pieces together and it's coming to pulley and belt selection.  I wanna go fast but I also need to be able to go up steeper hills.  I'll be running 12s on 6374 190kv motors.  Any help is appreciated.

Plug all your info into [this calculator](https://calc./) and play around with pulley sizes until you get a speed and hill climbing ability you like.

Dual 6374 will pretty much take you up any hill. :+1:

See what available pulleys for your hubs and go from there

Everything from 60 to 80 tooth hubs. I got a 16 for the spur gear

16 70 gives a loaded mph of 40. I was thinking of going with that.

Right you are! Sorry, there are several esk8 calculators out there and I just picked the first one that came to mind. The one I remember having grade calculation isn't up anymore. My last build (dual 6355s, 10s, 40A battery each side and 65A each motor, 15:60 and 6" wheels, ~26MPH) could handle every hill I threw at it, no problems.
