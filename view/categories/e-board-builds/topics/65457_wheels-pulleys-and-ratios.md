Hi everyone,

I've got some Orangatang Kegel wheels and my belt seems a little to close to the ground. There's about 10mm of wheel between the belt and the floor. Is that normal?

I'm running a 15x36t ratio if that makes any difference.

Also, on a side note, does anyone know of a supplier that can make metal wheel pulleys for the kegel? My nylon pulley is starting to wear massively :thinking:

36T is pretty standard for Kegels I think.

Oh his pulleys only work on trucks with longer axles - so no compatibility with caliber trucks unless if you chop a bit of the hanger

I'm happy to do a little bit of modifying if it will fit the trucks.
