So I have a layout of how I am going to do my board but I'm not sure how to do the batteries in series with the two vescx.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/5/256bf45c986f16c56d138a8666b04c30339eb02e.jpg" width="673" height="253">

Batteries in series, vesc-x in parallel. Then, it's just red to red, black to black.

Ok I was trying to figure out how I would make the battery series connect to the 2 vescx and where would I put an antispark plug in the sequence

[Like this](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/e/5e0b1afa0c3b6f40a07ab4371a24392bd0288bd4.png)

But I'd recommend putting the loop key in the positive wire, not the negative.

If you don't have a BMS, just ignore it and take all three black wires that go to it, and connect them together.
