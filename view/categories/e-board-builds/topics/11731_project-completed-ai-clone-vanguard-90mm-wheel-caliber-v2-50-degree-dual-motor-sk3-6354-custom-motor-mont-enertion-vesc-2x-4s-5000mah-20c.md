**Update ~~Project: AI | Clone Vanguard | 90mm Wheel | Caliber V2 50-Degree | Duo Motor: SK3 6354 | Custom Motor Mont | Enertion VESC | 2x 4S 5000MAH 20C** Update~~


Hi, Ben from Singapore, I am setup a daily transport for my work( 2.5KM distance one way). 

idea setup below:
Deck : Custom deck
Truck : Caliber Version 2 50 Degress
Wheel : 90mm wheel
Pully and belt: custom 36/15 pulley and belt
Motor mount : custom mounting
Motor : Turnigy SK 6353 (will upgrade to dual 6354 after few months)
ESC: Enertion VESC
Battery : 2x 4S1P 5000MAH 20C
Remote: Enerion nano-x
Charger : imax B8 8S charger

I draft out my setup diagram, anyone can advise me the setup is correct?

Some part was confusing me.
1. Charging 2x 4cells battery in series, how was the balance lead going to modify. 
2. Kep loop switch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATED 21-12-2016

After nearly 3months, finally done. 
here is some progress photo. 

Deck : Clone loaded vanguard
Truck : Caliber Version 2 50 Degress
Wheel : 90mm wheel
Pully and belt: custom 36/12 pulley and belt
Motor mount : custom mounting (from local esk8 seller)
Motor : Duo Turnigy SK 6354 
ESC: Duo Enertion VESC
Battery : 2x 4S1P 5000MAH 20C
Remote: Rc remote
Charger : imax B6 (will integrate bms after new year holiday) tat is too troublesome to charge lipo. 
Enclosure: 3D printing carbon fiber Vesc box and Black pla battery box. 
Switch: Circuit breaker 120A
 
Waiting part to upgrade to BMS system and battery indicator. 


Performance
Torque 
0-10: soft
10-35: strong (accident hit full throttle will fall down)

Speed:
Maximum speed i tried is 35kph. i afraid to speed up anymore as i have bike accident experience.  
I think maximum speed can hit 45-50kph.

Range:  
Really poor range. Around 10-12 miles. (70flat 30hill)

Overall result:
Satisfy on the speed, but not the stability. Might be cause of the loose truck as i need to tight turn while i going to my workplace. Vibration make my feet so numb even using 90mm wheel. It is because the walkway was not smooth enough like road. (Singapore skateboard only can run on the pathway/walkway, not on the road) After i add in EVA form under the grip tape, will help to decrease the vibration from the board.

I can help you with that loop switch. You'll want to buy an xt90s off of amazon (I think it's like 5USD) and make sure you have some spare wire around 14 and some soldering skills. Bridge the connections of the key connection and put some string through the loop. Then apply heatshrink and have a small slit so that the string is accessible. For example:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/b/ab52e7f9f40a3a06a8694ce49da98faf2b0b6517.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/4/d41a1d5b3a0b8642860d04f8957bd7ec33a5d15d.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/8/a83dac654552bb944d2106f256d3cbcc7113427e.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/7/a714f37f67d07d90ba7fa63ab15e19cf0c2ac7d7.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/d/0d021657e1d26ff511c67ffc160b8208b72d91b6.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/c/2cf62bf223b0d6064c9b32bc6dd163ad6ff3de37.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/3/23f7d8e179e311ce83147019b6fa7b27b6a229cf.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/f/3f50cb7fcfae5b19d3ad1750e052894d82165e18.JPG" width="375" height="500">

List looks good, if you want to be able to charge your batteries without unplugging them every time you can make a parallel connection before the anti-spark switch that would connect to the charger instead of the ESC

I chose positive, but either should work the entire thing for me looked like this <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/7/a725dc6999e9317946b7e139118249bc7ec8c0e7.JPG" width="375" height="500">

i have 2 4s 5000mah 20c lipo battery, not yet buy the balance charger yet. 
due to budget tight, if i buy imax b6 mini, it only can charge 4s battery one by one. 
if i using parallel board to charge together, will it hurt battery? my fren told me that, if two battery difference voltage left, the higher voltage will charge to lower voltage. it will hurt the lower voltage battery. is it true?

if i using 5.0a to charge, it will take around one hour plus to fully charge rite?

or i need get bigger power charger? 
but for my mind set, i wan protect my battery well, will not charge over 5.0a (1c).

```
Parallel charging means that your charger goes by the average of two voltages, so if one cell is dangerously low and the matching cell is dangerously high it will charge both thinking that they are normal voltage... so yes potentially very dangerous.

Hey, nice build - very sheek ;) was wondering if you could talk about your custom deck and how it was built - ie what materials you used. What thickness is it and how flexy it is
