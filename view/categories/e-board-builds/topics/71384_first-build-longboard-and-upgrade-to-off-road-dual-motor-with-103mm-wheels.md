Hello everyone

Last year I started to build my first electric longboard with single motor.

I've found the video on youtube and I've decided to do similar to start with.

I may be mistaken but I do believe the motor mount from HK is for 50xx motors.

Edit: I stand corrected lol

[quote="J0ker3366, post:2, topic:71384"]
for 50xx motors
[/quote]

nah it fits 63xx motors

@gary_au a couple things:
1. That motor will be fine. however if you upgrade to 10s further along the line, the kv will be far too high. 
2. that ESC will work but will no way be good. I recommend the turnigy sk8 esc instead of this as it is highly configurable and has much better start up torque and brakes. that esc will run hot and uncomfortably
3. those batteries will work, but you will not get very much range and you also wont get a very good top speed. just be aware of that :slight_smile:
4. that deck is the deck i personally use and its pretty damn good. i stripped it to bare basics though and worked from there.
![20180816_105318|690x388](upload://h40HNcimfiYyK9byu01XufGJXgX.jpeg) ![20180816_105212|374x500](upload://60Y3bGZoIexS6SX8M0j7vj8Ydzg.jpg) 

5. that motor mount i have only heard bad things about. think about upgrading it soon :smiley:
6. what is that switch for? you cannot use it to switch your board on and off as the fully charged voltage is far too high. you either need an eswitch or mosfet switch like a vedder switch
Whereabouts in aussie are ya? i'm in sydney

hope this helps my man
p.s next time you order parts make a list like this FIRST and then purchase so that you can accumulate peoples opinions and experience first :grimacing::grimacing:

[/quote]

This is truth. I spent well over $100 on blown Chinese car/boat esc when i would have saved money just starting with a Vesc. $85 from hobby king is a steal in comparison of the preformance you will get out of it.

Please just buy a vesc, you would have saved money by getting one to start with. 

In all honesty people try to save money with car escs but it’s actually more to get a car esc now. A reliable esc like x-car beast is about $75 then you need a $30 card to program it so your at around $100 when a vesc from flipsky is $80 on eBay.

Edit: the probable reason that your esc fried is the gear ratio with the new wheels. You need to get a smaller tooth sprocket, I got some on eBay for $3. I now have a 2.7:1 gear ratio on 97mm wheels

Hello mate. Thank you for your comment. Your board looks cool :+1: I'm from Melbourne

1. I didn't know about this helpful website before... Motor the same as on video. I'm going to update system to 9S (going to order one more battery) What motor do you recommend for 9S Single motor and for 9S Dual motor systems?

2. ESC doesn't work any more. I'll go with your recommended turnigy sk8 esc. Thanks

3. Range and Speed aren't great. I'm going to buy one more to make 9S. Probably next step after buing second motor  will be another 3 batteries to connect parallel 
I need more range and a bit more speed

4. For my 95kg this deck is great!

5. What motor mount is better? 

6. First switch is for switching board on and off.
Second switch is for lights and battery indicator.

They are 12V/24V. But I'll update for an eswitch or mosfet switch.

Thank you))

all good, adding another pack to get 9S will be just fine. the motor you have will be able to handle it easily. however you need to limit your ERPM in the vesc settings. it needs to be limited to 60k erpm. Next, when you have the sk8 esc, you're gonna NEED a mosfet switch or bms switch. the first time you switch the esc on it will blow that small switch straight away. the best motor mount out atm in my opinion is the @dickyho mount. its a nice design and easy to use. If you want another motor, you can either just purchase another sk8 esc (vesc) and the same motor you have, OR, sell the motor and buy a 190kv 63XX motor of sorts (either sk8 or sk3).  
if you want to add more range, you'd be better of purchasing another 3 batteries and putting them in parallel to essentially get one big 9S 10000mah pack.  
just please, like @pat.speed said, only use a vesc. its better for your bank account and better for the hospital bill!!! :smiley:

I was reading about Gear Ratio and 
1. Motor pulley should have 15T minimum
2. Very difficult to find Wheel pulley with more than 40T. 3D printing ... 
3. Better use 2 motors with 2.4:1 or 3:1 gear ratio per wheel as I'm planning to have 103mm wheels

nah you can fit 2x 6364 sk3's on a tb218 truck. look on diyelectricskateboards. they're like $65usd

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/want-to-run-dual-sk3-6374s-on-torqueboards-218mm-trucks-try-these/36641/25?u=mynamesmatt

and yeah that switch will work
but for what you're buying battery wise (having 6 individual batteries to charge on a hobby charger is a pain) i'd be investing in a BMS. Get a high current rated bms with an eswitch similar to this: (this would actually be the best idea)
 http://www.bestechpower.com/333v9spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html

this way you can charge all your batteries at once

I have a question about batteries. It doesn't look like Lipo is reliable battery.
I'm going to order a custom made battery pack. I'm looking at 10s4p or 10s5p. I'm not sure about 12s.

What do you recommend? 

I'm going to do my first test ride with 3 Lipo battery, but I'm sure that I'll change it soon.

Thank you
