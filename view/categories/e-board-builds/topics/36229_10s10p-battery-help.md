My old build is here. 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/surf-6s-30c-diy-vesc-jlab-6374-190kv-mono-drive-robert-august-deck-97mm-wheels-mini-remote/18671 
It was good for about 6 months but now it is just too slow and doesn't have nearly enough range. To fix this I am going to get these batteries.

Right now I am planing on having a  10s10p battery. The only problem is I don't know how I would charge all of them at the same time. Can someone please help me with this? Thanks!

```
connect all of them in parallel. charge that way.  you just need to splice the discharge leads into a charging port and your all set
```

Are the discharge leads the black wires on the bms jst connector?

There's 1 connector to use, the xt60, that is all
```

You can use any 42/36 lithium charger

No, don't touch the BMS at all
You're dealing with **1** connector the xt60, forget the BMS exists

You just combine the xt60s that is IT
```

yea. what scepterr said.

I'm talking about the main thick wires that lead to the xt60.  the same ones you would plug into the vesc
```

---
## \#11 Posted by: Gabriel_Robinson Posted at: 2017-10-23T00:06:40.644Z Reads: 199

So just hook all of them in Parallel and charge through the xt-60 connectors by adding a charging port ?

I know one of my clients with a 10s8p with the LG packs is getting about 20miles between charges
Vesc is set at 40A motor max, 30A batt max

I have no idea about the Sona cells I have never in my life seen them or used or heard of them

The LG or Samsung cells do sag at full load
Running an 8P at 30A means 0 sag

Well then yah don't run them above 5-7A cont per cell, you really can't cause the BMS are 10-12A limited, with 10P you could do 50A batt
```

wait so running my 6p at 20a means no sag also?

cause my plan was to put the batt. max at 30a
```

Yeah, that should not have visible sag from just heavy load
You can do 25

its worth it for 20 mile range though

 I always start with lowest working settings and tweak up to where I want it. 
You will always have more conservative settings that way and get what you want. 
If you start high and tweak down you'll stop much higher

Won't anyone think of the range LoLz

Some of us know how heavy it will be and want it anyway.  I'm in the process of getting a 10S16P build underway.  I want a 100 mile board.  So if I want to ride it all day long, I can do that.

I built a battery out of the same 10s2p packs but none had LG cells my battery was a 10s14p and I ran it at 100 motor amps and 60 battery amps, had no problems, ran great! Was a beast! Range was about 25mph at mostly full throttle doing about 32-35 mph.
