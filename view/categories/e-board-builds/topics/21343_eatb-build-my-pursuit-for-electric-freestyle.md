Hi esk8 lovers!

So having built my first electric longboard I’m now desperate to build/own an electric mountainboard!  This is partly due to the ENORMOUS potential I see with this becoming the next great extreme sport.  I’m sure I’m not alone in this thinking but coming from a snowboard background and riding a lot of indoor snowdome park and riding motocross I’m desperate to see how a super torquey all terrain board would handle a motocross or bmx track.  Initially I want to try and nail freestyle runs on existing tracks, race, but eventually would love to see bespoke parks built with huge jumps and rails - just like a snowboard park but on the flat and made of mud!!  Does this exists anywhere already to anyone's knowledge and is the dream already taking shape?

Anyways, first things first I need a board!  From everything I’ve read Trampa looks to be the best foundation and there are some just beautiful/insane boards on this forum @Whitepony, @Kaly, @squad, @nowind, @laurnts, @onloop to name but a few legend builders - no offence to anyone I missed, these are the names I can remember of the top of my head! :) 

I’ve had a quick look around and there happens to be one on Gumtree near to me and I wondered if anyone could advise whether this would work or not?  Otherwise I’ll be looking at importing one to Oz which I’m guessing will be expensive?  

https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/blackwood/skateboards-rollerblades/trampa-mountain-board-kite-board/1139669663

I’ve asked the seller for more detail on the individual parts and they are as follows (to the best of my knowledge):

Trampa Infinity 12mm hollow axle trucks with upgraded Springs
http://www.trampaboards.com/infinity-trucks--solid-hanger-body-with-12mm-solid-axles--mega-strong-p-11151.html

Note: these are the solid ones but he claims they’re hollow??

Trampa HYPA HH02 hubs
http://www.trampaboards.com/primo-alpha-lite--black-8-inch-tyre-p-795.html


PRIMO Alpha lite high pressure tyres
http://www.trampaboards.com/gloss-black-hypa-hub--including-nuts-bolts--bearing-spacer-p-1054.html


Trampa Camlock bindings in custom colours
http://www.trampaboards.com/camlock-bindings-c-43.html

Trampa Deck is a 12ply 35* blank short deck
http://www.trampaboards.com/35-short-mountainboard-blank-deck--1215ply---p-11142.html

So would this work?  Is 12 ply likely to be too flexy or will it just depend how I mount the battery?  I'm 80kg btw.  

The price works out to be around 385 GBP so I could source a new board for not too much more but postage would probably be a killer….I’m guessing….I guess I could be pleasantly surprised?  @Trampa?  

Anyways, just to give you an idea of what might become an initial test track there’s a bmx dirt track a 10 min walk (2 min ride!) from my office in Adelaide and I just walked over on my lunch break to check it out - here’s some pics!

BTW - it apparently gets SUPER busy on weekends so I’ll check it out again and make some vids when there’s a little more activity.  Also the covers I think are just to protect it from the elements and can be removed by riders prior to riding.

I'd be grateful for any input, haven't thought about the rest of the build yet as I thought I could just get used to the feel of a mountainboard first and then electrify after!  

Happy shredding,

Dan

Looks like a good price...

I think i went with the 17ply.... The maximum stiffness?

If this is just 12 I think it will be super flexy.... But probably still ok. I think trampa have a chart on their website about weight and flex.

I can later post some vids of french guy hitting some sort of dirt track.

Evolve also had some sort of championship but without bindings it looked like.a joke a bit.

@Duffman has been to mountainboard "championship" in germany, same as @Nowind , maybe they can give u some insight about what to look for when building such "dirt track" compatible board.

Hi 👋 

That is a sweet track man !!!

First of all the board is ok, even with those trucks, for your purposes more solid. 

You will definitely need to go with a chain drive system here @Nowind can supply those, for motors go with Dual 6374 Sk3 with 149Kv for max torque. 

On the battery, this is the only application I will recommend lipos, go 12S to have better temperature control . Just try to keep the pack small and lite. 
You can go with this ones https://hobbyking.com/en_us/graphene-6000mah-4s-65c-w-xt90.html
And make a 2 packs of 12S, this way you will have a spare pack. 

For ESC go with a FVT  120A, just make sure you install a fan to cool it. I can set you up with a pair of this, if interested PM me. 

As for trying Mountainboards without motirs first NAH :scream: take the bull by the horns and tame it :smiling_imp:  

Good luck and get some protective gear, you will need it.

Almost everything said but here my recommendations:

I would recommend a 16ply deck for 80kg

Trucks with SOLID axles, hollow axles will bend or break on extreme jumps

I would choose the Trampa Mudpluggers instead of the Primos

Go with heelstraps, it's better for jumping and as a snowboarder you are already used to be strapped to your board

Chain drive or better direct drive, 6:1 for more torque or 5:1 for more speed

Lightweight 12S Lipo with enough punch -> Graphene

SK3 motors give good power, but for offroad use I would look out for sensored motors -> Alien 6374 ?!?

No experience with FVT HV 120A but afaik not for sensored motors.

Other alternatives: (VESC6), VESC X 
I would not recommend a standard VESC 4.xx

Thanks @Okami - be great to hear of any other people doing this too to share ideas.  I've been hitting Youtube all day and there do appear to be people attempting various skateparks, pools, bmx tracks etc but they just run outa steam so quickly and having a speed boost at your fingertips surely has to be the way forward.

Thanks @Kaly & @Duffman you guys are awesome and I appreciate the advice.  There seems to be some differing opinions on the board though, would I be better off then ordering the parts from the UK and shipping or could I make this work?  I remember as a kid I used to rollerblade and was practicing backflips in a local halfpipe on some cheap Bauer recreational skates and snapped one of the chassis just as I had dialled it in!! I then decided to save up £250 (with some help from folks and all my next birthdays and christmases rolled into one!) to buy some decent Oxygen Argon ones which 20 years ago was a sh*t load of money!  :smile: ..I digress, but I guess my point is I'd rather have something that'll last more than one session of hard riding but I'm also happy to make whatever i have work! :grin:

@Kaly haha, don't worry I'll pad up and ride the crap outa this thing!



Ref batteries, I'm happy to go with lipos and I'm actually thinking top mounted would be better as this thing will take some punishment, I'm also hoping to take it to halfpipe/bowl and it would be great to be able to rock n roll fakie, stall, boardslide etc.  Ref brand/type are the graphene batteries much better than zippys/turnigy?  I've not really seen too many builds with them but keen to give them a go if you reckon they're much better for the intended purposes I'm guessing this is because they run cooler right?.  I'll look into the drivetrain next and options for ESC you've suggested.  

THANKS!  :wink:

Interesting, would 8s give me enough poke to get up steep kickers?  I'll have to revisit @nowind's builds to see, but that might save some of the potential fireworks!

Hi @DanSkates, if you tell me your hight and weight, I can suggest a board for you. If you plan do do freestyle, you want your board to be as light as possible at the tips. battery should be in the centre and very well protected! 
PM me if you need assistance. I would consider going for a belt drive ( urban carve motor mounts) or @nowinds direct drive. 

These will fit the Mountainboards just as god as the Urban Carver: 
http://www.trampaboards.com/urban-carver-motor-mounts-c-813.html

If you go freestyling, a open drive will be fine. Its less complex and does the job. Go for a Twin drive!

Here you will find the board you want:

...........oops, ignore that just found it on ES: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=79525

@nowind just read your thread and I'm completely awestruck by your build which you even raced in an event!  WOW!!  So as a sport this does exist!  I might have to borrow a few of your ideas i think!  :blush:

Hey Mate,

yeah tons of Fun on this events but also every day after work ... 
Best thing money can buy for an kiteboarder away from water
or snowboarder away from mountains....

So all said i guess (-;
Keep it light and powerfull

Feel free to ask anytime

Thanks @nowind  - Jenso! As I start to knit things together I'll defo take you up on that offer. I Kiteboard and Snowboard (used to run indoor freestyle nights in an indoor snow dome when I lived in the uk) but as you say the conditions have to be right /accessible and I always seem to be working when the wind is good and as for mountains...we'll South Australia doesn't have any! 😂 This seems to be the perfect solution. 

Anyways...back on track!

Based on your experience what would be a good, light setup? Really love your 8s build and I think this would be the most durable. Plus the batteries you tried towards the end of that thread are on offer at Hobbyking at the mo:

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-nano-tech-5000mah-8s-65-130c-lipo-pack.html

Would you still recommend them? I quite like the idea of just one pack that I can just switch out.

Thank you - extremely grateful for the support. 

Dan

Hey btw - question for everyone on the forum how the hell do you manage to live a normal life once you discover esk8?  I'm getting zero work done in the office and spend all night researching builds rather than sleeping!! :laughing:

I'm a web developer and spend most of my time in-front of a computer - research in between code deployments.  I built two boards so I ride with my son which gives the wifey alone time to relax and not be bothered by her men - which keeps her happy.  I invoked a rule, when i start yawning, it's time for bed.

Till I figure out my battery situation for a range greater than 4miles I'm using it for commuting 6blocks one way.

But unfortunately the FVTs don't support sensored motors.

If you've never ridden anything else than sensorless then it may be ok, but if you get used to be able to apply full throttle from standstill or even accelerating forward while rolling backwards from a hill, you will never ever think about going sensorless again.

With a VESC it would also be possible to reverse the motor direction by pushing a button -> for 180's like in the beginning of this video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELTsMnY6X58&t=1s
```

I think @Kaly mentioned somewhere there are two versions of these 12S Fvt 120 esc's (one being sensored and one not)

I know since he spent quite some time to find the right hall sensor config, I think.

--

@Duffman I totally agree about sensored mode when going off-road / doing tricks or trying to go up a very steep hill or when rolling backwards.

Im not owning sensored setup but once I ''had the chance'' to try to go up some steep hills I experienced the problem with sensorless mode and how it cannot cope with such high demand and low speed, the motor was just cogging all the time since I think it lost sync too easly.

So yes, in comparison, sensored mode is way to go, especially for high power applications, smooth start, better control etc.

@Duffman I LOVE IT!! The 180s and change in direction are actually pretty smooth, and the torque to get going from rolling in the other direction is impressive.  I was especially most impressed by the butt donut at the end ;)  Looks like a smooth, but powerful ride.  

Have you taken it off or up anything bigger?  I've been researching hard but haven't yet found anyone to really push these boards to their limits.  Do you think your build could take the abuse a bmx track would throw at it for example?  The reason that I ask is that I'm desperate to try it out and can see a MASSIVE future for e-mtb if it can be powerful enough and durable enough to ride at the same capability let's say of a motocross bike of an motocross track or snowboard in a freestyle park.  It's the perfect fusion and surely the next big extreme sport?

Just my thoughts...I still haven't made a build yet, so can hardly speculate, but just desperate to see the art of the possible!  :grin:

For my 2wd board I'm using skate trucks which are very light, but also weaker than spring trucks. I already broke two top trucks and one pivot pin. So you should definitely head for mountainboard spring trucks. I would also either choose the heavier trampa infinity trucks for big jumps than the lighter ones.

The German esk8 mastership Okami mentioned (https://www.esk8b-dtm.de/?language=en) took place on a BMX track with a lot of jumps.But in order to ride fast times you actually had to try to suppress jumping.

Jenso (@Nowind) snapped a ultimate truck on the first day with some slight jumps...

This is a video of the last esk8b-dtm where you can see the track:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vniLn54XZ-E&t=1s

I just bent a MBS Matrix truck on a 'bit too big' jump with my 4wd board (at min 3:40):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zK5Ij2xajM&t=11s

I hope you don't mind spamming you with my videos but if pictures tell a thousand words then videos tell a million :-)

Hey
The 8S Hobbywing Setup is a well tested and bulletproof.
Its a perfect Freestyle Setup without worries, only sound of brake is anoying...
But it dont overheat, it dont die if it gets wet or if it get overload...

A 12S Setup could be more powerfull, but with the HW Max6 Setup you got a very good starting point that just does what it is suposed to... bring you a big fat grin into face (-;

The Nanotechs are very good if you want high power to wheight ratio... on a 8S Setup you need more C-Rating as on 12S Setups... so if you want max power by lowest overall wheight who have to choose Lipos like this Nanotechs... 

Downside is that you need an 8S Charger... 
and its not upgradable later if you maybe change to 12S ESC´s...
So think about 4S Batteries like the Turnigy Graphene 6000mAh 60C... this are beasty batteries and you could connect them in 8 or 12S setups.... and charge with cheap 4s chargers

Drivetrain is up to you... they are more then one good possibilities outhere.... on a dry Dirttrack like the linked one from you every common drivetrain will work... Chain/Belt/Direct

Everyone have it own pros and cons...

As a Guideline i would go with gearing between 1:5 and 1:6
8S on 200KV
12S on 150KV 

Or 12S on 200KV if you got suicidal tendencies :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:


Cheers
Jenso

Yo Jenso!  

Thanks for the awesome feedback.  I love the sound of a bullet proof set up as this thing is going to be ridden hard and I'd prefer this to survive a thrashing.  I therefore think I'll go the 8s Hobbywing route.

Good point on the 8s charging, out of interest would you have a recommendation on a trusted 8s charger?  Do you watch them charge or is there a cut off?  Also, how do you keep an eye on how much you've discharged (remaining battery) during riding?

I saw this in the ES thread - not a worry for me, the more noisy, snarling this beast the better for me as it's not going to be an urban pussycat but rather a jungle lion!

[/quote]

I noticed in one of your tests you used the Leopard 8072-175KV on 8s would you still recommend this or is there a better motors now for this cause?  Obviously the more grunt the better!

Thanks man - as much as I love the building process I would actually fast forward time if I could just to ride one of these things!  But I'm sure I'll equally love watching it all come together too :)

So I checked out another sick local spot yesterday.  I've only been living in Adelaide (or Radelaide as the kids call it!) for a little over a year so I'm still getting used to the area.  Also, as I've mostly been kitesurfing here I've not explored the extreme land spots.  

This is a skatepark about 15 minutes out of the city, the airport and my home!  It's designed for skate, scoot and bmx by the looks of things and would be incredible to ride an esk8/e-mtb here!  Enjoy the pics I'll take a board with me next time for some action shots and vids!

It's funny, I've driven past this place heaps and always been put off by the rusty look of the vert and figured the place would be in a state of disrepair but how wrong was I!!  The vert actually isn't rusty but slightly weathered and super smooth.  The large bowl is to die for (hopefully not to die in!! :laughing:)  and has some beautiful drop ins, hips, rollers, coping and just looks like it would ride beautifully.  I'm gonna get myself a Trampa as soon as poss, maybe even the local one at the top of this thread to get me started for the time being, to see how well it rides this bowl.  I was also thinking how nice it would be to ride a Trampa with street wheels in here and full bindings!  The only thing they lack though is a nose and tail which I know defeats the object of the design but I'd love to ride a flexy deck, big trucks 100mm wheels with straps in this thing.  The nose and tail would be great for nose/tail stalls, blunts, slides etc etc.  Has anyone ever seen anything like this??  I used ride Snakeboard quite competitively back in the day (it's turned to sh*t now) and I imagine something like this which was my favorite set up:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/f/5f1f57652c8d1e63cfc9fd6349ae0e3916b0d6cb.jpg" width="640" height="233">

Obviously the idea of a snakeboard was that you could be fully strapped in and generate momentum with the pivoting plates, but with an electric longboard/mountainboard you wouldn't need that and could ride super fast, hard and not worry about pumping.  You could literally accelerate up the ramp!!  Imagine one of these bad boys in the vert!!!  :astonished:  the air you could get would be insane!!!!  I'm gonna try all these things, just need to make a board now! :sweat_smile:  

Hey, @trampa wanna build me a deck with a nose and tail like this? :wink:  obviously it would only work with urethane wheels!

just my few lessons learnt: i had a holypro 16ply and it felt great in the dirt for my 82kg - i just ran on dirt tracks and not crazy bmx tracks that you showed in the pictures. used the boards flex to initiate jumps just like with a trampoline.
my latest urban carver is 14ply and it would definitely be too soft for dirt and jumping - in the same scenarios, it would probably bottom out. its great for carving though. :)

loved heel straps until youre crashing :sweat_smile:

i didnt like chains at all - its messy from 2 perspectives: lubrication flying towards you and it kept lenghting the whole time. think @nowind switched to bigger chains later, which would probably work better overall

care for weight, i slapped 10S6p on the poor board with dual 6374 and massive motor mounts ... and it was just too heavy to really enjoy. if you want to go mad, use small and light high power lipo batteries and swap them out once drained. kinda love the @duffman neoprene cover for his swappable batteries!!

vesc4.1x are too weak for dirt track abuse, i had a lot of heat issues and they dont have the punch you want for @nowind style action

Thanks @whitepony, yeah I have to admit I got to briefly strap on a 17ply earlier today just to test and it felt pretty good under foot actually and I reckon a 16 ply will be perfect so I'll need to order one online.  

Thanks too for all your other tips, really good advice and I defo think I'll be going with a light 8s lipo pack and just have a couple of spares on me.  Think this is gonna be a Hobbywing Max6 build having seen how well it goes for @Nowind as I want something that can handle rough love ;)

Alrighty so the plan is starting to come together.  

I have a nice shiny new Trampa HolyPro sitting in my cart ready to go as soon as a couple of extra parts are available.  Also, @nowind has just posted me out one of his AWESOME [DD systems](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motormounts-for-trampa-mtb-e-toxx-dual-direct-drive/18992).  Still not totally sure if I'm gonna go down the 8s HW Max6 route or VESC X (VESC 6 once available) 12s route.  If I go lipo then I may just bag a couple of [these](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/graphene-6000mah-4s-65c-w-xt90.html) as suggested which could later be used in a 12s setup.  

In the meantime whilst I decide I couldn't help myself and NEEDED a board so decided to get the board at the top of this thread as I figured it might make for a nice flexy park board or could be good to practice on before I ruin a really nice board!! :smile:  Also I might see how my Blade Trigger performs on land and use it for some land kiteboarding.

Here's a couple of pics and a quick vid of the ridiculous flex (which I actually quite like!)

I plan to head out to the skate park this week and I'll before sure to video my maiden voyage!  Definitely gonna leave my skinny jeans at home when I ride so don't worry! :laughing:

Not sure how good the trucks will feel in a 50-50 - the flat section would be ideal but it tends to face out forwards - especially under flex.  Does anyone have any experience grinding these?  I suppose riding with wheels this size it'll be completely different from a skateboard anyway so I guess I'll just see what happens!

I think it's fair to say I have the Trampa bug BAD!

hah cool, didnt know he is so popular.

Well.. guys like him have probably fallen so many times that they somehow know how not to fall on your head terribly.. :D

Ive looked through some regular skater videos.. these guys have fallen so many times that only every 500time or so I think they really bang their head or something :D

It just takes so much time to do some of the tricks but yeh I can partly agree that I dont always understand the logic behind no equipment vs equipment..

Guys who do stunts on the ramps, usually have at least a helmet because of the big air I believe.. but they dont always have wrist / elbow / knee guards or have only some of these.

While.. regular skateboard park skaters, usually dont even have a gloves or proper clothing for more terrible falls.. which makes you think whenever it comes in the way too much or they just dont care, dont want to mess with extra stuff to compromise the looks and time

So having scoured Hobbyking for good lipo deals for the past couple of weeks I've just come across these:

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-nano-tech-8000mah-6s-25-50c-lipo-pack.html

I'm getting more and more certain I wanna go 12s and VESC-X (though the allure of the 8s HW Max6 setup ala @nowind is still very real!) would these batteries be a good choice for a 12s setup?  I'm thinking just 2 in series should get me at least 10-12km range on an eMTB right?  And the discharge is pretty decent.  Could even grab another couple to make a spare pack to increase my range?

If I did go this route what might be a good charger to charge them at the same time?  Or would I be better off adding a BMS for the VESC-X?

Any help advice would be hugely appreciated - thank you :)

Im very happy with my hobbywing escs
I can vouch for their quality and they work as intended
braking noise is the only con that I could think of

Though it sometimes comes in handy
If I drive behind someone and want them to get my attention (lazy bikers on the bikelane) I can do so in style ;)

The esc mount is from nowind and I highly recommend it for the clean look!

Im using these batteries
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-6s-16000mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html
They last for ~20km's
they are not the best though but I like that they are one brick... I hate  to mess with batteries all the time
Im more of a cruiser guy btw

The batterys should work quite well. I'm running 12s10Ah 20c lipos and pull up to 6kw from them without any problems.

Range highly depends on how you are driving: Even when you hammer uphill through the woods you should get 10km+ range. But as soon as you start drifting your range will drop to 5-8km.

Rc escs can give you insane power levels, measured up to 9kw with 12s roxys, but most of them give you a rough kick when you take off and miss a bit of controlability especially on the brakes.
To get the same power level with vesc (x) you need a perfect matched setup. If you are running sensored and everything is fine tuned you can get perfect smooth take of and very fine control over the whole power range.

Just found out that it is way more fun to ride if you gear your motors for about 25% more speed than you plan to ride. The reason is that your motors can provide the most power at 75% of their max rpm and slightly reduce power up to max rpm.
But be careful with this and choose your motors.big enough. I just burned one of my c6364 after changing the gearing... (but had a lot of fun :)

I have a pair of those batteries and I'm very happy with them. They seem to put out a good amount of power, with much less voltage sag than my smaller batteries. I can easily get 11mi+ (17km+) on my single drive eMTB with spirited riding all over my mostly flat town and topping out at around 28mph (45kph). I'm at around 190lb. (~85kg) fully loaded when I ride, and never discharge them past 3.5-3.6v/cell, or charge them past 4.17v/cell, so I'm not abusing them or pushing their limits.

Thanks @Mox, @Duffman & @Mobutusan for your comments - really good info.  

Just pulled the trigger on x2 VESC-X from @yummyblobs who has kindly already got them ready to be shipped tomorrow - super good service - thanks man! :)

So 12s it is!  I love my current VESC-X on my longboard and figure I'd be gutted if I couldn't tinker around and get the perfect settings.  Gonna do some math on the different battery variations out there and work out what the best 12s pack I can get is based on size, weight, power and range.  Currently the ones I pointed out before look like a winner but I'll double check.  If anyone has any other suggestions I'd be really glad to hear them.  

Also, any info on chargers would be greatly received.  

I suppose I should probably get an anti-spark switch too right?

Will this thing warn me and stop when they're fully charged?  If not is there a better option - I can pay a bit more if needed ;)

Hi ESK8ers!

My eMTB build should start this weekend - but in the meantime I thought I'd share some recent antics!

I took a lunchtime cruise on my esk8 this week and decided to check out the BMX track at the top of thread to see if anyone was riding but it was completely dead.  As I was there I decided it might be fun to see if my esk8 could make it round the intermediate track.  I didn't honestly expect it could work especially with 83mm road wheels and a single motor but it was actually pretty good fun!  Not recommend though and I could easily have destroyed my board / myself, but hey I was curious!!! :smiling_imp: :laughing:

You'll be pleased to know I filmed it!  I only had an iPhone (as I wasn't planning on doing this!) so quality is dreadful.  I do manage to hold it away from the ground as the videos progress!  Anyways, enjoy my madness.

Ok…so I went for a spin round the block, and it was beautiful, good acceleration, 50km top end and a super smooth carvey ride.  It definitely had the spongey soft snowboard feel.

This has abruptly come to an end now as I’ve fried my FOCBOXs – see thread [here.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/have-i-focked-my-focboxs/30428)

I’m not gonna dwell on that for a moment though as I’m actually now questioning if FBs are right for what I want.  I’ll still try to get them fixed, but in the meantime I thought I’d consider my options. It could be that I hadn’t set them up too well – mostly basic settings but with the cut-off determined and the motor max set to 80 – I was also running them in BLDC as my motors are sensorless.  

**My current dual set up consists of:**
Motors: SK3 6374 168kv
Battery: 12s2p [Lipo](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-6s-20c-lipo-pack.html)
ESCs: FOCBOX
Drive Train: ETOXX Dual Direct Drive
Board: Trampa Holypro
My weight: 85kg

**Questions:** 
- With this set up is it possible to get more of a grunty feeling?  One where it tries the pull from under my feet – if you know what I mean? 
- Can I get this feeling from a FOCBOX? 
I’m kinda thinking I may have made the wrong decision as I’m trying to change the characteristics that the product was designed for into something else, as it’s surely they’re designed to provide a smooth predictable ride?  What I want is something that has massive torque and scares the shit out of me when I pull the trigger!  It needs to be able to go from standstill immediately and not gradually.  I currently get some cogging unless I shift my weight forward and gently ease into the acceleration, but then it’s quick.

Would I be better at this point thinking maybe going for some ROXXYs, FVT Sleeping Lion or the Max6 (obviously I'd need new batteries for Max6)?  Or do I just get my FBs fixed and persevere with them? Don't get me wronf the FBs felt bloody beautiful but exactly like my esk8 and I was hoping for more of a dirtbike feel.

Any advice gratefully received as I know plenty of people (@Duffman, @Whitepony, @Kaly, @squad, @nowind, @laurnts, @onloop, @Mobutusan) have experimented in this space and grateful for your wisdom.

Thanks,

Dan

The force is strong in this one...

Sounds like you already know what you need to do.  Going max5/6 you need different batteries and final drive ratio so i'd go the 12s route...
I'd be like Jenso and go the roxxy with the shock proofing he did and also some cap banks...
I've added extra cap banks to my build...

Thanks @Cobber - I think you're right, need to get down the ESC route.  Anybody here wanna buy a couple of fried FOCBOXs :smile:

@nowind Any ROXXY advice you can give?  Would you recommend this over Max6?  Gotta say, I would like to still have the higher top speed of 12s dropping down to 8s would be a killer but I could deal with it if the torque gains outweighed it.  And I'm super keen for wheelies!!

@DanSkates 

I may very well be putting my Roxxys up for sale here soon if you're interested. They've already been upgraded with cap banks too. The brakes are very touchy tho. Only have about 7 miles on them so far. Going to give them a couple more tries and see if I can get the hang of it, but there's some big hills here and I rely on the brakes a great deal.

Thanks @benjammin for the potential offer - keep me posted.  I gotta say though I was tempted by the FVTs a while back too but chickened out so may just bite the bullet with them this time - especially as I could get 2 posted for less than $200 (AUD).

Roxxys are powerfull but at the same time hard to controll, brake is really hard to control !
I got a pair of this MAytech Esc´s, flashed with other SW.... never get on with it... maybe the FVT are better 
Max6 is still my worie free favorite, but of course with Topspeed Issues (-; 8S

Ah hell yeah – can’t wait to see you ride a VESC6 monster!  

I’m thinking the FVT have gotta be worth a go and @Kaly  rates them so gotta be good! :muscle:

And…if I screw that up then I’ll go Max6!!

Aw man, i know that feel, i've fried my vescs after a month of riding then switched to FVT120a.
They have some quality issues, but are very powerful, and with some tuning and extra caps i like them so far.

The key is to trim brakes to 70-80%, trim throttle to 95%, and use some expo on the throttle (i use x^1.5).

Haven't tried alternative firmware, i asked for default firmware but FVT guy didn't give the FW to me :( So i guess i'm not gonna experiment.

Hi, so how do you trim brakes seperately? What remote do you use? I havent heard it is possible to trim these values in esc software (unless it would be vesc).. interested to hear.the story, im using mini remote and only whole signal - gas / brake can be trimmed.

I assume u might be.using gt2b? I know it has more knobs but still not sure about signal trimming on both ends, if u do it.in.hardware with electronics, please give some tips.as this.would be very useful

I'm using my own controller/receiver on arduino.
I've never used gt2b, judging by the pictures it has 2 knobs for trimming.
So first you do throttle calibration on the esc with full range signal, then you trim signal on your controller.
To calibrate esc (same for 6s and HV versions):

Hey Dan,

according to your other thread you killed the CAN transceiver because the power connection of one FOCBOX was interrupted:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/have-i-focked-my-focboxs/30428?u=duffman

You should solder the power wires of the FOCBOXes directly together to the power wires ( Y Y ) so that they behave as if they were one controller. The servo input is a bit more tolerant to these faults but this would be the proper soluton. If you later feel like you would like to have traction control, you can solder new CAN transceivers and connect over can again.

What are your current limit settings? I started with 60A which gives good power but a quite smooth startup. I increased bit by bit and now I'm riding 100A motor/battery which gives the desired 'grunty feeling' ... ;-)
```

Thanks @Duffman for the advice.  So you mean red to red and black to black? 

I've only ridden it once for about 2km before I returned home and blew my FOCBOXs.  But I went hard right out of the gate with both set to 80A bat max.  I'll have a play with them more carefully though once it's properly together - I was a bit reckless and impatient before and once I saw the wheels spin I just needed to take it out!  Defo up for MAX GRUNT though!!!  Be great if you could share your settings?

Yes, red to red and black to black.

There is nothing special about my settings. I'm running 100A motor max and 100A battery max. You should increase the absolute max to 155A if you get absolute overcurrent faults. Never above, as the VESC can only measure up to 160A and raising the value above this would in fact disable the protection. (I changed to 0,5 mOhm shunts which enables my VESCs to measure up to 320A so I set it to the highest progammable value, which is 240A)

You should increase the values only bit by bit, as I'm not sure how much the FOCBOX can take. If you're looking for better startup performance from stand still you need hall sensors...

Yeah I figured hall sensors might be my DIY venture as the pull from start up was quite weak before. I'll give them a more thorough test raising in increments as you've mentioned and report back.

Ok, FOCBOXs soldered up, I've simplified my wiring harness to remove surplus connectors and she's spinning beautifully with the split Y PPM connector.  Woohoo!!  Now, before I hit the road, would you mind having a quick scan over my settings?  This is how I had them set up before and the ride was very smooth, predicable, and esk8'y - if you know what I mean.  Bloody lovely and I'd imagine perfect for a street carver but not for a dirt monster!  So should I be looking to gradually increase Batt Max to 80a?  Say in increments of 10a?

I'll make sure everything is nicely sealed and vibration proof this time before I take her too far!

Yes, for sure. As long as your battery is strong enough there is no reason to keep batt max lower than motor max.

If your FOCBOX survives 80A at low rpm it will also survive 80A at high rpm.

You could also raise batt min until you like the feeling of the brakes. Don't worry about overcharging your lipos during braking as this happens only for fractions of seconds.

Thank you for the fast reply - you're a legend!  Well in that case maybe best to set both motor max and batt max to 60a initially to see how it feels and just up to 70a, 80a (and beyond?) if it feels like it can handle it?  Will heat be a problem for the FOCBOXs though?  I'll probably take the brake up to -20 too though they felt pretty good before but a little extra brake never hurt anyone!! :smiling_imp:

HEY DUDES!!!!  So I'm slowly making progress - heaps of house renovations + a 2 year old have kept me very busy.  No video footage yet as my gopro died (I'll get a new one very soon) and I need to get my setup running properly before I go too crazy! :smiling_imp:

I have a quick question for all you 12s emtb crazy fools running VESC or FOCBOX.  I've installed the new @Ackmaniac firmware/tool and it's awesome.  The only problem is i have unsensored motors (sk3 6374 168kv) and in BLDC it cogs like a mother fucker.  However once I'm going the power, response everything is exactly what I want.  But I'm jumping into runs like a snowbaord which is gonna be a real pain in the ass if i stall at the bottom of a jump or bail on an uphill slope.  

So I switched to FOC and it ran beautifully.  Start up was smooth (zero cogging and heaps of boost), and it felt very similar to BLDC when running.  The problem is it cuts out at high speed or when I tried to accelerate too hard and feels very dodgy - it just cuts out.  I've only taken it out once like this (as it's pretty dangerous) and when I got back (3km ride) the FOCBOXes and motors were RED HOT!  Like stupidly hot, so I'm guessing FOC on 12s without cooling could be my issue?  

Is there a compromise with the motors/ESCs I have?    I've tried increasing the start up boost in BLDC but still get the jitters.  With the correct cooling could FOC work for me?  I'm pushing it pretty hard with 80/80 battery/motor max and absolute max at 155 so I could lower it but I really want all the power I can get!

Any help would be hugely appreciated and I swear once I have this running correctly I'll record some nice fat jumps and spins for you guys!  :muscle: :metal:

Post Screenshots of your settings. Add passive aluminium heatsinks (best for heattransfer with air) to the FOCBOX. Add hall sensors to the Motors for a nice startup. FOC creates less heat than BLDC because it is more efficient. And you have to be aware that a offroad build with pneumatics needs roughly double the power than a street setup.

Thank for the super fast reply @Ackmaniac.

I was thinking heatsinks would be a good idea anyways, adding hall sensors might be a bit above my paygrade though! :smile:  Intersting that it shouldn't get as hot as BLDC...

Here are my motor/foc settings:

I have to say I'm totally new to FOC so I mostly used the default settings once I had run the motor detection so hopefully you'll spot something obviously I can tweak?

Looks good in Theory. Now some fine adjustment.
You said that you get issues at high speeds. Try to set the Swiching Frequency in FOC->Advanced to 30 khz (default 20 khz but i always run at 30 khz)
And i also good better results by increasing the observer gain at minimum duty to 50% (but that's more important for low speed)
Add a bluetooth module and use may app then it will be easier to analyse what is going on. Especially because it logs the errors.

Thanks - really appreciate the support.  I'll order a couple of Bluetooth modules (FOCBOXs are over split ppm) and grab the app.  I guess I can take my coulometer out now :smile: which will leave space for the aluminum heatsink - the shunt on that thing is 100a and HUGE!  I'll let you know how I get on.

Btw...I just looked over the screenshots and realised I haven't changed the 'additional info' settings, i.e. pulley teeth, wheel size etc - am i right in thinking this screen is info only right and won't make a difference?  I'll put the right details in anyway but just need to check as that would make a huge difference if it takes that into account!!!  :sweat_smile:

Thanks again,

WOW - the increase from 20khz to 30khz seems to have done the trick!!!  It's pretty late here so I only did a couple of test laps but it has the punch back and no drop out!  Woohoo!!!!  I ran it with the enclosure (Ultrabox 206) open and everything stayed nice and cool too - so I defo need cooling!  

What are people's recommendations when it comes to further cooling FOCBOXs or any ESC in an enclosure for that matter?   Should I mount them with Thermal paste to an alu sheet and have it exposed (but sealed) popping out of the lid so it get's direct airflow, or would a fan work better and be less messy?  

Super grateful for any feedback - I'm so close now to letting rip on this wild thang!!

Just try it first with a closed enclosure. Because you mentioned that your motors got hot as well. So i guess the 30khz helps already with that because it detects the actual position of the motor faster and more precise and by that it runs also more efficient. 
When it comes to assisted cooling then i think a external passive aluminium heatsink make a huge difference.

So the testing/riding has been slowed down by a few small technical bits and pieces and I also had a massive stack going way too quick and fell jumping a speed bump in the road and fractured my pelvis (oops - and that was wearing full pads!) - but I finally got out today and found a small dirt track to play on.

I'll edit the vids over the weekend and post them but here's a few stills in the meantime!

Yeah I have to say the way I've been rationilising it is that motocross bikes weigh around x8 as much (on average) and look at the air those dudes can get!  If you go fast and commit, the jump does a lot of the work for you.  

https://wallpapercave.com/wp/L6zArBw.jpg

I think we can also learn from the protection those guys where too though which will give us the balls to go bigger.  The only difference is the way they fall if they crash which is slightly different as we break our asses when we fall - my tailbone hasn't forgiven me from the last big crash I had!  I'm currently wearing snowboard crashpants but I'm now on the hunt for something a little more substantial.  

Speaking of which what are you guys wearing?  @Nowind, @Duffman what do you guys wear when you compete?

I actually just watched the video for this armour and it's quite a cool concept and addresses the issue I have where I still manage to hurt the top of my tailbone when I fall hard as the shorts just don't seem to go high enough.  These shorts can connect up to the top part and it covers everything from your neck to yo ass!!

:blush: I liked your video so much it was a pleasure to do it ! This jump, I share it on esk8fr groupe to motivate frensh rider ;)

This protection looks cool, fully perfected ! With free moves. Good find !

Yes I have start this project a year ago, starting from a classic dirt scooter, wanna somethig simple but efficient. Made it, so that my girlfriend can follow me during the trips on DarthVapor, but here is the problem ... so much fun ! I really love it !! 
I want to keep the original frame of the dirt scooter and with integrated motor, so make the design around to let the under deck clearence free. It looks cool but now I want more :smiling_imp: (Running under fox + 6374 170kv sensorless + 12s8Ah + e-toxx crazy ratio + 8")
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/img_20171212_164509_936.jpg
Now the battery box is full wood in the continuity of the deck, very raw protoype but it will looks good at the end.

So now, Im making an other, a mad one for me with a previus rear harm I have made last year, like that at least it will be usefull (it looks like a X-motorbike toughness).
No real jump actualy cause it is my GF scooter prototype now, and wont break it, but with the next one with a totaly new setup design (but same part of the Oxelo dirt scooter frame) I will ! Plus now I see you fluing, it made me grow wings :angel:

Looks very good. Do you know if this D30 material is self-recovering after an impact? I remember some sk8 kneepads (it was like this material but maybe different) where the material was damaged after an hard impact and needed to be replaced (it remained in hardened shape)

I've watched a couple of videos now it's resting state is liquid - it hardens on impact and then solidifies again.  So should go forever!  

I've been burnt by a similar slim form factor technolgy though as I bought a whole set of these:

https://g-form.com/padded-compression-shorts

Elbows and knees too and they're bloody useless.  First fall I had and both knee pads ripped from the padding and a bruised both my kness!!  That was on a trip out when my mountainboard hadn't been electrified yet.

These look much sturdier though, plus it's the way the tailbone protection goes up above the waistband that I think will make all the difference.

I guess we'll see!

D30 is insane :open_mouth: next setup protection will be like that for sure ! thanks for your link when I see this Impact Shorts vs my Decathon skate one ... its like if I wear 10 layers of clothing to protect my ass :sweat_smile:

Also, if you buy a new helmet, go with MIPS technologie ;) 
https://youtu.be/rGo9wt1qJ7A

I see what you mean, The protections must be as adjusted as possible, otherwise it has more friction during the falls and burns after. The Gform guard are very populare in longboard.
It made me think that we my need something like that + a hard shell  on top !

So I built myself a kick ass kicker tonight:

![IMG_0277|375x500](upload://uHPeAN1KcwO05ADwfXcvASyFkBc.JPG)


But am regretting my choice of 12mm structural ply for the face - that bitch don't bend!! Found a good use for the 2000+ Enertion wheel pulleys though!!

![IMG_0279|375x500](upload://nyu4TZQnyV4OZ1NTjx2AM7hrFlL.JPG)

Hoping it'll be more curvy in a couple of days otherwise I'll be heading back to the DIY store for some 7mm! 😂🤞 

Was hoping to shred it tomorrow too 😭 Oh well that's another couple of days you'll have to wait for some fat airs!! 

My ambition for this kicker:  

First electric mountainboarder to nail a 360 over a BBQ in the park! 🤘🏻😉🤘🏻

I really see this as a snowboard for grass and dirt so I'm gonna try and transition all the stuff I know from that sport and wakeboarding.  The beauty of this is I don't need a mountain or wake!! Maybe it's not a mountainboard come to think of it.  Maybe electric all terrain board is this most apt name - eATB...

It's only small - but should have some good pop. It measures 420mm tall, 1150mm long and 800mm wide.  I wanted something portable that I could ride and carry between spots.

Yeah - totally my fault too.  FOCBOX had moved out of my lovely new dual CNC case whilst i was trying to get the remote to sync and the DRV must have touched the casing.  ZaaapppPPP!  :boom:

Lesson learnt.  

Gonna have to invest in a hot air station and some spare chips so I can learn to fix these fuckups.  So far I've killed both canbus trancievers and broken off one mini usb port so they're due a repair anyways.

Oh well...in the meantime it looks like I'll be canabilising my esk8 for it's FOCBOX!  I'm hitting this kicker this weekend no matter what!

P.s. if anyone has any links to hand for those chips (DRV, Canbus) and USB ports I'd be super grateful.  Oh, and recommendations on a well priced hot air station would also be gratefully received.  I'll reward you with crazy jumps on my new kicker!  :smiley:

the soldering iron is a 70w iron, you can do 8 awg with really good technique but it starts to get tricky. this might be controversial to the die hard solder freaks so some (with zero actual crimp experience) will disagree. I tend to over engineer stuff. example I have never cooked a esc. i don't use xt90's, as150's and above... 8 awg or 6 awg once my battery wires come together until it divides again for the esc's (the backbone). These conections i crimp. sparkys in real life don't solder any high current conections in australia  they crimp them. crimping is more reliable (soldering does not meet code) and can create a cold welded joint capable of carrying higer current with less resistance (copper has less resistance than solder and zero chance of cold soldered joints).

one day i'll do a vid or take some pictures of me lifting my weights off the floor with some crimped wire but generally i can't be effed. a pull test defines the grade of a gas tight crimped joint, they are not designed to have weight hanging off them in use but it tests their quality.

example: http://www.mecmesin.com/crimp-pull-off-tests

and a ring terminal just allows you to bolt on a connection with a ring...

Had a wicked session on the kicker earlier now my board is working again!  It's not quite big enough for 360s I've decided and I have the wood to build a bigger one this weekend but it was still fun!  Would be a great kicker on to rails.  Got a couple of sweet airs and 180s out of it though and got some pretty cool under the deck type stills from my GoPro.  Here's a taster whilst I edit the vdeo:

VIDEO UP!  :yum:

After a long overdue backup, a Mac OS update and a fair amount of tinkering I have a vid.  

I've tried to have a bit of fun with this hence the audio choice 'Nimble Bastard' - so hopefully you enjoy.  The slow-mos aren't great as I only recorded in 60fps and there's a fair amount of artifacting but it's still pretty cool.  This really was a quick test, so the fact that I got any usable video is a bit of a miracle!!  Plus, I had to re-learn how to use Adobe Premiere Pro as I've not edited a video for over a decade!  :smile: 

Gonna build a larger kicker this weekend and start sending some 360s!  I also feel like this board can handle MUCH larger airs so will also try and get to a decent dirt BMX track (the one at the top of this thread) in the next couple of weeks too.  I'll be sure to document the process.

Anyways, enjoy!

Yeah good idea. Ive actually been watching a fair few videos to get the right curve and this should be good - just looks a bit gnarly as it's short so it fits in my suv!  I've actually been watching a guy called Sam Pilgrim who's pro mtb / emtb guy and he has some great YouTube vids. He's an insane rider! So getting lots of inspiration from him at the moment. Which is odd as it's a bike and not a board but he takes kickers to some really great spots. The kicker in this vid is very similar to mine:

https://youtu.be/arZkWXtBRjw

And there's another video of him making it. Mine's slightly shorter but should have the same sort of pop. 

Just gotta fix my board again then I'll ride it 😭😂

You betcha!  Had a nightmare today actually, only managed to get about 10 jumps in before my board died! :tired_face:  Something really simple too - I made an adjustment to the motor pulley and when I fixed it back in position I only used the purple threadlocker and the damn thing came loose after about 10 mins of riding!  I guess it got too hot and the bolts came loose.  So it cut me off just as I was warming up!  I'll get it fixed this week though and get out again mid week hopefully.  Bloody love riding these kickers!  Rails next!

Hey dude - just watched your last video edit - so cool!

Yeah the advanced park is crazeeeeeeee.  We left that alone last night as it was almost dark by the time we got there so only had about 30 mins of dusk riding but it was good fun.  Stayed on the beginners track but still really good fun.  Shot some vids too so I'll be sure to make an edit.  Also, rode a Bajaboard for the first time - wow!!  Totally different experience but a very sweet ride in it's own right.  I'll be sure to put a full review up on the other Bajaboard thread that has already been started.

Sweeeeeeeeeet!!!  That's about the same as the kicker upgrade I made!  It feels much smoother with more lift.  My only problem is though that it moves bacwards slightly when i hit it - it's not bad but funny when you watch the videos back and you notice that it's shifted a couple of metres!!  So I'd recommend either making the back more angled (not straight down) or creating some sort of anchors to hold it in place!  It's great fun ey!  I've had a couple of board issues - transmitter this time - but hoping I'll be riding and this weekend! :slight_smile:

Did you end up using velcro to stick the dual focbox enclosure to the board? Did you just sticky it over the bolts?

what size does your kicker have and what radius did you choose? my next kicker is about 1m high 2m long and has a radius of 5m. I think in two parts, easier to transport. (The picture/construction is from Duffman​:sunglasses::+1:)

That sounds awesome! Not too sure of the dimensions of mine - I'll double check later tonight.  Think it'll be slightly smaller than that though...

Yeah I added a rubber pad to the bottom of the enclosures with holes for the screws so it sits flush and gives it some shock absorption.  I'll send you some pics.

Duuuuuude - thanks!  Glad my riding can help inspire others.  But honestly...I've still got a long way to go too.  I love that more people are starting to see the freestyle aspect of electric boards - IT's THE FUTURE!

Gonna try and get my board ready for some more this weekend - still deperate to bust out some big spins!  Now that I'm getting used to the weight I should be able to dial these in soon.  I can almost 360 on flat now with the electric board so even a smaller kicker should make this easy.  Watch this space!

Yeah @Duffman's raceboard has this deck.  Beautiful light deck indeed!  I'm keen to see what an MBS deck feels like to ride too.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lightweight-mbs-pro-90-dual-vesc-sensored-c6364-belt-drive-nrf/17143/11

I gotta say having ridden the Bajaboard now I prefer the longer stance of the deck so I'm on the hunt for a new deck.  Perhaps @trampa will sponser me a new long deck and some new dampas!  :wink:

I might start off by drilling some new holes to move my bindings out further as looking at @duffman's race deck he has his really close to the edge so I think I could create a bit of a wider stance with what I have - we'll see.

You could drill 2 small holes and try it with some tent pegs against moving. If that doesn't help then maybe something like this with spikes:

Awesome videos and sick jumps dude! Digging the slo-mo airs and the fast forward selector back to the runway. 

I think you need to find a nice grass hill to put the ramp in front of so you can land on the slope and get more airtime. And maybe you could drill some holes in the bottom rear cross bar of the ramp and pound some of these giant stakes in at an angle to keep it in place.

You're dead right about landing on a downslope - I think my thighs will thank me for this too as they ache for days after a kicker session.  Plus the additional airtime would be awesome.  Thinking it'll make the smaller ramp more fun too.  This suggestion with the stakes going through the cross bar is genuis!!!  I'll defo be sure to drill some holes and try this method out - thank you or for the awesome suggestion.

@Deckoz: Dan is right, I'm one of the few guys that electrified a MBS Pro 90 and still love it.

All those Trampa Decks are super sturdy and have a lot of pop, but the 100% glasfiber composite offers no damping.

As far as I know, most of the other MBS Decks are very stiff and have less pop. The Pro 90 is somewhere in the middle, as it has a good flex for my weight (with my 75kg only bottom it out on bigger jumps) and it has a wood core sandwiched between a layer of gf and bamboo for damping, flex and  pop.

BUT you hve to keep in mind that this deck has 20° tip angle and is meant to be used with skate trucks. When I ran it with channel trucks I had to use printed, wedged risers.

I will soon switch to MBS Matrix II trucks, then I can tell you if this is an option for this deck.

Bhaha yea I rode pshaws 14 ply street Carver and it was like riding a 2x4

I was planning on drilling it for channel trucks, which should be a nice step away from 35 on the trampas which I feel is to high of an angle, at least from the time I spent on a trampa.

Likely I will end up with vertigo or the like since I want to go nowind DD...  Hopefully they mount up just fine...

Here's some pretty shaky footage I put together from a few weeks ago when me and a couple of guys from the SAESK8 crew went to the BMX park after work for a quick play on our electric toys!  

It's a bit long, but watch the first 30 seconds if you wanna see me fall on my ass!  It'll be easy to see why my coccyx always hurts!! :joy:  @rich - this one's for you!! 

I actually noticed how bad my riding posture is in this video and the reason I fell is because of how hunched over I was going into the jump and landing.  The first thing you learn wakeboarding behind a boat is to push your hips forward to get out of the 'toilet seat' pose - which I fell victim of in this video!  That's the beauty of watching yourself back in any sport, you can see what you're doing wrong.  Hopefully knowing this will save my ass in future!! :rofl:

Hahahaha!!  I thought you'd like that!  Yeah having back protection is definately smart.  I always wear one on bigger stuff but after that fall which was only small I still managed to graze my ribs so I'll make sure I wear it from now on whenever I'm strapped in.  I recently bought this:

http://www.onlineracingspares.com.au/assets/full/6938-05-055.jpg

Which I've been wearing under a baggy t-shirt on all my kicker videos.  Actually has a fair degree of coccyx protection too which is nice, plus when you fall you naturally lay out a bit flatter  which protects your ass!  

I'll be out on my kcikers again this weekend and I really wanna see what I can do so I'll be padded up to the max!  I'll be sure to get the fottage up as soon I've I can.

Kurrangga has a really good intermediate track now which you can kinda see in this video and I'll try and get out on that in the next couple of weeks too.  I really wanna build a rail too.  The problem is all the stuff I'm building just takes up space and is cluttering my workshop.  Kinda wish I could just leave it all out at a spot somehwere and then just turn up and ride it but haven't found anywhere yet.  I'll keep looking a hope I meet someone with a nice peice of land we can build a mini electric park in.

Just had another look now and found Fox armour used for $50!  It's out there bro ;-)

It's the same with all board sports man. Haha. Hips forward, pressing into your future with power.  My hips are always the most worn out after a ride... because it really does take effort to press yourself forward.

Still great riding man.

For me best is the mix of different terrains plus jumping. What I love most on mountainboarding is that nothing can stop you and the freedom. There is a concrete path..... oh gravel, no problem... ah stones, curbs, whatever, no problem...... I don't like this path...let's leave it to the left... steep hill with grass, nice... or on the right side some dirt with a small natural kicker, ..... endless options, endless love :heart_eyes:

LMAO!!  :rofl::joy::rofl:

I have to say, I thought I was gonna hate it but actually really loved the way it rides.  You're right though it is not agile at all!  And you don't feel that connected to the board - you always feel like you're standing on it and the deck shape is awful.  The Opposite to the trampa which you feel is part of you - if you know what i mean?

...BUT...the suspension, stability and torque make it really fun to ride.  It's nothing like the boards we're building though.  I think I saw somewhere here compare an electric mountainboard to a dirt bike and a Bajaboard to a quadbike - and I totally agree.

2 months!!!  WTF...time for an update!

So...I’ve had a couple of issues which have prevented me from riding which are mostly now resolved:

 - I bust the teeth of my wheel pulley - twice!  This was due to misalignment and wheel rattle
- LIPO death - I killed a lipo pack due to bottoming out my board from jumps

So I’ve now got my board running smooth and have purchased new batteries:

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-nano-tech-8400mah-3s-30c-lipoly-battery-w-traxxas-connector.html?___store=en_us

The wicked thing about these batteries is that they are individually under the 99wh flight limit so I’ll be able to take them out and carry them in my hand luggage.  They're only going to be run in 12s1p so I won't see a huge performance benefit over what I had previously which was 12s2p (doubling the discharge) but I'm pretty happy with them.  They're lighter too which should help!

**New secure enclosure in progress**

So I’ve just bought these enclosures:

https://www.jaycar.com.au/sealed-abs-enclosure-171-x-121-x-55mm/p/HB6128

They’re waterproof and as low profile as I could find for these batteries.  They’re actually a bit too tight of a squeeze but I’m hoping with some tidier wire management they’ll work.  I decided on 2 to allow for board flex so there will be a gap between them with a wires connecting the battery pairs.  I'll probabaly try velcro again and if that's no good I'll work on a better mounting solution.

I’m also planning to add in an antispark, on/off switch (as shown) in here too.  I’d also REALLY love to add a BMS as well, but I’m not too sure how this is gonna work as I want to be able to plug all of the batteries in separately so they can be removed easily should I want to take them out to fly.  I guess I can make up a lead that has 4x3 JST into a 12 JST connector.  I’ll work this out once I’ve tested them out a bit first.  @deckoz as the master of the small footprint BMS what would you recommend?  I’ve seen this one on you’re latest thread:

https://www.ebay.com/itm/12S-15A-Balance-Protect-Circuit-PCM-BMS-for-43-2v-44-4v-Li-ion-Li-Po-Battery-873/323217175378?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649

...but I only have a height of 55mm to work with as it will have to be squeezed down one of the sides as there is now free space on top.  I was thinking this would work and it's quick postage but with how cheap it is it's likely to be shitty - have you come across this one?  

https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/48V-13S-35A-BMS-PCB-Board-PCM-Electric-Bike-Li-ion-Battery-Protective-Plate-BU/253589117904?hash=item3b0b16dbd0:g:zOQAAOSwkRha4-2z

I only want it for charging and the footprint of this works with my enclosure.

**Other changes**  

I’ve mounted my dual CNC enclosure on the mount - looks soooo sick @Kug3lis  your stuff is da bomb!

I’ll be adding 2 smaller enclosures to handle the wire management out of the FOCBOXs and store my remote receiver and bluetooth module.

I’ve also added some crazy griptape to spice things up a bit.  I’ve always had really colourful wakeboards/snowboards and want this to have the same level of pizazz!  Speaking of which I’ll spray the enclosures - not sure how yet, not sure I want to make a feature of these so they’ll likely go black, carbon fibre vinyl wrap.  Or I might change my mind and spray some sort of funky bright design on them.  Watch this space!!  

Here's a couple of pics of everything...

...oh yeah, these pics are all a bit mixed up in time order but I chopped off those ridiculous connectors and added xt60s.

Anyways, that’s it for now!!  I’ve always rushed my changes through so I can ride and that’s led to most of my mishaps, so I’m taking my time to complete this so it’ll be more robust so when I ride again I’m not constantly interrupted with malfunctions!!

Any questions or suggestions gratefully received!

Lol! Dude I’m not planning to top 50kph - that might be overkill 🤪

I actually went out today and bought some m6 bolts, rubber grommets and threaded inserts to use. Was gonna try velcro again but decided keeping the boxes off the deck would be a far better plan. I’ll let you know how it goes! 😉

Whoops!!!

Note to self - never try to cut the connector off of the lead which connects all your batteries whilst it’s still plugged in!!! ⚡️🙄⚡️

Luckily for me, I think the additional wire length and xt60s saved my batteries as I’ve just tested and all seems to be good.

What.

A.

Dick!!

It’s funny - I was so careful when adding the new connectors never to let the red and black wires touch but for some reason (might be down to several glasses of wine!) completely forgot when I tried to chop the end off the whole fucking system!! 

Lesson learned - I just got very lucky...,hopefully! 🤨🤪

On a lighter note this is the first time in a long time I’ve seen the middle of my deck completely Velcro and battery free:

![image|374x500](upload://8ppO8zRj2331AigLhRsTPxRllFU.jpeg)

It’s naked!!! I actually feel a bit weird staring at it 😂

Also - I’ve decided to go a bit rustic with the enclosures and I’m gonna use coloured duct tape for the ‘I don’t give a fuck’, ‘but secretly I do’ effect 😅

![image|666x500](upload://bRs7oSIPdMRzDEe7pYYIAX3LEXV.jpeg)

Threaded inserts in:

![image|667x500](upload://1dtIbyasQBT9tToIUowBBg6U9vz.jpeg)

The trampa deck shavings are itchy as fuck! Wear gloves if you do this.  I got the prickles!

Ok...so I’ve tried the duct tape effect...but...I reckon it looks like I’ve got a Christmas present sitting on my deck 🎅🏼

😂 thinking I’ll just spray these suckers black so they blend into the deck a bit. Otherwise people will think I’m riding around with gifts in between my legs!

......some minutes later........

It comes off nice and easy at least!

So I had a bit of free time tonight to experiment with the boxes. In keyed in one of the lids and applied black spray paint and it looked.....ok.

Whilst the paint was drying I decided to quickly try out some carbon vinyl wrap for had laying around and threw some on the other lid and it looked.....pretty fucking good! 😅

So I’m not gonna waste my time painting I just wrapped the boxes and I’m actually quite impressed! They obviously looked wrapped and not like real carbon but for a quick job it’ll definitely serve my purposes. It’s defo better than grey that’s for sure!!

The patches are just for illustrative purposes - I have some new kick ass decals in the post! 🤘🏻

Oh...and they’re not mounted or screwed in yet either - I’ll tackle that tomorrow.

Oh shit!! Sounds like she was teaching you a lesson 🤣

Yeah I’ve not actually tried to discharge them under load yet so I’m hoping they’re fine. I’d imagine it’d be obvious immediately but we’ll see. I got these lipos on offer but the current price is almost $600 (AUD) for all 4 so if they’re buggered I’m pretty sure my wife will be teaching me a lesson too!!! 🤪

Hey bro, everything good?

I like the idea with the 2 enclosures, looks dope. Hope you could finish everything.

As I can see on the pics you are a serious Loctite addict DanGlues :laughing:

HAHAHAHA!!! Yeah - those loctites work well on my board but better up my nose 😂 just kidding...though I’ve licked my fingers a few times after using it and it actually tastes pretty nice 😍

I’ve not been in the forum much as things at home have been sooooooo busy and not even looked at my board for a month or so but I hope to get it up and running in the next couple of weeks. 

HOW ARE YOU DUDE?  I’ll get online tonight and check your thread - I’m sure you’ve been busy! 🤘🏻

Was out of country the last days, better late than never :wink:

I'm good but also fighting with some troubles. The great thing with DIY is that one can fix the things (at least in best case :rofl:).

Take your time and enjoy riding when it's ready.

Great to watch your progress @DanSkates. The new mods look great and I can't wait to see it all back up and running. Hope the LiPo's are okay - you were very lucky that things didn't go 'bang'.
