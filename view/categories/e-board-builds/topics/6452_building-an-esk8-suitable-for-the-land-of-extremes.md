Hey guys, I have been looking to build an ESK8 for daily use. Going to try and make this as short as possible, so here we go. I am a 17yo student with a strict budget, I live in Finland and I intend to use the board daily, whether it be 20c in the summer or -20c in the winter. So it would have to be able to work in not only different temperatures, but also in different weather conditions (Waterproof / Snowproof / Mudproof etc. you get the point). I have never built an ESK8 before, but I have done a ton of research (but still don't feel confident in making these choices on my own.) I am not sure if this is entirely doable, but I will try my best ;) (I really don't like settling for compromises)

So below I will list "requirements" that I hope to build into the ESK8
* Long range (15-25km) (reasons)
* Capable of going off-road (graveled roads, maybe even small forest paths?)
* Big wheels (see above)
* Enough torque (I want the board to be able to comfortably take me uphill )
* Safety (I want to have enough torq to brake properly, and I don't want the battery to explode either.)
* Speed (Not that important to me but I'd like the board to go atleast ~35 Km/h)
* Durability (It's gotta be able to survive Finland, and some abuse)
* Budget (My goal is to get the best bang for the buck sub ~700‚Ç¨ setup)
* Nice remote (I would like to avoid those horrible looking RC Car controllers, I'v seen some people build controllers out of Wii Nunchucs, something like that would be nice.)
* Upgradeability (Might gain a ton of weight in the coming years)
* Everything else is a bonus (Nice aestethics, light weight, lights, battery indicator [for the board battery/controller]
* Willing to use 2nd hand parts, wherever I can to cut the costs / get better value.

Hoping to get to the building part asap. I will be able to order the parts on monday assuming that I have all the parts figured out. Again, I'm pretty much a n00b in all of this, eager to learn. (I will also do a build log out of this, so yall can laugh at my stupid mistakes.) I did read through all of the FAQ articles and watch trough like 15h of YouTube content, but in the end I was left with more questions than I started out with. smh.

Best regards, Mikail

You need a dual drive, pneumatic wheels, running 10s-12s, on 149kv -192kv motors

And a partridge in a pear tree

I kind of figured that a dual drive is a must, but was not sure, so I did not mention anything about it.
Not sure if I should mount them in DR or DD config tho.
I am not sure what "pneumatic wheels" really mean, I looked into this briefly and also saw a guy who did a build with these in it. http://www.matcomfg.com/TAILWHEELASSY6PNEUMATIC-idv-3006-6.html , problem is, that they are wayyyy too expensive for my budget, any cheaper alternatives?

The size of the motor will ultimately decide if it's dr or dd

I think your limit is a 6355 can size which will then determine the motors you can use

25km range? 35kph top speed? dual motor? off road?  lol, good luck getting all that with 700‚Ç¨.    You'll need twice as much as that (or more) to achieve the requirements you listed.

It's not inteded to really be a mountain ESK8, what I really meant by "offroad" is that I need the big wheels to be able to travel if I run out of asphalt and have to move onto a gravel road or a walkway with some snow on it.

Just as a guide...when you go dual ... You basically double your cost not quite...but pretty close

Not trying to discourage from building, just letting you know realistically the cost of things

160 x2 HK motors
150 mounts, drive train
120 x2 car esc
120 batteries lipos
100 charger
50 controller

$700... and you don't even have a board yet.   (those prices are bottom of the barrel estimates too)

Great, then that is probably what I will have to do. So still going with the "max 6355 can size" and a "149kv -192kv" motor? I looked at motors from hobbyking, but the EU warehouses are kind of.. empty, and hobbyking also seems like a site that is not  the best bang for your buck anyways.

^I know I am oversimplifying this but this is how much it would cost to make a single drive if I understood correctly. It seems doable even on my budget. Then I might add the 2nd motor later if I feel like it's necessary and if I have the funds at the time.

1) You'll need at least 10s 
2) use a 149kv HobbyKing SK3 for great torque
3) If you really want everything on that list covered, it's gonna cost more than 700 euros. 
Here's the conservative list that I would recommend to cover everything(in USD, shouldn't be hard to convert though):
2x 80$ HobbyKing 149Kv SK3 motors
2x VESC (range from 99$-149$ per unit)
1x GT2B controller (25$)
1x Carbon Fiber Trampa Complete (Includes super strong deck and big AT wheels that you wanted) (~600-800$)
Miscellaneous (gears, motor mounts, chains, waterproofing materials, etc.) (~200-400$)
So as you can see, even in very conservative amounts, with everything you want the list still adds up to at least 925USD without taxes and shipping. This converts to about 840‚Ç¨.

that seems to be a dual drive setup, but if I'm going to go with a single drive in the beginning (and then potentially upgrade it later). How much do you recon that would cost?

Still a lot. My setup which goes about 25mph max isn't waterproof, doesn't have big wheels, has 5 miles of range, and isn't very powerful cost me 600$ with taxes and everything shipped.

I think that getting it waterproofed or atleast splash resistant is not going to take much, some boxes for the electronics and a ton of hot glue and ducktape.
Edit: Also, I don't really see bigger wheels affecting the cost all that much, unless I go with the 75‚Ç¨ pneumatic wheels.
Edit2: Also, there is no way I could get a Trampa board or whatever, the cost for that was like 400‚Ç¨ according to the site, I am planning on getting something like a 2nd hand Landyacht for ~100‚Ç¨
```

Here's what I would recommend for an approx. 700 USD setup:

Turnigy SK3
8s2p 6000mah Lion w/BMS
FVT 120A ESC
GT2B or Psychotiller Mini Controller
MBS all-terrain flywheels
Torque boards motor mount and pulley kit
You could make a deck to save money and get exactly what you want or you could buy one (mobiousboards.com)

Edit: find a different ESC, I don't think the FVT will work with 8s. Just buy a VESC
```

The "MBS all-terrain flywheels" seem super small tho, only 100mm, and big wheels are kind of like the focus of this build ._.

Only input I can make is that to avoid Aquaplaning on urethane wheels, you can try using a lathe to modify some flywheels so that they're safer to use in wet conditions.
And zealous bearings for your best bet against rusty bearings

Sorry for not replying earlier @anorak234 , @Michaelinvegas  & @Luke
The reason for doing that is that I had reached the maximum number of replies a new user can create on their first day.
http://i.imgur.com/NVyzo6f.png 

Anyways, I have been doing a ton of research in the meantime and have come up with some sort of a parts list, no idea if the final price is accurate or not since I could not find the 99‚Ç¨ vescs and stuff, but I think it's pretty close.
So here goes..

1x Deck+Normal Trucks (2nd hand, drop through/down)                  = ~50‚Ç¨
2x Vesc                           (@anorak234  said 99$ to 149$ per-unit)  =~200‚Ç¨
2x Motor                          (Turnigy Aerodrive SK3-6374-149kv         = 167‚Ç¨ + (15‚Ç¨) Shipping
2x Battery                        (5000mAh 5S 25C Lipo)                           = 84‚Ç¨  + (^=0)
1x Controller                   (GT2B controller)                                      = 22‚Ç¨  + (^=0)
4x Wheels, 8x Bearings  (Trampa 8" Hypa wheels)                        = 120‚Ç¨ + 10‚Ç¨ Shipping
Misc                                (Gears, motor mount, belt/chain)             = ???


--------------- Total without shipping =  643‚Ç¨
--------------- Total with shipping    =~ 668‚Ç¨
^Not including Misc parts, guesstimating ~100‚Ç¨

------------ -------------Total Total = ~ 768‚Ç¨
But if the Trampa 8" Hypa wheels don't work with normal trucks, then I will have to buy Trampa trucks aswell, or choose different wheels.
So..
2x Trucks              (Trampa Infinity Carve)            = 140‚Ç¨ + (would ship with the Trampa wheels.. So shipping included)

--------------- Total with Trampa trucks= 908‚Ç¨

Edit: I can try to stretch the budget out a little bit.... But the closer to the original budget = the better. I don't want to compromise on quality tho, no point in buying crap parts and having them break a week later.

Wow! Nice step up, I love the list. All reliable parts from what I've seen, and that motor is going to give you an incredible amount of torque. Keep in mind if you go dual drive it may be a good idea to go dual diagonal, there's a couple of threads that can compare benefits of that. Drop through/down will be interesting as far as electronics go, but if the hypa wheels work out then it shouldn't be a problem. Also, since you're planning for this to be more mountainboard style then you may want to consider adding bindings and mounting the electronics on top of the board. Great job with research!

You seem intent on wanting a ferrari for the price of a fiat.   That's not the way to do it.  You'll end up spending more in the long run or end up with an unreliable/dangerous board... but that's your choice.   

Just take everyone's advice that it's a lot more expensive than you think but and you should budget for that...  but you'll find out soon enough once you start putting everything together.

I'm pretty sure I could copy something from here, people are making motor mounts for <20‚Ç¨ and yet they seem to be holding up pretty well. I have no problems with spending time on a project like this, but there is not much room for error, if I break something I might very well not have the money for a replacement, that is why I have yet to buy the parts and want to make sure that everything seems perfect on paper.

I really do not understand why you would be saying that the board will end up being unreliable/dangerous :confused: .
 I tried to select reliable parts, that should last me a very long time, for example I could get cheaper wheels but I know that the hypa wheels wont break on me nearly as easily, so I am willing to spend more on them. But please do tell me if there is something I should improve on, I am trying to make the most out of my money.

And if this is about the motor mount, then I suggest you check out the thread I linked, the motor mounts those people are using seem to be holding up pretty well. Then again I am new to all of this so I could be wrong, I am open to constructive criticism :slight_smile:

I have yet to decide weather I will be adding bindings or not, if I have enough room underneath the board I will mount the electronics there first, and try using the board without bindings, and if I feel like I need to use bindings I will then add them and put the electronics in between them.

Here's a thread you should check out! Ha!

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-much-over-budget-did-you-go/6619/0


If you were just looking to build a standard electric board, you can keep the budget under control. Once you start wanting a more specialized setup, the cost goes up exponentially. For example, you want a board that you can ride in extreme cold, but still have a good range. Once temps drop, your battery life tanks. So you either need a bigger battery, or someway to keep it warm in the winter. Perhaps an insulated cover for you enclosure that would also be water tight. Throwing water, snow, or mud into the equation means you will also need to housing for your motors, gears, and a way to keep your bearings dry. I'd also recommend a carbon fiber deck since wood decks and water don't mix so well. You get the picture.  

All the odds and ends such as extra belts, bearings, switches, foam padding, velcro... they all add up, but shouldn't be much more than $200USD. It's really the wet and cold weather related items that are going to blow your budget.

@DilatedPupils
Yeah, I am new to this electric stuff but not to boarding in general. I wish I could make something with just 2 wheels to get a board with the same feel as a snowboard :stuck_out_tongue: . But yeah, I already got a good set of protective gear, might get a fullface helmet but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Building something similar to a boosted board isn't even that expensive, but building when building something like this it changes. I totally agree with you.
