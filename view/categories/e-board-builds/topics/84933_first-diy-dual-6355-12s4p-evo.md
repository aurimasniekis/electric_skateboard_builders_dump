hello everyone,

because my meepo v2 has become too lame for me I wanted to switch to a DIY setup. I would like to have a dual beast (eskating.eu). Unfortunately the price with a 12S4P battery would be around 2k Euro.

Therefore I would like to build one myself with the kit from street-wing (https://street-wing.com/product/dual-motor-conversion-kit/).

Unfortunately I can't find a 12S4P battery with BMS and Powerswitch from Europe. Does anyone have an idea? 

With the kit + battery, Enclosure + Evo Deck I should have everything, right?

You're gonna need an enclosure and charger too, but other than that you're only missing cosmetic items

hey, can you tell me a fair price for a 12S4P with BMS, powerswitch and LED? 560Euro sounds alot to me or is this normal?

Pjotr's custom battery pack thread has prices, so it would be around 320€ + shipping. You can ask a few other EU battery builders here on the forum how much they would ask for building one, but keep in mind it probably won't be as cheap. 560€ does sound like a lot, but if the shipping is free, and time is important to you, might not be the worst deal in the world.
