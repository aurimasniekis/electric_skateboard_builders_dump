I ended up ordering these from altitude hobbies 129$ each. But I must have gotten the last 2 they are out of stock now. I have e-toxx making motor mounts and adapters to mount the motor, he pretty much has me convinced to copy his 8s setup with one exception. I am thinking about using torqueboards 12s esc instead of the hobbywing ones. Does anyone else have any suggestions?

I jumped for ultimate because they're solid titanium. 

The site said the vertigo we're hollow core or something

Hello you are right these are titanium, as of now I am leaning towards torqueboard esc or possibly the max6, If I use the max6 I will have to get new batteries due to the fact that I have two 6s batteries already. I am wondering if I set it up with one battery per esc (max6) or run them in parallel with the torque board esc ? Due you guys know what makes the most sense? I have heard that the vesc would not be up to the loads also and I can always upgrade at a later date.
Thanks

Good that you went for the TB-12S  ESC !!!

I have TB-12S and VESC on my 2 MBS builds and comparing the 2 ESC for this application the TB have a real advantage on off-road situation,  it will deliver the power more aggressively wich give that dirt bike feel to the eMTB. 

On the other hand the VESC will shine in acceleration on the pavement and the brake implementation will extend the life of you pneumatics.

Just got my esc and can't figure out how to hook them up, I thought I knew what I was doing:grin: I ordered one esc with the BEC option and one without, so one esc has 2 wires the other has 1. My confusion starts there because how do I hook up my reciever? no matter what combination I do the reciever will not power up.I had to order a Y cable due to mine did not come with it or any instructions and now I am stuck, will someone look at this picture and tell me what I have wrong?I hooked the second esc up and it was DOA, the light comes on but the motor just twitches.For some reason I can't get Dexter to respond to my emails so hopefully someone here can help me.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/20433b4c8589083c1e318edecda374fe4223737b.JPG" width="666" height="500">

the problem is that the ESC is opto so none of those cables have any power.
you'll need to connect the UBEC to power up the receiver. 

Of the 2 cables one is for programing and the other is the receiver cable

One more suggestion Get a couple of fan and install them on top of the heat sink of the ESC. it will save it from overheating if you have too much fun off-roading. :slight_smile:

Thats kind of what I thought, I ordered this esc with the bec option added so I thought one of the wires would be the power. I took my meter and tried to test it but there is no power, on the DIYESKATE website it says that the ubec will no longer come separate and will be built into the esc. This is why I am so confused and when I asked Dexter about it, but I cannot get an answer from him. When I get home I will post a picture of the esc side by side so maybe you spot something wrong. Thanks for the quick reply.

I notice that your lipos are laying on the flat side of the cells. i recommend that you put them laying on the narrow side. that way the vibrations won't damage the cell that will otherwise be at the bottom of the pack.

Hi @Menwaylo. The one on the left with (1) 3 pin wire is with an SBEC included. The photo looks a bit backwards. So the UBEC is built into this ESC. This is a new change in the ESC which we sell now. No longer is the UBEC separate.

Yup, you got it. You should be fine like that. Maybe, wrap some ferrite rings around the ESC Signal Wires.

A little update I have both esc working and they seem to be hooked up properly and both esc's have been programmed the same except there is a problem. One motor spins at low rpm really good and the other will not start till the throttle is pushed halfway. I did notice that one of the esc has an additional program option that I did not have on the other, it is called : start power and has a value of 1-100. I am wondering if this is why the motors are not at the same speed. One thing is for sure the instructions that came with these esc's was rubbish and I have gotten very little help from the seller.Here is a picture of the setting I am referring to.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fd8e7d26a8b4615fbe5b48872a8c64f6ae1c72e9.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Yea I wondered the same thing but the only way I see it possible is to use Y splitters due to one side of program card is for power, I think. Hopefully someone that knows for sure will chime in. I think I might have two different versions of firmware or something like that because its weird that that setting is missing from one of the esc. Hopefully it is an easy fix I cant wait to ride this thing. I was going to upload a quick video of the problem but now the esc will not respond no little green light.(thats another thing only one comes with a power light, the one with SBEC for anyone ordering ) so that adds to me not knowing what to do next. There has to be something lose or faulty for it to sometimes turn on and sometimes not, it wont work even when the battery is connected directly to it. One thing I did notice is when it did work it was warmer than the other one and the green light had a red light right next to it. Any ideas to fix this let me know Thanks.

One ESC might have a different Neutral Range setting 3%, 5%, 7%, 9%. I would set it at 3% for both.

One side being power shouldn't be any issue.

What are your version numbers for each ESC?

Another quick update The esc will sometimes turn on and sometimes it does not:rage: I can get the esc to turn on but it becomes hot on one side within minutes of being turned, I guess this is normal ? One thing that is driving me crazy is the fact that it works only sometimes and then becomes hot when just sitting plugged in. On another note I would like to see if anyone has ideas on how to make my esc enclosure work. I am not sure if this is a bad idea due to it is made of metal and the venting is going to be a little tight but my plan is to squeeze a fan between the 2 esc or maybe put one on the bottom but I am not sure if it is a bad idea. Take a look and let me know.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a1f4502231f971d09de121ef9823f3e34ac580aa.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8f5c4b50a65f1f92f38f8a92daec99754bee333e.JPG" width="640" height="480">With the lids open.

How hot is the ESC getting, can you touch it with bare hand ? 

The ESC enclosure is a nice touch :slight_smile: you can put 2 fan at bottom one blowing in and the other out.

Just got some of those fans thanks, You are right about the softcase I had it sitting around. I might have to settle for a pelican case like the one you showed if I cant come up with something else not sure yet.

[/quote]

This is no good. When pairing ESC you will want to have identical ESC working together same firmware, same programing, etc. Otherwise in a high demanding scenario one of the ESC can burn by being over loaded with respect to the other.

@Menwaylo - This is the wrong place to contact me. I'm not on esk8 that often as well as you didn't bother to tag me.

Hit me up on Live Chat and I can assist.. Either seems like you have a neutral range setup which is different on both sides. Perhaps, one ESC is 3% and the other ESC is at 9% which is what happens to that delay.

Compared to SBoard342 issue. Yours seems to be an issue though.

I also haven't tested that controller and don't know if that's an issue. You might have also not set your neutral point on your controller which could be causing an issue.

@SBoard342 - One motor always seems to start-up about 1-2 secs sooner. But when you give it more throttle they are at the same speeds. It's probably due to the Y connector.

@lox897 Thanks for tagging me. :grin:

There has been 3 attempts to make contact thru the live chat which then prompted me to email and I did, got no response. I then brought it up on this forum and you responded, so I sent you several private messages and no response, so now I am back at the forum. I am very frustrated with my build and was trying really hard to get answers to a few questions about the esc. So if I offended anyone sorry it is not my normal go to move. I have made very little progress in the last 2 weeks due to lack of answers that I feel are key to the function of this product. I will try to contact Torqueboards thru his live chat and hope to find out if something is wrong or just me being a dumb ass. I will keep everyone posted to the progress.

@torqueboards can get on your nerves from time to time with the lack of communication or documentation for his product,  personally i cancel a whole order for the same reason just to reorder like a month latter.

But remember that this so far is a hobby and this is a side thing that he has. On the other hand he have a real job and/or  family all that can really stack up against any good intentions to be able to satisfy all the demands in all front.

it's good to bent from time to time.

Nice. Glad you got that one working. Although, that is the Flier ESC. Both Enertion and I have had countless problems with those ESCs and they don't seem to last longterm. Hopefully, it's better now. Would definitely like to hear your results.

Try to catch me sometime tomorrow.
