So plan is for my second build to make a Trampa Evolve hybrid. 
Use tramp deck, trucks and tires,  Evolves motors pullys and hubs, duel focbox and an under mounted 10s4p custom battery using Sanyo 20700b's
Things i still need to work out:-
- Evolves standard Motor center to Axle center distance?
- a bearing size for the trampa truck to the evolve pully?
- the enclosure? I want to do an abs vacuum formed segmented but it means i need to build a vacuum former.  
- prob going to need a spark switch?

What do people think?

For a moment there I was going to say that you had it ass backwards! 

Not sure it if the urban treads will fit on evolve rims though.

You can get cheaper Racerstar 5065 motors on aliexpress (140kv).

Yes I relise that this a slimmed down trampa. A bit Less power in favour of range and stealth. Lots of threads say the treads are interchangeable I guess we will see for shore soon. I know I'm going to have fun fitting the hub to the trucks. I have the trampa R6 bearings that will do the bulk of the load but the other Bearing for the gear is still unknown.

Oh and as for the raccer star motor, you can't get them in full black. Also I got board bumper ones when they were on special and they are local to me in Aus. I did order a set of "black" raccer star motors and they showed up red. Had big argument with manufacturers and ended up getting my money back.

I figured if these motors are good enough for evolve. Iv ridden an evolve with pneumatics on grass and that's plenty of power for me. This is going to be used primary on pavement and it's going to be geared low as I'm not a speed demon.
I thought about painting the motors but was also the issue of them not coming with the pully which it said it had in the add. The the board bumpers motors were only slightly more expensive overall and I didn't have to wait a month for them.

So today's step backwards is a galled thread. I don't blame trampa for this it's somthing that can happen anytime you are using stainless hardware. To be honest I should have known to used antiseze but I was just test fitting some wheels I had lying around. To be clear this isn't cross threaded, this is galling. ![IMG_20180718_182346|281x500](upload://jUsYmLVm29F92k0LYRiTavgMIdx.jpg)

Update on the axles. Management to pull the shaged one out by tapping it M10 and putting 2 nuts on it, removing the grub screw, then pulling it with a slid hammer. It's with the machine shop now to get 4 new axles made to convert the trampa hanger to the evolve bearing pattern. (8mm with 10mm step up.) it will make them 20mm longer each side that's why I'm making 4 of them. ![IMG_20180722_100436|690x388](upload://3kNyr4F34pYXGdPqCh3MOkhKbui.jpg)![IMG_20180722_165032|690x388](upload://a0DjYLWNJ0Vq4ENmAHJcmDFmw8w.jpg)

Sort of comforting to know I'm not the only one. Sucks so much when you can't use your trucks tho. Make sure you let trampa know this is happening so they can potentially prevent it in the future. It could be a machineing defect or a quality control issue and I'm sure that would want to improve there product if this is the case.

I recently bought a second-hand trampa. or the previous owner has wrongly set the nut and twisted the threat or there is a production/design error...

Hope trampa will come with a solution. otherwise I have some friends who can make a new axis on the lathe :slight_smile:

A big slide hammer. I taped the end of the axle so I could put a 10mm nut on it. Put the axle through a hole in my bench then attached it to this![IMG_20181026_062446|281x500](upload://7W8JG9cgqsLp3qpe6w1yBib3fn6.jpeg)
Then bolted that to a big slid hammer

Little update. I layed out all the components on some ply wood so I can make a buck for the vacuum former or for a fiberglass shell. It's going to be tight in there but I think it will work. I have accounted for wires and some foam and insulation aswell. 
 ![IMG_20181026_065205|281x500](upload://rgZbw5SyhdOxnXbs2akyWl2seJ8.jpeg)
And I glued some batteries together and made some insulators ![IMG_20181026_065142|690x388](upload://8CKvTIeTvPOHQey69ZdK0dN85sH.jpeg)

@moon so the battery already has am insulator under the heat shrink. The blue ring. ![20700|511x500](upload://m7Mb5q4b4ddTkop6MCycXhjitC.jpeg)
Surly this with the cardboard insulation will be enough to prevent shorts. Altho I would feel more comfortable putting proper fish paper rings in I can't seem to find them from a reputable source for 20700 cells.

That bluepart is probably part of the heatshrink, which is very thin. Cardboard is better than nothing but might aswell get the real deal

I found some in my country

Not really :expressionless: . It welds and the timing control works well but I don't think it has the finesse to get consistent welds. it doesn't have any current control only timing. I have a local electric vehicle shop and I'm going to ask them to do the welding once the new insulating rings show up. I'd rather know the welds are good then risk it. I'll find another use for my welder and it was fun to make it so no regrets.

Tonight's update I am prototypeing some motor mounts. The mount works so I'm going to make the flat part out of 4mm carbon fiber and the ring out of 10mm aluminium.
I found out that getting someone to vacuum form something is prohibitively expensive unless you want to make hundreds of them. (could be an option.) so I'm back to fiberglass. I have had to re make the mold with some release angle on the coplartments so that should be ready to glass tomorrow.

1st ride tonight. very excited. Still took the time to find my helmet and some shoes. Jerryriged a couple of 4s 5000mah lipos in a box bolted to the back. Had some issues with motor set up. The hall detection didn't go so well and its intermittent. Some times it is perfect sometimes it doesn't find any or only 2. I'll get some JST PH 6 pin plugs tomorrow and remove my doggy splices and my second hand sensor plugs. Might help. Still rides buttery smooth.

Yer the Box on the back is just so I could quickly throw the unity and some RC car batteries in it, get it up and running to make sure things like the mounts and the ESC work. It's held on with  the 4 bolts that hold the truck on. i have been riding it to work every day but thats only a 6km round trip and ill be moving soon and will have a 30km round trip. Eventually Ill replace the box with an under deck enclosure from eBoosted but someone from the states needs to lend him a trampa carver deck so he can make an enclosure for 20700 cells. End goal is a 10s 17Ah pack and a low power draw for crazy range.
