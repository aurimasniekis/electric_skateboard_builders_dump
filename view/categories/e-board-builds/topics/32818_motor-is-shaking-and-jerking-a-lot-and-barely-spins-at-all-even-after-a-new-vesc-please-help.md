even when my motor is connected to nothing it gives me some resistantce. when plugged in it gives bad motor detection. it shakes and jerks alot

Your motor is very likely to have shorted, if it did dont use it it will fry your controller.

Did you ride it alot, what battery count do you use, did you ride hills or flats?

If its new, maybe it isnt burned out, startup stutter is common on an unsensored motor. Do you have another brushless motor to compare the rolling resistance. It is normal for a motor to have some rolling resistance, when you turn it by hand you will feel magnets as you are rotating. In case it is burned out turning it will feel smooth, with energy sucking resistance.

But the bad motor detection is weird, i really dont know my vesc stuff so you should probably wait for someone to chime in.
Maybe put VESC in the title of the thread.

Hey there @dg798

This sounds exactly like my motor did when i got it. My issue was the motor mount screws were shorting the motor out. Try loosening the mounting screws a bit and spinning the motor. If that works file down your mounting screws little by little until they can be tight but not short the motor.

On a lot of motors you can literally look in the side at the end to see if the screws are touching/close to the windings. #randomTips

have you tried swapping your phase wires around?

That could be it, make sure the middle wire coming from your motor is plugged into the middle wire of the VESC

Check you phase wire connections. 
If one of your phase wires is not connecting, the motor will just shake and studder and fail detection. 
Cold solder joints can cause poor or no connection

If your motor was shorted, you would not be able to spin the motor by hand. It would act like the brakes where on

Also make sure that the circlip on the moto shaft is not rubbing on the mounting plate. 

If you have sensors connected. Try detection without sensors.

I already watched the video
I didn't say to swap the phase wires. 
I said to check the connections for cold solder joints. 
If the circlip is rubbing on the plate, you don't move the circlip, you have to grind the slot in the plate larger so it clears.

I believe your problem is a bad connection in one of the phase wires. 
You'll need shrink tube and a hot air gun. 
Remove the shrink tube from the connectors on the Vesc wires and the motor wires. 
Then take pics of them and post so we can see
You can sometimes find the bad connection by holding each wire while twisting and pulling on the connectors. If one of them breaks loose, then you have the culprit.

It's not my vesc because this one is brand new and it's also my second one because my first one did the same thing. When I get home I will see if I can post a pic of the motor wires

```
It could also very likely be that your internal phase wires are **_close_** together before the windings

This can mean that turning by hand it isn't a big issue, but once some power is sent down the phase wires it can arc out and start jumping between phases

Another possibility is that your phase wire insulation is cut around the opening of the motor and are shorting on the casing. 

I would check this out by seeing how strong your brake is when applying a slight brake with your VESC. If it's really stiff you definitely have shorted phase wires.

If you get no braking when applying full brake then i will be a bad connection to your phase wires.

Did u simply try the bldc test on the computer.  Easiest way to see if its shorted in my experience. And it sounds like its not going to pass. Shorted.

Send it back to where it came from if it is within the warranty period. It's obviously not your Vesc/what remains is the motor. Fooling around with it will most likely not solve anything and just void your warranty.
