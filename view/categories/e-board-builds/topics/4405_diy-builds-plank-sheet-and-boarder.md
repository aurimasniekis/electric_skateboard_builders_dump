Great thread! :smile: Sorry to hear about your first board, that kind of stuff happens even to best of us (when drunk). Did you try the nuclear penguing in Viisikulma Brewdog pub? :beers:

E-boarding is legal here in Finland if your boards max speed is 25km/h (pfffff!) and maximum power output is 1kW. If you ride faster than 15km/h you have to use bike lines or the street (just like the cyclists). Protip: Helsinki buss drivers are crazy.

Government  adjusted the laws just this year so last summer it was in the gray zone. and the 25km/h i understand for the minors, but can't grown up man deside the way to go? 
And yes i drank penguin in Brewdog pub. I think they dont make that anymore, instead they have bismarck which is 40%. Thank god in Vaasa almost every street is for walking/bicycle so i dont have to go in the traffic if i dont want to :D
