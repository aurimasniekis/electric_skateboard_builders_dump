Why titanium and not Al6061 or if you wanna go crazy Al7075? Titanium has a factor 10 lower thermal conductivity compared to aluminium!

Yeah, but you kind of want to connect motor mount thermally to the truck hanger. Your truck hanger will have a much larger thermal mass than the thin motor plate. Kind of don't see the sense in using Ti.

That's true but if you design them right from the start then why should they break? And the plates are made from Al6061 which is fine. Why not all made of the same material?.

As I said before, I would use AL7075 for all parts (motor mount and clamp) to not interrupt the thermal flow into the hanger but that's just my personal opinion. If you are insisting on making the thingy out of Ti why not both? It's usually the long bit that falls apart and not the actual clamp. Also, machining Ti is a bit of a PITA.

A block of titanium large enough for you to machine that hanger is going to cost you way more than the same block in aluminum. [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/#titanium/=1bfkmzt) doesn't even have blocks large enough to machine a hanger.

Even 7075 is going to be somehow expensive (see below). Got a preliminary quote for two hangers made out of 7075 including hard anodizing for $900 (AUD) :face_with_raised_eyebrow: 

Material price (from McMaster)
6061 Aluminum, 1" Thick x 10" Wide x 1/2 foot long is approx. $46
7075 Aluminum, 1" Thick x 12" Wide x 6" Length is approx. $138

## \#44 Posted by: Pedrodemio Posted at: 2018-02-05T16:13:09.838Z Reads: 153

Titanium is totally overkill for our application, if you have experience with low alloy aluminum and thread stripping, that's understandable, the 7075-T6 holds threads nicelly, just follow some general design guidelines, like the effective thread being 2X the hole diameter os more for aluminum and you are good

If you still think that's really necessary go to steel, 1020 works, would be a little bit heavier, but since the clamp has small amount of material it wound't matter

Do you mean that for a M6 bolt you should tap a M6 thread in a 3mm hole? That gotta be wrong..

those aren't the Ollin vescs. The Ollins were heat shrinked and covered in glue, and you said you wanted the clean ones. The ones you got are macrofab produced Enertion vescs that have been repaired and modified by @JohnnyMeduse, so they're still solid.

No no, you need to drill with the adequate size for the thread you intend, M3 is 2.5mm. I mean the delete of the hole should be at least 6mm, a little bit more becouse you can thread all the way to the end

Fore the bore diameter it's roughly thread diameter minus the thread pitch. So for an M6x1 thread you need bore a 5 mm hole. The counterpart, hence the clamp, should be at least twice the thickness of the thread (2x6 mm) as Pedrodemio already pointed out. 

If you can afford 7075-T6 for the hanger, go for it.
```

Yeah, I know. I usually use a bore diameter which is 80-90% of the thread diameter.. So for M6; 4.8-5.4mm. 
This method has never failed me :slight_smile:
