Hi guys. I'm considering building my first E skate out of my old longboard deck. I would appreciate  

This is what I need out of the setup with the most important aspects first:
(1) SAFETY- I need this board to be the safest board possible- this applies to braking, batteries, motors, controller connectivity. I dont want anything overheating or cutting out unexpectedly. Although I am experienced at longboarding, foot braking and sliding, I want this board to watch out for me, hence the name.
(2) TORQUE- I am not interested in a high top speed, 15 mph is sufficient; however my commute home involves  1 km flat, 700m at approx 11-13% gradient, then 500m flat and finally 250m up an 16-20% gradient. if it can make it up and DOWN these hills, it would be great. (I weigh 70 kg) 
(3) Good Value- My budget is max $1600 Australian dollars. Ideally I would spend less but what I am looking for is a long term solution. I need everything but the deck for this price. 
(4) discrete- Eskates are not very legal in New Zealand (doubt police know this so as long as I ride respectfully I should be ok)but I want something that will look like a (legal) longboard as much as possible
(5)range - 10 km is enough, can take all night to charge if it wants, as long as it doesnt overheat/damage

**The parts I am quite sure I want:**
Enertion space cell pro 3 
1 or 2 Enertion VESCs

**The parts I need advice on:**
Enertion remote or Nunchuck from Jacob's website- 
Nunchuck- does blootooth have a reliable connection? 
Michael from wellington had issues with Enertion remote connectivity. 
Not considering the GT2B for discretion concerns but I'd consider a pre-made mod like the bad wolf one if available, best if works easily with the VESC

Brake board trucks with Jacob hubmotors mounted on them
or jacob's paris 180's with Jacob hubmotors 
or Enertion trucks with R-spec Dual 6355 motors 


**In an ideal world** I would want to send Jacob some brakeboard trucks, him to fit his hub motors onto the braking trucks as they need that small screw in the side of the hangars, these would go in the rear and I would have a regular brakeboard trucks in the front. this would give me mechanical brakes if needed or electric brakes to recharge the battery.

if this was not possible I would then resort to having Jacob's hub motors on the rear/front  of my board pulling/pushing me and the regular brakeboard trucks on the rear/ front. What would be the best configuration? I could flip my symmetrical shaped board around for uphill/downhill if that helps 

If Jacobs hub motors cant get my 70kg load up the hills I described on the way home or the brake board/hub motors on the front of the board then I would have to settle for dual R-spec 6355 motors and not be able to afford brakeboard trucks, which I like the look of, and give me more peace of mind

Maybe worth mentioning I would have to connect the individual cells of the PRO 3 as NZ law makes it impossible to ship it as a whole unit according to Jason- I dont have a spot welder, just a soldering iron.

Thanks in advance for any help/tips

If your looking for hill climbing. 12S Dual Rear works great.

I'm riding [12S3P EPOWER Pack](product/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-12s3p/), [Dual Rear 6355 230KV](product/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-230kv-2650w/), [Dual 12S TB ESC](product/torqueboards-12s-120a-car-esc-opto-hv/).

I climb 20-30% inclines and brakes work perfectly for stopping. If you use our [2.4ghz Mini Remote](product/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller/) it's 100% reliable with no drops. I've ridden well over 4k miles with no drops. Nunchuck will drop occasionally however some people have gotten it to work.

[/quote]

@Luke if safety is your priority, the nunchuck is not a good choice. There are countless posts about trouble with them. My personal experience has been that they are not reliable enough for esk8. Modded GT2B or the "steez" remote you're looking at are more reliable. You could also consider @torqueboards mini-remote. 

The current opinion in the community (someone correct if I'm wrong) is that a geared setup will produce better torque than the current hub motor offerings. If big hills are a part of your commute, a geared setup will probably work better, although there are plenty of instances where hub motors can climb.

I'd suggest trying out the braking with your esk8 before you add the brakeboard setup into the mix. I've found the brakes I have to be completely reliable and strong enough for every situation. Unless you're doing major downhill runs (and why would you do that on an esk8?) I think that the added mechanical breaks are superfluous. I'd do a single-rear or dual-rear setup, try it out, and if you need more braking power add them to the front.

@Luke - 12S is a nice to have but not needed. You can climb hills on 10S.

Yeah, I'm not to fond of any bluetooth controller as they are suspetible to interference.

Thanks @chaka, good point! @Luke the most reliable remote options are GT2B or other RC remote that doesn't use BT. A lot of folks seem happy with the Steez remote, but I think there's no question that in terms of reliability RC remotes are currently the most reliable.

Torque is a function of motor kv, gearing and current.  Based on early reviews of Jacob's hubz, they'll have plenty of torque, but they will want to draw a lot of amps to do so.  With the Space Cell pro 3, you're fuse-limited to 40 amps, or 20 per motor.  I believe the limit is set to protect the VESC/motor, but Chaka's VESCs can handle up to 80 amps each iirc.  Now 20 amps per Jacob-hub may still provide enough torque for your needs, but it's a hard ceiling that you wouldn't have with another battery pack provided the batteries are high-discharge.

If torque and cost are your biggest concerns you probably want to go with an outrunner setup.  If stealth is really important, Jacob's hubs with VESCs rated for high amps will probably do the trick but you might need a different battery system.

Thank you for all this advice guys! it really helps, here's where i'm at after reading this:

you guys seem confident in the GT2B mods, I'll forget about the brakeboard trucks until a later date, I might stick some in the front if I lose connection or they become cheaper for 1 truck.

Is there a major difference between the 2.4 ghz controller by torque boards and the flatline customs mod shell+GT2B ? I like that the torque boards one is pre built and not completely unwieldy and while the flatline mod is smaller it would require assembly, something that I could get wrong (can I). can they both connect to the VESC easily enough?

Should I be considering tourqueboard's car ECS at all? they looked simple to programme and suited for dual motors but no idea how many amps they can handle?

to draw more amps from a battery I do I need more cells in series (12s) or will 10 series with a different fuse limit work? 
I'm concerned that getting any other lithium ion single charger battery (like the tourque boards 12s 3 p) into New Zealand apart from the space cell would be difficult because batteries can only be sent as single cells here. 

If I understand right, enertion vescs can handle 50 amps continuous according to the website, chaka vescs can handle 80 amps continuous. Torqueboard vescs can handle 50 amps according to the diy website. Would the increase in amps from 50 to 80 be worth $70 per VESC (+shipping)? 

I'm quite keen on Jacob's hub motors, they seem to have enough torque, are compact, clean and well priced.
Basically I need to know what component is limiting the amps to 20 per wheel, the 10 series space cell, the fuse (can that be changed), or the dual VESCs.

I checked http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller and It says that his vesc can handle 50amps continuous like the other vescs. 
would having 2 vescs mean that they can share the amps? so if a battery output 40/60 amps then would each vesc in a dual setup handle 20/30 amps each, sharing the current?

With dual VESC's, from what I understand, the limiting factor will be the battery (One of the reasons why I'm planning to eventually upgrade my space cell 3 to a space cell 4). The 18650 cells in Enertion's batteries can handle 20A continuous so a 10s3p pack can output 3*20A = 60A continuous which would be 30A per VESC. Keep in mind though that even if you were to replace the 40A fuse in the battery with a 60A fuse, from memory, the BMS (battery management system) in the current space cells can handle 50A continuous so this is where your bottleneck would be. I think @onloop has mentioned that eventually the new space cells will come with a newer custom built BMS which may well be able to handle more current?

Thanks for the input Michael, if I understand you correctly, the space cell pro 3 can output 20amps*3 parallels sets=60 amps 
Dual vescs can handle this no problem as 60 amps/2=30 amps per vesc, less then their 50 amp limit. 
The Fuse is limiting the current to 40 amps total and the bms is limiting the current to 50. 
Can the bms and Fuse be changed to deliver 60 amps in total? Or Is this getting too experimental/unsafe?

Based on my understanding that's correct. The fuse is super easy to replace. You can certainly change the BMS as well but you'll just have to confirm with someone here that has a bit more experience that the BMS you pick is suitable for our type of usage.

Seems a little over-the-top to take an integrated battery system like the space cell and start replacing fuses, BMS, etc just for a couple more peak amps. I mean, the fuse, sure you could get away with 50a instead of 40. But that BMS would take a some work to get wired up and you'd be junking a perfectly good BMS for 10 more peak amps which you might not even need. 

I stand by the assertion that hubs need a battery system with a high discharge capacity if you're 70 kg and want to fly up steep hills.  The highest discharge capacity is in some of the fancier LiPo packs like the nanospecs. But then you're dealing with the headache of custom enclosures, wiring & charging issues, possible battery failure and fires...Rc LiPo packs don't quite fit your "safety first" requirement. 

Maybe try out the space cell 3 with the hubs and then look at yanking the 40a fuse if the torque isn't there. Worst case, you might have to get a rolling start to make it up the steeper hills.  That setup should fly once you get rolling.

Was just discussing with Michael what a waste of an integrated bms this would be. I might wait to see if @onloop has a pro 3 which incorporates a bms with a higher output In the pipeline. I'm more than happy to give the board a rolling start if that's what is holding me back.

@Luke based on your main goal ( torque) I think you should go with a geared setup with outrunners. Unless you're adding a new priority, which is that you want hubmotors for the aesthetics. You could start with a single out runner motor and a single vesc and test it out in your area and on your commute. If it isn't enough, you can add another. 

I think you'll be surprised by how much power a single motor can deliver. That's what I use, and I've got more speed and torque than I can handle! I actually cap the speed of my build through an RPM limit, because I don't want to go faster than 22mph as a top speed. I can climb any hill I've come across, and I use 8S.

I appreciate your opinion. I will  Be trying out Michael's single 6473 r spec motor up my ~18% gradient Hill this weekend, I told it'll give me a good idea how much torque I would need. I was told that dual motors are useful for braking because of traction however, I'll be keeping that in mind

just an update and a couple further questions.
I have purchased Jacob's hub Motors (wheels&trucks) and a  an enertion style wireless receiver in @Jack's group buy.
 I wanted to use two enertion vescs and connect these to a space cell.
@EnertionSupport told me that their vescs dont come with a Canbus.
Is this wire appropriate to use :

Also do I need to buy a Y connector to connect two vescs to a single xt-60 plug ?

Yes, heat-shrinking them also helps to prevent shorts, and keeps the VESC clean from any debris or particulates that enter the enclosure.

Just finished a talk with the engineer who was only supposed to help me with wiring the li ion batteries together. He told me that it would be a shame to put the discretion and potential weight of a board saved of the hub motors to waste by adding a space cell to my deck. 
He recommended putting a 10s3p pack of 18650 cells and a bms into my backpack, with a thick enough lead to eliminate resistance running from my backpack down my leg into a quick release version of the xt60. This plug would poke through a hole drilled through my deck. 
Oh the bottom of my deck, dual, canbus connected vescs and a reviever would sit semi flush mounted on the bottom of my deck, connecting to the hub motors and the xt60 equivalent plug. Anyone see any immediate warning lights flashing? The engineer who suggested this said this build would be well within his comfort zone and he'd be willing to help me when I'm stuck, and will router the board so the vescs sit flush. 
ive attached a sketchup of what i mean for clarity.

How does moving the battery to your backpack help? The board will still have the same load and it just leaves you with a wire to get tangled with. And when you finish riding your board to class or something then you have to carry the battery and you will have less space. 

Doesn't sound the best

lol, that will be unpractical. I suggest you to put the pack under the board, maybe you can build a very flat large pack if you want to maximize the stealthyness... just paint everything black / dark color, hide the motor cables and you will be fine, people barely notice the difference at least here in London, UK, with one or two well-timed pushes and low acceleration when travelling in crowded places I don't think anybody will notice.

the shoe idea is pretty cool though :p but again, impractical. You'd need special shoes and do you really see yourself fitting a wire through your pants, putting on special shoes and using a special backpack for that quick ride to the supermarket?

Having everything on the board will increase the possibility of you using the board. And isn't that what we want the most :p?

And if your main priority is stealth and making it not look like an electric skateboard, I think the most practical solution for that would be to hide everythin ON the board in like a toolbox, people would just think you're transporting something.

If practicality is main priority, just mount everything underneath, depending on the time and effort you put into it you can certainly achieve some stealthy looks

Jep that sounds like the best solution. Make sure you still keep the strength of your board. And even if something sticks out from the bottom, you can still make a very tapered cover that covers the entire board. There are some pretty thick longboard out there, so a tapered cover won't catch attention

I liked your recent build with push assist :D I'd like that as a future project, but maybe not for my first build.
I was pretty keen on a remote to make sure i can ascend/descend hills without worrying about foot placement. I'll stick with that. 
My main reasoning for going for the space cell was convenience, and knowing that liion seems to be safer than lipos.
I didn't think that 18650 cells were too thick. would a flat pack of lipos be so much slimmer than that?

For real? Havent you seen the pictures? A 6S lipo flat pack is about 5mm thick 12S around 10mm thick plus the thickness of a shrink wrap I guess.. either way much thinner than a cylinder package.

Struggling to find a good way of charging multiple lipo packs, I considered doing it like the space cell with a bms and simple charging port but its all getting a little uncertain. also figured out that it would cost about the same as a space cell if not more:
5*2s 8000mah zippy batteries for 37v, 300 watt hours=230AUD
Dave's custom enclosure=65+AUD
BMS= 100 AUD
led display=~20 AUD
Charger=50 + AUD
this comes to around the same as the space cell. even if i found a way to charge the lipos, still think it's worth it at the same price of a space cell?

@mccloed I was told you did something like this with an 8s lipo for @psychotiller. any tips or ideas would be appreciated for a 10s that can be charged simply :slight_smile:

I used to own a Nelson Spindrift longboard (similar to a landyachtz switchblade)
the friend i gave it to years ago got excited by my build and wants to donate it back to me if I want to use it.
since it is so low to the ground, it would normally be a bad idea to use it for an Esk8, however I plan for my build to be at maximum the thickness of the space cell and using hubs instead of motors. It will give me a bigger platform to fit things in more comfortably. 
Does anyone have any big warnings about such a deck?

Hey so I just recieved some JST connecting wires. do they look ok to connect 2 vescs?
And since there's only female connectors on 1 end of each wire should I just solder bare wires to the middle pins  or rather solder 2 wires like in the bottom picture and heat shrink the connections?

Hey guys i have this parallel connector to go from the battery to 2 vescs. I keep reading that one should use 10 guage wiring however I realised that mine is 14 gauge wiring. I looked up how many amps 14 gauge wire can handle and It's 32 amps. I plan to draw 40, maybe 50 amps in total from both vescs, so 20 to 25 max per vesc. I think it will be safe to use this but I am just asking because I will not like the smell of burning when im riding my board.

Excuse the lack of vescs in the picture.

 And I followed @lox897's advice with connecting the three xt-60's together in parallel, used hot glue as well as heat shrink after I soldered the connectors together.

For the grub screw I used M3x6 with Philips head I just dremeled the head to clear the motor. With the grub screw it comes with good luck removing it because it tightens with use.

Hey guys, everything has finally arrived and I will be putting this build together on sunday, 
Theres a little issue that the Vescs dont fit very easily in the space cell enclosure. I though that If I drilled holes into the end of the enclosure for the phase wires to stick out of then they would fit easier..
In any case- I need to re-do the parallel connector so that it's got wires in between the xt-60's 
I just called up the main electronic stores in town and the only one with close to 10 guage wire has 8 guage, single core, flexible wire. Will this work, otherwise I will need to get it from overseas and I dont want to wait :D
Here's a video of the vescs if that helps:

Hey Luke, just drill through the enclosure to get your motor cables out and add some hot glue around the drill holes to keep the cables steady and seal it as well. Then maybe you can cut half of each VESC battery cables and resolder the XT-60's. Then just make an adapter like @Michaelinvegas said and you'll be good to go!

I want to cut away the plastic wrap around the vescs and discard it.
Then I want to add heat shrink to the pcb from the bottom end up to the mosfets, leaving them bare.
Then I want to add a thin slice of heatshrink from the mosfets to the Phase wire. 
Finally I want to use some heatsinks. I will apply thermal glue to the bare mosfets, and attach the heatsinks.


Next (unusual) step:
I want to be able to remove my vesc easily if needed, but have it securely fitted to the enclosure, while dampening vibration.
Does it make sense to use a piece of foam, make cutouts for the caps and heatsinks, 
I attach the foam securely to the enclosure
the vesc is attached via friction fit to the foam. 
The vesc can have a weak adhesive or velcro to the foam too. 
The vesc is protected from vibration, can be removed easily and should be secured in there.

Quick question about amps:
I have 2 motors, 2 vescs and 1 space cell pro 3:
Pro 3 can handle 40 amps discharge rating and 12 amps charge rating
Should I be setting the battery max and min on each vesc at:
Batt max: 40 amps
Batt Min: 12 amps
(This is what @lowGuido told me just now as vescs are connected in parallel )
Batt max: 20 amps
Batt min: 12 amps
(as Jacob's video depicts)
Batt max:20 amps
Batt min:6 amps
(this is what made sense to me at first, as there are 2 vescs and 1 space cell)

Hey, just an update and a question. 
Update: 
The board is fantastic! It's not as efficient as outboard motors but it has plenty of torque to get me up a 1km 10% hill and a 200 meter 20% hill. I get all sorts of looks on it. The utathane was slipping but it's all fixed now with some double sided tape. 
Question:
The main thing I would change about this is the portability. At 41 inches it's not exactly easy to carry around university. I've been thinking about putting the setup on a skateboard. 
This would involve mounting the trucks on the nose and tail of the skateboard (I have done this before, unpowered, if worked well enough) and the space cell along the flat part of the skateboard. The expected problem is clearance for the space cell. Should I stop dreaming about this idea or is it something worth trying?
Picture for reference. Will be using 83mm wheels

I am a pro-strap advocate, but this is dangerous!! With straps, you can stay locked into the board, but you should always have a way to bail if things get scary. If this thing randomly decides to go full speed. The only way out is to fall- and fall forward most likely. You are completely trapped in! You ride with this and there is a high likelihood of eating s#!t.

Do you mean length wise? The space cell is 560mm but about 150mm of it is empty space because it's only a pro 3 not a pro 4. I've been thinking about cutting it down, but let's assume it fits onto a skateboard lengthwise as it is.
I'm not selling you or anybody my space cell, sorry

Thanks for this, this is exactly what I was thinking of. Looked like he has plenty of clearance. I would have 4mm less. 
He also mentioned a 19.5" wheelbase, I think I'd need 20.5 unless I make a little alteration to the space cell. Not sure if I'll even like this so I probably won't sacrifice my enclosure for the possibility of liking it. I'll go to a skate shop and measure!

The new Space Cell enclosure should fit. I'm a little lazy to do the math conversions but here's the specs on my custom one:

Exterior Measurements: L: 20" W: 8" H: 2" 
Internal Measurements: L: 17.75" W: 5.25" H: 1.75"

Bought a skateboard deck, will try it out in the next week.. For now I got this issue.. Not sure if it's battery, vesc or (most likely) motor related. My motor had a short circuit a few days ago, but luckily an electrician eskater lives around the corner from me and kindly fixed it. Everything worked perfectly last night. I left my space cell plugged in till the green light popped up which I try to avoid. I watched a couple Casey videos and it made me want to go skate, I carried my board 90% down my hill and rode it down the rest using the brakes to stop. Seemed to work ok. When I applied power I hardly moved and it's been the same since..  The only wheel that moves only moves slightly, and it's connected to the slave vesc. https://youtu.be/hmf-B8Wm5aU
Here's some bldc tool stuff to check for fault codes

to confirm it's the actual motor I would remove the slave/master configuration and go with single for now.
It's odd that vesc that's actually delivering power to a motor is only showing a duty cycle of 4-5% and the other is showing 95% (I'm assuming you have the remote at full throttle).

So first setup Vesc 1 with motor 1 test
then Vesc 1 with motor 2 test
then Vesc 2 with motor 1 test
then Vesc 2 with motor 2 test

That will help eliminate a lot of possibilities. 
Also do a motor detection with those tests on top of using your remote. Do not use any Can bus setup though.

Thanks for the reply @racidon . I tried doing what you told me to do (it's almost 3am, i made some silly mistakes in the video like not writing configuration, just ignore that for a sec)
here's what happened (watch only up to 4 minutes unless you wanna cringe):
This is Vesc 1 with both motors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfWJhryBdTk
Then you can watch this for vesc 2 with both motors:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFZXdrlVbQA
Finally I put the canbus wire back in just to see what effect the canbus has:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2ZONUwfrGY
So from what i gather, both vescs are fine
1 motor is fine, the other has some serious issues which probably have to do with shorting out a couple days ago
the canbus may be playing up

thanks for your help I should sleep, I look forward to your thoughts on this, please dont make fun of me not being able to set up a remote :P

[quote="Luke, post:113, topic:2912, full:true"]....Too much to quote :)

Hey mate, what I say you can take with a grain of salt because I have probably just as much experience with eboards and the like as you do. 
However from what I can see your problem might be a broken connection in your "dodgey" motor (the one that wouldn't move).

Why does your other one spaz out with the canbus? Without knowing how these systems work, I'd say for obvious reasons the VESC will try to balance the speed of other motors it has slaved/mastered up with to prevent one going at a super high speed in comparison to another. So there's no other motor connected according to the other vesc and thus it reduces your duty cycle when slaved up. That's why the good motor works fine on both VESCs without the canbus.
An example would be a parent crossing the road with their child, although they might take steps no faster than that of the child, their steps will take them further and thus a parent needs to reduce the rate at which they walk so they don't end up dragging the child across the road.

What might be the problem here?
I would be willing to bet that it is likely a burnt out or broken phase wire for your dodgey motor or it's seized (more likely the first).
How can you check this easily?
Try to turn it by hand, does it feel the same as your other one? aka not harder to turn in comparison?
If no you still have a short, but I doubt this as I would assume this would kill your DRV like it did mine

If yes then lets test all 3 phase wires, this step please note that you are essentially shorting the motor out, so nothing electrically sensitive should be hooked up to the motor at the time.
Join 2 of the phase wires together temporarily and try to turn the motor by hand, does it get harder when they are joined? (No - you have a broken connection in one of these wires)
Do this so you test all combinations

Lets call them phase 1 2 and 3

join 1 and 2
join 1 and 3
join 2 and 3

try all three and report your findings :slight_smile:
btw the videos like this help ALOT so good work :)

Hey, I will wait till I have some that knows what they're doing to do that with me. @blair will be able to describe the issue perfectly as he is the one that fixed the short originally. The broken motor is slightly harder to turn, but when it originally shorted it had brakes on full. Blair said that a little more resistance is to be expected as its lived a harder (2 week) life. I will do the try tests described on Friday if a family friend is available to supervise

Hey I haven't been able to meet up with people that know what they're doing yet. I can probably set up a livestream for people to check what I'm doing so I don't shock myself/my equipment. 
I'm just reading this thread, can you see this being what would be necessary? 
[quote="onloop, post:35, topic:6474"]
cut off the shrink tube the goes around the three wires
then push the 3 phase wires back through the hole that they exit from, do it one at a time.
then you can unravel the wire & insulate the excess amount.
you might also decide to fix the wires in place with some epoxy to prevent movement.


this should resolve the issue & everything will work perfectly again.

I was hoping to do that when we did the original fix but the wires disappear into epoxy making it a lot harder

@racidon If you meant touching the bullet connectors together and doing that test, I tried those combinations today and the motor didn't get any harder to spin at any point. The motor wasn't connected to the vesc or anything I just touched the bullets together.. Not sure if that's what you asked me to do

Yes that's what I meant. 
If you also do this test on your other motor you will notice that it becomes harder to turn. If the "broken" motor is no where near harder to turn in comparison to your working one I would say it has broken phase wires somewhere.
If it is the same as the "broken" motor then your broken motor is still shorting.

Ok will try tomorrow, so if the working motor is hard to turn when I touch the bullets together it's likely to be a phase wire issue in the broken motor. 
If the working motor is not any harder to turn with bullets together it's likely that the broken motor has short circuiting issues. Do I understand you correctly?

My second motor stopped working. This time I think it's a phase wire issue as I did the test that @racidon told me to do. When I touch 2 bullet connectors together, the motor brakes.

So I'm wanting to replace my remote, I want no issues with dropouts but I also don't want the unwieldy size of the gt2b so I'll have to get an enclosure . I know I want either 
The gt2b
The bench wheel remote 
The trigger style mini remote 
Are all of these essentially dropout free or has anyone had dropouts issues with the last 2
```

Thanks for the input guys-
I like that the benchwheel remote is lithium rechargeable, small, has throttle settings and is apparently reliable
@XIII does the mini remote give you the option of limiting the throttle.  I know that there's two little knobs on the back of it.  and does it tell you when it's on low battery?since it's aa battery powered i cant charge it regularly.
if I can get my hands on a benchwheel remote for a decent price I'll try that based on @Jinra's recommendations  
If not i'll get the mini remote as long as it's got a low battery warning and some throttle control.
if not ill get the gt2b and this enclosure because im not confident in the 3d printers i have access to

there is only a throttle trim , and a led for when it's on.
You have 4000 mah and i did one year before recharing those batteries so no real need to worry

After riding dual 6355s (someone else's board)  I thought the brakes on them were not powerful enough, we had motor  min set to -20 and battery min set to -8 on each vesc on a 4p battery. Should the motor min be made stronger or should I just get brake board trucks if it's looking like I'm getting dual 6355s too?
