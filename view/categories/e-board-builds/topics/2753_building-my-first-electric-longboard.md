Hello,

I am building my first electric longboard and need some help choosing the components:

Board: http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160426/c16e09d2e4ee10314657bf1ce305d92b.jpg

Wheels: [here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/320841664427?_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)

Motor: I am thinking about this options:
1. [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-149kv](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__36656__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6374_149kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor_EU_Warehouse_.html)
2.[Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192kv](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__42024__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6374_192kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor_EU_Warehouse_.html)
3.[Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-275kv](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__36416__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_5065_275kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor_EU_warehouse_.html)
4.[Alien 5065 220KV 2200W](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-5065-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-220kv-2200w/)

ESC: [HobbyKing® ™ X-Car Beast Series ESC 1:8 Scale 120A](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__77154__HobbyKing_174_8482_X_Car_Beast_Series_ESC_1_8_Scale_120A_EU_Warehouse_.html)

Battery: [Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 25C Lipo Pack](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=9183)

This is my first longboard so I want it drive something like 15-25 km/h.

Do you have tips for me ?
Thank you,
Ofek

dont touch alien 

for the other 3

high kv= more speed less toque
low kv= less speed more toque


so if you have a lot of hills go 192 or 149
if you have no hills go 192 or 275

in the rc world and ours they are known for making sub-par electronics, the motor mounts they make are fine but esc's and motors tend to fail early.

Yes, the 192kv works fine with a 6S lipo.  On my build, it goes 19mph with a 16/36 gearing and 83mm wheels.  Enough touque to throw you off the board.

You could run it on 6s, but typically users will choose higher kv for a 6s system like a 245kv or 290kv.

Before I purchased the VESC, I used the trackstar ESC (on the black board now).  I made a guest e-skateboard because skating with a friend is a lot more fun.

You can probably use this for the gear pulley.
[Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HTD-5M-12T-16W-5-6-6-35-8mm-Bore-Pitch-5mm-Timing-Belt-Drive-Pulley-12-Tooth-/262265141996?var=&hash=item3d10387aec:m:mqPLXSwNb81pLApP7iWEZCw)

I'm not sure how to mount the wheel pulley to those wheels. All my wheels 83mm with plastic hubs.  You will probably need a belt that's 260-280mm diameter (depending on what motor mount you use).
