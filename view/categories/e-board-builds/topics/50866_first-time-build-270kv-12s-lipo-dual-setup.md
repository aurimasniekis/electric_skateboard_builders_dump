currently at the moment tested it with a 6s set up for the one motor as I am waiting on my new batteries and belts to arrive :slight_smile: ![54428871463__D5218E4E-43E7-4FA8-827B-A024F77713C5|375x500](upload://mRrc20su48RrkOlC4ZPB19GxAe3.jpeg)![54428869514__B341ACAD-B88F-4ED4-BF06-3736E23E5660|375x500](upload://yqAQ7NJRLGDoCzYMfdeTB1Txozq.jpeg) 

I have out in some paper cut outs of where everything would go

I wouldn't go 12s with those motors. Even 10s will push you over the 60000 erpm threshold. 8s will give you 5500 erpm.

Yup, itâ€™s not the ideal motors for 12s but you can always limit your Erpm to 60k.

190 seems to be ideal. They will be just under the erpm threshold but also give you torque. What is the goal of the build, speed or torque?

Just a balance charger board as i  either have to take them out and charge them separately

20mph is pretty easy to get with a Diy Esk8.
12s, 170kv 16/36 pulleys and 90mm wheels will top that speed.
