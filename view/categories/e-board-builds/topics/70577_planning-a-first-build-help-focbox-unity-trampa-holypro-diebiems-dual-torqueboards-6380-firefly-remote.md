Heya Guys. So I'm Planning my first build and I wanted to make sure that it was suitable, and compatible so who better than to ask than you nerds (sarcasm). If you have any feedback on the parts, please let me know! I'd rather learn from your experiences. 

Anywho, here's the parts list. I Hope to start slowly acquiring the parts, but obviously, im limited by my wallet, damn thing is always empty :roll_eyes:

[Deck-](http://www.trampaboards.com/35-holypro-trampa-mountainboard-deck--drilled-edged-fitted-with-jessop-grip-tape--a-marine-grade-stainless-steel-hex-head-bolt-kit-p-10139.html) 16ply 35Âº HOLYPRO MTB - STIFF (I'd like to get it like the HS11 deck does, without the holes in order to make this build as waterproof as possible)

[ESC-](https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/)FOCbox Unity (hoping this thing holds up to its reputation)

[BMS](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diebiems-v0-8-2nd-batch-total-48pcs-closed/58327/4)- DieBieMS

[Enclosure-](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/trampa-hs11-holypro-35-ds/) TRAMPA HS11/ HOLYPRO double depth enclosure by @Eboosted with a 12s8p cells (30q) to match)

[Motormount-](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motormounts-kits-for-trampa-e-mtb/15502)The Dual Mounts offered by @Idea. Eventually hoping for Toxx Direct Drives
 
[Motor(s)-](collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6380-170kv)Tourque Boards 6380. I've chosen this due to the hot climate where I live and figured that I could benefit from its slightly better thermals

[Trucks-](https://www.trampaboards.com/atb-mountainboard-spring-truck--16-inch-wide-p-26043.html)Trampa Vertigo Trucks with yellow Dampas

[Wheels-](https://www.trampaboards.com/superstar-8-inch-wheel--black-rim-with-black-anodised-spokes--black-alpha-8-inch-tyres-p-334.html) Trampa 8inch superstars

And on top of all of that I'm hoping to use the [Firefly remote](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2454391) by @solidgeek and the Metr. 

So some questions I have.

1. What charger would you guys recommend to use with the DieBieMS? I know it needs to be CCCV, but hoping for some tried and tested ones. 
_[this will work](https://www.meanwell.com/productPdf.aspx?i=327)_
2. Will I run into any issues using the Metr, Firely remote, and DieBieMS, which all need to connect into the Focbox? Like will I have enough support from the Focbox? 
_Likely not, in fact, they should all work together just fine, so yes, there is enough support from foxbox_
3. The DieBieMS has a power switch, but when I connect it to the focbox, will the focbox's "smart switch" also serve the BMS, or will I need to mount both switches? 
_Answered below, but the Focbox switch can just be bypassed (short the switch wires to create an "always on signal")_
4. Is the "smart switch" that comes with the Focbox an anti-spark switch? or will I need a dedicated one? 
_Both Switches (BMS and Unity) are antispark, so another one will not be needed, however, you do not have the "instant off" or "key" functionality that you have with a normal xt-90s pull switch)_
5. (finally) Any recommendations?

I appreciate those of you who took the time to read this, and look forward to any feedback you guys provide!
I look forward to this build, and hope thatr it'll be a blast to ride!

Edit: Answered some of my questions (14-10-18)

The hs11 is not longer available.
But itâ€™s not a big thing to close the holes with epoxy.

I was hoping that was not the case. For some reason, Epoxy worries me. It's not hard, i just worry about water ingress due to an improper bond with the board. Perhaps i should be looking for another deck? Perhaps the [TRAMPA 35 short](http://www.trampaboards.com/35-short-mountainboard-deck--drilled-edged-fitted-with-jessop-grip-tape--a-marine-grade-stainless-steel-hex-head-bolt-kit-p-871.html)?

Are there clear advantages/ disadvantages to the ESC's? Maybe a forum thread somewhere goes into this. But i havent been able to find clear answers, so i figureed it must rely on personal experience to dictate what is good, what is not.

I mean how you came to it that focbox or not good.
For sure itâ€™s micro electronics and...it always can be that you got a bad one. Doesnâ€™t matter from which company. Most of the vescs with mass production made in China and who knows how exactly they check them before shipped out.
Besides this, the focbox based on hw4.12 vescs,
which means you limited to a max erpm of 60000. Over that you risk to fry your focbox.
The advantage of vesc with hw 6.x is that they have a higher erpm limit 100000-150000 usually.
And most of them also can handle a bit more constant current.
If you compare the focbox with other vesc with 4.12 than focbox is definitely the way to go.
Reliable FOC and with stock heatsink up to 50a constant current is something the cheaper versions canâ€™t manage.

I see, So given the specs, do you think i would cross that RPM threshold to risk frying the FOCbox? Or should i be fine? Would it be more wise to just go for VESC with hw 6.x in order to get more from the board?
```

## \#18 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-10-09T19:44:04.504Z Reads: 154

I was speaking about the usual old focbox.
Just have seen you listed the unity.
Not sure about there limits but with 12s and 170kV motors you anyhow donâ€™t hit the erpm limit. Itâ€™s only critical if you run 12s with motors higher than 190kV.

Personally I have two focboxes, two Flipsky 6.6 and some escapes. They all a good choice.
If you looking for getting the unity and you have the time to wait iâ€˜m sure itâ€™s also worth itâ€˜s money.
If you want a cheaper dual esc look for the Flipsky dual 6. as long as you donâ€™t use there power switch they seem to be solid too.

## \#21 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-10-09T20:44:55.459Z Reads: 138

```
6374 usually give more than enough torque.
But I also have two 6384 170kv from aps.
Had some issues in the beginning but love them now.
Bigger motors always run cooler and you get a bit more breaking force.
I donâ€™t have any torque board parts yet, so I canâ€™t say anything about the motors, buuut I also didnâ€™t read anything bad about them so far.
If you donâ€™t mind the extra money and weight than go for the 6384.
If you want more speed than torque than look for some 190-200 kV motors.
If you plan to drive a lot off-road through dirt and maybe in rain too than I can recommend to get some sealed motors or as min open the motor and cover the sensors with some liquid tape or epoxy (or run unsensored).
To me it didnâ€™t happen yet luckily but I read that others blow there vesc because the sensors shorted due to water which came inside of the motor.

So, after some research, here are my thoughts.
1. Gonna attempt to waterproof a sensored motor.
2. Was thinking about switching deck. Instead of plugging holes, why wouldn't I go for something like an urban carver? Why did @trampa have to stop the hs11 :sweat_smile:  I don't know if there is a physical difference in the deck, but this would mean finding an appropriate enclosure for the urban carver that can fit 12s8p @Eboosted, would this be possible? If not then perhaps I should be looking at More traditional and popular longboard options that the forum like.
3. Battery choice, I've seen Samsung 30q used in so many builds, but have recently come across the Sony VTC6, which offer higher discharge, perhaps this would be a better alternative for such a build? Undecided.
4. Wheels from TRAMPA seem to have some QC issues, Perhaps I would be better off looking at alternatives. 
5. I've read that perhaps the Trampa Infinity is better than the Vertigo for such a build. Considering switching as well. 

Thats all that comes to mind right now.

Hi Zach, riding E-MTBs all the time, I can give you the advice to let your motors breath as much air as possible. Closed motors are not a good idea. Airflow has a huge impact on motor temp. 
Superstars never had any QC issues! If you tighten down your wheel nuts in a star pattern they rotate very precise. Most imbalances people experience are a matter of the tire and counterbalancing the valve correctly. 

ESC wise I can give you the advice to go for a design that uses 3 high side shunts. FOC operation depends on precise measurement of all motor phases. MTBs don't like compromises.
The strain on them is a lot higher than most people think.

Glad to hear about the superstars! Looks like i'll be keeping them there. 
Regarding the motors, thats what i was thinking, and hence why i went for 6384's (edge for the cooling) But i really don't want to compromise on the all terrain aspect of this build. Rain or shine, i want to be able to ride. So what do you think would be a good solution? 
And then with the ESC's? Is there a specific brand you recommend? So then powerwise, theunity would not be ideal, correct? 

Also, can you confirm the HS11 is discontinued? 
Thanks!

I wired mine all together in 10s referencing bits and pieces from other builds, then followed a Youtube video some teenager made and it has been going strong ever since. Have been able to hit an indicated 50km/h, with great range no disconnects or issues. 

I imagine the Unity will be even easier to hook up, since you do not have to worry about a canbus connector, no messing around with splitting battery outputs or fiddly bluetooth wiring. You won't even have to connect a USB and can program from their android app i believe.

The Unity plays quite nice with EMTB, ask @okp he's been riding our beta unit. 3 shunts vs 2 shunts doesn't make much of a difference as long as the 2-shunt design is done intelligently. Just requires a bit more thoughtful layout. 

Good luck with your build! I'm looking to get a setup with pneumatics going soon as well, though more for comfortable commuting.

To be honest, thats really the purpose of my build too. The area i live in is full of hills and paths and bumpy roads, so its close basic mountainboarding :p But for sure, with the terrain around here, theres no way i could run standard skate wheels, id be flying off the board every few metres. 
As for the Unity, i look forward to seeing other real world tests that can really prove its capabilities! I know countless hours and sleepless nights have gone into it, so i'd love for it to speak for itself and wow us all. Hopefully its the powerhouse i need! And if not, im sure Enertion will make something bigger and better ;)

@Deodand, unrelated question regarding ESC's. How feasible is it for a smart ESC like the unity to implement a feature that would allow users to connect to supported lights (like led strips)  to them to function as brake lights? Like when the throttle is decreased, a signal is sent, activating the lights which would signal to brake? This could then be improved to support multi-channel output (like for blinkers) which would be activated via the users remote, and be enforced by the ESC to activate the signal? Or is this already somewhat obtainable through CANBUS attachments?
Does this make sense? I'm not sure. But alas, with an ask, because I believe it could be an awesome feature to the market the Unity is targeting and could open a whole new development of esk8 safety.
```

## \#35 Posted by: Deodand Posted at: 2018-10-15T16:53:59.242Z Reads: 108

```
Totally feasible, there's actually already some stuff in the vesc codebase for controlling rgb strips but is a bit different. We were discussing maybe a new port standard for connecting smart lights. but that would be on next-gen unities. The main thing is around power delivery/voltage regulation for a standardized port. I.E. do the lights take raw eskate battery voltage which varies widely or does the unity 2.0 provide something like a 12 V 2 Amp bus to tie peripherals to.  There's an onboard IMU could make side lights toggle with board lean for silliness (not as good as hand controlled blinkers obv). I'd love a front light that was like a shredlight but maybe 20x as bright and tied to my eskate battery. If the smart lights take raw battery voltage could just hook them up through CAN bus easy enough. 


Anyways, topic for another thread but it's on our radar. I want smart lights too!

Awesome to hear! Yeah methods of implementation would be interesting but i think its a step in the right direction, one way or another, especially when you consider how awesome it would be to have blinker buttons on your remote and automatic braking lights. You'd be like a car with more torque and less weight!

Planning accessory power setup. Extra switch, what accessories to have, etc) 
Trying to plan a new method for safety lighting for esk8. Perhaps a new remote design with a trigger,  Oled screen for data from VESC, programmable buttons for thumb controls, Deadmans switch (or programmable switch) 18650 Battery? , USB-C? All just thoughts for now but how to actualize a plan soon.

However, if it's any help, when I think about the builds that I've seen, I can't imagine the DS (12s8p) enclosure on 5inch wheels if you're using the trampa trucks. But that's just speculation.

Just found some more pictures of single stacked  12s4p battery packs on the underside and someone's build and I think the clearance would just be a few mm from the ground with 5" wheels. thought about using fatboy 35Â° risers for normal longboards and just reversing them to change Â° of the trampa trucks and adding risers. Not sure how that would go or if its possible. Reluctant to use pneumatic wheels for my build since I'd rather use urethane for the benefits of those and longer range vs pneumatic

I don't think you'd really reap any benefits from that (the riser idea). To be honest, it wouldn't even make sense going for a trampa at that point. What range are you hoping for? You'd definitely lose range with the pneumatic wheels, but hell, you'd still have decent range, especially if you ride conservatively and on friendly terrain. Or if range is a big concern, you could drop the s-count and increase p-groups. I know people have put gummies on a la Croix, which is a single stacked, maybe check those builds out? might serve for inspiration

Purpose of it would to be increase clearance, and tbh not even sure how much clearance I should be going for i would think 1 inch is enough for riding on roads and bike paths. Since its 12s8p im trying to get 60 miles conservatively, and if pneumatics were my option itd be even less. Probably just gonna have to try slapping a bunch of risers maybe 2x 1/2 inch risers on it I guess more shock absorbtion anway. Guess thats my go to solution till I get to it

Okay man, you do you, just be careful with risers. The higher the centre of gravity, often the more unstable your ride will feel. Not to mention that, since the trampa lacks concave, and if you opt for no bindings, you may find yourself feeling like you're about to fall. But I get the situation you're in, and I hope you find a constructive way forward!

center of gravity is something I thought about with this, I am concerned about and that is why I am opting for bindings, not sure how much of a difference it would be since it still wouldnt be as high as 7+ inch tires currently I dont see many other solutions to my problem :( thanks though
