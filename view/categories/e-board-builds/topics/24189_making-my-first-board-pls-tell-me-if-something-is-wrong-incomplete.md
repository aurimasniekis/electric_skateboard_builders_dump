Looks Good, you dont have to get everything from diy tho, check this speed calc 
http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":0,"batt-cells":6,"motor-kv":213,"system-efficiency":80,"motor-pulley-teeth":15,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":83}|

Expect 1-2 months. Seems to be the average time.

Not sure what you have lying around but you are going to need a few feet of wire, I used 12 gauge but 10 is prolly better. Some connectors XT90's are a good bet and 2 XT60's for the VESC (unless you're gunna change those). Look into a BMS if you are doing 18650 cells (which looks like your plan) I noticed Enertion's website no longer has the complete batteries for sale :confused:. Also consider how you want to do a power switch/button and charging. Loop keys are cheap but there are better ways to do it.

Hope this wasn't too confusing of a post, it's not as neat as I usually try to make them.

Just some advice to save a good amount of money don't buy the diy electric skateboard kit 

Buy this instead 
Flywheels - $25
Redz Bearings - $15
@Shogu12 Motor Mounts 2x - $60
@johnny_261 Pulley - $72
Caliber Trucks - $40

You save $88 dollars get to pick what color Trucks you want and they are not clones, Pick the size and color of your wheels, and it helps people out on the forum.

I completely agree I wanted to help people out because I regret getting the diy electric motor mount and pulley for $106 but is was way better because I got actual caliber Trucks and orangatan keel wheels and redz
