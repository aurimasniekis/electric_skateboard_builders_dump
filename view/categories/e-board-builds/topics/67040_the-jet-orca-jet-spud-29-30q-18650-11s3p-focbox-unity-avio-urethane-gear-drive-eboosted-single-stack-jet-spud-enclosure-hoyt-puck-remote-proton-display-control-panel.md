**Background**

While [The Anubis](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-anubis-laying-it-down-low-hummies-v4-hub-motor-drivetrain-30q-18650-10s4p-dual-focboxes-in-foc-eboosted-custom-vanguard-enclosure-arduino-firefly-remote/47391) is being assembled over at @psychotiller's, I've decided to take on a small commuter build to traverse the city and need to take public transportation. and [I couldn't pass up on the Battery + Enclosure deal from Jlabs in June](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-jet-spud-29-is-back-again-stuck-out-tongue-winking-eye/35134/244?u=jc06505n) so here I am :grinning:

Since the majority of the materials are going to be sent within a few days, I decided to make this thread to note my progress. 

The Aesthetics inspiration for this build is based on my favorite animal: **Killer Whales**

Accrued Total as of 09/03/2018: **$1571.44**

**Projected Stats**

[Using the average real KV for 6355 Kaly Motors](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/realistic-kvs-and-you/23346?u=jc06505n):

![35%20PM|690x381](upload://6KVGVlVl4MZBGBvradoTakAtmHd.png)

I bumped down efficiency to 85% as I believe 90 efficiency is a bit of a highball. With these stats, I should have more than enough range to commute in the city without the need to charge. The speed will allow me to match with NYC traffic if the need ever arrives, though I plan on limiting speed and acceleration via modes. Most Likely with 5-speed modes overall. Hopefully, I can do this via the Proton Control Panel. If not I can always do so via the METR app. 

**Projects**

As much of a lazy bastard as I am, even I have to throw some elbow grease on something. For this build, I'm going to look into the [Simple 3D-printed NRF remote](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543?u=jc06505n) and see if there's anything I can add-on or improve. I'll be working based off of @Zyb's remote so a bit of my contribution will involve using the added Multi button. I also want to create custom "Remote Faces" for the remote's OLED. 

**Design**

This section will be reserved for design progression and pictures. For right now I only have the color scheme down for the trucks and remote

![image|666x500](upload://mAPtIjUpbpYLGHboJMhEguP10J2.jpeg)

For the Deck aesthetics,  I’m currently in talks with [redemberboards](https://www.instagram.com/redemberboards) to work his sanding, painting magic. Hopefully, he says yes to request :sob: The top of the deck will be Blackout Black like the Anubis while the sides and bottom are pure white. This is so it can mimic the look of an orca (hence the name). 

Rather than use a [Battery Capacity Meter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DZJ3GG/ref=twister_B0711H9YMV?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1), I'm going to let the Proton Control Panel Handle displaying battery life. I'm going to mount it on the back end of the board since I would only look at it during traffic stops and change modes when I'm off the board. In order to get the UART cable to the Master VESC, I'll be drilling a hole in the middle of the trucks hole and route it using the Riptide Tunnel Riser. 

In regards to the Griptape, I’m looking for alternative material. Right now I’m looking at the viable use of [SeaDek Sheets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWGKZF3/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_wlyJBbTDTMJW6) and other Eva Foam Pads. I’m also looking into the new version of [DKL Griptape](https://dklskateboarding.com). 

**VESC**

Eventually (most likely in March) the Orca will be outfitted with the [Focbox Unity](https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/) but for now, I need to find a suitable intermediate VESC. For right now I’ve ordered a single Focbox and plan on using the Orca as a single drive until I order another one either the 15 of this month or October. 

**Planned Completion Date: March-April 2019**

Does anyone have experience with using Eva Foam in substitute for grip tape? I'm trying to find a non-abrasive alternative that won't fuck up my work clothes. 

As for Acknowledgments, I'd like to thank everyone for putting up with my constant questions, particularly @Jinra and @JLabs :sweat_smile: My motivation towards the Spud was triggered by @XTLA's [build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/xtla-first-built/54218) and enhanced even more so by @Eboosted's [The Biohazard](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-biohazard-jet-spud-29-10s3p-107-flywheels-dual-6355/58365). Hopefully my build contributes something to somebody other than myself. 

As the Parts roll in, I'll be updating the thread with pictures and questions. Please don't hold back any criticisms as I want the Orca to be the best that she can be. This will be a real learning experience.

I was confused at first because I never heard of the time of Native Americans as "The First Nation", those names are really cool though! The reason why I want to stick with the name "Orca" is that it can be referred back to the Roman God Orcus. I like naming things in reference to or after Mythological gods.

And hell yea they are, Apex Predators with the intelligence to tell food from not food. They Look bad-ass and can swim up to 30mph, hopefully, a max speed I can achieve on the build. The beautiful fuckers can be sadistic to their prey too. Apparently, they sometimes play with their food. 

Their ability of Echolocation is what really amazes me.

I hoping to enlist @treenutter’s services for that. He did the Anubis and it came out beautiful. The Orca would be more work because it’s coated compared to when I gave an uncoated deck for the Anubis. My vision is for the side and bottom to be all white, while the top is black.

Thanks, X! , I’m probably Ganna limit it down to 25mph, though I kinda wanna keep the 30mph since that’s how fast orcas can reach 🤔, 

I’ll probably give the next update around next week when I have a majority of everything in my hands. In the meantime, I need to see about getting Locktite and screws long enough for the Proton Contol Panel and Tunnel Riser. Can’t wait to start assembling the drive train !

It’s a slightly better fit compared to the prototype you posted but It won’t fit one of the sensor wires I don’t know if its a good idea to put the last wire on top of the others like that though as it feels to be a hair higher than the actual riser at its highest point

2 Sensor wires aren’t going to fit. Since they’re long I’ll probably just route them as normal. I need the space anyway for the Proton’s Cable. 

Also Prototype and Final Version comparison:

## \#22 Posted by: Jc06505n Posted at: 2018-09-06T03:12:45.127Z Reads: 334

```
It might, I’ll check tomorrow, though I recall it being higher than the riser when stacked like you said and the last thing I wanna do is injure the most annoying phase wire of the motors. I was gonna use the thin riser to ensure that there’s full contact with the deck & so the wires aren’t smacking up and down between polyurethane and wood. Should’ve le also contribute towards reducing vibrations. 

One of the challenging things about this build is seeing if having such tall risers and wheels will gravely affect stability.  I do want to eventually use an Endless Ride mode setting on this board.  

Speaking of such... @Wajdi, will the person control panels come with that Push Assist mode you’ve been working on?
```

---
## \#23 Posted by: Wraith Posted at: 2018-09-06T03:19:14.487Z Reads: 317

```
Same concern as well. Hope that we can get them to fit somehow. I was under the impression that they would all fit in there maybe might need to shave down some parts on the riser to get them to fit stacked? Id hate to do so though.
Wanted these to cleanly channel through and connect to the enclosure wire channel. So minimal exposure of the cables.

Still on the fence on pneumatics or gummies cause I dont want to get stuck if I get a flat on my first set unless i order a couple extra tires and tubes which is gonna up the cost even more :persevere:

I like the idea of keeping the wires snug between the deck and riser so I'll try and look for a thin one like yours but preferably have some play for the wires to slide to prevent them from getting yanked on for whatever reason

Edit: 
No idea how I’m gonna achieve this and likely easier said than done but will post my findings when I get the chance to test

[Gotchu bro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LVXUFNO/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_k7jKBbR54W799), it’s a 1/8th riser pad.

Shouldn’t be too hard if you’re working on a short deck. I haven’t measured it out but I suspect that with the risers and motor mounts, the majority of the play will be inside the enclosure since the wires are long enough. I only worry about the wires playing too much and unplugging something... when the second focbox comes in I’m gonna commission someone to soldier and hot glue the canbus cable

Sounds like a good idea. Thanks for the link! Ive got a Hummie deck so its much longer than your build but that play is mainly going to be caused by the tilting of the hangar so it should only have so much movement if what I imagine is right.

Yeah this is the orca spud so I expect it to be one of the most water resistant builds here.

I expect the package to arrive in my hands next week due to the way my university does their mail, but luckily it was delivered straight to where i needed it to. I wasn't able to dive deep into things since I had to see Crazy Rich Asians (great movie btw). Too tired to do a full update , will fix this up tomorrow when I’m awake. 

But here’s what I was able to do in short time: 

1) **“Velcroing”**

Safety is important to me (if not **the** most important) , and nothing is more dangerous than letting your electronics run loose in an enclosure.  I need my shit locked down and locked down good. But I also don’t want to resort to using solutions that can be messy with a reckless hand (and I’m not a fan of liquid-solid stuff like glue, weird I know). 

As such I opted to use Velcro (to be more exact [3M Dual Lock Reclosable Fastener](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OXK1AK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))

And it’s pretty freaking strong 

https://im3.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-3-9e61735ada.gif

I’ll take better pictures once I’m back at the office and have time to. 

For now I’ve outlined the two long sides of the enclosure with the Velcro and same with the battery. I plan on lining the whole length of the enclosure with Velcro so that all the electronics are secured down. 

Still debating if I should leave Velcro out of the Area designated for the VESC’s to put a heat sink. Though , will a heat sink even do anything if it’s just occupying the space the VESC’s would ? 

I also placed Velcro on the bottom of the 100A Antispark. , still have yet to have a concrete plan of where the electronics are going to be but I do have a rough idea:

![image|375x500](upload://k9tpuCd0NmFEuxoqiYWViFyplyJ.jpeg)

The Sticky Note is meant to be a placeholder for another Focbox. 

The trickiest thing would be the wiring though. Didn’t expect the battery to take up as much space as it does but I’ll figure it out. 

2) **Drivetrian** 

I didn’t expect it to be in my hands so fast so I haven’t even acquired Locktite yet. Will probably head to the hardware store tomorrow or order some on Amazon. I’m not sure if I should have anything off the trucks cause I’ve Been able to slide them inside with a bit of ease. The only thing giving me issues is a motor pulley not fully letting the shaft in. The other one slides in fine but this one is being an arrogant bastard. 

Once I’ve got it loosely assembled I’ll show everyone tomorrow. 

3) **Deck** 

I love it, it’s the right size , not too big, wide enough to feel comfortable , and I don’t feel awkward with my foot placement. I was concerned st first that I might step on the Proton Module like @Linny said but i don’t think that’s going to be a problem

![image|666x500](upload://j2tU1ak9R5hm66jTc89LIKSWkxw.jpeg)

Once I’m in the office tomorrow I’ll sit down and start tinkering around seeing how everything fits. Too tired to add or think more 

Thanks @jlabs 🙏🏾

Glad you got everything safely! Thank you for tour patience, and I all ready like how your documenting the build. 

Maybe you can do a two color scheme on the enclosure to go with the black/white theme. 

Also I wouldn’t recommend the proton module solely because you need all the deck space to ride. When your going fast you will want your feet wide over the trucks, or you will wobble until you street your face.

Thanks, man, I was thinking if I should go with making the enclosure white, but since the enclosure is susceptible to scratching and whatnot I think it’s better to leave it black. But I will think about it more as the build continues.

I don’t really cruise past 15 mph but I’ll keep that in mind. Maybe a case to cover the touchscreen would be best so that stepping on it won’t matter or I’ll move it up to the front of the deck

Before any permanent thread-locking or gluing, I like to pre-assemble my components to see if they all fit together. Today I undertook the task of *kinda* doing so.

Excuse the messy desk: 

![image|666x500](upload://odM4Oy7944m60hniTqlFwwtiSv5.jpeg)

As one can see, the enclosure extends a good length of the board and is limited to by the wheel wells. the Phase wire compartment extends under the motors and near the Rear trucks themselves. 

![image|666x500](upload://6RpIaf2A8lDp1MY8GC1KqKOzykn.jpeg)

It may not look like it in the pic, but with the tunnel riser, there is some degree of clearance for the motor mounts. I expect that to be present when I do a full screw-tape on Monday. I also noticed I put on the tunnel risers wrong and according to the instructions I've been routing them wrong? 

![image|375x500](upload://YsHLA7UtDSAOtisr9AX0l53GkY.jpeg)

I'll figure it out eventually. 

But I did get to pre-assembling this though: 
![image|375x500](upload://yzvaNB5yS2i56yV9vVUkEb7oc45.jpeg)

![image|666x500](upload://lJZpRG9HNgZHHRx3EWCmhsW5YLD.jpeg)

If the Motor Pulley and Wheel Pulley don't look aligned it's because they aren't. This is only a pre-final-assembled drivetrain.I'm also having a hard time getting one of the wheel pulley to fully sit down on the Popocoas. I might need to find an Arbor Press in New York. 

The Tunnel Riser docent seems so necessary since the motor chamber for the enclosure is so close, but I'm going to use them anyway to give the wires some organization. The Sensor wires, unfortunately, won't fit.  

Next Week I'll tape on the enclosures and do a real pre-assembly fitting to see how well everything plays together and how much clearance I'm granted with 90mms. 

One question though: Why do people shave their trucks? My motor mounts were able to slip in easily and I screwed in the back screws to hell to make them stay in place and so far, they aren't moving? Is there a step I'm missing? Something that will bite me In the ass later? Should I thread lock the screw that secures the mount to the trucks? Thanks, guys.

Those mounts were designed for caliber trucks. You might have to shave some of the truck for caliber clones or TB218mm. Its just a disclaimer really, all those trucks are made from cast aluminium so its not as accurate as precision trucks. Thats why some trucks are slightly thicker than others

Are you sure? I got all phase/sensor wires to fit in the prototype riser, and the production version has even more space to fit them in. The wire loom on the sensor wires may make it look like they won't fit, but the sensor wires themselves are only about as thick as a Wampa hair (I assume). If you get all sensor wires aligned vertically when installed, they should take up almost no extra room.

Do you have another photo of this from a different angle? Do you mean stack the sensor wires over the phase wires?

I’m happy you got it to work as I want everything routed through the risers to keep things neat but am concerned that they need to have some play to move back and forth incase the wires are pulled while carving or can that be easily fixed with leaving some allowance of wires before routing them?

Maybe due to the inner mount motors, the tunnel riser works bests when the cables are routed that ways. 

From reverse mounted motors, wire could feed in as directed.

My sensor wires doesn't really fit in next to the phase wires, but then again, I'm using thicker wires on the adapters I made. didn't matter much to me since I'm running sensorless.

The sensor wire are tiny though so laying them flat on the top would be fine too, it's just the sleeve that makes them look big

@Zyb It looks awesome bro! I have no idea how you’re fitting 30+ cells along with a charge/discharge BMS in there but I’m intrigued to see.  

**Update** 

Did the Pre-fitting/Preassembly today. What it is, is that I loosely assemble everything to see how all the parts play together. It’s helpful in identifying design flaws that aren’t visible on paper, such as a motor mount that’s at the wrong angle or wheel bite issues that you thought weren’t an issue. For me, I love to pre-fit since it allows me to refine my wire plan.

“Uhhh @jc06505n is that *tape*” 


Yes... yes it is. Didn’t want to waste any Velcro so I tape it 🤷🏾‍♂️. It still did its job and allowed me to semi-simulate a mounted enclosure. 

The first thing is the clearance. I have a hella lot of it. It seems I’m going to have to have to seek some of @Alphamail's bushing advice to regain some stability. Really don’t want to have to resort to bindings. 

As you can see I’ve put a tunnel riser up front in order to level the board out. The tunnel risers act as a way to ensure that there’s no wheel bite on the Popocas as well as a way to give the motors clearance from the deck and enclosure.

![animated|420x236](upload://2kJUL9QzgOUJL5nWLnqQDBJJHBs.gif)

No Tunnel RIsers: 

![image|375x500](upload://8gH5rwFSICEZQvGGWstsC8hGgOI.jpg)

With Tunnel Risers:

![image|666x500](upload://uQ2Eg908krFzl4Z3SFDOtwHE2xS.jpg)

Being on the topic of the tunnel risers: you won’t be able to use them the conventional way you would when you have a front-facing mounted motors

![image|375x500](upload://jEeT8e1qZ4GS4ARV6Oksn8dQFEr.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://7Zr8K2P3t0V7Nyv2JEvStZMfo7c.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://wYMpFjG0VgGhE6SPcc0qODMCjgJ.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://7SQpnOUpZBI96dBaHNf2lXalHXf.jpeg)

There is no space for the wires to come out of, if you try, the mouth part of the enclosure won’t be able to make love with the board. You *could* probably dermal or cut out the wire holes longer so that it wouldn’t be an issue *buuuuuuut* I’m a lazy stubborn son of a bitch and tried something else. 

First I flipped the Tunnel Riser over, and routed the wires in reverse: 

With the wires still long enough, I directed them back into the enclosures motor holes. This worked out because it shorted the amount of wire going in at the perfect length. 

![image|666x500](upload://5kp7vDZ7VcjEas4GyHNsbHjbbm2.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://9XgTIpxJQ9ul7wAXYpD2dU9hXmA.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://oaee5YHMZ9UIvf7x8pzwuZ7kr4D.jpeg)

My only concern is the tension being exerted on the wires due to being routed like that. Am I right to be concerned? Perhaps I should rescrew the motors on the motor mount to change the direction of the wire to allow more pull. 

All in all, I like how the tunnel risers worked out. They aren't a must need for a shortboard like this, but it's nice to have. 

I did some pushing to get the feel of the deck and @jlabs was right. I found my self often putting my feet in the back truck holes meaning the proton wouldn’t be a suitable place. As such, I’ll be putting it on the front (might even drill Holes closer to the front) and using the front tunnel riser to route it to the enclosure. The wire should hopefully be long enough to reach the master VESC. 

I know my drivetrain looks pretty ugly/incomplete at the moment. That's probably due to the absence of belt covers, but not to worry:

![image|375x500](upload://sV8zxOFdqWHJcUZRD9xDKmATwA2.jpeg)

![image|666x500](upload://cfyzxf8wAOQWj6y24Ryd5ZjlNRp.jpeg)

I have them :slight_smile: at the current moment they're too long for the Popocas so I ordered a Dremel on Amazon to shave them down, Once I do so my drive train just needs to go an alignment test, have a circlip added, and it'll be good to go! After that, I just need to get an orbital sander, some primer, and some paint. Once that's done its a matter of drilling and waiting to acquire the funds to get a second focbox and Phase 1 of the Jet Orca will be complete.

The tunnel risers do fit without sensors being routed and just the phase wires.

@Mikenopolis has photos of his riser with a good fit with just phase wires as he’s running sensorless

I’m encountering similar fitting concerns as well. I plan on placing the sensor wires on top of the phase wires to get them all to fit through it

If you can adjust your motor front to back get the 265mm and tighten up by sliding the motor away from the truck until you get proper tension. The 255 you already tested is too small and next size up is 265... doesnt look like you have much of a choice

Edit: measure largest and smallest center to center distance then input it in the calculator that'll tell you the range of belts you can use

Build’s looking great so far! Yeah give it another go. If the space on the area of the kingpin wasn’t there, I’d probably run into some issues but thankfully either way you try to run the wires through, it seems to be fine when stacking them over each other which is good

@Jc06505n I didn't see it mentioned in your thread: did you print your pulley covers yourself, and did you use PLA? I want to print some myself but I'm worried that PLA won't stand the heat.

Thanks! (build is looking awesome!)

I used [3DHubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) to print them. 2 of them for a total of $20.63 with shipping. 

I requested:

Generic Standard PETG
175 microns

I choose PETG because from what i read, it's stronger than PLA. 

Though I wish there was a version of these covers for 90mm wheels, I'm going to try to dremel them today to fit the Popocoas , but I would be much more comfortable just having covers that were printed to fit them...

I would remix them myself, but i don't know much about 3d Designing to know if just shortening the length is enough. Someone like @Scoo_B_SK8 would know though.

as far as altering would need to see better pic and explanation.  It almost looks like you could swap pulley covers and possibly get a better fit???

as far as material;
if all you have is PLA, crank the heat up on the nozzle (even past recommended on material info) i found that the object is much more rigid. (also slow your print down).  PLA is better than taking a rock and superman'n it, but i would still keep an eye on it (cheap proto type material too,to see if needs mod)

PETG would be best for this application 

ABS has some nice finishing qualities and generally more rigid, but will deteriorate in the sun without a protective coating.

if your handy with CAD try using this [STL-2-CAD](http://jsfiddle.net/roha/353r2k8w/embedded/result/#Result) site, has tough time with complex objects

Today wasn’t as productive since I had class and other matters to attend to. Tomorrow I’m going to go about dremeling my covers or modifying the STL file to accommodate 90/97/100/107 Wheel styles. I’m going to see about @Nordle’s advice 

 [quote="Nordle, post:18, topic:58694, full:true"]
if you use inventor there is a nice plugin called mesh-enabler, it converts stl files into 3d objects. should also exist for fusion i assume since it’s AD to.
[/quote]

Measuring the distance between the Mount and where the Wheel Almost meets the cover should be enough right ? 

A problem i encountered today was that the bolts I were using on the belt covers weren’t fitting on the motor mount. The [Belt covers STL](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2246770) description say to use M4x20mm Bolts but nothing I’ve used fits. I first thought that the bolts that accompanied Jlabs Modular Pulleys were exactly that (which i still think are) , but the hole wasn’t being cooperative , so I went out any bought exactly a Silver M4x20mm and even they don’t fit. @JLabs @JuniorPotato93 any idea what bolts are suppose to fit the hole for the Belt cover on the motor mount  ? Maybe I’ve Just acquired the wrong bolts ?

Edit: Think i identified the issues. I *do* have the wrong bolts. The Final version of the belt covers use M4x10mm not 20mm , welp another tip to the hardware store 😃. Any tools I should get ?

Today, I'm going to focus on research, particularly, researching enclosure security. I started off a few days ago with velcroing the battery. So far its been pretty solid, with no sign of weakening. I'm having it go against the force of gravity but the next test will be how well it will do against vibrations. 

Right now I'm looking into padding options. 

@Toughook 

How is your padding working out for you? Any irregular or heat issues?

Didn’t get much headway into research , got distracted. 

But I’m looking st Soundproofing Foam as an alternative to Neoprene. Neoprene is flammable so I’m looking for an adhesive foam with the same properties + flame resistance. Just in case this goes wrong I want to be able to try and contain it. 

Did a small test of whether or not the Build would fit in an Obed Bag, particularly the Giver , the biggest they offer I believe. The verdict? No:

The deck is too wide, I’ll probaly look into commissioning Charles to make a bag that can fit the Orca.

thanks for measuring this up @Jc06505n! I was actually contemplating ordering an Obed for my build but since the deck I'm using is bigger that means its no good for me as well.

You can search around older threads, I believe @psychotiller mentioned somewhere that he used off the shelf velcro and its never failed him. He's actually going to be providing me with the ones he uses to strap my components down, I doubt it would perform any different for me but I'll let you know much later on if you're interested in performance

It’s been a while since the last update (2 whole months actually) so here’s been what’s up:

1. I fractured my Arm (a Radial Head Fracture) in October, so it’s been an early ESK8 season retirement for me. By the time my arm is healed, it'll be snowing in NY meaning ESK8 season is over here, I’ll still probably be working on my board, but won’t be able to ride or do a proper test. But in that intermediate time, there will be some upgrades! 

2. During the 2 months long wait a few stuff has going on. For starters, I had my deck sent to @briman05 to paint and glass frit. For those who don’t know, Brian does some really badass deck designs and shows them off without compromising them using glass frit. I encourage everyone to [check out his work](https://www.instagram.com/boneyboards)

Also needed a nice remote since I haven’t been able to get ahold of a custom firefly yet so the guys at Hoyt Boards hooked me up

![image|375x500](upload://b1JODiLs1xgUMcF0SIpet096xSb.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://jWFuMSKA6o5NukijryOs1hYJwCo.jpeg) 

I tried fiddling around with my focboxes and ensuring that my METR Pro was working. I did an update via TCP Bridge and was successfully able to. Since I had everything but a remote I decided to do some motor detection when the weirdest thing happened: the bootloader on one of my focboxes got wiped. Had to send them to @JohnnyMeduse to get that fixed as well as another weird issue 

Think I’m gonna stick to doing motor detection via USB from now on. 

Since it’s so close to the Unity “Shipping” date (one I’m hoping is accurate) the focboxes will probably be backups in case the unity ever kicks the can. 

**Upgrades**

I’ve decided to upgrade the drivetrain from a belt drive to the [Aortal Gear Drive](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gauging-interest-the-aortal-gear-drive-63xx-50-caliber-ll-compatible-97mm-wheels-and-above-tested/67496?u=jc06505n) by @nuttyjeff, since I want to run dual 6355s, I’m going to run Extended Calibers in the back and Normal Calibers in the front. If given the option, I want to use Kegal Wheel Adapters and run @torqueboards 110mm wheels (but only if they come in black, if not I’ll have to settle for either dying Boa Wheels or using ABEC ) since the Popocoas won't give enough clerance. 

Might also take advantage of the [sale](https://mailchi.mp/dc005d43a506/black-friday-blowout) from Build Kit Boards

I’m still waiting on @Wajdi’ Proton Control Panel as that’s going to be my Battery Indicator, but I still am concerned that I’m going to step in it due to the limited room on the Spud... @moon do you think it’s possible to create a cover for it so that stepping on it won’t be an issue? I’ll of course pay for the needed materials and what not. 


That’s pretty much everything as my arm heals back I’ll start working on the build again!

Question though, The glass frit is very susceptible to being marked white from scratches, any way to clean it up?

Maybe the VEGA is worth looking into...

For anyone with a Spud, has anyone been able to use inserts so that no screws show up on top? I fear that the deck is too thin and I'll end up having to drill into it anyway

Would probably be better if I ask on a Battery thread or unity support but what’s the best cutoff for an 11s Battery? I don’t mind cutting off early like Boosted does to stray away from sag and I also don’t want the cells hitting very low due to balancing reasons (I would be suprised if they were already unbalanced since I haven’t charged them since September) 

I’m configuring the battery cutoff on the unity now

11 x 3v hard

These will be the values I will use on my new li-ion pack, they are very conservative and hopefully will keep the pack balanced better and last much longer.

Range can be increase by lowering the cutoffs to 2.8v or even 2.5v if your ballsy

Close to assembly the Orca , just need a few things to come in to fully nail it down land give it a test run. 

**Drivetrain**

![image|187x](upload://dpWHRn3LrVHlugNivJcSKULwPg2.jpeg) 

I’m currently in the midst of fully setting up the Aortal Drive. I fucked up and left two much space when putting the pinion on the motor shaft, so i ordered a cheap amazon heat gun to redo. Should come by today. For now I'll run some ABEC’s 97s on it but eventually , I’ll have it running Some 110mm Torque board Wheels ( RIP to my torque). It’s also ganna leave my board way higher and heavier than expected. 

**Heatsinking**

This part of the “building” process is the most frustrating since I begin to seconds the guess the components I’m using and direction I want to take. Right now I’m heavily debating on whether or not of using a heatsink for the unity Eboosted Style. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eboosted-enclosures-thread/38073/1125?u=jc06505n

While it may not seem necessary since I'm not running the Orca at maximum settings, I do think it's best to improve the system in any way I can. If I decide to go this route , @3DServisas, can I commission you to make a heatsink for the unity ?

**Securing Electronics**

Another decision hurdle are the electronics. I’m researching both the forum and [Endless Sphere](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&q=endless+sphere+wire+managment) for wire management tips and effective ways to secure things against vibration. I’m leaning heavily towards Velcro to secure everything but the Unity (which would be secured via the epoxied heat-sink if I go that route), but worry that I might not be enough. 

Right now I'm looking at these wire management solutions: 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XNBS6TG/ref=crt_ewc_img_dp_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A2W48U3XUS6VVO

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZ5F1Q4/ref=sspa_dk_detail_8?psc=1

Still looking for something elegant that will make maintenance easier and upgrading components a breeze. Hmm maybe Boom tubes along the sides with one side for the xt60 between the unity and battery, and on the other side everything else. Still debating. 

**Wire Management**

My highest concern is wire management , more specifically the motor wires. 

![image|666x500](upload://5StrgXubrxKYLEllPOBZx6S7QtW.jpeg) 

As they are now I could wire them straight to the unity wires with a bit of excess , but I worry about stressing them out since I’m limited in the orientation of how I turn the wires. I leaning towards using the switchblade riser I got from @okp, but it needs some modification to suit the Jet Spud and the enclosure. 

![image|375x500](upload://8lOntl6yRCZX7hwAEZpjU3tEoKd.jpeg) 

I’ll need to cut/mill off the mouth part of the riser back to regular riser size so that it doesn’t conflict with the enclosure. I’ll also need to drill out holes since the riser only accommodates one type of mounting holes. Hopefully there’s space for it.

Well I'm thinking that if you don't use the riser on the last pic you can still the enclosure to put the cables straight to the focbox and put some glue around them to seal the holes, won't look superb but will work (adding bad edited photo)
![Screenshot_20190117-123108_Chrome|656x500](upload://5KQ9XLah9caqavCuhCO0qmT59xv.jpeg) 

And if you go for the roster you could cut the enclosure to the shape, and that way it won't be rise that little, and I think this option won't look bad, because it will combine the 2 parts, and let the cables go under the enclosure with out rising it (adding second bad edited photo)

*This* I didn't think of. Might consider this if modifying the riser goes south. @okp, you wouldn't happen to have any more of these would you? I know they're no longer listed on your website.

Lol there’s no way my build can win , I can already see the year of innovation ahead of us. We got @linny, @nuttyjeff, and @3DServisas pulling out drive trains that wasn’t even commercially available years ago. More and more firefly derivatives with cool features are being made and , @Deodand doesn’t get enough praise for the unity cause it’s a beautiful as piece of hardware with some features only seen in Chinese boards. 2019 it’s going to be a fierce competition.

Yesterday was progress fucking city. This'll be part 1/2 since I didn't take many pictures throughout the process. Monday might have a fully assembled Orca if I can secure all the needed materials in time. 

So here we go:

After unsuccessfully trying to get the motor pinion off by heating it up 1000 Degree Farienheight 

![image|375x500](upload://zky0GZ8wy4T1TFTw0HueBbzOmwv.jpeg)

I went over to Kaly's shop the next day. Man when I tell you it's an ESK8 Builder's wonderland (the man has everything). That was actually my first time meeting Kaly and he's a pretty cool guy. Throughout the course of the day, I learned a lot, both about building and about his operation. I gained a new found respect toward vendors as a whole and the labor that goes into it. I was only on my feet for 6 hours and I knocked out instantly when I got home. For him to be doing this 6 days a week? Yea I'm not going to be looking at prices the same way I do in this community. There's a labor portion of the price that really goes underappreciated.

But anyway, let's go over what was done.

The first thing Kaly did was removed the motor pinion instantly with a blowtorch. He did within a few minutes that I tried for two hours. 

Leaving the motor pinion to cool down, he then moved on to advise me on where I should place the enclosure components. Originally I planned on securing the components _on_  the enclosure but that changed:

![image|375x500](upload://7W2mc4PpWuVKPSpCaJG13qfaioh.jpeg) 

One note is that if anyone goes down this route, be sure to due cutouts of the neoprene before applying to the deck, it's a bitch to get off and carve.

We also did some modifications of the Switchblade Riser, allowing it to not get in the way of the enclosure mouth (will get better quality pictures)

![image|375x500](upload://bkxVukeDmBx6GV4ceu5WUnUbFIR.jpeg)

similar to @Virol's suggestion, the "teeth" of the enclosure was cut to allow the wires to run free for all.  

After successfully modifying the riser, we then when back to assembling the Aortal Drive. Originally (before going to Kaly's), after filing for an hour, I gave up on using a key way for one of the pinion's and decided to let the Loctite be the sole retainer. Kaly fixed that quickly by filing down the key and making it fit. Now both pinions have Loctite 680 _and_ a key. 

![image|375x500](upload://nhQj37ZN2Zv0DQ4tQBqGcWbe7Us.jpeg) 

After Kaly teaching me about proper backlash in relation to gear drives, I then proceeded to do some motor detection in order to see if the sound was okay (gear drives are high pitched mf's) and see if everything was alright. I did run into some issues that I'll investigate after posting this update. 

https://youtu.be/5rcdqwtdyaA

After getting the motors going we went back to fully assembling the gear drive, the backlash was set, the gears were in, all that was needed was grease. For this gear drive, it's a bit tricky. Quoted from @deucesdown:

[quote="deucesdown, post:128, topic:76056"]
So far I see a few factors on choosing grease for this application.

* sticks and stays in place (“spur gear” grease)
* thickness
* compatibility with plastics (nylon for the big gear, and maybe delrin for the bearing runners) and rubbers (the v-ring, maybe the bearing seals). Molybdenum disulphide is not good, petroleum derivatives may swell rubber, graphite may migrate into plastics and weaken them over time, blah blah…
* I don’t know if “high temp” or “high pressure” apply to us

One thing I noticed is, greases have a viscosity rating, NLGI. All the greases I’ve mentioned are #2 except for the Molykote G67 which is #1 (thinner). The Molykote looks like a winner but it’s not really available. Worth noting, Fatboy is POM, AVIO is nylon.

So far internet consensus for plastic gears is, white lithium grease should be good. I ordered the Archoil AR8100 (the cheaper stuff, on Kaly’s list).

Seeing as I was at Kaly's already: 

![image|375x500](upload://2Ua4zQNoNGxN0fjELzG53LYRLIt.jpeg)

![image|375x500](upload://mjArejMjhTmLFj8cus7CeLWdMer.jpeg) 

for compatibility, I check some of the listed chemicals in it using [this chart](https://www.calpaclab.com/nylon-chemical-compatibility-chart/)

Didn't take a pic of the fully assembled gear drive, but I can now say Gear drive is now done and assembled. 

I did run into some issues with the bearings and the Nylon parts not paying nice but once I had the wheel's on and locked them down with the locknut, everything stayed in place. 97mm seems a bit sketchy clearance wise for the Aortal, so I would advise going 100mm+. I'll be running the 110mm Juggernaut Tourqueboard wheels 



After fully assembling the gear drive, I then moved on to securing the electronics, First I Flipped the battery over since I realized the wires met perfectly when I did so. One problem I have with the battery is that it doesn't play nice with the concave of the Jet Spud, causing it to not allow the enclosure to be flush with the deck. This is even more prevalent when I used velcro which made it sit up higher. I'm going to have to use 3/4 wide neoprene to fill the space the enclosure isn't able to get to. 

![image|254x500](upload://57cg0Mpif2ToqlzdMT1gVeTobby.jpeg) 

As you can see above I cut out parts of the Neoprene on the deck to stick the velcro on (did the same for the receiver). Might have to do the same for the Unity. Going back to Kaly's on Monday to resume.

Haven’t hooked it up yet, since I’m using the unity I’ll Need to change the pins so I can use it on the secret UART ports since the UART port on the proton isn’t really working out for me. I’m also waiting on someone to sell the case in good quality or sell a fully assembled Davega.
