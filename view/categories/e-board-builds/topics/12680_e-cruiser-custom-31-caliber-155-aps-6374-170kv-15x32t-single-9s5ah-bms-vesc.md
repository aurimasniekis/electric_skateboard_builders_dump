Hi e-riders !

Like I said [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/alienboard-v2-perso-36-aps-3-3kw-170kv-ads-10s5ah/12013/12) there is the story of my e-Cruiser :slight_smile:
[https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/dsc_0206l.jpg](https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/dsc_0206l.jpg)
For a change, I'm leaving on a much shorter board than my usual (30 "vs. 40"!) With oriented trucks cruising / carving instead Downhill / Freeride. And power for times and odds!
Deck based Oxelo custom handmade in 31 "sanded and varnished.
The board will be light, compact, notebook without difficulty.
With an embedded 9S pack 5Ah, which will send all its juice in a now classic VESC for a ride while smootheur!

The gear list:

* Trucks : Caliber II 155mm 50°
* Wheels:  Ahmyo - AKASHA
* ESC : VESC
* Motor : APS 6374 170kv 3.2kW
* Driver : 15x32T
* Motormount ADS V2
* Batterie : 9S 5Ah 20C
* Boitier : Reésine epoxy fiber glass and carbon
* Radio : Mini 2.4Ghz

Let's build it :

1. The enclosure

Hi, some news.
I order a bms ([this one](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/9S-21A-37-8V-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-battery-protection-circuit-board-for-9/32706930941.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.9FUnBM)) and Pimousse from the forum help me printing a prototype to old the motor wiring back from the trucks (hope you understand what I mean), fixed on the truck base :

looks great.  Your enclosure, is that fiberglass cloth and a piece of carbon fiber on top ?  Did you use fiberglass resin or epoxy resin ?  Lastly, how many layers of cloth / resin did you use ?

Thx, is fiferglass/carbone epoxy enclosure,
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/image6.jpeg
I used alf a glass (plastic cup) of Epoxy resin SR 1500 + slow hardener SD 2503. And 2 layer of fiberglass aroud 100/120 gr/m² (3 layers on outer band and corners). Then a piece of carbon fiber serger on top ;)

Hi there !

I received my [BMS 9s 20A ](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/9S-30A-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-battery-protection-board-for-9-Packs-18650-Li/32709598581.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.m2SEzQ) 
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/wp-1482934932068.jpg

They said > _The first signal can not connect to the negative pole battery. If not, it will be shortened. It must connect the 3.6 V to the common first positive and second negative cell of the fine cell._
https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1yHlNLpXXXXcCXpXXq6xXFXXXk/224459592/HTB1yHlNLpXXXXcCXpXXq6xXFXXXk.jpg?size=132945&height=800&width=672&hash=65c8dee6bb8a1a0bfcb82e050206248f

(it's their exemple ... so for 9s I made with 9 pins connected ... started from the 1th positive equilibrate wire of my 3x3s pack)

And made a wiring diagram According to their sketches
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/wiring-bms3.jpg

But when I take my voltage, I have 33v to the 9th pins ... 1 cell missing right ?

should I connected the firts minus equilibrate wire the B1 of the BMS ? (I will have to shift everything and have 10 pins contrary to their sketches?) But I will have 37v between B1 and B10 ...

Many thanks for your help !

Very nice build, like the clean look.
Especially those white wheels. 
Do they have the same center hub as Kegels?
```

Yes its fitting kegel core, but you have to switch the inside and outside of the will to be perfectly aligned.

black = DIYES ; Silver = ADS
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/image.jpeg
the Torqueboards is better seated against the wheel thanks to the "washer"
but used the 32T ADS cause I'm in 9s with 76mm whells and don't want to loose many speed.

Awesome. I'm building a small cruiser on a 26" deck. I really like yours! Would like to know how you go with range, going uphill and braking downhill. Still trying to figure out the best electronics and gearing setup for mine for a max speed of 25km/h with good hill climbing and braking.

Here the speed is a lot more :) +40kmh
The range can't tell you, just ride for 2km ... got to add 3mm pads and pass from double cone to barrel/cone bushing.
But on my [La Bonita build](https://monlongboardelectrique.com/2016/06/10/e-pintail-original-longboard-40/) in 9s 5ah too I have around 15km with uphill and downhill braking.

This is one if my favorite builds, people often go overkill with crazy powerful and heavy boards, and often forget how cool it is to have a compact, light but super fast vehicle 
Good job :grin:

Also, all is almost perfect, but need some time to rebuild all ... Because I want to finish it as it should be :blush:
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/dsc_0038.png
There is really too much room lost in the enclosure (and it's too big between the motor and front truck, as much make it even more beautiful, light and refined 
And I cant used the screw under the motor :sweat_smile: It is not generant but, it does not suit me (moreover I had made a hole for the passage of cable on the wrong side ...).

Hey e-riders !

I have this big red heap of cable, with 3D print "channel" : 
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/wp-1483310378156.jpg
 So made a new cable channel, By shortening the Alien motor cables (who was of hard wire) for a very more flexible 12AWG. So now this is possible :
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/wp-1483527748268.jpg

And I made a new mold for the enclosure, smaller than before (from front trucks to under the motor, and this screw wasn't usable !) >>>

how is that bms you bought? Could you send a pic of how you connected it, cause I cant really figure out if you are finished from these pics. I pretty much have the same setup ( only a 245kv sk3 and VESC) but I guess thats not much different. Also how do you charge them, Imaxb6? Thanks
