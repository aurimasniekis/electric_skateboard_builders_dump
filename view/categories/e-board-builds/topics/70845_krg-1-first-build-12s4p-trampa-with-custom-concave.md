Hi guys,

Some of you may have seen this board on FB or Reddit, but I needed to create a topic here.
This is my first build, the KRG-1.
I'm French so I'll use metric system.

- Trampa Street Carver deck
- Trampa Mini Truck
- Trampa underboard battery tray
- Trampa motor mounts with aluminium tubes
- Trampa HYPA wheels
- Trampa Uban Treads 6.5" tires
- 12S4P (Sony VTC-6) flexible battery with integrated BMS by Kevin Dark
- Street Wing motors 6374 190KV x2
- Focbox x2
- Strongbelt... belts 14x425mm
- 14x66 transmission
- Keyway on the shaft

- UNIK 12S 3A charger
- Rear light ([url]https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B074496PRB/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1[/url])
- Front light ([url]https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B01B1MHWP6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1[/url]) with a step down instead of the supplied battery to plug directly to my charging port
- Modified Maytech Remote

Custom parts:
- Battery undertray ends 3D printed in PLA (both sides)
- Motor mount protections 3Dprinted in PLA
- Trampa dampa 3D printed in TPU (softer than the yellow ones)
- 3D printed concave extension un TPU (awesome if you ride without bindings)
- Custom belt tensioners made with bearings and speed rings

All my 3D files are here:

Software :
- Ackmaniac firmware
- FOC mode
- PPM + UART
- Ackmaniac app on Android
- NFC chip inside the remote. It launches Strava, Ackmaniac app and Spotify when I put my phone on the remote (and send a notification with "Good ride"! ^^)

Super clean MTB! The name kinda rings Keanu Reeves' bikes too :sunglasses:

Did you program the NFC chip inside remote by yourself? Do you have a tuto for it?

It's actually pretty easy, there's an app for that! Like NFC Tools for example. No programming at all.

Concave allows better foot placement and carving with no bindings. And comfort.

Trampas are flat for two reasons: the manufacturing process and they are made to ride with bindings.

Just now realized that itâ€™s not only grip tape ðŸ˜…ðŸ™ˆ
Also didnâ€™t understood where is your concave...now I got it ðŸ˜‚
What you used to shape the concave?

Edit: ...ok thatâ€™s I also found...too much threads...
