Good evening guys.  Decided that it's officially past the research stage since my parts are (mostly) on order so here comes the build thread.  I'll be trying to document everything as thoroughly as possible so that anyone interested can follow along. Below is the parts list.  I'll fill in the sections that are unknown as I figure them out so whatever you see here should be what I'm using on my build.

Wanted to put this as a separate post than parts list.  I'm really liking the Enertion space cell pro4 but just don't think it'll work for me.  My deck is far from flat and is also made out of bamboo.  I think it's going to have a decent amount of flex and one long battery pack just doesn't seem to be the way to go.  

Also while I'm sure they're quality the pack price if just high for what it is.  I'd like to do a 10s4p with some Samsung 25R and break it up into 2 separate enclosures.  I'd also like a could BMS with that and proper indicator.  The battery being over a couple of enclosure would allow me to be able to deal with more board flex....  

More to come on this as I figure it out.

Unless you plan on making your own motor mount, I'd definitely recommend going with Caliber II's instead of Paris trucks. Pretty much all the available mounts are designed for the Calibers.

Yeah I'm aware that most mounts are for Calibers.  I did want to stick with the Paris 2 for performance reason but know that if I have to I can easily switch and find a mount.  

Thanks

So I ordered a spot welder to make my own battery pack.. I'm not sure if I'm getting a little crazy or if it's the right thing to do... Time will tell.  I do know that if it works it will give me the best flexibility possible for my design.

Tip:
It's best to mount the BMS separate from the battery pack, not on top of the battery cells where it can short out.

So finally got the motor mounts.  A couple of things to note, since the mounts don't have a left and right they don't have the same range when lining them up, there is a dead spot where one can go and the other cannot..  This means that while I can move my right motor higher up I cannot for my left and causes a tight clearance issue...

Switched to Caliber II trucks.  While I wanted to stick to the Paris V2 I figured, this being my first build, to try to stick to simple.   This switch allowed me to get DIY Electric Skateboard's motor mounts.

Here is a picture with both motor showing my lack of clearance issue....

http://i.imgur.com/bj3InRJ.jpg

I could switch to bigger wheels to give me a little more clearance but these are already 80mm...

Remove the clamp and flip it, should give you the same range of adjustment.

Flip what? The plate?  You can't put it on from both side due to the cut outs for the screw heads.

No, I am talking about the clamping portion. Flip it around so the open end of the clamp is facing the other direction on the truck hanger. It should give you the adjustment you need. Might also need some truck risers to give the motors a little more clearance.

Oh I get what you're saying.  I'll give that a shot, thanks.  Also for the clearance I'm hoping to get some big off road tires on there... I was thinking some > 100mm.  Just not finding what I want yet.

Or you can rise your motor by cutting the deck a bit, like @Randyc1

So far I fond these on AliExpress....  Though they won't fit, it looks like my max size is 180mm.

So I just posted a separate thread....

Turns out the XT-90 on one of the VESC is backwards...  @chaka dropped a comment there stating that these were tested pre-solder which makes me feel better.

Those giant pneumatic wheels are going to lead to massive wheelbite with your deck/truck configuration....

Stick with the kegels

Correction to my initial post.  I miss-measured.  It looks like the biggest I'd fit is 160mm or 6" and change.  Still though this is the style tire I am looking for.

Supposed to be "wheelbite" not wheelbase.. autocorrect

Yes, wheelbite is a bad thing.  When your rotating grippy wheel hits the deck, you end up on your face. Your trucks are not nearly wide enough to clear the deck with chopping it or adding an insane amount of risers
```

## \#22 Posted by: jmasta Posted at: 2016-12-09T23:11:31.581Z Reads: 111

Also, you should topmount the deck.  It's going to be way too low as a drop-thru. That's the main reason why you have no clearance for your motors

The board shape allows for some huge tires to go in there before i have to worry about hitting the deck, even on turns.  I'm relocating the truck mounts (see above) anyways but I'd still like some bigger AT tires.  I'll be riding mostly in NYC and the road conditions are terrible.

So I'm printing some gears for the drive wheels.  So far I'm trying out printing JuniourPotato93's "Longboard Orangatang Kegel 36 Tooth Pulley for 9mm, 12MM and 15mm Belt" in 12mm from Thingiverse.

It might work topmounted with risers, but I seriously doubt it.  Not if you want any reasonable turn anyway.  I think you will need to chop the deck somewhat

My Rayne Demonseed has significantly larger cutouts than the Maestro and is less than 1/8" from biting on 90mm wheels during hard turns

I top mounted (for now with no risers) and the 80mm clear no issues on full turn.  I'm going to mount the rear the same and check there too and see what my clearance is for my motors then...

So I started this project a year ago and didn't get to do anything past what you see here.  Finally I was able to get some momentum again.  I finally got to taking care of my 40 25R and building my 10S4P.  Here are some shots of the work in progress....

It took the better part of the afternoon but I'm pretty happy with it. Pretty costly here because I bought original Samsung cells and I also purchased a spot welder. Hopefully it will be worth it down the line.

can you tell us how wide and thick those nickel strips are?  the thicker and wider the strip, the more amprege it can support. btw those welds look great!  just nickel looks a bit small for esk8 purposes

That looks like 6-8mm nickel strip, is guess nickel plated from the look which would generate a lot of heat and last up to 6-10amps, your battery is capable of 80a you will more than likely burn through that very fast

If I remember they're 7mm x .1mm which I doubled up (not in picture). This isn't so much going to be a performance board but more an endurance one so amperage draw should be lower than most
