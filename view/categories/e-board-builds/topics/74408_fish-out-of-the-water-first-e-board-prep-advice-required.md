Hi all,

_Apologies for the lack of picture or if this is in the wrong thread given I actually haven't built anything, I cvan move this post if needed._

I started going down a rabbit hole about a couple of weeks ago after I stepped on an Evolved Bamboo One, I then started reading up on the issues they have battery wise, truck snapping and worst of all, remote connection reliabilty issues. Living in the UK I started looking at Slick revolution and came to the conclusion that while more reliable I wanted something with more range that I could upgrade. Then I found this forum, learned about batteries, ESC, VESC and much more. Now I don't really have the time to do go and order each part separately and want to get the board built and riding soonish (I'm going to become a father in Feb).

To explain the name of the board, I surf and enjoy, loose fast surfboards (twin or quad fins) and all of my longboards have been similar, I'd like to recreate that feeling in a motorised version. I'm hoping that a top mounted on RKP trucks should do the trick, even if the board has no flex (85kg/190lbs).

To that extent I found two kits I would be interested in: 



* The PRO2 from collections/electric-skateboard-conversion-kit/products/pro2-electric-skateboard-conversion-kit

* The eskating.eu assembled build from https://eskating.eu/product/electric-skateboard-7020-watts-conversion-kit-by-eskating-assembled/#

I feel those kits are a strong foundation to tinker with further down the line.
These would be built on the earthwing belly racer that I have coming in a couple of days.

Finally onto my questions:

1. The eskating kit comes a little more expensive (taking the import tax from the US into account on regards to the TorqueBoard kit) with almost comparable parts, the battery has a little better range (12s5p esakting / 12s4p TB) but the biggest factor is the fct that eskating.eu has FOCBOXes. Does it make that much diffrence? I haven't really found much in the way of the advantages of FOXBOX VESC over the Torque VESC?

1. I have read that TB has reliable parts and how helpful they are when choosing parts and building the eSk8, I have read that Alberto is easily reachable and arranging but I haven't read much about the parts eskating.eu uses and how reliable they are. Can anyone having bought from Alberto comment on that? 

At the end of the day it is a fair whack of money to spend on an eSk8 (and it will be worth it) but I'd like to make sure I buy things that are going to last longer than a year, looking at you Evolved.

Thanks in advance peeps!

Bear in mind that batteries will be a problem shipping internationally. I believe it even states that on the webpage.
If you're going to outlay that kind of dough there's a whole host of US vendors who could help. DIY have some great parts, the escs aren't always the most popular but I believe they have become better.
You could also reach out to @psychotiller to put together a kick arse kit?

Thanks, I have chatted with the DIY guys (Alex) about decks and I cancelled my original deck order since it had too much flex. 
In fairness to eskating.eu I haven’t gotten in touch with them but the overall impression is it’s a smaller outfit and they’ll never be able to compare customer service wise or even accomplish the same delivery timeframe even from within the EU.

@fottaz Alberto runs eskating.eu 

My experience has been positive but like with any small business there have been issues with others. 

Import fees to London are really worth considering from the US, as are return and redelivery fees. Time and money add up fast if there are problems. 

I'm not recommending one over the other, I've bought from both and both have panned out. This is just stuff for you to consider

Yeah agreed, same if something goes wrong, sending something back over to the US costs more than to Italy, good customer service or not.

Ultimately I'll hold out til black friday and see which deal is best.

But look around as well. These are just parts put together in the end. 

I feel like buying a kit was a big mistake personally for myself. I ended up replacing half of it right away and feel like I could have saved time, money (a significant amount) and energy just doing it myself.

There's a lot of experienced builders around you,  reach out to them

Fair enough, thanks for the advice. It does make sense. I don’t really want to waste my time and more importantly other people’s time. 

I guess by starting this topic I’m reaching out. 

The more I read the more I realise the parts list is fairly simple, my only issue for a first build is reaching for the soldering iron and building something unsafe/fire hazard.

I wouldn't suggest building a battery if you're uncomfortable. Sure we all could do with learning but if you're building one or two batteries it's not very cost effective. 

Go for a unity to simplify your electronics and buy a battery from a vendor or builder with bms.

You're literally then just plugging it together and aligning your drivetrain.

what you mean with waste your time?
you afraid to spend too much your time with researching?
that shouldn´t be the case.
To know which parts you need and how they work together is tha basic in the diy.
If that´s not your thing than better buy a pre build like a boosted.
I don´t want you to build your own battery, but to solder a parallel plug or an anti spark switch should be doable for everybody :sweat_smile:

To find parts which fit togehter is not so big problem, even if it looks like this in the beginning.

just write down your list and post it here.
there are a lot of people here in the forum ready to have a look and tell you if it will work together or not.

Yeah that's fair, to be honest that's pretty much all I've been doing for the past week. I'm more conscious about asking stupid questions and wasting others time better spent riding.

I am however getting a better picture as to what to get, some of the lingo and concepts are still is a little fuzzy but I'll get there.

In the end I'm also interested in building something viable without having to buy parts from a dozen different vendors, streetwing is interesting and they hadn't come up in google searches before. I was looking at Alien power system for batteries at some point but they seem to be all out.

People like I here in time they anyhow can ride so... just ask your questions if the search function didn’t give you the right answer.
Have a look on the Unik 
https://www.unikboards.com/fr/
They sell batteries also as far as I know.
@okp is the owner and here in the forum too.

Hi, I was in your position at the start of this year, and I concur that it's a lot of info to take in during the first few weeks of reading. Only in last few months have a lot of the terms become recognisable but it's like anything you get into, the more to read the more familiar it becomes. Once you have the terminology nailed, and you're not building a battery from scratch, then building an esk8 really is pretty straight forward and shouldn't be looked upon as a dark art or something.

I used Street Wing for my main (and first time) build, buying 90% of the parts I needed from them and just personalising it with my own ideas. Have a look at my 'topics created' and you'll see what you can achieve if you just buy from that vendor - plus the owner is helpful with great customer back up service.

Now I'm on my 3rd build and the year isn't even out, but I ride the first one every week.... !

The user Hyperion1 makes great batteries for a low price

Also a word of advice, if you're going to buy from  and you want real help.... Talk to no one but Dexter if he's available. Hes by far the most knowledgeable and helpful from their website

I personally have about a year and a half history using Torqueboards and have always had great customer service. My torque esc's run great and my board runs like a bat out of Hell. Dexter will definitely give you great customer service. Keep in mind that you can always change parts and upgrade things later if you decide you do want a focbox, or by that time a unity because they're about to stop producing the focbox. The great thing about DIY is you can grow with it as you're ready to change.

I'd didn't get one of these kits, mine was from a builder here.

Bottom line is that you'll be paying a bit extra for parts someone else picks for you, according to what they have in stock. This is a fast moving hobby (@b264) and development is always running.

It definitely wouldn't be a waste of your time to get stuck in here and read about each part to get a picture of what to get for yourself. You'll understand it better when repairs or replacements are needed.

Also don't worry about asking questions, most people here are open and willing to share knowledge when the question is thought out and direct. If it's a bit wide spectrum you might get shot down, there's a line between "what should I buy" and "which one of these will best suit me"

[/quote]

For some of us, this is as much a hobby as "minivan driving" is a hobby for a soccer mom.

These are motor vehicles that we use to go to work, grocery shop, and life activities.

Calling it a hobby is neither helping you nor anyone else who has an esk8, even if it is a hobby for you.

guys im going to do my first esk8 build are my parts okay? im planning it on using as my transportation to school since my house is far from the city.
the parts are:
racerstar 5065 200kv
2x turnigy 5000mAh 6s 40c
48t wheel and 16t for motor
and im going to use a 80mm wheel for longboard.
any recommendations? i kinda want it fast and can ride uphill

You might have issues fitting a pulley that large on a wheel that small. Not sure if perhaps you meant a 38t wheel pulley?

fast and uphill with one 5065 motor sounds a bit not fit together.
the motor mounts in the kit you want to buy don´t look like they
will sit strong on the hanger. if they become lose very often, you ll not have a fun with them. I would better go with a motor mount from somebody here and change to 63xx motor size.
which esc you want to use for your board?
@Wraith is from PH too, maybe he can give you some tips where best to get parts etc.

Don't get a motor mount that has a round hole (where the truck hanger goes through it) unless you plan on welding it on.

No matter how tight you secure it, it will immediately come loose, every single time.

Sorry for the late reply. Just wanna let you know if you plan on getting custom parts like mounts and pulleys as others may have already mentioned, don’t get them from Lazada.

I can recommend you a local store where you can get the standard skate parts like grip,deck trucks etc but I would recommend spending extra on the batteries, and vescs that you can find here. Most stuff on Lazada is overpriced anyway from what I’ve seen so far

Im also in a similar predicament when it comes to battery shipping but once I am able to finally order a custom built pack, I’ll let you know. Im putting a no-solder pack for my build using @Winfly packs and my cells from ru.nkon are already in the PH and just going through customs clearance AFAIK.

I went this route because I wasn’t comfortable building a pack for my first board with no background and equipment to do so. Also If anything happens to the pack I’d be able to take it apart without needing to sit on a pile of bad cells until I can find a way to have it checked by an expert like many of these fine gentlemen on the forum.

Since you want to get riding by feb ir early as possible then you can opt to go for the flipsky vescs. Unity if youre fine with it possibly getting delayed past feb

wow nice, thank god i found someone from the ph too😂 what kind of mounts would u recommend for me? or parts that can be bought here in ph. i was going for a dual motor setup but i have a little budget, i only get my budget from my sideline as a graphic designer(im still on grade 9 and 15 yo) and my father who is really supporting me in building this board😂 so is the 5065 200kv from lazada okay? im going with the flipsky esc since it's quite cheap and can be ordered thru lazada an can deliver faster. for my batteries im planning on buying a turnigy 5000mAh 6s 40c from Tailshare online shop on fb, they have a good rating too and very active, very trustworthy. do u know any longboard shops in manila? do u have any recommendations to make my first build good?

Yeah checkout free ride skate shop on fb. Theyre the biggest shop I’ve found so far and do plan to get most of my hardware there locally. You can check out the esk8 calculators here as a guide. What kind of top speed are you going for? I’d generally go for a 170kv dual motors of 6355 or larger due to the climate. I’d also check out @JLabs for pulley options as he has a modular set that keeps your options open later on! 

As for BMS feel free to find any decent charge only bms on lazada(never checked yet myself) 

If you fond yourself ordering a couple of parts from the US you can save on shipping costs by using shippingcart and bundle it all together in one shipment. I’ve done that with a few of my parts and its worked well and gets through customs without a fuss so far

Im not familiar with racestar motors but I’d recommend maytech. They ship direct to the ph and are easy to work with. I bought from them at pretty good prices and they have a better price as shipping is cheaper and faster

Also the quality is known to be good across the forum. You can go with their 50xx motors if you wanna keep things more compact if you want

its been a while.   Think the wording is now perfected.  No ambiguity at all.  
@alextheys
Kits are a great way to get in amongst it.  Good solid kits though like the @torqueboards ones.  Can't comment on the eu options but diy electric has been around for long enough to have ironed out all the issues inherent with esk8 and enough people use the gear so anything you do have trouble with can be resolved on here in minutes.  Good basic assembly skills are all you need to create a machine more capable than anything pre-built.  Good luck.
