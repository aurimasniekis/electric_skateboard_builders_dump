Hey guys! 
Was looking for a faster board with good acceleration and came across this kit 
http://www.diyeboard.com/10s2p-battery-esc-dual-motor-belt-drive-power-truck-kit-8352-p-611.html?zenid=m209t16637s2ncif1e59s2qt32.

I placed an order on the 23 October and received all the parts by the 9 November.
You get 2 packages , one package that is sent with DHL that contains the hardware and one package that is sent by UPS that contains the battery pack.
The package for DHL arrived 1 week earlier than the battery pack.

The first impression of the kit was that it looked very well made for the price.

The parts waiting for installation.
I choose to use a madrid weezer deck  (120$ complete) , it's about 94cm long and has medium flex.

First thing that i did was drilling the holes for the cases , i did pu the cases at the very end of the deck to get the most flex out of the board.

Then i used a dremel to cut a line for the cable.

After i installed the cable i mounted the grip tape, this because i want the bolts to be above the grip tape and not under (for easy removal).

Next thing was to install the trucks, cases and screws, this was a easy.
The only thing that took some time was getting all the motor wires to fit in the esc  case, i had a lot of cable left since i installed the case very close to the motors.

One more thing! 
I also installed a more accurate battery indicator that shows voltage and battery percentage.
Can be found on ebay, just search for "Battery indicator Lithium ion". Was around 8$.

The result , total weight of the board is **6.2kg**:+1:

**_Testride._**

Before i get into the test ride lets go thru the specs.

- Motors are 1400 x2  (270kv)
- Battery is the LG MF1 cells  10s2p (158wh)
- Board has 3 speed modes on the controller (the new version controller)-
Pro mode - 39km/H (Crazy acceleration up to top speed)
Medium mode- 37-38km/H (Smooth acceleration that increases after  you reach 20km/h)
Beginner mode - 20km/h  (Balanced acceleration)
- Wheels are 83mm and gearing is 12t-36t , 5mm pitch.

**"EDIT"  I updated the gearing to 13t-35t and can now reach 3km/h more than before.**
**Top speed is now 42km/h.**
**All kits are delivered with the new gearing (13-35) from now on.**

The first test i did was in pro-mode, was very surprised of the acceleration, its very fast.
The sound it makes while accelerating is awesome, the sound of power!
I was riding full throttle 90% of the time with a top speed of 38-39km/h, board was very stable, i had to tighten the trucks a bit but that's a easy fix.
After 7-8 km riding at full speed (constantly) the board started beeping while accelerating hard, i knew that the battery was finished. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/19d264610eb467f10c1850cbfb43eea53f4d204b.png" width="281" height="500">
Another good thing that i love is that you can change modes when riding, no need to stop or turn the board off.

**_Battery and voltage sag._**
At 100% down to 70% the board runs the best, acceleration is superfast and you can reach 39km/h fast!
Below 70% the acceleration drops some (hardly noticeable) but still managed to get to 37km/h.
When at 30 - 0 %  acceleration is still good (still faster than my backfire 2 in fast mode) and top speed drops to 34-35km/h.

Was surprised that i could reach over 30km/h even when the indicator showed 6% left.
The Esc cuts the power when at 30.4V and starts beeping at 31.2V.
Charging from Fully empty took 2hours and 30min.

Range (tested below 10 Celsius)
Pro mode: 7-9km
Medium mode : 9-11 km (theoretical, not tested yet) 
Beginner mode: 11-13km (theoretical, not tested yet) 

**Note:** I orderd a Sanyo 10s2p (8.5ah) from darkkevind that im going to be using on this kit to give me some more range.
Will do a update once range/performance is tested on the Sanyo pack.
 

**_Cons/negatives_**
- The stock battery indicator on the board and remote don't work (Luckily i installed aftermarket one).
Diyeboard.com said its normal that electronics like this fail because of vibration (Been riding smooth roads only and it didn't work the first ride i took).
DIYEboard didn't seem to do anything about it or solve the issue, the answer i got was that it "normal". 

-  Wheel bearing in the pulley. My bearing failed after a ride, lucky me that i found it just in time and not at 39km/h.
The kit uses a flanged/lipped bearing that holds the pulley in place so it cant be replaced with a standard one.

According to Diyeboard there was a bad batch of bearings that caused it to fail, they have now changed the bearing to a higher quality one to solve the issue.
I don't know if it a successful fix yet since i only been able to ride about 3 charge cycles since i installed a new pulley bearing (still using the old one but Jason will ship new higher quality bearing soon).
**Edit**: I received the new bearings from Jason and i had no issues with failures so far with the new pulley bearing.

**_Pros/positive_**
Customer service. (Best I've experienced) 
Here is where DIYeboard.com shines compared to many other Esk8 brands.
They reply very quickly to customers, even on weekends.
You can tell that they want to have satisfied customers and tries to do everything to make it a reality.
 Jason seems to be a hard working man and tries his best on making you happy with your purchase.
The English can sometimes be an issue but all miscommunication been sorted in the end.
I think that in 2018 Diyeboard.com will compete with the bigger brands since they are providing a lot of different products and are evolving fast.
They seem to listen to customers criticism and  are always looking to improve their products.


 **Overall performance**
The kit performance (Motors, braking, acceleration) is very good, and it's as fast as they advertised on the website. Total weight of the kit is also very low compared to other brands.
It rides super nice and is very responsive when in fast mode.

I will update the review frequently as i get more mileage on the board.
Updates will arrive in the following order

100km - Update review
500km - Update review
1000km - Update review

If you have any questions please let me know =)
And for the record im not in Diyeboard.com affiliates program.

This is an awesome test!  I've always wondered how that kit held up.  Glad to see that they actually have some good stuff going there.  This is great for a budget build.  I guess the only thing really lacking is the battery, I couldn't see only having a max of like 6 miles of range. 

Other than that, awesome post.

Very good review.
Interesting that even 20A max output is enough to make a fast dual drive system. What's your weight and what about hill climbing ability?

You can find the measurements on their website of both cases. 
Don't have access to check now but can look it up later if you wish  

I guess you could get bigger wheels, the core looks the same as the abec 11 original wheel. 
Don't know how the esc would cope with it though.

I see you're using risers. This seems like a good kit except the motors are mounted at an angle so high up it seems like you have to use risers or they'll hit the deck. 
Do you see any way of adjusting the motor mounts to fix this? Otherwise this seems like a deal breaker for this kit. 1 inch risers and 90mm wheels would have me feel like I'm standing atop a table.

Well I've actually removed the big risers and are now using 3mm ones. 
They was not needed on my deck, I found out about this after some testing. 
Never hit the board with the motors, it's a tighter fit with no risers installed but so far it's been no issue. 
If you look at the video of the flex test you can see that the risers is removed, to get a lower board. 
It all depends on what deck you choose, you'll have to try and see if risers are needed or not. 

Although i must say that i do run the rear kingpin bolt quite tight , I find the board to be more stable with a tight rear truck.

```
Diyeboard don't have 90mm wheels for the belt kit.
90mm wheels are only available in hubmotor configuration if im not wrong.

I would avoid riding in the rain with any esk8, its not safe (slippery) and you always risk to damage electronics. 
A good rule of thumb when it comes to riding in wet weather is " if water is splashing off the wheels when riding, it is too wet"

Diyeboard made updates to the gearing so all kits now use 13t-35t instead of 12t-36t.
This increases the top speed with around 4km/h.

Im wating for the new gearing and will update my experience when its been tested :)

I've ridden in very wet road several times with my drop through Meepo.  Since the casings are the same I was just wondering how water resistant gear drives are. Are the Sanyo pack you ordered similar to Meepo's? Cause I ordered one. lol

Well you could be ok riding on wet road, I just don't. 
I don't find it enjoyable riding In bad conditions.
But if its not that wet you should be ok, water is no problem for the motors, its when it gets into the esc and battery that you have issues.
I orderd a Sanyo from @darkkevind and it should be similar to meepos sanyo battery.

**Update!**

I received some new pulleys from Diyeboard today, they have changed the gearing on all kits to 13T-35T. (stock 12T-36T)
My topspeed increased from 38km/h to 42km/h, it may not sound much but i tell you its a big differences in fear level going 42 instead of 38km/h.

Pulleys was a bit hard to get off the motor, but when heated up with a torch they was very easy to remove and replace.

Don't worry, bearings take some time to break-in after that they will spin more freely.

Rear will obviously have some resistance due to the belts

After reading your review I had to look into the lipped bearings since those aren't used in most builds.  I was wondering about availability, at a minimum you can buy extras on their website for $2 a pair.

Those bearings can be bought from other vendors too, often called flanged bearing. :slight_smile:

Honestly i prefer 83mm , they are quick to turn and spin up quickly. 
With 83mm i can reach 42km/h, if you choose to go for 90mm you will reach 47km/h.
Running bigger wheels will sacrifice torque for those hills and quick accelerations.

Another factor to keep in mind is weight, bigger wheels weighs more.
My board weighs 6.2kg and its one of the lightest esk8 with this performance that i know of.

I went from 83 to 97 and I can tell you you lose a noticable amount of torque but worth it for the comfort.  My brakes actually calmed down a bit as they were supper sudden on my old board.  I have some rough stuff wheels here and they feel like they will vibrate quite a bit, I will let you know when I finish my build.

Well you can do what I did when I upgraded to 97’s... remove the belt guard l, fit the 97’s to the board and wrap some sandpaper/spare grip tape round the wheel then sand the belt guard down using the curve of the new wheel to get it to the right size amd shape.  Should only take 10 mins each side.

 Nice build, I bought the same dual belt kit from DIYeboard and is working fantastic. I currently have modified the rear truck so I could use 38T wheel pulley with orangatang kegel wheels. When I received the package, one of the diode from the DIYeboard's ESC (top PCB) was fallen off, I've re-soldered that diode back and re-soldered most of diodes and hardwares with thicker lead, and then battery indicator was working like a charm. Have you tried if there was any missing diode or component from your top PCB area?

I know this is an old thread but where are you finding other sources for this lipped bearing here in the states I don't want to pay $20 shipping off their site is ridiculous. Thanks

nice thread! wanna hear some updates! i think many ppl are looking at theese kits from diyeboards due to the price, i mean they compete with products (evolve boards) that are 3 times more expensive :slight_smile:

I found them on Ambec, online bearing store. The only place that I could see they were listed as high speed and sold to RC hobbies and what not where the others I couldn't tell what quality they were you know if they would work there's a million of them out there but I think these are the exact ones I hope. Thanks for your pointer

I'm new at this and the expensive boards will have to do something exceptional to WOW me after being on this cheap board. If they are 5 pounds lighter, can go 5 miles more ECT. I just don't see spending another $1000 to upgrade.
I weight 246 and this board calls me Flaco every hill we climb!

I have this kit and my take on this:

1. Speed is good, approx 40kph
2. Torque is pretty low compared to my other boards, slows down into wind and uphill quite a lot
3. Belts get loose really fast and can't be adjusted, buy heaps of belts and you might have to change them regularly, possibly depending on riding style and weight (I'm 105kg). Mine are two weeks old and slipping heaps.
4. For the price these are quite good but I bought mine from MBoards which was an expensive mistake, should have bought from DIYeboard and saved $200, I also got no enclosure, late delivery and delivered with flat battery in controller so it seemed to work but wouldn't turn the wheels until controller charged and got no support from Mboards - Bjerk helped me out with this fix - thanks mate!

Great information! Can you please tell me if the 36T 12MM KEGEL DRIVE WHEEL PULLEY from Torque Boards will work with the dual belt drive from Diyeboard? I have orangatang kegels that I want to use but Jason from diyeboard said it's not possible.
