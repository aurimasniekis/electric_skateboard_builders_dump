hey guys, i have been looking into building a board (mainly for commuting to work so i can stop driving my truck) and i have been inspired by a lot of the builds on this page. I actually went to place an order for a board last night but after going to sleep and thinking about what i did, i decided to go ahead and try to build one instead that might fit my needs better.

Im definitely going to need help atleast with the electronic side of things as far as the vesc/esc wiring.

i come from an RC car background so I'm not completely new to the whole thing but now instead of moving a 10lb RC car i need to move 215lbs haha. also for the record i have ridden electric skateboards before, i have a friend that did a cheap build that came out halfway decent but is not what I'm looking for.

so here is my build idea and if anyone can help lead me to buying parts and help a newcomer id be greatly appreciated.

I would like to build a trampa/mountain board style commuter, it will most likely be 90% street cruising, i would like to try and get a 15 mile range with around 25mph (will not be going that fast all the time but would like the capability to do so) hill grade i will most likely be commuting up/down is probably around 20%, from what I've been reading, it seems like a belt drive would be better suited for my needs (i think) and probably a 12mm belt dual motor setup 6364 possibly? also my budget or ballpark range is around $1000.

i would love to build something and i enjoy things like this, i pretty much just need help with the parts list.

Take a look at my 'Glory' build.  It is probably more suited to what you are looking for.  Its significantly more than what your budget is, but a of that can be trimmed and some substitutes can be made as well.

If you're not too set on it, I would suggest going with a street board rather than a mountain board, simply because of your cost bracket. 

It will be near impossible to hit that, even considering the price of the trampa board alone. My build is a street build, with 83mm clone wheels.  I am using some Zippy packs from Hobbyking, and I get around 12 miles of range, depending on what speed and hills and etc.  

I can go up any hill I want (I haven't been conquered yet) and I've got a dual 6364 set of TB motors.  So I believe you would be perfectly fine with that.  I am only 150 lbs, but a few of my other friends who weigh a bit more, have no issues with the power either.

The extra cost for the 6374 motors is gonna hit your budget a little bit too, so I would probably just go with the 6364's. 

I'm in the process of working on a build for one of my friends right now that is close to your price range.  Take a look if you're interested.  Full part list: [Jalepeno Build](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AllNT9cKR0dgga8mkM_6lWQXTbZIuw)

Left off that list at the moment: 12S charger, motor pullies, belts.

Since I posted this and have been researching even more and talking with people, I have actually increased my budget closer to $1500.

With everything I have priced out right now I’m just under 1000. This would be for a street build since I grouped it all together with 50 degree trucks not knowing the difference between regular and mountain board truck degrees.

All I’m missing from my list is belts/pulleys, wheels/bearings, deck, electronic enclosure, controller, and battery charger.

If I continue with a mountain board build I would obviously need different trucks and motor mounts which will obviously change the current parts list price

i think i second that.
my mountain board cost me 1600€ (~2000USD) and i allready bought every part on cybermonday which basicly saved me like me 400€

jsut make sure you buy some extra wide trucks so you could fit air tyres later and still do at least some off roading

Oh yeah on the build I posted there we were gonna go for the extra wide in case of an upgrade to 6374, or pneumatics, and no wheel bite, and plenty of motor space.... They're pretty much just better lol

And yeah I probably spent 1400 on my street board overall.  And I didn't screw anything up either haha

Yeah that sounds more realistic to get a better board overall, even if you just put the extra into a bigger battery.  12 miles is good but I always want more.  

As a second input, yes different trucks and stuff for a mountain board, and almost all the mounts for mountain board trucks are hella pricey.  Real pretty but pricey.

Yea 12 miles is basically my minimum distance, more is better, and I can most likely save money if I make my own battery pack I’m sure, I have a 10s 5c 425wh battery priced out at $300. And yes mountain board motor mounts are pricey as I’ve come to find out hahha

Did you mean to say 10s5p?  I think that is a pretty good size, building your own battery can be fun and a good experience.  If you did mean 5C you will probably need a bit more discharge rating than that

Ok, so far I have ordered two 6369 200kv motors, two 50A maytech esc’s, controller, and motor mounts. I have a trampa board picked out, was going to get their infinity trucks but unsure if they come in pairs or not. Then I just need to find some halfway decent wheels, a battery and battery box and a pulley kit which I’m having trouble finding.

Oh man oh man, got some more goodies in! 
My maytech 6369 200kv motors arrived along with my controller.

Motors are beautiful and the remote feels nice, doesn’t feel like a cheap piece of plastic. Thumb control has nice resistance to it.

Just waiting on my Vesc’s to come from maytech which were part of the order as well. 

Thanks to @psychotiller for today’s haul.

My trampa board came today!! Super stoked to get this!

Grabbed an hs11 electric deck, 66t wheel pulleys, and 14t motor pulleys from @trampa 

Also got my red bushing inserts, infinity trucks, and hypa wheels with primo tires from @scramboards.

All of it came in the same box, is @trampa and scramboards connected somehow?

Oh well, but either way I cant wait to start building this thing. Just need to order belts and a battery box and need to wait for my vesc’s, and battery pack to arrive and I should be all set to ride once its all together!:grin:

The Hypa Hub is our proprietary Hub and Primo tires are also Trampa.
Why do you think that Scramboards is involved? They purchased our gear in the past to make their boards.
We do not supply them any longer.

@trampa not saying you guys are one in the same, but maybe just communicate with each other. 

Because I ordered the deck, motor pulleys, and wheel pulleys from the trampa website.

Then I ordered wheels and trucks and spring dampers from the scramboards website. Now I have a complete board that came directly from trampa all in the same box

Because Scramboards has no stock (that sits on our shelves) and pushed your purchase through our website and entered your address as the shipping address. We have seen your order and the one from Scramboards and dropped it all in one box for you. You could have ordered everything from us in one hit BTW.

So got my board all together as a rolling chassis, started putting the motor mounts together from @Rithblu and lining things up. It seems that I might need longer spacers for the wheel pulleys, since the motor pulley touches the tire when I try to line everything up.

Any one have any input on this?

It looks like there should be some kind of spacer between pulley and the wheel so it isn't inside the tire circumference. And then of course the mount hast to be further away from the wheel.

I’m using the 17mm standoff’s that trampa sell for this hub specifically, but obviously it looks like I need to go with longer ones.

Weird that they aren't long enough, but the tire is still hangig over the pulley a bit. Maybe you assembled something on the hups the wrong way around? Like the spokes? I don't know if the Hypa spokes are sensitive to the mounting direction. 
Or did you somehow over-inflate the tire? (though i don't really think that)
```

Trampas spacer 17mm spacer assume you are using their mounts (the motor pulley is further back so not touching the wheel). So yeah I’d say 20mm m4 spacer nuts (7mm OD/spanner to turn) 👍🏻

The wheels were already pre assemble when I got them so that I’m not sure about. And the tires were also inflated as well, if anything they are under inflated.

That would make sense, I think I’m going to try and go with a 25mm spacer and see how that is, I’ll be able to flip the wheel pulley around as well if it’s slightly too long since the pulley is not symmetrical as far as center measurement to the outside. (As shown in this picture)![image|281x499](upload://7bWGvpbu2947pUnOb2RytFRTrmQ.jpg)

Please measure the spacers and check the pulley orientation. 

If you have 17mm spacers, you should be able to align it correctly.

Orientation of the wheel pulley is correct, I have not verified of the wheel pulleys are in fact 17mm or not.

If everything is correct I might try the 25mm spacers and flip the wheel pulley orientation to keep it as close to the wheel as possible

The Pulley is wider than needed, so you could also move the mount a bit further apart.

I bought pulleys for an urban carver when I should have bought pulleys for a mountain board. I didn't even realize there were different pulleys!

All good, the pulley is the same for all because both have Hypa or Superstar hubs :grin:
I have Trampa pulleys and mounts and had to add a washer between spacer nuts and pulleys (2 would even be better) and the belt is still very close to the tyre, maybe 2mm but it works. You could try that, quick fix!

The pulley is the correct one! Might be that you go the 15 instead of the 17mm spacer.
Sure the pulley is not reverse mounted? That steels 4mm 
I added the offset to allow adjustment of the centre.

## \#37 Posted by: Rithblu Posted at: 2018-02-15T03:35:37.875Z Reads: 190

Your going to need at least 5mm spacing between the hub and pulley, then you you can adjust the mount accordingly.

Hmm then I need to double check the spacers. The pulley is NOT reverse mounted. It’s in the position that makes it further from the wheel hub. But when I get home I’m going to check everything and take measurements

Ok so just going over some measurements. I have about 15mm of room for the motor mount to move around.

@trampa I do also have the correct 17mm spacers (might be hard to read my old but trusty caliper) so obviously those are correct. And like I stated earlier I am using the correct orientation of the wheel pulley.

Also I finally received my vesc’s today from maytech! Thanks again @psychotiller

Got my 10s5p battery pack the other day from @diyeboard and got my canbus connector from Adafruit last night. (Going to have to cut off two wires)

Went with this battery pack from @diyeboard because of the overall size. I’m trying to keep all the electronics in on enclosure at the back of my board and I think this will help a lot with trying to keep size down.

Also ordered a couple belt sizes today which might not get here till the end of mar but we’ll see, I ordered two 390x15 belts and two 400x15 belts to see what might work best. I measured 385mm but I figured I’d go longer so I can run the motor in and add an ilder pulley should I want to go that route.

It’s been a little while since I’ve posted but I’ve been waiting on belts that were taking a long time to get here so I had to order new ones and got them all around the same time anyway lol, and also I had a battery issue (battery was only at 25v and wouldn’t charge) so I have a new battery on the way. But the little bit of charge the battery would accept, I was able to wire up the electronics and actually rest the board out for about 10feet before the battery dies haha. Atleast I know everything works. Just need to set up all of the vesc settings and get everything going when the new battery comes in. In the meantime I was able to properly line up the belts where I want them to sit and I’m really happy with it so far.

My brother was able to make me an enclosure for my board at work so I just need to get that from him and then I can start mounting it and getting all the internals inside of it.

But here’s a couple more recent pics of everything.

the connector is an xt-60.

just as a heads up, that battery from diyeboard is quite low quality, so adjust your expectations accordingly.  They're hit or miss as you already found out, and arent made with the most high quality cells, esp for a such sweet build like this!

makes me wish i went with a e-mtb build!

you'll have to rewire both the battery and your vescs if they have xt-60, and change them out to xt-90.

honestly its pointless with the battery you have, at best that pack will provide 50amps... and an xt-60 is good for (xt-)60amps

split in two, is only about 25a per vesc.

@davewood1982 just make sure you get the right parallel connector, depending on your setup, either a male to dual female or female to dual male connectors.

And @Aleks  yes I know, I mainly went with this battery to just get going for now since it’s my cheapest option, I want to only use a single enclosure on top of the board and this battery was the most compact size I’ve found. Asking custom battery makers they quote me over 300$ and that’s just not in the budget right this minute although the quality is there. Hopefully the battery I’m getting is better than the first one because they supposedly upgraded to Samsung 22p cells from whatever cells they were using prior (hopefully the battery is actually upgraded and it’s not a lie). I’m hoping to get around 12miles for the time being until I’m able to save on on gas money for my work commute which is why I am building this board in the first place. Then I will eventually upgrade to a much better battery pack

hopefully you get 12 miles, but from what ive come across, 12-15 before sag on street wheels, AT is a whole other beast.

Thats one thing china seems to lag behind, is high quality cells.  I ended up buying an arduino spot welder and am on  my 3rd build of a 10s3p samung 30q pack with it.  It really isnt as hard as i thought it would be, and a 10s5p eith high quality cells would absolutely rip!

Lovin the build so far, makes me jealous.

Ok guys so I just got my new battery, and according to the spec sticker on the front it is an upgraded battery from the last one. 

So now I just need help setting up my vesc’s and I’ll be ready to ride! So if anyone can walk me through it or find me a really good descriptive thread on how to properly set everything up I’d greatly appreciate it!

Making more progress with the build.

Drilled mounting holes into the enclosure for the truck bolts and started to fit the battery in place

Download the newer Vesc-Tool. It´s much more advanced and easy to setup. Just follow these steps:

Got all the basics set up! Thanks for that link.


And today was the official test drive for this thing! Only went about a half mile total but it was fun testing it out! Got up to 20mph and I’m sure it can do 25 but I could really use some extra stabilization at that point going 20mph and hitting some rough spots is quite sketchy haha. But man I love this thing, I just need to get some bindings and finish up the enclosure and it’ll be 100% done!

How does it ride with all the weight at the back end? Do have a photo of inside the box? Nearly finished my mtb build was gonna put the battery in the middle with ESC separate at the back, but i do like the idea of everything togther in 1 enclosure..

Nice to see another trampa build finished. Be careful with the presumably sharp edges of the lid of the battery box :D

Stability at high speed seems to be quite a talking point at the moment in a lot of Trampa builds.
Consensus seems to be that Dampas are required, but can be modified to make them less harsh on the steering but still give you stability at high speeds.

Hey buddy, I'm  likening the build took really good, If you pay shipping I can cut some rods for free. I Just need the length.

If you use dampas and bindings, stability is no issue at all. How fast do you want to go on such a board? On trail and loose ground 25mph feels quite fast. 30mph and faster is to much IMHO. The pleasure is not in reaching ridiculous top speeds....

It feels pretty good, no noticeable stability issues as far as having the weight in the back. I don’t currently have a picture of inside the enclosure since it’s all still temporary for the time being and looks a bit messy but I can grab one for ya.

@Der6FingerJo yes I m careful about the edges, they are surprisingly not that sharp but I still need to finish up so it’s just like this for testing.

@JonathanLau1983 @trampa   
Yes definitely need to put back some dampas and get some bindings, I originally took the dampas out because I thought I wouldn’t be able to steer the board so now that it rides, I’ll be able to test out the dampas in it. And 20mph is fast enough for this board and what I need it to do, I can only imagine doing 30-35mph. Must be insane!

@Rithblu yes I will definitely have to take you up on that offer, once everything is finished I’ll send you a message, and there is also something else I wanted to do that I’ll ask you about.

@Rithblu If you want I can try and get even nicer pictures for you and try to clean up the wiring, and I can take hi res photos and email them if you’d like!


And also last night my board decided to stop dead in it tracks and throw me off, luckily I was not going too fast and was able to keep my footing, but my esc’s no longer power up so I’m assuming I need to replace the mcu on both of them?

Little update since it’s been a while, turns out it wasn’t an esc problem, I believe what happened was because everything wasn’t 100% tight inside the enclosure the battery was bouncing around and the charging port made a little cut through the battery heat shrink and started to arc against one of the positive legs of the battery and since the outside of the charge port is the negative side it was creating a direct short and I’m assuming it drained the battery to below the cutoff voltage which is why the esc shut down suddenly. Since then I have rearranged everything, left the charging port out and added padding to limit battery movement and I have no issues so far, full battery charge and already 6 miles on a 10s5p battery pack with Samsung 22p cells. So far so good.

In the future I will be upgrading to 30q cells and a different enclosure and possibility of new esc’s.

Traveled a total of 9 Miles today with the major leg being around a 6 mile run! 

My feet definitely need a workout after standing on the board for that long haha, it was definitely fun though!
