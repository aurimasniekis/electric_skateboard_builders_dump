how will you be charging the batteries?
If you can shell out the extra $35, I am offering lion batteries with built in BMS and laptop style charger. It also features an LED power switch and LED battery % meter for your board.

A good 4 bank balance charger will cost over $200
So that you can charge all four batteries at same time because you really need to charge them separately. And it's advised to take them out of the board and charge them in fire safe bags. 
Because Lipos can explode into flames at any time without warning. 
Really your best best is to talk to @link5505 about making you a Li-ion battery. He is offering you an amazing bargain for the safest, longest lasting and most convenient type of battery system you can have.  And it's most likely what you will end up with later on once you have experienced the hassles associated with Lipos. 
I'm at that place now after investing $$$ in charger and Lipos. I'm switching to Li-ion.

One thing I forgot to mention is that sometimes Lipos arrive Doa. Just one bad cel is all it takes. (Happened to me)
So you need a tester to check them before using them.
