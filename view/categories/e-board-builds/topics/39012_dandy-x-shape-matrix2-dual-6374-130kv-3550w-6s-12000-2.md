Hi,

This is my first build after too many issues with an Evolve GT Carbon.

The idea is to have an "Urban Mountainboard" without modifying the deck = I wan't to be able to swap it.
I started to work on an electronic box and a battery box that, while hidden, doesn't need to be screwed on the deck.

Here is the full post of the build with high res pictures:

Yo that deck is super sick. Really like the graphics also. And you made it yourself?

Very nice. Hadn't seen that deck before. Looks very stealth the way you have the electronics

The production is very confidential... But the brand has a good reputation and the owner is just super kind and spend hours building your very own deck... Should have the new one by the end of the week :slight_smile:

For the electronics that was the point: stealth while swappable (= not screwed / glued to the deck)

European deck world is another thing @Titoxd10001, we don't know nothing at all. Sick deck and amazing build. I hate those mountainboards crammed with batteries, cables, fans, bindings, like pre-historic mechanical monsters from the underverse. Ugliest AF! I like this approach instead.

Hey... It has been a (too) long time since my last update but I finally have the "v1" of my "Dandy" setup.

For what I know it is the first build with "swappable deck" + up to "4 swappable independant batteries (up to 4 Lipo 6s1p 16000)"

It is glue free and hole free = Nothing more that the 2*4 holes for the trucks

Best of all boxes cost nothing and don't require any expansive tools or components.

![IMG_5458|666x500](upload://cGs9Oi9oDRo3w92ctzI4GGy4dMO.jpeg) 

You can put batteries either on top: up to 2 at the nose and up to 2 on the tail... Or just one as a bumper.

Here is the article on which you'll find more pictures : https://medium.com/@.claude/le-premier-mountainboard-electrique-avec-batterie-s-amovible-s-deck-%C3%A9changeable-esk8-4b95645a3b92

TY for your remarks and suggestions!!

A huge thank you to [Yann / Overion](https://www.overion.fr/) and [Skully / X-Shape](http://www.x-shape.fr/en/)

Next?
- Will write a new article in both french and english to give details about boxes,
- The carry-on-airplane-compatible version of the Dandy ;)
