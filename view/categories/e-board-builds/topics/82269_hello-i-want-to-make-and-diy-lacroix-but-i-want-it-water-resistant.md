Water resistant is not the solution.  You want waterproof.  Which means even if the enclosure is filled with water, it still works.

Mostly "MG Chemicals Silicone Modified Conformal Coating" in 55ml brush-on bottle (multiple coats) -- and for heatsinks: "MG Chemicals Acrylic Conformal Coating" in 55ml brush-on bottle (1 coat only)
