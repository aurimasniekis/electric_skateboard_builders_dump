1) can we get dimensions of the box and pieces that go inside it, is there anything else?

2) those motor leads are kinda long, you sure they'll be fine?

Also isn't that box 'waterproof' once you close it?

The box is 10" long 8"wide and 5" high I wanated to keep the focbox inside the case that is why the wires are so long.
