Ok guys, i received a first batch of parts from China a few days ago, including a pretty decent deck (Cheap Vanguard copy, yet bamboo and fiberglass...) two 90mm hub motors and a dual ESC to feed them...
Got this from @diyeboard. Everything looks quite well built and solid, pretty fast delivery (around 10 days from China to France), also got a solid support from them until now. I will make a quick review of this combo as soon as i 'll get it rolling, and keep u informed about any reliability concerns that may happen. Those hubs and ESC are basically the Meepo board parts, but according to DIYeboard, a bit upgraded... Meepo hubs are rated  250W/12A when these hubs are said to be 500W, and eating up to 50A... The ESC also has higher specs than the Meepo's, as it is supposed to handle 2*30A, instead of 2*12A...
Here are a few pics of the pack:

As u can see, the deck has some camber, but no concave at all. The flex seems to be decent.

Heavy and beefy 90mm hubs. I have to say that both hubs are not made from the same PU. One is glossy when the other is matte... Probably out of two different batches...It's not a big concern, but it shows how "high" the quality controls can be in China... :smile:  
I'm not going to send them back for this though...

So guys here is my question:
I plan to get this stuff:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/8/28b6a81bb32481dac0f2adaba1bbec5f6706cf9a.jpg" width="500" height="500">
But as u can see, the ESC already has a switch... (kind of JST plug ?...Removable)
Could I bypass this switch, or can I use it with this antispark?... Is it possible set it between the battery pack and the dual ESC, but to keep the inbuilt switch from the ESC?...
If any one knows....

I am using the same ESC but with brushless motors,  I have an XT90 anti spark (make this your self, it's easy and inexpensive) between the batteries and the ESC and my voltage meter wired between the anti spark and the ESC.  Everything works well, except for the added hassle of plugging and unplugging the anti spark.  I have been running this setup for a couple of months without any issues.

i read that it is possible to have anti-spark switch with this esc. Just leave power button on and use xt90S or anti-spark switch. 
If you're investing on good li-ion cells, get a good BMS to protect them. I don't believe this esc will take good care of them. But this is only my opinion, no real proof.

If you search eBay for a 60amp circuit breaker it will give you plenty of results. You can just add one of those between your pack and esc. It just stays connected all the time and if you pull more than 60amps it cuts out. It can also be switched back on by turning the leaver arm so there's no need to buy a new fuse

Thanks guys...  actually the BMS is going to be a correct BMS for balancing and charging the pack, but I'm gonna bypass it for discharge. 60A to 80A/10S BMS are too big, too heavy and too expensive... a 60 A circuit breaker wouldn't definitely be enough if the dual ESC is able to pull 60A itself... I would need at least 70A or 80A... It's not that i'm often going to pull 60A from the battery, but i guess that it could happen at starts or hill climbings... don't want to blow the fuse then...

I don't get it, what are you worried about? The pack can be discharged 90A if needed. 
If it would draw 60a for a couple of seconds your pack would have no issues providing this without causing damage since it will be rated for 90A. 
The esc will limit the current also

I think the max current you will draw when there are high demands would be 50-60A for a couple of seconds

I think it can be trusted, and it will definitely blow/break if it would pull over 50a for a long time. 
The ESC is cheap to replace if that happens.
You dont have to worry about your battery.
There is no freaking way that ESC would pull more than 90A before braking down.

For reference the Meepo board ESC is limited to 24A max and it can manage hills at descent speed just fine.

I had the same concerns as you, i orderd a Sanyo 10s2p from Kevin and its discharge is 30A. 
I will probably draw more than rated 30A when accelerating hard and going up hills but usually you are only over the limit for a coupe of seconds so it should be fine. 

The stock battery i have now is only 20A and it been working fine. 
I have the Diyeboard esc that can pull 50A continuous and 120A for a couple of seconds.
But i dont think these Chinese ESC is very current demanding, if they were i dont understand how the 20A battery can even work as well as it does.

Yupp most likely, or very likely.

What you do need to keep an eye on is regenbraking not to overcharge the battery and that the voltage dont gets to low.
I think since the BMS is bypassed you loose the safety features it has like overcharge protection and low cutoff voltage.
Not sure if im correct here...

According to the website it is 50A continous, but its not like you actually would pull 50A continuous ever , unless you only riding uphill.

It starts beeping when at 31.2v 

Yeah i dont think the ESC prevents overcharging.
Dont know honestly, never heard of it.

I dont think it will be any issue unless you start riding on a downhill with 100% battery.

Im a beginner on batteri tech, but if i understand correctly., when bms is bypassed the protection features such as Overcharge protection, over discharge protection and Low voltage cut is not working.

So if you brake at when at 100% battery 42V the ESC will stop the braking/cut the power? 
Most of the time its the bms overcharge protection that cuts the power and in result leaves you with no brakes when at 42v.


Maybe its diffent in this case.

The esc has over charge protection. When it reaches full charge it no longer regens so the brakes just become a lot weaker.

 I asked dickyho how much current it can handle and I think he said it's rated for 35a each channel maybe that's burst though

Interesting feedback @NYCeboardDude... Is your BMS bypassed for discharge?... I guess so as this esc should have an overcharge protection... But the lack of brake might happen because of this protection in facts... I actually don't know. According to @Bjork3n, this is what actually happens at full charge... But actually, when do you really use your brake at full charge?... This might happen, but if you have to use your brakes, it seems that you've been discharging right before...  But I agree that it's quite dangerous whenever it happens...

DIYeboard was the shop i got it from. They are based in Hong Kong I think, but deliver worldwide and quite fast (let's say 10 days).
It's actually not a real Vanguard clone... The deck has no concave at all, i even noticed that it has a slight convex... But it's pretty decent, and has a correct flex.... It's overall a nice deck for experimentations, without risking to ruin a 180$ loaded board. It's supposed to be bamboo and fiberglass built, so i presume it will be quite durable, and its weight is 1.350kg.
here's a link where u can check its flex yourself:

Could also be his bms cutting the load. You will only know for sure if you bypass. 
Regen is max 4.2amp so it's very low, should be fine unless you brake for a very long time near full charge. 
Just don't use the brake heavily in the beginning and you "should"'be fine :)

I'm 38 old right now... Should I start thinking about wearing a helmet?... :wink:
I might need a new "how to fall without braking your deck" skill actually... lol

When i started riding above 30km/h i started to wear a helmet. 
Now i always use it, and im glad that i do, been to many moments when i could hit the pavement.

Come on be serious... do you really think that i'm going to ride this board?... lol ok i might do this, but i'm not sure it's going to reach 30 km/h... oh it might... a few seconds... before it blows! :smile:
It's an everyday struggle to avoid the pavement for me... I get at work with my rollerskates... the point is that i'm always still sleeping doing this, so i don't notice the red lights... :slight_smile: A long time ago, my mom told me not to grab any bus while trying to get up a hill on rollerskates... But i'm affraid I never listened to her... lol
