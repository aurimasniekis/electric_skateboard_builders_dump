This is my first eSk8 build. The build is still in progress but I hope to finish soon.
I started off with a Landyachtz Tamahawk.

I added some  0.5" Khiro Angled Wedge Shock Pad 80A Risers:   https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/risers/2081/0-5-khiro-angled-wedge-shock-pad-80a-risers

Finally starting working on this project again... 
Cut the enclosure so the esc's can breathe:

Added T-nutz to the deck:

Starting to look like an ESK8:

I still need to get a decent battery but until then I am going to run the 6.6ah Multistar battery I have.

I finally took the eskater out for the my first run ever on an eskate!  Wow this is this fun!  I only cruised around a parking garage with no cars around to get the feel of the board.  I Had my lipo alarm set at 3.5v and after about 10 mins of riding it beeped.  After letting the board/battery cool down I was able to ride for another 10 mins.  This 6.6ah multistar battery is definitely the weak link.  I will be saving up for a real battery and most likely some VESC's.

Added some straps to secure the battery:
