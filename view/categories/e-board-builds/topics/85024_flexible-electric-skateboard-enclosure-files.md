Hello Everyone!

I designed a flexible enclosure for a friend and i thought it would be a good idea to share it with you guys.

Link to the enclosure: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3444705

It's designed for a 10s3p battery with a bms and 1x vesc ect. (but please not, there is only space for one vesc, if you wanna use two, you have to print one more piece.)

In every piece you can take 2x 3 18650 parallel packs.

Which you have to connect in series with wires.

You guys are also able to make a 10s4p or 5p battery, only have to print more middle piecesüòä

I tried to design the enclosure as small as possible but i also wanted to make it so big that there is enough place to fix those 18650 cells. 

7 pieces are ~50cm long, 14cm width and ~3cm high. 

If you're not able to print it, then you can contact meüòâ

These pictures are from the friend, whom i designed it for.
