So my build will be, 
    • loaded tesseract
    • dual TB 190kv motors
    • TB pulleys and mount
    • focbox unity (just got my tracking number!)
    • 12s5p battery from Hyper Ion (16" x 7 1/4")
    • caliber 50°s with 35° Randal baseplate on the rear
    • Orangatang Caguamas

Just got my motors and pulleys!![IMG_20181210_162402|666x500](upload://eL4vEv4PQHFO18S5uiL5BNIhaeJ.jpeg) 

And finished the sparkle gt2b mod by @okp. ![IMG_20181210_162235|375x500](upload://znIebid6pRMVCyIOaeWWCA3jwGE.jpeg)  

I'm not sure how others managed to not get serious wheelbite with the tesseract and large wheels, after trying an inch of riser and stiffer than I would like bushings I could still make it bite. This caused me to take the most dramatic of solutions. ![IMG_20181210_155056|375x500](upload://8gNJrkTvcvcS6JzqFUDfAxvvLPS.jpeg) 

Forgive me Skaten, for I have sinned. I used a large piece of paper to get the shape I wanted, then cut it out with a jigsaw. (Much how roarocket shows to cut blank decks.) ![IMG_20181209_192629|375x500](upload://5aPMqOgmhkUPftaLu4shGlBU2rd.jpeg) 
My running plan from here is to sand down the bottom of the board and laminate two  1/16" layers of maple (to minimize how much I'm routing into the board itself), then route out a flat area for the battery using a router sled similar to @kortho, although my battery will be significant wider. And top it off with laminateing one later of 12k unidirectional and one layer of 3k 2x2 twill carbon fiber to the bottom to regain structural integrity. And top it off with a carbon fiber enclosure, 3 layers of 2 x 2 twill with one unidirectional somewhere in the middle. 
I'm also debating on running my motor wires on the top of the deck like @longhairedboy and adding a layer of unidirectional carbon to the top as well. 
My question to those that have worked with carbon a bit more than me is, do you think two layers on the bottom would be enough? (My estimate is I'll be 3-4mm into the original board, not including the two layers of maple.) And if four layers enough for the enclosure?

Edit: fixed grammatical mistake, added another photo

Wow cool modified tesseract! Looking forward to the carbon fiber mods. What size wheels were giving you wheelbite?

:open_mouth:

This will be different! Shame you had to chop it but there was no way in hell you would get the Cags under that.  I have tried kegels on my truncated and you need stiff trucks for that!

85mm. I tend to like soft bushings though, and had a bad experience with wheelbite once so I'm overly cautious.

I absolutely love this.. looks like Son of Ceviche.  Good call on 35º rear baseplate.

Thanks, I was honestly expecting to catch some flak for cutting up such a nice board. And 35° baseplate definitely added to my wheelbite woes, but that's no longer a problem.

No, it’s unique now. 

I run 90mm wheels on 50 degree Calibers on my tesseract. I use 1/4 risers with no problems.

I'm willing to accept vape carts, pizza, beer, or donut holes as licensing payment. Or a large bag of cheetos.

Oh mang, nice always had a soft part for this deck, but will it be strong enough at the neck?

@banjaxxed I tried using the board as a trampoline to be sure, no problems. I do weigh a measly 160lbs though. With the extra two layers of veneer and the carbon fiber reinforcements I think it'll be okay.
@longhairedboy I only stock Cheetos in cheddar jalapeno, I hope that will suffice.

Sounds like you're set.

I'm pretty sure @longhairedboy lives on Cheetos

awesome looking mod to the deck I would make sure you put a coat of the epoxy or wrap the edges of the board with the carbon so it stays more water resistant with the fresh wood exposed it can become waterlogged and can cause delaming.

Thanks for the advice. My plan at the moment is to wrap the edges with carbon. Unfortunately I'm about to go on vacation and won't be able to finish it anytime soon, but in the meantime it'll be sitting safe in my room.

I sanded off the cork layer, I added one layer of 1/16 veneer to the top, and two to the bottom of the board, and I've routed out the area for the enclosure. ![IMG_20190105_155957|666x500](upload://e9BlK0RdgXupktxjF1KNx1Wlt5m.jpeg) ![IMG_20190105_160016|666x500](upload://Pr5XakSsxFSRzihCWTS16oQ6Pc.jpeg) 
The router sled ended up cruder than I had hoped, but still did its job well. I also routed down to the original board where the trucks are mounted (I'm trying to keep as low to the ground as possible). ![IMG_20190105_160026|666x500](upload://zqQLamq4mHLtPlt1ylEJcxlDUDq.jpeg) 
This made the motor mounts bottom out when turning though, so I got rid of some material there. I'm going to sand the edges of both of these to get a 45 degree angle.![15467227680691899302454609023569|375x500](upload://33HY3mfITkTuHWN9rT13vvEJgTY.jpeg) 
I'm waiting on the battery before sanding and adding the carbon, it should be in in the next week or two.

Most everything I need to finish the board is in, but the build is taking much longer than I had hoped. Because of this I threw together a crude build on an older board till I get the tesseract completed. ![IMG_20190215_173710|666x500](upload://yfTte5anoDHjtQfq6mZaX4Hz5ML.jpeg) ![IMG_20190215_173720|666x500](upload://eJ6VwL6tKfhepfvq0QJP8vtYRdy.jpeg) 
I bent some aluminium strips and used double-sided tape and a yoga mat to keep everything in place, making sure that when the board flexes the battery does not. Through using this board I learned something, it's freaking heavy. So a motorcycle grab handle has been procured for use with the tesseract. ![IMG_20190215_172703|375x500](upload://p7vqLIEY8UMgfN6eirPegH2FG0e.jpeg) ![IMG_20190215_172743|375x500](upload://f9xkpQJ6rbsF1Su05bRoHKDs8td.jpeg)

The carbon fiber layup turned out okay, although it seems I didn't use quite enough epoxy resin. I plan on putting another thin coat on in an attempt up rectify that. Unfortunately I didn't get any photos of the vacuum bagging, but I used a roarocket TAP bag and fibre glast's resin, peel ply and breather/bleeder cloth.

Lol, I'll have to get you a better photo of it. I plan on using a similar color scheme for this board as I did for the bug.

I've finally gotten some more work done, the channels for the wires have been routed out. (Can you tell which side I did first?) ![IMG_20190330_151709|666x500](upload://7JRIItLhGisbsXwIF2AjhJy20VK.jpeg) ![IMG_20190330_151625|666x500](upload://vid8sVWoE83IkuQ3erpjz5OS3YQ.jpeg) 
Hot glue was used to plug up the holes so the resin wouldn't leak and can be peeled off when I'm done. 
@louwii here's those long overdue pictures of the bug I promised. ![IMG_20190330_165409|666x500](upload://2mqB36IceE8LPMmb4JVV0ZiuWtJ.jpeg)

And the board is finally done, although some touch up is still needed, and I don't like how visible the seams on the griptape ended up. Next project will be the enclosure.
