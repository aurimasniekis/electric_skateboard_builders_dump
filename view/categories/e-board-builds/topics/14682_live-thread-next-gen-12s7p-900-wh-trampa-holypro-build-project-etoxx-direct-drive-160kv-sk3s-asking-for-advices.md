## [This thread will be updated everytime I make my mind on a part!]

Hello everyone, 

I'm new to the eMTB craze and I must say some of your boards are insane. **I currently own the very nervous Bamboo GT,** it's a pleasure to ride in Paris and I often do some very long rides with 97mms. I recently gave it a new look, some of you may have seen it on Evolve various social pages, Here it is:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a129b82fc3b335bc35db58d6db38e0236419ab39.jpg" width="495" height="500">

The thing is, I just love the **AT tires but the range is very low**, I never get to use them. So after roaming on this forum **I decided that I wanted to make a Trampa build with a big ass battery and torque**, I'm seeking some advices about all that, here's how I see it [Updated]:

**(Keep in mind that i'm in France so EU part suppliers are better!)**

* **_BOARD:_** [**Trampa 35 Holy Pro with Vertigo Trucks & 8 inches Superstar tires**](http://www.trampaboards.com/35-holy-pro-trampa-deck-on-vertigo-trucks-superstar-wheels--ratchet-bindings--685-mountainboard-p-12522.html?selector_id=11002&qty=1&nochange=1&show_me=1)

* **_MOTORS:_** Pair of [**SK3s 6574 at 168KV** ](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-168kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)for high torque and around **50km/h top speed**

* **_MOTOR MOUNTS:_** **E-toxx** latest **Direct Drive Gearbox System** : waiting for some more tests of it but apparently "it's next level shit" said @Nowind  itself !

* **_BATTERY:_** Custom **12s7p** with **LG MJ1, HGD, Sony VTC6** or similar for **900+WH** capacity (inspired by @barajabali [recent 777WH 12s7p](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/chiboards-killer-trampa-12s7p-777-wh-dual-rear-sk3-190kv-6374-e-toxx-belt-kit-magura-hydraulic-brakes-holypro35-deck-8-primos-mastercho-mod-gt2b/12083))

* **_BMS:_** don't know much, **need some advice !**

* **_ESC:_** **VESC 6.0**, This looks amazingly promising. Should be available Q1 2017, check [this thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vedders-vesc-6-0/3813/166) for more info

* **_REMOTE:_** Don't know much about that either, but I know that I love the Evolve Remote (trigger style).

* **_CHARGER:_** Some **fast 4A or more charger**, else it will take a day to charge it, yet **I don't want to kill the battery too fast** !

I must have forgot a lot of stuff, feel free to tell me if I got all wrong ! 

Stay awesome guys

Etoxx mounts are really good apparently. The best esc imo for mountainboards is torqueboards 12s esc

how can you get a battery that has 1000+ AH???

## \#13 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2016-12-15T04:04:38.954Z Reads: 232

Maybe try Enertion's VESC X.. could be the best solution between torque and smooth throttle/braking that car esc's tend to lack.

using a 12s7p setup of 3500mAh 10A LG MJ1 you get 1058WH at 3.6v per cell. But the battery will only be 70a Max so I may go with LG HG2 or similar and get around 932WH

Thanks for the suggestion, they're a bit better (60A continuous 300A burst), but i'm not sure they'll be sufficient... I really don't want to fry them.

@kyo I think he meant **WH** instead of **_AH_**

@leomozoloa
Great plans! I think you can ask NoWind about the drag, perhaps he can get you 15mm setup or just go with the chain.. (if you dont mind the extra sound)

I'd also advice TB 12s esc or the Vesc-x. Actually would be great to see someone using vesc x on mountainboard, though, hard to speculate is it also recommended to run 8-10s, instead of full 12s.

(60A continuous 300A burst)
[/quote]

true, but it is still pretty crazy to pull 120amps **continuous** from your battery, so I think the VESC X would do the best job. 

and it they can burst 300.. even half of that is more than your battery can deliver (when you add both VESC's together).

I have had 3 seperate torque board 120a escs die. I would not recommend. They vibrate apart and sometimes the mosfets burn out frying the whole thing. I'd personally get a vescx, direct fet vesc from ollin, or wait for new vescs 6

@Stevemk14ebr

at what voltage did you run them?

I think noWind also had some problems with roxxy and vibration, so he had a plan to just pot / epoxy the components..

im actually considering buying them too, I do hope to get fvt one''s, not the maytech rebranded ones..

One more thing would be, I would run them at 8s possibly as im not after all the speed and I'd like to save a bit on batteries / charger. Will see how it goes. Ok sorry for hijacking this thread but still it relates to the esc choice, so it might fit in here.

@Randyc1
Thanks! Yeah sanded them down!

@Stevemk14ebr

If the vesc is rated at 12S it means it can handle 50 to 60V easy, i'd be more worried by the max current flowing in, which should be lower due to the high voltage. Are you saying TB ones fried because of vibration, or bad mosfet? They're rated way higher than vesc-x and co tho, i'll be very scared riding something with 1/2 the max current of frying TBs

It's about design and build quality. The vesc was specifically designed for this application. Tb's esc is just a (relatively cheap) reflashed car esc

ESC is actually the bottleneck of EMTB builds.

If you wanna go with 12S, and this is what most people wanna do :wink: 
you dont have any really reliable and powerfull options IMO !

I fried two VESC on 12S and two Roxxy9120 on 12S the last months.
Got a Maytech 12S Sensor system which was not workable too.(Send back and waiting for replacement)

Difference between VESC and Roxxy is that the VESC is the more adjustable and smoother ESC, but also it has alot less power by low RPM. And torque is what you need in an MTB!

I modifying the Roxxy actually to improve resitance against vibrations and "rising voltage" with Cap-Bank.
But if this helps, i dont know actually, tests will shown.

Never tryed the TB12S ones, a long time i heared only good stories about, but in the meantime also enough bad stories ... 

So make long story short : I cant recomend any 12S ESC actually, i killed them all :smiling_imp:

Have to say that i always pushing the limits, and iÂ´m very good in destroying nearly everything... 
You can compare with wear of tires : If i read that people say they are riding their Primo Alpha Tires for about an year i know they just dont ride as hard as i do...

What i can recomend is a 8S ESC from Hobbywing the MAX6, never killed one. They are waterproof, no problems with vibrations, easy to setup. They just do what they supposed to (-; They have downsides too like the braking sound but nobody is perfect...

And let me tell you one thing :

## The Key for happy riding is a stable system.

You will be really fucked up after investing at least 2K and cant ride because a shitty ESC !

Actually i set up the Direct Drive Trampa HolyPro with
Alien APS HEV 6374-240KV Motors with Hobbywing MAX6 and good 8S Lipo. 
Got a VMAX of 50kmh, enough torque to do wheelys. 
Last Video on street where with an battery consumption of 24Wh/km by average of 27kmh.

Cheers
Jenso

All of this is very nice! Thanks a lot Jenso. I wonder if I could go for a happy middle like 10s8p and lower KV motors, Is there any eMTB with 10s that never fried? But I keep in mind the 8S thingy !

I have around a year and half using 12S lifep04 setup is equivalent to a 10S li-ion and using 12S FVT from TB with no problems so far. Before I use to have a 12S lipos pack but that lipo pack got damage by the vibrations.

What I have notice is that the ESC need proper cooling because the overheating cutoff safety system needs a little headroom to engage and protect the ESC.

Looks like external temp probe and cooling fan is just what it needs to stay in the safe zone..

There were some plans on this forum on how to make a fan that starts cooling only once a certain temp has been reached.. otherwise, it could be set to just work all the time, like it is working for fvt 6s.

What is FVT 120a is it a Torqueboard esc? Didn't someone just say they were bullet proof? hm....

Can someone actually explain to me how a VESC can fry? aren't they current and voltage limits you can apply on BLDC tool? This and BMS limiting too?

I'm actually waiting for the VESC 6 to come out, it looks fantastics and the test Vedder made were incredible. I'm in no hurry because I'm not made of money ATM so I can wait !

Also updated, I'm really thinking into getting @Nowind latest direct drive system, waiting for more tests as well !
