Hi all, 

Im currently running a dual chain drive setup on a diy mountainboard build. Im currently waiting for some new Lipo's as the others weren't great so am changing. Im also considering changing the motors and wanted some thoughts.

Im currently running these:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/dt6376-14p-sensored-motor-125kv.html

But have seen a lot of people using these
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

Whats everyone's thoughts?

Thanks in advance

```
Sensored vs unsensored 
Small vs bigger
Low kV vs higher kV
Why you want to change and what’s your thoughts behind?
Both would work for a specific goal you wanna reach.

 want to get a bit more speed mostly really, bit more of a kick to the board. 

One of the biggest differences which is not something im too familiar with is the Internal resistance ad on the SK3 is only 0.016 Ohm compared to my current motors being 90.

I just realised that the SK3 motors are too long for my setup. anyone know of any motors that match them specs but isnt as long?

Im assuming by hanger you mean motor mount? If so, its a custom build so i will make the mounts fit the motor, its the space between them i have the issue with

I wanted to know which trucks you use.
if you want us to tell you which motors would fit we need to know how much space you have.

I have a maximum 163mm to fit the two motors between.

Thanks

Hanger means hanger. Its the part of your skateboard trucks that holds the wheels and what you mount your mounts too....

Especially flipsky 6374.
Some of the smaller flipsky motors seem to have better reviews but the 6374 is not worth the money.

Ill always recommend maytechs. 
@hyperIon1 has been cutting some great deals lately. 
Tb has quality parts and they are here on the fourm regularly.  So if any problems do arises you know you're taking to a rear person.

Message @hyperIon1 he's been clearing out stock and smelling things lower than normal. 
If he doesn't have anything that works post a WTB thread. Never know what people have laying around. 
What's you max budget for a pair?

Max budget is £150 for the pair, which is why i was looking at the HobbyKing SK3's but they are too long for my setup. 

Whats the thoughts on the Torque motors?

Alienpowersystems are rather cheap , based in the uk and have lots of motor sizes available. I have their 6355 unsensored motors which work great (i am selling those) and 6384's which i haven't tested yet. You could also go for Faraday motion 6364 motors. They are only 70Euro a piece . Only used them for 500meters but they had way more torque than the 6355 APS motors + they are sensored. I have no idea however what the Faraday motion motors are worth quality wise but for 70Euro it is a real bargain.
