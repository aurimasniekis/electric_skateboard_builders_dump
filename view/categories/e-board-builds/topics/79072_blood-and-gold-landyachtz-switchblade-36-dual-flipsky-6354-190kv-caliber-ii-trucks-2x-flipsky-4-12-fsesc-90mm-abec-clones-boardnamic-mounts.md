Starting this thread now since I've got a good amount of the parts coming in and still need help with a few tips and suggestions. I won't be able to see how everything fits together until I slowly get more parts in. 

I got this deck in my Landyachtz mystery box and I'm not 100% sure I can use it for this build but I'd like to try. The enclosure choice will be a challenge and I'll have to use risers for sure.

For the battery I was thinking about doing this high powered 10s lipo with bms

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014

I also need to choose a VESC and I'm hoping to find a good balance of quality and affordability.

Don‚Äôt buy the 4.20, the 4.12 and 6.6s are quite good I believe. Some people have had to run different firmware on the 6.6 though as it would have momentary cutouts

[/quote]

Just so you're aware, there is a dual 4.20 plus. Its more capable @ 10 and 12s. One member here has been running it 50/50 with no cutouts. I have a feeling all they did was change the caps and add a smart antispark. Trying to figure out what caps they used so I can change mine and be a plus lol.

Now I just need
2x 16t 12mm motor pulley
Battery (still deciding Lipos or just purchasing 10s3p Li Ion)
Vescs (probably two single flipsky 4.12)
Enclosure

The journey continues. Hope to wrap this up by spring/summer

I ordered a Landyachtz Switchblade 36 to use as my deck instead.

Don't do that. It would increase your rear truck angle along with your chance of speed wobbles.

Also, I soldered my bullet connectors for my wires that go from my 3D printed risers to my (still undecided) vesc's

I wish the unity was more readily available. Right now I'm aiming towards a couple of 4.12 flipsky singles, but I'm worried about learning how to pair them via canbus or split ppm. I'll have to read up on it a bit more.

More updates! I solved my motor mount clearance issues with 50 degree calibers as opposed to 44 degree ones. I also got longer belts so I could angle the mounts up higher. 

I added a 7 degree riser pad too but it's not needed so if I find this truck angle to be too wobbly I will swap it out for a normal riser instead. 

After exploring battery options, I think I will be trying an NESE module 10s3p pack (enclosure won't fit a 10s4p NESE) 

Its either that, or just grabbing a @psychotiller 10s4p  after tax returns come in üòÇ we will see. 

Looks like I'm right on time to finish this up when the weather gets warm ü§ò

Hardware and cells have arrived! Building this 10s3p NESE battery at the moment, but I also have a @psychotiller 10s4p arriving today in the mail. 

As long as the 10s4p fits nicely in the @bigben enclosure I'll be using that and saving this NESE battery for a different build. 

These NESE packs may take up a bit more room, but learning and understanding how a battery pack us assembled and monitored via BMS is knowledge you can't put a price on.

Only thing missing is VESCs and minor wiring pieces. üëå

Make sure to use locktight on the screws when you mount it on the vehicle and ready for a ride. For testing, not yet needed. 

I was trying to find the screws with locking both built in, but couldn't find it in bulk. That would make a tad bit easier and less messier.
I can use something like this but it increases the length of the modules even more.

And here is the Psychotiller battery in the enclosure that came with it. I think I'll use the Psychotiller battery and enclosure for another board and then use the NESE on this one since the first is better.

Crazy to see everything finally coming together. I finally caved and decided to go the glass frit route. I ripped off the grip tape on the switchblade and what do you know? RED AND GOLD. it was meant to be üòÖ 

Waiting on two Flipsky 4.12 Vescs and a second 2.4ghz receiver and then it's just assembly time :slight_smile:

Will update once the final parts arrive.

Good to see you‚Äôre getting closer. Just been eyeing this one up to see if it would work out. With a bit of vigorous sanding it should be ok...

Glass frit is done and looks great. Next up is just figuring out how to fit everything in and make it look pretty... Struggling with it a bit and trying to figure this out.. any tips on cable management and streamlined wiring of components? Using two single vescs seems to add a lot of extra wires.

In your case I would say ditch the connectors altogether. Since my ESC had the connectors soldered on it, I had to so it the way I did. 

You need a big ass soldering iron(100watts) to be able to solder nicely.

I also mount everything on the deck with some kind of vibration proofing underneath to protect the components from falling out because of vibration.

actually looking at your setup again, I would say that you have enough space(right of the bms) to connect your esc using the xt90. BUT the way you have connected the output of the battery to the 2 xt90 connector doesn't seem right. they should be connected in parallel not in series.
```

The xt90 is for loop key. The heatshrink is red so it is misleading. I have already connected everything and bench tested it

Ah okay. Then that's fine.

The above video makes sense if you don't want to connect the ESCs together to one common xt90.

Well today was the first day I got to ride my board. After 3 months of work and buying shit on eBay and waiting. 

Despite the (temporary) Velcro straps (because I don't want to undo and redo 10 bolts every time I want to adjust my vesc settings until I get them right) and despite the deck being "backwards" even though it's symmetrical anyways, it's done. It's beautiful, powerful, and completely DIY. 

Still need to wire in my battery display panel and some small things but I went for a 5 mile cruise and I can't believe the difference between this and my cheap hub motor board.

One issue I seem to have is ground clearance with the @Boardnamics motor mounts. With 90mm wheels I have maybe a centimeter of ground clearance between the wheels under the truck.

Not a huge issue, but I've scraped a few times on driveway entrances and small cracks. Roads aren't the best here.

![IMG_20190404_150242|375x500](upload://q0WB2SSeqyiIBnd8owlJxXzHcro.jpeg) 

I'm assuming my only option to make this better is larger wheels. Can anyone point me towards best wheel option 107-110mm urethanes with abec style cores? I'm assuming electric flywheels are the best choice here. 

I also am on the lookout for 32 teeth wheel pulley stl files so I can get more speed. I could deal with less torque since I don't weigh much.

The screw on the clamp should be facing the other way, head facing the ground. That will help reduce the stickout. I also remedied this further by using button head screws which are a bit flatter.

Should mention that my @danile fishook remote did not work out. Must have been something with my soldering but when I went to program it with the vescs I could not get a readout. I will try again but for now I am using a mini remote. Other remote options are welcome as I definitely prefer a thumb throttle.

I also have 107mm reflys on the way now. I need bigger wheels for our shitty roads. Plus it means a little more speed. 

I will probably paint the entire deck black to stealth out the color scheme.

Less about expensive and more about being bigger and softer. Now, try pneumatics and see if you will want to go back to PU wheels :D. Of course you will need to gear it right to retain the same torque and top speed.
