So this is all new to me, I do however seem to have some semblance and general knowledge about the parts, how they're connected in the build.  RN I just ordered a deck and some wheels from muirskate.  This build's gonna be ongoing through the summer because I'm broke and can't buy all the parts at once.  Anyway, logistically I'm still trying to figure out the motor pulley situation with the venom magnums.  Saw OKP had a build with these but I haven't heard anything after posting on that thread and messaging him about pulleys.  I may have to find a way to design these pulleys myself over the summer, we'll see.  Any suggestions on how I should proceed with these wheels?  ![53%20PM|690x406](upload://8yvGQaOEiMD3FHUNivnmasdxze8.jpeg)

Yeah I wanted a cruiser with a kicktail, it's what I'm used to riding since I was a kid.  I haven't decided on the battery yet, but once I get my board I'll start considering that.  I've heard enclosures are a real pain if you haven't planned it out right.  I want to minimize the chances of this board exploding so I need to really read up and make sure I understand batteries and appropriate output for the motor and what not.  Any suggestion on programs to use for mac that are like CalcRC for calculating all that stuff?  CalcRC sadly for windows only =(

You don‚Äôt really need to do any ‚Äúcalculations‚Äù 
They‚Äôve all been done for you on this forum! You may have to make a custom enclosure for that deck unless someone has already done one.

Or buy one made out of abs and form it yourself, then wrap it in carbon fiber to make it strong. Check out @Sender‚Äôs work with carbon fiber, the man is a genius with it.

Do you know what motors you are getting? I would start there (instead of figuring out your battery). 

Then pick out what VESC you are going with, you can set battery/amperage limits in your Vesc to make sure it pairs nicely with your motor. Stick with trusted vendors and you should be good.

Good luck on your build!

Those are two good calculators, you can make your own enclosure out of glasfiber and epoxy fairly easy. Also psychotiller.com has many enclosure choices who might fit. Choose your battery according to your motor size, needed range, torque and topspeed you want to achieve.

I'm thinking a 220kV motor?  I'm 6'1", 190 lbs and don't need to go more than 27 mph.  Some uphill capability would be nice for my area. 
I'm totally noob so pardon my totally nOOb questions here, BUT...
what about something like this:

https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-5055-220KV-Electric-Skateboard-brushless_60494888821.html

Also what does the "5055" part of "5055 220 kv" mean?  What's that a measurement of?
I know I need to consider max cuurent, max power, and max lipo. cell.  The values for these are 30A, 1170W and 2-10 lipos, however I'm not certain what all these numbers mean and how they translate to my build.  Sorry again for the nOOb questions.

5055 or 5056 or 6355 or 6374 are the motors size (length&width) 

If you're going 12s its best to keep it under 200kv. 170kv is a nice sweet spot. 

Great deck choice.  I've got the 33 of that deck and the 37 is next on my list.

Heads up tho.  The deck is kinda thin.  Making it harder to install threaded inserts fot mounting the enclosure.

## \#16 Posted by: rusins Posted at: 2019-05-11T12:01:05.667Z Reads: 107

```
Just to sum up all the information currently given in this thread:

* Desired top speed: 27mph
* Needs enough torque to go up some hills
* Wheels are 78mm magnum's, meaning it's going to be a belt drive setup
* deck has a kicktale, meaning the enclosure needs to be small
* budget isn't infinite, can't go all out

For hills I would recommend a 63mm motor instead of a 50mm one. Because 27mph is quite fast, I assume you'll be riding on the road with cars, so having dual motors for extra traction and safety would be good (I think Brian would disagree though so it's debatable). I think it would be good to go for a drivechain solution that would allow you to upgrade to dual motors in the future if needed, but currently stick with a 1 motor setup just to keep the build costs low. Since you seem to be in north America, a TorqueBoards 6355 motor might be perfect, depending on the trucks / pulleys you can get.

Your range requirements + available enclosures will determine what kind of battery to get. (Lipo or Li-ion)

I'm thinking I'll go dual motors for the extra torque to help with uphill.  My budget is around $700-$800.  If it's an extra $100 for 2 motors vs. 1 I feel like that's worth it.  Belt drive for sure.  I'll be on the roads with thing, which I already do with my wowgo mini, but the dual hubs are terrible in terms of shock absorption.  Which is what inspired my build in the first place.  Having good wheels in the back seems like it would be a total game changer.  I figured I'll just take whatever trucks work with whatever mounts I can get, I feel like I can't be too choosey about the trucks.  Calibers seem to have the most options available for a secure motor mounting.  So for now I'm leaning toward those ToqueBoard 6355's @rusins.  Recommendations on trucks/pulleys for these motors?

A dual drive VS single will cost you 1 additional  motor, 1 additional mount and pulley system, and 1 additional ESC unless you buy a dual drive ESC like the Focbox Unity from the get go. Usually it comes around to be an extra 300$ :confused:

Caliber 2 trucks might be fine for dual drive as long as you use 12mm wide belts and 8mm wide motor mounts. The hanger width is 184mm, meaning you have 92mm to fit each motor, mount, pulley system + wheel overhang. Kegel core wheels usually have a 12 - 15mm overhang so it fits with a 4mm space between the motors at worse, but I'm not sure about the dimensions of your wheels. You should ask someone, and also find out if 12mm pulleys are available.

If not, you'll have to go for a truck with a wider hanger, like TB extended 218mm caliber 2 clones. Best mounts for cheap are Dhiko's which you can find the ebay link somewhere on this forum. You can get motor pulleys from him too, or from TB. Wheel pulleys you need to get from someone on this forum who makes them.

I've never owned either brand.  The TB motors (6355) tho i feel like have a better warranty seeing the owner of the site is a community member. 

Alot if guys use both of those tho.  
They are the same kv so will be similar speeds but the bigger motor will stay cooler while doing it.

These are also on sale.

You can build a single motor esk8 and then upgrade to dual later. I'm not saying you should, just that it's an option. 

Maybe look for a couple of refurbished or used focbox's to save some cash. 

@okp is still testing his SV pulley and mount system, prolly a couple of weeks it at first. It won't be cheap either, he makes quality gear. 

I'd suggest looking at flywheels and caliber 2s,  is ask @jlabsb about motor mounts, he had dinner that are easy to install and rockk solid. He has some good flywheel cones as well. 

Both @JLabs and @torqueboards motors are quality, you'll be happy with either one.

So I'm thinking of just going all TB for the trucks, motors, and mounts: TB6355, TB218mm trucks and the V5 dual motor mount set.  I'm looking at the bottom and it says compatible with 6374 motors.  These are compatible with the 6355's too right?  IDK, getting all this stuff from TB seems like the easiest route for getting all this to fit together no?

I use a fair bit of tb stuff and that v5 mount is a good quality item.  The motors used to have a few issues but they have been sorted now but no real testing has been done yet.  The sk3 motor you linked is however pretty much bullet proof but is a sensorless unit.  Sensors just stop the cogging or shuddering you get when starting from a dead stop.  I barely notice it on my set up.  They are a big unit though measuring in at 86mm end to end so with that mount being fixed you may run into problems getting 2 in there.  They do fit the tb 6374/6380 and for someone of your weight thats the size I would be going for.  Not much difference in the power but the 6355 will get hotter when you push them.  Grab the lot from torqueboards and be assured that it all goes together and you will get some good back up.

So just for logistics sake here, say I get everything TB; the 218mm trucks, dual 6355 (@dareno you think I should go 6374/6380?), 15mm belts, which motor pulleys do I go for?  Obviously15mm, but how many teeth?  Is there a consideration between motor pulleys, # of teeth on the motor pulleys and # of teeth on wheel pulleys that I need to consider in terms of compatibility with each other?  My main concern is that in the end all this is compatible with the wheel pulleys which I'll have to find from someone on the forum, and so far okc is the only on I've seen with anything.  I just don't know if his are going to be compatible or if he will even have any to sell me, I haven't gotten a response from him yet.  This is the nitty gritty part that I'm still clearly not very knowledgable on yet, I just want to make sure all the parts (specifically the pulleys and belts) will fit in the end before I buy all that stuff from TB.  Thanks again everyone for being patient with a noob and helping guide me in this!  This community is reallly badass!

@okp's pulleys for the magnums are 32T (tooth). TB motors are 190kv. Hard to say what motor pulley tooth count you should go for before you've decided what battery you'll be getting. You can use [this simple esk8 calculator](http://calc.esk8.it/#{%22batt-type-lipo%22:0,%22batt-cells%22:10,%22motor-kv%22:190,%22system-efficiency%22:85,%22motor-pulley-teeth%22:15,%22wheel-pulley-teeth%22:32,%22wheel-size%22:78}|) to see how different battery configs will affect your top speed.

However, you don't want too few teeth, because then your belts could slip. I'm using 14T pulleys and my belt slips if the tension isn't perfect, so I would recommend either 15T or higher.

Playing around with the more advanced calculator ([calc.3dservisas.eu](https://calc.3dservisas.eu/?Tc7BCsIwEATQf8lZJLFprF6jeFICBXu3HiKYNtCj-O_uTIJ6ezvsTvJSNx_VXj0f86RWMlxkaNZOvPhebDQZhJbyWNC6xAdMpi3Gzqbk7DTCjI4G-LvLoa91OfAIYlXTkggd-S0ao69NYzyKOk1ecW7h5GtT4rd3zMIMW_L3fvKMsXwfFuG2A09npI4csM0FPubU-wM=)) to see minimum speed as well, I think 16T motor pulleys with a 10s Li-ion battery would be perfect, giving you an average loaded speed of 27mph, and max loaded speed of 31mph. (Minimum 22.5mph)

As for motors: dual 6355 will be completely enough for you; my dual 6355 bring me up steep hills just fine; would be silly to put anything heavier on your kicktale deck anyway :slight_smile:

Just realized @okp's pulleys have an integrated bearing (they don't clamp onto the wheels from both sides), so you'll need a truck with an extended axle to use them. Luckily, the TB trucks have an extended axle, so they are still a great choice.

[/quote]

So. The closer together the teeth count, the higher the top speed. Further apart, more acceleration. 

So let's say you start at 16t motor pulleys and 40t wheel pulleys. 
If you went from 40t to 42t on wheels, you'd lose top speed for more acceleration.  Or you could go to 32t (wheel pulleys) for higher top speed. 

Now if you go from 16t (motor pulleys) to 18t , you'll now be at 18-40.  you'll lose acceleration for speed this time.

Just to add about the belt size, there is length and width of the belt (as well as tooth shape/spacing but that's basically standardized).  Think most people here use at least 12mm wide belt but 9 or 15 are options too, wider the belt less likely it will break (also want it tensioned tight enough to not have teeth skip but not so tight to put stress on the bearings in the motor).  The motor mounts typically have a slot for the screws so you can adjust the tension by hand (would be nice to have a bolt for this like on my mk3 printer but hand tensioning works fine).  The length of belt will depend mostly on the diameter of the wheel pulley.

I'll also mention that these wheels are wide.  On tb trucks you're gonna have a real wide stance.
@Frenchy has a great picture of them on multiple sets of trucks.

I wanna get a set but i plan on running 150mm rkp sr or 100mm tkp sr and running dual diagonal motors.

I know, they're insanely wide and have a pretty big overhang but the wideness of them is what I love about those magnums.  I used to have a long board with some really wide 75mm Bustin William Royce's, and I loooove the feel of those wheels.  Sadly they are completely solid units and I couldn't mount them

If you go surfrodz you can just replace with longer axles and add wheel spacers and make it fit no matter what.

In either case, the torque ratings shown by the calculator are incorrect, because they assume the motors will be run at a current equal to their power in watts divided by system voltage, whereas actually for startup acceleration and hill climbing at below max speed, you can drive the motors with more current than your battery can give. It comes down to what your ESC can handle and how hot your motors get (larger motors get hot slower/less). 

You just have to trust that dual 6355 motors paired with a VESC is way more powerful than most if not all premade production boards. As long as your theoretical max speed (based on battery size, motor kv, pulleys and wheel size) isn't ridiculously above what you'll be actually using, the torque will be just fine ;)

Those are 140 bear Kodiak trucks with 14mm extended axels to make a160mm hanger with normal 33mm Axel's..it's like a 14mm axel extension for removable Axel's makes them about 47mm of axel to play with with fits a press fit and a bearing.. now those are 36t x 12mm pully..and it's tight I'm going with a 32 for smidge more clearence and top end

@Frenchy thanks for the input!  I wanted to get the TB 218mm trucks which have a 47mm axel, and their V5 dual mount set and 15mm belts.  If you're running 47mm axels with 12mm belts and it's tight, that means I won't be able to get away with 15mm belts on my build eh??

So I gotta figure out this battery situation here, which is a whole other shibang now...I know I'm going 10s4p lion, my question is do I find a pack and order it online and what should I look out for?  I have zero capabilities in building a pack, I've seen some people get packs custom built from folks on this forum, and I've also read about having to open enclosures and recharge batteries everytime?  Do I just want a battery pack and a BMS if I want to build this so that I can simply plug it into the wall without opening enclosures all the time?

With the investment in tools and supplies and the potential for wasted materials during learning  you only really save money if you plan on building more than a few batteries.

Not to mention if you build a battery incorrectly or poorly, you're making a bomb that will burn down your house.

Well guys, I'm about to drop some serious cash at torqueboards, going with them all across the board for motors, turcks, mounts, pulleys, battery and vescs.  They have some kits that will save me a little $$ plus they seem like they're reliable and decent quality.  I'm gonna take their 12s4p battery instead of finding a 10s4p because they come with an enclosure and the price seems right.  Also I'm getting the kit to mount kegels so I can mount the caguamas I got lying around while I wait for a pulley option to become available for the MACH 1's.  So I'll be sacrificing some torque all together but gaining some top speed and range on my cags for the time being.  I still need a remote, and I wasn't too impressed with TB's remote options.  Any suggestions?  Anything I need to consider when buying a remote in terms of compatibility with TB's vesc's?

it's a good batt, you won't be dissapointed. 

I think the bkb mini will work and it's pretty cheap and loads of people like it. I'm about to try it out in a few weeks as well.

GT2b never is a bad choice, it's a bit bulky though if you don't modify the housing. That's my daily driver and it's top notch.

A more expensive option is the Hoyte puck remote, they should have a cheaper ~$100 version coming out soonish.

I should say though, the included 2 amp charger for the 12s4p is god awfully slow to charge. If you completely empty your pack it's gonna be 10+ hours to charge to full again. Best pick up the 4 amp one or a different 12s one that has an even higher amp rating.

Shoot, well I think I goofed up and didn't consider my bettery and vesc enclosure sizes fitting on my deck.  #nOOb shit.  The deck has a 20.5-24in wheel base and the 12s4p battery enclosure from TB is 20.2 in. long.  I didn't take into account clearance for the motors and VESC mounts, clearly, and goofed this one up.  Am I SOL now for using this deck with all these parts?  Here's another look at all the pieces I got:

Well you could put the motors under the tail.  But that would kinda ruin you using the tail.
Or...

You can do what im doing and go forward mount on fwd.

Im actually doing it on the 33 inche version of that muirskate deck.

To be frank with you, the TB enclosures used to be quite brittle.  If your deck allows you to use it (flex /  concavity wise) then go for it. Otherwise, you might be interested in looking at other solutions when the time comes. 

@eboosted and @bigben are the two most prominent figures in the enclosure bizzy

I guess I'll just have to see what this all looks like when it arrives, getting a different board style seems like the easiest route.  Ahhh so much to think about...

Its a bit thicker than the muirskate deck ( which is great for getting threaded inserts installed)

Should fit your enclosure/ motors no problem.

I really don't want to have to drill all the way through my deck to mount my enclosure but none of the five different types of threaded inserts I have are short enough for how thin the 33 inch version of that deck is.
Hopefully the 37 is a few layers thicker. 
I'm probably going to try and pool up some epoxy on the bottom to add some girth to the bottom of the.

Max wheel base is like 26.5

It's got a really nice subtle microdrop in the nose that kind of acts as a footstop and helps you really get locked in.
