Hey forum! If you haven't been able to tell im new to the electronic long board world! I just got a new job working for best-buy in my college hometown and need a form of transportation besides walking. 
The goal for this long board is to go 20+ mph and achieve 20+ miles! To commute to class-work-dorm. 
Im fairly tall and heavy. 6'2" and 230lbs
Im trying to make this long board a plug and play so I will never have to worry about charging times, I can just plug it in before I go to bed and wake up with a full charge. 
I guess the best way to go about this is too add my parts list and just get extra verification that all the parts will work together and Ill achieve my goals! 
Please criticize my component list as im trying to make this long board last me all throughout college! Let me know if I should change and or add anything!

My main concerns is connecting my battery to the BMS? Im still researching to try to figure out how this is possible. And then connecting my bms to the charge port! 
That and will this battery sufficiently provide enough range and power!! 
Sorry for the noobie-ness im trying to balance my research and classes together along with work. I just want to make sure everything is good before I bust out $800!
Let me know what Yall think!!

The thing I see is that the trucks will have to be Caliber II trucks which are available on amazon/ebay for around $35 a set. I bought that exact set of trucks/wheels and have currently put in at least 15 hours modifying the trucks and shaping multiple versions of aluminum with a hacksaw a file and a drill to make a motor mount! I do like the challenge though. Anyways, Caliber trucks for a plug and play system with that mount.

achieve 20+ miles!
[/quote]

Multistar batteries often have lower capacity than stated.
You will also need more cells in series (eg: 10 or 12s as opposed to 6s) to achieve 20mph on that motor
I recommend at least 10s4p li-ion battery, like the space cell pro4 (comes with BMS included) to get the specs you're looking for.
they also may not fit the width of a pintail shaped deck.

If you're looking for a plug in and forget solution to charging you will want to avoid using Lipo batteries, they require proper supervision while charging. Things can go wrong with Lipo packs and it can be dangerous.
Li-ion with BMS will be your best bet
