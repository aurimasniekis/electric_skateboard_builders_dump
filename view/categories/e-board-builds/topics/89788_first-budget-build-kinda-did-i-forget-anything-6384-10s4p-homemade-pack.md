these are better wheels

reduces the number of welds to make, and what deck are you using? Much quicker/easier to build a pack this way

How much better are those wheels?

I have a cheap longboard I got at GoodWill.

Where can I get connectors like that?

that BMS I don't think does balancing I tried those tiny china BMS and burned up 4 now, I eventually got one like this and I'm much happier with it (I'm assuming your planning on bypassing the BMS since it was only for 15amps?)

I hadnt caught that, thanks. How do I get total amps for entire thing? It says every 1000 mah is 8.33 amps, but that means with 40 its crazy high? Sorry I think im confused on this aspect of batteries.

Okay thanks. I've learned enough to know I'm scared and willing.

As an alternative, what's the labor fee for having someone build a pack on the forums? I want to do it myself but I also don't have experience with this.

Thank you for all your help. I might play it safe and go for something like this

Either way more research is warranted

I would suggest to go for NESE modules. Spot-welding is a hassle and I won’t recommend if you are on a budget and a beginner. If it’s something you have done before, then sure.

You can buy entire modules(3D printed boxes+copper tabs+fasteners) from 18650.lt. if you have access to 3D printer then you can build a 10s4P pack for <$150. Let me know if you need more information.

Okay, I messaged the maker of the NESE

I would love more info, I have access to a 3d printer, but despite all the research ive done, batteries are still very complicated and confusing.

You can refer to my build thread "basic pneumatic board" to see how I used them in my board. 

You can also ask questions in the "NESE" thread and people will help you.
