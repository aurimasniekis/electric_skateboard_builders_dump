Another custom build is coming! This time they want the Phat Matson and they want it all white on black. Black deck, white wheels, raw trucks, raw mounts, black box, you get the idea. 

What makes this one interesting other than the kick ass shape and color scheme is its a single drive for a goofy stance, so i'm doing wire channels accordingly. 

stay tuned.

two orders in less than a week. I'm going to need more Sterilite containers. And beer. Definitely more beer. 

Also i feel like there enough room directly under my new work bench for a custom XCarve install. I need to do some more measurements and research, but i feel like i could do a custom rig with a much longer and narrower rail set/work bed that could potentially do not only my wire channels but also my truck bolt holes and possibly cut the entire deck out after its done with that. Then i could flip it over and do the flat spot on the bottom and maybe even figure out wheel wells.

just cut out the phat matson last night along with another scarlet since the one for my other build thread was warped and i threw it away in a fit of esk8.builder.rage 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BFAkszahBsj/?taken-by=longhairedboy

both are sanded and drilled and ready to go back into the xcarve cave this weekend, then i'll get to stain and finish them with the most beautiful wire channels i've ever done. I can't wait to get into that epoxy. glass grit on top and these decks will be just mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 

parts have started arriving so more esk8 porn coming, and i'm going to be building another power pack for this so that will be here too. I'm using the 18650s and BMS from the group buys we did not too long ago for the 10S4P that's going in here along with a smaller 2 Amp charger i got a while back. Guess i'll have to buy more cells for myself some time soon!

I love that you can do something that you love in the comfort of your own garage & make a buck or two! I hope that more people follow in your foots steps and start creating their dream machines and living happier lives... 

I still believe that we (the diy esk8 builders) can become the "common" option for people who want electric skateboards.

The white on black color theme starts out with white wheels. They'll be going on raw caliber IIs which will also have a raw Enertion mount clamped to them, so really its going to be white on black with raw and blue accents, due to the pulley and motor frame both being blue. I'll probably use white bushings as well. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BFC9KcAhBr4/?taken-by=longhairedboy

I may upgrade this guy to a 4 Amp fast charger but for now i'm using a 2 Amp 10S charger with this BMS. 

That's 40 Sammy INR18650-25R cells, 2500mah each, in a 10S4P config  for a total of ~360 watt hours.

MOAR SKATE PORN:

so i did this deck at the same time i did the otherone, and here are the pics:

White wire channels since this build is white on black:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BFH0dohhBgi/?taken-by=longhairedboy

filled with that delicious WS 105/207 resin, let it harden, then sanded it down. After that i went back with the detail brush to stain the tiny bits:

One particular note about this build. Its a goofy stance. The motor is under the left heel, because you want the single drive wheel under your heel. This guy did his research and specifically asked for it. I may not have thought to ask about his stance, but i will absolutely be asking from now on. One thing about custom builds is shit like this makes all the difference in the world, and it must be worked in from the beginning when running wires in channels like i do.

Because I did notice a difference. On a 50mm motor, not so much, but a 63, even just a 6355, yeah i noticed a difference because my weight wasn't on the drive wheel most of the time while i was dropping one motor on each side of my personal board trying to resolve the torque steering debate in my own head. Having it under my toe was weird.  This guy is getting a 6372, so if he does notice a difference, it will be a bigger one than i did.

I dont believe in that weight thing, because if you had your weight on one or the other side of the board, youd actually ride in circles the whole time. weight distribution should be absolutely even at all times when you go straight! :wink:

the only effect I can come up with is some sort of preferred turn side. for example I usually lean heelside deeper and heavier than frontside, which means in theory I should have my motor really on the heel side (cause toe side gets really light and the wheels can easily break loose). in those moments, when you lean as deep as possible on the friction limit of the wheels, you usually dont play around with the throttle of the motor, so then the side of the motor also doesnt really matter too much!

I noticed no difference while riding straight, not even on the big fat motors. 

The difference i noticed was indeed while carving hard in turns. When i had my motor toe side, turning one way would not result in traction loss, but turning the other way would, and noticably. When i moved it to heel side, i could no longer tell the difference when accelerating out of turns, and i suspect its because a lot of my weight is still on my heel despite leaning forward. 

its worth noting that the issue of torque steering and traction loss as a matter of motor placement is still a debate, and its one that a lot of people have simply dismissed. That may be because everyone rides differently, and stance plays a large part of it. We could literally discuss this forever because no one is ever going to have the exact same experience. That being said i would rather adopt a standard based on my own experience in a situation where it could go either way and often does for other people.

Buyer of the board here. 

To me trust and visibility are the biggest obstacle DIY builders must overcome to become the "common" option -- DIY builders definitely beat out the competition in other ways by simply making a better product. As far as trust and visibility goes, I think this forum helps a lot. 

Honestly, I would have never heard of LHB if not for this forum. There's a scarce amount of information if you're coming onto the electric skateboard scene with no background - the only board with high enough visibility for the average consumer is the boosted board. Otherwise, you're kind of stuck with random posts on reddit that try to aggregate all the options available and even then it just feels like there's no option out there that checks all the boxes. That being said, this forum is big enough that I, a total novice buyer of electric skateboards, found it.
 
The forum does more than bring visibility, it is also a source of credibility and trust. I was choosing from a bunch of different options and, frankly, the custom build route scared me even though it looked like the best value. Without this forum it would be impossible to vet a builder without knowing them in person. LHB's build threads and consistent presence on this forum really gave me enough confidence to wire LHB, who is stranger, a big wad of cash.

Anyway, just my 2 cents -- I work in the startup space so buying a board this way is interesting to me on a couple of levels. 

Really excited about the build and LHB has been great with the updates. Can't wait to get the board!

This concept sounds a lot like snowboarding. You gotta catch an edge either toe or heelside. Am curious about whether or not this would be useful because of the kingpin. 
 The force is going to be distributed downward on the kingpin, centered. Even on a really gnar turn, weight is still going to be on the center of the truck. Since it's not like a standard axle assembly where weight is evenly distributed across the load,  it won't have the same turning reaction that a car might have. In a way, the kingpin consolidates the load and makes the two wheels behave as one. However, the vibration from the road will interract with each wheel independant of the others. That feedback could create the feel that you describe. Please correct me if I'm wrong!!

You are my second customer for a complete build that isn't myself or one of my kids, and as such you are helping me tremendously simply by trusting me with your money. I would not have been able to even get this thing off the ground if it wasn't for you and the first person who bought a complete from me. With no family money, no rich wife, no investors, and a full time job and a toddler, There was no other way to do it but take payment up front and re-invest the profits in consumables and supplies and paperwork. 

You literally paid for my LLC. 

I won't forget that, and i expect plenty of pictures of you riding this beast you ordered.

got those trucks chopped for this build now that the drive train has finally arrived.

and got the box done and here's basically what its going to look like when completed:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BGC867YhBr_/?taken-by=longhairedboy


and also got the BMS and pack wired in, here you can see me charging it up with a 2amp space cell style charger. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BGGEUvxBBh0/?taken-by=longhairedboy

I have to say.. the phat matson is kind of an all around wicked deck for esk8s. Nice and wide but short, yet it still has the full 27" wheelbase of the classic Scarlet shape. 

Pretty much all that's left for this guy is to get it filled up with magic smoke and street tested. All the parts have finally arrived. 

Also this box is working out well for both types of builds. There seems to be plenty of room for 12S or 10S 4P packs, and i could probably fit another 12 or 24 cells in there for a 12S 5 or even 6P with some creative battery packery. The next time i order cells i'm going to try and see just how many cells i can fit in there and still have 2 VESCs and a large BMS. 

Once i start having these boxes made, there will definitely be a deck and box kit offering on my site for DIY builds complete with mounting kit and maybe even volt meters and push buttons and things so you can cut your own holes and do it how you want to.

@longhairedboy this is another incredible build! Nice work! 

I notice that you're using the 2A charger for this one; where did you source the port for that charger, the one that you wire to the BMS and battery pack for charging? I've bought two baggies-worth of "the wrong size" and of course there's no info on the device itself.

beleive it or not it is the one @cmatson  sent me when i washed out my BMS back in January when i got stuck in the rain, and shortly after that i was contacted to start doing space cell repairs. It was all a rather interesting turn of events. The charger is also one of mine that i have extra because i have two space cells, one in my scarlet prototype and one i use for testing raptor repairs, and since only one of them needs to be charging at once i have no need for the extra charger, so its literally brand new and has been sitting on the shelf doing nothing, so i'm selling it with the build. These little 2Amp chargers really do get the job done, even on a 4P. ITs not really that slow compared to using a balanced charger on a 6S2P 350 Wh lipo repack, which is a ridiculous 3 or 4 hours dance of "is it still charging let me check every half hour oh it seems to have stopped let me start it again christ"

all of my builds are going to have 4Amp ebike chargers (aka fast chargers) moving forward like the one in my 12S build thread. plug it in and walk away for 2 hours and its done.

programmable up to 14S using a pushbutton on the back. I like to desolder the button when i'm done getting it set up so that it doesn't flake out and start doing things its not supposed to later on after its in the box, like display the wrong voltage after reprogramming itself.

they have a lens on them that is about 1mm deep so that it can poke through the hole you cut in the box. So many things about these are just perfect. 

If i can figure out how to replace the green backlight smd led with a red one, or any other color i want based on the build, then i may just die of happiness.

got the board together this weekend. I'm really happy with how it turned out. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BGQbHDDBBop/?taken-by=longhairedboy

Its fast and steezy. Don't let anyone ever tell you that a single drive puts you in the slow lane. Launch torque is lower than a dual drive but top end is comparable. Here she is out on the wooded trail i did the first street test on thie weekend:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BGRsl44hBtk/?taken-by=longhairedboy

I did what i call a Derp Tour first. That's when i turn on my Map My Ride app and don't pause the workout for anything, and i ride a trail with only a couple of straightaways and lots of shady twists and winds, and usually loaded down with people, dogs, kids,  and cyclists.  It records stops and averages and everything and presents a better picture of normal usage. Can the board handle me getting a soda? Can it deal with cruising extra slow while i chat with a cyclist? Can I carve around that kid whose just standing in the middle of the road for no reason? Can it carve around that one corner at ridiculous speeds? Do dogs sufficiently hate the motor warbling? These are the important questions. Derp Tour test results:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BGR1qPWhBp_/?taken-by=longhairedboy

After that run i had 26% battery left from the 100% I started with.

Then i did the performance test out on a different trail. This trail has plenty of straightaways and better pavement, and wider turns.  Took it from 98% to 1% where it promptly cut itself off as it should:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BGSmpXkhBkV/?taken-by=longhairedboy

Then i brought it home, charged it up a little, tore it down and cleaned it then packed it up to ship. 

I really enjoyed riding it, it was the first time i had really given the Witchblade/Phat Matson  deck a serious go and i think i'm in love with how it handles. I don't miss the nose or tail at all. Its also about 4" shorter than the scarlet classic. I totally forgot to weigh the board on its own before i packed it up though, and now i wonder what the exact difference in deck weights actually is. Guess I'll find out later.

Just wanted to write up a little update. I'm not going to write a review because, really, I'm not qualified so just take this as my subjective experience.  

I've had the board about a week and I'm kind of obsessed with it. I have no background in skating and the first time I got on one was when I bought a skateboard about a month ago. I took a couple of falls on that thing and never really got comfortable on it and hoped I would just learn to ride the Phat Matson when it got here. It was much easier to pick up than a regular skateboard -- easy acceleration curve, hella fun and the board is just big and rock solid, it's like you're standing on top of a little spaceship, or, as my friend described it, it's pretty much like Biff's fictitious hoverboard in Back to the Future made real. As an aside, I also rode a little bit on my friend's boosted board, the look and feel are totally different - the boosted board feels and looks like a good product whereas the Phat Matson feels and looks like great piece of custom craft work. It's a bit like comparing dinner at the Cheesecake factory (which is still pretty good) versus eating at a chef owned restaurant where the Chef's personality is integrated into the entire experience. I'm happy I went with LHB.

Riding in the city has been exceptionally fun. You get tons of questions, some jaw dropping when you pass bikers, and a lot of "what is that?" as you zip by. I plan on producing a full video on what it's like riding in Chicago probably after about a month. 

Unfortunately I do have to send back the board to address an issue with it and I'm going to miss the board. LHB has been great on the customer service front. Once I get it back, there will be more to come.

i'm tempted to take you up on that offer, but since i'm still developing my warranty through trial and error, i'm not sure how this would squeeze in. If it wasn't for this community i wouldn't even be in business, so i definitely want to look to the community for help when needed and accept it when offered, and of course give back whenever i can. 

My plan was, and is still is i  guess, to offer a no-questions-asked-as-long-as-you-don't-break-the-seal level of send-it-back-at-no-charge-and-i-fix-it-for-free kind of warranty. I don't explicitly have that written anywhere because i haven't completely formalized it and its also not the kind of thing you would hate to learn about in fine print, its really more of an easter egg of common sense customer service. 

However... If you and @guyguy  here are willing to give that a shot i'll still be available for consultation. 

I suspect that the regen braking current is set too low or something along those lines. I tested everything i could think of EXCEPT hard braking down hills. Being in florida it just didn't occur to me, which is kind of short sighted i suppose.  I'm also not a very hard breaker, so i can see how i missed this. 

The box drops when you loosen the 8 m3 bolts with a metric hex key, i believe its a 2.5mm that you'll need. Remove the truck hangers first or you'll find yourself irritated by the wheels blocking your way. Make sure the board is upside down on its back when you do it so that the box doesn't just clunk down and dangle by the phase leads. 

You'll immediately discover the seal when you drop the box. It has something clever written on it like "break this seal and your on your own" and probably a drawing of a skull and crossbones and "hail skatan" written in there somewhere. 

gently cut it away with a razor and you'll be able to get to the USB port on the vesc. You'll have to remove the electrical tape i covered the USB port with. 

That seal does two thing: it tells me if it was hacked around with and it also keeps the crap out of there that makes it past the gasket such as moisture or fine dust. I would advise making another seal before riding in case you get stuck in the rain. You can use visqueen or other heavy plastic sheeting such as from a gallon ziploc or something like that. And if you can forge my doodles well enough i may forget that you were in there the next time there's an issue. 

I already sent the return label via email, but you are of course free to not use it if you decide to go this route, or save it for later. I think they're good for a pretty long while.

Let me know what you decide to do.

Okay what are the symptoms that the board is experiencing? What is happening to it? @guyguy

I have no problem with anything mechanical or electrical but VESC is not something I'm proficient in yet.  If it's any other issue I can handle it but I don't do programming. Do you suspect is the esc?

i suspect its a settings issue in the regen braking. He was saying that the brakes are cutting out during really hard braking, so i thought maybe those settings needed some tweaking. Then lots of testing. If you're not comfortable tweaking VESC settings then the best thing to do would be to let him send it to me. 

You'll need BLDC Tool version 2.16 to connect to it if you guys decide to try it on your own. 

I'm heading out to Texas to see a judge about my boy (might be getting custody, i'm kind of pumped about it), so it would likely be waiting for me when i got back if it was sent out today, then i could probably have it tuned and tested within a day or two after that, then another 3-4 days to get back to him in the mail. 

You guys should totally go for a ride though. Its kind of cool two builds on my decks are in such close proximity all the way across the country. :slight_smile:

hmm, Im not really a vesc expert, but with my little experience Im actually not sure how to get around that problem - your max braking is determined by the max battery charge current which is usually a fairly small number (for example my 10S4P batteries accepts 4A/cell, so -16A brake current is the maximum).

not 100% sure how it worked with the vesc, but I think there was no soft backoff strategy - once you hit that limit, the vesc goes into under_current error (or something like that), red LED blinks and it takes a few seconds until you can do anything again - at least thats what happens to me with over current! so either you need to brake a little more careful, or youll just have to live with recharging your battery outside specifications. both slightly annoying, but Im not sure if you can really do anything about it.  :confused:

yea, like I said: you might charge your cells outside specifications if you do that! the samsung 25Rs also have max 4A charge current per cell!

then again Im always suprised how much you can actually brake with these small negative battery regen current numbers. my FOC accelerating and braking test had 50A max and -16A min and in the end the wheel slipped and the farting sound gives away that there was really some force involved and not just a weight shift to the other wheel:

But you wouldn't charge the cells outside of spec. Battery min (regen) is the field that determines how much charge goes back into the motor. Motor regen (min) is how much current can be in the motor for braking.

@guyguy congrats on the board.  Our boards are probably very similar.  I have not yet tested hard braking at all.  As I mentioned in my impressions I have only been braking pretty gently and even using foot braking near the end.  Now that you mention this, I will test the hard braking next time I'm out.  

@longhairedboy I think for future sales you should maybe increase the price a bit, and have an "official" warranty.  The extra cost will likely help you cover the crazy shipping fees for these big boards.

hmm, if you set battery min (regen) to 0, Im pretty sure you cant brake anymore. its the current the motor produces when you coast/brake. basically full brake means the motor phase wires are shortened via the battery and the current they produce goes right back into your cells as regenerative braking!

Thanks @photorph. 

@longhairedboy if you haven't priced a warranty into the full prices yet you may want to add that your product is sold "as is" otherwise an [implied warranty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_warranty) will be applied to products that you sell. Even if you do have a written warranty, the implied warranties will apply unless you add language in your warranty saying that implied warranties are not applicable. It's also common to attach shipping fees to warranties or something that states that the warranty holder will be on the hook for shipping/admin fees if it's found that they've violated the warranty in some way. The flipside to offering strong warranties is that they're very good marketing/sales tools. You also have a lot of options in how you set your warranties up - you don't necessarily have to price it into your boards spreading it across all your buyers, instead you could always side-car the warranty, like, have it as a customization option on your site where an additional 200$ during will provide 1 year warranty. You can even have tiered warranties like Apple which has 90 day with-purchase warranty and then Apple-care for 1 year costs extra. Just some food for thought.  

As an aside, good luck on your hearing in Texas, I hope it ends well.

@whitepony I guess we'll find out when it gets here. I'm going to try a few different things and report my findings when i do. I think i have the max regen current set to something like -20. The default is -60 which is kind of ridiculous IIRC, but i don't have it in front of me atm so i can't be sure. 

@Photorph i just bumped up my prices by $100 across the board. (haha.. the board.. see what i did there? sorry, dad jokes.) I'm trying to achieve the delicate balance of making money, covering my costs, covering say two or three returns for repairs, cover some goodies like extra belts and things, and still stay competitive price wise with commercial options despite not really competing with them on their business model. I expect prices will go up gradually as i make adjustments and as the market dictates, but for now i just want to get a few out there to tweak my production, make adjustments to processes, and gain some awareness. I can totally see going all the way up to about $2k for the fully loaded model though. 

You guys are all wondering how i build these for what i'm charging. The answer is by paying my dues and not making much money at the moment while i get things sorted. I have a day job that allows me some buffer and allows me to keep paying bills while i figure this thing out. I won't be quitting that job any time soon, probably not for a few years at least. In fact i'm actually trying to streamline my processes to allow me to do this nights and weekends without completely disappearing on my family. The xcarve is a big part of that, and so is having a third party make my fiberglass boxes. Cutting decks, routing decks for wire channels, and fiberglassing boxes are the biggest time sinks, but with a robot cutting my shit out i'll be able to not only produce decks faster, i'll be able to produce more variety in designs while still using the same deck press and mold. 

The only thing i can't do anything about at the moment is fucking china and their goddamned holidays. They owe me 4 remotes, two BMSs and two fast chargers. I've got three more builds i'm working on and i cant do shit with them because China. I need a US supplier of those steeze remotes, a US supplier of BMSs and a US supplier of 4amp ebike chargers. I'll be set at that point. I'll be able to reduce my stated build time and be able to build more boards in parallel. Currently if there are no delays on anything i can do about 5 at a time. I can double that with robots and third party fiberglass, and i could halve my build time if i could cut China out of the picture.

I tried it at -60 and -50 on the motor and 0 on the battery. Didn't notice much of a difference between the two.

I also tried both at motor and battery at zero - it just doesn't brake. 

So, my problem is that the vesc just cuts out a little too easily so I just upped (since it's negative) everything by a little: -15 on bat min -50 on motor since, if I'm understanding what whitepony said, it sounds like the vesc cuts off when the regen hits a certain limit. I don't mind if the brake is a little less strong, just don't want it to shut off so easily. 

Not sure if thats the right direction but hopefully I'll have time tomorrow to test it out.

not sure what upped means! :p you need to make the battery regen min more negative, like 4x4V = -16V according to cell speccs -> change to -20V to have more headroom. the battery will be charged outside speccs, but only for short moments and its still a million times better compared to crashing into a car or something!

you can always leave the motor at the negated max current for min current, cause thats simply what the motor can take.

@guyguy so I don't really have any big hills to test brakes on, but I tried them on flats.

I can easily say the breaking on the boosted is stronger.  If using only the boards brakes I have to plan ahead of time.  I'd say it's not strong enough to throw you off when I slam on the brakes (which can be a good thing i guess?).  

In terms of the brakes cutting out, I may have had that happen but I can't remember clearly if they cut out while I was actually holding the joy stick back.  I'll again have to do more breaking tests.  What situation were yours cutting out in so I can try that?  Was it only down hills?

Here's a little video I took of my friend just hard braking from about 10-15 mph (running pace) on flat surface. I asked him to brake as hard.

https://goo.gl/photos/wpVQ34B3ATEKk5zp6

You can hear it rattle then it cuts out around the end of second 4 - you can also see him move forward a little on the board. 

It's not just in hard brake scenarios, it happens in long brake scenarios for example if I brake softly for over 3-4 seconds it cuts out - you probably have to be on a hill to mimic this. 

@whitepony by upped I mean from -20 to -15. So, +5 on the battery min. I'm going to test it in a safe environment, if it's really soft I'll probably open it up again and retune. If I have to choose between softer brakes and the vesc shutting down mid-brake I'd rather have softer brakes. A lot of it is expectation and inexperience on my part too - when I was braking softly down a ramp into a tunnel it cut out and I just wasn't expecting that to happen. I had to just jump off the board and the board took a hit. 

@jinra this is what it looks like with motor min -50 and batt min 0: https://goo.gl/photos/XZwA7NwZRvGdU8Xz6
compared to out of the box settings which was motor min -60 and batt min -20: https://goo.gl/photos/jcEoxxgvpzPf5Nxr6

In both videos I'm just pushing the throttle back and forth. You can see in the first video it takes a lot longer to brake then reverse. You can also see it shutting down in both videos from pushing the throttle back and forth. 

When I set the bat min to -15 (up from -20) I was able to push the remote back and forth 10+ times before it cut out. At -20 it would cut out after 2-3 swings.

I was going off Jason's post 

[quote="onloop, post:1, topic:353"]
Batt min (regen): If lowered, say to -12 from the default of -20 will reduce the force of the brake (most noticeable at higher speed). If increased above -20 will strengthen the brake force (most noticeable at high speed). Also it will charge your battery more.

The cut out is caused by too much power going back into the battery right?

That rattle sounds like belt slipping?  I didn't have any rattle in mine for sure. 

I think sending it back to him was the best option.  He will take care of it.  

What did you think of the board compared to the boosted performance wise?  It's top end is much faster im sure and your range must be way more.  Not sure how your friend on the boosted kept up while you guys were riding together.  

Brakes on boosted are solid though.  And it has a lot of flex so the ride is more comfortable.  LHB boards are pretty stiff so you feel everything.  I ride mine on smooth pavement and that's where it shines.

Thanks so much for the link @flatlinecustoms. In the end did the suggestions in the thread help i.e. upping the min bat setting and changing the control to current no rev w/ brake? 

@photorph I'm trying to troubleshoot it myself a little first to see if I can fix it before sending it to LHB to save him money and both of us time. Adjusting these few settings doesn't seem that difficult either -- if the issue were something bigger like replacing a major component I'd definitely send it back. Playing with the BLDC tool has given me a lot of insight into how the board behaves and I do want to invest some time into learning how to both maintain and ride the board. In regards to the boosted board, we just swapped with each other and rode around the block. I had my daughter and my wife/his girlfriend were there so we didn't want to just go off cruising (although the urge was there...). I'm ~225lb, so the flex on the BB was significant, I never really got comfortable on it but then again I only rode it a short time and I'm still new to this. The roads in Chicago are extremely bad. I've taken drainage trenches (you can see one the middle of the road in the video I posted from IG earlier) speed bumps and all kinds of general Chicago road BS and haven't had much problem. Although, at the end of a ride I do feel like I've been sitting on a riding mower all day.

So I tested brakes today, they didn't go out on my while riding.  But sometimes when I have the board standing, if I give full throttle then slam the joystick all the way back nothing happens and then I just fully lose connection with the remote.  It stops working completely, I have to turn the remot on and off for it to work again.  

I don't know if I should worry about this or not....since while actually riding I haven't had an issue (yet).

I have never seen a steez disconnect for no reason. I suspect maybe there is a voltage drop to the receiver as a result of all the power swishing around when you slam it stopped like that under no load. Things behave differently when there's no load on the motors, meaning when you aren't riding. It sounds crazy but i was having issues initially tweaking that board's settings because on the bench the motors would get hot to the touch while running them for a while to test the battery. But then i took it out on the streeet and they didn't. So after lowering a bunch of numbers out of caution i ended up putting them right back up where they were. 

All of that is to say that what it does when you aren't on it isn't necessarily an indication of what it will do when you are on it, but these types of things are very interesting and worth looking into.

lipo and liion have identical BMS parameters - if you read the description of the BMS youll see that all the values are equally reasonable for any liion battery. overcharge protection 4.28V (if you charge to 4.2V per cell its good to have the overcharge protection slightly higher to avoid weird charger/BMS stop/resume cycles), discharge stop at 3V (quite high, good for healthy cells), balance to 4.2V

[quote="whitepony, post:84, topic:2856"]
lipo and liion have identical BMS parameters - if you read the description of the BMS youll see that all the values are equally reasonable for any liion battery. overcharge protection 4.28V (if you charge to 4.2V per cell its good to have the overcharge protection slightly higher to avoid weird charger/BMS stop/resume cycles), discharge stop at 3V (quite high, good for healthy cells), balance to 4.2V

I'm really confused now... I did exactly that what you've written about @whitepony; meaning that I've compared the specs of the two and they were indeed very similar. And so now I have to ask, since I'm far from being knowledgeable when it comes to such electronic intricacies: so is it okay to use for a non lipo setup, or not? ;) Is there a definite answer at all? or I won't find out until I actually try? ;)

@longhairedboy Good sir, could you plz tell me what awg are those black balance wires? And also what type/kind of wire is that? I've googled my share and didn't seem to find any relevant answers. Thanks!

AWG 24 or 26 is common for balance wires. Thicker wires are better if you plan on charging through the balance leads.

i'm pretty sure that's 22 awg high strand count silicone wire. I can't see the image you quoted because the post didn't do right but scrolling up and looking at it i recognize the wire. 

now that i'm stacking my packs differently i don't even use that wire anymore. I can just use the wire that comes with the BMS.

Do you think this BMS we were discussing would work well with 10s5p battery as well? Or is it good only for 10s4p? I already have the BMS ordered, and was contemplating upgrading the battery to 10s5p - hence the question. Thanks!!

whether you end up with a 4P or 5P battery does not matter to the BMS
