Hi guys, my name is Cristian and i live in Vancouver. I've been riding my 6S 40" landyatz battleaxe, and i had a big fall about 2 weeks ago, probably because i was using a GT2-E which on dropouts takes 5 seconds to cut off, compared to the 1 second of the GT2-B. So i decided i needed something slower in case anything happens to go wrong.(i just want to cruise and get to work in one piece).
I went today to check some smaller and lighter boards to downgrade to 3s, and fell in love with the Bustin EQ 36, its just a thing of beauty. Anyways, here's some pictures of my progress.
I still need to make the enclosure, i'll design that tomorrow and hopefully get the mold for the fiber CNC machined this weekend. I'll keep updating as new stuff gets done.

EDIT: Semi-finished board!

I've settled with 6s and ordered a VESC, that should give me speed limiting, without the hit to the amp draw, taxing the esc and the motors.

Now, would it be possible to leave my battery connected to battery charger (unplugged from the wall) while i ride?
I want to have just 1 plug to charge the board instead of having to remove the batteries, etc.

Search for BMS and you'll find a 1000+1 threads about them.  Single plug simplicity w/o removing batteries to charge.

If your concern was top speed - definitely look at the settings for max speed in VESC.  I'm down from you in Seattle so if you swing down let me know and we can cruise along Alki some time!  One of my favorites!

VESC and Anti Spark arrived!
All wired up with EC5 (and an XT90s because i was too lazy to change the VESC connector). Ill change it at some point, but it doesn't affect anything.

Also decided to trim the motor wires and terminate them with silicone cable to give it a bit more flex.
Those were a pain to solder since the motor leads are pre coated so i just heated them until the coating burn off. Then i opened the silicone cable in the middle and pushed in the wires, this type of splaying works pretty good and its a very strong joint.

I'll cover all this up with mesh sleeve when i assemble everything in the enclosure.
Next up... design a VESC enclosure that has routing for cables so that it protects them from touching the pins and shorting out. Also with a sloth for the Rx Receiver so that there's no chance of connectors coming loose.

Finally got time to print an enclosure for the VESC and Rx Receiver.
I also designed a spacer that goes under the VESC to prevent the sensor pins from shorting with the positive lead.
This will all go inside a fiberglass enclosure, just need to find the time to make it.

Well, it seems FOC is a no go, VESC just shuts down when braking with anything above -20A on the motor.
With BLDC it works just fine, so ill just have to use that and deal with the noise.

I have read on here that FOC is quiet on low speeds but once you are past cruising speeds then the noise is comparable to the BLDC setup.

More updates!
I re designed my enclosure, and started printing the parts, its split in 4 and each take about 8hs to print o.O
Printed a new enclosure for the VESC also, so that it fits inside the new enclosure.

The enclosure will be sanded smooth and then coated with 2 layers of fiberglass to add some more strength. Still havent decided if im going to do 2 layers on the outside, 2 on the inside or 1 on each side; As PLA doesnt really bond that good with fiberglass i was thinking outside and inside and have them join on the sides.

Enclosure prints finally finished! Managed to get 2x7hs prints done today! All stuck together and ready to sand/fiberglass.
Also tested the fitment of the components inside, seems like there's enough space for the bms and antispark!
All the inside surface will be covered in velcro and all the electronics will attach to that, then a layer of foam will go between the board and the enclosure to keep it water tight and keep everything in place.

Drilled the holes and put in the threaded inserts, it broke my heart drilling into the board tough. The case fits perfect, and will be water tight with some blue foam i have laying around from a sleeping mat. Took it for a spin and everything seems to work fine, except for my wiring which is WAY too long for FOC, so once i get the BMS ill make all the wires 10g and as short as possible.

So, im taking a step back with the enclosure, the amount of work it will take to getting looking good, plus the crappy adhesion of the fiberglass to the PLA made me rethink the whole thing. So i got my self some 1/8 ABS sheet and ill cnc machine a mold and have a go at vacuum forming instead. It should look a lot cleaner and be a lot tougher than this. Ill have to remove all the threaded inserts and fill in the holes, but that shouldn't take too much time. I also updated my remote with the smoother buffalo case i made, ill post pics once i get home.

I'm officially in love with vacuum forming! Its soooo friggin cool! I did fail tough,my gheto heater was taking too long to get the abs sheet to 180C so i gave it a go with 150F, not enough, so i put that same failed sheet back on the heater, an to my suprise, you can reuse it, so i gave it another go at 170C, still not enough on the edges, so i need to open up my heater box a bit more. Its ok tough, first try was just to get the feel of it, it was never meant to be the final product. Anyways, here's some pics i took of the process. Great learning experience!

EDIT: @psychotiller what temp do you get you abs to before molding? 350F/180C same as everyone else? 

BTW, sorry for the mess!

Lol nice! You need to get the temp up in the 250 range. There you will be able to get more detail in your mold. You'll start to see how the and should look before you attempt the molding process. 

I honestly haven't looked at temps in a long time. I just watch the sag.

@psychotiller, is that F or C? If its C there's something odd, since that's higher than the injection moulding temp for abs. (Typical Injection Molding Temperature 204 - 238 ¬∞C (400 - 460 ¬∞F))
https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-abs-plastic
@Tuomalar  About 10 minutes with the "heatshield" on top of it. A 1500W quartz heater would be ideal, but i cant seem to find any in Vancouver.

Ohh! That makes more sense! I might not have enough vacuum power to mold at the lower temps you are, also i need to add some weather stripping to make a better seal when i pull.

BTW, getting ready to CNC the new mold.

3rd time is the charm they say? I'm glad! The main problem i was having was the temperature of the center was about 20C higher than the outsides, this difference meant that the outsides wouldn't "pull". So i used a bunch of cardboard to cover t he outer edges and slowly but surely i got the whole sheet to within 10C. I think it came out quite nice!

New CNC milled wooden mold, wrapped in 3M Blue and a nice coat of baby powder!

And the finished enclosure!

Im done! (well, until i get my bms form supower)
I have to say, im extremly happy with how this build turned out! I might do some vinyl wrap for the shiny sk3 some time soon.

Here's the insides, im using heavy duty velcro to be able to move things around if need be and keep them secured. anti spark also has a 3d printed case, but i forgot to take a picture after installing it.

BMS Arrived! All wired up, connections all redone with 10AUG wire, although i need to rework them at some point to make them as short as possible to run FOC. For now ill just print a case for the BMS to sit in so its away from any shorts.

If you have a problem with FOC & long wires, huge capacitor on the VESC input may help...

I just have to rework the wiring, thing is i have to put some thought into how i lay out my wiring and "modules". Good thing is i covered the inside of the enclosure with industrial strength velcro, so i can re-arrange at will.

BTW, printed a case for the BMS to sit in:

Swapped the switches for IP67 ones, pretty beefy ones at that! Also swapped the 2 pin charging port that allowed for accidental shorting to the more standard 2.5x5mm plug.

So i rebuilt the arduino monitor and added support for monitoring the vesc. Also added two "usb" ports so that i can stop opening the enclosure every other day.

New battery monitor, still using arduino nano, but a much more robust and accurate design with LM324 ics:

LM324 closeup, im using 30K 1% resistors for unity gain.

4 Pin ports for USB, with 3d printed caps for water proofing:

New batteries arrived, its finally time to get rid of the lipos and build a proper pack!

@Decdog hey, i believe its 16/36 and with 107mm wheel it tops out at about 35-40km/h

@IsTalo Im going to build a 10s3p. I really don't care about top speed, i have my board limited to 15km/h as thats a speed i can run off in case something goes wrong.
