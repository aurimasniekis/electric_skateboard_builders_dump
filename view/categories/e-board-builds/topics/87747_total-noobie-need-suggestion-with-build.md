Total noobie here about building an electric skateboard. Not really high in budget. These are the parts that I have in mind : 

Motor x1 (Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192KV Brushless Outrunner Motor) = https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?countrycode=GB&gclid=CjwKCAjwycfkBRAFEiwAnLX5ITjkCdkHcKZMB76iRDNeBKGXx8Cukzj82kFXcyiE_RkrcFDrsbRDjBoCBBkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

Mechanical kit x1 : https:///products/single-motor-mechanical-kit

Battery Turnigy 3S x2 : https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-3s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html?countrycode=GB&gclid=CjwKCAjwycfkBRAFEiwAnLX5IZF6T9B1x2EKyNNfK0-yMzIxTO1Ki3D8EaHcTC13hx_B2J5XuW7yPxoCKA0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

Battery Turnigy 2s x2 :https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-2s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html

ESC and Remote : https://www.aliexpress.com/item/24-36V-Single-Belt-Motor-Electric-Skateboard-Controller-Longboard-ESC-Substitute-Parts-Scooter-Mainboard-Instrument-Tools/32956814634.html?src=google&albslr=231904636

I'm open to any suggestions or advices that you could give ! Thank you. And how much speed and range would I get with this build if anyone knows ?

It would be better if you used a higher voltage battery, 6s is fine but 4s is a no go

You for sure need 6s minimum, 4s will get you like 4mph lol... use 2 of these in series

Also try using a Vesc, it will cost a bit more but is so worth it

I'm going to connect them and get a 10s or just buy a 5s x2

Then you're looking at 30mph...that ESC will probably go first and you're gonna need a lot of connector harnesses but it should be good for a first build

The motors and drive kit are good though

If your willing to wait, hobbyking have sales often on lipos. I got 8: 3s 5200mah lipos for Â£60

It's is a vesc but for copy right reasons it's called a fsesc.
 The torque is probably better quality but people have found the flipsky 4.12 to be pretty solid.

You should get a VESC...they are undoubtedly better but require more setup and are more expensive

You can get a cheap ESC...they will definitely work but they usually die soon and are not good for the battery or motor (some draw too many amps)

To be honest don't know about programming the remote to the Vesc but I suppose it's not that hard

Don't make a 10S using 3S+3S+2S+2S.  It's better to match the batteries.  So 5 x 2S or 2x 5S

or 3 x 3S for a 9S

homie its not hard please do some reading. especially with vesc programming. You can make a big investment go down the tube if you program it incorrectly

The wheels are quite small and it's a drop down not giving much clearance for an enclosure

Edit: oops didn't see the mechanical kit.
Maybe buy just a deck not a whole long board because the kit comes with trucks and wheels

And what safety gear are you buying?
You know you need full face helmet, sliding gloves, knee pads & elbow pads at least
```

Don't you mean "at most" :smiley: Helmet is the least you need, and then sliding gloves if you plan to go fast. Everything else is just to prevent injuries that can heal over time / if you're going really fast imo.

The flipsky vesc is actually better than the torqueboards one. Runs 12s FOC perfectly fine.
About the motor, I would recommend the 149kv version for many reasons : better suited for reasonable speed, better torque, better erpm for the vesc, and allows you to use bigger motor pulley which means more teeth engaged and longer lifetime of the belts/pulleys

About lipos, imo it doesn't even matter 2x5s VS 3s and 2s because cells are all the same, and lipos are all quite the same,coming out of the same factories.
Just get the cheapest ones on hobbyking, they are all pretty fine, even the multistar ones. Especially for a single vesc4.12. Get your FSESC 4.12 on Aliexpress it's about 50.
Charge only bms, I get mines on Ali for 7 bucks. 
And also, don't buy anything at torqueboards it's too expensive for no reason. For the mount you can go with the turnigy one, it's tough as hell but you need to grind the notch in order to fit on caliber truck and to use longer 5x20mm screws with loctite.
15mm wide Pulleys and belts on aliexpress. Htd 5m 265 with 15/36 pulleys for wheels smaller than 90mm and Htd 5m 300 with 20/44 pulleys for anything bigger as it will be much more reliable with more teeth. 
Wheel pulleys can be found on thingiverse and printed. Use M5x50 screws with cyano glue, no need for nuts. 
Get yourself real good wheels, deck and trucks. These are what will change your ride. If roads suck where you are, get a flexy deck that's gonna change your life. 

If you need links just ask
Happy building
