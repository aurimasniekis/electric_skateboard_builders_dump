Well guess I better start this build thread up. Here's what I'm working with...

Landyachtz Evo Deck
TB 218mm Trucks w/ blood orange double barrels
Bolzen 12 degree angled risers
TB 6374 190kv motors
TB motor mounts
13s4p Samsung 30q pack
37t wheel pulley @Kaly 
15t motor pulley
Evolve F1 107mm wheels
13S BMS
2x Focbox

The Boltzen risers were perfect for converting this to an esk8. If you didn't already know, the evo deck has a 15 degree offset in front and rear built into the board. That's because this board was designed to do 70mph. Clearly we won't see 70mph... so instead of it driving like a bus with front steering only, the 12 degree risers took it from a 65/35 split to a nice 53/47 split. This should be perfect to be stable but not unnecessarily stable, while still having a really good turning radius.

These pullies I got from @kaly are awesome. They are machined so that you only use a total of 2 bearings per wheel side. Fit was great besides having to shave down spacer a hair on the inside to make it all fit together like a glove. Plenty of room for both pullies to run 20mm wide belt if I see fit.

The completed 13s4p pack. Big thanks to @Deckoz for helping me with the pack. Total length end to end was 20.5". BMS goes in the space left on the 6 cell side. Still working on what enclosure to run as I'll need a 23" of inside space to work with. There are currently a couple people working on single piece evo enclosures so hopefully I'll have something soon.

After falling off my Trampa at 31mph with nothing more than a helmet (thankfully), I'm not super focused on chasing crazy high speed. Although I figure this should be able to do 35mph just fine.

you'll hit 35+mph easy as long as you're not a giant. 

I have a 12s, 15/40t, dual 6374, with 107s, and hit 35mph with more to go

The components are rated for minimum 63v If i remember correctly, but you should always have some safety space for electronic components. Thats Why vendors says 12s max.

Cool. 35mph shouldn’t be an issue then especially on 13s. I’m only 185 pounds. 

From all I can tell people are just scared. The components should take 13s no problem.

I have the bottom of the cans about 1cm higher than the bottom of truck. They are tucked wayyyy up there.

Ahm, the components are rated up to 63V but there is a reason why the gap of ~15V is left. You will blow your capacitors, VESC is handling inductive loads, which in reverse can generate higher voltage than you are inputting ;)

Max voltage vesc can handle is 60v(or 63v if you know precise figure) iirc, seems like a few have done this and not blown up....so it seems, I had toyed with the idea but don't think it's really necessary

There are a few people out there that are running 13S no issues at all. Maybe you need to be a bit careful slamming full brakes with a fresh charged board. Maybe not....

12s is already tickling the ERPM safety margin with 190kv, no?

Are you all comfortable with the wheels sticking out way beyond the board's width? One of my most embarrassing and painful longboard falls involved a wheel and a foot. We not flintstoning much on eboards but if I have to footbrake I probably won't have time to worry if I'm gonna trip on a wheel.

I like the build though, nice job so far :)

for the most part, yes. IT seems to handle it ok. The boxes stay cool and the motors get warm, just like we like it.

we've been running a board at 13S on FocBoxes for several months now, and its working well. 
That's it on the bottom of the stack with the giant Tronix offroad deck and the MBS wheels. We now have 110mm Slick Revolution Rough Stuff wheels on it.  16/33 pulleys, standard caliber 184mm trucks with my 6355 motors.

Last night jake took another one of the 13S packs we had laying around from a dead Tronix sled and wired it in parallel, i think the P count is 16 now total but they charge separately. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcv0LJyF7Bi/?taken-by=longhairedboy

Its actually quite dreamy.  

My only complaint is the DieBieMS is only set up for 12S max. @fedestanco is there any plan to bump the supported S count up to 13S? Or, more logically, 14S in order to future proof it against later applications?

There's a noticeable boost off the line over 12S, and more top end.

for the DieBieMS, the chip that does the management part of the whole thing is max 12 cells. that being said you can daisy chain those chips, but im not sure if thats even remotely in the development queue for that project (@JTAG thoughts? hah) . Hopefully cell density will start picking up so we dont have to push above 12S

@pshaw sweet build, what do you think you'll end up with range wise? about ~20 miles?

I cant imagine how this will run with 13s, i have a similar set up on 12s and its insane how fast this is.

So I have a couple of things I need to figure out. 

I’ve never done a non flex pack before and although this board is really stiff... it will still flex some. With that being said is there an optimal way to isolate the battery inside the enclosure so if the enclosure flexes the battery will not flex with it. 

My plan was to use double stick tape to fasten the battery pack to he bottom of he enclosure but my fear is that will cause extra stress on the battery.

Secondly I need a nice flush mount xt90 panel. Apparently there is no antispark on the face of the planet that won’t fail and get stuck open... even the anti spark heaven ones that were supposed to be bulletproof. As much as this drives me insane, I guess I’m going to have to deal with an awful loop key...

No worries my man! I know you had like 3 different designs all going at once :slight_smile:

Thanks for the compliments! There are just a few things keeping this thing from being pretty close to perfect. 

- an antispark that actually won’t fail me
- a nice remote that gives me a telemetry readout. 

For the remote I know there are a few options but I don’t think they look good enough or they require a serious amount of time to build. Weirdly enough I’m kinda diggin evolves new remote. I just want something that looks and feels really high quality to match the board. These little cheapo remotes most of us use have crap for mechanical throw and feel like a cheap toy.

Now I need to figure out the best way to secure the pack. Right now I have a couple of strips of 3m tape just to test. Maybe this will be the permanent solution as I want to have the battery mounted to the enclosure. 

My only fear is that when the board flexes a little the flex will get transferred to the pack as well if I mount to enclosure itself. Any insight on this one guys?

Welp I took the first ride today. It’s really crappy road conditions as there is salt and sand from the winter storms.

Not sure if it is placebo but this thing on 13S at a conservative 80motor amps lurches harder than my previous board at 100+ motor amps. I suppose an extra cell would make a pretty big difference, I know it did on my quadcopters going 3S to 4S.... 

Never had a board in FOC mode before. Man it is eerie quiet, almost unnerving.

I know everyone is worried about 13S isn’t braking on a fully charged battery. But one thing me and a buddy were discussing is if the amp max of the FOC box is something to be worried about. I’m pretty sure this setup theoretically would do something like 4000 watts per motor lol. Doubt that would happen real world but if so it would be something to be concerned with. 

I need my metr module to get here so I can do some looking and see what is really happening.

Oh and no worries about beautiful enclosure... I quickly defaced it while going off a little dip :stuck_out_tongue:

It’s solid black all the way through so you should be able to carefully try a little bit of polish? I don’t know what sort of stuff you might have to hand but T-cut should cut it back to black. G3 is a good cutting paste but it’s not something that people have laying about. 
Do you have something called brasso? A metal polish, that may also cut back some of the surface damage.

Mine isn’t. Only the first 1mm or so is black. When I drilled holes it has chipped and leaves the white/ clear underneath.

Plasti dip spray it matte black instead. It will still look mostly the same, but will protect the actual finish somewhat and can be peeled off and reapplied when it gets messed up. 

Or some strategically placed stickers to cover the gash?

Lol that's still a Ferrari! Print or convert a car key case so it doesn't look anymore like a simple loop key :laughing:  BTW can't tell how but because of you I got a feeling of *why* (not a scientific why) high voltage helps a lot for pack acceleration, aside from top end speed. Now I'm tempted to ditch 8S and directly try 12S... Heh I already got that fancy 8S 6A charger! Not reasonable...

Update:

Board is an absolute dream! I have probably 5-10miles on the board so far and my voltage is now only at 50.4v lol.... 13S is hilariously awesome. I knew I would get more miles out of it by upping voltage, but not nearly THIS much. I can’t wait to get my metr bluetooth module so I can see just how few amps I’m pulling when compared to 12S. 

Riding in FOC is very nice and I have grown to actually like the silent operation (hated it at first). Noticeably more smooth when compared to BLDC. 

20mm wide belts are a damn dream. I can run them with super loose belt tension and still have perfect engagement with no skipping due to the extra width. I can free coast forever almost like what I assume a hub motor would feel like. 

The one thing I don’t like about FOC is the jolt it gives when decelerating from .5mph to a dead stop (almost like the motor is locking up right at the very end). Apparently this is just an inherent problem with FOC and can’t be allevaited. Doesn’t make sense why it could start up amazingly smooth but not brake amazingly smooth... but what do I know haha...

I’ll keep you guys updated. Future plans might be to add pushin cushion, not that it needs it but it would make it even more comfy. 

Oh yeah and lastly thank GOD I didn’t go 4wd like my initial plan. This thing is capable of lifting the front end off the ground if you aren’t laying down on it, and weighs ton even as is. A near 40 pound board would have been a big mistake. Maybe if you are going up 60 degree hills you’d need it, or weigh 300 pounds... but I’m not heckingneither of those boxes. This is exactly what I want an electric skateboard.

This is the first board I’ve owned that I’ve changed out the bushings. First was a boosted board which I didn’t touch and the second was a trampa so it had springs. I’m currently running blood orange double barrels 89a out back and 86a up front. 

I just took a look at this chart and it seems I need a stiffer bushing. I swing between 195-200lbs.

What do you guys think? I would definitely consider the evo a stiff deck...

Hey I know we talked but I'll put it here

Your currently on 
Blood orange double barrel 89a/89a rear 
And blood  orange barrel 89a boardside/ 86a roadside

As you like the way it feels/turns but want a better centering. Think you should switch board side bushings from 89a barrels to 89a wedges to increase rebound and centering. 

I'm sure others opinions will help though :)

PS the Muir skate duro chart is universal. Blood Orange is similar to Riptide APS bushings(not WFB)

Yeah it has been working flawlessly. The extra cell keeps battery amps wayyyy down. 

I haven’t seen over 40A ever and this setup is geared pretty tall and I’m 200lbs (setup will do 45mph easy). 

Even at 100A motor setting I’m not getting any of the abs fault codes I was getting with my 12s trampa build before this one. I’m sure it’s do to the upped voltage which in turn means less amps pulled. 

I will never build anything 12s ever again. 13s is the way forward for sure.

@alhow for range I would say 25+ for cruising and 15+ for beating the hell out of it.

@Blitz 

OF COURSE IT DOES!!!

Higher top speed, faster acceleration, better braking more efficient. 

Other than that it’s completely pointless tho 😂

Furthermore it was wasn’t even intentionally geared for speed. I tried to keep a really reasonable to have insane acceleration and not do much over 30mph to keep my ass out of he hospital. Well I underestimated what an extra cell does. It accelerates faster than I can even stay on it and it does 45mph easy. Best of both worlds. Slightly taller gears and this thing would be in the 50’a no problem. Not a chance I’m testing that shit out though hah.
