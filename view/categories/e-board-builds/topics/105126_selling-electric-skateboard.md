$700 WILLING TO BARGAIN 37.5" long 9.25" wide at widest point. It has dual 5055, it is belt driven with a 10s5p battery. It has 20-25 miles of range and can go ±30mph. It’s  **powerful**  Comes with a remote with 4 speed modes, reverse and a charger. Has 83mm wheels. The condition is like new except for some scratches on the underside of the battery. Sadly, there is no vesc, so not programmable, but overall a great ride. I'm in newton MA but if you're not from this area I am willing to ship it. ![image0|338x500](upload://5hNyh4nQKxegkdSDuQMo9dSpJdV.jpeg) ![image1|338x500](upload://c655d8VpBJ7oTYYlwBnb3WBM9MJ.jpeg) ![image2|377x500](upload://p4yvZ3sYnvsAtIosYdFLsW0GKa0.jpeg) ![image3|376x500](upload://7vaiyMQ90NL0SK5mz2rRONNsm4A.jpeg)

With the deck and the grip tape it cost me 615. After that I was hoping for some cost of labor. I said I was willing to bargain for this very reason.

Ok... said this once, I’ll says it again... this is a builders website. No one cares about labors. Several can build it better and faster. When you buys a part, it becomes used. If i was yous, Id be happy getting $400 back to covers the kit...on the plus sides, this build is a lot better looking than the last joker...
