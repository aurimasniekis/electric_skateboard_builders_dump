Hi!

I´ve owned one generic electric longboard before and now it´s time to build a new DIY one. All the parts will be bought inside EU since I live in Sweden to avoid toll and taxes. 

As of right now i got all the parts from esk8.de, can anyone check to see if this is the optimal for my budget? I am 200 lbs but there is incredibly flat where i will ride so that´s why I have gone for single motor. But it kinda would be nice with dual for acceleration and stuff :)

Mostly unsure about the battery, Li-ion or lipo. Lipo is cheaper and maybe could fit dual drive with same budget if i went with it.


Thanks

You can save some money on the parts if you source them separately.
For the same controller it can be found now in a lot of places cheaper. Ebay is one place or https://www.banggood.com/2_4GHz-Radio-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Transmitter-For-Electric-Skateboard-p-1125575.html?rmmds=search

I would rather buy the parts from a trusted seller with warranty, but thanks for your suggestion
