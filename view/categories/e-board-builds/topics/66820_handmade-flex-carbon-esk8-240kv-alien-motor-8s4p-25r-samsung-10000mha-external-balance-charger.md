Hi everybody, I made this build with what I had left from my other builds. But I’m more than impressed with is perf! 

![image|375x500](upload://5ggI3ypWvga3NrtjM3AMK5ykkug.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://ae8gtfxPOadmYhUrPDL1M1S6X3q.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://jMT9MHp3b6rj6PDcyXXdPUj1UEy.jpeg)

I have two board with 10S batteries and were not so enthusiastic to use 8s batteries because I had not a lot of choice. I had allready the 247kv motor and didn’t wanted to burn my vesc with 10s battery. But finally I’m pretty impressed with the power this bord deliver :) 

I used 25R cell in 8s4p combine with a vesc and antispark from UNIKBOARD plus a 6275 motor from alien power  

For the rest the graphics is made with thin veneer that took me a lot of time to cut with cutter... :s with laser cut would be just perfect but didn’t wanted to spend more money for it.

Board and grip tape design does look really nice. Nice job.

One part I didnt get - if u cut a hole in middle for enclosure, did u add another layer - for the looks at the end?

I do like the vintage / old wood look it has

I did it in many steps. 
First I just wanted to make a wooden deck with carbon look. 

Then I decided to add a W curve so a made a polyester mold of that curve. I cuted the wood to be able to integrate the battery in the deck. 

I then aplied 5 layer of carbon on the polyester mold  ( multi and mono axial) and I pressed with vacuum press the wooden deck on it.

When hard I add three last layer over the wood to lock it and to harden the deck to the flex I wanted. 

Finally I add a final layer on the top with the veneer to make the visual

After it was resin layer to make it shine and have it final gloss finish + the pose of the grip

I will post it on esk8.fr soon it’s just more difficult to do so because I’m without computer and as you know it a bit complex to place pics on this website
