Evolve has just released new board: EVOLVE GTX which means ..we all are gonna have new wheels to play with.
Seems like a nice 97mm 76a wheel.

Exactly! Really want a 97mm wheel that is a bit wider than the Abec's or the Trampa stickies..

EDIT: nevermind. didn't realize this thread was referring to the EVOLVE branded wheels. I have Flywheels that were purchased from Evolve, thus the initial mistake

No worries, I pulled the trigger anyway. I'll leave you guys feedback on how well they ride or if they even fit. Crossing fingers.
