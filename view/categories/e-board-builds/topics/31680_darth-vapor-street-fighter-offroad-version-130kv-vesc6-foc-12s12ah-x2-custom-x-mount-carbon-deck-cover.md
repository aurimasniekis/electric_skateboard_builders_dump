_save for OffRoad version_ ;) 


----------

Some fresh news about it : 

passed from 10s5Ah to 12s12Ah
test seens end of august, 1st with same ratio than the street setup 11x36T - 3.27:1 ratio
+55kmh, it's a little monster
Then tried yesterday with 11 x 42T - 3.82:1 :smile:  
Even better, bigger acceleration, setup keep a really good vmax more than 45kmh allmost 50 (too mutch for me, dont need it).
But always need more power now in offroad for better capacity in uphill...

I will continu testing, this month I want test again my crazy powerfull ratio of the 1st proto = 9x42T = 4.67:1 :smiling_imp: (vmax nearly 45kmh max) should be really perfect !

Yes, that is a good luck :smile: I have draw this mount 1 year and alf ago and it was for VESC 4.XX more slim, but finaly yes it was a real surprise ... Im pretty lucky with it :blush: A chance that my decoration bars was still at the good dimension and spacing too !

Hey eriderz !

Always in the rescherche of the perfect setup under my feet ... I continu testing, voltage, ratio ...
After some rides now in 12s, wow the little beast is totally crazy now !.. With this setup (orginaly in 10s for the strret version - 11x36T - 3.27:1 - vmax = 55kmh) got way to mutch topspeed !
Now I really need more torque and start power (like my 1st proto 2017 - 9 x 42T - ratio 4.67 look needed agin).

So I run a new test yesterday (I always got the 42T with the good chain lenght), so 11 x 42T - ratio 3.82:1 - a lot more fun (I also put 60 MMC - 55 BMC) vmax calculed 45kmh, ridedat about 40 kmh, once again not needed, so plan to retest soon the 9T sprocket for the 9 x 42T setup !

https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_20170925_173820l.jpg

No finish yet durung the test, I will make a top cover,.. and watter/dust-proof this VESC6 box ... but don't now how to procede for this one this time (resin FG/CF ... shape of the molding ... will see).

https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_20170925_lll.jpg

Good ride all !

Nice build. Is that 12s pack not 12s1p 6Ah though? 
Looking at constructing some longer ranger 12s or 10s packs myself, but 1p is limited in that regard.

Have you tracked your max range yet?

Hey, thanks @telnoi ! No it's a 2x6s lipo graphene pack, it make 12s 12Ah 1p 15c (around 180amps max continious, 30c brusht I guess ...)

Was looking for a liion cell pack too, but the price of this pack (around 180€ with shipping and custom) convinced me in addition to all the good returns on graphene. Hope there is an other destock like this soon to twice the range (with one in the backpack).

No max range yet, saturday (when passing in FOC mode, thanks @Pimousse ) I make a super cool 1st ride ride with some esk8squadfr riders and WOOOW !!! 
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_20170930_181725l.jpg
Hard to tell how much I love it ... the change BLDC/FOC is so MASSiiiiVE ! I'm so happy to have try it mode by mode, step by step seen bldc, parameter by parameter and finaly come to this amazing FOC mode. A BiG BiG BiG Up again to Benjamin for all the work made and Trampa for the support of this gorgeous product !

So, the ride : 19km (cause of the night and I got no light and some others too...shame) - 16Wh/km (around 0.44Ah/km) - 8400mah recharge in the pack (in 1h @ 0.9C - 4.15v/cell) - max fets temps 30°C - motor max 110Amps - bat max 62 amps - vmax 45kmh by night in the little trail.
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_20170930_201021l.jpg
Like that, we could estimate more than 25 km cool off road - 30 km eco street mode. And real offroad terrain ... we never know :sweat_smile:
I will try a full range soon, but I never ride eco mode :smile: 

Now I see I got to finish this proto :blush: need to make my lipo box (or a 409 Dry Box) and waterproof the vesc6 case (pass them in the back of the deck in a 206 Ultrabox) ... the poor little ones, I must take care nevertheless : 
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_20171001_141138l.jpg

I take all your advices and suggestion for case, water/dust-proof and strong box for a big lipo pack and v6 case :grin:

Hey e-riderz !

So, I'm playing it Squad design :blush:
[409 Dry Box](http://www.uwkinetics.com/products/409-dry-box#.WdYEtlu0Opp)  on the way.
And I think 206 on the back ...

Lets go for a more secured and water/dust-proof version !
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_20171003_182206l.jpg?w=720
And a clean up !

https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_20171004_135436l.jpg
with a little more (for the new 4.667 : 1 ratio)
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_20171004_132545l.jpg

Also have the 206 lying around, but wondering if I should cut out part of the top and essentially attach the VESCs to the bottom of the lid to allow for airflow. What are your thoughts on that?

Hey thanks !
Yes I see you mean like this :
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_20171004_135422l.jpg
With the telemetry lifts made from VESC Monitor and VDLA, VESC not exceeding 32 ° C,.. I have margin especially with the seasons to come (it is already much cooler besides!). Or really made it like Squad did perfectly :stuck_out_tongue: for maximaning it, but actualy it's not a priority,.. winter is coming ! (I keep that for spring/summer 2018 :blush: but hope to finish an other and closed V6 Box Xmounted !)  

But firstly I think I will put them at the bottom of the box, simply, with 2mm of bushing... (better will explain better if I got time tomorow !

Hey, really nice work here! Been following along for some time now. Glad to see the new vescs fit the 206 box (I was hoping they would). 

Do you know if we need to add cooling fans or capacitors?
```

---
## \#21 Posted by: Pimousse Posted at: 2017-10-06T06:58:12.365Z Reads: 348

```
If I may answer for him : no for both.
We ride pretty the same setup, and I even push it further going high uphill (resulting in 37Wh/km) without exceeding 50°C !
And no fan, only passive cooling (both VESC are screwed to a carbon fiber plate with additional thermal paste between VESC case and CF plate).
And for capacitor, even in FOC, it runs flawlessly with genuine built-in cap. ;)
```

---
## \#22 Posted by: telnoi Posted at: 2017-10-06T07:14:23.552Z Reads: 314

```
since you are talking about a CF plate, I guess you have not mounted the VESC inside a 206 box?
```

---
## \#23 Posted by: Pimousse Posted at: 2017-10-06T07:18:59.514Z Reads: 304

```
No, it's a custom box with CF plate and 3D-printed cover.
If you really want to improve cooling, I would suggest to drill squares in the box, just under the VESC6 case to let them being in contact with fresh air. It will be far enough to cool them. ;)
```

mounting them upside down would indeed be smarter/a bit more splash proof and you don't see the ugly cuts...
Good thinking :slight_smile:
That's what I'll do.

I recently redid wiring in my electronics case, so now it’s neat and clean (earlier it was such a mess I had to help myself close the case with my knee ;) ). Used black sugru to seal everything and even put silicone cover on the light switch, and orings on my loop key. If I’d put a little bit more effort in sealing the holes where wires enter, it would be waterproof and fully submersible :D

Many thanks for your feedback and your tips Squad !!
Oring on a key loop ? You mean like a XT90s ?! Thats interest me :smile:
 
I will try to do my best inspired by all of you ;) 

https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/rps20171008_013305_01.jpg?w=720
Lipos in the box ! I have some finition to do but I'm in the good way I guess, everything fit perfectly.
Like you say, now I will play with sugru and hot glue !
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/rps20171008_013245_01.jpg?w=640
Got 2 holes in the Drybox 409 (XT90s and general + & - ) and 4 in the little 206 Ultrabox (+ & - of itch vesc in the back, and motor phases + sensor in the front) :
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/rps20171008_013400.jpg?w=640

Thanks again to Ben ... this VESC6 under FOC is the best feeling I have ever have on an esk8 or emtb !!

Around 50km more this week, plus a rainning run !! Dust/splash-proof passed the test. All still all good.
 V6 FW3.28 - FOC - 130kv - ratio 4.67:1 - 12s12Ah - 9" tires, is my perfect offroad setup actualy ! More than 30km (approx) full range ... I'm always dead before her !

What clothing u wear? Mentioning rain i always hate how fast the shoes / trousers get when riding in wet..

I thought about ordering bahilas (covers for legs) or just finally rigging up detachable mud guards

Nothing special and it was a shame anyway ! When I left it was not raining again :smile: ... and yes it was a bit troublesome, I was wet until the protections !!
Now for this I will maybe wear my motorcycle pants and for sure my waterproof hiking shoes. I am used to riding underwater in the mtb.

Now priority to the lighting, I still have to mount my LED bar front and back, plus add a brake stop light (and an other addon that @Pimousse  give me and made tuto on esk8.fr) :blush: there I'm starting a little more in the unknown !

And a clean up again :sweat_smile:
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_20171025_190747l.jpg?w=720

Plus a tcheck up, I got my slave motor who no longuer responds some time ... (about 1 time every 10 ride).
I used to trun it OFF and turn ON again and its all good, but last time it doesn't work anymore. 1h hour later at home, no problem all good !?!?
Itch time VESC led are good (bleu) and nothing seams to trouble the setup ... but I will follow Pimousse advices and controle the can wires and everything else during this big clean up.

Your board is nice props dude but I don't think calling it a custom cf deck is right maybe a customised deck really not trying to piss on your parade at all looks nice
[/quote]
haha yeah, thx man ! ... I dont really see the difference and no matter :blush: custom cf deck / custom deck ... Maybe **cf custom deck** is the right thing
you have to call a cat a cat :smiley_cat: (I don't really know if this expression exists in English... )

Just for the story, its not just for the look. The original Scrub wooden deck was too flex, so I reinforce it by sandwitch it in carbon fiber.

See my GF test it :

No I fully understand iv made customised decks and fully custom decks cf wise. alot more tooling go's into fully custom to get strength and not have the deck delaminate. customised would mean u have taken an already usable deck and altered it I.e made it stiffer  (not knocking it iv just done the same) I read this looking for how u made the deck not covered or skimmed a deck. I know I sound like a dick really not trying to be. yer we have somthing similar sating wise we say call a spade a spade

 Today I'm looking to (for the 4th or 5th time), the positioning of the strap foot ... I almost got a holypro like :smile:
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_20170827_173634.jpg?w=500

 My deck is really long 98cm tips to tips - 100cm/40" wheelbase
with long crease to tip is 18/20cm hard to tell with the big round angle of curvature ...
So here is the issue, I can't get the stance I want for my 1m95.
I got 60cm between itch opposite strap foot. would like 10cm more but the baseplate of the L Bracket start to be on the curvature of the long crease to tip ... arrrrg The leader strap part is really unconfortable during long ride 
And can't do anything I guess... plus my foot are far from the trucks and it feel not enought "precise control"

2nd issue, when I approach 35/40kmh the setup start to wooble a bit and if I don't engage long carve its worst !!
The setup feels really different seen Im on 9". The deck balance a lot easier (and more it feels... maybe my gravity center rise...).
What do you think guys about it ?

3st pb (I guess), my crease to tip got only around 20° angle, so the vertigo aren't in the optimised position. But it should improved control, setup should tunr better right ? But maybe also staility ?

I haven't this pb on the 8" street fighter version, its why I plot :cold_sweat:

This afternoon I will play with  SPRING ADJUSTER to see, and try some other modification (reduicing the wheelbase a bit, scherch the best foot position the most comfortable possible, add angled riser ... etc.)

Interesting. Are you also using the scrub trucks? If so, what is your opinion on these? A heck of allot cheaper than mbs or trampa trucks.

Looking to replace some B Grade trucks with something a bit more stable.

What batteries did You use to get over 1kWh? I’m looking around for something that could provide me with more range, last time me and Idea rode together off-road my 12S10Ah battery allowed me to travel about 18km, thought for a while about 12S8P liion pack but it probably wouldn’t fit in my battery box without modding or changing it. For now I’m looking at turnigy multistar 6S16Ah bricks and wondering if they would perform good or not, their price is tempting...

:smile: yeah it was exactly my little problem !
With 2x6S12Ah15c graphene it works fine (something like you 20km range) so I buy 2 more for the backpack.
The setup is at his maximum weight imo. And I actualy get a fully garage/workshop in my backpack (to besure to alway finish the ride). I will make some place for this 2 new babies !!
So got 4x6s12Ah15c / 12s 24Ah 30c if I really want some time (Its easy to add them on the top of the central box).
And I also got small one actually, in case for training at a spot and want a lightweight setup : 
 4 x 6s 8Ah 15c Graphene too = 12s 16Ah 30c
I dont know if I keep them but I think its good to have too (I can have different weighted setup 12s8Ah, or 12s12Ah that I know well now, 12s24Ah easy with backpack or 12s40Ah for long WE multiride but ...HMG that weight in the back ... 

So grand total of **1776 Wh** if I really really want :blush: around 80km !?!? :P

[quote="Riako, post:63, topic:31680"]
So got 4x6s12Ah15c / 12s 24Ah 30c
[/quote]

The discharge rating of cells stays the same no matter how You connect them, they still can provide 15C BUT if You connect two 12Ah packs parallel, it's 15 times new capacity which is 24Ah, so 360A instead of 180 (which in any case is more than enough ;) )

But holy f*** 80kms, that's impressive :D I'm more and more leaning toward buying those multistars, if they won't sag that much (they shouldn't, even with their 10C rating it's 160A continous discharge, and I never saw currents exceed like 80-90A burst), they would be really nice long range batteries.

Yes I could connect my 2 x 12s12Ah pack in // for a crazy lipo pack ( but with the weight its will be more for long cool ride hiking...and after I forget the jumps :smile: )
Yes, I thinks 160A its fine and for the price and cool long ride like you say it should work fine ... I'm with 180A like you know (I'm with 60amps batt max and 70 motor max actually) and its fine not hot in the closed Drybox, I saw around 70amps batt max in ackmaniac/VDLA ...

Hey hey hey e-riders !

Finally back in the Darth adventure, but 1st want to thank you all for your sharing, inspiration, and motivation !!
Particularly @Pimousse & @Yann that I annoy very regularly and always the heart on the hand full of good advice and Squad, @Der6FingerJo, @stewii,  @Idea, @LukePL, @Nowind, @DanSkates, @Kug3lis, @longhairedboy (sorry 10 names max ...) ESK8-FR  **and all of you once again for all the good things, words and advice sharing on this forum !**
(Also thanks to okp and fottaz for another build that I'm making for Zigm4 that he will show you soon :blush: )

Now that I'm making another little training eATB (**I target less than 10 kilos**), not as powerful as the Darth but as long as it rolls, I have work to at least pretend to do mini jumps !
So I really want to let go of the aesthetics of this setup ... we will see where I could go ...

the Darth is in pieces. Here is what happened to the deck :sweat_smile: : 
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_20180125_234244.jpg?w=720
 
So, I start to remake a DIY enclosure 3D print then layered : 
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/rps20180305_201541.jpg?w=720

Now a lot of work is waiting for me and I can not wait to re-ride again so, we'll have to move my ass now !!!

to be continued ...

Thanks Dan ! Yes me too :star_struck:
(but, no evolution on the hearth of the board > the amazing VESC6 + Overion transmission and 6374 130kv + 12s Graphene is my perfect combo for now.)

But I would like to innovate and try something different just right. I take all the advice and ideas, what will be an evolution for you ? :blush:

[/quote]

agreed, can't top that right now! VESC 6 really is completing mountainboards.

What i would really like to see is a sick ass looking enclosure for batteries on top of a mtb deck. Right now i only like the Lipos without anything on them because ultraboxes just look so clunky. I originally wanted to print something but i doubt that it would hold up when made out of PLA, and anything else would take really long and get expensive.

Anyways, can't wait to hear about all your upcoming projects mate!

That would be better than PLA. But i'm not sure about PETG in general , the Benchys i printed with PETG are really stiff and strong, much more so than the pla's, but i got the feeling that my petg motor mounts flexed more than the pla ones.

WOW - your board has some seriously nice electrics dude!  I'm hoping to upgrade to some of these components in the future.

The evolution for me is going to be my riding - I wanna go faster, jump higher and spin more! :crazy_face:  Btw...finally got round to editing my video and just added it to my thread - check it out!

Don't really know if we could call it like that :smile: it's absolutely not optimized for space saving or other thing but I want a funny and more out of the ordinary case. So that's it :

@TheFluffiest just the actual setup cost me around 1700€ ... the all seens 2015 I didn't (would) know :blush:  

@DanSkates it's an idea too, real wraping ! Whitpony did it under is custom vanguard. Could look/be good too

I move slowly on the enclosure, I have print the top, the bottow follow next WE.
I had 20° riser to the Vertigo trucks :smile: it's amazing of change, both visual - and ride I think !! It allows me to catch the lost height during the shortening of the wheelbase (also its design to work on 35° deck and I got around 15/20°, it should turn better now ... cant wait to ride again !! :sweat_smile:)

I threw all the old wiring in bulk, on the deck to finally ride again :sunny:
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_20180511_154312.jpg
Deck and Wheelbase are shorter
I add around 20° more to the Vertigo angle and the change is amazing !

Big Up for all  !!!

a small step is done... a lot more to come ... : 

I cant access screw compression trucks - bad between two activity offroad/street slalom
I have more than 38° mounting angle - so I compress to much the trucks
Put back 8" wheels
Insert LED between darthvapor bumber front and rear
upgrade v6 fw to put off NRF (thx Pimousse for this input !)
upgrade the old one with new metr.pro 
.... manage cable one day ...

Also, got an announcement to make...
Because improvement seams to mean a new deck for me ... :hushed: and this name was given cause of the custom carbonification of it, I think it will be a goodbye for the Darth Vapor :pray:

But all this crazy perfect setup 6374 130kv + VESC6 + 12s12Ah + gt2b will stay the same ;P

Yes ! 1st was the rear one, now the front, like it's not just deco, it protects the trucks a bit :sweat_smile:
But this one comes from JohnStealPro laser cut in 4mm light ALU... I think I will make them stronger but not too much either to keeping them absorbing chocks.
But the following gonna be a little bit different !..

~~It~~ she is still the same pretty sexy good looking old lady :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
My 1st MTBoard deck, Scrub Furnace Creek series 2, carbon fiber sandwiched customization.

She must be at her 3rd or 4th surgical intervention (of the deck), and like I still don't know what to do in the future, witch deck to use or make ...

And as I'm already like +6 month late on my next e-MTBoard setup, and I just received the "last" piece of the drive I have to quickly custom her again!

So, **the Darth Vapor is back !!!**

I have reached almost 40km on road (on 9"), and under 20 to around 25km off road... of course.

I'm quickly making a MadBox, not heatsinked in a 1st time, to get only two wires (instead of 8) from the center of the deck to the back, for now (passing by the strap-foot).
In the future, I plan to put all in the center to get only one (big) box I guess... But I guess it will be done on the next deck, this one is too short (thinking about the last Dylan ... how it feels @topcloud ? ).

More to come :v:

Okay !

 I basically finish the setup, I put my protection, I'm preparing to go out :star_struck:  
 **and there during the test empty ...**  
**I realize that there is a loud problem! ..** :sweat:

https://youtu.be/FyVb4_MUCuQ

I have yet done the programming (vesctool 0.94), as usual, and everything is normally and well spent (Wizard, FOC, sensored ... ppm etc. canbus ...).

**But** it looks like ... I do not know hell, the more I put the gas over it cog and vibrates with **crazy** sounds. I never saw that before. Did this happen to someone?

I only change the motor on my last setup (and le drive system, but the drives works well when tested empty), and place the VESCs in the center now, nothing crazy (just add 20cm of extension wire and the 60cm sensor wire extension). :face_with_monocle:

So ... :

1. I'm going to redo the extensions phases wires I guess (as they were a bit too short anyway)

 2. all recheck at the welds and connections.

3. As well as update to the penultimate version.

And,.. I will see. 

4. Then, the last solution, to put the VESC back again (top of the motors ... ), but I do not see why it would walk again and not there ?!

During this time, it is a beautiful WE, with +20°C outside (almost +25°C exposed) and I just can pedaling on my bike :sweat_smile:

Hi e-riders !

Ok, so! After this little adventure, I proceeded to debug and change extension wires (with longer), new fw (3.40), and I was able to finally try this madness, but very / too short (just a few kilometers for testing)!
![IMG_20190402_160908|690x388](upload://f11ncVnw6BbjbpfTwYALS8gWc3m.jpeg) 

Very quiet (and short so) little test ride yesterday (yes, the video is a little useless, but I was too happy to finally ride mini 1: 5 MBS M2 extra large! :crazy_face:)

And, a longer ride tonight :blush: so peaceful !! (it's been 8 months without riding a monster :smile:).  
I will show you more tomorrow :v:

I have done maybe 15/20km totally ...  :persevere: so much frustration, and I still not try it in OffRoad.   
Now, the magnet (the one vibrating at 1st) is definitely loose!! I can hear it grinding the stator. So I have to stop riding yesterday.

One week later my 1st mail, I get an email from FlipSky telling me that they will come to me soon ...

Then, Friday, I got an email telling me something like :  
"where did you get them? we do not sell 6380 motors."

Ok, they beleave me now :blush:
They ask me to open it to see if it's not a bearing or a loose magnet : 

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pic_00365-6.jpg 

In fact, they are all loose, I can move them individually :no_mouth:

If you compare a 2018 motor (FS) with my 1st one from 2013 (on the left), it's day and night : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pic_00460-5.jpg

On the old APS, all magnets are resined/glued on the rotor with retaining ring both side, pretty clean (as the Maytech).

Also, I was modeling wedges for the corners of the central box, and I think I'll try to get the vesc out. It's not that practical in the covercles, every time I want to open it.  
So I mod something like this (maybe with the heatsink inside) :

But I'm glad it affect you like me !! ;P 

About the new MadBox, vertically, a front panel heatsink will looks so cool ... but then, it's a pain in @ss to access to the vesc.  
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/fkykvlk.png
I will definitely let the heatsink/holder "inside" so.

This is what I was thinking about :

**I try** patiently to take care while waiting for a return of FS following their request for photo motor open, following their request, more than a week ago ... since, it is again the complete radio silence!   
Each message, I must wait more than a week to hope an answer,.. it is really very painful and frustrating ... (!!!)

Well, I will set other older motors laying around I guess ^^ (except that I have to make custom shaft for the Geared Drive). 

I also received the extender (link shared by @banjaxxed ) but I make a mistake, it's not the same step screw, I didn't pay attention to that :sweat_smile: sh!t   (plus the bearing didn't fit right on it)  
It was a so cool solution to make this MBS Gear Drive compatible with 9" !.. (Maybe they exist in the same step or we should order some specific one ?)  
Others solution is to buy Megastar and new e-toxx adaptor (... around 4/500€ ...)  
Maybe 8" is finally fine :joy::rofl:... no,:no_mouth:, I would not give up there !

And make new axle, for the hanger, sound also maybe to much to solve the issue.

Fucks Sake?


Oh nooooo are you tell me the pitch is wrong? I haven't gotten mine yet

The pitch on 12mm trucks for both Trampa and MBS should be 1.75 afaik...the wide pitch

We could get someone to run up some adaptors with the correct pitch..

Or get plain tube bored to smaller size and tap it yourself?

^^ Flipsky.

Yes, sorry, pitch (! not step :sweat_smile:) isn't the same ... I guess ...
Idk if it's because I can screw it well by hand or if it's the pitch. But it doesn't seam easy.
! Maybe with a m10 screw on the other side the help "screwing" (I will try if I find some).

Also the bearing didn't fit too ^^ maybe they have to be pressed.

don't force it! In fact stop trying altogether, the pitch on those adaptors is 1.75mm (coarse). 

I 've taken a closer look..I think the pitch is 1.5mm on M12 mountainboard trucks?
@mbs @trampa  would that be true?

..and sorry. I guess I should have confirmed but was excited to share a possible workaround

[quote="Riako, post:117, topic:31680"]

[/quote]

Probably it is not designed to be used in this way, so 15mm would be a ballpark figure rather than machined to within 0.01mm tolerance, I am not sure on the caliper-measured size, but probably they could be spun on a drill to fit...but no point if they are the wrong pitch

The stock extender is

15m OD, total length 41.5mm including hex end

From the plain end of the extender -
* 11.6mm smooth bore, 17.5mm length >
* 7/16"  20TPI NF threaded 13.5mm length >
* 10mm 1.5mm pitch grub screw hole, 10.5mm length

If the 7/16 part was 5-6mm longer, this would be perfect. The hex on the end is not completely necessary, it can be replaced with a bolt to keep the hub on & reduce machining cost/hassle.

Maybe steel spacers with M8 hole in 15mm OD like this

https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/M8-Clearance-316-A4-Stainless-Steel-15mm-O-D-spacer-sleeve-PICK-LENGTH/282625428732?hash=item41cdc9ccfc:m:m-3_0IN-7KH0hX2i_zzHDHA

Drill it 36mm in with a 25/64" bit (cobalt) like this
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/25-64-9-92mm-HSSCo8-COBALT-HEAVY-DUTY-JOBBER-DRILL-EUROPA-TOOL-OSBORN-R24/272528897786?hash=item3f73fcf6fa:g:cLEAAOSwEetV-W38&amp;frcectupt=true

And tap it with a 7/16 20TPI UNF tap
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/UNC-UNF-Unified-Tungsten-Hardened-Tap-1-4-5-16-3-8-7-16-1-2-9-16-5-8-3-4-7-8-1/261765735027?var=560640297507

Come in from the other side with a M10 drill bit and tap for the bolt

I do not think €4/500 is the way forward. No plans to buy myself out of this with Megastars and Trampa adaptors either (I hope!)

Sorry @Riako last spam on your build thread ... maybe it’s easier than that, simply get someone to lathe off the hex on the stock extender, instant extra 6mm, then use M10 bolt in place of the grub

Thanks Rey..I thought of you instantly!

Maybe I aught to get off Riako’s build thread..

You can see the hex above on my added picture, a simple removal of the hex, not parting but facing it down to 15mm like the rest...or maybe even leaving 1.5mm on the end to help hold the hub on

hence shaving Jensos 🥜  Sorry I have an incurable love of bad humor

Please DM me if you can fit it in, I’m sure Riako would also like to try

Exactly, 4.5mm of hex gone means extra 4.5mm of extender threaded onto the axle taking us out of the danger zone

We can thread in a M10 bolt with a big head instead of a grub to meet the end of the axle which provides rigidity

Besides that, I'm still dying trying to communicate with FlipSky ...   
it is exceptional how they do it!    
When you're preparing an order, you speak to one person, who perfectly understand all your meaning etc.  
When you have paid and got a problem, they make you go round in circles, with 4 different interlocutors who never read the history, and intentionally understand nothing and make you lose 2 weeks of deadlines almost voluntarily ...   
I think they try voluntarily, to give up all after sales service. They could almost succeed, if these motors were not brand new!!..
