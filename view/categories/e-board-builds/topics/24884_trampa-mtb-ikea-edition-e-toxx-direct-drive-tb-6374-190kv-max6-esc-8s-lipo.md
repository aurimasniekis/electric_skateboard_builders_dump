I wasn't going to post a buildthread, but i figured Swedens first trampa should have a thread üòé

This is my first DIY e-board, I currently ride a Carbon GT which was starting to become a bit boring and after reading this forum for a couple of months I decided to go with the Trampa.

Board - Trampa Holypro 35 / Vertigo Trucks / Superstar wheels / Green dampas

Drivetrain - Torqueboards 6374 190kv / E-TOXX Direct drive 

Electronics - 2x MAX6 ESC / 4x Gensace 4000mah 60c / Torqueboards ON/OFF switch with antispark / 2.4ghz mini-remote with reciever

The Trampa arrived

And the batteries also, Gensace 4000mah 120c max discharge.

The motor has to be modified to be able to work with the direct drive.

The shaft has to be shortened and the pulley aswell.

Because of the modification of the gear the setscrew was removed and I used Loctite 638 to fix it to the motorshaft.

Countersunk the screws to be able to mount the ESC and Traxxas enclosure on top.

The B&W type 500 was a good fit for the batteries.

Exhanged the connectors on the batteries for XT90s

Mounted the ESCs and the Traxxas Box with duotech cardboard tape.

And that's how far I've gotten so far, waiting for some XT90 connectors for Parallel and serial connection of the batteries. I should be up and running in two weeks. üòúüòé

How is that pulley fixed to the motor shaft without any set screw and only loctite. I hope i misunderstood that...

Only loctite, the 638 is industrial stuff made for retaining things like bearings and such to motorshafts. 

And also, @Nowind said screws are for pussies.. üòâ

Haha IKEA build is big Fun :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Yeah i was not aware of this kind of Motordesign with this 10mm/8mm Motorshaft... will inform customers in the future about this complication

Yes i glue my pulleys most time with this Loctide stuff only... i go with Loctide 603
As far as i know these guys use Loctide only too :

Very nice and clean looking. Also eyeballing that E-TOXX drivetrain now :sweat_smile:

Do you have any idea what the topspeed/range will be?
```

## \#7 Posted by: sMATTEr Posted at: 2017-06-08T18:29:55.988Z Reads: 382

```
For future reference, the Loctite 603 and 638 is pretty much the same. 638 is a bit thicker and more sensitive to contamination such as oil when it's applied but works on a wider gap span.

@Yecrtz You should get it, the build quality is excellent and Jens has great support if you need it. And it looks awesome üòé

I have no idea what the range will be, this is a 8S2P configuration and not really made for range. I'm hoping to get 30 minutes of hard offroading. Haven't calculated the top speed but probably 35-40km/h.

Wow that is crazy never heard of only loctite. 
I wouldnt trust it not to spin around the shaft with so much torque on my mountainboard.
I feel better with set screws and loctite together. 

@sMATTEr  I have plenty of broken motors who's stator came loose from its press fitting with loctite.
They never last long. The only motors i have still alive are sk3 because they have 3 screws holding the stator from spinning.

@Nowind  have you marked the shaft and pulley and checked if it moves even a little after a ride?

You are ofcourse right, I would also use a setscrew and Loctite but because of the weird motor design this was the solution I chose. I'll mark the pulley and gear up and see if it moves after the first ride.

They are two options with Loctide only : 
1: its fixed and will not move
2: its loose
from my expierence nothing between

As i told you if you got any problems with Loctide only i make you some pulleys with the Setscrews between the thooth...

No problem at all (-;

It's aliiive! 

Couldn't get the remote to pair to the reciever though, probably made some rookie mistake, will make some extensive research and try again üôÑüòâ

Edit: Just watched dexters video on how to bind the remote, missed to turn the remote on/off when pairing üôÑ

Got everything running, I'm gonna add some mesh and shrink to the cables running to the motors and re-do the wiring from the esc, looks a bit sloppy.

Other than that, it's a monster. My Carbon GT is a toy compared üòé

And also shoutout to @nowind for hooking me up with special gears made for the motor. With keyway and setscrew. That's customer service üëçüèªüí™üèª

Went over a small hump full throttle, all my weight got on the backwheels, went into a slide and flew off. Cracked the helmet (Ruroc helmet) and broke the mouth/face protection.

Going for a x-ray tomorrow, will probably be fine. But this got me thinking üò≥

Sorry to hear it really nice job on the build think everyone tends to see the 12S dual motor setup and think that full power and speed is the best way to go, really depends on the rider and experience and all.  Personally run a single motor 10S 149kv with 83mm wheels (waiting on those 107s) but top speed currently at 21mph is way too fast to ride safely.  Solution don't push it faster than you can run off it if you don't have to, still nice to go kicking speeds without kicking if you change your mindset a bit (of course depends on if you're building a thrill ride or a commuter board).  Still understand crashes are scary glad you had gear on to save your brain and face, good luck selling the setup it's a pretty good deal (basically free labor)

@Cobber

Yeah, a great helmet for sure. Thanks dude! 

@wafflejock

Yeah I probably rode it over my ability, but when that speed demon get's a hold, all bets are off üòÄ With the bindings you are kinda screwed, there's no running anywhere üòâ

Maybe I jumped the gun. Need a couple of weeks to heal and think it over.

Yes makes sense with the Ruroc, only helmets apear on my google search.
Glad you wear that protectives, a hard wipe out can scare the hell out of you....
Maybe you will change your mind (and wifes too) and be glad not to sold your Board at this point ?!
But of course this is your desicion... price is good !

Hope x-ray shows no complications...
Get well soon Dude

Not for sale anymore. Got a small crack in my tailbone, will probably make a full recovery so I'm keeping the board.

I might be 30+ years but I won't become a old boring grumpy dude just yet üòÑ
