everyone recommends going for a VESC rather than a cheap ESC due to the fact that they offer increased performance and from what I have read folks seem to be replacing cheaper ESCs as they fail quickly so it is a false economy. I went for a FOCBOX VESC as they have a good reputation for quality and reliability.

The Turnigy motor mounts look to be a good deal but so far I haven't seen any real world reports on their performance/quality so they could turn out to be unreliable, only time will tell.

What are you planning on using the 4mm Bullet Series cable for? The batteries use XT60s connectors...

I went for similar batteries to you, but went for the flightmax as they seem to have a good reputation: 
ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 4S1P 20C (4.0mm Bullet Connector)	[https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-4s1p-20c.html](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-4s1p-20c.html)

Don't use boat esc. Brakes are terrible. Get vesc or for example x-car beast.

I would suggest a different pulley kit as I brought a similar one and all it has done is give me headaches the do not work very well unless you want to do some diy and re drill the hold and drill your trucks to stop the mount from slipping

Do not build as cheap as possible. Wait until you can use quality parts for the build. If you attempt to build cheap you will end up spending more replacing parts than you would have spent on a quality board to begin with.

What else do I need to change? I do not understand, what cables do I need?
Please explain it to me simply.
And thank you for all your help
And the wheels I gave if you connect to the DIY Parts Pulleys

St first read a LOT. And then read some more.  I recommed to read other projects so you know what to do and you don't have to ask all those basic questions.
