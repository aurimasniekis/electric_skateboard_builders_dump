Hi everyone! 
I would like to ask some help with my build.... at the moment I have:

-  120Amp 2-7S BEC

- 1 x 50mm motor, 270KV, 2200watt, 60Amp, 50mmx65mm, 8mm shaft, 9t, complete of 3mm keyway on the shaft to fit pulley or sprocket.

- 6S 6300mah 35C flat battery

And here is what I plan to buy in the next few days, I would really appreciate a feedback:

**RECEIVER:**
I need a 2.4ghz one and tI will go for the flysky gt2 with the idea to move it in a custom 3d printed case after a while. the question is, ORANGE or SILVER ? What are the differences ?

**TRUCKS**
My motor mount if for Caliber II and I am thinking about ordering this:

I am unsure about the size: 184mm or 158mm ? They will both work or do you think one is better than the other?

**WHEELS**
My Wheel Hub drive adapter is made for kegels so I would like to buy these:

**DECK**
Before I buy a new one I will try to fit everything in this one:
Dusters Keen V-Ply Cruiser - 8.25" x 31"

**ANYTHING ELSE?**
