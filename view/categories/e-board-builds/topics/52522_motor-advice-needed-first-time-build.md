Good and powerfull Motor. You cannot make much wrong with it! Just Keep in mind that this is not for a light build

For a much lower price you can get the Keda 190kV. They are great motors and I run 3 motors by Keda. They are also super tough, my mate accidentally rammed the motors into a concrete block at about 30-40km/h

The keda is 2000W the turnigy is 2450W

The keda has stiff wires and a shorter shaft. 
the turigy comes with bullets on them and has a more flexy wire.

but the Keda is cheaper and maybe you wan't to save a bit here spend a bit more on a good vesc.

I used Keda with 12mm motor pulley and it was ok :) The shaft was not going through the whole pulley, it was bit shirt, but it worked well :) 

You can buy longer shaft and replace it, but you have to make sure you put the motor back together correctly :) 

SK3 motors are more often used than KEDA, their quality is really good :)

260 kv is probably to small or will it pull?

at 10s, 260 will work. but dont expect to have strong brake. u need at least 2 of them to stop safely. also u waste rpm at top end as vesc need limit erpm 60k + alpha

Really nice deck. I would choose anothet VESC for FOC. FOCBOX or VESC6 are the most rated ones for FOC. Actually a guy from the forum is running FOC with the HK VESC (hardware 4.12) without problem. That being said the others two are made for it.

Would a dual setup on 8s be what I'm looking for up hill climb?

I would really dont cheap out on Motors. I would get some Motors below 200kv and try to go 12s or 10s
