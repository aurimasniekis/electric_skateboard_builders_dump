So as parts are starting to come together I think its time to start the build log :blush:

So far this has arrived:

- Loaded Vanguard Flex 2 -> trimmed down to Flex 3 size
- 40x LG INR 25 for a 10s4p from nkon.nl - DIY Spotwelder @whitepony style
- FS-GT2B mod into a Sparkle (OKP/Unik)
- Axle VESC 4.12
- 190KV Motor 6374
- Mean Well CLG-150-48a as a charger. Adjustable to 41v cutoff

Anti Spark Switch etc are on the way. The drive kit (wheels, trucks, pulleys,.. ) are from the group buy and should arrive soon. 

I designed the enclosures myself and will print them on my 3d-printer with PETG.

Following, cause I'll start building my board soon as well and would love to see the enclosures. I'm going to design my own, but these will need to fit two 5s 8000mAh lipo's. Board is about the same, mine is a clone tho.

Good luck!

Here are some I've been working on. They either fit a 6s4p or 4s4p+VESC. Height is between 25mm-30mm. With wall thickness of 5-6mm so they all have around 20mm-25mm of space inside in height. It'll make for a nice stealth thin enclosure. 

However the more I work on these the simpler I want to go... The more "aesthetics", curves and so on make it much bigger then it needs to be. I'll likely go for a printer friendly design.

Be careful with printing enclosures, you need your screws to go through the whole piece keeping the layers up to the deck. Otherwise because of vibrations it might break the enclosure.

@BooYA Mhmm I guess its trial and error. I'll have reasonable wall thickness on the parts and have it printed in ABS/PETG. 

The PETG just arrived. I'll have to reprint a GT2B mod. Either the sparkle or the mad/bad munkey/wolf. Any suggestions which one needs the least amount of soldering ? :D 

In the meantime my Anti Spark switch arrived. Iam not confident in my solder skills but I tried anyway... Hope I didnt fry anything :/ ... The little resistors took me 20 mins... 

I also got a JST 6Pin to connect to my hall sensor cable. I figured lets solder that too..

Cool enclosures and I'm with you just keep it simple. I'm still in doubt if I can put everything in one box or go for the 2 piece set up. The lipos are quite big, but it should be possible.

There are some members here that 3d print the enclosures and enforce them with some fiber glass on the inside. I want to make a small vacuum former and use the 3d print as a mold or might just use some wood as a mold.

As for the GT2B mods you mention, they both need the same amount of soldering. There are some other mods that don't need soldering but they are quite big. The only one that is good I hear is the MasterCho mod (don't think it need that much soldering), but those files are not shared.

Last tip is one for soldering wires together (for small wires you don't need to put another wire around it tho, but it's a good technique):

Cool video ! I guess I'll need to get a new solder iron before risking any sh°t solder joints... I guess a single enclosure is way easier to do. And if you keep it nice and streamlined it'll look quite good. Its just because of the flex that I have to go for the split enclosures. What board are you using ?
I'll reinforce them too. I'll think of a way to do that. Vacuum former + wood as a mold sounds good. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzda6x4buac
This guy had it done :) Looks good ! 

I'll stay with the sparkle mod. I have another one printing which is scaled up by 5% should add some clearance for small finicky stuff. And tomorrow will be the print day for either the VESC or Battery enclosure :)

I'll have to choose a charging plug and port. Can anyone recommend me sth ? Do I have to take caution regarding current/voltage ?

I was very lucky to buy a Weller soldering station for cheap from a colleague, they are quite expensive but I really see the difference in soldering. It got easier and more precise. Not saying you can't solder with anything other, but I'm very happy with it.

As for the board I'm using a chinese version of the vanguard, so that's why I doubt I can get everything in one box. I'm using two 5s 8000mAh lipos that are a bit bigger than I hoped, but should give me some decent miles. And I'm not able to really test the flex cause I'm waiting for my wheels from the EU group buy.

Can't help you with the power part. For me I think I'll be getting a 10s BMS and a charge port like you see on electric bicycles and buy a simple charger.

Good luck with printing, will you be able to print them in one piece?

Hi @TranxFu maybe you need to double check the anti spark doesn't look so reliable. If it fail a solder while you are running the skate will stop suddenly.  If you go fast is not nice. Overall looks good! I need a 3d printer too! :grin:
Edit: did you see the pulleys Cover junior potato did it for 3d print, they look so sweet!!

Small update on this build log:
10s4p: I've tried to get the spot welder to work the last few days. Mhmm.. It just doesnt want to :D .. Am tempted to go the mosfet route or get a thyristor..

Anybody in Germany who wants to spot weld my cells ? 
I might just get a really good solder iron and solder them. Lets see...

Remote: Sparkle mod is up and running. Just finished the remote.

Enclosure: Can't nail down the final enclosure design. Will do in a few days. Just want to print a single design since it takes up almost a whole roll of filament for one set of enclosures haha... 

Rest: Still awaiting parts from the group buy to actually starting the work on the deck.

@Surfer hehe I figured those solder spots look miserable ! Will redo them once I get a new soldering iron. Yea those pulley covers look really nice :) ! Might do my own. Don't think it'll take a lot of time.

So I just quickly finalized my Battery enclosure. I tried to get in as much design as possible but priority was a simple and small footprint and easy to handle design for the 3d printer.

And here is the first half printing atm. printing with 0.24 layer height since it'll get wrapped or painted anyway.

This is one half done ! I think it looks quite sleek :sunglasses: Don't worry about the concave. I can lay the part down on the heat bed at 110° a while to get it flexy and align it to the board.

I was not satisfied with the space used. I noticed I can go even slimmer :blush: when adding the numbers its 18,3 for the 18650 and I had 25mm of space in there. I trimmed it down to 22mm to leave some space for the heat shrink and some felt. I also tapered the edges so it sits flush with the board. Have a look(left one is remodeled):

Black PETG arrived. Printing for battery enclosure starts today. I did also come up with a logo which has my initials in it P.T. :wink: 

This one is 26mm in height. Hope it'll look super sleek and slim on the board.

Alright the enclosure is done printing. I've learned not to cheap out on filament... I just picked the cheapest PETG that was available in Germany at the moment... And it took me half a day to get "decent" results... 

Printed with 0.28 Layer height. I'm not fond of the finish. But after post-processing I think it'll look pretty good :) 
It also is pretty flexible and clamps down really nice to the concave of the board. 
Just because I'm lazy I might go for the same look on the VESC enclosure and just size it down a bit. 

Height is 26mm - 3.5mm shell. I think it looks super sleek :sunglasses:

It's a Prusa i3 clone(Anet A8). With a lot of tinkering, nerves and time upgrading parts you can get it to the level similar to the higher end printers. Iam pretty happy with it since it is my first 3d printer :) You also get to learn quite a lot of stuff since its a kit and you have to build it yourself. Quite cheap too.

But if you have the budget and want sth. that works out of the box perfectly I'd go with the Prusa i3 MK2. Keep in mind most 3D Printers have a built size of 220x220x220ish .

How long were they touching? Like split second (you notice as soon as you touched, and that's when you got the spark) or a little while later (after you'd done some soldering)

If they're in parallel, no. If there in series, just test the one cell you're worried about.

Mhmm.. Originally I wanted to go without BMS. But I guess that is one reason to get one now. Does the BMS balance the packs as a whole or does it balance each single cell in a pack ?

EDIT: I guess that was a stupid question. So it balances the whole pack to 4,2v and within the pack they balance each other out right ?

Yeah, split second will be totally fine. Just don't make a habit of it ;)

Most BMS's make sure that each series cell does differ from the other more than some small amount (some are more precise than others). Most do that just at the end of the charge phase. Each parallel cell in a series set will work itself out (I think that's what you were asking.

Allright. Thanks a lot guys. I just measured the packs today and got 3,51V for the usual voltage of all other packs and for the ones touching I had 3,49V & 3,50V. With the 2 single cells that were involved having 3,49V and 3,48V.

Yup thats what I wanted to know.

Looks like you have 25R cells - you don't actually need a BMS to charge them. I have run my 10S3P pack for 5 cycles now and checked them via balancing cables --> no drift. Whitepony does also not use a BMS and has much more cycles on his packs without any bad experiences.

Just noticed it says LG INR25 :D ... Yeah. I'm using 25R cells. I've planned to use them without a BMS too(also inspired by white pony). 
And just wire the balancer cables so I can use it later on if needed. Would you guys say the +-0,2 voltage that I stated above can be seen as harmless ? I'd still go the no BMS route if its alright.

the 0.2 difference will be eliminated once fully charged. You will not see a difference between the cells once fully charged (fully charged meaning you had a CV phase where the current dropped significantly to maybe 100-200mA)

Battery pack and second enclosure is done :) I heated it up and pressed it down to get it fit nicely to the concave. Its super flexible and strong. 

As stated above I had a small issue with the battery pack. Other than that the soldering process was easy peasy :D 100w soldering iron took max 2sec per cell. I doubled up on the isolating stickers. Got a video, mby I'll upload it when possible.

The main enclosure with the logo will get reprinted. I've updated it a bit and also got decent PETG filament this time.

Up next is getting the wire channels in there. I'll need my trucks to get the right distance and positioning for the enclosures before I can continue. Space will be super limited.. But I'll work that out somehow.

@willpark16 yep its 12awg copper braid. They should theoretically be able to carry up to 90amps continuous.  

Small update on the build. Board is almost finished. Sparkle mod is done. Got all parts 3d printed. Anti spark, LED switch, capacitor display, d/c charging plug,...
Everything is there except for a motor belt and a motor pulley. Also routed some cable paths onto the bottom. 

The only part that is holding me back from finishing this is getting everything packed onto the VESC enclosure. Space should be enough but I have yet to manage soldering the cable lengths correctly... 

Whitepony recommended me some wood inserts. Did not manage to get them in in a good angle. Will order bigger ones and swap them out. The enclosures have been padded from the bottom to ensure waterproofness.

Can anyone recommend me some good bushings ? 

EDIT:: anyone who is wondering if PETG is a good material for enclosures. **YES**! I've made some stress test with some failed prints and earlier versions. I have jumped on those and they did not crack or break.

Almost done :). Some upgrades were due.
Mounted some genuine caliber trucks and went for orangatang kegels. 

Also waterproofed the enclosure with rubber strips.

Push led button, d/c charger plug and capacity display.

It runs well. Will finish the details this weekend. To make it look even more sleek

those are quite big enclosures that come close to the center. is your flex not completely destroyed by them?

I've tried before and the flex is not restricted at all :)vice versa, the flex does not put any strain on the enclosures since they are split in 2 halves each. The 3mm thick butyl bands underneath each enclosure also helps adapt to the uneven board. 


I'll have some flex test photos up when I'm done with this build.

Some impressions, LED Push button, D/C Charging Plug and capacity display wired in. 

Still have to do fine-tune the aesthetics. Will cover the motor cables with wire mesh and vinyl wrap the bottom to hide the cable channel. 

I've been riding for 2-3 hours today. And wow :) Eboarding is just awesome... Did not manage to pull the full throttle haha... Will need to adjust the trucks and bushings... 

I'm very tempted to try FOC. @whitepony since you had almost the same setup (10s4p,VESC,single 6374,...) is there anything I should be cautious/aware of ? VESC HW is 4.12. Just run the procedure step for step with Vedders instructions ? Anything notable with your motor settings :) ? Would appreciate your knowledge.

Before going FOC, realise it is a risk it can ruin your drv, so more like, can you afford another Vesc or know anyone that could repair. Aswell as is it worth the risk of not being able to ride it for a while incase it goes wrong. 

I recently tried FOC with bad experience on a barely used(bldc for 10-20km no problems) 4.12 VESC from diy, on a 10s4p single build. Followed instructions and everything was checked to work perfectly fine before. Not sure what caused it. 

I got DRV errors and my vesc smellt burnt(somehow it still works on bldc however), And this was as I was doing the detection for values in FOC. But I had counted on that it may break my VESC so was not super suprised.

However alot if not most people I spoke to, has gone FOC without any issues. FOC seems amazing but dont forget the risks of using it, especially if you dont have warranty.

Great looking build btw!

Thanks ! The pulleys are @JuniorPotato93's design. Just type in longboard pulley in thingiverse :) 

@Guacamoleface
Thanks for your insight ! I know there are some people in Germany which are doing these kinds of repairs. But its nice to know that your vesc is still running in BLDC. 
I've gone FOC this morning and it runs nice. Startup is not a lot smoother than BLDC but wow, it is **SILENT** !   Have been riding it for approx. 10km now and not a problem. 
Thanks ! :) 

So convenient to have a 3d printer :D Will rework the design and make it a tad longer.

I think this build is due to an update :) 

- VESC fried while using FOC. Currently in repair by LP-Electronics.
- Time for me to finalize the design and the flaws.
- I upped the wall strength of the enclosures. Totally unnecessary 5mm now :smile:

- Final design with cutouts for VESC Micro USB port, LED push button, DC charging plug, phase wires, battery capacity screen

- Printing in progress. A part takes up to 8 hours and 150g of filament. 4 parts equal 4 days to finish both enclosures :)

**Despite all that. The board is on standby !**
**I scratched the vanguard idea because I've ordered myself an Icarus deck ! :joy:**
**I was obsessed with the beauty of the deck. I even griptaped it the same way. LOL !**

I'll redesign the enclosures to make them as small as they can be for my 10s4p setup and transfer everything over to the Icarus. This deck will either be on the back burner or if somebody wants it I'll consider selling it.

Its a shame that this board will never ride haha... I still painted the enclosures just to see how it would've looked. I really like the VESC port :smile: 
I planned to trace out the profile of the enclosures on this foam mat and have it lying underneath. The vinyl was planned to be on the bottom of the deck to hide the cable canal. 


@keegancdr
Which one would you need ? These are made to fit my measurements exactly. Its a 6s4p in one enclosure and the other one holds 4s4p +vesc/electronics. I'll have it up on thingiverse without the logo of course.

@Pedrodemio
Mhmm I have a depth of 1,2 for the text. The primer and spatula layers are so thin it won't take any of it away. The good thing with having a 3d printer is that you can always remake, repeat, recreate redesign it :)

I had this same exact issue, I got several DRV errors on full throttle while runing FOC.

I switched back to BLDC and furtunately my VESC was still good, in my opinion FOC is not worth it on the DIY VESC at least, besides you will get less final speed and a little less power.

Really nice man congrats, I always love Vanguard builds.

If you could design the enclosures to fit just a couple of milimeters away from the trucks, they would even nicer, as you will leave more free bamboo at the center bottom and the trucks would look integrated with the enclosures as one piece. You should also connect both battery compartments running the cables through the top side of the deck, design looks cleaner that way.

Nevertheless, everything looks awesome, it has it's own character.

And now I can use this info.!

What's the battery configuration that worked for you in the end? 6s4p in front compartment and 4s4p in the rear with vesc etc? that's what I'm thinking

Interested to know the actual battery layout there, looks likeside on end - battery parquet floor...but guessing since wrapped, the pic of the loose cells seem to be just random ;)

Ps: On the operating table, EMT box, Some countersinks would be nice to clean out the trachea...I mean rivet holes
