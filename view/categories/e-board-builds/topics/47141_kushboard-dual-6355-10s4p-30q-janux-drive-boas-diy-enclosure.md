Hi everyone, I'm looking to build a dual set up for my first Esk8 build. I was thinking of going with a single drive but i live in an area where hills are plenty, so i figured more torque on the board will be best. I have two normal longboards, a mini cruiser and an electric board from a kickstarter, Leafboard. So i guess you can say i have 'some' experience on boards and such. However, i am a huge doofus when it comes to the electronic parts. 
And having electronics explode are my worst fears. Hence i wrote this post to ask for advice and opinions.

Here's some pics of my board. My set up is,
Orangatang Kegels 
Bones Reds Ceramic
Earthwing Cruiser 32"
Caliber 44 Trucks

![3|690x388](upload://thszKTIQmfI7e0OcDrVr3ZBMAEI.jpg)

And here are the electronic parts that i plan to buy, not too sure if these parts are suitable for a dual set up, do advise me otherwise!

QTY 1, VESC Can Bus Connector products/vesc-can-bus-connector
QTY 1, Battery Percentage indicator https://www.mboards.co/collections/diy-electric-skateboard-parts/products/battery-percentage-indicator

As for the battery, i'm not too sure which to go for, but my goal is to have a good amount of range, and for the battery to be relatively flat, not too bulky. Still deciding... collections/electric-skateboard-battery-pack

As for the enclosure, i plan to get it last after setting up everything and then calculate how big should the enclosure be. 

Hopefully i didn't miss anything out. These are the items i plan to buy. Do let me know if there are any items that i should add on or change. 

I'm not very good at this sort of thing, but i'm willing to learn! Thank you for reading!

Some basic info about building your own esk8 you can find [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/draft-a-beginner-guide-to-diy-an-esk8/46844) :)  If you want to save some money there are some options ;)

That vesc from what I have seen on here can blow fairly easy when you are configuring it.  You dont have to get everything from diy because they do take some time to ship look at @psychotiller, @longhairedboy @barajabali  for some parts too as they are smaller one man operations and will get you stuff quicker and they stuff will probably be higher quality. With only an hour of read time you havent looked around a whole lot do some searches and you will find alot of info on here.

All looks pretty good. It looks like you have the monies to invest. In that case, go with FocBox from @longhairedboy and maybe battery as well.
And change that remote to Nano-x or at least  [mini remote](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Electric-Skateboard-2-4GHz-Remote-Controller-Transmitter-Receiver-Binding-Plug/272733085845?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)

The FOCBOX will run you about 155 new, the TB vesc is about 100.  

The FOCBOX is more suited for running in FOC mode, as many of the components have been upgraded.  It also has a higher ERPM limit than the TB one which can aid in durability.  Usually people consider the FOCBOX to be one of the best VESCS.  The TB one is a more budget friendly yet fairly reliable one.  Were you planning on running 10s or 12s?

you‚Äôll have a battery capable of outputting 80a, limited to 20a by the bms, powering 2 80a motors (160a)

you‚Äôll want to up the voltage to about 10s. do not use a 20a bms. you will be severely bottlenecking the pack since it‚Äôs capable of outputting 80a. I recommend you bypass the bms and use it for charging only. 

go ask him about a 10s4p 30q pack

Has your friend ever built a battery for esk8? they have to be able to discharge high current, to be strong and withstand vibrations and have to be correctly wired, insulated and welded. that's why i recommended @longhairedboy, he knows his shit
 if you want to save some :moneybag::moneybag:, go mono drive and 1 focbox. but get a proper battery that is capable of supplying enough current for dual drive(10s4p30Q is good). if you don't like the speed and torque, you can always upgrade do dual later.

Thanks everyone for all the advice and recommendations. I've purchased all the parts except for the enclosure and shall wait till the end to install it when i figured out how much space i need.

A few things i changed is i purchased the Enertion Nano-x remote instead of the one from TorqueBoards, and 
got the On/Off switch for a cheaper price of $30 from a reputable e-scooter site.  

Once the parts are all in, which i assume and hope is within a couple weeks, i'll assemble them and let you guys know how it goes!

Ok, i've sorta calculated how much space i'll need for an enclosure, and bought Psychotiller's 12" enclosure.
https://psychotiller.com/product/the-coupe-12

I wanted to get Eboosted's enclosures as it looked more towards my preference but i fear it might not fit
the curvature of my deck. It's also a bit thicker and i wanted my enclosure to be fairly thin so i went with the 
Coupe enclosure instead.

Do you think the Eboosted one will be able to fit? From the pictures he posted it seems quite large in capacity.

Okay, been busy with building this thing so there was a lack of posts. Turns out the blank screen for the indicator was due to static damage of some sort, ordered a new one and it's on the way. I've installed majority of things and i'm now programming and setting the things on VESC Tool. 

![20180322_234211|690x388](upload://juHf93ttpvuaTjm6hEKBoTa4nJm.jpg)

I had a problem with one of the VESCs connecting to the computer, and after meddling with it, turns out it was the sensor wire from one of the motors that was interfering with the connection.
 (it connected to the computer after i pulled the sensor wires apart)
I'm contacting TorqueBoards to see if i'm able to get a replacement motor. 

As for a rubber seal for the enclosure, i got one of those door/window rubber seals. It has a D shape, and the middle is hollow. I wanted it to be a bit thicker as my battery is just barely touching the deck, so i filled the inside of the rubber tubes with silicone.

![20180324_230414|690x388](upload://lYiuQqLsDq9YSna1WVuvoG9Ss7A.jpg)

Now, programming the throttle curve on VESC tool. You can see the big problem there. The future me knows, the 7am me didn't.

![20180325_225809|690x388](upload://gBkYqCXQzH2ghWnQWntEz7h1VIJ.jpg)

The throttle curve for the acceleration was somewhat correct, kinda smooth. The brake was a HARD BRAKE.
The curve should've been a concave droop. I'll fix that later on. I did a test ride downstairs of my apartment and it was nice and smooth. I then tried riding it to work....

The motor mount came loose halfway to work, and there were no bus stops unless i walk 20 mins. So i did the walk of shame in the hot sun, carrying a 7-ish kilo board to the nearest bus stop. 

Came to work, and cable tied the two motor mounts, because they came loose and were slanting outwards. It's temporary, i just want to hold everything together. I won't be riding with a cable tie so close to the motors. 

![20180326_231512|690x388](upload://nvkk6bpFd8wtsbwV68KAtuYsXJ1.jpg)

Nonetheless, other than fixing the motor mounts and setting some preferences on the VESC, i think we can call it done!


WRONG!

I drilled and installed threaded inserts on my deck, and a good amount of them were not straight. It's bad. 
In turn, a lot of my bolts did not line up and i wasn't able to bolt all 10 of them. In this case, i've come so far, i'd just go all the way and do it right. I looked up some downhill decks and spotted one deck that really stood out for me. A fishtail looking deck that is GREEN. 

![20180326_232656|690x388](upload://veArG32kTP1fLCboo26yofuZMEw.jpg)

It's 38 inches in length, or 95cm, and 10 inches wide, or 25cm. 

https://www.sickboards.nl/vsechny-desky/5659-kebbek-rockin-rookie-deck-only.html

I've been thinking of getting a smaller deck but after riding it halfway to work, i find my Leafboard to be better at tight corners and small pavements so i'll stick to using that for work commute. I will be using this DIY board for bigger park connectors and longer cruises, so a nice 38 inch downhill deck will be good for this. 

More to follow.

Currently installing the mount, it seems the motor shaft is a little too long so i'll have to cut it shorter by 6mm or so. Or perhaps there's another way around it where i don't have to cut it? Do let me know if there are.

But now as the mount is closer in the middle, the bearings for the idlers do not wrap the belt fully, extra washers for the bearings to stick out is my next to do list. ![30232624_1245981515534729_2018676133_o|690x388](upload://c8qc4TkUlO7URHAK3t1HWNlXOLr.jpg)

Bro put a speedring between the bearings! Two bearings rubbing up against each other is not good in any case. They are never perfectly aligned and that causes unnecessary friction. 
I also recommend you get a top M4 washer that is a little bigger and while youre at it put 1-2 underneath. Problem with your spacing solved.

Your motor pulley kinda looks like a 15mm pulley?

Your sequence is correct.

Make sure your bolt is still long enough to go through the complete nylon locking on the nut. Apply lots of loctite.

Guys, i have a problem. I'm trying to run sensored but i can't seem to wrap my head around it. I'm using the VESC tool version by @Ackmaniac, and used the motor wizard set up. 

I was able to set one up, but when running a motor detection for the other motor, it ran for just a split second and then disconnected from the computer. I tried it a couple times and decided not to do it anymore less i risk blowing something up (that's what my paranoid ass would imagine in my head)

I used this paint from Rustoleum.
The final surface more of a semi gloss actually. What i did to get the hammered look is to spray one coat normally, let it dry for a couple hours, and then spray one light coat about two feet away. 
The light mist makes the hammered surface. But you can skip that if you just want it black.

Apparently i can't get one of the motors to run sensored. 
When running a motor detection for one of them, as usual it will disconnect from the computer.
I switched VESCS and the same thing happened. So i'm certain it's the motor that is causing it, not the VESC.
And this occurs when i have the sensor wires plugged in. When i remove the sensor wire, it can be connected to the computer again. Does anyone have a similar problem like this on TB motors?

Update after a first proper test ride

I rode on a 15km route, and my battery was at 55% after all that. I'm impressed with the range. I wasn't able to get it to run sensored, but thanks to the idler motor mounts i got from @marcmt88, the belts were looser and hence i was able to kick push it easily. My threaded inserts have not arrived yet so i taped the enclosure to the board three layers, three times. 

I set the braking power to be -10A, and turns out it is a little weak after all. It was able to brake decently but it doesn't come to a complete stop, i had to hop off or stop the board with my front foot. I will set the braking power to -20A and try it out again.

I use the same remote e did the same to me. At the end in my case was the servo connector not all the way in the receiver, probably due to vibration during a test ride.

Otherwise I would suggest to redo the binding procedure another time through the vesc tool (someone also said to keep the receiver far from the motor-vesc phase wires.

Oh and the cable tie on the remote is tied to a bike bell, for ya know, pedestrians :wink:

I'm nearing the end, i can almost see it. I've done the motor set ups and PPM mapping, and i tested it in my hallway and works. But when i plugged into @Ackmaniac's VESC tool to add a throttle curve, the motor moved for a bit. I thought nothing of it and tried the board again. The remote is synced up this time, (solid green light) but the throttle and brakes don't do anything.

 Any idea how to go about this? Throttle curve is really needed for a sensitive remote like the Nano-x

This is about GPL and source code availability. I doubt that someone has an interest in locked down source code. If people struggle to get sources, they can now report that, so that Benjamin himself can take care of the matter, so that the missing sources will ultimately be available. That should be in everyone's interest.

In the past we got those reports vial mail or PM on the www.vesc-project.com Website. 
It is more convenient and transparent for everyone if there is a place for such matters.

Since the GPL matter popped up here, I just wanted to point into the correct direction, so that this thread can continue to debate dual drives, rather than GPL matters.

Yo buddy. We're not talking trademark here. Were talking GPL. We want the source from Enertion. They changed it for their own. So it being licensed under GPL and being open source project they are obligated to post it publicly. This isn't about vescs, the name vesc, ect... It's about the actual source code. The same code that BV posted publicly so Enertion could use, change, and not post publicly. That's not how this works. It's not about fucking anyone over. Hopefully you understand now.  ;)

The PET wire doesn't do much. It doesn't shrink upon heat and is a casing to protect the phase wires if you ask me. I use it to combine the three phase wires and sensor wires into one piece inside the PET wire. It makes it look nice that's all haha. Heat shrink will protect the phase wires, so i suggest adding a layer of it before the PET wire.

Just came home a couple hours ago. 

I did the Motor set up and PPM mapping again. Afterwards, i tested it out and both the throttle and brakes work. The motors spin and brake. After plugging it back in to add the throttle curve, same problem popped out again. I'm very puzzled as to why adding the throttle curve caused this. 

Here's the throttle curve on Nico's VESC tool.

I will sell them in the future but now I do not have it. So here you find the thread about it http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-monitor-android-app/20888/499 and he suggests this module https://www.aliexpress.com/item/HM-10-BLE-Bluetooth-4-0-CC2540-CC2541-Serial-Wireless-Module/32516357718.html?isOrigTitle=true11463 You basically need a HM-10 module. With the app you can read the telemetry during riding, plus changing the configurations of both of the vesc if they are connected by CAN. If you run them separatelly then you need to module to do that. 
Anyhow your throttle curve should work also in the normal VESC tool.

So can i do the motor and ppm set ups on Ackmaniac's and then do the throttle curve on the orignal VESC tool?

Of you use ackmaniac's software than also your VESC ha to be update with his firmware otherwise it won't work properly. You can get the firmware inside the VESC tool. For instance in his software the current no reverse with brakes works as watt max, so No you can switch to the original VESC tool. To use that one you media to install new firmware and run again all the detection. Are you sure you uploaded the custom firmware on the each of VESC? Otherwise that can be the reason why the throttle doesn't work. You find the firmware in the firmware section on the ackmaniac's VESC tool.

When i first used ackmaniac's software i did upgrade the firmware. I will re-upgrade it again and try it tonight. 

I guess i can do without the throttle curve, i tested it again this morning and it's manageable, just have to move the thumbstick really softly.

Threaded inserts came yesterday, i woke up at 6 in the morning and came to the shop to start work. 

Drilling the holes for the inserts.

Good! You are almost done with the build. Testo do update to the latest firmware. Actually Ackmaniac released a new version of the VESC tool 3.101 if I am not wrong. You can find on his thread. Since you have to do it anyway use the latest that fixed a bug with the brakes, quite important.

Okay, this time i did the motor set up and PPM mapping on the original VESC tool. After that, throttle and brakes work as per normal. But after adding throttle curve, same thing. The throttle and brakes do nothing.

Did you try to only set the throttle curve click write setting or something similar to write the configuration in the VESC and then test it? Anyhow it was OK use the Ackmaniac's vesc tool. You can try with making a video from the beginning when you update the VESC firmware on each vesc (separately). Run motor detection on the VESC separately. Then only on master you do the PPM configuration (that's in case you use can bus). Remember ti set correctly the ID for master as 0 and 1 for slave. On the slave VESC once you do the PPM setting you only have to specific that is the slave VESC and the rest is automatically done. I know the video takes time but also constantly try without succeed is kind of frustrating :persevere: otherwise use them with out the modify throttle curve but I do agree that nano-X has a short trigger course.

Back to building! I have a metal lathe so i turned these bushings out of a carbon fiber block for the Caliber II trucks. It's just an experiment to see if it makes the trucks feel more like 'Precision' trucks. It does make turning feel more responsive. I'll test ride it again and see if i feel comfortable with it on or without.

Skate day! There's a car free event today and the roads were blocked for cyclists, joggers, escoot peeps and US, the esk8 peeps, and everything in between of course. 

Not sure if you can see me but my board certainly pops out, the green and orange are striking colors.![30849979_1254465104686370_2038654384_o|666x500](upload://yjISRFwarfBpqng7MzFWt5vvnpn.jpg)

Rode the board for about 15 mins and the remote lost connection from the receiver. Fortunately it did not fly or anything so i stopped safely. ![31288379_1254465131353034_2100891765_o|690x388](upload://yHZadNJbIcFNu7lPt9DehVKMfFJ.jpg)

I removed the enclosure as i had allen keys on hand and the receiver is blinking red, it should be a solid red when connected. 

Fortunately one of the guys around was riding a Raptor 2 and had the same remote. His remote was able to sync with my board and it runs, so i think something's not right with my remote.

 Might have to drop enertion an email to clarify if its a defect and see if they can send me a new one. This remote is really grinding my gears, i mean belts :joy:

As i'm awaiting the Nano-x and Photon remote, i was able to get my hands on a Mini remote from a local builder. I plugged it in, did the programming on the VESC tool and boom, it works! The throttle curve issue is still causing the board to not respond to throttle and braking, even after using the new Mini remote. I left it as it is since the remote has smooth acceleration and braking so a curve was not needed. 

![32162164_1261205867345627_1628514211229335552_n|279x500](upload://3T12UqAUE9ygiqNHvkhoncZoTS1.jpg)![32191204_1261205840678963_8237972347194179584_n|279x500](upload://yI1cPIpFxK6A4aih4U2gXYf7vz8.jpg)

Cutting and sanding the wheel knob area way. And polishing!

Also i noticed that wheels with a square lip tend to chip or crack. I did get a small crack so i hooked the Kegels to an individual truck and off to the belt sander! Because it spins while on the belt sander, it evens out the roundover and gave me a small curve on the corners. Not too aggressive, just enough to prevent any further chipping. ![32169816_1261205800678967_1407559167715049472_n|690x388](upload://mFoFeiQrwyVGHore5YehvWPXG7z.jpg)

You should not do that. Y-PPM can kill your ESCs since that configuration creates ground loops. The voltage regulators are then fighting constantly against each other. Such features should not be implemented in any firmware, since users will be driven to setup a wrong electrical system that makes some components suffer or die.

If your voltage regulators blow up one day, you will know whom to thank..

The HW4 based ESCs are just more tolerant to this issue, but ultimately they can also fail on ground loops. It's simply wrong to set things up like that.
Now that more different Vesc based ESCs hit the market, people will start to fry their ESCs because of that "feature", simply because they are unaware of ground loops. Such a feature shouldn't exist because it is potentially destructive for devices.

Y PPM is actually much better. when(not if) your vescs die, if you are on CANBUS they both go down, leaving you at 30mph flailing like a fucking bird without any brakes. Split PPM on the other hand, if one vesc goes, the other stays as they are both masters. Ask me how i know...

You are not good cutting one 5V line! You still have the ground loop in your system. People have killed devices and will kill devices in future because of that "feature". Once more different HW hits the market, you will not know how sensitive it reacts to voltage spikes, drops in the 5V rail. 
HW4 is more tolerant to the faulty setup, that's why some used it on their boards with success. Still  chipsets suffers and will eventually blow. It's simply the wrong way to do it. 

The correct way to set things up for HW4: 

- configure each ESC separated from another, no CAN cable attached.

- Make sure both ESCs are hooked up to the same power source/electrical circuit and always power up simultaneously.

- After configuration of each ESC apply CAN cable.

@Ebisane9 
If you think that Y-PPM is safer: If one ESC dies, you have a 50/50 chance that it's the one powering up your receiver. Leaves you without brakes at 30mph.... 

@mmaner: All VESC based ESCs feature CAN, so forget your marketing argument. This is purely informative information. Funnily the topic popped up while I was on a ride with Benjamin yesterday, testing out some software tweaks. He confirmed: 
Do not use Y-PPM. He has to know why, being the designer of the soft- and hardware. Any ground loop should be avoided at all times!

To every one out there building a deck with a v4 VESC. Split PPM is fine, 1000s of people use it everyday. Can Bus is fine, 1000s of people use it everyday.

With can bus you get traction control and the ability to  use a single Bluetooth module toconfig dual VESC's. With split PPM you don't have to worry about power up sequence. 

Rhetoric aside, using actual evidence...

Yeah we hear this all the time that split ppm can damage the vesc. 
I never heard of anyone damaging a vesc using split ppm. Canbus on the other hand...plenty.,,


Only positive thing with canbus is the ability to change modes with a blueetooth module IMO.
Traction control is great but what happens if you snap a belt and dont have a spare with you? 

Absolute safest way is 2 recivers and 1 remote.

I been using split ppm for over 60miles now, had no issues at all.

It's been a few months since the completion of the build. As i get better at using the board, i figured 6s batteries are definitely not good enough. Holy crap it's so slow! Should've listened to you guys at the start and went with a 10s or maybe even 12s.

I've done some upgrades to the board and am in the midst of getting a 10s4p made. I've also changed some parts and am waiting for a few more to come. 

Oust bearings!

And Boa Constrictors!![20180818_203150|690x388](upload://cGqqiEIRi1pZLGAL9XntvKR03Ge.jpg)

Hooked it onto the current pulleys without changing, so top speed is increased but loss of torque by a bit.

Yea i had to high heel the truck for no wheel bites.![20180818_220542|690x388](upload://rWnolXuHFno7njnuzm9rjHWqeCH.jpg)

Then, i got @JLabs's new slip on pulley. It's 44T in this case.
![20180903_204711|690x388](upload://quIL7t5fWJSBB8fFMEAIxbF4KJi.jpg)![20180903_204735|690x388](upload://5qFdp6kPbIYndWltQGFRx9NthPE.jpg)![20180903_204707|690x388](upload://zFOm3G8NrXEI37Qosdxbxx3PvtS.jpg)![20180904_133850|690x388](upload://Au8AGF3ptARtwRm36a5y5HDYczV.jpg)![20180904_131209|690x388](upload://j0110uEPoI8dJ0zSzZ4PXT1SLMm.jpg)![20180903_222644|690x388](upload://6qweeJdzP2NQGP9stgDl9vavyxc.jpg)![20180903_204727|690x388](upload://qPaoPVUBNRcxsubBqQGzX1i2XOm.jpg)![20180904_140326|690x388](upload://dHXxLLeKN7tPjh9OI4v0jCLXQpu.jpg)
 
Ok up next! I got @marcmt88's new blackout drive systems, with crossbars and an improved idler and mount.
  ![20180817_124217|281x500](upload://w3UsVRPCCtwBGF0ewnyZZOE8ovv.jpg)
![20180907_232617|690x388](upload://jn0lqKeBZzdMBNtvnS5fTReUFFO.jpg)![20180907_232605|690x388](upload://mwo29CkxGLUomufGEUdFY467nhZ.jpg)

Due to the pulley that had the taller bearing, it pushed the wheel out a bit, and i had to use washers to accommodate for the space for the crossbars. I'll turn some carbon fiber washers to fit it so it'll fit the 'all black' look. ![20180908_124109|690x388](upload://5UOJWPGuI0o2OWwkfMCnJ3o6Joc.jpg)

Now comes the hard part. As i'm upgrading from a 6s battery to a 10s, i'm getting 16 more cells to fit in the enclosure. The current one is too small so i'll have to get a longer one. The problem is that the threaded inserts are already on the deck and it'll be hard to find an enclosure with the same width as the current one, so i figured i'll have to make it myself.

It'll be in fiberglass as i don't have access to a vacuum form. I swear this took me so long to do and so much work, i applaud @Eboosted  and his enclosures of art. ![20180829_192710|690x388](upload://4bQ4zDJWhmddrUEH8xzcANQLtun.jpg)

![20180901_124715|690x388](upload://nQoe6uFFnNYYhKVpOCMQ5jDZDUW.jpg)

After that, i sprayed a couple coats of primer to seal up the entire thing
![20180901_125410|690x388](upload://4gqDsv2f8IJ9I3GfUXmx9o6r9ZS.jpg)

![20180905_124441|690x388](upload://c7Fv5uOdJ4168YVWGc4lSSMRlVI.jpg)

I didn't have silicone on hand, if not i would have molded over this and do my fiberglass from the interior instead. So i did it from outside. It'll have a nice surface inside, but will look like shit on the outside.

I was right.![20180905_203544|690x388](upload://mYbpvI9YMuoNnXRJxCU5epY28Du.jpg)

![20180907_212209|690x388](upload://323zy1VC8mDL2CFtVMGnaJ9q8vN.jpg)

A lot of bubbles to fill, and a lot of cosmetic work to be done on the outside. More to come soon.

Riding also feels really different, in a good way.

Orange Kegels are 80A hardness, Boas are 83A, so i'd thought it'll feel a bit hardier, yet it feels nice and soft, ride is really comfortable now and going on rough roads are not as bad with Kegels.

Had time to work on the enclosure. I'm using fiberglass body filler to fill imperfections and add a bit of bulk on some areas.![20180920_200941|690x388](upload://2btYNorG1ASWcB0ajnrxQppI8IU.jpeg) ![20180920_200943|690x388](upload://1M3eL2zKdF28KKTY50Ol5RxNtpQ.jpeg) 

Sprayed a couple coats of primer and wet sanded to get the round corners and surfaces.![20180922_004939|690x388](upload://zOdhKQd09bvRSLaRtTqX8wiezOi.jpeg) ![20180921_215255|690x388](upload://plMEzGuutnRbLn4sQvVUlRa9MfB.jpeg) 
And finally, a coat of flat black and clear coat on top. I'll install it on the deck once it's completely dry.

Nice build. Could you elaborate what you had to do to run those pulleys? I've got stock caliber 2's and was looking at getting them.

The upgraded battery is done, here it is.![20180923_223141|690x388](upload://7mjMquSRvzx6HpsUwKIvYJJqeO6.jpeg) 

Drilling the new holes on the enclosure![20180927_001103|690x388](upload://hu9u8PVgDjQfVL0U1TmHLeZsEno.jpeg) 

Perfect alignment.![20180927_010147|690x388](upload://4pAYs0UEUaYHvuXzgSCRxk9P0Nc.jpeg) 

Focboxes came after 3 months haha.
I ran in FOC mode this time, and both were able to detect FOC. However one of the motors did not detect hall sensors, it got a bad detection. I swapped focboxes and the same motor had the issue. I suspect the hall sensor on the motor might be faulty. Is it possible to fix? Also, is it fine to run one sensored, and one sensorless?![20180930_001325|690x388](upload://vIcKZMNxpXRJi6lBN93vy7mUoM4.jpeg) 

Cutting the holes for a battery % indicator, charging port and power switch, also holes for phase wires.

Wired and velcroed everything to the deck.

Red fender washers to match the Boas, also glad that i placed the switch and charging port on the top, it's so easy to turn the board on and charge without bending down to reach.

Currently using my old mini remote, i'm hoping to get a Firefly remote in future, but will need to have it mirrored to have the screen on the other side because i'm left handed. Other than that, i'd like to get the whole set up sensored to really polish it up. If you guys have any experience with the hall sensor bad detections, do advise!

Hall sensor wires can be super fragile.

Check continuity and at each connection site to make sure nothing is disconnected.

Check at your JST connector sites too and along the cable then track back to the motor just in case!

Will do! Do you know if it'll be fine to run one motor sensored and the other sensorless?

So yea, here's how the stomach looks.
I'm currently running sensorless FOC and it seems to work well. Perhaps when i'm free one day i'll take a look at the motor's insides and see if the sensor wires are fine.

Deck swap time. 38" is a bit too long for my liking so i got a [Prism Origin V1 deck](https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/prism-origin-longboard-deck). 
![20190104_144612|690x388](upload://8ehxSuiONxzPhTfn2yTlvbXhXRF.jpeg)

Sealed the two enclosure holes and added more automotive filler to conform the edge of the enclosure to the deck's concave.

The build is really sick! Only concern to me would be the hight of the board? Do you feel comfortable? Do you need such high raiser to avoid wheel bites?

I run my bushings at 85~87A. I weigh 70kg so my trucks are considered a bit on the loose side. When i do a full lean the wheels almost touch the deck so i had to use a good amount of risers. I'm used to high rides so its not so much of a difference. In fact it feels weird for me now on lower height boards :rofl:
