If only I could have kept all of them but they have to be sold to make way for the new!

Nice post! What were you using so many kegels for? Hub motor testing possibly?!

I was using them as front wheel and I was machining the mount before I had a mould, but we won't this does not work!

Deck I love my Ryan supreme and my dervish Sama.

Trucks rey precisions I think there better then caliber precisions.

Esk8 has to be my boosted because of the ride feel.

DIY esk8 I loved my Bhangra with precision trucks. I still have the custom mounts and was thinking of remaking this build.

My lattest hubs motors are so sweet thought.
