Just pics for now, will update as I get this thing finished. 

basically the evolution from this thread: 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/arbor-james-kelly-pro-model-build-space-cell-vesc-190kv-wood/760

I've managed to program both VESC's without frying any DRV's, and confirm the BMS is working as it should. Just need to get the case finished (clean up the fiberglass, and sand/stain the wood cases), and wire up an on/off + charge port!

i like those battery cases, look like they will bend a bit with the board which is nice.  how limited is you bms?

Lovin' all that wood showing through! Those battery cases look killer! Nice work! :thumbsup:
@cmatson I see that you like working with wood. You should try working with Danish Oil. It's readily available at your local hardware store like Lowes and Home Depot. One can of this stuff goes a long way. 
I like using it for a few key reasons.  
1. It is a wipe on finish, so no brushes sprayers, or special tools needed. 
2. Danish oil penetrates into the wood and brings out all of the contrast and character of the grain! Since it literally soaks into the wood there is nothing to chip or peel. Awesome! (I find top coats almost always chip and peel and then you have to sand the whole surface and recoat to make it look right.)
3. Very easy to repair and maintain. It is a mixture of tung oil and polyurethane like they use on gun stocks. If you scratch the surface and want to repair it, you just have to lightly sand down the spot and reapply some Danish Oil.

SWEET!! You are going to love using this stuff. Just make sure that when you first start applying to bare wood that you keep wiping more oil until it stops absorbing it so fast. Also when you are done with that coat wipe the whole surface clean of any leftover oil. This stuff not only works great, but I enjoy watching the wood transform before my eyes. Have fun, dude!! 
I used the Dark Walnut Danish Oil on this job:

Awesome!

I used the medium walnut finish, and looks perfect so far- 

A little darker than my board, which is exactly what I want.

Thanks again for the recommendation!

works great!!

insane amount of torque thanks to @hummie's motors, and a pretty decent top speed. 10s4p getting the job done. 

The wood cases also turned out great thanks again to @Ulfberht's recommendation.  

I opted not to add an LCD, due to there being very little room in my case as it is, and that my 10s4p will last a while when I'm used to a 10s3p and smaller.

Unfonately James Kelly left the Arbor team (alone with Liam Morgan) so both of their pro models are going to be replaced with someone else's. 

For now though, you can still find the deck here and there (for a much steeper price). https://www.surfdome.us/arbor_longboards_-_arbor_james_kelly_pro_longboard_deck_-_38_5_inch-242946?istCompanyId=0f4b2de6-b73d-47d5-8bc8-13d348649c68&istItemId=qitaxtpxw&istBid=tztx&gclid=Cj0KEQjwouW9BRCN0ozIifTI6_cBEiQAD9gNsfCgg8opyrwbqovZ4-YKY-HDmMeVxSCrgrKKfWsMX4IaAmwp8P8HAQ&gclsrc=aw.ds

Been riding it a ton lately.. 

Probably 200 miles put on it, and the rubber on @hummie's motor Is getting in pretty bad shape. 

Yesterday both motors just cut out power, and I came to a coasting stop. I could use the brakes, but not the throttle. 

Turned the board off, back on, and everything worked fine for about a minute. Then, throttle cut, and I could only use the brakes. 

Though maybe the vescs were overheating, or that the board was dead, but when I got home(pushing of course) the battery was at 41v and the vescs weren't that warm. Plus, I'd never had the vescs over heat on me. 

Charged it, came back today, does the same thing. Opened it up, and ran it on the bench. The motors were running for about a minute when the lights on both vescs just went out, and the motors stopped. Turned it off, back on, and proceeded to repeat this find multiple times. No red flashing lights, just loss of power. 

@longhairedboy did you encounter anything like this with any of your bms's? Maybe a faulty switch?

makes me think it's something with the BMS- like a faulty temp sensor or something.

so update.. 

**It's currently broken and I'm not sure what's wrong**

been fiddling with it for weeks now.. 

Rode it solid for the less tan the first month, taking it literally everywhere I went (just look at my instagram- I swear I managed 200 miles or more before this weird behavior) and then it just shut off one day while riding. No response from the remote. thought it may have been dead. 

Flipped the switch on/off, and it worked for another 50ft, then shut off. 

though the BMS was overheating. Let it cool, still shuts off after a short amount of riding (less than 30 seconds to a minute)

charged the batteries- no change. 

checked all the balance wires and connections- they are all strong, and work for about 30seconds.. until it shuts off. 

replaced the switch (and even hardwired the two e-switch wires together) no change. 


It is the BMS shutting off though, because when I replicate it on the bench, it is just going strong and then both of the VESC's loose their blue lights and everything turns quiet. 

_confirmed it is the BMS, not sure why_

please @longhairedboy or anyone else from the group buy a while ago comment your suggestions/opinions!!

I don't have a 10s balance charger, and really liked the extra BMS functionality since I could use a laptop style charger with zero worries.. might just have to get a new BMS at some point

Dangit... I have the same BMS and I think I am experiencing the same issue. 

Mine cuts off after awhile too. While riding, it just cuts off. I turn it on and then back, and it just works and dies soon after... No idea. 

I also had some kinda of smoke coming from the BMS unit. 

:confused:

Bulk charging and ten dollar monitor/balancers is so simple.  Less things to break. Charge at 400 watts and not have to disconnect batteries just use the single battery plug with them all in series.

I heard that these BMSes were "frying" but I found no evidence or posts about them. I guess those were true. I want to do more testing to make sure that this thing is chopped. 

I guess the best test would be to run directly without a BMS connected... Here goes nothing.

## \#30 Posted by: Pantologist Posted at: 2016-10-25T22:48:46.257Z Reads: 110

I've been doing bench testing...

So after fully charging my battery to 43.2v(charge voltage), I turned on my soft switch and let the receiver and ESC turn on. I did not run the motor. After about 5-10 minutes the voltage dropped to almost nominal voltage. At around 41v or so, the ESC and receiver just shut off for no reason.

The battery definitely has charge left. I've drained it to 36v and it usually dies around then. 

Do you have this similar issue? I've also inspected the PCB and I can't see any issues. Most of the components are within the two stacks so it's hard to tell.
```

## \#31 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2016-10-26T01:11:03.245Z Reads: 109

```

yep, similiar issue. 

I had my battery fully charged, and the VESC's would still just turn off (lights would go out) for no reason. 

On the bench it would take longer than if I flipped over the board and attempted to ride it: if I rode it, the BMS cut power almost immediately..
```

This is super weird. 

The first time after modifying the setup and discovering the issue, I probably rode 1/2 a mile before the BMS cut off and launched me into thin air... That seems to be longer than what it is now... can't figure out why.

I am fairly certain that the BMS is falsely detecting a low voltage cell or something and shutting off. Even my battery gauge meter will shut off after awhile. 

Also to note, everytime I turn on the softswitch, the power goes through the system and then cuts as if the BMS is detecting then cutting load. 

Time to make Raphael Chang's BMS.

Ya I have no clue what's happening. 

First started on the way home from a 12 mile ride- cut out with about 3 miles to go. But I just flipped the soft switch on/off and the board started running fine again. Although it cut out more and more as I got closer to home on the ride. 

Thought it was heat, but when I came back the next day it still was happening, and even worse. 

Charged the battery, same problem still. 

Now she's been torn apart for the last month or so looking very depressed :disappointed_relieved:

If you do end up making a BMSaturday, I would gladly pay for you to make a second for me :wink:

This part of your problem could be something to do with the current draw at a lower voltage which would make the voltage sag to cutoff discharge voltage. 

My build has been sitting for a few weeks too :cry: 

If I build his BMS, I will probably make a few after testing first. Even if something goes wrong on his BMS, at least there is a way to figure out what is going wrong. His will probably cost around $90-$100 each without being mass produced btw.

So I disconnected and reconnected the ESC and balance connectors to the BMS and now it does not shut off. My battery seems to be fine and the BMS is not shutting it off. 

I'm sure it will come back though. Maybe I should let the cells balance charge for awhile... The BMS will cut load if a cell drops below a certain voltage... My cells were unbalanced a tad bit. 

After test riding it today and I'll see if I'll remove the BMS or not.

I currently also have a 6s single motor street setup to bash around if I'm tired of the pneumatics, or for friends aswell.. 

In other words, I think I'm going to part out this board to fund another small board build on my arbor rally. Basically a revival of this guy: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/arbor-rally-pocket-rocket-build-vesc-6s-245kv-enertion-mount-9in-calibers/868
