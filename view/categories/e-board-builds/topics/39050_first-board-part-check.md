I've settled on an electric skateboard for transportation, but I've got some worries. I live in a hilly place, at the top of a couple 5% grade hills. Not horrible, but enough to make me walk my bike up to save my breath. I'm absolutely fine lowering my top speed for better hill support, since I don't plan on chasing speed anyway. I'm ~55kg, so I shouldn't need too strong of a motor, although I suppose the hill requirement cancels that out. I have no issues soldering, so I don't need lots of connectors. I'm planning on using a single motor (for now) with belt drive. My main problem is, like most people, price. So I'm wondering what parts I can sacrifice or downgrade with the least amount of effect.

The setup I'm looking into now is (converted into CAD):
MOTOR 1x - Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-168KV Brushless Outrunner Motor - $102
BATTERIES 2x - ZIPPY Flightmax 8000mAh 5S1P 30C - $151
REMOTE 1x - HobbyKing® ™HK-GT2B 3CH 2.4GHz Transmitter and Receiver w/Rechargable Li-ion Battery - $30 (reaaaally don't like the look of this but its cheap)
CHARGER 1x - Turnigy B6 Compact 50W 5A Automatic Balance Charger 2~6S Lipoly - $23
LOOP KEY 1x - XT90-S Anti-Spark Connector (2pairs/bag) - $8
WHEELS 1x - 83mm Pro Longboard Cruiser Wheels Flywheels - nowhere to buy this yet
TRUCKS 1x - Caliber Trucks II Fifty Caliber 184mm Hi Satin Gold Longboard Trucks 50 Degrees - 10" Axle (Set of 2) - nowhere to buy this yet
DECK 1x - No idea. Maybe something like 40" length 10" width, that's my current ride and it feels great.
ESC 1x - TORQUE ESC VESC ® BLDC ELECTRONIC SPEED CONTROLLER + male to male servo - $133 (don't want to sacrifice this, seems like the only decent ESC plus its open source)
MOTOR MOUNT/PULLEY 1x - SINGLE BOLT ON MOTOR MOUNT W/ DRIVE WHEEL KIT - $140 (products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-w-drive-wheel-kit?variant=712231944215 should have everything I need for assembly?)

Assuming deck+trucks+wheels comes out to $100, I'm paying ~$750, not including shipping from torqueboards. That's pretty hefty as a starting price. I can't mill my own parts, best I can do is 3d print the enclosure since it seems printed motor mounts don't hold up. Any ideas on where I should go from here?

[MINI remote](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Radio-2-4GHz-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Binding-Plug-For-Electric-Skateboard/253250151161?hash=item3af6e2a2f9:g:kWQAAOSwZtlaBBPK) is the way to go :)

You can get the motor mount and pulleys from ppl on forum for a much lower price...just search :)

If you can afford to buy abec flywheels or orangatangs, buy them instead of cheap chineese clone :) they suck

^^ this thread has my details and some other people's options.  Some places you can save money, motor can be about $80 for something similar if you dig around some more, motor mount and pulley kit you can get from HK for cheaper, I went with the DIY kit for convenience and was before HK even offered anything (still think DIY is probably higher quality).

You could go smaller and cheaper on the LiPos too but depends on how much range you're going for and how much weight of the board is a consideration being a small dude myself having a big board with huge battery was cumbersome. Now I have a much smaller deck and 5S 5Ah x2 to make a 10S 5Ah = 185Wh battery, approximately 10Wh = 1km (I get slightly better than this typically)

Also if the roads where you live are bad make sure to either get soft wheels 76-78a or larger wheels like 90-97mm. That's just what I have found. I live in Aus and the roads are crap for esk8 (I have 83mm 80a wheels and my feet go numb after about 500m)

Alright, so replacing the motor mount kit with these two products from HK:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/gear-set-with-belt.html
Would that be everything needed for the drivetrain minus screws?

I could replace the batteries with 2x ZIPPY Flightmax 5800mAh 5S1P 30C, but that only knocks down ~$15 with a sacrifice to distance.

I'm also gonna grab that MINI remote instead.
