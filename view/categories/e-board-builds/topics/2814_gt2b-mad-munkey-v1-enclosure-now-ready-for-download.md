**LINK TO THINGIVERSE:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1550237**

So it started out with my first build. I needed a controller that was reliable, so I went with the GT2b reliability with the BadWolf Mod and it was great... until I wrecked and broke it! One thing was clear… I needed a stronger case. Searching brings up nothing for enclosures until I saw a remote that @treenutter posted on instagram. It looked good but still had some things I didn't want. After some sleepless nights and printer running constantly I have a working prototype. This is a get your hands dirty enclosure but makes it as small as I could get it while still keeping a nice radius for the grip. This mod will give you the third channel button, has a place for the first channel to put on a switch and you will also get a voltage meter for battery life. You will have to solder somethings. You will have to unsolder the USB connector. You will need some extra wire. You will have to cut the main board. You will have to cut the trigger plastic. No switch extension needed. Covered all the adjustable knobs and reverse switches because I don't want them moved. Full throw of the trigger forward and back...

Anyone still reading? Anyone interested in this mod? It's really close to putting up on thingiverse #DIYisforsharing.

Let me know if you have any questions about anything. I will try and post some more pics tonight.

Nice job!

A hole for throttle calibration would be nice to have but not necessary. I have a mod in the works too, I am adding a switch for the 3rd channel. I'm thinking it would be nice to have for a light system.

Thanks @chaka, is the calibration the same as the bind button? The bind button hole is there for use with a paperclip. Yes, 1st channel switch will control my LED under glow and 3rd channel will cycle my headlight off/low/med/high.

Looks like you made the walls thick. Do you think it could handle having a slide puck with velcro? You could probably print a positive model of a form fitting puck and make a silicon mold. Orange scented pucks!

@chaka  It would be awesome to use it to switch headlights on and off on channel 3 while running the tail and brakelights constantly via the channel 2 insert so it can still grab the forward/reverse signal. Could probably hack the RC Lighthouse kit i got from amazon to do that. They're putting out all kinds of lighting kits now that just trigger from the signal. 

Also there's this mysterious extra crap on the steez remotes i want to play with at some point, looks like it might be some kind of light control as well. 

@FLATLINEcustoms that remote mod looks really good bro!

I like them a whole lot actually. I just wish they weren't so expensive. I use them exclusively on my builds for other people, and the only GT2B i use now is on my 6S rat board. 

they are every bit as reliable and solid as the GT2B so far, and yet they are practically indestructible in the usual scenarios where you toss them as you're falling, they're far more ergonomic and don't give me a sore hand after a long while of riding, they fit in my pocket and they aren't shaped anything like a gun.  But they cost 4 times as much as a GT2B, so love hurts i guess.

I will definitely post the pcb files up on oshpark once completed.

If you are interested these switches work great on the gt2b: http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.TRS5&_nkw=250V+3A+3+Pin+ON%2FON+I%2FO+2+Position+SPDT+&_sacat=0

Requires removing the old switch and using a wired connection but it really cleans up the face on these mods.

I like that switch a lot! I was trying to keep it as much stock internals as possible. I'll post some interior pics after work. Get some guru's to help with the switch wiring.

I was thinking center pin on channel one to a resistor through switch and then to left or right pin. Just want an on off switch wiring for what was the steering wheel.

I got to say I absolutely hated the badwolf gt2b mod, but you seem to have fixed the issues I had with it. I removed all the material around the trigger because it was hard to press the brakes, it was bigger than it needed to be and flimsy, the switch with the extension was almost unusable, the screws didn't work, the other thing is I don't like is the 3d printed material because feels cheap. If this could be molded it could possibly be the best remote ever. Great work

Hey @FLATLINEcustoms, I have done a number of injection molding tools overseas. I would expect a simple part like yours to cost $3-5K. Tooling in the US will probably cost 3-5x that.

I'd love to 3D print one for myself if you ever decide to share the design :slight_smile:

## \#36 Posted by: Jeff Posted at: 2016-05-05T18:23:46.951Z Reads: 830

@FLATLINEcustoms you could also make your own soft tool pretty easily (with practice).

All you need is a gallon of silicone ($150) and a box. Use your 3D printed case to create the mold and then buy two-part urethane to fill it and make hundreds!

I would only go injection mold if you plan on making thousands of these...

There are a bunch of videos out there. Here is one that might give you some more ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSH19G_6Yeo

 I use smooth-on for a lot of my supplies as well. 

You can make the mold out of soft urethane or silicone. I would pick a hardness of around 15-40A durometer.

Wall thickness around the edges isn't too critical, I would leave about 20 mm to give you something to grip when de-molding.

---
## \#48 Posted by: Jeff Posted at: 2016-05-05T19:42:47.433Z Reads: 750

```
The only thing to check for is whether or not the material in the clay is a cure inhibitor. I know some clays act as cure inhibitors for certain types of silicones (I use platinum cure silicone, not sure about tin cure). If it does have cure inhibiting material, the silicone won't cure at that interface. Not sure about urethane molds, just something to check.

Smooth-on also makes something called Inhibit-X. I put that on my SLA molds since they inhibit the cure on platinum cure silicone.

Thank you treenutter, right now I am working on two things.

First is buying some of the molding products from Smooth-On thanks to the help of everyone. Going to try my hand at mold making. What I want is to get a quality product for the Esk8 community. 

Second, I am not proficient in Solidworks, so I am trying to learn how to use the **Cavity Feature** to see what I can do with aluminum on my friends X-carve. Apparently it will take my Solidworks file and make it ready for CNC cutting. If anyone works in Solidworks that can help please let me know. Hopefully he can help me get more than one aluminum mold done, so I can pour more at one time.

just make sure you cover the battery with a piece of the plastic from taking the battery apart. It should cover all of the metal part of the battery plus the BMS.

And here's the second attempt. Printed nicely. Took 10h, 15% infill. Don't mind the pink color, I may cover it up, maybe in plastidip? 

The other one that had the defect towards the end, I printed just the top portion and glued it together so I wouldn't waste the plastic.

It depends how you setup your vents.....Can you send a picture of your mold?

My guess would be to just give it a go with how you have it and tap the mold to try to get any trapped air to escape.

It shouldn't use much material so if it fails you can always try again with a different technique.

@FLATLINEcustoms 

Hi, i'm actually totally new to this forum, but not to e-skateboarding.
id love to use one of your Munkeys.
But 1st i do not getit how to PM in this forum.
and 2nd would you be willing to share the 3d data, so that i could make some changes
  -id need a pot-signal for the steering channels instead of the swiches you made
   (for linear controlling a break servo for magura breaks additionally but separate to the regen-break)

I use Autodesk inventor and would be happy if you wanna share your data.
otherwise where are you acutally living, and what would you take for one munkey inc shipping to Austria/europe

greets

@Maxid pointed out his battery is longer than the GT2b battery I have. The GT2b and 800mah spare batteries I use are from Hobbypartz.com 

**Remote:** http://www.hobbypartz.com/79p-fsgt2b-2ch-car.html 

**Battery** http://www.hobbypartz.com/79p-fs-b800-battery.html

I am curious if some of the remotes are shipping with the 1200mah upgrade already in them. This was designed around the 800mah battery with no heatshrink over it. You don't need the 1200mah battery, the 800mah battery lasts forever. Please post up if your GT2b came with the larger 1200mah battery so we can see where these are coming from. 

He also mentioned the PCB on the throttle pot. This needs to be removed to fit in the Mad Munkey. The traces are easily tracked and is pointed out in the How-to video (that I need to finish).

First of all thank you @FLATLINEcustoms for this amazing remote. it feels so much better than the badwolf. You can just feel how much more refined the entire thing is and how much thought has gone into the process if designing it. I really hope this becomes the new gold standard for DIY GT2B remotes.

The battery was surprising for me as I did not even know there are different versions out there. I ordered the cheapest GT2B I could find and got one from amazon. The recess where the battery is supposed to go in the mad munkey was slightly too short so I made it bigger on a milling machine. However the antenna pcb now rests directly on the battery which makes the main pcb slightly crooked - no big deal it still works.

Couple of pictures:
battery too long :cry:

What the heck ist that  ??? your are asking ?

I would love to make a version of the Munkey with the Steering chanel of the remote as additional break chanel for servo supported hydraulic breaks like trampa uses on their mountainboards.

In order to make this real and not regenerative breaking smooth and less dangerous i would need a long sliding poti to really have control about the break servo.
The poti on the image is a standard 30mm slide poti, but 45mm would also fit.

What do you think?

I have no clue how you plastic printing guys work, so is it actually possible to combine this mesh.kind of file with my additional mod i draw in autodesk inventor somehow, and make it printabel.
Or even better FLATLINE has interest in this idea and makes a second version with servo break poti, if ther actually is any demand for that ??
break control would be with the thumb and the idea is that the thumb is positioned unter the break"lever", and if needed has to go over it and push down. This should make sure that in case of goin over bumps you do not exidently break.
So regenerative breaking is the method to slow down, but real servo breaking is to really go down ernourmous steep hills, and make point-breaks at crossings, or in city.

any more ideas on it ?

After riding with it yesterday and today i just want to give a quick comparison to the badwolf:
- feels much more rigid. I just taped it together because I did not want to put the screws in yet - the two halves fit like a glove and hold fine. No wobbling like with the thin walled badwolf.
- more throttle range - brakes as well as acceleration have a longer travel which makes for finer control. Had to recalibrate my ESC to make use of it.
- noticeably thinner making it much more comfortable to hold for me.

Are u going to make a mold?  If u do I'd use as hard a silicone as possible. Smooth-on does about 50duro.  The two molds would have a lot of overhang and u want hard silicone.  Polyurethane is a pain for a mold. 

To fill it I like the black onyx stuff smooth on sells is super fast cure and strong.  Task9 is almost clear and can be tinted. You could put lights inside.

I didn't watch the video above but making a two part mold is good for almost any shape and easy. And fun

No also in the uk so different suppliers just none here at the moment so yellow it is. Also any tips on how you designed your controller to fit all the extras under the case. As I have a controller that I'm doing a similar thing with modding it into a 3D printed case. Going to try and keep as low profile as I can. The pcb board on mine is a lot wider than the gt2b so no point in even trying yours even though it's nice.

Oh yes, UK will be different supplies. 

What controller are you using? Just sit down with the PCB and see if there is anything you can take off of it. Grab a pair of calipers and measure the width of the PCB then go from there?? just make room for whatever you want under the PCB. It took many... many hours and lots of filament to get the v1 Mad Munkey. I believe its the smallest GT2b mod.

It's a cheap controller I got with a car I brought think it's ansmann 2.4ghz and stuff with fail safe so should be fine. Did normally use 8 aa batteries but brough a cheap 3s lipo to permanently put in the controller should be smaller with that. There's not much on the board I can get rid of only thing I think I can do is cut the trims down lower.

The video is close and can also help you here with any questions. The two case halves are all the long GT2b screws. The third channel PCB uses one of the short ones. You will need to m3 x 20mm screws and two m3 nuts to hold the main PCB down. 

The two most recent GT2b's I have ordered have the smaller micro USB port and have not needed any resistors.

What brand is that light blue filament on the left?

The main thing I've picked up on so far is to make sure the battery is properly insulated.

I would say that is the only real difference, make sure you use the plastic when you took apart the battery to insulate the battery and BMS. PCB is the same cut down and desolder the USB. The nose of the trigger assembly just needs to be cut down to fit inside the housing. Then glue it flat after you have it bolted down on the PCB.

Glad I stumbled onto this thread.  I'm going to be upgrading my board to the GT2B controller.  If you are still considering making a silicone mold, I would take a look at my video for some more technical ideas.  Using a proper urethane will give you more physical properties than PLA or ABS enclosures (I know having just split my ABS battery holder on my board last night).  Maybe I'll do a mold myself with your approval and cooperation to show the process.  :slight_smile:

So here is my contribution to the design.   Luckily I've been practicing on our new Form 2 SLA printer and ran this today.   I had run a set on an FDM printer and it looked good, but I had an issue while doing an acetone vapor polish and they were ruined.  So this is going to become a pattern for a silicone mold in which I'll be happy to share the process.   Crazy how good the resolution is and this is on the lower setting.  Took about 6.5 hours to print.   Now to spray some primer and prep for paint.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c89fbf9d38cdd1ec6c02723d02c93573f357e282.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b24511cad89ff7d0940602351d806e4dae75ec61.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/45962cf1e4c72fa126c95a57c34bf26669e37980.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Word of advice to people doing this mod, when soldering the potentiometer, make sure you desolder the board and keep the long prongs, i made the mistake of cutting the prongs to remove the pcb and when soldering the wires to the pot, the heat was too much and too close, now i have to figure out where to get a new pot.

I rode my board for the first time this weekend, and controller feels great.  I just have a couple of problems with controller, and see if anyone has thoughts.  1) I had to put hot glue on usb connector to keep it from pushing in when putting in the usb cable.  I think it should have some plastic that comes down behind it to keep it from going back.  2) Screws do not seem to be holding that good for holding the case together, and I think one has already stripped.  I printed in PETG, and am using the stock screws.

Glad it feels good. 

I super glue the USB in place then hot glue it. I have never had an issue with mine moving. 

I have never had a screw let go or strip. The first time installing them apply slight pressure to get a good bite. When the screw gets tight stop turning you will strip it. I am not familiar with PETG I only print ABS.

$32 for enclosure + $8 S&H in America. I just sent one to Australia last week and another to Germany a few weeks ago, both of those were around $34.95 S&H!

Are you still working on a molded one?

Where you able to use ch1 and ch3 as a switch for lights and stuff?

Yes I am @Titoxd10001.

I have the button working on my Mad Munkey and bought a switch to try on the receiver, BUT I haven't had time... I posted a picture forever ago asking some guru's if the wiring for the switch would work. I haven't gotten and answer. On the day I have time to work on my own things I can try the switch on both the ch1 and ch3. I would love to have my LED's on a channel 1 on a switch and cycle my headlight with the momentary ch3. 

What are you looking to do with the switches?

Cool looking forward to it

Yeah i disconnected ch3 without looking how it was connected. Well i want to connect some bright 10watt led lights and maybe a small horn. I have some switches for the receiver side from hobbyking that work well that I've used in rc cars. I used a step down voltage module to get to 12v. I have a fob with 4 channels but I'd rather control everything with the gt2b.

I you look up on post #18 I believe you just have to apply 5ohms when switched. I think I have the same switch, I have used them on my headlights for tricopter. I am also using a step down from hobbyking that has a 5v and a 12v line. 

What enclosure are you using now?

OK, I put together my enclosure last night but I mangled my USB port in the process.  I'm thinking I can just add a charge plug off 2 of the 3 pins left after desoldering the USB jack...?  I measured 3V off the 2 left pins, is the 3rd just a signal?

Valuable lessons about 3d printing are being learned right now.  The print of the lower assembly is about 50% completed.  On a number of the lower layers I was having some trouble with PLA warping and adhesion.  I didn't seem to have any of these issues last night on my initial test prints after assembling and calibrating the printer.  It was much warmer in my work area last night, and its a cool and drafty morning today.  I shut all of the windows around the printer and turned the ceiling fan off.  Looks like I may have done this early enough to save the print, the warping and curling seems to have been corrected and everything is evening out nicely.  There is a noticeable difference in the quality of the layers before/after closing the windows.  Looks like I may be building an enclosure for this printer next.

Ok, simple question (I hope).  Since I mangled my USB charging jack during installation I pulled the USB board off the main board.   So,  there are only 3 pins left.  What can I tap into for charging if I just want a simple +/- JST plug like this?  The battery lead has an extra white wire?   It's just a 1S 3.7V lipo so do I just solder to the Red/Blk here?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/0/c029f8775f0458c06361b39a64e8a2318af9fbef.jpg" width="666" height="500"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/3/b3abda411deafb2186094593350280b5369cb851.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Hopefully I can help a few of ya'll with the USB removal and how I do it. Not saying its right, but to me its fast and easy and comes off without issues.

First off I clamp my PCB in a helping hands to suspend it.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/3/e3cf4daacaa459c96e32a7506c1a1449aa85e10d.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Then take my snips and bend the three pins straight up. The straighter the better.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/e/7edb210b645b826aa979642a552d751be2e18deb.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Get some small snips and clip the pins as close to the board as you can get.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/c/dc7fa9ba6951cfd20fae8c484bd7ed8f0ded4455.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Now get your solder gun and feed it some solder. Enough to connect all three snipped pins in a puddle of solder.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/7/17defaf81e675418655bb91a028b40303f71ab9a.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Now that you have a huge puddle of solder. Position your solder gun so that you can heat up all the pins at one time. Let the puddle melt. Take some needle nose pliers and grab only the PCB of the USB. Don't squeeze the USB port. Once all of the pins heat up at the same time it should almost fall out.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/7/8742e9661e7685cf5a9693e12438fb6a025c2de6.jpg" width="690" height="388">

After that you can just heat up each pins solder and pull them out easily. 

Hope the helps a little in getting ya'll's Mad Munkeys together. 

Joel

I like printing on glass with kapton tape using slurry as adhesion. I don't ever use a raft, but always use support. If your printer is good with overhangs and you run it slow enough it may work. Let me know how it works out.

We have an Ultimaker 2.  Typically I just print on the bed with a thin coating of gluestick over the print area, but I do experience lifting occasionally.  I'll try out the slurry.

Are you guys using ABS filament or is PLA preferred?

I loved my ultimaker 2's...had to leave them at my old lab. Great printers. Try out some ABS slurry. Both @FLATLINEcustoms and I use it in consort with Kapton tape and get nearly perfect bed adhesion every time.  

I almost exclusively print with ABS. Occasionally, a print will require the use of TPU, or ninjaFLEX TPE but those are left to the [flexystruder](https://www.lulzbot.com/store/tool-heads/lulzbot-taz-flexystruder-tool-head-v2) [Lulzbot mini](https://www.lulzbot.com/store/printers/lulzbot-mini).

Woohoo!  First parts out and nearly perfect with no pressure casting.  This is just mixing the urethane, pulling vacuum to de-air the mixture, and gravity pouring through funnels.  Looks like I have the right amount and proper placement of vents.  There is nearly 0 flashing around the seams to clean up and once you file off the nibs from where the vents attached, the two halves fit right together.  I'm super excited.

Have you tried this mod since? after breaking that potentiometer I tried it with the steering pot unfortunately I hadn't read your earlier comment so broke that one aswell

I did make sure to heat the circuit as little as possible though, would leaving those leads on really make that much difference?

I also opened one up there didn't seem to be any visible damage the tracks looked fine and the wiper looked to be in place.

It should do the trick, just want to verify before I send the molds off to Joel.  Then, he should be in business :slight_smile:  Thank you for all the feedback, this is cool to see this technique is well received.

The company I work for makes these types of molding and casting materials, but I don't make molds professionally.  So it goes to show you can learn how to do this.  I do have a background in aerospace composites, but this is different in many ways other than I am good at mixing materials and using correct ratios of A&B to get good parts.  This type of stuff is very handy if you are 3D Printing prototypes and need either better aesthetic, stronger parts, or have to make many dozen in a short period of time.

Hi,

I'm trying to install the electronics to Monkey enclosure but the first problem I found is the dimensions of the battery. My battery is to big as you can see on the picture. I'm not sure if milling the material the structure can be affected. Do you know why my GT2B came with this big battery? 

Regards.

Has anyone gotten the other channels to work as a switch using the Mad Munkey case? I thought I saw something about it earlier in this thread.  Would it be better to use the steering channel (A) or channel C?

I bought a Turnigy RC Controlled Switch, which "completes the circuit when the radio channel passes 50%".  But I haven't had a chance to crack open the GT2b yet.  I want to turn lights on/off with a switch on the Mad Munkey, but I'm wondering now if it's worth the effort (compared to a mechanical switch on the board)

I have used that controlled switch on one of my tricopters and it works awesome. I have two for my board and Mad Munkey that I haven't had a chance to try them. The momentary switch should be an easy one to do that with. The steering channel would need a 5k resistor in line with the switch and should work.

The RC switch needs a power source (0-30V) to work. I am using a 12V BEC which is downstream of my power switch.  I believe you would either need an external battery, or move the BEC to the other side of the switch so it's always powered.  

EDIT:   The RC receiver would need continuous power as well, since it gets its 5V from the VESC

TLDR; It would be cool but not worth it

A layer height of 0.06mm combined with a slow print speed seems to consistently produce excellent prints for me.  Slow and steady wins this race.  I've never tried printing at 0.04mm though. Same amount of material either way

great video and great mold Troy!
When pouring most molds I've made Ive been able to get away with not using tape to hold the mold halves together and just the mold release works. It keeps the shape well and just a bit of an edge to sand off.  
I like the Mylar sheet for the pour funnel but id think you could get away with not using the many other air hole straws but thats me and I just dabble in mold making

The straws do 2 things;  they prevent a mess as the material vents and they also provide extra material to cancel out shrinkage as the part cures in the mold.  Also, depending on the size of the part, you want to restrain the top mold half because of potential hydraulic action.  On bigger molds this can become quite severe.

I would think you can add glow powders to Hot Pour urethane.  The hard part is that you need to add like 20-25% glow powder for best results so it gets pricey and the viscosity goes up because of all that filler.  It will also decrease tear strength.  I'm going to try them soon... how can I not!?

I did my mod today, but I might have screwed something up. The controller won't charge.
The thing is, I was doing this on my lunch break so I was a bit stressed and while not thinking after desoldering the usb-port, I cut off the small piece of PCB sticking out from the mainboard where the usb-port was located.

I don't have the piece that I cut off anymore so I was wondering if anyone know if I really screwed up or if it's something else that causes the inability to charge the remote?

Can I somehow charge the battery in any other way?

Finally got round to modding my GT2B as well. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to connect to my board anymore now though...

The remote turns on fine and seems to charge fine. I do remember pressing the Bind button several times accidentally while doing the mod but the remote would've always been turned off when this happened. What're the chances that I just need to rebind the remote to the receiver?

Any ideas for what else could possibly be the issue?

Btw I tried rebinding my controller today with no luck, it won't even bind now :/ 
I connected the binding plug to the receiver on the third channel then turned the board on so that the receiver light was flashing. I then held down the bind button on the controller then turned the controller on but the receiver light wouldn't stop flashing as expected...

Any ideas?

Did both of you solder to the pot quickly? I am wondering if you need to adjust the trigger black knob to 0 ohms for resting position before it would bind?

I'll have another play around with the trigger black knob and double check the solder points and see if I have any luck.

I've worked out where the issue is. 

It seems that I've somehow damaged the trigger pot when soldering the wires to it because I tried binding the remote when I only had the steering pot connected instead and I had no issues. I also tried testing the resistance of the pot connections using a multi meter and while I get expected readings with the steering pot, I get nothing with the trigger pot :( 

I guess these components must be quite sensitive to heat unfortunately, something for people to keep in mind.
Any idea whether you can buy these things separately somewhere?

Otherwise I guess i'll be having to order another remote... :stuck_out_tongue:

I did the same thing it's because you soldered the wires directly to the pot's pcb rather than to the metal leads you've cut off, the heat destroys the carbon traces

I've looked for them but can't find them anywhere @chinzw said the same

 I messaged a guy on ebay who was selling a bunch of different 5Kohm pot's but not this one, he said it was limited angle (50 degree) track but hadn't been able to get any

I ended up buying a second controller left the metal leads on and it worked fine

Yea sounds about right. I ended up working out how to use the steering pot in place of the trigger pot, just required dremelling down the pot shaft a little bit seeing as it's longer. Only had a quick test of the board so far but it seems to work great, probably need to adjust the reciever settings on my VESCs though as it feels like I'm not quite getting my full braking power now. 

The other thing I found is that you don't even need to cut the green PCB from the pot, seems to fit fine with it still connected.

The trigger pot has b5k50 written on it, while from memory, the steering pot has b5k90 on it so I'm fairly confident that they're both 5k, I'll have to check with my multimeter when I get home in a few days to be sure though.

I would have thought that the 50/90 parts of the codes would refer to the angle that they turn but they both seem to turn the same amount so I'm not sure?

I just made this tonight for my night rides running my pups around the 'hood.  Originally had my ProTac1L flashlight crudely taped on top, but finally sat down tonight and designed up a solid model for printing.  File on Thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2018698

Light snap fits on, printed in PETG at 85% infill.  2 small screws hold the mount to the Mad Munkey.

Big hi-5 shout out to Joel @FLATLINEcustoms for helping me troubleshoot my GT2B after I accidentally nicked a trace on my PCB board.   Almost bricked my Mad Munkey from my own laziness.   Long story short,  I didn't pull my handle apart when drilling pilot holes for my flashlight mount mod and I just barely kissed the board near the on/off switch.  Haste makes waste.   Now I need to add some more lights to my board. .. :)

This is all you need!  The R/C switch is great because you can even flash your lights at absent-minded cars

https://www.amazon.com/Turnigy-Receiver-Controlled-Switch/dp/B012W6RJ5I


Wiring is pretty straightforward:    
[12V+] -> [RC Switch] -> [12V Light +] -> [12V Light -] -> [GND]

You will need a 12V BEC.  Or potentially you could use the 5V output from the VESC with 5V lights.  Either way you need a power source for your lights and R/C switch.  I don't have time to post pictures right now, but I will be doing a build thread soon

Printed and assembled the mod. Pretty straightforward, great job @FLATLINEcustoms!!! I must add my ch3 board had those white cable headers that had to be removed for it to fit under de main PCB. 

Now something that might have happened to other people. If I tighten the screws on the main board, the remote will power up in bind mode, as if the bind button was pressed. Something must be making some contact when the board is pressed down, Im guessing something on the ch3 board or so.  The battery has been protected.

I'm getting also a bit of interference on the trigger as if it's touching something, no big deal.

Take a look at your receiver, and you'll notice is says Bind/CH3...  You use the included "loop key" with the pokey stick in combination with CH3 button to bind.  But you shouldn't ever really need to do this since they come paired from the factory

unless you're printing at like 20mm/s and less than 0.2 layer heights....honestly i'd do higher speeds at .2 layers and just acetone smooth the end result if you use abs or ASA (which you should, rigid ink's asa is just straight up better abs)

I hated printing with ABS until I started using Wolfbite:  http://airwolf3d.com/shop/wolfbite-prevents-3d-printed-parts-from-warping 
You need a heated bed since it is a heat activated adhesion promoter, but for $20 it will last you forever and save you many more $$$$ in trashed parts.  Seriously, this works.  Forget hairspray, ABS/acetone slurry, tape, blah-blah.  Get a bottle of this stuff and forget about it.  I have also finally been able to print Nylon, Polycarb, PETG.... and no more parts peeling off.  I know the genius who developed the technology (he's a professor at Cerritos College and a 3D printing guru) but other than that I have no ties to sales of this stuff.  Just want to spread the good word.  :slight_smile:

I will agree that if you find a bed adhesion method that eliminates warping, ABS becomes way more palatable because it's super hard to string or ooze

I'm working on my second badwolf enclosure and was wondering how do I mount ch 3 for lights? And also How did you secure the USB port and the trigger, with hot glue or different glue or tape?

@Titoxd10001 I am not sure how the BadWolf uses the CH3. I don't think there is a place for it. 

On the MadMunkey the CH3 is on the back. I use my controller in my left hand which places it in a good spot for my thumb. As for the USB I super glue in place to align it where I want, solder the wires on then hot glue around it. The trigger is held in by a long screw through the main board.

@Titoxd10001 remove the white connectors and and solder the wires directly on the back. Then check post 218 and cut the board. 4 buttons should have printed with the Mad Munkey. Sand those down and clean up the hole on the back of the Mad Munkey. Make sure the button rests in there without constriction. Take one of the shorter Mad Munkey screws and screw down the board button down.

Little trick : use the pads from the battery dissaembling on the CH3 PCB.
Thus, the main PCB will maintain the CH3 PCB avoiding it to be pushed while pushing the CH3 button.

Not sure I'm clear, so here's a picture :slight_smile:

@FLATLINEcustoms if you plan to upgrade your Mad Munkey, it would be nice to add routes to receive the solders of the CH3 PCB.
Because of those, it's not possible to completely screw the PCB. And if so, the opposite end of the PCB (the cut one) goes up making impossible to push the button.
Or maybe I'm mounting it in the wrong way.

Not sure to understand what you mean.

I use a hobby knife (scalpel) to wide a bit the hole making sure the button slides smoothly.
Then I tighten the PCB but solders act like levers, so the more I screw the top end of the PCB, the more the bottom end lifts up.
So I tighten until it starts to lift up and then I put the piece of pad. ;)

Dremel the enclosure ? Yes, probably the cleanest solution.
Anyway,I keep the piece of pad. It makes me sure that the main PCB won't short with the CH3 PCB. :wink:

Thanks for the upgrade. I have maybe another one : could you close the holes under the CH3 button ?
Actually, using the CH3 original screws is enough to tighten the main PCB inside the enclosure.
That + the holes a bit narrow (to let the screw create its own thread), it would be perfect !!

It's perfectly sized when you pass through with you screw and tighten a bolt at the other end, right ?
Because, I'm not tighten the main PCB in the same way.
 I use the original screw of the GT2B ("auto-drill" screw). It creates its own thread in the plastic.
So I have 2 holes on the other side as I don't use bolt.
BUT the point is in my way, holes are a bit too wide and the screw is not so tighten.

Arf, I should post pictures...

I got ch3 working thanks for help. I messed up the throttle pot chip when soldering any tips on how to solder second one? Also do you add anything to limit up travel because ESC doesn't register brake towards the end?

Its probably the print quality but I had to add a little trench where the throttle spring moves because I was getting binding. For v2 a little slimmer would be nice to wrap hand around easier. Also a little piece of plastic where the bottom opening of throttle is sort of how the gt2b controller has so fingers won't get caught up (maybe remove bottom one where screw goes in and leave that one flat). Just suggestions it's great as is.

I've never had issues on the pot, but some people do. just try and keep as much of the metal from the PCB as possible. Maybe just unsolder the PCB quickly from the board? 

Can you adjust the throw on your ESC? I don't limit mine, I just can't go full stick or my VESC over voltages. 

I will check the spring trench, and also I love ideas. Everything is life can be improved. As for slimmer... That thing is as slim as I could get it without opening some holes. So maybe I can get it slimmer. I've noticed my middle finger under the throttle maybe a nub there.

I think my mistake was removing the legs to PCB I won't do that next time.

I don't think it's over voltage I think the ESC can't read the pulsewidth. My hobbywing max 8 seems fine, but the vesc and xerun I had to limit up travel. If you look on gt2b the case limits up travel. Probably if the madmunkey was closed in the upper spot would do the trick. It's about 3mm that need to be stopped. I thought it was over voltage when I had badwolf enclosure but I glued a piece of plastic to stop brake trigger and problem solved. To much brake travel was also causing the min and max pulsewidth on vesc to not matchup so I couldn't get a 50% in neutral but with limited brake travel it lined up.

I heard about the brake issue also with french guys who owns a mad munkey.
I think it's all about configuring the ESC.

For the pot, don't de-soler anything ! Some guys burnt the brittle pot because of the heat. Just cut the extra part of PCB, bend it towards the pot and it fits fine (see picture on the link above).

Printed with PETG.  Used the cooling fan and had some layer bonding issues, now I print without it with great success, but the controller is still working so I haven't re-printed it.

Used that little volt meter thing, it was pretty dim (by design) so I contacted the guy on ebay who sells it.  He told me to replace the R1 43K resistor with a 10k resistor I salvaged from an old usb reader board and that made it a lot brighter.  I poked around on the circuit board until I found a 3v power source that was switched and soldered the positive to that.  So it turns on and off with the main switch.

A simple ratio suggests it would be 344 uA, or 0.000344 A.  So unless I'm doing my math wrong, at that current it would take about 100 days to fully drain the 800 mAh battery

I think your answer is in hours:  (0.8 A-hr)/(0.000344 A) = 2325 hours = 97 days

By contrast, the standard resistor on the battery gauge would take more than 400 days to fully discharge the GT2B's battery

@FLATLINEcustoms check it out! I redesigned your remote into a banana shape 

Or maybe I had some major warpage.  One of the two

Having tried it both ways, I think facedown is the way to go. This wasted way too much filament and the support structure would be a pain to remove.  At least the logo looks cool, even if this print was like my 12th failure :sweat_smile:

I did the mod and am really happy about how it feels (Thanks for sharing this awesome case @FLATLINEcustoms) 

After doing the mod the remote wouldn't connect anymore so I spent 4 hours researching to troubleshoot the problem, i got it fixed though. 

Turns out you dont need to take off the little pcb on the throttle (but some pictures is various threads show assembled mad munkeys without the pot pcb so thats whY took it off as well. Some people damaged their throttle pots with too much heat from the soldering iron which means you have to buy another Gt2B just for a new pot, i was afraid I had done the same. Save yourself the trouble, leave the throttle pot PCB as is. In my case the pot was fine but I had done a poor soldering job that was good enough for getting normal readings on a multimeter, but not for the remote to work (the reason why I couldnt find this problem so easily). Either way, resoldering the pot connections fixed the problem.

A lot of people rip off their antenna when disassembling the gt2b, be careful and take your time when you take the gt2b apart!

Be very careful when soldering that all your connections are solid and there are no solder bridges. 

Dont mess up the USB re-wiring (dont flip the wires or something)

If you glue the USB port in place with epoxy it should be strong enough, hot glue wont hold up.

Be extremely careful when dremeling the pcbs

I put a 680ohm-680ohm voltage divider on the steering channel (ch1) as advised for the badwolf mod. This apparently is not necessary, but it allows the remote to connect, even if you messed up the throttle pot, which allowed me to find what I did wrong.

Those were my tips. Dont do this mod unless you are at least somewhat skilled with electronics, otherwise I recommend ordering the whole thing.

Here is my Mod of the Mod.
Printed in Woodfill, I love that Stuff, it actually smells like wood, feels like wood, and you can carve it like perfect Linden-wood.

So i carved out a slot for a linear pot (pulled back by a rubberband) it can be used to utilize channel1 for servo breaking, really smooth and fine thumb acceleration,........and whatever.

For me it combines the best of both "remote-worlds" Thumb and Index-Trigger. and the 50mm linear Pot just gives a really long travel for smooth-controlling, compared to the 20° availeable on the GT2B Trigger.

So in case of interest i starte a build-thread:

I'm starting my mod, but noticed this solder blob on the back side of the PCB that's supposed to be cut. Can somebody confirm this is safe to cut out?

![20180426_211752|690x388](upload://mKqVuVEPOA0Gt4RZRwBLcydLO8C.jpg)

And this piece below, do you just cut the mini pcb off and directly solder the wires onto the pot leads?
![20180426_212708|690x388](upload://6dFMeg5sEgF7t6NhoI6OHhp5HRL.jpg)

Go ahead and cut it where you have your line drawn, but just a bit more to the left. Leave a little bit more of the board, in your image it looks like you might be taking off more than necessary.

 For the pot, I de-soldered mine and soldered the wires on directly. Be cautious you don't leave the wires too short though. Mine just barely reached.

I'm not sure about the buttons though, I didn't use them at all.

Here's a link to some pictures on Imgur that show the process I went through.

I can't get throttle to recognize on my vesc 4.12. Its bound - solid red light on the receiver. Servo wires on channel 2. On BLDC_Tool/App_Configuration the throttle display bar on the bottom doesn't move. 

I tried a servo tester and it works fine - the throttle bar moves as I turn the tester knob and throttles the motor.

Any ideas? Did I fry my gt2b board somehow?

On a side note, I had my first lipo fire :scream: You can use the balance wires of a lipo battery to power the servo tester (the leads fit together perfectly) and accidentally left it connected for too long. The problem is that the servo tester only takes  - and +, ie 2 out of the 3 balance wires of my 2s lipo, which means when connected for a while, it was draining only one of the cells, creating a large voltage imbalance. Luckily, I was in the room when I heard it initially pop, I grabbed a lipo bag, tossed it in and ran out to my driveway, where it subsequently engulfed itself in flame and smoke. 

Note to self, NEVER power the servo tester that way again :sweat_smile:

It turns out I dremmeled some important tracings off the trigger PCB trying to get it to fit :neutral_face:

Now I'll have to remove it and solder it directly after all.

But thanks for the tip to check the pot ohms. As I was inspecting it to probe with my multi, I realized the tracings were shaved off.

When soldering directly keep the tabs full length. And be quick to tin and then let cool down. Then solder wire quickly. Don't let it get to hot. I try and use my finger and blow on the connection to keep the pot cool.
```

I think I soldered pretty quickly - around 1 second touch with the iron on each tab to create a blob and then just a quick touch of the iron and wire.

But now, I can't get the remote to bind to the receiver, which previously I had no issue doing. I think when the lipo popped, it killed the receiver :rage: Damn it!

Check the OHMs of the pot. If it is messed up it will not center and in turn will not bind. Could be something else though. 

I tin the tabs, let them cool completely then solder the wire on.

Hmm, looks like I killed the pot. Getting 0 Ohms throughout the throttle range. WTF. I literally had the iron on the tabs for 1 second each.

I can bind with the steering pot fine.

Could you tell me what the ohm values you get on full reverse, neutral and full throttle?
```

## \#555 Posted by: aethyr Posted at: 2018-05-01T19:42:28.492Z Reads: 196

So it looks like I can use the steering pot. The range is just short of the full range of the throttle pot, which is at 50 degrees. 

But since the latest BLDC tool can adjust max and min ranges, its simple enough to adjust accordingly. In fact, I just tested and was able to get full brake and throttle ranges.

The steering pot stem is a bit too long, so I will need to dremel to shorten and reshape the cutout.
```

Yes as long as you can dremel the flat spot down some and adjust the throw in the BLDC you should be good to go. 

I have a steering pot in my eFoil controller. Only use throttle on that though.

Yeah, I got everything to work. Dremel successful. I was super paranoid about heat this time and dremeled only a little bit at a time, cooling the shaft in water every few seconds. And I had to flip the pot outer wires because the ohm values were inversed from the throttle pot. 

Mad Munkey finally finished and working! Thanks Flatline for a great design and help getting it to work!

What does blinking green light mean? It started coming and going away from me... but still works eitherway.

3 out of 4 lights are on meaning it's 75% full right

not sure if this applies.

On one of my MasterCho mod the green light would flash if I squeeze the remote and turn it on, still works perfectly.

I took it apart and played with it. the green blinking light had something to do with the main board touching the battery meter PCB or something , I added a layer of electrical tape to the board and it never blinked again. These batteries last forever!

Make sure the rear button isn't sticking in. Not sure it could do that but I heard that if you hold that it's the same as the bind button??

Anyone got one handy and could help me out for a minute? I messed up and reversed the polarity of the USB connection, releasing some magic smoke from the AP5056 charger (the black little thing with 4 pins next to the original USB port position). Now, after fixing the wires, I get full 5V USB voltage when measuring the 3 pin connector going form the mainboard to channel 3 button and then to the battery. 5V is no good for lipo batteries so I suspect Im screwd? Would be awesome if someone could measure the voltage on the 3 pin connector just to confirm (maybe theres a stepdown behind the battery terminals?).

Thanks!

Mine is showing just under 4 volts. The leads from that connector go to the battery protection circuit, as far as I can tell, it's only a protection circuit and nothing else.

I did the same thing. Fixed it by installing a 1s usb charging board.

Hi Joel,

Do you still have some Mad Munkey enclosure in stock?

My GT2b flying on the floor, still works but with lot of strippes :frowning:

Any pictures of a clear red/ smoked?

I was successful in printing some, but it would never be as nice on the curved edges, plus your molded ones look absolutely fantastic.

at least 24 hours.. if not longer.

i've done about 7 days in a row of riding without charging.

After I did the mod, I noticed the signal strength is really weak now. I can block the signal by just holding the GT2B up to my chest whereby my body is blocking the signal going down to the board. I've had some sketchy acceleration bumps and breaks from losing signal. Now I'm afraid to ride my board...

You might have broken the antenna wire from the PCB. It's quite flimsy. I have personally broken the shielding solder joint one time..
