Hello. First of all, I would like to thank all the members on this forum. It is a very welcoming, and has a lot of useful info. I started to get pats, but I have a lot more to do. So far, I have a maytech VESC, caliber 2 trucks, a DIYE motor mount, bearings, a deck, and kegel wheel, as well as a 10s 2p battery. I am planning to use an sk3, and the torque boards pulley kit. I am open to advice, especially on the pulley kit, and enclosures. I want to keep the rest of this relatively inexpensive, but do not want to sacrifice quality. Thanks for Taking The Time To Read This

You can literally file the shaft with a freaking file in 5 minutes...... 
Sk3 is a freaking nice motor for the price and its got tons of power

You can file a key slot on that shaft in 5 mins? :face_with_raised_eyebrow: Never knew.

If you didn't know that you really shouldn't be giving other people advice honestly

And nobody said that he was going to use a key slot

Since when do you put a grub screw into a key shaft?

It‚Äôs mechanically best if you plant a key in the key slot holding the rotational position of the pulley with the shaft. You can then screw a pair of setscrews through the pulley perpendicular to the shaft holding on a pair of chamfered edge holding the horizontal position along the shaft. To finish it off, you can use c clips to prevent the pulley from flying out of everything get loose. This is how torqueboard and enertion intended their design. How are you doing it? Am I missing something? üßêü§ì

There is no point in doing it as complicated as that.... A pulley with loctite alone is enought

keyway and a circlip is the mechanically corect way, no set screws required. But as Fredrik pointed out, people have plenty of succes with just loctite. I personally would see what I have on hand, keyways are great, but you need a lot of equipment to make that happen. I tend to like press fits + loctite. Heat up the pulley, lightly cover the shaft in loctite, slide it on, forget about it.
