After 2 months with Evolve Bamboo GT I got used to the power and was desiring MOARPAWAR. So here am I with this plan:
1. [Solid Landyahtz Ten Two Four deck](http://landyachtz.com/ten-two-four-skull)
2. Double focbox, Nano X remote from eskating.eu
3. [Mechanical kit for dual drive from TB](collections/dual-motor-mechanical-kit/products/dual-motor-mechanical-kit) 218mm trucks.
4.
5. Battery, BMS, enclosure, charger etc from these guys @rok @koralle 
6. Some [bracket frames](http://www.riptidesports.com/backing-frames-104/) since I want to mound trucks under the deck. 
7. Lots of free time to assemble the whole thing.
8. ...
10. PROFIT!
Lets go! 

Got the deck and the mechanical kit with motors from TB already:

Yoyo mate in case you have the possibility to 3d print, ditch the nano X and mod a GT2B instead. I have both. GT2B all the way!!

Had to drill the plates for the countersunk truck screws (all 6 holes are the same now)
On the positive side of things got some Bronsons G3.
Did fuck up the drilling the ABEC core. Wheel pulley installed uncentered and only 3 screws got in.

Does nanox so much worse than gt2b? Or is it just slightly better?

The Nano X just doesn't have a high quality feel to it, which a nicely modded GT2B does. Connection with both is rock solid. 
Nano X is very jerky on a high power board. GT2B gives you a lot more travel so it gives you more precise control.

Does nanoX feel like evolve gt r1 remote? If yes then I glad I ordered the nanox 
I got kinda bored after got r2 evolve. Yes, the acceleration is smooth but it doesnt feel like that wild beast with r1 :)

Originally bolts didnt want to do through, so I drilled the core with the 6mm drill bit. Did first wheel just fine, but on the second wheel I drilled few holes at a slight angle. This caused some missalignments and now pulley isnt centered and rest of the bolts cant be screwed into the pulley. Will fix it tomorrow

Update:
Fixed the wheel more or less. Drilled for 20 minutes (this abec type core is tough one.) Managed to get all screws in and good enough centering on the wheel pulley.

Received Focboxes, connectors and remote from eskating.eu
![20180801_165522|666x500](upload://fZyhBMKNkyTuaplizjO6jdZqtvL.jpg)

Seems like i will need to do some soldering 
![20180801_165533|374x500](upload://kZ19f68n14cQczy4jQUIjzNRYAb.jpg)

Did order orangatangs 80mm since i've always wanted those orange beasts :)

P.S. afaik battery is done. @koralle and @rok are waiting for bms and ready to ship the battery, enclocure, charger. So 8-12 days and some assembly later I'll be able to ride this beast!

Edit: Flip-flops :ok_hand:

Now all the BLDC tool magic has to come in, but I scared even to plug the USB into the FOCBOX.
Might figure out the low voltage power delivery for motor detection.
But still dont know if i should plug everything and then configure or preconfig and then CAN bus the thing.

Ok, I did craziest thing. I rode the thing around the building. ![DSC_0235|690x388](upload://cIK3MRUQrvtxXM7GL4SC1Guq0gw.JPG)
It was put together with ductape, paper, no switch, just antispark xt90.
Stupid thing to do, but other than loosing 1 motor mount screw I learned smth:
1. Don't ever try to use TN v4 mounts without drilling holes in the hangar for the screws. Drill holes, apply red loctite. Apply blue electric tape for extra safety.
![DSC_0234|281x500](upload://rOWA1JR0VCsdghgquJ0hIZZzox.JPG)
2. Don't use blue loctite. It's for notebooks and shit. Not for eboards. Be a man, use red one.
3. BLDC mode is shit in startup and breaking. Sound is great, clogging is not. In general not that pleasant riding experience
4. I need to solve the wiring problem inside the enclosure. Xt90 and solid splitter are great, but not flexible. Also motor phase wires are WAAAYYY too long.

Do you have a jst 1.5 to 2mm adapter for your sensor wires?

Yesterday finished everything and did setup the vescs.
Tried to ride it at speed and did find out that trucks are WAAAAY to loose. As soon as I let go the throttle got crazy wobbles and met the asphalt... God bless helmets. 
Even tho I rolled like a champion still my leg got hurt to the point that I barely can walk.

In addition to that: crash bent my front axle :(

Why did you choose for mounting the truck kind of â€˜throughâ€™ your board?

Other than that it looks amazing :grin:

To get more clearance from the ground. Battery is double stacked, so not only I did mount truck like that, but I'm about to buy additional riser :)

Yea, I bought the deck before deciding about battery. So I ended up mounting the truck underneath the deck, making it reasonably higher

Update:
I did manage to fix the bent axle (more or less). Used long metal tube and 2 guys (both weight around 100kg). That thing is tough to bend!

Tightened the trucks to the max and did test ride again. HOLYYY this thing is crazy. I applied only fraction of a throttle the whole ride. There was no desire to apply more whatsoever. I'm literally scared of this board
Maybe motor settings are cranked up too high? My current ones are
 80.0 A 
-60.0 A
 40.0 A
-25.0 A

I did use red on motor mount clamps, so they wont EVER move :) 
And I might bought some shit blue loctite, bcuz its not viscous at all. It just drips form the bolt instantly

Sounds like a sketchy loctite. I have had some liquidy ones, but they did hold up well so far.

I hear good things about loctite variants you can find on hobby king, I ordered some TL blue versions myself there is a stronger and weaker blue version too.
