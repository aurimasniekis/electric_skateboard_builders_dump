So @Winfly and I are working together on a ‚Äúride prototype‚Äù of something so we figured we may as well post it here.

* Slightly modified Jet Spud... for now ;)
* Jet Spud enclosure by @Eboosted... for now ;) 
* G|Bomb SDF and Standard Drop
* 12S3P VTC6 pack using @Winfly's modular cell holders
* Caliber II "satin gray" or whatever they call the color
* No idea what wheels to use right now but temporary 107s, will probs go smaller
* 90 degree bevel gearbox from @MorrisHsu, allowing big motors on regular unmodified Caliber II without drama
* FOCbox Unity from @onloop, @Deodand & co.  
* Bestech d140
* idk what remote for now
* that's the whole kit 'n kaboodle folks

If you have a woodshop at school, honestly, everything you need to make these perfectly should be in there. Keeping in mind - that you making a pair for yourself cannot be equated to practices used in making mass quantities.

Anyways - just print the dimensions 1:1 on a laser printer. Buy aluminum bar stock in the proper dimensions (2.5"x0.25")

Hacksaw to rough length (or, a wooden chop saw can cut soft metals if you clamp, go slow, and use lube)

Glue on diagram with a glue stick, drill press holes, countersink same way, then round the radius on a belt sander to glued on diagram, finally, belt sander or palm sand sharp edges. 10minute project if you plan everything out and follow it

I like them when they work, they look and sound sick. My one issue with them is that there was too much play in how the gears were set up, so I made the suggestion to @MorrisHsu to change the design, which he did. Now the new added thrust bearing seems to be doing well and there is no longer any play in the gears at all. I've yet to take the new one out but hope they perform well.

and yes @b264 they sound like the future :P

One thing we always do on the Baja team I was part of is to run the new gearbox with valve polishing compound for a few minutes at low speed to set the gears, probably would help a bit, just keep in mind that all bearings will be ruined, so if possible buy some cheap ones to do that then clean everything and put the good ones

Are you going to use a thick gasket?\
Because if you don't there is no way you will be able to fit the enclosure with a battery this thick and the unity over the BMS.

Edit: Never mind, it is the double stack enclosure.
Edit 2: Maybe it is not. I am confused. If it is the SS how on earth did you manage to fit this battery in there?

not sure how the pinion is mounted on the motor but if you could move the pinion further down the motor shaft, that'll give you a large mesh between the gears and reduce the resistance.

I've really been falling in love with the look of the gear drive along with the narrow truck possibilites it brings... However, @sofu, is the general consensus that for the time being it may need some revisioning?

Also, earlier in the thread you said you preferred pumping on the calibers over surfrodz. Which type or SR were you talking about? I would love to have this drive on some narrow SR tkps - but is there a possibility that calibers may feel better? I just always thought a precision truck would be nicer at uhh, anything haha.

I have wide SR. 200 I think. I've yet to own narrow precision trucks but I ride seismic 45 (cast non precision) daily and they're fantastic narrow trucks. Caliber is approaching that feeling but feel just a but sloppier than seismic. I believe these gearbox may fit on aera trucks so when budget allows I will buy a set and test. 

We swapped back to the v1 gears and the performance was really great since now nothing was falling apart. I think besides the noise issue which could be a non issue and some refinements that should be done, the gearbox is pretty great.

5095 motors but they are just 5065 motors in a special can I reckon.

I haven't looked at it much

You can get a 63100 motor from aps

Yes you can. But they are ridiculous

You need to put some propellers on those motors. That would be fun.

They're totally different wheels. 110 formula is very cushy and certainly very comfortable but fairly "dense" feeling. The 97s feel very light and agile with just the right amount of contact patch and the rebound on the thane is fantastic

Well it's been quite the adventure...

Did the loctite 648 thing and let it sit overnight. Turns out I'm an idiot and the loctite dribbled through the gearbox and into the wheel bearings. Destroyed two perfectly good bearings undoing the damage the next morning.

![IMG_6723|666x500](upload://sVj2MYpB0Irv8EzWdzOqW10QOyn.jpeg) 

Took it out and did maybe around 4 miles before the left gearbox started dropping again at the hanger mount and gearbox mating point. Last resort, just redo the entire gearbox mounting.

Tried to remove a previously stuck and broken screw, broke the screw remover. Gave up.

![IMG_6724|666x500](upload://pz4aFaFhmJpB2ZbaKodWWxAKr28.jpeg) 

Got JB Weld and mixed that shit

![IMG_6730|666x500](upload://12tpUAFbSi8mEFny0BUKCWJBQ4.jpeg) 

Remounted everything but found out that mounting it slightly below all the way up would prevent inserting a screw, and also we accidentally bent the screw previously. Gonna get a separate m4 threaded rod and nut to work around it

![IMG_6727|666x500](upload://maL1RvrxgyktrAZS31SXhRhv9Hp.jpeg) 

Now it sits. If JB Weld doesn't work I'm done. @MorrisHsu maybe use individual mounting holes like the new marc mounts instead of a sliding mechanism?

They‚Äôre not really tbh but they extend the wheelbase in this case so it‚Äôs more stable. Plus the back truck is adjustable and the front is wedged which means I can run split angle

If you mount the front truck to the deck it is more turn able and perhaps you will like it a bit more. Surely shortens the WB again, but you should give it a try.
