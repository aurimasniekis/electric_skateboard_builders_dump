Sweet build... 

How did you find the space cell in terms of simplifying the build process?

It looks great if I do say so myself.

It works great for holding the battery's and vesc, great seal, great option for a first build. Saves a lot of time and stress/worry about screwing up the bsm and lipos if you haven't had much experience with it.

That is just me being over cautious about debris on the road that could get in my motor, the scorpions vents are larger then other motors, I have rebalanced the red band with black rubber electrical tape. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/63376b22cbdc8a2a1a3423253befc4847dbef727.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Motor needs to cool....covering the can like that will lead to a burned out motor ... and cooking that expensive scorpion motor would suck

I am aware of scorpion motors and how they run a little hotter then others,  the covering is an air permable cover and still vents very well. Currently watching it to make shure it doesn't over heat.
