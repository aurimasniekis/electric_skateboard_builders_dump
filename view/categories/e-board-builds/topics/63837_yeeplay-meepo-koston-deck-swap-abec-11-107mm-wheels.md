I've severely modified my, what was originally a YeePlay M1.

What's new:
* Custom 10s4p Samsung 30q flat flexible battery
* Koston drop-down downhill deck
* Custom ABS enclosure
* Abec 11 107mm wheels
* Meepo (new) remote
* Orangutan nipples (purple)

What's original:
* Trucks
* Hub motors
* ESC

I decided I'd try and fit 107mm thane over the standard hub motors to improve the softness of the ride.

I started by using a thin bandsaw to remove the original thane from the hubs bell housing...
Using a 6?mm hole saw, I bored out two of the abec 11 107s to match the diameter of the hub motors.
After that I basically used high temperature epoxy to glue the 107s to the motors.

How hot do those Motors get? I imagine that does not help with Temps

I'm running a set of those hubs with vescs set at 60 and they don't get hot at all.  Even in 30 degree sunshine.  
@darkkevind  Love that idea for the thane!  not sure if I could bring myself to take a hole saw to new abecs though lol  I'll use some clones but defo doing it

They get too hot to touch after a 30 mile ride... However they don't overheat and to be honest, I don't see how this amount more of thane will make that much difference to the temperature.

Alright probably after 30 miles they might be a bit hot lol  Try as I may I can not ride 30 miles on a board, shot knees and back. Maybe on the baja when it eventually arrives.

Yup, this one was first! :laughing: 

I obviously realised I didn't need to drill all the way through the thane for the ridges of the hub...

I do shit like that all the time.  Still a great idea though and I will be stealing it. I've already set up my drill press.  Got some old 90mm cheapos to practice on first.  Did they stay true balance wise?

Yeah, not 100% perfect, but good enough.

very slight but workable.  My jacob hubs have the same amount and they are spanking new.

What's your new top speed in comparison with the smaller thane?

Hey there. I just love with what you done. I actually wanted to try this but I'm too much of a klutz to achieve the level of work you done. I'm just in awe because I have a Meepo V2 board. It has 90mm wheels and I wanted to upgrade them to ABEC 11 107mm as well. Terrible roads here in NYC so the extra mm will do me a lot of justice. Besides that... meepo wheels aren't the best. 
I was wondering... would you be able to do it for me. We can negotiate a payment for your labor work. DM me if your interested ^-^

Awesome work! I want to do something similar with rubber wheels. I was wondering, did you actually end up with exactly the 67mm diameter after cutting with the hole saw? I heard that because urethane/ rubber expands in heat, it might be necessary to cut with a smaller hole saw?
