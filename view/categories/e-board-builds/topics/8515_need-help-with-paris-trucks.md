Hey guys,

So i have paris trucks and i need to file down a bit of the truck to fit my motor mount/clamp but i don't have a lathe to do this. What would you guys suggest as the best way to file a bit of the truck down so i can fit the clamp?

you should just file it. you can also put it in your drill chuck and spin the hanger and let the drill do all the work.

There are a few threads for this somewhere on here. try searching a bit. i saw one thread use a similar way but with a drill press. Also i saw a suggestion to use a washer with a size hole of the desired hanger radius. that way you can check the size and roundness where you are filing.
