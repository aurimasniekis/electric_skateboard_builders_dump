If you are running 12S I would go with a lower kv motor. Actually, I heard somewhere that @torqueboards 230kv motor is 190kv. Double check with him. If it isn't then @chaka 170kv motor should be good.

I'm running exactly the same setup your planning to build. 
12s/5000/25c Lipo
Dual TB 12s ESC's
Dual TB 6355/230kv Motors 
16/36 pulleys
90mm wheels
I'm 190 lbs
Performance:
Don't know what top speed is on flat but I've done 28mph going uphill. I'm guessing top speed flat is gonna be at least 30mph
Hill climbing is amazing even with 16t motor pulley and 90mm wheels. 
Range is good, I've gone as much as 12 miles and still have nominal voltage left.
For maximum speed, stay with the higher KV motor and 90mm wheels. 
230kv is a good balance for torque and speed. 
90mm wheels will roll you faster than 83mm and also will roll over rocks, cracks and debris better than the smaller wheels.
I'm also using TB's 2.4ghz mini remote. It offers excellent throttle and brake control and I put 2 lithium AA batteries in it back in December and there still going  strong. 
Here's mine:

At 110lbs, you should experience even better performance and range.
