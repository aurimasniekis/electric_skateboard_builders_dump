Less of a "build" and more of a "curated assembly" (I finished it in 20 minutes) yet it skates beautifully.  Stable, safe, fast, lightweight and most of all - fun.

It's not perfect - can still feel the hub, of course - yet I don't think I can build a more useful all-round esk8 for $550 in retail parts.

Even with the factory Verreal kit cleaned up, this deck feels stable as f at 24 MPH (all it can do).

That's the cool thing about this deck; 24 on this feels like 14 MPH.  

22 MPH on the Mini X feels every bit of 22, and then some.

Happy building :) and thanks @OllinBoardCompany, @donta42 and @Alphamail for making awesome stuff.

You would love this deck my brother.  It's not really my kind of shape.

The trucks are pushed to the edges of a big, wide, easy mellow Landyachtz' concave and the deck flexes perfectly for this enclosure.

Here's my review for your Hubbie hanger: makes the long rides feel like short rides (this is huge) and as a bonus, I probably won't die from an acorn anymore haha.

everyone comments on the "chrome" in the back :)   (mostly why didn't I chrome both sides)
