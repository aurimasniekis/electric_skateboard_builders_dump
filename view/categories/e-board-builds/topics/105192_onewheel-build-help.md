HelloðŸ‘‹,
Iâ€™m planning to build myself a onewheel but I donâ€™t really understand how it work so I would need some help. I went on Banggood to look how much all the stuff will cost me but I would need to know if I am going on the right way for the moment (I havenâ€™t included the batteries yet).
Arduino : https://banggood.app.link/EOQjuLdPa3
Motor :

MPU 6050 : https://banggood.app.link/FrbhZLzPa3
A module to find out if you are on the board or not( I donâ€™t know the English name) : https://banggood.app.link/edy3QCGPa3
Wheel : I want to use a karting wheel that a friend gave me

Can you please answer and tell me what to change/ improve ? What batteries should I choose ?
Thanks and have fun riding ðŸ¤™,
Bzyli
Sorry for bad English, Iâ€™m French

Hi @Bzyli and welcome.

I actually looked at building a DIY Onewheel but ultimately decided to buy second-hand instead. The complexities of the control and safety systems in a Onewheel make it really difficult to replicate.

There's a builder on YouTube who's posted a lot of [DIY Onewheel videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65Tv4kycUSg) but even with all of his time and effort it doesn't come close to the retail version.

If you're looking to build one as an academic/technical exercise then absolutely. But if you're trying to save money or just want to ride a ton, then I wouldn't recommend it :slight_smile:

Sorry to sound negative but I'm just trying to set expectations.

Cheers

Ok, thanks for the reply !
But Iâ€™m building this for the technical challenge, not to ride a lot.
Cheers

Okay, the first challenge is to find the search button on the top, right side. Then search the forum for onewheel threads...
The main one is a guide with lots of builds and resources explaining every detail.

Thanks but I already read it, I just wanted to know if the motor that I choose is ok to build one.

This is the link you gave to said motor.

Not sure who sells good motors in France, but I bet because all their boards got effectively banned that there are a ton of 63mm motors not being used over there. 

Try to find your local esk8 community and see if they have some unused motors.

Ok, I will search there, thanks. I edited the motor link

Yeah high KV motors like that are no good for VESC. Not that I see any ESC on your list. 

What were you planning on constructing the Funwheel out of? Metal rails I assume. Are you planning on belt or chain? And dead axle or live axle? Most good go kart tires are live axle.

Ah youâ€™re right, I forgot the esc, I will add it. Iâ€™m planning to build this using aluminum. I donâ€™t want to use a chain, I want to put the motor axis directly in the tire( i will do a quick draw when I come back home). I donâ€™t know what is a dead axle or live axle. 
Thanks your for the answer
