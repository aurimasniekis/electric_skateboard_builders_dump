I have the Torqueboards encloser but I'm going to reinforce the encloser. I'm also gonna run another 1/2" riser for a bit more clearance for the battery.

Cool, I’m building off the same deck and making an enclosure to fit so I’ll be interested to see how you get on. Is the battery single or double stacked? @Battosaii

So I had some time after work and I wanted to mount the Torqueboards encloser and I did not like the mounting hardware at all it looked sub par. I also read about how the mounting holes on the encloser tend to fail. I used flat aluminum stock cut drilled and shaped  it and layed it across all the mounting points to spread out the pressure. I also changed the scews to standard truck screws and nylock nuts so that it can't vibrate loose and if I need to remove the encloser out when I'm skating all I need is a standard skate tool.

Tell me what you guys think

Yea I hope it holds up well.  This deck does have a bit of flex to it, it's just a hair of flex I think this will help me on long rides I thought the deck would be stiffer but it's not as I imagined it. The tesseract deck has no flex at all almost like the Raptor deck.

You look like you weight as much as one of my legs beanstalk the EVO has a slight flex at my weight. Nothing bad though. Having zero flex it why I own three CF decks. But that will change

Perhaps the flex on the evo comes more from the neck and tail area where it is thinner?
The aluminium is going to act more like washers I'd guess and the parts where the bolts aren't probably won't do much. Perhaps some thin adhesive foam rubber along the length to grip?

So I was at the park last Sunday and had a fun ride with friends we got caught in some pretty wet pavement and his Bamboo GT got wet inside and fried the esc... :frowning: but my board some how stayed dry on the inside.

Also I've been using Remington Teflon gun oil on my bearings I love this stuff it sticks to metal and won't wash away with water forget the speed cream get this stuff.

I agree. The strip looks better and distributes the load better than washers I would assume since it's full length.

Yes full length. If you live in the US, Home Depot has these aluminum strips I cut them to length drilled the holes then I rounded the edges with a belt sander. I'm sure a hardware store should have these. I dont recommend steel it's overkill it adds too much weight and it corrodes.

So I found that the grip tape on the Evo deck is very sub par. It's already lifting in several places on the deck for no reason. Is there a grip tape you guys recommend ?  Not sure if I want to keep the all black theme or go with a color like red cause it's faster.

That’s interesting what you say about the grip tape. Mine arrived looking like it was stretched when it was put on with bubbles underneath. 
I peeled it off and carefully reapplied it but it happened again. Bubbling at the neck and tail. Still not even got trucks on it!

I like Black Diamond grip.  It's not so gruppy it tears the skin off your fingers but is still grippy enough to lock in.

I also ordered a fast charger cause the cheap 2a charger takes over 12 hours to charge from what I understand it's not always 2A it goes down as you get closer to full and makes it extremely slow. 

Also ordered a set of step brackets and another set of shredlight headlights. To try out 4 lights up front to increase night visibility

30q are rated safe at 20a as long as they don't get hot for sustained periods:

4p made of 30q would be safe to do 40a per focbox in dual, just make sure you don't use full amp draw for extended periods (more than a few seconds at a time).

So I have been wanting to try a pnumatic wheel set up but also make it pretty easy to go back to street set up.  I have 33t and 36t slip on wheel pullies like evolve I wanted to purchase the Evolve at kit. It comes with almost everything I need.

I'm pretty sure it will work I just need to replace the pulley bearing with a 8mm bearing they come with a 10mm also would need a longer belt. What do you guys think?

Arg ... :disappointed_relieved: this board is so cool !
It's nothing, but yes I think a bit of epoxy with maybe a little fiber on it to ensure.
(Maybe a full layer on the inside to reenforce it for the next time if you get some ... maybe also a carbon layer on the outside to finish and you shouldn't be anoy again ... or maybe juste by the scratch after)

Its funny isn't it?  i was looking for a deck that will give me fast controlled straight lines.  Part of stability is also center of gravity and the wedges and EVO delivers on both front but causing problem cause we don't ride on completely smooth road.  Maybe I should just put the battery in a box and put it on top of the board trampa style instead :stuck_out_tongue:

Honestly you should be fine you actually have alot of clearance, Ive put about 200 miles on my set up before something like this happened some on 90mm wheels and some on 107s this happened with the 107s lol but its part of the game it is a Longboard in the end stuff breaks when you ride it lol.

Im working on making the Evolve 7" AT wheels work with my board but I think ill only use those wheels for when im solo having fun or when Boosted guys come on the ride i dont have to worry about my range lol

Friendly warning Vbeltsupply has good prices but when you find what you need buy alot and stock up on it cause they rip you off with the shipping. They use the slowest cheapest UPS ground shipping that takes a week and cost double the price of the product. If they used USPS priority mail it would get here faster and would be cheaper for the consumer...

I had an adventure last night, my buddy asked if I wanted a night ride and we met up at Miami Beach around 11pm we skated till 4:30am with the streets to ourselfs we would stop every once in a while for food and drinks but no one recharged. In the end we rode about 27miles and we all still had power left. 

It was honestly one of the most fun experiences on an esk8 it was an adventure and so much happened.

if you are not careful with the throttle the board will come out from under you at any speed with these pullies

im using 16/36 with 107s, my lighter friends that are used to riding Evolves cant full throttle my board cause of the torque lol.

there are no hills in South Florida but Ive gotten up our steepest bridges with no problems never have i needed to use full power to go up an incline.

So some updates, my board has taken a beating in the last 500 miles, I got my encloser caught somewhere while riding and it's cracked I'm going to replace it. Some how my left front axle got bent a little so I'll be replacing front trucks @torqueboards 

I ordered 6 shooters from @psychotiller I can't wait to get them and do a nice little update for my board. Once I get home I'll take some pics of the damage.

I also want to regrip my board I may go clear cause I like the light colored wood under the stock grip it goes well with my Nimbus theme.

Got the new front truck on I got her to 42mph on the night ride and she's super smooth even on shitty roads. I have not installed the new enclosure because I'm waiting for the 6 shooters. I did buy a set of extra tires from another forum member @bimmer and they just arrived. 

![20180427_123447|690x335](upload://n2ey4ZrlFkeSWixngDd89OjLNUh.jpg)

They are smaller than what I had imagined but this is not a bad thing, they also smell and feel like car tires. I can't wait to try these wheels. 

Btw what's max tire PSI you can use on six shooters cause these tires say max 70psi if that's true I'd be amazed lol

I’ve got a falcon 36 that I’m thinking of doing a similar build with. Since you’re still struggling with clearance with 107s, think it would be wise to do a 12s3p single stack and get a higher quality enclosure from another distributor? Just need to make sure the TB battery would fit length wise, I haven’t measured the flat part of the deck yet but I believe the wheelbase is 26.5”. 

Awesome build by the way!

Just sick.. I have a single 6374 12S3P and the power is more than enough for me.. The acceleration is impossible to handle without reducing the throttle curve (at least on my board - I got 76mm Wheels and a 1:2,5 gear ratio - maybe thats why).

Maybe one day, I'll be in Florida and join a group ride with you guys and hack all your bt modulus and make the top speed like 25mph then I could enjoy a calm group ride :joy: 

Well thanks for the help man!
I had a single drive that skipped (Bad alighnment etc) and was thinking about chain drive,
Now I can calmly go dual motor belt drive.

At that speed I would be worried that your tyres could burst from high pressure etc.

Well, I'll have to keep an eye out for cheap flights, Make my brother a good esk8, Get a drivers licence because distances in the states are so big that you'd need 2 drivers.

Edit: Dang flights to NYC only cost 120e (at cheap times)

It's not too bad. Ill have my current board to ride and lend out once I finish this board. 

It's a arbor deck with evolve trucks, a 12s4p and dual 6355 it's pretty quick.

6 shooters like the same suggest use 6" nylon belted tires. They last quite a while and can handle high speeds.

Hi Battosali,
Fairly new to the esk8 scene but already looking to build a board with long range and after following this thread just wanted to ask if you could give some advice on the type of bms, motor controllers that can handle a 12S8P battery pack. Any help would be much appreciated.

Cheers

Maverick
