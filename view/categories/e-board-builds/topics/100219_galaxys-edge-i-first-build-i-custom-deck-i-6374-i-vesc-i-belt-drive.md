Ive been wanting to build an esk8 for a while and a summer job before college was the perfect funding opportunity to get started. I made a deck out of some scrap 5/8" plywood I found in my garage.

I stripped the stain off after I cut it and following this tutorial I added fabric and fibreglass to the bottom. My next step is to poly the whole board for waterproof/UV protection.

I ordered trucks and wheels off amazon as I was originally gonna keep it manual and convert later so I purchased flywheels knowing I was gonna need them. Im gonna be commuting around a college campus. Im gonna be in Florida so humidity and rain will be issues. Id like 7-10 miles of range and 20-30 Mph is probably good. Currently Ive been compiling a parts list and id like to know whether or not I'm on the right path in terms of my build. 

Trucks/Wheels: [Longboard 180mm Trucks Combo w/83mm Flywheels + Owlsome ABEC 7 Bearings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B08HCOM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

ESC: [Torque ESC BLDC](https:///products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller)

Mount: [Boardnamics Universal Mount with Idler Tensioner](https://boardnamics.com/product/paris-universal-motor-mount-with-idler-tensioner-regular-edition/) (Its hard to see in the picture of the trucks if this mount will fit This might change)

Pulley: [36T ABEC Pulley 12mm Combo Kit](https:///collections/featured-items/products/36t-abec-pulley-combo-kit)

Remote: [TorqueBoards 2.4Ghz Mini Remote Controller](https:///collections/remote-controller/products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller)

Power switch: [DIYE Electric Skateboard Power Switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MTLV55T/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2MAPM9P562WJD&psc=1)

Im still doing my battery research but so far I'm thinking to use 2 5S 5000mAh wired in series. 

For the enclosure i was planning to do something custom, I have lexan that I can fold and work with.

This is my first post so I hope Im not doing anything wrong :grimacing:
