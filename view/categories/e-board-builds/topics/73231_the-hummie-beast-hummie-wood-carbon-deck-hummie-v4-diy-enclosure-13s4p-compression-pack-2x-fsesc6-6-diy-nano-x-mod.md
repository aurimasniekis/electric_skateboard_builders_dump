Disclaimer: this is my personal build. not the hummie complete.

The need for speed is real. Unsatisfied with my 10s4p Sanyo 18650RX voltage sag, low top speed and short range, I made a few upgrades. (basically everything but the hub is new :rofl:). Thank you @hummie for this beautiful deck. we will work on yours together soon.

CNC mod for enclosure. with curves to match the concave and flex of the deck. 2 piece enclosure b/c im tired of removing all the screws to check the electronic compartment.
![image|690x339](upload://gYCmEfWX1Hf1lUYDyjlXgd1uwZ0.jpeg) 
The mod came out excellent but vacuum form did not, overcooked the abs a little and left some nasty marks trying to push the abs into the groove with a glove on. I need to drill some hole to pull the abs down to the groove in the middle. I will probably do a CF one in the future. 


Here's the internal. super crowded. not even have enough space to fit the ppm receiver with it's case on. look at those beautiful cell holders tho. im using a few different revision of them cus i dont want them to go to waste.

enclosure is held on by m4 screws with aluminium fender washer and m4 hardwood insert

where's the bms???
![image|333x250](upload://mgHXQPgxyf1f9K2leUhvXTNZsNe.jpeg) 

there it is. underneath right under the big caps. I even have to take off the bms heatsink to fit it in. dw it's bypassed so won't need it anyways

Bridging to complete the split 4p

padding under the cell holders and on the enclosure

Nano X mod (with deadman switch) not the best ergonomic but too lazy to design a better shape atm.

@Colson003 bms is already linked. You just need to click on it.

 @Lunasi from calculator it's has a top speed of 29-30, but that'sassuming 75kv. I need to check the actual kv on these hubs. Ive some telemetry from BEASK8 groupride up to twinpeak in SF today. Using regular HM-10 with ackmaniac app. there are a ton of small files and really hard to read.  I did about 28 top and hit 31 at one point. didn't full throttle at all the entire ride. I was getting speed wobbles so i need to swap up to some riptide bushing.

@ethel is gona send me a video of me bombing up the hill and it wasnt even full throttle. definitely more speed and torque than i can handle atm

@mishrasubhransu yeah I went over kill on the braid. better safe than sorry. I will make a better update on that post later tonight. I just got back from the groupride and tired af atm.

yeah :rofl: I am just taping them down so it wouldnt get between the cell holders and the enclosure when i close it. a temporary solution I will properly secure the wires down later.

YESSSSS 13s! Very interested to see if flipsky can take it.

I'm hitting just under 30mph on my 13s voltage (15s A123) build. Want to try 90mm wheels for a touch more speed if hummie gets to it.

Riptide got rid of the hint of wobs I got on stock bushing.

I didn't charge my battery to full cus I was afraid of blowing. And like to preserve battery life. Charged up to 52v so 4v per cell. 

The flipsky handles it well but it does have braking issue. I am getting the same thing as @rey8801. Using can bus and BT module on 6.4 ackmaniac firmware. Under no load with the board flipped upside down, it exhibit a weird behavior where the slave does not break and kept spinning at low speed. I had the battery min set at -12 and it worked perfectly for a good 7miles. Then I turn it off for a good hour and back on again and the break was completely gone and I can even feel a little push on full brake. It's fking weird cus it was just a simple power off and on. I checked all the wire connections but it was still doing the same thing. I ended up bumping the battery min to -20 to get my brakes back. More testing on the 6.6 needed to identify the problem and it's behavior.

Yeh I perfectly know the issue. In my case I increase motor min so for instance from - 50A to - 60A and then battery min to - 11A. For me these settings are working now. I think Flipsky 6.6 handles regenerate braking differently.

I was already at -60 and -12, so I had no choice but higher. I think I'll slowly step up to 100/-100 to see performance changes.

I still have no clue what happened last week but the breaking issue is gone. I didn't change any settings but I did moved the location of the HM-10 cus I needed better signal. I had it sandwiched between the 6.6 and hummie deck (carbon top). Still running ack FW 60/-60 motor 40/-12 batt. I live on a hill and goes down the hill every time I skate, part 14% part 16% part 11%, and it takes at least 30 seconds to go down depending how fast I wanna go. (usually slow cus the bottom is a pretty busy interception with 5 way stop signs) braking has been no problem for me, it is quite sensitive but it could be my remote or throttle curve. I'll adjust that over this coming week.

@rey8801 how are your dual 6.6 singles doing?

After I increase the reg breaking compare to vesc 4.12 I have good breaking force now. It's fine for me. Only issue left is the wrong voltage readout that is always off compare to the real one. It is a known issue with this VESC.

First Ride with metr. didnt charge to full so ran out of battery before twin peak.  painfully walked up the hill. and then regen as much as possible but still pushed 10 blocks to the next charge stop.

Is this data from one or both escâ€™s?

Edit: itâ€™s two or you have a new monster battery 

Looks really great, motor current even peak is lowish, and consumption is really great for the speeds you are riding

Wouldn't say that the avg measured is accurate since I did walked and pushed a pretty l Iong distance. I was charging between 240 and 315 with a 3amp charger. The hubs did get heat up a lot when after doing 25 on that big hill before the charge though. I think it's between the cold sag and hot hubs that top me at 25 uphill atm.

Hi! I got the same micro 13s BMS. Did you have chance to check if the battery is still well balanced? The form factor of this thing is amazing.

I don't think that one balances. No mention of it in the listing.

I bought 2 of the one deckoz recommended. First one killed a p group :( drained it to zero. Second one seems better. I built a splitter and occasionally hook up a smartbms to check cell voltages. Of course no room in the enclosure for the smartbms.

I also have one of those red water proof ones with the ph connecter, but that build isn't done yet.

@Winfly

Assuming you still have the same vesc6, what do you have the switch on? 3.3v or 5v? Not sure what it is for. Maybe for those fancy throttle lights thingy majig?

I just got the same Vesc6  for a friends build and not entirely sure how to set that switch. Thanks.

Hummie is unsensored. It's for sensor. Usually 5V. Vedder added that switch for robotics in case you wanna use different sensors.
