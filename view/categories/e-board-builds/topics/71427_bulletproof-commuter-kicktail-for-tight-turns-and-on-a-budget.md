Please shoot some holes in my build plan, I want it bullet proof and reliable.

**Needs:** 
-Commuter Board
-SplashProof/WaterProof.  Lots of puddles from irrigation on the paved trails here
-Reliable
-Range (real-world 10miles+)
-Speed 15-20mph is fine
-Single 6355 belt drive
-Kicktail Downhill board
-83mm wheels (because of clearence with above board-style)
-10s3p (3000mah or 3500mah)

I live in a mostly flat city, Boise,ID.
I'm 170lbs.

Nothing has been purchased yet, but I'm about to pull the trigger.  
I'd consider buying used parts too, if they are in almost new condition.

===================

My PartsList: I've been reading all over the forum and there are many opinions, so i just wanted to tie them together all here and get feedback to build a reliable yet budget board.  I wont be cranking up any crazy hills so shouldn't be putting that much load on the board

**DECK**: Freeride Longboard Kicktail
https://www.skateshred.com/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/blank-free-ride-and-downhill-longboard-decks/kicktail-dark-walnut-deck.html
34 x 9.25 Kicktail (may be too short for my enclosure) 
Also thinking of their 36 x 9.5 yet like the more pronounced kicktail of the previous
Lots of 90degree and shart corners on the trails a traditional longboard would never make

**MOTOR**: 6354
Flipsky 6354 Kit (motor,vesc,nano,spark,bluetooth...)

**MOUNT/PULLEYS**: 
Torqueboards kits
(DIYE was crap!)

**ESC**: 
Flipsky FSESC 4.12 50A (from motor kit)

**TRUCKS**: 
Caliber II 50 - Gold 

**WHEELS**: Generic Flywheels
83mm Longboard Flywheels + ABEC 7 Bearings + Spacers

**RISERS**: 
1/2" (think i could have gotten away with 3/8 or less)

**BATTERY**: 
Custom ordered 10s3p Samsung-30Q with BMS/Switch/LCD/+ 4A charger

**ENCLOSURE**: 
BUD Industries: 12 x 6 x 2.5 Aluminum (Amazon.com)

**REMOTE**: 
Benchwheel + Receiver
(Nano broke on me)

**OTHER**:
Clear Grip Tape
A boat load of stickers

Thanks all!
```

Personal opinion, based on reliability.

Deck - Consider a Tayto? https://buildkitboards.com/collections/decks/products/bkb-tayto-31-deck
TB motor - the others are either crap or inconsistent
BKB push fit mount https://buildkitboards.com/products/modular-pulley-set?variant=12443524956254
FESC 4.12, best bang for your buck (not the mini) - Offer 20% under asking price to ebay sellers, there's loads of these floating around and people are unloading.
Get real flywheels or BKB premium clones - https://buildkitboards.com/collections/wheels/products/90mm-build-wheels?variant=5041515167774
Riptide tunnel riser will keep everything neat http://www.riptidesports.com/tunnel-risers/
Cant go wrong with caliber 2's, might as well get some bushings and cups from riptide if you get the riser.
Battery - LHB or Tiller, you can get an enclosure here or eboosted's from Jared for the tayto if you consider that.
Remote - Nano is a bit crap, mini if you don't live in the hood and wont get shot because it looks like a gun - These are bulletproof. Or any other 2.4ghz that's considered reliable. Maytech nunchuck maybe?

Finally, stay the hell away from Mboards. He's a clown.

Edit: Last bit of advice - You'll see I listed stuff and tried to keep the options all in one place. Trust me you can get carried away and order single items from all over the show in an attempt to save money. Soon you're tracking 25 orders, paying shipping and dealing with customer services from 25 stores. Same for wires, connectors and so on. Best advice: Keep it simple, get everything you can from as few stores as possible.

**DECK** : Freeride Longboard Kicktail
[/quote]

love the deck choice but you may need the 36 for the extra space.  See if you can find a data sheet which gives you the measurements between the trucks

[quote="SecrIT, post:1, topic:71427"]
**MOTOR** : 6533
[/quote]
Maytech seem to be the most highly thought of atm

[quote="SecrIT, post:1, topic:71427"]
**MOUNT/PULLEYS** :
[/quote]
Mount on a budget the @dickyho with idlers is a good bet
Pulleys.  15mm minimum on a single drive so no skippity skip 

[quote="SecrIT, post:1, topic:71427"]
**ESC** : Which would you choose for reliability?
[/quote]
Focbox if you want the best 4.12 but the HK 4.12 will do the job for less money  I use both and they work well
Trucks wheels and risers are all good choices

[quote="SecrIT, post:1, topic:71427"]
**BATTERY** :
[/quote]
This will get you the desired range if you go with 30q cells.  Charge only bms and antispark switch.

[quote="SecrIT, post:1, topic:71427"]
**ENCLOSURE** : Whatever i can make fit on the shorter wheelbase, i may have to modify enclosure
MBboards 10s3p enclosure
Torqueboards 12s4p enclosure
Diyeboards 10s5p enclosure
[/quote]
This where you will run into issues with water ingress.  
The 10s 3p with esc from mboards is the easiest out of the lot to waterproof and it is low profile.  You just need to make sure the length works for the deck though
TB one is big as is the diye 5p and has holes and vents.  Very deep enclosure too.

[quote="SecrIT, post:1, topic:71427"]
**REMOTE** : Nano
[/quote]

I personally don't like the nano for a shortish board, it too snatchy for me.  I like the benchwheel for its long throttle range.
Good luck with it my friend and make sure to post the build pics as and when.

if you're only using a single motor a 6354 will not be amazing just saying.
6374 would be better tbh

I've updated parts list above to Benchwheel and Maytech or TB...but may go with TB as I might get a kit from them.  Anyone have thoughts of Caliber Trucks vs the TB clones?

## \#6 Posted by: dareno Posted at: 2018-10-16T21:30:47.668Z Reads: 225

```
I use tb stuff predominantly because I know it and better the devil you know. Tb clones are realistically the same as caliber tbh.  There is a good argument for using a kit on your first build because it simplifies things and gets you used to the components.  TB is the best by far.  Just be aware the mounts can be fiddly to set up.  Once done though are fine and will last you ages.  Good quality gear at a good price.  
All the 4.12 vesc variants are the same tbh so the tb one I'm sure will be just fine, I've just never used one.  I like to advise on things I know and use not speculate based on other peoples experience.

I like the look of that short board, thanks for sharing.

I've updated the parts list, and the first parts arrived yesterday:
Flipsky motor kit/package
Caliber II's

Tomorrow the Deck/wheels will arrive and probably still a week out for battery arrival.

I may just put it all together as is and test the "cruisability" of the board setup with he tall risers and check clearance

Hey @SecrIT, had a few thoughts on your build. Love the deck btw. 
Waterproof is legit going to be very difficult. Not impossible, but difficult. Some things to consider:
*Bearings*. Gonna want ceramics for wheels. But also gonna want ceramics for the motor bearings too. @b264 what have you done to waterproof your setups? Are there any waterproof motors?
*Holes*. The less holes in your enclosure, the better chance you’ll achieve your goal. Fortunately with Bluetooth, battery meters are no longer necessary. There’s also push to start anti spark switches available now. That gets rid of 2 holes. Be cognizant of how you’ll route your motor wires, and the charge port type. 
*Gaskets*. Use em. When in doubt, use em. Search the forum for diff types. 
*Potting*. Never done this myself, but might be a good precaution to pot your electronics to further waterproof them in the event some liquid gets into the enclosure. 
My .02. 
Look forward to seeing how this goes :grinning:down. First builds are always the best.

Noooooo

Stay away from ceramics.  Just use Bones Reds or something cheap and swap them out.  Sure, water makes them fail -- but the failure method of getting squeaky first then eventually getting hard to turn -- is much preferred to the failure method of balls exploding and locking-up a wheel

I tried ceramics, full ceramics, and expensive steel, and I came right back to cheap Reds.  Just stick with the cheap stuff but not the SUPER cheap stuff.  Reds are perfect.  And always keep new ones on-hand.

Sorry I wasnt more clear.  The only broken piece is the remote itself.

The ON/OFF switch at the base broke and was loose in the switch housing.  
I tried to turn it ON and the lights (showing it's ON) flickered rapidly.  I think it bridged the internal switch thus frying the board.   If i have time i'll open it up and show the fried circuit on the board.  It's about 1/2" fried from the switch location up the circuit board.

Just a standard flat pack with a small charge only bms like the ones pictured. Roughly 275mm (10.7inch) length * 140mm (5.5inch) width * 20mm (.75inch) thickness. Unikboards makes a great enclosure for 10s3p setups https://www.unikboards.com/en/ takes a bit to ship to the states though. ![15130000511|280x280](upload://owW7PmVrvpQJkKe8YU4LweJinYb.jpeg) ![IMG_20171006_153656_01_01|690x361](upload://f1MWpQ69o0HOjUOWGGTm9y0sWsU.jpg)

I could have gotten away with a 2" height, but couldn't find one on my rush.  I like your setup tho

(added 2 more pics)

Case/Enclosure arrived.  Pretty happy with it.  Simple, and has the "L" shaped clamshell lid.

I think the best part is, the underside is sealed (well not in corners, but i can epoxy corners where the aluminum was bent up, so i'll never have to worry about water getting in between the board and how it mounts to board.  Plus with the clamshell lid, i can pop off for easy access if I ever need it.

I was thinking of just some weatherstripping around the lip and hot-glue/epoxy into the corners.

I really like that case!

I would suggest only bolting it to the deck with 4 bolts -- two on the front edge and two on the back edge.  That way if/when the deck flexes slightly, the box will stay straight and not try to flex with it.

I would turn the motor so that the phase wires come out pointing towards the truck baseplate, and then turn and go back toward the enclosure.  That will flex them less as you lean.

To add to this great tip, if you pack them with [long life lithium grease](https://hken.rs-online.com/web/p/greases/5178322/) like this one, they will take a lot of wet rides before drying out. Much less maintenance.

Product description

Molybdenum disulphide grease, for extreme conditions.
Super Long-Lasting Grease with MoS2 is a mineral oil based, lithium-type grease with very high performance, containing MoS2 (molybdenum disulphide).
Designed for bearings and assemblies using sliding rollers and bearings that are subject to high stress, in the automotive field and in industry, particularly universal joints (homokinetic joints).
