First, change the receiver onto the throttle port- it's in the steering port now. 

Also, recalibrate the throttle range. Turn off the ESC (with the switch), and hold the trigger all the way down. Then turn it on and wait for the tones from the ESC. Once it stops move the trigger all the way forward (to the max braking position) and see what happens.

P.S. Is it possible the battery is just dead?
