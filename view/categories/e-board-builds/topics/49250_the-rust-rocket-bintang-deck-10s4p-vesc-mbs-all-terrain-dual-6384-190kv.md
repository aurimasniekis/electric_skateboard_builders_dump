Okay.
I hope none of you remember my last "[build post](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/firstbuild-cruzurrr-maple-deck-caliber-sk3-168kv-diy-vesc-10s3p-g2tb/19520/24)" it was absolute trash. I had been on here for maybe less than a month and thought i could take myself to the stars. Tl;dr i didn't understand a thing that was going on. Couple months AND an evolve Gen 2 later, I present to you, ladies and gentlemen of this fine forum, Build Name TBD. 
Drawing Inspiration from These two builds; 
@Eboosted [Darth Maul](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-darth-maul-sector-9-bintang-dual-6374s-focboxes-12s4p-torqueboards-218mm-trucks/36845/47)
@trigger4point7 [Build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/build-bintang-deck-10s6p-30q-97mm-abec-dual-6378-190kv/44229) even though this is not complete, we've been talking in the DM's
HUGE SHOUT OUT TO @JLabs he's been the GOAT in helping me figure things out. Will continue to bother him yet. 

Some parts started coming in so i'll update as they do. Estimated completion is Late April/Early May. 
Some pics...

Got spme 16T 12mm Pulleys from @chaka at ollinboards, looks and feel like really good quality so i'm hyped about that.

![IMG_8482|375x500](upload://hUL4ySRJwjyl7dCs94LimKRQsGu.jpeg)
MBS Wheelsand Zealous Bearings came in, No idea why i got orange wheels but YOLO. I was gonna go for an Ultra Instinct Theme but messed that up with the griptape which i also love.
![IMG_8486|374x500](upload://jQalPTVlKx0nLOMjy0DWHHbDKZU.jpeg)
Comparing the deck of the Evolve and the Sector 9 Bintang, i can confirm these two decks are dimensionally identical, so, all terrain is an option if i ever decided to look into it. But yeah, that surprised me too. The clean bamboo makes it look a lot bigger.
![IMG_8565|281x500](upload://W17K1nX1sXtoI0qFqfopS3oxLX.JPG)
Quick Mock-up of the deck and wheels. those wheels are huge FYI! but yeah, i thought i liked the grip tape buuuut.....
![IMG_8566|375x500](upload://pIWFaWSMmD0C49FOHteTykKMAtb.jpeg)  
ripped it off like 5 hours later. i do spontaneous stuff and it's unhealthy.

Redid the griptape after watching a 5 minute video, first time ever i think i did an above average job, my parents are proud of me.
![IMG_8569|374x500](upload://uQMvvpHr47R0CvD6cjC5UzKJZus.jpeg)
Mockup with the new grip and i now realize i will just be a motorized caution sign. I like it though.

Welp, that's all for now, but expect more updates once some more hardware and the electronics come in. @psychotiller i'm keeping a close eye on your enclosure :wink: 

Adios

Hey there.

MBS wheels are great when they're shaved on the road but fine with the knobs too.. I would shave them but that's me... Build should be nice. 

Anyway @Eboosted makes an enclosure specifically for the Bintang you can find it here.
 https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eboosted-enclosures-thread/38073

But nothing wring with @psychotiller enclosures either... Just mentioning since when there are deck specific enclosures available makes building easy.

Okay so slight dilemma and i'm hoping someone can help me out here, with respect to risers.
trying to increase deck height a little bit so im 100% sure my motors don't hit on turns. Do i put risers on top as with the first image or at the bottom part of the board? thanks!![IMG_8789|666x500](upload://hmZUGFEUbFs6RrxAoGLvX1mwkCD.jpeg)
![IMG_8790|666x500](upload://6OOXXyF1oSAM8mAwk9cbDgDvGV0.jpeg)

Edit: or is it not possible to increase clearance + set it up as drop through

---
## \#15 Posted by: trigger4point7 Posted at: 2018-04-02T18:29:08.387Z Reads: 226

```
What I'm doing is getting thin spacers (1/8th in), mounting the truck on the bottom like a non-drop through deck and putting a spacer on the top to cover the ugly hole. Then you have more clearance. These are also a good option that I'm using to increase the structural stability of the mounting, though likely more for peace of mind than anything else.

Some more exciting updates;
Been speaking a lot with @JLabs and things are progressing very nicely in lieu of battery + an enclosure he has which is a good fit for the bintang. He also has some goodies he's lining up for me to "beta test" for him. 100% confidence in his abilities so i'll be dropping a review on all his magnificent work once it's in my hands.

I've been fiddling with mounting and decided to take @trigger4point7 advice and do a top mount, i got in contact with @akhlut and have a nice set of X-braces headed to me to cover up the ugly top mount hole. 
![15229311842551839044756|690x388](upload://s77HMa60kmIFWZSHUfVQcVac2tJ.jpg)
Will also give initial impressions on that but as before, i have no doubt in @akhlut abilities.

As with everything esk8 related, the wait continues! Good news is i sold my old evolve gen 2 yesterday :partly_sunny:

Update again! things are progressing quickly now and i feel this build will be done soon. It's exciting

@JLabs is done with the battery and he's mounting it within an enclosure for me before he sends it over. He's also been kind enough to install the switches, power port and voltmeter for me.  I'll keep everything updated and will document everything as i start to mount hardware. I also purchased motors from him so when i get those i'll share on here. I hear they're beefy and im all for it.

WHEW! 20 DAYS SINCE LAST UPDATE. BOY DO I HAVE UPDATES FOR YOU GUYS

AFTER DOING ROUNDS WITH USPS LOOKING FOR MY FREAKIN' PACKAGE *fu usps*, i finally found it in a mail center like 15 miles from where i was. expensive uber trip :confused: 

anyways...all's well that ends well. A huge shout out to @Jlabs this dude has been a freaking wizard throughout the whole process. Seriously, he went waaaaay above just being a supplier of many of my parts, He soldered everything cause he knew i didn't have access. He helped me organize everything, helped with vescs...list goes on. He's been awesome and i'm 100% overwhelmed and happy that there's guy's like him willing to help new builders on the forum. But don't go to him without studying first i'm sure he'd hate that. :joy: 

Now some build porn 

![IMG_9032|666x500](upload://gFCU7IHjvCIkTqdNjzqYcYvewGP.jpeg)
Basic 36v 2A charger. I'll stick with it to preserve cell life. Will probably charge while i'm at work or asleep. with this 10s4p battery i doubt i'd need to charge so often. Commute is a 4mile round trip.

![IMG_9027|375x500](upload://qm97f8S6C3LOMhf0BuElL2YNk1U.jpeg)
VESCS in the enclosure, Jared was very kind to label them as he did programming of them while he had them. He also labelled the motors so i know which is which.

![IMG_9031|374x500](upload://emnSTqckXpZ5j929PRqZxpY4GS7.jpeg)
Test fitting everything in the enclosure. Need to tidy things up obviously. Will be using cable ties, Gorilla glue and Velcro in multiple places. Also have some nice neoprene foam that i will be using under the battery and vescs for vibration dampening.

![IMG_9030|375x500](upload://hb5FPcWd8tlM0sryovIPHaGlS1L.jpeg)
Not much i can say. Pulleys feel amazing. Very solid and nicely grooved to really lock into the wheel. I'm using his standard *flywheel*?@jlabs pulleys and they fit like a glove in the MBS. 36T for a 16/36T config. 

![IMG_9033|666x500](upload://ffXWlXljtUCQrEUYSFR4GiDKDXg.jpeg)
These motors are Thiccc. Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. Thicker than Demi Lovato. Thicker than Thicc. They're also heavier than i expected :sweat_smile: I can imagine they pack a mean punch. Helmet on guard. Jared also went out of his way to help me extend the sensor wires due to reverse mount config

Yeah that's pretty much the update for now; will get to doing more stuff tomorrow. Already added the neoprene and will mount the battery inside the enclosure. It's an @Eboosted enclosure i got from Jared and it's slim and a perfect fit on the bintang. It's the 12S universal enclosure. I've got a USB port, Bluetooth Module, Receiver and all sorts in that enclosure and it all fits like a glove. 

More updates to come tomorrow. Will mount the motors using @Deckoz technique for TB mounts :sweat_smile:  Hopefully that works. I see a @marcmt88 dual idler mount in my near future though (June) :'). 

To Do;
1. Drill deck for inserts
2. Mount VESCS and battery in enclosure 
3. Attach Pulleys and test mounting configs
4. Braided wire for motor phase wires and sensor wire
5. Ride the hell out of this thing.
6. Set up bluetooth module
7. Race past all the eskaters on campus
8. Settle on a name for the build.

Till tomorrow :smiley:

Okay Update for Today...
Bottom line is i didn't do as much as i wanted to do, but I did what i can. Only had like 3 hours or so today cause of school and track and lots of other factors. Anyways.

![IMG_9045|374x500](upload://lFtT9VGL0ocNhVMqjN8t520ODgD.JPG)
Started off the day following @Deckoz tutorial to mount the TB mounts. Set them in place and prepped them for mounting like instructed.

![IMG_9047|666x500](upload://yvxcL5y0S5MMii4JtV0XkdOwBON.JPG)
Laid out everything on one of the work benches in a workshop at school. My friend was also working on his vanguard build as well...That deck really feels good

![IMG_9048|666x500](upload://gUjkVw98CG4JkLgQ4dsTrTpB5iQ.JPG)

![IMG_9049|375x500](upload://rKH8pbYDknynGZaaIBuLWdiHyOy.JPG)
This was the first iteration of my mounting process. Quickly found out that i had mounted them too close together so there was no space at all for the motors. So i unmounted and remounted.

This is what it ended up as...
![IMG_9057|375x500](upload://4fPRNWQbMUIk3nvn4tZqWqKaouI.JPG)
I don't know why the picture orientation is as such. But yeah, the motors are pretty close but don't touch. If i wanted to move them farther away i'd have to add some extra washers and such. Will ride around and see what happens. do you guys foresee any problems?

NOW FOR SOME ADVICE;
So Jared's motors dont have keyway slots but they do have flattened sides for grub screws. That's awesome. I planned on using blue threadlocker (262) on them and mounting it flush against the flat sides, I've seen some posts where builders said this held their pulleys very well without problems. Is this alone okay? I also have loctite 680 in the workshop and Jared said i could put it on the motor shaft...how much do i put? a dab or slather on the whole shaft? It's worth noting the loctite bottle says its expired but does that really affect anything? Any advice would be helpful! Also some advice on belt tensioning. Thank you!

Edit: also got wired up and tried some cable management. In the process of that...Bluetooth module connects nicely.

Not gonna lie...

I add two extra speed rings on the inside and flip my nuts... Otherwise the metro pulleys touch one side of the hangar. Where the other doesn't...casting imperfections.

Okay Update:
I FUCKED UP THE FIRST INSERT. Not too bad but i was using Psychotillers instruction. Mistakenly put the wrong bit in and well...you know the rest is history... I'm not counting on that particular insert to do any work so i have to make sure the rest are good. Will probably also drill one close the the fucked up one.
This is what happened...
![IMG_9063|375x500](upload://x7rxDoFjtn3FBdhd0q9Nc1t1gAQ.jpeg)
Any way to remedy the situation? If so let me know. 

This led m to generally worry about the enclosure fit on the deck;

![IMG_9064|666x500](upload://qZzjJ1yUo6i0deZm6K0AtiIMmJa.jpeg)
At the back there's a pretty big gap. Do i just have to press the shit down out of it or what?

Just tagging everyone who's been on this thread so far, incase any of you has some inspiration...


Today was not totally bad though. Applied blue loctite on grub screws and affixed to pulley. Also used green loctite on the shaft for the pulley. I think it won't have a movement problem. Checked alignment of everything and letting it cure. :slight_smile: will do motor detections and all of that tomorrow evening or the day after. Just to ensure they spin the right way. Rest of values are already set up.
![IMG_9062|375x500](upload://pzffWV9zf5uLACCeyKiY5ttVdFQ.jpeg)
Tension feels good and no skipping seen. When i test it IRL we'll find out.

It looks like you have the battery pushed to far back. If you love it up a little it should sit better in the enclosure. As for the motor leads, have a look through this [thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/show-me-your-backside/44000?u=jlabs). Generally the phase wires are mounted on the side of the enclosure. 

If need be you can get some thin weather stripping from the hardware store to add some height.

You can mix some epoxy thick and coat the sides of the hole, then use foam tape to hold the insert in place while it cures. It still won't look great but it'll do the job.

LMAO WAIT WOW. i didnt even think of drilling the side of the enclosure. That would make the wires come through very nicely. sometimes i don't think things through...smh

Also i will take your advice and move the battery further down. Will test fit tomorrow and show you all what it looks like. Gonna get up nice and early since i have sunday at my disposal.

@mmaner hmm I see, I had originally intended to just fill the sides with epoxy as well and also gorilla glue :smiley: but i'll go the epoxy only route and see what happens. 

Mental aches of DIY, but we learn everyday..

Have you drilled the hole in the enclosure too big? Or have you drilled the hole for the insert too big?
From the picture it looks like there is a dirty great hole in the enclosure no? You might get away with using the really pretty washers that @Deckoz used on his evo build. They're something like motorbike fairing washers?

Hey! Yea man they are called fender washers. :slight_smile:slight_smile: thanks @bigben 


@Ebisane9  your hole in the deck is to big,  just fill it with some wood glue or epoxy and let it dry.

If it's the enclosure, some fender washers will do ya good  and make it look perty

UPDATE. THE DAMN BOARD IS FINISHED. I now introduce you to...THE RUST ROCKET.

![IMG_9079-1|375x500](upload://32lxxjiDdk7okE8TZBrtqIagcZz.jpeg)
if you're wondering why the holes... I had this crazy idea to go with the name and make it look a bit shoddy. It was coming out too clean and did not deserve the name rust rocket at all. 

Anyways...Today was a big day..
![IMG_9072|666x500](upload://ujysOZ0B50ZY5nIjKdxMyvUY7gy.jpeg)
Started off with actually properly making some good inserts. So i did 3 inserts per side then 4 skateboard bolts. So 7 holders per side in total. That became pretty easy once i found the right drill bit.

I then mounted the trucks on the deck so i could start re-doing detection. Which @Jlabs kindly walked me through...again...:joy::star_struck:

Lined up the case on the deck. just to make sure i could press everything.
![IMG_9073|666x500](upload://nKperRFvG5oCG8lYyv1cOB6KCgT.jpeg)

More cable management done. Doesn't look managed but it is totally managed.
![IMG_9078|666x500](upload://lLs7uj71N4C1XVYatjDLt0kjXq4.jpeg)

Then i went on and wired everything up, locked things up with zip tie and mounted the enclosure on.

I went on a real short ride and holllllly. This thing is no joke, It hauls ass. I literally need some genuine love-time with this board to understand it. I dialed down the settings for now. (Bluetooth module ftw) It's a rocket and it's worthy of its name. I am super happy with how it turned out, this is a huge upgrade from my gen 2 evolve and i can't wait to properly get a hang of this thing.

Thank to all you guys for the help and contribution! @Deckoz @Jlabs @Eboosted @threebysix @GrecoMan @lrdesigns @b264 @moon @mmaner 

It's actually freaking incredible. I'm blown away. *pun intended*

What kind of pics do you guys wanna see? Of course i'll upload some shots from my first proper ride :smiley:

Maaaan! That looks beautiful! Congrats!

Let me shout a couple of recommendations:

Use thread locker on the enclosure bolts, but just after you dial everything and have used the board for at least 2 weeks, those bolts WILL back out, but don't use threadlocker just yet, you will need to open the enclosure several times before, otherwise you will hate my idea

Upgrade your pivot cups bushings with riptide ones

Use Vicious grip tape, your board will look amazing
```

Hey! 
Yeah i know about those bolts. they will no doubt back out. 100% sure as i faced the same with my evolve board. RIP. I'm pretty much done tinkering on the inside as i have BT module but if anything shakes out of place i'll definitely have to open up. Hoping that does not happen. 

My bushings are the riptide ones! :D i have KranK cone and Barrel in 93A. They changed the ride over my old shitty ones.

Vicious grip tape? never heard of it, will do an amazon search. Kinda want Black and Yellow HEXAGONS...

thank you @eboosted for the inspiration and beautiful enclosure design!

Alas the euphoria was short lived. Went on a ride today and my motor mount rattled loose. Unfortunate. I think part of it was my fault because i did not loctite it down, but i torqued it down real hard with this https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A50N9V2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
so it really should not have rattled loose, since loctite is "technically" optional.
@Deckoz what kind of loctite did you use? red? or blue? 620 or 242? considering just get marcs mounts but then i'd have to get belts and blah blah blah so i wanna stick with this since it works well for you.

I'm glad i was able to catch it as well. It was nice while the ride lasted, blasted past my friends with ridiculous ease. One of them actually shouted "That's not fair, I paid $1200 for my evolve" It was funny!

Plus adjusting the motor mount is very minor compared to everything else i've done for the build lol.

Yeah i also have 620(Red) and 680 (Green). I also have 242(Blue), any more loctite needed? Anything in general actually for a more secure hold? I already loctited my motor pulley so i'd have to be careful when slipping it off the current mount.

UPDATE

Ran to the local hardware shop and got some m8's. It never hurts to have a lot right? hopefully i never have to use them. At least not in frequent intervals....Anyways;

![IMG_9092|374x500](upload://3PKqTohxJw995rzGqZ27Mhy1wbI.jpeg)
Picked up some DUCTape to hold the motor wires together as i forgot to do my braided sleeving. 

![IMG_9093|666x500](upload://vpdIFAEnN84TMhW2fs0bZhQyoZU.jpeg)
I BLUE LOCTITED (?) EVERYTHING, this thing is mounted with perfection, torqued down like shit too. LIKE, this should NOT fail again. If it does i'm doing red, if red fails then i'm changing where my loyalty lies. i absolutely CANNOT be having to be worrying about this regularly because where i live has bumpy roads almost everywhere.

24 hours Later and loctite cured.
Literal 24 hours down to the last minute, i couldn't wait :joy:
I gotta say. The loctite honestly seems to have done the trick *knock on wood* I went on some pretty rough routes today and i was honestly scared of the mounts vibrating off but they stayed solid. I still ran through them with a little more torque when i got home as a regular check up kind of thing. 
Some stats from today
5.08 Miles
Max Speed: 27.1mph
Average: 13mph
drawn wh: 45
Average wh: 8.48

I can confidently say that i'm gonna get some nice range from this thing. Voltage dropped from 40.8v to 38.8v very solid.

VESC SETTINGS;
Motor Max 50A
Motor Min -60A
Batt Max 30A
Batt Min -6A
Cutoff start:32v
Cutoff end:28v

Will probably tweak some of these values for more power. The top end acceleration of this board is crazy nice, just when you think it's done it keeps pushing. Eats all hills, accelerates up them easy.

Update;
I went out on a ride today and noticed some weird sound coming from the motor plate. The mount is hooked up fine and i don't think belt tension is bad, see video for what the tension is like, but there's just this in and out movement on the mount when i am acceleration or carving to the right. I'm not sure if it's the pulley of if my bearing is shot/core is bad. No idea what it could be. see video for reference. I don't think it's normal as it wasn't doing this before. Only thing i changed on both motors was the angle that they sit at. I angled it a little bit more towards the deck for more clearance.
Any help is appreciated

![05 PM|690x193](upload://vcm6eYgnpw0SEwN0pNQzv5tOGMF.png)
Weirdly, I went over my motor max limit once, Wind was very high. No idea if this will have negative impacts on my vesc, this was at the beginning of my ride and i didn't notice anything weird for the next 10 miles. No errors on phone either, I will increase the motor maxes once i get my BT module from @jlabs and i open the enclosure.

Other than it was a sick ride. I kinda got the pulley problem again :/ but i think it was the angle of the motor that was the problem so i angled it down a little and it seems fine. Maybe i'll get longer belts... Going to change the MBS wheels soon as i feel like the knurling does not let it run true.

Some stats from today's ride
Motor Max:40 (till i can change both)
Max Speed: 36.5mph
Distance: 10.89miles
Voltage start: 40.8
Voltage end: 36.8
Average wh/mi : 9.53
Average speed: 15.79mph

Anyone have any suggestions on the next wheels i should get? :smiley:

Wheels: since you already have an abec style wheel pulley, try authentic flywheels in 97mm. If you can get a kegel style pulley, try the new boa 100mm wheels. 

Quality wheels make such a difference.

Update Again, probably last update till i decide to change some mechanical aspects of the board.
Rode the board till it died. Continuation from yesterday's 10.89 mile trip. Rode an additional 7.12 miles before it went kaput. So a total of about 18.01 miles. I honestly thought i'd be getting over 20 miles but then again the terrain i was riding on was gradually elevated with lots of small inclines every so often. Plus an average of 16mph on both rides would no doubt have had an effect. Also aggressive constant acceleration rather than singular throttle position through the rides.

I also feel that i am not operating the motor at a good efficiency. I'll bump motor max to 70a and batt max to 35a and i think that would be a sweet spot for the board. Any opinions on this?

Just A little update. 
![IMG_9172|375x500](upload://cHaBnVVxgbHtmYw5s2Ml1YQrGyT.jpeg)
I added some braided sleeving as the zip ties were cutting into the cables. nothing exposed but i didn't wanna risk it.
![72C9B298-D430-4D74-9AAF-A6F47511061E|690x388](upload://xHVwdLckEHcnMFj2fpFg6D8vH9W.JPG)
Also added some less bulky neoprene to help with shock absorption. i had nothing in there previously so this is good. I like it because it's not bulky and it does the job.

Last thing i'm waiting for is my TSG pass *wink* *wink* @JLabs and another BT module from the man himself.

In addition to this i upped my motor max to 60, batt max to 35. acceleration is improved. love it. will increase to 80 once module comes in.
