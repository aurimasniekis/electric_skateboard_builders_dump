Hi, this is my first build and already very addicted to e-skate,The build is under testing and will get some improvements along the way, please don't hesitate to give me advise on improvements.

I own 2 cheap chinese boards Verreal V1 with 2 10s2p in parallel for 10s4p and a Backfire G1. these boards have been good but lacking in refinement and performance

I have done lots of research and learned a lot from this forum and its members, Thanks.

Motor 50+ 40- Battery 35+ 12- gearing 15/36 100mm wheels feels very smooth powerful and fast, have done 10km of riding and so far so good.

Update: Have enjoyed my first 100km of riding and have tuned my settings to 
+70 -45 motor amps. +40 -12 Battery amps. startup boost to 0.08
this has improved power and reduced cogging to a bare minimum.

My fastest speed yet 45kph but it goes faster, range is around 18km until  cutoff  start at 44v. I have not felt any voltage sag, it could be geared a bit lower maybe 42?

Next step is to make it dual diagonal and install my newly arrived focbox unity with a proper [enclosure](https://nz.element14.com/takachi/tw13-3-18b/multipurpose-enclosure-abs-black/dp/2444708) with [heatsink](https://nz.element14.com/wakefield-solutions/623k/heat-sink/dp/1592038),that should improve traction, torque and brakes but could reduce the range?

Cheers 
Anders

Cool stuff! What's holding the FocBox zip tie to the deck if I may ask? I might want to try something like that myself.

The cable tie is only there to secure the remote reciever that also sits with double sided tape. 
Focbox is mounted to an aluminium plate with 4 m3 screws and heat sink tape in between, the plate is  mounted to the deck with 2 m5 bolts to threaded inserts and 3mm silicon vibration dampener between, on one of the m5 bolts there is a L-bracket that has a hole for the cable tie that secures the reciever.

Looks nice and a well rounded DIY. Very nice, what speed and mileage are you getting?

Also how is the breaking with only one wheel coming from dual (although hubs) any difference?

Would this thing smoke your other boards? That motor must be wayyy more powerful than dual hubs combined easy

Thanks, Theoretical speed max loaded 53kph min speed loaded 43kph to be confirmed soon but it feels right. 

Milage should be 17km according to the calculator but I will start at 4.2v and finish at 3.6v and that gives me 4200mah at 12s with max 31mv deviation between cells, so around 15km conservatively or 10km going very fast. 

The battery is rated at 90c and 12s I discharge at 35ah battery and regen at -12 that gives me 1550w. Breaking is more powerful but you need to keep weight on the drive wheel, there is no comparison between the other boards in any way. 

The board weighs 7.5kg can be charged as 2x6s split with anti-spark key. If I charge at 1c it will be done in one hour, battery is rated at 10c charging.

Update 3: Installed Focbox Unity with heatsinked enclosure [heatsink](https://nz.element14.com/wakefield-solutions/623k/heat-sink/dp/1592038)
Esc temp was around 28 degrees C when pulling 60 motor amps and was dropping very quickly to 24 degrees after slowing down, outside temp was 14C.
Motor amps +70-60 Battery amps +60 -20
Kick to start and auto shutdown after 8 min of inactivity.
Running with 1 motor SK3 6374 149kv 15/36 100mm.
Focbox Unity is amazingly smooth and has a lot of power compared to single focbox.![57678193_2168215043232176_6962830139361067008_n|375x500](upload://kXR6SsZNlQt0v140HASDVncirMw.jpeg) ![58113360_315747195777440_7200907881749676032_n|666x500](upload://hvA83tjurYL5weRJRvVjknLnNXT.jpeg) ![58610212_313991292608327_4290445472826392576_n|666x500](upload://n7CFVJxsHokkq47nEqWdsQ26JlZ.jpeg) ![59022719_463607351044158_2783276332660817920_n|666x500](upload://kjbguvfhFZFgtVDSsPklvjdj20.jpeg) ![58377257_2124358284521322_3067515022042202112_n|666x500](upload://wQfoudgv1CfsT4zJHTBYHWzLiXX.jpeg) ![58461007_416964372415906_2785720607138906112_n|375x500](upload://9cZ0y8DJMnux4QpPPJldcbirwYg.jpeg)

Update 4: After riding the board for 400km with single Focbox in BLDC and I thought it cant get much better but O'boy was I wrong Focbox unity is so much better at everything, 
smoothness, power, connectivety, ease to setup, push to start and auto shutdown.

Next step is another motor, 6354 150kv sensored to run front toeside for dual diagonal together with SK3 6374 149kv unsensored, I will also change my gearing to 15/42, to begin with I will use 3d printed wheel pulleys from @krazor to figure out what my optimum gearing is.

First rides in dual diagonal configuration, so much power that the hills feel flat.

Settings for both motors +70-40 each, battery +80-20 at 12s,  gearing 15/42.

Wheel pulleys are 3d printed in petg by @krazor  and are holding up great so far, liking the torque of 42t dual motors vs single and 36t.

Thanks,
The fan is designed by @JohnA https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2747889 I have used it for a while and it's working really well, protect and cools the motor.

Have ridden the board for 500km in dual diagonal configuration and it performs very good, although I am thinking about making it a dual 6354 rear wheel drive for less torque steering.

I made a portable charger with external bms that I have been using as my main charger over 30 times, charging at 5A it balances within 10mv,  is very fast and stays lukewarm.

Bought new wheels, evolve gtr 97mm that I can highly recommend.
