Hi everyone,

Ever since I finished my build my friend has decided to make his own esk8 (yay!). I'm going to be helping with the build which will be really fun but I'm struggling to find one part suitable - the motor mount.

He's got this deck. The trucks are relatively round and not like the Caliber II trucks I've got. Any suggestions or will he need to change the trucks all together?

Thanks,

Thank you! Would it be the Paris trucks option? I'm not sure what the Osprey use. I know the wheels on the deck are replicas of ABEC Flywheels

If they are round the Paris option should work.
