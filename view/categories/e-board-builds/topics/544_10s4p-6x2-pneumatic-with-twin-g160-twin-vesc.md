This isn't a new build, but it is a major update in parts. Started as an 8s single. Here's goes:

Bottlenose Double drop/Drop thru Deck http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEON-GREEN-Drop-Down-Through-LONGBOARD-Lowrider-SKATEBOARD-Deck-CRUISER-/371481743639?hash=item567e099117:g:IuUAAOSwT5tWPS2T

2 VESC's - http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller

Custom Aluminum Pneumatic Wheels 
Matco 2x6 tires

10s4p Li-ion Pack 

Psychotiller Split Symetrical Enclosure http://www.ebay.com/itm/172007495998?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649

15/42 pulleys with 9mm belts SDP-SI.com and VexRobotics.com
  
Wii Chuck 

In true fashion, I'm mounting my 63mm motors Dual rear with Motor mounts reversed toward the pivot. 
I'm using a drop down/drop through deck and mounting the trucks drop through.
I'm stealing some LHB tech and routing the motor wires through the deck.

This is where I'm at right now..Still waiting on the VESC's And then I'll need to figure out how to set those up.

Pictures will happen soon!

what's the major difference between a turnigy g160 and the sk3 series?

They seem to be around the same price, both have 8mm shafts, 63mm diameter, etc. I'm guessing one is for heli's (g160), and one is for airplanes (sk3), but how would that change the actual motor..

haha no worries if you don't know!

The g160 has 3 16mm bearings inside it. The sk3 has a skirt bearing and a 16 mm bearing. Also, the  g160  is smaller in length allowing dual rear setups with  true 63mm rotors (more torque) in 195mm trucks.

I know the deck's looking a little beat, but forgive me for now...This is basically just a mock up. I epoxied the clamps onto the randall hanger until I get my randle clamps made. I'm going to buy a new deck this week too. Now that I have a better idea of how I'm laying out the wiring through the deck this is going to be a fun build!

I had some heavy gauge coated copper wire that I ran through some dremeled channels. Then I epoxied over that. The new deck will get the same treatment, but the channels will be a little deeper and a whole lot cleaner. :laughing:

Love the build Psychotiller! FYI if anyone is interested Psychotiller makes some awesome abs enclosures, I just picked up a few for some builds I'm working on and I am stoked to say the least! Thanks again you saved me the hassle of forming my own, why would you need to when the designs and price are right coming from your own community members!

Big thanks go out to @SubCreative ! This 10s4p battery is Top Shelf.

Yes he's in the U.S. You can get a bms. I got mine with balance leads and an xt60 plug. But he did also include an extra charge port for me to use a computer similar smart charger. Not sure on the powerswitch. Shoot Sub a PM from his link.

Looks real similar to what I am looking to set up for a commuter board to tackle NYC potholes. @psychotiller how much clearance you have under the enclosure? How much flex that deck have? (if any) Got a total weight on that set up?
```

I have a ton of clearance under my enclosure. almost 2 1/4 inches. Weight is around 21 lbs with the 10s4p.
Not much flex at all. I've never really liked flexy decks.

When you get around to it could you post a range test with that set up as well as your test rider weight. I'm still toying around with 10S-12S multi phase power pack. Just hope to keep it all under 10kg so it is a realistic commuter board.

I made a partition for my VESC's out of ABS scrap that I had. Should keep everything separate and safe.

Finally got some time to mess around with my vesc's today. Everything is working! I ran the FOC tests and made some small adjustments. VERY PLEASED!  

Cant wait to put some miles on this rig! Woot!

What are the dimensions of the 10s4p battery? Do you have a low profile enclosure like the one for space cell for it? Thinking of upgrading and using spacecell on a single drive board.

My 10s4p does fit in the Low pro  enclosure. you would need to use split 21" version though to accomodate the vesc. -On a side note, if you didn't want the enclosure that long it could be trimmed at the seam to make it shorter. 

I used my Split sym enclosure which is 19.5" long and a little deeper than the low pro. The reason is I stacked my vesc's side by side on top of my battery.

I barely fit the spacecell and 2 vesc in the 21 inch....  but i guess the bms isnt in the packaging so it may be about the same size.

I have bought a Drok Voltmeter,it need 3-30 volts to power it , but can measure from 0-100V ,so i need to get power elsewhere than directly from the battery. Is'nt there a 5 v out on the vesc ?

Have you considered using a pocket hole jig for drilling clean low angle holes. I have one and it's amazing. Requires a step drill bit.

I would turn the motor mounts so they face inward on the board. Then the motors would be under your sweet deck, and may be more protected while giving your board a more sleek look.

All builds are different. You'll eventually notice I have many and that I made those parts, and know that they can mount that way, and didn't do that because it's a drop deck, mounted drop through, with 63mm motors. Lol
