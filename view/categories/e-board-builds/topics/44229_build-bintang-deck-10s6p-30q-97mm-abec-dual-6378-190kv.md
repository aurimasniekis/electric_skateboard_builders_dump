I'm trying to rally my confidence through this post to start my build. I have all the parts and more listed in the title, but am terrified to start the battery build. I don't want to blow shit up and screw this esk8 thing up for everyone else. I've been reading and learning a lot here so below are some of the resources, parts, and issues I've read/bought/struggling about.

**Inspiration:** for this build is of two things. 
1) [This build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-darth-maul-sector-9-bintang-dual-6374s-focboxes-12s4p-torqueboards-218mm-trucks/36845) by the infamous @Eboosted 
2) Every off-road Trampa builds ever. 

**Goals:**
* "Infinite" range - I want something that can conquer the shitty roads that we all have. For me, those roads are in San Francisco.
* Off road capable -  I also want something that never dies. So That is why I want a 6P build.

**Parts**
* Bintang Deck from Sector 9
* 97mm Abec Flywheels (not off-road but it seems easier to deal with for the initial version of this board)
* Dual Focbox
* 60 Samsung 30Q cells in a 10S6P configuration.
* DIY esk8 reverse motor mount
* Dual 6378 190KV motors

**Resources**
* https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ollinboards-cell-level-fuse/7392
* http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-bms-will-i-need-with-two-vescs/27004/48
* Others to follow

**Submitted topics**
* http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/10s6p-or-12s5p/39251
* http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/convert-bdlc-to-foc-guide/38835
* http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/10s6p-cell-level-fusing-ideas/43635

**Things left to decide**
* Cell level fusing, how will I do it with two rows. I haven't seen a lot or any of that on this forum.
* I own a spot welder, I'm trying to determine if I should solder as that seems easier with the two-layer battery design.

**Things left to buy**
* 80W solder station (if I decide to solder)
* Properly [gauged copper wire](https://www.remingtonindustries.com/tinned-copper-wire/tinned-copper-wire-buss-wire-22-awg-7-spool-sizes/) or nickel strip
* BMS - I have reached out to [Bestech BMS](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html) but they haven't gotten back to me...
* Power switch
* ENCLOSURE!!! What will this battery fit in!? I cannot find anything for certain.

Battery pics so far, more to follow.
This is the configutation I was invisioning with the bussbar on the side. Thoughts?

I'm really glad I was able to inspire people around the world, it makes me truly happy. However, the true inspirations, were the guys that started everything like @okp @whitepony @kaly @nowind those are the gods around here! 

This build is gonna be epic, I'm not sure but with two later of cells you will suffer with ground clearance, the weight of the board is gonna hurt your back every time you lift it. 

Can't wait to see the final board. Good vibes to you and your project!

Thank you for the encouragement @Eboosted! You're right they are "gods" and there are so many great contributors here.

Ground clearance is going to be an issue. I'm timidto go too high as I hear more traditional skates hate, though I have a one wheel so perhaps I'll be more acquainted with the higher elevation. We'll see!

Any tips on a slick hot enclosure? I've seen yours which I love I just think they're a little on the shallow side for the two layer.

One thing I don't have here are properly sized belts. Mine are too short for the reverse mount setup. Anyone know where to find 320mm HTD 12 belts? TD sells them but they are no doubt overpriced. That size is what is recommended, anyone had luck with other sizes?

The BMS just came in, the battery build can begin. In a way it already has. I made a battery for my drill since the one it came with died (4S1P). Its not as much voltage as the one it came with but there is no voltage sag!

Are going to increase the wheelbase as the Darth Maul?

Use fish paper on the boarders between the nickel strips and the battery

It might be a good idea to turn down the amps on the spotwelder just a little bit, the burn marks itâ€™s leaving indicate it might be a bit high. Idk for sure but I just saw this on another thread. Well done with the build

I did some testing with the nickel (.015) I have (I tested itâ€™s validity) and any weaker setting made the weld easy to tear off, even by hand. This is the only setting I found that was between a solid weld and blowing a hole in the nickel.

Ok well it must be fine then, if itâ€™s giving good results keep going. Maybe just try and give each cell a little break between every few welds so it doesnâ€™t get too hot

Thanks y'all! It was a long time coming. I finally went on a hilly (mountainous basically) first ride ND easily got 30 miles. I live in SF so that is saying a lot. I'll take some action shots soon, hoping to go for a group ride here in SF weekend after next so well see what I get.

Let me know if you want to see anything in particular.

This is a great build! I am curious about how you weld your batteries together. I see you spot weld but did you have anything else? Could you send a picture? I am looking to build the exact same pack. 10S6P. I am worried just nickel strips wonâ€™t handle the current.
Thanks!
