First off, this build is a [remix of my A2ESK8 Mini Cruiser](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/a2esk8-mini-cruiser-30-carbon-fiber-deck-single-carvon-v2-hub-motor-12s1p-lifepo4-vesc/5543) and inspired by @VladPomogaev prolific [build on Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Electric-Skateboard-v20/). Big shout out to @maxz @Michaelinvegas and @longhairedboy for renewing interest in old school skate decks. Essentially all I've done is port over my carbon fiber mini cruiser components onto my classic Speed Demons red and black checkerboard skateboard deck. But forget the science for a moment. Let's talk about nostalgia...

What the hells a Speed Demons deck? Well Speed Demons is a company based in El Segundo, California that operates under the Dwindle Distribution label alongside other brands like Enjoi, Darkstar, Almost, and Tensor. They are pretty cheap, non premium boards that you can find just about anywhere back in the day. However, 10 years ago, it was all I could afford at the time as a scrappy kid in NYC running around shooting rap videos. This thing has been with me everywhere, during some of most poignant moments in my life. It's been abused like no tomorrow but there is no way I would ever get rid of it. However, now that I've gotten into ESK8, there was only one thing I could do...

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e97bb3ce64a3e2a53452273ac5921aea1c28b706.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Electrify it!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/52c9da4a8c9e331eea8df5cdc16c822df5630d28.jpg" width="690" height="388">

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7e8319354bb2e30fdeff30dd7774bc0692f4077a.jpg" width="690" height="388">

First step was lengthening the original 13.5" wheelbase by adding approximately 3" distance from end to end. Using painter's tape, I was able to add some visual measurements to ensure proper alignment.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/716f0e153089662008eee5dd7d3b4ec8f69ee40c.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Next I drilled all the truck holes on both ends of the kicktails. The rear kicktail had slightly more edge clearance than the front which is fine as it helped me distinguish front and back. Once this was done, it created a wheelbase of approximately 19.5", more than enough room for my 11" enclosure.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/40aae06455fb987cd19d96dfc12857f4e24da0b4.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I then added the 10" Carvon trucks and Abec11 90mm Flywheels along with 1/4" shock pad risers and 78a standard barrel and cone bushings to test the ride.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1afc8bf5c1cf93c067ddddfa1b8646e234d48605.jpg" width="690" height="388">

At 125-130lbs I'm a lightweight which means no wheelbite with this setup. Stepping on this deck is like coming home from a long vacation - it just feels comfortable as hell. With the trucks mounted at the kicktails it gives the board a drop down effect so you immediately feel that instant pocket of stability.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d1176a1cd6c6408c9b896daf83281295322206e7.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Next I ported over my electronics. I really, REALLY love how adaptable this setup is especially for these mini cruiser builds. This compact 12s1p LiFePO4 system paired with a @chaka VESC and @LEVer V2 hub motor has been incredibly reliable. LiFePO4 A123 cells are becoming my favorite cells because of the smooth discharge and minimal voltage sag. I love these cells so much I've started working on a 12s2p battery as my next project. Ask @Kaly he'll tell you how dope these cells are.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c0aeb8d4353dc488f0d19511632bfcf18b5fefad.jpg" width="690" height="388"> 

As you can see there's a really interesting dichotomy happening here - a blending of old school aesthetics with modern ESK8. I'm sure many of you have decks that you are emotionally attached to and my reaction to this build brought back so many good memories while also opening up a bunch of other possibilities for the future. This is the type of shit that you pass onto your kids! And while the LiFePO4 cells don't dictate the slimmest enclosure, it provides the perfect amount of clearance for my needs, especially with those 90mm Abec11's.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b2182ea85ff30a479b4ac6156119cc83e90c85dc.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I took a quick ride around the block and it was simply amazing. It's almost easier to ride especially for beginners or anyone who prefers a more stable, yet driftier setup along with that familiarity of riding a traditional skateboard deck. Essentially, by mounting the trucks on the kicktails, it distributes your weight over the trucks more evenly, resulting in an overall lower center of gravity. By using softer bushings, I'm able to create better response in the trucks. Since you aren't standing directly on the trucks, your standing platform is confined between them which makes it more stable. Also since the board is closer to the pavement, pushing and cruising is way easier, especially commuting through a dense city.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/89090614d39c9ce5267cb05a34fb5202edb93bb4.jpg" width="690" height="388">

My conclusion here is that EVERYONE should try this. These decks are way cheaper than longboards and chances are you already have an old school deck collecting dust in your closet or you can easily find vintage ones on eBay or at garage sales that have way more personality than something brand spanking new. Honestly, this takes DIY to a whole new level for me because I have a better story to tell. When someone asks me about the deck I can tell them about the time I let Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo skate around on it in a parking lot while waiting for the next setup on a music video. I think that's a much more organic segue into ESK8 than saying "yeah I bought this online and it arrived in a box".

So what's your story? Let me see your old school decks. I'm looking at you @longhairedboy

@RunPlayBack Looking good, bud! I think you and I might be the only two people in the world to try this! :wink: (probably not, but I bet there ain't too many). It's such a weird looking setup, but like you said, rides surprisingly well. Kind of reminds me of and old shitty car, dropped on air bags, with super wide rims worth more than the car. 

And since you asked to see more unicorn dinosaurs, here's my OLD, OLD school double decker foam sandwich experiment board. It was one of those "wonder if I can?...gonna have to try it now" moments. Basically, when I got my first DIY components all together, I started electrifying everything I could, starting with my old long board, then my old street board, then my older Santa Cruzer, then two boards at once, then a car bucket seat on a longboard, and so on. You know, all the ridiculous things I dreamed about when I was growing up.

And now, the nearly finished current iteration of my 90's Santa Cruz deck.

@whitepony haha yeah it is kind of a crazy angle but it actually feels super safe and responsive with the stretched 19.5" wheelbase. Popping it up is a little challenging because I don't get the same leverage but everything else about it feels so good.

@Mobutusan lol, those Santa Cruz decks are classics! I wish I kept the decks I had back then - I know one of my first boards was a Vision. It's really amazing how this thing rides, like I said it's almost like a mini drop down deck.

@NNGG true your right, some of these skate decks can be as much as or even more than the blank longboards

I've got a few extra VESCs from that january order.. and maybe an extra remote or two.. and a couple extra motors. just need to find a box worthy of one of the bones brigade's  finest's signature boards and a smallish BMS that actually works as designed and isn't a brick when i receive it. 

its a 1991 ray underhill, and its going to be like restoring an antique with 2016 technology. Sort of like if i let Elon Musk have his way with my 87 toyota pickup.

Hey! Sick build. You inspired me on doing the same. Does it turn well?
I was thinking of installing the rear truck a little bit forward, do you think this is possible? So i can use the rear as a kicktail for easier turning and avoiding obstacles. Thanks!

It turns very well, although I'm using pretty soft bushings. The trick is to dial in just right to prevent the speed wobbles. Moving the rear truck to the front might mess with the overall height balance but might be worth a shot. You can also compensate for the height by using different sized angled risers. I find having the truck that far on the rear actually helps with my acceleration and carving because I'm able to really dig into the truck which makes it more responsive. This is on my Carvon hub setup so it may be different if your planning a belt drive. Also a nice bonus feature is that it can stand upright :slight_smile:

Previously I had some really soft green bushings on there from my Polar Bear trucks and very loose trucks and got wobbles around 20mph. I switched those out to 78a Venom bushings barrel and cone and no more speed wobbles. I'm between 125-130lbs.

I weigh 225lbs and ride Venom green barrels board side and venom red barrels road side. I push 30 mph and have never had speed wobbles. Of course I don't recommend those speeds unless you have clear open space and plenty of safety gear on.

It is very unsafe to over-compress the stock bushings for stability. This will sacrifice turning ability which will make to hard to dodge something if you needed to.

Hey dude! I'm here again. Inspired by your build i bought the rest of the things i needed and tomorrow i'll have them all. 
I'll be using a skate deck aswell. I already have the skate deck. But i'm afraid to f*ck up while drilling the truck holes. Do you have any tips to have them aligned perfectly? Thanks a lot!!

Yeah sure, so if you scroll up you'll notice how I used painter's tape to align all the holes. I think I did 3" from truck hole to truck hole. Remember to use the trucks you are mounting to mark the holes. Use a color that contrasts the color of your deck. Also go slowly :slight_smile:
