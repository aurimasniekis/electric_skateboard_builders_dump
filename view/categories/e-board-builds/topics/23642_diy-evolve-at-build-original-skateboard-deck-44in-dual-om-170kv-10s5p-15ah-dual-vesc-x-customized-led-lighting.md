Top speed: 26-28 mph
Range: 18-22 miles
Incline: 30-35% (tested this at a multi-level parking garage)
Monstrous torque and power with dual 170kv Olllin motors
Overall, my best build up to date!! Very happy with this build
Evolve AT wheels are the bomb! Perfectly round and insanely awesome build quality.

Total cost: Approx $1100, $900 short of Evolve GT All-Terrain
DIY FTW! :smiley:

Surely you mean 30% not 30 degrees. You'd be hard pressed to find that long of incline on a road or trail to begin with.

Beautiful work!  Great to see someone take the elements they love from a design and better it in form, function and price! :punch:
