Hi everybody,

After doing a lot of research I decided to build my first electric skateboard. I mostly followed the model of the Boosted Board. I was also inspired by the builds of:
- @Eboosted: [link](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-vanguard-caliber-ii-44-custom-10s4p-3d-printed-enclosure-abec-11-97mm-75a/13361)
- @squad: [link](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/full-diy-revived-boosted-board-2-0/21296)
- @pyttroll: [link](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-loaded-vanguard-single-motor-homemade-10s4p-bms-vesc/13973)

Many thanks to everybody who spent the time to answer my questions.
  
For people reading this, I never did real woodwork in my life and I started with almost no tools at all.
I hope this helps people who wants to build something similar and have no tools/experience :) .

I'm not so fond of the design on the back of the Loaded Vanguard so I started sanding the deck with a 60 Grit Sand Paper.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/2/c2cb200dd4945a9befe09ba0a0fb6be58b51f1b3.jpg" width="666" height="500">
Girldfriend sanding the board :).

After several hours of sanding the result was good but not clean enough and I started to loose patience.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/7/f7675003ca2b657183039f4d529fdb3d870e3aae.jpg" width="666" height="500">

So I bought a Gel Paint Remover and I applied it directly on the board.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/a/aab330de9cdf3e0ed344bb2623d48dcc582fa673.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Board starting to look good.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/4/e4c0436c5b36a764060551d4dc1b4745c8e91235.jpg" width="666" height="500">

So I sandpapered the board gently with the 180 Grit and applied a first layer of clear gloss.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/c/2c93969a2e47e5d3f59a99f4b2828b252c627397.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Then, hours later I sanded it again with the 180 Grit and applied the second layer of clear gloss.

Result is not perfect but looks good :) .

Next step, battery pack.

Hey man! Congrats on the begining of the build! 

You should do the clear coat after the routing, install the nutserts/enclosure, position the VESC and motor mounts, trucks, when everything else has been installed in a perfect position at least once, begin with the detailing part such as clear coat, 
at the last moment after you have riden your board and there's nothing else to do, do the grip tape, otherwise you will suffer by scratching that sweet clear coat finish.

If you do get a spot welder. Just tossing this out there. The 120V models from China are not the same as the 240V models. The circuit board in the 120V spot welders have either a blown traces on the board or a blown triac. I haven't seen an issue with the ones on 240V.

check out the arduino controlled spot welder kits if you don't mind running it off a car battery and making yourself.

let me find a link if the kit is still up.  I'll add it here.

Bummer KaeptnBalu isn't offering the kit any longer.  :frowning:

(EDIT - found them on his site, no longer on tindie):

I'm sorry if these are stupid questions but I am trying to learn as much as possible about these packs and have a hard time understand how you would attach those packs if they are end to end like in the bottom two groups in your diagram.

Okay Smorto, after talking extensively with @Eboosted, I'm going to go with this battery design:

Which will results in something like this (spot welder in grey and gold for bullet connector):
Right angle are where the nickel will be bended.

Awesome, so you are going to have basically 5 separate packs that you connect with bullet connectors to make the full pack? How do you plan on soldering the bullet connectors on? Are the nickel strips in the middle going to be longer so you can bend them without breaking them? How do you plan on putting each group of 4 in parallel with the strips, just in a circle kind of with the strips? Also, please please please take as many pictures as possible so I can understand exactly how you are doing this so I can do it myself! Best of luck!

[/quote]

That's correct each of the 5 packs would have 3.7v * 2 packs * 3Ah * 4 parallel cells = 88.8Wh (maximum permited is 100Wh), that's considering you are going with a Samsung 30Q

[quote="Smorto, post:22, topic:23213"]
How do you plan on soldering the bullet connectors on?
[/quote]

You just need mount the bullets over the previouslu spot welded or iron soldered nickel strip and use flux and solder to weld the male and female bullets between packs.

[quote="Smorto, post:22, topic:23213"]

Just solder the 4 negative first and then the 4 positive leads with nickel strips, then you will have a pack of 4 in parallel.

Thanks for all the info! Really helped. However, I have one question, to put the cells in parallel it would be like this right? With the lines being the nickel strip?

Finally received the ring adhesives for the cells. 

So I added this insulation on the positive side:

Then, @pyttroll drilled my board for the cases:
https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Iye8vflu0e4ED4I/giphy.gif

He sanded the board to remove the grip tape and dug the board for the VESC Battery wires:

Final result:

He also drilled the enclosures for screws, switch and battery plug (I will add pictures of that later).

For now I have all the parts (except the remote...) so the build will move on pretty quickly.
Again thank you @pyttroll for the invaluable help! Can't wait to have a ride together once it is done. 

Next step will be spot weldering the cells.

I decided not to solder the bullet connectors and do everything with the spot welder. Final result with insulation tape:

I started adding the same color Dupont wire on the BMS. After that I took a break and will continue today.
Next step is to solder the charger, the switch and the BMS together and find a way to place them in the case.
Also I'm currently mounting the motor on the back of the longboard.

Nice, what do you mean when you say "Dupont" wires for the balance wires? Also wouldn't not soldering the bullet connectors defeat the purpose of making a pack that can be split up to go on an airplane? Also, was the nickel strip hard to bend to get the cells like that and what nickel strip did you use? Sorry for all the questions but I am very curious!

@rok I had to bend them like that according to the drawing few post before.
 >  what do you mean when you say "Dupont" wires for the balance wires?

It's a type of pluggable wires called dupont wires (google dupont wires). I used them for the B-...B1+...B9+.


> Also wouldn't not soldering the bullet connectors defeat the purpose of making a pack that can be split up to go on an airplane?

Totally, but I was not confident enough to solder the bullet connectors without breaking anything. Since it will take the airplane most likely one time I can still remove the nickel strip that are in place of the bullet connectors.

> Also, was the nickel strip hard to bend to get the cells like that and what nickel strip did you use?

No, extremely easy to bend. It's pure nickel strip that @pyttroll lent me.

> Also, can I see some more pics of where you decided to spot weld instead of solder bullet connectors? 

Okay I will add more pics of the battery pack later today.

For now, I'm in the process of soldering the switch, BMS, the charger and the cables to will go above the board. I'm very near completion.
I started mounting the mount with the motor.
Switch:

Ordered a cheap remote controller on eBay, still waiting. But I might buy the one from Enertion.

Im sorry but Im still a little confused as to how you spot welded your pack instead of using the bullet connectors, could you take a few more pics of the side of the pack? Thanks so much!

I choose not to use bullet connectors since I'm not really conformable soldering them on the cells.

At this point battery pack is not at all designed to be "airplane approved".

I will write them down later in this thread.

Also amazing news yesterday, I removed all the Dupont wires because they were not really reliable in my case. I also used bigger cable.

And then:

Success !

I will mount everything and regrip next week since I'm going on holidays.

Still need to regrip the board.

Did not had the chance to run it extensively since I need to charge the battery pack. Video coming soon!

Are you planning to run a second motor in the near future? If not you naught want to upgrade to 6374 motor to have better acceleration. 

What are your VESC settings? I suggest you upload the @ackmaniac firmware

So i received @Quent17 's battery pack on my bench the other night, no offence but it scared the fuck out me. So FISA... (fuck it start again)

I just had enough nickel strip to do one half of the battery, looking good so far and most importantly... safe!

The battery was falling to pieces, bad spotwelds and construction.

He asked me question about the behavior, told him to bring it in for a closer look (he lives 10-15mins away from me)

Complete story is that I finished the build and found out the battery was badly built:
- Bad spotwelds.
- Bad contacts between the cells.
- BMS lead solders breaking all the time.

I was able to do few rides but there was constant disconnections.
I didn't feel safe riding the board with such a shitty battery so I asked @Blasto to take a look and he was kind enough to fix it.

@Eboosted I am possibly planning to run a second motor in the future as I bought another one. However, not sure two motors will fit because of the 15mm width belt. 
I'm using @Ackmaniac firmware, acceleration and speed are more than enough for me right now. Will see if I need the upgrade later.

Hey @smorto, I believe you're going to make a li-ion battery pack and was wondering if you would make a detailed thread on it when you've done it with lots of pictures, thanks.

I sure will if/when I build a pack which will be in the distant future probably, just soaking up info for now. TO give you an idea of how many pictures I take of my builds check out these threads.
