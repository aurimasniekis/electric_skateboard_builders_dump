None of this is official, let me know if you have any suggestions

Already have:
42" Sector 9 Flexy Deck
Bearings - Bones Super Reds

Buying:
2x 5s 8000 mAh Zippy Flight Max
VESC
1x Carvon Single Hub Motor

Note: I live in Florida and am very lightweight. So virtually no hills.

Any suggestions will help!

Well planned setup, 16/36 will give you good speed with little less torque but since you don´t have hills in Florida, you won´t get any problems with that.

The only thing i would think about again is the choice of your batterys. I´m also using 2x 5S Lipos and seeing all these great flat 18650 li-ion builds here kind of pisses me off that i went for these big lipo blocks :smiley:

Are your trucks Calibers? You also need Flywheels. You can go with the clones as well, but if you can swing the real deal, I'd stick with Abec11. My preference is 90mm to get you over any bumps and gravel.

I'm still new to this but I'm about to start a fairly similar build. You're probably already aware but you'll only be getting around 7000rpm with a 190kv motor using a 10s setup. You'd be able to maintain your desired top speed (~48kph?) but with a better reduction ratio giving more torque if you went to a 12s setup. This is all assuming an 83mm wheel.

Hey, I have a 5055 brushless outrunner, a skateboard, rc transmitter, esc, but I need a motor mount. I`ve tried before and failed, but I want to try again and make a easy to make motor mount or buy a cheap motor mount, any suggestions? Would really help me out.

Welcome Michael! :slight_smile: What deck will you actually be using? 

Btw, take a look at the naming convention for new topics in the build category:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/about-the-e-board-builds-category/25?u=zeno

That way we can keep yours apart from all of the other first builds :)

I plan on getting flywheels 90mm yes. I forgot to mention that. I've been looking for the 75a, maybe you know where I  an find some? Or clones?

I will do that thanks for the suggestion. 

My deck is a 42" Sector 9 board I've had for about 4 years. I love it. Super flexy, I know that's not great for electric skateboards, I have a separate thread about that.

Costs..  Much more expensive,  however they seem to last way longer too. So in the long run it is probably a wise investment.

Ah nice :)  if you do a boosted board style enclosure (batteries on one side of the board near front truck,  esc and remote board near back truck) it could work with a very flexy board.

if there are no hills I say go for a 5065 motor so you can save weight. or maybe a 6354.

but really you should go hub motor! smoother and easier to setup. but no hubs on gullwings yet...but those aren't the best for speed anyways..

and a flex deck can be done, my 44" bamboo pintail has split enclosres. look at @whitepony's vanguard!

@longhairedboy is in orlando, and I'm up in Jax. We are looking to do a group ride at some point, so when your board is finished you ought to join us!

I meant save weight on the board. at some point you'll get where youre going and have to carry it.

Since you don't need the torque, a smaller motor is almost half the weight, not much but it all adds up.

also enertion motor mount is only for caliber trucks, and it seems like shipping is taking some time..

I think you're asking for speed wobble with that setup. Flexy deck plus double-pivot rear truck is just too much instability at higher speeds. And I'm saying this as a guy rockin a sidewinder up front myself. My rear truck is zero degrees, the back wheels don't turn at all. I can't do figure-8's in my driveway anymore but I'm much more stable at high speeds. 

You live in the flats and you're light. I agree with the poster above that you should look at hubs. Hit up @LEVer, he'll set you up with a single-hub rear truck and a vesc.  His hubs are basically the same motor as the one you want to buy, but it's rewired for more torque than his last version. You won't have to deal with any brackets, pulleys or belts and it'll coast more like a skateboard.

I knew someone was going to say that. I'm really not one to go fast, it is just for getting around campus.

I had sidewinders when I had an Evolve Gen2 Bamboo. One of the problems with the sidewinders is how much longer they make your wheelbase. The larger your wheelbase, the larger your turning radius. At 10mph you can have super loose sidewinder trucks and they work great, but at 17-18mph, they're pretty sketch unless you crank them down or get hard bushings. Plus they make your board feel much larger and they add extra weight.

I second the recommendation for hubs. The Carvon V2.5 is a nice package deal and easy to install.

So I've been riding my sidewinder build for about 3-4 years now, I had another board for a little while. Drop down, super firm, and I think bear trucks. I actually still have it. But my problem was I literally could not turn on it, I tried every different tightness, and nothing. Would a solution be to get softer bushings?

Just compared the prices, if I did it without the hub motor, total cost would come out to about 295, and the single is 299, and since there will be virtually no maintenance, looks like I will be choosing the hub motor.

Is the Hub motor louder, or quieter than a brushless motor?

My Carvon on FOC mode is silent. Even on a quiet street at night. 

There's definitely less maintenance with hubs. I change belts every 6 months on my belt drive unless I have an early break or a rock gets caught in one. So that's a little savings there. [quote="Michael319, post:23, topic:9208, full:true"]

I have a set of Bears. Nice trucks, but I prefer Calibers. The Funbox Trucks that the Carvon's come with ride similar to my Caliber II's. I put soft bushings on my regular boards and my Esk8's. I weigh 135, so I just don't have the weight to compress harder bushings as easily. That's probably your issue with turning on your Bears.

Do you use 78a bushings? 80a?
```

## \#26 Posted by: Mrmoonlight Posted at: 2016-09-09T17:01:24.165Z Reads: 93

I mix it up between 78's to 90's, barrels and cones. If you want more turn, go softer and cones. More stability go with barrels. It's one of those things you have to experiment a bit with to get the set up you like. I have 90 barrels board side and 88 barrels street side on my Carvon hubs right now. Not super turny, but stable at higher speeds. Probably going to switch to 88's board side though. 

Your weight is going to be a major factor as well. If you weigh 120 for example, 88's are going to feel like 92's for someone who's 150.

About 120, might be choosing 82 board side, and 80 streetside

That's a pretty good place to start. You can also mix and match with the stock Carvon bushings. Getting the right bushing setup can be a night and day difference in your ride.
